The 'Little Master' said that the ICC should look into the matter, in order to ensure equal playing conditions for both the teams. Gavaskar's comments came after Australia defeated New Zealand in the final of the T20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday. Mitchell Marsh and David Warner starred with the bat as Australia trounced New Zealand by 8 wickets, clinching their maiden T20 World Cup title. Chasing a target of 173, the Aaron Finch-led side won the game with 7 balls to spare. Gavaskar, however, congratulated Australia for their approach, highlighting that the commentators were saying that dew wasn't much of a factor in the final. \"If you were listening to the commentators, they said that due factor wasn't there in the final but has been there in the previous games and maybe it's something that need to be looked at. \"But you may also say that if the group matches are played at the same time, then why change for the knockouts,\" the 71-year-old said during a discussion on Sports Today . For the record, 29 of the 45 games were won by teams batting second. In fact, several players and coach staff members have re-iterated the disadvantage teams batting second have faced in the tournament. \"But again, I feel that is something for the ICC Cricket Committee to get their heads around and make sure that it's a level playing field for both teams,\" Gavaskar added. Marsh smashed an unbeaten 50-ball 77 while Warner, who was named 'Player Of The Tournament', slammed a 38-ball 53 as Australia chased down the target with ease. Promoted Gavaskar also said that the Australians could have gone on to chase over 200 with the ease with which they were batting. \"I think Mitchell Marsh played an extraordinary innings, and David Warner has done well in the last few matches. New Zealand would have wanted to get Warner more than Aaron Finch but they didn't get him and here we are. They won with six (seven) balls to spare, and with (Glenn) Maxwell and Marsh at the crease, those balls could have gone for 20 runs as well.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-09/dsqv8dpo_sunil-gavaskar-afp_625x300_29_September_21.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Team India next Cricket match: Full list of India cricket schedule 2021-2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-team-india-next-cricket-match-full-list-of-india-cricket-schedule-2021-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","India Cricket Team","Indian cricket schedule","Indian Cricket team","Team India"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"India cricket schedule 2021-2022: The Indian cricket team faces yet another jam-packed schedule after the ICC T20 World Cup 2021.

The next T20 World Cup is not even a year away, and the focus will again be on T20s in the upcoming season. India is to set to tour South Africa and England in the next cycle, whereas there are some home series as well. The Indian players complain about their busy schedule, and things are only getting tighter. There are not many spaces to relax for the players. India cricket schedule 2021-2022 New Zealand tour of India Team India is set to play 3 T20Is and 2 tests against New Zealand at home. The tour will start on 17 November 2021 with the T20Is, and it will end on 7 December with the test series. Jaipur, Ranchi, and Kolkata will host the T20Is, whereas Mumbai and Kanpur will host the tests. India tour of South Africa Just after 10 days of New Zealand’s tests, India will start their South African tour on 17 December 2021. The tour will consist of 3 tests, 3 ODIs, and 4 T20Is. Johannesburg will host the first test on 17 December 2021, whereas Paarl will host the last T20I on 26 January 2022. Johannesburg, Centurion, and Cape Town will host the test games, whereas Paarl and Cape Town will host all the white-ball games. India isn’t playing any warmup games before the first Test in South Africa. Workload management is necessary…absolutely necessary…but no game-time for batters ahead of the first Test in SA might be a source of regret.

Former captain Dravid, who played 164 tests and 344 one-dayers between 1996 and 2012 and accumulated more than 10,000 runs in both formats, will succeed Ravi Shastri, beginning with the home series against New Zealand from Wednesday. \"Obviously, as a youngster I did try and pick his brain and I did understand the game better, and understand the art of batting better from him, and he's been more than kind and he's been very helpful to all of us back home in Karnataka,\" Rahul, who hails from the same state as Dravid, said on Monday. \"It'll be a great opportunity and great time for all of us to learn from him and get better as cricketers and understand the game better, and understand the game from his point of view.\" Dravid has coached India's Under-19 and A teams and was also the head of the National Cricket Academy. Following Virat Kohli's decision to step down as India's Twenty20 skipper, Mumbai batter Rohit Sharma will also make his full-time debut as the team's captain in the shortest format against the Black caps in Jaipur. Rahul said Rohit was already a proven leader, having steered the Mumbai Indian franchise to five Indian Premier League titles. \"He has a great understanding of the game and tactically he's really, really good, and that's why he's been able to achieve the kind of things that he has as a leader,\" the 29-year-old said. \"The next few weeks, or the next few days, will be exciting, to understand what kind of goals he has ... It's a big change in Indian cricket, so we're all looking forward and really excited about it.\" (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Robert Birsel)","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/11/16/1369747.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my"},{"title":"Capital snubbed as World Cup venues unveiled","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/t20-world-cup-2022-australia-venues-where-is-it-when-is-it-games/fd39a0ea-0fb1-4e11-9104-b1bac9ee5ed8","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Twenty20 World Cup has only just wrapped up, but we're already only 12 months away from another one.","content":"The men's Twenty20 World Cup has only just wrapped up, but we're already only 12 months away from another one.Australia will host the tournament from October 16 next year, in a postponed version of the competition that was meant to run in 2020.The Aussies will now get the chance to defend their T20 title on their home soil, having beaten New Zealand in the final yesterday morning (AEDT) to win the UAE event.READ MORE: Papali'i rejects huge Dolphins offerThe ICC today announced venues for next year's World Cup.Adelaide, Brisbane, Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney will host the 45 games.READ MORE: Kyrgios says 2022 Australian Open should be cancelledREAD MORE: Scottie Pippen says Michael Jordan 'ruined basketball'Kardinia Park in Geelong has won the right to host the World Cup while Canberra, the nation's capital city, has been snubbed.

The 23-year-old, who hasn’t played a match since he hurt his shoulder in his Test debut against India in January, suffered a 10th concussion during pre-season training with Victoria on October 5. While his recovery has progressed, its understood Victorian officials didn’t want to pick Pucovski for a Shield clash without having tested himself at a lower level first. He was set to play for his club side Melbourne last weekend ahead of a Shield return, but all Victorian premier cricket matches were washed out. Pucovski also missed a second XI clash played in Sydney this week and without any game time under his belt, selectors opted against picking him for the SCG clash. He won’t be picked for Victoria until he has batted at a lower level and wasn’t considered for the Australian intra-squad clash set to be played in Brisbane on December 1. After making a half-century on Test debut at the SCG, Pucovski had been the first choice to open the batting with David Warner in the opening Ashes Test at the Gabba. But given Pucovski’s interrupted pre-season, national selection chief George Bailey has indicated Marcus Harris would now be given that opportunity allowing Pucovski to put any Test selection pressures to one side. Victorian coach Chris Rogers said national selectors had a “strong desire” to get the 23-year-old into the Test team, but everyone was taking a long-term view of Pucovski’s cricket future when he was overlooked for selection last week. “It’s really difficult just to walk into one of these games unprepared,” he said. “All the people who are in these conversations understand we have an immense talent on our hands and we want him to be playing for five to 10 years, so these are the decisions we are going to make in his best interests to set him up to have a long career.” Rogers said Pucovski could be ready for one of the later Tests in a “best-case scenario” as he returns to full fitness. “Of course he wants to play for Australia for a long time to come. There’s a strong desire to get him into that Australian side, he’s such a talented player,” he said. “I think the decision is to look after him and allow him a bit more time to prepare in the right time rather than rush him to matches which are going to have a lot of intensity and scrutiny.” Australia pulled off a T20 World Cup win few thought was possible for the side, but one call nearly derailed the entire effort.

The Aussie spinner has been celebrating hard following Australia’s historic T20 World Cup final win over New Zealand. Zampa, who was named in the official ICC team of the tournament, came for Vaughan on Instagram on Monday night after reminding the former English batter of a prediction that has left him with egg all over his face. Miss any of the epic T20 World Cup Final between Australia and New Zealand? Catch up with Kayo Minis. New to Kayo? Start your free trial today. Vaughan had made a scathing appraisal of Australia’s hopes of winning the World Cup as the team headed into the tournament on the back of a series of poor recent results in the shortest form of the game. They are words he has lived to regret. “I’ll say it now, I don’t give Australia much chance. In T20 cricket they’ve struggled. Glenn Maxwell’s exceptional so he will have to have an incredible tournament. But I don’t see the Aussies doing too much. England, India, West Indies, New Zealand, one of those four and maybe Pakistan because of the conditions,” Vaughan had said on BBC Test Match Special on October 19. Zampa is not about to let him get away with that. He posted a shot of the Aussie team celebrating inside their dressing room following the final in Dubai — and captioned it with the quote Vaughan made last month. Adam Zampa went savage.

Source: Instagram Vaughan was hardly the only high-profile commentator to put a line through Justin Langer’s team before the start of the tournament. Before their tournament opener against the Proteas, Australia’s T20 record was 15 losses from 21 matches since March 2020. The Australians, who had not qualified for a T20 World Cup semi-final since 2012 and were ranked No. 7 on the ICC T20 rankings. Needless to say, the odds were stacked against them. It’s what made the victory all the more sweet for the Aussie dressing room. David Warner also enjoyed sweet revenge after his stunning rebound to be named player of the tournament. The Aussie opener had been axed as captain and dropped from his Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL team earlier this year. Warner’s wife Candice had some choice words for his critics after the final, slapping down claims the cricketer’s best days were over. “Out of form!!” she tweeted with an embarrassed and laughing face emoji, alongside a graphic announcing Warner as player of the tournament. “Out of form, too old and slow!” she added in another post, with those same emojis. “Congratulations @davidwarner31.” Candice also posted a graphic to her Instagram story highlighting Warner’s last three innings — where he scored 188 runs — with a line that read: “Finished, they said.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Mitchell has earned the right to be in Ashes side: Healy","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/mitchell-has-earned-the-right-to-be-in-ashes-side-healy-563372","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australian great Ian Healy believes that Mitchell Marsh has earned his ticket to be in the squad for the Ashes series beginning at the Gabba on December 8, following his commanding performance in the ICC T20 World Cup, and especially in the final against New Zealand on Sunday night.","content":"SYDNEY: Australian great Ian Healy believes that Mitchell Marsh has earned his ticket to be in the squad for the Ashes series beginning at the Gabba on December 8, following his commanding performance in the ICC T20 World Cup, and especially in the final against New Zealand on Sunday night.Marsh, who was adjudged 'Player of the Match' in Australia's eight-wicket win over the Black Caps, bludgeoned the Kiwi bowling attack, scoring 77 off 50 deliveries to singlehandedly take the game away from their Trans-Tasman rivals. Marsh made 185 runs at an average of 62 in the UAE. Former Australian wicketkeeper-batter Healy feels Marsh could help remedy Australia's right-hander conundrum. \"I reckon he's right up there,\" Healy told SEN 1170 Breakfast on Monday. \"I'd have the number five spot in the Ashes for him, if he can get back and demonstrate any sort of red-ball ability and his form line continuing, I'm having him in. \"We need an extra right hander in there I reckon and he's the man.

However, another cricketing great and former Australia skipper Ian Chappell is more reserved in his assessment, saying that white-ball cricket was totally different from red-ball cricket. Chappell, however, said that Marsh should be considered. \"How to you extrapolate form in 20-over cricket into the longer form of the game?\" Chappell asked. \"Other players have had the Sheffield Shield in Australia to get some form and some runs on the board whereas Mitch hasn't had that opportunity. He's an experienced player and he's had success in Test cricket and particularly Ashes cricket before, so I think the selectors will consider it. \"They'll sit down and figure out what the best make-up of the team is, you mentioned Cameron Green, Mitch is an all-rounder or at least a batsman that can give you quality overs.

(@CricCrazyJohns) November 15, 2021 This is the first-ever T20I game on this ground, so this is a historical game for the city. In this current Indian setup, only Rohit Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar have played an International game here in Jaipur. Rohit Sharma enjoys batting here and he has scored 193 runs in a couple of ODI games. In the last ODI here in 2013, Rohit Sharma scored a century and India successfully chased 360 runs against Australia. In terms of the T20s, Jaipur is the host city of Rajasthan Royals. So, there have been quite a few IPL games on this ground in the past. A total of 46 IPL games have been played here, where 31 times the chasing team has won. Jaipur is currently shifting to the winter season, so the dew factor will play a part in this game. The average 1st innings score in IPL games here has been 157 runs. Ajinkya Rahane has scored the highest T20 runs on this ground, whereas Sidharth Trivedi has been the highest wicket-taker. The pitch of Jaipur always has a greenish tinge onto it, and the pacers move the ball very well in the initial overs. Jaipur’s outfield is one of the biggest in the world and hitting sixes will not be easy on this ground.   The post Jaipur cricket stadium T20 records: Who has scored most runs and picked most wickets in T20Is at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-11-16 04:00:58","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Cricket-India still strong despite big name absentees - NZ coach","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2021/11/16/cricket-india-still-strong-despite-big-name-absentees---nz-coach","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - New Zealand coach Gary Stead believes India will provide a major challenge on the upcoming test tour despite the absence of a few big names from their squad.

India skipper Virat Kohli has decided to skip the first of the two tests and batter Rohit Sharma, wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and fast bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami will miss the series. \"They're still very, very strong,\" Stead said from Dubai after the Twenty20 World Cup final. \"When you go to India you traditionally think of spin-friendly wickets and I still see (Ravindra) Jadeja, (Ravichandran) Ashwin and Axar Patel in their line up. \"They are obviously guys that have performed really, really well for them in the past three or four years.\" New Zealand will be looking to rebound from their loss to Australia in Sunday's World Cup final but their squad will also be without a few familiar faces. Seamer Trent Boult and all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme opted out of the tour because of the prospect of spending more time in bio-secure bubbles, while batsman Devon Conway broke his hand at the World Cup. Test regulars such as Ross Taylor, Tom Latham and Neil Wagner will return to the fold, however, as the Black Caps seek a first series triumph in India. \"We know it's going to be a big challenge there,\" Stead added. \"(But) we have some new guys, who will be nice and fresh, and maybe add a different dynamic to the squad.\" The series will include the first meeting between the countries in the longest format since New Zealand beat India to win the inaugural World Test Championship in June. \"It's our first chance ... to get out there and look at how we go about getting into the final again and defending what we won six or seven months ago,\" said Stead. The tour begins in Kapur on Nov. 25 with the second test starting in Mumbai on Dec. 3.

The caravan of ICC T20 World Cup 2021 is over and now the focus shifts on the Ashes 2021 for Australia and England. Australia won the T20 world cup, whereas England got knocked out in the semis. However, in an interesting set of events, both England and Australia shared a long flight from Dubai to Brisbane together. England were forced to wait till the world cup finals in order to travel to Australia. This must be a difficult flight for the English team, as their rivals are coming on the back of a successful world cup campaign. English pacer Mark Wood was also nervous about sharing the flight with the Australian team. He gave an interview about this prospect before the T20 World Cup finals. “I just can’t have them (Australia) win that game. It’s going to be unbearable,” Wood said. “You can look them in the eye and say congratulations to them but when you are about to head off to an Ashes series against them, the last thing you want is them feeling confident and waving a trophy around in your face before you’ve even got there.” Why do Australia and England share a flight ahead of Ashes 2021? The decision of sharing the flights was taken due to Quarantine protocols in Australia. Both teams were forced to travel in a charter together in order to complete a bubble to bubble transfer. Both sets of players will now undergo a short quarantine in Brisbane, before starting their training on the gold coast. “There is one bunch of cricketers who won’t be enjoying this, watching on, and that’s England’s Ashes players,” former England captain Mike Atherton said. “That could be an interesting plane journey.” England’s #T20WorldCup players who are also in their Ashes squad will be sharing a flight Down Under with Australia’s champions pic.twitter.com/Fel9TonrE1 — ESPNcricinfo (@ESPNcricinfo) November 15, 2021 However, Josh Hazlewood insisted that there won’t be any kind of awkwardness between both sets of players. “It will be fine, we’ve played a lot of cricket with them – county cricket and IPL,” Hazlewood said. “Everyone knows everyone, we all get on fine.” Both teams will face each other in the Ashes 2021 test on 8th December at the Gabba in Brisbane.   The post “That could be an interesting plane journey”: Why Australia and England shared flight from UAE to Brisbane ahead of Ashes 2021? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-11-16 03:17:05","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"T20 World Cup 2022: Tournament to kick off from October 16, check full schedule HERE","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/t20-world-cup-2022-tournament-to-kick-off-from-october-16-check-full-schedule-here-2410736.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The ICC men's T20 World Cup 2022 Final will be hosted under lights at the MCG on November 13, 2022.

Namibia, Scotland, Sri Lanka and West Indies will feature in the opening round along with four other teams to be decided at qualifying tournaments in Oman and Zimbabwe next year. Australia has never previously staged the men's Twenty20 World Cup but the MCG has twice been the venue of the 50-overs World Cup final, most recently in 2015 when the hosts thrashed New Zealand in front of 93,013 fans.

The Aussie spinner has been celebrating hard following Australia’s historic T20 World Cup final win over New Zealand. Zampa, who was named in the official ICC team of the tournament, came for Vaughan on Instagram on Monday night after reminding the former English batter of a prediction that has left him with egg all over his face. Miss any of the epic T20 World Cup Final between Australia and New Zealand? Catch up with Kayo Minis. New to Kayo? Start your free trial today. Vaughan had made a scathing appraisal of Australia’s hopes of winning the World Cup as the team headed into the tournament on the back of a series of poor recent results in the shortest form of the game. They are words he has lived to regret. “I’ll say it now, I don’t give Australia much chance. In T20 cricket they’ve struggled. Glenn Maxwell’s exceptional so he will have to have an incredible tournament. But I don’t see the Aussies doing too much. England, India, West Indies, New Zealand, one of those four and maybe Pakistan because of the conditions,” Vaughan had said on BBC Test Match Special on October 19. Zampa is not about to let him get away with that. He posted a shot of the Aussie team celebrating inside their dressing room following the final in Dubai — and captioned it with the quote Vaughan made last month. Vaughan was hardly the only high-profile commentator to put a line through Justin Langer’s team before the start of the tournament. Before their tournament opener against the Proteas, Australia’s T20 record was 15 losses from 21 matches since March 2020. The Australians, who had not qualified for a T20 World Cup semi-final since 2012 and were ranked No. 7 on the ICC T20 rankings. Needless to say, the odds were stacked against them. It’s what made the victory all the more sweet for the Aussie dressing room. David Warner also enjoyed sweet revenge after his stunning rebound to be named player of the tournament. The Aussie opener had been axed as captain and dropped from his Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL team earlier this year. Warner’s wife Candice had some choice words for his critics after the final, slapping down claims the cricketer’s best days were over. “Out of form!!” she tweeted with an embarrassed and laughing face emoji, alongside a graphic announcing Warner as player of the tournament. “Out of form, too old and slow!” she added in another post, with those same emojis. “Congratulations @davidwarner31.” Candice also posted a graphic to her Instagram story highlighting Warner’s last three innings — where he scored 188 runs — with a line that read: “Finished, they said.” New Zealand’s loss to Australia in the T20 World Cup final was their third silver medal in a row, and a Kiwi cricket legend has had enough. Former captain Michael Clarke predicts Justin Langer will drop a bombshell this summer and has called for a revolution to Australia’s coaching. Australia could be defending its T20 World Cup title at this iconic ground when the final of the 2022 tournament is played next November.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Post ruins cricket legend over World Cup slap","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/aussie-star-ruins-cricket-legend-over-world-cup-slight/news-story/d1b32a8f9c6cd425e7960982a59980ad","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Adam Zampa has singled out former England captain Michael Vaughan as Australian players continue to rub their World Cup triumph in the faces of their critics.","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-11-16 02:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"ICC T20 World Cup 2022 venues: List of venues for next T20 World Cup in 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-icc-t20-world-cup-2022-venues-list-of-venues-for-next-t20-world-cup-in-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia","ICC T20 World Cup 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"ICC T20 World Cup 2022 venues: International Cricket Council have confirmed seven venues for ICC T20 World Cup 2022.
