Нам нужно сосредоточиться на себе, цель ясна. Мы достаточно неплохо провели первую половину сезона и хотим выступить еще лучше. Думаю, 39 очков за первый круг — это не так уж плохо, но теперь нужно нажать на педаль газа», — приводит слова Пиоли Football Italia. Также 58-летний тренер считает, что «Милан» мог набрать больше очков в первой части сезона. «У нас остались серия А и Лига Европы, и мы можем сказать в этих турнирах свое слово», — сказал Пиоли. «Милан» на данный момент занимает третье место в турнирной таблице серии А, набрав 42 очка в 20 матчах. На первом месте находится «Интер» (51 очко), на втором — «Ювентус» (46).","pubDate":"2024-01-16 06:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"sport_express","source_url":"https://www.sport-express.ru","source_priority":81120,"country":["russia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"russian","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"05dcd55f458955d56a9a82a89cfa0a2d","title":"LIVE!

Centre-back Radebe would remain at Elland Road for 11 seasons, establishing himself as perhaps the fans’ most popular player at the club since the Revie era thanks to his performances on the pitch and nature off it. But it wasn’t all plain sailing, as the former South Africa skipper admits he had to overcome a ‘difficult’ transition period when he moved to England. “Apartheid was abolished once and for all in South Africa in ’94, and not long after the first mixed-race elections were held, myself and Phil Masinga moved to England to join Leeds,” Radebe told FourFourTwo. “I’d known beforehand that they were interested in signing me, but they actually travelled to South Africa to see Phil – on both occasions when their chief scout Geoff Sleight visited, I didn’t play due to injury. Great respect to Geoff and Howard Wilkinson, who took a chance on me and snapped me up without watching me play. Someone must have whispered a few positive things in their ear about me! “When I signed for Leeds, it was a difficult introduction to English football. The change of environment was a shock to my system. It was my first time travelling that far away from South Africa, leaving everybody I knew at home. It was hard to adapt to the weather and the football culture. “Games were very physical and the tempo was high. When I joined, I felt like Howard treated Phil and I harshly. Playing under him was particularly tough – I recall him saying, “This isn’t South Africa,” and ordering us to “work harder”. When Howard and his coach Mick Hennigan spoke, it could be quite scary. I wasn’t used to their management methods. “Early on at Leeds, I panicked and made mistakes in games. Phil and I both worked really hard, but he got into the team first. He played brilliantly, scored a hat-trick and the Leeds supporters came up with the nickname ‘Waltzing Masinga’ for him. I usually sat on the bench and would be ice-cold from head to toe. At some grounds, it was freezing and I couldn’t cope with it. “The training sessions were also challenging. At Kaizer Chiefs, we used to train from 4pm until 6pm for three days, then play a match. Leeds trained in the morning through to the afternoon every day, which was demanding. I had a pretty shaky first season. I damaged my knee ligaments and underwent a big ACL operation. When Phil returned home to South Africa during the summer, I stayed behind in Yorkshire to work with the club’s physios. When Wilkinson was sacked in September 1996, I’d recovered and was doing well.” From that point on Radebe’s Elland Road career took flight as he became a key part of the exciting Whites side that threatened to disrupt the Premier League pecking order at the turn of the century. Injuries would restrict Radebe’s playing time during the club’s thrilling European adventures, with the defender remaining loyal to the club and sticking with them after they were relegated to the Championship in 2004. He would hang up his boots at the end of the 2004-05 campaign.","pubDate":"2024-01-16 06:00:14","image_url":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4V8ozemvifKt4K9GMDAbzW.jpg","source_id":"fourfourtwo","source_url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com","source_priority":14446,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"792b5a78b7848305e525bacafce27252","title":"Erling Haaland’s Father Angry as Lionel Messi Wins Fifa The Best Award Over Man City Superstar and Kylian Mbappe","link":"https://insidexpress.com/sports-athletics/erling-haalands-father-angry-as-lionel-messi-wins-fifa-the-best-award-over-man-city-superstar-and-kylian-mbappe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=erling-haalands-father-angry-as-lionel-messi-wins-fifa-the-best-award-over-man-city-superstar-and-kylian-mbappe","keywords":["sports & athletics","angry","award","borussia dortmund","champions league","city","erling","erling haaland","father","fifa","haalands","kylian","kylian mbappe","lionel","lionel messi","man","manchester city","mbappe","messi","paris saint-germain","section: sport:football","section: sport:football:premier league","superstar","wins"],"creator":["The Insidexpress"],"video_url":null,"description":"ERLING HAALAND surprisingly missed out on Fifa’s The Best Men’s Player award to Lionel Messi – leaving his dad clenching his jaw.

Man City superstar Haaland missed out on Fifa’s The Best Men’s Player award Credit: Getty Lionel Messi beat Haaland to the award much to the surprise of many Credit: Reuters Haaaland’s father Alf-Inge looked furious by the outcome Credit: FS2 The star striker’s incredible performances saw him finishing as top scorer in the Premier League as well as the Champions League. However, Messi still beat the Norway international to the prestigious award, even though he now plays in the MLS for Inter Miami. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner also bested a prestigious list of candidates, including Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe. Haaland’s City team-mates Julian Alvarez, Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri and Bernardo Silva were also nominated. The list also included Marcelo Brozovic, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Victor Osimhen, Arsenal’s Declan Rice and Ilkay Gundogan, who played with the 23-year-old at the Etihad last season. And Haaland’s dad – ex-City ace Alf-Inge – couldn’t hide his frustration after the Argentina international was handed the award. The camera caught the former City ace looking stony faced with furrowed brow as other attendees applauded the Barcelona legend. And some football fans agree with the ex-Leeds star’s reaction in the capital. One supporter tweeted: “Feel bad for Haaland man. His dad was even p****d….” Another posted: “Haaland not winning a single award after winning all this has to be one the biggest robberies in football history.” A third said: “I’ll say it again. Haaland should be winning these awards. Messi is a legend but Haaland came to a new league, smashed its goal record, and won a Treble.” This fan wrote: “What more does Haaland have to do?” And that one wondered: “If Erling Haaland had won the World Cup with Norway in December 2022 while Messi won the treble, who would have won both the Ballon d’Or and The Best Awards?” It wasn’t the only controversial moment of the evening, either – after Pep Guardiola accidentally dropped an F-bomb after an awkward grilling from Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.

But he doesn’t have to look far for one character he believes will be like a new signing when the Scottish top flight kicks off again - one he is convinced is on course to make a huge impact. Hibees hitman Harry McKirdy’s return from career-saving heart surgery in the summer was almost a month ahead of schedule when the striker climbed off the bench for a cameo in the 2-2 draw with Motherwell a fortnight ago. Just watching his fellow Englishman fight back from being floored by the shock diagnosis has shown Montgomery what type of player he’s dealing with. More importantly it’s also sent the type of positive energy flowing through the rest of the squad that any new arrival would struggle to match. The 26-year-old’s first season in Leith might have misfired badly with the striker failing to hit the net once. But with a fresh start, a re-energised hunger to succeed and a new boss to impress, Montgomery is convinced Hibs fans are about to see the real Harry McKirdy.

He came on against Motherwell and the reception he got just warming up shows the great support we’ve got. Everyone understands he has been through a really tough time. “He has been training really hard. Mentally it’s been really tough for him. He’s a very fit player but when when you’re out for a long time It’s not easy to get back at a high intensity. Moving forward Harry can give us energy off the bench, an impact, we play a lot of teams that sit players behind the ball but Harry is the type of maverick player who can do something out of nothing and create a goal. “We will manage him day to day and not week to week because it’s important we look after him. He is pushing himself and his attitude is fantastic. Coming off the bench before the break gave him a big lift and he is champing at the bit to get back. Hopefully we can get him more minutes and continue to build him up without pushing him too far. “The squad have been great with him. He’s a really popular member of the group. He’s needed that support because at times people see him come off the bench against Motherwell but they don’t see the ups and downs he’s had. “He’s had a lot of them. I’ve had him in my office a lot of times, just putting my arm around him telling him to keep going and believe he can come back. “Everyone is just really happy for him. He’s a great kid and when you know someone has been through a real tough time like Harry, to see him back training and doing what he loves doing. “It’s not easy when you have an injury or an issue to sit at the side of the pitch. It’s what you want to do and it’s your job but if you can’t do it it does become really difficult. He’s a great kid and this will build resilience for him. “I’ve no doubt on the positive side it’ll make him a better person and appreciate football more. He’s desperate to show people what he’s got and probably prove people wrong as well. I don’t think after signing he really showed the impact he can but sometimes that can be the situation and environment. “But right now he feels a part of the group and he knows we love and we’re all desperate to see him get back to his full tilt.” (Image: SNS Group) McKirdy was one of four long-term absentees working feverishly in the background to get close to full fitness during the club’s winter training camp in Dubai. While Chris Cadden is still “six to eight weeks” away from a competitive return and Jake Doyle-Hayes and Adam Le Fondre are also a little way off despite returning to training, the hope for McKirdy is that he will be ready to play a part from the bench right away. Next up is Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth round clash at Forfar. And Montgomery said: “There have been a few times where I’ve had to pick him off the floor and chuck a bottle of water on his head. But Harry is all in and he gives everything. He chases everything and it’s obviously been warm weather and we’ve been training twice a day really hard so it’s been a massive effort for him. “We have managed him a little bit in a few of the sessions but he’s given us everything and he’s developing well. “The medical staff have been really good with him. “I think a lot of it is that emotional side and a bit of anxiety over the problem he had so we’re all pushing him and looking after him. If we do that then I’m confident Harry can really make an impact this season and start to show people what he’s about.” Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Scottish Cup away days at this time of year always send a shiver down spine - and not just because of the plunging temperatures. Hearts fans won’t need any reminding of the potential for a slip-up against lower league opposition when they head to take on Spartans this weekend after their embarrassment at Brora three years ago. There may be three divisions and 32 places between the sides but that counts for nothing if Steven Naismith ’s players come back from their winter break in the wrong frame of mind. The opportunity is there to create memories for a lifetime because Hearts should be looking to win the competition. I never got that lucky. But I’ve got plenty of memories from the Scottish Cup nonetheless. And just a few brushes with disaster. At Ayr we drew Lochee United at their wee ground in Dundee. Not a problem ... or so we thought. The first game was called off because the pitch was frozen solid, which wasn’t unusual. But when it got called off for a FIFTH time it became a major headache because it kept taking priority over the league games which meant we had gone three weeks without a match. Read More Related Articles Transfer news LIVE as Celtic and Rangers plus Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs eye signings Read More Related Articles Inside the Harry McKirdy Hibs fightback as Nick Montgomery hypes up 'maverick impact' to win over Easter Road Even then it had to go ahead on a Wednesday lunch time because they had no floodlights. The final call-off came on the Monday afternoon and we tried to get the game switched but the SFA booted that idea into touch. So we trailed ourselves up to Dundee on the Wednesday morning, missing a host of our part-time players because they’d rescheduled their shifts at work once too many times for a game that kept getting called off. When we arrived there was a tractor going up and down the pitch scraping the snow and ice off the surface. I remember being tackled more than once by the huge tread marks on the wing! And after all that we drew 1-1 and had to go back to Somerset to play them anyway! Thankfully we dealt with them back in Ayr a few days later. Two years on Ayr were on the road again, this time to Deveronvale from the Highland League. We won 1-0 and I scored the winner late in the game but it was horrible, they had floodlights that were little better than street lights. My best memory from that one was Mark Roberts being stretchered off after five minutes when their centre half - who was carrying a bit to put it politely - sat on him! But again we found a way to get through the tie and we’d bust the chairman’s nut about getting a good bevvy in on the bus home if we won. It wasn’t all protein shakes back then! He held up his side of the bargain and by the time we got back to our Crowwood Hotel meeting point near Cumbernauld everyone fell off the bus steaming. The boss, Brian Reid, warned us not to kick the a**e out of it but on a 200 mile bus journey he had no chance. But it’s all great memories and Hearts have to make sure they create their own in this year’s competition starting at with the short trip across Edinburgh on Saturday. This will be one of Spartans biggest ever games if not THE biggest. Which makes Dougie Samuels’ team dangerous. It’s an artificial pitch, the crowd will be small but right on top of them, Spartans will be defending for their lives and it will no doubt be freezing. It’s not going to be for the feint hearted. I’m sure Naisy will be on high alert. This is not the game you want to ruin the good form and momentum they were on before the break. The cups are huge for Hearts. The fans will be dreaming of winning a piece of silverware and it all starts here. It’s about mindset. Treat the game with the respect it deserves and they should be fine. Whether Dexter Lembikisa is given a debut at Ainslie Park remains to be seen but if does then hopefully he isn’t caught cold. The Wolves right back arrives with some decent write-ups from his time on loan at Rotherham. Hearts will have done their homework on him and they were badly needing someone in that area of the pitch. With another signing or two then Hearts will be in good shape to go on and finish third and have a real crack at the cup. Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Celtic's ice man Odin Thiago Holm has been stuck in cold storage in recent weeks. But former rival Patrick Berg reckons the Norwegian will still be Parkhead hot property like old pal Stefan Johansen. Holm arrived in a £2million summer move from Valerenga and was pitched straight into the side amid an early injury crisis for Brendan Rodgers . His red mist moment against Feyenoord in the Champions League was a setback but the playmaker has still made a solid impression that suggests the Hoops have got one for the future. Berg has no doubts. He watched his buddy Johansen sign for Celts 10 years ago this week, becoming a major star at Parkhead before earning a move to Premier League Fulham and carving out a successful career in England and captaining his country. The Bodo-Glimt ace believes Holm can do the same having kept a close eye on the kid since his breakthrough as a teenager in his homeland. Holm – who turns 21 on Thursday – was hailed as one of the best prospects in Norway when he exploded onto the scene at just 16. Read More Related Articles Brendan Rodgers' next Celtic transfer priority revealed as Nicolas Kuhn deal faces final hurdle before unveiling Read More Related Articles Transfer news LIVE as Celtic and Rangers plus Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs eye signings He was a mainstay in the Tippeligaen with Valerenga – and squared up with Berg just a fortnight before he made the switch to Celts. The Norway international said: “I would say Odin is a good investment and he’ll be worth a lot of money in the future “That’s the thing about these Norwegian talents. They are not so expensive if you pick them up early. But let’s just say Odin has a couple of good seasons for Celtic, I’ve got no doubt they will be able to sell him on for a lot more. “It’s like my good friend Stefan. It was a similar situation as Celtic got him relatively cheaply, he did well for the club and they eventually sold him on to Fulham, where he did very well. I’m sure Odin could do the same. Although if he chooses to stay a long time I am sure that would be good as well, as Celtic are a great club.” Berg – who is in his second spell with Euro shock troops Bodo – watched Holm up close and recognised his ability from the off. He said: “I played against him a lot of times when he was young in Norway. We could see early on he was an exceptional talent. He broke on to the scene really young. He grew up in Trondheim which has Rosenborg, one of the biggest teams in Norway, but he chose to move to a different club to make his way. “He did very well there and it was always going to be a matter of time before a big club picked him up. I was really happy for him to get the move to Celtic – it’s a massive club.” Berg was on a short stint at Lens when Celts crashed out of the Europa Conference League against Bodo two years ago but he watched plenty of the Hoops when Johansen was in town. He knows what it takes to succeed in Scotland and he’s convinced Holm has the big time attitude to thrive and become a major star for club and country. Berg – part of the Norway side Scotland pipped to the Euros – said: “I didn’t play in the game against Celtic but I know how big they are. Odin will be able to handle it. He’s like a lot of young Norwegian players who are coming up right now – they almost enjoy the pressure. “The relish the big occasions. He’s one of them. He’s part of a really strong under 21 side, who I think will do very well in the near future. “Norwegian football is moving in a good direction and players like Odin are going to be a huge part of the future. “We’ve seen guys like Erling Harling and Martin Odegaard, and now you have Oscar Bobb at Manchester City. The big clubs are looking to Norway to pick up young talents now and it’s exciting for the national team. “The future looks good and guys like Odin are going to play a big role. We have not qualified for a major tournament for a while but with these players it’s only a matter of time before we make it. “It’s been hard for us in recent years. We feel like we’ve been at the same level as Scotland but they were the better team in the campaign, so we have to wish them all the best.” The Norway team is down in the dumps but Berg’s Bodo outfit have been European sensations. Kjetil Knutsen’s Arctic Circle side have reached the knockout stages of the Europa Conference again this season having got to the last 16 in the completion the year they dumped Celts, beating Jose Mourinho’s Roma in the group stages. Scottish teams should take note. Berg said: “It’s just a matter of mentality, and having a group, players and staff, who are all thinking the same way and pulling in the same direction. As a Norwegian club, we know we will never have the best players – but we can have the best team. That is our mentality. It was the same in the recent games with Besiktas.

Name the then Manchester United youngster who made way for Ryan Giggs as the Premier League legend stepped off the bench to make his last ever appearance for the Red Devils? Almost 10 years have passed since the Welshman claimed his little place in United history, being replaced by his fellow countryman 70 minutes into his sole senior appearance in a red shirt. Now he’s wearing blue at Ibrox but there’s still questions to be addressed - chiefly, when can the Rangers support expect to see him back in action on a consistent basis. It’s one Lawrence has had to face before and, frankly, he’s sick of it. But not as sick of the repeated injury set-backs that have blighted his 18-months in Glasgow. Last season was written off after just a month after signing from Derby.

But having rejoined Philippe Clement’s Gers in Spain for this week’s training camp, Lawrence - who turned 30 this week - hopes this is the last time he’ll have to face a quizzing on his readiness to perform. “It’s all good, he said. “It was good to get out to Spain and get some training done. I’m just looking forward now. “I’m back training with the team, I’m injury free at the minute. I’m sick of talking about it to be honest. I'm sick of being injured, I just want to get fit and hopefully I can do that. “It was a massive couple months when the gaffer first arrived. I played my part when I was fit so I know what I need to do and I know what to expect.” Lawrence had barely started primary school when he joined United. His footballing education at Old Trafford took place at a time when the Class of 92 were on the books. He himself graduated into the first-team in May 2014 as he was given his debut by Giggs in a win over Hull. Trivia geeks will remember that Giggs was acting as player-manager at the time he chose to take off the young Lawrence and throw himself on for his 963rd and final Man United run-out. But the fact the 13-time Premier League winner was even required to double up in a caretaker capacity was an early sign of the troubles that have plagued the club ever since. The United Way has lost its bearings since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson but for Lawrence, the strict lessons he learned from some of the game’s biggest names have stuck with him - and are the ones he’s now trying to pass on to the young students at Ibrox. Ryan Giggs replaces Tom Lawrence for his final man Utd appearance Looking back on his first-team debut, Lawrence said: “I started the game and Ryan came on for me. “It was his last ever game for Manchester United as he was player/manager at the time. I played 70 minutes and then he came on. “He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I’ll be forever grateful. “I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. You looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Giggs and Paul Scholes. “Coaching-wise, Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively. I’m really thankful to them all. “There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age. “That’s what I try to do at Rangers, I try to bring standards the best I can. Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn’t mess up. “That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It’s instilled in you. “It’s a lot different now but when the younger players do come up to train with us, you try and give them as much confidence as you can.” Fergie Time was over by the time Lawrence made it to the first team under Giggs but the iconic Scot still had an influence over his career. He gave me my first professional contract,” he revealed. “I didn’t actually play under him in the first team because he left the season before. “But he knew everything about everyone. He’d pull you in for a chat in his office and he’d know everything. Tom Lawrence “He was quite an insight. You didn’t want to be uneasy around him because that’s not how he wants you to be. You just knew if you put a foot wrong he’d find out.” Lawrence now hopes he can help Rangers take a step in the right direction as Clement’s team gears up for a huge second half to the season. The title race will still be very much alive if the Ibrox side can win their two games in hand to cut Celtic’s lead back to two points, while the Viaplay Cup winners will be eyeing further prizes in the Europa League and Scottish Cup. “There’s a lot of excitement ahead of the second half of the season,” he said. “I can’t wait to get back out on that pitch playing, I think it will be very special. “We’ve become a lot closer as a squad. We had a lot of new faces in the summer. It always takes a bit of time but we’ve got a strong team bond now and hopefully that shows in the second half of the season.” Lawrence wasn’t quite ready to take part in the team’s La Manga kick-about with Hertha Berlin on Saturday but he’s hoping to play a part in tonight’s friendly clash with Copenhagen. He added: “These games are crucial after a break. “I’ve not played for five weeks so I just want to play as many games as I can to get my fitness back to that peak level.” Lawrence was speaking to promote Rangers’ friendly with Copenhagen at Ibrox on Tuesday.

Centre-back Radebe would remain at Elland Road for 11 seasons, establishing himself as perhaps the fans’ most popular player at the club since the Revie era thanks to his performances on the pitch and nature off it. But it wasn’t all plain sailing, as the former South Africa skipper admits he had to overcome a ‘difficult’ transition period when he moved to England. “Apartheid was abolished once and for all in South Africa in ’94, and not long after the first mixed-race elections were held, myself and Phil Masinga moved to England to join Leeds,” Radebe told FourFourTwo. “I’d known beforehand that they were interested in signing me, but they actually travelled to South Africa to see Phil – on both occasions when their chief scout Geoff Sleight visited, I didn’t play due to injury. Great respect to Geoff and Howard Wilkinson, who took a chance on me and snapped me up without watching me play. Someone must have whispered a few positive things in their ear about me! “When I signed for Leeds, it was a difficult introduction to English football. The change of environment was a shock to my system. It was my first time travelling that far away from South Africa, leaving everybody I knew at home. It was hard to adapt to the weather and the football culture. “Games were very physical and the tempo was high. When I joined, I felt like Howard treated Phil and I harshly. Playing under him was particularly tough – I recall him saying, “This isn’t South Africa,” and ordering us to “work harder”. When Howard and his coach Mick Hennigan spoke, it could be quite scary. I wasn’t used to their management methods. “Early on at Leeds, I panicked and made mistakes in games. Phil and I both worked really hard, but he got into the team first. He played brilliantly, scored a hat-trick and the Leeds supporters came up with the nickname ‘Waltzing Masinga’ for him. I usually sat on the bench and would be ice-cold from head to toe. At some grounds, it was freezing and I couldn’t cope with it. “The training sessions were also challenging. At Kaizer Chiefs, we used to train from 4pm until 6pm for three days, then play a match. Leeds trained in the morning through to the afternoon every day, which was demanding. I had a pretty shaky first season. I damaged my knee ligaments and underwent a big ACL operation. When Phil returned home to South Africa during the summer, I stayed behind in Yorkshire to work with the club’s physios. When Wilkinson was sacked in September 1996, I’d recovered and was doing well.” From that point on Radebe’s Elland Road career took flight as he became a key part of the exciting Whites side that threatened to disrupt the Premier League pecking order at the turn of the century. Injuries would restrict Radebe’s playing time during the club’s thrilling European adventures, with the defender remaining loyal to the club and sticking with them after they were relegated to the Championship in 2004. He would hang up his boots at the end of the 2004-05 campaign.","pubDate":"2024-01-16 06:00:14","image_url":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4V8ozemvifKt4K9GMDAbzW.jpg","source_id":"fourfourtwo","source_url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com","source_priority":14446,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"792b5a78b7848305e525bacafce27252","title":"Erling Haaland’s Father Angry as Lionel Messi Wins Fifa The Best Award Over Man City Superstar and Kylian Mbappe","link":"https://insidexpress.com/sports-athletics/erling-haalands-father-angry-as-lionel-messi-wins-fifa-the-best-award-over-man-city-superstar-and-kylian-mbappe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=erling-haalands-father-angry-as-lionel-messi-wins-fifa-the-best-award-over-man-city-superstar-and-kylian-mbappe","keywords":["sports & athletics","angry","award","borussia dortmund","champions league","city","erling","erling haaland","father","fifa","haalands","kylian","kylian mbappe","lionel","lionel messi","man","manchester city","mbappe","messi","paris saint-germain","section: sport:football","section: sport:football:premier league","superstar","wins"],"creator":["The Insidexpress"],"video_url":null,"description":"ERLING HAALAND surprisingly missed out on Fifa’s The Best Men’s Player award to Lionel Messi – leaving his dad clenching his jaw.

Man City superstar Haaland missed out on Fifa’s The Best Men’s Player award Credit: Getty Lionel Messi beat Haaland to the award much to the surprise of many Credit: Reuters Haaaland’s father Alf-Inge looked furious by the outcome Credit: FS2 The star striker’s incredible performances saw him finishing as top scorer in the Premier League as well as the Champions League. However, Messi still beat the Norway international to the prestigious award, even though he now plays in the MLS for Inter Miami. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner also bested a prestigious list of candidates, including Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe. Haaland’s City team-mates Julian Alvarez, Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri and Bernardo Silva were also nominated. The list also included Marcelo Brozovic, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Victor Osimhen, Arsenal’s Declan Rice and Ilkay Gundogan, who played with the 23-year-old at the Etihad last season. And Haaland’s dad – ex-City ace Alf-Inge – couldn’t hide his frustration after the Argentina international was handed the award. The camera caught the former City ace looking stony faced with furrowed brow as other attendees applauded the Barcelona legend. And some football fans agree with the ex-Leeds star’s reaction in the capital. One supporter tweeted: “Feel bad for Haaland man. His dad was even p****d….” Another posted: “Haaland not winning a single award after winning all this has to be one the biggest robberies in football history.” A third said: “I’ll say it again. Haaland should be winning these awards. Messi is a legend but Haaland came to a new league, smashed its goal record, and won a Treble.” This fan wrote: “What more does Haaland have to do?” And that one wondered: “If Erling Haaland had won the World Cup with Norway in December 2022 while Messi won the treble, who would have won both the Ballon d’Or and The Best Awards?” It wasn’t the only controversial moment of the evening, either – after Pep Guardiola accidentally dropped an F-bomb after an awkward grilling from Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.

But he doesn’t have to look far for one character he believes will be like a new signing when the Scottish top flight kicks off again - one he is convinced is on course to make a huge impact. Hibees hitman Harry McKirdy’s return from career-saving heart surgery in the summer was almost a month ahead of schedule when the striker climbed off the bench for a cameo in the 2-2 draw with Motherwell a fortnight ago. Just watching his fellow Englishman fight back from being floored by the shock diagnosis has shown Montgomery what type of player he’s dealing with. More importantly it’s also sent the type of positive energy flowing through the rest of the squad that any new arrival would struggle to match. The 26-year-old’s first season in Leith might have misfired badly with the striker failing to hit the net once. But with a fresh start, a re-energised hunger to succeed and a new boss to impress, Montgomery is convinced Hibs fans are about to see the real Harry McKirdy.

Moving forward Harry can give us energy off the bench, an impact, we play a lot of teams that sit players behind the ball but Harry is the type of maverick player who can do something out of nothing and create a goal. “We will manage him day to day and not week to week because it’s important we look after him. He is pushing himself and his attitude is fantastic. Coming off the bench before the break gave him a big lift and he is champing at the bit to get back. Hopefully we can get him more minutes and continue to build him up without pushing him too far. “The squad have been great with him. He’s a really popular member of the group. He’s needed that support because at times people see him come off the bench against Motherwell but they don’t see the ups and downs he’s had. “He’s had a lot of them. I’ve had him in my office a lot of times, just putting my arm around him telling him to keep going and believe he can come back. “Everyone is just really happy for him. He’s a great kid and when you know someone has been through a real tough time like Harry, to see him back training and doing what he loves doing. “It’s not easy when you have an injury or an issue to sit at the side of the pitch. It’s what you want to do and it’s your job but if you can’t do it it does become really difficult. He’s a great kid and this will build resilience for him. “I’ve no doubt on the positive side it’ll make him a better person and appreciate football more. He’s desperate to show people what he’s got and probably prove people wrong as well. I don’t think after signing he really showed the impact he can but sometimes that can be the situation and environment. “But right now he feels a part of the group and he knows we love and we’re all desperate to see him get back to his full tilt.” (Image: SNS Group) McKirdy was one of four long-term absentees working feverishly in the background to get close to full fitness during the club’s winter training camp in Dubai. While Chris Cadden is still “six to eight weeks” away from a competitive return and Jake Doyle-Hayes and Adam Le Fondre are also a little way off despite returning to training, the hope for McKirdy is that he will be ready to play a part from the bench right away. Next up is Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth round clash at Forfar. And Montgomery said: “There have been a few times where I’ve had to pick him off the floor and chuck a bottle of water on his head. But Harry is all in and he gives everything. He chases everything and it’s obviously been warm weather and we’ve been training twice a day really hard so it’s been a massive effort for him. “We have managed him a little bit in a few of the sessions but he’s given us everything and he’s developing well. “The medical staff have been really good with him. “I think a lot of it is that emotional side and a bit of anxiety over the problem he had so we’re all pushing him and looking after him. If we do that then I’m confident Harry can really make an impact this season and start to show people what he’s about.” Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

Hearts fans won’t need any reminding of the potential for a slip-up against lower league opposition when they head to take on Spartans this weekend after their embarrassment at Brora three years ago. There may be three divisions and 32 places between the sides but that counts for nothing if Steven Naismith ’s players come back from their winter break in the wrong frame of mind. The opportunity is there to create memories for a lifetime because Hearts should be looking to win the competition. I never got that lucky. But I’ve got plenty of memories from the Scottish Cup nonetheless. And just a few brushes with disaster. At Ayr we drew Lochee United at their wee ground in Dundee. Not a problem ... or so we thought. The first game was called off because the pitch was frozen solid, which wasn’t unusual. But when it got called off for a FIFTH time it became a major headache because it kept taking priority over the league games which meant we had gone three weeks without a match.

The final call-off came on the Monday afternoon and we tried to get the game switched but the SFA booted that idea into touch. So we trailed ourselves up to Dundee on the Wednesday morning, missing a host of our part-time players because they’d rescheduled their shifts at work once too many times for a game that kept getting called off. When we arrived there was a tractor going up and down the pitch scraping the snow and ice off the surface. I remember being tackled more than once by the huge tread marks on the wing! And after all that we drew 1-1 and had to go back to Somerset to play them anyway! Thankfully we dealt with them back in Ayr a few days later. Two years on Ayr were on the road again, this time to Deveronvale from the Highland League. We won 1-0 and I scored the winner late in the game but it was horrible, they had floodlights that were little better than street lights. My best memory from that one was Mark Roberts being stretchered off after five minutes when their centre half - who was carrying a bit to put it politely - sat on him! But again we found a way to get through the tie and we’d bust the chairman’s nut about getting a good bevvy in on the bus home if we won. It wasn’t all protein shakes back then! He held up his side of the bargain and by the time we got back to our Crowwood Hotel meeting point near Cumbernauld everyone fell off the bus steaming. The boss, Brian Reid, warned us not to kick the a**e out of it but on a 200 mile bus journey he had no chance. But it’s all great memories and Hearts have to make sure they create their own in this year’s competition starting at with the short trip across Edinburgh on Saturday. This will be one of Spartans biggest ever games if not THE biggest. Which makes Dougie Samuels’ team dangerous. It’s an artificial pitch, the crowd will be small but right on top of them, Spartans will be defending for their lives and it will no doubt be freezing. It’s not going to be for the feint hearted. I’m sure Naisy will be on high alert. This is not the game you want to ruin the good form and momentum they were on before the break. The cups are huge for Hearts. The fans will be dreaming of winning a piece of silverware and it all starts here. It’s about mindset. Treat the game with the respect it deserves and they should be fine. Whether Dexter Lembikisa is given a debut at Ainslie Park remains to be seen but if does then hopefully he isn’t caught cold. The Wolves right back arrives with some decent write-ups from his time on loan at Rotherham. Hearts will have done their homework on him and they were badly needing someone in that area of the pitch. With another signing or two then Hearts will be in good shape to go on and finish third and have a real crack at the cup. Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Celtic's ice man Odin Thiago Holm has been stuck in cold storage in recent weeks. But former rival Patrick Berg reckons the Norwegian will still be Parkhead hot property like old pal Stefan Johansen. Holm arrived in a £2million summer move from Valerenga and was pitched straight into the side amid an early injury crisis for Brendan Rodgers . His red mist moment against Feyenoord in the Champions League was a setback but the playmaker has still made a solid impression that suggests the Hoops have got one for the future. Berg has no doubts. He watched his buddy Johansen sign for Celts 10 years ago this week, becoming a major star at Parkhead before earning a move to Premier League Fulham and carving out a successful career in England and captaining his country. The Bodo-Glimt ace believes Holm can do the same having kept a close eye on the kid since his breakthrough as a teenager in his homeland. Holm – who turns 21 on Thursday – was hailed as one of the best prospects in Norway when he exploded onto the scene at just 16. Read More Related Articles Brendan Rodgers' next Celtic transfer priority revealed as Nicolas Kuhn deal faces final hurdle before unveiling Read More Related Articles Transfer news LIVE as Celtic and Rangers plus Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs eye signings He was a mainstay in the Tippeligaen with Valerenga – and squared up with Berg just a fortnight before he made the switch to Celts. The Norway international said: “I would say Odin is a good investment and he’ll be worth a lot of money in the future “That’s the thing about these Norwegian talents. They are not so expensive if you pick them up early. But let’s just say Odin has a couple of good seasons for Celtic, I’ve got no doubt they will be able to sell him on for a lot more. “It’s like my good friend Stefan. It was a similar situation as Celtic got him relatively cheaply, he did well for the club and they eventually sold him on to Fulham, where he did very well. I’m sure Odin could do the same. Although if he chooses to stay a long time I am sure that would be good as well, as Celtic are a great club.” Berg – who is in his second spell with Euro shock troops Bodo – watched Holm up close and recognised his ability from the off. He said: “I played against him a lot of times when he was young in Norway. We could see early on he was an exceptional talent. He broke on to the scene really young. He grew up in Trondheim which has Rosenborg, one of the biggest teams in Norway, but he chose to move to a different club to make his way. “He did very well there and it was always going to be a matter of time before a big club picked him up. I was really happy for him to get the move to Celtic – it’s a massive club.” Berg was on a short stint at Lens when Celts crashed out of the Europa Conference League against Bodo two years ago but he watched plenty of the Hoops when Johansen was in town. He knows what it takes to succeed in Scotland and he’s convinced Holm has the big time attitude to thrive and become a major star for club and country. Berg – part of the Norway side Scotland pipped to the Euros – said: “I didn’t play in the game against Celtic but I know how big they are. Odin will be able to handle it. He’s like a lot of young Norwegian players who are coming up right now – they almost enjoy the pressure. “The relish the big occasions. He’s one of them. He’s part of a really strong under 21 side, who I think will do very well in the near future. “Norwegian football is moving in a good direction and players like Odin are going to be a huge part of the future. “We’ve seen guys like Erling Harling and Martin Odegaard, and now you have Oscar Bobb at Manchester City. The big clubs are looking to Norway to pick up young talents now and it’s exciting for the national team. “The future looks good and guys like Odin are going to play a big role. We have not qualified for a major tournament for a while but with these players it’s only a matter of time before we make it. “It’s been hard for us in recent years. We feel like we’ve been at the same level as Scotland but they were the better team in the campaign, so we have to wish them all the best.” The Norway team is down in the dumps but Berg’s Bodo outfit have been European sensations. Kjetil Knutsen’s Arctic Circle side have reached the knockout stages of the Europa Conference again this season having got to the last 16 in the completion the year they dumped Celts, beating Jose Mourinho’s Roma in the group stages. Scottish teams should take note. Berg said: “It’s just a matter of mentality, and having a group, players and staff, who are all thinking the same way and pulling in the same direction. As a Norwegian club, we know we will never have the best players – but we can have the best team. That is our mentality. It was the same in the recent games with Besiktas. We beat them in both games because we were the better team. “They were 11 individuals but we were one team unit. Everyone wants to run and fight for each other. It’s important to have a clear plan throughout the club.” Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice At Old Trafford, Tom Lawrence is best remembered as the answer to a pub quiz teaser. Name the then Manchester United youngster who made way for Ryan Giggs as the Premier League legend stepped off the bench to make his last ever appearance for the Red Devils? Almost 10 years have passed since the Welshman claimed his little place in United history, being replaced by his fellow countryman 70 minutes into his sole senior appearance in a red shirt. Now he’s wearing blue at Ibrox but there’s still questions to be addressed - chiefly, when can the Rangers support expect to see him back in action on a consistent basis. It’s one Lawrence has had to face before and, frankly, he’s sick of it. But not as sick of the repeated injury set-backs that have blighted his 18-months in Glasgow. Last season was written off after just a month after signing from Derby.

But having rejoined Philippe Clement’s Gers in Spain for this week’s training camp, Lawrence - who turned 30 this week - hopes this is the last time he’ll have to face a quizzing on his readiness to perform. “It’s all good, he said. “It was good to get out to Spain and get some training done. I’m just looking forward now. “I’m back training with the team, I’m injury free at the minute. I’m sick of talking about it to be honest. I'm sick of being injured, I just want to get fit and hopefully I can do that. “It was a massive couple months when the gaffer first arrived. I played my part when I was fit so I know what I need to do and I know what to expect.” Lawrence had barely started primary school when he joined United. His footballing education at Old Trafford took place at a time when the Class of 92 were on the books. He himself graduated into the first-team in May 2014 as he was given his debut by Giggs in a win over Hull. Trivia geeks will remember that Giggs was acting as player-manager at the time he chose to take off the young Lawrence and throw himself on for his 963rd and final Man United run-out. But the fact the 13-time Premier League winner was even required to double up in a caretaker capacity was an early sign of the troubles that have plagued the club ever since. The United Way has lost its bearings since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson but for Lawrence, the strict lessons he learned from some of the game’s biggest names have stuck with him - and are the ones he’s now trying to pass on to the young students at Ibrox. Ryan Giggs replaces Tom Lawrence for his final man Utd appearance Looking back on his first-team debut, Lawrence said: “I started the game and Ryan came on for me. “It was his last ever game for Manchester United as he was player/manager at the time. I played 70 minutes and then he came on. “He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I’ll be forever grateful. “I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. You looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Giggs and Paul Scholes. “Coaching-wise, Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively. I’m really thankful to them all. “There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age. “That’s what I try to do at Rangers, I try to bring standards the best I can. Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn’t mess up. “That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It’s instilled in you. “It’s a lot different now but when the younger players do come up to train with us, you try and give them as much confidence as you can.” Fergie Time was over by the time Lawrence made it to the first team under Giggs but the iconic Scot still had an influence over his career. He gave me my first professional contract,” he revealed. “I didn’t actually play under him in the first team because he left the season before. “But he knew everything about everyone. He’d pull you in for a chat in his office and he’d know everything. Tom Lawrence “He was quite an insight. You didn’t want to be uneasy around him because that’s not how he wants you to be. You just knew if you put a foot wrong he’d find out.” Lawrence now hopes he can help Rangers take a step in the right direction as Clement’s team gears up for a huge second half to the season. The title race will still be very much alive if the Ibrox side can win their two games in hand to cut Celtic’s lead back to two points, while the Viaplay Cup winners will be eyeing further prizes in the Europa League and Scottish Cup. “There’s a lot of excitement ahead of the second half of the season,” he said. “I can’t wait to get back out on that pitch playing, I think it will be very special. “We’ve become a lot closer as a squad. We had a lot of new faces in the summer. It always takes a bit of time but we’ve got a strong team bond now and hopefully that shows in the second half of the season.” Lawrence wasn’t quite ready to take part in the team’s La Manga kick-about with Hertha Berlin on Saturday but he’s hoping to play a part in tonight’s friendly clash with Copenhagen. He added: “These games are crucial after a break. “I’ve not played for five weeks so I just want to play as many games as I can to get my fitness back to that peak level.” Lawrence was speaking to promote Rangers’ friendly with Copenhagen at Ibrox on Tuesday.

Le crack argentin avait plusieurs prétendants à ses pieds, dont le PSG il y a quelques semaines. Mais finalement, Claudio Echeverri va rejoindre Manchester City . La pépite de River Plate aurait donné son feu vert à l’équipe de Pep Guardiola . Le PSG aurait ainsi raté un véritable phénomène. « C'est un prodige, un croisement entre Maradona et Messi. C'est un joueur totalement différent des autres. Quand je l'ai vu bouger, je me suis excité dès le premier contrôle orienté, parce que je savais que j'avais trouvé un autre type de footballeur.

Centre-back Radebe would remain at Elland Road for 11 seasons, establishing himself as perhaps the fans’ most popular player at the club since the Revie era thanks to his performances on the pitch and nature off it. But it wasn’t all plain sailing, as the former South Africa skipper admits he had to overcome a ‘difficult’ transition period when he moved to England. “Apartheid was abolished once and for all in South Africa in ’94, and not long after the first mixed-race elections were held, myself and Phil Masinga moved to England to join Leeds,” Radebe told FourFourTwo. “I’d known beforehand that they were interested in signing me, but they actually travelled to South Africa to see Phil – on both occasions when their chief scout Geoff Sleight visited, I didn’t play due to injury. Great respect to Geoff and Howard Wilkinson, who took a chance on me and snapped me up without watching me play. Someone must have whispered a few positive things in their ear about me! “When I signed for Leeds, it was a difficult introduction to English football. The change of environment was a shock to my system. It was my first time travelling that far away from South Africa, leaving everybody I knew at home. It was hard to adapt to the weather and the football culture. “Games were very physical and the tempo was high. When I joined, I felt like Howard treated Phil and I harshly. Playing under him was particularly tough – I recall him saying, “This isn’t South Africa,” and ordering us to “work harder”. When Howard and his coach Mick Hennigan spoke, it could be quite scary. I wasn’t used to their management methods. “Early on at Leeds, I panicked and made mistakes in games. Phil and I both worked really hard, but he got into the team first. He played brilliantly, scored a hat-trick and the Leeds supporters came up with the nickname ‘Waltzing Masinga’ for him. I usually sat on the bench and would be ice-cold from head to toe. At some grounds, it was freezing and I couldn’t cope with it. “The training sessions were also challenging. At Kaizer Chiefs, we used to train from 4pm until 6pm for three days, then play a match. Leeds trained in the morning through to the afternoon every day, which was demanding. I had a pretty shaky first season. I damaged my knee ligaments and underwent a big ACL operation. When Phil returned home to South Africa during the summer, I stayed behind in Yorkshire to work with the club’s physios. When Wilkinson was sacked in September 1996, I’d recovered and was doing well.” From that point on Radebe’s Elland Road career took flight as he became a key part of the exciting Whites side that threatened to disrupt the Premier League pecking order at the turn of the century. Injuries would restrict Radebe’s playing time during the club’s thrilling European adventures, with the defender remaining loyal to the club and sticking with them after they were relegated to the Championship in 2004. He would hang up his boots at the end of the 2004-05 campaign.","pubDate":"2024-01-16 06:00:14","image_url":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4V8ozemvifKt4K9GMDAbzW.jpg","source_id":"fourfourtwo","source_url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com","source_priority":14446,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"792b5a78b7848305e525bacafce27252","title":"Erling Haaland’s Father Angry as Lionel Messi Wins Fifa The Best Award Over Man City Superstar and Kylian Mbappe","link":"https://insidexpress.com/sports-athletics/erling-haalands-father-angry-as-lionel-messi-wins-fifa-the-best-award-over-man-city-superstar-and-kylian-mbappe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=erling-haalands-father-angry-as-lionel-messi-wins-fifa-the-best-award-over-man-city-superstar-and-kylian-mbappe","keywords":["sports & athletics","angry","award","borussia dortmund","champions league","city","erling","erling haaland","father","fifa","haalands","kylian","kylian mbappe","lionel","lionel messi","man","manchester city","mbappe","messi","paris saint-germain","section: sport:football","section: sport:football:premier league","superstar","wins"],"creator":["The Insidexpress"],"video_url":null,"description":"ERLING HAALAND surprisingly missed out on Fifa’s The Best Men’s Player award to Lionel Messi – leaving his dad clenching his jaw.

However, Messi still beat the Norway international to the prestigious award, even though he now plays in the MLS for Inter Miami. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner also bested a prestigious list of candidates, including Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe. Haaland’s City team-mates Julian Alvarez, Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri and Bernardo Silva were also nominated. The list also included Marcelo Brozovic, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Victor Osimhen, Arsenal’s Declan Rice and Ilkay Gundogan, who played with the 23-year-old at the Etihad last season. And Haaland’s dad – ex-City ace Alf-Inge – couldn’t hide his frustration after the Argentina international was handed the award. The camera caught the former City ace looking stony faced with furrowed brow as other attendees applauded the Barcelona legend. And some football fans agree with the ex-Leeds star’s reaction in the capital. One supporter tweeted: “Feel bad for Haaland man. His dad was even p****d….” Another posted: “Haaland not winning a single award after winning all this has to be one the biggest robberies in football history.” A third said: “I’ll say it again. Haaland should be winning these awards. Messi is a legend but Haaland came to a new league, smashed its goal record, and won a Treble.” This fan wrote: “What more does Haaland have to do?” And that one wondered: “If Erling Haaland had won the World Cup with Norway in December 2022 while Messi won the treble, who would have won both the Ballon d’Or and The Best Awards?” It wasn’t the only controversial moment of the evening, either – after Pep Guardiola accidentally dropped an F-bomb after an awkward grilling from Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.

But he doesn’t have to look far for one character he believes will be like a new signing when the Scottish top flight kicks off again - one he is convinced is on course to make a huge impact. Hibees hitman Harry McKirdy’s return from career-saving heart surgery in the summer was almost a month ahead of schedule when the striker climbed off the bench for a cameo in the 2-2 draw with Motherwell a fortnight ago. Just watching his fellow Englishman fight back from being floored by the shock diagnosis has shown Montgomery what type of player he’s dealing with. More importantly it’s also sent the type of positive energy flowing through the rest of the squad that any new arrival would struggle to match. The 26-year-old’s first season in Leith might have misfired badly with the striker failing to hit the net once. But with a fresh start, a re-energised hunger to succeed and a new boss to impress, Montgomery is convinced Hibs fans are about to see the real Harry McKirdy.

He came on against Motherwell and the reception he got just warming up shows the great support we’ve got. Everyone understands he has been through a really tough time. “He has been training really hard. Mentally it’s been really tough for him. He’s a very fit player but when when you’re out for a long time It’s not easy to get back at a high intensity. Moving forward Harry can give us energy off the bench, an impact, we play a lot of teams that sit players behind the ball but Harry is the type of maverick player who can do something out of nothing and create a goal. “We will manage him day to day and not week to week because it’s important we look after him. He is pushing himself and his attitude is fantastic. Coming off the bench before the break gave him a big lift and he is champing at the bit to get back. Hopefully we can get him more minutes and continue to build him up without pushing him too far. “The squad have been great with him. He’s a really popular member of the group. He’s needed that support because at times people see him come off the bench against Motherwell but they don’t see the ups and downs he’s had. “He’s had a lot of them. I’ve had him in my office a lot of times, just putting my arm around him telling him to keep going and believe he can come back. “Everyone is just really happy for him. He’s a great kid and when you know someone has been through a real tough time like Harry, to see him back training and doing what he loves doing. “It’s not easy when you have an injury or an issue to sit at the side of the pitch. It’s what you want to do and it’s your job but if you can’t do it it does become really difficult. He’s a great kid and this will build resilience for him. “I’ve no doubt on the positive side it’ll make him a better person and appreciate football more. He’s desperate to show people what he’s got and probably prove people wrong as well. I don’t think after signing he really showed the impact he can but sometimes that can be the situation and environment. “But right now he feels a part of the group and he knows we love and we’re all desperate to see him get back to his full tilt.” (Image: SNS Group) McKirdy was one of four long-term absentees working feverishly in the background to get close to full fitness during the club’s winter training camp in Dubai. While Chris Cadden is still “six to eight weeks” away from a competitive return and Jake Doyle-Hayes and Adam Le Fondre are also a little way off despite returning to training, the hope for McKirdy is that he will be ready to play a part from the bench right away. Next up is Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth round clash at Forfar. And Montgomery said: “There have been a few times where I’ve had to pick him off the floor and chuck a bottle of water on his head. But Harry is all in and he gives everything. He chases everything and it’s obviously been warm weather and we’ve been training twice a day really hard so it’s been a massive effort for him. “We have managed him a little bit in a few of the sessions but he’s given us everything and he’s developing well. “The medical staff have been really good with him. “I think a lot of it is that emotional side and a bit of anxiety over the problem he had so we’re all pushing him and looking after him. If we do that then I’m confident Harry can really make an impact this season and start to show people what he’s about.” Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Scottish Cup away days at this time of year always send a shiver down spine - and not just because of the plunging temperatures. Hearts fans won’t need any reminding of the potential for a slip-up against lower league opposition when they head to take on Spartans this weekend after their embarrassment at Brora three years ago. There may be three divisions and 32 places between the sides but that counts for nothing if Steven Naismith ’s players come back from their winter break in the wrong frame of mind. The opportunity is there to create memories for a lifetime because Hearts should be looking to win the competition. I never got that lucky. But I’ve got plenty of memories from the Scottish Cup nonetheless. And just a few brushes with disaster. At Ayr we drew Lochee United at their wee ground in Dundee. Not a problem ... or so we thought. The first game was called off because the pitch was frozen solid, which wasn’t unusual. But when it got called off for a FIFTH time it became a major headache because it kept taking priority over the league games which meant we had gone three weeks without a match. Read More Related Articles Transfer news LIVE as Celtic and Rangers plus Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs eye signings Read More Related Articles Inside the Harry McKirdy Hibs fightback as Nick Montgomery hypes up 'maverick impact' to win over Easter Road Even then it had to go ahead on a Wednesday lunch time because they had no floodlights. The final call-off came on the Monday afternoon and we tried to get the game switched but the SFA booted that idea into touch. So we trailed ourselves up to Dundee on the Wednesday morning, missing a host of our part-time players because they’d rescheduled their shifts at work once too many times for a game that kept getting called off. When we arrived there was a tractor going up and down the pitch scraping the snow and ice off the surface. I remember being tackled more than once by the huge tread marks on the wing! And after all that we drew 1-1 and had to go back to Somerset to play them anyway! Thankfully we dealt with them back in Ayr a few days later. Two years on Ayr were on the road again, this time to Deveronvale from the Highland League. We won 1-0 and I scored the winner late in the game but it was horrible, they had floodlights that were little better than street lights. My best memory from that one was Mark Roberts being stretchered off after five minutes when their centre half - who was carrying a bit to put it politely - sat on him! But again we found a way to get through the tie and we’d bust the chairman’s nut about getting a good bevvy in on the bus home if we won. It wasn’t all protein shakes back then! He held up his side of the bargain and by the time we got back to our Crowwood Hotel meeting point near Cumbernauld everyone fell off the bus steaming. The boss, Brian Reid, warned us not to kick the a**e out of it but on a 200 mile bus journey he had no chance. But it’s all great memories and Hearts have to make sure they create their own in this year’s competition starting at with the short trip across Edinburgh on Saturday. This will be one of Spartans biggest ever games if not THE biggest. Which makes Dougie Samuels’ team dangerous. It’s an artificial pitch, the crowd will be small but right on top of them, Spartans will be defending for their lives and it will no doubt be freezing. It’s not going to be for the feint hearted. I’m sure Naisy will be on high alert. This is not the game you want to ruin the good form and momentum they were on before the break. The cups are huge for Hearts. The fans will be dreaming of winning a piece of silverware and it all starts here. It’s about mindset. Treat the game with the respect it deserves and they should be fine. Whether Dexter Lembikisa is given a debut at Ainslie Park remains to be seen but if does then hopefully he isn’t caught cold. The Wolves right back arrives with some decent write-ups from his time on loan at Rotherham. Hearts will have done their homework on him and they were badly needing someone in that area of the pitch. With another signing or two then Hearts will be in good shape to go on and finish third and have a real crack at the cup. Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Celtic's ice man Odin Thiago Holm has been stuck in cold storage in recent weeks. But former rival Patrick Berg reckons the Norwegian will still be Parkhead hot property like old pal Stefan Johansen. Holm arrived in a £2million summer move from Valerenga and was pitched straight into the side amid an early injury crisis for Brendan Rodgers . His red mist moment against Feyenoord in the Champions League was a setback but the playmaker has still made a solid impression that suggests the Hoops have got one for the future. Berg has no doubts. He watched his buddy Johansen sign for Celts 10 years ago this week, becoming a major star at Parkhead before earning a move to Premier League Fulham and carving out a successful career in England and captaining his country. The Bodo-Glimt ace believes Holm can do the same having kept a close eye on the kid since his breakthrough as a teenager in his homeland. Holm – who turns 21 on Thursday – was hailed as one of the best prospects in Norway when he exploded onto the scene at just 16. Read More Related Articles Brendan Rodgers' next Celtic transfer priority revealed as Nicolas Kuhn deal faces final hurdle before unveiling Read More Related Articles Transfer news LIVE as Celtic and Rangers plus Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs eye signings He was a mainstay in the Tippeligaen with Valerenga – and squared up with Berg just a fortnight before he made the switch to Celts. The Norway international said: “I would say Odin is a good investment and he’ll be worth a lot of money in the future “That’s the thing about these Norwegian talents. They are not so expensive if you pick them up early. But let’s just say Odin has a couple of good seasons for Celtic, I’ve got no doubt they will be able to sell him on for a lot more. “It’s like my good friend Stefan. It was a similar situation as Celtic got him relatively cheaply, he did well for the club and they eventually sold him on to Fulham, where he did very well. I’m sure Odin could do the same. Although if he chooses to stay a long time I am sure that would be good as well, as Celtic are a great club.” Berg – who is in his second spell with Euro shock troops Bodo – watched Holm up close and recognised his ability from the off. He said: “I played against him a lot of times when he was young in Norway. We could see early on he was an exceptional talent. He broke on to the scene really young. He grew up in Trondheim which has Rosenborg, one of the biggest teams in Norway, but he chose to move to a different club to make his way. “He did very well there and it was always going to be a matter of time before a big club picked him up. I was really happy for him to get the move to Celtic – it’s a massive club.” Berg was on a short stint at Lens when Celts crashed out of the Europa Conference League against Bodo two years ago but he watched plenty of the Hoops when Johansen was in town. He knows what it takes to succeed in Scotland and he’s convinced Holm has the big time attitude to thrive and become a major star for club and country. Berg – part of the Norway side Scotland pipped to the Euros – said: “I didn’t play in the game against Celtic but I know how big they are. Odin will be able to handle it. He’s like a lot of young Norwegian players who are coming up right now – they almost enjoy the pressure. “The relish the big occasions. He’s one of them. He’s part of a really strong under 21 side, who I think will do very well in the near future. “Norwegian football is moving in a good direction and players like Odin are going to be a huge part of the future. “We’ve seen guys like Erling Harling and Martin Odegaard, and now you have Oscar Bobb at Manchester City. The big clubs are looking to Norway to pick up young talents now and it’s exciting for the national team. “The future looks good and guys like Odin are going to play a big role. We have not qualified for a major tournament for a while but with these players it’s only a matter of time before we make it. “It’s been hard for us in recent years. We feel like we’ve been at the same level as Scotland but they were the better team in the campaign, so we have to wish them all the best.” The Norway team is down in the dumps but Berg’s Bodo outfit have been European sensations. Kjetil Knutsen’s Arctic Circle side have reached the knockout stages of the Europa Conference again this season having got to the last 16 in the completion the year they dumped Celts, beating Jose Mourinho’s Roma in the group stages. Scottish teams should take note. Berg said: “It’s just a matter of mentality, and having a group, players and staff, who are all thinking the same way and pulling in the same direction. As a Norwegian club, we know we will never have the best players – but we can have the best team. That is our mentality. It was the same in the recent games with Besiktas. We beat them in both games because we were the better team. “They were 11 individuals but we were one team unit. Everyone wants to run and fight for each other. It’s important to have a clear plan throughout the club.” Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice At Old Trafford, Tom Lawrence is best remembered as the answer to a pub quiz teaser. Name the then Manchester United youngster who made way for Ryan Giggs as the Premier League legend stepped off the bench to make his last ever appearance for the Red Devils? Almost 10 years have passed since the Welshman claimed his little place in United history, being replaced by his fellow countryman 70 minutes into his sole senior appearance in a red shirt. Now he’s wearing blue at Ibrox but there’s still questions to be addressed - chiefly, when can the Rangers support expect to see him back in action on a consistent basis. It’s one Lawrence has had to face before and, frankly, he’s sick of it. But not as sick of the repeated injury set-backs that have blighted his 18-months in Glasgow. Last season was written off after just a month after signing from Derby.

But having rejoined Philippe Clement’s Gers in Spain for this week’s training camp, Lawrence - who turned 30 this week - hopes this is the last time he’ll have to face a quizzing on his readiness to perform. “It’s all good, he said. “It was good to get out to Spain and get some training done. I’m just looking forward now. “I’m back training with the team, I’m injury free at the minute. I’m sick of talking about it to be honest. I'm sick of being injured, I just want to get fit and hopefully I can do that. “It was a massive couple months when the gaffer first arrived. I played my part when I was fit so I know what I need to do and I know what to expect.” Lawrence had barely started primary school when he joined United. His footballing education at Old Trafford took place at a time when the Class of 92 were on the books. He himself graduated into the first-team in May 2014 as he was given his debut by Giggs in a win over Hull. Trivia geeks will remember that Giggs was acting as player-manager at the time he chose to take off the young Lawrence and throw himself on for his 963rd and final Man United run-out. But the fact the 13-time Premier League winner was even required to double up in a caretaker capacity was an early sign of the troubles that have plagued the club ever since. The United Way has lost its bearings since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson but for Lawrence, the strict lessons he learned from some of the game’s biggest names have stuck with him - and are the ones he’s now trying to pass on to the young students at Ibrox. Ryan Giggs replaces Tom Lawrence for his final man Utd appearance Looking back on his first-team debut, Lawrence said: “I started the game and Ryan came on for me. “It was his last ever game for Manchester United as he was player/manager at the time. I played 70 minutes and then he came on. “He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I’ll be forever grateful. “I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. You looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Giggs and Paul Scholes. “Coaching-wise, Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively. I’m really thankful to them all. “There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age. “That’s what I try to do at Rangers, I try to bring standards the best I can. Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn’t mess up. “That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It’s instilled in you. “It’s a lot different now but when the younger players do come up to train with us, you try and give them as much confidence as you can.” Fergie Time was over by the time Lawrence made it to the first team under Giggs but the iconic Scot still had an influence over his career. He gave me my first professional contract,” he revealed. “I didn’t actually play under him in the first team because he left the season before. “But he knew everything about everyone. He’d pull you in for a chat in his office and he’d know everything. Tom Lawrence “He was quite an insight. You didn’t want to be uneasy around him because that’s not how he wants you to be. You just knew if you put a foot wrong he’d find out.” Lawrence now hopes he can help Rangers take a step in the right direction as Clement’s team gears up for a huge second half to the season. The title race will still be very much alive if the Ibrox side can win their two games in hand to cut Celtic’s lead back to two points, while the Viaplay Cup winners will be eyeing further prizes in the Europa League and Scottish Cup. “There’s a lot of excitement ahead of the second half of the season,” he said. “I can’t wait to get back out on that pitch playing, I think it will be very special. “We’ve become a lot closer as a squad. We had a lot of new faces in the summer. It always takes a bit of time but we’ve got a strong team bond now and hopefully that shows in the second half of the season.” Lawrence wasn’t quite ready to take part in the team’s La Manga kick-about with Hertha Berlin on Saturday but he’s hoping to play a part in tonight’s friendly clash with Copenhagen. He added: “These games are crucial after a break. “I’ve not played for five weeks so I just want to play as many games as I can to get my fitness back to that peak level.” Lawrence was speaking to promote Rangers’ friendly with Copenhagen at Ibrox on Tuesday.

Le crack argentin avait plusieurs prétendants à ses pieds, dont le PSG il y a quelques semaines. Mais finalement, Claudio Echeverri va rejoindre Manchester City . La pépite de River Plate aurait donné son feu vert à l’équipe de Pep Guardiola . Le PSG aurait ainsi raté un véritable phénomène. « C'est un prodige, un croisement entre Maradona et Messi. C'est un joueur totalement différent des autres. Quand je l'ai vu bouger, je me suis excité dès le premier contrôle orienté, parce que je savais que j'avais trouvé un autre type de footballeur. Sans aucun doute, c'est un enfant prodige » a expliqué Daniel Brizuela pour Página 12 . Le PSG pourrait bien avoir des regrets. Claudio Echeverri n'est d'ailleurs pas le premier à avoir échappé au club de la capitale. Il y a quelques mois, la direction parisienne convoitait Endrick . Le crack de Palmeiras rejoindra cependant le Real Madrid l'été prochain. Vitor Roque était également sur la liste du PSG . Mais la pépite de l' Athletico Paranaense a signé au FC Barcelone cet hiver.
