It came a week after Moore was subjected to racial abuse on social media following the heavy first-leg defeat, which resulted in the perpetrator being banned from the club for life. Moore praised their resilience and fight but was also complimentary to his opponents on a special night for football. \"I thank Peterborough for the game because they were part of it. What we have done has not sunk in yet, because it has been a remarkable night for football. A real never-say-die by the boys,\" Moore told Sky Sports. \"We prepared all week. We planned after the first leg and changed our mindset, and there was a real belief.\" Moore took over the head coach job in March 2021, and while he failed to prevent their relegation to the Championship that year, he has taken them to the playoffs in back-to-back seasons. Sheffield's captain Barry Banna dedicated the win to Moore after the racial abuse he suffered. \"What he's done in the last week has been unbelievable, to turn around this mindset of the players. He had a massive job to turn this around, and he's done unbelievable,\" Banna told Sky Sports. \"I'm so proud of him and how he has handled this week after the racism he received. That shouldn't be anywhere near football, never mind a manager that's won 96 points this season, so that's one for him.\" Moore was one of the nominees for the EFL League One Manager of the Season after finishing in third place with 96 points, missing out on automatic promotion to the EFL Championship.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:52:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Germans supporting Boyz for 20 years","link":"https://jamaica-star.com/article/sports/20230519/germans-supporting-boyz-20-years","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Wheeler - Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"In a country, as steeped in football tradition and importance as Germany, it should be hard-pressed to find citizens who would have a group dedicated to supporting Jamaica's Reggae Boyz, let alone be active for two decades. But Andy Wieser and...","content":"But Andy Wieser and Lukas Glaser have not only been lured by the culture of Jamaica but also the football team through their German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group, a small yet strong group, which over the last 20 years has supported the team through thick and thin. Both lovers of football, the beginnings of their fandom started with Jamaica the country - Andy was drawn to the beaches and Lukas to reggae music - but both said that the Boyz 1998 World Cup campaign was the moment that made them fans for life. \"I saw the World Cup game against Croatia and Jamaica's first World Cup goal. Robbie Earle scored such a wonderful header. The Boyz lost, but I fell in love with the team and fans. It was when there was no internet,\" Wieser told . \"I got addicted to reggae music and listened to Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, the old reggae legends. On the one, it was the love for football, and on the other, it was the love for reggae. For me, it was clear that I wanted to see what the Jamaican national team was like if they were good or not,\" Glaser added. \"I was fascinated when they qualified with Renee Simoes. I followed the games, and since 1998 we have been great fans of the Jamaica national team.\" An opportunity to see the Reggae Boyz under-19 in Germany five years later planted the seed of what would now be the German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group thanks to another friend who created the webpage to start. \"He showed me that he could make a home page so we formed the German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group. That page still exists. I am the webmaster, and I am glad to say that it still works,\" Wieser said. For 20 years, the page has updated the small group with the latest news from Jamaican football. From staying up late to watch the games to being live when they play in Europe, they have been faithful in their support and their potential in a crucial World Cup cycle. \"The talent on the island is there, and the overseas-based players are very talented. The most important thing is to create a team, and I think then, we will qualify for 2026,\" Glaser said. The hope for them is not only a return trip to Jamaica to see the Reggae Boyz at the office, but for when Europe gets hosting duties within the next 20 years, they will mobilise enough numbers to create overseas foreign support for the Boyz provided that they qualify.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:50:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Utah football: Will Florida State transfer be healthy for 2023 season?","link":"https://www.deseret.com/2023/5/19/23715323/what-does-utahs-wide-receivers-room-look-like-with-addition-of-florida-state-transfer-mycah-pittman","keywords":null,"creator":["Jeff Call"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"During spring practices, coach Kyle Whittingham expressed that one of his concerns was with the wide receivers room . He said that he and his staff would be looking to improve the depth at that position through the transfer portal. Near the end of spring, first-year receivers coach Alvis Whitted said, “I think that we need to find a couple more guys that can help cement the room and help the room. That’s what it’s all about — putting guys in positions to have success. We do need that. I know we’ll address it after the spring moving forward. Not necessarily enough playmakers. But that will be addressed.” On May 7, the Utes addressed that need through the transfer portal by receiving a commitment from Florida State transfer Mycah Pittman . The 5-foot-11, 203-pound receiver caught 32 passes for 330 yards and three touchdowns with the Seminoles. Before that, he played at Oregon, where he hauled in 38 receptions for 547 yards and two TDs. Pittman is the son of longtime NFL receiver Michael Pittman. His brother is Michael Pittman Jr., who currently plays for the Indianapolis Colts. But Mycah Pittman’s status is unclear. He missed spring practices at FSU due to an injury. “Your boy is going to be out for four to six months,” Pittman said in a video posted on his YouTube page in mid-March. “I do not know if I will be able to make it back during the season, but we have a great training staff and we have great people around me that’s going to help me try and get back.” Pittman said the injury was a full labral tear in his hip labrum. He said he thinks it happened during fall camp last August but he played through the injury last season, unaware of the severity of the injury at the time. It remains to be seen when Pittman will be medically cleared to play. Utah’s receivers room right now includes Devaughn Vele , Money Parks and Mikey Matthews. “Devaughn Vele is the guy that’s our premier weapon on the outside. Money Parks has tremendous speed and a lot of upside. Still too many drops,” Whittingham said. “We’ve got to get those drops worked out. He has good hands; he just needs to concentrate a little bit better. Mikey Mathews just got here a few months ago and he’s doing some really good things.” What does Vele think about the wide receivers group? “I see a lot of growth in our receiver room. There are a lot of younger guys. We need them to step up. There’s a bigger emphasis on them getting reps in spring ball,” he said. “I feel like I’m a big part of that now that I’m the oldest guy in the room. Just helping them understand what’s expected of them. Mikey is bringing a lot of good things to the table. He’s always asking a ton of questions and he’s really bought in. I have high expectations for him as well as all the other guys that have been here.” Florida State wide receiver Mycah Pittman (4) and teammates run to the field before the Cheez-It Bowl against Oklahoma, Thursday, Dec. 29, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. This fall the former Seminole, who is recovering from offseason surgery, hopes to be trotting onto the turf at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Phelan M.

He's an icon and I think our strategy will be to make sure that we've got good relationships with a lot of our club legends. \"I spoke earlier this week, I think it was even yesterday to Richard Gough and text with Kevin Thomson and Craig Moore so it's important that we've got those touch points with people that are so, so important to the clubs' history. \"Graeme was in Glasgow for a private engagement and dropped in for a coffee. It was an informal conversation because we want to maintain that relationship. \"Hopefully, in the future, he'll be involved in more opportunities in an ambassadorial sense. I think that's for Graeme to decide but I think the extent of the rumours probably went a little bit further than the reality on that one.\" Asked if he had discussed an ambassadorial role with him, Bisgrove added: \"Not specifically. As I said, it was an informal chance just to reconnect because Graeme happened to be in Glasgow and he loves to come into Ibrox. We had a coffee, we had a great conversation and that was all for now. \"I think as I've said, for all of the ex-players, you look at John Greig, the greatest ever Ranger is still there every day on a match day.

Lay some sod, turf or cinder, mark its boundaries with appropriate exactness, and let loose the human will—the need—to test our physical boundaries.At their best, these secular cathedrals also inspire those who sit in the stands that ring these fields of endeavors. They become our town halls, in which the mere act of being there makes us a part of the community—and from which the community draws identity.On the afternoon of Sept. 18, 1932, Paterson, N.J., Mayor John V. Hinchliffe officially dedicated a grand Art Deco piece of architectural inspiration for his diverse and industrious city. “On ground sacred to this city,” as the Paterson Morning Call reported, Hinchliffe had the honor of opening a stadium in his family’s name. With its white-washed concrete walls, red terracotta roof tiles and five gabled towers, Hinchliffe Stadium made for an elegant horseshoe of dreams.“It not only affords the opportunities for physical development and entertainment for the thousands who enjoy physical contests,” Hinchliffe told the crowd that day, “but it will serve as well as a civic center, as an ideal place for public entertainment of all kinds on a large scale.” Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network The mayor boasted that 70% of the city’s population lived within a 15-minute walk of the stadium. Hinchliffe Stadium served its civic role well, especially as home to Negro Leagues baseball, the embodiment of opportunity for those otherwise denied it. Over four rollicking decades, everyone from Josh Gibson to Jim Thorpe to Vince Lombardi to Lou Costello to Duke Ellington to thousands of high school athletes, including me, played there—until urban decay and financial neglect left the old gem a crumbling, weed-and-graffiti-covered forgotten eyesore.What was lost has been found again. On Friday, Andre Sayegh, the second-term Paterson mayor, will proudly reopen Hinchliffe Stadium with the same hope Hinchliffe did 91 years ago. Both mayors were driving forces in the making of the stadium as a center of civic pride.It is the best kind of sports story: the comeback. And it is the best kind of urban renewal: honoring a history of opportunity by coming together to make it happen all over again for a new generation and beyond.As one of only two surviving Negro Leagues ballparks (Rickwood Field in Birmingham is the other), Hinchliffe is a National Historic Landmark that gives tangible, meaningful honor to an important chapter in U.S. history. It is once again a living history book whose story needs to be told. On this bluff 400 feet from Paterson’s stunning 71-foot Great Falls that once inspired Alexander Hamilton to envision the first planned industrial city in America, Hinchliffe served as home to the New York Black Yankees from 1933 to ’37 and ’39 to ’45, and the New York Black Cubans from ’35 to ’36.The “sacred grounds” back then referred to an area known as Monument Heights because of a cemetery and a Civil War monument located on that bluff. Ninety-one years later, these are the sacred grounds where more than 20 future Hall of Famers once played, including Gibson, Paterson native Larry Doby, Monte Irvin, “Cool Papa” Bell, Judy Johnson and Satchel Paige. It is likely Jackie Robinson also played there with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs. The New Jersey Jackals, an independent team, will move from nearby Little Falls to play at Hinchliffe Stadium.Chris Pedota, NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network Baseball will again be played at Hinchliffe. The New Jersey Jackals, an independent team, will move there from nearby Little Falls. Their owner, Al Dorso, is a Paterson native. It will be the first professional baseball played there since 1950—and the first professional ball games played within the confines of a U.S. National Park (Paterson Great Falls). Hinchliffe also will again host school and amateur events, including ball games, graduations and concerts. High school ballplayers will be able to play on the same grounds and within the same walls as Negro Leagues legends. Hinchliffe will become the gathering place and source of pride it was for so many years. Sixteen miles from New York City, Paterson is a melting pot of 157,000 people over nine square miles, making it the second-most densely populated city in the country. The arc of Hinchliffe is the arc of Paterson, a city once known as “Silk City.” In the 1880s, Paterson manufactured half of all silk made in the U.S. It later transitioned to manufacturing airplane engines. The stadium’s prominence rose and fell with the city’s fortunes. It rises again as a monument to community will.The Hinchliffe story begins amid the Great Depression, when local leaders caught the energy of a stadium building boom as sports rose in importance in 1920s America. The Olmsted brothers, sons of famed architect Frederick Law Olmsted, were hired as landscape architects of the public works project. John Shaw of the local Fanning and Shaw architectural firm, known for its schools and churches, designed the stadium. With its gabled towers and bronze relief representations of Olympic athletes crafted by Paterson sculptor Gaetano Federici, Shaw chose an Art Deco/moderne style with a wink toward classical to inspire young athletes.The stadium unofficially opened in July 1932 around celebrations of George Washington’s bicentennial birthday. The first games were a doubleheader between the Paterson Professionals and the House of David, the legendary bearded team from Michigan. The name “Hinchliffe City Stadium” was chosen at the September dedication to honor Mayor Hinchliffe and his uncle, also named John Hinchliffe, who had also served as mayor of Paterson and made his fortune in Paterson’s booming brewery business before Prohibition.For the next four decades Hinchliffe Stadium served diverse populations as a bustling social, cultural, athletic and educational hub. (Central High students would gather for a graduation picture on the field while spelling out the last two digits of their graduation year in the manner of a band formation.)Negro Leagues games were important from the start. In its second year, Hinchliffe hosted the 1933 Colored Championship of the Nation, the equivalent of a Negro Leagues World Series, with the Philadelphia All-Stars prevailing over the Black Yankees and Pittsburgh Crawfords. Hinchliffe also hosted numerous barnstorming games, including Thorpe and his Oklahoma Indians; the 1933 Pirates, with six Hall of Famers, including coach Honus Wagner, who was discovered by scouts while playing in Paterson in 1896; and Dizzy Dean and the 1934 Cardinals 10 days after they won the World Series.The beehive of activity also hosted amateur and professional football (which is how Lombardi came to play there), auto racing, boxing, track and field, rodeo, concerts (Ellington, Paterson-born Costello, The Andrews Sisters, and Sly and the Family Stone made appearances), civic festivals and high school sports. When Central played Eastside in the first Thanksgiving football game played at Hinchliffe, in 1932, a crowd of 13,000 attended, a few thousand past capacity thanks to additional temporary bleachers and standing room areas.Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey attended Diamond Gloves amateur boxing tournaments in the 1930s and ’40s. The Bambino came to Hinchliffe in 1939, ’43, ’46 and ’47, when The Morning Call noted he was “recovering from a serious illness.” He died 13 months later. An aerial view of Hinchliffe Stadium before the multimillion-dollar renovation project began ...Bruce Bennett/Getty Images ... and another when the project was near completion. Tariq Zehawi and Danielle Parhizkaran/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network In 1963, the city sold Hinchliffe to the Paterson school system for $1. The school district reoriented the baseball diamond, which used to face the open end of the horseshoe and toward the Great Falls, rendering right field too short for competitive play. Through the ’70s and ’80s, Paterson, like many cities built on an industrial economy in an increasingly mobile society, suffered through hard financial times. The schools didn’t have the finances to maintain a 10,000-seat stadium.I played a high school football game at Hinchliffe in 1977 for Seton Hall Prep. We beat Eastside, 26–0. Playing inside the horseshoe felt like exploring an abandoned mansion; you could see the neglect, but you could feel the grandeur and history. It was an honor to play in that hallowed space, regardless of its condition.In 1983, in a last gasp of renewal, the Paterson schools invested in Astroturf and a urethane surface for the track. A sinkhole opened in the outfield (one in the infield had troubled the place from the start). The turf quickly faded and grew tattered. Meanwhile, in ’85, just 19 miles away, Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, where Robinson played his first game with the Dodgers’ Montreal farm team in ’46, was demolished.The bulldozers seemed bound for Hinchliffe next. By 1992, Paterson schools were in receivership to the State of New Jersey. There was no money to keep up the old stadium. School leaders in ’94 threatened it with demolition. In ’96 they closed it.Hinchliffe almost died not by bulldozer but by neglect. Its carcass became a visual cacophony of weeds, climbing vines, crumbling concrete and graffiti. No one even noticed the theft of two bronze plaques dedicated to local athletes, including Paterson’s 100-yard national sprint champion, Eleanor Egg Krattiger, “the fastest woman in the world,” until they turned up years later in a pawn shop.The effort to revive Hinchliffe began in the early 2000s with a grassroots campaign when the Paterson Historical Preservation Committee petitioned in ’03 to include Hinchliffe on the list of National Register of Historic Places. Under “Areas of Significance,” per the form’s instructions, the committee wrote “Entertainment/Recreation” and “Ethnic Heritage—African American.” Under “Significant Person,” they wrote “Larry Doby,” the “Silk City Slugger” who became the first player to integrate the American League. The group won Historic Place status for Hinchliffe in ’04.In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, which designated the Great Falls as a National Historic Park and included a mandate to assess “options for the preservation of Hinchliffe Stadium.”Four years later, Hinchliffe was named a National Historic Landmark (NHL), becoming the first site of any kind associated with the Negro Leagues to gain the designation, the first baseball stadium so designated (Wrigley Field was added in 2020) and only the fourth football stadium (after Harvard Stadium, the Rose Bowl and the Yale Bowl).In 2014 a group called Friends of Hinchliffe Stadium asked for volunteers to come out one day to pull weeds and paint over graffiti. Eight hundred people turned out. Five years later, Sayegh, who was raised in Paterson and is the city’s first Arab American mayor, proposed $18.7 million in funds to reopen Hinchliffe. Two years later, under the determination of the Hinchliffe Master Urban Renewal project, ground broke on a $109 million renovation, which includes 76 housing units and is funded mostly with state tax credits. Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, who was raised in the city, was integral in pushing for the renovation project to be approved. Kyle Mazza/NurPhoto/AP Last year, Chuck Muth, 67, a former soft drink executive who grew up in Paterson, donated $5 million to his alma mater, Montclair State, to build a museum at Hinchliffe dedicated to the Negro Leagues and the stadium’s history. Their stories will be told.When Paterson applied for its NHL designation, its nomination noted that despite “years of vacancy and vandalism,” Hinchliffe remained remarkably intact, “if not the most intact” of stadiums associated with Negro Leagues baseball.The nomination went on:“The ultimate test for integrity for Hinchliffe Stadium is whether members of the New York Black Yankees, or Newark Eagles, or Cuban Stars, Bacharach Giants, Pittsburgh Crawfords, or any of the other teams that played there, or the spectators, or participants in the other sporting events of the 1930s would recognize the place if they were able to return. Undoubtedly, they would.”How wonderful that all these years later we can recognize the place not just for its physical beauty but also for its historical significance. It took 27 years, but Hinchliffe is back. Its revival is not just about perseverance. It’s also about civil rights, opportunity, history and community and political willpower. And it’s about how the physical space of a stadium can still bond and inspire us.On Friday, Sayegh can borrow the same line Mayor Hinchliffe used 91 years ago on these sacred grounds: “This athletic field will serve the interests of Paterson and its people long after the youngest among us has passed on.”","pubDate":"2023-05-19 12:30:49","image_url":"https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4MDU1NTQ5MjAyMzQzMTAy/dcovhinchliffe_h.jpg","source_id":"si","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Big comeback for former Reggae Boy Moore in English League One","link":"https://jamaica-star.com/article/sports/20230519/big-comeback-former-reggae-boy-moore-english-league-one","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Wheeler - Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Reggae Boy Darren Moore is on the brink of the biggest achievement of his managerial career after overseeing Sheffield Wednesday's passage to the League One play-off final in a dramatic manner.

It came a week after Moore was subjected to racial abuse on social media following the heavy first-leg defeat, which resulted in the perpetrator being banned from the club for life. Moore praised their resilience and fight but was also complimentary to his opponents on a special night for football. \"I thank Peterborough for the game because they were part of it. What we have done has not sunk in yet, because it has been a remarkable night for football. A real never-say-die by the boys,\" Moore told Sky Sports. \"We prepared all week. We planned after the first leg and changed our mindset, and there was a real belief.\" Moore took over the head coach job in March 2021, and while he failed to prevent their relegation to the Championship that year, he has taken them to the playoffs in back-to-back seasons. Sheffield's captain Barry Banna dedicated the win to Moore after the racial abuse he suffered. \"What he's done in the last week has been unbelievable, to turn around this mindset of the players. He had a massive job to turn this around, and he's done unbelievable,\" Banna told Sky Sports. \"I'm so proud of him and how he has handled this week after the racism he received. That shouldn't be anywhere near football, never mind a manager that's won 96 points this season, so that's one for him.\" Moore was one of the nominees for the EFL League One Manager of the Season after finishing in third place with 96 points, missing out on automatic promotion to the EFL Championship.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:52:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Germans supporting Boyz for 20 years","link":"https://jamaica-star.com/article/sports/20230519/germans-supporting-boyz-20-years","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Wheeler - Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"In a country, as steeped in football tradition and importance as Germany, it should be hard-pressed to find citizens who would have a group dedicated to supporting Jamaica's Reggae Boyz, let alone be active for two decades.

Both lovers of football, the beginnings of their fandom started with Jamaica the country - Andy was drawn to the beaches and Lukas to reggae music - but both said that the Boyz 1998 World Cup campaign was the moment that made them fans for life. \"I saw the World Cup game against Croatia and Jamaica's first World Cup goal. Robbie Earle scored such a wonderful header. The Boyz lost, but I fell in love with the team and fans. It was when there was no internet,\" Wieser told . \"I got addicted to reggae music and listened to Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, the old reggae legends. On the one, it was the love for football, and on the other, it was the love for reggae. For me, it was clear that I wanted to see what the Jamaican national team was like if they were good or not,\" Glaser added. \"I was fascinated when they qualified with Renee Simoes. I followed the games, and since 1998 we have been great fans of the Jamaica national team.\" An opportunity to see the Reggae Boyz under-19 in Germany five years later planted the seed of what would now be the German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group thanks to another friend who created the webpage to start. \"He showed me that he could make a home page so we formed the German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group. That page still exists. I am the webmaster, and I am glad to say that it still works,\" Wieser said. For 20 years, the page has updated the small group with the latest news from Jamaican football. From staying up late to watch the games to being live when they play in Europe, they have been faithful in their support and their potential in a crucial World Cup cycle. \"The talent on the island is there, and the overseas-based players are very talented. The most important thing is to create a team, and I think then, we will qualify for 2026,\" Glaser said. The hope for them is not only a return trip to Jamaica to see the Reggae Boyz at the office, but for when Europe gets hosting duties within the next 20 years, they will mobilise enough numbers to create overseas foreign support for the Boyz provided that they qualify.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:50:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Utah football: Will Florida State transfer be healthy for 2023 season?","link":"https://www.deseret.com/2023/5/19/23715323/what-does-utahs-wide-receivers-room-look-like-with-addition-of-florida-state-transfer-mycah-pittman","keywords":null,"creator":["Jeff Call"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"During spring practices, coach Kyle Whittingham expressed that one of his concerns was with the wide receivers room . He said that he and his staff would be looking to improve the depth at that position through the transfer portal. Near the end of spring, first-year receivers coach Alvis Whitted said, “I think that we need to find a couple more guys that can help cement the room and help the room. That’s what it’s all about — putting guys in positions to have success. We do need that. I know we’ll address it after the spring moving forward. Not necessarily enough playmakers. But that will be addressed.” On May 7, the Utes addressed that need through the transfer portal by receiving a commitment from Florida State transfer Mycah Pittman . The 5-foot-11, 203-pound receiver caught 32 passes for 330 yards and three touchdowns with the Seminoles. Before that, he played at Oregon, where he hauled in 38 receptions for 547 yards and two TDs. Pittman is the son of longtime NFL receiver Michael Pittman. His brother is Michael Pittman Jr., who currently plays for the Indianapolis Colts. But Mycah Pittman’s status is unclear. He missed spring practices at FSU due to an injury. “Your boy is going to be out for four to six months,” Pittman said in a video posted on his YouTube page in mid-March. “I do not know if I will be able to make it back during the season, but we have a great training staff and we have great people around me that’s going to help me try and get back.” Pittman said the injury was a full labral tear in his hip labrum. He said he thinks it happened during fall camp last August but he played through the injury last season, unaware of the severity of the injury at the time. It remains to be seen when Pittman will be medically cleared to play. Utah’s receivers room right now includes Devaughn Vele , Money Parks and Mikey Matthews. “Devaughn Vele is the guy that’s our premier weapon on the outside. Money Parks has tremendous speed and a lot of upside. Still too many drops,” Whittingham said. “We’ve got to get those drops worked out. He has good hands; he just needs to concentrate a little bit better. Mikey Mathews just got here a few months ago and he’s doing some really good things.” What does Vele think about the wide receivers group? “I see a lot of growth in our receiver room. There are a lot of younger guys. We need them to step up. There’s a bigger emphasis on them getting reps in spring ball,” he said. “I feel like I’m a big part of that now that I’m the oldest guy in the room. Just helping them understand what’s expected of them. Mikey is bringing a lot of good things to the table. He’s always asking a ton of questions and he’s really bought in. I have high expectations for him as well as all the other guys that have been here.” Florida State wide receiver Mycah Pittman (4) and teammates run to the field before the Cheez-It Bowl against Oklahoma, Thursday, Dec. 29, 2022, in Orlando, Fla. This fall the former Seminole, who is recovering from offseason surgery, hopes to be trotting onto the turf at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Phelan M.

It was an informal conversation because we want to maintain that relationship. \"Hopefully, in the future, he'll be involved in more opportunities in an ambassadorial sense.

Lay some sod, turf or cinder, mark its boundaries with appropriate exactness, and let loose the human will—the need—to test our physical boundaries.At their best, these secular cathedrals also inspire those who sit in the stands that ring these fields of endeavors. They become our town halls, in which the mere act of being there makes us a part of the community—and from which the community draws identity.On the afternoon of Sept. 18, 1932, Paterson, N.J., Mayor John V. Hinchliffe officially dedicated a grand Art Deco piece of architectural inspiration for his diverse and industrious city. “On ground sacred to this city,” as the Paterson Morning Call reported, Hinchliffe had the honor of opening a stadium in his family’s name. With its white-washed concrete walls, red terracotta roof tiles and five gabled towers, Hinchliffe Stadium made for an elegant horseshoe of dreams.“It not only affords the opportunities for physical development and entertainment for the thousands who enjoy physical contests,” Hinchliffe told the crowd that day, “but it will serve as well as a civic center, as an ideal place for public entertainment of all kinds on a large scale.” Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network The mayor boasted that 70% of the city’s population lived within a 15-minute walk of the stadium. Hinchliffe Stadium served its civic role well, especially as home to Negro Leagues baseball, the embodiment of opportunity for those otherwise denied it. Over four rollicking decades, everyone from Josh Gibson to Jim Thorpe to Vince Lombardi to Lou Costello to Duke Ellington to thousands of high school athletes, including me, played there—until urban decay and financial neglect left the old gem a crumbling, weed-and-graffiti-covered forgotten eyesore.What was lost has been found again. On Friday, Andre Sayegh, the second-term Paterson mayor, will proudly reopen Hinchliffe Stadium with the same hope Hinchliffe did 91 years ago. Both mayors were driving forces in the making of the stadium as a center of civic pride.It is the best kind of sports story: the comeback. And it is the best kind of urban renewal: honoring a history of opportunity by coming together to make it happen all over again for a new generation and beyond.As one of only two surviving Negro Leagues ballparks (Rickwood Field in Birmingham is the other), Hinchliffe is a National Historic Landmark that gives tangible, meaningful honor to an important chapter in U.S. history. It is once again a living history book whose story needs to be told. On this bluff 400 feet from Paterson’s stunning 71-foot Great Falls that once inspired Alexander Hamilton to envision the first planned industrial city in America, Hinchliffe served as home to the New York Black Yankees from 1933 to ’37 and ’39 to ’45, and the New York Black Cubans from ’35 to ’36.The “sacred grounds” back then referred to an area known as Monument Heights because of a cemetery and a Civil War monument located on that bluff. Ninety-one years later, these are the sacred grounds where more than 20 future Hall of Famers once played, including Gibson, Paterson native Larry Doby, Monte Irvin, “Cool Papa” Bell, Judy Johnson and Satchel Paige. It is likely Jackie Robinson also played there with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs. The New Jersey Jackals, an independent team, will move from nearby Little Falls to play at Hinchliffe Stadium.Chris Pedota, NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network Baseball will again be played at Hinchliffe. The New Jersey Jackals, an independent team, will move there from nearby Little Falls. Their owner, Al Dorso, is a Paterson native. It will be the first professional baseball played there since 1950—and the first professional ball games played within the confines of a U.S. National Park (Paterson Great Falls). Hinchliffe also will again host school and amateur events, including ball games, graduations and concerts. High school ballplayers will be able to play on the same grounds and within the same walls as Negro Leagues legends. Hinchliffe will become the gathering place and source of pride it was for so many years. Sixteen miles from New York City, Paterson is a melting pot of 157,000 people over nine square miles, making it the second-most densely populated city in the country. The arc of Hinchliffe is the arc of Paterson, a city once known as “Silk City.” In the 1880s, Paterson manufactured half of all silk made in the U.S. It later transitioned to manufacturing airplane engines. The stadium’s prominence rose and fell with the city’s fortunes. It rises again as a monument to community will.The Hinchliffe story begins amid the Great Depression, when local leaders caught the energy of a stadium building boom as sports rose in importance in 1920s America. The Olmsted brothers, sons of famed architect Frederick Law Olmsted, were hired as landscape architects of the public works project. John Shaw of the local Fanning and Shaw architectural firm, known for its schools and churches, designed the stadium. With its gabled towers and bronze relief representations of Olympic athletes crafted by Paterson sculptor Gaetano Federici, Shaw chose an Art Deco/moderne style with a wink toward classical to inspire young athletes.The stadium unofficially opened in July 1932 around celebrations of George Washington’s bicentennial birthday. The first games were a doubleheader between the Paterson Professionals and the House of David, the legendary bearded team from Michigan. The name “Hinchliffe City Stadium” was chosen at the September dedication to honor Mayor Hinchliffe and his uncle, also named John Hinchliffe, who had also served as mayor of Paterson and made his fortune in Paterson’s booming brewery business before Prohibition.For the next four decades Hinchliffe Stadium served diverse populations as a bustling social, cultural, athletic and educational hub. (Central High students would gather for a graduation picture on the field while spelling out the last two digits of their graduation year in the manner of a band formation.)Negro Leagues games were important from the start. In its second year, Hinchliffe hosted the 1933 Colored Championship of the Nation, the equivalent of a Negro Leagues World Series, with the Philadelphia All-Stars prevailing over the Black Yankees and Pittsburgh Crawfords. Hinchliffe also hosted numerous barnstorming games, including Thorpe and his Oklahoma Indians; the 1933 Pirates, with six Hall of Famers, including coach Honus Wagner, who was discovered by scouts while playing in Paterson in 1896; and Dizzy Dean and the 1934 Cardinals 10 days after they won the World Series.The beehive of activity also hosted amateur and professional football (which is how Lombardi came to play there), auto racing, boxing, track and field, rodeo, concerts (Ellington, Paterson-born Costello, The Andrews Sisters, and Sly and the Family Stone made appearances), civic festivals and high school sports. When Central played Eastside in the first Thanksgiving football game played at Hinchliffe, in 1932, a crowd of 13,000 attended, a few thousand past capacity thanks to additional temporary bleachers and standing room areas.Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey attended Diamond Gloves amateur boxing tournaments in the 1930s and ’40s. The Bambino came to Hinchliffe in 1939, ’43, ’46 and ’47, when The Morning Call noted he was “recovering from a serious illness.” He died 13 months later.

The school district reoriented the baseball diamond, which used to face the open end of the horseshoe and toward the Great Falls, rendering right field too short for competitive play. Through the ’70s and ’80s, Paterson, like many cities built on an industrial economy in an increasingly mobile society, suffered through hard financial times. The schools didn’t have the finances to maintain a 10,000-seat stadium.I played a high school football game at Hinchliffe in 1977 for Seton Hall Prep. We beat Eastside, 26–0. Playing inside the horseshoe felt like exploring an abandoned mansion; you could see the neglect, but you could feel the grandeur and history. It was an honor to play in that hallowed space, regardless of its condition.In 1983, in a last gasp of renewal, the Paterson schools invested in Astroturf and a urethane surface for the track. A sinkhole opened in the outfield (one in the infield had troubled the place from the start). The turf quickly faded and grew tattered. Meanwhile, in ’85, just 19 miles away, Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, where Robinson played his first game with the Dodgers’ Montreal farm team in ’46, was demolished.The bulldozers seemed bound for Hinchliffe next. By 1992, Paterson schools were in receivership to the State of New Jersey. There was no money to keep up the old stadium. School leaders in ’94 threatened it with demolition. In ’96 they closed it.Hinchliffe almost died not by bulldozer but by neglect. Its carcass became a visual cacophony of weeds, climbing vines, crumbling concrete and graffiti. No one even noticed the theft of two bronze plaques dedicated to local athletes, including Paterson’s 100-yard national sprint champion, Eleanor Egg Krattiger, “the fastest woman in the world,” until they turned up years later in a pawn shop.The effort to revive Hinchliffe began in the early 2000s with a grassroots campaign when the Paterson Historical Preservation Committee petitioned in ’03 to include Hinchliffe on the list of National Register of Historic Places. Under “Areas of Significance,” per the form’s instructions, the committee wrote “Entertainment/Recreation” and “Ethnic Heritage—African American.” Under “Significant Person,” they wrote “Larry Doby,” the “Silk City Slugger” who became the first player to integrate the American League. The group won Historic Place status for Hinchliffe in ’04.In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, which designated the Great Falls as a National Historic Park and included a mandate to assess “options for the preservation of Hinchliffe Stadium.”Four years later, Hinchliffe was named a National Historic Landmark (NHL), becoming the first site of any kind associated with the Negro Leagues to gain the designation, the first baseball stadium so designated (Wrigley Field was added in 2020) and only the fourth football stadium (after Harvard Stadium, the Rose Bowl and the Yale Bowl).In 2014 a group called Friends of Hinchliffe Stadium asked for volunteers to come out one day to pull weeds and paint over graffiti. Eight hundred people turned out. Five years later, Sayegh, who was raised in Paterson and is the city’s first Arab American mayor, proposed $18.7 million in funds to reopen Hinchliffe. Two years later, under the determination of the Hinchliffe Master Urban Renewal project, ground broke on a $109 million renovation, which includes 76 housing units and is funded mostly with state tax credits. Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, who was raised in the city, was integral in pushing for the renovation project to be approved. Kyle Mazza/NurPhoto/AP Last year, Chuck Muth, 67, a former soft drink executive who grew up in Paterson, donated $5 million to his alma mater, Montclair State, to build a museum at Hinchliffe dedicated to the Negro Leagues and the stadium’s history. Their stories will be told.When Paterson applied for its NHL designation, its nomination noted that despite “years of vacancy and vandalism,” Hinchliffe remained remarkably intact, “if not the most intact” of stadiums associated with Negro Leagues baseball.The nomination went on:“The ultimate test for integrity for Hinchliffe Stadium is whether members of the New York Black Yankees, or Newark Eagles, or Cuban Stars, Bacharach Giants, Pittsburgh Crawfords, or any of the other teams that played there, or the spectators, or participants in the other sporting events of the 1930s would recognize the place if they were able to return. Undoubtedly, they would.”How wonderful that all these years later we can recognize the place not just for its physical beauty but also for its historical significance. It took 27 years, but Hinchliffe is back. Its revival is not just about perseverance. It’s also about civil rights, opportunity, history and community and political willpower. And it’s about how the physical space of a stadium can still bond and inspire us.On Friday, Sayegh can borrow the same line Mayor Hinchliffe used 91 years ago on these sacred grounds: “This athletic field will serve the interests of Paterson and its people long after the youngest among us has passed on.”","pubDate":"2023-05-19 12:30:49","image_url":"https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4MDU1NTQ5MjAyMzQzMTAy/dcovhinchliffe_h.jpg","source_id":"si","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Big comeback for former Reggae Boy Moore in English League One","link":"https://jamaica-star.com/article/sports/20230519/big-comeback-former-reggae-boy-moore-english-league-one","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Wheeler - Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Reggae Boy Darren Moore is on the brink of the biggest achievement of his managerial career after overseeing Sheffield Wednesday's passage to the League One play-off final in a dramatic manner.

It came a week after Moore was subjected to racial abuse on social media following the heavy first-leg defeat, which resulted in the perpetrator being banned from the club for life. Moore praised their resilience and fight but was also complimentary to his opponents on a special night for football. \"I thank Peterborough for the game because they were part of it. What we have done has not sunk in yet, because it has been a remarkable night for football. A real never-say-die by the boys,\" Moore told Sky Sports. \"We prepared all week. We planned after the first leg and changed our mindset, and there was a real belief.\" Moore took over the head coach job in March 2021, and while he failed to prevent their relegation to the Championship that year, he has taken them to the playoffs in back-to-back seasons. Sheffield's captain Barry Banna dedicated the win to Moore after the racial abuse he suffered. \"What he's done in the last week has been unbelievable, to turn around this mindset of the players. He had a massive job to turn this around, and he's done unbelievable,\" Banna told Sky Sports. \"I'm so proud of him and how he has handled this week after the racism he received. That shouldn't be anywhere near football, never mind a manager that's won 96 points this season, so that's one for him.\" Moore was one of the nominees for the EFL League One Manager of the Season after finishing in third place with 96 points, missing out on automatic promotion to the EFL Championship.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:52:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Germans supporting Boyz for 20 years","link":"https://jamaica-star.com/article/sports/20230519/germans-supporting-boyz-20-years","keywords":null,"creator":["Daniel Wheeler - Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"In a country, as steeped in football tradition and importance as Germany, it should be hard-pressed to find citizens who would have a group dedicated to supporting Jamaica's Reggae Boyz, let alone be active for two decades.

Both lovers of football, the beginnings of their fandom started with Jamaica the country - Andy was drawn to the beaches and Lukas to reggae music - but both said that the Boyz 1998 World Cup campaign was the moment that made them fans for life. \"I saw the World Cup game against Croatia and Jamaica's first World Cup goal. Robbie Earle scored such a wonderful header. The Boyz lost, but I fell in love with the team and fans. It was when there was no internet,\" Wieser told . \"I got addicted to reggae music and listened to Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, the old reggae legends. On the one, it was the love for football, and on the other, it was the love for reggae. For me, it was clear that I wanted to see what the Jamaican national team was like if they were good or not,\" Glaser added. \"I was fascinated when they qualified with Renee Simoes. I followed the games, and since 1998 we have been great fans of the Jamaica national team.\" An opportunity to see the Reggae Boyz under-19 in Germany five years later planted the seed of what would now be the German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group thanks to another friend who created the webpage to start. \"He showed me that he could make a home page so we formed the German Reggae Boyz Supporters Group. That page still exists. I am the webmaster, and I am glad to say that it still works,\" Wieser said. For 20 years, the page has updated the small group with the latest news from Jamaican football. From staying up late to watch the games to being live when they play in Europe, they have been faithful in their support and their potential in a crucial World Cup cycle. \"The talent on the island is there, and the overseas-based players are very talented. The most important thing is to create a team, and I think then, we will qualify for 2026,\" Glaser said. The hope for them is not only a return trip to Jamaica to see the Reggae Boyz at the office, but for when Europe gets hosting duties within the next 20 years, they will mobilise enough numbers to create overseas foreign support for the Boyz provided that they qualify.","pubDate":"2023-05-19 18:50:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicastar","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Utah football: Will Florida State transfer be healthy for 2023 season?","link":"https://www.deseret.com/2023/5/19/23715323/what-does-utahs-wide-receivers-room-look-like-with-addition-of-florida-state-transfer-mycah-pittman","keywords":null,"creator":["Jeff Call"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"During spring practices, coach Kyle Whittingham expressed that one of his concerns was with the wide receivers room . He said that he and his staff would be looking to improve the depth at that position through the transfer portal. Near the end of spring, first-year receivers coach Alvis Whitted said, “I think that we need to find a couple more guys that can help cement the room and help the room. That’s what it’s all about — putting guys in positions to have success. We do need that. I know we’ll address it after the spring moving forward. Not necessarily enough playmakers. But that will be addressed.” On May 7, the Utes addressed that need through the transfer portal by receiving a commitment from Florida State transfer Mycah Pittman . The 5-foot-11, 203-pound receiver caught 32 passes for 330 yards and three touchdowns with the Seminoles. Before that, he played at Oregon, where he hauled in 38 receptions for 547 yards and two TDs. Pittman is the son of longtime NFL receiver Michael Pittman. His brother is Michael Pittman Jr., who currently plays for the Indianapolis Colts. But Mycah Pittman’s status is unclear. He missed spring practices at FSU due to an injury. “Your boy is going to be out for four to six months,” Pittman said in a video posted on his YouTube page in mid-March. “I do not know if I will be able to make it back during the season, but we have a great training staff and we have great people around me that’s going to help me try and get back.” Pittman said the injury was a full labral tear in his hip labrum. He said he thinks it happened during fall camp last August but he played through the injury last season, unaware of the severity of the injury at the time. It remains to be seen when Pittman will be medically cleared to play. Utah’s receivers room right now includes Devaughn Vele , Money Parks and Mikey Matthews. “Devaughn Vele is the guy that’s our premier weapon on the outside. Money Parks has tremendous speed and a lot of upside. Still too many drops,” Whittingham said. “We’ve got to get those drops worked out. He has good hands; he just needs to concentrate a little bit better. Mikey Mathews just got here a few months ago and he’s doing some really good things.” What does Vele think about the wide receivers group? “I see a lot of growth in our receiver room. There are a lot of younger guys. We need them to step up. There’s a bigger emphasis on them getting reps in spring ball,” he said. “I feel like I’m a big part of that now that I’m the oldest guy in the room. Just helping them understand what’s expected of them. Mikey is bringing a lot of good things to the table. He’s always asking a ton of questions and he’s really bought in. I have high expectations for him as well as all the other guys that have been here.” Florida State wide receiver Mycah Pittman (4) and teammates run to the field before the Cheez-It Bowl against Oklahoma, Thursday, Dec. 29, 2022, in Orlando, Fla.

The Ibrox and Liverpool legend recently exited Sky Sports as a pundit and reports had suggested that he could return to Glasgow in an ambassador role. Bisgrove has confirmed the club spoke with Souness, but the incoming CEO says they were simply routine. He said: \"Graeme doesn't need me to say, but Graeme’s an absolute legend of the football club. He's an icon and I think our strategy will be to make sure that we've got good relationships with a lot of our club legends. \"I spoke earlier this week, I think it was even yesterday to Richard Gough and text with Kevin Thomson and Craig Moore so it's important that we've got those touch points with people that are so, so important to the clubs' history. \"Graeme was in Glasgow for a private engagement and dropped in for a coffee. It was an informal conversation because we want to maintain that relationship. \"Hopefully, in the future, he'll be involved in more opportunities in an ambassadorial sense. I think that's for Graeme to decide but I think the extent of the rumours probably went a little bit further than the reality on that one.\" Asked if he had discussed an ambassadorial role with him, Bisgrove added: \"Not specifically. As I said, it was an informal chance just to reconnect because Graeme happened to be in Glasgow and he loves to come into Ibrox. We had a coffee, we had a great conversation and that was all for now. \"I think as I've said, for all of the ex-players, you look at John Greig, the greatest ever Ranger is still there every day on a match day. To have our ex-players that are supportive of the club is important because they understand the club, the supporters connect with them so absolutely we want to make sure we keep those relationships strong.\"","pubDate":"2023-05-19 13:51:52","image_url":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/14466080/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"heraldscotland","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Historic Stadium Reopens in One of Sports’ Best Comeback Stories","link":"https://www.si.com/mlb/2023/05/19/hinchliffe-stadium-negro-leagues-reopens-paterson-daily-cover","keywords":["Features","HP Feature","MLB","Daily Cover"],"creator":["Tom Verducci"],"video_url":null,"description":"As one of only two surviving Negro Leagues ballparks, Hinchliffe Stadium gives tangible, meaningful honor to an important chapter in U.S. history.","content":"A stadium is a factory of inspiration. Lay some sod, turf or cinder, mark its boundaries with appropriate exactness, and let loose the human will—the need—to test our physical boundaries.At their best, these secular cathedrals also inspire those who sit in the stands that ring these fields of endeavors. They become our town halls, in which the mere act of being there makes us a part of the community—and from which the community draws identity.On the afternoon of Sept. 18, 1932, Paterson, N.J., Mayor John V. Hinchliffe officially dedicated a grand Art Deco piece of architectural inspiration for his diverse and industrious city. “On ground sacred to this city,” as the Paterson Morning Call reported, Hinchliffe had the honor of opening a stadium in his family’s name. With its white-washed concrete walls, red terracotta roof tiles and five gabled towers, Hinchliffe Stadium made for an elegant horseshoe of dreams.“It not only affords the opportunities for physical development and entertainment for the thousands who enjoy physical contests,” Hinchliffe told the crowd that day, “but it will serve as well as a civic center, as an ideal place for public entertainment of all kinds on a large scale.” Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network The mayor boasted that 70% of the city’s population lived within a 15-minute walk of the stadium. Hinchliffe Stadium served its civic role well, especially as home to Negro Leagues baseball, the embodiment of opportunity for those otherwise denied it. Over four rollicking decades, everyone from Josh Gibson to Jim Thorpe to Vince Lombardi to Lou Costello to Duke Ellington to thousands of high school athletes, including me, played there—until urban decay and financial neglect left the old gem a crumbling, weed-and-graffiti-covered forgotten eyesore.What was lost has been found again. On Friday, Andre Sayegh, the second-term Paterson mayor, will proudly reopen Hinchliffe Stadium with the same hope Hinchliffe did 91 years ago. Both mayors were driving forces in the making of the stadium as a center of civic pride.It is the best kind of sports story: the comeback. And it is the best kind of urban renewal: honoring a history of opportunity by coming together to make it happen all over again for a new generation and beyond.As one of only two surviving Negro Leagues ballparks (Rickwood Field in Birmingham is the other), Hinchliffe is a National Historic Landmark that gives tangible, meaningful honor to an important chapter in U.S. history. It is once again a living history book whose story needs to be told. On this bluff 400 feet from Paterson’s stunning 71-foot Great Falls that once inspired Alexander Hamilton to envision the first planned industrial city in America, Hinchliffe served as home to the New York Black Yankees from 1933 to ’37 and ’39 to ’45, and the New York Black Cubans from ’35 to ’36.The “sacred grounds” back then referred to an area known as Monument Heights because of a cemetery and a Civil War monument located on that bluff. Ninety-one years later, these are the sacred grounds where more than 20 future Hall of Famers once played, including Gibson, Paterson native Larry Doby, Monte Irvin, “Cool Papa” Bell, Judy Johnson and Satchel Paige. It is likely Jackie Robinson also played there with the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs. The New Jersey Jackals, an independent team, will move from nearby Little Falls to play at Hinchliffe Stadium.Chris Pedota, NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network Baseball will again be played at Hinchliffe. The New Jersey Jackals, an independent team, will move there from nearby Little Falls. Their owner, Al Dorso, is a Paterson native. It will be the first professional baseball played there since 1950—and the first professional ball games played within the confines of a U.S. National Park (Paterson Great Falls). Hinchliffe also will again host school and amateur events, including ball games, graduations and concerts. High school ballplayers will be able to play on the same grounds and within the same walls as Negro Leagues legends. Hinchliffe will become the gathering place and source of pride it was for so many years. Sixteen miles from New York City, Paterson is a melting pot of 157,000 people over nine square miles, making it the second-most densely populated city in the country. The arc of Hinchliffe is the arc of Paterson, a city once known as “Silk City.” In the 1880s, Paterson manufactured half of all silk made in the U.S. It later transitioned to manufacturing airplane engines. The stadium’s prominence rose and fell with the city’s fortunes. It rises again as a monument to community will.The Hinchliffe story begins amid the Great Depression, when local leaders caught the energy of a stadium building boom as sports rose in importance in 1920s America. The Olmsted brothers, sons of famed architect Frederick Law Olmsted, were hired as landscape architects of the public works project. John Shaw of the local Fanning and Shaw architectural firm, known for its schools and churches, designed the stadium. With its gabled towers and bronze relief representations of Olympic athletes crafted by Paterson sculptor Gaetano Federici, Shaw chose an Art Deco/moderne style with a wink toward classical to inspire young athletes.The stadium unofficially opened in July 1932 around celebrations of George Washington’s bicentennial birthday. The first games were a doubleheader between the Paterson Professionals and the House of David, the legendary bearded team from Michigan. The name “Hinchliffe City Stadium” was chosen at the September dedication to honor Mayor Hinchliffe and his uncle, also named John Hinchliffe, who had also served as mayor of Paterson and made his fortune in Paterson’s booming brewery business before Prohibition.For the next four decades Hinchliffe Stadium served diverse populations as a bustling social, cultural, athletic and educational hub. (Central High students would gather for a graduation picture on the field while spelling out the last two digits of their graduation year in the manner of a band formation.)Negro Leagues games were important from the start. In its second year, Hinchliffe hosted the 1933 Colored Championship of the Nation, the equivalent of a Negro Leagues World Series, with the Philadelphia All-Stars prevailing over the Black Yankees and Pittsburgh Crawfords. Hinchliffe also hosted numerous barnstorming games, including Thorpe and his Oklahoma Indians; the 1933 Pirates, with six Hall of Famers, including coach Honus Wagner, who was discovered by scouts while playing in Paterson in 1896; and Dizzy Dean and the 1934 Cardinals 10 days after they won the World Series.The beehive of activity also hosted amateur and professional football (which is how Lombardi came to play there), auto racing, boxing, track and field, rodeo, concerts (Ellington, Paterson-born Costello, The Andrews Sisters, and Sly and the Family Stone made appearances), civic festivals and high school sports. When Central played Eastside in the first Thanksgiving football game played at Hinchliffe, in 1932, a crowd of 13,000 attended, a few thousand past capacity thanks to additional temporary bleachers and standing room areas.Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey attended Diamond Gloves amateur boxing tournaments in the 1930s and ’40s. The Bambino came to Hinchliffe in 1939, ’43, ’46 and ’47, when The Morning Call noted he was “recovering from a serious illness.” He died 13 months later.

The school district reoriented the baseball diamond, which used to face the open end of the horseshoe and toward the Great Falls, rendering right field too short for competitive play. Through the ’70s and ’80s, Paterson, like many cities built on an industrial economy in an increasingly mobile society, suffered through hard financial times. The schools didn’t have the finances to maintain a 10,000-seat stadium.I played a high school football game at Hinchliffe in 1977 for Seton Hall Prep. We beat Eastside, 26–0. Playing inside the horseshoe felt like exploring an abandoned mansion; you could see the neglect, but you could feel the grandeur and history. It was an honor to play in that hallowed space, regardless of its condition.In 1983, in a last gasp of renewal, the Paterson schools invested in Astroturf and a urethane surface for the track. A sinkhole opened in the outfield (one in the infield had troubled the place from the start). The turf quickly faded and grew tattered. Meanwhile, in ’85, just 19 miles away, Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, where Robinson played his first game with the Dodgers’ Montreal farm team in ’46, was demolished.The bulldozers seemed bound for Hinchliffe next. By 1992, Paterson schools were in receivership to the State of New Jersey. There was no money to keep up the old stadium. School leaders in ’94 threatened it with demolition. In ’96 they closed it.Hinchliffe almost died not by bulldozer but by neglect. Its carcass became a visual cacophony of weeds, climbing vines, crumbling concrete and graffiti. No one even noticed the theft of two bronze plaques dedicated to local athletes, including Paterson’s 100-yard national sprint champion, Eleanor Egg Krattiger, “the fastest woman in the world,” until they turned up years later in a pawn shop.The effort to revive Hinchliffe began in the early 2000s with a grassroots campaign when the Paterson Historical Preservation Committee petitioned in ’03 to include Hinchliffe on the list of National Register of Historic Places. Under “Areas of Significance,” per the form’s instructions, the committee wrote “Entertainment/Recreation” and “Ethnic Heritage—African American.” Under “Significant Person,” they wrote “Larry Doby,” the “Silk City Slugger” who became the first player to integrate the American League. The group won Historic Place status for Hinchliffe in ’04.In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, which designated the Great Falls as a National Historic Park and included a mandate to assess “options for the preservation of Hinchliffe Stadium.”Four years later, Hinchliffe was named a National Historic Landmark (NHL), becoming the first site of any kind associated with the Negro Leagues to gain the designation, the first baseball stadium so designated (Wrigley Field was added in 2020) and only the fourth football stadium (after Harvard Stadium, the Rose Bowl and the Yale Bowl).In 2014 a group called Friends of Hinchliffe Stadium asked for volunteers to come out one day to pull weeds and paint over graffiti. Eight hundred people turned out. Five years later, Sayegh, who was raised in Paterson and is the city’s first Arab American mayor, proposed $18.7 million in funds to reopen Hinchliffe. Two years later, under the determination of the Hinchliffe Master Urban Renewal project, ground broke on a $109 million renovation, which includes 76 housing units and is funded mostly with state tax credits. Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, who was raised in the city, was integral in pushing for the renovation project to be approved. Kyle Mazza/NurPhoto/AP Last year, Chuck Muth, 67, a former soft drink executive who grew up in Paterson, donated $5 million to his alma mater, Montclair State, to build a museum at Hinchliffe dedicated to the Negro Leagues and the stadium’s history. Their stories will be told.When Paterson applied for its NHL designation, its nomination noted that despite “years of vacancy and vandalism,” Hinchliffe remained remarkably intact, “if not the most intact” of stadiums associated with Negro Leagues baseball.The nomination went on:“The ultimate test for integrity for Hinchliffe Stadium is whether members of the New York Black Yankees, or Newark Eagles, or Cuban Stars, Bacharach Giants, Pittsburgh Crawfords, or any of the other teams that played there, or the spectators, or participants in the other sporting events of the 1930s would recognize the place if they were able to return. Undoubtedly, they would.”How wonderful that all these years later we can recognize the place not just for its physical beauty but also for its historical significance. It took 27 years, but Hinchliffe is back. Its revival is not just about perseverance. It’s also about civil rights, opportunity, history and community and political willpower. And it’s about how the physical space of a stadium can still bond and inspire us.On Friday, Sayegh can borrow the same line Mayor Hinchliffe used 91 years ago on these sacred grounds: “This athletic field will serve the interests of Paterson and its people long after the youngest among us has passed on.”","pubDate":"2023-05-19 12:30:49","image_url":"https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Cw_620/MTk4MDU1NTQ5MjAyMzQzMTAy/dcovhinchliffe_h.jpg","source_id":"si","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"}]}
