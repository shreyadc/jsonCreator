Barrow travelled the 665-mile round trip to face Maidstone United in the second round of the cup on Saturday.

A statement by the club read: “Following today’s Emirates FA Cup defeat away to Maidstone United the club would like to issue the following statement. “Bluebirds your support has been amazing this season, to have 220 of you make the trip down to Maidstone today was incredible, and we’re really sorry we didn’t give you the result you deserved. “The club is naturally disappointed with today’s loss and as a result, would like to refund all the travelling fans’ tickets.” Barrow’ statement added: “Once again we’re sorry we couldn’t give you the result you deserved, see you back at Holker Street next week for another big game.” However, some fans didn’t respond positively to the gesture, claiming the money should be donated to greater causes ahead of the festive season, one comment read: “Rather this got donated to a good cause of some sort. we can’t be getting a refund just because the team didn’t play well. great gesture from the club but unnecessary IMHO.” A second said: “Nice gesture. Been a disastrous journey from the bus breaking down at Knutsford. (One of those things). The result is football and is just \"one of those bumps in the road\" - Donate the sum of today's tickets to the Fortywinks sleepover at HS next week.” While a third added: “Rough day out, but no need to refund. Donate to the sleep out or food bank please.” With a fourth suggesting: “Donate it all to the food bank appeal.” Maidstone will learn their third round fate on Sunday afternoon as and Championship clubs enter the FA Cup for the first time this season.

Dwight McNeil’s goal was the difference between the sides, but Shearer could not believe that a penalty was not given after Abdoulaye Doucoure pulled Ryan Yates’s shirt in the box. “It’s not too dissimilar to what happened last week between Brighton and Forest,” Shearer said on (2 December). “One went for them one went against them last week. This is what drives footballers, coaches, managers and fans mad, the lack of consistency. Because last week this was a penalty. “How is that not? You can’t be giving a penalty one week for pulling and not the next week. Clearly he’s pulled his shirt there. That’s a penalty for me.” Everton fans feel they have been very unlucky in recent times following the 10-point Premier League deduction handed to the club. After plenty of hard work on and off the pitch, the Toffees plummeted from 14th place to 19th place in the league table following the immediate punishment. And after losing 3-0 at home to Manchester United in their first game since the sanction, Sean Dyche’s side have now climbed one spot to 18th thanks to the three points at the City Ground. But perhaps they can count themselves lucky this time around, with Everton midfielder Doucoure having his hands all over Yates in the penalty box. Despite the incident taking place right in front of the referee, no penalty was given, much to the frustration of Yates and his manager Steve Cooper. Dyche will surely focus on the points rather than that incident, but the Toffees boss will perhaps be well aware of how his team got away with one in Nottingham.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 10:40:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2022/05/resized-image-Promo-1024x703.jpeg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6fae6710719b63b2e19828ce527e58f7","title":"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino reveals he held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as £115m midfielder looks to improve his form after inconsistent start","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12819821/Chelsea-Mauricio-Pochettino-meeting-Moises-Caicedo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Ecuador international's progress hasn't been helped by the fact that he frequently has to travel to South America for international duty.","content":"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino reveals he held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as £115m midfielder looks to improve his form after inconsistent start Mauricio Pochettino held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo Chelsea midfielder Caicedo is looking for consistency after move from Brighton We expected perfection from VAR - we haven't got it: Listen to It's All Kicking Off By Jeorge Bird For Mailonline Published: 05:39 EST, 3 December 2023 | Updated: 05:39 EST, 3 December 2023 e-mail View comments Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he has held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as the midfielder looks to improve his form. Caicedo joined Chelsea from Brighton for a fee that could rise to £115million in a British record transfer but he has struggled for consistency so far. The Ecuador international's progress hasn't been helped by the fact that he frequently has to travel to South America for international duty. In addition, Caicedo has had to contend with a knee problem and Pochettino stressed that he needs to be given time to hit the heights that he reached at Brighton. Pochettino said: 'Before this press conference, he was in my office for twenty minutes. It is easy because we speak Spanish. It is a subconscious process and that is a problem - only in time can you adapt.'

'We had no pre-season with him. We talk about footballers; it is physical and mental, and there is the talent. If you want to express your talent, you need to be clear in your mind and be good in your legs; otherwise, it is not possible to move.' 'Travelling to South America is tough, two or three weeks with us - 25 or 30 days - and then away for 10 or 12 days. 'Then, he came back with some issues with his knee. That didn't help. It is not an excuse; it is the reality - we need time.' Caicedo has made 14 appearances for Chelsea so far and hopes that he will soon be able to turn a corner in terms of producing more consistent performances. When he was at Brighton Caicedo demonstrated what he is capable of as he frequently broke up play to excellent effect and was also able to launch attacks. With Chelsea still going through a period of transition as a team, Caicedo hasn't come in to a settled side, which has made matters difficult for him. On Sunday Chelsea host Brighton, which could see Caicedo take on his former club. Caicedo often has to travel long distances when representing Ecuador on international duty IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

Публикуваме позицията на Димитров без редакторска намеса: \"До футболната общественост Декларация от ръководството на ФК Миньор Перник Приятели, В събота вечер името на нашия клуб бе замесено в изключително неприятен случай и Миньор Перник бе превърнат в страна в един конфликт, който е сериозен проблем за българския футбол. Ще си позволим да цитираме изпълнителния директор на ПФК Локомотив Пловдив Павел Колев, който след мача с Левски направи разкрития за финансовото състояние на клуба и заяви: “За съжаление често средствата, които Локомотив Пловдив успя да генерира, не влизаха в Локомотив Пловдив. Въпреки моите настоявания, да разбера къде отиват тези пари, не получих отговори. Единствено за част от сумите, които ми беше казано, че се дават на Миньор Перник на заем и щели да бъдат върнати. Тези средства в Локомотив Пловдив не съм ги видял”. Ние, от Миньор Перник искрено съжаляваме да чуем това и съчувстваме на феновете, футболистите, треньорите и служителите в Локомотив Пловдив, но категорично заявяваме, че Павел Колев е бил заблуден от своите началници и ФК Миньор Перник не дължи пари на клуба, ръководителите му и техните фирми. В тази връзка бихме искали да внесем яснота по казуса и да споделим малко фактология. Не е тайна, че допреди месец двата клуба бяха ръководени от една и съща бизнес структура. Когато през декември миналата година нейни представители поеха властта на “Стадиона на мира”, те влязоха в изряден от финансово естество клуб, който имаше нула лева задължения, а предстоеше в клубната каса да влязат три транша от трансфера на Емил Ценов във ФК ЦСКА 1948 София, които се равняваха на приблизително 80 хиляди лева. При тяхното управление, което продължи около 10 месеца отборът изпадна във В група, а преди месец, когато бе извършена смяна в Управителния съвет не бе направен финансов отчет. Оказа, че Миньор Перник дължи на служителите си, на отделни институции, фирми и контрагенти сумата от около 200 хиляди лева. Проверката показа, че освен неизплатени от месец юли насам хонорари и премии, предишното ръководство не бе изпълнило финансовите си ангажименти към НАП, полиция, медицински лица, хотели, Община Перник… По време на това управление бе сключен договор и с близка до тези бизнес кръгове фирма “Fuel Card”, като там също не бяха погасени никакви задължения и в момента те висят на клуба, а изчистването им остана в сферата на обещаното, но неизпълнено. Новото ръководство, заедно със спонсори, Общинската управа и всички, които обичат Миньор Перник се заеха с тежката задача да погасят тези задължения, като ще направим всичко по силите ни това да не окаже влияние на спортните цели поставени пред отбора, а именно завръщане в професионалния футбол. Единственото ни желание е името на клуба да не бива замесвано в подобни конфликти.

It's crazy this fight is being staged outdoors in February - The Hook By James Cohen For Mailonline Published: 05:35 EST, 3 December 2023 | Updated: 05:35 EST, 3 December 2023 e-mail View comments While Ian Machado Garry would have wanted to focus on his upcoming fight at UFC 296, the Irishman has been making headlines for other reasons of late. The UFC welterweight star, 26 and his wife, Layla Machado Garry (formerly Layla Anna-Lee), 40, have been the centre of debate in the MMA world in the past week, after online users brought up 'How to Be a WAG'. The tongue-in-cheek audiobook released by Layla back in 2010 claims it is a 'guide to catching the man of your dreams' - which caused a stir on social media in the past week. Fans and other MMA stars began giving their two cents on Machado Garry's relationship with the TV sports presenter, who is 14 years his senior. Here, Mail Sport takes a look at how the pair have come under the spotlight in the MMA world. Ian Machado Garry and his wife, Layla, have been the centre of debate in the MMA world throughout the past week Fans online have commented on the relationship between the UFC star and TV sports presenter - Machado Garry's other half has a tattoo of his fighter name. Fans have been interested in Layla's ex-husband, Richard Cullen (middle right), working closely with Machado Garry as his nutritionist Spotify Privacy Policy Despite the upcoming UFC card being headlined by Leon Edwards and Colby Covington, it's Machado Garry and his wife who have dominated MMA discussions this week. Many suggested that Layla's 'book' was essentially a guide for gold diggers and also pointed out the fact that the 40-year-old is 14 years Garry's senior. However, Layla, who works as a TV sports presenter, took to Instagram to respond to the backlash in a statement last week. She said: 'I wrote a book called 'How to be a WAG'. Now, that statement itself is a little bit of a stretch. I can hardly call myself an author of an 11-page audible-only satire story that was written in 2010. 'That context is key because that was during the FIFA World Cup when I was working at OK and various different gossip mags. We were creating this hilarious satire and look at wives and girlfriends in football. 'That satirical book, if you listen to it, is really silly and anybody who takes it as fact has completely missed the mark. 'At the time, it was a huge success. It went out, it was funny, and people got the joke.' On Amazon , the description for the book reads: 'How to be a WAG - the ultimate guide to catching the man of your dreams! 'The hot new career option is to be a WAG, and we're here to tell you how to become part of the most prestigious Wives and Girlfriends (WAGs) club. 'Ever dreamed of walking in the footsteps of the likes of Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Cole, or Coleen Rooney? This guide has everything you need to know!' Layla took to Instagram to respond to backlash over a book written in 2010 Layla drew criticism after her book titled 'How to be a WAG' re-surfaced on social media The Machado Garrys changed their names to include Layla's original Brazilian surname and it was previously explained by Megan Olivi on a UFC broadcast. She said: 'His wife, Layla, is Brazilian and Machado was her last name. She has a son who also has Machado in his name. 'And now that she's expecting a child with Garry, they wanted to make sure that the brothers had a name in common. So that they felt they were allone big family with co-parenting.' 'So they all added it to their name so that none feels left out.' By Layla's own admission, her and Machado Garry's relationship was only intended as a 'one-night stand' but ended up kick-starting something more long term. In another video that appeared on her social media , she said: 'I'm one of those girls that's terrible at being single. I end up in relationships when I didn't want to. 'This was meant to be a one-night stand! That was the agreement but we've never left!' Machado Garry, similarly, took to his Instagram account to release a clip from his yet to be released documentary which saw the couple address the recent comments. In the clip , Garry said: 'I'm sorry but no... I love you and I will be there for you in so much of life but I have zero time for this s***. If it's true, I'd sit down and say 'right, we need to talk about it'. 'If you were a controlling and manipulative b****, if you had control of my funds, if you were so controlling that I didn't have a choice, if you were a WAG, if any of these things were remotely true, I'd sit down and have a conversation with you first. 'But if it's some fat w***** with a beard talking online and he wants to make a podcast about it, let the **** be'. Machado Garry and Layla got married in February 2022 before welcoming their son into the world in October last year. While it's Machado Garry's first marriage, Layla was previously married to Richard Cullen, who is the star's current nutritionist.

Following the end of their relationship, she began seeing Garry. Rumours were also circulating online that suggested that Cullen, who has been part of Garry's team since 2021, still lived with the couple. However, Layla also addressed that rumour and quickly debunked it. 'Some bulls*** things that people have been saying [is] that my ex-husband lives with us. No he doesn't! And no he never has. You're just making that up,' she said. Machado Garry himself also recently came out and addressed the rumours in a post onto his social media accounts this week. The welterweight star took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say: 'Madness spreading. If it sounds like it can't be true it probably isn't.' Despite stating that the rumours aren't true, that hasn't stopped a number of other MMA stars from chiming in and giving their thoughts on the matter. UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland is one of the combat stars to make numerous comments on the situation, where he labelled Anna-Lee a 'predator'. Taking to X , Strickland wrote: 'Ian Garry's wife is a SEXUAL PREDATOR. She sought out a young athlete to seduce because she's getting old and still wanted to be famous. 'No buddy of fame wanted you so you preyed on a kid... You are and will forever be known as a succubus...' UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland weighed in on the recent controversy Layla debunked the rumour that Cullen still lives with herself and Garry In another post, he wrote: 'I want to be clear..... I didn't bring Ian's predator into this conversation.... He did, when you let her design that shirt of Geof Neil's mug shot you did.. Be a man shut her up and put her in the kitchen. Act like a b**** get treated like a b****.' Machado Garry and his wife caused controversy prior to the Irish star's fight with Geoff Neal - which never came to fruition due to an injury for the American - after the couple printed Neal's mugshot on T-shirts. It's a move that drew backlash from many in the MMA community, with Neal - a long-term fighter in the UFC - being a popular figure within the company. If Strickland's comments weren't enough, Machado Garry will be far from pleased from Dillon Danis' recent trouble-stirring post on social media. Danis took to X, earlier this week, to share chat messages from 2018 with the wife of UFC star Machado Garry. Danis, in the build-up to his crossover boxing bout with Logan Paul in October, developed a reputation for his internet trolling of Paul 's fiancée Nina Agdal . The MMA star shared several explicit pictures of his rival's fiancée - some of which appeared to be edited - along with snaps of her cozying up to previous partners. While he didn't have the same level of 'ammunition' in his attack on the fighter and Layla, the jiu-jitsu star's latest post will not have sat well with the Irishman. Danis shared a screenshot of their Instagram messages which showed his wife, sending a 'praying' emoji to Danis. He responded: 'Where u from'. She replied: 'England but half Brazilian. How are you today?'. Danis said: 'Very cool, doing great. Where do you live?'. Dillon Danis returned to social media to troll the wife of UFC star Machado Garry Danis shared pictures of an old chat between himself and Layla back in 2018 He captioned the post on X, formerly known as Twitter, by saying: 'Morning' with a heart emoji afterwards. Danis, one day later, then asked his followers: 'Do I show the rest?'. Ironically, Danis is a former sparring partner for UFC and Irish legend Conor McGregor, who Machado Garry has often been compared to in the past. McGregor has previously been labelled as a controversial figure and is reportedly under investigation by Irish police for allegedly 'inciting hate' around the Dublin riots, having blasted the country's government on social media. Machado Garry linked up with the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion for a quick sparring session back in September. It came as part of Machado Garry's preparation for his fight with Vicente Luque at UFC 296 on December 16th, when he will look to extend his perfect 13-0 professional MMA record. Earlier this month, British star Paddy Pimblett took aim at Machado Garry and shutdown talks of his chances at winning gold in the UFC. 'The Baddy' dismissed the idea that Machado Garry could be given a title shot and claimed the Irishman was knocked out by UFC champion Leon Edwards in training - which has been flatly denied by Garry. Edwards, who defends his title at UFC 296 against Colby Covington , has trained with Machado Garry in Birmingham and could well fight him in the future given the 25-year-old's rapid rise. Paddy Pimblett dismissed the idea that Machado Garry should be given a welterweight title shot 'The Baddy' claimed that Leon Edwards knocked Machado Garry out in training - which has since been denied Machado Garry revealed last month that he was cast out of Edwards' gym, Team Renegade. When asked about Machado Garry, Pimblett said: 'Ian Garry doesn't deserve a title shot, lad, come on. Leon's already knocked him out in training so we don't need to know about that.' Last year, Machado Garry posted a candid video on his social media on the way back from the dentist after Edwards had landed a kick in sparring that hurt his tooth. Machado Garry denies that the kick knocked him out and recently spoke about no longer being allowed to train at Team Renegade. He told the Independent: 'Leon Edwards, his head coach asked me not to come back to Renegade; told me I'm not allowed to train there. 'Leon and his head coach had an issue with me training on the mats and recently have asked me not to train there, because, 'Leon doesn't want any insecurities or doubts on his own mats, within the gym,' which I don't fully understand. 'I get that we're both in the top 10 and you might see me as a threat, but I'm not a threat to you right now; I'm not fighting for the title right now. 'His coach said the words: 'Ian is a threat, I cannot have Leon having any doubts or insecurities.'

Dwight McNeil’s goal was the difference between the sides, but Shearer could not believe that a penalty was not given after Abdoulaye Doucoure pulled Ryan Yates’s shirt in the box. “It’s not too dissimilar to what happened last week between Brighton and Forest,” Shearer said on (2 December). “One went for them one went against them last week. This is what drives footballers, coaches, managers and fans mad, the lack of consistency. Because last week this was a penalty. “How is that not? You can’t be giving a penalty one week for pulling and not the next week. Clearly he’s pulled his shirt there. That’s a penalty for me.” Everton fans feel they have been very unlucky in recent times following the 10-point Premier League deduction handed to the club. After plenty of hard work on and off the pitch, the Toffees plummeted from 14th place to 19th place in the league table following the immediate punishment. And after losing 3-0 at home to Manchester United in their first game since the sanction, Sean Dyche’s side have now climbed one spot to 18th thanks to the three points at the City Ground. But perhaps they can count themselves lucky this time around, with Everton midfielder Doucoure having his hands all over Yates in the penalty box. Despite the incident taking place right in front of the referee, no penalty was given, much to the frustration of Yates and his manager Steve Cooper. Dyche will surely focus on the points rather than that incident, but the Toffees boss will perhaps be well aware of how his team got away with one in Nottingham.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 10:40:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2022/05/resized-image-Promo-1024x703.jpeg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6fae6710719b63b2e19828ce527e58f7","title":"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino reveals he held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as £115m midfielder looks to improve his form after inconsistent start","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12819821/Chelsea-Mauricio-Pochettino-meeting-Moises-Caicedo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Ecuador international's progress hasn't been helped by the fact that he frequently has to travel to South America for international duty.","content":"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino reveals he held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as £115m midfielder looks to improve his form after inconsistent start Mauricio Pochettino held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo Chelsea midfielder Caicedo is looking for consistency after move from Brighton We expected perfection from VAR - we haven't got it: Listen to It's All Kicking Off By Jeorge Bird For Mailonline Published: 05:39 EST, 3 December 2023 | Updated: 05:39 EST, 3 December 2023 e-mail View comments Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he has held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as the midfielder looks to improve his form. Caicedo joined Chelsea from Brighton for a fee that could rise to £115million in a British record transfer but he has struggled for consistency so far. The Ecuador international's progress hasn't been helped by the fact that he frequently has to travel to South America for international duty. In addition, Caicedo has had to contend with a knee problem and Pochettino stressed that he needs to be given time to hit the heights that he reached at Brighton. Pochettino said: 'Before this press conference, he was in my office for twenty minutes. It is easy because we speak Spanish. It is a subconscious process and that is a problem - only in time can you adapt.'

'We had no pre-season with him. We talk about footballers; it is physical and mental, and there is the talent. If you want to express your talent, you need to be clear in your mind and be good in your legs; otherwise, it is not possible to move.' 'Travelling to South America is tough, two or three weeks with us - 25 or 30 days - and then away for 10 or 12 days. 'Then, he came back with some issues with his knee. That didn't help. It is not an excuse; it is the reality - we need time.' Caicedo has made 14 appearances for Chelsea so far and hopes that he will soon be able to turn a corner in terms of producing more consistent performances. When he was at Brighton Caicedo demonstrated what he is capable of as he frequently broke up play to excellent effect and was also able to launch attacks. With Chelsea still going through a period of transition as a team, Caicedo hasn't come in to a settled side, which has made matters difficult for him. On Sunday Chelsea host Brighton, which could see Caicedo take on his former club. Caicedo often has to travel long distances when representing Ecuador on international duty IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

Публикуваме позицията на Димитров без редакторска намеса: \"До футболната общественост Декларация от ръководството на ФК Миньор Перник Приятели, В събота вечер името на нашия клуб бе замесено в изключително неприятен случай и Миньор Перник бе превърнат в страна в един конфликт, който е сериозен проблем за българския футбол. Ще си позволим да цитираме изпълнителния директор на ПФК Локомотив Пловдив Павел Колев, който след мача с Левски направи разкрития за финансовото състояние на клуба и заяви: “За съжаление често средствата, които Локомотив Пловдив успя да генерира, не влизаха в Локомотив Пловдив. Въпреки моите настоявания, да разбера къде отиват тези пари, не получих отговори. Единствено за част от сумите, които ми беше казано, че се дават на Миньор Перник на заем и щели да бъдат върнати. Тези средства в Локомотив Пловдив не съм ги видял”. Ние, от Миньор Перник искрено съжаляваме да чуем това и съчувстваме на феновете, футболистите, треньорите и служителите в Локомотив Пловдив, но категорично заявяваме, че Павел Колев е бил заблуден от своите началници и ФК Миньор Перник не дължи пари на клуба, ръководителите му и техните фирми. В тази връзка бихме искали да внесем яснота по казуса и да споделим малко фактология. Не е тайна, че допреди месец двата клуба бяха ръководени от една и съща бизнес структура. Когато през декември миналата година нейни представители поеха властта на “Стадиона на мира”, те влязоха в изряден от финансово естество клуб, който имаше нула лева задължения, а предстоеше в клубната каса да влязат три транша от трансфера на Емил Ценов във ФК ЦСКА 1948 София, които се равняваха на приблизително 80 хиляди лева. При тяхното управление, което продължи около 10 месеца отборът изпадна във В група, а преди месец, когато бе извършена смяна в Управителния съвет не бе направен финансов отчет. Оказа, че Миньор Перник дължи на служителите си, на отделни институции, фирми и контрагенти сумата от около 200 хиляди лева. Проверката показа, че освен неизплатени от месец юли насам хонорари и премии, предишното ръководство не бе изпълнило финансовите си ангажименти към НАП, полиция, медицински лица, хотели, Община Перник… По време на това управление бе сключен договор и с близка до тези бизнес кръгове фирма “Fuel Card”, като там също не бяха погасени никакви задължения и в момента те висят на клуба, а изчистването им остана в сферата на обещаното, но неизпълнено. Новото ръководство, заедно със спонсори, Общинската управа и всички, които обичат Миньор Перник се заеха с тежката задача да погасят тези задължения, като ще направим всичко по силите ни това да не окаже влияние на спортните цели поставени пред отбора, а именно завръщане в професионалния футбол. Единственото ни желание е името на клуба да не бива замесвано в подобни конфликти.

The UFC welterweight star, 26 and his wife, Layla Machado Garry (formerly Layla Anna-Lee), 40, have been the centre of debate in the MMA world in the past week, after online users brought up 'How to Be a WAG'. The tongue-in-cheek audiobook released by Layla back in 2010 claims it is a 'guide to catching the man of your dreams' - which caused a stir on social media in the past week. Fans and other MMA stars began giving their two cents on Machado Garry's relationship with the TV sports presenter, who is 14 years his senior. Here, Mail Sport takes a look at how the pair have come under the spotlight in the MMA world. Ian Machado Garry and his wife, Layla, have been the centre of debate in the MMA world throughout the past week Fans online have commented on the relationship between the UFC star and TV sports presenter - Machado Garry's other half has a tattoo of his fighter name. Fans have been interested in Layla's ex-husband, Richard Cullen (middle right), working closely with Machado Garry as his nutritionist Spotify Privacy Policy Despite the upcoming UFC card being headlined by Leon Edwards and Colby Covington, it's Machado Garry and his wife who have dominated MMA discussions this week. Many suggested that Layla's 'book' was essentially a guide for gold diggers and also pointed out the fact that the 40-year-old is 14 years Garry's senior. However, Layla, who works as a TV sports presenter, took to Instagram to respond to the backlash in a statement last week. She said: 'I wrote a book called 'How to be a WAG'. Now, that statement itself is a little bit of a stretch. I can hardly call myself an author of an 11-page audible-only satire story that was written in 2010. 'That context is key because that was during the FIFA World Cup when I was working at OK and various different gossip mags. We were creating this hilarious satire and look at wives and girlfriends in football. 'That satirical book, if you listen to it, is really silly and anybody who takes it as fact has completely missed the mark. 'At the time, it was a huge success. It went out, it was funny, and people got the joke.' On Amazon , the description for the book reads: 'How to be a WAG - the ultimate guide to catching the man of your dreams! 'The hot new career option is to be a WAG, and we're here to tell you how to become part of the most prestigious Wives and Girlfriends (WAGs) club. 'Ever dreamed of walking in the footsteps of the likes of Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Cole, or Coleen Rooney? This guide has everything you need to know!' Layla took to Instagram to respond to backlash over a book written in 2010 Layla drew criticism after her book titled 'How to be a WAG' re-surfaced on social media The Machado Garrys changed their names to include Layla's original Brazilian surname and it was previously explained by Megan Olivi on a UFC broadcast. She said: 'His wife, Layla, is Brazilian and Machado was her last name. She has a son who also has Machado in his name. 'And now that she's expecting a child with Garry, they wanted to make sure that the brothers had a name in common. So that they felt they were allone big family with co-parenting.' 'So they all added it to their name so that none feels left out.' By Layla's own admission, her and Machado Garry's relationship was only intended as a 'one-night stand' but ended up kick-starting something more long term. In another video that appeared on her social media , she said: 'I'm one of those girls that's terrible at being single. I end up in relationships when I didn't want to. 'This was meant to be a one-night stand! That was the agreement but we've never left!' Machado Garry, similarly, took to his Instagram account to release a clip from his yet to be released documentary which saw the couple address the recent comments. In the clip , Garry said: 'I'm sorry but no... I love you and I will be there for you in so much of life but I have zero time for this s***. If it's true, I'd sit down and say 'right, we need to talk about it'. 'If you were a controlling and manipulative b****, if you had control of my funds, if you were so controlling that I didn't have a choice, if you were a WAG, if any of these things were remotely true, I'd sit down and have a conversation with you first. 'But if it's some fat w***** with a beard talking online and he wants to make a podcast about it, let the **** be'. Machado Garry and Layla got married in February 2022 before welcoming their son into the world in October last year. While it's Machado Garry's first marriage, Layla was previously married to Richard Cullen, who is the star's current nutritionist.

Following the end of their relationship, she began seeing Garry. Rumours were also circulating online that suggested that Cullen, who has been part of Garry's team since 2021, still lived with the couple. However, Layla also addressed that rumour and quickly debunked it. 'Some bulls*** things that people have been saying [is] that my ex-husband lives with us. No he doesn't! And no he never has. You're just making that up,' she said. Machado Garry himself also recently came out and addressed the rumours in a post onto his social media accounts this week. The welterweight star took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say: 'Madness spreading. If it sounds like it can't be true it probably isn't.' Despite stating that the rumours aren't true, that hasn't stopped a number of other MMA stars from chiming in and giving their thoughts on the matter. UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland is one of the combat stars to make numerous comments on the situation, where he labelled Anna-Lee a 'predator'. Taking to X , Strickland wrote: 'Ian Garry's wife is a SEXUAL PREDATOR. She sought out a young athlete to seduce because she's getting old and still wanted to be famous. 'No buddy of fame wanted you so you preyed on a kid... You are and will forever be known as a succubus...' UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland weighed in on the recent controversy Layla debunked the rumour that Cullen still lives with herself and Garry In another post, he wrote: 'I want to be clear..... I didn't bring Ian's predator into this conversation.... He did, when you let her design that shirt of Geof Neil's mug shot you did.. Be a man shut her up and put her in the kitchen. Act like a b**** get treated like a b****.' Machado Garry and his wife caused controversy prior to the Irish star's fight with Geoff Neal - which never came to fruition due to an injury for the American - after the couple printed Neal's mugshot on T-shirts. It's a move that drew backlash from many in the MMA community, with Neal - a long-term fighter in the UFC - being a popular figure within the company. If Strickland's comments weren't enough, Machado Garry will be far from pleased from Dillon Danis' recent trouble-stirring post on social media. Danis took to X, earlier this week, to share chat messages from 2018 with the wife of UFC star Machado Garry. Danis, in the build-up to his crossover boxing bout with Logan Paul in October, developed a reputation for his internet trolling of Paul 's fiancée Nina Agdal . The MMA star shared several explicit pictures of his rival's fiancée - some of which appeared to be edited - along with snaps of her cozying up to previous partners. While he didn't have the same level of 'ammunition' in his attack on the fighter and Layla, the jiu-jitsu star's latest post will not have sat well with the Irishman. Danis shared a screenshot of their Instagram messages which showed his wife, sending a 'praying' emoji to Danis. He responded: 'Where u from'. She replied: 'England but half Brazilian. How are you today?'. Danis said: 'Very cool, doing great. Where do you live?'. Dillon Danis returned to social media to troll the wife of UFC star Machado Garry Danis shared pictures of an old chat between himself and Layla back in 2018 He captioned the post on X, formerly known as Twitter, by saying: 'Morning' with a heart emoji afterwards. Danis, one day later, then asked his followers: 'Do I show the rest?'. Ironically, Danis is a former sparring partner for UFC and Irish legend Conor McGregor, who Machado Garry has often been compared to in the past. McGregor has previously been labelled as a controversial figure and is reportedly under investigation by Irish police for allegedly 'inciting hate' around the Dublin riots, having blasted the country's government on social media. Machado Garry linked up with the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion for a quick sparring session back in September. It came as part of Machado Garry's preparation for his fight with Vicente Luque at UFC 296 on December 16th, when he will look to extend his perfect 13-0 professional MMA record. Earlier this month, British star Paddy Pimblett took aim at Machado Garry and shutdown talks of his chances at winning gold in the UFC. 'The Baddy' dismissed the idea that Machado Garry could be given a title shot and claimed the Irishman was knocked out by UFC champion Leon Edwards in training - which has been flatly denied by Garry. Edwards, who defends his title at UFC 296 against Colby Covington , has trained with Machado Garry in Birmingham and could well fight him in the future given the 25-year-old's rapid rise. Paddy Pimblett dismissed the idea that Machado Garry should be given a welterweight title shot 'The Baddy' claimed that Leon Edwards knocked Machado Garry out in training - which has since been denied Machado Garry revealed last month that he was cast out of Edwards' gym, Team Renegade. When asked about Machado Garry, Pimblett said: 'Ian Garry doesn't deserve a title shot, lad, come on. Leon's already knocked him out in training so we don't need to know about that.' Last year, Machado Garry posted a candid video on his social media on the way back from the dentist after Edwards had landed a kick in sparring that hurt his tooth. Machado Garry denies that the kick knocked him out and recently spoke about no longer being allowed to train at Team Renegade. He told the Independent: 'Leon Edwards, his head coach asked me not to come back to Renegade; told me I'm not allowed to train there. 'Leon and his head coach had an issue with me training on the mats and recently have asked me not to train there, because, 'Leon doesn't want any insecurities or doubts on his own mats, within the gym,' which I don't fully understand. 'I get that we're both in the top 10 and you might see me as a threat, but I'm not a threat to you right now; I'm not fighting for the title right now. 'His coach said the words: 'Ian is a threat, I cannot have Leon having any doubts or insecurities.'

A statement by the club read: “Following today’s Emirates FA Cup defeat away to Maidstone United the club would like to issue the following statement. “Bluebirds your support has been amazing this season, to have 220 of you make the trip down to Maidstone today was incredible, and we’re really sorry we didn’t give you the result you deserved. “The club is naturally disappointed with today’s loss and as a result, would like to refund all the travelling fans’ tickets.” Barrow’ statement added: “Once again we’re sorry we couldn’t give you the result you deserved, see you back at Holker Street next week for another big game.” However, some fans didn’t respond positively to the gesture, claiming the money should be donated to greater causes ahead of the festive season, one comment read: “Rather this got donated to a good cause of some sort. we can’t be getting a refund just because the team didn’t play well. great gesture from the club but unnecessary IMHO.” A second said: “Nice gesture.

Dwight McNeil’s goal was the difference between the sides, but Shearer could not believe that a penalty was not given after Abdoulaye Doucoure pulled Ryan Yates’s shirt in the box. “It’s not too dissimilar to what happened last week between Brighton and Forest,” Shearer said on (2 December). “One went for them one went against them last week. This is what drives footballers, coaches, managers and fans mad, the lack of consistency. Because last week this was a penalty. “How is that not? You can’t be giving a penalty one week for pulling and not the next week. Clearly he’s pulled his shirt there. That’s a penalty for me.” Everton fans feel they have been very unlucky in recent times following the 10-point Premier League deduction handed to the club. After plenty of hard work on and off the pitch, the Toffees plummeted from 14th place to 19th place in the league table following the immediate punishment. And after losing 3-0 at home to Manchester United in their first game since the sanction, Sean Dyche’s side have now climbed one spot to 18th thanks to the three points at the City Ground. But perhaps they can count themselves lucky this time around, with Everton midfielder Doucoure having his hands all over Yates in the penalty box. Despite the incident taking place right in front of the referee, no penalty was given, much to the frustration of Yates and his manager Steve Cooper. Dyche will surely focus on the points rather than that incident, but the Toffees boss will perhaps be well aware of how his team got away with one in Nottingham.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 10:40:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2022/05/resized-image-Promo-1024x703.jpeg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6fae6710719b63b2e19828ce527e58f7","title":"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino reveals he held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as £115m midfielder looks to improve his form after inconsistent start","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12819821/Chelsea-Mauricio-Pochettino-meeting-Moises-Caicedo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Ecuador international's progress hasn't been helped by the fact that he frequently has to travel to South America for international duty.","content":"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino reveals he held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as £115m midfielder looks to improve his form after inconsistent start Mauricio Pochettino held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo Chelsea midfielder Caicedo is looking for consistency after move from Brighton We expected perfection from VAR - we haven't got it: Listen to It's All Kicking Off By Jeorge Bird For Mailonline Published: 05:39 EST, 3 December 2023 | Updated: 05:39 EST, 3 December 2023 e-mail View comments Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he has held a one-on-one meeting with Moises Caicedo as the midfielder looks to improve his form. Caicedo joined Chelsea from Brighton for a fee that could rise to £115million in a British record transfer but he has struggled for consistency so far. The Ecuador international's progress hasn't been helped by the fact that he frequently has to travel to South America for international duty. In addition, Caicedo has had to contend with a knee problem and Pochettino stressed that he needs to be given time to hit the heights that he reached at Brighton. Pochettino said: 'Before this press conference, he was in my office for twenty minutes. It is easy because we speak Spanish. It is a subconscious process and that is a problem - only in time can you adapt.'

'We had no pre-season with him. We talk about footballers; it is physical and mental, and there is the talent. If you want to express your talent, you need to be clear in your mind and be good in your legs; otherwise, it is not possible to move.' 'Travelling to South America is tough, two or three weeks with us - 25 or 30 days - and then away for 10 or 12 days. 'Then, he came back with some issues with his knee. That didn't help. It is not an excuse; it is the reality - we need time.' Caicedo has made 14 appearances for Chelsea so far and hopes that he will soon be able to turn a corner in terms of producing more consistent performances. When he was at Brighton Caicedo demonstrated what he is capable of as he frequently broke up play to excellent effect and was also able to launch attacks. With Chelsea still going through a period of transition as a team, Caicedo hasn't come in to a settled side, which has made matters difficult for him.

Публикуваме позицията на Димитров без редакторска намеса: \"До футболната общественост Декларация от ръководството на ФК Миньор Перник Приятели, В събота вечер името на нашия клуб бе замесено в изключително неприятен случай и Миньор Перник бе превърнат в страна в един конфликт, който е сериозен проблем за българския футбол. Ще си позволим да цитираме изпълнителния директор на ПФК Локомотив Пловдив Павел Колев, който след мача с Левски направи разкрития за финансовото състояние на клуба и заяви: “За съжаление често средствата, които Локомотив Пловдив успя да генерира, не влизаха в Локомотив Пловдив. Въпреки моите настоявания, да разбера къде отиват тези пари, не получих отговори. Единствено за част от сумите, които ми беше казано, че се дават на Миньор Перник на заем и щели да бъдат върнати. Тези средства в Локомотив Пловдив не съм ги видял”. Ние, от Миньор Перник искрено съжаляваме да чуем това и съчувстваме на феновете, футболистите, треньорите и служителите в Локомотив Пловдив, но категорично заявяваме, че Павел Колев е бил заблуден от своите началници и ФК Миньор Перник не дължи пари на клуба, ръководителите му и техните фирми. В тази връзка бихме искали да внесем яснота по казуса и да споделим малко фактология. Не е тайна, че допреди месец двата клуба бяха ръководени от една и съща бизнес структура. Когато през декември миналата година нейни представители поеха властта на “Стадиона на мира”, те влязоха в изряден от финансово естество клуб, който имаше нула лева задължения, а предстоеше в клубната каса да влязат три транша от трансфера на Емил Ценов във ФК ЦСКА 1948 София, които се равняваха на приблизително 80 хиляди лева. При тяхното управление, което продължи около 10 месеца отборът изпадна във В група, а преди месец, когато бе извършена смяна в Управителния съвет не бе направен финансов отчет. Оказа, че Миньор Перник дължи на служителите си, на отделни институции, фирми и контрагенти сумата от около 200 хиляди лева. Проверката показа, че освен неизплатени от месец юли насам хонорари и премии, предишното ръководство не бе изпълнило финансовите си ангажименти към НАП, полиция, медицински лица, хотели, Община Перник… По време на това управление бе сключен договор и с близка до тези бизнес кръгове фирма “Fuel Card”, като там също не бяха погасени никакви задължения и в момента те висят на клуба, а изчистването им остана в сферата на обещаното, но неизпълнено. Новото ръководство, заедно със спонсори, Общинската управа и всички, които обичат Миньор Перник се заеха с тежката задача да погасят тези задължения, като ще направим всичко по силите ни това да не окаже влияние на спортните цели поставени пред отбора, а именно завръщане в професионалния футбол. Единственото ни желание е името на клуба да не бива замесвано в подобни конфликти.

It's crazy this fight is being staged outdoors in February - The Hook By James Cohen For Mailonline Published: 05:35 EST, 3 December 2023 | Updated: 05:35 EST, 3 December 2023 e-mail View comments While Ian Machado Garry would have wanted to focus on his upcoming fight at UFC 296, the Irishman has been making headlines for other reasons of late. The UFC welterweight star, 26 and his wife, Layla Machado Garry (formerly Layla Anna-Lee), 40, have been the centre of debate in the MMA world in the past week, after online users brought up 'How to Be a WAG'. The tongue-in-cheek audiobook released by Layla back in 2010 claims it is a 'guide to catching the man of your dreams' - which caused a stir on social media in the past week. Fans and other MMA stars began giving their two cents on Machado Garry's relationship with the TV sports presenter, who is 14 years his senior. Here, Mail Sport takes a look at how the pair have come under the spotlight in the MMA world. Ian Machado Garry and his wife, Layla, have been the centre of debate in the MMA world throughout the past week Fans online have commented on the relationship between the UFC star and TV sports presenter - Machado Garry's other half has a tattoo of his fighter name. Fans have been interested in Layla's ex-husband, Richard Cullen (middle right), working closely with Machado Garry as his nutritionist Spotify Privacy Policy Despite the upcoming UFC card being headlined by Leon Edwards and Colby Covington, it's Machado Garry and his wife who have dominated MMA discussions this week. Many suggested that Layla's 'book' was essentially a guide for gold diggers and also pointed out the fact that the 40-year-old is 14 years Garry's senior. However, Layla, who works as a TV sports presenter, took to Instagram to respond to the backlash in a statement last week. She said: 'I wrote a book called 'How to be a WAG'. Now, that statement itself is a little bit of a stretch. I can hardly call myself an author of an 11-page audible-only satire story that was written in 2010. 'That context is key because that was during the FIFA World Cup when I was working at OK and various different gossip mags. We were creating this hilarious satire and look at wives and girlfriends in football. 'That satirical book, if you listen to it, is really silly and anybody who takes it as fact has completely missed the mark. 'At the time, it was a huge success. It went out, it was funny, and people got the joke.' On Amazon , the description for the book reads: 'How to be a WAG - the ultimate guide to catching the man of your dreams! 'The hot new career option is to be a WAG, and we're here to tell you how to become part of the most prestigious Wives and Girlfriends (WAGs) club. 'Ever dreamed of walking in the footsteps of the likes of Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Cole, or Coleen Rooney? This guide has everything you need to know!' Layla took to Instagram to respond to backlash over a book written in 2010 Layla drew criticism after her book titled 'How to be a WAG' re-surfaced on social media The Machado Garrys changed their names to include Layla's original Brazilian surname and it was previously explained by Megan Olivi on a UFC broadcast. She said: 'His wife, Layla, is Brazilian and Machado was her last name. She has a son who also has Machado in his name. 'And now that she's expecting a child with Garry, they wanted to make sure that the brothers had a name in common. So that they felt they were allone big family with co-parenting.' 'So they all added it to their name so that none feels left out.' By Layla's own admission, her and Machado Garry's relationship was only intended as a 'one-night stand' but ended up kick-starting something more long term. In another video that appeared on her social media , she said: 'I'm one of those girls that's terrible at being single. I end up in relationships when I didn't want to. 'This was meant to be a one-night stand! That was the agreement but we've never left!' Machado Garry, similarly, took to his Instagram account to release a clip from his yet to be released documentary which saw the couple address the recent comments. In the clip , Garry said: 'I'm sorry but no... I love you and I will be there for you in so much of life but I have zero time for this s***. If it's true, I'd sit down and say 'right, we need to talk about it'. 'If you were a controlling and manipulative b****, if you had control of my funds, if you were so controlling that I didn't have a choice, if you were a WAG, if any of these things were remotely true, I'd sit down and have a conversation with you first. 'But if it's some fat w***** with a beard talking online and he wants to make a podcast about it, let the **** be'. Machado Garry and Layla got married in February 2022 before welcoming their son into the world in October last year. While it's Machado Garry's first marriage, Layla was previously married to Richard Cullen, who is the star's current nutritionist.

Following the end of their relationship, she began seeing Garry. Rumours were also circulating online that suggested that Cullen, who has been part of Garry's team since 2021, still lived with the couple. However, Layla also addressed that rumour and quickly debunked it. 'Some bulls*** things that people have been saying [is] that my ex-husband lives with us. No he doesn't! And no he never has. You're just making that up,' she said. Machado Garry himself also recently came out and addressed the rumours in a post onto his social media accounts this week. The welterweight star took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say: 'Madness spreading. If it sounds like it can't be true it probably isn't.' Despite stating that the rumours aren't true, that hasn't stopped a number of other MMA stars from chiming in and giving their thoughts on the matter. UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland is one of the combat stars to make numerous comments on the situation, where he labelled Anna-Lee a 'predator'. Taking to X , Strickland wrote: 'Ian Garry's wife is a SEXUAL PREDATOR. She sought out a young athlete to seduce because she's getting old and still wanted to be famous. 'No buddy of fame wanted you so you preyed on a kid... You are and will forever be known as a succubus...' UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland weighed in on the recent controversy Layla debunked the rumour that Cullen still lives with herself and Garry In another post, he wrote: 'I want to be clear..... I didn't bring Ian's predator into this conversation.... He did, when you let her design that shirt of Geof Neil's mug shot you did.. Be a man shut her up and put her in the kitchen. Act like a b**** get treated like a b****.' Machado Garry and his wife caused controversy prior to the Irish star's fight with Geoff Neal - which never came to fruition due to an injury for the American - after the couple printed Neal's mugshot on T-shirts. It's a move that drew backlash from many in the MMA community, with Neal - a long-term fighter in the UFC - being a popular figure within the company. If Strickland's comments weren't enough, Machado Garry will be far from pleased from Dillon Danis' recent trouble-stirring post on social media. Danis took to X, earlier this week, to share chat messages from 2018 with the wife of UFC star Machado Garry. Danis, in the build-up to his crossover boxing bout with Logan Paul in October, developed a reputation for his internet trolling of Paul 's fiancée Nina Agdal . The MMA star shared several explicit pictures of his rival's fiancée - some of which appeared to be edited - along with snaps of her cozying up to previous partners. While he didn't have the same level of 'ammunition' in his attack on the fighter and Layla, the jiu-jitsu star's latest post will not have sat well with the Irishman. Danis shared a screenshot of their Instagram messages which showed his wife, sending a 'praying' emoji to Danis. He responded: 'Where u from'. She replied: 'England but half Brazilian. How are you today?'. Danis said: 'Very cool, doing great. Where do you live?'. Dillon Danis returned to social media to troll the wife of UFC star Machado Garry Danis shared pictures of an old chat between himself and Layla back in 2018 He captioned the post on X, formerly known as Twitter, by saying: 'Morning' with a heart emoji afterwards. Danis, one day later, then asked his followers: 'Do I show the rest?'. Ironically, Danis is a former sparring partner for UFC and Irish legend Conor McGregor, who Machado Garry has often been compared to in the past. McGregor has previously been labelled as a controversial figure and is reportedly under investigation by Irish police for allegedly 'inciting hate' around the Dublin riots, having blasted the country's government on social media. Machado Garry linked up with the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion for a quick sparring session back in September. It came as part of Machado Garry's preparation for his fight with Vicente Luque at UFC 296 on December 16th, when he will look to extend his perfect 13-0 professional MMA record. Earlier this month, British star Paddy Pimblett took aim at Machado Garry and shutdown talks of his chances at winning gold in the UFC. 'The Baddy' dismissed the idea that Machado Garry could be given a title shot and claimed the Irishman was knocked out by UFC champion Leon Edwards in training - which has been flatly denied by Garry. Edwards, who defends his title at UFC 296 against Colby Covington , has trained with Machado Garry in Birmingham and could well fight him in the future given the 25-year-old's rapid rise. Paddy Pimblett dismissed the idea that Machado Garry should be given a welterweight title shot 'The Baddy' claimed that Leon Edwards knocked Machado Garry out in training - which has since been denied Machado Garry revealed last month that he was cast out of Edwards' gym, Team Renegade. When asked about Machado Garry, Pimblett said: 'Ian Garry doesn't deserve a title shot, lad, come on. Leon's already knocked him out in training so we don't need to know about that.' Last year, Machado Garry posted a candid video on his social media on the way back from the dentist after Edwards had landed a kick in sparring that hurt his tooth. Machado Garry denies that the kick knocked him out and recently spoke about no longer being allowed to train at Team Renegade. He told the Independent: 'Leon Edwards, his head coach asked me not to come back to Renegade; told me I'm not allowed to train there. 'Leon and his head coach had an issue with me training on the mats and recently have asked me not to train there, because, 'Leon doesn't want any insecurities or doubts on his own mats, within the gym,' which I don't fully understand. 'I get that we're both in the top 10 and you might see me as a threat, but I'm not a threat to you right now; I'm not fighting for the title right now. 'His coach said the words: 'Ian is a threat, I cannot have Leon having any doubts or insecurities.'
