La promesse a été tenue. Les Scandinaves ont battu Sam Kerr et sa bande, ce samedi, à Brisbane et remporté la médaille de bronze de la Coupe du monde pour la quatrième fois de l'histoire après 1991, 2011 et 2019. Sorties par l'Espagne en demies, les joueuses de Peter Gerhardsson ont retrouvé leur solidité en ne concédant aucun but et ont, en plus, fait preuve d'efficacité. La première étincelle a été allumée dès la première minute par Stina Blackstenius trouvée par Asllani (1re). L'ancienne Parisienne a été omniprésente durant cette première période avec notamment un centre pour la tête de Fridolina Rolfö, qui a heurté la transversale (27e). Mais quelques secondes plus tôt, Clare Hunt avait déséquilibré Blackstenius dans la surface australienne et après vérification par le VAR, l'arbitre a accordé un penalty aux Scandinaves transformé par Roflö pour son troisième but dans la compétition. Les Suédoises ont continué à mettre la pression par Asllani (40e), Angeldal (45e+2) et Blackstenius (45e+3). Les Australiennes n'ont pas été en reste puisque Hayley Raso a obligé Zecira Musovic à un bel arrêt, à la suite d'un centre impeccable d'Ellie Carpenter (23e). La tête de Katrina Gorry (34e) a été captée par la gardienne suédoise, attentive sur la frappe puissante de Sam Kerr (45e+6). Asllani comme en 2019 La seconde période a été moins riche en occasions mais les Suédoises ont su enfoncer le clou. Déjà buteuse lors du match pour la troisième place en 2019 contre l'Angleterre (2-1), Asllani a remis ça en seconde période sur un bon décalage de Blackstenius (62e), qui avait été trouvée précédemment par l'attaquante de l'AC Milan. La rencontre s'est un peu emballée avec le sauvetage d'Arnold sur une frappe du gauche de Blackstenius (66e) et la reprise à bout pourtant de Polkinghorne, repoussée par Musovic, avec peut-être une main au préalable sur son contrôle (70e). Les 49 461 spectateurs ont néanmoins assisté à la défaite de leur équipe qui, même si elle finit quatrième de son Mondial, termine à la première place dans le coeur d'un public australien totalement conquis par ses Matildas.","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:15:50","image_url":"https://medias.lequipe.fr/img-photo-jpg/la-joie-des-suedoises-troisiemes-du-mondial-australien-amanda-perobelli-reuters/1500000001822628/0:0,1100:550-665-335-70/93c27.jpg","source_id":"lequipe","source_priority":21660,"country":["france"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Edinson Cavani signe son premier but avec Boca Juniors","link":"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Edinson-cavani-signe-son-premier-but-avec-boca-juniors/1414464#xtor=RSS-1","keywords":["Foot, ARG, Boca Juniors"],"creator":["Maxime Dubernet"],"video_url":null,"description":"À 36 ans et pour son deuxième match avec Boca Juniors (Argentine), Edinson Cavani a ouvert son compteur avec ses nouvelles couleurs contre Platense (3-1) dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi.","content":"Quelques jours , Edinson Cavani (36 ans) a inscrit son premier but avec Boca Juniors lors de la victoire aisée sur Platense (3-1) lors de la première journée de la 2e phase du Championnat argentin, dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi.

But the Montreal native and Alouettes veteran also wondered, more than once, what things might be like if ever he was given an opportunity to play linebacker, his natural position on defence. After all, the 6-foot-4, 235 pounder was part of the 2014 Vanier Cup championship team at Université de Montréal and was a third-round (24th overall) draft pick — high enough that a significant pro career seemed reasonable — of the B.C. Lions in 2017. Article content Article content “I don’t know, maybe I didn’t get a chance, an opportunity to show what I could do,” Chagnon, 30, told the Montreal Gazette this week. “That’s all right. I know my role on special teams was important. Special teams in the CFL are really important. I knew you could have a good career, a great career, playing on special teams. Guys Like Jason Arakgi did it. (Winnipeg’s) Mike Miller is still doing it today. “But of course,” Chagnon quickly added, “I wanted to play on defence. I just really never had that chance. I thought about it, but maybe the coaches only saw me as a special teams player and backup on defence? I can’t tell you why, honestly.” But everything changed for Chagnon at the end of July, against Calgary . Middle-linebacker Avery Williams was put on the six-game injured list and Als defensive co-ordinator Noel Thorpe, knowing his team was coming off a bye week in the schedule, on a three-game losing streak and seeking to change things up, decided to utilize a 30 defence — three down linemen and four linebackers — on approximately 50 per cent of plays. That created an opening for Chagnon, one that he has seized with relish. Article content Article content In his three games at linebacker, he has made seven tackles, displayed a ferocity for punishing opponents and hasn’t looked out of place while continuing to play on special teams. “He has proven more than capable of playing at a high level, and now he’s had the opportunity,” Thorpe said. “When those opportunities come around, you have to make the most of them. He has definitely done that. He’s smart, instinctual and has a nose for the football. He plays with really good leverage. We feel like we haven’t missed a beat with him.” Chagnon’s story is one of perseverance and patience, of finally being rewarded for years of toiling in near anonymity. Nothing ever came easy for him, whether it was athletics or academics. “That’s been me forever, since I was young,” he said. “In everything. I never had the easiest way. I had to work to get my spot in everything and had to earn it every day. It’s been like that my whole life, from CEGEP to university. I had to go up the ladder after playing special teams. I had to try and get a spot on special teams and see how it goes.” A hockey defenceman at first, Chagnon realized his skating meant a pro career was unlikely. When his family moved from Lorraine to Blainville, and the arena was too far from his home, his father suggested a change in sports, given his son’s developing frame. Even then, the change didn’t come naturally; Chagnon’s struggles in the classroom proved an additional challenge if he wanted to play on his high school team. Article content He originally went to CEGEP Vieux-Montréal but was only part of the practice roster before transferring to Lionel Groulx, where he eventually caught the eye of Als general manager Danny Maciocia, then the Carabins’ head coach, who recruited him to university. “He can play on all four phases of special teams,” Maciocia said. “He’s long. He’s pretty dynamic. He’s a student of the game. Sometimes it’s just a question of there being an opportunity. It has to present itself. When it does … it may just knock once. But if you get that opportunity, cash in on it by making a couple of plays, tackles, doing your job and getting the attention of your coaches, there’s a sense I can play this guy, I feel comfortable with him and there’s a comfort level that kicks in. Once it kicks in, you can build off that.” Chagnon spent three seasons with the Lions but struggled as a rookie. The anxiety of being across the country, separated from his family, was overbearing. He signed with the Als as a free agent in 2020, but the season was cancelled due to COVID-19. He was released in July 2021, signed with Ottawa, but returned to Montreal last season. Article content But he also put the cancelled season to good use, returning to university to complete his business degree, fulfilling a promise made years earlier to both his father and Maciocia. Many CFL contracts contain a bonus clause that kicks in provided a player’s on the field for 51 per cent of the game. It has been a useful resource for Chagnon — a new homeowner in Lasalle and the father of a two-year-old boy — the last three weeks. “It’s good to have the extra money, but I’m not relying on that to put food on my table and pay the mortgage,” he said. hzurkowsky@postmedia.com twitter.com/HerbZurkowsky1 Article content Share this article in your social network","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"montrealgazette","source_priority":45963,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Injury That Has Upended the Women’s World Cup","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-injury-that-has-upended-the-womens-world-cup","keywords":["Sports / The Sporting Scene"],"creator":["Louisa Thomas"],"video_url":null,"description":"Some of the best players in the world have gone down with A.C.L. tears—an injury that, for reasons which aren’t entirely clear, women experience far more often than men.","content":"It is no surprise that England is in the final of the . They are the world’s fourth-ranked team, the reigning European champions, and were among the semifinalists at the World Cup four years ago. The final was the expectation, not the goal. When England dominated Germany in the Euro finals last September, there were more than eighty-seven thousand fans at Wembley Stadium. England beat the United States at a friendly a month later, and some seventy-seven thousand people came to watch. And yet that team is not this one. The revelation of that roster was Beth Mead, who established herself as an almost unstoppable force in a dazzling display at the Euros, winning the Golden Boot for most goals and the Golden Ball for the tournament’s best player. In November, she tore her A.C.L. A few months later, England’s captain, Leah Williamson, bent her leg awkwardly as she came over the ball on a challenge in a game for her club team, Arsenal. Face down on the field, she threw up a hand to signal for help, then pounded the earth in obvious pain and frustration. Surely, she knew, even then—before she limped from the pitch, supported by medics; before the MRI confirmed the grim diagnosis; before the surgery—that she’d torn her A.C.L. Everyone knew. Everyone had seen it happen too many times before. In early May, the England midfielder Fran Kirby, a two-time F.A. player of the year, announced that she, too, would be undergoing surgery to repair an injured knee, and would miss the World Cup. And the tournament had hardly started when Keira Walsh, the team’s fulcrum in the midfield, went down with a leg injury. “I’ve done my knee,” she reportedly told medical staff as she was carried away on a stretcher. When it was announced that her A.C.L. was, in fact, still intact, and that she would be able to return—in the end, she missed only a game and a half—the news was presented as a kind of miracle. Even without these players, England is still a phenomenal team. It overcame a —propelled by the passion of the home country’s fans and the unstoppable force of —with ruthless, clinical play, despite missing yet another star: the dynamite young forward Lauren James, who had to sit out for two games after receiving a red card for stomping on a Nigerian player, Michelle Alozie. But England has been gritting out wins, not racing to them. It’s tempting to wonder what the team would look like if not for the rash of ligament ruptures. But you could say that of several teams. England is far from the only one dealing with A.C.L. injuries. The Netherlands, last year’s finalist, might have gone further than the quarterfinals if they’d had their best player, Vivianne Miedema, who tore her A.C.L. last winter. The United States’ is less shocking when you consider that Catarina Macario, perhaps their best player, was out with a torn A.C.L. (Their top goal scorer in 2023, Mallory Swanson, missed the tournament, too, with a torn patellar tendon.) Canada, the reigning Olympic champions, lost their star forward, Janine Beckie, to an A.C.L. tear in March. France’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto, a nominee for the 2022 Ballon d’Or, tore her A.C.L. last year. Her French teammate Delphine Cascarino tore hers in May. The list goes on. Myriad factors have played into the chaos and surprise of this World Cup—none of the four semifinalists has ever won the championship—but the ripple effect of A.C.L. injuries is one of the biggest. You might even call it a crisis—if it were anything new. The anterior cruciate ligament is a thick band of tissue connecting the thigh bone (the femur) to the shinbone (the tibia). It’s found inside the knee joint, in front of the posterior cruciate ligament (P.C.L.), which it crosses to form a kind of sturdy “X.” The A.C.L. keeps the shinbone from sliding in front of the thigh bone and keeps the knee in place. But when it is stressed in certain ways—during a quick pivot, for instance, or an awkward landing or sudden impact—it can rip. When that happens, the knee loses stability. After a full rupture, it generally won’t regenerate or heal on its own. Instead, doctors will take a portion of the patient’s hamstring, quadriceps, or patellar tendon, or tissue from an organ donor, and graft it into the knee to create a new A.C.L. This can work well, particularly if you have access to top-flight doctors, as most professional athletes do. But it is painful, and recovery is long and arduous. It’s expensive, too, if you’re footing the bill: out-of-pocket costs in the U.S. can be upward of ten thousand dollars. Full recovery can take anywhere from nine months to more than a year—an eternity in the short life of an élite athlete. Even when an athlete regains most of her form, the reconstructed knee can be vulnerable. A significant percentage of athletes who have torn their A.C.L. once do it again within a few years. Around half develop osteoarthritis five to fifteen years after surgery. People who tear their A.C.L.s are around seven times more likely to need a total knee replacement down the road. And, no matter how common the surgery has become, the healing process can be unpredictable. Christen Press, a key player on the U.S. team that won the , recently underwent her fourth operation on a knee that she tore up last year. Male athletes tear their A.C.L.s, too, in alarming numbers—in the Premier League earlier this month, Jurrien Timber had barely stepped on the field after a flashy, forty-million-dollar transfer to Arsenal when he damaged his. But the rate is significantly higher among female athletes, particularly in sports that involve sudden stops, pivots, and accelerations. Just how much higher is unclear. (Kathryn Ackerman, a doctor specializing in sports medicine—she runs the Wu Tsai Female Athlete Program at Boston Children’s Hospital—told me that women are four to six times more likely than men to tear their A.C.L.s.) Why there is such a difference is not entirely clear, either. There are morphological factors: women often have a smaller notch on their femurs than men, which gives the ligament less leeway when stretched; they typically have wider hips, which changes the angle of the femur. Women tend to have stronger quadriceps relative to their hamstrings, and to land more flat-footed and with stiffer knees. There is a strong suspicion that menstrual cycles increase the risk of ruptures, by affecting ligament laxity, but, as is the case with so many medical issues affecting women, the theory has not been the subject of sufficient rigorous study. Still, biology is not destiny, and for too long it was treated as such. The Football Association, English soccer’s governing body, banned women’s teams in 1921, stating “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged.” The ban was not lifted until 1970. A narrow focus on how the morphology of women affects injury rates not only runs the risk of deterring girls from competing in the first place; it also threatens to reinforce the false idea that sports are unsuitable for women, while ignoring crucial social and cultural factors. For decades, women have often played on inferior fields, which is known to increase the risk of non-contact leg injuries. (This was a sticking point for the U.S. women’s national team in their fight for equal pay and conditions.) They have played without sufficient medical infrastructure or training support. They have participated in training programs that are insufficient for their needs. As opportunities and access have expanded, the quality of their environment hasn’t quite kept pace. England’s domestic league wasn’t fully professional until five years ago. Since then, traditional powerhouses—Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and so on—have begun investing more of their resources and influence in the women’s game, to tremendous effect. Now England’s women’s league and national team both occupy spaces in the upper echelon of international sport. The teams have legitimate television contracts with the BBC and Sky Sports, and receive continual coverage from places like the and the Athletic. Increasingly, the stars are superstars. The schedule has grown along with demand; players are playing more, and with greater intensity. But that extra load on their legs has consequences. And, even now, at all levels, women’s teams are more likely than men’s teams to travel by coach instead of business class, commercial instead of charter. A National Women’s Soccer League game was once played on a fifty-eight-yard-wide field in a Triple-A baseball stadium. Women typically wear cleats made from molds of men’s feet, and that shape affects how arches and heels are supported when an athlete lands. (This could be especially significant when it comes to A.C.L.s, given the way that perilous ground-foot interactions can stress the knee.) They are often, even at the élite level, supported by smaller medical staff, with less training, than the men receive. The disparity in resources extends down through the youth levels. That, in fact, is where some of the biggest problems are. For all the attention that A.C.L. injuries among élite players are getting, many of the hundreds of thousands that occur each year happen to younger players. Generally, girls are at high risk of A.C.L. injuries after they have gone through puberty but before they have built up their strength. The first time that the U.S. national team member Emily Fox tore her A.C.L., she was a freshman in college. Megan Rapinoe tore hers three times, the first as a college sophomore. Alex Morgan tore hers in high school. And they are the lucky ones: many younger athletes, who don’t have the access to doctors and rehabilitation programs that top athletes do—or who are simply, and understandably, traumatized by their injury—quit the sport they were playing when they were hurt. Some quit sports altogether. The injury, after all, can be as difficult psychologically as it is physically. “I don’t know if it’s over for me—I don’t know if I’ll be back at this level,” Alexia Putellas, perhaps the best player in the world, reportedly told her agent after she ruptured her A.C.L., in 2022. Chloe Kelly, a forward for England, described feeling “worthless” after injuring her A.C.L. in 2021. Those who come back often have the risk of injury in the back of their minds. Alex Culvin, the head of strategy and research in women’s soccer for , the game’s global union, Rory Smith of the , “We’ve had a lot of feedback from players saying they feel unsafe.” The players, Culvin added, want more research into the different factors that particularly affect women. “There have been a lot of studies done in female athletes about A.C.L. injuries, but some of them weren’t done that well,” Ackerman, the doctor specializing in sports medicine, told me. But that’s changing, she said. Research methods are improving. And there are new surgical techniques, too, such as one developed by Martha Murray, which helps the A.C.L. heal without replacing it with a graft. There are also ways to lower the risk of non-contact lower-body injuries that are free and accessible to anyone. Some twenty years ago, doctors and trainers developed a dynamic warmup-and-training program to improve biomechanics, increase core stability, and improve balance. It’s known as , for “Prevent injury, enhance performance,” and has evolved into various iterations since its inception. Several studies, particularly of adolescent females, found that adhering to this kind of plan significantly reduced non-contact A.C.L. injuries. built upon to create its own injury-prevention program, which takes about fifteen or twenty minutes, a few times a week. It is available online. Another version is available in a free app, from the Hospital for Special Surgery. Of course, it is hard to get people to floss for thirty seconds, let alone to get young people who may not be approaching a sport very seriously—or even ones who are—to spend an hour a week doing hyper-specific hopping exercises, preparing against some abstract event. That said, the prevalence of A.C.L. injuries has increased awareness of these prehabilitation techniques. It’s the kind of thing you don’t think about until it’s all you can think about. Putellas is back on the field and will be playing for Spain in the final, but is far from full strength. Given the high calibre of players around her, it seems she doesn’t need to be at her very best to make a contribution. England has shown its depth and ability to adjust—to asphyxiate opponents instead of pummelling them. Williamson, Mead, and Kirby, though, can only watch. ♦","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:00","image_url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64df9ff899c75b29bf387da0/master/pass/Thomas-WC-Inj-sports.jpg","source_id":"newyorker","source_priority":776,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This World Cup Left Its Mark on Australia","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/this-world-cup-left-its-mark-on-australia","keywords":["Sports / The Sporting Scene"],"creator":["Naaman Zhou"],"video_url":null,"description":"Despite a heartbreaking loss in the semifinals, Australia’s national team has built an excitement for the game that will last.","content":"Only four countries have won a Women’s World Cup; Australia, for now, will not be one of them. In soccer, the semifinal can be the cruellest match. On Wednesday night, in Sydney, the Matildas, as the Australian women’s team are known, played in their first World Cup semifinal, against England, and fell, at home, with one goal and two mistakes, just short of their first final. Losing a World Cup semifinal is supposed to be England’s thing. (There’s a line in “Three Lions,” the country’s unofficial soccer anthem, about it.) For roughly half of this match, England, the current European champions, and Australia, the competition co-hosts, were roughly even. In the sixty-third minute, Australia’s captain, , one of the world’s most devastating strikers, dribbled for forty yards, then half chipped, half blasted the ball thirty yards, into the English goal. Then England scored two more. None of the teams in this year’s semifinals—England, Spain, Sweden, and Australia—has won the trophy before, but it was not a surprise to see this Australian team in the final four. The Matildas have consistently been among women’s soccer’s top teams; squad members play for clubs such as Arsenal, Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Chelsea. (Without Kerr, who was injured for much of the tournament, the winger Caitlin Foord, who plays for Arsenal, had been one of the Cup’s most brilliant forwards.) Australia had beaten England 2–0 in London, in April; a World Cup win was not unthinkable. But, at the final whistle, in Sydney, the Australian players sat and cried. England danced to “Sweet Caroline.” For the , much of the off-field talk, among soccer journalists and visiting commentators, had been about whether Australia—where football has always been a secondary sport—had become a soccer nation. The answer, from the start of the tournament, has been a slow, rumbling yes. I sat in desperately sold-out stadiums, and thousands of people crowded to watch in public squares and parks. A commenter in Australia recounted driving around delivering pizza and seeing every single TV tuned in to the Matildas’ game. In Melbourne, officials opened the grounds of the Australian Open and of Australian Rules stadiums, and people sat in the stands, in front of empty fields, watching soccer on the big screens. It felt as if soccer were taking over; it made the loss more painful. England, who had struggled to beat , and nearly lost to Nigeria on penalties, seemed to reserve their most ruthless level for the semi. The team was missing its best attacking player, the midfielder Lauren James, but her replacement, Ella Toone, scored the opener in Sydney with a spear of a shot that swerved off her right foot. Kerr equalized, and, for the next eight minutes, Australia pressed. The statistics—the refuge of the loser—show that England, over the match, was only slightly better. Both teams had five shots on target; the expected goals—a measure of the quality of those shots and chances—was in England’s favor only by 0.05 of a goal. But, in real life, at 1–1, Ellie Carpenter, Australia’s right back, who plays for Lyon, and was coming back from a yearlong , failed to sweep away a ball, and England’s Lauren Hemp fired it into the Australian goal. Sport is close and exhilarating and hopeful until it isn’t. England’s third goal came in the eighty-sixth minute, against a desperately rejigged attacking Australian side. Even at 2–1, Kerr missed two chances that, perhaps, she could have taken, if she had been more match-sharp. Maybe the difference was Sarina Wiegman, England’s coach, a tactical master from the Netherlands, who has now made the finals of two consecutive World Cups, and won two successive European Championships, with two different teams. England will face Spain on Sunday, in the final, in the same stadium. The loss will sting less soon, and eyes have already turned to the future. To get here, Australia had beaten France, in the longest penalty shoot-out in World Cup history, women’s or men’s. They destroyed Canada, the Olympic gold medallists, 4–0, while Kerr, injured, sat grinning on the bench. England had its own transformative soccer moment, in 2022, when the country hosted, and won, the Women’s European Championship. The journalist Suzanne Wrack, who was there, said that this year in Australia felt “next level. It has permeated so much more deeply into society than it did during the Euros.” The player who took Australia’s winning penalty against France—the scarcely believable twentieth kick—Cortnee Vine, plays for Sydney F.C. During the tournament, the club’s women’s team broke its record for member sign-ups, two months before the season starts. This World Cup has also brought new heights for women’s soccer globally, not just for its hosts. At various points, thirteen million people in Brazil watched their team play a single match; ten million in Germany watched theirs; and, in China, fifty-four million people watched their team’s last group game. Almost as many people in England watched the match against Australia, at 11 local time, as had watched their own Euros semifinal. Teams from Haiti, Nigeria, and Colombia held or beat the top teams of Europe. More Americans watched the U.S.’s matches at this World Cup, until the team was , than did in 2019, despite pre-dawn kickoff times. After an England win, fans like to sing “It’s coming home,” the chorus of “Three Lions,” which was originally written to mark England’s hosting of the men’s 1996 European Championships. (They lost in the semis.) It’s a song mostly about hurt and failure. It has lately been adopted to refer to winning—bringing “back”—the World Cup. This repurposing has always sat strangely with me, not for the presumption of winning, but of ownership. I watched England’s quarterfinal match, a close 2–1 win against Colombia, and, on the way out of the stadium, two English fans yelled at the Australians who had come to watch. “Stick to swimming!” one shouted. “Stick to surfing!” One of the most beloved sayings in Australian soccer—or football, as some of its fans prefer to call it—is “I told you so.” It was the catchphrase of Johnny Warren, a former captain of the men’s team, who, after he retired, took on the burden of being the chief soccer evangelist, educator, and optimist in a country that, broadly, did not really care. Warren, who died in 2004, said that Australia could win the World Cup. He thought that soccer could grow to become the country’s favorite sport. “I told you so” was something he imagined saying, at some future point, to those who disagreed. On Wednesday, eleven-and-a-half million people were watching on TV at home, making the game the most-viewed program since the current Australian television-ratings system began. More were watching in public and overseas. In the stadium, tens of thousands of people stayed long after it was over. ♦","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:00","image_url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64dfa7be9282bd4d7a7d76fb/master/pass/Zhou-Australia-World-Cup-Loss.jpg","source_id":"newyorker","source_priority":776,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England reaches the Women’s World Cup final despite key injuries","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/2023/08/19/england-reaches-the-womens-world-cup-final-despite-key-injuries","keywords":["Soccer"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"There were some doubts about England’s squad leading into the Women’s World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren’t with […]","content":"There were some doubts about England's squad leading into the Women's World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren't with the team because of injuries.

But the Lionesses, led by coach Sarina Wiegman, have shown they are adept at adjustments — and it’s gotten them all the way to the title match. England plays Spain on Sunday for the World Cup trophy. The Lionesses defeated Australia 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. “The commitment of this team, the willingness to become better and to win games is so high. I haven’t seen any moment that’s any different. There’s never any complacency in the team,” Wiegman said. “Of course, we’ve had a lot of things thrown at us, with injuries. We had to find a way, ‘OK, what fits best now? How to play?’” England has played in the World Cup without their three playmakers from the 2022 European Championship squad. All three sustained knee injuries that kept them off Wiegman’s World Cup roster. Williamson, England’s versatile captain who can play defense or in the midfield, tore her ACL while playing with club team Arsenal in a match against Manchester United in April. Mead, who also plays for Arsenal, ruptured her ACL last November and wasn’t able to recover in time. She won the Golden Boot and the MVP award with six goals at Euro 2022. Kirby was injured during a match for Chelsea in February and announced in May she would miss the World Cup because of knee surgery. She has 17 goals in 65 appearances for England. She started all of England’s games during the team’s run in the Euros. At first it looked as though those absences were going to be difficult to overcome. England lost 2-0 to Australia and played to a scoreless draw with Portugal in a pair of exhibition matches ahead of the World Cup. Then Keira Walsh, the team’s defensive midfielder, was hurt during a group-stage match against Denmark. Carried off on a stretcher, she at one point was seen saying “I’ve done my knee.” Ultimately, she missed just one game. Williamson attended the team’s quarterfinal victory over Colombia and visited the team’s training camp. She was also expected to be at the final Sunday in Sydney. “Obviously, they would want nothing more than to be here,” Walsh said about her missing teammates. “It is probably a bit bittersweet. They want us to win and we would want them to be here as well. Leah, Beth and Fran have been really supportive. They have messaged after every game. Hopefully, we can get the job done on Sunday and make them proud of us.” Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. Williamson, Kirby and Mead were among a number of high-profile international players who missed out on the World Cup because of knee injuries, and particularly ACL tears. The list included Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema, Canada’s Janine Beckie and young U.S. forward Catarina Macario. James is able to return for Sunday’s final after a two-game suspension for stomping on a Nigeria player following a tackle in the knockout round. She has three goals and three assists in the tournament. “As a player, you understand that at any time something can pop up, and things can change. Football is never a given,” England captain Millie Bright said. “And while we’d absolutely love everyone to be here, it’s been such a great opportunity for other people to come in and step up. We’re really blessed as a nation that we have such a big pool of players to choose from, so much talent.” ___ AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-08-19 09:14:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Clermont suit Antoine Makoumbou (Cagliari)","link":"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Clermont-suit-antoine-makoumbou-cagliari/1414459#xtor=RSS-1","keywords":["Foot, Transferts"],"creator":["José Barroso"],"video_url":null,"description":"Clermont s'intéresse au milieu congolais Antoine Makoumbou (Cagliari, Serie B), également pisté par le Fenerbahçe et Bologne.","content":"Alors que Saîf-Eddine Khaoui a rejoint les Émirats arabes unis cet été, Clermont piste le milieu Antoine Makoumbou (25 ans).

A latecomer to boxing, Bridges has enjoyed a whirlwind start to her career The 36-year-old Aussie won the IBF featherweight title in her ninth fight as a pro But Bridges has gained even more notoriety for her activities outside of the ring By Adrian Bishop For Mailonline Published: 10:07, 19 August 2023 | Updated: 10:07, 19 August 2023 e-mail View comments The old saying 'looks can be deceiving' has perhaps never been as true as in the case of IBF featherweight champion Ebanie Bridges. A late starter in boxing, Bridges trained in karate and muay thai as a youth before embarking on a successful career in bodybuilding, winning various titles around the Sydney area. Though she had some combat sports experience, Bridges' route to a career as a professional was unique in that she had initially started taking boxing classes solely as a way to improve her footwork for prospective career in kickboxing. But it was pugilism where Bridges would find a newfound passion, and despite turning her attention to the sweet science as a relative latecomer she found immediate success, winning Australian Golden Gloves titles at bantamweight in 2016 and 2017. Making her pro debut aged 32, and despite the early portion of his career being disrupted by the pandemic, Bridges wasted no time undergoing a protracted development phase as a professional. Ebanie Bridges has become one of the most recognisable faces in all of boxing despite only making her debut four years ago The 36-year-old has become a regular feature of British boxing cards, and won a world title in her ninth pro fight Bridges defended her world title with an eighth-round TKO of Shannon O'Connell in December Instead she garnered a devoted following from the outset thanks to her exciting style and penchant for weighing-in wearing lingerie before fighting for the WBA bantamweight title in just her sixth career outing. Though she would find herself on the wrong side of a unanimous decision on that night at the Copper Box against Shannon Courtenay in 2021, Bridges continued undeterred. A Leeds United fan since childhood, the Blonde Bomber has made the Yorkshire city her adopted home for and explained that her love affair with the club began thanks to another of the city's Australian imports. 'He's my fave, what an animal,' Bridges said of former Whites striker Mark Viduka to Pub Talk podcast. 'Obviously when I played football in the late 90s and early 00s Leeds was huge in Australia. 'When you're around my age group, my era there are a lot of Leeds fans because we were in the Premier League.' Moving her career permanently to the UK, Bridges returned to winning ways with two further fights in 2021, beating Bec Connolly and Mailys Gangloff to position herself for another world title shot. This time Bridges would make the best of her opportunity, defeating Maria Cecilia Roman to capture the IBF bantamweight title in her adopted home city, before retaining the belt with a gritty grudge-match TKO of Shannon O'Connell . But it's not just Bridges' exploits inside the ring that have made her one of the most recognisable faces in the sport today. The 36-year-old has also built a sizeable following through regularly sharing adult content on the subscription site OnlyFans, and flashed her bra to a reporter in December when asked to explain her weigh-in outfit. 'It's like lace, has my handle, subscribe now,' said Bridges. 'I don't know, what is it? It's sexy, isn't it? Bridges is also a devoted Leeds United fan, having started supporting the team due to her love of former Whites star Mark Viduka In addition to her all-action style, the former bodybuilder has also gained fans for her habit of weighing in while wearing lingerie Bridges (pictured) has left a shocked in December by lifting her shirt and flashing her bra during an interview about her controversial weigh-in outfit 'It's more pretty stripper not so much skanky stripper, you know what I mean?' Bridges has also struck up a close friendship with social media personality turned influencer boxer Elle Brooke, with the pair engaging in a bizarre public bet late last year. With Bridges' beloved Leeds taking on Brooke's favourite team, Man City, in the Premier League on Boxing Day at Elland Road, the Blonde Bomber tweeted that the pair had agreed that the winner could punch the loser. 'She hits hard but I reckon she would be scared to hit me,' Bridges told Daily Mail Australia after City ran out 3-1 winners. 'But a bet is a bet [so] she gets a free shot.' Facing criticism online for opening an OnlyFans account, Bridges revealed that the move had proven to be significantly lucrative, and that her enjoyment of the sport is now the main reason she is continues her career in the ring. 'You wouldn't even believe it if I said it,' she replied when asked how much she has made on the platform in an interview with Talksport . 'It's only been 10 weeks and I won't disclose [the amount] but from the second day of launching my OnlyFans I've been in the top 0.01 per cent of earners. 'I don't even know why I'm boxing, probably because I love hitting people.' Bridges has also created headlines for her friendship with UFC legend Conor McGregor. The pair were pictured together at Katie Taylor's defeat to Chantelle Cameron in May, with multiple pictures showing the Irishman throwing his arm around her at ringside. Though she would later reveal on social media that she felt 'manhandled' during the encounter , the pair have remained close ever since and were again pictured together in attendance for Anthony Joshua's KO win against Robert Helenius earlier this month. The OnlyFans star has also struck up a close friendship with UFC legend Conor McGregor But Bridges shocked fans after claiming she felt the Irishman had 'manhandled' her at ringside Despite the comments the pair were once again pictured together at ringside earlier this month Despite a mixed response online, with some fans referring to her as a 'clout chaser' , Bridges affirmed that she enjoyed her time with McGregor. 'Had a great night ringside at the Anthony Joshua fight with my pal Conor McGregor enjoying his smooth Irish Forged Stout,' she said after the fight. 'It's always a good time with Conor - he's always the life of the party and very humble. 'As we know, I like to break the internet, so I thought why not rock a sexy outfit, as I do, and promote Conor's new stout while I'm at it.' Hand surgery earlier this year has curtailed the Aussie's activity inside the ring just as her stardom grows to newfound heights, but if anything is certain it is that anything Ebanie Bridges does has the power to capture the public's attention.

La promesse a été tenue. Les Scandinaves ont battu Sam Kerr et sa bande, ce samedi, à Brisbane et remporté la médaille de bronze de la Coupe du monde pour la quatrième fois de l'histoire après 1991, 2011 et 2019. Sorties par l'Espagne en demies, les joueuses de Peter Gerhardsson ont retrouvé leur solidité en ne concédant aucun but et ont, en plus, fait preuve d'efficacité. La première étincelle a été allumée dès la première minute par Stina Blackstenius trouvée par Asllani (1re). L'ancienne Parisienne a été omniprésente durant cette première période avec notamment un centre pour la tête de Fridolina Rolfö, qui a heurté la transversale (27e). Mais quelques secondes plus tôt, Clare Hunt avait déséquilibré Blackstenius dans la surface australienne et après vérification par le VAR, l'arbitre a accordé un penalty aux Scandinaves transformé par Roflö pour son troisième but dans la compétition. Les Suédoises ont continué à mettre la pression par Asllani (40e), Angeldal (45e+2) et Blackstenius (45e+3). Les Australiennes n'ont pas été en reste puisque Hayley Raso a obligé Zecira Musovic à un bel arrêt, à la suite d'un centre impeccable d'Ellie Carpenter (23e). La tête de Katrina Gorry (34e) a été captée par la gardienne suédoise, attentive sur la frappe puissante de Sam Kerr (45e+6). Asllani comme en 2019 La seconde période a été moins riche en occasions mais les Suédoises ont su enfoncer le clou. Déjà buteuse lors du match pour la troisième place en 2019 contre l'Angleterre (2-1), Asllani a remis ça en seconde période sur un bon décalage de Blackstenius (62e), qui avait été trouvée précédemment par l'attaquante de l'AC Milan. La rencontre s'est un peu emballée avec le sauvetage d'Arnold sur une frappe du gauche de Blackstenius (66e) et la reprise à bout pourtant de Polkinghorne, repoussée par Musovic, avec peut-être une main au préalable sur son contrôle (70e). Les 49 461 spectateurs ont néanmoins assisté à la défaite de leur équipe qui, même si elle finit quatrième de son Mondial, termine à la première place dans le coeur d'un public australien totalement conquis par ses Matildas.","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:15:50","image_url":"https://medias.lequipe.fr/img-photo-jpg/la-joie-des-suedoises-troisiemes-du-mondial-australien-amanda-perobelli-reuters/1500000001822628/0:0,1100:550-665-335-70/93c27.jpg","source_id":"lequipe","source_priority":21660,"country":["france"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Edinson Cavani signe son premier but avec Boca Juniors","link":"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Edinson-cavani-signe-son-premier-but-avec-boca-juniors/1414464#xtor=RSS-1","keywords":["Foot, ARG, Boca Juniors"],"creator":["Maxime Dubernet"],"video_url":null,"description":"À 36 ans et pour son deuxième match avec Boca Juniors (Argentine), Edinson Cavani a ouvert son compteur avec ses nouvelles couleurs contre Platense (3-1) dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi.","content":"Quelques jours , Edinson Cavani (36 ans) a inscrit son premier but avec Boca Juniors lors de la victoire aisée sur Platense (3-1) lors de la première journée de la 2e phase du Championnat argentin, dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi.

But the Montreal native and Alouettes veteran also wondered, more than once, what things might be like if ever he was given an opportunity to play linebacker, his natural position on defence. After all, the 6-foot-4, 235 pounder was part of the 2014 Vanier Cup championship team at Université de Montréal and was a third-round (24th overall) draft pick — high enough that a significant pro career seemed reasonable — of the B.C. Lions in 2017. Article content Article content “I don’t know, maybe I didn’t get a chance, an opportunity to show what I could do,” Chagnon, 30, told the Montreal Gazette this week. “That’s all right. I know my role on special teams was important. Special teams in the CFL are really important. I knew you could have a good career, a great career, playing on special teams. Guys Like Jason Arakgi did it. (Winnipeg’s) Mike Miller is still doing it today. “But of course,” Chagnon quickly added, “I wanted to play on defence. I just really never had that chance. I thought about it, but maybe the coaches only saw me as a special teams player and backup on defence? I can’t tell you why, honestly.” But everything changed for Chagnon at the end of July, against Calgary . Middle-linebacker Avery Williams was put on the six-game injured list and Als defensive co-ordinator Noel Thorpe, knowing his team was coming off a bye week in the schedule, on a three-game losing streak and seeking to change things up, decided to utilize a 30 defence — three down linemen and four linebackers — on approximately 50 per cent of plays. That created an opening for Chagnon, one that he has seized with relish. Article content Article content In his three games at linebacker, he has made seven tackles, displayed a ferocity for punishing opponents and hasn’t looked out of place while continuing to play on special teams. “He has proven more than capable of playing at a high level, and now he’s had the opportunity,” Thorpe said. “When those opportunities come around, you have to make the most of them. He has definitely done that. He’s smart, instinctual and has a nose for the football. He plays with really good leverage. We feel like we haven’t missed a beat with him.” Chagnon’s story is one of perseverance and patience, of finally being rewarded for years of toiling in near anonymity. Nothing ever came easy for him, whether it was athletics or academics. “That’s been me forever, since I was young,” he said. “In everything. I never had the easiest way. I had to work to get my spot in everything and had to earn it every day. It’s been like that my whole life, from CEGEP to university. I had to go up the ladder after playing special teams. I had to try and get a spot on special teams and see how it goes.” A hockey defenceman at first, Chagnon realized his skating meant a pro career was unlikely. When his family moved from Lorraine to Blainville, and the arena was too far from his home, his father suggested a change in sports, given his son’s developing frame. Even then, the change didn’t come naturally; Chagnon’s struggles in the classroom proved an additional challenge if he wanted to play on his high school team. Article content He originally went to CEGEP Vieux-Montréal but was only part of the practice roster before transferring to Lionel Groulx, where he eventually caught the eye of Als general manager Danny Maciocia, then the Carabins’ head coach, who recruited him to university. “He can play on all four phases of special teams,” Maciocia said. “He’s long. He’s pretty dynamic. He’s a student of the game. Sometimes it’s just a question of there being an opportunity. It has to present itself. When it does … it may just knock once. But if you get that opportunity, cash in on it by making a couple of plays, tackles, doing your job and getting the attention of your coaches, there’s a sense I can play this guy, I feel comfortable with him and there’s a comfort level that kicks in. Once it kicks in, you can build off that.” Chagnon spent three seasons with the Lions but struggled as a rookie. The anxiety of being across the country, separated from his family, was overbearing. He signed with the Als as a free agent in 2020, but the season was cancelled due to COVID-19. He was released in July 2021, signed with Ottawa, but returned to Montreal last season. Article content But he also put the cancelled season to good use, returning to university to complete his business degree, fulfilling a promise made years earlier to both his father and Maciocia. Many CFL contracts contain a bonus clause that kicks in provided a player’s on the field for 51 per cent of the game. It has been a useful resource for Chagnon — a new homeowner in Lasalle and the father of a two-year-old boy — the last three weeks. “It’s good to have the extra money, but I’m not relying on that to put food on my table and pay the mortgage,” he said. hzurkowsky@postmedia.com twitter.com/HerbZurkowsky1 Article content Share this article in your social network","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"montrealgazette","source_priority":45963,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Injury That Has Upended the Women’s World Cup","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-injury-that-has-upended-the-womens-world-cup","keywords":["Sports / The Sporting Scene"],"creator":["Louisa Thomas"],"video_url":null,"description":"Some of the best players in the world have gone down with A.C.L. tears—an injury that, for reasons which aren’t entirely clear, women experience far more often than men.","content":"It is no surprise that England is in the final of the . They are the world’s fourth-ranked team, the reigning European champions, and were among the semifinalists at the World Cup four years ago. The final was the expectation, not the goal.

England beat the United States at a friendly a month later, and some seventy-seven thousand people came to watch. And yet that team is not this one.

Surely, she knew, even then—before she limped from the pitch, supported by medics; before the MRI confirmed the grim diagnosis; before the surgery—that she’d torn her A.C.L. Everyone knew. Everyone had seen it happen too many times before. In early May, the England midfielder Fran Kirby, a two-time F.A. player of the year, announced that she, too, would be undergoing surgery to repair an injured knee, and would miss the World Cup. And the tournament had hardly started when Keira Walsh, the team’s fulcrum in the midfield, went down with a leg injury. “I’ve done my knee,” she reportedly told medical staff as she was carried away on a stretcher. When it was announced that her A.C.L. was, in fact, still intact, and that she would be able to return—in the end, she missed only a game and a half—the news was presented as a kind of miracle. Even without these players, England is still a phenomenal team. It overcame a —propelled by the passion of the home country’s fans and the unstoppable force of —with ruthless, clinical play, despite missing yet another star: the dynamite young forward Lauren James, who had to sit out for two games after receiving a red card for stomping on a Nigerian player, Michelle Alozie. But England has been gritting out wins, not racing to them. It’s tempting to wonder what the team would look like if not for the rash of ligament ruptures. But you could say that of several teams. England is far from the only one dealing with A.C.L. injuries. The Netherlands, last year’s finalist, might have gone further than the quarterfinals if they’d had their best player, Vivianne Miedema, who tore her A.C.L. last winter. The United States’ is less shocking when you consider that Catarina Macario, perhaps their best player, was out with a torn A.C.L. (Their top goal scorer in 2023, Mallory Swanson, missed the tournament, too, with a torn patellar tendon.) Canada, the reigning Olympic champions, lost their star forward, Janine Beckie, to an A.C.L. tear in March. France’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto, a nominee for the 2022 Ballon d’Or, tore her A.C.L. last year. Her French teammate Delphine Cascarino tore hers in May. The list goes on. Myriad factors have played into the chaos and surprise of this World Cup—none of the four semifinalists has ever won the championship—but the ripple effect of A.C.L. injuries is one of the biggest. You might even call it a crisis—if it were anything new. The anterior cruciate ligament is a thick band of tissue connecting the thigh bone (the femur) to the shinbone (the tibia). It’s found inside the knee joint, in front of the posterior cruciate ligament (P.C.L.), which it crosses to form a kind of sturdy “X.” The A.C.L. keeps the shinbone from sliding in front of the thigh bone and keeps the knee in place. But when it is stressed in certain ways—during a quick pivot, for instance, or an awkward landing or sudden impact—it can rip. When that happens, the knee loses stability. After a full rupture, it generally won’t regenerate or heal on its own. Instead, doctors will take a portion of the patient’s hamstring, quadriceps, or patellar tendon, or tissue from an organ donor, and graft it into the knee to create a new A.C.L. This can work well, particularly if you have access to top-flight doctors, as most professional athletes do. But it is painful, and recovery is long and arduous. It’s expensive, too, if you’re footing the bill: out-of-pocket costs in the U.S. can be upward of ten thousand dollars. Full recovery can take anywhere from nine months to more than a year—an eternity in the short life of an élite athlete. Even when an athlete regains most of her form, the reconstructed knee can be vulnerable. A significant percentage of athletes who have torn their A.C.L. once do it again within a few years. Around half develop osteoarthritis five to fifteen years after surgery. People who tear their A.C.L.s are around seven times more likely to need a total knee replacement down the road. And, no matter how common the surgery has become, the healing process can be unpredictable. Christen Press, a key player on the U.S. team that won the , recently underwent her fourth operation on a knee that she tore up last year. Male athletes tear their A.C.L.s, too, in alarming numbers—in the Premier League earlier this month, Jurrien Timber had barely stepped on the field after a flashy, forty-million-dollar transfer to Arsenal when he damaged his. But the rate is significantly higher among female athletes, particularly in sports that involve sudden stops, pivots, and accelerations. Just how much higher is unclear. (Kathryn Ackerman, a doctor specializing in sports medicine—she runs the Wu Tsai Female Athlete Program at Boston Children’s Hospital—told me that women are four to six times more likely than men to tear their A.C.L.s.) Why there is such a difference is not entirely clear, either. There are morphological factors: women often have a smaller notch on their femurs than men, which gives the ligament less leeway when stretched; they typically have wider hips, which changes the angle of the femur. Women tend to have stronger quadriceps relative to their hamstrings, and to land more flat-footed and with stiffer knees. There is a strong suspicion that menstrual cycles increase the risk of ruptures, by affecting ligament laxity, but, as is the case with so many medical issues affecting women, the theory has not been the subject of sufficient rigorous study. Still, biology is not destiny, and for too long it was treated as such. The Football Association, English soccer’s governing body, banned women’s teams in 1921, stating “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged.” The ban was not lifted until 1970. A narrow focus on how the morphology of women affects injury rates not only runs the risk of deterring girls from competing in the first place; it also threatens to reinforce the false idea that sports are unsuitable for women, while ignoring crucial social and cultural factors. For decades, women have often played on inferior fields, which is known to increase the risk of non-contact leg injuries. (This was a sticking point for the U.S. women’s national team in their fight for equal pay and conditions.) They have played without sufficient medical infrastructure or training support. They have participated in training programs that are insufficient for their needs. As opportunities and access have expanded, the quality of their environment hasn’t quite kept pace. England’s domestic league wasn’t fully professional until five years ago. Since then, traditional powerhouses—Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and so on—have begun investing more of their resources and influence in the women’s game, to tremendous effect. Now England’s women’s league and national team both occupy spaces in the upper echelon of international sport. The teams have legitimate television contracts with the BBC and Sky Sports, and receive continual coverage from places like the and the Athletic. Increasingly, the stars are superstars. The schedule has grown along with demand; players are playing more, and with greater intensity. But that extra load on their legs has consequences. And, even now, at all levels, women’s teams are more likely than men’s teams to travel by coach instead of business class, commercial instead of charter. A National Women’s Soccer League game was once played on a fifty-eight-yard-wide field in a Triple-A baseball stadium. Women typically wear cleats made from molds of men’s feet, and that shape affects how arches and heels are supported when an athlete lands. (This could be especially significant when it comes to A.C.L.s, given the way that perilous ground-foot interactions can stress the knee.) They are often, even at the élite level, supported by smaller medical staff, with less training, than the men receive. The disparity in resources extends down through the youth levels. That, in fact, is where some of the biggest problems are. For all the attention that A.C.L. injuries among élite players are getting, many of the hundreds of thousands that occur each year happen to younger players. Generally, girls are at high risk of A.C.L. injuries after they have gone through puberty but before they have built up their strength. The first time that the U.S. national team member Emily Fox tore her A.C.L., she was a freshman in college. Megan Rapinoe tore hers three times, the first as a college sophomore. Alex Morgan tore hers in high school. And they are the lucky ones: many younger athletes, who don’t have the access to doctors and rehabilitation programs that top athletes do—or who are simply, and understandably, traumatized by their injury—quit the sport they were playing when they were hurt. Some quit sports altogether. The injury, after all, can be as difficult psychologically as it is physically. “I don’t know if it’s over for me—I don’t know if I’ll be back at this level,” Alexia Putellas, perhaps the best player in the world, reportedly told her agent after she ruptured her A.C.L., in 2022. Chloe Kelly, a forward for England, described feeling “worthless” after injuring her A.C.L. in 2021. Those who come back often have the risk of injury in the back of their minds. Alex Culvin, the head of strategy and research in women’s soccer for , the game’s global union, Rory Smith of the , “We’ve had a lot of feedback from players saying they feel unsafe.” The players, Culvin added, want more research into the different factors that particularly affect women. “There have been a lot of studies done in female athletes about A.C.L. injuries, but some of them weren’t done that well,” Ackerman, the doctor specializing in sports medicine, told me. But that’s changing, she said. Research methods are improving. And there are new surgical techniques, too, such as one developed by Martha Murray, which helps the A.C.L. heal without replacing it with a graft. There are also ways to lower the risk of non-contact lower-body injuries that are free and accessible to anyone. Some twenty years ago, doctors and trainers developed a dynamic warmup-and-training program to improve biomechanics, increase core stability, and improve balance. It’s known as , for “Prevent injury, enhance performance,” and has evolved into various iterations since its inception. Several studies, particularly of adolescent females, found that adhering to this kind of plan significantly reduced non-contact A.C.L. injuries. built upon to create its own injury-prevention program, which takes about fifteen or twenty minutes, a few times a week. It is available online. Another version is available in a free app, from the Hospital for Special Surgery. Of course, it is hard to get people to floss for thirty seconds, let alone to get young people who may not be approaching a sport very seriously—or even ones who are—to spend an hour a week doing hyper-specific hopping exercises, preparing against some abstract event. That said, the prevalence of A.C.L. injuries has increased awareness of these prehabilitation techniques. It’s the kind of thing you don’t think about until it’s all you can think about. Putellas is back on the field and will be playing for Spain in the final, but is far from full strength. Given the high calibre of players around her, it seems she doesn’t need to be at her very best to make a contribution. England has shown its depth and ability to adjust—to asphyxiate opponents instead of pummelling them. Williamson, Mead, and Kirby, though, can only watch. ♦","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:00","image_url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64df9ff899c75b29bf387da0/master/pass/Thomas-WC-Inj-sports.jpg","source_id":"newyorker","source_priority":776,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This World Cup Left Its Mark on Australia","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/this-world-cup-left-its-mark-on-australia","keywords":["Sports / The Sporting Scene"],"creator":["Naaman Zhou"],"video_url":null,"description":"Despite a heartbreaking loss in the semifinals, Australia’s national team has built an excitement for the game that will last.","content":"Only four countries have won a Women’s World Cup; Australia, for now, will not be one of them. In soccer, the semifinal can be the cruellest match. On Wednesday night, in Sydney, the Matildas, as the Australian women’s team are known, played in their first World Cup semifinal, against England, and fell, at home, with one goal and two mistakes, just short of their first final. Losing a World Cup semifinal is supposed to be England’s thing. (There’s a line in “Three Lions,” the country’s unofficial soccer anthem, about it.) For roughly half of this match, England, the current European champions, and Australia, the competition co-hosts, were roughly even. In the sixty-third minute, Australia’s captain, , one of the world’s most devastating strikers, dribbled for forty yards, then half chipped, half blasted the ball thirty yards, into the English goal. Then England scored two more. None of the teams in this year’s semifinals—England, Spain, Sweden, and Australia—has won the trophy before, but it was not a surprise to see this Australian team in the final four. The Matildas have consistently been among women’s soccer’s top teams; squad members play for clubs such as Arsenal, Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Chelsea. (Without Kerr, who was injured for much of the tournament, the winger Caitlin Foord, who plays for Arsenal, had been one of the Cup’s most brilliant forwards.) Australia had beaten England 2–0 in London, in April; a World Cup win was not unthinkable. But, at the final whistle, in Sydney, the Australian players sat and cried. England danced to “Sweet Caroline.” For the , much of the off-field talk, among soccer journalists and visiting commentators, had been about whether Australia—where football has always been a secondary sport—had become a soccer nation. The answer, from the start of the tournament, has been a slow, rumbling yes. I sat in desperately sold-out stadiums, and thousands of people crowded to watch in public squares and parks. A commenter in Australia recounted driving around delivering pizza and seeing every single TV tuned in to the Matildas’ game. In Melbourne, officials opened the grounds of the Australian Open and of Australian Rules stadiums, and people sat in the stands, in front of empty fields, watching soccer on the big screens. It felt as if soccer were taking over; it made the loss more painful. England, who had struggled to beat , and nearly lost to Nigeria on penalties, seemed to reserve their most ruthless level for the semi. The team was missing its best attacking player, the midfielder Lauren James, but her replacement, Ella Toone, scored the opener in Sydney with a spear of a shot that swerved off her right foot. Kerr equalized, and, for the next eight minutes, Australia pressed. The statistics—the refuge of the loser—show that England, over the match, was only slightly better. Both teams had five shots on target; the expected goals—a measure of the quality of those shots and chances—was in England’s favor only by 0.05 of a goal. But, in real life, at 1–1, Ellie Carpenter, Australia’s right back, who plays for Lyon, and was coming back from a yearlong , failed to sweep away a ball, and England’s Lauren Hemp fired it into the Australian goal. Sport is close and exhilarating and hopeful until it isn’t. England’s third goal came in the eighty-sixth minute, against a desperately rejigged attacking Australian side. Even at 2–1, Kerr missed two chances that, perhaps, she could have taken, if she had been more match-sharp. Maybe the difference was Sarina Wiegman, England’s coach, a tactical master from the Netherlands, who has now made the finals of two consecutive World Cups, and won two successive European Championships, with two different teams. England will face Spain on Sunday, in the final, in the same stadium. The loss will sting less soon, and eyes have already turned to the future. To get here, Australia had beaten France, in the longest penalty shoot-out in World Cup history, women’s or men’s. They destroyed Canada, the Olympic gold medallists, 4–0, while Kerr, injured, sat grinning on the bench. England had its own transformative soccer moment, in 2022, when the country hosted, and won, the Women’s European Championship. The journalist Suzanne Wrack, who was there, said that this year in Australia felt “next level. It has permeated so much more deeply into society than it did during the Euros.” The player who took Australia’s winning penalty against France—the scarcely believable twentieth kick—Cortnee Vine, plays for Sydney F.C. During the tournament, the club’s women’s team broke its record for member sign-ups, two months before the season starts. This World Cup has also brought new heights for women’s soccer globally, not just for its hosts. At various points, thirteen million people in Brazil watched their team play a single match; ten million in Germany watched theirs; and, in China, fifty-four million people watched their team’s last group game. Almost as many people in England watched the match against Australia, at 11 local time, as had watched their own Euros semifinal. Teams from Haiti, Nigeria, and Colombia held or beat the top teams of Europe. More Americans watched the U.S.’s matches at this World Cup, until the team was , than did in 2019, despite pre-dawn kickoff times. After an England win, fans like to sing “It’s coming home,” the chorus of “Three Lions,” which was originally written to mark England’s hosting of the men’s 1996 European Championships. (They lost in the semis.) It’s a song mostly about hurt and failure. It has lately been adopted to refer to winning—bringing “back”—the World Cup. This repurposing has always sat strangely with me, not for the presumption of winning, but of ownership. I watched England’s quarterfinal match, a close 2–1 win against Colombia, and, on the way out of the stadium, two English fans yelled at the Australians who had come to watch. “Stick to swimming!” one shouted. “Stick to surfing!” One of the most beloved sayings in Australian soccer—or football, as some of its fans prefer to call it—is “I told you so.” It was the catchphrase of Johnny Warren, a former captain of the men’s team, who, after he retired, took on the burden of being the chief soccer evangelist, educator, and optimist in a country that, broadly, did not really care. Warren, who died in 2004, said that Australia could win the World Cup. He thought that soccer could grow to become the country’s favorite sport. “I told you so” was something he imagined saying, at some future point, to those who disagreed. On Wednesday, eleven-and-a-half million people were watching on TV at home, making the game the most-viewed program since the current Australian television-ratings system began. More were watching in public and overseas. In the stadium, tens of thousands of people stayed long after it was over. ♦","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:00","image_url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64dfa7be9282bd4d7a7d76fb/master/pass/Zhou-Australia-World-Cup-Loss.jpg","source_id":"newyorker","source_priority":776,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England reaches the Women’s World Cup final despite key injuries","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/2023/08/19/england-reaches-the-womens-world-cup-final-despite-key-injuries","keywords":["Soccer"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"There were some doubts about England’s squad leading into the Women’s World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren’t with […]","content":"There were some doubts about England's squad leading into the Women's World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren't with the team because of injuries.

To continue reading, please subscribe: * There were some doubts about England’s squad leading into the Women’s World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren’t with the team because of injuries. Then there were questions about how they would handle the absence of forward Lauren James, who was suspended for both England’s quarterfinal and semifinal matches. But the Lionesses, led by coach Sarina Wiegman, have shown they are adept at adjustments — and it’s gotten them all the way to the title match. England plays Spain on Sunday for the World Cup trophy. The Lionesses defeated Australia 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. “The commitment of this team, the willingness to become better and to win games is so high. I haven’t seen any moment that’s any different. There’s never any complacency in the team,” Wiegman said. “Of course, we’ve had a lot of things thrown at us, with injuries. We had to find a way, ‘OK, what fits best now? How to play?’” England has played in the World Cup without their three playmakers from the 2022 European Championship squad. All three sustained knee injuries that kept them off Wiegman’s World Cup roster. Williamson, England’s versatile captain who can play defense or in the midfield, tore her ACL while playing with club team Arsenal in a match against Manchester United in April. Mead, who also plays for Arsenal, ruptured her ACL last November and wasn’t able to recover in time. She won the Golden Boot and the MVP award with six goals at Euro 2022. Kirby was injured during a match for Chelsea in February and announced in May she would miss the World Cup because of knee surgery. She has 17 goals in 65 appearances for England. She started all of England’s games during the team’s run in the Euros. At first it looked as though those absences were going to be difficult to overcome. England lost 2-0 to Australia and played to a scoreless draw with Portugal in a pair of exhibition matches ahead of the World Cup. Then Keira Walsh, the team’s defensive midfielder, was hurt during a group-stage match against Denmark. Carried off on a stretcher, she at one point was seen saying “I’ve done my knee.” Ultimately, she missed just one game. Williamson attended the team’s quarterfinal victory over Colombia and visited the team’s training camp. She was also expected to be at the final Sunday in Sydney. “Obviously, they would want nothing more than to be here,” Walsh said about her missing teammates. “It is probably a bit bittersweet. They want us to win and we would want them to be here as well. Leah, Beth and Fran have been really supportive. They have messaged after every game. Hopefully, we can get the job done on Sunday and make them proud of us.” Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. Williamson, Kirby and Mead were among a number of high-profile international players who missed out on the World Cup because of knee injuries, and particularly ACL tears. The list included Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema, Canada’s Janine Beckie and young U.S. forward Catarina Macario. James is able to return for Sunday’s final after a two-game suspension for stomping on a Nigeria player following a tackle in the knockout round. She has three goals and three assists in the tournament. “As a player, you understand that at any time something can pop up, and things can change. Football is never a given,” England captain Millie Bright said. “And while we’d absolutely love everyone to be here, it’s been such a great opportunity for other people to come in and step up. We’re really blessed as a nation that we have such a big pool of players to choose from, so much talent.” ___ AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-08-19 09:14:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Clermont suit Antoine Makoumbou (Cagliari)","link":"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Clermont-suit-antoine-makoumbou-cagliari/1414459#xtor=RSS-1","keywords":["Foot, Transferts"],"creator":["José Barroso"],"video_url":null,"description":"Clermont s'intéresse au milieu congolais Antoine Makoumbou (Cagliari, Serie B), également pisté par le Fenerbahçe et Bologne.","content":"Alors que Saîf-Eddine Khaoui a rejoint les Émirats arabes unis cet été, Clermont piste le milieu Antoine Makoumbou (25 ans).

A latecomer to boxing, Bridges has enjoyed a whirlwind start to her career The 36-year-old Aussie won the IBF featherweight title in her ninth fight as a pro But Bridges has gained even more notoriety for her activities outside of the ring By Adrian Bishop For Mailonline Published: 10:07, 19 August 2023 | Updated: 10:07, 19 August 2023 e-mail View comments The old saying 'looks can be deceiving' has perhaps never been as true as in the case of IBF featherweight champion Ebanie Bridges. A late starter in boxing, Bridges trained in karate and muay thai as a youth before embarking on a successful career in bodybuilding, winning various titles around the Sydney area. Though she had some combat sports experience, Bridges' route to a career as a professional was unique in that she had initially started taking boxing classes solely as a way to improve her footwork for prospective career in kickboxing. But it was pugilism where Bridges would find a newfound passion, and despite turning her attention to the sweet science as a relative latecomer she found immediate success, winning Australian Golden Gloves titles at bantamweight in 2016 and 2017. Making her pro debut aged 32, and despite the early portion of his career being disrupted by the pandemic, Bridges wasted no time undergoing a protracted development phase as a professional. Ebanie Bridges has become one of the most recognisable faces in all of boxing despite only making her debut four years ago The 36-year-old has become a regular feature of British boxing cards, and won a world title in her ninth pro fight Bridges defended her world title with an eighth-round TKO of Shannon O'Connell in December Instead she garnered a devoted following from the outset thanks to her exciting style and penchant for weighing-in wearing lingerie before fighting for the WBA bantamweight title in just her sixth career outing. Though she would find herself on the wrong side of a unanimous decision on that night at the Copper Box against Shannon Courtenay in 2021, Bridges continued undeterred. A Leeds United fan since childhood, the Blonde Bomber has made the Yorkshire city her adopted home for and explained that her love affair with the club began thanks to another of the city's Australian imports. 'He's my fave, what an animal,' Bridges said of former Whites striker Mark Viduka to Pub Talk podcast. 'Obviously when I played football in the late 90s and early 00s Leeds was huge in Australia. 'When you're around my age group, my era there are a lot of Leeds fans because we were in the Premier League.' Moving her career permanently to the UK, Bridges returned to winning ways with two further fights in 2021, beating Bec Connolly and Mailys Gangloff to position herself for another world title shot. This time Bridges would make the best of her opportunity, defeating Maria Cecilia Roman to capture the IBF bantamweight title in her adopted home city, before retaining the belt with a gritty grudge-match TKO of Shannon O'Connell . But it's not just Bridges' exploits inside the ring that have made her one of the most recognisable faces in the sport today. The 36-year-old has also built a sizeable following through regularly sharing adult content on the subscription site OnlyFans, and flashed her bra to a reporter in December when asked to explain her weigh-in outfit. 'It's like lace, has my handle, subscribe now,' said Bridges. 'I don't know, what is it? It's sexy, isn't it? Bridges is also a devoted Leeds United fan, having started supporting the team due to her love of former Whites star Mark Viduka In addition to her all-action style, the former bodybuilder has also gained fans for her habit of weighing in while wearing lingerie Bridges (pictured) has left a shocked in December by lifting her shirt and flashing her bra during an interview about her controversial weigh-in outfit 'It's more pretty stripper not so much skanky stripper, you know what I mean?' Bridges has also struck up a close friendship with social media personality turned influencer boxer Elle Brooke, with the pair engaging in a bizarre public bet late last year. With Bridges' beloved Leeds taking on Brooke's favourite team, Man City, in the Premier League on Boxing Day at Elland Road, the Blonde Bomber tweeted that the pair had agreed that the winner could punch the loser. 'She hits hard but I reckon she would be scared to hit me,' Bridges told Daily Mail Australia after City ran out 3-1 winners. 'But a bet is a bet [so] she gets a free shot.' Facing criticism online for opening an OnlyFans account, Bridges revealed that the move had proven to be significantly lucrative, and that her enjoyment of the sport is now the main reason she is continues her career in the ring. 'You wouldn't even believe it if I said it,' she replied when asked how much she has made on the platform in an interview with Talksport . 'It's only been 10 weeks and I won't disclose [the amount] but from the second day of launching my OnlyFans I've been in the top 0.01 per cent of earners. 'I don't even know why I'm boxing, probably because I love hitting people.' Bridges has also created headlines for her friendship with UFC legend Conor McGregor. The pair were pictured together at Katie Taylor's defeat to Chantelle Cameron in May, with multiple pictures showing the Irishman throwing his arm around her at ringside. Though she would later reveal on social media that she felt 'manhandled' during the encounter , the pair have remained close ever since and were again pictured together in attendance for Anthony Joshua's KO win against Robert Helenius earlier this month. The OnlyFans star has also struck up a close friendship with UFC legend Conor McGregor But Bridges shocked fans after claiming she felt the Irishman had 'manhandled' her at ringside Despite the comments the pair were once again pictured together at ringside earlier this month Despite a mixed response online, with some fans referring to her as a 'clout chaser' , Bridges affirmed that she enjoyed her time with McGregor. 'Had a great night ringside at the Anthony Joshua fight with my pal Conor McGregor enjoying his smooth Irish Forged Stout,' she said after the fight. 'It's always a good time with Conor - he's always the life of the party and very humble. 'As we know, I like to break the internet, so I thought why not rock a sexy outfit, as I do, and promote Conor's new stout while I'm at it.' Hand surgery earlier this year has curtailed the Aussie's activity inside the ring just as her stardom grows to newfound heights, but if anything is certain it is that anything Ebanie Bridges does has the power to capture the public's attention.

La promesse a été tenue. Les Scandinaves ont battu Sam Kerr et sa bande, ce samedi, à Brisbane et remporté la médaille de bronze de la Coupe du monde pour la quatrième fois de l'histoire après 1991, 2011 et 2019. Sorties par l'Espagne en demies, les joueuses de Peter Gerhardsson ont retrouvé leur solidité en ne concédant aucun but et ont, en plus, fait preuve d'efficacité. La première étincelle a été allumée dès la première minute par Stina Blackstenius trouvée par Asllani (1re). L'ancienne Parisienne a été omniprésente durant cette première période avec notamment un centre pour la tête de Fridolina Rolfö, qui a heurté la transversale (27e). Mais quelques secondes plus tôt, Clare Hunt avait déséquilibré Blackstenius dans la surface australienne et après vérification par le VAR, l'arbitre a accordé un penalty aux Scandinaves transformé par Roflö pour son troisième but dans la compétition. Les Suédoises ont continué à mettre la pression par Asllani (40e), Angeldal (45e+2) et Blackstenius (45e+3). Les Australiennes n'ont pas été en reste puisque Hayley Raso a obligé Zecira Musovic à un bel arrêt, à la suite d'un centre impeccable d'Ellie Carpenter (23e).

Asllani comme en 2019 La seconde période a été moins riche en occasions mais les Suédoises ont su enfoncer le clou. Déjà buteuse lors du match pour la troisième place en 2019 contre l'Angleterre (2-1), Asllani a remis ça en seconde période sur un bon décalage de Blackstenius (62e), qui avait été trouvée précédemment par l'attaquante de l'AC Milan. La rencontre s'est un peu emballée avec le sauvetage d'Arnold sur une frappe du gauche de Blackstenius (66e) et la reprise à bout pourtant de Polkinghorne, repoussée par Musovic, avec peut-être une main au préalable sur son contrôle (70e).

But the Montreal native and Alouettes veteran also wondered, more than once, what things might be like if ever he was given an opportunity to play linebacker, his natural position on defence. After all, the 6-foot-4, 235 pounder was part of the 2014 Vanier Cup championship team at Université de Montréal and was a third-round (24th overall) draft pick — high enough that a significant pro career seemed reasonable — of the B.C. Lions in 2017. Article content Article content “I don’t know, maybe I didn’t get a chance, an opportunity to show what I could do,” Chagnon, 30, told the Montreal Gazette this week. “That’s all right. I know my role on special teams was important. Special teams in the CFL are really important. I knew you could have a good career, a great career, playing on special teams. Guys Like Jason Arakgi did it. (Winnipeg’s) Mike Miller is still doing it today. “But of course,” Chagnon quickly added, “I wanted to play on defence. I just really never had that chance. I thought about it, but maybe the coaches only saw me as a special teams player and backup on defence? I can’t tell you why, honestly.” But everything changed for Chagnon at the end of July, against Calgary . Middle-linebacker Avery Williams was put on the six-game injured list and Als defensive co-ordinator Noel Thorpe, knowing his team was coming off a bye week in the schedule, on a three-game losing streak and seeking to change things up, decided to utilize a 30 defence — three down linemen and four linebackers — on approximately 50 per cent of plays. That created an opening for Chagnon, one that he has seized with relish. Article content Article content In his three games at linebacker, he has made seven tackles, displayed a ferocity for punishing opponents and hasn’t looked out of place while continuing to play on special teams. “He has proven more than capable of playing at a high level, and now he’s had the opportunity,” Thorpe said. “When those opportunities come around, you have to make the most of them. He has definitely done that. He’s smart, instinctual and has a nose for the football. He plays with really good leverage. We feel like we haven’t missed a beat with him.” Chagnon’s story is one of perseverance and patience, of finally being rewarded for years of toiling in near anonymity. Nothing ever came easy for him, whether it was athletics or academics. “That’s been me forever, since I was young,” he said. “In everything. I never had the easiest way. I had to work to get my spot in everything and had to earn it every day. It’s been like that my whole life, from CEGEP to university. I had to go up the ladder after playing special teams. I had to try and get a spot on special teams and see how it goes.” A hockey defenceman at first, Chagnon realized his skating meant a pro career was unlikely. When his family moved from Lorraine to Blainville, and the arena was too far from his home, his father suggested a change in sports, given his son’s developing frame. Even then, the change didn’t come naturally; Chagnon’s struggles in the classroom proved an additional challenge if he wanted to play on his high school team. Article content He originally went to CEGEP Vieux-Montréal but was only part of the practice roster before transferring to Lionel Groulx, where he eventually caught the eye of Als general manager Danny Maciocia, then the Carabins’ head coach, who recruited him to university. “He can play on all four phases of special teams,” Maciocia said. “He’s long. He’s pretty dynamic. He’s a student of the game. Sometimes it’s just a question of there being an opportunity. It has to present itself. When it does … it may just knock once. But if you get that opportunity, cash in on it by making a couple of plays, tackles, doing your job and getting the attention of your coaches, there’s a sense I can play this guy, I feel comfortable with him and there’s a comfort level that kicks in. Once it kicks in, you can build off that.” Chagnon spent three seasons with the Lions but struggled as a rookie. The anxiety of being across the country, separated from his family, was overbearing. He signed with the Als as a free agent in 2020, but the season was cancelled due to COVID-19. He was released in July 2021, signed with Ottawa, but returned to Montreal last season. Article content But he also put the cancelled season to good use, returning to university to complete his business degree, fulfilling a promise made years earlier to both his father and Maciocia. Many CFL contracts contain a bonus clause that kicks in provided a player’s on the field for 51 per cent of the game. It has been a useful resource for Chagnon — a new homeowner in Lasalle and the father of a two-year-old boy — the last three weeks. “It’s good to have the extra money, but I’m not relying on that to put food on my table and pay the mortgage,” he said. hzurkowsky@postmedia.com twitter.com/HerbZurkowsky1 Article content Share this article in your social network","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"montrealgazette","source_priority":45963,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Injury That Has Upended the Women’s World Cup","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-injury-that-has-upended-the-womens-world-cup","keywords":["Sports / The Sporting Scene"],"creator":["Louisa Thomas"],"video_url":null,"description":"Some of the best players in the world have gone down with A.C.L. tears—an injury that, for reasons which aren’t entirely clear, women experience far more often than men.","content":"It is no surprise that England is in the final of the . They are the world’s fourth-ranked team, the reigning European champions, and were among the semifinalists at the World Cup four years ago. The final was the expectation, not the goal. When England dominated Germany in the Euro finals last September, there were more than eighty-seven thousand fans at Wembley Stadium. England beat the United States at a friendly a month later, and some seventy-seven thousand people came to watch. And yet that team is not this one. The revelation of that roster was Beth Mead, who established herself as an almost unstoppable force in a dazzling display at the Euros, winning the Golden Boot for most goals and the Golden Ball for the tournament’s best player. In November, she tore her A.C.L. A few months later, England’s captain, Leah Williamson, bent her leg awkwardly as she came over the ball on a challenge in a game for her club team, Arsenal. Face down on the field, she threw up a hand to signal for help, then pounded the earth in obvious pain and frustration. Surely, she knew, even then—before she limped from the pitch, supported by medics; before the MRI confirmed the grim diagnosis; before the surgery—that she’d torn her A.C.L. Everyone knew. Everyone had seen it happen too many times before. In early May, the England midfielder Fran Kirby, a two-time F.A. player of the year, announced that she, too, would be undergoing surgery to repair an injured knee, and would miss the World Cup. And the tournament had hardly started when Keira Walsh, the team’s fulcrum in the midfield, went down with a leg injury. “I’ve done my knee,” she reportedly told medical staff as she was carried away on a stretcher. When it was announced that her A.C.L. was, in fact, still intact, and that she would be able to return—in the end, she missed only a game and a half—the news was presented as a kind of miracle. Even without these players, England is still a phenomenal team. It overcame a —propelled by the passion of the home country’s fans and the unstoppable force of —with ruthless, clinical play, despite missing yet another star: the dynamite young forward Lauren James, who had to sit out for two games after receiving a red card for stomping on a Nigerian player, Michelle Alozie. But England has been gritting out wins, not racing to them. It’s tempting to wonder what the team would look like if not for the rash of ligament ruptures. But you could say that of several teams. England is far from the only one dealing with A.C.L. injuries. The Netherlands, last year’s finalist, might have gone further than the quarterfinals if they’d had their best player, Vivianne Miedema, who tore her A.C.L. last winter. The United States’ is less shocking when you consider that Catarina Macario, perhaps their best player, was out with a torn A.C.L. (Their top goal scorer in 2023, Mallory Swanson, missed the tournament, too, with a torn patellar tendon.) Canada, the reigning Olympic champions, lost their star forward, Janine Beckie, to an A.C.L. tear in March. France’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto, a nominee for the 2022 Ballon d’Or, tore her A.C.L. last year. Her French teammate Delphine Cascarino tore hers in May. The list goes on. Myriad factors have played into the chaos and surprise of this World Cup—none of the four semifinalists has ever won the championship—but the ripple effect of A.C.L. injuries is one of the biggest. You might even call it a crisis—if it were anything new. The anterior cruciate ligament is a thick band of tissue connecting the thigh bone (the femur) to the shinbone (the tibia). It’s found inside the knee joint, in front of the posterior cruciate ligament (P.C.L.), which it crosses to form a kind of sturdy “X.” The A.C.L. keeps the shinbone from sliding in front of the thigh bone and keeps the knee in place. But when it is stressed in certain ways—during a quick pivot, for instance, or an awkward landing or sudden impact—it can rip. When that happens, the knee loses stability. After a full rupture, it generally won’t regenerate or heal on its own. Instead, doctors will take a portion of the patient’s hamstring, quadriceps, or patellar tendon, or tissue from an organ donor, and graft it into the knee to create a new A.C.L. This can work well, particularly if you have access to top-flight doctors, as most professional athletes do. But it is painful, and recovery is long and arduous. It’s expensive, too, if you’re footing the bill: out-of-pocket costs in the U.S. can be upward of ten thousand dollars. Full recovery can take anywhere from nine months to more than a year—an eternity in the short life of an élite athlete. Even when an athlete regains most of her form, the reconstructed knee can be vulnerable. A significant percentage of athletes who have torn their A.C.L. once do it again within a few years. Around half develop osteoarthritis five to fifteen years after surgery. People who tear their A.C.L.s are around seven times more likely to need a total knee replacement down the road. And, no matter how common the surgery has become, the healing process can be unpredictable. Christen Press, a key player on the U.S. team that won the , recently underwent her fourth operation on a knee that she tore up last year. Male athletes tear their A.C.L.s, too, in alarming numbers—in the Premier League earlier this month, Jurrien Timber had barely stepped on the field after a flashy, forty-million-dollar transfer to Arsenal when he damaged his. But the rate is significantly higher among female athletes, particularly in sports that involve sudden stops, pivots, and accelerations. Just how much higher is unclear. (Kathryn Ackerman, a doctor specializing in sports medicine—she runs the Wu Tsai Female Athlete Program at Boston Children’s Hospital—told me that women are four to six times more likely than men to tear their A.C.L.s.) Why there is such a difference is not entirely clear, either. There are morphological factors: women often have a smaller notch on their femurs than men, which gives the ligament less leeway when stretched; they typically have wider hips, which changes the angle of the femur. Women tend to have stronger quadriceps relative to their hamstrings, and to land more flat-footed and with stiffer knees. There is a strong suspicion that menstrual cycles increase the risk of ruptures, by affecting ligament laxity, but, as is the case with so many medical issues affecting women, the theory has not been the subject of sufficient rigorous study. Still, biology is not destiny, and for too long it was treated as such. The Football Association, English soccer’s governing body, banned women’s teams in 1921, stating “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged.” The ban was not lifted until 1970. A narrow focus on how the morphology of women affects injury rates not only runs the risk of deterring girls from competing in the first place; it also threatens to reinforce the false idea that sports are unsuitable for women, while ignoring crucial social and cultural factors. For decades, women have often played on inferior fields, which is known to increase the risk of non-contact leg injuries. (This was a sticking point for the U.S. women’s national team in their fight for equal pay and conditions.) They have played without sufficient medical infrastructure or training support. They have participated in training programs that are insufficient for their needs. As opportunities and access have expanded, the quality of their environment hasn’t quite kept pace. England’s domestic league wasn’t fully professional until five years ago. Since then, traditional powerhouses—Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and so on—have begun investing more of their resources and influence in the women’s game, to tremendous effect. Now England’s women’s league and national team both occupy spaces in the upper echelon of international sport. The teams have legitimate television contracts with the BBC and Sky Sports, and receive continual coverage from places like the and the Athletic. Increasingly, the stars are superstars. The schedule has grown along with demand; players are playing more, and with greater intensity. But that extra load on their legs has consequences. And, even now, at all levels, women’s teams are more likely than men’s teams to travel by coach instead of business class, commercial instead of charter. A National Women’s Soccer League game was once played on a fifty-eight-yard-wide field in a Triple-A baseball stadium. Women typically wear cleats made from molds of men’s feet, and that shape affects how arches and heels are supported when an athlete lands. (This could be especially significant when it comes to A.C.L.s, given the way that perilous ground-foot interactions can stress the knee.) They are often, even at the élite level, supported by smaller medical staff, with less training, than the men receive. The disparity in resources extends down through the youth levels. That, in fact, is where some of the biggest problems are. For all the attention that A.C.L. injuries among élite players are getting, many of the hundreds of thousands that occur each year happen to younger players. Generally, girls are at high risk of A.C.L. injuries after they have gone through puberty but before they have built up their strength. The first time that the U.S. national team member Emily Fox tore her A.C.L., she was a freshman in college. Megan Rapinoe tore hers three times, the first as a college sophomore. Alex Morgan tore hers in high school. And they are the lucky ones: many younger athletes, who don’t have the access to doctors and rehabilitation programs that top athletes do—or who are simply, and understandably, traumatized by their injury—quit the sport they were playing when they were hurt. Some quit sports altogether. The injury, after all, can be as difficult psychologically as it is physically. “I don’t know if it’s over for me—I don’t know if I’ll be back at this level,” Alexia Putellas, perhaps the best player in the world, reportedly told her agent after she ruptured her A.C.L., in 2022. Chloe Kelly, a forward for England, described feeling “worthless” after injuring her A.C.L. in 2021. Those who come back often have the risk of injury in the back of their minds. Alex Culvin, the head of strategy and research in women’s soccer for , the game’s global union, Rory Smith of the , “We’ve had a lot of feedback from players saying they feel unsafe.” The players, Culvin added, want more research into the different factors that particularly affect women. “There have been a lot of studies done in female athletes about A.C.L. injuries, but some of them weren’t done that well,” Ackerman, the doctor specializing in sports medicine, told me. But that’s changing, she said. Research methods are improving. And there are new surgical techniques, too, such as one developed by Martha Murray, which helps the A.C.L. heal without replacing it with a graft. There are also ways to lower the risk of non-contact lower-body injuries that are free and accessible to anyone. Some twenty years ago, doctors and trainers developed a dynamic warmup-and-training program to improve biomechanics, increase core stability, and improve balance. It’s known as , for “Prevent injury, enhance performance,” and has evolved into various iterations since its inception. Several studies, particularly of adolescent females, found that adhering to this kind of plan significantly reduced non-contact A.C.L. injuries. built upon to create its own injury-prevention program, which takes about fifteen or twenty minutes, a few times a week. It is available online. Another version is available in a free app, from the Hospital for Special Surgery. Of course, it is hard to get people to floss for thirty seconds, let alone to get young people who may not be approaching a sport very seriously—or even ones who are—to spend an hour a week doing hyper-specific hopping exercises, preparing against some abstract event. That said, the prevalence of A.C.L. injuries has increased awareness of these prehabilitation techniques. It’s the kind of thing you don’t think about until it’s all you can think about. Putellas is back on the field and will be playing for Spain in the final, but is far from full strength. Given the high calibre of players around her, it seems she doesn’t need to be at her very best to make a contribution. England has shown its depth and ability to adjust—to asphyxiate opponents instead of pummelling them. Williamson, Mead, and Kirby, though, can only watch. ♦","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:00","image_url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64df9ff899c75b29bf387da0/master/pass/Thomas-WC-Inj-sports.jpg","source_id":"newyorker","source_priority":776,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"This World Cup Left Its Mark on Australia","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/this-world-cup-left-its-mark-on-australia","keywords":["Sports / The Sporting Scene"],"creator":["Naaman Zhou"],"video_url":null,"description":"Despite a heartbreaking loss in the semifinals, Australia’s national team has built an excitement for the game that will last.","content":"Only four countries have won a Women’s World Cup; Australia, for now, will not be one of them. In soccer, the semifinal can be the cruellest match. On Wednesday night, in Sydney, the Matildas, as the Australian women’s team are known, played in their first World Cup semifinal, against England, and fell, at home, with one goal and two mistakes, just short of their first final. Losing a World Cup semifinal is supposed to be England’s thing. (There’s a line in “Three Lions,” the country’s unofficial soccer anthem, about it.) For roughly half of this match, England, the current European champions, and Australia, the competition co-hosts, were roughly even. In the sixty-third minute, Australia’s captain, , one of the world’s most devastating strikers, dribbled for forty yards, then half chipped, half blasted the ball thirty yards, into the English goal. Then England scored two more. None of the teams in this year’s semifinals—England, Spain, Sweden, and Australia—has won the trophy before, but it was not a surprise to see this Australian team in the final four. The Matildas have consistently been among women’s soccer’s top teams; squad members play for clubs such as Arsenal, Real Madrid, Manchester City, and Chelsea. (Without Kerr, who was injured for much of the tournament, the winger Caitlin Foord, who plays for Arsenal, had been one of the Cup’s most brilliant forwards.) Australia had beaten England 2–0 in London, in April; a World Cup win was not unthinkable. But, at the final whistle, in Sydney, the Australian players sat and cried. England danced to “Sweet Caroline.” For the , much of the off-field talk, among soccer journalists and visiting commentators, had been about whether Australia—where football has always been a secondary sport—had become a soccer nation. The answer, from the start of the tournament, has been a slow, rumbling yes. I sat in desperately sold-out stadiums, and thousands of people crowded to watch in public squares and parks. A commenter in Australia recounted driving around delivering pizza and seeing every single TV tuned in to the Matildas’ game. In Melbourne, officials opened the grounds of the Australian Open and of Australian Rules stadiums, and people sat in the stands, in front of empty fields, watching soccer on the big screens. It felt as if soccer were taking over; it made the loss more painful. England, who had struggled to beat , and nearly lost to Nigeria on penalties, seemed to reserve their most ruthless level for the semi. The team was missing its best attacking player, the midfielder Lauren James, but her replacement, Ella Toone, scored the opener in Sydney with a spear of a shot that swerved off her right foot. Kerr equalized, and, for the next eight minutes, Australia pressed. The statistics—the refuge of the loser—show that England, over the match, was only slightly better. Both teams had five shots on target; the expected goals—a measure of the quality of those shots and chances—was in England’s favor only by 0.05 of a goal. But, in real life, at 1–1, Ellie Carpenter, Australia’s right back, who plays for Lyon, and was coming back from a yearlong , failed to sweep away a ball, and England’s Lauren Hemp fired it into the Australian goal. Sport is close and exhilarating and hopeful until it isn’t. England’s third goal came in the eighty-sixth minute, against a desperately rejigged attacking Australian side. Even at 2–1, Kerr missed two chances that, perhaps, she could have taken, if she had been more match-sharp. Maybe the difference was Sarina Wiegman, England’s coach, a tactical master from the Netherlands, who has now made the finals of two consecutive World Cups, and won two successive European Championships, with two different teams. England will face Spain on Sunday, in the final, in the same stadium. The loss will sting less soon, and eyes have already turned to the future. To get here, Australia had beaten France, in the longest penalty shoot-out in World Cup history, women’s or men’s. They destroyed Canada, the Olympic gold medallists, 4–0, while Kerr, injured, sat grinning on the bench. England had its own transformative soccer moment, in 2022, when the country hosted, and won, the Women’s European Championship. The journalist Suzanne Wrack, who was there, said that this year in Australia felt “next level. It has permeated so much more deeply into society than it did during the Euros.” The player who took Australia’s winning penalty against France—the scarcely believable twentieth kick—Cortnee Vine, plays for Sydney F.C. During the tournament, the club’s women’s team broke its record for member sign-ups, two months before the season starts. This World Cup has also brought new heights for women’s soccer globally, not just for its hosts. At various points, thirteen million people in Brazil watched their team play a single match; ten million in Germany watched theirs; and, in China, fifty-four million people watched their team’s last group game. Almost as many people in England watched the match against Australia, at 11 local time, as had watched their own Euros semifinal. Teams from Haiti, Nigeria, and Colombia held or beat the top teams of Europe. More Americans watched the U.S.’s matches at this World Cup, until the team was , than did in 2019, despite pre-dawn kickoff times. After an England win, fans like to sing “It’s coming home,” the chorus of “Three Lions,” which was originally written to mark England’s hosting of the men’s 1996 European Championships. (They lost in the semis.) It’s a song mostly about hurt and failure. It has lately been adopted to refer to winning—bringing “back”—the World Cup. This repurposing has always sat strangely with me, not for the presumption of winning, but of ownership. I watched England’s quarterfinal match, a close 2–1 win against Colombia, and, on the way out of the stadium, two English fans yelled at the Australians who had come to watch. “Stick to swimming!” one shouted. “Stick to surfing!” One of the most beloved sayings in Australian soccer—or football, as some of its fans prefer to call it—is “I told you so.” It was the catchphrase of Johnny Warren, a former captain of the men’s team, who, after he retired, took on the burden of being the chief soccer evangelist, educator, and optimist in a country that, broadly, did not really care. Warren, who died in 2004, said that Australia could win the World Cup. He thought that soccer could grow to become the country’s favorite sport. “I told you so” was something he imagined saying, at some future point, to those who disagreed. On Wednesday, eleven-and-a-half million people were watching on TV at home, making the game the most-viewed program since the current Australian television-ratings system began. More were watching in public and overseas. In the stadium, tens of thousands of people stayed long after it was over. ♦","pubDate":"2023-08-19 10:00:00","image_url":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64dfa7be9282bd4d7a7d76fb/master/pass/Zhou-Australia-World-Cup-Loss.jpg","source_id":"newyorker","source_priority":776,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England reaches the Women’s World Cup final despite key injuries","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/soccer/2023/08/19/england-reaches-the-womens-world-cup-final-despite-key-injuries","keywords":["Soccer"],"creator":["Feedloaderapi"],"video_url":null,"description":"There were some doubts about England’s squad leading into the Women’s World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren’t with […]","content":"There were some doubts about England's squad leading into the Women's World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren't with the team because of injuries.

To continue reading, please subscribe: * There were some doubts about England’s squad leading into the Women’s World Cup because a trio of dominant players — Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby — weren’t with the team because of injuries. Then there were questions about how they would handle the absence of forward Lauren James, who was suspended for both England’s quarterfinal and semifinal matches. But the Lionesses, led by coach Sarina Wiegman, have shown they are adept at adjustments — and it’s gotten them all the way to the title match. England plays Spain on Sunday for the World Cup trophy. The Lionesses defeated Australia 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. “The commitment of this team, the willingness to become better and to win games is so high. I haven’t seen any moment that’s any different. There’s never any complacency in the team,” Wiegman said. “Of course, we’ve had a lot of things thrown at us, with injuries. We had to find a way, ‘OK, what fits best now? How to play?’” England has played in the World Cup without their three playmakers from the 2022 European Championship squad. All three sustained knee injuries that kept them off Wiegman’s World Cup roster. Williamson, England’s versatile captain who can play defense or in the midfield, tore her ACL while playing with club team Arsenal in a match against Manchester United in April. Mead, who also plays for Arsenal, ruptured her ACL last November and wasn’t able to recover in time. She won the Golden Boot and the MVP award with six goals at Euro 2022. Kirby was injured during a match for Chelsea in February and announced in May she would miss the World Cup because of knee surgery. She has 17 goals in 65 appearances for England. She started all of England’s games during the team’s run in the Euros. At first it looked as though those absences were going to be difficult to overcome. England lost 2-0 to Australia and played to a scoreless draw with Portugal in a pair of exhibition matches ahead of the World Cup. Then Keira Walsh, the team’s defensive midfielder, was hurt during a group-stage match against Denmark. Carried off on a stretcher, she at one point was seen saying “I’ve done my knee.” Ultimately, she missed just one game. Williamson attended the team’s quarterfinal victory over Colombia and visited the team’s training camp. She was also expected to be at the final Sunday in Sydney. “Obviously, they would want nothing more than to be here,” Walsh said about her missing teammates. “It is probably a bit bittersweet. They want us to win and we would want them to be here as well. Leah, Beth and Fran have been really supportive. They have messaged after every game. Hopefully, we can get the job done on Sunday and make them proud of us.” Fridays The Free Press sports editor keeps you up to date on all that’s happening on the ice, the field, the court, and places in between. Williamson, Kirby and Mead were among a number of high-profile international players who missed out on the World Cup because of knee injuries, and particularly ACL tears. The list included Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema, Canada’s Janine Beckie and young U.S. forward Catarina Macario. James is able to return for Sunday’s final after a two-game suspension for stomping on a Nigeria player following a tackle in the knockout round. She has three goals and three assists in the tournament. “As a player, you understand that at any time something can pop up, and things can change. Football is never a given,” England captain Millie Bright said. “And while we’d absolutely love everyone to be here, it’s been such a great opportunity for other people to come in and step up. We’re really blessed as a nation that we have such a big pool of players to choose from, so much talent.” ___ AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-08-19 09:14:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Clermont suit Antoine Makoumbou (Cagliari)","link":"https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Clermont-suit-antoine-makoumbou-cagliari/1414459#xtor=RSS-1","keywords":["Foot, Transferts"],"creator":["José Barroso"],"video_url":null,"description":"Clermont s'intéresse au milieu congolais Antoine Makoumbou (Cagliari, Serie B), également pisté par le Fenerbahçe et Bologne.","content":"Alors que Saîf-Eddine Khaoui a rejoint les Émirats arabes unis cet été, Clermont piste le milieu Antoine Makoumbou (25 ans).

A latecomer to boxing, Bridges has enjoyed a whirlwind start to her career The 36-year-old Aussie won the IBF featherweight title in her ninth fight as a pro But Bridges has gained even more notoriety for her activities outside of the ring By Adrian Bishop For Mailonline Published: 10:07, 19 August 2023 | Updated: 10:07, 19 August 2023 e-mail View comments The old saying 'looks can be deceiving' has perhaps never been as true as in the case of IBF featherweight champion Ebanie Bridges. A late starter in boxing, Bridges trained in karate and muay thai as a youth before embarking on a successful career in bodybuilding, winning various titles around the Sydney area. Though she had some combat sports experience, Bridges' route to a career as a professional was unique in that she had initially started taking boxing classes solely as a way to improve her footwork for prospective career in kickboxing. But it was pugilism where Bridges would find a newfound passion, and despite turning her attention to the sweet science as a relative latecomer she found immediate success, winning Australian Golden Gloves titles at bantamweight in 2016 and 2017. Making her pro debut aged 32, and despite the early portion of his career being disrupted by the pandemic, Bridges wasted no time undergoing a protracted development phase as a professional. Ebanie Bridges has become one of the most recognisable faces in all of boxing despite only making her debut four years ago The 36-year-old has become a regular feature of British boxing cards, and won a world title in her ninth pro fight Bridges defended her world title with an eighth-round TKO of Shannon O'Connell in December Instead she garnered a devoted following from the outset thanks to her exciting style and penchant for weighing-in wearing lingerie before fighting for the WBA bantamweight title in just her sixth career outing. Though she would find herself on the wrong side of a unanimous decision on that night at the Copper Box against Shannon Courtenay in 2021, Bridges continued undeterred. A Leeds United fan since childhood, the Blonde Bomber has made the Yorkshire city her adopted home for and explained that her love affair with the club began thanks to another of the city's Australian imports. 'He's my fave, what an animal,' Bridges said of former Whites striker Mark Viduka to Pub Talk podcast. 'Obviously when I played football in the late 90s and early 00s Leeds was huge in Australia. 'When you're around my age group, my era there are a lot of Leeds fans because we were in the Premier League.' Moving her career permanently to the UK, Bridges returned to winning ways with two further fights in 2021, beating Bec Connolly and Mailys Gangloff to position herself for another world title shot. This time Bridges would make the best of her opportunity, defeating Maria Cecilia Roman to capture the IBF bantamweight title in her adopted home city, before retaining the belt with a gritty grudge-match TKO of Shannon O'Connell . But it's not just Bridges' exploits inside the ring that have made her one of the most recognisable faces in the sport today. The 36-year-old has also built a sizeable following through regularly sharing adult content on the subscription site OnlyFans, and flashed her bra to a reporter in December when asked to explain her weigh-in outfit. 'It's like lace, has my handle, subscribe now,' said Bridges. 'I don't know, what is it? It's sexy, isn't it? Bridges is also a devoted Leeds United fan, having started supporting the team due to her love of former Whites star Mark Viduka In addition to her all-action style, the former bodybuilder has also gained fans for her habit of weighing in while wearing lingerie Bridges (pictured) has left a shocked in December by lifting her shirt and flashing her bra during an interview about her controversial weigh-in outfit 'It's more pretty stripper not so much skanky stripper, you know what I mean?' Bridges has also struck up a close friendship with social media personality turned influencer boxer Elle Brooke, with the pair engaging in a bizarre public bet late last year. With Bridges' beloved Leeds taking on Brooke's favourite team, Man City, in the Premier League on Boxing Day at Elland Road, the Blonde Bomber tweeted that the pair had agreed that the winner could punch the loser. 'She hits hard but I reckon she would be scared to hit me,' Bridges told Daily Mail Australia after City ran out 3-1 winners. 'But a bet is a bet [so] she gets a free shot.' Facing criticism online for opening an OnlyFans account, Bridges revealed that the move had proven to be significantly lucrative, and that her enjoyment of the sport is now the main reason she is continues her career in the ring. 'You wouldn't even believe it if I said it,' she replied when asked how much she has made on the platform in an interview with Talksport . 'It's only been 10 weeks and I won't disclose [the amount] but from the second day of launching my OnlyFans I've been in the top 0.01 per cent of earners. 'I don't even know why I'm boxing, probably because I love hitting people.' Bridges has also created headlines for her friendship with UFC legend Conor McGregor. The pair were pictured together at Katie Taylor's defeat to Chantelle Cameron in May, with multiple pictures showing the Irishman throwing his arm around her at ringside. Though she would later reveal on social media that she felt 'manhandled' during the encounter , the pair have remained close ever since and were again pictured together in attendance for Anthony Joshua's KO win against Robert Helenius earlier this month. The OnlyFans star has also struck up a close friendship with UFC legend Conor McGregor But Bridges shocked fans after claiming she felt the Irishman had 'manhandled' her at ringside Despite the comments the pair were once again pictured together at ringside earlier this month Despite a mixed response online, with some fans referring to her as a 'clout chaser' , Bridges affirmed that she enjoyed her time with McGregor. 'Had a great night ringside at the Anthony Joshua fight with my pal Conor McGregor enjoying his smooth Irish Forged Stout,' she said after the fight. 'It's always a good time with Conor - he's always the life of the party and very humble. 'As we know, I like to break the internet, so I thought why not rock a sexy outfit, as I do, and promote Conor's new stout while I'm at it.' Hand surgery earlier this year has curtailed the Aussie's activity inside the ring just as her stardom grows to newfound heights, but if anything is certain it is that anything Ebanie Bridges does has the power to capture the public's attention.
