The 53-year-old’s departure comes just over a week after he publicly labelled his players as “selfish” after they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 against Southampton. The result capped a “miserable” March for Spurs and Conte, said Sky Sports . They were “dumped out” of both the FA Cup and the Champions League to leave them “without a trophy for another season stretching back to 2008”. Over the years Conte has given some “extraordinary” press conferences, said Jason Burt in The Daily Telegraph . But none like the ten-minute rant after that draw on 18 March. He “came out swinging at everyone”, including club chairman Daniel Levy. It was a “declaration of war” for the Italian, who was out of contract at the end of the season. With Spurs sitting fourth in the Premier League table, but out of all cup competitions, the club confirmed the Italian’s exit and also announced that Cristian Stellini will take over as acting head coach for the remainder of the campaign. Stellini will be assisted by Ryan Mason. “We have ten Premier League games remaining and we have a fight on our hands for a Champions League place,” said Levy. “We all need to pull together. Everyone has to step up to ensure the highest possible finish for our club and amazing, loyal supporters.” Exit was a ‘mere formality’ Relations between Conte and the club “deteriorated at all levels”, said James Olley on ESPN . In the “remarkable” post-match news conference, Conte launched a “stinging attack” on the players and the club’s owners, ENIC. “Tottenham’s story is this: 20 years there is this owner and they never won something. Why?” Conte said. “The fault is only for the club, or for every manager that stays here? I have seen the managers that Tottenham had on the bench. You risk to disrupt the figure of the manager and to protect the other situation in every moment.” Skip advert Conte’s exit was a “mere formality” from the moment he concluded his “incendiary unmasking of his squad’s frailties and the culture of failure at the club”, said Phil McNulty on BBC Sport . It put Levy “right in the frontline” for criticism from fans – and that “invariably only ends one way”. Who will take over at Tottenham? While it was clear that Conte had recognised his time at Spurs was more or less done, that doesn’t mean there’s no truth to what he said – he simply told Spurs “a few home truths”, said Martin Samuel in The Times . In recent years, an extraordinary “roll call of managers” has passed through Tottenham – their achievements alone “would command several pages” – but not one has won a “sausage” while at Spurs. That has to say something about the club’s culture and executive management: it “cannot be that all the managers are a poor fit”. In the wake of Conte’s dismissal, and with the club “still battling” for top four, Levy is “reportedly keen to grasp the nettle” and hire a “permanent fix right away”, said Mark White on FourFourTwo . Julian Nagelsmann, who was sacked by Bayern Munich just a few days ago, is “expected for talks shortly”. Nagelsmann, 35, previously managed Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga and is the bookies’ favourite to replace Conte, according to Oddschecker . Other names being linked include former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Oliver Glasner, Celtic’s Ange Postecoglou, ex-Spain boss Luis Enrique and former Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane.

The Atlas Lions became the first Arab team to defeat the five-times world champions, with goals from Sofiane Boufal and substitute Abdelhamid Sabiri earning Morocco a 2-1 victory. “It feels like I’m dreaming,” Regragui told reporters. “We wrote history. We beat Brazil, who are number one in the FIFA rankings and the country of football.” The match, Morocco’s first since their stunning run to last year’s World Cup semi-finals, was played out in a festive atmosphere at a sold-out Ibn Batouta stadium in front of more than 65,000 fans. “To make the celebration beautiful, we had to win this match and that’s what we did,” Morocco centre back Romain Saiss said. “We were at the level even though it was complicated. The mental state of the team made the difference and made people happy again and that’s what is important.” Boufal opened the scoring in the 29th minute before Casemiro equalised for Brazil after an error by goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, but substitute Sabiri scored Morocco’s winner with a powerful shot 11 minutes from time. The result was further proof of the strides Morocco have made under Regragui. They became the first Arab team to reach the World Cup quarter-finals last year and the first African team to make the semi-finals, beating Belgium, Spain and Portugal on the way. “All the players fought,” Regragui added. “We weren’t good in the second half, but I liked our fighting spirit. “The defence didn’t back down and we tried to make our fans happy.” They will head into their next match against Peru in Madrid on Tuesday full of confidence. “With this high morale, we’ll try to beat Peru as well, despite the difficulty and lack of time in the month of Ramadan,” Regragui said.","pubDate":"2023-03-27 11:55:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"cyprus_mail","category":["sports"],"country":["cyprus"],"language":"english"},{"title":"What channel is Scotland vs Spain?

Spain visit Hampden and while they aren’t the same side that dominated Europe and the world with their tiki-taka style. They are still clear favourites to win Group A and the team to beat. New manager Luis De La Fuente got off to a winning start against Norway in Malaga on Saturday night. It wasn't quite as comfortable as the 3-0 scoreline suggested after Joselu came off the bench to bag a brace on his debut, and Steve Clarke will take heart from the problems the Norwegians caused the hosts. Scotland took top spot by virtue of alphabetical order after one game played. A positive result in Glasgow on Tuesday would really boost our chances of automatic qualification for Germany next year, although it will be easier said than done against one of the top teams on the continent.

However, whilst the introduction of technology has unquestionably modernised the Scottish game, it has not been without its critics and has definitely not eliminated contentious calls. In fact, some of VAR 's biggest snipers would argue its introduction has seen controversial decisions increase in the Premiership – something decision makers would counter argue. Even VAR's most ardent supporter wouldn't have claimed it would be flawless and result in 100 percent of decisions being called correctly, and many of the early issues will be put down to teething problems - as well as the contentious debates over the handball rule. But, with all things considered, how do you think VAR has performed so far? Are Premiership clubs getting bang for their buck? Or should all aspects of video refereeing be completely scrapped from our top-flight? It's your opportunity to let us know how you feel! If the poll doesn't load correctly for you, click HERE .

The 53-year-old’s departure comes just over a week after he publicly labelled his players as “selfish” after they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 against Southampton. The result capped a “miserable” March for Spurs and Conte, said Sky Sports . They were “dumped out” of both the FA Cup and the Champions League to leave them “without a trophy for another season stretching back to 2008”. Over the years Conte has given some “extraordinary” press conferences, said Jason Burt in The Daily Telegraph . But none like the ten-minute rant after that draw on 18 March. He “came out swinging at everyone”, including club chairman Daniel Levy. It was a “declaration of war” for the Italian, who was out of contract at the end of the season. With Spurs sitting fourth in the Premier League table, but out of all cup competitions, the club confirmed the Italian’s exit and also announced that Cristian Stellini will take over as acting head coach for the remainder of the campaign. Stellini will be assisted by Ryan Mason. “We have ten Premier League games remaining and we have a fight on our hands for a Champions League place,” said Levy. “We all need to pull together. Everyone has to step up to ensure the highest possible finish for our club and amazing, loyal supporters.” Exit was a ‘mere formality’ Relations between Conte and the club “deteriorated at all levels”, said James Olley on ESPN . In the “remarkable” post-match news conference, Conte launched a “stinging attack” on the players and the club’s owners, ENIC. “Tottenham’s story is this: 20 years there is this owner and they never won something. Why?” Conte said. “The fault is only for the club, or for every manager that stays here? I have seen the managers that Tottenham had on the bench. You risk to disrupt the figure of the manager and to protect the other situation in every moment.” Skip advert Conte’s exit was a “mere formality” from the moment he concluded his “incendiary unmasking of his squad’s frailties and the culture of failure at the club”, said Phil McNulty on BBC Sport . It put Levy “right in the frontline” for criticism from fans – and that “invariably only ends one way”. Who will take over at Tottenham? While it was clear that Conte had recognised his time at Spurs was more or less done, that doesn’t mean there’s no truth to what he said – he simply told Spurs “a few home truths”, said Martin Samuel in The Times . In recent years, an extraordinary “roll call of managers” has passed through Tottenham – their achievements alone “would command several pages” – but not one has won a “sausage” while at Spurs. That has to say something about the club’s culture and executive management: it “cannot be that all the managers are a poor fit”. In the wake of Conte’s dismissal, and with the club “still battling” for top four, Levy is “reportedly keen to grasp the nettle” and hire a “permanent fix right away”, said Mark White on FourFourTwo . Julian Nagelsmann, who was sacked by Bayern Munich just a few days ago, is “expected for talks shortly”. Nagelsmann, 35, previously managed Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga and is the bookies’ favourite to replace Conte, according to Oddschecker . Other names being linked include former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Oliver Glasner, Celtic’s Ange Postecoglou, ex-Spain boss Luis Enrique and former Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane.

The Atlas Lions became the first Arab team to defeat the five-times world champions, with goals from Sofiane Boufal and substitute Abdelhamid Sabiri earning Morocco a 2-1 victory. “It feels like I’m dreaming,” Regragui told reporters. “We wrote history. We beat Brazil, who are number one in the FIFA rankings and the country of football.” The match, Morocco’s first since their stunning run to last year’s World Cup semi-finals, was played out in a festive atmosphere at a sold-out Ibn Batouta stadium in front of more than 65,000 fans. “To make the celebration beautiful, we had to win this match and that’s what we did,” Morocco centre back Romain Saiss said. “We were at the level even though it was complicated. The mental state of the team made the difference and made people happy again and that’s what is important.” Boufal opened the scoring in the 29th minute before Casemiro equalised for Brazil after an error by goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, but substitute Sabiri scored Morocco’s winner with a powerful shot 11 minutes from time. The result was further proof of the strides Morocco have made under Regragui. They became the first Arab team to reach the World Cup quarter-finals last year and the first African team to make the semi-finals, beating Belgium, Spain and Portugal on the way. “All the players fought,” Regragui added. “We weren’t good in the second half, but I liked our fighting spirit. “The defence didn’t back down and we tried to make our fans happy.” They will head into their next match against Peru in Madrid on Tuesday full of confidence. “With this high morale, we’ll try to beat Peru as well, despite the difficulty and lack of time in the month of Ramadan,” Regragui said.","pubDate":"2023-03-27 11:55:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"cyprus_mail","category":["sports"],"country":["cyprus"],"language":"english"},{"title":"What channel is Scotland vs Spain?

Spain visit Hampden and while they aren’t the same side that dominated Europe and the world with their tiki-taka style. They are still clear favourites to win Group A and the team to beat. New manager Luis De La Fuente got off to a winning start against Norway in Malaga on Saturday night. It wasn't quite as comfortable as the 3-0 scoreline suggested after Joselu came off the bench to bag a brace on his debut, and Steve Clarke will take heart from the problems the Norwegians caused the hosts. Scotland took top spot by virtue of alphabetical order after one game played. A positive result in Glasgow on Tuesday would really boost our chances of automatic qualification for Germany next year, although it will be easier said than done against one of the top teams on the continent.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice When VAR was brought in almost six months ago, it was thought that it would help referees get more decisions correct and remove any controversy. However, whilst the introduction of technology has unquestionably modernised the Scottish game, it has not been without its critics and has definitely not eliminated contentious calls. In fact, some of VAR 's biggest snipers would argue its introduction has seen controversial decisions increase in the Premiership – something decision makers would counter argue. Even VAR's most ardent supporter wouldn't have claimed it would be flawless and result in 100 percent of decisions being called correctly, and many of the early issues will be put down to teething problems - as well as the contentious debates over the handball rule. But, with all things considered, how do you think VAR has performed so far? Are Premiership clubs getting bang for their buck? Or should all aspects of video refereeing be completely scrapped from our top-flight? It's your opportunity to let us know how you feel! If the poll doesn't load correctly for you, click HERE .

The 53-year-old’s departure comes just over a week after he publicly labelled his players as “selfish” after they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 against Southampton. The result capped a “miserable” March for Spurs and Conte, said Sky Sports . They were “dumped out” of both the FA Cup and the Champions League to leave them “without a trophy for another season stretching back to 2008”. Over the years Conte has given some “extraordinary” press conferences, said Jason Burt in The Daily Telegraph . But none like the ten-minute rant after that draw on 18 March. He “came out swinging at everyone”, including club chairman Daniel Levy. It was a “declaration of war” for the Italian, who was out of contract at the end of the season. With Spurs sitting fourth in the Premier League table, but out of all cup competitions, the club confirmed the Italian’s exit and also announced that Cristian Stellini will take over as acting head coach for the remainder of the campaign. Stellini will be assisted by Ryan Mason. “We have ten Premier League games remaining and we have a fight on our hands for a Champions League place,” said Levy. “We all need to pull together. Everyone has to step up to ensure the highest possible finish for our club and amazing, loyal supporters.” Exit was a ‘mere formality’ Relations between Conte and the club “deteriorated at all levels”, said James Olley on ESPN . In the “remarkable” post-match news conference, Conte launched a “stinging attack” on the players and the club’s owners, ENIC. “Tottenham’s story is this: 20 years there is this owner and they never won something. Why?” Conte said. “The fault is only for the club, or for every manager that stays here? I have seen the managers that Tottenham had on the bench. You risk to disrupt the figure of the manager and to protect the other situation in every moment.” Skip advert Conte’s exit was a “mere formality” from the moment he concluded his “incendiary unmasking of his squad’s frailties and the culture of failure at the club”, said Phil McNulty on BBC Sport . It put Levy “right in the frontline” for criticism from fans – and that “invariably only ends one way”. Who will take over at Tottenham? While it was clear that Conte had recognised his time at Spurs was more or less done, that doesn’t mean there’s no truth to what he said – he simply told Spurs “a few home truths”, said Martin Samuel in The Times . In recent years, an extraordinary “roll call of managers” has passed through Tottenham – their achievements alone “would command several pages” – but not one has won a “sausage” while at Spurs. That has to say something about the club’s culture and executive management: it “cannot be that all the managers are a poor fit”. In the wake of Conte’s dismissal, and with the club “still battling” for top four, Levy is “reportedly keen to grasp the nettle” and hire a “permanent fix right away”, said Mark White on FourFourTwo . Julian Nagelsmann, who was sacked by Bayern Munich just a few days ago, is “expected for talks shortly”. Nagelsmann, 35, previously managed Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga and is the bookies’ favourite to replace Conte, according to Oddschecker . Other names being linked include former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, Eintracht Frankfurt’s Oliver Glasner, Celtic’s Ange Postecoglou, ex-Spain boss Luis Enrique and former Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane.

The Atlas Lions became the first Arab team to defeat the five-times world champions, with goals from Sofiane Boufal and substitute Abdelhamid Sabiri earning Morocco a 2-1 victory. “It feels like I’m dreaming,” Regragui told reporters. “We wrote history. We beat Brazil, who are number one in the FIFA rankings and the country of football.” The match, Morocco’s first since their stunning run to last year’s World Cup semi-finals, was played out in a festive atmosphere at a sold-out Ibn Batouta stadium in front of more than 65,000 fans. “To make the celebration beautiful, we had to win this match and that’s what we did,” Morocco centre back Romain Saiss said. “We were at the level even though it was complicated. The mental state of the team made the difference and made people happy again and that’s what is important.” Boufal opened the scoring in the 29th minute before Casemiro equalised for Brazil after an error by goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, but substitute Sabiri scored Morocco’s winner with a powerful shot 11 minutes from time. The result was further proof of the strides Morocco have made under Regragui. They became the first Arab team to reach the World Cup quarter-finals last year and the first African team to make the semi-finals, beating Belgium, Spain and Portugal on the way. “All the players fought,” Regragui added. “We weren’t good in the second half, but I liked our fighting spirit. “The defence didn’t back down and we tried to make our fans happy.” They will head into their next match against Peru in Madrid on Tuesday full of confidence. “With this high morale, we’ll try to beat Peru as well, despite the difficulty and lack of time in the month of Ramadan,” Regragui said.","pubDate":"2023-03-27 11:55:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"cyprus_mail","category":["sports"],"country":["cyprus"],"language":"english"},{"title":"What channel is Scotland vs Spain?

Spain visit Hampden and while they aren’t the same side that dominated Europe and the world with their tiki-taka style. They are still clear favourites to win Group A and the team to beat. New manager Luis De La Fuente got off to a winning start against Norway in Malaga on Saturday night. It wasn't quite as comfortable as the 3-0 scoreline suggested after Joselu came off the bench to bag a brace on his debut, and Steve Clarke will take heart from the problems the Norwegians caused the hosts. Scotland took top spot by virtue of alphabetical order after one game played. A positive result in Glasgow on Tuesday would really boost our chances of automatic qualification for Germany next year, although it will be easier said than done against one of the top teams on the continent.

We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice When VAR was brought in almost six months ago, it was thought that it would help referees get more decisions correct and remove any controversy. However, whilst the introduction of technology has unquestionably modernised the Scottish game, it has not been without its critics and has definitely not eliminated contentious calls. In fact, some of VAR 's biggest snipers would argue its introduction has seen controversial decisions increase in the Premiership – something decision makers would counter argue. Even VAR's most ardent supporter wouldn't have claimed it would be flawless and result in 100 percent of decisions being called correctly, and many of the early issues will be put down to teething problems - as well as the contentious debates over the handball rule. But, with all things considered, how do you think VAR has performed so far? Are Premiership clubs getting bang for their buck? Or should all aspects of video refereeing be completely scrapped from our top-flight? It's your opportunity to let us know how you feel! If the poll doesn't load correctly for you, click HERE .
