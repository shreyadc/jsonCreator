Maesydre, home of Ardal North East League club Welshpool Town, is among the stops for New York based Beestera Soccer Training which also includes the Etihad Stadium, home of English Premier League champions Manchester City. On Saturday, December 2nd from 10am-2pm the recruitment camp will arrive in Welshpool with the prize of a summer spent coaching in New York. The tour is being led by Newtown’s Kurtis Smith, a former Newtown Football Club academy player who also represented Abermule, Kerry and Churchstoke in the Mid Wales League and Montgomeryshire League. Kurtis began his coaching journey while a student at Coleg Powys from 2010 to 2012 with his first coaching roles at Newtown Football Club’s academy before studying Football and Sports Coaching and Performance at the University of South Wales from 2012 to 2015. Kurtis moved to the USA and continued to coach and is currently Director of Club Development at Beestera Soccer Training, a coaching company based in Albany, New York, specialising in team coaching, private training and camps which is affiliated with NIKE Sports Camps.

Welshpool has been included as one of our stops on this journey. “This event is being organized in collaboration with Newtown College and is open to any individuals aged 18 or older by June 2024, regardless of their background or affiliation.\" Interested candidates can apply for this event by visiting the following registration/application link: https://www.beesterasoccertraining.com/internationalcoaches.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 09:33:23","image_url":"https://www.countytimes.co.uk/resources/images/17419407/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"countytimes","source_priority":1169593,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"28e27a2caa5290338d5a0219488557e2","title":"Sport’s most-wanted technology developments revealed including underwater racing cars and cameras in footballs","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/11488639/sport-football-technology-ai-vr/","keywords":["Sport","Sport Evergreen"],"creator":["Kealan Hughes"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"THE tech developments children want to see in sport include free-flying drones, performance-enhancing exoskeleton suits - and AI referees. A poll of 1,000 kids aged 10 to 16 found cameras in footballs and underwater racing cars also ranked highly. 1 Kids are keen to see virtual reality added to sport While 85 per cent watch some form of sport, 25 per cent would be likely to view more if robots and computers were involved. Others are hoping the future will include devices that can fix broken bones and injuries in a flash, as well as boxing gloves that measure just how hard a punch is thrown. A spokesperson for Virgin Media O2 which is supporting BBC Children in Need with 5G connectivity across their national Hado eSport tour, said: \"Technological advances are unlocking new possibilities every day. “From VAR to Hawkeye, smart balls to wearable sensors, technology has already transformed sport in ways unimaginable a few decades back. \"While we’re someway from many of the out-there ideas young people dreamt up, cutting-edge 5G connectivity will help unlock new innovation in future. “It is clear from the research that children want to see more technology used and that it would have a positive impact on how much they watch and play their favourite sports.” Despite widespread controversy over the implementation of VAR and video technology in the modern game, football was the most popular sport to watch, with 64 per cent of the youngsters tuning in. Tennis (26 per cent) and rugby (24 per cent) claimed silver and bronze when it comes to most popular sports, while 15 per cent said they hadn’t watched any sport at all, either in person or on TV in the past year.

Almost eight in 10 (78 per cent) said they would be excited if more technology was added to their favourite game. The idea of robot referees was popular as were cameras in smart footballs (both 41 per cent), while 17 per cent were taken with exoskeleton suits to protect athletes and 12 per cent fancied supplying basketball players with trampolines. Teleportation around the golf course to make the game quicker was a hit with an impatient 13 per cent and 14 per cent thought motorised swimsuits were a genius idea. The study, carried out via OnePoll.com, revealed that more than a third (35 per cent) of children said they watched sport a few times a week, seven per cent did so every day and 19 per cent once a week. Outside of school 45 per cent played football, 27 per cent went swimming, 15 per cent took part in athletics and nine per cent played rugby. More than a quarter (27 per cent) played some kind of sport in their free time on at least two days a week. Asked how they felt about robots competing alongside human athletes, 24 per cent said they were curious, 21 per cent were confused and 17 per cent were excited. Despite four per cent saying the idea made them jealous, 11 per cent were happy at the thought. More than one in three (35 per cent) had played eSports or multiplayer video games, welcoming the potential to compete in virtual sports. FIFA was the favourite for 57 per cent of young people, followed by Fortnite (51 per cent) and Call of Duty (43 per cent). Virgin Media O2’s spokesperson added: \"Increased access to technology is rapidly changing the hobbies and interests of the younger generation, with esports becoming a more popular way for them to spend their time. \"Incorporating technology with traditional sports will keep young people engaged, enabling them to get the physical benefits in a way that they find most entertaining.” Read more on the Scottish Sun FROCKSTAR I'm size 22 & found the dream Xmas dress for £8, I want to wolf whistle at myself LOVE INN Little-known Scots hotel named the best place for romantic escape in Britain Top 12 most wanted tech developments in sports - voted by kids: Smart balls with built-in sensor Cameras in footballs Virtual reality headsets for fans so they can see sport through eyes of their favourite player Eco-friendly sports stadiums Injury prevention technology so players don’t get injured Robot referees Advanced safety technology to let coaches know if players are injured Virtual fan interactions which let viewers speak to players Underwater racing cars Exoskeleton suits to make players stronger Artificial intelligence (AI) sports commentary Swimsuits which have motors on them Trampolines in basketball Teleportation on golf courses to make the game quicker Artificial intelligence (AI) coaches","pubDate":"2023-11-08 09:08:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"thescottishsun","source_priority":31532,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"365e4e9a2afd30035286c8e0958e6eb5","title":"Chelsea hooligan calls on rival firms to team up vs 'terrorists' and 'dog sl*gs' protests","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-hooligan-calls-rival-firms-31388119","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Infamous Chelsea hooligan Jason Marriner has called on football fans to unite as police fear violence during pro-Palestine protests over Remembrance weekend","content":"Infamous hooligan Jason Marriner has called on football fans to unite and protect the cenotaph ahead of the Israel-Palestine protests that clash with Remembrance Day. Met Police are on 'high alert' as they fear more than a thousand football hooligans and far-Right thugs will descent on London during the pro-Palestine protests. A march calling for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza is planned for Remembered Day on Saturday. However, there is no march planned for Remembrance Sunday - but police are fearful heightened tensions could lead to violence between the two sides. One man who won't be in London is Marriner, who instead will be watching from afar. Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C £22 a month \"Save your energy, save it for next weekend, obviously every one is going to be in London,\" the notorious former Chelsea Headhunters man said, speaking from Thailand. \"I'd like to say I wish I could be there, do you know what, I do with I could be there, because I've had enough of all this b******: It's outrageous. \"It's about time that we stood together and we're united, you know what I mean. \"Everyone knows the code, next weekend, make it our stand against these terrorists, absolute dog slags - that's the bottom line and there ain't no in between. \"This is outrageous, if they want to disrupted that, I'm sorry, its got to go to a different level. Big respect to everyone that's going to go and show their respect, and, you know what, do what you've got to do.\" Marriner shot to notoriety when he was unveiled as Headhunters, a football firm, Top Boy in a documentary by Donal MacIntyre. MacIntyre was able to break into Marriner's inner circle, where he listened to sickening stories about Auschwitz and witnessed racism first-hand - with owner of a tyre-fitting firm, Marriner, who has now created a new life for himself in Thailand and opened his own ex-pat shop, throwing up Nazi salutes. Towards the end of the documentary, Marriner, and fellow Chelsea Headhunter Andy Frain, were preparing to ambush a peaceful march commemorating Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest moments during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, when 14 Catholics were shot dead. MacIntyre witnessed Marriner side-by-side with the leader of the neo-Nazi terrorist organisation Combat 18, but police were able to stop the yobs before any violence could break-out. Shortly after the documentary aired, Marriner was behind bars, and Judge Charles Byers said: \"It's clear to me that you relish violence and will stop at nothing to go anywhere in pursuit of it, showing little, if any, regard for other people or for the law.\" Marriner isn't the only football hooligan to call for action over the weekend, and one group, Football Lads Against Extremism, claims veterans have reached out and asked for their support \"due to the threat from the far left and pro-Palestine supporters to disrupt the Remembrance Day parade.\" They added: \"All football lads up and down the country to join us in standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans that fought for our freedom.\" This weekend, and will host games on Saturday, while and Chelsea are playing at home on Sunday.

But two red cards either side of Cole Palmer's penalty left them at the mercy of their rivals. They made it hard work for themselves, but Chelsea ultimately prevailed thanks to a Nicolas Jackson hat-trick. And rubbing salt in Maddison's wounds, Terry hit back with three laughing emojis and: \"Don't worry mate you will get used to it.\" The extent of Maddison's injury is not yet known. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou said post-match: \"He got a knock on the ankle, we were down one man already. It made sense to make a couple of changes at that point.\" Terry, meanwhile, recently spoke about his desire to one day manage Chelsea - which he fears is no longer a reality.

Die neuesten Meldungen aus der Welt des Sports. Timo Meier reiht sich in der Nacht auf Mittwoch in der NHL unter die Torschützen. Er kann die 3:6-Auswärtsniederlage der New Jersey Devils gegen die Colorado Avalanche aber nicht verhindern. Meier spielte seine Kaltblütigkeit im Powerplay aus, als er in der 32. Minute mit einem präzisen Handgelenkschuss aus kurzer Distanz zum 2:2-Ausgleich für New Jersey traf. Für den Appenzeller Stürmer war es im zwölften Saisonspiel das dritte Tor. Die Devils, die erneut ohne ihren Captain Nico Hischier und den ebenfalls verletzt ausfallenden Topskorer Jack Hughes antraten und im Schlussdrittel drei Gegentore hinnehmen mussten, stehen aktuell bei 7 Siegen und 5 Niederlagen. Nino Niederreiter mit den Winnipeg Jets (5:2 bei den St. Louis Blues) und Janis Moser mit den Arizona Coyotes (4:3 n.P. gegen die Seattle Kraken) erlebten mit ihren Teams einen erfolgreichen Abend. Für Roman Josi und die Nashville Predators setzte es beim 2:4 in Calgary hingegen eine Niederlage ab - die dritte im vierten aufeinanderfolgenden Auswärtsspiel. Die Mannschaft mit dem Berner Captain schliesst in der Nacht auf Freitag ihren zehntägigen «Road-Trip» nach Kanada mit dem Gastspiel in Winnipeg ab. Für Josi und Niederreiter ist es ein Duell unter Freunden und ehemaligen Teamkollegen. Titelverteidiger Manchester City hat vorzeitig das Achtelfinale der Champions League erreicht. Der englische Fussball-Meister setzte sich am Dienstagabend mit 3:0 (2:0) gegen die Young Boys Bern durch und ist damit nicht mehr von einem der ersten beiden Plätze der Gruppe G zu verdrängen. Erling Haaland (23./Foulelfmeter/52.) und Phil Foden (45.+1) erzielten gegen schwache Schweizer die Tore. Roter Stern Belgrad und die Young Boys bewegen sich in der Gruppe G weiter im Gleichschritt. Auch Serbiens Meister bezog mit einem 1:2 zuhause gegen RB Leipzig die dritte Niederlage. Zwischen Roter Stern und den Young Boys geht es in den letzten beiden Runden damit um den 3. Platz und das europäische Überwintern in der Europa League. Das zweite Direktduell steigt am 28. November in Bern. Die Begegnung in Belgrad war nach dem spätem Ausgleich des Heimteams 2:2 ausgegangen. In der Gruppe F mit Borussia Dortmund feierte AC Mailand gegen Paris St. Germain mit dem 2:1 (1:1) einen wichtigen «Dreier» und tat dem BVB einen Gefallen, Olivier Giroud (50.) war nach seinem Siegtor der gefeierte Held. Vor der Partie hatte es zwischen beiden Fan-Lagern massive Ausschreitungen gegeben, ein Paris-Anhänger war sogar niedergestochen worden. Viel Spannung an den letzten beiden Spieltagen verspricht auch die Gruppe E. Atletico Madrid hatte beim 6:0 (2:0) gegen Celtic Glasgow nach einer frühen Rote Karte für Daizen Maeda (23.) leichtes Spiel und übernahm die Tabellenführung mit acht Punkten. Dahinter lauert mit einem Punkt weniger Lazio Rom, das 1:0 (1:0) gegen Feyenoord Rotterdam (6 Punkte) gewann. Borussia Dortmund hat seine Achtelfinalchance in der Champions League durch den nächsten wichtigen Sieg erheblich verbessert. Der BVB gewann auch das Rückspiel gegen den englischen Vertreter Newcastle United am Dienstagabend mit 2:0 (1:0) und steht damit bei sieben Punkten. Niclas Füllkrug (26.) traf für die Borussia zur Führung, es war sein erstes Tor in der Königsklasse überhaupt. Julian Brandt (79.) sorgte für die Entscheidung. Viertes Spiel, erste Pleite: Der FC Barcelona hat in der Champions League völlig überraschend gegen Schachtar Donezk verloren. In Hamburg musste Barca ein verdientes 0:1 (0:1) einstecken und vergab damit die Chance, sich als erstes Team für das Achtelfinale zu qualifizieren. Stattdessen gewann Donezk erstmals seit drei Jahren ein «Heimspiel» in der Königsklasse. Angreifer Danylo Sikan (40.) traf vor 49.147 Zuschauern per Kopf für die Ukrainer, die nun sechs Punkte auf dem Konto haben und sich Hoffnungen auf die K.o.-Phase machen dürfen. Barca blieb mit neun Zählern zunächst Tabellenführer, der FC Porto spielte erst am Abend gegen Royal Antwerpen. Letztmals hatte Donezk am 1. Dezember 2020 «zu Hause» gewonnen - damals mit 2:0 gegen Real Madrid in Kiew. Nati-Trainer Murat Yakin trauert um seine Mutter. Wie der Schweizerische Fussballverband mitteilt, ist Emine Yakin am Montagabend im Spital in Basel im Kreise ihrer Familie verstorben. Sie wurde 89 Jahre alt. «Unsere Gedanken sind bei Murat und seiner Familie», so der SFV. Weltmeister Nils Stump muss die Saison vorzeitig beenden. Der Zürcher muss sich wegen einer komplexen Bänderverletzung an der linken Schulter operieren lassen. Das Missgeschick passierte vor wenigen Tagen an den Europameisterschaften in Montpellier bei Stumps überraschender Erstrunden-Niederlage gegen den Griechen Michail Tsoutlasvili. Die Länge der Rekonvaleszenz ist noch nicht bekannt. Bei normalem Heilungsverlauf sollte der Pechvogel im kommenden Frühling wieder einsatzbereit sein. Mit seinem Titelgewinn in der Klasse bis 73 kg im Mai in Frankreich hatte Stump ein Kapitel Schweizer Sportgeschichte geschrieben. Er wurde als erster Judoka unseres Landes Weltmeister. Der französische Fussball-Nationalspieler Eduardo Camavinga hat seinen bis 2027 laufenden Vertrag beim spanischen Rekordmeister Real Madrid vorzeitig um zwei Jahre bis 2029 verlängert. Das gaben die Königlichen am Dienstag bekannt. Der 20 Jahre alte zentrale Mittelfeldspieler, der von Trainer Carlo Ancelotti vielfach auch als Linksverteidiger eingesetzt wird, wechselte 2021 von seinem Jugendverein Stade Rennes in die spanische Hauptstadt. Seitdem absolvierte Camavinga 114 Spiele für Real, erzielte zwei Tore und legte fünf weitere auf. 2022 feierte er mit den Königlichen den Gewinn der spanischen Meisterschaft und der Champions League. Torhüter Joren van Pottelberghe wechselt innerhalb der National League auf die kommende Saison hin den Arbeitgeber. Der derzeit beim EHC Biel tätige Schweizer Internationale mit belgischen Wurzeln spielt in den kommenden drei Jahren für den HC Lugano. Der 26-jährige Van Pottelberghe, der beim EV Zug die Nachwuchsstufen durchlaufen und danach seine sportliche Entwicklung in Schweden bei Linköping vorangetrieben hat, hatte sich nach seiner Rückkehr in die Schweiz dem HC Davos angeschlossen. Russische Athleten werden bis auf Weiteres nicht an Wettbewerben des Weltskiverbandes Fis teilnehmen. Das sagte Michal Lamplot, Race-Direktor Langlauf beim Weltverband, am Dienstag beim Forum Nordicum der nordischen Skisportjournalisten im österreichischen Bad Mitterndorf. Natürlich wolle man immer die besten Athleten am Start haben. «Die Zeit ist aber noch nicht reif dafür», sagte Lamplot mit Blick auf den weiter andauernden Angriffskrieg Russlands in der Ukraine. Das Einzelfinale gewann Iga Swiatek klar 6:1, 6:0 gegen Jessica Pegula aus den USA. Die 22 Jahre alte Polin holte damit erstmals den Titel bei den WTA Finals und eroberte auch Position eins in der Weltrangliste zurück. Swiatek hat ihre letzten elf Tennis-Matches in diesem Jahr gewonnen. Tottenham Hotspur hat in der englischen Fussball-Meisterschaft durch seine erste Saisonniederlage die Rückeroberung der Tabellenspitze verpasst. In doppelter Unterzahl mussten sich die Spurs im Londoner Stadtduell mit dem FC Chelsea trotz einer frühen Führung noch mit 1:4 (1:1) geschlagen geben. Die Spurs liegen damit nun einen Punkt hinter Tabellenführer und Titelverteidiger Manchester City (am Samstag 6:1 gegen den AFC Bournemouth) nur noch auf dem zweiten Platz. Für die Spurs, zuvor die einzig noch unbesiegte Mannschaft der Premier League, begann die Begegnung durch den Führungstreffer von Dejan Kulusevski (6.) nach Plan. Doch der Platzverweis für Cristian Romero (33./grobes Foulspiel) nach einem wegen Abseits aberkannten Treffer von Ex-Bundesligaprofi Heung-Min Son leitete die Wende zugunsten der «Blues» ein. Denn nur zwei Minuten später glich Cole Palmer für die Gäste aus. Nachdem Tottenham zehn Minuten nach dem Seitenwechsel durch die Gelb-Rote Karte für Destiny Udogie (55./wiederholtes Foulspiel) weiter dezimiert worden war, leitete Nicolas Jackson (75.) Chelseas ersten Erfolg nach zuvor zwei Spielen ohne Sieg ein. Mit zwei Spielern weniger auf dem Feld bemühten sich die Hausherren in der Schlussphase vergeblich um den Ausgleich, kamen zu guten Chancen, doch erneut Jackson mit einem Doppelpack (90.+4/90.+8) sorgte für die Entscheidung. Nach zuletzt zwei Erstrunden-Niederlagen in Basel und Paris gewinnt Stan Wawrinka (ATP 53) seinen Auftaktmatch am ATP-250-Turnier von Metz problemlos. Er schlägt den Spanier Bernabe Zapata Mirallas (ATP 81) 6:0, 6:2. Der gut aufgelegte und sehr offensiv eingestellte Wawrinka begeisterte mit einem Blitzstart: Für den Gewinn des ersten Satzes benötigte er nur 18 Minuten und gab dabei lediglich fünf Punkte ab. Auch danach überzeugte der 38-Jährige mit wuchtigen Schlägen und zahlreichen Netzangriffen. Nach 52 Minuten verwertete er seinen zweiten Matchball. Im Achtelfinal trifft Wawrinka, der im letzten Jahr in Metz bis in den Halbfinal vorgestossen war, auf den jungen Franzosen Luca van Assche (ATP 76). Dieser musste gegen den Niederländer Botic van de Zandschulp (ATP 51) fast zwei Stunden länger als der Schweizer um den Sieg kämpfen (3:6, 6:3, 7:6). Der EV Zug hat Mike Künzle vom EHC Biel verpflichtet. Der 29-jährige Stürmer mit der Erfahrung von 24 Länderspielen unterschrieb bei den Zentralschweizern einen Vertrag über zwei Jahre. Künzle debütierte am 12. September 2013 bei den ZSC Lions in der höchsten Liga. Mit den Zürchern gewann er 2014 und 2018 den Meistertitel, ehe vor fünf Jahren zu Biel stiess. Nun entschied er sich für einen weiteren Wechsel. «Mike hat sich zu einem Powerstürmer mit Gardemassen entwickelt und ist im besten Eishockey-Alter», liess sich der Zuger Sportchef Reto Kläy zitieren. Der Thurgauer Golfprofi Joel Girrbach steigt erstmals in die grosse europäische Tour, die DP World Tour auf. Der 30-Jährige erreichte an dem mit 500’000 Euro dotierten Finalturnier der Challenge Tour den 7. Platz und verbesserte sich innerhalb der Challenge Tour auf den 17. Gesamtrang. Jeweils die besten 20 Spieler nach jeder Saison bekommen das Spielrecht für die nachfolgende Saison auf der grossen Tour. Denis Zakaria erzielt sein erste Tor in diesem Kalenderjahr. Der Schweizer Internationale trifft in der 11. Ligue-1-Runde beim 2:0-Heimsieg der AS Monaco gegen Brest zum 1:0. In der 16. Minute lenkte Zakaria einen Eckball des Russen Alexander Golowin mit dem Kopf ins Tor. Nach der Pause gelang dem formstarken Golowin das 2:0. Zakaria hatte seinen letzten Treffer vor etwas mehr als einem Jahr für den FC Chelsea in der Champions League gegen Dinamo Zagreb erzielt. Der Schweizer Nationalstürmer Xherdan Shaqiri trainiert ab Montag mit dem FC Lugano. Dies gegen die Luganesi in einer Medienmitteilung bekannt. Shaqiri's Saison in der amerikanischen Major Soccer League ist zu Ende. Er wird bis zu den entscheidenden EM-Qualispielen mit Lugano trainieren. «Danke FC Lugano. Ich freue mich, mich ab Montag wieder bei den Bianconeri auf die Nati vorzubereiten», wird der 32-Jährige zitiert. Der FC Basel kommt zum ersten Sieg seit Ende Juli in der Super League. Das erstmals in der Liga von Fabio Celestini betreute Team setzt sich daheim gegen Yverdon 2:1 durch. St. Gallen kommt zum ersten Auswärtssieg. Nach 415 Minuten beendete Aussenverteidiger Mohamed Dräger mit dem 1:0 die Durststrecke des FC Basel. Mehr als vier Spiele lang waren die Basler ohne Treffer geblieben. Den ersten Sieg seit Ende Juli bewerkstelligte aber erst Gabriel Sigua mit seinem Tor in der 85. Minute. Yverdon hatte mittel Handspenalty eine gute Viertelstunde vor Schluss ausgeglichen. Der FC St. Gallen verdiente sich den ersten Auswärtssieg in der Super League seit Februar mit vier Toren nach der Pause zum 5:2 bei Lausanne-Ouchy. Zwischen der 48. und 57. Minute trafen die Ostschweizer dreimal und machten aus dem 1:2 ein 4:2. Der Serbe Novak Djokovic gewinnt am Sonntagnachmittag im Final gegen den Bulgaren Grigor Dimitrov mit 6:4, 6:3. Nach 1:38 verwandelte der Serbe seinen ersten Matchball und siegte. Zuvor musste Djokovic ab dem Achtelfinal gegen den Niederländer Tallon Griekspoor, im Viertelfinal gegen den Titelverteidiger Holger Rune aus Dänemark sowie im Halbfinal gegen den Russen Andrej Rublew je drei Sätze spielen. Im Final reichten ihm zwei Sätze für den Sieg. Für Djokovic ist es im Turnier Paris-Bercy der 40. Masters-Sieg. Dank diesem Sieg kann er seine Führung auf der Weltrangliste weiter ausbauen und hat seine Rekordmarke weiter in die Höhe geschraubt. Hinter ihm liegt Rafael Nadal mit 36 Siegen und Roger Federer (28). Marcel Hug fuhr beim New York Marathon als erster durchs Ziel. Für den Thurgauer Rollstuhl-Leichathlet ist es das sechste Mal, als er diesen Marathon gewinnt. Doch nicht nur: Dieses Jahr gelang ihm alle sechs World Marathon Majors (Tokio, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago und New York) zu gewinnen. Das hat vor ihm noch niemand geschafft. Marcel Hug wins the 2023 and becomes the first person to win all six Abbott World Marathon Majors in one year. Neben Hug brillierten auch die Schweizer Frauen. Die Thurgauerin Catherine Debrunner fuhr mit einem Streckenrekord ins Ziel. Für sie ist es der erste New York Marathon. Hinter ihr erreichte Manuela Schär als Zweite das Ziel. Dem FC Luzern gelingt die Wiedergutmachung für die Blamage im Cup. Die Innerschweizer schlagen ihren Lieblingsgegner GC dank Teddy Okou und dem neuen, alten Captain Ardon Jashari mit 2:0. Elf Spiele und über 900 Spielminuten musste Okou auf seinen ersten Treffer in der Super League warten. In der letzten Saison hatte der Stürmer als Torschützenkönig mit seinen 19 Toren noch massgeblichen Anteil am Aufstieg von Lausanne-Ouchy gehabt. In Luzern war er in den ersten Monaten nur zweimal im Cup erfolgreich. Am Sonntagnachmittag gegen GC gelang Okou der kleine persönliche Befreiungsschlag. Von den Grasshoppers kam keine Reaktion. Nach dem 0:2 blieben die Zürcher, die seit 2014 nicht mehr in Luzern gewonnen haben, ohne nennenswerte Torchance. Das erste Team der Schweizer bildeten Anny Wu und Christian Baumann. Nach einem ersten guten Durchlauf lag das Duo auf dem zweiten Zwischenrang. Im zweiten Durchgang stürzten beide von ihren Geräten. So landeten sie am Schluss auf dem achten Rang. Noch schlechter erging es dem zweiten Team mit Florian Langenegger und Stefanie Siegenthaler. Sie beendeten den Swiss Cup auf dem letzten Platz. Brasilien bewirbt sich offiziell um die Austragung der Weltmeisterschaft der Fussballerinnen 2027 und tritt damit in Konkurrenz zu Deutschland. Eine von Präsident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva und Sportminister André Fufuca unterzeichnete Erklärung sei dem brasilianischen Nationalverband (CBF) und dem Weltverband FIFA übergeben worden, teilte die Regierung in der Nacht zum Sonntag mit. Die Erklärung werde von den sieben Regierungsgarantien begleitet, die die FIFA von Kandidatenländern verlange. Das südamerikanische Land wird damit Konkurrent von Deutschland, den Niederlanden und Belgien, die sich gemeinsam um die Ausrichtung des Turniers bewerben. Brasilien hat bisher zweimal (1950 und 2014) die Fussball-WM der Männer ausgerichtet. Auch Südafrika sowie das Duo USA und Mexiko, das gemeinsam mit Kanada bereits 2026 die Männer-WM austrägt, wollen sich bewerben. Eine Entscheidung soll am 17. Mai 2024 auf dem FIFA-Kongress in Bangkok fallen. Die Berner Ultracyclistin, überlegene Overall-Siegerin des Race Across America im Juni dieses Jahres, schafft in den USA erneut Ausserordentliches. Sie gewinnt Gold an den 24-Stunden- Weltmeisterschaften in Borrego Springs in Kalifornien. Die Physiotherapeutin aus Ittigen schaffte 725 km und erreichte auf dem flachen Rundkurs einen Stundenschnitt von 30,4 km/h. Im Gesamtklassement der Frauen und Männer reichte dies zu Platz 6. Noè Ponti überzeugte beim Meeting in Bozen mit einem Schweizer Rekord über 100 m Lagen. Der Tessiner schlug im 25-m-Becken nach 52,49 Sekunden an. Ponti fügte Jérémy Desplanches gleich eine doppelte Niederlage bei. Einerseits bezwang er bei seinem Sieg den Romand, der in diesem Rennen Dritter wurde, andererseits entriss er Desplanches den Schweizer Rekord aus dem Jahr 2017 um 34 Hundertstel. Ponti, der Olympia-Dritte von Tokio über 100 m Delfin, schwamm im Südtirol zudem zum Sieg über 50 m Delfin. Desplanches, der Olympia-Dritte über 200 m Lagen, stand über 50 m Brust als Zweiter auf dem Podest. Gleiches gelang Thierry Bollin über 100 m Rücken. Während Ambri-Piotta in der National League von Sieg zu Sieg fliegt, nimmt die Resultatkrise bei den Rapperswil-Jona Lakers kein Ende. Das sind die Fakten der Vollrunde vom Samstag. Im vierten Derby der Saison hat es für den EHC Biel endlich mit dem ersten Sieg gegen einen Kantonsrivalen geschafft. Kloten verpasste es nach dem überraschenden Derby-Heimsieg am Freitag gegen den ZSC nachzulegen. Beim 1:3 in Lugano schwammen den Gästen primär wegen defensiver Aussetzer früh die Felle davon. Zug gewann mit 3:2 nach Verlängerung auswärts gegen Genf-Servette auch das zweite Saisonduell zwischen den Meistern der letzten drei Jahre. Im Mittelpunkt stand mit Leon Muggli ein Youngster. Dem 17-jährigen Zuger Verteidiger gelang in der 3. Minute sein erstes Tor in der National League; sein drei Jahre älterer Bruder Tim liess sich dabei den zweiten Assist notieren. Der FC Zürich verliert erstmals in dieser Super-League-Saison. Durch das 0:2 daheim gegen das formstarke Servette muss der FCZ seine Tabellenführung an die Young Boys abgeben, die in Winterthur 4:1 gewinnen. Nach zwölf Spielen ohne Niederlage stand der FC Zürich gegen Servette auf verlorenem Posten. Die Genfer trafen durch Liga-Topskorer Chris Bedia (4.) und Steve Rouiller (63.) zum verdienten Sieg, dem fünften in Folge für das Team von René Weiler. Sébastien Buemi ist erneut Langstrecken-Weltmeister. Der 35-jährige Waadtländer und seine Toyota-Teamkollegen Brendon Hartley und Ryo Hirakawa liessen sich beim Saisonfinale in Bahrain nicht mehr von der Spitze der Gesamtwertung verdrängen. Das Trio wiederholte damit seinen Triumph aus dem Vorjahr. Wie es für Weltmeister gehört, beendete Buemi und Co. die Saison mit einem Sieg - dem zweiten im siebten Rennen (bei sechs Podestplätzen). Den 2. Platz im 8-Stunden-Rennen in Sakhir holten sich Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi und Jose Maria Lopez im anderen Toyota, die damit auch die WM-Wertung im 2. Rang abschlossen. Für Buemi ist es nach 2014, 2019 und 2022 bereits der vierte Titelgewinn in der Langstrecken-WM. Das sechste und letzte Sprintrennen dieser Formel-1-Saison wird zur Beute von Max Verstappen. Der Dominator im Red Bull triumphiert in São Paulo vor dem britischen Pole-Mann Lando Norris. Der aus der zweiten Position gestartete Verstappen übernahm im Autodromo José Carlos Pace noch vor der ersten Kurve die Spitze. «Das war wichtig, unmittelbar nach dem Start in Führung zu gehen. Danach war es eine Frage des Reifen-Managements. 24 Runden mit dem gleichen Satz sind sehr lang», sagte der 26-Jährige. Den Sieg brachte der bereits seit vier Wochen als Weltmeister feststehende Niederländer ohne grössere Mühe nach Hause. Tags zuvor im einzigen freien Training hatte sich sein Rennstall auf die Longruns konzentriert. Verstappen gewann zum siebten Mal ein Rennen über die verkürzte Distanz, zum vierten Mal in der laufenden Saison nach Spielberg, Francorchamps und Austin. Nach 24 Runden und gut 100 gefahrenen Kilometern betrug sein Vorsprung auf Norris im McLaren 4,3 Sekunden. Dritter wurde Verstappens Teamkollege Sergio Perez. Der Mexikaner war Ende April in Baku Sieger des ersten Sprintrennens der Saison geworden. Einmal mehr ohne Punkte blieben die Fahrer des Teams Alfa Romeo. Für den Chinesen Zhou Guanyu resultierte von Startplatz 18 der 17. Rang. Der aus Position 14 losgefahrene Finne Valtteri Bottas musste sich mit dem 19. Platz begnügen. Am Sonntag startet beim Grand Prix von Brasilien der 16-fache Saisonsieger Verstappen aus der Pole-Position. Neben dem dreifachen Weltmeister steht der Monegasse Charles Leclerc in der ersten Reihe. Der Start zum drittletzten Rennen des Jahres erfolgt um 18.00 Uhr Schweizer Zeit. Die 21-jährige Bernerin Ditaji Kambundji und der 25-jährige Baselbieter Jason Joseph wurden zu den Schweizer Leichtathleten des Jahres erkoren. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer Abstimmung von über 5000 Personen und einer elfköpfigen Fachjury. Die beiden Hürdenstars wurden am Samstag an der Swiss Athletics Night in Bern geehrt. Die Young Boys finden in der 13. Runde der Super League zurück zum Siegen. Die Berner gewinnen in Winterthur mit 4:1. Lausanne-Sport gelingt derweil die Revanche gegen Lugano für das Cup-Out. Obwohl YB nach der Roten Karte gegen Sandro Lauper über eine halbe Stunde lang in Unterzahl spielen musste, kam der Meister nach zuletzt zwei Remis in der Liga zu einem deutlichen Sieg. Joël Monteiro und Filip Ugrinic vor dem Platzverweis sowie Loris Benito und Meschack Elia danach schossen die Tore. Die zu wenig effizienten Winterthurer waren früh 1:0 in Führung gegangen. Lausanne-Sport gewann dank Toren von Samuel Kalu (71.), Brighton Labeau (80.) und Dominik Schwizer (94.) gegen Lugano daheim mit 3:1. Lugano, vor wenigen Tagen im Cup-Achtelfinal im gleichen Duell noch 4:0-Sieger, hatte kurz nach dem 0:1 durch Jonathan Sabbatini ausgeglichen. Die Tessiner spielten in den letzten 20 Minuten nach dem Platzverweis gegen Martim Marques nur noch zu zehnt. Die Schweizer Handball-Nationalmannschaft verliert beim Vierländerturnier in Tunesien auch das dritte Spiel. Zum Abschluss unterliegt das Team von Michael Suter Österreich mit 27:32. Das Spiel in Hammamet war lange umkämpft. In den Startminuten legten die Schweizer stets vor. Zur Pause lagen allerdings die Österreicher in Führung. In der zweiten Halbzeit konnten die Schweizer das Blatt noch einmal wenden, führten 21:20 und 23:22. Zum Sieg reichte es dennoch nicht. In der Schlussphase agierte Österreich cleverer und konnte das Skore gar noch deutlich gestalten. Während Österreich das Turnier in Tunesien mit zwei Siegen und einem Unentschieden gewann, beendete es die Schweiz nach der dritten Niederlage - am Donnerstag unterlag man dem Gastgeber 22:31 und am Freitag Portugal 26:29 - auf dem letzten Platz. Im Hinblick auf die am 10. Januar beginnende Europameisterschaft in Deutschland bleibt noch viel zu tun. Die Schweiz eröffnet das Turnier gegen den Gastgeber im Düsseldorfer Fussballstadion vor einer Weltrekord-Kulisse. Über 53’000 Tickets sind bereits verkauft. Im Vorfeld bestreitet die Nationalmannschaft noch den Yellow Cup vom 4. bis 6. Januar. Gegner in Winterthur sind Argentinien, Rumänien und Bosnien. Martina Voss-Tecklenburg kehrt wie erwartet nicht mehr als Nationaltrainerin der deutschen Fussballerinnen zurück. Der Vertrag mit der zuletzt pausierenden 55-Jährigen wurde aufgelöst. Die Deutsche, die zwischen 2012 und 2018 das Schweizer Nationalteam der Frauen betreut hatte, liess sich nach der enttäuschend verlaufenen WM in Australien und Neuseeland im August zunächst auf unbestimmte Zeit krankschreiben lassen, danach weilte sie in den Ferien. In einem Gespräch mit Martina Voss-Tecklenburg am Freitag kam der Verband nun zum Schluss, dass das Team einen personellen Neuanfang in der sportlichen Führung benötigt. Die Nachfolge ist noch nicht geklärt, derzeit betreut der 72-jährige Horst Hrubesch die Mannschaft interimistisch. Alexander Zverev und Holger Rune dürfen bei den ATP-Finals aufschlagen. Insbesondere der Deutsche profitierte von den Niederlagen gleich mehrerer Kontrahenten beim Masters-1000-Turnier in Paris. Der Olympiasieger krönt mit den ATP-Finals seine Comeback-Saison nach einer schweren Knöchelverletzung. Nach seinem Achtelfinal-Aus in Paris-Bercy musste er mit Blick auf die ATP-Finals, die am 12. November in Turin starten, zittern. Doch der 26-jährige Deutsche profitierte davon, dass der Pole Hubert Hurkacz und der von Boris Becker trainierte Rune ihre Viertelfinals verloren. Nach den Entwicklungen in Paris wird Rune, der Vorjahressieger beim Turnier an der Seine, trotz der Viertelfinal-Niederlage gegen Novak Djokovic bei den ATP-Finals spielen. Für den Saisonabschluss auf der Tour qualifizieren sich die Top 8 dieser Saison. Das Feld steht nun fest. Vor Zverev und Rune hatten schon Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medwedew, Jannik Sinner, Andrej Rublew und Stefanos Tsitsipas das Ticket gelöst. Seit über zwei Jahren hatte Ambri-Piotta in der heimischen Gottardo Arena nicht mehr gegen Lugano gewonnen und überhaupt nur einmal in den letzten acht Derby-Heimspielen. In einem Offensivspektakel setzten sich die formstarken Leventiner diesmal 5:4 durch und feierten erstmals in dieser Saison vier Siege in Folge. Floran Douay erzielte sein erster Tor im Ambri-Dress, Nando Eggenberger und Tommaso De Luca jeweils ihr zweites. Lugano, das zum dritten Mal in Serie verlor, reichte auch ein Hattrick des Kanadiers Michael Joly nicht. Nach vier Derbys ohne einen Punkt gewann der EHC Kloten mit einem 4:2 wieder einmal ein Derby gegen die ZSC Lions. Sie vermasselten dem grossen Rivalen damit nicht nur den Sprung an die Tabellenspitze, sondern schafften auch den Anschluss an den unteren Playoff-Strich. Es war erst der zweite Sieg in den letzten sieben Partien für das letztjährige Überraschungsteam. Der Kanadier Tyler Morley traf in der 48. Minute zum Siegtor - in Überzahl für das zweitschlechteste Powerplay der Liga. Zudem kehrte der Verteidiger und NHL-Erstrundendraft David Reinbacher nach 16 Spielen Verletzungspause zurück. Zwei Tore hatte Sean Malone in den ersten 18 Saisonspielen für die SCL Tigers erzielt, im kleinen Berner Derby schoss der Amerikaner den weiterhin arg ersatzgeschwächten Playoff-Finalisten Biel fast im Alleingang ab. Malone traf früh zum 1:0 und machte nach dem Ausgleich mit den Toren zum 2:1 und 3:1 seinen ersten Hattrick auf Schweizer Eis perfekt. Während die Langnauer erstmals seit Anfang Oktober zwei Siege in Folge feierten, hat Biel seit dem 23. September (3:0 gegen Davos) nicht mehr drei Punkte geholt und auswärts zum achten Mal in Folge verloren. Das abgeschlagene Schlusslicht Ajoie war für den SC Bern der ideale Gegner, um nach zwei Niederlagen zurück in die Spur zu finden. Allerdings verspielten die Berner einen Punkt auf fahrlässige Art, indem sie die Jurassier in den letzten sieben Minuten vom 3:1 auf 3:3 herankommen liessen. Ärgern muss sich aber auch Ajoie: In der Verlängerung kassierten sie eine Strafe wegen zu vielen Spielern auf dem Eis, was Corban Knight zum Siegtreffer nutzte. Negative Neuigkeiten gab es für den SCB hingegen auf der Goalieposition. Die Nummer 2 Philip Wüthrich fällt mit einer nicht näher definierten Verletzung rund zwei Monate aus. Die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers stecken in einem veritablen Tief. Das 2:4 gegen Genève-Servette war die achte Niederlage in den letzten zehn Spielen. Die St. Galler sind damit auf den 11. Platz abgerutscht. Der Meister aus Genf kehrte nach zwei Heimniederlagen zum Siegen zurück. Nach der deutlichen Auftaktniederlage beim Vierländerturnier in Tunesien gegen den Gastgeber verliert das Schweizer Nationalteam auch die zweite Partie. Gegen Portugal setzt es eine vermeidbare 26:29-Niederlage ab. Vor allem in der Defensive zeigte sich das Team von Nationalcoach Michael Suter im Vergleich zum Spiel gegen Tunesien stark verbessert. Nach einem schlechten Start fingen sich die Schweizer und rissen die Führung dank einem Vier-Tore-Lauf an sich. Mit einem Zwei-Tore-Polster ging es in die Pause. Die Partie blieb auch nach dem Seitenwechsel äusserst umkämpft. Der erneut starke Goalie Nikola Portner, der 14 Paraden zeigte, hielt sein Team lange im Spiel. Trotz 25:23-Führung kurz vor dem Ende mussten sich die Schweizer mit 26:29 geschlagen geben. Bester Werfer war Kreisspieler Lukas Laube mit sechs Toren. Der Kreisläufer des TVB Stuttgart musste rund zehn Minuten vor Schluss mit Rot und der dritten Zweiminutenstrafe frühzeitig vom Feld. Für die Schweiz geht das Vierländerturnier am Samstag (14.30 Uhr) mit dem Spiel gegen Österreich zu Ende. Jeanine Gmelin kehrt in den Profi-Rudersport zurück. Die 33-jährige Zürcherin hatte zu Beginn des Jahres ihren Rücktritt erklärt, nachdem ihr Trainer und Lebenspartner Robin Dowell auf einer Trainingsfahrt unerwartet verstarb. Nun steigt sie wieder ins Boot. «Paris 2024 ist mein Ziel. Diese Entscheidung ist über Monate gereift und war nur möglich dank des Supports und der Wertschätzung, die mir mein Umfeld, meine Partnerinnen und Partner entgegengebracht haben», so Gmelin in einer Mitteilung. Als erstes wolle sie nun wieder ihren Kaderstatus erkämpfen und verbandsinterne Leistungstests bestehen. Gmelin feierte 2017 ihren grössten Erfolg, als sie Weltmeisterin im Skiff wurde. Der ehemalige Velo-Profi Michael Schär bleibt dem Radsport erhalten. Der 37-jährige Luzerner, der nach 18 Jahre als Profi zum Ende dieser Saison zurückgetreten war, wird Sportdirektor. Er wird seine Erfahrung bei der amerikanischen Equipe von Lidl-Trek einbringen. «Der Radsport ist meine Welt und ich möchte ihm verbunden bleiben», sagte Schär bei der Rücktrittsverkündung im Mai. Nun ist klar, wo er seine Laufbahn fortsetzt. Die Uefa wird ab 2024 gemeinsam mit dem französischen Medienkonzern Groupe Amaury den prestigeträchtigen Ballon d’Or organisieren. Das teilte die Europäische Fussball-Union am Freitag mit. Der Ballon d’Or wird seit 1956 jährlich durch die zur Groupe Amaury gehörende Fachzeitschrift «France Football» vergeben. Am vergangenen Montag war Argentiniens Weltmeister Lionel Messi zum achten Mal mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet worden. Die Groupe Amaury werde Eigentümerin der Marke bleiben und das unveränderte Abstimmungsverhalten weiter überwachen. «Die Uefa wird ihre Fussballexpertise einbringen, die weltweiten kommerziellen Rechte vermarkten und die jährliche Galaveranstaltung organisieren», teilte der Verband mit. Zudem werden zwei neue Auszeichnungen mit ins Programm aufgenommen: Gewählt werden ab 2024 auch die Trainerin und der Trainer des Jahres. Der Ballon d’Or ist kein Ersatz für die Weltfussballer-Wahl. Diese Wahl wird weiterhin vom Weltverband Fifa veranstaltet. Von 2010 bis 2015 wurde der Weltfussballer durch eine Kooperation der Fifa und «France Football» mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet. Der kriselnde FC Basel muss vorerst ohne Innenverteidiger Adrian Barisic auskommen. Der 22-jährige Internationale aus Bosnien-Herzegowina musste am Mittwoch beim Sieg im Cup-Achtelfinal in Kriens mit einer Knieverletzung ausgewechselt werden. Medizinische Untersuchen führten zwar keine schwerwiegende Verletzung zu Tage, gemäss dem FCB wird Barisic dem Klub aber «wohl ein paar Wochen» fehlen. In der Super League stand Barisic in den letzten sieben Spielen durchgehend in der Startformation der am Tabellenende klassierten Basler. Belinda Bencic und ihr Freund und Fitnesscoach Martin Hromkovic erwarten ihr erstes Kind. Die 26-jährige Ostschweizerin verkündete die frohe Botschaft auf Instagram: «Wir erwarten unser kleines Wunder», schrieb die Olympiasiegerin. Die Tennisspielerin ist seit 2018 mit dem 41-jährigen Slowaken Hromkovic liiert. Zu den Zukunftsplänen der Weltnummer 14 war zunächst nichts bekannt. Klar ist, dass sie kommende Woche beim in Sevilla steigenden Billie Jean King Cup im Schweizer Aufgebot steht. Ob sie dann auch zum Einsatz kommt, ist noch offen. Die 26-Jährige stand letztmals am 11. September in San Diego auf dem Platz. Aufgrund einer Lebensmittelvergiftung musste sie danach pausieren. Mit Roman Josi, Timo Meier und Pius Suter reihen sich in der Nacht auf Freitag in der NHL gleich drei Schweizer unter die Torschützen ein. Trotz dem zweiten Saisongoal von Roman Josi verloren die Nashville Predators ihr Auswärtsspiel gegen die Seattle Kraken 2:4. Der Berner Verteidiger erzielte in der 37. Minute mit einer schönen Direktabnahme im Powerplay den 2:2-Ausgleich. Nur 24 Sekunden später ging Seattle jedoch erneut in Führung und brachte diese über die Zeit. Auch Timo Meier in Diensten der New Jersey Devils traf in Überzahl und ebenfalls zum zweiten Mal in dieser Saison. Das 3:0 des Appenzellers beim 5:3-Auswärtssieg gegen die Minnesota Wild war wegweisend. Für die Devils war es der fünfte Sieg aus den letzten sechs Spielen. Während bei New Jersey Jesper Bratt mit vier Skorerpunkten (davon 1 Tor) glänzte, fehlte Captain Nico Hischier weiterhin verletzt.Pius Suter traf in seinem neunten Spiel für die Vancouver Canucks zum ersten Mal. Mit dem Tor zum 8:0 in der 38. Minute trug der Zürcher Drittlinien-Center beim 10:1-Kantersieg seines Teams auswärts gegen die desolat auftretenden San Jose Sharks zum Spektakel bei. Vancouvers Captain Quinn Hughes überzeugte mit einem Tor und vier Assists. Derweil bleiben die Sharks als einziges Team der Liga ohne Sieg. Der Regen machte am Donnerstag in Cancun, dem Schauplatz der WTA Finals, einen Strich durch die Rechnung. Das entscheidende Duell in der Gruppe A zwischen Aryna Sabalenka und Elena Rybakina konnte nicht zu Ende gespielt werden. Sabalenka, die Nummer 1 der Welt, lag nach gewonnenem Startsatz (6:2) im zweiten Durchgang bei Aufschlag Rybakina 3:5 hinten, als der Match abgebrochen werden musste. Die Siegerin dieses Duells wird den 2. Platz in der Gruppe belegen und das Ticket für die Halbfinals erhalten. Die Partie soll am späten Freitagnachmittag mexikanischer Zeit fortgesetzt werden. Jessica Pegula (ATP 5), die nach Siegen gegen die Belarussin und die Kasachin als Gruppensiegerin feststand, liess sich im ersten Einzelspiel des Tages nicht lange bitten. Die Amerikanerin besiegte die Griechin Maria Sakkari (WTA 9) in 80 Minuten mit 6:3, 6:2 und beendete die Vorrunde ungeschlagen. Union Berlins Trainer Urs Fischer wird wegen seiner Roten Karte im Anschluss an das Ausscheiden im DFB-Pokal beim VfB Stuttgart für ein Cupspiel gesperrt. Der Schweizer hatte den Schiedsrichter Sascha Stegemann aus Ärger über einen Entscheid nach der Partie konfrontiert, nach eigener Aussage aber nicht beleidigt. Auf die Spiele in der Bundesliga hat die Sperre keine Auswirkungen. Die tunesische Tennisspielerin Ons Jabeur (WTA 7) möchte einen Teil ihres Preisgeldes von den WTA-Finals in Cancun den Menschen in Palästina spenden. «Es ist sehr hart, jeden Tag Kinder und Babys sterben zu sehen. Es ist herzzerreissend», so Jabeur. Die 29-Jährige betonte dabei, dass es sich nicht um ein politisches Statement handle. Sie wolle Frieden in dieser Welt. Das sagte die ehemalige Weltranglistenzweite, nachdem sie sich im zweiten Gruppenspiel gegen die Tschechin Marketa Vondrousova mit 6:4, 6:3 durchsetzte. Joe Thornton kehrt nach seinem vor wenigen Tagen offizialisierten Rücktritt erneut nach Davos zurück. Der 44-jährige Kanadier amtet als Co-Trainer des Teams Canada, das in der Altjahreswoche den Spengler Cup bestreitet. Thornton, der während der NHL-Lockouts von 2004 und 2012 sowie als Leihspieler 2020 für den HCD gespielt hat und mit einer Davoserin verheiratet ist, wird die Kanadier zusammen mit Brad Pascall betreuen, dem Assistenztrainer der Calgary Flames. Assistiert werden die beiden von Luganos Sportchef Hnat Domenichelli. Beim am 26. Dezember beginnenden Spengler Cup trifft das Team Canada vorerst auf die Gruppengegner Frölunda aus Schweden und Gastgeber Davos. Die andere Gruppe bilden Ambri-Piotta, Pardubice aus Tschechien und Kalpa Kuopio aus Finnland. Die serbische Fussball-Nationalmannschaft muss im abschliessenden Heimspiel in der EM-Qualifikation gegen Bulgarien am 19. November ohne Zuschauer auskommen. Wegen rassistischer Vorfälle beim letzten Heimspiel gegen Montenegro (3:1) bestraft die Uefa den Verband mit einem «Geisterspiel». Serbien kämpft in Gruppe G noch um die EM-Teilnahme. Derzeit liegt das Team hinter Ungarn auf dem 2. Platz. Gespielt wird am 27./ 28./ oder 29. Februar 2024. Der FC Bayern reibt sich am Drittligisten Saarbrücken auf. Bis in die Schlussphase ist die Partie offen. Dann der Schock für die Münchner Stars. Völlig bedient standen die Stars des FC Bayern auf dem Rasen, während die Aussenseiter des 1. FC Saarbrücken ihren Coup ausgelassen feierten. Der Münchner Fussball-Rekordsieger ist im DFB-Pokal schon wieder weit vor dem Finale gescheitert. Auf dem tiefen Boden des Ludwigsparkstadions verlor das Team von Thomas Tuchel am Mittwochabend bei dem Drittligisten mit 1:2 (1:1). Drei Tage vor dem Bundesliga-Kracher bei Borussia Dortmund taten sich die Bayern in dem wegen der vielen Regenfälle lange gefährdeten Zweitrundenspiel mehr als schwer. «Ich kann es nicht glauben, das ist Wahnsinn», sagte Saarbrückens Torwart Tim Schreiber. «Einfach geil!». Vor 16 000 Zuschauern traf erst Thomas Müller (16.) für die Bayern, Stürmerstar Harry Kane wurde von Tuchel geschont. Patrick Sontheimer (45.+1) glich noch vor der Pause für den Drittligisten aus - und dann schoss Marcel Gaus (90.+6) den Aussenseiter ins Glück. Eine Knieverletzung von Matthijs de Ligt trübte den Abend der Bayern zusätzlich, die den Pokal zuletzt 2020 gewonnen hatten. FC Rapperswil-Jona - YB 0:2 Black Stars - FC Winterthur 2:6 Servette FC - FC Stade-Lausanne-Ouchy 4:1 n.P. SC Kriens - FC Basel 0:1 FC Lausanne-Sport - FC Lugano 0:4 SR Delémont - FC Luzern 1:0 Der FC Basel setzte in Kriens, beim Ligakonkurrenten von Delémont, nicht zu einem spielerischen Feuerwerk an, aber schaffte die Hauptsache: Er traf endlich wieder einmal und gewann mit 1:0. Djordje Jovanovic verwertete mit dem Kopf eine Flanke von Dominik Schmid und beendete damit die Torflaute des FC Basel nach über 400 Minuten. Für Fabio Celestini, den Nachfolger von Heiko Vogel auf der FCB-Trainerbank, war es in gelungener Einstand. Die Young Boys erfüllten ohne zu brillieren, aber auch ohne zu zittern gegen Rapperswil-Jona mit dem 2:0 die Pflicht. Die St. Galler verpassten es daheim vor 3150 Zuschauern, in den ersten Minuten der zweiten Halbzeit einen Treffer zu erzielen. Der Klub aus der Promotion League liess gleich eine ganze Reihe von guten Chancen ungenutzt, einmal parierte YB-Keeper David von Ballmoos sehr stark. YB reagierte auf die Druckphase des Unterklassigen humorlos mit dem 2:0 von Saidy Janko (57.). Den ersten Treffer hatte Jean-Pierre Nsame schon in der 2. Minute erzielt. Auch der FC Winterthur wurde seiner Favoritenrolle gerecht. Die Zürcher gewannen beim Basler Erstligisten Black Stars unter anderem dank zweier Tore von Nishan Burkart mit 6:2. Bis in die 38. Minute hielten sich die Unterklassigen schadlos, dann kassierten sie bis kurz vor Schluss sechs Tore und schliesslich sorgten sie mit zwei Treffern in der Schlussphase noch für einen versöhnlichen Abschluss ihres ersten Cup-Achtelfinals der Vereinsgeschichte. Servette musste im Westschweizer Duell mit Lausanne-Ouchy trotz Überlegenheit das Penaltyschiessen abwarten, um zum ersten Mal seit 18 Jahren einen Super-League-Klub im Cup zu eliminieren. Lausanne-Ouchy konnte auf das 1:0 von Servette durch Topskorer Chris Bedia (73.) durch Mergim Qarri (84.) reagieren. Im Penaltyschiessen trafen alle Genfer, unter ihnen Bedia, aber nur ein Lausanner. In der ersten Halbzeit hatte der Servettien Jérémy Guillemenot noch einen Elfmeter verschossen. Das andere Achtelfinal-Duell zwischen Super-League-Klubs wurde zur klaren Angelegenheit: Lugano setzte sich bei Lausanne-Sport ohne Mühe mit 4:0 durch. Die Tessiner, Cupsieger 2022 und Finalist 2023, haben von den letzten 15 Partien im Cup nur das Endspiel der Vorsaison gegen YB verloren. In Lausanne kam den Luganesi entgegen, dass die Gastgeber schon ab der 5. Minute mit einem Spieler weniger auskommen musste. Raoul Giger sah für eine gefährliches Foul die Rote Karte. Lugano spielte danach routiniert und führte schon zur Pause mit 2:0. Renato Steffen brillierte als Vorbereiter von Shkelqim Vladis 1:0 und als Penalty-Torschütze zum 2:0. Der Meister Genève-Servette verliert nach und nach seinen Status als stärkste Heimmannschaft der neuen Saison. Die Genfer unterlagen am Mittwochabend gegen Davos 1:2. Dortmund und Leverkusen stehen nach Siegen über Hoffenheim respektive Sandhausen im Achtelfinal des deutschen Cups. Freiburg muss nach einer Heimpleite gegen Zweitligist Paderborn bereits in der 2. Runde die Segel streichen. Borussia Dortmund zog im Duell zweier Bundesligisten gegen Hoffenheim dank eines Treffers von Routinier Marco Reus in die Achtelfinals ein. Das Team von Gregor Kobel ist nach dem 1:0-Sieg und vor dem Gipfeltreffen vom Samstag gegen Bayern München saison- und wettbewerbsübergreifend seit 26 Heimspielen ungeschlagen. Erstaunlich viel Mühe bekundete Bundesliga-Leader Leverkusen beim 5:2 über Drittligist Sandhausen. Die auf mehreren Positionen rotierte «Werkself» musste in der zweiten Halbzeit zweimal den Ausgleich hinnehmen, ehe Nati-Captain Granit Xhaka ins Geschehen eingriff. Die Entscheidung führte der Favorit erst in den letzten fünf Minuten der Partie herbei. Eine herbe 1:3-Heimpleite kassierte Freiburg gegen Zweitligist Paderborn. Letztmals so früh ausgeschieden ist das Team von Trainer Christian Streich vor drei Jahren. Vergangene Saison stiessen die Breisgauer bis in den Halbfinal vor, 2022 standen sie gar im Final. Der Schweizer Nationaltrainer Patrick Fischer hat für den Karjala Cup vom 9. bis 12. November in Tampere in Finnland 26 Spieler aufgeboten. Dem Kader gehört mit dem Stürmer Marco Lehmann vom SC Bern ein Debütant an. Der Schweizer Tross reist zwecks optimaler Vorbereitung am Montag nach Finnland. Das erste Spiel bestreitet Fischers Equipe am Donnerstag gegen Finnland. Am Samstag und am Sonntag folgen die Partien gegen Schweden beziehungsweise Tschechien. «Zum Aufgebot gehört ein grosser Teil der letzten WM-Mannschaft», sagt Fischer. «Wir wollen den WM-Spirit wieder aufnehmen und dort weiterarbeiten, wo wir vor dem Sommer aufgehört haben.» Aus Rücksicht auf die Mannschaften, die in der Champions Hockey League mitspielen, hat der Coach auf verschiedene Spieler dieser Vereine verzichtet. Die SCL Tigers verpflichten den Center Joshua Fahrni vom Kantonsrivalen SC Bern. Der 21-Jährige, der bereits 128 Spiele in der National League absolviert hat und sechs Mal für die A-Nationalmannschaft auf dem Eis stand, unterschrieb bis in den Frühling 2026. Der EHC Kloten verstärkt sein Kader mit dem Kanadier Nathan Beaulieu. Die Verpflichtung des 30-jährigen Verteidigers erfolgt nur einen Tag nach dem Abgang des Schweden Lucas Ekestahl-Jonsson. Beaulieu, der einen bis Ende Saison gültigen Vertrag unterzeichnet hat, bringt grosse Erfahrung aus der NHL mit. In der weltbesten Liga hat er beinahe 500 Partien bestritten. Die letzte Saison hat er für die Anaheim Ducks gespielt. Die Schweizer Weltmeisterinnen reisen mit fünf Spielerinnen zum Finalturnier des Billie Jean King Cups von nächster Woche in Sevilla. Bereits am Donnerstag fliegt das Schweizer Team nach Spanien - mit dem Ziel, den Vorjahressieg zu wiederholen. Auch die zuletzt unter den Nachwehen einer Lebensmittelvergiftung leidende Belinda Bencic (WTA 14) ist dabei. Die Olympiasiegerin musste seit Mitte September pausieren. Weiter bot Captain Heinz Günthardt neben den bereits bekannten Viktorija Golubic (WTA 83), Jil Teichmann (WTA 142) und Debütantin Céline Naef (WTA 137) mit der letztjährigen Finalistin Simona Waltert (WTA 167) eine fünfte Spielerin auf. Die Schweiz startet am Dienstag gegen Tschechien ins Turnier, zwei Tage später folgt die zweite Partie in der Dreiergruppe gegen die USA. Nur der Sieger der Gruppe erreicht die Halbfinals. Die Schweizer Eishockey-Nationalmannschaft bekommt es an den Olympischen Spielen 2026 in Mailand voraussichtlich mit Rekord-Olympiasieger Kanada, Schweden und Gastgeber Italien zu tun. Die Gruppeneinteilung für die Vorrunde basiert auf der Annahme, dass Russland sowie das in der Qualifikation gesetzte Belarus 2026 zu den Winterspielen zugelassen sind. Sollten die beiden Nationen aufgrund des Angriffskrieges gegen die Ukraine vom olympischen Turnier ausgeschlossen werden, hat eine Neueinteilung zu erfolgen. Ein Entscheid des Weltverbandes IIHF über eine Teilnahme respektive einen Ausschluss von Russland und Belarus soll im Frühjahr 2024 fallen. Die Gruppeneinteilung für die Vorrunde erfolgt gemäss der Weltrangliste, in der die Schweiz den 7. Rang belegt. Die Top 8 sind für das Olympia-Turnier gesetzt. Die restlichen drei Plätze neben dem Gastgeber Italien werden im Spätsommer 2024 in Qualifikationsturnieren ermittelt. Bei einem Ausschluss Russlands würde die Slowakei als Weltranglisten-Neunte als Fix-Starter nachrücken. Das wegen des Nahost-Konfliktes verschobene EM-Qualifikationsspiel zwischen Israel und der Schweiz wird im ungarischen Felcsut stattfinden. Das entschied die UEFA in Absprache mit dem israelischen Verband. Felcsut ist 50 Kilometer von Budapest entfernt. Das Stadion, die vor knapp zehn Jahren eingeweihte Pancho Arena, zählt 4000 Plätze. Die ursprünglich für den 12. Oktober terminierte Partie was schon vor einiger Zeit auf Mittwoch, 15. November verschoben worden. Danach musste ein neuer Austragungsort gefunden werden, weil bis auf Weiteres keine internationalen Spiele in Israel durchgeführt werden. Mitte November wartet auf die Schweizer Nationalmannschaft ein dichtes Programm mit den EM-Qualifikationsspielen gegen Israel in Felcsut (15.11.), gegen Kosovo in Basel (18.11.) und zum Abschluss der Kampagne gegen Rumänien in Bukarest (21.11.). Der neue Trainer von Aufsteiger Yverdon heisst Alessandro Mangiarratti. Der 45-jährige Tessiner tritt die Nachfolge des am Montag entlassenen Marco Schällibum an. Mangiarratti wird am Donnerstag offiziell vorgestellt. Er werde die Spielerentwicklung zu einer seiner Hauptaufgaben machen, schrieb der Verein. Mangarriatti arbeitete zuletzt beim FC Vaduz, den er überraschend in die Gruppenphase der Conference League führte. Im November 2022 wurde er bei den Liechtensteinern entlassen. Yverdon belegt in der Super League mit 16 Punkten aus zwölf Partien den 8. Tabellenrang. Am Sonntag treffen die Waadtländer auswärts auf Basel, das ebenfalls in dieser Woche den Trainer gewechselt hat. Der EV Zug verpflichtet den Torhüter Tim Wolf. Der 31-Jährige wechselt auf die kommende Saison nach fünf Jahren beim HC Ajoie zu den Innerschweizern. Er unterschrieb einen Vertrag über zwei Jahre als Nummer 2 hinter dem siebenfachen Meistergoalie Leonardo Genoni. Mit der Verpflichtung von Wolf ist klar, dass Luca Hollenstein den EVZ verlassen wird. Er dürfte sich dem HC Davos anschliessen. Der FC Basel entlässt per sofort Heiko Vogel als Trainer. Zwei Tage nach der 3:0-Niederlage gegen Lausanne-Sport kam der Klub zum Entschluss den Trainer zu entlassen. Dies gab der Klub am Dienstagmorgen in einer Medienmitteilung bekannt. Die Nachfolge ist ebenfalls bereits geregelt: Für Vogel übernimmt der 48-jährige Fabio Celestini. Er war zuletzt bis im März 2023 beim FC Sion als Trainer angestellt. Künftig steht er beim FCB an der Seitenlinie. Australien wird sich nicht für die Fussball-Weltmeisterschaft der Männer 2034 bewerben und macht damit den Weg für Saudi-Arabien frei. «Wir haben die Möglichkeit geprüft, uns um die Ausrichtung der FIFA Fussball-WM zu bewerben, und sind nach Abwägung aller Faktoren zu dem Schluss gekommen, dies für den Wettbewerb 2034 nicht zu tun», teilte der australische Fussball-Verband FA am Dienstag mit. An diesem Dienstag läuft die Frist für eine Interessenbekundung beim Weltverband FIFA ab. Saudi-Arabien hat seine Absicht bereits klargemacht und gilt als klarer Favorit. Anfang Oktober hatte bereits die Asiatische Fussballkonföderation (AFC) eine saudische Bewerbung unterstützt. Nachdem dann über eine gemeinsame Bewerbung von Australien, Indonesien und Neuseeland oder von Australien, Indonesien, Malaysia und Singapur spekuliert worden war, bekundete Indonesien aber ebenfalls die Unterstützung für Saudi-Arabien. Dadurch sanken die ohnehin geringen Chancen der Australier gen Null. In der Erklärung des australischen Verbandes wurde Saudi-Arabien aber weder erwähnt noch die Bewerbung des Golfstaates unterstützt. Am zweiten Tag der WTA Finals im mexikanischen Cancun gab es zwei Favoritensiege. Die Polin Iga Swiatek (WTA 2) bezwang die tschechische Wimbledon-Siegerin Marketa Vondrousova (WTA 6) nach einem 2:5-Rückstand 7:6 (7:3), 6:0. Die amerikanische US-Open-Gewinnerin Coco Gauff (WTA 3) fertige die Tunesierin Ons Jabeur (WTA 7) 6:0, 6:1 ab. Es war für die 19-Jährige der 50. Sieg in dieser Saison. Am Mittwoch Ortszeit kommt es zum Duell zwischen Swiatek und Gauff. Stan Wawrinka (ATP 51) ist auch beim Masters-1000-Turnier in Paris in der ersten Runde ausgeschieden. Der 38-jährige Waadtländer unterlag dem Österreicher Dominic Thiem (ATP 108) nach 2:31 Stunden mit 6:3, 3:6, 5:7. Die Partie war erst um 2.22 Uhr morgens zu Ende. Wawrinka vergab im Duell zweier Sieger von Grand-Slam-Turnieren beim Stand von 5:3 und 40:30 im dritten Satz mit einem Doppelfehler einen Matchball. Überhaupt erlebt er einen schwierigen Herbst. Es war für ihn die vierte Erstrundenniederlage in den letzten fünf Turnieren, die zweite in Serie nach jener in Basel. Nächste Woche tritt er in Metz an, dort erreichte er im vergangenen Jahr die Halbfinals. Einen Tag nach dem Sieg in Milwaukee setzten sich die Atlanta Hawks mit Clint Capela in der NBA mit 127:113 auch gegen die Minnesota Timberwolves durch. Zur Halbzeit sah es noch danach aus, als würden die Hawks auch im dritten Heimspiel der Saison das Parkett als Verlierer verlassen, lagen sie doch 60:79 in Rückstand. Dann aber drehten die Gastgeber auf, womit sie nun mit je zwei Siegen und Niederlagen eine ausgeglichene Bilanz haben. Capela kam in den letzten knapp 17 Minuten des Spiels nicht mehr zum Einsatz. Er musste sich mit zwei Punkten und fünf Rebounds begnügen. Grossen Anteil am Sieg von Atlanta hatte Dejounte Murray, der mit 41 Zählern den persönlichen Punkterekord in der NBA egalisierte. Beim 125:110-Sieg der Dallas Mavericks bei den Memphis Grizzlies gelang Luka Doncic sein 58. Triple-Double in der besten Basketball-Liga der Welt. Der Slowene verzeichnete 35 Punkte sowie je zwölf Rebounds und Assists. Verteidiger Janis Moser feierte in der NHL mit den Arizona Coyotes einen 8:1-Kantersieg gegen die Chicago Blackhawks mit Philipp Kuraschew. Beide Schweizer blieben ohne Skorerpunkt. Michael Carcone (3 Tore/1 Assist) und Jack McBain (2/2) verzeichneten je vier Skorerpunkte. Das Tor für Chicago zum 1:0 erzielte nach 28 Sekunden der 18-jährige Connor Bedard, der in seinem neunten NHL-Spiel zum vierten Mal erfolgreich war. Nino Niederreiter verlor mit den Winnipeg Jets zu Hause gegen die New York Rangers 2:3 nach Verlängerung. Der Churer Stürmer trug sich nach vier Punkten in den vorangegangenen zwei Partien diesmal nicht in die Skorerliste ein. Das entscheidende Tor für die Gäste schoss Mika Zibanejad 26 Sekunden vor dem Ende der Verlängerung. Artemi Panarin, der für das 1:0 (19.) der Rangers verantwortlich zeichnete, hatte bei allen drei Toren seines Teams den Stock im Spiel. Titelverteidiger Vegas Golden Knights gelang im zehnten Saisonspiel der neunte Sieg - 3:2 nach Penaltyschiessen gegen die Montreal Canadiens. Auch die Boston Bruins haben nach dem 3:2 gegen die Florida Panthers weiterhin erst ein Spiel in der laufenden Meisterschaft (8 Erfolge) verloren. Der am Montag in Yverdon entlassene Marco Schällibaum wurde von der Swiss Football League für vier Spiele gesperrt. Der Zürcher büsst für sein Fehlverhalten im Heimspiel gegen Winterthur (1:1). Er habe die technische Zone verlassen mit der Absicht zu provozieren und aufzuhetzen, heisst es von Seiten der Liga. Zudem beleidigte er einen Spieler von Winterthur Lausannes Offensivspieler Chris Kablan wurde für drei Partien gesperrt, nachdem er im Heimspiel gegen Basel (3:0) kurz nach seiner Einwechslung in der Schlussphase die Rote Karten gesehen hatte. Er leistete sich ein grobes Foul mit hohem Verletzungsrisiko. Yverdons Christopher Lungoyi wird nebst der einen Sperre wegen zweier Gelber Karten gegen Winterthur womöglich weiter bestraft. Gegen den Flügelspieler wurde ein Verfahren eröffnet, weil er nach dem Schlusspfiff eine unangebrachte Geste in Richtung von Schiedsrichter Nico Gianforte machte. Der FSV Mainz 05 ermöglicht dem zunächst freigestellten Fussballprofi Anwar El Ghazi nun doch eine Rückkehr. Der 28 Jahre alte Holländer kehre zeitnah in den Trainings- und Spielbetrieb zurück, gab der Bundesligist am Montag bekannt. El Ghazi werde für die Veröffentlichung eines Beitrages in den sozialen Medien vor zwei Wochen abgemahnt. Die Mainzer hatten zunächst mit Härte auf einen inzwischen wieder gelöschten Pro-Palästina-Post von El Ghazi bei Instagram reagiert. «Vor dem Hintergrund des erfolgten Commitments El Ghazis und der von ihm gezeigten Reue, gebietet es die im Verein verankerte Kultur im Umgang mit Fehlern, dem Spieler eine Chance zur Rehabilitation einzuräumen», hiess es in einer Mitteilung der Mainzer. Das in dieser Saison noch sieglose Tabellenschlusslicht hat derzeit wegen diverser Ausfälle nur noch wenige Stürmer zur Verfügung. Der ehemalige Fussball-Profi John van ’t Schip soll den holländischen Tabellenletzten Ajax Amsterdam als neuer Trainer aus der Krise führen. Wie der Rekordmeister aus der Eredivisie am Montag mitteilte, erhält der 59-Jährige für diesen Job einen Vertrag bis zum Ende der laufenden Saison. Anschliessend soll er ein weiteres Jahr im Management von Ajax arbeiten. Van ’t Schip spielte von 1981 bis 1992 bereits für die Amsterdamer und begann nach seiner aktiven Karriere eine Laufbahn als Trainer. Amsterdam hatte sich in der Vorwoche nach dem schlechtesten Saisonstart der Vereinsgeschichte vom bisherigen Chefcoach Maurice Steijn getrennt. Zunächst hatte Steijns Assistent Hedwiges Maduro eine Woche als Trainer fungiert und wird nun wieder die Rolle als Co-Trainer übernehmen. Ajax verbuchte im Saisonverlauf in der höchsten Liga der Niederlande bislang erst einen Sieg und holte in acht Begegnungen lediglich fünf Punkte. Am Sonntag setzte es ein 2:5 bei Spitzenreiter PSV Eindhoven. Wie die welsche Zeitung «24 heures» berichtet, trennt sich der Super-League-Klub Yverdon von seinem Trainer Marco Schällibaum. Das ist überraschend. Schliesslich ist der 61-jährige Zürcher mit den Waadtländern in der vergangenen Saison überraschend aufgestiegen. Und selbst in der höchsten Spielklasse hat Yverdon bislang eher positiv überrascht. Obwohl als Aussenseiter angetreten, belegt Yverdon nach 12 Runden den achten Platz. Nach dem Kuss-Skandal hat die Fifa den ehemaligen spanischen Verbandspräsidenten Luis Rubiales für drei Jahre gesperrt. Durch die Entscheidung der Disziplinarkommission wird der 46-Jährige für jegliche Fussballtätigkeit auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene ausgeschlossen. Dies gab der Weltverband am Montag bekannt. Laut Fifa habe Rubiales mit seinem Verhalten bei der Siegerehrung des WM-Finals im August gegen Artikel 13 des Disziplinarreglements verstossen. Der Spanier hatte Nationalspielerin Jennifer Hermoso nach dem Endspielsieg gegen England in Sydney übergriffig auf den Mund geküsst. Der Fall löste weltweit einen Sturm der Entrüstung aus. Die Fifa hatte Rubiales zunächst provisorisch für 90 Tage suspendiert. Unter grossem Druck trat er erst nach einiger Zeit von seinem Posten als Chef des spanischen Verbandes RFEF zurück. Die Weltmeisterinnen um Hermoso waren zwischenzeitlich in den Streik getreten. Auch die spanischen Behörden beschäftigen sich mit dem Fall. Am Montag wird in Paris zum 67. Mal der Ballon d’Or vergeben. Bei den Männern läuft es wohl auf einen Zweikampf zwischen Lionel Messi und Erling Haaland hinaus. Messi könnte bei der Ehrung von seiner überragenden WM in Katar Ende vergangenen Jahres profitieren. Haaland war indes mit seinen vielen Toren massgeblich daran beteiligt, dass Manchester City erstmals die Champions League gewann und dazu auch die Meisterschaft und den FA Cup. Bei den Frauen darf sich die spanische Weltmeisterin Aitana Bonmati grosse Hoffnungen auf die Auszeichnung machen, die von der Fachzeitschrift France Football vergeben wird. e New Jersey Devils feiern in der NHL im achten Saisonspiel den fünften Sieg. Sie bezwingen zu Hause die Minnesota Wild 4:3. Timo Meier bereitete im Powerplay mit einem Querpass das 4:2 von Doppel-Torschütze Jesper Bratt vor. Der Appenzeller Stürmer punktete in der fünften Partie in Serie und hält nun bei sieben Skorerpunkten (ein Treffer) in der laufenden Meisterschaft. Verteidiger Jonas Siegenthaler erhielt bei New Jersey mit 21:40 Minuten am zweitmeisten Einsatzzeit und verliess das Eis mit einer Plus-1-Bilanz. Captain Nico Hischier fehlte den Devils wegen einer im Spiel zuvor gegen die Buffalo Sabres erlittenen Oberkörperverletzung, Goalie Akira Schmid war Ersatz. Die hoch gehandelten Edmonton Oilers kamen nach vier Niederlagen zum zweiten Saisonsieg. Evander Kane steuerte ein Tor und zwei Assists zum 5:2 vor heimischem Publikum gegen die Calgary Flames bei. Connor McDavid kehrte nach zwei verpassten Partien aufgrund einer Oberkörperverletzung in die Aufstellung zurück und liess sich einen Assist gutschreiben. Aryna Sabalenka, die Nummer 1 der Welt, startete mit einer Machtdemonstration in die WTA Finals in Cancun. Die 25-jährige Belarussin gewann in Mexiko gegen Maria Sakkari (WTA 9) die ersten elf Games, worauf die Griechin nach drei abgewehrten Matchbällen mit dem 1:5 immerhin ein «Velo» verhinderte. Die beiden trafen zum dritten Mal an den WTA Finals aufeinander, die ersten beiden Male siegte Sakkari. Im ersten Spiel des Turniers setzte sich Jessica Pegula (WTA 5) gegen die Kasachin Jelena Rybakina (WTA 4) 7:5, 6:2 durch. Nach dem 3:5 sicherte sich die Amerikanerin sechs Games in Serie. In der Gruppe B spielen Iga Swiatek (WTA 2), Coco Gauff (WTA 3), Marketa Vondrousova (WTA 6) sowie Ons Jabeur (WTA 7). Max Verstappen feierte im Grand Prix von Mexiko seinen 51. Sieg in der Formel 1. Der Niederländer im Red Bull wurde zum 16. Mal in dieser Saison als Erster abgewinkt und übertraf damit seinen Rekord aus dem Vorjahr. The records keep tumbling for An incredible 16th win of the season 🤩 Mit Verstappen aufs Podest stiegen Lewis Hamilton im Mercedes und Charles Leclerc im Ferrari. Für Lokalmatador Sergio Perez war das Heimrennen nach einer Startkollision mit Leclerc schon früh zu Ende. Valtteri Bottas und Zhou Guanyu in den Alfa Romeo belegten die Plätze 14 und 15. Paradiesvogel Peter Wright hat in Dortmund seinen zweiten Titel bei der Darts-Europameisterschaft gewonnen. Nach 2020 setzte sich der 53 Jahre alte Schotte nach einem 11:6-Finalsieg über Englands James Wade nun auch im Jahr 2023 durch. «Snakebite», wie der für seine bunten Kostüme und Frisuren bekannte Wright genannt wird, krönte am Sonntagabend ein starkes Turnier, bei dem er unter anderem Weltmeister Michael Smith aus England klar besiegte. Gegen den Deutschen Gabriel Clemens wäre er beim 6:5 in Runde eins beinahe ausgeschieden. WRIGHT IS THE EUROPEAN CHAMPION ONCE AGAIN 🏆🏆 Peter Wright is crowned the European Champion for the second time with victory over James Wade 👏🏻👏🏻 Der zweimalige Weltmeister Wright setzte sich in seinem Halloween-Outfit souverän durch und spielte ein dominantes Finale. Der bedeutende Major-Titel hilft Wright auch in der sogenannten Order of Merit, der Weltrangliste. Wright zieht mit den 120'000 Pfund am Niederländer Michael van Gerwen vorbei und übernimmt wieder den zweiten Platz im Ranking. Nur Weltmeister Smith hat noch mehr Preisgeld in den vergangenen zwei Jahren eingespielt. In gut sechs Wochen (15. Dezember bis 3. Januar) beginnt im Alexandra Palace von London die Weltmeisterschaft. Bei einem Angriff mit Steinen auf den Mannschaftsbus von Olympique Lyon vor dem Auswärtsspiel bei Olympique Marseille ist Trainer Fabio Grosso am Kopf getroffen und verletzt worden. Auf Fotos und Videos war am Sonntagabend zu sehen, wie der frühere italienische Fussball-Weltmeister blutend durch die Katakomben ging. Auch Lyons Co-Trainer Raffaele Longo soll verletzt worden sein, der Bus soll kurz vor Ankunft am Stadion mit Steinen beworfen worden sein. Eine Stellungnahme beider Vereine steht noch aus. Die Partie wurde abgesagt. Lokalmatador Sergio Perez ist beim Formel-1-Rennen in Mexiko nach einem Crash in der Auftaktrunde ausgeschieden. Der mexikanische Red-Bull-Pilot versuchte, Pole-Mann Charles Leclerc in der ersten Kurve übermotiviert aussen zu überholen. Dabei touchierten sich aber beide Wagen, der Red Bull von Perez hob mit drei Rädern sogar ab. Trümmerteile flogen anschliessend auf den Asphalt. Leclerc konnte das Rennen fortsetzen. DRAMA AT TURN 1!!! Perez and Leclerc make contact 💥 Perez limps on but he is out of the race ❌ Perez, dessen Zukunft bei Red Bull als Teamkollege von Weltmeister Max Verstappen weiter fraglich ist, fuhr indes an die Box. Die Crew konnte seinen beschädigten Wagen aber nicht mehr reparieren, bitter enttäuscht stieg der 33-Jährige aus dem Auto. Das Virtuelle Safety Car wurde vorübergehend eingesetzt. Der frühere Bundesliga-Profi Bas Dost ist am Sonntagabend beim Spiel seines niederländischen Klubs NEC Nijmegen bei AZ Alkmaar dramatisch kollabiert. Der 34-Jährige sackte in der Nachspielzeit ohne gegnerische Einwirkung im Mittelkreis zusammen und lag regungslos auf dem Rücken. Nach bangen Minuten der Erstversorgung teilte AZ mit, dass Dost bei Bewusstsein und ansprechbar sei. Das Spiel wurde nach dem Vorfall zunächst unterbrochen und dann abgebrochen. Torgarant Erling Haaland hat Manchester City zu einem souveränen Sieg im Derby beim Stadtrivalen United geführt. Mit einem Doppelpack sowie einer Torvorlage war der Norweger beim 3:0 (1:0) im Old Trafford der entscheidende Mann und baute seine Saisonbilanz auf elf Treffer in zehn Premier-League-Spielen aus. Mit 24 Punkten bleibt Champions-League-Sieger ManCity, der vier der jüngsten fünf Derbys gewonnen hat, als Tabellendritter dem Spitzenreiter Tottenham Hotspur (26) auf den Fersen, der FC Arsenal liegt punktgleich mit den Citizens auf Platz drei. Tottenham (2:1 am Freitag bei Crystal Palace) und Arsenal (5:0 am Samstag gegen Sheffield United) hatten bereits vorgelegt. Manchester United (15) ist nach der fünften Saisonniederlage Achter. Haaland, in der Vorsaison bei Citys 6:3-Heimgala gegen ManUnited gleich dreimal erfolgreich, traf zunächst in der 26. Spielminute per Foulelfmeter. In der zweiten Halbzeit schliesslich per Kopf (49.) nach einer Flanke von Bernardo Silva für die Mannschaft von Teammanager Pep Guardiola erfolgreich. Phil Foden (80.) traf dann nach Haaland-Vorlage zum 3:0. Der HC Ajoie verpflichtet mit Dmitro Timaschow einen achten Ausländer. Der schwedisch-ukrainische Angreifer unterschreibt vorerst für zwei Monate mit der Option, den Vertrag bis Ende der Saison zu verlängern. Zuletzt spielte der 27-Jährige, der 2015 von den Toronto Maple Leafs gedraftet wurde, sich in der NHL aber nie wirklich durchsetzen konnte, zwei Saisons für das schwedische Team Brynäs. Die Young Boys können nicht von Zürichs Ausrutscher profitieren. Nach Führung müssen sich die Berner in Lugano mit einem 1:1 begnügen. Derweil verliert Basel das Kellerduell gegen Lausanne-Sport gleich mit 0:3. Nachdem Filip Ugrinic die Gäste in der 60. Minute verdient in Führung gebracht hatte, schien YB nach Punkten zu Leader Zürich aufzuschliessen. Luganos Yanis Cimignani hatte jedoch etwas dagegen. Nach schönem Pass von Renato Steffen schlenzte der Franzose den Ball in der 78. Minute zum Ausgleich ins Netz. Damit bleiben die Berner in der Tabelle zwei Punkte hinter dem FCZ, haben allerdings ein Spiel weniger ausgetragen. Am anderen Ende der Rangliste wird der FC Basel langsam abgehängt. Beim 0:3 gegen Lausanne-Sport blieb der von Heiko Vogel trainierte FCB zum vierten Mal in Serie ohne Tor und ohne Punkte. Das spektakulärste Sonntagsspiel fand in Genf statt. Erst drehten die Gäste aus Luzern nach frühem Rückstand die Partie, ehe Servette sich mit drei Treffern nochmals zurückmeldete. Dank dem 4:2-Heimsieg machen die Genfer einen Sprung auf den 4. Platz. Eine gute Runde war es auch für St. Gallen, das am Samstag 3:1 gegen GC gewann und somit zu YB und Zürich (1:1 gegen Lausanne-Ouchy) aufschloss. Dominique Aegerter hebt sich das Beste in seiner ersten Saison in der Superbike-WM für den Schluss auf. Der Oberaargauer wird in den letzten Rennen beim Finale in Jerez in Spanien Zweiter und Dritter. Schon am Samstag im ersten Rennen über die normale Distanz in Andalusien hatte sich Aegerter Hoffnungen auf eine Spitzenklassierung machen dürfen. Losgefahren war er von Startplatz 2, in der Qualifikation war einzig der neue und alte Weltmeister, der Spanier Alvaro Bautista auf Ducati, schneller gewesen. Ein Problem mit der Elektronik an der Yamaha liess den Traum vom Exploit jedoch platzen. Am Sonntag vor der Prüfung über die verkürzte Distanz, in dieser Rennklasse offiziell als Superpole-Race bezeichnet, stand Aegerter wiederum neben Bautista in der Frontreihe. Die neuerliche Chance packte er beim Schopf - in einem Rennen, in dem er vorerst erneut mit der Technik an der Yamaha zu kämpfen hatte. Diesmal hatte er Ölverlust zu beklagen; die sichtbare Spur machte den Unterbruch des Rennens nötig. Die zweite Tranche führte über noch acht Runden, nach denen Aegerter nach dem Wechsel auf das Ersatz-Motorrad mit anderthalb Sekunden Rückstand auf Saisondominator Bautista das Ziel erreichte. Gut drei Stunden nach dem ersten Podiumsrang in dieser Serie doppelte Aegerter gleich nach. Im zweiten Hauptrennen des Wochenendes belegte er hinter Bautista und dem Türken Toprak Razgatlioglu, einem Markenkollegen, Platz 3. Razgatlioglu entschied das packende Duell gegen den Spanier zwar hauchdünn für sich. Wegen Überschreitens der Streckenbegrenzung musste er den Sieg jedoch seinem Dauerrivalen überlassen. Dank dem versöhnlichen Saisonabschluss, den er auch als Entschädigung für viele Ungereimtheiten und Enttäuschungen im Verlauf dieser Weltmeisterschaft betrachten darf, stiess Aegerter in der Gesamtwertung auf Platz 8 vor. Real Madrids französischer Fussball-Nationalspieler Aurélien Tchouameni hat sich im Clásico den Mittelfuss gebrochen. Wie die Königlichen am Tag nach dem 2:1 in der spanischen Liga gegen den FC Barcelona mitteilten, sei dies das Ergebnis einer medizinischen Untersuchung vom Sonntag. Konkret wurde bei dem 23 Jahre alten Mittelfeldspieler eine «Stressfraktur am zweiten Mittelfussknochen des linken Fusses» diagnostiziert, wie es in einer Vereinsmitteilung hiess. Wie lange Tchouameni, der am Samstag die gesamte Spielzeit gegen Barça auf dem Rasen stand, der Mannschaft von Trainer Carlo Ancelotti fehlen wird, wurde nicht mitgeteilt. Parte médico de Tchouameni. Der Spielbetrieb der höchsten britischen Eishockey-Liga wird von einem tragischen Vorfall überschattet. Der 29-jährige Amerikaner Adam Johnson von den Nottingham Panthers ist seinen schweren Verletzungen am Hals erlegen, die er am Samstag in der Partie bei den Sheffield Steelers erlitten hatte. Johnson war von einer Schlittschuh-Kufe getroffen worden. Die gesamte Eishockeyfamilie trauert um Adam Johnson. Der Stürmer, der in der letzten Saison noch das Trikot der trug, wurde Samstagabend im Spiel seiner Nottingham Panthers von einem Schlittschuh am Hals getroffen und erlag seinen schweren Verletzungen. Vor seinem Wechsel nach Nottingham auf diese Saison hin hatte Johnson unter anderem ein paar Spiele für die Pittsburgh Penguins in der National Hockey League bestritten. In der letzten Saison war er in Deutschland für Augsburg tätig. Titelverteidiger Südafrika hat ein intensives Duell der Rugby-Grossmächte gewonnen und ist nun alleiniger Rekordweltmeister. Die Springboks setzten sich im Finale gegen Neuseeland am Samstagabend in Paris mit 12:11 (12:6) durch, nach 1995, 2007 und 2019 ist es der vierte WM-Titel für Südafrika. Kapitän Siya Kolisi unterstrich die Bedeutung des Erfolgs, die weit über einen sportlichen Sieg hinausgehe. «Von aussen kann man das vielleicht nicht komplett verstehen», sagte er, «unser Land macht so viel durch, so vielen Kindern geht es nicht gut, aber wir können für Hoffnung sorgen und zeigen: Wenn wir zusammenarbeiten, dann ist alles möglich.» Die All Blacks durchlebten vor 80.000 Zuschauern im Stade de France und Millionen vor den Bildschirmen dagegen einen tragischen Abend, verloren unter anderem Kapitän Sam Cane mit Roter Karte - eine solche Strafe hatte es in einem WM-Finale noch nie gegeben. Beide Teams sahen zudem insgesamt viermal Gelb, mehr als eine Gelbe Karte gab es zuvor in keinem Endspiel einer Weltmeisterschaft. Neuseeland, Weltmeister von 1987, 2011 und 2015, musste sich damit auch im zweiten Endspiel gegen den grossen Rivalen geschlagen geben. 1995 hatte es diese Paarung schon einmal gegeben, das Finale in Südafrika ging nicht nur aus sportlichen Gründen in die Geschichte ein: Die Springboks traten damals erstmals mit schwarzen und weissen Spielern an, Bilder von Nelson Mandela im grün-gelben Trikot gingen damals um die Welt. Zürich könnte am Sonntag die Tabellenführung an die Young Boys verlieren. Die Zürcher müssen sich in der 12. Runde der Super League daheim gegen Lausanne-Ouchy mit einem 1:1 begnügen. St. Gallen bleibt nach dem 3:1 gegen GC im eigenen Stadion ohne Punktverlust. Der FCZ kassierte gegen Lausanne-Ouchy in der 24. Minute das 0:1 durch den jungen Ismael Gharbi. Kurz vor der Pause gelang durch einen von Jonathan Okita verwandelten Penalty der Ausgleich. Trotz einer Steigerung nach der Pause reichte es dem FCZ nicht zum Sieg gegen den Aussenseiter. 90. Schluss im Letzigrund. Wir spielen 1:1-Unentschieden im ersten Heimspiel der Vereinsgeschichte gegen den . Das Tor für den Stadtclub erzielte Jonathan Okita. 1:1 | St. Gallen bewerkstelligte den sechsten Sieg in ebenso vielen Heimspielen dank Toren von Chadrac Akolo, Willem Geubbels und Mattia Zanotti in der ersten Halbzeit. Für das nach zwei Siegen in Folge gebremste GC hatte Tsiy Ndenge zum 1:1 ausgeglichen. Im dritten Samstagsspiel trennten sich Yverdon und Winterthur 1:1. Der FCW vergab in der 80. Minute durch einen verschossenen Penalty von Roman Buess den möglichen Sieg. Am Sonntag spielt YB in Lugano, der FC Basel tritt bei Lausanne-Sport an und Luzern gastiert bei Servette. 24 Stunden nach der Heimniederlage gegen Lugano gewinnen die ZSC Lions (2.) das Spitzenspiel in der National League auswärts bei Leader Fribourg-Gottéron mit 3:1. Verteidiger Willy Riedi brachte die ZSC Lions schon nach 14 Sekunden in der ausverkauften St-Léonard-Halle in Führung. Derek Grant erhöhte im zweiten Abschnitt im Powerplay auf 2:0. Den Anschlusstreffer des Heimteams durch Benoit Jecker beantwortete der ZSC im Schlussabschnitt mit dem 3:1 durch Denis Malgin. Gottéron verlor erstmals seit dem 16. September (2:5 gegen Lugano) und nach acht Siegen hintereinander wieder ein Heimspiel. Das Verfolgerduell gewann der EV Zug (3.) in Bern gegen den SCB mit 2:1 nach Penaltyschiessen. Durch diese Ergebnisse rückten die Top 3 in der Tabelle näher zusammen. Gottéron bleibt Leader drei Punkte vor den ZSC Lions und sechs Zähler vor Zug, bestritt bislang aber eine Partie mehr als die beiden Verfolger. Vorerst gestoppt wurde die Aufholjagd des HC Lugano. Nach sechs Siegen de suite verloren die Luganesi in der Resega gegen Lausanne mit 3:4. Packend verlief die Partie in der Gotthard-Arena. Ambri-Piotta gewann gegen die SCL Tigers mit 2:1 nach Verlängerung, nachdem ihnen in der regulären Spielzeit der Ausgleich erst 0,2 Sekunden vor Schluss gelungen war. Der EHC Kloten besiegte die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers 2:1; Davos setzte sich gegen Biel 3:2 durch. Bayern München setzt sich nach einem verrückten Spiel mindestens bis am Sonntag an die Spitze der Bundesliga. Bei der Rückkehr von Manuel Neuer gewinnt der Meister dank acht Toren in der zweiten Halbzeit mit 8:0. Erstmals seit zehn Monaten spielte Bayern München wieder mit dem Manuel Neuer im Tor. Der lange Zeit wegen der Folgen eines Skiunfalls fehlende 37-Jährige erlebte eine turbulente erste Halbzeit. Nach weniger als fünf Minuten flog Teamkollege Joshua Kimmich wegen einer Notbremse vom Platz. Noch vor der Pause folgten ihm allerdings auch zwei Darmstädter - Klaus Gjasula und der Ex-St. Galler Matej Maglica - wegen der gleichen Vergehen vorzeitig in die Kabine. In Unterzahl konnten sich die Darmstädter nicht mehr schadlos halten. Als Torschütze stach Harry Kane mit drei Treffern heraus. Besonders sehenswert war das 5:0, das Kane aus über 50 Metern mit einem Schuss ins erstaunlich verwaiste gegnerische Tor erzielte. Der Engländer hat nun bereits zwölfmal in der Bundesliga getroffen. Als Zweifach-Torschützen zeichneten sich bei den Münchnern Jamal Musiala und Leroy Sané aus. Einen wichtigen Sieg feierte Borussia Mönchengladbach. Die schlecht in die Saison gestartete Mannschaft von Gerardo Seoane feierte mit dem 2:1 gegen Heidenheim den ersten Heimsieg der Saison. Der wieder in Form gekommene Franzose Alassane Pléa traf zweimal. Für Urs Fischer gab es keinen erlösenden Erfolg: Zum zehnten Mal in Folge verlor das vom Zürcher trainierte Union Berlin. Ein Eigentor von Robin Knoche stand am Ursprung der 0:2-Niederlage. Der zweite Gegentreffer fiel nach dem Platzverweis gegen Unions Rani Khedira (60.). Augsburg kam unter dem neuen dänischen Trainer Jess Thorup zu einem zweiten eindrücklichen Sieg. Eine Woche nach dem 5:2 in Heidenheim gewann das Team mit dem eingewechselten Ruben Vargas gegen Wolfsburg dank zwei späten Toren innerhalb von zwei Minuten 3:2. In der 79. führte ein Eigentor zum 2:2 und für den Siegtreffer war der Belgier Arne Engels verantwortlich. Der verletzte Kevin Mbabu bei Augsburg und der Reservist Cedric Zesiger bei Wolfsburg kamen nicht zum Einsatz. Die Diskussionen um den frühen Saisonstart und den Rennkalender gehen im alpinen Ski-Weltcup weiter. «Ich verstehe auch nicht, wer sich im Oktober für Skirennen interessiert und warum wir auf Gletschern ohne Schnee fahren», sagte Präsident Johan Eliasch vom Weltverband Fis in einem Beitrag des TV-Senders ORF. Er hoffe, dass der österreichische Verband für eine Verlegung der Rennen in Sölden nach hinten offen sei. Mit dem Riesenslalom der Frauen war auf dem Rettenbachferner am Samstag traditionell die neue Saison eröffnet worden. Die Aussagen des 61-jährigen Eliasch überraschen. Der ÖSV zeigt aber durchaus Bereitschaft, die Sölden-Klassiker noch etwas später im Jahr stattfinden zu lassen. Man habe sich dem Thema noch nie verschlossen und wolle gemeinsam mit der Fis nach der besten Lösung suchen, erklärte Verbandspräsidentin Roswitha Stadlober laut der österreichischen Presseagentur APA. Die öffentliche Kritik am frühen Saisonstart in Sölden wurde mit Blick auf die Klimakrise in den vergangenen Jahren immer lauter. Diese Saison fand er eine Woche später statt als vorigen Winter. Man werde den Auftakttermin erneut anpassen, sagte Fis-Generalsekretär Michel Vion beim traditionellen Eröffnungsevent am Freitag, bei dem Präsident Eliasch gefehlt hatte. Die Planung sei aber ein komplexes Thema, erklärte Vion. Jede Änderung habe Konsequenzen - und womöglich auch weniger Rennen zur Folge. Jan Kovar verletzte sich im Spiel gegen den HC Ambrì-Piotta vom Freitag, am Bein und konnte die Partie nicht zu Ende spielen. Weitere Untersuchungen haben ergeben, dass er 6-8 Wochen ausfallen wird. Der Tscheche hat in bisher 17 Saisonspielen für den EVZ 3 Tore erzielt und 14 Assists gegeben und kommt auf eine durchschnittliche Eiszeit von 17.5 Minuten. 🤕 Medical Update: Jan hat sich in der Partie gegen Ambrì-Piotta am Bein verletzt. Er wird dem 6-8 Wochen fehlen. 📰 Zur Medienmitteilung: Die neuen Wachs-Regeln im Ski-Weltcup sorgen überraschend schon im 1. Rennen für die 1. Disqualifikation. Die Fluor-Werte am Ski von waren zu hoch. Nairo Quintana kehrt in bekanntem Umfeld in den Rennbetrieb zurück. Der im letzten Jahr wegen eines «medizinischen Vergehens» nachträglich aus der Tour de France ausgeschlossene Kolumbianer fährt in der kommenden Saison wieder für das Team Movistar. Dem 33-jährigen Quintana war während der letzten Frankreich-Rundfahrt zweimal der Gebrauch von Tramadol nachgewiesen worden, was die nachträgliche Disqualifikation nach sich zog. Der Südamerikaner hatte im Schlussklassement Platz 6 belegt. Die Verwendung des Schmerzmittels wurde nicht als «Doping», sondern als «medizinisches Vergehen» betrachtet. Tramadol steht auf der Liste der verbotenen Substanzen des Internationalen Radsport-Verbandes (UCI), die Welt-Anti-Doping-Agentur (WADA) allerdings zieht mit dieser Einstufung erst auf die kommende Saison hin nach. Quintana hatte wenige Wochen nach dem Urteil seinen damaligen Arbeitgeber Arkéa-Samsic verlassen. Bei der Equipe Movistar stand er schon in den Jahren 2012 bis 2019 unter Vertrag. In dieser Zeit gewann er den Giro d’Italia (2014) und die Vuelta (2016). Die Atlanta Hawks verloren auch ihr zweites Spiel dieser NBA-Saison. Das Team mit Clint Capela unterlag zuhause den New York Knicks 120:126. Capela steuerte in einer ausgeglichenen Partie 13 Punkte bei und war mit 13 Rebounds in dieser Statistik ein weiteres Mal der Beste seiner Mannschaft. Andererseits war der Genfer mit minus 9 wie schon am Mittwoch bei der Auswärts-Niederlage gegen die Charlotte Hornets der Spieler mit der schlechtesten Plus-/Minus-Bilanz. Final score tonight England sichert sich an der Rugby-WM in Frankreich den 3. Platz. Die Briten gewinnen den «kleinen Final» gegen Argentinien 26:23. In dem ausgeglichenen Duell starteten die Engländer etwas besser und gingen mit einer 16:10-Führung in die Pause. Durch einen Versuch gleich zu Beginn der zweiten Halbzeit kämpften sich die Südamerikaner ins Spiel zurück, mussten sich in der dramatischen Schlussphase aber knapp geschlagen geben. Damit wurde England nach einem Weltmeistertitel (2003) und drei 2. Plätzen (1991, 2007, 2019) erstmals WM-Dritter. Im Final am Samstag (21.00 Uhr) treffen Titelverteidiger Südafrika und Neuseeland aufeinander. Der HC Fribourg-Gottéron ist der Gewinner der Runde vom Freitag in der National League. Dem Leader gelingt etwas, was sonst noch niemand diese Saison geschafft hat: Ein Auswärtssieg bei Meister Genf. Das Spitzenspiel zwischen Meister Genève-Servette und Leader Fribourg-Gottéron verlief packend. Fribourg zog durch Tore von Marcus Sörensen, Lucas Wallmark und Samuel Walser auf 3:0 davon. Servette holte diesen Rückstand indessen auf. Der Finne Sakari Manninen realisierte in den letzten sieben Minuten mit zwei Goals den Ausgleich. Am Ende siegte Freiburg doch noch - mit 4:3 nach Penaltyschiessen. Gottéron profitierte auch davon, dass die Verfolger leer ausgingen. Die ZSC Lions verloren gegen Lugano nach einer 1:0-Führung mit 1:3. Der EV Zug kassierte nach sechs Siegen de suite eine 2:3-Heimniederlage gegen den HC Ambri-Piotta. Gottéron baute so den Vorsprung in der Tabelle (mit einem Mehrspiel) auf sechs Punkte auf die ZSC Lions aus. Im Bereich des oberen Playoff-Strich besiegten die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers (8.) den Tabellennachbar HC Davos (7.) glückhaft mit 3:2 nach Verlängerung. Der Lausanne Hockey Club wahrte den Anschluss ans Tabellenmittelfeld mit einem 3:0-Heimerfolg über Kloten. Der 20-jährige Goalie Kevin Pasche kam in seinem allerersten Spiel in der National League zu einem Shutout. Der EHC Biel, Playoff-Finalist der letzten Saison, fand auch gegen Schlusslicht HC Ajoie noch nicht aus der Krise. Biel gewann zwar 4:3 nach Penaltyschiessen, Ajoie punktete aber zum dritten Mal hintereinander. Das Schweizer Nationalteam der Frauen verliert das dritte Spiel der Nations League 0:1 gegen Schweden. Magdalena Eriksson gelang für die WM-Dritten aus Skandinavien der einzige Treffer kurz vor der Pause. Für die Schweiz geht es am Dienstag mit der Partie in Zürich gegen Weltmeister Spanien weiter. Mehr dazu: Der Schweizer Tennisprofi Dominic Stricker scheitert an den Swiss Indoors in den Viertelfinals. Der 21-jährige Berner unterliegt dem Franzosen Ugo Humbert 4:6, 6:2, 2:6. Damit gehen die Halbfinals beim 500er-Turnier in Basel wie im letzten Jahr ohne Schweizer Beteiligung über die Bühne. Humbert, als Nummer 28 der Welt 68 Positionen vor Stricker klassiert, trifft am Samstag auf den als Nummer 4 gesetzten Polen Hubert Hurkacz. Mehr dazu: Der Franzose war im Duell zweier Linkshänder der erwartet unangenehme Gegner. Einen nervösen Start - Humbert führte 2:0 und 40:15 bei eigenem Aufschlag - konnte Stricker noch wettmachen, das Break zum 4:6 natürlich nicht mehr. Erstaunlicherweise drehte der Schweizer im zweiten Satz mächtig auf und dominierte seinen drei Jahre älteren Kontrahenten phasenweise klar. Humbert, der seine gute Form zuletzt mit Siegen gegen die Top-Ten-Spieler Stefanos Tsitsipas und Andrej Rublew und Viertelfinals bei den grossen Turnieren in Peking und Schanghai unter Beweis gestellt hatte, fand jedoch wieder in die Spur zurück. Er nahm Stricker im Entscheidungssatz gleich das erste Aufschlagspiel ab und vereitelte diesmal auch eine Chance des Berners zum sofortigen Re-Break. Nach knapp zwei Stunden und einem zweiten Break zum 6:2 behielt der Franzose im ersten Duell der beiden die Oberhand. Stricker muss sich nach seinem dritten verlorenen ATP-Viertelfinal - dem ersten seit gut zwei Jahren - allerdings keine grossen Vorwürfe machen. Er kam eine Runde weiter als im letzten Jahr und sicherte sich seinen Platz in den Top 100 der Weltrangliste wohl bis Ende Jahr. Damit dürfte er am Australian Open erstmals ohne Qualifikation im Hauptfeld eines Grand-Slam-Turniers stehen. Mehr als 20 Millionen Fans aus 206 Ländern haben in der ersten Bewerbungsphase Tickets für die Fussball-EM 2024 in Deutschland beantragt. Damit überstieg die Nachfrage deutlich das Angebot: Insgesamt standen im Zeitraum vom 3. bis 26. Oktober 1,2 Millionen Karten zur Verfügung. Die nächste Verkaufsphase startet nach der Endrundenauslosung am 2. Dezember. Insgesamt stehen 2,7 Millionen Eintrittskarten für die 51 Spiele in den zehn Stadien zum Verkauf. Die Uefa rechnet mit Erlösen von über 300 Millionen Euro aus dem Ticketgeschäft. Die Gesamteinnahmen der zweiten EM-Endrunde in Deutschland nach 1988 sollen sich auf 2,3 Milliarden belaufen. Mikaela Shiffrin gewann den von der internationalen Skijournalisten-Vereinigung vergebenen «Skieur d’Or» zum dritten Mal. Bereits 2017 und 2019 erhielt sie die Auszeichnung. Die 28-jährige Amerikanerin wusste mit dem Gewinn des Gesamtweltcups und dem WM-Titel im Riesenslalom zu überzeugen. Sie setzte sich bei der Wahl etwas überraschend gegen Marco Odermatt durch, der in der vergangenen Saison nicht nur den Gesamtweltcup mit der Rekordpunktzahl von 2042 für sich entschied, sondern auch zwei WM-Titel vorzuweisen hatte. Odermatt hatte den «Skieur d’Or» im Vorjahr als erster Schweizer seit Carlo Janka 2010 gewonnen. Rekordsieger mit vier Auszeichnungen sind der Schweizer Pirmin Zurbriggen und der Österreicher Marcel Hirscher. Die Schweizer Kunstturnerin Lena Bickel beendet das Wettkampfjahr 2023 wegen Muskelbeschwerden vorzeitig. Die 18-jährige Tessinerin, die vor wenigen Wochen an den Weltmeisterschaften in Antwerpen als Einzelathletin einen persönlichen Quotenplatz für die Olympischen Spiele gelöst hat, verpasst somit auch den Swiss Cup von übernächstem Sonntag in Zürich. Der frühere Fussball-Weltmeister Mesut Özil hat sich erneut klar mit Palästina solidarisiert. Der 34-Jährige teilte am Freitag bei Instagram sowie auf der Plattform X, vormals Twitter, ein Video aus dem Fanblock vom Champions-League-Spiel zwischen Celtic Glasgow und Atlético Madrid (2:2) vom Mittwoch. Auf den rund 70-sekündigen Aufnahmen ist zu sehen, wie viele Anhänger der Schotten auf den Tribünen mit Palästina-Flaggen den Fussball-Klassiker «You’ll never walk alone» singen. Dazu schrieb Özil: «Menschen in Palästina – ihr werdet nie alleine gehen. Respekt an die Fans von @CelticFC.» Dazu postete er selbst Herzen und die Flagge Palästinas. Die Vereinsführung von Celtic hatte sich von politischen Bekundungen der Fans distanziert. Vor einigen Tagen hatte der Ex-Nationalspieler Özil auch schon sein Bedauern über den Tod tausender Menschen in Israel und dem Gazastreifen ausgedrückt. Özil hatte in der Vergangenheit schon mehrfach mit politischen Statements für Aufsehen gesorgt. Im Dezember 2019 hatte sich der damalige Profi des FC Arsenal in den sozialen Medien kritisch zur Unterdrückung der Uiguren in China geäussert. Zudem hatten seine Fotos und seine Nähe zum umstrittenen türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan vor allem in Deutschland für Kritik gesorgt. Der Norweger Lucas Braathen tritt mit erst 23 Jahren per sofort zurück. Dies gibt der Slalomspezialist unmittelbar vor dem Weltcup-Auftakt in Sölden bekannt. Braathen hatte im vergangenen Winter trotz einer Blinddarm-Operation die kleine Kristallkugel als bester Slalomfahrer geholt. Er feierte zwei seiner fünf Weltcupsiege in der Schweiz: 2022 in Wengen und 2023 in Adelboden gewann er jeweils den Slalom. Der Rücktritt ist ein Paukenschlag, denn der junge Norweger zählte zu den aufsteigenden Stars bei den Alpinen. Der 23-Jährige begründet diesen Schritt mit der fehlenden Freiheit. Als Spitzensportler musste er auf viele andere Aspekte seines Lebens verzichten. «Damit ich in diesem System weiterfahren kann, muss ich nicht nur meine Träume aufschieben. Ich musste auch meine Freude aufschieben. Ich bin nicht mehr bereit, das zu tun», sagte er am Freitagmorgen in Sölden, wo er vor drei Jahren seinen ersten Weltcupsieg gefeiert hatte. Zu Braathens Rücktrittsentscheid beigetragen haben dürfte ein Streit mit dem norwegischen Skiverband NSF, der strenge Richtlinien im Sponsoring von Athleten hat. Braathen modelte für die Modemarke «J. Lindberg» und stiess damit offenbar den NSF vor den Kopf, der von «Helly Hansen» ausgestattet wird. Manuel Neuer wird einem Medienbericht zufolge nach mehr als zehn Monaten Verletzungspause sein Comeback beim FC Bayern München geben. Das berichtete am Freitag der TV-Sender Sky. Die Entscheidung habe Trainer Thomas Tuchel in Absprache mit Neuer und Torwarttrainer Michael Rechner getroffen. Der 37 Jahre alte Kapitän gehört demnach beim Bundesliga-Heimspiel am Samstag gegen den SV Darmstadt 98 wieder zum Kader des deutschen Fussball-Rekordmeisters und erhält direkt einen Platz in der Startelf. Letztmals stand Neuer am 12. November 2022 beim 2:0 auswärts gegen den FC Schalke im Münchner Tor. Der Weltmeister von 2014 hat sein bislang letztes Spiel beim frühen deutschen WM-Aus in Katar am 1. Dezember 2022 gegen Costa Rica bestritten. Im Anschluss an das Turnier hatte er sich bei einer Ski-Tour Schien- und Wadenbein am rechten Unterschenkel gebrochen. Seitdem arbeitete er an seinem Comeback. (dpa) Wegen verbotener Sportwetten ist Eishockey-Profi Shane Pinto vom NHL-Klub Ottawa Senators für 41 Spiele gesperrt worden. Er verpasst damit die Hälfte der Hauptrunde. Nach Angaben der nordamerikanischen Profiliga soll der 22-jährige Pinto nicht auf NHL-Spiele gesetzt haben. Es ist unklar, um welches Vergehen es sich handelt. NHL-Profis ist es erlaubt, Wetten in anderen Sportarten abzusetzen. «Shane ist ein geschätztes Mitglied unseres Eishockeyklubs. Ein engagierter, intelligenter junger Mann, der schlechte Entscheidungen getroffen hat. Wir wissen, dass er seine Fehler bereut», teilte die kanadische Franchise mit. Der Klub unterstütze «die Glücksspielregeln der NHL voll und ganz». Nino Niederreiter, der beste Schweizer NHL-Torschütze aller Zeiten, erhöhte die Rekordzahl auf 222 Treffer. Zum 4:1-Auswärtssieg mit den Winnipeg Jets über die Detroit Red Wings steuerte er ein Tor und einen Assist bei. Der 31-jährige Bündner musste bis zur Schlussminute warten, ehe er im siebten Spiel dieser Saison erstmals traf. Er schloss einen Gegenstoss mit einem Schuss aus dem Handgelenk ins leere Tor erfolgreich ab. Hinter der Schnapszahl von 222 Treffern steckt harte Arbeit, Ausdauer und viel Talent. Niederreiter bestritt schon als 16-Jähriger drei Playoff-Partien für den HC Davos, wechselte als 17-Jähriger nach Nordamerika und schoss als 18-Jähriger im Dress der New York Islanders im Oktober 2010 den ersten NHL-Treffer. Die Staatsanwaltschaft München hat am Donnerstag Räume des Deutschen Eishockey-Bundes und einer nicht explizit genannten Privatperson durchsuchen lassen. Das bestätigten die Behörde und der DEB auf Anfrage. Nähere Angaben zu den Hintergründen der Durchsuchungen machten weder der DEB noch die Staatsanwaltschaft. Offiziell unklar ist, gegen wen sich die Ermittlungen richten und wie der genaue Vorwurf lautet. «Bitte verstehen Sie, dass wir uns zu Details des Sachverhalts nicht weiter äussern werden», hiess es dazu vom DEB. Berichten des «Spiegel», des Bayerischen Rundfunks und der «Augsburger Allgemeinen» zufolge geht es um bereits in der Vergangenheit erhobene Vorwürfe im Zusammenhang mit der Vergabe von Übertragungs- und Werberechten. Bereits vor einigen Jahren hatte es Kritik einiger Eishockey-Landesverbände gegeben. Dabei ging es um Verhandlungen über TV-Verträge und die Vergabe von Medienrechten. Servette bleibt in der Gruppenphase der Europa League ohne Sieg. Nach den Niederlagen in den ersten beiden Spielen holte das Team von Trainer René Weiler auswärts gegen das zuvor ebenfalls punktelose Sheriff Tiraspol immerhin ein 1:1. Den Treffer für die Genfer zum 1:0 erzielte Enzo Crivelli (41.) Der FC Lugano kassiert in der Conference League im dritten Gruppenspiel die erste Niederlage. Das Team von Trainer Mattia Croci-Torti verliert in Zürich gegen den FC Brügge 1:3. «Meine Mannschaft wird gegen Brügge ein anderes Gesicht zeigen», versprach Croci-Torti nach der 1:2-Niederlage am Sonntag bei den Grasshoppers. Davon war in den ersten 45 Minuten nichts zu sehen. Der Auftritt von Lugano in der ersten Halbzeit passte zum regnerischen und kühlen Wetter. Die Tessiner zeigten nichts Erwärmendes, agierten in der Offensive mehr als harmlos. Einziger Torschütze für Lugano Shkelqim Vadi (74.). Für das Schweizer Nationalteam wirkt sich das überraschende 3:3-Remis in der EM-Qualifikation gegen Belarus nicht negativ auf die Platzierung in der FIFA-Weltrangliste aus. Die Mannschaft von Murat Yakin belegt unverändert den 14. Platz. Im zum zweitletzten Mal in diesem Jahr veröffentlichten Ranking verbleibt Weltmeister Argentinien an der Spitze, gefolgt von Frankreich, Brasilien, England und Belgien. In den Top 10 machten die für die EM 2024 qualifizierten Portugal (6.) und Spanien (8.) je zwei Positionen gut. EM-Gastgeber Deutschland wird im 16. Rang geführt. Nach dem verweigerten Handschlag mit Trainer Urs Fischer in der Champions League hat Fussball-Bundesligist Union Berlin Stürmer David Fofana für eine Woche suspendiert. Der 20-Jährige habe sich in einem persönlichen Gespräch mit Fischer und Geschäftsführer Oliver Ruhnert entschuldigt, dennoch werde er bis kommenden Mittwoch «individuell trainieren», sagte Pressesprecher Christian Arbeit. Bei der Niederlage gegen die SSC Neapel (0:1) war Fofana in der 70. Minute ausgewechselt worden und hatte Fischer ignoriert. «Es geht um das Team, es geht immer darum, wie man sich nach Entscheidungen verhält», sagte Fischer: «Fussball ist immer noch ein Teamsport, da muss man sich manchmal unterordnen. Ich hoffe, dass er aus solchen Situationen lernt.» Gegen den in einen Wettskandal verwickelten Newcastle-United-Profi Sandro Tonali ist vom italienischen Fussballverband FIGC eine zehnmonatige Sperre verhängt worden. Der 23-Jährige muss sich zudem einer mindestens sechsmonatigen Therapie zur Bekämpfung seiner Spielsucht unterziehen. Zudem wird er an 16 Vorträgen zum Thema Spielsucht teilnehmen müssen. Dies kündigte der italienische Verbandschef Gabriele Gravina an. Sollte der geständige Tonali diese Verpflichtungen nicht erfüllen, droht ihm eine Sperre von über drei Jahren. Der Newcastle-Spieler wird wohl die weiteren Spiele der laufenden Saison versäumen. Aufatmen bei Gianni Infantino: Das Strafverfahren gegen den Präsidenten des Fussball-Weltverbandes FIFA im sogenannten «Fall Lauber» ist eingestellt worden. Der Verdacht auf eine Instrumentalisierung der Bundesanwaltschaft habe sich im Verlauf der Untersuchung nicht erhärtet, teilten die beiden ausserordentlichen Bundesanwälte Ulrich Weder und Hans Maurer am Donnerstag mit. Der Tatverdacht sei entkräftet worden. «Das ist ein vollumfänglicher, deutlicher und klarer Sieg für mich, für die neue FIFA und für die Gerechtigkeit», sagte Infantino in einer Mitteilung: «Es ist jetzt allen klar, dass die Anschuldigungen gegen mich nur verzweifelte Versuche von armen, neidischen und korrupten Leuten waren, meinen Ruf anzugreifen. Falls diese Leute auch nur ein kleines bisschen Würde hätten, sollten sie zumindest den Anstand haben und sich für ihre Handlungen und den verursachten Schaden entschuldigen.» Trotz einer verrückten Aufholjagd verlieren die New Jersey Devils in der NHL das Heimspiel gegen die Washington Capitals 4:6. Timo Meier und Nico Hischier tragen als Torschützen zum Spektakel bei. Die Devils legten einen monumentalen Fehlstart hin und lagen nach knapp 18 Minuten schon 0:3 zurück. Der Schweizer Goalie Akira Schmid war nicht zu beneiden. Der Emmentaler liess drei von acht Schüssen passieren und wurde zur Pause durch Vitek Vanecek ersetzt. Mit dem Tschechen im Tor starteten die Devils im Mitteldrittel eine spektakuläre Aufholjagd. Mit drei Goals innert 131 Sekunden war der Rückstand bis zur 27. Minute wieder wettgemacht. Timo Meier und Captain Nico Hischier trafen zum 2:3 und 3:3. Washington glich zu Beginn des Schlussdrittels zum 4:4 aus, um nur knapp zwei Minuten später erneut in Führung zu gehen. Schliesslich sorgte Alexander Owetschkin zum 6:4 ins leere Tor für die definitive Entscheidung. Für die Devils war es die dritte aufeinanderfolgende Heimniederlage im vierten Heimspiel der Saison. Für die FIS Games 2028 interessieren sich neben St. Moritz zwei weitere Destinationen, wie der Internationale Ski-Verband per Communiqué vermeldet. Die Konkurrenten der Bündner gibt die FIS allerdings erst nach Ablauf der Bewerbungsfrist am 1. November bekannt. St. Moritz hatte seine Ambitionen bereits im Sommer öffentlich gemacht. Die FIS Games werden 2028 ihre Premiere feiern. Es handelt sich um Titelkämpfe, die künftig alle vier Jahre durchgeführt werden - und zwar in jenen Wintern, in denen keine Olympischen Winterspiele und keine Ski-Weltmeisterschaften stattfinden. Wettkämpfe sind dabei grundsätzlich in allen Ski-Sportarten (inklusive Telemark, Speed-Ski, Freeride, Para-Ski) geplant.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 08:15:00","image_url":"https://img.chmedia.ch/2023/11/08/be821adf-a7bb-4460-bdd0-4fafedc2f097.jpeg?width=200&height=200&fit=bound&quality=75&auto=webp&crop=1281,1281,x1070,y184","source_id":"bzbasel","source_priority":2730748,"country":["switzerland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"german"},{"article_id":"265685b47a852b8fc005ecfdc14aa2c2","title":"UCL: We’ll Have To Fight To Win –Ancelotti Speaks Ahead Real Madrid Vs Braga","link":"https://www.completesports.com/ucl-well-have-to-fight-to-win-ancelotti-speaks-ahead-real-madrid-vs-braga/","keywords":["UCL News","World Football","Ancelotti","Real Madrid","s Braga"],"creator":["Austin Akhilomen"],"video_url":null,"description":"Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti says his team would need to put up a fight to defeat Braga in their UEFA Champions League fixture on Wednesday, November 8 at the Santiago Bernabeu.

A poll of 1,000 kids aged 10 to 16 found cameras in footballs and underwater racing cars also ranked highly. 1 Kids are keen to see virtual reality added to sport While 85 per cent watch some form of sport, 25 per cent would be likely to view more if robots and computers were involved. Others are hoping the future will include devices that can fix broken bones and injuries in a flash, as well as boxing gloves that measure just how hard a punch is thrown. A spokesperson for Virgin Media O2 which is supporting BBC Children in Need with 5G connectivity across their national Hado eSport tour, said: \"Technological advances are unlocking new possibilities every day. “From VAR to Hawkeye, smart balls to wearable sensors, technology has already transformed sport in ways unimaginable a few decades back. \"While we’re someway from many of the out-there ideas young people dreamt up, cutting-edge 5G connectivity will help unlock new innovation in future. “It is clear from the research that children want to see more technology used and that it would have a positive impact on how much they watch and play their favourite sports.” Despite widespread controversy over the implementation of VAR and video technology in the modern game, football was the most popular sport to watch, with 64 per cent of the youngsters tuning in. Tennis (26 per cent) and rugby (24 per cent) claimed silver and bronze when it comes to most popular sports, while 15 per cent said they hadn’t watched any sport at all, either in person or on TV in the past year.

The idea of robot referees was popular as were cameras in smart footballs (both 41 per cent), while 17 per cent were taken with exoskeleton suits to protect athletes and 12 per cent fancied supplying basketball players with trampolines. Teleportation around the golf course to make the game quicker was a hit with an impatient 13 per cent and 14 per cent thought motorised swimsuits were a genius idea. The study, carried out via OnePoll.com, revealed that more than a third (35 per cent) of children said they watched sport a few times a week, seven per cent did so every day and 19 per cent once a week. Outside of school 45 per cent played football, 27 per cent went swimming, 15 per cent took part in athletics and nine per cent played rugby. More than a quarter (27 per cent) played some kind of sport in their free time on at least two days a week.

Despite four per cent saying the idea made them jealous, 11 per cent were happy at the thought. More than one in three (35 per cent) had played eSports or multiplayer video games, welcoming the potential to compete in virtual sports. FIFA was the favourite for 57 per cent of young people, followed by Fortnite (51 per cent) and Call of Duty (43 per cent).

Met Police are on 'high alert' as they fear more than a thousand football hooligans and far-Right thugs will descent on London during the pro-Palestine protests. A march calling for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza is planned for Remembered Day on Saturday. However, there is no march planned for Remembrance Sunday - but police are fearful heightened tensions could lead to violence between the two sides. One man who won't be in London is Marriner, who instead will be watching from afar. Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C £22 a month \"Save your energy, save it for next weekend, obviously every one is going to be in London,\" the notorious former Chelsea Headhunters man said, speaking from Thailand. \"I'd like to say I wish I could be there, do you know what, I do with I could be there, because I've had enough of all this b******: It's outrageous. \"It's about time that we stood together and we're united, you know what I mean. \"Everyone knows the code, next weekend, make it our stand against these terrorists, absolute dog slags - that's the bottom line and there ain't no in between. \"This is outrageous, if they want to disrupted that, I'm sorry, its got to go to a different level. Big respect to everyone that's going to go and show their respect, and, you know what, do what you've got to do.\" Marriner shot to notoriety when he was unveiled as Headhunters, a football firm, Top Boy in a documentary by Donal MacIntyre. MacIntyre was able to break into Marriner's inner circle, where he listened to sickening stories about Auschwitz and witnessed racism first-hand - with owner of a tyre-fitting firm, Marriner, who has now created a new life for himself in Thailand and opened his own ex-pat shop, throwing up Nazi salutes. Towards the end of the documentary, Marriner, and fellow Chelsea Headhunter Andy Frain, were preparing to ambush a peaceful march commemorating Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest moments during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, when 14 Catholics were shot dead. MacIntyre witnessed Marriner side-by-side with the leader of the neo-Nazi terrorist organisation Combat 18, but police were able to stop the yobs before any violence could break-out. Shortly after the documentary aired, Marriner was behind bars, and Judge Charles Byers said: \"It's clear to me that you relish violence and will stop at nothing to go anywhere in pursuit of it, showing little, if any, regard for other people or for the law.\" Marriner isn't the only football hooligan to call for action over the weekend, and one group, Football Lads Against Extremism, claims veterans have reached out and asked for their support \"due to the threat from the far left and pro-Palestine supporters to disrupt the Remembrance Day parade.\" They added: \"All football lads up and down the country to join us in standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans that fought for our freedom.\" This weekend, and will host games on Saturday, while and Chelsea are playing at home on Sunday.

Er kann die 3:6-Auswärtsniederlage der New Jersey Devils gegen die Colorado Avalanche aber nicht verhindern. Meier spielte seine Kaltblütigkeit im Powerplay aus, als er in der 32. Minute mit einem präzisen Handgelenkschuss aus kurzer Distanz zum 2:2-Ausgleich für New Jersey traf. Für den Appenzeller Stürmer war es im zwölften Saisonspiel das dritte Tor. Die Devils, die erneut ohne ihren Captain Nico Hischier und den ebenfalls verletzt ausfallenden Topskorer Jack Hughes antraten und im Schlussdrittel drei Gegentore hinnehmen mussten, stehen aktuell bei 7 Siegen und 5 Niederlagen. Nino Niederreiter mit den Winnipeg Jets (5:2 bei den St. Louis Blues) und Janis Moser mit den Arizona Coyotes (4:3 n.P. gegen die Seattle Kraken) erlebten mit ihren Teams einen erfolgreichen Abend. Für Roman Josi und die Nashville Predators setzte es beim 2:4 in Calgary hingegen eine Niederlage ab - die dritte im vierten aufeinanderfolgenden Auswärtsspiel. Die Mannschaft mit dem Berner Captain schliesst in der Nacht auf Freitag ihren zehntägigen «Road-Trip» nach Kanada mit dem Gastspiel in Winnipeg ab. Für Josi und Niederreiter ist es ein Duell unter Freunden und ehemaligen Teamkollegen. Titelverteidiger Manchester City hat vorzeitig das Achtelfinale der Champions League erreicht. Der englische Fussball-Meister setzte sich am Dienstagabend mit 3:0 (2:0) gegen die Young Boys Bern durch und ist damit nicht mehr von einem der ersten beiden Plätze der Gruppe G zu verdrängen. Erling Haaland (23./Foulelfmeter/52.) und Phil Foden (45.+1) erzielten gegen schwache Schweizer die Tore. Roter Stern Belgrad und die Young Boys bewegen sich in der Gruppe G weiter im Gleichschritt. Auch Serbiens Meister bezog mit einem 1:2 zuhause gegen RB Leipzig die dritte Niederlage. Zwischen Roter Stern und den Young Boys geht es in den letzten beiden Runden damit um den 3. Platz und das europäische Überwintern in der Europa League. Das zweite Direktduell steigt am 28. November in Bern. Die Begegnung in Belgrad war nach dem spätem Ausgleich des Heimteams 2:2 ausgegangen. In der Gruppe F mit Borussia Dortmund feierte AC Mailand gegen Paris St. Germain mit dem 2:1 (1:1) einen wichtigen «Dreier» und tat dem BVB einen Gefallen, Olivier Giroud (50.) war nach seinem Siegtor der gefeierte Held. Vor der Partie hatte es zwischen beiden Fan-Lagern massive Ausschreitungen gegeben, ein Paris-Anhänger war sogar niedergestochen worden. Viel Spannung an den letzten beiden Spieltagen verspricht auch die Gruppe E. Atletico Madrid hatte beim 6:0 (2:0) gegen Celtic Glasgow nach einer frühen Rote Karte für Daizen Maeda (23.) leichtes Spiel und übernahm die Tabellenführung mit acht Punkten. Dahinter lauert mit einem Punkt weniger Lazio Rom, das 1:0 (1:0) gegen Feyenoord Rotterdam (6 Punkte) gewann. Borussia Dortmund hat seine Achtelfinalchance in der Champions League durch den nächsten wichtigen Sieg erheblich verbessert. Der BVB gewann auch das Rückspiel gegen den englischen Vertreter Newcastle United am Dienstagabend mit 2:0 (1:0) und steht damit bei sieben Punkten. Niclas Füllkrug (26.) traf für die Borussia zur Führung, es war sein erstes Tor in der Königsklasse überhaupt. Julian Brandt (79.) sorgte für die Entscheidung. Viertes Spiel, erste Pleite: Der FC Barcelona hat in der Champions League völlig überraschend gegen Schachtar Donezk verloren. In Hamburg musste Barca ein verdientes 0:1 (0:1) einstecken und vergab damit die Chance, sich als erstes Team für das Achtelfinale zu qualifizieren. Stattdessen gewann Donezk erstmals seit drei Jahren ein «Heimspiel» in der Königsklasse. Angreifer Danylo Sikan (40.) traf vor 49.147 Zuschauern per Kopf für die Ukrainer, die nun sechs Punkte auf dem Konto haben und sich Hoffnungen auf die K.o.-Phase machen dürfen. Barca blieb mit neun Zählern zunächst Tabellenführer, der FC Porto spielte erst am Abend gegen Royal Antwerpen. Letztmals hatte Donezk am 1. Dezember 2020 «zu Hause» gewonnen - damals mit 2:0 gegen Real Madrid in Kiew. Nati-Trainer Murat Yakin trauert um seine Mutter. Wie der Schweizerische Fussballverband mitteilt, ist Emine Yakin am Montagabend im Spital in Basel im Kreise ihrer Familie verstorben. Sie wurde 89 Jahre alt. «Unsere Gedanken sind bei Murat und seiner Familie», so der SFV. Weltmeister Nils Stump muss die Saison vorzeitig beenden. Der Zürcher muss sich wegen einer komplexen Bänderverletzung an der linken Schulter operieren lassen. Das Missgeschick passierte vor wenigen Tagen an den Europameisterschaften in Montpellier bei Stumps überraschender Erstrunden-Niederlage gegen den Griechen Michail Tsoutlasvili. Die Länge der Rekonvaleszenz ist noch nicht bekannt. Bei normalem Heilungsverlauf sollte der Pechvogel im kommenden Frühling wieder einsatzbereit sein. Mit seinem Titelgewinn in der Klasse bis 73 kg im Mai in Frankreich hatte Stump ein Kapitel Schweizer Sportgeschichte geschrieben. Er wurde als erster Judoka unseres Landes Weltmeister. Der französische Fussball-Nationalspieler Eduardo Camavinga hat seinen bis 2027 laufenden Vertrag beim spanischen Rekordmeister Real Madrid vorzeitig um zwei Jahre bis 2029 verlängert. Das gaben die Königlichen am Dienstag bekannt. Der 20 Jahre alte zentrale Mittelfeldspieler, der von Trainer Carlo Ancelotti vielfach auch als Linksverteidiger eingesetzt wird, wechselte 2021 von seinem Jugendverein Stade Rennes in die spanische Hauptstadt. Seitdem absolvierte Camavinga 114 Spiele für Real, erzielte zwei Tore und legte fünf weitere auf. 2022 feierte er mit den Königlichen den Gewinn der spanischen Meisterschaft und der Champions League. Torhüter Joren van Pottelberghe wechselt innerhalb der National League auf die kommende Saison hin den Arbeitgeber. Der derzeit beim EHC Biel tätige Schweizer Internationale mit belgischen Wurzeln spielt in den kommenden drei Jahren für den HC Lugano. Der 26-jährige Van Pottelberghe, der beim EV Zug die Nachwuchsstufen durchlaufen und danach seine sportliche Entwicklung in Schweden bei Linköping vorangetrieben hat, hatte sich nach seiner Rückkehr in die Schweiz dem HC Davos angeschlossen. Russische Athleten werden bis auf Weiteres nicht an Wettbewerben des Weltskiverbandes Fis teilnehmen. Das sagte Michal Lamplot, Race-Direktor Langlauf beim Weltverband, am Dienstag beim Forum Nordicum der nordischen Skisportjournalisten im österreichischen Bad Mitterndorf. Natürlich wolle man immer die besten Athleten am Start haben. «Die Zeit ist aber noch nicht reif dafür», sagte Lamplot mit Blick auf den weiter andauernden Angriffskrieg Russlands in der Ukraine. Das Einzelfinale gewann Iga Swiatek klar 6:1, 6:0 gegen Jessica Pegula aus den USA. Die 22 Jahre alte Polin holte damit erstmals den Titel bei den WTA Finals und eroberte auch Position eins in der Weltrangliste zurück. Swiatek hat ihre letzten elf Tennis-Matches in diesem Jahr gewonnen. Tottenham Hotspur hat in der englischen Fussball-Meisterschaft durch seine erste Saisonniederlage die Rückeroberung der Tabellenspitze verpasst. In doppelter Unterzahl mussten sich die Spurs im Londoner Stadtduell mit dem FC Chelsea trotz einer frühen Führung noch mit 1:4 (1:1) geschlagen geben. Die Spurs liegen damit nun einen Punkt hinter Tabellenführer und Titelverteidiger Manchester City (am Samstag 6:1 gegen den AFC Bournemouth) nur noch auf dem zweiten Platz. Für die Spurs, zuvor die einzig noch unbesiegte Mannschaft der Premier League, begann die Begegnung durch den Führungstreffer von Dejan Kulusevski (6.) nach Plan. Doch der Platzverweis für Cristian Romero (33./grobes Foulspiel) nach einem wegen Abseits aberkannten Treffer von Ex-Bundesligaprofi Heung-Min Son leitete die Wende zugunsten der «Blues» ein. Denn nur zwei Minuten später glich Cole Palmer für die Gäste aus. Nachdem Tottenham zehn Minuten nach dem Seitenwechsel durch die Gelb-Rote Karte für Destiny Udogie (55./wiederholtes Foulspiel) weiter dezimiert worden war, leitete Nicolas Jackson (75.) Chelseas ersten Erfolg nach zuvor zwei Spielen ohne Sieg ein. Mit zwei Spielern weniger auf dem Feld bemühten sich die Hausherren in der Schlussphase vergeblich um den Ausgleich, kamen zu guten Chancen, doch erneut Jackson mit einem Doppelpack (90.+4/90.+8) sorgte für die Entscheidung. Nach zuletzt zwei Erstrunden-Niederlagen in Basel und Paris gewinnt Stan Wawrinka (ATP 53) seinen Auftaktmatch am ATP-250-Turnier von Metz problemlos. Er schlägt den Spanier Bernabe Zapata Mirallas (ATP 81) 6:0, 6:2. Der gut aufgelegte und sehr offensiv eingestellte Wawrinka begeisterte mit einem Blitzstart: Für den Gewinn des ersten Satzes benötigte er nur 18 Minuten und gab dabei lediglich fünf Punkte ab. Auch danach überzeugte der 38-Jährige mit wuchtigen Schlägen und zahlreichen Netzangriffen. Nach 52 Minuten verwertete er seinen zweiten Matchball. Im Achtelfinal trifft Wawrinka, der im letzten Jahr in Metz bis in den Halbfinal vorgestossen war, auf den jungen Franzosen Luca van Assche (ATP 76). Dieser musste gegen den Niederländer Botic van de Zandschulp (ATP 51) fast zwei Stunden länger als der Schweizer um den Sieg kämpfen (3:6, 6:3, 7:6). Der EV Zug hat Mike Künzle vom EHC Biel verpflichtet. Der 29-jährige Stürmer mit der Erfahrung von 24 Länderspielen unterschrieb bei den Zentralschweizern einen Vertrag über zwei Jahre. Künzle debütierte am 12. September 2013 bei den ZSC Lions in der höchsten Liga. Mit den Zürchern gewann er 2014 und 2018 den Meistertitel, ehe vor fünf Jahren zu Biel stiess. Nun entschied er sich für einen weiteren Wechsel. «Mike hat sich zu einem Powerstürmer mit Gardemassen entwickelt und ist im besten Eishockey-Alter», liess sich der Zuger Sportchef Reto Kläy zitieren. Der Thurgauer Golfprofi Joel Girrbach steigt erstmals in die grosse europäische Tour, die DP World Tour auf. Der 30-Jährige erreichte an dem mit 500’000 Euro dotierten Finalturnier der Challenge Tour den 7. Platz und verbesserte sich innerhalb der Challenge Tour auf den 17. Gesamtrang. Jeweils die besten 20 Spieler nach jeder Saison bekommen das Spielrecht für die nachfolgende Saison auf der grossen Tour. Denis Zakaria erzielt sein erste Tor in diesem Kalenderjahr. Der Schweizer Internationale trifft in der 11. Ligue-1-Runde beim 2:0-Heimsieg der AS Monaco gegen Brest zum 1:0. In der 16. Minute lenkte Zakaria einen Eckball des Russen Alexander Golowin mit dem Kopf ins Tor. Nach der Pause gelang dem formstarken Golowin das 2:0. Zakaria hatte seinen letzten Treffer vor etwas mehr als einem Jahr für den FC Chelsea in der Champions League gegen Dinamo Zagreb erzielt. Der Schweizer Nationalstürmer Xherdan Shaqiri trainiert ab Montag mit dem FC Lugano. Dies gegen die Luganesi in einer Medienmitteilung bekannt. Shaqiri's Saison in der amerikanischen Major Soccer League ist zu Ende. Er wird bis zu den entscheidenden EM-Qualispielen mit Lugano trainieren. «Danke FC Lugano. Ich freue mich, mich ab Montag wieder bei den Bianconeri auf die Nati vorzubereiten», wird der 32-Jährige zitiert. Der FC Basel kommt zum ersten Sieg seit Ende Juli in der Super League. Das erstmals in der Liga von Fabio Celestini betreute Team setzt sich daheim gegen Yverdon 2:1 durch. St. Gallen kommt zum ersten Auswärtssieg. Nach 415 Minuten beendete Aussenverteidiger Mohamed Dräger mit dem 1:0 die Durststrecke des FC Basel. Mehr als vier Spiele lang waren die Basler ohne Treffer geblieben. Den ersten Sieg seit Ende Juli bewerkstelligte aber erst Gabriel Sigua mit seinem Tor in der 85. Minute. Yverdon hatte mittel Handspenalty eine gute Viertelstunde vor Schluss ausgeglichen. Der FC St. Gallen verdiente sich den ersten Auswärtssieg in der Super League seit Februar mit vier Toren nach der Pause zum 5:2 bei Lausanne-Ouchy. Zwischen der 48. und 57. Minute trafen die Ostschweizer dreimal und machten aus dem 1:2 ein 4:2. Der Serbe Novak Djokovic gewinnt am Sonntagnachmittag im Final gegen den Bulgaren Grigor Dimitrov mit 6:4, 6:3. Nach 1:38 verwandelte der Serbe seinen ersten Matchball und siegte. Zuvor musste Djokovic ab dem Achtelfinal gegen den Niederländer Tallon Griekspoor, im Viertelfinal gegen den Titelverteidiger Holger Rune aus Dänemark sowie im Halbfinal gegen den Russen Andrej Rublew je drei Sätze spielen. Im Final reichten ihm zwei Sätze für den Sieg. Für Djokovic ist es im Turnier Paris-Bercy der 40. Masters-Sieg. Dank diesem Sieg kann er seine Führung auf der Weltrangliste weiter ausbauen und hat seine Rekordmarke weiter in die Höhe geschraubt. Hinter ihm liegt Rafael Nadal mit 36 Siegen und Roger Federer (28). Marcel Hug fuhr beim New York Marathon als erster durchs Ziel. Für den Thurgauer Rollstuhl-Leichathlet ist es das sechste Mal, als er diesen Marathon gewinnt. Doch nicht nur: Dieses Jahr gelang ihm alle sechs World Marathon Majors (Tokio, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago und New York) zu gewinnen. Das hat vor ihm noch niemand geschafft. Marcel Hug wins the 2023 and becomes the first person to win all six Abbott World Marathon Majors in one year. Neben Hug brillierten auch die Schweizer Frauen. Die Thurgauerin Catherine Debrunner fuhr mit einem Streckenrekord ins Ziel. Für sie ist es der erste New York Marathon. Hinter ihr erreichte Manuela Schär als Zweite das Ziel. Dem FC Luzern gelingt die Wiedergutmachung für die Blamage im Cup. Die Innerschweizer schlagen ihren Lieblingsgegner GC dank Teddy Okou und dem neuen, alten Captain Ardon Jashari mit 2:0. Elf Spiele und über 900 Spielminuten musste Okou auf seinen ersten Treffer in der Super League warten. In der letzten Saison hatte der Stürmer als Torschützenkönig mit seinen 19 Toren noch massgeblichen Anteil am Aufstieg von Lausanne-Ouchy gehabt. In Luzern war er in den ersten Monaten nur zweimal im Cup erfolgreich. Am Sonntagnachmittag gegen GC gelang Okou der kleine persönliche Befreiungsschlag. Von den Grasshoppers kam keine Reaktion. Nach dem 0:2 blieben die Zürcher, die seit 2014 nicht mehr in Luzern gewonnen haben, ohne nennenswerte Torchance. Das erste Team der Schweizer bildeten Anny Wu und Christian Baumann. Nach einem ersten guten Durchlauf lag das Duo auf dem zweiten Zwischenrang. Im zweiten Durchgang stürzten beide von ihren Geräten. So landeten sie am Schluss auf dem achten Rang. Noch schlechter erging es dem zweiten Team mit Florian Langenegger und Stefanie Siegenthaler. Sie beendeten den Swiss Cup auf dem letzten Platz. Brasilien bewirbt sich offiziell um die Austragung der Weltmeisterschaft der Fussballerinnen 2027 und tritt damit in Konkurrenz zu Deutschland. Eine von Präsident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva und Sportminister André Fufuca unterzeichnete Erklärung sei dem brasilianischen Nationalverband (CBF) und dem Weltverband FIFA übergeben worden, teilte die Regierung in der Nacht zum Sonntag mit. Die Erklärung werde von den sieben Regierungsgarantien begleitet, die die FIFA von Kandidatenländern verlange. Das südamerikanische Land wird damit Konkurrent von Deutschland, den Niederlanden und Belgien, die sich gemeinsam um die Ausrichtung des Turniers bewerben. Brasilien hat bisher zweimal (1950 und 2014) die Fussball-WM der Männer ausgerichtet. Auch Südafrika sowie das Duo USA und Mexiko, das gemeinsam mit Kanada bereits 2026 die Männer-WM austrägt, wollen sich bewerben. Eine Entscheidung soll am 17. Mai 2024 auf dem FIFA-Kongress in Bangkok fallen. Die Berner Ultracyclistin, überlegene Overall-Siegerin des Race Across America im Juni dieses Jahres, schafft in den USA erneut Ausserordentliches. Sie gewinnt Gold an den 24-Stunden- Weltmeisterschaften in Borrego Springs in Kalifornien. Die Physiotherapeutin aus Ittigen schaffte 725 km und erreichte auf dem flachen Rundkurs einen Stundenschnitt von 30,4 km/h. Im Gesamtklassement der Frauen und Männer reichte dies zu Platz 6. Noè Ponti überzeugte beim Meeting in Bozen mit einem Schweizer Rekord über 100 m Lagen. Der Tessiner schlug im 25-m-Becken nach 52,49 Sekunden an. Ponti fügte Jérémy Desplanches gleich eine doppelte Niederlage bei. Einerseits bezwang er bei seinem Sieg den Romand, der in diesem Rennen Dritter wurde, andererseits entriss er Desplanches den Schweizer Rekord aus dem Jahr 2017 um 34 Hundertstel. Ponti, der Olympia-Dritte von Tokio über 100 m Delfin, schwamm im Südtirol zudem zum Sieg über 50 m Delfin. Desplanches, der Olympia-Dritte über 200 m Lagen, stand über 50 m Brust als Zweiter auf dem Podest. Gleiches gelang Thierry Bollin über 100 m Rücken. Während Ambri-Piotta in der National League von Sieg zu Sieg fliegt, nimmt die Resultatkrise bei den Rapperswil-Jona Lakers kein Ende. Das sind die Fakten der Vollrunde vom Samstag. Im vierten Derby der Saison hat es für den EHC Biel endlich mit dem ersten Sieg gegen einen Kantonsrivalen geschafft. Kloten verpasste es nach dem überraschenden Derby-Heimsieg am Freitag gegen den ZSC nachzulegen. Beim 1:3 in Lugano schwammen den Gästen primär wegen defensiver Aussetzer früh die Felle davon. Zug gewann mit 3:2 nach Verlängerung auswärts gegen Genf-Servette auch das zweite Saisonduell zwischen den Meistern der letzten drei Jahre. Im Mittelpunkt stand mit Leon Muggli ein Youngster. Dem 17-jährigen Zuger Verteidiger gelang in der 3. Minute sein erstes Tor in der National League; sein drei Jahre älterer Bruder Tim liess sich dabei den zweiten Assist notieren. Der FC Zürich verliert erstmals in dieser Super-League-Saison. Durch das 0:2 daheim gegen das formstarke Servette muss der FCZ seine Tabellenführung an die Young Boys abgeben, die in Winterthur 4:1 gewinnen. Nach zwölf Spielen ohne Niederlage stand der FC Zürich gegen Servette auf verlorenem Posten. Die Genfer trafen durch Liga-Topskorer Chris Bedia (4.) und Steve Rouiller (63.) zum verdienten Sieg, dem fünften in Folge für das Team von René Weiler. Sébastien Buemi ist erneut Langstrecken-Weltmeister. Der 35-jährige Waadtländer und seine Toyota-Teamkollegen Brendon Hartley und Ryo Hirakawa liessen sich beim Saisonfinale in Bahrain nicht mehr von der Spitze der Gesamtwertung verdrängen. Das Trio wiederholte damit seinen Triumph aus dem Vorjahr. Wie es für Weltmeister gehört, beendete Buemi und Co. die Saison mit einem Sieg - dem zweiten im siebten Rennen (bei sechs Podestplätzen). Den 2. Platz im 8-Stunden-Rennen in Sakhir holten sich Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi und Jose Maria Lopez im anderen Toyota, die damit auch die WM-Wertung im 2. Rang abschlossen. Für Buemi ist es nach 2014, 2019 und 2022 bereits der vierte Titelgewinn in der Langstrecken-WM. Das sechste und letzte Sprintrennen dieser Formel-1-Saison wird zur Beute von Max Verstappen. Der Dominator im Red Bull triumphiert in São Paulo vor dem britischen Pole-Mann Lando Norris. Der aus der zweiten Position gestartete Verstappen übernahm im Autodromo José Carlos Pace noch vor der ersten Kurve die Spitze. «Das war wichtig, unmittelbar nach dem Start in Führung zu gehen. Danach war es eine Frage des Reifen-Managements. 24 Runden mit dem gleichen Satz sind sehr lang», sagte der 26-Jährige. Den Sieg brachte der bereits seit vier Wochen als Weltmeister feststehende Niederländer ohne grössere Mühe nach Hause. Tags zuvor im einzigen freien Training hatte sich sein Rennstall auf die Longruns konzentriert. Verstappen gewann zum siebten Mal ein Rennen über die verkürzte Distanz, zum vierten Mal in der laufenden Saison nach Spielberg, Francorchamps und Austin. Nach 24 Runden und gut 100 gefahrenen Kilometern betrug sein Vorsprung auf Norris im McLaren 4,3 Sekunden. Dritter wurde Verstappens Teamkollege Sergio Perez. Der Mexikaner war Ende April in Baku Sieger des ersten Sprintrennens der Saison geworden. Einmal mehr ohne Punkte blieben die Fahrer des Teams Alfa Romeo. Für den Chinesen Zhou Guanyu resultierte von Startplatz 18 der 17. Rang. Der aus Position 14 losgefahrene Finne Valtteri Bottas musste sich mit dem 19. Platz begnügen. Am Sonntag startet beim Grand Prix von Brasilien der 16-fache Saisonsieger Verstappen aus der Pole-Position. Neben dem dreifachen Weltmeister steht der Monegasse Charles Leclerc in der ersten Reihe. Der Start zum drittletzten Rennen des Jahres erfolgt um 18.00 Uhr Schweizer Zeit. Die 21-jährige Bernerin Ditaji Kambundji und der 25-jährige Baselbieter Jason Joseph wurden zu den Schweizer Leichtathleten des Jahres erkoren. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer Abstimmung von über 5000 Personen und einer elfköpfigen Fachjury. Die beiden Hürdenstars wurden am Samstag an der Swiss Athletics Night in Bern geehrt. Die Young Boys finden in der 13. Runde der Super League zurück zum Siegen. Die Berner gewinnen in Winterthur mit 4:1. Lausanne-Sport gelingt derweil die Revanche gegen Lugano für das Cup-Out. Obwohl YB nach der Roten Karte gegen Sandro Lauper über eine halbe Stunde lang in Unterzahl spielen musste, kam der Meister nach zuletzt zwei Remis in der Liga zu einem deutlichen Sieg. Joël Monteiro und Filip Ugrinic vor dem Platzverweis sowie Loris Benito und Meschack Elia danach schossen die Tore. Die zu wenig effizienten Winterthurer waren früh 1:0 in Führung gegangen. Lausanne-Sport gewann dank Toren von Samuel Kalu (71.), Brighton Labeau (80.) und Dominik Schwizer (94.) gegen Lugano daheim mit 3:1. Lugano, vor wenigen Tagen im Cup-Achtelfinal im gleichen Duell noch 4:0-Sieger, hatte kurz nach dem 0:1 durch Jonathan Sabbatini ausgeglichen. Die Tessiner spielten in den letzten 20 Minuten nach dem Platzverweis gegen Martim Marques nur noch zu zehnt. Die Schweizer Handball-Nationalmannschaft verliert beim Vierländerturnier in Tunesien auch das dritte Spiel. Zum Abschluss unterliegt das Team von Michael Suter Österreich mit 27:32. Das Spiel in Hammamet war lange umkämpft. In den Startminuten legten die Schweizer stets vor. Zur Pause lagen allerdings die Österreicher in Führung. In der zweiten Halbzeit konnten die Schweizer das Blatt noch einmal wenden, führten 21:20 und 23:22. Zum Sieg reichte es dennoch nicht. In der Schlussphase agierte Österreich cleverer und konnte das Skore gar noch deutlich gestalten. Während Österreich das Turnier in Tunesien mit zwei Siegen und einem Unentschieden gewann, beendete es die Schweiz nach der dritten Niederlage - am Donnerstag unterlag man dem Gastgeber 22:31 und am Freitag Portugal 26:29 - auf dem letzten Platz. Im Hinblick auf die am 10. Januar beginnende Europameisterschaft in Deutschland bleibt noch viel zu tun. Die Schweiz eröffnet das Turnier gegen den Gastgeber im Düsseldorfer Fussballstadion vor einer Weltrekord-Kulisse. Über 53’000 Tickets sind bereits verkauft. Im Vorfeld bestreitet die Nationalmannschaft noch den Yellow Cup vom 4. bis 6. Januar. Gegner in Winterthur sind Argentinien, Rumänien und Bosnien. Martina Voss-Tecklenburg kehrt wie erwartet nicht mehr als Nationaltrainerin der deutschen Fussballerinnen zurück. Der Vertrag mit der zuletzt pausierenden 55-Jährigen wurde aufgelöst. Die Deutsche, die zwischen 2012 und 2018 das Schweizer Nationalteam der Frauen betreut hatte, liess sich nach der enttäuschend verlaufenen WM in Australien und Neuseeland im August zunächst auf unbestimmte Zeit krankschreiben lassen, danach weilte sie in den Ferien. In einem Gespräch mit Martina Voss-Tecklenburg am Freitag kam der Verband nun zum Schluss, dass das Team einen personellen Neuanfang in der sportlichen Führung benötigt. Die Nachfolge ist noch nicht geklärt, derzeit betreut der 72-jährige Horst Hrubesch die Mannschaft interimistisch. Alexander Zverev und Holger Rune dürfen bei den ATP-Finals aufschlagen. Insbesondere der Deutsche profitierte von den Niederlagen gleich mehrerer Kontrahenten beim Masters-1000-Turnier in Paris. Der Olympiasieger krönt mit den ATP-Finals seine Comeback-Saison nach einer schweren Knöchelverletzung. Nach seinem Achtelfinal-Aus in Paris-Bercy musste er mit Blick auf die ATP-Finals, die am 12. November in Turin starten, zittern. Doch der 26-jährige Deutsche profitierte davon, dass der Pole Hubert Hurkacz und der von Boris Becker trainierte Rune ihre Viertelfinals verloren. Nach den Entwicklungen in Paris wird Rune, der Vorjahressieger beim Turnier an der Seine, trotz der Viertelfinal-Niederlage gegen Novak Djokovic bei den ATP-Finals spielen. Für den Saisonabschluss auf der Tour qualifizieren sich die Top 8 dieser Saison. Das Feld steht nun fest. Vor Zverev und Rune hatten schon Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medwedew, Jannik Sinner, Andrej Rublew und Stefanos Tsitsipas das Ticket gelöst. Seit über zwei Jahren hatte Ambri-Piotta in der heimischen Gottardo Arena nicht mehr gegen Lugano gewonnen und überhaupt nur einmal in den letzten acht Derby-Heimspielen. In einem Offensivspektakel setzten sich die formstarken Leventiner diesmal 5:4 durch und feierten erstmals in dieser Saison vier Siege in Folge. Floran Douay erzielte sein erster Tor im Ambri-Dress, Nando Eggenberger und Tommaso De Luca jeweils ihr zweites. Lugano, das zum dritten Mal in Serie verlor, reichte auch ein Hattrick des Kanadiers Michael Joly nicht. Nach vier Derbys ohne einen Punkt gewann der EHC Kloten mit einem 4:2 wieder einmal ein Derby gegen die ZSC Lions. Sie vermasselten dem grossen Rivalen damit nicht nur den Sprung an die Tabellenspitze, sondern schafften auch den Anschluss an den unteren Playoff-Strich. Es war erst der zweite Sieg in den letzten sieben Partien für das letztjährige Überraschungsteam. Der Kanadier Tyler Morley traf in der 48. Minute zum Siegtor - in Überzahl für das zweitschlechteste Powerplay der Liga. Zudem kehrte der Verteidiger und NHL-Erstrundendraft David Reinbacher nach 16 Spielen Verletzungspause zurück. Zwei Tore hatte Sean Malone in den ersten 18 Saisonspielen für die SCL Tigers erzielt, im kleinen Berner Derby schoss der Amerikaner den weiterhin arg ersatzgeschwächten Playoff-Finalisten Biel fast im Alleingang ab. Malone traf früh zum 1:0 und machte nach dem Ausgleich mit den Toren zum 2:1 und 3:1 seinen ersten Hattrick auf Schweizer Eis perfekt. Während die Langnauer erstmals seit Anfang Oktober zwei Siege in Folge feierten, hat Biel seit dem 23. September (3:0 gegen Davos) nicht mehr drei Punkte geholt und auswärts zum achten Mal in Folge verloren. Das abgeschlagene Schlusslicht Ajoie war für den SC Bern der ideale Gegner, um nach zwei Niederlagen zurück in die Spur zu finden. Allerdings verspielten die Berner einen Punkt auf fahrlässige Art, indem sie die Jurassier in den letzten sieben Minuten vom 3:1 auf 3:3 herankommen liessen. Ärgern muss sich aber auch Ajoie: In der Verlängerung kassierten sie eine Strafe wegen zu vielen Spielern auf dem Eis, was Corban Knight zum Siegtreffer nutzte. Negative Neuigkeiten gab es für den SCB hingegen auf der Goalieposition. Die Nummer 2 Philip Wüthrich fällt mit einer nicht näher definierten Verletzung rund zwei Monate aus. Die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers stecken in einem veritablen Tief. Das 2:4 gegen Genève-Servette war die achte Niederlage in den letzten zehn Spielen. Die St. Galler sind damit auf den 11. Platz abgerutscht. Der Meister aus Genf kehrte nach zwei Heimniederlagen zum Siegen zurück. Nach der deutlichen Auftaktniederlage beim Vierländerturnier in Tunesien gegen den Gastgeber verliert das Schweizer Nationalteam auch die zweite Partie. Gegen Portugal setzt es eine vermeidbare 26:29-Niederlage ab. Vor allem in der Defensive zeigte sich das Team von Nationalcoach Michael Suter im Vergleich zum Spiel gegen Tunesien stark verbessert. Nach einem schlechten Start fingen sich die Schweizer und rissen die Führung dank einem Vier-Tore-Lauf an sich. Mit einem Zwei-Tore-Polster ging es in die Pause. Die Partie blieb auch nach dem Seitenwechsel äusserst umkämpft. Der erneut starke Goalie Nikola Portner, der 14 Paraden zeigte, hielt sein Team lange im Spiel. Trotz 25:23-Führung kurz vor dem Ende mussten sich die Schweizer mit 26:29 geschlagen geben. Bester Werfer war Kreisspieler Lukas Laube mit sechs Toren. Der Kreisläufer des TVB Stuttgart musste rund zehn Minuten vor Schluss mit Rot und der dritten Zweiminutenstrafe frühzeitig vom Feld. Für die Schweiz geht das Vierländerturnier am Samstag (14.30 Uhr) mit dem Spiel gegen Österreich zu Ende. Jeanine Gmelin kehrt in den Profi-Rudersport zurück. Die 33-jährige Zürcherin hatte zu Beginn des Jahres ihren Rücktritt erklärt, nachdem ihr Trainer und Lebenspartner Robin Dowell auf einer Trainingsfahrt unerwartet verstarb. Nun steigt sie wieder ins Boot. «Paris 2024 ist mein Ziel. Diese Entscheidung ist über Monate gereift und war nur möglich dank des Supports und der Wertschätzung, die mir mein Umfeld, meine Partnerinnen und Partner entgegengebracht haben», so Gmelin in einer Mitteilung. Als erstes wolle sie nun wieder ihren Kaderstatus erkämpfen und verbandsinterne Leistungstests bestehen. Gmelin feierte 2017 ihren grössten Erfolg, als sie Weltmeisterin im Skiff wurde. Der ehemalige Velo-Profi Michael Schär bleibt dem Radsport erhalten. Der 37-jährige Luzerner, der nach 18 Jahre als Profi zum Ende dieser Saison zurückgetreten war, wird Sportdirektor. Er wird seine Erfahrung bei der amerikanischen Equipe von Lidl-Trek einbringen. «Der Radsport ist meine Welt und ich möchte ihm verbunden bleiben», sagte Schär bei der Rücktrittsverkündung im Mai. Nun ist klar, wo er seine Laufbahn fortsetzt. Die Uefa wird ab 2024 gemeinsam mit dem französischen Medienkonzern Groupe Amaury den prestigeträchtigen Ballon d’Or organisieren. Das teilte die Europäische Fussball-Union am Freitag mit. Der Ballon d’Or wird seit 1956 jährlich durch die zur Groupe Amaury gehörende Fachzeitschrift «France Football» vergeben. Am vergangenen Montag war Argentiniens Weltmeister Lionel Messi zum achten Mal mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet worden. Die Groupe Amaury werde Eigentümerin der Marke bleiben und das unveränderte Abstimmungsverhalten weiter überwachen. «Die Uefa wird ihre Fussballexpertise einbringen, die weltweiten kommerziellen Rechte vermarkten und die jährliche Galaveranstaltung organisieren», teilte der Verband mit. Zudem werden zwei neue Auszeichnungen mit ins Programm aufgenommen: Gewählt werden ab 2024 auch die Trainerin und der Trainer des Jahres. Der Ballon d’Or ist kein Ersatz für die Weltfussballer-Wahl. Diese Wahl wird weiterhin vom Weltverband Fifa veranstaltet. Von 2010 bis 2015 wurde der Weltfussballer durch eine Kooperation der Fifa und «France Football» mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet. Der kriselnde FC Basel muss vorerst ohne Innenverteidiger Adrian Barisic auskommen. Der 22-jährige Internationale aus Bosnien-Herzegowina musste am Mittwoch beim Sieg im Cup-Achtelfinal in Kriens mit einer Knieverletzung ausgewechselt werden. Medizinische Untersuchen führten zwar keine schwerwiegende Verletzung zu Tage, gemäss dem FCB wird Barisic dem Klub aber «wohl ein paar Wochen» fehlen. In der Super League stand Barisic in den letzten sieben Spielen durchgehend in der Startformation der am Tabellenende klassierten Basler. Belinda Bencic und ihr Freund und Fitnesscoach Martin Hromkovic erwarten ihr erstes Kind. Die 26-jährige Ostschweizerin verkündete die frohe Botschaft auf Instagram: «Wir erwarten unser kleines Wunder», schrieb die Olympiasiegerin. Die Tennisspielerin ist seit 2018 mit dem 41-jährigen Slowaken Hromkovic liiert. Zu den Zukunftsplänen der Weltnummer 14 war zunächst nichts bekannt. Klar ist, dass sie kommende Woche beim in Sevilla steigenden Billie Jean King Cup im Schweizer Aufgebot steht. Ob sie dann auch zum Einsatz kommt, ist noch offen. Die 26-Jährige stand letztmals am 11. September in San Diego auf dem Platz. Aufgrund einer Lebensmittelvergiftung musste sie danach pausieren. Mit Roman Josi, Timo Meier und Pius Suter reihen sich in der Nacht auf Freitag in der NHL gleich drei Schweizer unter die Torschützen ein. Trotz dem zweiten Saisongoal von Roman Josi verloren die Nashville Predators ihr Auswärtsspiel gegen die Seattle Kraken 2:4. Der Berner Verteidiger erzielte in der 37. Minute mit einer schönen Direktabnahme im Powerplay den 2:2-Ausgleich. Nur 24 Sekunden später ging Seattle jedoch erneut in Führung und brachte diese über die Zeit. Auch Timo Meier in Diensten der New Jersey Devils traf in Überzahl und ebenfalls zum zweiten Mal in dieser Saison. Das 3:0 des Appenzellers beim 5:3-Auswärtssieg gegen die Minnesota Wild war wegweisend. Für die Devils war es der fünfte Sieg aus den letzten sechs Spielen. Während bei New Jersey Jesper Bratt mit vier Skorerpunkten (davon 1 Tor) glänzte, fehlte Captain Nico Hischier weiterhin verletzt.Pius Suter traf in seinem neunten Spiel für die Vancouver Canucks zum ersten Mal. Mit dem Tor zum 8:0 in der 38. Minute trug der Zürcher Drittlinien-Center beim 10:1-Kantersieg seines Teams auswärts gegen die desolat auftretenden San Jose Sharks zum Spektakel bei. Vancouvers Captain Quinn Hughes überzeugte mit einem Tor und vier Assists. Derweil bleiben die Sharks als einziges Team der Liga ohne Sieg. Der Regen machte am Donnerstag in Cancun, dem Schauplatz der WTA Finals, einen Strich durch die Rechnung. Das entscheidende Duell in der Gruppe A zwischen Aryna Sabalenka und Elena Rybakina konnte nicht zu Ende gespielt werden. Sabalenka, die Nummer 1 der Welt, lag nach gewonnenem Startsatz (6:2) im zweiten Durchgang bei Aufschlag Rybakina 3:5 hinten, als der Match abgebrochen werden musste. Die Siegerin dieses Duells wird den 2. Platz in der Gruppe belegen und das Ticket für die Halbfinals erhalten. Die Partie soll am späten Freitagnachmittag mexikanischer Zeit fortgesetzt werden. Jessica Pegula (ATP 5), die nach Siegen gegen die Belarussin und die Kasachin als Gruppensiegerin feststand, liess sich im ersten Einzelspiel des Tages nicht lange bitten. Die Amerikanerin besiegte die Griechin Maria Sakkari (WTA 9) in 80 Minuten mit 6:3, 6:2 und beendete die Vorrunde ungeschlagen. Union Berlins Trainer Urs Fischer wird wegen seiner Roten Karte im Anschluss an das Ausscheiden im DFB-Pokal beim VfB Stuttgart für ein Cupspiel gesperrt. Der Schweizer hatte den Schiedsrichter Sascha Stegemann aus Ärger über einen Entscheid nach der Partie konfrontiert, nach eigener Aussage aber nicht beleidigt. Auf die Spiele in der Bundesliga hat die Sperre keine Auswirkungen. Die tunesische Tennisspielerin Ons Jabeur (WTA 7) möchte einen Teil ihres Preisgeldes von den WTA-Finals in Cancun den Menschen in Palästina spenden. «Es ist sehr hart, jeden Tag Kinder und Babys sterben zu sehen. Es ist herzzerreissend», so Jabeur. Die 29-Jährige betonte dabei, dass es sich nicht um ein politisches Statement handle. Sie wolle Frieden in dieser Welt. Das sagte die ehemalige Weltranglistenzweite, nachdem sie sich im zweiten Gruppenspiel gegen die Tschechin Marketa Vondrousova mit 6:4, 6:3 durchsetzte. Joe Thornton kehrt nach seinem vor wenigen Tagen offizialisierten Rücktritt erneut nach Davos zurück. Der 44-jährige Kanadier amtet als Co-Trainer des Teams Canada, das in der Altjahreswoche den Spengler Cup bestreitet. Thornton, der während der NHL-Lockouts von 2004 und 2012 sowie als Leihspieler 2020 für den HCD gespielt hat und mit einer Davoserin verheiratet ist, wird die Kanadier zusammen mit Brad Pascall betreuen, dem Assistenztrainer der Calgary Flames. Assistiert werden die beiden von Luganos Sportchef Hnat Domenichelli. Beim am 26. Dezember beginnenden Spengler Cup trifft das Team Canada vorerst auf die Gruppengegner Frölunda aus Schweden und Gastgeber Davos. Die andere Gruppe bilden Ambri-Piotta, Pardubice aus Tschechien und Kalpa Kuopio aus Finnland. Die serbische Fussball-Nationalmannschaft muss im abschliessenden Heimspiel in der EM-Qualifikation gegen Bulgarien am 19. November ohne Zuschauer auskommen. Wegen rassistischer Vorfälle beim letzten Heimspiel gegen Montenegro (3:1) bestraft die Uefa den Verband mit einem «Geisterspiel». Serbien kämpft in Gruppe G noch um die EM-Teilnahme. Derzeit liegt das Team hinter Ungarn auf dem 2. Platz. Gespielt wird am 27./ 28./ oder 29. Februar 2024. Der FC Bayern reibt sich am Drittligisten Saarbrücken auf. Bis in die Schlussphase ist die Partie offen. Dann der Schock für die Münchner Stars. Völlig bedient standen die Stars des FC Bayern auf dem Rasen, während die Aussenseiter des 1. FC Saarbrücken ihren Coup ausgelassen feierten. Der Münchner Fussball-Rekordsieger ist im DFB-Pokal schon wieder weit vor dem Finale gescheitert. Auf dem tiefen Boden des Ludwigsparkstadions verlor das Team von Thomas Tuchel am Mittwochabend bei dem Drittligisten mit 1:2 (1:1). Drei Tage vor dem Bundesliga-Kracher bei Borussia Dortmund taten sich die Bayern in dem wegen der vielen Regenfälle lange gefährdeten Zweitrundenspiel mehr als schwer. «Ich kann es nicht glauben, das ist Wahnsinn», sagte Saarbrückens Torwart Tim Schreiber. «Einfach geil!». Vor 16 000 Zuschauern traf erst Thomas Müller (16.) für die Bayern, Stürmerstar Harry Kane wurde von Tuchel geschont. Patrick Sontheimer (45.+1) glich noch vor der Pause für den Drittligisten aus - und dann schoss Marcel Gaus (90.+6) den Aussenseiter ins Glück. Eine Knieverletzung von Matthijs de Ligt trübte den Abend der Bayern zusätzlich, die den Pokal zuletzt 2020 gewonnen hatten. FC Rapperswil-Jona - YB 0:2 Black Stars - FC Winterthur 2:6 Servette FC - FC Stade-Lausanne-Ouchy 4:1 n.P. SC Kriens - FC Basel 0:1 FC Lausanne-Sport - FC Lugano 0:4 SR Delémont - FC Luzern 1:0 Der FC Basel setzte in Kriens, beim Ligakonkurrenten von Delémont, nicht zu einem spielerischen Feuerwerk an, aber schaffte die Hauptsache: Er traf endlich wieder einmal und gewann mit 1:0. Djordje Jovanovic verwertete mit dem Kopf eine Flanke von Dominik Schmid und beendete damit die Torflaute des FC Basel nach über 400 Minuten. Für Fabio Celestini, den Nachfolger von Heiko Vogel auf der FCB-Trainerbank, war es in gelungener Einstand. Die Young Boys erfüllten ohne zu brillieren, aber auch ohne zu zittern gegen Rapperswil-Jona mit dem 2:0 die Pflicht. Die St. Galler verpassten es daheim vor 3150 Zuschauern, in den ersten Minuten der zweiten Halbzeit einen Treffer zu erzielen. Der Klub aus der Promotion League liess gleich eine ganze Reihe von guten Chancen ungenutzt, einmal parierte YB-Keeper David von Ballmoos sehr stark. YB reagierte auf die Druckphase des Unterklassigen humorlos mit dem 2:0 von Saidy Janko (57.). Den ersten Treffer hatte Jean-Pierre Nsame schon in der 2. Minute erzielt. Auch der FC Winterthur wurde seiner Favoritenrolle gerecht. Die Zürcher gewannen beim Basler Erstligisten Black Stars unter anderem dank zweier Tore von Nishan Burkart mit 6:2. Bis in die 38. Minute hielten sich die Unterklassigen schadlos, dann kassierten sie bis kurz vor Schluss sechs Tore und schliesslich sorgten sie mit zwei Treffern in der Schlussphase noch für einen versöhnlichen Abschluss ihres ersten Cup-Achtelfinals der Vereinsgeschichte. Servette musste im Westschweizer Duell mit Lausanne-Ouchy trotz Überlegenheit das Penaltyschiessen abwarten, um zum ersten Mal seit 18 Jahren einen Super-League-Klub im Cup zu eliminieren. Lausanne-Ouchy konnte auf das 1:0 von Servette durch Topskorer Chris Bedia (73.) durch Mergim Qarri (84.) reagieren. Im Penaltyschiessen trafen alle Genfer, unter ihnen Bedia, aber nur ein Lausanner. In der ersten Halbzeit hatte der Servettien Jérémy Guillemenot noch einen Elfmeter verschossen. Das andere Achtelfinal-Duell zwischen Super-League-Klubs wurde zur klaren Angelegenheit: Lugano setzte sich bei Lausanne-Sport ohne Mühe mit 4:0 durch. Die Tessiner, Cupsieger 2022 und Finalist 2023, haben von den letzten 15 Partien im Cup nur das Endspiel der Vorsaison gegen YB verloren. In Lausanne kam den Luganesi entgegen, dass die Gastgeber schon ab der 5. Minute mit einem Spieler weniger auskommen musste. Raoul Giger sah für eine gefährliches Foul die Rote Karte. Lugano spielte danach routiniert und führte schon zur Pause mit 2:0. Renato Steffen brillierte als Vorbereiter von Shkelqim Vladis 1:0 und als Penalty-Torschütze zum 2:0. Der Meister Genève-Servette verliert nach und nach seinen Status als stärkste Heimmannschaft der neuen Saison. Die Genfer unterlagen am Mittwochabend gegen Davos 1:2. Dortmund und Leverkusen stehen nach Siegen über Hoffenheim respektive Sandhausen im Achtelfinal des deutschen Cups. Freiburg muss nach einer Heimpleite gegen Zweitligist Paderborn bereits in der 2. Runde die Segel streichen. Borussia Dortmund zog im Duell zweier Bundesligisten gegen Hoffenheim dank eines Treffers von Routinier Marco Reus in die Achtelfinals ein. Das Team von Gregor Kobel ist nach dem 1:0-Sieg und vor dem Gipfeltreffen vom Samstag gegen Bayern München saison- und wettbewerbsübergreifend seit 26 Heimspielen ungeschlagen. Erstaunlich viel Mühe bekundete Bundesliga-Leader Leverkusen beim 5:2 über Drittligist Sandhausen. Die auf mehreren Positionen rotierte «Werkself» musste in der zweiten Halbzeit zweimal den Ausgleich hinnehmen, ehe Nati-Captain Granit Xhaka ins Geschehen eingriff. Die Entscheidung führte der Favorit erst in den letzten fünf Minuten der Partie herbei. Eine herbe 1:3-Heimpleite kassierte Freiburg gegen Zweitligist Paderborn. Letztmals so früh ausgeschieden ist das Team von Trainer Christian Streich vor drei Jahren. Vergangene Saison stiessen die Breisgauer bis in den Halbfinal vor, 2022 standen sie gar im Final. Der Schweizer Nationaltrainer Patrick Fischer hat für den Karjala Cup vom 9. bis 12. November in Tampere in Finnland 26 Spieler aufgeboten. Dem Kader gehört mit dem Stürmer Marco Lehmann vom SC Bern ein Debütant an. Der Schweizer Tross reist zwecks optimaler Vorbereitung am Montag nach Finnland. Das erste Spiel bestreitet Fischers Equipe am Donnerstag gegen Finnland. Am Samstag und am Sonntag folgen die Partien gegen Schweden beziehungsweise Tschechien. «Zum Aufgebot gehört ein grosser Teil der letzten WM-Mannschaft», sagt Fischer. «Wir wollen den WM-Spirit wieder aufnehmen und dort weiterarbeiten, wo wir vor dem Sommer aufgehört haben.» Aus Rücksicht auf die Mannschaften, die in der Champions Hockey League mitspielen, hat der Coach auf verschiedene Spieler dieser Vereine verzichtet. Die SCL Tigers verpflichten den Center Joshua Fahrni vom Kantonsrivalen SC Bern. Der 21-Jährige, der bereits 128 Spiele in der National League absolviert hat und sechs Mal für die A-Nationalmannschaft auf dem Eis stand, unterschrieb bis in den Frühling 2026. Der EHC Kloten verstärkt sein Kader mit dem Kanadier Nathan Beaulieu. Die Verpflichtung des 30-jährigen Verteidigers erfolgt nur einen Tag nach dem Abgang des Schweden Lucas Ekestahl-Jonsson. Beaulieu, der einen bis Ende Saison gültigen Vertrag unterzeichnet hat, bringt grosse Erfahrung aus der NHL mit. In der weltbesten Liga hat er beinahe 500 Partien bestritten. Die letzte Saison hat er für die Anaheim Ducks gespielt. Die Schweizer Weltmeisterinnen reisen mit fünf Spielerinnen zum Finalturnier des Billie Jean King Cups von nächster Woche in Sevilla. Bereits am Donnerstag fliegt das Schweizer Team nach Spanien - mit dem Ziel, den Vorjahressieg zu wiederholen. Auch die zuletzt unter den Nachwehen einer Lebensmittelvergiftung leidende Belinda Bencic (WTA 14) ist dabei. Die Olympiasiegerin musste seit Mitte September pausieren. Weiter bot Captain Heinz Günthardt neben den bereits bekannten Viktorija Golubic (WTA 83), Jil Teichmann (WTA 142) und Debütantin Céline Naef (WTA 137) mit der letztjährigen Finalistin Simona Waltert (WTA 167) eine fünfte Spielerin auf. Die Schweiz startet am Dienstag gegen Tschechien ins Turnier, zwei Tage später folgt die zweite Partie in der Dreiergruppe gegen die USA. Nur der Sieger der Gruppe erreicht die Halbfinals. Die Schweizer Eishockey-Nationalmannschaft bekommt es an den Olympischen Spielen 2026 in Mailand voraussichtlich mit Rekord-Olympiasieger Kanada, Schweden und Gastgeber Italien zu tun. Die Gruppeneinteilung für die Vorrunde basiert auf der Annahme, dass Russland sowie das in der Qualifikation gesetzte Belarus 2026 zu den Winterspielen zugelassen sind. Sollten die beiden Nationen aufgrund des Angriffskrieges gegen die Ukraine vom olympischen Turnier ausgeschlossen werden, hat eine Neueinteilung zu erfolgen. Ein Entscheid des Weltverbandes IIHF über eine Teilnahme respektive einen Ausschluss von Russland und Belarus soll im Frühjahr 2024 fallen. Die Gruppeneinteilung für die Vorrunde erfolgt gemäss der Weltrangliste, in der die Schweiz den 7. Rang belegt. Die Top 8 sind für das Olympia-Turnier gesetzt. Die restlichen drei Plätze neben dem Gastgeber Italien werden im Spätsommer 2024 in Qualifikationsturnieren ermittelt. Bei einem Ausschluss Russlands würde die Slowakei als Weltranglisten-Neunte als Fix-Starter nachrücken. Das wegen des Nahost-Konfliktes verschobene EM-Qualifikationsspiel zwischen Israel und der Schweiz wird im ungarischen Felcsut stattfinden. Das entschied die UEFA in Absprache mit dem israelischen Verband. Felcsut ist 50 Kilometer von Budapest entfernt. Das Stadion, die vor knapp zehn Jahren eingeweihte Pancho Arena, zählt 4000 Plätze. Die ursprünglich für den 12. Oktober terminierte Partie was schon vor einiger Zeit auf Mittwoch, 15. November verschoben worden. Danach musste ein neuer Austragungsort gefunden werden, weil bis auf Weiteres keine internationalen Spiele in Israel durchgeführt werden. Mitte November wartet auf die Schweizer Nationalmannschaft ein dichtes Programm mit den EM-Qualifikationsspielen gegen Israel in Felcsut (15.11.), gegen Kosovo in Basel (18.11.) und zum Abschluss der Kampagne gegen Rumänien in Bukarest (21.11.). Der neue Trainer von Aufsteiger Yverdon heisst Alessandro Mangiarratti. Der 45-jährige Tessiner tritt die Nachfolge des am Montag entlassenen Marco Schällibum an. Mangiarratti wird am Donnerstag offiziell vorgestellt. Er werde die Spielerentwicklung zu einer seiner Hauptaufgaben machen, schrieb der Verein. Mangarriatti arbeitete zuletzt beim FC Vaduz, den er überraschend in die Gruppenphase der Conference League führte. Im November 2022 wurde er bei den Liechtensteinern entlassen. Yverdon belegt in der Super League mit 16 Punkten aus zwölf Partien den 8. Tabellenrang. Am Sonntag treffen die Waadtländer auswärts auf Basel, das ebenfalls in dieser Woche den Trainer gewechselt hat. Der EV Zug verpflichtet den Torhüter Tim Wolf. Der 31-Jährige wechselt auf die kommende Saison nach fünf Jahren beim HC Ajoie zu den Innerschweizern. Er unterschrieb einen Vertrag über zwei Jahre als Nummer 2 hinter dem siebenfachen Meistergoalie Leonardo Genoni. Mit der Verpflichtung von Wolf ist klar, dass Luca Hollenstein den EVZ verlassen wird. Er dürfte sich dem HC Davos anschliessen. Der FC Basel entlässt per sofort Heiko Vogel als Trainer. Zwei Tage nach der 3:0-Niederlage gegen Lausanne-Sport kam der Klub zum Entschluss den Trainer zu entlassen. Dies gab der Klub am Dienstagmorgen in einer Medienmitteilung bekannt. Die Nachfolge ist ebenfalls bereits geregelt: Für Vogel übernimmt der 48-jährige Fabio Celestini. Er war zuletzt bis im März 2023 beim FC Sion als Trainer angestellt. Künftig steht er beim FCB an der Seitenlinie. Australien wird sich nicht für die Fussball-Weltmeisterschaft der Männer 2034 bewerben und macht damit den Weg für Saudi-Arabien frei. «Wir haben die Möglichkeit geprüft, uns um die Ausrichtung der FIFA Fussball-WM zu bewerben, und sind nach Abwägung aller Faktoren zu dem Schluss gekommen, dies für den Wettbewerb 2034 nicht zu tun», teilte der australische Fussball-Verband FA am Dienstag mit. An diesem Dienstag läuft die Frist für eine Interessenbekundung beim Weltverband FIFA ab. Saudi-Arabien hat seine Absicht bereits klargemacht und gilt als klarer Favorit. Anfang Oktober hatte bereits die Asiatische Fussballkonföderation (AFC) eine saudische Bewerbung unterstützt. Nachdem dann über eine gemeinsame Bewerbung von Australien, Indonesien und Neuseeland oder von Australien, Indonesien, Malaysia und Singapur spekuliert worden war, bekundete Indonesien aber ebenfalls die Unterstützung für Saudi-Arabien. Dadurch sanken die ohnehin geringen Chancen der Australier gen Null. In der Erklärung des australischen Verbandes wurde Saudi-Arabien aber weder erwähnt noch die Bewerbung des Golfstaates unterstützt. Am zweiten Tag der WTA Finals im mexikanischen Cancun gab es zwei Favoritensiege. Die Polin Iga Swiatek (WTA 2) bezwang die tschechische Wimbledon-Siegerin Marketa Vondrousova (WTA 6) nach einem 2:5-Rückstand 7:6 (7:3), 6:0. Die amerikanische US-Open-Gewinnerin Coco Gauff (WTA 3) fertige die Tunesierin Ons Jabeur (WTA 7) 6:0, 6:1 ab. Es war für die 19-Jährige der 50. Sieg in dieser Saison. Am Mittwoch Ortszeit kommt es zum Duell zwischen Swiatek und Gauff. Stan Wawrinka (ATP 51) ist auch beim Masters-1000-Turnier in Paris in der ersten Runde ausgeschieden. Der 38-jährige Waadtländer unterlag dem Österreicher Dominic Thiem (ATP 108) nach 2:31 Stunden mit 6:3, 3:6, 5:7. Die Partie war erst um 2.22 Uhr morgens zu Ende. Wawrinka vergab im Duell zweier Sieger von Grand-Slam-Turnieren beim Stand von 5:3 und 40:30 im dritten Satz mit einem Doppelfehler einen Matchball. Überhaupt erlebt er einen schwierigen Herbst. Es war für ihn die vierte Erstrundenniederlage in den letzten fünf Turnieren, die zweite in Serie nach jener in Basel. Nächste Woche tritt er in Metz an, dort erreichte er im vergangenen Jahr die Halbfinals. Einen Tag nach dem Sieg in Milwaukee setzten sich die Atlanta Hawks mit Clint Capela in der NBA mit 127:113 auch gegen die Minnesota Timberwolves durch. Zur Halbzeit sah es noch danach aus, als würden die Hawks auch im dritten Heimspiel der Saison das Parkett als Verlierer verlassen, lagen sie doch 60:79 in Rückstand. Dann aber drehten die Gastgeber auf, womit sie nun mit je zwei Siegen und Niederlagen eine ausgeglichene Bilanz haben. Capela kam in den letzten knapp 17 Minuten des Spiels nicht mehr zum Einsatz. Er musste sich mit zwei Punkten und fünf Rebounds begnügen. Grossen Anteil am Sieg von Atlanta hatte Dejounte Murray, der mit 41 Zählern den persönlichen Punkterekord in der NBA egalisierte. Beim 125:110-Sieg der Dallas Mavericks bei den Memphis Grizzlies gelang Luka Doncic sein 58. Triple-Double in der besten Basketball-Liga der Welt. Der Slowene verzeichnete 35 Punkte sowie je zwölf Rebounds und Assists. Verteidiger Janis Moser feierte in der NHL mit den Arizona Coyotes einen 8:1-Kantersieg gegen die Chicago Blackhawks mit Philipp Kuraschew. Beide Schweizer blieben ohne Skorerpunkt. Michael Carcone (3 Tore/1 Assist) und Jack McBain (2/2) verzeichneten je vier Skorerpunkte. Das Tor für Chicago zum 1:0 erzielte nach 28 Sekunden der 18-jährige Connor Bedard, der in seinem neunten NHL-Spiel zum vierten Mal erfolgreich war. Nino Niederreiter verlor mit den Winnipeg Jets zu Hause gegen die New York Rangers 2:3 nach Verlängerung. Der Churer Stürmer trug sich nach vier Punkten in den vorangegangenen zwei Partien diesmal nicht in die Skorerliste ein. Das entscheidende Tor für die Gäste schoss Mika Zibanejad 26 Sekunden vor dem Ende der Verlängerung. Artemi Panarin, der für das 1:0 (19.) der Rangers verantwortlich zeichnete, hatte bei allen drei Toren seines Teams den Stock im Spiel. Titelverteidiger Vegas Golden Knights gelang im zehnten Saisonspiel der neunte Sieg - 3:2 nach Penaltyschiessen gegen die Montreal Canadiens. Auch die Boston Bruins haben nach dem 3:2 gegen die Florida Panthers weiterhin erst ein Spiel in der laufenden Meisterschaft (8 Erfolge) verloren. Der am Montag in Yverdon entlassene Marco Schällibaum wurde von der Swiss Football League für vier Spiele gesperrt. Der Zürcher büsst für sein Fehlverhalten im Heimspiel gegen Winterthur (1:1). Er habe die technische Zone verlassen mit der Absicht zu provozieren und aufzuhetzen, heisst es von Seiten der Liga. Zudem beleidigte er einen Spieler von Winterthur Lausannes Offensivspieler Chris Kablan wurde für drei Partien gesperrt, nachdem er im Heimspiel gegen Basel (3:0) kurz nach seiner Einwechslung in der Schlussphase die Rote Karten gesehen hatte. Er leistete sich ein grobes Foul mit hohem Verletzungsrisiko. Yverdons Christopher Lungoyi wird nebst der einen Sperre wegen zweier Gelber Karten gegen Winterthur womöglich weiter bestraft. Gegen den Flügelspieler wurde ein Verfahren eröffnet, weil er nach dem Schlusspfiff eine unangebrachte Geste in Richtung von Schiedsrichter Nico Gianforte machte. Der FSV Mainz 05 ermöglicht dem zunächst freigestellten Fussballprofi Anwar El Ghazi nun doch eine Rückkehr. Der 28 Jahre alte Holländer kehre zeitnah in den Trainings- und Spielbetrieb zurück, gab der Bundesligist am Montag bekannt. El Ghazi werde für die Veröffentlichung eines Beitrages in den sozialen Medien vor zwei Wochen abgemahnt. Die Mainzer hatten zunächst mit Härte auf einen inzwischen wieder gelöschten Pro-Palästina-Post von El Ghazi bei Instagram reagiert. «Vor dem Hintergrund des erfolgten Commitments El Ghazis und der von ihm gezeigten Reue, gebietet es die im Verein verankerte Kultur im Umgang mit Fehlern, dem Spieler eine Chance zur Rehabilitation einzuräumen», hiess es in einer Mitteilung der Mainzer. Das in dieser Saison noch sieglose Tabellenschlusslicht hat derzeit wegen diverser Ausfälle nur noch wenige Stürmer zur Verfügung. Der ehemalige Fussball-Profi John van ’t Schip soll den holländischen Tabellenletzten Ajax Amsterdam als neuer Trainer aus der Krise führen. Wie der Rekordmeister aus der Eredivisie am Montag mitteilte, erhält der 59-Jährige für diesen Job einen Vertrag bis zum Ende der laufenden Saison. Anschliessend soll er ein weiteres Jahr im Management von Ajax arbeiten. Van ’t Schip spielte von 1981 bis 1992 bereits für die Amsterdamer und begann nach seiner aktiven Karriere eine Laufbahn als Trainer. Amsterdam hatte sich in der Vorwoche nach dem schlechtesten Saisonstart der Vereinsgeschichte vom bisherigen Chefcoach Maurice Steijn getrennt. Zunächst hatte Steijns Assistent Hedwiges Maduro eine Woche als Trainer fungiert und wird nun wieder die Rolle als Co-Trainer übernehmen. Ajax verbuchte im Saisonverlauf in der höchsten Liga der Niederlande bislang erst einen Sieg und holte in acht Begegnungen lediglich fünf Punkte. Am Sonntag setzte es ein 2:5 bei Spitzenreiter PSV Eindhoven. Wie die welsche Zeitung «24 heures» berichtet, trennt sich der Super-League-Klub Yverdon von seinem Trainer Marco Schällibaum. Das ist überraschend. Schliesslich ist der 61-jährige Zürcher mit den Waadtländern in der vergangenen Saison überraschend aufgestiegen. Und selbst in der höchsten Spielklasse hat Yverdon bislang eher positiv überrascht. Obwohl als Aussenseiter angetreten, belegt Yverdon nach 12 Runden den achten Platz. Nach dem Kuss-Skandal hat die Fifa den ehemaligen spanischen Verbandspräsidenten Luis Rubiales für drei Jahre gesperrt. Durch die Entscheidung der Disziplinarkommission wird der 46-Jährige für jegliche Fussballtätigkeit auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene ausgeschlossen. Dies gab der Weltverband am Montag bekannt. Laut Fifa habe Rubiales mit seinem Verhalten bei der Siegerehrung des WM-Finals im August gegen Artikel 13 des Disziplinarreglements verstossen. Der Spanier hatte Nationalspielerin Jennifer Hermoso nach dem Endspielsieg gegen England in Sydney übergriffig auf den Mund geküsst. Der Fall löste weltweit einen Sturm der Entrüstung aus. Die Fifa hatte Rubiales zunächst provisorisch für 90 Tage suspendiert. Unter grossem Druck trat er erst nach einiger Zeit von seinem Posten als Chef des spanischen Verbandes RFEF zurück. Die Weltmeisterinnen um Hermoso waren zwischenzeitlich in den Streik getreten. Auch die spanischen Behörden beschäftigen sich mit dem Fall. Am Montag wird in Paris zum 67. Mal der Ballon d’Or vergeben. Bei den Männern läuft es wohl auf einen Zweikampf zwischen Lionel Messi und Erling Haaland hinaus. Messi könnte bei der Ehrung von seiner überragenden WM in Katar Ende vergangenen Jahres profitieren. Haaland war indes mit seinen vielen Toren massgeblich daran beteiligt, dass Manchester City erstmals die Champions League gewann und dazu auch die Meisterschaft und den FA Cup. Bei den Frauen darf sich die spanische Weltmeisterin Aitana Bonmati grosse Hoffnungen auf die Auszeichnung machen, die von der Fachzeitschrift France Football vergeben wird. e New Jersey Devils feiern in der NHL im achten Saisonspiel den fünften Sieg. Sie bezwingen zu Hause die Minnesota Wild 4:3. Timo Meier bereitete im Powerplay mit einem Querpass das 4:2 von Doppel-Torschütze Jesper Bratt vor. Der Appenzeller Stürmer punktete in der fünften Partie in Serie und hält nun bei sieben Skorerpunkten (ein Treffer) in der laufenden Meisterschaft. Verteidiger Jonas Siegenthaler erhielt bei New Jersey mit 21:40 Minuten am zweitmeisten Einsatzzeit und verliess das Eis mit einer Plus-1-Bilanz. Captain Nico Hischier fehlte den Devils wegen einer im Spiel zuvor gegen die Buffalo Sabres erlittenen Oberkörperverletzung, Goalie Akira Schmid war Ersatz. Die hoch gehandelten Edmonton Oilers kamen nach vier Niederlagen zum zweiten Saisonsieg. Evander Kane steuerte ein Tor und zwei Assists zum 5:2 vor heimischem Publikum gegen die Calgary Flames bei. Connor McDavid kehrte nach zwei verpassten Partien aufgrund einer Oberkörperverletzung in die Aufstellung zurück und liess sich einen Assist gutschreiben. Aryna Sabalenka, die Nummer 1 der Welt, startete mit einer Machtdemonstration in die WTA Finals in Cancun. Die 25-jährige Belarussin gewann in Mexiko gegen Maria Sakkari (WTA 9) die ersten elf Games, worauf die Griechin nach drei abgewehrten Matchbällen mit dem 1:5 immerhin ein «Velo» verhinderte. Die beiden trafen zum dritten Mal an den WTA Finals aufeinander, die ersten beiden Male siegte Sakkari. Im ersten Spiel des Turniers setzte sich Jessica Pegula (WTA 5) gegen die Kasachin Jelena Rybakina (WTA 4) 7:5, 6:2 durch. Nach dem 3:5 sicherte sich die Amerikanerin sechs Games in Serie. In der Gruppe B spielen Iga Swiatek (WTA 2), Coco Gauff (WTA 3), Marketa Vondrousova (WTA 6) sowie Ons Jabeur (WTA 7). Max Verstappen feierte im Grand Prix von Mexiko seinen 51. Sieg in der Formel 1. Der Niederländer im Red Bull wurde zum 16. Mal in dieser Saison als Erster abgewinkt und übertraf damit seinen Rekord aus dem Vorjahr. The records keep tumbling for An incredible 16th win of the season 🤩 Mit Verstappen aufs Podest stiegen Lewis Hamilton im Mercedes und Charles Leclerc im Ferrari. Für Lokalmatador Sergio Perez war das Heimrennen nach einer Startkollision mit Leclerc schon früh zu Ende. Valtteri Bottas und Zhou Guanyu in den Alfa Romeo belegten die Plätze 14 und 15. Paradiesvogel Peter Wright hat in Dortmund seinen zweiten Titel bei der Darts-Europameisterschaft gewonnen. Nach 2020 setzte sich der 53 Jahre alte Schotte nach einem 11:6-Finalsieg über Englands James Wade nun auch im Jahr 2023 durch. «Snakebite», wie der für seine bunten Kostüme und Frisuren bekannte Wright genannt wird, krönte am Sonntagabend ein starkes Turnier, bei dem er unter anderem Weltmeister Michael Smith aus England klar besiegte. Gegen den Deutschen Gabriel Clemens wäre er beim 6:5 in Runde eins beinahe ausgeschieden. WRIGHT IS THE EUROPEAN CHAMPION ONCE AGAIN 🏆🏆 Peter Wright is crowned the European Champion for the second time with victory over James Wade 👏🏻👏🏻 Der zweimalige Weltmeister Wright setzte sich in seinem Halloween-Outfit souverän durch und spielte ein dominantes Finale. Der bedeutende Major-Titel hilft Wright auch in der sogenannten Order of Merit, der Weltrangliste. Wright zieht mit den 120'000 Pfund am Niederländer Michael van Gerwen vorbei und übernimmt wieder den zweiten Platz im Ranking. Nur Weltmeister Smith hat noch mehr Preisgeld in den vergangenen zwei Jahren eingespielt. In gut sechs Wochen (15. Dezember bis 3. Januar) beginnt im Alexandra Palace von London die Weltmeisterschaft. Bei einem Angriff mit Steinen auf den Mannschaftsbus von Olympique Lyon vor dem Auswärtsspiel bei Olympique Marseille ist Trainer Fabio Grosso am Kopf getroffen und verletzt worden. Auf Fotos und Videos war am Sonntagabend zu sehen, wie der frühere italienische Fussball-Weltmeister blutend durch die Katakomben ging. Auch Lyons Co-Trainer Raffaele Longo soll verletzt worden sein, der Bus soll kurz vor Ankunft am Stadion mit Steinen beworfen worden sein. Eine Stellungnahme beider Vereine steht noch aus. Die Partie wurde abgesagt. Lokalmatador Sergio Perez ist beim Formel-1-Rennen in Mexiko nach einem Crash in der Auftaktrunde ausgeschieden. Der mexikanische Red-Bull-Pilot versuchte, Pole-Mann Charles Leclerc in der ersten Kurve übermotiviert aussen zu überholen. Dabei touchierten sich aber beide Wagen, der Red Bull von Perez hob mit drei Rädern sogar ab. Trümmerteile flogen anschliessend auf den Asphalt. Leclerc konnte das Rennen fortsetzen. DRAMA AT TURN 1!!! Perez and Leclerc make contact 💥 Perez limps on but he is out of the race ❌ Perez, dessen Zukunft bei Red Bull als Teamkollege von Weltmeister Max Verstappen weiter fraglich ist, fuhr indes an die Box. Die Crew konnte seinen beschädigten Wagen aber nicht mehr reparieren, bitter enttäuscht stieg der 33-Jährige aus dem Auto. Das Virtuelle Safety Car wurde vorübergehend eingesetzt. Der frühere Bundesliga-Profi Bas Dost ist am Sonntagabend beim Spiel seines niederländischen Klubs NEC Nijmegen bei AZ Alkmaar dramatisch kollabiert. Der 34-Jährige sackte in der Nachspielzeit ohne gegnerische Einwirkung im Mittelkreis zusammen und lag regungslos auf dem Rücken. Nach bangen Minuten der Erstversorgung teilte AZ mit, dass Dost bei Bewusstsein und ansprechbar sei. Das Spiel wurde nach dem Vorfall zunächst unterbrochen und dann abgebrochen. Torgarant Erling Haaland hat Manchester City zu einem souveränen Sieg im Derby beim Stadtrivalen United geführt. Mit einem Doppelpack sowie einer Torvorlage war der Norweger beim 3:0 (1:0) im Old Trafford der entscheidende Mann und baute seine Saisonbilanz auf elf Treffer in zehn Premier-League-Spielen aus. Mit 24 Punkten bleibt Champions-League-Sieger ManCity, der vier der jüngsten fünf Derbys gewonnen hat, als Tabellendritter dem Spitzenreiter Tottenham Hotspur (26) auf den Fersen, der FC Arsenal liegt punktgleich mit den Citizens auf Platz drei. Tottenham (2:1 am Freitag bei Crystal Palace) und Arsenal (5:0 am Samstag gegen Sheffield United) hatten bereits vorgelegt. Manchester United (15) ist nach der fünften Saisonniederlage Achter. Haaland, in der Vorsaison bei Citys 6:3-Heimgala gegen ManUnited gleich dreimal erfolgreich, traf zunächst in der 26. Spielminute per Foulelfmeter. In der zweiten Halbzeit schliesslich per Kopf (49.) nach einer Flanke von Bernardo Silva für die Mannschaft von Teammanager Pep Guardiola erfolgreich. Phil Foden (80.) traf dann nach Haaland-Vorlage zum 3:0. Der HC Ajoie verpflichtet mit Dmitro Timaschow einen achten Ausländer. Der schwedisch-ukrainische Angreifer unterschreibt vorerst für zwei Monate mit der Option, den Vertrag bis Ende der Saison zu verlängern. Zuletzt spielte der 27-Jährige, der 2015 von den Toronto Maple Leafs gedraftet wurde, sich in der NHL aber nie wirklich durchsetzen konnte, zwei Saisons für das schwedische Team Brynäs. Die Young Boys können nicht von Zürichs Ausrutscher profitieren. Nach Führung müssen sich die Berner in Lugano mit einem 1:1 begnügen. Derweil verliert Basel das Kellerduell gegen Lausanne-Sport gleich mit 0:3. Nachdem Filip Ugrinic die Gäste in der 60. Minute verdient in Führung gebracht hatte, schien YB nach Punkten zu Leader Zürich aufzuschliessen. Luganos Yanis Cimignani hatte jedoch etwas dagegen. Nach schönem Pass von Renato Steffen schlenzte der Franzose den Ball in der 78. Minute zum Ausgleich ins Netz. Damit bleiben die Berner in der Tabelle zwei Punkte hinter dem FCZ, haben allerdings ein Spiel weniger ausgetragen. Am anderen Ende der Rangliste wird der FC Basel langsam abgehängt. Beim 0:3 gegen Lausanne-Sport blieb der von Heiko Vogel trainierte FCB zum vierten Mal in Serie ohne Tor und ohne Punkte. Das spektakulärste Sonntagsspiel fand in Genf statt. Erst drehten die Gäste aus Luzern nach frühem Rückstand die Partie, ehe Servette sich mit drei Treffern nochmals zurückmeldete. Dank dem 4:2-Heimsieg machen die Genfer einen Sprung auf den 4. Platz. Eine gute Runde war es auch für St. Gallen, das am Samstag 3:1 gegen GC gewann und somit zu YB und Zürich (1:1 gegen Lausanne-Ouchy) aufschloss. Dominique Aegerter hebt sich das Beste in seiner ersten Saison in der Superbike-WM für den Schluss auf. Der Oberaargauer wird in den letzten Rennen beim Finale in Jerez in Spanien Zweiter und Dritter. Schon am Samstag im ersten Rennen über die normale Distanz in Andalusien hatte sich Aegerter Hoffnungen auf eine Spitzenklassierung machen dürfen. Losgefahren war er von Startplatz 2, in der Qualifikation war einzig der neue und alte Weltmeister, der Spanier Alvaro Bautista auf Ducati, schneller gewesen. Ein Problem mit der Elektronik an der Yamaha liess den Traum vom Exploit jedoch platzen. Am Sonntag vor der Prüfung über die verkürzte Distanz, in dieser Rennklasse offiziell als Superpole-Race bezeichnet, stand Aegerter wiederum neben Bautista in der Frontreihe. Die neuerliche Chance packte er beim Schopf - in einem Rennen, in dem er vorerst erneut mit der Technik an der Yamaha zu kämpfen hatte. Diesmal hatte er Ölverlust zu beklagen; die sichtbare Spur machte den Unterbruch des Rennens nötig. Die zweite Tranche führte über noch acht Runden, nach denen Aegerter nach dem Wechsel auf das Ersatz-Motorrad mit anderthalb Sekunden Rückstand auf Saisondominator Bautista das Ziel erreichte. Gut drei Stunden nach dem ersten Podiumsrang in dieser Serie doppelte Aegerter gleich nach. Im zweiten Hauptrennen des Wochenendes belegte er hinter Bautista und dem Türken Toprak Razgatlioglu, einem Markenkollegen, Platz 3. Razgatlioglu entschied das packende Duell gegen den Spanier zwar hauchdünn für sich. Wegen Überschreitens der Streckenbegrenzung musste er den Sieg jedoch seinem Dauerrivalen überlassen. Dank dem versöhnlichen Saisonabschluss, den er auch als Entschädigung für viele Ungereimtheiten und Enttäuschungen im Verlauf dieser Weltmeisterschaft betrachten darf, stiess Aegerter in der Gesamtwertung auf Platz 8 vor. Real Madrids französischer Fussball-Nationalspieler Aurélien Tchouameni hat sich im Clásico den Mittelfuss gebrochen. Wie die Königlichen am Tag nach dem 2:1 in der spanischen Liga gegen den FC Barcelona mitteilten, sei dies das Ergebnis einer medizinischen Untersuchung vom Sonntag. Konkret wurde bei dem 23 Jahre alten Mittelfeldspieler eine «Stressfraktur am zweiten Mittelfussknochen des linken Fusses» diagnostiziert, wie es in einer Vereinsmitteilung hiess. Wie lange Tchouameni, der am Samstag die gesamte Spielzeit gegen Barça auf dem Rasen stand, der Mannschaft von Trainer Carlo Ancelotti fehlen wird, wurde nicht mitgeteilt. Parte médico de Tchouameni. Der Spielbetrieb der höchsten britischen Eishockey-Liga wird von einem tragischen Vorfall überschattet. Der 29-jährige Amerikaner Adam Johnson von den Nottingham Panthers ist seinen schweren Verletzungen am Hals erlegen, die er am Samstag in der Partie bei den Sheffield Steelers erlitten hatte. Johnson war von einer Schlittschuh-Kufe getroffen worden. Die gesamte Eishockeyfamilie trauert um Adam Johnson. Der Stürmer, der in der letzten Saison noch das Trikot der trug, wurde Samstagabend im Spiel seiner Nottingham Panthers von einem Schlittschuh am Hals getroffen und erlag seinen schweren Verletzungen. Vor seinem Wechsel nach Nottingham auf diese Saison hin hatte Johnson unter anderem ein paar Spiele für die Pittsburgh Penguins in der National Hockey League bestritten. In der letzten Saison war er in Deutschland für Augsburg tätig. Titelverteidiger Südafrika hat ein intensives Duell der Rugby-Grossmächte gewonnen und ist nun alleiniger Rekordweltmeister. Die Springboks setzten sich im Finale gegen Neuseeland am Samstagabend in Paris mit 12:11 (12:6) durch, nach 1995, 2007 und 2019 ist es der vierte WM-Titel für Südafrika. Kapitän Siya Kolisi unterstrich die Bedeutung des Erfolgs, die weit über einen sportlichen Sieg hinausgehe. «Von aussen kann man das vielleicht nicht komplett verstehen», sagte er, «unser Land macht so viel durch, so vielen Kindern geht es nicht gut, aber wir können für Hoffnung sorgen und zeigen: Wenn wir zusammenarbeiten, dann ist alles möglich.» Die All Blacks durchlebten vor 80.000 Zuschauern im Stade de France und Millionen vor den Bildschirmen dagegen einen tragischen Abend, verloren unter anderem Kapitän Sam Cane mit Roter Karte - eine solche Strafe hatte es in einem WM-Finale noch nie gegeben. Beide Teams sahen zudem insgesamt viermal Gelb, mehr als eine Gelbe Karte gab es zuvor in keinem Endspiel einer Weltmeisterschaft. Neuseeland, Weltmeister von 1987, 2011 und 2015, musste sich damit auch im zweiten Endspiel gegen den grossen Rivalen geschlagen geben. 1995 hatte es diese Paarung schon einmal gegeben, das Finale in Südafrika ging nicht nur aus sportlichen Gründen in die Geschichte ein: Die Springboks traten damals erstmals mit schwarzen und weissen Spielern an, Bilder von Nelson Mandela im grün-gelben Trikot gingen damals um die Welt. Zürich könnte am Sonntag die Tabellenführung an die Young Boys verlieren. Die Zürcher müssen sich in der 12. Runde der Super League daheim gegen Lausanne-Ouchy mit einem 1:1 begnügen. St. Gallen bleibt nach dem 3:1 gegen GC im eigenen Stadion ohne Punktverlust. Der FCZ kassierte gegen Lausanne-Ouchy in der 24. Minute das 0:1 durch den jungen Ismael Gharbi. Kurz vor der Pause gelang durch einen von Jonathan Okita verwandelten Penalty der Ausgleich. Trotz einer Steigerung nach der Pause reichte es dem FCZ nicht zum Sieg gegen den Aussenseiter. 90. Schluss im Letzigrund. Wir spielen 1:1-Unentschieden im ersten Heimspiel der Vereinsgeschichte gegen den . Das Tor für den Stadtclub erzielte Jonathan Okita. 1:1 | St. Gallen bewerkstelligte den sechsten Sieg in ebenso vielen Heimspielen dank Toren von Chadrac Akolo, Willem Geubbels und Mattia Zanotti in der ersten Halbzeit. Für das nach zwei Siegen in Folge gebremste GC hatte Tsiy Ndenge zum 1:1 ausgeglichen. Im dritten Samstagsspiel trennten sich Yverdon und Winterthur 1:1. Der FCW vergab in der 80. Minute durch einen verschossenen Penalty von Roman Buess den möglichen Sieg. Am Sonntag spielt YB in Lugano, der FC Basel tritt bei Lausanne-Sport an und Luzern gastiert bei Servette. 24 Stunden nach der Heimniederlage gegen Lugano gewinnen die ZSC Lions (2.) das Spitzenspiel in der National League auswärts bei Leader Fribourg-Gottéron mit 3:1. Verteidiger Willy Riedi brachte die ZSC Lions schon nach 14 Sekunden in der ausverkauften St-Léonard-Halle in Führung. Derek Grant erhöhte im zweiten Abschnitt im Powerplay auf 2:0. Den Anschlusstreffer des Heimteams durch Benoit Jecker beantwortete der ZSC im Schlussabschnitt mit dem 3:1 durch Denis Malgin. Gottéron verlor erstmals seit dem 16. September (2:5 gegen Lugano) und nach acht Siegen hintereinander wieder ein Heimspiel. Das Verfolgerduell gewann der EV Zug (3.) in Bern gegen den SCB mit 2:1 nach Penaltyschiessen. Durch diese Ergebnisse rückten die Top 3 in der Tabelle näher zusammen. Gottéron bleibt Leader drei Punkte vor den ZSC Lions und sechs Zähler vor Zug, bestritt bislang aber eine Partie mehr als die beiden Verfolger. Vorerst gestoppt wurde die Aufholjagd des HC Lugano. Nach sechs Siegen de suite verloren die Luganesi in der Resega gegen Lausanne mit 3:4. Packend verlief die Partie in der Gotthard-Arena. Ambri-Piotta gewann gegen die SCL Tigers mit 2:1 nach Verlängerung, nachdem ihnen in der regulären Spielzeit der Ausgleich erst 0,2 Sekunden vor Schluss gelungen war. Der EHC Kloten besiegte die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers 2:1; Davos setzte sich gegen Biel 3:2 durch. Bayern München setzt sich nach einem verrückten Spiel mindestens bis am Sonntag an die Spitze der Bundesliga. Bei der Rückkehr von Manuel Neuer gewinnt der Meister dank acht Toren in der zweiten Halbzeit mit 8:0. Erstmals seit zehn Monaten spielte Bayern München wieder mit dem Manuel Neuer im Tor. Der lange Zeit wegen der Folgen eines Skiunfalls fehlende 37-Jährige erlebte eine turbulente erste Halbzeit. Nach weniger als fünf Minuten flog Teamkollege Joshua Kimmich wegen einer Notbremse vom Platz. Noch vor der Pause folgten ihm allerdings auch zwei Darmstädter - Klaus Gjasula und der Ex-St. Galler Matej Maglica - wegen der gleichen Vergehen vorzeitig in die Kabine. In Unterzahl konnten sich die Darmstädter nicht mehr schadlos halten. Als Torschütze stach Harry Kane mit drei Treffern heraus. Besonders sehenswert war das 5:0, das Kane aus über 50 Metern mit einem Schuss ins erstaunlich verwaiste gegnerische Tor erzielte. Der Engländer hat nun bereits zwölfmal in der Bundesliga getroffen. Als Zweifach-Torschützen zeichneten sich bei den Münchnern Jamal Musiala und Leroy Sané aus. Einen wichtigen Sieg feierte Borussia Mönchengladbach. Die schlecht in die Saison gestartete Mannschaft von Gerardo Seoane feierte mit dem 2:1 gegen Heidenheim den ersten Heimsieg der Saison. Der wieder in Form gekommene Franzose Alassane Pléa traf zweimal. Für Urs Fischer gab es keinen erlösenden Erfolg: Zum zehnten Mal in Folge verlor das vom Zürcher trainierte Union Berlin. Ein Eigentor von Robin Knoche stand am Ursprung der 0:2-Niederlage. Der zweite Gegentreffer fiel nach dem Platzverweis gegen Unions Rani Khedira (60.). Augsburg kam unter dem neuen dänischen Trainer Jess Thorup zu einem zweiten eindrücklichen Sieg. Eine Woche nach dem 5:2 in Heidenheim gewann das Team mit dem eingewechselten Ruben Vargas gegen Wolfsburg dank zwei späten Toren innerhalb von zwei Minuten 3:2. In der 79. führte ein Eigentor zum 2:2 und für den Siegtreffer war der Belgier Arne Engels verantwortlich. Der verletzte Kevin Mbabu bei Augsburg und der Reservist Cedric Zesiger bei Wolfsburg kamen nicht zum Einsatz. Die Diskussionen um den frühen Saisonstart und den Rennkalender gehen im alpinen Ski-Weltcup weiter. «Ich verstehe auch nicht, wer sich im Oktober für Skirennen interessiert und warum wir auf Gletschern ohne Schnee fahren», sagte Präsident Johan Eliasch vom Weltverband Fis in einem Beitrag des TV-Senders ORF. Er hoffe, dass der österreichische Verband für eine Verlegung der Rennen in Sölden nach hinten offen sei. Mit dem Riesenslalom der Frauen war auf dem Rettenbachferner am Samstag traditionell die neue Saison eröffnet worden. Die Aussagen des 61-jährigen Eliasch überraschen. Der ÖSV zeigt aber durchaus Bereitschaft, die Sölden-Klassiker noch etwas später im Jahr stattfinden zu lassen. Man habe sich dem Thema noch nie verschlossen und wolle gemeinsam mit der Fis nach der besten Lösung suchen, erklärte Verbandspräsidentin Roswitha Stadlober laut der österreichischen Presseagentur APA. Die öffentliche Kritik am frühen Saisonstart in Sölden wurde mit Blick auf die Klimakrise in den vergangenen Jahren immer lauter. Diese Saison fand er eine Woche später statt als vorigen Winter. Man werde den Auftakttermin erneut anpassen, sagte Fis-Generalsekretär Michel Vion beim traditionellen Eröffnungsevent am Freitag, bei dem Präsident Eliasch gefehlt hatte. Die Planung sei aber ein komplexes Thema, erklärte Vion. Jede Änderung habe Konsequenzen - und womöglich auch weniger Rennen zur Folge. Jan Kovar verletzte sich im Spiel gegen den HC Ambrì-Piotta vom Freitag, am Bein und konnte die Partie nicht zu Ende spielen. Weitere Untersuchungen haben ergeben, dass er 6-8 Wochen ausfallen wird. Der Tscheche hat in bisher 17 Saisonspielen für den EVZ 3 Tore erzielt und 14 Assists gegeben und kommt auf eine durchschnittliche Eiszeit von 17.5 Minuten. 🤕 Medical Update: Jan hat sich in der Partie gegen Ambrì-Piotta am Bein verletzt. Er wird dem 6-8 Wochen fehlen. 📰 Zur Medienmitteilung: Die neuen Wachs-Regeln im Ski-Weltcup sorgen überraschend schon im 1. Rennen für die 1. Disqualifikation. Die Fluor-Werte am Ski von waren zu hoch. Nairo Quintana kehrt in bekanntem Umfeld in den Rennbetrieb zurück. Der im letzten Jahr wegen eines «medizinischen Vergehens» nachträglich aus der Tour de France ausgeschlossene Kolumbianer fährt in der kommenden Saison wieder für das Team Movistar. Dem 33-jährigen Quintana war während der letzten Frankreich-Rundfahrt zweimal der Gebrauch von Tramadol nachgewiesen worden, was die nachträgliche Disqualifikation nach sich zog. Der Südamerikaner hatte im Schlussklassement Platz 6 belegt. Die Verwendung des Schmerzmittels wurde nicht als «Doping», sondern als «medizinisches Vergehen» betrachtet. Tramadol steht auf der Liste der verbotenen Substanzen des Internationalen Radsport-Verbandes (UCI), die Welt-Anti-Doping-Agentur (WADA) allerdings zieht mit dieser Einstufung erst auf die kommende Saison hin nach. Quintana hatte wenige Wochen nach dem Urteil seinen damaligen Arbeitgeber Arkéa-Samsic verlassen. Bei der Equipe Movistar stand er schon in den Jahren 2012 bis 2019 unter Vertrag. In dieser Zeit gewann er den Giro d’Italia (2014) und die Vuelta (2016). Die Atlanta Hawks verloren auch ihr zweites Spiel dieser NBA-Saison. Das Team mit Clint Capela unterlag zuhause den New York Knicks 120:126. Capela steuerte in einer ausgeglichenen Partie 13 Punkte bei und war mit 13 Rebounds in dieser Statistik ein weiteres Mal der Beste seiner Mannschaft. Andererseits war der Genfer mit minus 9 wie schon am Mittwoch bei der Auswärts-Niederlage gegen die Charlotte Hornets der Spieler mit der schlechtesten Plus-/Minus-Bilanz. Final score tonight England sichert sich an der Rugby-WM in Frankreich den 3. Platz. Die Briten gewinnen den «kleinen Final» gegen Argentinien 26:23. In dem ausgeglichenen Duell starteten die Engländer etwas besser und gingen mit einer 16:10-Führung in die Pause. Durch einen Versuch gleich zu Beginn der zweiten Halbzeit kämpften sich die Südamerikaner ins Spiel zurück, mussten sich in der dramatischen Schlussphase aber knapp geschlagen geben. Damit wurde England nach einem Weltmeistertitel (2003) und drei 2. Plätzen (1991, 2007, 2019) erstmals WM-Dritter. Im Final am Samstag (21.00 Uhr) treffen Titelverteidiger Südafrika und Neuseeland aufeinander. Der HC Fribourg-Gottéron ist der Gewinner der Runde vom Freitag in der National League. Dem Leader gelingt etwas, was sonst noch niemand diese Saison geschafft hat: Ein Auswärtssieg bei Meister Genf. Das Spitzenspiel zwischen Meister Genève-Servette und Leader Fribourg-Gottéron verlief packend. Fribourg zog durch Tore von Marcus Sörensen, Lucas Wallmark und Samuel Walser auf 3:0 davon. Servette holte diesen Rückstand indessen auf. Der Finne Sakari Manninen realisierte in den letzten sieben Minuten mit zwei Goals den Ausgleich. Am Ende siegte Freiburg doch noch - mit 4:3 nach Penaltyschiessen. Gottéron profitierte auch davon, dass die Verfolger leer ausgingen. Die ZSC Lions verloren gegen Lugano nach einer 1:0-Führung mit 1:3. Der EV Zug kassierte nach sechs Siegen de suite eine 2:3-Heimniederlage gegen den HC Ambri-Piotta. Gottéron baute so den Vorsprung in der Tabelle (mit einem Mehrspiel) auf sechs Punkte auf die ZSC Lions aus. Im Bereich des oberen Playoff-Strich besiegten die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers (8.) den Tabellennachbar HC Davos (7.) glückhaft mit 3:2 nach Verlängerung. Der Lausanne Hockey Club wahrte den Anschluss ans Tabellenmittelfeld mit einem 3:0-Heimerfolg über Kloten. Der 20-jährige Goalie Kevin Pasche kam in seinem allerersten Spiel in der National League zu einem Shutout. Der EHC Biel, Playoff-Finalist der letzten Saison, fand auch gegen Schlusslicht HC Ajoie noch nicht aus der Krise. Biel gewann zwar 4:3 nach Penaltyschiessen, Ajoie punktete aber zum dritten Mal hintereinander. Das Schweizer Nationalteam der Frauen verliert das dritte Spiel der Nations League 0:1 gegen Schweden. Magdalena Eriksson gelang für die WM-Dritten aus Skandinavien der einzige Treffer kurz vor der Pause. Für die Schweiz geht es am Dienstag mit der Partie in Zürich gegen Weltmeister Spanien weiter. Mehr dazu: Der Schweizer Tennisprofi Dominic Stricker scheitert an den Swiss Indoors in den Viertelfinals. Der 21-jährige Berner unterliegt dem Franzosen Ugo Humbert 4:6, 6:2, 2:6. Damit gehen die Halbfinals beim 500er-Turnier in Basel wie im letzten Jahr ohne Schweizer Beteiligung über die Bühne. Humbert, als Nummer 28 der Welt 68 Positionen vor Stricker klassiert, trifft am Samstag auf den als Nummer 4 gesetzten Polen Hubert Hurkacz. Mehr dazu: Der Franzose war im Duell zweier Linkshänder der erwartet unangenehme Gegner. Einen nervösen Start - Humbert führte 2:0 und 40:15 bei eigenem Aufschlag - konnte Stricker noch wettmachen, das Break zum 4:6 natürlich nicht mehr. Erstaunlicherweise drehte der Schweizer im zweiten Satz mächtig auf und dominierte seinen drei Jahre älteren Kontrahenten phasenweise klar. Humbert, der seine gute Form zuletzt mit Siegen gegen die Top-Ten-Spieler Stefanos Tsitsipas und Andrej Rublew und Viertelfinals bei den grossen Turnieren in Peking und Schanghai unter Beweis gestellt hatte, fand jedoch wieder in die Spur zurück. Er nahm Stricker im Entscheidungssatz gleich das erste Aufschlagspiel ab und vereitelte diesmal auch eine Chance des Berners zum sofortigen Re-Break. Nach knapp zwei Stunden und einem zweiten Break zum 6:2 behielt der Franzose im ersten Duell der beiden die Oberhand. Stricker muss sich nach seinem dritten verlorenen ATP-Viertelfinal - dem ersten seit gut zwei Jahren - allerdings keine grossen Vorwürfe machen. Er kam eine Runde weiter als im letzten Jahr und sicherte sich seinen Platz in den Top 100 der Weltrangliste wohl bis Ende Jahr. Damit dürfte er am Australian Open erstmals ohne Qualifikation im Hauptfeld eines Grand-Slam-Turniers stehen. Mehr als 20 Millionen Fans aus 206 Ländern haben in der ersten Bewerbungsphase Tickets für die Fussball-EM 2024 in Deutschland beantragt. Damit überstieg die Nachfrage deutlich das Angebot: Insgesamt standen im Zeitraum vom 3. bis 26. Oktober 1,2 Millionen Karten zur Verfügung. Die nächste Verkaufsphase startet nach der Endrundenauslosung am 2. Dezember. Insgesamt stehen 2,7 Millionen Eintrittskarten für die 51 Spiele in den zehn Stadien zum Verkauf. Die Uefa rechnet mit Erlösen von über 300 Millionen Euro aus dem Ticketgeschäft. Die Gesamteinnahmen der zweiten EM-Endrunde in Deutschland nach 1988 sollen sich auf 2,3 Milliarden belaufen. Mikaela Shiffrin gewann den von der internationalen Skijournalisten-Vereinigung vergebenen «Skieur d’Or» zum dritten Mal. Bereits 2017 und 2019 erhielt sie die Auszeichnung. Die 28-jährige Amerikanerin wusste mit dem Gewinn des Gesamtweltcups und dem WM-Titel im Riesenslalom zu überzeugen. Sie setzte sich bei der Wahl etwas überraschend gegen Marco Odermatt durch, der in der vergangenen Saison nicht nur den Gesamtweltcup mit der Rekordpunktzahl von 2042 für sich entschied, sondern auch zwei WM-Titel vorzuweisen hatte. Odermatt hatte den «Skieur d’Or» im Vorjahr als erster Schweizer seit Carlo Janka 2010 gewonnen. Rekordsieger mit vier Auszeichnungen sind der Schweizer Pirmin Zurbriggen und der Österreicher Marcel Hirscher. Die Schweizer Kunstturnerin Lena Bickel beendet das Wettkampfjahr 2023 wegen Muskelbeschwerden vorzeitig. Die 18-jährige Tessinerin, die vor wenigen Wochen an den Weltmeisterschaften in Antwerpen als Einzelathletin einen persönlichen Quotenplatz für die Olympischen Spiele gelöst hat, verpasst somit auch den Swiss Cup von übernächstem Sonntag in Zürich. Der frühere Fussball-Weltmeister Mesut Özil hat sich erneut klar mit Palästina solidarisiert. Der 34-Jährige teilte am Freitag bei Instagram sowie auf der Plattform X, vormals Twitter, ein Video aus dem Fanblock vom Champions-League-Spiel zwischen Celtic Glasgow und Atlético Madrid (2:2) vom Mittwoch. Auf den rund 70-sekündigen Aufnahmen ist zu sehen, wie viele Anhänger der Schotten auf den Tribünen mit Palästina-Flaggen den Fussball-Klassiker «You’ll never walk alone» singen. Dazu schrieb Özil: «Menschen in Palästina – ihr werdet nie alleine gehen. Respekt an die Fans von @CelticFC.» Dazu postete er selbst Herzen und die Flagge Palästinas. Die Vereinsführung von Celtic hatte sich von politischen Bekundungen der Fans distanziert. Vor einigen Tagen hatte der Ex-Nationalspieler Özil auch schon sein Bedauern über den Tod tausender Menschen in Israel und dem Gazastreifen ausgedrückt. Özil hatte in der Vergangenheit schon mehrfach mit politischen Statements für Aufsehen gesorgt. Im Dezember 2019 hatte sich der damalige Profi des FC Arsenal in den sozialen Medien kritisch zur Unterdrückung der Uiguren in China geäussert. Zudem hatten seine Fotos und seine Nähe zum umstrittenen türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan vor allem in Deutschland für Kritik gesorgt. Der Norweger Lucas Braathen tritt mit erst 23 Jahren per sofort zurück. Dies gibt der Slalomspezialist unmittelbar vor dem Weltcup-Auftakt in Sölden bekannt. Braathen hatte im vergangenen Winter trotz einer Blinddarm-Operation die kleine Kristallkugel als bester Slalomfahrer geholt. Er feierte zwei seiner fünf Weltcupsiege in der Schweiz: 2022 in Wengen und 2023 in Adelboden gewann er jeweils den Slalom. Der Rücktritt ist ein Paukenschlag, denn der junge Norweger zählte zu den aufsteigenden Stars bei den Alpinen. Der 23-Jährige begründet diesen Schritt mit der fehlenden Freiheit. Als Spitzensportler musste er auf viele andere Aspekte seines Lebens verzichten. «Damit ich in diesem System weiterfahren kann, muss ich nicht nur meine Träume aufschieben. Ich musste auch meine Freude aufschieben. Ich bin nicht mehr bereit, das zu tun», sagte er am Freitagmorgen in Sölden, wo er vor drei Jahren seinen ersten Weltcupsieg gefeiert hatte. Zu Braathens Rücktrittsentscheid beigetragen haben dürfte ein Streit mit dem norwegischen Skiverband NSF, der strenge Richtlinien im Sponsoring von Athleten hat. Braathen modelte für die Modemarke «J. Lindberg» und stiess damit offenbar den NSF vor den Kopf, der von «Helly Hansen» ausgestattet wird. Manuel Neuer wird einem Medienbericht zufolge nach mehr als zehn Monaten Verletzungspause sein Comeback beim FC Bayern München geben. Das berichtete am Freitag der TV-Sender Sky. Die Entscheidung habe Trainer Thomas Tuchel in Absprache mit Neuer und Torwarttrainer Michael Rechner getroffen. Der 37 Jahre alte Kapitän gehört demnach beim Bundesliga-Heimspiel am Samstag gegen den SV Darmstadt 98 wieder zum Kader des deutschen Fussball-Rekordmeisters und erhält direkt einen Platz in der Startelf. Letztmals stand Neuer am 12. November 2022 beim 2:0 auswärts gegen den FC Schalke im Münchner Tor. Der Weltmeister von 2014 hat sein bislang letztes Spiel beim frühen deutschen WM-Aus in Katar am 1. Dezember 2022 gegen Costa Rica bestritten. Im Anschluss an das Turnier hatte er sich bei einer Ski-Tour Schien- und Wadenbein am rechten Unterschenkel gebrochen. Seitdem arbeitete er an seinem Comeback. (dpa) Wegen verbotener Sportwetten ist Eishockey-Profi Shane Pinto vom NHL-Klub Ottawa Senators für 41 Spiele gesperrt worden. Er verpasst damit die Hälfte der Hauptrunde. Nach Angaben der nordamerikanischen Profiliga soll der 22-jährige Pinto nicht auf NHL-Spiele gesetzt haben. Es ist unklar, um welches Vergehen es sich handelt. NHL-Profis ist es erlaubt, Wetten in anderen Sportarten abzusetzen. «Shane ist ein geschätztes Mitglied unseres Eishockeyklubs. Ein engagierter, intelligenter junger Mann, der schlechte Entscheidungen getroffen hat. Wir wissen, dass er seine Fehler bereut», teilte die kanadische Franchise mit. Der Klub unterstütze «die Glücksspielregeln der NHL voll und ganz». Nino Niederreiter, der beste Schweizer NHL-Torschütze aller Zeiten, erhöhte die Rekordzahl auf 222 Treffer. Zum 4:1-Auswärtssieg mit den Winnipeg Jets über die Detroit Red Wings steuerte er ein Tor und einen Assist bei. Der 31-jährige Bündner musste bis zur Schlussminute warten, ehe er im siebten Spiel dieser Saison erstmals traf. Er schloss einen Gegenstoss mit einem Schuss aus dem Handgelenk ins leere Tor erfolgreich ab. Hinter der Schnapszahl von 222 Treffern steckt harte Arbeit, Ausdauer und viel Talent. Niederreiter bestritt schon als 16-Jähriger drei Playoff-Partien für den HC Davos, wechselte als 17-Jähriger nach Nordamerika und schoss als 18-Jähriger im Dress der New York Islanders im Oktober 2010 den ersten NHL-Treffer. Die Staatsanwaltschaft München hat am Donnerstag Räume des Deutschen Eishockey-Bundes und einer nicht explizit genannten Privatperson durchsuchen lassen. Das bestätigten die Behörde und der DEB auf Anfrage. Nähere Angaben zu den Hintergründen der Durchsuchungen machten weder der DEB noch die Staatsanwaltschaft. Offiziell unklar ist, gegen wen sich die Ermittlungen richten und wie der genaue Vorwurf lautet. «Bitte verstehen Sie, dass wir uns zu Details des Sachverhalts nicht weiter äussern werden», hiess es dazu vom DEB. Berichten des «Spiegel», des Bayerischen Rundfunks und der «Augsburger Allgemeinen» zufolge geht es um bereits in der Vergangenheit erhobene Vorwürfe im Zusammenhang mit der Vergabe von Übertragungs- und Werberechten. Bereits vor einigen Jahren hatte es Kritik einiger Eishockey-Landesverbände gegeben. Dabei ging es um Verhandlungen über TV-Verträge und die Vergabe von Medienrechten. Servette bleibt in der Gruppenphase der Europa League ohne Sieg. Nach den Niederlagen in den ersten beiden Spielen holte das Team von Trainer René Weiler auswärts gegen das zuvor ebenfalls punktelose Sheriff Tiraspol immerhin ein 1:1. Den Treffer für die Genfer zum 1:0 erzielte Enzo Crivelli (41.) Der FC Lugano kassiert in der Conference League im dritten Gruppenspiel die erste Niederlage. Das Team von Trainer Mattia Croci-Torti verliert in Zürich gegen den FC Brügge 1:3. «Meine Mannschaft wird gegen Brügge ein anderes Gesicht zeigen», versprach Croci-Torti nach der 1:2-Niederlage am Sonntag bei den Grasshoppers. Davon war in den ersten 45 Minuten nichts zu sehen. Der Auftritt von Lugano in der ersten Halbzeit passte zum regnerischen und kühlen Wetter. Die Tessiner zeigten nichts Erwärmendes, agierten in der Offensive mehr als harmlos. Einziger Torschütze für Lugano Shkelqim Vadi (74.). Für das Schweizer Nationalteam wirkt sich das überraschende 3:3-Remis in der EM-Qualifikation gegen Belarus nicht negativ auf die Platzierung in der FIFA-Weltrangliste aus. Die Mannschaft von Murat Yakin belegt unverändert den 14. Platz. Im zum zweitletzten Mal in diesem Jahr veröffentlichten Ranking verbleibt Weltmeister Argentinien an der Spitze, gefolgt von Frankreich, Brasilien, England und Belgien. In den Top 10 machten die für die EM 2024 qualifizierten Portugal (6.) und Spanien (8.) je zwei Positionen gut. EM-Gastgeber Deutschland wird im 16. Rang geführt. Nach dem verweigerten Handschlag mit Trainer Urs Fischer in der Champions League hat Fussball-Bundesligist Union Berlin Stürmer David Fofana für eine Woche suspendiert. Der 20-Jährige habe sich in einem persönlichen Gespräch mit Fischer und Geschäftsführer Oliver Ruhnert entschuldigt, dennoch werde er bis kommenden Mittwoch «individuell trainieren», sagte Pressesprecher Christian Arbeit. Bei der Niederlage gegen die SSC Neapel (0:1) war Fofana in der 70. Minute ausgewechselt worden und hatte Fischer ignoriert. «Es geht um das Team, es geht immer darum, wie man sich nach Entscheidungen verhält», sagte Fischer: «Fussball ist immer noch ein Teamsport, da muss man sich manchmal unterordnen. Ich hoffe, dass er aus solchen Situationen lernt.» Gegen den in einen Wettskandal verwickelten Newcastle-United-Profi Sandro Tonali ist vom italienischen Fussballverband FIGC eine zehnmonatige Sperre verhängt worden. Der 23-Jährige muss sich zudem einer mindestens sechsmonatigen Therapie zur Bekämpfung seiner Spielsucht unterziehen. Zudem wird er an 16 Vorträgen zum Thema Spielsucht teilnehmen müssen. Dies kündigte der italienische Verbandschef Gabriele Gravina an. Sollte der geständige Tonali diese Verpflichtungen nicht erfüllen, droht ihm eine Sperre von über drei Jahren. Der Newcastle-Spieler wird wohl die weiteren Spiele der laufenden Saison versäumen. Aufatmen bei Gianni Infantino: Das Strafverfahren gegen den Präsidenten des Fussball-Weltverbandes FIFA im sogenannten «Fall Lauber» ist eingestellt worden. Der Verdacht auf eine Instrumentalisierung der Bundesanwaltschaft habe sich im Verlauf der Untersuchung nicht erhärtet, teilten die beiden ausserordentlichen Bundesanwälte Ulrich Weder und Hans Maurer am Donnerstag mit. Der Tatverdacht sei entkräftet worden. «Das ist ein vollumfänglicher, deutlicher und klarer Sieg für mich, für die neue FIFA und für die Gerechtigkeit», sagte Infantino in einer Mitteilung: «Es ist jetzt allen klar, dass die Anschuldigungen gegen mich nur verzweifelte Versuche von armen, neidischen und korrupten Leuten waren, meinen Ruf anzugreifen. Falls diese Leute auch nur ein kleines bisschen Würde hätten, sollten sie zumindest den Anstand haben und sich für ihre Handlungen und den verursachten Schaden entschuldigen.» Trotz einer verrückten Aufholjagd verlieren die New Jersey Devils in der NHL das Heimspiel gegen die Washington Capitals 4:6. Timo Meier und Nico Hischier tragen als Torschützen zum Spektakel bei. Die Devils legten einen monumentalen Fehlstart hin und lagen nach knapp 18 Minuten schon 0:3 zurück. Der Schweizer Goalie Akira Schmid war nicht zu beneiden. Der Emmentaler liess drei von acht Schüssen passieren und wurde zur Pause durch Vitek Vanecek ersetzt. Mit dem Tschechen im Tor starteten die Devils im Mitteldrittel eine spektakuläre Aufholjagd. Mit drei Goals innert 131 Sekunden war der Rückstand bis zur 27. Minute wieder wettgemacht. Timo Meier und Captain Nico Hischier trafen zum 2:3 und 3:3. Washington glich zu Beginn des Schlussdrittels zum 4:4 aus, um nur knapp zwei Minuten später erneut in Führung zu gehen. Schliesslich sorgte Alexander Owetschkin zum 6:4 ins leere Tor für die definitive Entscheidung. Für die Devils war es die dritte aufeinanderfolgende Heimniederlage im vierten Heimspiel der Saison. Für die FIS Games 2028 interessieren sich neben St. Moritz zwei weitere Destinationen, wie der Internationale Ski-Verband per Communiqué vermeldet. Die Konkurrenten der Bündner gibt die FIS allerdings erst nach Ablauf der Bewerbungsfrist am 1. November bekannt. St. Moritz hatte seine Ambitionen bereits im Sommer öffentlich gemacht. Die FIS Games werden 2028 ihre Premiere feiern. Es handelt sich um Titelkämpfe, die künftig alle vier Jahre durchgeführt werden - und zwar in jenen Wintern, in denen keine Olympischen Winterspiele und keine Ski-Weltmeisterschaften stattfinden. Wettkämpfe sind dabei grundsätzlich in allen Ski-Sportarten (inklusive Telemark, Speed-Ski, Freeride, Para-Ski) geplant.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 08:15:00","image_url":"https://img.chmedia.ch/2023/11/08/be821adf-a7bb-4460-bdd0-4fafedc2f097.jpeg?width=200&height=200&fit=bound&quality=75&auto=webp&crop=1281,1281,x1070,y184","source_id":"bzbasel","source_priority":2730748,"country":["switzerland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"german"},{"article_id":"265685b47a852b8fc005ecfdc14aa2c2","title":"UCL: We’ll Have To Fight To Win –Ancelotti Speaks Ahead Real Madrid Vs Braga","link":"https://www.completesports.com/ucl-well-have-to-fight-to-win-ancelotti-speaks-ahead-real-madrid-vs-braga/","keywords":["UCL News","World Football","Ancelotti","Real Madrid","s Braga"],"creator":["Austin Akhilomen"],"video_url":null,"description":"Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti says his team would need to put up a fight to defeat Braga in their UEFA Champions League fixture on Wednesday, November 8 at the Santiago Bernabeu. A win over Braga would guarantee qualification to the round of 16 for Los Blancos. It is unclear whether midfield stalwart Jude Bellingham would be in the game due to his recent shoulder injury issue.   Read Also: Ex-Tottenham Hotspur Manager Hails Aina’s Versatility Speaking in the news conference ahead of the game, Ancelotti stressed that the squad would have to be fully concentrated from the beginning to the end of the encounter. \"It would be significant, at this stage of the season to wrap up the group stage in four games,\" realmadrid.com quoted Ancelotti as saying. \"We'll have to fight to win this game. We played well against Braga recently, both sides know each other well and we have to remember they're a good team who are coming to the Bernabeu looking to take points.

Others are hoping the future will include devices that can fix broken bones and injuries in a flash, as well as boxing gloves that measure just how hard a punch is thrown. A spokesperson for Virgin Media O2 which is supporting BBC Children in Need with 5G connectivity across their national Hado eSport tour, said: \"Technological advances are unlocking new possibilities every day. “From VAR to Hawkeye, smart balls to wearable sensors, technology has already transformed sport in ways unimaginable a few decades back. \"While we’re someway from many of the out-there ideas young people dreamt up, cutting-edge 5G connectivity will help unlock new innovation in future. “It is clear from the research that children want to see more technology used and that it would have a positive impact on how much they watch and play their favourite sports.” Despite widespread controversy over the implementation of VAR and video technology in the modern game, football was the most popular sport to watch, with 64 per cent of the youngsters tuning in. Tennis (26 per cent) and rugby (24 per cent) claimed silver and bronze when it comes to most popular sports, while 15 per cent said they hadn’t watched any sport at all, either in person or on TV in the past year.

Teleportation around the golf course to make the game quicker was a hit with an impatient 13 per cent and 14 per cent thought motorised swimsuits were a genius idea. The study, carried out via OnePoll.com, revealed that more than a third (35 per cent) of children said they watched sport a few times a week, seven per cent did so every day and 19 per cent once a week. Outside of school 45 per cent played football, 27 per cent went swimming, 15 per cent took part in athletics and nine per cent played rugby.

A march calling for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza is planned for Remembered Day on Saturday. However, there is no march planned for Remembrance Sunday - but police are fearful heightened tensions could lead to violence between the two sides.

MacIntyre was able to break into Marriner's inner circle, where he listened to sickening stories about Auschwitz and witnessed racism first-hand - with owner of a tyre-fitting firm, Marriner, who has now created a new life for himself in Thailand and opened his own ex-pat shop, throwing up Nazi salutes. Towards the end of the documentary, Marriner, and fellow Chelsea Headhunter Andy Frain, were preparing to ambush a peaceful march commemorating Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest moments during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, when 14 Catholics were shot dead. MacIntyre witnessed Marriner side-by-side with the leader of the neo-Nazi terrorist organisation Combat 18, but police were able to stop the yobs before any violence could break-out. Shortly after the documentary aired, Marriner was behind bars, and Judge Charles Byers said: \"It's clear to me that you relish violence and will stop at nothing to go anywhere in pursuit of it, showing little, if any, regard for other people or for the law.\" Marriner isn't the only football hooligan to call for action over the weekend, and one group, Football Lads Against Extremism, claims veterans have reached out and asked for their support \"due to the threat from the far left and pro-Palestine supporters to disrupt the Remembrance Day parade.\" They added: \"All football lads up and down the country to join us in standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans that fought for our freedom.\" This weekend, and will host games on Saturday, while and Chelsea are playing at home on Sunday.

He said: “Everybody has to stand up. There are always going to be injuries in football. “The good thing about us is that as a team and a manager, we don’t make excuses. Everybody feels valued in this team and we have a strong bond as a team. “The reality is we are missing a lot of key players. But you look at Manchester United away and Arsenal at home and we’ve got good results, so there are no excuses from us. Whatever team the manager picks, we give everything.” Frustrated for today! Thanks for your unbelievable support. We will always play for you 🖤🤍 we keep believing — Bruno Guimarães (@brunoog97) Newcastle headed back to Tyneside wondering what might have been after passing up opportunities to cancel out Niclas Fullkrug’s opener when Lewis Hall’s driven cross from a short corner move evaded all his team-mates and Joelinton sent a close-range header wide, and they were made to pay when Julian Brandt cemented the win late on. Trippier said: “These are the fine margins. We had a great chance from the set-piece routine – on another day it is a tap in, Joelinton’s header. “There was nothing in the game, but at this level, it is about being clinical.”","pubDate":"2023-11-08 08:32:40","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17419210/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ac7360b865951a982315a7314698a8e6","title":"NHL: Timo Meier erzielt drittes Saisontor - er kann aber nur kurz jubeln","link":"https://www.bzbasel.ch/sport/sport-news-nhl-timo-meier-erzielt-drittes-saisontor-er-kann-aber-nur-kurz-jubeln-ld.2534215","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Resultate, Transfers, News: Mit dem tagesaktuellen Sport-Ticker bleiben Sie über das laufende Geschehen stets informiert.

Die neuesten Meldungen aus der Welt des Sports. Timo Meier reiht sich in der Nacht auf Mittwoch in der NHL unter die Torschützen. Er kann die 3:6-Auswärtsniederlage der New Jersey Devils gegen die Colorado Avalanche aber nicht verhindern. Meier spielte seine Kaltblütigkeit im Powerplay aus, als er in der 32. Minute mit einem präzisen Handgelenkschuss aus kurzer Distanz zum 2:2-Ausgleich für New Jersey traf. Für den Appenzeller Stürmer war es im zwölften Saisonspiel das dritte Tor. Die Devils, die erneut ohne ihren Captain Nico Hischier und den ebenfalls verletzt ausfallenden Topskorer Jack Hughes antraten und im Schlussdrittel drei Gegentore hinnehmen mussten, stehen aktuell bei 7 Siegen und 5 Niederlagen. Nino Niederreiter mit den Winnipeg Jets (5:2 bei den St. Louis Blues) und Janis Moser mit den Arizona Coyotes (4:3 n.P. gegen die Seattle Kraken) erlebten mit ihren Teams einen erfolgreichen Abend. Für Roman Josi und die Nashville Predators setzte es beim 2:4 in Calgary hingegen eine Niederlage ab - die dritte im vierten aufeinanderfolgenden Auswärtsspiel. Die Mannschaft mit dem Berner Captain schliesst in der Nacht auf Freitag ihren zehntägigen «Road-Trip» nach Kanada mit dem Gastspiel in Winnipeg ab. Für Josi und Niederreiter ist es ein Duell unter Freunden und ehemaligen Teamkollegen. Titelverteidiger Manchester City hat vorzeitig das Achtelfinale der Champions League erreicht. Der englische Fussball-Meister setzte sich am Dienstagabend mit 3:0 (2:0) gegen die Young Boys Bern durch und ist damit nicht mehr von einem der ersten beiden Plätze der Gruppe G zu verdrängen. Erling Haaland (23./Foulelfmeter/52.) und Phil Foden (45.+1) erzielten gegen schwache Schweizer die Tore. Roter Stern Belgrad und die Young Boys bewegen sich in der Gruppe G weiter im Gleichschritt. Auch Serbiens Meister bezog mit einem 1:2 zuhause gegen RB Leipzig die dritte Niederlage. Zwischen Roter Stern und den Young Boys geht es in den letzten beiden Runden damit um den 3. Platz und das europäische Überwintern in der Europa League. Das zweite Direktduell steigt am 28. November in Bern. Die Begegnung in Belgrad war nach dem spätem Ausgleich des Heimteams 2:2 ausgegangen. In der Gruppe F mit Borussia Dortmund feierte AC Mailand gegen Paris St. Germain mit dem 2:1 (1:1) einen wichtigen «Dreier» und tat dem BVB einen Gefallen, Olivier Giroud (50.) war nach seinem Siegtor der gefeierte Held. Vor der Partie hatte es zwischen beiden Fan-Lagern massive Ausschreitungen gegeben, ein Paris-Anhänger war sogar niedergestochen worden. Viel Spannung an den letzten beiden Spieltagen verspricht auch die Gruppe E. Atletico Madrid hatte beim 6:0 (2:0) gegen Celtic Glasgow nach einer frühen Rote Karte für Daizen Maeda (23.) leichtes Spiel und übernahm die Tabellenführung mit acht Punkten. Dahinter lauert mit einem Punkt weniger Lazio Rom, das 1:0 (1:0) gegen Feyenoord Rotterdam (6 Punkte) gewann. Borussia Dortmund hat seine Achtelfinalchance in der Champions League durch den nächsten wichtigen Sieg erheblich verbessert. Der BVB gewann auch das Rückspiel gegen den englischen Vertreter Newcastle United am Dienstagabend mit 2:0 (1:0) und steht damit bei sieben Punkten. Niclas Füllkrug (26.) traf für die Borussia zur Führung, es war sein erstes Tor in der Königsklasse überhaupt. Julian Brandt (79.) sorgte für die Entscheidung. Viertes Spiel, erste Pleite: Der FC Barcelona hat in der Champions League völlig überraschend gegen Schachtar Donezk verloren. In Hamburg musste Barca ein verdientes 0:1 (0:1) einstecken und vergab damit die Chance, sich als erstes Team für das Achtelfinale zu qualifizieren. Stattdessen gewann Donezk erstmals seit drei Jahren ein «Heimspiel» in der Königsklasse. Angreifer Danylo Sikan (40.) traf vor 49.147 Zuschauern per Kopf für die Ukrainer, die nun sechs Punkte auf dem Konto haben und sich Hoffnungen auf die K.o.-Phase machen dürfen. Barca blieb mit neun Zählern zunächst Tabellenführer, der FC Porto spielte erst am Abend gegen Royal Antwerpen. Letztmals hatte Donezk am 1. Dezember 2020 «zu Hause» gewonnen - damals mit 2:0 gegen Real Madrid in Kiew. Nati-Trainer Murat Yakin trauert um seine Mutter. Wie der Schweizerische Fussballverband mitteilt, ist Emine Yakin am Montagabend im Spital in Basel im Kreise ihrer Familie verstorben. Sie wurde 89 Jahre alt. «Unsere Gedanken sind bei Murat und seiner Familie», so der SFV. Weltmeister Nils Stump muss die Saison vorzeitig beenden. Der Zürcher muss sich wegen einer komplexen Bänderverletzung an der linken Schulter operieren lassen. Das Missgeschick passierte vor wenigen Tagen an den Europameisterschaften in Montpellier bei Stumps überraschender Erstrunden-Niederlage gegen den Griechen Michail Tsoutlasvili. Die Länge der Rekonvaleszenz ist noch nicht bekannt. Bei normalem Heilungsverlauf sollte der Pechvogel im kommenden Frühling wieder einsatzbereit sein. Mit seinem Titelgewinn in der Klasse bis 73 kg im Mai in Frankreich hatte Stump ein Kapitel Schweizer Sportgeschichte geschrieben. Er wurde als erster Judoka unseres Landes Weltmeister. Der französische Fussball-Nationalspieler Eduardo Camavinga hat seinen bis 2027 laufenden Vertrag beim spanischen Rekordmeister Real Madrid vorzeitig um zwei Jahre bis 2029 verlängert. Das gaben die Königlichen am Dienstag bekannt. Der 20 Jahre alte zentrale Mittelfeldspieler, der von Trainer Carlo Ancelotti vielfach auch als Linksverteidiger eingesetzt wird, wechselte 2021 von seinem Jugendverein Stade Rennes in die spanische Hauptstadt. Seitdem absolvierte Camavinga 114 Spiele für Real, erzielte zwei Tore und legte fünf weitere auf. 2022 feierte er mit den Königlichen den Gewinn der spanischen Meisterschaft und der Champions League. Torhüter Joren van Pottelberghe wechselt innerhalb der National League auf die kommende Saison hin den Arbeitgeber. Der derzeit beim EHC Biel tätige Schweizer Internationale mit belgischen Wurzeln spielt in den kommenden drei Jahren für den HC Lugano. Der 26-jährige Van Pottelberghe, der beim EV Zug die Nachwuchsstufen durchlaufen und danach seine sportliche Entwicklung in Schweden bei Linköping vorangetrieben hat, hatte sich nach seiner Rückkehr in die Schweiz dem HC Davos angeschlossen. Russische Athleten werden bis auf Weiteres nicht an Wettbewerben des Weltskiverbandes Fis teilnehmen. Das sagte Michal Lamplot, Race-Direktor Langlauf beim Weltverband, am Dienstag beim Forum Nordicum der nordischen Skisportjournalisten im österreichischen Bad Mitterndorf. Natürlich wolle man immer die besten Athleten am Start haben. «Die Zeit ist aber noch nicht reif dafür», sagte Lamplot mit Blick auf den weiter andauernden Angriffskrieg Russlands in der Ukraine. Das Einzelfinale gewann Iga Swiatek klar 6:1, 6:0 gegen Jessica Pegula aus den USA. Die 22 Jahre alte Polin holte damit erstmals den Titel bei den WTA Finals und eroberte auch Position eins in der Weltrangliste zurück. Swiatek hat ihre letzten elf Tennis-Matches in diesem Jahr gewonnen. Tottenham Hotspur hat in der englischen Fussball-Meisterschaft durch seine erste Saisonniederlage die Rückeroberung der Tabellenspitze verpasst. In doppelter Unterzahl mussten sich die Spurs im Londoner Stadtduell mit dem FC Chelsea trotz einer frühen Führung noch mit 1:4 (1:1) geschlagen geben. Die Spurs liegen damit nun einen Punkt hinter Tabellenführer und Titelverteidiger Manchester City (am Samstag 6:1 gegen den AFC Bournemouth) nur noch auf dem zweiten Platz. Für die Spurs, zuvor die einzig noch unbesiegte Mannschaft der Premier League, begann die Begegnung durch den Führungstreffer von Dejan Kulusevski (6.) nach Plan. Doch der Platzverweis für Cristian Romero (33./grobes Foulspiel) nach einem wegen Abseits aberkannten Treffer von Ex-Bundesligaprofi Heung-Min Son leitete die Wende zugunsten der «Blues» ein. Denn nur zwei Minuten später glich Cole Palmer für die Gäste aus. Nachdem Tottenham zehn Minuten nach dem Seitenwechsel durch die Gelb-Rote Karte für Destiny Udogie (55./wiederholtes Foulspiel) weiter dezimiert worden war, leitete Nicolas Jackson (75.) Chelseas ersten Erfolg nach zuvor zwei Spielen ohne Sieg ein. Mit zwei Spielern weniger auf dem Feld bemühten sich die Hausherren in der Schlussphase vergeblich um den Ausgleich, kamen zu guten Chancen, doch erneut Jackson mit einem Doppelpack (90.+4/90.+8) sorgte für die Entscheidung. Nach zuletzt zwei Erstrunden-Niederlagen in Basel und Paris gewinnt Stan Wawrinka (ATP 53) seinen Auftaktmatch am ATP-250-Turnier von Metz problemlos. Er schlägt den Spanier Bernabe Zapata Mirallas (ATP 81) 6:0, 6:2. Der gut aufgelegte und sehr offensiv eingestellte Wawrinka begeisterte mit einem Blitzstart: Für den Gewinn des ersten Satzes benötigte er nur 18 Minuten und gab dabei lediglich fünf Punkte ab. Auch danach überzeugte der 38-Jährige mit wuchtigen Schlägen und zahlreichen Netzangriffen. Nach 52 Minuten verwertete er seinen zweiten Matchball. Im Achtelfinal trifft Wawrinka, der im letzten Jahr in Metz bis in den Halbfinal vorgestossen war, auf den jungen Franzosen Luca van Assche (ATP 76). Dieser musste gegen den Niederländer Botic van de Zandschulp (ATP 51) fast zwei Stunden länger als der Schweizer um den Sieg kämpfen (3:6, 6:3, 7:6). Der EV Zug hat Mike Künzle vom EHC Biel verpflichtet. Der 29-jährige Stürmer mit der Erfahrung von 24 Länderspielen unterschrieb bei den Zentralschweizern einen Vertrag über zwei Jahre. Künzle debütierte am 12. September 2013 bei den ZSC Lions in der höchsten Liga. Mit den Zürchern gewann er 2014 und 2018 den Meistertitel, ehe vor fünf Jahren zu Biel stiess. Nun entschied er sich für einen weiteren Wechsel. «Mike hat sich zu einem Powerstürmer mit Gardemassen entwickelt und ist im besten Eishockey-Alter», liess sich der Zuger Sportchef Reto Kläy zitieren. Der Thurgauer Golfprofi Joel Girrbach steigt erstmals in die grosse europäische Tour, die DP World Tour auf. Der 30-Jährige erreichte an dem mit 500’000 Euro dotierten Finalturnier der Challenge Tour den 7. Platz und verbesserte sich innerhalb der Challenge Tour auf den 17. Gesamtrang. Jeweils die besten 20 Spieler nach jeder Saison bekommen das Spielrecht für die nachfolgende Saison auf der grossen Tour. Denis Zakaria erzielt sein erste Tor in diesem Kalenderjahr. Der Schweizer Internationale trifft in der 11. Ligue-1-Runde beim 2:0-Heimsieg der AS Monaco gegen Brest zum 1:0. In der 16. Minute lenkte Zakaria einen Eckball des Russen Alexander Golowin mit dem Kopf ins Tor. Nach der Pause gelang dem formstarken Golowin das 2:0. Zakaria hatte seinen letzten Treffer vor etwas mehr als einem Jahr für den FC Chelsea in der Champions League gegen Dinamo Zagreb erzielt. Der Schweizer Nationalstürmer Xherdan Shaqiri trainiert ab Montag mit dem FC Lugano. Dies gegen die Luganesi in einer Medienmitteilung bekannt. Shaqiri's Saison in der amerikanischen Major Soccer League ist zu Ende. Er wird bis zu den entscheidenden EM-Qualispielen mit Lugano trainieren. «Danke FC Lugano. Ich freue mich, mich ab Montag wieder bei den Bianconeri auf die Nati vorzubereiten», wird der 32-Jährige zitiert. Der FC Basel kommt zum ersten Sieg seit Ende Juli in der Super League. Das erstmals in der Liga von Fabio Celestini betreute Team setzt sich daheim gegen Yverdon 2:1 durch. St. Gallen kommt zum ersten Auswärtssieg. Nach 415 Minuten beendete Aussenverteidiger Mohamed Dräger mit dem 1:0 die Durststrecke des FC Basel. Mehr als vier Spiele lang waren die Basler ohne Treffer geblieben. Den ersten Sieg seit Ende Juli bewerkstelligte aber erst Gabriel Sigua mit seinem Tor in der 85. Minute. Yverdon hatte mittel Handspenalty eine gute Viertelstunde vor Schluss ausgeglichen. Der FC St. Gallen verdiente sich den ersten Auswärtssieg in der Super League seit Februar mit vier Toren nach der Pause zum 5:2 bei Lausanne-Ouchy. Zwischen der 48. und 57. Minute trafen die Ostschweizer dreimal und machten aus dem 1:2 ein 4:2. Der Serbe Novak Djokovic gewinnt am Sonntagnachmittag im Final gegen den Bulgaren Grigor Dimitrov mit 6:4, 6:3. Nach 1:38 verwandelte der Serbe seinen ersten Matchball und siegte. Zuvor musste Djokovic ab dem Achtelfinal gegen den Niederländer Tallon Griekspoor, im Viertelfinal gegen den Titelverteidiger Holger Rune aus Dänemark sowie im Halbfinal gegen den Russen Andrej Rublew je drei Sätze spielen. Im Final reichten ihm zwei Sätze für den Sieg. Für Djokovic ist es im Turnier Paris-Bercy der 40. Masters-Sieg. Dank diesem Sieg kann er seine Führung auf der Weltrangliste weiter ausbauen und hat seine Rekordmarke weiter in die Höhe geschraubt. Hinter ihm liegt Rafael Nadal mit 36 Siegen und Roger Federer (28). Marcel Hug fuhr beim New York Marathon als erster durchs Ziel. Für den Thurgauer Rollstuhl-Leichathlet ist es das sechste Mal, als er diesen Marathon gewinnt. Doch nicht nur: Dieses Jahr gelang ihm alle sechs World Marathon Majors (Tokio, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago und New York) zu gewinnen. Das hat vor ihm noch niemand geschafft. Marcel Hug wins the 2023 and becomes the first person to win all six Abbott World Marathon Majors in one year. Neben Hug brillierten auch die Schweizer Frauen. Die Thurgauerin Catherine Debrunner fuhr mit einem Streckenrekord ins Ziel. Für sie ist es der erste New York Marathon. Hinter ihr erreichte Manuela Schär als Zweite das Ziel. Dem FC Luzern gelingt die Wiedergutmachung für die Blamage im Cup. Die Innerschweizer schlagen ihren Lieblingsgegner GC dank Teddy Okou und dem neuen, alten Captain Ardon Jashari mit 2:0. Elf Spiele und über 900 Spielminuten musste Okou auf seinen ersten Treffer in der Super League warten. In der letzten Saison hatte der Stürmer als Torschützenkönig mit seinen 19 Toren noch massgeblichen Anteil am Aufstieg von Lausanne-Ouchy gehabt. In Luzern war er in den ersten Monaten nur zweimal im Cup erfolgreich. Am Sonntagnachmittag gegen GC gelang Okou der kleine persönliche Befreiungsschlag. Von den Grasshoppers kam keine Reaktion. Nach dem 0:2 blieben die Zürcher, die seit 2014 nicht mehr in Luzern gewonnen haben, ohne nennenswerte Torchance. Das erste Team der Schweizer bildeten Anny Wu und Christian Baumann. Nach einem ersten guten Durchlauf lag das Duo auf dem zweiten Zwischenrang. Im zweiten Durchgang stürzten beide von ihren Geräten. So landeten sie am Schluss auf dem achten Rang. Noch schlechter erging es dem zweiten Team mit Florian Langenegger und Stefanie Siegenthaler. Sie beendeten den Swiss Cup auf dem letzten Platz. Brasilien bewirbt sich offiziell um die Austragung der Weltmeisterschaft der Fussballerinnen 2027 und tritt damit in Konkurrenz zu Deutschland. Eine von Präsident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva und Sportminister André Fufuca unterzeichnete Erklärung sei dem brasilianischen Nationalverband (CBF) und dem Weltverband FIFA übergeben worden, teilte die Regierung in der Nacht zum Sonntag mit. Die Erklärung werde von den sieben Regierungsgarantien begleitet, die die FIFA von Kandidatenländern verlange. Das südamerikanische Land wird damit Konkurrent von Deutschland, den Niederlanden und Belgien, die sich gemeinsam um die Ausrichtung des Turniers bewerben. Brasilien hat bisher zweimal (1950 und 2014) die Fussball-WM der Männer ausgerichtet. Auch Südafrika sowie das Duo USA und Mexiko, das gemeinsam mit Kanada bereits 2026 die Männer-WM austrägt, wollen sich bewerben. Eine Entscheidung soll am 17. Mai 2024 auf dem FIFA-Kongress in Bangkok fallen. Die Berner Ultracyclistin, überlegene Overall-Siegerin des Race Across America im Juni dieses Jahres, schafft in den USA erneut Ausserordentliches. Sie gewinnt Gold an den 24-Stunden- Weltmeisterschaften in Borrego Springs in Kalifornien. Die Physiotherapeutin aus Ittigen schaffte 725 km und erreichte auf dem flachen Rundkurs einen Stundenschnitt von 30,4 km/h. Im Gesamtklassement der Frauen und Männer reichte dies zu Platz 6. Noè Ponti überzeugte beim Meeting in Bozen mit einem Schweizer Rekord über 100 m Lagen. Der Tessiner schlug im 25-m-Becken nach 52,49 Sekunden an. Ponti fügte Jérémy Desplanches gleich eine doppelte Niederlage bei. Einerseits bezwang er bei seinem Sieg den Romand, der in diesem Rennen Dritter wurde, andererseits entriss er Desplanches den Schweizer Rekord aus dem Jahr 2017 um 34 Hundertstel. Ponti, der Olympia-Dritte von Tokio über 100 m Delfin, schwamm im Südtirol zudem zum Sieg über 50 m Delfin. Desplanches, der Olympia-Dritte über 200 m Lagen, stand über 50 m Brust als Zweiter auf dem Podest. Gleiches gelang Thierry Bollin über 100 m Rücken. Während Ambri-Piotta in der National League von Sieg zu Sieg fliegt, nimmt die Resultatkrise bei den Rapperswil-Jona Lakers kein Ende. Das sind die Fakten der Vollrunde vom Samstag. Im vierten Derby der Saison hat es für den EHC Biel endlich mit dem ersten Sieg gegen einen Kantonsrivalen geschafft. Kloten verpasste es nach dem überraschenden Derby-Heimsieg am Freitag gegen den ZSC nachzulegen. Beim 1:3 in Lugano schwammen den Gästen primär wegen defensiver Aussetzer früh die Felle davon. Zug gewann mit 3:2 nach Verlängerung auswärts gegen Genf-Servette auch das zweite Saisonduell zwischen den Meistern der letzten drei Jahre. Im Mittelpunkt stand mit Leon Muggli ein Youngster. Dem 17-jährigen Zuger Verteidiger gelang in der 3. Minute sein erstes Tor in der National League; sein drei Jahre älterer Bruder Tim liess sich dabei den zweiten Assist notieren. Der FC Zürich verliert erstmals in dieser Super-League-Saison. Durch das 0:2 daheim gegen das formstarke Servette muss der FCZ seine Tabellenführung an die Young Boys abgeben, die in Winterthur 4:1 gewinnen. Nach zwölf Spielen ohne Niederlage stand der FC Zürich gegen Servette auf verlorenem Posten. Die Genfer trafen durch Liga-Topskorer Chris Bedia (4.) und Steve Rouiller (63.) zum verdienten Sieg, dem fünften in Folge für das Team von René Weiler. Sébastien Buemi ist erneut Langstrecken-Weltmeister. Der 35-jährige Waadtländer und seine Toyota-Teamkollegen Brendon Hartley und Ryo Hirakawa liessen sich beim Saisonfinale in Bahrain nicht mehr von der Spitze der Gesamtwertung verdrängen. Das Trio wiederholte damit seinen Triumph aus dem Vorjahr. Wie es für Weltmeister gehört, beendete Buemi und Co. die Saison mit einem Sieg - dem zweiten im siebten Rennen (bei sechs Podestplätzen). Den 2. Platz im 8-Stunden-Rennen in Sakhir holten sich Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi und Jose Maria Lopez im anderen Toyota, die damit auch die WM-Wertung im 2. Rang abschlossen. Für Buemi ist es nach 2014, 2019 und 2022 bereits der vierte Titelgewinn in der Langstrecken-WM. Das sechste und letzte Sprintrennen dieser Formel-1-Saison wird zur Beute von Max Verstappen. Der Dominator im Red Bull triumphiert in São Paulo vor dem britischen Pole-Mann Lando Norris. Der aus der zweiten Position gestartete Verstappen übernahm im Autodromo José Carlos Pace noch vor der ersten Kurve die Spitze. «Das war wichtig, unmittelbar nach dem Start in Führung zu gehen. Danach war es eine Frage des Reifen-Managements. 24 Runden mit dem gleichen Satz sind sehr lang», sagte der 26-Jährige. Den Sieg brachte der bereits seit vier Wochen als Weltmeister feststehende Niederländer ohne grössere Mühe nach Hause. Tags zuvor im einzigen freien Training hatte sich sein Rennstall auf die Longruns konzentriert. Verstappen gewann zum siebten Mal ein Rennen über die verkürzte Distanz, zum vierten Mal in der laufenden Saison nach Spielberg, Francorchamps und Austin. Nach 24 Runden und gut 100 gefahrenen Kilometern betrug sein Vorsprung auf Norris im McLaren 4,3 Sekunden. Dritter wurde Verstappens Teamkollege Sergio Perez. Der Mexikaner war Ende April in Baku Sieger des ersten Sprintrennens der Saison geworden. Einmal mehr ohne Punkte blieben die Fahrer des Teams Alfa Romeo. Für den Chinesen Zhou Guanyu resultierte von Startplatz 18 der 17. Rang. Der aus Position 14 losgefahrene Finne Valtteri Bottas musste sich mit dem 19. Platz begnügen. Am Sonntag startet beim Grand Prix von Brasilien der 16-fache Saisonsieger Verstappen aus der Pole-Position. Neben dem dreifachen Weltmeister steht der Monegasse Charles Leclerc in der ersten Reihe. Der Start zum drittletzten Rennen des Jahres erfolgt um 18.00 Uhr Schweizer Zeit. Die 21-jährige Bernerin Ditaji Kambundji und der 25-jährige Baselbieter Jason Joseph wurden zu den Schweizer Leichtathleten des Jahres erkoren. Dies ist das Ergebnis einer Abstimmung von über 5000 Personen und einer elfköpfigen Fachjury. Die beiden Hürdenstars wurden am Samstag an der Swiss Athletics Night in Bern geehrt. Die Young Boys finden in der 13. Runde der Super League zurück zum Siegen. Die Berner gewinnen in Winterthur mit 4:1. Lausanne-Sport gelingt derweil die Revanche gegen Lugano für das Cup-Out. Obwohl YB nach der Roten Karte gegen Sandro Lauper über eine halbe Stunde lang in Unterzahl spielen musste, kam der Meister nach zuletzt zwei Remis in der Liga zu einem deutlichen Sieg. Joël Monteiro und Filip Ugrinic vor dem Platzverweis sowie Loris Benito und Meschack Elia danach schossen die Tore. Die zu wenig effizienten Winterthurer waren früh 1:0 in Führung gegangen. Lausanne-Sport gewann dank Toren von Samuel Kalu (71.), Brighton Labeau (80.) und Dominik Schwizer (94.) gegen Lugano daheim mit 3:1. Lugano, vor wenigen Tagen im Cup-Achtelfinal im gleichen Duell noch 4:0-Sieger, hatte kurz nach dem 0:1 durch Jonathan Sabbatini ausgeglichen. Die Tessiner spielten in den letzten 20 Minuten nach dem Platzverweis gegen Martim Marques nur noch zu zehnt. Die Schweizer Handball-Nationalmannschaft verliert beim Vierländerturnier in Tunesien auch das dritte Spiel. Zum Abschluss unterliegt das Team von Michael Suter Österreich mit 27:32. Das Spiel in Hammamet war lange umkämpft. In den Startminuten legten die Schweizer stets vor. Zur Pause lagen allerdings die Österreicher in Führung. In der zweiten Halbzeit konnten die Schweizer das Blatt noch einmal wenden, führten 21:20 und 23:22. Zum Sieg reichte es dennoch nicht. In der Schlussphase agierte Österreich cleverer und konnte das Skore gar noch deutlich gestalten. Während Österreich das Turnier in Tunesien mit zwei Siegen und einem Unentschieden gewann, beendete es die Schweiz nach der dritten Niederlage - am Donnerstag unterlag man dem Gastgeber 22:31 und am Freitag Portugal 26:29 - auf dem letzten Platz. Im Hinblick auf die am 10. Januar beginnende Europameisterschaft in Deutschland bleibt noch viel zu tun. Die Schweiz eröffnet das Turnier gegen den Gastgeber im Düsseldorfer Fussballstadion vor einer Weltrekord-Kulisse. Über 53’000 Tickets sind bereits verkauft. Im Vorfeld bestreitet die Nationalmannschaft noch den Yellow Cup vom 4. bis 6. Januar. Gegner in Winterthur sind Argentinien, Rumänien und Bosnien. Martina Voss-Tecklenburg kehrt wie erwartet nicht mehr als Nationaltrainerin der deutschen Fussballerinnen zurück. Der Vertrag mit der zuletzt pausierenden 55-Jährigen wurde aufgelöst. Die Deutsche, die zwischen 2012 und 2018 das Schweizer Nationalteam der Frauen betreut hatte, liess sich nach der enttäuschend verlaufenen WM in Australien und Neuseeland im August zunächst auf unbestimmte Zeit krankschreiben lassen, danach weilte sie in den Ferien. In einem Gespräch mit Martina Voss-Tecklenburg am Freitag kam der Verband nun zum Schluss, dass das Team einen personellen Neuanfang in der sportlichen Führung benötigt. Die Nachfolge ist noch nicht geklärt, derzeit betreut der 72-jährige Horst Hrubesch die Mannschaft interimistisch. Alexander Zverev und Holger Rune dürfen bei den ATP-Finals aufschlagen. Insbesondere der Deutsche profitierte von den Niederlagen gleich mehrerer Kontrahenten beim Masters-1000-Turnier in Paris. Der Olympiasieger krönt mit den ATP-Finals seine Comeback-Saison nach einer schweren Knöchelverletzung. Nach seinem Achtelfinal-Aus in Paris-Bercy musste er mit Blick auf die ATP-Finals, die am 12. November in Turin starten, zittern. Doch der 26-jährige Deutsche profitierte davon, dass der Pole Hubert Hurkacz und der von Boris Becker trainierte Rune ihre Viertelfinals verloren. Nach den Entwicklungen in Paris wird Rune, der Vorjahressieger beim Turnier an der Seine, trotz der Viertelfinal-Niederlage gegen Novak Djokovic bei den ATP-Finals spielen. Für den Saisonabschluss auf der Tour qualifizieren sich die Top 8 dieser Saison. Das Feld steht nun fest. Vor Zverev und Rune hatten schon Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medwedew, Jannik Sinner, Andrej Rublew und Stefanos Tsitsipas das Ticket gelöst. Seit über zwei Jahren hatte Ambri-Piotta in der heimischen Gottardo Arena nicht mehr gegen Lugano gewonnen und überhaupt nur einmal in den letzten acht Derby-Heimspielen. In einem Offensivspektakel setzten sich die formstarken Leventiner diesmal 5:4 durch und feierten erstmals in dieser Saison vier Siege in Folge. Floran Douay erzielte sein erster Tor im Ambri-Dress, Nando Eggenberger und Tommaso De Luca jeweils ihr zweites. Lugano, das zum dritten Mal in Serie verlor, reichte auch ein Hattrick des Kanadiers Michael Joly nicht. Nach vier Derbys ohne einen Punkt gewann der EHC Kloten mit einem 4:2 wieder einmal ein Derby gegen die ZSC Lions. Sie vermasselten dem grossen Rivalen damit nicht nur den Sprung an die Tabellenspitze, sondern schafften auch den Anschluss an den unteren Playoff-Strich. Es war erst der zweite Sieg in den letzten sieben Partien für das letztjährige Überraschungsteam. Der Kanadier Tyler Morley traf in der 48. Minute zum Siegtor - in Überzahl für das zweitschlechteste Powerplay der Liga. Zudem kehrte der Verteidiger und NHL-Erstrundendraft David Reinbacher nach 16 Spielen Verletzungspause zurück. Zwei Tore hatte Sean Malone in den ersten 18 Saisonspielen für die SCL Tigers erzielt, im kleinen Berner Derby schoss der Amerikaner den weiterhin arg ersatzgeschwächten Playoff-Finalisten Biel fast im Alleingang ab. Malone traf früh zum 1:0 und machte nach dem Ausgleich mit den Toren zum 2:1 und 3:1 seinen ersten Hattrick auf Schweizer Eis perfekt. Während die Langnauer erstmals seit Anfang Oktober zwei Siege in Folge feierten, hat Biel seit dem 23. September (3:0 gegen Davos) nicht mehr drei Punkte geholt und auswärts zum achten Mal in Folge verloren. Das abgeschlagene Schlusslicht Ajoie war für den SC Bern der ideale Gegner, um nach zwei Niederlagen zurück in die Spur zu finden. Allerdings verspielten die Berner einen Punkt auf fahrlässige Art, indem sie die Jurassier in den letzten sieben Minuten vom 3:1 auf 3:3 herankommen liessen. Ärgern muss sich aber auch Ajoie: In der Verlängerung kassierten sie eine Strafe wegen zu vielen Spielern auf dem Eis, was Corban Knight zum Siegtreffer nutzte. Negative Neuigkeiten gab es für den SCB hingegen auf der Goalieposition. Die Nummer 2 Philip Wüthrich fällt mit einer nicht näher definierten Verletzung rund zwei Monate aus. Die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers stecken in einem veritablen Tief. Das 2:4 gegen Genève-Servette war die achte Niederlage in den letzten zehn Spielen. Die St. Galler sind damit auf den 11. Platz abgerutscht. Der Meister aus Genf kehrte nach zwei Heimniederlagen zum Siegen zurück. Nach der deutlichen Auftaktniederlage beim Vierländerturnier in Tunesien gegen den Gastgeber verliert das Schweizer Nationalteam auch die zweite Partie. Gegen Portugal setzt es eine vermeidbare 26:29-Niederlage ab. Vor allem in der Defensive zeigte sich das Team von Nationalcoach Michael Suter im Vergleich zum Spiel gegen Tunesien stark verbessert. Nach einem schlechten Start fingen sich die Schweizer und rissen die Führung dank einem Vier-Tore-Lauf an sich. Mit einem Zwei-Tore-Polster ging es in die Pause. Die Partie blieb auch nach dem Seitenwechsel äusserst umkämpft. Der erneut starke Goalie Nikola Portner, der 14 Paraden zeigte, hielt sein Team lange im Spiel. Trotz 25:23-Führung kurz vor dem Ende mussten sich die Schweizer mit 26:29 geschlagen geben. Bester Werfer war Kreisspieler Lukas Laube mit sechs Toren. Der Kreisläufer des TVB Stuttgart musste rund zehn Minuten vor Schluss mit Rot und der dritten Zweiminutenstrafe frühzeitig vom Feld. Für die Schweiz geht das Vierländerturnier am Samstag (14.30 Uhr) mit dem Spiel gegen Österreich zu Ende. Jeanine Gmelin kehrt in den Profi-Rudersport zurück. Die 33-jährige Zürcherin hatte zu Beginn des Jahres ihren Rücktritt erklärt, nachdem ihr Trainer und Lebenspartner Robin Dowell auf einer Trainingsfahrt unerwartet verstarb. Nun steigt sie wieder ins Boot. «Paris 2024 ist mein Ziel. Diese Entscheidung ist über Monate gereift und war nur möglich dank des Supports und der Wertschätzung, die mir mein Umfeld, meine Partnerinnen und Partner entgegengebracht haben», so Gmelin in einer Mitteilung. Als erstes wolle sie nun wieder ihren Kaderstatus erkämpfen und verbandsinterne Leistungstests bestehen. Gmelin feierte 2017 ihren grössten Erfolg, als sie Weltmeisterin im Skiff wurde. Der ehemalige Velo-Profi Michael Schär bleibt dem Radsport erhalten. Der 37-jährige Luzerner, der nach 18 Jahre als Profi zum Ende dieser Saison zurückgetreten war, wird Sportdirektor. Er wird seine Erfahrung bei der amerikanischen Equipe von Lidl-Trek einbringen. «Der Radsport ist meine Welt und ich möchte ihm verbunden bleiben», sagte Schär bei der Rücktrittsverkündung im Mai. Nun ist klar, wo er seine Laufbahn fortsetzt. Die Uefa wird ab 2024 gemeinsam mit dem französischen Medienkonzern Groupe Amaury den prestigeträchtigen Ballon d’Or organisieren. Das teilte die Europäische Fussball-Union am Freitag mit. Der Ballon d’Or wird seit 1956 jährlich durch die zur Groupe Amaury gehörende Fachzeitschrift «France Football» vergeben. Am vergangenen Montag war Argentiniens Weltmeister Lionel Messi zum achten Mal mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet worden. Die Groupe Amaury werde Eigentümerin der Marke bleiben und das unveränderte Abstimmungsverhalten weiter überwachen. «Die Uefa wird ihre Fussballexpertise einbringen, die weltweiten kommerziellen Rechte vermarkten und die jährliche Galaveranstaltung organisieren», teilte der Verband mit. Zudem werden zwei neue Auszeichnungen mit ins Programm aufgenommen: Gewählt werden ab 2024 auch die Trainerin und der Trainer des Jahres. Der Ballon d’Or ist kein Ersatz für die Weltfussballer-Wahl. Diese Wahl wird weiterhin vom Weltverband Fifa veranstaltet. Von 2010 bis 2015 wurde der Weltfussballer durch eine Kooperation der Fifa und «France Football» mit dem Goldenen Ball ausgezeichnet. Der kriselnde FC Basel muss vorerst ohne Innenverteidiger Adrian Barisic auskommen. Der 22-jährige Internationale aus Bosnien-Herzegowina musste am Mittwoch beim Sieg im Cup-Achtelfinal in Kriens mit einer Knieverletzung ausgewechselt werden. Medizinische Untersuchen führten zwar keine schwerwiegende Verletzung zu Tage, gemäss dem FCB wird Barisic dem Klub aber «wohl ein paar Wochen» fehlen. In der Super League stand Barisic in den letzten sieben Spielen durchgehend in der Startformation der am Tabellenende klassierten Basler. Belinda Bencic und ihr Freund und Fitnesscoach Martin Hromkovic erwarten ihr erstes Kind. Die 26-jährige Ostschweizerin verkündete die frohe Botschaft auf Instagram: «Wir erwarten unser kleines Wunder», schrieb die Olympiasiegerin. Die Tennisspielerin ist seit 2018 mit dem 41-jährigen Slowaken Hromkovic liiert. Zu den Zukunftsplänen der Weltnummer 14 war zunächst nichts bekannt. Klar ist, dass sie kommende Woche beim in Sevilla steigenden Billie Jean King Cup im Schweizer Aufgebot steht. Ob sie dann auch zum Einsatz kommt, ist noch offen. Die 26-Jährige stand letztmals am 11. September in San Diego auf dem Platz. Aufgrund einer Lebensmittelvergiftung musste sie danach pausieren. Mit Roman Josi, Timo Meier und Pius Suter reihen sich in der Nacht auf Freitag in der NHL gleich drei Schweizer unter die Torschützen ein. Trotz dem zweiten Saisongoal von Roman Josi verloren die Nashville Predators ihr Auswärtsspiel gegen die Seattle Kraken 2:4. Der Berner Verteidiger erzielte in der 37. Minute mit einer schönen Direktabnahme im Powerplay den 2:2-Ausgleich. Nur 24 Sekunden später ging Seattle jedoch erneut in Führung und brachte diese über die Zeit. Auch Timo Meier in Diensten der New Jersey Devils traf in Überzahl und ebenfalls zum zweiten Mal in dieser Saison. Das 3:0 des Appenzellers beim 5:3-Auswärtssieg gegen die Minnesota Wild war wegweisend. Für die Devils war es der fünfte Sieg aus den letzten sechs Spielen. Während bei New Jersey Jesper Bratt mit vier Skorerpunkten (davon 1 Tor) glänzte, fehlte Captain Nico Hischier weiterhin verletzt.Pius Suter traf in seinem neunten Spiel für die Vancouver Canucks zum ersten Mal. Mit dem Tor zum 8:0 in der 38. Minute trug der Zürcher Drittlinien-Center beim 10:1-Kantersieg seines Teams auswärts gegen die desolat auftretenden San Jose Sharks zum Spektakel bei. Vancouvers Captain Quinn Hughes überzeugte mit einem Tor und vier Assists. Derweil bleiben die Sharks als einziges Team der Liga ohne Sieg. Der Regen machte am Donnerstag in Cancun, dem Schauplatz der WTA Finals, einen Strich durch die Rechnung. Das entscheidende Duell in der Gruppe A zwischen Aryna Sabalenka und Elena Rybakina konnte nicht zu Ende gespielt werden. Sabalenka, die Nummer 1 der Welt, lag nach gewonnenem Startsatz (6:2) im zweiten Durchgang bei Aufschlag Rybakina 3:5 hinten, als der Match abgebrochen werden musste. Die Siegerin dieses Duells wird den 2. Platz in der Gruppe belegen und das Ticket für die Halbfinals erhalten. Die Partie soll am späten Freitagnachmittag mexikanischer Zeit fortgesetzt werden. Jessica Pegula (ATP 5), die nach Siegen gegen die Belarussin und die Kasachin als Gruppensiegerin feststand, liess sich im ersten Einzelspiel des Tages nicht lange bitten. Die Amerikanerin besiegte die Griechin Maria Sakkari (WTA 9) in 80 Minuten mit 6:3, 6:2 und beendete die Vorrunde ungeschlagen. Union Berlins Trainer Urs Fischer wird wegen seiner Roten Karte im Anschluss an das Ausscheiden im DFB-Pokal beim VfB Stuttgart für ein Cupspiel gesperrt. Der Schweizer hatte den Schiedsrichter Sascha Stegemann aus Ärger über einen Entscheid nach der Partie konfrontiert, nach eigener Aussage aber nicht beleidigt. Auf die Spiele in der Bundesliga hat die Sperre keine Auswirkungen. Die tunesische Tennisspielerin Ons Jabeur (WTA 7) möchte einen Teil ihres Preisgeldes von den WTA-Finals in Cancun den Menschen in Palästina spenden. «Es ist sehr hart, jeden Tag Kinder und Babys sterben zu sehen. Es ist herzzerreissend», so Jabeur. Die 29-Jährige betonte dabei, dass es sich nicht um ein politisches Statement handle. Sie wolle Frieden in dieser Welt. Das sagte die ehemalige Weltranglistenzweite, nachdem sie sich im zweiten Gruppenspiel gegen die Tschechin Marketa Vondrousova mit 6:4, 6:3 durchsetzte. Joe Thornton kehrt nach seinem vor wenigen Tagen offizialisierten Rücktritt erneut nach Davos zurück. Der 44-jährige Kanadier amtet als Co-Trainer des Teams Canada, das in der Altjahreswoche den Spengler Cup bestreitet. Thornton, der während der NHL-Lockouts von 2004 und 2012 sowie als Leihspieler 2020 für den HCD gespielt hat und mit einer Davoserin verheiratet ist, wird die Kanadier zusammen mit Brad Pascall betreuen, dem Assistenztrainer der Calgary Flames. Assistiert werden die beiden von Luganos Sportchef Hnat Domenichelli. Beim am 26. Dezember beginnenden Spengler Cup trifft das Team Canada vorerst auf die Gruppengegner Frölunda aus Schweden und Gastgeber Davos. Die andere Gruppe bilden Ambri-Piotta, Pardubice aus Tschechien und Kalpa Kuopio aus Finnland. Die serbische Fussball-Nationalmannschaft muss im abschliessenden Heimspiel in der EM-Qualifikation gegen Bulgarien am 19. November ohne Zuschauer auskommen. Wegen rassistischer Vorfälle beim letzten Heimspiel gegen Montenegro (3:1) bestraft die Uefa den Verband mit einem «Geisterspiel». Serbien kämpft in Gruppe G noch um die EM-Teilnahme. Derzeit liegt das Team hinter Ungarn auf dem 2. Platz. Gespielt wird am 27./ 28./ oder 29. Februar 2024. Der FC Bayern reibt sich am Drittligisten Saarbrücken auf. Bis in die Schlussphase ist die Partie offen. Dann der Schock für die Münchner Stars. Völlig bedient standen die Stars des FC Bayern auf dem Rasen, während die Aussenseiter des 1. FC Saarbrücken ihren Coup ausgelassen feierten. Der Münchner Fussball-Rekordsieger ist im DFB-Pokal schon wieder weit vor dem Finale gescheitert. Auf dem tiefen Boden des Ludwigsparkstadions verlor das Team von Thomas Tuchel am Mittwochabend bei dem Drittligisten mit 1:2 (1:1). Drei Tage vor dem Bundesliga-Kracher bei Borussia Dortmund taten sich die Bayern in dem wegen der vielen Regenfälle lange gefährdeten Zweitrundenspiel mehr als schwer. «Ich kann es nicht glauben, das ist Wahnsinn», sagte Saarbrückens Torwart Tim Schreiber. «Einfach geil!». Vor 16 000 Zuschauern traf erst Thomas Müller (16.) für die Bayern, Stürmerstar Harry Kane wurde von Tuchel geschont. Patrick Sontheimer (45.+1) glich noch vor der Pause für den Drittligisten aus - und dann schoss Marcel Gaus (90.+6) den Aussenseiter ins Glück. Eine Knieverletzung von Matthijs de Ligt trübte den Abend der Bayern zusätzlich, die den Pokal zuletzt 2020 gewonnen hatten. FC Rapperswil-Jona - YB 0:2 Black Stars - FC Winterthur 2:6 Servette FC - FC Stade-Lausanne-Ouchy 4:1 n.P. SC Kriens - FC Basel 0:1 FC Lausanne-Sport - FC Lugano 0:4 SR Delémont - FC Luzern 1:0 Der FC Basel setzte in Kriens, beim Ligakonkurrenten von Delémont, nicht zu einem spielerischen Feuerwerk an, aber schaffte die Hauptsache: Er traf endlich wieder einmal und gewann mit 1:0. Djordje Jovanovic verwertete mit dem Kopf eine Flanke von Dominik Schmid und beendete damit die Torflaute des FC Basel nach über 400 Minuten. Für Fabio Celestini, den Nachfolger von Heiko Vogel auf der FCB-Trainerbank, war es in gelungener Einstand. Die Young Boys erfüllten ohne zu brillieren, aber auch ohne zu zittern gegen Rapperswil-Jona mit dem 2:0 die Pflicht. Die St. Galler verpassten es daheim vor 3150 Zuschauern, in den ersten Minuten der zweiten Halbzeit einen Treffer zu erzielen. Der Klub aus der Promotion League liess gleich eine ganze Reihe von guten Chancen ungenutzt, einmal parierte YB-Keeper David von Ballmoos sehr stark. YB reagierte auf die Druckphase des Unterklassigen humorlos mit dem 2:0 von Saidy Janko (57.). Den ersten Treffer hatte Jean-Pierre Nsame schon in der 2. Minute erzielt. Auch der FC Winterthur wurde seiner Favoritenrolle gerecht. Die Zürcher gewannen beim Basler Erstligisten Black Stars unter anderem dank zweier Tore von Nishan Burkart mit 6:2. Bis in die 38. Minute hielten sich die Unterklassigen schadlos, dann kassierten sie bis kurz vor Schluss sechs Tore und schliesslich sorgten sie mit zwei Treffern in der Schlussphase noch für einen versöhnlichen Abschluss ihres ersten Cup-Achtelfinals der Vereinsgeschichte. Servette musste im Westschweizer Duell mit Lausanne-Ouchy trotz Überlegenheit das Penaltyschiessen abwarten, um zum ersten Mal seit 18 Jahren einen Super-League-Klub im Cup zu eliminieren. Lausanne-Ouchy konnte auf das 1:0 von Servette durch Topskorer Chris Bedia (73.) durch Mergim Qarri (84.) reagieren. Im Penaltyschiessen trafen alle Genfer, unter ihnen Bedia, aber nur ein Lausanner. In der ersten Halbzeit hatte der Servettien Jérémy Guillemenot noch einen Elfmeter verschossen. Das andere Achtelfinal-Duell zwischen Super-League-Klubs wurde zur klaren Angelegenheit: Lugano setzte sich bei Lausanne-Sport ohne Mühe mit 4:0 durch. Die Tessiner, Cupsieger 2022 und Finalist 2023, haben von den letzten 15 Partien im Cup nur das Endspiel der Vorsaison gegen YB verloren. In Lausanne kam den Luganesi entgegen, dass die Gastgeber schon ab der 5. Minute mit einem Spieler weniger auskommen musste. Raoul Giger sah für eine gefährliches Foul die Rote Karte. Lugano spielte danach routiniert und führte schon zur Pause mit 2:0. Renato Steffen brillierte als Vorbereiter von Shkelqim Vladis 1:0 und als Penalty-Torschütze zum 2:0. Der Meister Genève-Servette verliert nach und nach seinen Status als stärkste Heimmannschaft der neuen Saison. Die Genfer unterlagen am Mittwochabend gegen Davos 1:2. Dortmund und Leverkusen stehen nach Siegen über Hoffenheim respektive Sandhausen im Achtelfinal des deutschen Cups. Freiburg muss nach einer Heimpleite gegen Zweitligist Paderborn bereits in der 2. Runde die Segel streichen. Borussia Dortmund zog im Duell zweier Bundesligisten gegen Hoffenheim dank eines Treffers von Routinier Marco Reus in die Achtelfinals ein. Das Team von Gregor Kobel ist nach dem 1:0-Sieg und vor dem Gipfeltreffen vom Samstag gegen Bayern München saison- und wettbewerbsübergreifend seit 26 Heimspielen ungeschlagen. Erstaunlich viel Mühe bekundete Bundesliga-Leader Leverkusen beim 5:2 über Drittligist Sandhausen. Die auf mehreren Positionen rotierte «Werkself» musste in der zweiten Halbzeit zweimal den Ausgleich hinnehmen, ehe Nati-Captain Granit Xhaka ins Geschehen eingriff. Die Entscheidung führte der Favorit erst in den letzten fünf Minuten der Partie herbei. Eine herbe 1:3-Heimpleite kassierte Freiburg gegen Zweitligist Paderborn. Letztmals so früh ausgeschieden ist das Team von Trainer Christian Streich vor drei Jahren. Vergangene Saison stiessen die Breisgauer bis in den Halbfinal vor, 2022 standen sie gar im Final. Der Schweizer Nationaltrainer Patrick Fischer hat für den Karjala Cup vom 9. bis 12. November in Tampere in Finnland 26 Spieler aufgeboten. Dem Kader gehört mit dem Stürmer Marco Lehmann vom SC Bern ein Debütant an. Der Schweizer Tross reist zwecks optimaler Vorbereitung am Montag nach Finnland. Das erste Spiel bestreitet Fischers Equipe am Donnerstag gegen Finnland. Am Samstag und am Sonntag folgen die Partien gegen Schweden beziehungsweise Tschechien. «Zum Aufgebot gehört ein grosser Teil der letzten WM-Mannschaft», sagt Fischer. «Wir wollen den WM-Spirit wieder aufnehmen und dort weiterarbeiten, wo wir vor dem Sommer aufgehört haben.» Aus Rücksicht auf die Mannschaften, die in der Champions Hockey League mitspielen, hat der Coach auf verschiedene Spieler dieser Vereine verzichtet. Die SCL Tigers verpflichten den Center Joshua Fahrni vom Kantonsrivalen SC Bern. Der 21-Jährige, der bereits 128 Spiele in der National League absolviert hat und sechs Mal für die A-Nationalmannschaft auf dem Eis stand, unterschrieb bis in den Frühling 2026. Der EHC Kloten verstärkt sein Kader mit dem Kanadier Nathan Beaulieu. Die Verpflichtung des 30-jährigen Verteidigers erfolgt nur einen Tag nach dem Abgang des Schweden Lucas Ekestahl-Jonsson. Beaulieu, der einen bis Ende Saison gültigen Vertrag unterzeichnet hat, bringt grosse Erfahrung aus der NHL mit. In der weltbesten Liga hat er beinahe 500 Partien bestritten. Die letzte Saison hat er für die Anaheim Ducks gespielt. Die Schweizer Weltmeisterinnen reisen mit fünf Spielerinnen zum Finalturnier des Billie Jean King Cups von nächster Woche in Sevilla. Bereits am Donnerstag fliegt das Schweizer Team nach Spanien - mit dem Ziel, den Vorjahressieg zu wiederholen. Auch die zuletzt unter den Nachwehen einer Lebensmittelvergiftung leidende Belinda Bencic (WTA 14) ist dabei. Die Olympiasiegerin musste seit Mitte September pausieren. Weiter bot Captain Heinz Günthardt neben den bereits bekannten Viktorija Golubic (WTA 83), Jil Teichmann (WTA 142) und Debütantin Céline Naef (WTA 137) mit der letztjährigen Finalistin Simona Waltert (WTA 167) eine fünfte Spielerin auf. Die Schweiz startet am Dienstag gegen Tschechien ins Turnier, zwei Tage später folgt die zweite Partie in der Dreiergruppe gegen die USA. Nur der Sieger der Gruppe erreicht die Halbfinals. Die Schweizer Eishockey-Nationalmannschaft bekommt es an den Olympischen Spielen 2026 in Mailand voraussichtlich mit Rekord-Olympiasieger Kanada, Schweden und Gastgeber Italien zu tun. Die Gruppeneinteilung für die Vorrunde basiert auf der Annahme, dass Russland sowie das in der Qualifikation gesetzte Belarus 2026 zu den Winterspielen zugelassen sind. Sollten die beiden Nationen aufgrund des Angriffskrieges gegen die Ukraine vom olympischen Turnier ausgeschlossen werden, hat eine Neueinteilung zu erfolgen. Ein Entscheid des Weltverbandes IIHF über eine Teilnahme respektive einen Ausschluss von Russland und Belarus soll im Frühjahr 2024 fallen. Die Gruppeneinteilung für die Vorrunde erfolgt gemäss der Weltrangliste, in der die Schweiz den 7. Rang belegt. Die Top 8 sind für das Olympia-Turnier gesetzt. Die restlichen drei Plätze neben dem Gastgeber Italien werden im Spätsommer 2024 in Qualifikationsturnieren ermittelt. Bei einem Ausschluss Russlands würde die Slowakei als Weltranglisten-Neunte als Fix-Starter nachrücken. Das wegen des Nahost-Konfliktes verschobene EM-Qualifikationsspiel zwischen Israel und der Schweiz wird im ungarischen Felcsut stattfinden. Das entschied die UEFA in Absprache mit dem israelischen Verband. Felcsut ist 50 Kilometer von Budapest entfernt. Das Stadion, die vor knapp zehn Jahren eingeweihte Pancho Arena, zählt 4000 Plätze. Die ursprünglich für den 12. Oktober terminierte Partie was schon vor einiger Zeit auf Mittwoch, 15. November verschoben worden. Danach musste ein neuer Austragungsort gefunden werden, weil bis auf Weiteres keine internationalen Spiele in Israel durchgeführt werden. Mitte November wartet auf die Schweizer Nationalmannschaft ein dichtes Programm mit den EM-Qualifikationsspielen gegen Israel in Felcsut (15.11.), gegen Kosovo in Basel (18.11.) und zum Abschluss der Kampagne gegen Rumänien in Bukarest (21.11.). Der neue Trainer von Aufsteiger Yverdon heisst Alessandro Mangiarratti. Der 45-jährige Tessiner tritt die Nachfolge des am Montag entlassenen Marco Schällibum an. Mangiarratti wird am Donnerstag offiziell vorgestellt. Er werde die Spielerentwicklung zu einer seiner Hauptaufgaben machen, schrieb der Verein. Mangarriatti arbeitete zuletzt beim FC Vaduz, den er überraschend in die Gruppenphase der Conference League führte. Im November 2022 wurde er bei den Liechtensteinern entlassen. Yverdon belegt in der Super League mit 16 Punkten aus zwölf Partien den 8. Tabellenrang. Am Sonntag treffen die Waadtländer auswärts auf Basel, das ebenfalls in dieser Woche den Trainer gewechselt hat. Der EV Zug verpflichtet den Torhüter Tim Wolf. Der 31-Jährige wechselt auf die kommende Saison nach fünf Jahren beim HC Ajoie zu den Innerschweizern. Er unterschrieb einen Vertrag über zwei Jahre als Nummer 2 hinter dem siebenfachen Meistergoalie Leonardo Genoni. Mit der Verpflichtung von Wolf ist klar, dass Luca Hollenstein den EVZ verlassen wird. Er dürfte sich dem HC Davos anschliessen. Der FC Basel entlässt per sofort Heiko Vogel als Trainer. Zwei Tage nach der 3:0-Niederlage gegen Lausanne-Sport kam der Klub zum Entschluss den Trainer zu entlassen. Dies gab der Klub am Dienstagmorgen in einer Medienmitteilung bekannt. Die Nachfolge ist ebenfalls bereits geregelt: Für Vogel übernimmt der 48-jährige Fabio Celestini. Er war zuletzt bis im März 2023 beim FC Sion als Trainer angestellt. Künftig steht er beim FCB an der Seitenlinie. Australien wird sich nicht für die Fussball-Weltmeisterschaft der Männer 2034 bewerben und macht damit den Weg für Saudi-Arabien frei. «Wir haben die Möglichkeit geprüft, uns um die Ausrichtung der FIFA Fussball-WM zu bewerben, und sind nach Abwägung aller Faktoren zu dem Schluss gekommen, dies für den Wettbewerb 2034 nicht zu tun», teilte der australische Fussball-Verband FA am Dienstag mit. An diesem Dienstag läuft die Frist für eine Interessenbekundung beim Weltverband FIFA ab. Saudi-Arabien hat seine Absicht bereits klargemacht und gilt als klarer Favorit. Anfang Oktober hatte bereits die Asiatische Fussballkonföderation (AFC) eine saudische Bewerbung unterstützt. Nachdem dann über eine gemeinsame Bewerbung von Australien, Indonesien und Neuseeland oder von Australien, Indonesien, Malaysia und Singapur spekuliert worden war, bekundete Indonesien aber ebenfalls die Unterstützung für Saudi-Arabien. Dadurch sanken die ohnehin geringen Chancen der Australier gen Null. In der Erklärung des australischen Verbandes wurde Saudi-Arabien aber weder erwähnt noch die Bewerbung des Golfstaates unterstützt. Am zweiten Tag der WTA Finals im mexikanischen Cancun gab es zwei Favoritensiege. Die Polin Iga Swiatek (WTA 2) bezwang die tschechische Wimbledon-Siegerin Marketa Vondrousova (WTA 6) nach einem 2:5-Rückstand 7:6 (7:3), 6:0. Die amerikanische US-Open-Gewinnerin Coco Gauff (WTA 3) fertige die Tunesierin Ons Jabeur (WTA 7) 6:0, 6:1 ab. Es war für die 19-Jährige der 50. Sieg in dieser Saison. Am Mittwoch Ortszeit kommt es zum Duell zwischen Swiatek und Gauff. Stan Wawrinka (ATP 51) ist auch beim Masters-1000-Turnier in Paris in der ersten Runde ausgeschieden. Der 38-jährige Waadtländer unterlag dem Österreicher Dominic Thiem (ATP 108) nach 2:31 Stunden mit 6:3, 3:6, 5:7. Die Partie war erst um 2.22 Uhr morgens zu Ende. Wawrinka vergab im Duell zweier Sieger von Grand-Slam-Turnieren beim Stand von 5:3 und 40:30 im dritten Satz mit einem Doppelfehler einen Matchball. Überhaupt erlebt er einen schwierigen Herbst. Es war für ihn die vierte Erstrundenniederlage in den letzten fünf Turnieren, die zweite in Serie nach jener in Basel. Nächste Woche tritt er in Metz an, dort erreichte er im vergangenen Jahr die Halbfinals. Einen Tag nach dem Sieg in Milwaukee setzten sich die Atlanta Hawks mit Clint Capela in der NBA mit 127:113 auch gegen die Minnesota Timberwolves durch. Zur Halbzeit sah es noch danach aus, als würden die Hawks auch im dritten Heimspiel der Saison das Parkett als Verlierer verlassen, lagen sie doch 60:79 in Rückstand. Dann aber drehten die Gastgeber auf, womit sie nun mit je zwei Siegen und Niederlagen eine ausgeglichene Bilanz haben. Capela kam in den letzten knapp 17 Minuten des Spiels nicht mehr zum Einsatz. Er musste sich mit zwei Punkten und fünf Rebounds begnügen. Grossen Anteil am Sieg von Atlanta hatte Dejounte Murray, der mit 41 Zählern den persönlichen Punkterekord in der NBA egalisierte. Beim 125:110-Sieg der Dallas Mavericks bei den Memphis Grizzlies gelang Luka Doncic sein 58. Triple-Double in der besten Basketball-Liga der Welt. Der Slowene verzeichnete 35 Punkte sowie je zwölf Rebounds und Assists. Verteidiger Janis Moser feierte in der NHL mit den Arizona Coyotes einen 8:1-Kantersieg gegen die Chicago Blackhawks mit Philipp Kuraschew. Beide Schweizer blieben ohne Skorerpunkt. Michael Carcone (3 Tore/1 Assist) und Jack McBain (2/2) verzeichneten je vier Skorerpunkte. Das Tor für Chicago zum 1:0 erzielte nach 28 Sekunden der 18-jährige Connor Bedard, der in seinem neunten NHL-Spiel zum vierten Mal erfolgreich war. Nino Niederreiter verlor mit den Winnipeg Jets zu Hause gegen die New York Rangers 2:3 nach Verlängerung. Der Churer Stürmer trug sich nach vier Punkten in den vorangegangenen zwei Partien diesmal nicht in die Skorerliste ein. Das entscheidende Tor für die Gäste schoss Mika Zibanejad 26 Sekunden vor dem Ende der Verlängerung. Artemi Panarin, der für das 1:0 (19.) der Rangers verantwortlich zeichnete, hatte bei allen drei Toren seines Teams den Stock im Spiel. Titelverteidiger Vegas Golden Knights gelang im zehnten Saisonspiel der neunte Sieg - 3:2 nach Penaltyschiessen gegen die Montreal Canadiens. Auch die Boston Bruins haben nach dem 3:2 gegen die Florida Panthers weiterhin erst ein Spiel in der laufenden Meisterschaft (8 Erfolge) verloren. Der am Montag in Yverdon entlassene Marco Schällibaum wurde von der Swiss Football League für vier Spiele gesperrt. Der Zürcher büsst für sein Fehlverhalten im Heimspiel gegen Winterthur (1:1). Er habe die technische Zone verlassen mit der Absicht zu provozieren und aufzuhetzen, heisst es von Seiten der Liga. Zudem beleidigte er einen Spieler von Winterthur Lausannes Offensivspieler Chris Kablan wurde für drei Partien gesperrt, nachdem er im Heimspiel gegen Basel (3:0) kurz nach seiner Einwechslung in der Schlussphase die Rote Karten gesehen hatte. Er leistete sich ein grobes Foul mit hohem Verletzungsrisiko. Yverdons Christopher Lungoyi wird nebst der einen Sperre wegen zweier Gelber Karten gegen Winterthur womöglich weiter bestraft. Gegen den Flügelspieler wurde ein Verfahren eröffnet, weil er nach dem Schlusspfiff eine unangebrachte Geste in Richtung von Schiedsrichter Nico Gianforte machte. Der FSV Mainz 05 ermöglicht dem zunächst freigestellten Fussballprofi Anwar El Ghazi nun doch eine Rückkehr. Der 28 Jahre alte Holländer kehre zeitnah in den Trainings- und Spielbetrieb zurück, gab der Bundesligist am Montag bekannt. El Ghazi werde für die Veröffentlichung eines Beitrages in den sozialen Medien vor zwei Wochen abgemahnt. Die Mainzer hatten zunächst mit Härte auf einen inzwischen wieder gelöschten Pro-Palästina-Post von El Ghazi bei Instagram reagiert. «Vor dem Hintergrund des erfolgten Commitments El Ghazis und der von ihm gezeigten Reue, gebietet es die im Verein verankerte Kultur im Umgang mit Fehlern, dem Spieler eine Chance zur Rehabilitation einzuräumen», hiess es in einer Mitteilung der Mainzer. Das in dieser Saison noch sieglose Tabellenschlusslicht hat derzeit wegen diverser Ausfälle nur noch wenige Stürmer zur Verfügung. Der ehemalige Fussball-Profi John van ’t Schip soll den holländischen Tabellenletzten Ajax Amsterdam als neuer Trainer aus der Krise führen. Wie der Rekordmeister aus der Eredivisie am Montag mitteilte, erhält der 59-Jährige für diesen Job einen Vertrag bis zum Ende der laufenden Saison. Anschliessend soll er ein weiteres Jahr im Management von Ajax arbeiten. Van ’t Schip spielte von 1981 bis 1992 bereits für die Amsterdamer und begann nach seiner aktiven Karriere eine Laufbahn als Trainer. Amsterdam hatte sich in der Vorwoche nach dem schlechtesten Saisonstart der Vereinsgeschichte vom bisherigen Chefcoach Maurice Steijn getrennt. Zunächst hatte Steijns Assistent Hedwiges Maduro eine Woche als Trainer fungiert und wird nun wieder die Rolle als Co-Trainer übernehmen. Ajax verbuchte im Saisonverlauf in der höchsten Liga der Niederlande bislang erst einen Sieg und holte in acht Begegnungen lediglich fünf Punkte. Am Sonntag setzte es ein 2:5 bei Spitzenreiter PSV Eindhoven. Wie die welsche Zeitung «24 heures» berichtet, trennt sich der Super-League-Klub Yverdon von seinem Trainer Marco Schällibaum. Das ist überraschend. Schliesslich ist der 61-jährige Zürcher mit den Waadtländern in der vergangenen Saison überraschend aufgestiegen. Und selbst in der höchsten Spielklasse hat Yverdon bislang eher positiv überrascht. Obwohl als Aussenseiter angetreten, belegt Yverdon nach 12 Runden den achten Platz. Nach dem Kuss-Skandal hat die Fifa den ehemaligen spanischen Verbandspräsidenten Luis Rubiales für drei Jahre gesperrt. Durch die Entscheidung der Disziplinarkommission wird der 46-Jährige für jegliche Fussballtätigkeit auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene ausgeschlossen. Dies gab der Weltverband am Montag bekannt. Laut Fifa habe Rubiales mit seinem Verhalten bei der Siegerehrung des WM-Finals im August gegen Artikel 13 des Disziplinarreglements verstossen. Der Spanier hatte Nationalspielerin Jennifer Hermoso nach dem Endspielsieg gegen England in Sydney übergriffig auf den Mund geküsst. Der Fall löste weltweit einen Sturm der Entrüstung aus. Die Fifa hatte Rubiales zunächst provisorisch für 90 Tage suspendiert. Unter grossem Druck trat er erst nach einiger Zeit von seinem Posten als Chef des spanischen Verbandes RFEF zurück. Die Weltmeisterinnen um Hermoso waren zwischenzeitlich in den Streik getreten. Auch die spanischen Behörden beschäftigen sich mit dem Fall. Am Montag wird in Paris zum 67. Mal der Ballon d’Or vergeben. Bei den Männern läuft es wohl auf einen Zweikampf zwischen Lionel Messi und Erling Haaland hinaus. Messi könnte bei der Ehrung von seiner überragenden WM in Katar Ende vergangenen Jahres profitieren. Haaland war indes mit seinen vielen Toren massgeblich daran beteiligt, dass Manchester City erstmals die Champions League gewann und dazu auch die Meisterschaft und den FA Cup. Bei den Frauen darf sich die spanische Weltmeisterin Aitana Bonmati grosse Hoffnungen auf die Auszeichnung machen, die von der Fachzeitschrift France Football vergeben wird. e New Jersey Devils feiern in der NHL im achten Saisonspiel den fünften Sieg. Sie bezwingen zu Hause die Minnesota Wild 4:3. Timo Meier bereitete im Powerplay mit einem Querpass das 4:2 von Doppel-Torschütze Jesper Bratt vor. Der Appenzeller Stürmer punktete in der fünften Partie in Serie und hält nun bei sieben Skorerpunkten (ein Treffer) in der laufenden Meisterschaft. Verteidiger Jonas Siegenthaler erhielt bei New Jersey mit 21:40 Minuten am zweitmeisten Einsatzzeit und verliess das Eis mit einer Plus-1-Bilanz. Captain Nico Hischier fehlte den Devils wegen einer im Spiel zuvor gegen die Buffalo Sabres erlittenen Oberkörperverletzung, Goalie Akira Schmid war Ersatz. Die hoch gehandelten Edmonton Oilers kamen nach vier Niederlagen zum zweiten Saisonsieg. Evander Kane steuerte ein Tor und zwei Assists zum 5:2 vor heimischem Publikum gegen die Calgary Flames bei. Connor McDavid kehrte nach zwei verpassten Partien aufgrund einer Oberkörperverletzung in die Aufstellung zurück und liess sich einen Assist gutschreiben. Aryna Sabalenka, die Nummer 1 der Welt, startete mit einer Machtdemonstration in die WTA Finals in Cancun. Die 25-jährige Belarussin gewann in Mexiko gegen Maria Sakkari (WTA 9) die ersten elf Games, worauf die Griechin nach drei abgewehrten Matchbällen mit dem 1:5 immerhin ein «Velo» verhinderte. Die beiden trafen zum dritten Mal an den WTA Finals aufeinander, die ersten beiden Male siegte Sakkari. Im ersten Spiel des Turniers setzte sich Jessica Pegula (WTA 5) gegen die Kasachin Jelena Rybakina (WTA 4) 7:5, 6:2 durch. Nach dem 3:5 sicherte sich die Amerikanerin sechs Games in Serie. In der Gruppe B spielen Iga Swiatek (WTA 2), Coco Gauff (WTA 3), Marketa Vondrousova (WTA 6) sowie Ons Jabeur (WTA 7). Max Verstappen feierte im Grand Prix von Mexiko seinen 51. Sieg in der Formel 1. Der Niederländer im Red Bull wurde zum 16. Mal in dieser Saison als Erster abgewinkt und übertraf damit seinen Rekord aus dem Vorjahr. The records keep tumbling for An incredible 16th win of the season 🤩 Mit Verstappen aufs Podest stiegen Lewis Hamilton im Mercedes und Charles Leclerc im Ferrari. Für Lokalmatador Sergio Perez war das Heimrennen nach einer Startkollision mit Leclerc schon früh zu Ende. Valtteri Bottas und Zhou Guanyu in den Alfa Romeo belegten die Plätze 14 und 15. Paradiesvogel Peter Wright hat in Dortmund seinen zweiten Titel bei der Darts-Europameisterschaft gewonnen. Nach 2020 setzte sich der 53 Jahre alte Schotte nach einem 11:6-Finalsieg über Englands James Wade nun auch im Jahr 2023 durch. «Snakebite», wie der für seine bunten Kostüme und Frisuren bekannte Wright genannt wird, krönte am Sonntagabend ein starkes Turnier, bei dem er unter anderem Weltmeister Michael Smith aus England klar besiegte. Gegen den Deutschen Gabriel Clemens wäre er beim 6:5 in Runde eins beinahe ausgeschieden. WRIGHT IS THE EUROPEAN CHAMPION ONCE AGAIN 🏆🏆 Peter Wright is crowned the European Champion for the second time with victory over James Wade 👏🏻👏🏻 Der zweimalige Weltmeister Wright setzte sich in seinem Halloween-Outfit souverän durch und spielte ein dominantes Finale. Der bedeutende Major-Titel hilft Wright auch in der sogenannten Order of Merit, der Weltrangliste. Wright zieht mit den 120'000 Pfund am Niederländer Michael van Gerwen vorbei und übernimmt wieder den zweiten Platz im Ranking. Nur Weltmeister Smith hat noch mehr Preisgeld in den vergangenen zwei Jahren eingespielt. In gut sechs Wochen (15. Dezember bis 3. Januar) beginnt im Alexandra Palace von London die Weltmeisterschaft. Bei einem Angriff mit Steinen auf den Mannschaftsbus von Olympique Lyon vor dem Auswärtsspiel bei Olympique Marseille ist Trainer Fabio Grosso am Kopf getroffen und verletzt worden. Auf Fotos und Videos war am Sonntagabend zu sehen, wie der frühere italienische Fussball-Weltmeister blutend durch die Katakomben ging. Auch Lyons Co-Trainer Raffaele Longo soll verletzt worden sein, der Bus soll kurz vor Ankunft am Stadion mit Steinen beworfen worden sein. Eine Stellungnahme beider Vereine steht noch aus. Die Partie wurde abgesagt. Lokalmatador Sergio Perez ist beim Formel-1-Rennen in Mexiko nach einem Crash in der Auftaktrunde ausgeschieden. Der mexikanische Red-Bull-Pilot versuchte, Pole-Mann Charles Leclerc in der ersten Kurve übermotiviert aussen zu überholen. Dabei touchierten sich aber beide Wagen, der Red Bull von Perez hob mit drei Rädern sogar ab. Trümmerteile flogen anschliessend auf den Asphalt. Leclerc konnte das Rennen fortsetzen. DRAMA AT TURN 1!!! Perez and Leclerc make contact 💥 Perez limps on but he is out of the race ❌ Perez, dessen Zukunft bei Red Bull als Teamkollege von Weltmeister Max Verstappen weiter fraglich ist, fuhr indes an die Box. Die Crew konnte seinen beschädigten Wagen aber nicht mehr reparieren, bitter enttäuscht stieg der 33-Jährige aus dem Auto. Das Virtuelle Safety Car wurde vorübergehend eingesetzt. Der frühere Bundesliga-Profi Bas Dost ist am Sonntagabend beim Spiel seines niederländischen Klubs NEC Nijmegen bei AZ Alkmaar dramatisch kollabiert. Der 34-Jährige sackte in der Nachspielzeit ohne gegnerische Einwirkung im Mittelkreis zusammen und lag regungslos auf dem Rücken. Nach bangen Minuten der Erstversorgung teilte AZ mit, dass Dost bei Bewusstsein und ansprechbar sei. Das Spiel wurde nach dem Vorfall zunächst unterbrochen und dann abgebrochen. Torgarant Erling Haaland hat Manchester City zu einem souveränen Sieg im Derby beim Stadtrivalen United geführt. Mit einem Doppelpack sowie einer Torvorlage war der Norweger beim 3:0 (1:0) im Old Trafford der entscheidende Mann und baute seine Saisonbilanz auf elf Treffer in zehn Premier-League-Spielen aus. Mit 24 Punkten bleibt Champions-League-Sieger ManCity, der vier der jüngsten fünf Derbys gewonnen hat, als Tabellendritter dem Spitzenreiter Tottenham Hotspur (26) auf den Fersen, der FC Arsenal liegt punktgleich mit den Citizens auf Platz drei. Tottenham (2:1 am Freitag bei Crystal Palace) und Arsenal (5:0 am Samstag gegen Sheffield United) hatten bereits vorgelegt. Manchester United (15) ist nach der fünften Saisonniederlage Achter. Haaland, in der Vorsaison bei Citys 6:3-Heimgala gegen ManUnited gleich dreimal erfolgreich, traf zunächst in der 26. Spielminute per Foulelfmeter. In der zweiten Halbzeit schliesslich per Kopf (49.) nach einer Flanke von Bernardo Silva für die Mannschaft von Teammanager Pep Guardiola erfolgreich. Phil Foden (80.) traf dann nach Haaland-Vorlage zum 3:0. Der HC Ajoie verpflichtet mit Dmitro Timaschow einen achten Ausländer. Der schwedisch-ukrainische Angreifer unterschreibt vorerst für zwei Monate mit der Option, den Vertrag bis Ende der Saison zu verlängern. Zuletzt spielte der 27-Jährige, der 2015 von den Toronto Maple Leafs gedraftet wurde, sich in der NHL aber nie wirklich durchsetzen konnte, zwei Saisons für das schwedische Team Brynäs. Die Young Boys können nicht von Zürichs Ausrutscher profitieren. Nach Führung müssen sich die Berner in Lugano mit einem 1:1 begnügen. Derweil verliert Basel das Kellerduell gegen Lausanne-Sport gleich mit 0:3. Nachdem Filip Ugrinic die Gäste in der 60. Minute verdient in Führung gebracht hatte, schien YB nach Punkten zu Leader Zürich aufzuschliessen. Luganos Yanis Cimignani hatte jedoch etwas dagegen. Nach schönem Pass von Renato Steffen schlenzte der Franzose den Ball in der 78. Minute zum Ausgleich ins Netz. Damit bleiben die Berner in der Tabelle zwei Punkte hinter dem FCZ, haben allerdings ein Spiel weniger ausgetragen. Am anderen Ende der Rangliste wird der FC Basel langsam abgehängt. Beim 0:3 gegen Lausanne-Sport blieb der von Heiko Vogel trainierte FCB zum vierten Mal in Serie ohne Tor und ohne Punkte. Das spektakulärste Sonntagsspiel fand in Genf statt. Erst drehten die Gäste aus Luzern nach frühem Rückstand die Partie, ehe Servette sich mit drei Treffern nochmals zurückmeldete. Dank dem 4:2-Heimsieg machen die Genfer einen Sprung auf den 4. Platz. Eine gute Runde war es auch für St. Gallen, das am Samstag 3:1 gegen GC gewann und somit zu YB und Zürich (1:1 gegen Lausanne-Ouchy) aufschloss. Dominique Aegerter hebt sich das Beste in seiner ersten Saison in der Superbike-WM für den Schluss auf. Der Oberaargauer wird in den letzten Rennen beim Finale in Jerez in Spanien Zweiter und Dritter. Schon am Samstag im ersten Rennen über die normale Distanz in Andalusien hatte sich Aegerter Hoffnungen auf eine Spitzenklassierung machen dürfen. Losgefahren war er von Startplatz 2, in der Qualifikation war einzig der neue und alte Weltmeister, der Spanier Alvaro Bautista auf Ducati, schneller gewesen. Ein Problem mit der Elektronik an der Yamaha liess den Traum vom Exploit jedoch platzen. Am Sonntag vor der Prüfung über die verkürzte Distanz, in dieser Rennklasse offiziell als Superpole-Race bezeichnet, stand Aegerter wiederum neben Bautista in der Frontreihe. Die neuerliche Chance packte er beim Schopf - in einem Rennen, in dem er vorerst erneut mit der Technik an der Yamaha zu kämpfen hatte. Diesmal hatte er Ölverlust zu beklagen; die sichtbare Spur machte den Unterbruch des Rennens nötig. Die zweite Tranche führte über noch acht Runden, nach denen Aegerter nach dem Wechsel auf das Ersatz-Motorrad mit anderthalb Sekunden Rückstand auf Saisondominator Bautista das Ziel erreichte. Gut drei Stunden nach dem ersten Podiumsrang in dieser Serie doppelte Aegerter gleich nach. Im zweiten Hauptrennen des Wochenendes belegte er hinter Bautista und dem Türken Toprak Razgatlioglu, einem Markenkollegen, Platz 3. Razgatlioglu entschied das packende Duell gegen den Spanier zwar hauchdünn für sich. Wegen Überschreitens der Streckenbegrenzung musste er den Sieg jedoch seinem Dauerrivalen überlassen. Dank dem versöhnlichen Saisonabschluss, den er auch als Entschädigung für viele Ungereimtheiten und Enttäuschungen im Verlauf dieser Weltmeisterschaft betrachten darf, stiess Aegerter in der Gesamtwertung auf Platz 8 vor. Real Madrids französischer Fussball-Nationalspieler Aurélien Tchouameni hat sich im Clásico den Mittelfuss gebrochen. Wie die Königlichen am Tag nach dem 2:1 in der spanischen Liga gegen den FC Barcelona mitteilten, sei dies das Ergebnis einer medizinischen Untersuchung vom Sonntag. Konkret wurde bei dem 23 Jahre alten Mittelfeldspieler eine «Stressfraktur am zweiten Mittelfussknochen des linken Fusses» diagnostiziert, wie es in einer Vereinsmitteilung hiess. Wie lange Tchouameni, der am Samstag die gesamte Spielzeit gegen Barça auf dem Rasen stand, der Mannschaft von Trainer Carlo Ancelotti fehlen wird, wurde nicht mitgeteilt. Parte médico de Tchouameni. Der Spielbetrieb der höchsten britischen Eishockey-Liga wird von einem tragischen Vorfall überschattet. Der 29-jährige Amerikaner Adam Johnson von den Nottingham Panthers ist seinen schweren Verletzungen am Hals erlegen, die er am Samstag in der Partie bei den Sheffield Steelers erlitten hatte. Johnson war von einer Schlittschuh-Kufe getroffen worden. Die gesamte Eishockeyfamilie trauert um Adam Johnson. Der Stürmer, der in der letzten Saison noch das Trikot der trug, wurde Samstagabend im Spiel seiner Nottingham Panthers von einem Schlittschuh am Hals getroffen und erlag seinen schweren Verletzungen. Vor seinem Wechsel nach Nottingham auf diese Saison hin hatte Johnson unter anderem ein paar Spiele für die Pittsburgh Penguins in der National Hockey League bestritten. In der letzten Saison war er in Deutschland für Augsburg tätig. Titelverteidiger Südafrika hat ein intensives Duell der Rugby-Grossmächte gewonnen und ist nun alleiniger Rekordweltmeister. Die Springboks setzten sich im Finale gegen Neuseeland am Samstagabend in Paris mit 12:11 (12:6) durch, nach 1995, 2007 und 2019 ist es der vierte WM-Titel für Südafrika. Kapitän Siya Kolisi unterstrich die Bedeutung des Erfolgs, die weit über einen sportlichen Sieg hinausgehe. «Von aussen kann man das vielleicht nicht komplett verstehen», sagte er, «unser Land macht so viel durch, so vielen Kindern geht es nicht gut, aber wir können für Hoffnung sorgen und zeigen: Wenn wir zusammenarbeiten, dann ist alles möglich.» Die All Blacks durchlebten vor 80.000 Zuschauern im Stade de France und Millionen vor den Bildschirmen dagegen einen tragischen Abend, verloren unter anderem Kapitän Sam Cane mit Roter Karte - eine solche Strafe hatte es in einem WM-Finale noch nie gegeben. Beide Teams sahen zudem insgesamt viermal Gelb, mehr als eine Gelbe Karte gab es zuvor in keinem Endspiel einer Weltmeisterschaft. Neuseeland, Weltmeister von 1987, 2011 und 2015, musste sich damit auch im zweiten Endspiel gegen den grossen Rivalen geschlagen geben. 1995 hatte es diese Paarung schon einmal gegeben, das Finale in Südafrika ging nicht nur aus sportlichen Gründen in die Geschichte ein: Die Springboks traten damals erstmals mit schwarzen und weissen Spielern an, Bilder von Nelson Mandela im grün-gelben Trikot gingen damals um die Welt. Zürich könnte am Sonntag die Tabellenführung an die Young Boys verlieren. Die Zürcher müssen sich in der 12. Runde der Super League daheim gegen Lausanne-Ouchy mit einem 1:1 begnügen. St. Gallen bleibt nach dem 3:1 gegen GC im eigenen Stadion ohne Punktverlust. Der FCZ kassierte gegen Lausanne-Ouchy in der 24. Minute das 0:1 durch den jungen Ismael Gharbi. Kurz vor der Pause gelang durch einen von Jonathan Okita verwandelten Penalty der Ausgleich. Trotz einer Steigerung nach der Pause reichte es dem FCZ nicht zum Sieg gegen den Aussenseiter. 90. Schluss im Letzigrund. Wir spielen 1:1-Unentschieden im ersten Heimspiel der Vereinsgeschichte gegen den . Das Tor für den Stadtclub erzielte Jonathan Okita. 1:1 | St. Gallen bewerkstelligte den sechsten Sieg in ebenso vielen Heimspielen dank Toren von Chadrac Akolo, Willem Geubbels und Mattia Zanotti in der ersten Halbzeit. Für das nach zwei Siegen in Folge gebremste GC hatte Tsiy Ndenge zum 1:1 ausgeglichen. Im dritten Samstagsspiel trennten sich Yverdon und Winterthur 1:1. Der FCW vergab in der 80. Minute durch einen verschossenen Penalty von Roman Buess den möglichen Sieg. Am Sonntag spielt YB in Lugano, der FC Basel tritt bei Lausanne-Sport an und Luzern gastiert bei Servette. 24 Stunden nach der Heimniederlage gegen Lugano gewinnen die ZSC Lions (2.) das Spitzenspiel in der National League auswärts bei Leader Fribourg-Gottéron mit 3:1. Verteidiger Willy Riedi brachte die ZSC Lions schon nach 14 Sekunden in der ausverkauften St-Léonard-Halle in Führung. Derek Grant erhöhte im zweiten Abschnitt im Powerplay auf 2:0. Den Anschlusstreffer des Heimteams durch Benoit Jecker beantwortete der ZSC im Schlussabschnitt mit dem 3:1 durch Denis Malgin. Gottéron verlor erstmals seit dem 16. September (2:5 gegen Lugano) und nach acht Siegen hintereinander wieder ein Heimspiel. Das Verfolgerduell gewann der EV Zug (3.) in Bern gegen den SCB mit 2:1 nach Penaltyschiessen. Durch diese Ergebnisse rückten die Top 3 in der Tabelle näher zusammen. Gottéron bleibt Leader drei Punkte vor den ZSC Lions und sechs Zähler vor Zug, bestritt bislang aber eine Partie mehr als die beiden Verfolger. Vorerst gestoppt wurde die Aufholjagd des HC Lugano. Nach sechs Siegen de suite verloren die Luganesi in der Resega gegen Lausanne mit 3:4. Packend verlief die Partie in der Gotthard-Arena. Ambri-Piotta gewann gegen die SCL Tigers mit 2:1 nach Verlängerung, nachdem ihnen in der regulären Spielzeit der Ausgleich erst 0,2 Sekunden vor Schluss gelungen war. Der EHC Kloten besiegte die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers 2:1; Davos setzte sich gegen Biel 3:2 durch. Bayern München setzt sich nach einem verrückten Spiel mindestens bis am Sonntag an die Spitze der Bundesliga. Bei der Rückkehr von Manuel Neuer gewinnt der Meister dank acht Toren in der zweiten Halbzeit mit 8:0. Erstmals seit zehn Monaten spielte Bayern München wieder mit dem Manuel Neuer im Tor. Der lange Zeit wegen der Folgen eines Skiunfalls fehlende 37-Jährige erlebte eine turbulente erste Halbzeit. Nach weniger als fünf Minuten flog Teamkollege Joshua Kimmich wegen einer Notbremse vom Platz. Noch vor der Pause folgten ihm allerdings auch zwei Darmstädter - Klaus Gjasula und der Ex-St. Galler Matej Maglica - wegen der gleichen Vergehen vorzeitig in die Kabine. In Unterzahl konnten sich die Darmstädter nicht mehr schadlos halten. Als Torschütze stach Harry Kane mit drei Treffern heraus. Besonders sehenswert war das 5:0, das Kane aus über 50 Metern mit einem Schuss ins erstaunlich verwaiste gegnerische Tor erzielte. Der Engländer hat nun bereits zwölfmal in der Bundesliga getroffen. Als Zweifach-Torschützen zeichneten sich bei den Münchnern Jamal Musiala und Leroy Sané aus. Einen wichtigen Sieg feierte Borussia Mönchengladbach. Die schlecht in die Saison gestartete Mannschaft von Gerardo Seoane feierte mit dem 2:1 gegen Heidenheim den ersten Heimsieg der Saison. Der wieder in Form gekommene Franzose Alassane Pléa traf zweimal. Für Urs Fischer gab es keinen erlösenden Erfolg: Zum zehnten Mal in Folge verlor das vom Zürcher trainierte Union Berlin. Ein Eigentor von Robin Knoche stand am Ursprung der 0:2-Niederlage. Der zweite Gegentreffer fiel nach dem Platzverweis gegen Unions Rani Khedira (60.). Augsburg kam unter dem neuen dänischen Trainer Jess Thorup zu einem zweiten eindrücklichen Sieg. Eine Woche nach dem 5:2 in Heidenheim gewann das Team mit dem eingewechselten Ruben Vargas gegen Wolfsburg dank zwei späten Toren innerhalb von zwei Minuten 3:2. In der 79. führte ein Eigentor zum 2:2 und für den Siegtreffer war der Belgier Arne Engels verantwortlich. Der verletzte Kevin Mbabu bei Augsburg und der Reservist Cedric Zesiger bei Wolfsburg kamen nicht zum Einsatz. Die Diskussionen um den frühen Saisonstart und den Rennkalender gehen im alpinen Ski-Weltcup weiter. «Ich verstehe auch nicht, wer sich im Oktober für Skirennen interessiert und warum wir auf Gletschern ohne Schnee fahren», sagte Präsident Johan Eliasch vom Weltverband Fis in einem Beitrag des TV-Senders ORF. Er hoffe, dass der österreichische Verband für eine Verlegung der Rennen in Sölden nach hinten offen sei. Mit dem Riesenslalom der Frauen war auf dem Rettenbachferner am Samstag traditionell die neue Saison eröffnet worden. Die Aussagen des 61-jährigen Eliasch überraschen. Der ÖSV zeigt aber durchaus Bereitschaft, die Sölden-Klassiker noch etwas später im Jahr stattfinden zu lassen. Man habe sich dem Thema noch nie verschlossen und wolle gemeinsam mit der Fis nach der besten Lösung suchen, erklärte Verbandspräsidentin Roswitha Stadlober laut der österreichischen Presseagentur APA. Die öffentliche Kritik am frühen Saisonstart in Sölden wurde mit Blick auf die Klimakrise in den vergangenen Jahren immer lauter. Diese Saison fand er eine Woche später statt als vorigen Winter. Man werde den Auftakttermin erneut anpassen, sagte Fis-Generalsekretär Michel Vion beim traditionellen Eröffnungsevent am Freitag, bei dem Präsident Eliasch gefehlt hatte. Die Planung sei aber ein komplexes Thema, erklärte Vion. Jede Änderung habe Konsequenzen - und womöglich auch weniger Rennen zur Folge. Jan Kovar verletzte sich im Spiel gegen den HC Ambrì-Piotta vom Freitag, am Bein und konnte die Partie nicht zu Ende spielen. Weitere Untersuchungen haben ergeben, dass er 6-8 Wochen ausfallen wird. Der Tscheche hat in bisher 17 Saisonspielen für den EVZ 3 Tore erzielt und 14 Assists gegeben und kommt auf eine durchschnittliche Eiszeit von 17.5 Minuten. 🤕 Medical Update: Jan hat sich in der Partie gegen Ambrì-Piotta am Bein verletzt. Er wird dem 6-8 Wochen fehlen. 📰 Zur Medienmitteilung: Die neuen Wachs-Regeln im Ski-Weltcup sorgen überraschend schon im 1. Rennen für die 1. Disqualifikation. Die Fluor-Werte am Ski von waren zu hoch. Nairo Quintana kehrt in bekanntem Umfeld in den Rennbetrieb zurück. Der im letzten Jahr wegen eines «medizinischen Vergehens» nachträglich aus der Tour de France ausgeschlossene Kolumbianer fährt in der kommenden Saison wieder für das Team Movistar. Dem 33-jährigen Quintana war während der letzten Frankreich-Rundfahrt zweimal der Gebrauch von Tramadol nachgewiesen worden, was die nachträgliche Disqualifikation nach sich zog. Der Südamerikaner hatte im Schlussklassement Platz 6 belegt. Die Verwendung des Schmerzmittels wurde nicht als «Doping», sondern als «medizinisches Vergehen» betrachtet. Tramadol steht auf der Liste der verbotenen Substanzen des Internationalen Radsport-Verbandes (UCI), die Welt-Anti-Doping-Agentur (WADA) allerdings zieht mit dieser Einstufung erst auf die kommende Saison hin nach. Quintana hatte wenige Wochen nach dem Urteil seinen damaligen Arbeitgeber Arkéa-Samsic verlassen. Bei der Equipe Movistar stand er schon in den Jahren 2012 bis 2019 unter Vertrag. In dieser Zeit gewann er den Giro d’Italia (2014) und die Vuelta (2016). Die Atlanta Hawks verloren auch ihr zweites Spiel dieser NBA-Saison. Das Team mit Clint Capela unterlag zuhause den New York Knicks 120:126. Capela steuerte in einer ausgeglichenen Partie 13 Punkte bei und war mit 13 Rebounds in dieser Statistik ein weiteres Mal der Beste seiner Mannschaft. Andererseits war der Genfer mit minus 9 wie schon am Mittwoch bei der Auswärts-Niederlage gegen die Charlotte Hornets der Spieler mit der schlechtesten Plus-/Minus-Bilanz. Final score tonight England sichert sich an der Rugby-WM in Frankreich den 3. Platz. Die Briten gewinnen den «kleinen Final» gegen Argentinien 26:23. In dem ausgeglichenen Duell starteten die Engländer etwas besser und gingen mit einer 16:10-Führung in die Pause. Durch einen Versuch gleich zu Beginn der zweiten Halbzeit kämpften sich die Südamerikaner ins Spiel zurück, mussten sich in der dramatischen Schlussphase aber knapp geschlagen geben. Damit wurde England nach einem Weltmeistertitel (2003) und drei 2. Plätzen (1991, 2007, 2019) erstmals WM-Dritter. Im Final am Samstag (21.00 Uhr) treffen Titelverteidiger Südafrika und Neuseeland aufeinander. Der HC Fribourg-Gottéron ist der Gewinner der Runde vom Freitag in der National League. Dem Leader gelingt etwas, was sonst noch niemand diese Saison geschafft hat: Ein Auswärtssieg bei Meister Genf. Das Spitzenspiel zwischen Meister Genève-Servette und Leader Fribourg-Gottéron verlief packend. Fribourg zog durch Tore von Marcus Sörensen, Lucas Wallmark und Samuel Walser auf 3:0 davon. Servette holte diesen Rückstand indessen auf. Der Finne Sakari Manninen realisierte in den letzten sieben Minuten mit zwei Goals den Ausgleich. Am Ende siegte Freiburg doch noch - mit 4:3 nach Penaltyschiessen. Gottéron profitierte auch davon, dass die Verfolger leer ausgingen. Die ZSC Lions verloren gegen Lugano nach einer 1:0-Führung mit 1:3. Der EV Zug kassierte nach sechs Siegen de suite eine 2:3-Heimniederlage gegen den HC Ambri-Piotta. Gottéron baute so den Vorsprung in der Tabelle (mit einem Mehrspiel) auf sechs Punkte auf die ZSC Lions aus. Im Bereich des oberen Playoff-Strich besiegten die Rapperswil-Jona Lakers (8.) den Tabellennachbar HC Davos (7.) glückhaft mit 3:2 nach Verlängerung. Der Lausanne Hockey Club wahrte den Anschluss ans Tabellenmittelfeld mit einem 3:0-Heimerfolg über Kloten. Der 20-jährige Goalie Kevin Pasche kam in seinem allerersten Spiel in der National League zu einem Shutout. Der EHC Biel, Playoff-Finalist der letzten Saison, fand auch gegen Schlusslicht HC Ajoie noch nicht aus der Krise. Biel gewann zwar 4:3 nach Penaltyschiessen, Ajoie punktete aber zum dritten Mal hintereinander. Das Schweizer Nationalteam der Frauen verliert das dritte Spiel der Nations League 0:1 gegen Schweden. Magdalena Eriksson gelang für die WM-Dritten aus Skandinavien der einzige Treffer kurz vor der Pause. Für die Schweiz geht es am Dienstag mit der Partie in Zürich gegen Weltmeister Spanien weiter. Mehr dazu: Der Schweizer Tennisprofi Dominic Stricker scheitert an den Swiss Indoors in den Viertelfinals. Der 21-jährige Berner unterliegt dem Franzosen Ugo Humbert 4:6, 6:2, 2:6. Damit gehen die Halbfinals beim 500er-Turnier in Basel wie im letzten Jahr ohne Schweizer Beteiligung über die Bühne. Humbert, als Nummer 28 der Welt 68 Positionen vor Stricker klassiert, trifft am Samstag auf den als Nummer 4 gesetzten Polen Hubert Hurkacz. Mehr dazu: Der Franzose war im Duell zweier Linkshänder der erwartet unangenehme Gegner. Einen nervösen Start - Humbert führte 2:0 und 40:15 bei eigenem Aufschlag - konnte Stricker noch wettmachen, das Break zum 4:6 natürlich nicht mehr. Erstaunlicherweise drehte der Schweizer im zweiten Satz mächtig auf und dominierte seinen drei Jahre älteren Kontrahenten phasenweise klar. Humbert, der seine gute Form zuletzt mit Siegen gegen die Top-Ten-Spieler Stefanos Tsitsipas und Andrej Rublew und Viertelfinals bei den grossen Turnieren in Peking und Schanghai unter Beweis gestellt hatte, fand jedoch wieder in die Spur zurück. Er nahm Stricker im Entscheidungssatz gleich das erste Aufschlagspiel ab und vereitelte diesmal auch eine Chance des Berners zum sofortigen Re-Break. Nach knapp zwei Stunden und einem zweiten Break zum 6:2 behielt der Franzose im ersten Duell der beiden die Oberhand. Stricker muss sich nach seinem dritten verlorenen ATP-Viertelfinal - dem ersten seit gut zwei Jahren - allerdings keine grossen Vorwürfe machen. Er kam eine Runde weiter als im letzten Jahr und sicherte sich seinen Platz in den Top 100 der Weltrangliste wohl bis Ende Jahr. Damit dürfte er am Australian Open erstmals ohne Qualifikation im Hauptfeld eines Grand-Slam-Turniers stehen. Mehr als 20 Millionen Fans aus 206 Ländern haben in der ersten Bewerbungsphase Tickets für die Fussball-EM 2024 in Deutschland beantragt. Damit überstieg die Nachfrage deutlich das Angebot: Insgesamt standen im Zeitraum vom 3. bis 26. Oktober 1,2 Millionen Karten zur Verfügung. Die nächste Verkaufsphase startet nach der Endrundenauslosung am 2. Dezember. Insgesamt stehen 2,7 Millionen Eintrittskarten für die 51 Spiele in den zehn Stadien zum Verkauf. Die Uefa rechnet mit Erlösen von über 300 Millionen Euro aus dem Ticketgeschäft. Die Gesamteinnahmen der zweiten EM-Endrunde in Deutschland nach 1988 sollen sich auf 2,3 Milliarden belaufen. Mikaela Shiffrin gewann den von der internationalen Skijournalisten-Vereinigung vergebenen «Skieur d’Or» zum dritten Mal. Bereits 2017 und 2019 erhielt sie die Auszeichnung. Die 28-jährige Amerikanerin wusste mit dem Gewinn des Gesamtweltcups und dem WM-Titel im Riesenslalom zu überzeugen. Sie setzte sich bei der Wahl etwas überraschend gegen Marco Odermatt durch, der in der vergangenen Saison nicht nur den Gesamtweltcup mit der Rekordpunktzahl von 2042 für sich entschied, sondern auch zwei WM-Titel vorzuweisen hatte. Odermatt hatte den «Skieur d’Or» im Vorjahr als erster Schweizer seit Carlo Janka 2010 gewonnen. Rekordsieger mit vier Auszeichnungen sind der Schweizer Pirmin Zurbriggen und der Österreicher Marcel Hirscher. Die Schweizer Kunstturnerin Lena Bickel beendet das Wettkampfjahr 2023 wegen Muskelbeschwerden vorzeitig. Die 18-jährige Tessinerin, die vor wenigen Wochen an den Weltmeisterschaften in Antwerpen als Einzelathletin einen persönlichen Quotenplatz für die Olympischen Spiele gelöst hat, verpasst somit auch den Swiss Cup von übernächstem Sonntag in Zürich. Der frühere Fussball-Weltmeister Mesut Özil hat sich erneut klar mit Palästina solidarisiert. Der 34-Jährige teilte am Freitag bei Instagram sowie auf der Plattform X, vormals Twitter, ein Video aus dem Fanblock vom Champions-League-Spiel zwischen Celtic Glasgow und Atlético Madrid (2:2) vom Mittwoch. Auf den rund 70-sekündigen Aufnahmen ist zu sehen, wie viele Anhänger der Schotten auf den Tribünen mit Palästina-Flaggen den Fussball-Klassiker «You’ll never walk alone» singen. Dazu schrieb Özil: «Menschen in Palästina – ihr werdet nie alleine gehen. Respekt an die Fans von @CelticFC.» Dazu postete er selbst Herzen und die Flagge Palästinas. Die Vereinsführung von Celtic hatte sich von politischen Bekundungen der Fans distanziert. Vor einigen Tagen hatte der Ex-Nationalspieler Özil auch schon sein Bedauern über den Tod tausender Menschen in Israel und dem Gazastreifen ausgedrückt. Özil hatte in der Vergangenheit schon mehrfach mit politischen Statements für Aufsehen gesorgt. Im Dezember 2019 hatte sich der damalige Profi des FC Arsenal in den sozialen Medien kritisch zur Unterdrückung der Uiguren in China geäussert. Zudem hatten seine Fotos und seine Nähe zum umstrittenen türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan vor allem in Deutschland für Kritik gesorgt. Der Norweger Lucas Braathen tritt mit erst 23 Jahren per sofort zurück. Dies gibt der Slalomspezialist unmittelbar vor dem Weltcup-Auftakt in Sölden bekannt. Braathen hatte im vergangenen Winter trotz einer Blinddarm-Operation die kleine Kristallkugel als bester Slalomfahrer geholt. Er feierte zwei seiner fünf Weltcupsiege in der Schweiz: 2022 in Wengen und 2023 in Adelboden gewann er jeweils den Slalom. Der Rücktritt ist ein Paukenschlag, denn der junge Norweger zählte zu den aufsteigenden Stars bei den Alpinen. Der 23-Jährige begründet diesen Schritt mit der fehlenden Freiheit. Als Spitzensportler musste er auf viele andere Aspekte seines Lebens verzichten. «Damit ich in diesem System weiterfahren kann, muss ich nicht nur meine Träume aufschieben. Ich musste auch meine Freude aufschieben. Ich bin nicht mehr bereit, das zu tun», sagte er am Freitagmorgen in Sölden, wo er vor drei Jahren seinen ersten Weltcupsieg gefeiert hatte. Zu Braathens Rücktrittsentscheid beigetragen haben dürfte ein Streit mit dem norwegischen Skiverband NSF, der strenge Richtlinien im Sponsoring von Athleten hat. Braathen modelte für die Modemarke «J. Lindberg» und stiess damit offenbar den NSF vor den Kopf, der von «Helly Hansen» ausgestattet wird. Manuel Neuer wird einem Medienbericht zufolge nach mehr als zehn Monaten Verletzungspause sein Comeback beim FC Bayern München geben. Das berichtete am Freitag der TV-Sender Sky. Die Entscheidung habe Trainer Thomas Tuchel in Absprache mit Neuer und Torwarttrainer Michael Rechner getroffen. Der 37 Jahre alte Kapitän gehört demnach beim Bundesliga-Heimspiel am Samstag gegen den SV Darmstadt 98 wieder zum Kader des deutschen Fussball-Rekordmeisters und erhält direkt einen Platz in der Startelf. Letztmals stand Neuer am 12. November 2022 beim 2:0 auswärts gegen den FC Schalke im Münchner Tor. Der Weltmeister von 2014 hat sein bislang letztes Spiel beim frühen deutschen WM-Aus in Katar am 1. Dezember 2022 gegen Costa Rica bestritten. Im Anschluss an das Turnier hatte er sich bei einer Ski-Tour Schien- und Wadenbein am rechten Unterschenkel gebrochen. Seitdem arbeitete er an seinem Comeback. (dpa) Wegen verbotener Sportwetten ist Eishockey-Profi Shane Pinto vom NHL-Klub Ottawa Senators für 41 Spiele gesperrt worden. Er verpasst damit die Hälfte der Hauptrunde. Nach Angaben der nordamerikanischen Profiliga soll der 22-jährige Pinto nicht auf NHL-Spiele gesetzt haben. Es ist unklar, um welches Vergehen es sich handelt. NHL-Profis ist es erlaubt, Wetten in anderen Sportarten abzusetzen. «Shane ist ein geschätztes Mitglied unseres Eishockeyklubs. Ein engagierter, intelligenter junger Mann, der schlechte Entscheidungen getroffen hat. Wir wissen, dass er seine Fehler bereut», teilte die kanadische Franchise mit. Der Klub unterstütze «die Glücksspielregeln der NHL voll und ganz». Nino Niederreiter, der beste Schweizer NHL-Torschütze aller Zeiten, erhöhte die Rekordzahl auf 222 Treffer. Zum 4:1-Auswärtssieg mit den Winnipeg Jets über die Detroit Red Wings steuerte er ein Tor und einen Assist bei. Der 31-jährige Bündner musste bis zur Schlussminute warten, ehe er im siebten Spiel dieser Saison erstmals traf. Er schloss einen Gegenstoss mit einem Schuss aus dem Handgelenk ins leere Tor erfolgreich ab. Hinter der Schnapszahl von 222 Treffern steckt harte Arbeit, Ausdauer und viel Talent. Niederreiter bestritt schon als 16-Jähriger drei Playoff-Partien für den HC Davos, wechselte als 17-Jähriger nach Nordamerika und schoss als 18-Jähriger im Dress der New York Islanders im Oktober 2010 den ersten NHL-Treffer. Die Staatsanwaltschaft München hat am Donnerstag Räume des Deutschen Eishockey-Bundes und einer nicht explizit genannten Privatperson durchsuchen lassen. Das bestätigten die Behörde und der DEB auf Anfrage. Nähere Angaben zu den Hintergründen der Durchsuchungen machten weder der DEB noch die Staatsanwaltschaft. Offiziell unklar ist, gegen wen sich die Ermittlungen richten und wie der genaue Vorwurf lautet. «Bitte verstehen Sie, dass wir uns zu Details des Sachverhalts nicht weiter äussern werden», hiess es dazu vom DEB. Berichten des «Spiegel», des Bayerischen Rundfunks und der «Augsburger Allgemeinen» zufolge geht es um bereits in der Vergangenheit erhobene Vorwürfe im Zusammenhang mit der Vergabe von Übertragungs- und Werberechten. Bereits vor einigen Jahren hatte es Kritik einiger Eishockey-Landesverbände gegeben. Dabei ging es um Verhandlungen über TV-Verträge und die Vergabe von Medienrechten. Servette bleibt in der Gruppenphase der Europa League ohne Sieg. Nach den Niederlagen in den ersten beiden Spielen holte das Team von Trainer René Weiler auswärts gegen das zuvor ebenfalls punktelose Sheriff Tiraspol immerhin ein 1:1. Den Treffer für die Genfer zum 1:0 erzielte Enzo Crivelli (41.) Der FC Lugano kassiert in der Conference League im dritten Gruppenspiel die erste Niederlage. Das Team von Trainer Mattia Croci-Torti verliert in Zürich gegen den FC Brügge 1:3. «Meine Mannschaft wird gegen Brügge ein anderes Gesicht zeigen», versprach Croci-Torti nach der 1:2-Niederlage am Sonntag bei den Grasshoppers. Davon war in den ersten 45 Minuten nichts zu sehen. Der Auftritt von Lugano in der ersten Halbzeit passte zum regnerischen und kühlen Wetter. Die Tessiner zeigten nichts Erwärmendes, agierten in der Offensive mehr als harmlos. Einziger Torschütze für Lugano Shkelqim Vadi (74.). Für das Schweizer Nationalteam wirkt sich das überraschende 3:3-Remis in der EM-Qualifikation gegen Belarus nicht negativ auf die Platzierung in der FIFA-Weltrangliste aus. Die Mannschaft von Murat Yakin belegt unverändert den 14. Platz. Im zum zweitletzten Mal in diesem Jahr veröffentlichten Ranking verbleibt Weltmeister Argentinien an der Spitze, gefolgt von Frankreich, Brasilien, England und Belgien. In den Top 10 machten die für die EM 2024 qualifizierten Portugal (6.) und Spanien (8.) je zwei Positionen gut. EM-Gastgeber Deutschland wird im 16. Rang geführt. Nach dem verweigerten Handschlag mit Trainer Urs Fischer in der Champions League hat Fussball-Bundesligist Union Berlin Stürmer David Fofana für eine Woche suspendiert. Der 20-Jährige habe sich in einem persönlichen Gespräch mit Fischer und Geschäftsführer Oliver Ruhnert entschuldigt, dennoch werde er bis kommenden Mittwoch «individuell trainieren», sagte Pressesprecher Christian Arbeit. Bei der Niederlage gegen die SSC Neapel (0:1) war Fofana in der 70. Minute ausgewechselt worden und hatte Fischer ignoriert. «Es geht um das Team, es geht immer darum, wie man sich nach Entscheidungen verhält», sagte Fischer: «Fussball ist immer noch ein Teamsport, da muss man sich manchmal unterordnen. Ich hoffe, dass er aus solchen Situationen lernt.» Gegen den in einen Wettskandal verwickelten Newcastle-United-Profi Sandro Tonali ist vom italienischen Fussballverband FIGC eine zehnmonatige Sperre verhängt worden. Der 23-Jährige muss sich zudem einer mindestens sechsmonatigen Therapie zur Bekämpfung seiner Spielsucht unterziehen. Zudem wird er an 16 Vorträgen zum Thema Spielsucht teilnehmen müssen. Dies kündigte der italienische Verbandschef Gabriele Gravina an. Sollte der geständige Tonali diese Verpflichtungen nicht erfüllen, droht ihm eine Sperre von über drei Jahren. Der Newcastle-Spieler wird wohl die weiteren Spiele der laufenden Saison versäumen. Aufatmen bei Gianni Infantino: Das Strafverfahren gegen den Präsidenten des Fussball-Weltverbandes FIFA im sogenannten «Fall Lauber» ist eingestellt worden. Der Verdacht auf eine Instrumentalisierung der Bundesanwaltschaft habe sich im Verlauf der Untersuchung nicht erhärtet, teilten die beiden ausserordentlichen Bundesanwälte Ulrich Weder und Hans Maurer am Donnerstag mit. Der Tatverdacht sei entkräftet worden. «Das ist ein vollumfänglicher, deutlicher und klarer Sieg für mich, für die neue FIFA und für die Gerechtigkeit», sagte Infantino in einer Mitteilung: «Es ist jetzt allen klar, dass die Anschuldigungen gegen mich nur verzweifelte Versuche von armen, neidischen und korrupten Leuten waren, meinen Ruf anzugreifen. Falls diese Leute auch nur ein kleines bisschen Würde hätten, sollten sie zumindest den Anstand haben und sich für ihre Handlungen und den verursachten Schaden entschuldigen.» Trotz einer verrückten Aufholjagd verlieren die New Jersey Devils in der NHL das Heimspiel gegen die Washington Capitals 4:6. Timo Meier und Nico Hischier tragen als Torschützen zum Spektakel bei. Die Devils legten einen monumentalen Fehlstart hin und lagen nach knapp 18 Minuten schon 0:3 zurück. Der Schweizer Goalie Akira Schmid war nicht zu beneiden. Der Emmentaler liess drei von acht Schüssen passieren und wurde zur Pause durch Vitek Vanecek ersetzt. Mit dem Tschechen im Tor starteten die Devils im Mitteldrittel eine spektakuläre Aufholjagd. Mit drei Goals innert 131 Sekunden war der Rückstand bis zur 27. Minute wieder wettgemacht. Timo Meier und Captain Nico Hischier trafen zum 2:3 und 3:3. Washington glich zu Beginn des Schlussdrittels zum 4:4 aus, um nur knapp zwei Minuten später erneut in Führung zu gehen. Schliesslich sorgte Alexander Owetschkin zum 6:4 ins leere Tor für die definitive Entscheidung. Für die Devils war es die dritte aufeinanderfolgende Heimniederlage im vierten Heimspiel der Saison. Für die FIS Games 2028 interessieren sich neben St. Moritz zwei weitere Destinationen, wie der Internationale Ski-Verband per Communiqué vermeldet.

Richards hilariously revealed last year that Dempsey had made that comment to him as they butted heads during a clash between and in 2007. Over 16 years on, they were reunited in the CBS Sports studio on Tuesday (November 7). And never one to miss the opportunity to stir the pot, Carragher had his co-pundit turn back the clock and explain what happened alongside Dempsey. The pair watched back the incident and pulled out their best acting skills.
