Moore and all those picks to the Bears so they could move up to draft Bryce Young first overall, but that day won’t be Sunday. In his NFL debut the former Alabama QB will be facing an Atlanta defence that has little in the way of a pass rush, but Young will also be on the road and probably without his banged up top two receivers, Adam Thielen and D.J. Chark Jr. Falcons have the makings of an exciting offence, with the eighth overall pick, RB Bijan Robinson, a threat out of the backfield that will create room for WR Drake London and third-year TE Kyle Pitts. This one opened at a more comfortable three points, but the unproven Desmond Ridder will move the ball enough that the Dirty Birds cover the slightly boosted number. TAKING: ATLANTA -3.5 SCORE (O/U: 39.5): Falcons 27, Panthers 20 LINE: Baltimore by 10 Also making his NFL debut will be No. 2 pick C.J. Stroud, but the task facing him is much more formidable, as the 21-year-old former Buckeyes QB is facing a top tier defence on extremely hostile soil. Lamar Jackson hasn’t played since throwing just four passes against the Broncos on Dec. 4, and now he’s back, healthy, armed with a brand new big money contact and set of receivers that includes Odell Beckham Jr. and Zay Flowers to go along with the exceptional Rashod Bateman and, of course, Mark Andrews. Also back from injury is J.K. Dobbins, and he’ll feast on a Texans runs defence that was dead last in the league last season. Ravens have everything it takes to be a Super Bowl contender and their march towards that goal starts with a gimme. Baltimore is, by far, the safest Survivor Pool pick for Week 1. TAKING: BALTIMORE -10 SCORE (O/U: 43.5): Ravens 30, Texans 7 LINE: Buffalo by 2.5 One of the most replayed rants in NFL history came from Cardinals coach Dennis Green after an early season, 20-point loss to Chicago in 2009. I’m not thinking of “the Bears are what we thought they were” part, but the “if you want to crown them, then crown their ass” near the end. After all their additions and growth, it seems a large number of people want to crown the Jets, but the Bills are not even near ready to relinquish their AFC East throne. Devoid of all the hype they remain among the top three betting odds favourites for the Super Bowl. While they’re still learning how to win, Jets remain at an elementary school level in that course. They may be a “sexy pick” to win the division, but they’ve got to go through Buffalo to get there. Josh Allen and company will remind them of that on Monday. I’d like the Bills even more if Von Miller wasn’t on the PUP list for the first four games, but they still have more overall talent than the Jets. They still have better receivers, a better running attack (especially with Breece Hall not yet 100 percent) and a slightly better defence. I’ll also take a hungry 27-year-old Allen over an almost-40 year old former champion like Aaron Rodgers, even if the latter is driven to prove himself in a different shade of green. TAKING: BUFFALO -2.5 SCORE: (O/U: 46.5): Bills 23, Jets 17 And the rest … LINE: Cincinnati by 2.5 In case you didn’t know, Joe’s a go. After missing a month and a half of training camp with a calf injury, Bengals QB Joe Burrow was a full participant at practice this week and is expected to lead his vaunted gang into a Battle of Ohio that could be the best game of Week 1. DeShaun Watson was pretty bad in his six starts with the Browns last season — and he was nothing to write home about in the preseason just past — but he is surely now familiar with the Cleveland offence and anxious to get back on the path to stardom he was strolled before throwing himself into all sorts of hot water away from the field. With the likes of Nick Chubb, Amari Cooper and Myles Garrett in starring roles — and noting that the Browns have won eight of the past 10 meetings, including the last five in Cleveland — I’m siding with the upset and this dog at home in the Pound. TAKING: CLEVELAND +2.5 SCORE (O/U: 47.5): Browns 27, Bengals 21 LINE: Jacksonville by 5 CHEWABLE: The home team has won the last 11 games between these two AFC South opponents. That streak is about to end. Fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson didn’t look ready for this level as he struggled to complete passes in the preseason. Without Jonathan Taylor the Colts will take a RB-by-committee approach against a Jags solid run defence. Indy will again be without perennially concussed LB Shaq Leonard, while Trevor Lawrence builds on an outstanding finish to 2023 with a very dangerous weapon added to his arsenal: WR Calvin Ridley. Jags successful defence of their division crown will begin on the right note, but that number is too big for my liking. TAKING: INDIANAPOLIS +5 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Jags 24, Colts 20 LINE: Minnesota by 6 For a former first overall pick who, five years later has still done his best work as a professional in insurance commercials, Baker Mayfield couldn’t have asked for a better opponent to face at the start of the next chapter in his QB career. Okay, maybe one, as only the Titans had a more porous pass defence than the Vikings in 2022. Vikings offence might even be better with 23rd overall pick Jordan Addison giving Kirk Cousins somebody other than Justin Jefferson that can sting opponents deeply, but their secondary is still an open wound. Poised before it with salt shakers in hand are Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. TAKING: TAMPA BAY +6 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Buccaneers 28, Vikings 27. LINE: New Orleans by 3 Signs are pointing to an upset here. Derek Carr makes his debut for the Saints, but his O-line projects to be subpar while the Titans have a strong pass rush, and he won’t have Alvin Kamara as an outlet. The addition of DeAndre Hopkins gives the Titans the quality replacement for A.J. Brown they lacked last year. Whether Derrick Henry starts to slow down as a 29-year-old, it shouldn’t be against a Saints defence that was 24th against the rush defence. Tennessee has never lost in New Orleans, winning all three visits since the relocation from Houston plus the last one made as the Oilers. Saints are 3-17 ATS in the first two weeks of the season since 2013, and Mike Vrabel, one of the best coaches in the NFL, is 22-9 ATS as a dog getting 3+ points. TAKING: TENNESSEE +3 SCORE (O/U: 45.50): Titans 23, Saints 17 LINE: San Francisco by 2.5 What a matchup! Two great coaches, two elite defences, two outstanding pass rushers, two young quarterbacks and two teams with big playmakers with the ball. If Nick Bosa does have a “beer belly” he’ll fit right in at Acrisure (formerly Heinz Field) Stadium and, after a long holdout, his presence will give the Niners a big boost. Brock Purdy has only started on the road against a ‘D’ this good once before – in last season’s conference championship game 31-7 loss to the Eagles – but he suffered an elbow injury on the first series and only returned later because his backup suffered a concussion. Kyle Shanahan will help him through this one. Ultimately, a healthy Christian McCaffrey, in his first season opener wearing scarlet, white and gold, will make the difference. TAKING: SAN FRANCISCO -2.5 SCORE (O/U: 41.5): Niners 20, Steelers 17 LINE: Washington by 7 CHEWABLE: Minus Kyler Murray, the Cardinals have an awful offence and so far have kept the identity of their starting QB — either Joshua Dobbs or Clayton Tune — a state secret. Next year it should be the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, USC’s Caleb Williams, who they’ll be able to draft first overall while trading Murray. Meanwhile, the Arizona defence is equally bad and should be overmatched by a Washington offence led by QB Sammy Howell (in his second NFL start) and could be missing WR Terry McLaurin (turf toe). TAKING: WASHINGTON -7 SCORE (O/U: 38): Commanders 24, Cardinals 9 LINE: Chicago by 1 In case you’ve lost count, Packers have won the last eight, 13 of the last 14 and 23 of the last 26 meeting in this, football’s oldest rivalry. Now begins the Jordan Love era in Green Bay, and armed with a group of young receivers, expect him to turn to veteran RBs Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon against a Bears run defence that ranked 31st last season. But Chicago will also be able to run the ball with Khalil Hebert against the Packers 26th ranked run D, and rookie RT Darnell Wright, the 10th overall pick, will anchor an improved Chicago offensive line. Justin Fields will benefit greatly from this, as well as the addition of Moore, but don’t disregard how much the latter’s addition will open up space for Darnell Mooney and Cole Kmet. TAKING: CHICAGO -1 SCORE (O/U: 42.5): Bears 27, Packers 24 LINE: Broncos by 3.5 Veteran QBs Russell Wilson and Jimmy Garoppolo are coming off nightmarish seasons and will have to survive behind shaky offensive lines, and in Wilson’s case it could take some fancy footwork with Maxx Crosby in his face. The impact of Sean Payton as Denver coach should be immediate, and latest reports have Jerry Jeudy (hamstring) possibly back for this one. Raiders have won the last six meetings and eight of the last nine in this series, and that trend will end here. But that extra half point has us leaning with the visitors. TAKING: RAIDERS +3.5 SCORE (O/U: 44): Broncos 23, Raiders 20 LINE: Los Angeles by 3 With all the offensive talent on the field, particularly at the receiver positions, new Chargers OC Kellen Moore and Dolphins play calling head coach Mike McDaniel could resemble a couple of kids with a Madden video game. We’d like the Fish a lot more had they not lost Jalen Ramsey, who they acquired in the off-season for a third round pick, to a torn meniscus at camp. As is, it’s difficult not to bet on Justin Herbert with Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and the explosive Austin Ekeler coming out of the backfield. Tua Tagovailoa has Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle — and don’t underestimate Raheem Mostert — but last season he completed just 10-of-28 passes in a 23-17 road loss to the Chargers, who didn’t have Joey Bosa in the lineup. Bosa and Khalil Mack will make it even more difficult for Tua to operate this time. TAKING: LOS ANGELES -3 SCORE (O/U: 51.5): Chargers 36, Dolphins 27 LINE: Philadelphia by 4 Of course the Eagles are the superior team. It’s not close. But Tom Brady will be in honored at Gillette Stadium, Mac Jones has looked good at camp and Bill Belichick has had a very long time to prepare for this one. Patriots also have an ace in the hole in Ezekiel Elliott. In 12 games against the Eagles as a Cowboy, Zeke was on the winning side nine times while racking up more rushing yards (1,107, average 4.75 per carry) and receiving yards (357, 7.29 per catch) than any other opponent. Jalen Hurts will be facing Belichick for the first time, and The Hoodie has had trouble defending mobile QBs, but the Patriots need to get off to a better start more than the Eagles, who are likely headed back to at least the NFC championship game no matter what happens Sunday. TAKING: NEW ENGLAND +4 SCORE (O/U: 45): Patriots 20, Eagles 17 LINE: Seattle by 5.5 Before the news that Cooper Krupp (hamstring) will miss this game makes you jump to the Seahawks know that the superstar WR didn’t play in either meeting between the teams last year, and while Seattle won both, the margins of victory were three (at home) and four points (in L.A.). The Rams also didn’t have Matthew Stafford for either game, with Baker Mayfield (13-of-26, 0 TDs, 1 pick) going the distance in Seattle and John Wolford (14-of-26, 0 TDs, 2 picks) in L.A., and Stafford is now healthy. The surprising resurrection of Geno Smith will continue this season — he certainly has the weapons — but Rams will keep Game 1 close largely because Cam Akers will again run through a Seattle run defence that ranked 30th in 2022. TAKING: LOS ANGELES +5.5 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Seahawks 28, Los Angeles 24 LINE: Dallas by 3.5 A team has to be significantly overmatched if I’m going to turn down more than three points when it’s at home against a division rival. The Giants aren’t significantly overmatched here. Sure Dallas is better, improved from even last year, but Big Blue has added to Daniel Jones’ arsenal by trading for Darren Waller and drafting Jalin Hyatt out of Tennessee, and Saquon Barkley is always a factor, either by ground or air. Cowboys have won the last four meetings and 11 of the last 12, but Belichick disciple Brian Daboll wins the coaching matchup with Mike McCarthy, and if you’re going to beat Daboll three times in a row the third one is going to be very close. Liking the upset.

Gamble arrived at the Knights this season as a fringe first-grader but became Adam O'Brien's first-choice five-eighth after Kalyn Ponga reverted to fullback mid-campaign. He has played almost as many games this year (22) as in his entire career prior to 2023 (25), proving a dangerous option with the ball during the Knights' ongoing nine-game winning streak. Sunday's home elimination final against Canberra continues the 27-year-old Gamble's quest to once-and-for-all cement his status as a long-term, first-choice half in the NRL. \"That's where I'm at now,\" Gamble told AAP. \"I'd like to think I've done enough to keep my jersey. \"But if you take that mindset into a pre-season, you don't put your best foot forward and things can go downhill really quickly.\" Standing in Gamble's way is Penrith's back-up playmaker Cogger, who comes into the finals series with a similar chance to shine ahead of his return to Newcastle next year. Where Gamble's strength lies in playing eyes-up football, Cogger is a more natural game manager. But like Gamble, he has only been a first-choice half in fits and starts. Having returned from a two-year stint in England, Cogger was a capable understudy for Nathan Cleary when Penrith's first-choice No.7 went down with a hamstring injury during the State of Origin period. Saturday's qualifying final against the Warriors is his second full game in a stint replacing five-eighth Jarome Luai, whose dislocated shoulder will keep him out until at least the third week of finals. Cogger was electric in the minor premiers' last-start defeat of North Queensland and after debuting at Newcastle in 2016, he returns to the club in 2024 intent on clinching his own spot in the halves. \"All things lead to that,\" he told AAP. \"But at the moment my job's here at Penrith. \"My best years are ahead of me (after) being part of a really successful system (at Penrith) and being able to work side-by-side with Nathan or Jarome and the coaching staff here.\" Gamble conceded he faced a battle at the selection table, with neither he nor Cogger likely to oust Jackson Hastings after the halfback's stellar year as the Knights' game manager. \"It's going to be a contest for positions next year and that's when a club's thriving,\" Gamble said. If the Knights were to beat Canberra and the Panthers lose to the Warriors, Cogger and Gamble's similar careers would converge in a knock-out semi-final. \"He's come back from the Super League and he's taken his opportunity with two hands, sort of like I have,\" Gamble said of his soon-to-be-teammate. \"I wish him the best for the finals series - I think he'd say the same to me.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-08 02:27:10","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11840189/093567f82625cd3dbc3cc155b662397fa6536484-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"577d41ab9090406b9d4e53aee639b537","title":"France beat Ireland 2-0 to stay perfect in European Championship qualifiers","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/football/france-beat-ireland-2-0-to-stay-perfect-in-european-championship-qualifiers-101694139168620.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion.","content":"France extended its perfect start to its European Championship qualifying campaign to five matches with a 2-0 win over Ireland on Thursday. (From L to R) Dayot Upamecano, Theo Hernandez, Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappe, Lucas Hernandez and Antoine Griezmann celebrate the second goal during the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament Group B qualifying match between France and Republic of Ireland(AFP) A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion. Didier Deschamps' team has been rock solid so far and has not conceded a goal, topping Group B with 15 points and a nine-point lead over the Netherlands and Greece. The Dutch, who defeated their Greek rivals 3-0, have two matches in hand. Aurelien Tchouameni and Marcus Thuram scored France’s goals at the Parc des Princes. The game was played at Paris Saint-Germain's stadium because of the Rugby World Cup’s opening game scheduled Friday at the Stade de France. Deschamps made four changes to the team that defeated Greece 1-0 in the previous game, with striker Olivier Giroud starting up front in place of Randal Kolo Muani. Giroud’s 125th appearance did not last long, though, as he was replaced by Thuram after just 25 minutes with an apparent ankle injury following contact with an Irish player. Playing in front of his home crowd, PSG forward Kylian Mbappe delivered the assist for Tchouameni’s opener. Another PSG player, Ousmane Dembele, was a threat throughout down the right. Irish forward Chiedozie Ogbene's pace down the right flank faded quite quickly, and France took control after Tchouameni broke the deadlock in the 19th minute. Before that, a direct free kick from Antoine Griezmann had almost caught Gavin Bazunu off guard, but the Ireland goalkeeper managed to clear the ball with his chest. There was not much Bazunu could do three minutes later when Tchouameni made the most of Mbappe’s back pass just outside the box to curl a superb 25-meter shot inside the far post. Mbappe thought he had doubled France’s lead before the interval following a quick combination with Thuram, but a VAR check confirmed his teammate was in an offside position in the buildup. Thuram made it 2-0 in the 48th from the rebound after Mbappe’s shot from inside the box was blocked. France goalkeeper Mike Maignan then ensured yet another clean sheet with a reflex save to deny Ogbene’s header.

The Lions will host Port Adelaide at the Gabba on Saturday, split by only percentage after a 17-win season that began with a heavy Power win in Adelaide in round one. Brisbane did not lose a game at home during the regular season, but Fagan knows that is now irrelevant with the jury still out on their finals credentials thanks to a 3-6 post-season record after four consecutive campaigns without a grand-final appearance. The coach has sometimes come across as terse and defensive in September, but on Friday spoke with patience and confidence about what he views as the side's best chance to win a flag since his arrival in 2017. \"I'm as relaxed as you can be ... I was tossing and turning a bit last night imagining the game and how it might pan out but that's just normal stuff,\" he said. \"It feels like we've been getting ready for this for seven years. \"You just want to make the most of your opportunity, not let it slip by. \"I don't think we have done that (in previous seasons), I just don't think we've been quite ready. \"But we've been getting closer all the time and this year is as close as we've been so you've got to try and make the most of that. \"You learn along the way and particularly from your failures and mistakes.\" The rise of Darcy Wilmot, Deven Robertson and Jaspa Fletcher in particular has meant any holes have been filled, Fagan saying the confidence comes from a settled line-up that's proved extremely hard to beat. \"Games we might have lost in the past, we've found a way to win,\" he said. \"We're a tougher side mentally, which is something we deliberately worked on.\" Lincoln McCarthy returns from a calf niggle for Brisbane while Port have had an already tricky week at the selection table compounded by a training injury that ruled out retiring skipper Tom Jonas. Trent McKenzie will return to replace him while ruckman Scott Lycett (knee) and key forward Todd Marshall (hip) are also back. Offensive weapon Charlie Dixon (knee) won't play while coach Ken Hinkley confirmed former skipper Travis Boak will be the substitute after he was dropped from the starting 22. \"We have both got quite experienced teams when it comes to playing finals football but we have both also had our challenges through the back end of finals football,\" Hinkley said. \"That's the one thing that I do know, the best teams qualify. \"Every team that is in there has earned their right to play, but every team also knows that the stakes go up because this is what we play football for.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-08 02:18:06","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11840126/55cb216df48a78b1dc9094724d7c5f4e0fa2531d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d51dc32fc78313d05cbfb0722ff15e74","title":"Can young Saints handle the heat?

So how will the two games play out? We’ve asked and answered the burning questions ahead of Saturday’s two big finals. St Kilda v GWS Last time they met Round 10: St Kilda 13.14 (92) d GWS 12.8 (80) at Giants Stadium Will the Saints be green(e) with envy? The Giants hope that’s the case. What more can be said about Toby Greene? From AFL bad boy to All-Australian captain, Greene is must-watch viewing and can turn a contest in the blink of an eye. That he has 60 goals this season highlights why pound for pound, he may be the best forward in the competition. All-Australian full-back Callum Wilkie is one option to tackle Greene, but the Saints know Jake Riccardi and Jesse Hogan are also major threats. Greene has also been spending more time at centre bounces. Meanwhile, teammate Tom Green is the No.1-ranked player in the competition for disposals and contested possessions per game, and ninth for score involvements. Saints skipper Jack Steele is likely to have the job of curbing Greene. Steele has been a warrior this season, battling a broken collarbone, but the stakes now could not be higher. It’s not easy beating Greene: GWS skipper Toby is one of the best forwards in the competition. Credit: AFL Photos Should the Giants fear playing at the MCG? No. This is a team that has won at an equal-record 10 different venues this year, although the MCG is not one. Their only game at the home of football this season was in round nine, when the Magpies surged to a 65-point win. But these Giants are a far different proposition, having won nine of their past 11 games. However, of concern when assessing their credentials against the past 10 premiers, who were all top six for least points against, and least points against from turnovers, is that the Giants are 10th for the latter (82 points per game) and ninth for the latter (45.4). Will Max be king for a day, and how will the young Saints handle the finals heat? The Saints need Max King to be dominant if they are to win. He booted four when the teams last met, on a day the Saints had only five goalkickers. If goalkickers are at a premium again, he will need to contribute a bag. However, if there is an even spread, three from him could be enough, provided he remains a major marking presence, and brings his small forwards into the contest. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera, Marcus Windhager and Mitch Owens are preparing for their first final. In only their second season, they have become important pieces. The Saints need the three to have a steady afternoon. Max King looms as a potential finals match-winner for the Saints. Credit: AFL Photos How important is the ruck battle? Very. Rowan Marshall may not have the poster-boy image of Max King, but he may well be the Saints’ most important player. Marshall was named in the All-Australian squad, and can influence games with his tap work and marking around the ground. However, unheralded Giant Kieren Briggs has had a strong back-end to the season. Who wins the contested ball? As the graphic below shows, that’s more than likely to be the Saints. Lyon’s imprint is all over this side, and it starts at the coalface. The Saints are ranked fifth for contested possessions, while the more free-flowing Giants are 10th, content to just break even with their opponents. On the flipside, the Saints are equal ninth for uncontested possession, but the Giants are third. So, this shapes as a battle of philosophies. If the Giants can have the ball on their terms, they win. If the Saints turn this into a slug fest, there’s a greater chance they win. Tip: St Kilda by one point. Brisbane Lions v Port Adelaide Last time they met Round one: Port Adelaide 18.18 (126) d Brisbane 11.6 (72) at Adelaide Oval Can Port Adelaide disarm Brisbane’s weaponry up forward? The mix of Joe Daniher and Eric Hipwood as key talls, with Charlie Cameron, Zac Bailey and Cam Rayner among the smalls zipping around at their feet, is enough to scare any side. But with Port Adelaide’s defensive profile leaving a bit to be desired, there’s a genuine question mark around whether the Power are capable of defending such an attacking outfit. The Lions are the No.1 side when it comes to inside-50 differential, while the Power finished the home-and-away season ranked 13th for opposition scores per inside-50. If the Lions own territory, it will be hard to see Port Adelaide restricting the Lions to a low score. The Power must defend by limiting supply. Aliir Aliir’s ability to intercept can’t be understated, but by beating the Lions in the midfield, the Power will be able to play the ball in their front half of the ground and deny the Lions forward entries. Joe Daniher has had a brilliant year for the Lions. Credit: AFL Photos Is shutting down Lachie Neale the key to beating Brisbane? The last time the Brisbane Lions lost, in round 20 to the Gold Coast, Touk Miller sacrificed his game to run with Lachie Neale. Miller kept Neale to just 17 touches, Miller had 29 disposals, and the Suns went on to win by 41 points. Two weeks earlier, Neale had just 19 disposals as the Demons chased down a 26-point deficit to run over Brisbane in the last quarter. They’re the only two games Neale didn’t have 20 or more touches, while in round one, when Port Adelaide thrashed the Lions, Neale had just 20 touches. So, is that the key to beating the Lions? It certainly looks like it goes a long way, but Neale had some niggling issues in rounds 18-22 and appears to have overcome them since. He’s been tagged plenty of times before and plenty of teams have failed. But expect Willem Drew to get the job on Saturday night. Drew played a big role on Nick Daicos when the Power nearly beat the Pies. What bearing will the contested possession count have? When Port Adelaide flogged the Lions in round one, it was on the back of a 150-116 contested possession count. Remarkably, by season’s end, the Lions ranked fourth in the competition for contested possession differential and the Power ranked 16th. The Lions have not lost in 10 matches this season when they’ve won the contested possession differential. Jason Horne-Francis starred in the season opener with 10 contested possessions, supported by Ollie Wines (11), Drew and Xavier Duursma (nine each) and Sam Powell-Pepper (eight). Zak Butters has grown into a contested beast since then too. Guys such as Neale and Josh Dunkley will need to be supported in that area of the ground. Can the Power win without Charlie Dixon? Dixon was another key reason why the Power won in round one. He had six contested marks on that occasion and kicked 3.3, with Todd Marshall kicking four and Willie Rioli and Lachie Jones kicking three each as well. But Dixon has been ruled out of Saturday night’s game after failing to overcome a foot injury that has sidelined him since round 21. Marshall didn’t play in round 24 but looks certain to return to give Port Adelaide’s forward line a focal point. He kicked three goals in round 22 against GWS, and with Scott Lycett to return in the ruck, that should allow Jeremy Finlayson to spend more time forward as well. Finlayson and Marshall will need to shoulder that load without Dixon. Will the Lions handle the pressure? All signs point to the Brisbane Lions winning at home and progressing to a preliminary final at home again in a fortnight’s time. But this won’t be the first time the Lions have played in finals at the Gabba, and under Chris Fagan, they’ve failed to reach a grand final. Loading Two years ago, they lost a qualifying final to Melbourne in Adelaide, but then lost to the Bulldogs at the Gabba in a semi-final. They beat Richmond in 2020 in a qualifying final at the Gabba, but were bundled out in a preliminary final by the Cats. And in 2019, they lost in straight sets, losing to Richmond and GWS in successive weeks in Brisbane. This year has a different feel. Daniher is having his career best season, which has helped Hipwood flourish, the addition of Dunkley has strengthened the Lions’ midfield, and players such as Rayner, Keidean Coleman and Hugh McCluggage have matured into consistent performers.

The export market of kickers who have switched Sherrins for Wilsons is now so big that in recent years as many as one in three punters in the 120 FSB (NCAA division 1) college football teams have been Australians. And following on from early trailblazers like Darren Bennett, Ben Graham and Sav Rocca, Australians continue to have an outsized presence in the NFL, led by the game’s highest-paid punter Michael Dickson, who plays with the Seattle Seahawks. So for American audiences to be wowed by the story of former Perth scaffolder Lou Hedley says everything about the originality of a rookie punter labelled “the most interesting man in the NFL”. Lou Hedley is becoming a cult hero before he’s even kicked a ball. Credit: Getty At the ripe old age of 30, Hedley will make his debut for the New Orleans Saints on Monday (3am AEST), punting against the Tennessee Titans at the Louisiana Superdome. But before he has even kicked a ball, Hedley’s profile is already skyrocketing, courtesy of his heavily-tattooed physique, a social media bromance with Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and the unlikeliest journey taken to an NFL roster in many years. Hedley grew up Leeman in Western Australia, a fishing town with a population of about 700 where his father was a cray fisherman. After moving to Perth when he was 10, Hedley set his sights on becoming a footballer and though promising enough at fullback to play reserves for Peel Thunder in the WAFL, he didn’t push on further. Having dropped out of school, Hedley became a scaffolder at 17 and, as he worked on skyscrapers and mine sites for the next five years, developed a passion for tattoos. With good mate and now Fremantle defender Nathan Wilson, Hedley even became a co-owner of a tattoo shop in Bali. He is covered neck to toe in ink, and now delights US media by running through some of his more interesting tattoos, which includes one of aliens kidnapping a cow. The flame of Hedley’s sporting ambition hadn’t died, though, and after impressing with his big right kicking boot at a trial with ProKick Australia coaches in WA, he was invited to Melbourne to join the respected academy. Run by Nathan Chapman and John Smith, ProKick Australia began in 2007 to help turn AFL athletes into punters and is now a pumping production line for US colleges, who love the Aussie kickers. Since 2007 seven graduates have received the best college kicker award, hundreds have won scholarships and four are currently active on NFL rosters – including Hedley. “We knew he had some tattoos but he just, straight away, showed himself to be humble, quiet and determined and that was a really good start,” Chapman said. “Visually, he was different to the general profile. But he just got to work. He was like ‘hey I am here, I have moved interstate and sacrificed a lot to have a crack at something where I don’t know the outcome’ and he wanted to do it. So his energy towards that shone through.” “He could kick the ball, he was strong, he loved the gym and we knew we had a real special talent there.” Because Hedley had not finished school, he had to go to Junior College in San Francisco to get the grades to qualify for a major university. Hedley sold his share in the tattoo shop, moved into a share house with 12 other athletes and, after 18 months of impressive ‘JuCo’ form, major colleges were knocking on the door of the 193cm, 100kg artwork. Hedley was recruited to the University of Miami in 2019, where he made an instant impact – tattoos aside – by choosing the number of former player, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson. “I learned about the history of it and when I found out the Rock went there and wore 94. I was a huge fan of his growing up, me and my brother used to watch all the wrestling matches. I thought it would be cool to follow in his footsteps,” Hedley said recently. Johnson tweeted his support to Hedley and the pair have continued to trade messages. Lou Hedley punting for University of Miami in the no.94. Credit: Getty Hedley’s career in Miami was a huge success, averaging 45.2 yards (41.3m) in three seasons, and in an accomplishment he rates as equal to his athletic achievement, Hedley also earned a bachelor’s degree in sport administration in 2021 at Miami, before a master’s degree in liberal studies. Hedley was initially overlooked in the NFL draft, but New Orleans signed the Australian as a free agent. After continuing to impress with his “versatility” and work ethic in the pre-season, Hedley then beat the Saints’ incumbent punter to a full-time spot on the 53-man roster, and a guaranteed salary of $A1.1 million. “I always had NFL on the horizon ... so coming over here and working my butt off, it definitely feels surreal but it’s definitely earned. I have worked really hard to get to this point,” Hedley said last week. Loading Hedley joins Dickson (Seahawks), fellow WA product Mitch Wishnowsky (49ers) and Cameron Johnston (Texans) as Australians punting in the NFL in 2023, with Arryn Siposs (Eagles) having been put back to the practice squad after playing in the Super Bowl last year. Chapman said while the colourful aspects of Hedley’s journey are many, the most important was a willingness to put in plain old hard work. “It is not easy, it doesn’t just happen,” Chapman said. “There is a lot of work that goes into it, and it’s why we get really proud because you can’t hurry this. It is an amazing opportunity and a job not many people get to do but it took him six years to do it.” Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

Welcome to Nicho Hynes’ world.","content":"Nicho Hynes wheels around his backyard, Steeden in hand. Long locks flowing. Ray Warren in his ears. A chip and chase here. 100-metre intercept there. If he’s had a big breakfast, maybe even a shoulder charge for older, simpler times’ sake. It’s a lovely scene, with not as much salt and pepper as you might think. Because several hours before the Roosters descend on Shark Park with seasons and semi-finals on the line, Hynes will be right there in his backyard. Paul Gallen had a key to the Shark Park gates for much of his career, club trainers sick of getting called in to open up the gym or ice baths at all hours for the workaholic Cronulla captain. Hynes needs a set too. As has been his game-day custom for the past year, takes to the turf long before fans, teammates, security and hospitality staff turn up for work. Long before he’s needed, too. Usually with headphones on, ball in hand, Hynes will have the stadium pretty much to himself as he treads the footballing boards in a game-day dress rehearsal. The childhood fantasies of match-winners and miracle moments though? They stay in another time. “I didn’t think anyone was going to notice that,” Hynes laughs. “It’s a bit of visualisation and it’s something that just prepares me before a game. I put myself in the moment early in the day so that when it gets to kick-off, I feel like I’ve been there before. “I feel like I can nail everything I need to do. I’m looking for my first action when I do it. My first kick in the game. “My first defensive movements. My first kick at goal, hopefully I’ll take that back this week (Hynes gave up the kicking tee ). “I’m just looking at different parts of the field where I’ll find myself with different kicks, different defensive situations. I’ll try to picture different attacking sets and positions. “I’m walking around visualising it all. It’s not like I’m chasing an extra thing I need to do. I’ve put the work in during the week. It’s just my thing and my way of getting into the game.” Hynes’ resilience and refreshing candour around mental health has rightly been celebrated since his NRL arrival with Melbourne. This year he has weathered off-field drama when his mother, Julie, spent time in custody and was found guilty of drug charges. In a purely footballing sense, 2023 has also delivered the first hurdles – and stumbles – of Hynes’ career. With last year’s Dally M medal (secured with the highest points tally in history), came expectation by the bucketload. A $6 million, six-year Sharks extension added plenty. The fervour and fever of Origin selection fizzled into Hynes before he was axed. A glaring spotlight, niggling injuries and uncharacteristic on-field frustrations played out in a tripping charge and back-chatting to the referee against Manly. “It hasn’t been easy for him,” coach Craig Fitzgibbon tells this masthead. “It’s been uncomfortable at times for him. I think he felt the spotlight and the pressure. But his response was ‘I’m going to dominate’. That’s awesome. “One thing he’s never, ever shied away from, which you’ve got to respect, he never sat back or withdrew. “He went the other way. He doubled down and did more work. Sometimes, the harder you try, you take yourself further away from what you’re aiming for. “I respect his workrate and ethic. Nicho went after the solution. He said, ‘I’m doing something about this, I’m working harder’.” When Fitzgibbon – one-time owner of the record for most tackles in an Origin game – admires your work ethic, you’re going to be alright. Cronulla’s late-season resurgence, with Hynes playing what Fitzgibbon sees as “more controlled, measured performances” has bookmakers unable to split the home side on Saturday night. “He’s still in his second year as an NRL halfback so he’s picking all of it up pretty quickly,” Fitzgibbon says. “It’s easy to say, ‘get out there and control a game’. “Actually getting it done... you don’t want to let moments go past. But that judgment of which moments to take, which moments do you leave alone and not take a risk, it’s not as easy as it sounds. “There’s a reason most of the experienced halves are the ones playing the best footy at this time of year.” For his part, Hynes is cramming as though halfbacks sit the HSC. He spoke during the week of learning from each lesson presented this year – Origin axings, form drop-offs and Cronulla losses among them. The 27-year-old has long figured that his brain is a muscle to be trained and looked after like any other as an athlete. His Dally M acceptance speech last year included a poignant nod to his friend and mindset coach Jarred Brown, who Hynes employed when he moved from Melbourne to Sydney in anticipation of the added exposure and pressure. His latest pre-game visualisation techniques are another trick of the trade, taught by another professional Hynes prefers to keep under wraps. “I don’t really want to expose him right now,” Hynes says. “He’s a big hitter in that space and a lot of people want to be mentored by him. I won’t give that one away because he’s a guy that I really like working with and I want to keep him to myself. “But even that three-game stretch of losses (which threatened to drop the Sharks out of the finals race in July) I’ve never really been in that position before, that was the first time in my career that I’ve lost three in row. “There’s plenty of lessons learned from that, I’ve simplified my game plan and the way I play a little bit. I’m just trying to stick to the little things. When they work well for our team, we play well.”","pubDate":"2023-09-08 01:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"brisbanetimes","source_priority":189315,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cf317bb10927b7e09c14f553ce7783b9","title":"Tyson Fury considering octagon clash after facing Francis Ngannou in Riyadh bout","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23775792.tyson-fury-considering-octagon-clash-facing-francis-ngannou-riyadh-bout/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Fury has faced plenty of scrutiny since his fight with the former UFC world heavyweight champion was announced.","content":"Fury has faced plenty of scrutiny since it was announced in July that he would next step in the ring with former UFC world heavyweight champion Ngannou on October 28 in Saudi Arabia.

Moore and all those picks to the Bears so they could move up to draft Bryce Young first overall, but that day won’t be Sunday. In his NFL debut the former Alabama QB will be facing an Atlanta defence that has little in the way of a pass rush, but Young will also be on the road and probably without his banged up top two receivers, Adam Thielen and D.J. Chark Jr. Falcons have the makings of an exciting offence, with the eighth overall pick, RB Bijan Robinson, a threat out of the backfield that will create room for WR Drake London and third-year TE Kyle Pitts. This one opened at a more comfortable three points, but the unproven Desmond Ridder will move the ball enough that the Dirty Birds cover the slightly boosted number. TAKING: ATLANTA -3.5 SCORE (O/U: 39.5): Falcons 27, Panthers 20 LINE: Baltimore by 10 Also making his NFL debut will be No. 2 pick C.J. Stroud, but the task facing him is much more formidable, as the 21-year-old former Buckeyes QB is facing a top tier defence on extremely hostile soil. Lamar Jackson hasn’t played since throwing just four passes against the Broncos on Dec. 4, and now he’s back, healthy, armed with a brand new big money contact and set of receivers that includes Odell Beckham Jr. and Zay Flowers to go along with the exceptional Rashod Bateman and, of course, Mark Andrews. Also back from injury is J.K. Dobbins, and he’ll feast on a Texans runs defence that was dead last in the league last season. Ravens have everything it takes to be a Super Bowl contender and their march towards that goal starts with a gimme. Baltimore is, by far, the safest Survivor Pool pick for Week 1. TAKING: BALTIMORE -10 SCORE (O/U: 43.5): Ravens 30, Texans 7 LINE: Buffalo by 2.5 One of the most replayed rants in NFL history came from Cardinals coach Dennis Green after an early season, 20-point loss to Chicago in 2009. I’m not thinking of “the Bears are what we thought they were” part, but the “if you want to crown them, then crown their ass” near the end. After all their additions and growth, it seems a large number of people want to crown the Jets, but the Bills are not even near ready to relinquish their AFC East throne. Devoid of all the hype they remain among the top three betting odds favourites for the Super Bowl. While they’re still learning how to win, Jets remain at an elementary school level in that course. They may be a “sexy pick” to win the division, but they’ve got to go through Buffalo to get there. Josh Allen and company will remind them of that on Monday. I’d like the Bills even more if Von Miller wasn’t on the PUP list for the first four games, but they still have more overall talent than the Jets. They still have better receivers, a better running attack (especially with Breece Hall not yet 100 percent) and a slightly better defence. I’ll also take a hungry 27-year-old Allen over an almost-40 year old former champion like Aaron Rodgers, even if the latter is driven to prove himself in a different shade of green. TAKING: BUFFALO -2.5 SCORE: (O/U: 46.5): Bills 23, Jets 17 And the rest … LINE: Cincinnati by 2.5 In case you didn’t know, Joe’s a go. After missing a month and a half of training camp with a calf injury, Bengals QB Joe Burrow was a full participant at practice this week and is expected to lead his vaunted gang into a Battle of Ohio that could be the best game of Week 1. DeShaun Watson was pretty bad in his six starts with the Browns last season — and he was nothing to write home about in the preseason just past — but he is surely now familiar with the Cleveland offence and anxious to get back on the path to stardom he was strolled before throwing himself into all sorts of hot water away from the field. With the likes of Nick Chubb, Amari Cooper and Myles Garrett in starring roles — and noting that the Browns have won eight of the past 10 meetings, including the last five in Cleveland — I’m siding with the upset and this dog at home in the Pound. TAKING: CLEVELAND +2.5 SCORE (O/U: 47.5): Browns 27, Bengals 21 LINE: Jacksonville by 5 CHEWABLE: The home team has won the last 11 games between these two AFC South opponents. That streak is about to end. Fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson didn’t look ready for this level as he struggled to complete passes in the preseason. Without Jonathan Taylor the Colts will take a RB-by-committee approach against a Jags solid run defence. Indy will again be without perennially concussed LB Shaq Leonard, while Trevor Lawrence builds on an outstanding finish to 2023 with a very dangerous weapon added to his arsenal: WR Calvin Ridley. Jags successful defence of their division crown will begin on the right note, but that number is too big for my liking. TAKING: INDIANAPOLIS +5 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Jags 24, Colts 20 LINE: Minnesota by 6 For a former first overall pick who, five years later has still done his best work as a professional in insurance commercials, Baker Mayfield couldn’t have asked for a better opponent to face at the start of the next chapter in his QB career. Okay, maybe one, as only the Titans had a more porous pass defence than the Vikings in 2022. Vikings offence might even be better with 23rd overall pick Jordan Addison giving Kirk Cousins somebody other than Justin Jefferson that can sting opponents deeply, but their secondary is still an open wound. Poised before it with salt shakers in hand are Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. TAKING: TAMPA BAY +6 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Buccaneers 28, Vikings 27. LINE: New Orleans by 3 Signs are pointing to an upset here. Derek Carr makes his debut for the Saints, but his O-line projects to be subpar while the Titans have a strong pass rush, and he won’t have Alvin Kamara as an outlet. The addition of DeAndre Hopkins gives the Titans the quality replacement for A.J. Brown they lacked last year. Whether Derrick Henry starts to slow down as a 29-year-old, it shouldn’t be against a Saints defence that was 24th against the rush defence. Tennessee has never lost in New Orleans, winning all three visits since the relocation from Houston plus the last one made as the Oilers. Saints are 3-17 ATS in the first two weeks of the season since 2013, and Mike Vrabel, one of the best coaches in the NFL, is 22-9 ATS as a dog getting 3+ points. TAKING: TENNESSEE +3 SCORE (O/U: 45.50): Titans 23, Saints 17 LINE: San Francisco by 2.5 What a matchup! Two great coaches, two elite defences, two outstanding pass rushers, two young quarterbacks and two teams with big playmakers with the ball. If Nick Bosa does have a “beer belly” he’ll fit right in at Acrisure (formerly Heinz Field) Stadium and, after a long holdout, his presence will give the Niners a big boost. Brock Purdy has only started on the road against a ‘D’ this good once before – in last season’s conference championship game 31-7 loss to the Eagles – but he suffered an elbow injury on the first series and only returned later because his backup suffered a concussion. Kyle Shanahan will help him through this one. Ultimately, a healthy Christian McCaffrey, in his first season opener wearing scarlet, white and gold, will make the difference. TAKING: SAN FRANCISCO -2.5 SCORE (O/U: 41.5): Niners 20, Steelers 17 LINE: Washington by 7 CHEWABLE: Minus Kyler Murray, the Cardinals have an awful offence and so far have kept the identity of their starting QB — either Joshua Dobbs or Clayton Tune — a state secret. Next year it should be the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, USC’s Caleb Williams, who they’ll be able to draft first overall while trading Murray. Meanwhile, the Arizona defence is equally bad and should be overmatched by a Washington offence led by QB Sammy Howell (in his second NFL start) and could be missing WR Terry McLaurin (turf toe). TAKING: WASHINGTON -7 SCORE (O/U: 38): Commanders 24, Cardinals 9 LINE: Chicago by 1 In case you’ve lost count, Packers have won the last eight, 13 of the last 14 and 23 of the last 26 meeting in this, football’s oldest rivalry. Now begins the Jordan Love era in Green Bay, and armed with a group of young receivers, expect him to turn to veteran RBs Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon against a Bears run defence that ranked 31st last season. But Chicago will also be able to run the ball with Khalil Hebert against the Packers 26th ranked run D, and rookie RT Darnell Wright, the 10th overall pick, will anchor an improved Chicago offensive line. Justin Fields will benefit greatly from this, as well as the addition of Moore, but don’t disregard how much the latter’s addition will open up space for Darnell Mooney and Cole Kmet. TAKING: CHICAGO -1 SCORE (O/U: 42.5): Bears 27, Packers 24 LINE: Broncos by 3.5 Veteran QBs Russell Wilson and Jimmy Garoppolo are coming off nightmarish seasons and will have to survive behind shaky offensive lines, and in Wilson’s case it could take some fancy footwork with Maxx Crosby in his face. The impact of Sean Payton as Denver coach should be immediate, and latest reports have Jerry Jeudy (hamstring) possibly back for this one. Raiders have won the last six meetings and eight of the last nine in this series, and that trend will end here. But that extra half point has us leaning with the visitors. TAKING: RAIDERS +3.5 SCORE (O/U: 44): Broncos 23, Raiders 20 LINE: Los Angeles by 3 With all the offensive talent on the field, particularly at the receiver positions, new Chargers OC Kellen Moore and Dolphins play calling head coach Mike McDaniel could resemble a couple of kids with a Madden video game. We’d like the Fish a lot more had they not lost Jalen Ramsey, who they acquired in the off-season for a third round pick, to a torn meniscus at camp. As is, it’s difficult not to bet on Justin Herbert with Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and the explosive Austin Ekeler coming out of the backfield. Tua Tagovailoa has Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle — and don’t underestimate Raheem Mostert — but last season he completed just 10-of-28 passes in a 23-17 road loss to the Chargers, who didn’t have Joey Bosa in the lineup. Bosa and Khalil Mack will make it even more difficult for Tua to operate this time. TAKING: LOS ANGELES -3 SCORE (O/U: 51.5): Chargers 36, Dolphins 27 LINE: Philadelphia by 4 Of course the Eagles are the superior team. It’s not close. But Tom Brady will be in honored at Gillette Stadium, Mac Jones has looked good at camp and Bill Belichick has had a very long time to prepare for this one. Patriots also have an ace in the hole in Ezekiel Elliott. In 12 games against the Eagles as a Cowboy, Zeke was on the winning side nine times while racking up more rushing yards (1,107, average 4.75 per carry) and receiving yards (357, 7.29 per catch) than any other opponent. Jalen Hurts will be facing Belichick for the first time, and The Hoodie has had trouble defending mobile QBs, but the Patriots need to get off to a better start more than the Eagles, who are likely headed back to at least the NFC championship game no matter what happens Sunday. TAKING: NEW ENGLAND +4 SCORE (O/U: 45): Patriots 20, Eagles 17 LINE: Seattle by 5.5 Before the news that Cooper Krupp (hamstring) will miss this game makes you jump to the Seahawks know that the superstar WR didn’t play in either meeting between the teams last year, and while Seattle won both, the margins of victory were three (at home) and four points (in L.A.). The Rams also didn’t have Matthew Stafford for either game, with Baker Mayfield (13-of-26, 0 TDs, 1 pick) going the distance in Seattle and John Wolford (14-of-26, 0 TDs, 2 picks) in L.A., and Stafford is now healthy. The surprising resurrection of Geno Smith will continue this season — he certainly has the weapons — but Rams will keep Game 1 close largely because Cam Akers will again run through a Seattle run defence that ranked 30th in 2022. TAKING: LOS ANGELES +5.5 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Seahawks 28, Los Angeles 24 LINE: Dallas by 3.5 A team has to be significantly overmatched if I’m going to turn down more than three points when it’s at home against a division rival. The Giants aren’t significantly overmatched here. Sure Dallas is better, improved from even last year, but Big Blue has added to Daniel Jones’ arsenal by trading for Darren Waller and drafting Jalin Hyatt out of Tennessee, and Saquon Barkley is always a factor, either by ground or air. Cowboys have won the last four meetings and 11 of the last 12, but Belichick disciple Brian Daboll wins the coaching matchup with Mike McCarthy, and if you’re going to beat Daboll three times in a row the third one is going to be very close. Liking the upset. TAKING: NEW YORK +3.5 SCORE (O/U: 46.5): Giants 24, Cowboys 23 Detroit +4.5 over KANSAS CITY WASHINGTON -7 over Arizona ATLANTA -3.5 over Carolina* CLEVELAND +2.5 over Cincinnati BALTIMORE -10 over Houston PITTSBURGH +2.5 over San Francisco Tampa Bay +6 over MINNESOTA Jacksonville -5 over INDIANAPOLIS Tennessee +3 over NEW ORLEANS SEATTLE -5.5 over L.A.

Gamble arrived at the Knights this season as a fringe first-grader but became Adam O'Brien's first-choice five-eighth after Kalyn Ponga reverted to fullback mid-campaign. He has played almost as many games this year (22) as in his entire career prior to 2023 (25), proving a dangerous option with the ball during the Knights' ongoing nine-game winning streak. Sunday's home elimination final against Canberra continues the 27-year-old Gamble's quest to once-and-for-all cement his status as a long-term, first-choice half in the NRL. \"That's where I'm at now,\" Gamble told AAP. \"I'd like to think I've done enough to keep my jersey. \"But if you take that mindset into a pre-season, you don't put your best foot forward and things can go downhill really quickly.\" Standing in Gamble's way is Penrith's back-up playmaker Cogger, who comes into the finals series with a similar chance to shine ahead of his return to Newcastle next year. Where Gamble's strength lies in playing eyes-up football, Cogger is a more natural game manager. But like Gamble, he has only been a first-choice half in fits and starts. Having returned from a two-year stint in England, Cogger was a capable understudy for Nathan Cleary when Penrith's first-choice No.7 went down with a hamstring injury during the State of Origin period. Saturday's qualifying final against the Warriors is his second full game in a stint replacing five-eighth Jarome Luai, whose dislocated shoulder will keep him out until at least the third week of finals. Cogger was electric in the minor premiers' last-start defeat of North Queensland and after debuting at Newcastle in 2016, he returns to the club in 2024 intent on clinching his own spot in the halves. \"All things lead to that,\" he told AAP. \"But at the moment my job's here at Penrith. \"My best years are ahead of me (after) being part of a really successful system (at Penrith) and being able to work side-by-side with Nathan or Jarome and the coaching staff here.\" Gamble conceded he faced a battle at the selection table, with neither he nor Cogger likely to oust Jackson Hastings after the halfback's stellar year as the Knights' game manager. \"It's going to be a contest for positions next year and that's when a club's thriving,\" Gamble said. If the Knights were to beat Canberra and the Panthers lose to the Warriors, Cogger and Gamble's similar careers would converge in a knock-out semi-final. \"He's come back from the Super League and he's taken his opportunity with two hands, sort of like I have,\" Gamble said of his soon-to-be-teammate. \"I wish him the best for the finals series - I think he'd say the same to me.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-08 02:27:10","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11840189/093567f82625cd3dbc3cc155b662397fa6536484-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"577d41ab9090406b9d4e53aee639b537","title":"France beat Ireland 2-0 to stay perfect in European Championship qualifiers","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/football/france-beat-ireland-2-0-to-stay-perfect-in-european-championship-qualifiers-101694139168620.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion.","content":"France extended its perfect start to its European Championship qualifying campaign to five matches with a 2-0 win over Ireland on Thursday. (From L to R) Dayot Upamecano, Theo Hernandez, Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappe, Lucas Hernandez and Antoine Griezmann celebrate the second goal during the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament Group B qualifying match between France and Republic of Ireland(AFP) A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion. Didier Deschamps' team has been rock solid so far and has not conceded a goal, topping Group B with 15 points and a nine-point lead over the Netherlands and Greece. The Dutch, who defeated their Greek rivals 3-0, have two matches in hand. Aurelien Tchouameni and Marcus Thuram scored France’s goals at the Parc des Princes. The game was played at Paris Saint-Germain's stadium because of the Rugby World Cup’s opening game scheduled Friday at the Stade de France. Deschamps made four changes to the team that defeated Greece 1-0 in the previous game, with striker Olivier Giroud starting up front in place of Randal Kolo Muani. Giroud’s 125th appearance did not last long, though, as he was replaced by Thuram after just 25 minutes with an apparent ankle injury following contact with an Irish player. Playing in front of his home crowd, PSG forward Kylian Mbappe delivered the assist for Tchouameni’s opener. Another PSG player, Ousmane Dembele, was a threat throughout down the right. Irish forward Chiedozie Ogbene's pace down the right flank faded quite quickly, and France took control after Tchouameni broke the deadlock in the 19th minute. Before that, a direct free kick from Antoine Griezmann had almost caught Gavin Bazunu off guard, but the Ireland goalkeeper managed to clear the ball with his chest. There was not much Bazunu could do three minutes later when Tchouameni made the most of Mbappe’s back pass just outside the box to curl a superb 25-meter shot inside the far post. Mbappe thought he had doubled France’s lead before the interval following a quick combination with Thuram, but a VAR check confirmed his teammate was in an offside position in the buildup. Thuram made it 2-0 in the 48th from the rebound after Mbappe’s shot from inside the box was blocked. France goalkeeper Mike Maignan then ensured yet another clean sheet with a reflex save to deny Ogbene’s header.

The Lions will host Port Adelaide at the Gabba on Saturday, split by only percentage after a 17-win season that began with a heavy Power win in Adelaide in round one. Brisbane did not lose a game at home during the regular season, but Fagan knows that is now irrelevant with the jury still out on their finals credentials thanks to a 3-6 post-season record after four consecutive campaigns without a grand-final appearance. The coach has sometimes come across as terse and defensive in September, but on Friday spoke with patience and confidence about what he views as the side's best chance to win a flag since his arrival in 2017. \"I'm as relaxed as you can be ... I was tossing and turning a bit last night imagining the game and how it might pan out but that's just normal stuff,\" he said. \"It feels like we've been getting ready for this for seven years. \"You just want to make the most of your opportunity, not let it slip by. \"I don't think we have done that (in previous seasons), I just don't think we've been quite ready. \"But we've been getting closer all the time and this year is as close as we've been so you've got to try and make the most of that. \"You learn along the way and particularly from your failures and mistakes.\" The rise of Darcy Wilmot, Deven Robertson and Jaspa Fletcher in particular has meant any holes have been filled, Fagan saying the confidence comes from a settled line-up that's proved extremely hard to beat. \"Games we might have lost in the past, we've found a way to win,\" he said. \"We're a tougher side mentally, which is something we deliberately worked on.\" Lincoln McCarthy returns from a calf niggle for Brisbane while Port have had an already tricky week at the selection table compounded by a training injury that ruled out retiring skipper Tom Jonas. Trent McKenzie will return to replace him while ruckman Scott Lycett (knee) and key forward Todd Marshall (hip) are also back. Offensive weapon Charlie Dixon (knee) won't play while coach Ken Hinkley confirmed former skipper Travis Boak will be the substitute after he was dropped from the starting 22. \"We have both got quite experienced teams when it comes to playing finals football but we have both also had our challenges through the back end of finals football,\" Hinkley said. \"That's the one thing that I do know, the best teams qualify. \"Every team that is in there has earned their right to play, but every team also knows that the stakes go up because this is what we play football for.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-08 02:18:06","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11840126/55cb216df48a78b1dc9094724d7c5f4e0fa2531d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d51dc32fc78313d05cbfb0722ff15e74","title":"Can young Saints handle the heat?

So how will the two games play out? We’ve asked and answered the burning questions ahead of Saturday’s two big finals. St Kilda v GWS Last time they met Round 10: St Kilda 13.14 (92) d GWS 12.8 (80) at Giants Stadium Will the Saints be green(e) with envy? The Giants hope that’s the case. What more can be said about Toby Greene? From AFL bad boy to All-Australian captain, Greene is must-watch viewing and can turn a contest in the blink of an eye. That he has 60 goals this season highlights why pound for pound, he may be the best forward in the competition. All-Australian full-back Callum Wilkie is one option to tackle Greene, but the Saints know Jake Riccardi and Jesse Hogan are also major threats. Greene has also been spending more time at centre bounces. Meanwhile, teammate Tom Green is the No.1-ranked player in the competition for disposals and contested possessions per game, and ninth for score involvements. Saints skipper Jack Steele is likely to have the job of curbing Greene. Steele has been a warrior this season, battling a broken collarbone, but the stakes now could not be higher. It’s not easy beating Greene: GWS skipper Toby is one of the best forwards in the competition. Credit: AFL Photos Should the Giants fear playing at the MCG? No. This is a team that has won at an equal-record 10 different venues this year, although the MCG is not one. Their only game at the home of football this season was in round nine, when the Magpies surged to a 65-point win. But these Giants are a far different proposition, having won nine of their past 11 games. However, of concern when assessing their credentials against the past 10 premiers, who were all top six for least points against, and least points against from turnovers, is that the Giants are 10th for the latter (82 points per game) and ninth for the latter (45.4). Will Max be king for a day, and how will the young Saints handle the finals heat? The Saints need Max King to be dominant if they are to win. He booted four when the teams last met, on a day the Saints had only five goalkickers. If goalkickers are at a premium again, he will need to contribute a bag. However, if there is an even spread, three from him could be enough, provided he remains a major marking presence, and brings his small forwards into the contest. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera, Marcus Windhager and Mitch Owens are preparing for their first final. In only their second season, they have become important pieces. The Saints need the three to have a steady afternoon. Max King looms as a potential finals match-winner for the Saints. Credit: AFL Photos How important is the ruck battle? Very. Rowan Marshall may not have the poster-boy image of Max King, but he may well be the Saints’ most important player. Marshall was named in the All-Australian squad, and can influence games with his tap work and marking around the ground. However, unheralded Giant Kieren Briggs has had a strong back-end to the season. Who wins the contested ball? As the graphic below shows, that’s more than likely to be the Saints. Lyon’s imprint is all over this side, and it starts at the coalface. The Saints are ranked fifth for contested possessions, while the more free-flowing Giants are 10th, content to just break even with their opponents. On the flipside, the Saints are equal ninth for uncontested possession, but the Giants are third. So, this shapes as a battle of philosophies. If the Giants can have the ball on their terms, they win. If the Saints turn this into a slug fest, there’s a greater chance they win. Tip: St Kilda by one point. Brisbane Lions v Port Adelaide Last time they met Round one: Port Adelaide 18.18 (126) d Brisbane 11.6 (72) at Adelaide Oval Can Port Adelaide disarm Brisbane’s weaponry up forward? The mix of Joe Daniher and Eric Hipwood as key talls, with Charlie Cameron, Zac Bailey and Cam Rayner among the smalls zipping around at their feet, is enough to scare any side. But with Port Adelaide’s defensive profile leaving a bit to be desired, there’s a genuine question mark around whether the Power are capable of defending such an attacking outfit. The Lions are the No.1 side when it comes to inside-50 differential, while the Power finished the home-and-away season ranked 13th for opposition scores per inside-50. If the Lions own territory, it will be hard to see Port Adelaide restricting the Lions to a low score. The Power must defend by limiting supply. Aliir Aliir’s ability to intercept can’t be understated, but by beating the Lions in the midfield, the Power will be able to play the ball in their front half of the ground and deny the Lions forward entries. Joe Daniher has had a brilliant year for the Lions. Credit: AFL Photos Is shutting down Lachie Neale the key to beating Brisbane? The last time the Brisbane Lions lost, in round 20 to the Gold Coast, Touk Miller sacrificed his game to run with Lachie Neale. Miller kept Neale to just 17 touches, Miller had 29 disposals, and the Suns went on to win by 41 points. Two weeks earlier, Neale had just 19 disposals as the Demons chased down a 26-point deficit to run over Brisbane in the last quarter. They’re the only two games Neale didn’t have 20 or more touches, while in round one, when Port Adelaide thrashed the Lions, Neale had just 20 touches. So, is that the key to beating the Lions? It certainly looks like it goes a long way, but Neale had some niggling issues in rounds 18-22 and appears to have overcome them since. He’s been tagged plenty of times before and plenty of teams have failed. But expect Willem Drew to get the job on Saturday night. Drew played a big role on Nick Daicos when the Power nearly beat the Pies. What bearing will the contested possession count have? When Port Adelaide flogged the Lions in round one, it was on the back of a 150-116 contested possession count. Remarkably, by season’s end, the Lions ranked fourth in the competition for contested possession differential and the Power ranked 16th. The Lions have not lost in 10 matches this season when they’ve won the contested possession differential. Jason Horne-Francis starred in the season opener with 10 contested possessions, supported by Ollie Wines (11), Drew and Xavier Duursma (nine each) and Sam Powell-Pepper (eight). Zak Butters has grown into a contested beast since then too. Guys such as Neale and Josh Dunkley will need to be supported in that area of the ground. Can the Power win without Charlie Dixon? Dixon was another key reason why the Power won in round one. He had six contested marks on that occasion and kicked 3.3, with Todd Marshall kicking four and Willie Rioli and Lachie Jones kicking three each as well. But Dixon has been ruled out of Saturday night’s game after failing to overcome a foot injury that has sidelined him since round 21. Marshall didn’t play in round 24 but looks certain to return to give Port Adelaide’s forward line a focal point. He kicked three goals in round 22 against GWS, and with Scott Lycett to return in the ruck, that should allow Jeremy Finlayson to spend more time forward as well. Finlayson and Marshall will need to shoulder that load without Dixon. Will the Lions handle the pressure? All signs point to the Brisbane Lions winning at home and progressing to a preliminary final at home again in a fortnight’s time. But this won’t be the first time the Lions have played in finals at the Gabba, and under Chris Fagan, they’ve failed to reach a grand final. Loading Two years ago, they lost a qualifying final to Melbourne in Adelaide, but then lost to the Bulldogs at the Gabba in a semi-final. They beat Richmond in 2020 in a qualifying final at the Gabba, but were bundled out in a preliminary final by the Cats. And in 2019, they lost in straight sets, losing to Richmond and GWS in successive weeks in Brisbane. This year has a different feel. Daniher is having his career best season, which has helped Hipwood flourish, the addition of Dunkley has strengthened the Lions’ midfield, and players such as Rayner, Keidean Coleman and Hugh McCluggage have matured into consistent performers.

Michael Edwards is set to make his return to sport after departing his role as Liverpool sporting director. According to the 44-year-old will reunite with the Reds former director of research Dr Ian Graham - joining as a non-executive director of Graham's new venture, Ludonautics. The revelation sees a temporary end to speculation linking with a return to football , moving aside for Julian Ward to take the mantle.. He arrived at in 2011, following stints with Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth, and after deciding not to extend his role on Merseyside, Edwards' was speculated to have been in line to take hierarchical roles at Newcastle United and Manchester United, which never came to fruition. Liverpool have held firm in their unwillingness to sell Mohamed Salah to Saudi Arabia in this summer's transfer window.

The export market of kickers who have switched Sherrins for Wilsons is now so big that in recent years as many as one in three punters in the 120 FSB (NCAA division 1) college football teams have been Australians. And following on from early trailblazers like Darren Bennett, Ben Graham and Sav Rocca, Australians continue to have an outsized presence in the NFL, led by the game’s highest-paid punter Michael Dickson, who plays with the Seattle Seahawks. So for American audiences to be wowed by the story of former Perth scaffolder Lou Hedley says everything about the originality of a rookie punter labelled “the most interesting man in the NFL”. Lou Hedley is becoming a cult hero before he’s even kicked a ball. Credit: Getty At the ripe old age of 30, Hedley will make his debut for the New Orleans Saints on Monday (3am AEST), punting against the Tennessee Titans at the Louisiana Superdome. But before he has even kicked a ball, Hedley’s profile is already skyrocketing, courtesy of his heavily-tattooed physique, a social media bromance with Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and the unlikeliest journey taken to an NFL roster in many years. Hedley grew up Leeman in Western Australia, a fishing town with a population of about 700 where his father was a cray fisherman. After moving to Perth when he was 10, Hedley set his sights on becoming a footballer and though promising enough at fullback to play reserves for Peel Thunder in the WAFL, he didn’t push on further. Having dropped out of school, Hedley became a scaffolder at 17 and, as he worked on skyscrapers and mine sites for the next five years, developed a passion for tattoos. With good mate and now Fremantle defender Nathan Wilson, Hedley even became a co-owner of a tattoo shop in Bali. He is covered neck to toe in ink, and now delights US media by running through some of his more interesting tattoos, which includes one of aliens kidnapping a cow. The flame of Hedley’s sporting ambition hadn’t died, though, and after impressing with his big right kicking boot at a trial with ProKick Australia coaches in WA, he was invited to Melbourne to join the respected academy. Run by Nathan Chapman and John Smith, ProKick Australia began in 2007 to help turn AFL athletes into punters and is now a pumping production line for US colleges, who love the Aussie kickers. Since 2007 seven graduates have received the best college kicker award, hundreds have won scholarships and four are currently active on NFL rosters – including Hedley. “We knew he had some tattoos but he just, straight away, showed himself to be humble, quiet and determined and that was a really good start,” Chapman said. “Visually, he was different to the general profile. But he just got to work. He was like ‘hey I am here, I have moved interstate and sacrificed a lot to have a crack at something where I don’t know the outcome’ and he wanted to do it. So his energy towards that shone through.” “He could kick the ball, he was strong, he loved the gym and we knew we had a real special talent there.” Because Hedley had not finished school, he had to go to Junior College in San Francisco to get the grades to qualify for a major university. Hedley sold his share in the tattoo shop, moved into a share house with 12 other athletes and, after 18 months of impressive ‘JuCo’ form, major colleges were knocking on the door of the 193cm, 100kg artwork. Hedley was recruited to the University of Miami in 2019, where he made an instant impact – tattoos aside – by choosing the number of former player, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson. “I learned about the history of it and when I found out the Rock went there and wore 94. I was a huge fan of his growing up, me and my brother used to watch all the wrestling matches. I thought it would be cool to follow in his footsteps,” Hedley said recently. Johnson tweeted his support to Hedley and the pair have continued to trade messages. Lou Hedley punting for University of Miami in the no.94. Credit: Getty Hedley’s career in Miami was a huge success, averaging 45.2 yards (41.3m) in three seasons, and in an accomplishment he rates as equal to his athletic achievement, Hedley also earned a bachelor’s degree in sport administration in 2021 at Miami, before a master’s degree in liberal studies. Hedley was initially overlooked in the NFL draft, but New Orleans signed the Australian as a free agent. After continuing to impress with his “versatility” and work ethic in the pre-season, Hedley then beat the Saints’ incumbent punter to a full-time spot on the 53-man roster, and a guaranteed salary of $A1.1 million. “I always had NFL on the horizon ... so coming over here and working my butt off, it definitely feels surreal but it’s definitely earned. I have worked really hard to get to this point,” Hedley said last week. Loading Hedley joins Dickson (Seahawks), fellow WA product Mitch Wishnowsky (49ers) and Cameron Johnston (Texans) as Australians punting in the NFL in 2023, with Arryn Siposs (Eagles) having been put back to the practice squad after playing in the Super Bowl last year. Chapman said while the colourful aspects of Hedley’s journey are many, the most important was a willingness to put in plain old hard work. “It is not easy, it doesn’t just happen,” Chapman said. “There is a lot of work that goes into it, and it’s why we get really proud because you can’t hurry this. It is an amazing opportunity and a job not many people get to do but it took him six years to do it.” Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

Welcome to Nicho Hynes’ world.","content":"Nicho Hynes wheels around his backyard, Steeden in hand. Long locks flowing. Ray Warren in his ears. A chip and chase here. 100-metre intercept there. If he’s had a big breakfast, maybe even a shoulder charge for older, simpler times’ sake. It’s a lovely scene, with not as much salt and pepper as you might think. Because several hours before the Roosters descend on Shark Park with seasons and semi-finals on the line, Hynes will be right there in his backyard. Paul Gallen had a key to the Shark Park gates for much of his career, club trainers sick of getting called in to open up the gym or ice baths at all hours for the workaholic Cronulla captain. Hynes needs a set too. As has been his game-day custom for the past year, takes to the turf long before fans, teammates, security and hospitality staff turn up for work. Long before he’s needed, too. Usually with headphones on, ball in hand, Hynes will have the stadium pretty much to himself as he treads the footballing boards in a game-day dress rehearsal. The childhood fantasies of match-winners and miracle moments though? They stay in another time. “I didn’t think anyone was going to notice that,” Hynes laughs. “It’s a bit of visualisation and it’s something that just prepares me before a game. I put myself in the moment early in the day so that when it gets to kick-off, I feel like I’ve been there before. “I feel like I can nail everything I need to do. I’m looking for my first action when I do it. My first kick in the game. “My first defensive movements. My first kick at goal, hopefully I’ll take that back this week (Hynes gave up the kicking tee ). “I’m just looking at different parts of the field where I’ll find myself with different kicks, different defensive situations. I’ll try to picture different attacking sets and positions. “I’m walking around visualising it all. It’s not like I’m chasing an extra thing I need to do. I’ve put the work in during the week. It’s just my thing and my way of getting into the game.” Hynes’ resilience and refreshing candour around mental health has rightly been celebrated since his NRL arrival with Melbourne. This year he has weathered off-field drama when his mother, Julie, spent time in custody and was found guilty of drug charges. In a purely footballing sense, 2023 has also delivered the first hurdles – and stumbles – of Hynes’ career. With last year’s Dally M medal (secured with the highest points tally in history), came expectation by the bucketload. A $6 million, six-year Sharks extension added plenty. The fervour and fever of Origin selection fizzled into Hynes before he was axed. A glaring spotlight, niggling injuries and uncharacteristic on-field frustrations played out in a tripping charge and back-chatting to the referee against Manly. “It hasn’t been easy for him,” coach Craig Fitzgibbon tells this masthead. “It’s been uncomfortable at times for him. I think he felt the spotlight and the pressure. But his response was ‘I’m going to dominate’. That’s awesome. “One thing he’s never, ever shied away from, which you’ve got to respect, he never sat back or withdrew. “He went the other way. He doubled down and did more work. Sometimes, the harder you try, you take yourself further away from what you’re aiming for. “I respect his workrate and ethic. Nicho went after the solution. He said, ‘I’m doing something about this, I’m working harder’.” When Fitzgibbon – one-time owner of the record for most tackles in an Origin game – admires your work ethic, you’re going to be alright. Cronulla’s late-season resurgence, with Hynes playing what Fitzgibbon sees as “more controlled, measured performances” has bookmakers unable to split the home side on Saturday night. “He’s still in his second year as an NRL halfback so he’s picking all of it up pretty quickly,” Fitzgibbon says. “It’s easy to say, ‘get out there and control a game’. “Actually getting it done... you don’t want to let moments go past. But that judgment of which moments to take, which moments do you leave alone and not take a risk, it’s not as easy as it sounds. “There’s a reason most of the experienced halves are the ones playing the best footy at this time of year.” For his part, Hynes is cramming as though halfbacks sit the HSC. He spoke during the week of learning from each lesson presented this year – Origin axings, form drop-offs and Cronulla losses among them. The 27-year-old has long figured that his brain is a muscle to be trained and looked after like any other as an athlete. His Dally M acceptance speech last year included a poignant nod to his friend and mindset coach Jarred Brown, who Hynes employed when he moved from Melbourne to Sydney in anticipation of the added exposure and pressure. His latest pre-game visualisation techniques are another trick of the trade, taught by another professional Hynes prefers to keep under wraps. “I don’t really want to expose him right now,” Hynes says. “He’s a big hitter in that space and a lot of people want to be mentored by him. I won’t give that one away because he’s a guy that I really like working with and I want to keep him to myself. “But even that three-game stretch of losses (which threatened to drop the Sharks out of the finals race in July) I’ve never really been in that position before, that was the first time in my career that I’ve lost three in row. “There’s plenty of lessons learned from that, I’ve simplified my game plan and the way I play a little bit. I’m just trying to stick to the little things. When they work well for our team, we play well.”","pubDate":"2023-09-08 01:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"brisbanetimes","source_priority":189315,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cf317bb10927b7e09c14f553ce7783b9","title":"Tyson Fury considering octagon clash after facing Francis Ngannou in Riyadh bout","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23775792.tyson-fury-considering-octagon-clash-facing-francis-ngannou-riyadh-bout/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Fury has faced plenty of scrutiny since his fight with the former UFC world heavyweight champion was announced.","content":"Fury has faced plenty of scrutiny since it was announced in July that he would next step in the ring with former UFC world heavyweight champion Ngannou on October 28 in Saudi Arabia.

I will give Francis the respect he 100 per cent deserves. “I need to bring my A-game because there is more on the line than a boxing fight. If I lose to an MMA guy, I will never be able to show my face in public again and I will be ridiculed.

He added: “It is a very special event for me and a special time in sports where a powerhouse like Saudi Arabia are coming in taking over the game.

Moore and all those picks to the Bears so they could move up to draft Bryce Young first overall, but that day won’t be Sunday. In his NFL debut the former Alabama QB will be facing an Atlanta defence that has little in the way of a pass rush, but Young will also be on the road and probably without his banged up top two receivers, Adam Thielen and D.J. Chark Jr. Falcons have the makings of an exciting offence, with the eighth overall pick, RB Bijan Robinson, a threat out of the backfield that will create room for WR Drake London and third-year TE Kyle Pitts. This one opened at a more comfortable three points, but the unproven Desmond Ridder will move the ball enough that the Dirty Birds cover the slightly boosted number. TAKING: ATLANTA -3.5 SCORE (O/U: 39.5): Falcons 27, Panthers 20 LINE: Baltimore by 10 Also making his NFL debut will be No. 2 pick C.J. Stroud, but the task facing him is much more formidable, as the 21-year-old former Buckeyes QB is facing a top tier defence on extremely hostile soil. Lamar Jackson hasn’t played since throwing just four passes against the Broncos on Dec. 4, and now he’s back, healthy, armed with a brand new big money contact and set of receivers that includes Odell Beckham Jr. and Zay Flowers to go along with the exceptional Rashod Bateman and, of course, Mark Andrews. Also back from injury is J.K. Dobbins, and he’ll feast on a Texans runs defence that was dead last in the league last season. Ravens have everything it takes to be a Super Bowl contender and their march towards that goal starts with a gimme. Baltimore is, by far, the safest Survivor Pool pick for Week 1. TAKING: BALTIMORE -10 SCORE (O/U: 43.5): Ravens 30, Texans 7 LINE: Buffalo by 2.5 One of the most replayed rants in NFL history came from Cardinals coach Dennis Green after an early season, 20-point loss to Chicago in 2009. I’m not thinking of “the Bears are what we thought they were” part, but the “if you want to crown them, then crown their ass” near the end. After all their additions and growth, it seems a large number of people want to crown the Jets, but the Bills are not even near ready to relinquish their AFC East throne. Devoid of all the hype they remain among the top three betting odds favourites for the Super Bowl. While they’re still learning how to win, Jets remain at an elementary school level in that course. They may be a “sexy pick” to win the division, but they’ve got to go through Buffalo to get there. Josh Allen and company will remind them of that on Monday. I’d like the Bills even more if Von Miller wasn’t on the PUP list for the first four games, but they still have more overall talent than the Jets. They still have better receivers, a better running attack (especially with Breece Hall not yet 100 percent) and a slightly better defence. I’ll also take a hungry 27-year-old Allen over an almost-40 year old former champion like Aaron Rodgers, even if the latter is driven to prove himself in a different shade of green. TAKING: BUFFALO -2.5 SCORE: (O/U: 46.5): Bills 23, Jets 17 And the rest … LINE: Cincinnati by 2.5 In case you didn’t know, Joe’s a go. After missing a month and a half of training camp with a calf injury, Bengals QB Joe Burrow was a full participant at practice this week and is expected to lead his vaunted gang into a Battle of Ohio that could be the best game of Week 1. DeShaun Watson was pretty bad in his six starts with the Browns last season — and he was nothing to write home about in the preseason just past — but he is surely now familiar with the Cleveland offence and anxious to get back on the path to stardom he was strolled before throwing himself into all sorts of hot water away from the field. With the likes of Nick Chubb, Amari Cooper and Myles Garrett in starring roles — and noting that the Browns have won eight of the past 10 meetings, including the last five in Cleveland — I’m siding with the upset and this dog at home in the Pound. TAKING: CLEVELAND +2.5 SCORE (O/U: 47.5): Browns 27, Bengals 21 LINE: Jacksonville by 5 CHEWABLE: The home team has won the last 11 games between these two AFC South opponents. That streak is about to end. Fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson didn’t look ready for this level as he struggled to complete passes in the preseason. Without Jonathan Taylor the Colts will take a RB-by-committee approach against a Jags solid run defence. Indy will again be without perennially concussed LB Shaq Leonard, while Trevor Lawrence builds on an outstanding finish to 2023 with a very dangerous weapon added to his arsenal: WR Calvin Ridley. Jags successful defence of their division crown will begin on the right note, but that number is too big for my liking. TAKING: INDIANAPOLIS +5 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Jags 24, Colts 20 LINE: Minnesota by 6 For a former first overall pick who, five years later has still done his best work as a professional in insurance commercials, Baker Mayfield couldn’t have asked for a better opponent to face at the start of the next chapter in his QB career. Okay, maybe one, as only the Titans had a more porous pass defence than the Vikings in 2022. Vikings offence might even be better with 23rd overall pick Jordan Addison giving Kirk Cousins somebody other than Justin Jefferson that can sting opponents deeply, but their secondary is still an open wound. Poised before it with salt shakers in hand are Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. TAKING: TAMPA BAY +6 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Buccaneers 28, Vikings 27. LINE: New Orleans by 3 Signs are pointing to an upset here. Derek Carr makes his debut for the Saints, but his O-line projects to be subpar while the Titans have a strong pass rush, and he won’t have Alvin Kamara as an outlet. The addition of DeAndre Hopkins gives the Titans the quality replacement for A.J. Brown they lacked last year. Whether Derrick Henry starts to slow down as a 29-year-old, it shouldn’t be against a Saints defence that was 24th against the rush defence. Tennessee has never lost in New Orleans, winning all three visits since the relocation from Houston plus the last one made as the Oilers. Saints are 3-17 ATS in the first two weeks of the season since 2013, and Mike Vrabel, one of the best coaches in the NFL, is 22-9 ATS as a dog getting 3+ points. TAKING: TENNESSEE +3 SCORE (O/U: 45.50): Titans 23, Saints 17 LINE: San Francisco by 2.5 What a matchup! Two great coaches, two elite defences, two outstanding pass rushers, two young quarterbacks and two teams with big playmakers with the ball. If Nick Bosa does have a “beer belly” he’ll fit right in at Acrisure (formerly Heinz Field) Stadium and, after a long holdout, his presence will give the Niners a big boost. Brock Purdy has only started on the road against a ‘D’ this good once before – in last season’s conference championship game 31-7 loss to the Eagles – but he suffered an elbow injury on the first series and only returned later because his backup suffered a concussion. Kyle Shanahan will help him through this one. Ultimately, a healthy Christian McCaffrey, in his first season opener wearing scarlet, white and gold, will make the difference. TAKING: SAN FRANCISCO -2.5 SCORE (O/U: 41.5): Niners 20, Steelers 17 LINE: Washington by 7 CHEWABLE: Minus Kyler Murray, the Cardinals have an awful offence and so far have kept the identity of their starting QB — either Joshua Dobbs or Clayton Tune — a state secret. Next year it should be the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, USC’s Caleb Williams, who they’ll be able to draft first overall while trading Murray. Meanwhile, the Arizona defence is equally bad and should be overmatched by a Washington offence led by QB Sammy Howell (in his second NFL start) and could be missing WR Terry McLaurin (turf toe). TAKING: WASHINGTON -7 SCORE (O/U: 38): Commanders 24, Cardinals 9 LINE: Chicago by 1 In case you’ve lost count, Packers have won the last eight, 13 of the last 14 and 23 of the last 26 meeting in this, football’s oldest rivalry. Now begins the Jordan Love era in Green Bay, and armed with a group of young receivers, expect him to turn to veteran RBs Aaron Jones and A.J. Dillon against a Bears run defence that ranked 31st last season. But Chicago will also be able to run the ball with Khalil Hebert against the Packers 26th ranked run D, and rookie RT Darnell Wright, the 10th overall pick, will anchor an improved Chicago offensive line. Justin Fields will benefit greatly from this, as well as the addition of Moore, but don’t disregard how much the latter’s addition will open up space for Darnell Mooney and Cole Kmet. TAKING: CHICAGO -1 SCORE (O/U: 42.5): Bears 27, Packers 24 LINE: Broncos by 3.5 Veteran QBs Russell Wilson and Jimmy Garoppolo are coming off nightmarish seasons and will have to survive behind shaky offensive lines, and in Wilson’s case it could take some fancy footwork with Maxx Crosby in his face. The impact of Sean Payton as Denver coach should be immediate, and latest reports have Jerry Jeudy (hamstring) possibly back for this one. Raiders have won the last six meetings and eight of the last nine in this series, and that trend will end here. But that extra half point has us leaning with the visitors. TAKING: RAIDERS +3.5 SCORE (O/U: 44): Broncos 23, Raiders 20 LINE: Los Angeles by 3 With all the offensive talent on the field, particularly at the receiver positions, new Chargers OC Kellen Moore and Dolphins play calling head coach Mike McDaniel could resemble a couple of kids with a Madden video game. We’d like the Fish a lot more had they not lost Jalen Ramsey, who they acquired in the off-season for a third round pick, to a torn meniscus at camp. As is, it’s difficult not to bet on Justin Herbert with Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and the explosive Austin Ekeler coming out of the backfield. Tua Tagovailoa has Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle — and don’t underestimate Raheem Mostert — but last season he completed just 10-of-28 passes in a 23-17 road loss to the Chargers, who didn’t have Joey Bosa in the lineup. Bosa and Khalil Mack will make it even more difficult for Tua to operate this time. TAKING: LOS ANGELES -3 SCORE (O/U: 51.5): Chargers 36, Dolphins 27 LINE: Philadelphia by 4 Of course the Eagles are the superior team. It’s not close. But Tom Brady will be in honored at Gillette Stadium, Mac Jones has looked good at camp and Bill Belichick has had a very long time to prepare for this one. Patriots also have an ace in the hole in Ezekiel Elliott. In 12 games against the Eagles as a Cowboy, Zeke was on the winning side nine times while racking up more rushing yards (1,107, average 4.75 per carry) and receiving yards (357, 7.29 per catch) than any other opponent. Jalen Hurts will be facing Belichick for the first time, and The Hoodie has had trouble defending mobile QBs, but the Patriots need to get off to a better start more than the Eagles, who are likely headed back to at least the NFC championship game no matter what happens Sunday. TAKING: NEW ENGLAND +4 SCORE (O/U: 45): Patriots 20, Eagles 17 LINE: Seattle by 5.5 Before the news that Cooper Krupp (hamstring) will miss this game makes you jump to the Seahawks know that the superstar WR didn’t play in either meeting between the teams last year, and while Seattle won both, the margins of victory were three (at home) and four points (in L.A.). The Rams also didn’t have Matthew Stafford for either game, with Baker Mayfield (13-of-26, 0 TDs, 1 pick) going the distance in Seattle and John Wolford (14-of-26, 0 TDs, 2 picks) in L.A., and Stafford is now healthy. The surprising resurrection of Geno Smith will continue this season — he certainly has the weapons — but Rams will keep Game 1 close largely because Cam Akers will again run through a Seattle run defence that ranked 30th in 2022. TAKING: LOS ANGELES +5.5 SCORE (O/U: 45.5): Seahawks 28, Los Angeles 24 LINE: Dallas by 3.5 A team has to be significantly overmatched if I’m going to turn down more than three points when it’s at home against a division rival. The Giants aren’t significantly overmatched here. Sure Dallas is better, improved from even last year, but Big Blue has added to Daniel Jones’ arsenal by trading for Darren Waller and drafting Jalin Hyatt out of Tennessee, and Saquon Barkley is always a factor, either by ground or air. Cowboys have won the last four meetings and 11 of the last 12, but Belichick disciple Brian Daboll wins the coaching matchup with Mike McCarthy, and if you’re going to beat Daboll three times in a row the third one is going to be very close. Liking the upset.

Gamble arrived at the Knights this season as a fringe first-grader but became Adam O'Brien's first-choice five-eighth after Kalyn Ponga reverted to fullback mid-campaign. He has played almost as many games this year (22) as in his entire career prior to 2023 (25), proving a dangerous option with the ball during the Knights' ongoing nine-game winning streak. Sunday's home elimination final against Canberra continues the 27-year-old Gamble's quest to once-and-for-all cement his status as a long-term, first-choice half in the NRL. \"That's where I'm at now,\" Gamble told AAP. \"I'd like to think I've done enough to keep my jersey. \"But if you take that mindset into a pre-season, you don't put your best foot forward and things can go downhill really quickly.\" Standing in Gamble's way is Penrith's back-up playmaker Cogger, who comes into the finals series with a similar chance to shine ahead of his return to Newcastle next year. Where Gamble's strength lies in playing eyes-up football, Cogger is a more natural game manager. But like Gamble, he has only been a first-choice half in fits and starts. Having returned from a two-year stint in England, Cogger was a capable understudy for Nathan Cleary when Penrith's first-choice No.7 went down with a hamstring injury during the State of Origin period. Saturday's qualifying final against the Warriors is his second full game in a stint replacing five-eighth Jarome Luai, whose dislocated shoulder will keep him out until at least the third week of finals. Cogger was electric in the minor premiers' last-start defeat of North Queensland and after debuting at Newcastle in 2016, he returns to the club in 2024 intent on clinching his own spot in the halves. \"All things lead to that,\" he told AAP. \"But at the moment my job's here at Penrith. \"My best years are ahead of me (after) being part of a really successful system (at Penrith) and being able to work side-by-side with Nathan or Jarome and the coaching staff here.\" Gamble conceded he faced a battle at the selection table, with neither he nor Cogger likely to oust Jackson Hastings after the halfback's stellar year as the Knights' game manager. \"It's going to be a contest for positions next year and that's when a club's thriving,\" Gamble said. If the Knights were to beat Canberra and the Panthers lose to the Warriors, Cogger and Gamble's similar careers would converge in a knock-out semi-final. \"He's come back from the Super League and he's taken his opportunity with two hands, sort of like I have,\" Gamble said of his soon-to-be-teammate. \"I wish him the best for the finals series - I think he'd say the same to me.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-08 02:27:10","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11840189/093567f82625cd3dbc3cc155b662397fa6536484-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"577d41ab9090406b9d4e53aee639b537","title":"France beat Ireland 2-0 to stay perfect in European Championship qualifiers","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/football/france-beat-ireland-2-0-to-stay-perfect-in-european-championship-qualifiers-101694139168620.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion.","content":"France extended its perfect start to its European Championship qualifying campaign to five matches with a 2-0 win over Ireland on Thursday. (From L to R) Dayot Upamecano, Theo Hernandez, Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappe, Lucas Hernandez and Antoine Griezmann celebrate the second goal during the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament Group B qualifying match between France and Republic of Ireland(AFP) A spot at the continental tournament in Germany next summer now looks all but secured for the two-time champion. Didier Deschamps' team has been rock solid so far and has not conceded a goal, topping Group B with 15 points and a nine-point lead over the Netherlands and Greece. The Dutch, who defeated their Greek rivals 3-0, have two matches in hand. Aurelien Tchouameni and Marcus Thuram scored France’s goals at the Parc des Princes. The game was played at Paris Saint-Germain's stadium because of the Rugby World Cup’s opening game scheduled Friday at the Stade de France. Deschamps made four changes to the team that defeated Greece 1-0 in the previous game, with striker Olivier Giroud starting up front in place of Randal Kolo Muani. Giroud’s 125th appearance did not last long, though, as he was replaced by Thuram after just 25 minutes with an apparent ankle injury following contact with an Irish player. Playing in front of his home crowd, PSG forward Kylian Mbappe delivered the assist for Tchouameni’s opener. Another PSG player, Ousmane Dembele, was a threat throughout down the right. Irish forward Chiedozie Ogbene's pace down the right flank faded quite quickly, and France took control after Tchouameni broke the deadlock in the 19th minute. Before that, a direct free kick from Antoine Griezmann had almost caught Gavin Bazunu off guard, but the Ireland goalkeeper managed to clear the ball with his chest. There was not much Bazunu could do three minutes later when Tchouameni made the most of Mbappe’s back pass just outside the box to curl a superb 25-meter shot inside the far post. Mbappe thought he had doubled France’s lead before the interval following a quick combination with Thuram, but a VAR check confirmed his teammate was in an offside position in the buildup. Thuram made it 2-0 in the 48th from the rebound after Mbappe’s shot from inside the box was blocked. France goalkeeper Mike Maignan then ensured yet another clean sheet with a reflex save to deny Ogbene’s header.

The Lions will host Port Adelaide at the Gabba on Saturday, split by only percentage after a 17-win season that began with a heavy Power win in Adelaide in round one. Brisbane did not lose a game at home during the regular season, but Fagan knows that is now irrelevant with the jury still out on their finals credentials thanks to a 3-6 post-season record after four consecutive campaigns without a grand-final appearance. The coach has sometimes come across as terse and defensive in September, but on Friday spoke with patience and confidence about what he views as the side's best chance to win a flag since his arrival in 2017. \"I'm as relaxed as you can be ... I was tossing and turning a bit last night imagining the game and how it might pan out but that's just normal stuff,\" he said. \"It feels like we've been getting ready for this for seven years. \"You just want to make the most of your opportunity, not let it slip by. \"I don't think we have done that (in previous seasons), I just don't think we've been quite ready. \"But we've been getting closer all the time and this year is as close as we've been so you've got to try and make the most of that. \"You learn along the way and particularly from your failures and mistakes.\" The rise of Darcy Wilmot, Deven Robertson and Jaspa Fletcher in particular has meant any holes have been filled, Fagan saying the confidence comes from a settled line-up that's proved extremely hard to beat. \"Games we might have lost in the past, we've found a way to win,\" he said. \"We're a tougher side mentally, which is something we deliberately worked on.\" Lincoln McCarthy returns from a calf niggle for Brisbane while Port have had an already tricky week at the selection table compounded by a training injury that ruled out retiring skipper Tom Jonas. Trent McKenzie will return to replace him while ruckman Scott Lycett (knee) and key forward Todd Marshall (hip) are also back. Offensive weapon Charlie Dixon (knee) won't play while coach Ken Hinkley confirmed former skipper Travis Boak will be the substitute after he was dropped from the starting 22. \"We have both got quite experienced teams when it comes to playing finals football but we have both also had our challenges through the back end of finals football,\" Hinkley said. \"That's the one thing that I do know, the best teams qualify. \"Every team that is in there has earned their right to play, but every team also knows that the stakes go up because this is what we play football for.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-08 02:18:06","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11840126/55cb216df48a78b1dc9094724d7c5f4e0fa2531d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d51dc32fc78313d05cbfb0722ff15e74","title":"Can young Saints handle the heat?

So how will the two games play out? We’ve asked and answered the burning questions ahead of Saturday’s two big finals. St Kilda v GWS Last time they met Round 10: St Kilda 13.14 (92) d GWS 12.8 (80) at Giants Stadium Will the Saints be green(e) with envy? The Giants hope that’s the case. What more can be said about Toby Greene? From AFL bad boy to All-Australian captain, Greene is must-watch viewing and can turn a contest in the blink of an eye. That he has 60 goals this season highlights why pound for pound, he may be the best forward in the competition. All-Australian full-back Callum Wilkie is one option to tackle Greene, but the Saints know Jake Riccardi and Jesse Hogan are also major threats. Greene has also been spending more time at centre bounces. Meanwhile, teammate Tom Green is the No.1-ranked player in the competition for disposals and contested possessions per game, and ninth for score involvements. Saints skipper Jack Steele is likely to have the job of curbing Greene. Steele has been a warrior this season, battling a broken collarbone, but the stakes now could not be higher. It’s not easy beating Greene: GWS skipper Toby is one of the best forwards in the competition. Credit: AFL Photos Should the Giants fear playing at the MCG? No. This is a team that has won at an equal-record 10 different venues this year, although the MCG is not one. Their only game at the home of football this season was in round nine, when the Magpies surged to a 65-point win. But these Giants are a far different proposition, having won nine of their past 11 games. However, of concern when assessing their credentials against the past 10 premiers, who were all top six for least points against, and least points against from turnovers, is that the Giants are 10th for the latter (82 points per game) and ninth for the latter (45.4). Will Max be king for a day, and how will the young Saints handle the finals heat? The Saints need Max King to be dominant if they are to win. He booted four when the teams last met, on a day the Saints had only five goalkickers. If goalkickers are at a premium again, he will need to contribute a bag. However, if there is an even spread, three from him could be enough, provided he remains a major marking presence, and brings his small forwards into the contest. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera, Marcus Windhager and Mitch Owens are preparing for their first final. In only their second season, they have become important pieces. The Saints need the three to have a steady afternoon. Max King looms as a potential finals match-winner for the Saints. Credit: AFL Photos How important is the ruck battle? Very. Rowan Marshall may not have the poster-boy image of Max King, but he may well be the Saints’ most important player. Marshall was named in the All-Australian squad, and can influence games with his tap work and marking around the ground. However, unheralded Giant Kieren Briggs has had a strong back-end to the season. Who wins the contested ball? As the graphic below shows, that’s more than likely to be the Saints. Lyon’s imprint is all over this side, and it starts at the coalface. The Saints are ranked fifth for contested possessions, while the more free-flowing Giants are 10th, content to just break even with their opponents. On the flipside, the Saints are equal ninth for uncontested possession, but the Giants are third. So, this shapes as a battle of philosophies. If the Giants can have the ball on their terms, they win. If the Saints turn this into a slug fest, there’s a greater chance they win. Tip: St Kilda by one point. Brisbane Lions v Port Adelaide Last time they met Round one: Port Adelaide 18.18 (126) d Brisbane 11.6 (72) at Adelaide Oval Can Port Adelaide disarm Brisbane’s weaponry up forward? The mix of Joe Daniher and Eric Hipwood as key talls, with Charlie Cameron, Zac Bailey and Cam Rayner among the smalls zipping around at their feet, is enough to scare any side. But with Port Adelaide’s defensive profile leaving a bit to be desired, there’s a genuine question mark around whether the Power are capable of defending such an attacking outfit. The Lions are the No.1 side when it comes to inside-50 differential, while the Power finished the home-and-away season ranked 13th for opposition scores per inside-50. If the Lions own territory, it will be hard to see Port Adelaide restricting the Lions to a low score. The Power must defend by limiting supply. Aliir Aliir’s ability to intercept can’t be understated, but by beating the Lions in the midfield, the Power will be able to play the ball in their front half of the ground and deny the Lions forward entries. Joe Daniher has had a brilliant year for the Lions. Credit: AFL Photos Is shutting down Lachie Neale the key to beating Brisbane? The last time the Brisbane Lions lost, in round 20 to the Gold Coast, Touk Miller sacrificed his game to run with Lachie Neale. Miller kept Neale to just 17 touches, Miller had 29 disposals, and the Suns went on to win by 41 points. Two weeks earlier, Neale had just 19 disposals as the Demons chased down a 26-point deficit to run over Brisbane in the last quarter. They’re the only two games Neale didn’t have 20 or more touches, while in round one, when Port Adelaide thrashed the Lions, Neale had just 20 touches. So, is that the key to beating the Lions? It certainly looks like it goes a long way, but Neale had some niggling issues in rounds 18-22 and appears to have overcome them since. He’s been tagged plenty of times before and plenty of teams have failed. But expect Willem Drew to get the job on Saturday night. Drew played a big role on Nick Daicos when the Power nearly beat the Pies. What bearing will the contested possession count have? When Port Adelaide flogged the Lions in round one, it was on the back of a 150-116 contested possession count. Remarkably, by season’s end, the Lions ranked fourth in the competition for contested possession differential and the Power ranked 16th. The Lions have not lost in 10 matches this season when they’ve won the contested possession differential. Jason Horne-Francis starred in the season opener with 10 contested possessions, supported by Ollie Wines (11), Drew and Xavier Duursma (nine each) and Sam Powell-Pepper (eight). Zak Butters has grown into a contested beast since then too. Guys such as Neale and Josh Dunkley will need to be supported in that area of the ground. Can the Power win without Charlie Dixon? Dixon was another key reason why the Power won in round one. He had six contested marks on that occasion and kicked 3.3, with Todd Marshall kicking four and Willie Rioli and Lachie Jones kicking three each as well. But Dixon has been ruled out of Saturday night’s game after failing to overcome a foot injury that has sidelined him since round 21. Marshall didn’t play in round 24 but looks certain to return to give Port Adelaide’s forward line a focal point. He kicked three goals in round 22 against GWS, and with Scott Lycett to return in the ruck, that should allow Jeremy Finlayson to spend more time forward as well. Finlayson and Marshall will need to shoulder that load without Dixon. Will the Lions handle the pressure? All signs point to the Brisbane Lions winning at home and progressing to a preliminary final at home again in a fortnight’s time. But this won’t be the first time the Lions have played in finals at the Gabba, and under Chris Fagan, they’ve failed to reach a grand final. Loading Two years ago, they lost a qualifying final to Melbourne in Adelaide, but then lost to the Bulldogs at the Gabba in a semi-final. They beat Richmond in 2020 in a qualifying final at the Gabba, but were bundled out in a preliminary final by the Cats. And in 2019, they lost in straight sets, losing to Richmond and GWS in successive weeks in Brisbane. This year has a different feel. Daniher is having his career best season, which has helped Hipwood flourish, the addition of Dunkley has strengthened the Lions’ midfield, and players such as Rayner, Keidean Coleman and Hugh McCluggage have matured into consistent performers.

Michael Edwards is set to make his return to sport after departing his role as Liverpool sporting director. According to the 44-year-old will reunite with the Reds former director of research Dr Ian Graham - joining as a non-executive director of Graham's new venture, Ludonautics. The revelation sees a temporary end to speculation linking with a return to football , moving aside for Julian Ward to take the mantle.. He arrived at in 2011, following stints with Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth, and after deciding not to extend his role on Merseyside, Edwards' was speculated to have been in line to take hierarchical roles at Newcastle United and Manchester United, which never came to fruition. Liverpool have held firm in their unwillingness to sell Mohamed Salah to Saudi Arabia in this summer's transfer window.

The export market of kickers who have switched Sherrins for Wilsons is now so big that in recent years as many as one in three punters in the 120 FSB (NCAA division 1) college football teams have been Australians. And following on from early trailblazers like Darren Bennett, Ben Graham and Sav Rocca, Australians continue to have an outsized presence in the NFL, led by the game’s highest-paid punter Michael Dickson, who plays with the Seattle Seahawks. So for American audiences to be wowed by the story of former Perth scaffolder Lou Hedley says everything about the originality of a rookie punter labelled “the most interesting man in the NFL”. Lou Hedley is becoming a cult hero before he’s even kicked a ball. Credit: Getty At the ripe old age of 30, Hedley will make his debut for the New Orleans Saints on Monday (3am AEST), punting against the Tennessee Titans at the Louisiana Superdome. But before he has even kicked a ball, Hedley’s profile is already skyrocketing, courtesy of his heavily-tattooed physique, a social media bromance with Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and the unlikeliest journey taken to an NFL roster in many years. Hedley grew up Leeman in Western Australia, a fishing town with a population of about 700 where his father was a cray fisherman. After moving to Perth when he was 10, Hedley set his sights on becoming a footballer and though promising enough at fullback to play reserves for Peel Thunder in the WAFL, he didn’t push on further. Having dropped out of school, Hedley became a scaffolder at 17 and, as he worked on skyscrapers and mine sites for the next five years, developed a passion for tattoos. With good mate and now Fremantle defender Nathan Wilson, Hedley even became a co-owner of a tattoo shop in Bali. He is covered neck to toe in ink, and now delights US media by running through some of his more interesting tattoos, which includes one of aliens kidnapping a cow. The flame of Hedley’s sporting ambition hadn’t died, though, and after impressing with his big right kicking boot at a trial with ProKick Australia coaches in WA, he was invited to Melbourne to join the respected academy. Run by Nathan Chapman and John Smith, ProKick Australia began in 2007 to help turn AFL athletes into punters and is now a pumping production line for US colleges, who love the Aussie kickers. Since 2007 seven graduates have received the best college kicker award, hundreds have won scholarships and four are currently active on NFL rosters – including Hedley. “We knew he had some tattoos but he just, straight away, showed himself to be humble, quiet and determined and that was a really good start,” Chapman said. “Visually, he was different to the general profile. But he just got to work. He was like ‘hey I am here, I have moved interstate and sacrificed a lot to have a crack at something where I don’t know the outcome’ and he wanted to do it. So his energy towards that shone through.” “He could kick the ball, he was strong, he loved the gym and we knew we had a real special talent there.” Because Hedley had not finished school, he had to go to Junior College in San Francisco to get the grades to qualify for a major university. Hedley sold his share in the tattoo shop, moved into a share house with 12 other athletes and, after 18 months of impressive ‘JuCo’ form, major colleges were knocking on the door of the 193cm, 100kg artwork. Hedley was recruited to the University of Miami in 2019, where he made an instant impact – tattoos aside – by choosing the number of former player, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson. “I learned about the history of it and when I found out the Rock went there and wore 94. I was a huge fan of his growing up, me and my brother used to watch all the wrestling matches. I thought it would be cool to follow in his footsteps,” Hedley said recently. Johnson tweeted his support to Hedley and the pair have continued to trade messages. Lou Hedley punting for University of Miami in the no.94. Credit: Getty Hedley’s career in Miami was a huge success, averaging 45.2 yards (41.3m) in three seasons, and in an accomplishment he rates as equal to his athletic achievement, Hedley also earned a bachelor’s degree in sport administration in 2021 at Miami, before a master’s degree in liberal studies. Hedley was initially overlooked in the NFL draft, but New Orleans signed the Australian as a free agent. After continuing to impress with his “versatility” and work ethic in the pre-season, Hedley then beat the Saints’ incumbent punter to a full-time spot on the 53-man roster, and a guaranteed salary of $A1.1 million. “I always had NFL on the horizon ... so coming over here and working my butt off, it definitely feels surreal but it’s definitely earned. I have worked really hard to get to this point,” Hedley said last week. Loading Hedley joins Dickson (Seahawks), fellow WA product Mitch Wishnowsky (49ers) and Cameron Johnston (Texans) as Australians punting in the NFL in 2023, with Arryn Siposs (Eagles) having been put back to the practice squad after playing in the Super Bowl last year. Chapman said while the colourful aspects of Hedley’s journey are many, the most important was a willingness to put in plain old hard work. “It is not easy, it doesn’t just happen,” Chapman said. “There is a lot of work that goes into it, and it’s why we get really proud because you can’t hurry this. It is an amazing opportunity and a job not many people get to do but it took him six years to do it.” Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

Welcome to Nicho Hynes’ world.","content":"Nicho Hynes wheels around his backyard, Steeden in hand. Long locks flowing. Ray Warren in his ears. A chip and chase here. 100-metre intercept there. If he’s had a big breakfast, maybe even a shoulder charge for older, simpler times’ sake. It’s a lovely scene, with not as much salt and pepper as you might think. Because several hours before the Roosters descend on Shark Park with seasons and semi-finals on the line, Hynes will be right there in his backyard. Paul Gallen had a key to the Shark Park gates for much of his career, club trainers sick of getting called in to open up the gym or ice baths at all hours for the workaholic Cronulla captain. Hynes needs a set too. As has been his game-day custom for the past year, takes to the turf long before fans, teammates, security and hospitality staff turn up for work. Long before he’s needed, too. Usually with headphones on, ball in hand, Hynes will have the stadium pretty much to himself as he treads the footballing boards in a game-day dress rehearsal. The childhood fantasies of match-winners and miracle moments though? They stay in another time. “I didn’t think anyone was going to notice that,” Hynes laughs. “It’s a bit of visualisation and it’s something that just prepares me before a game. I put myself in the moment early in the day so that when it gets to kick-off, I feel like I’ve been there before. “I feel like I can nail everything I need to do. I’m looking for my first action when I do it. My first kick in the game. “My first defensive movements. My first kick at goal, hopefully I’ll take that back this week (Hynes gave up the kicking tee ). “I’m just looking at different parts of the field where I’ll find myself with different kicks, different defensive situations. I’ll try to picture different attacking sets and positions. “I’m walking around visualising it all. It’s not like I’m chasing an extra thing I need to do. I’ve put the work in during the week. It’s just my thing and my way of getting into the game.” Hynes’ resilience and refreshing candour around mental health has rightly been celebrated since his NRL arrival with Melbourne. This year he has weathered off-field drama when his mother, Julie, spent time in custody and was found guilty of drug charges. In a purely footballing sense, 2023 has also delivered the first hurdles – and stumbles – of Hynes’ career. With last year’s Dally M medal (secured with the highest points tally in history), came expectation by the bucketload. A $6 million, six-year Sharks extension added plenty. The fervour and fever of Origin selection fizzled into Hynes before he was axed. A glaring spotlight, niggling injuries and uncharacteristic on-field frustrations played out in a tripping charge and back-chatting to the referee against Manly. “It hasn’t been easy for him,” coach Craig Fitzgibbon tells this masthead. “It’s been uncomfortable at times for him. I think he felt the spotlight and the pressure. But his response was ‘I’m going to dominate’. That’s awesome. “One thing he’s never, ever shied away from, which you’ve got to respect, he never sat back or withdrew. “He went the other way. He doubled down and did more work. Sometimes, the harder you try, you take yourself further away from what you’re aiming for. “I respect his workrate and ethic. Nicho went after the solution. He said, ‘I’m doing something about this, I’m working harder’.” When Fitzgibbon – one-time owner of the record for most tackles in an Origin game – admires your work ethic, you’re going to be alright. Cronulla’s late-season resurgence, with Hynes playing what Fitzgibbon sees as “more controlled, measured performances” has bookmakers unable to split the home side on Saturday night. “He’s still in his second year as an NRL halfback so he’s picking all of it up pretty quickly,” Fitzgibbon says. “It’s easy to say, ‘get out there and control a game’. “Actually getting it done... you don’t want to let moments go past. But that judgment of which moments to take, which moments do you leave alone and not take a risk, it’s not as easy as it sounds. “There’s a reason most of the experienced halves are the ones playing the best footy at this time of year.” For his part, Hynes is cramming as though halfbacks sit the HSC. He spoke during the week of learning from each lesson presented this year – Origin axings, form drop-offs and Cronulla losses among them. The 27-year-old has long figured that his brain is a muscle to be trained and looked after like any other as an athlete. His Dally M acceptance speech last year included a poignant nod to his friend and mindset coach Jarred Brown, who Hynes employed when he moved from Melbourne to Sydney in anticipation of the added exposure and pressure. His latest pre-game visualisation techniques are another trick of the trade, taught by another professional Hynes prefers to keep under wraps. “I don’t really want to expose him right now,” Hynes says. “He’s a big hitter in that space and a lot of people want to be mentored by him. I won’t give that one away because he’s a guy that I really like working with and I want to keep him to myself. “But even that three-game stretch of losses (which threatened to drop the Sharks out of the finals race in July) I’ve never really been in that position before, that was the first time in my career that I’ve lost three in row. “There’s plenty of lessons learned from that, I’ve simplified my game plan and the way I play a little bit. I’m just trying to stick to the little things. When they work well for our team, we play well.”","pubDate":"2023-09-08 01:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"brisbanetimes","source_priority":189315,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cf317bb10927b7e09c14f553ce7783b9","title":"Tyson Fury considering octagon clash after facing Francis Ngannou in Riyadh bout","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23775792.tyson-fury-considering-octagon-clash-facing-francis-ngannou-riyadh-bout/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Fury has faced plenty of scrutiny since his fight with the former UFC world heavyweight champion was announced.","content":"Fury has faced plenty of scrutiny since it was announced in July that he would next step in the ring with former UFC world heavyweight champion Ngannou on October 28 in Saudi Arabia.

I will give Francis the respect he 100 per cent deserves. “I need to bring my A-game because there is more on the line than a boxing fight. If I lose to an MMA guy, I will never be able to show my face in public again and I will be ridiculed.

Talk continues to rumble on over if Fury could fight compatriot Anthony Joshua in 2024 or if a unification clash may happen with Usyk after the Lancashire boxer beat Dillian Whyte and Derek Chisora last year in one-sided fights.
