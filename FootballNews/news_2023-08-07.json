Messi scored the opening goal in Miami's Leagues Cup clash with Dallas on Sunday - but only after the referee consulted video replays to overturn an offside decision. It was Messi's sixth goal in just four games since moving to the United States. It was also the third time in as many matches that the World Cup winner had flown out of the blocks. In Texas on Sunday, Messi stroked the ball home from the edge of the box following a pull-back from Alba, who was making his first start since joining his former Barcelona teammate in Florida. Lionel Messi needed six minutes to rekindle his partnership with former teamate Jordi Alba The goal bore striking resemblance to a iconic goal in 2017, when the pair combined for Messi to score an injury-time winner at the home of great rivals Real Madrid. The goal on Sunday was initially ruled out for offside against Josef Martinez, who was adjudged to have obstructed the view of Dallas goalkeeper Maarten Paes. But referee Cesar Ramos was advised to consult his pitchside monitor and soon the official had changed the call. It marked the first time Messi has combined with Alba, with whom he came through the academy at Barcelona. Messi stroked the ball home from the edge of the box following a pull-back from Alba Messi's opening goal against Dallas came in the sixth minute. Against Orlando City last time out, he netted after seven minutes. In his first start last month, a 4-0 win over Atlanta United, Messi needed only eight minutes to find the target. The goal, which took Messi alongside Minnesota's Bongokuhle Hlongwane in the Leagues Cup top scorers list, came just a couple of minutes after Dallas thought they had taken the lead. But the home team was on the wrong end of an offside call, with Jesus Ferreira's header ruled out by the assistant referee. Dallas did lead by the break, however, following two goals in eight minutes. That meant Inter Miami trailled for the first time in the tournament. After Dallas made it 3-1, Messi and Alba comibed once more to create a second Miami goal for Benjamin Cremaschi.

The problem lies with the kickoff time of 8.30pm AEST, which puts the broadcast of the match on Channel Seven past the bedtime of millions of young Australians who would love nothing better than to stay up and cheer on Sam Kerr and the rest of the squad. As it stands, the action is tipped to finish at around 10.30pm AEST - but that only applies if the result is decided in 90 minutes of regulation time. Since the round-of-16 match is a knockout fixture, it will go to two extra time periods of 15 minutes each if the scores are still locked up at fulltime. If the sides are still level after the extra 30 minutes of play, the result will be decided by a penalty shootout that works under a best-of-five system. Many young Matildas fans will be unable to watch the team do battle with Denmark due to the late kickoff putting the action past their bedtime (pictured, local football supporters at the Australia vs Ireland World Cup match) The game could finish long after 10.30pm if extra time and a penalty shootout are needed to get a result - which is a relatively common way for matches in big tournaments to end Should the tie remain unbroken after that, the shootout continues in a sudden-death format. Matches in the knockout stages of big tournaments like the Women's World Cup are often decided in penalty shootouts, and Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson - along with goalie Mackenzie Arnold - have confirmed they're preparing for the match to end that way. If the Denmark contest is decided in a shootout following two extra periods of play, that would set the end of the contest back to the point where many Aussie adults would be worried about staying up past their bedtime - never mind their young children. While the 8.30pm start time isn't the latest kickoff in the round-of-16 - France's game against Morocco on Tuesday begins at 9pm AEST - it is the latest for a match featuring Australia in the tournament so far. And while it must be pointed out that tournament organisers had no way of knowing the Matildas would fall into that slot ahead of time - as there was no guarantee the Aussies would even make it out of the group stage - local fans still have a legitimate gripe with the late start. Millions of Aussies are expected to tune in to see whether injured skipper Sam Kerr (pictured) can make an impact after she promised she will play against the Danes If the match stretches through the usual best-of-five penalty shootout and goes into a sudden-death contest based on kicks from the spot, the action will go past the bedtime of some Aussie adults, never mind their young kids (pictured, young Matildas fans at the Ireland game) The 8.30pm AEST kickoff translates to an 11.30am start in London, 12.30pm in the Danish capital of Copenhagen, 6.30am in New York and 3.30am in Los Angeles. Catering for the huge European and American markets is a delicate balancing act for World Cup organisers as they try to maximise ratings while also dealing with the huge time differences between those countries and hosts Australia and New Zealand. But one of the greatest benefits of hosting a World Cup is the way games are timed to fit in with the regular pattern of life instead of forcing fans to upend their sleeping patterns to see the action as it happens. Australians have already slammed the fact they can't watch the vast majority of the tournament on TV because most matches are behind Optus Sport's paywall, with only 15 of the Cup's 64 games available for free on Channel Seven. Between that and the time zone problem, keeping everyone happy is impossible - but Matildas fans know every game from here on could be the team's last in what is a once-in-a-lifetime home World Cup. That's why the crucial 30-minute delay that could prove the difference between young fans experiencing a priceless sporting memory or sleeping straight through it is sure to get Aussies offside.

The Matildas are readying themselves for their do-or-die clash with Denmark in Sydney as they hope to book a berth in the quarter finals. On Sunday, Caitlin Foord said that she was impressed with the support from Aussies but would like more noise from Sydney fans. 'I said it before, and I still think Sydney could be louder,' said Foord. 'I hope it is tomorrow. By far, at the moment, Melbourne has definitely took top notch - so I definitely want my home team to take that up.' The Matildas Active Support group (pictured before Australia's World Cup match against Nigeria) is hoping more fans will find their voice on Monday for the Denmark game The group is hoping Aussie fans will get more involved as the tournament goes on and they get used to the way hardcore football supporters pump up their team at big games Cat Gaggin, a member of the Matildas Active Support group, is hoping more supporters will find their voice. 'As Australians we love sports. No matter what it is, we're always going to turn up,' Gaggin Wide World of Sports . 'We are a group that is turning up and getting loud, and hopefully the more that we win and the more matches that we play , the louder we'll get.' Her fellow group member Liam Parslow says Aussie football fans are content to sit back and enjoy the spectacle rather than get vocal like other footballing nations around the world. 'I think Australian sporting crowds are conservative in general,' he said. 'Australian sporting fans like to be entertained but football crowds are different; we like to be involved, more hands-on, and we're very vocal and passionate.' For many Aussies, the World Cup is their first experience of big football matches, so the supporter group anticipates fans will get more involved as the tournament goes on. 'It is so many people's first football match that they're getting to see live and it is also their first chance to see the Matildas play,' Gaggin said. The Women's World Cup is the first time many Aussies have experienced huge football crowds and the culture that goes with them Matildas Active Support have many songs and chants ready for the match on Monday night 'With this World Cup on home soil, we need to build on people wanting to come to the football and then we can build the chants up from there.' 'European and South American football, they've been doing this for generations. Their chants have been around for generations. 'We can't compare as that's their life, football is everything to them.' Matildas Active Support have a well-developed songbook with team songs, Aussie anthems and individual player chants - and on Monday night they will be hard to miss at Stadium Australia. 'We're trying to get everyone on board with the same songs. They are pretty easy to learn once you know them,' Gaggin says. Fellow group member Majella Card adds: 'Even if you don't want to get up and sing, clap along with the beat of the drums because the drums are always going.'

They recruited experienced midfielder Ikay Gundogan, who captained Manchester City to the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble last season, ending a successful seven-year stint in England during which he won 12 major trophies. Gundogan will help mentor a young Barca squad as they try to retain the LaLiga crown and get back to winning ways in the Champions League after years of European disappointments. They exited at the group stage of Europe's top club competition for the second year in a row last season and were knocked out of the Europa League by Manchester United. Barcelona have won the Champions League five times, most recently in 2015, and face a tough task to get back to the top table of European football after being forced to sell club legend Lionel Messi due to financial problems. Their outstanding domestic campaign was somewhat overshadowed by turmoil off the pitch including deepening financial issues and a refereeing scandal that could drag on for years. Spanish prosecutors in March filed a complaint over alleged payments Barcelona made from 2001 to 2018 totalling €7.3 million to firms owned by former refereeing official Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. A Barcelona court has agreed to take on the case and UEFA has provisionally cleared the club to compete in this season's Champions League despite ongoing investigations. They will not be able to play at their beloved Camp Nou for the next few seasons as they have agreed a financing deal worth €1.45 billion to renovate the iconic but outdated stadium. The 100,000-seater Camp Nou was the club's biggest source of income and they will be forced to be creative to stay competitive within the restrictions of LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Gundogan's arrival, Lewandowski's consistency, reliable goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and young players like Pedri, Gavi, Ronald Araujo, Luuk De Jong and Jules Kounde give Xavi a plenty of reasons to be optimistic. But he suffered a big blow last week with news of the imminent departure of French winger Ousmane Dembele who is joining Paris St Germain. Barcelona begin their LaLiga defence on Sunday (Aug 6) in the Spanish capital against Getafe and although the fans are still celebrating last season's romp to the title, there is plenty for them to be concerned about.","pubDate":"2023-08-07 02:04:57","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--aB8lz39Q--/c_fill,h_900,w_1600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2023-08-07t020457z_1_lynxmpej76010_rtroptp_3_soccer-spain-fcb-soc-report.jpg?itok=HEfWhcr4","source_id":"channelnewsasia","category":["sports"],"country":["singapore"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lionel Messi inspires Inter Miami to incredible victory over Dallas... netting ANOTHER late free-kick in 4-4 tie before Tata Martino's side win dramatic penalty shootout in Texas","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12379635/Lionel-Messi-inspires-Inter-Miami-incredible-victory-Dallas-netting-late-free-kick-4-4-tie-Tata-Martinos-win-dramatic-penalty-shootout-Texas.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Heading into the final 10 minutes, Inter Miami trailed 4-2.

In his first road game since moving to the United States, Messi opened the scoring after only six minutes before Dallas turned the game on its head. Heading into the final 10 minutes, Inter Miami trailed 4-2. But then a Messi cross was headed into his own goal by Marco Farfan. Then, with five minutes to play, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner sent another free-kick into the top corner to tie the game. That sent the game to penalties.

Messi scored the opening goal in Miami's Leagues Cup clash with Dallas on Sunday - but only after the referee consulted video replays to overturn an offside decision. It was Messi's sixth goal in just four games since moving to the United States. It was also the third time in as many matches that the World Cup winner had flown out of the blocks. In Texas on Sunday, Messi stroked the ball home from the edge of the box following a pull-back from Alba, who was making his first start since joining his former Barcelona teammate in Florida. Lionel Messi needed six minutes to rekindle his partnership with former teamate Jordi Alba The goal bore striking resemblance to a iconic goal in 2017, when the pair combined for Messi to score an injury-time winner at the home of great rivals Real Madrid. The goal on Sunday was initially ruled out for offside against Josef Martinez, who was adjudged to have obstructed the view of Dallas goalkeeper Maarten Paes. But referee Cesar Ramos was advised to consult his pitchside monitor and soon the official had changed the call. It marked the first time Messi has combined with Alba, with whom he came through the academy at Barcelona. Messi stroked the ball home from the edge of the box following a pull-back from Alba Messi's opening goal against Dallas came in the sixth minute. Against Orlando City last time out, he netted after seven minutes. In his first start last month, a 4-0 win over Atlanta United, Messi needed only eight minutes to find the target. The goal, which took Messi alongside Minnesota's Bongokuhle Hlongwane in the Leagues Cup top scorers list, came just a couple of minutes after Dallas thought they had taken the lead. But the home team was on the wrong end of an offside call, with Jesus Ferreira's header ruled out by the assistant referee. Dallas did lead by the break, however, following two goals in eight minutes. That meant Inter Miami trailled for the first time in the tournament. After Dallas made it 3-1, Messi and Alba comibed once more to create a second Miami goal for Benjamin Cremaschi.

The problem lies with the kickoff time of 8.30pm AEST, which puts the broadcast of the match on Channel Seven past the bedtime of millions of young Australians who would love nothing better than to stay up and cheer on Sam Kerr and the rest of the squad. As it stands, the action is tipped to finish at around 10.30pm AEST - but that only applies if the result is decided in 90 minutes of regulation time. Since the round-of-16 match is a knockout fixture, it will go to two extra time periods of 15 minutes each if the scores are still locked up at fulltime. If the sides are still level after the extra 30 minutes of play, the result will be decided by a penalty shootout that works under a best-of-five system. Many young Matildas fans will be unable to watch the team do battle with Denmark due to the late kickoff putting the action past their bedtime (pictured, local football supporters at the Australia vs Ireland World Cup match) The game could finish long after 10.30pm if extra time and a penalty shootout are needed to get a result - which is a relatively common way for matches in big tournaments to end Should the tie remain unbroken after that, the shootout continues in a sudden-death format. Matches in the knockout stages of big tournaments like the Women's World Cup are often decided in penalty shootouts, and Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson - along with goalie Mackenzie Arnold - have confirmed they're preparing for the match to end that way. If the Denmark contest is decided in a shootout following two extra periods of play, that would set the end of the contest back to the point where many Aussie adults would be worried about staying up past their bedtime - never mind their young children. While the 8.30pm start time isn't the latest kickoff in the round-of-16 - France's game against Morocco on Tuesday begins at 9pm AEST - it is the latest for a match featuring Australia in the tournament so far. And while it must be pointed out that tournament organisers had no way of knowing the Matildas would fall into that slot ahead of time - as there was no guarantee the Aussies would even make it out of the group stage - local fans still have a legitimate gripe with the late start. Millions of Aussies are expected to tune in to see whether injured skipper Sam Kerr (pictured) can make an impact after she promised she will play against the Danes If the match stretches through the usual best-of-five penalty shootout and goes into a sudden-death contest based on kicks from the spot, the action will go past the bedtime of some Aussie adults, never mind their young kids (pictured, young Matildas fans at the Ireland game) The 8.30pm AEST kickoff translates to an 11.30am start in London, 12.30pm in the Danish capital of Copenhagen, 6.30am in New York and 3.30am in Los Angeles. Catering for the huge European and American markets is a delicate balancing act for World Cup organisers as they try to maximise ratings while also dealing with the huge time differences between those countries and hosts Australia and New Zealand. But one of the greatest benefits of hosting a World Cup is the way games are timed to fit in with the regular pattern of life instead of forcing fans to upend their sleeping patterns to see the action as it happens. Australians have already slammed the fact they can't watch the vast majority of the tournament on TV because most matches are behind Optus Sport's paywall, with only 15 of the Cup's 64 games available for free on Channel Seven. Between that and the time zone problem, keeping everyone happy is impossible - but Matildas fans know every game from here on could be the team's last in what is a once-in-a-lifetime home World Cup. That's why the crucial 30-minute delay that could prove the difference between young fans experiencing a priceless sporting memory or sleeping straight through it is sure to get Aussies offside.

The Matildas are readying themselves for their do-or-die clash with Denmark in Sydney as they hope to book a berth in the quarter finals. On Sunday, Caitlin Foord said that she was impressed with the support from Aussies but would like more noise from Sydney fans. 'I said it before, and I still think Sydney could be louder,' said Foord. 'I hope it is tomorrow. By far, at the moment, Melbourne has definitely took top notch - so I definitely want my home team to take that up.' The Matildas Active Support group (pictured before Australia's World Cup match against Nigeria) is hoping more fans will find their voice on Monday for the Denmark game The group is hoping Aussie fans will get more involved as the tournament goes on and they get used to the way hardcore football supporters pump up their team at big games Cat Gaggin, a member of the Matildas Active Support group, is hoping more supporters will find their voice. 'As Australians we love sports. No matter what it is, we're always going to turn up,' Gaggin Wide World of Sports . 'We are a group that is turning up and getting loud, and hopefully the more that we win and the more matches that we play , the louder we'll get.' Her fellow group member Liam Parslow says Aussie football fans are content to sit back and enjoy the spectacle rather than get vocal like other footballing nations around the world. 'I think Australian sporting crowds are conservative in general,' he said. 'Australian sporting fans like to be entertained but football crowds are different; we like to be involved, more hands-on, and we're very vocal and passionate.' For many Aussies, the World Cup is their first experience of big football matches, so the supporter group anticipates fans will get more involved as the tournament goes on. 'It is so many people's first football match that they're getting to see live and it is also their first chance to see the Matildas play,' Gaggin said. The Women's World Cup is the first time many Aussies have experienced huge football crowds and the culture that goes with them Matildas Active Support have many songs and chants ready for the match on Monday night 'With this World Cup on home soil, we need to build on people wanting to come to the football and then we can build the chants up from there.' 'European and South American football, they've been doing this for generations. Their chants have been around for generations. 'We can't compare as that's their life, football is everything to them.' Matildas Active Support have a well-developed songbook with team songs, Aussie anthems and individual player chants - and on Monday night they will be hard to miss at Stadium Australia. 'We're trying to get everyone on board with the same songs. They are pretty easy to learn once you know them,' Gaggin says. Fellow group member Majella Card adds: 'Even if you don't want to get up and sing, clap along with the beat of the drums because the drums are always going.'

They recruited experienced midfielder Ikay Gundogan, who captained Manchester City to the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble last season, ending a successful seven-year stint in England during which he won 12 major trophies. Gundogan will help mentor a young Barca squad as they try to retain the LaLiga crown and get back to winning ways in the Champions League after years of European disappointments. They exited at the group stage of Europe's top club competition for the second year in a row last season and were knocked out of the Europa League by Manchester United. Barcelona have won the Champions League five times, most recently in 2015, and face a tough task to get back to the top table of European football after being forced to sell club legend Lionel Messi due to financial problems. Their outstanding domestic campaign was somewhat overshadowed by turmoil off the pitch including deepening financial issues and a refereeing scandal that could drag on for years. Spanish prosecutors in March filed a complaint over alleged payments Barcelona made from 2001 to 2018 totalling €7.3 million to firms owned by former refereeing official Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. A Barcelona court has agreed to take on the case and UEFA has provisionally cleared the club to compete in this season's Champions League despite ongoing investigations. They will not be able to play at their beloved Camp Nou for the next few seasons as they have agreed a financing deal worth €1.45 billion to renovate the iconic but outdated stadium. The 100,000-seater Camp Nou was the club's biggest source of income and they will be forced to be creative to stay competitive within the restrictions of LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Gundogan's arrival, Lewandowski's consistency, reliable goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and young players like Pedri, Gavi, Ronald Araujo, Luuk De Jong and Jules Kounde give Xavi a plenty of reasons to be optimistic. But he suffered a big blow last week with news of the imminent departure of French winger Ousmane Dembele who is joining Paris St Germain. Barcelona begin their LaLiga defence on Sunday (Aug 6) in the Spanish capital against Getafe and although the fans are still celebrating last season's romp to the title, there is plenty for them to be concerned about.","pubDate":"2023-08-07 02:04:57","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--aB8lz39Q--/c_fill,h_900,w_1600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2023-08-07t020457z_1_lynxmpej76010_rtroptp_3_soccer-spain-fcb-soc-report.jpg?itok=HEfWhcr4","source_id":"channelnewsasia","category":["sports"],"country":["singapore"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lionel Messi inspires Inter Miami to incredible victory over Dallas... netting ANOTHER late free-kick in 4-4 tie before Tata Martino's side win dramatic penalty shootout in Texas","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12379635/Lionel-Messi-inspires-Inter-Miami-incredible-victory-Dallas-netting-late-free-kick-4-4-tie-Tata-Martinos-win-dramatic-penalty-shootout-Texas.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Heading into the final 10 minutes, Inter Miami trailed 4-2.

Messi scored the opening goal in Miami's Leagues Cup clash with Dallas on Sunday - but only after the referee consulted video replays to overturn an offside decision. It was Messi's sixth goal in just four games since moving to the United States. It was also the third time in as many matches that the World Cup winner had flown out of the blocks. In Texas on Sunday, Messi stroked the ball home from the edge of the box following a pull-back from Alba, who was making his first start since joining his former Barcelona teammate in Florida. Lionel Messi needed six minutes to rekindle his partnership with former teamate Jordi Alba The goal bore striking resemblance to a iconic goal in 2017, when the pair combined for Messi to score an injury-time winner at the home of great rivals Real Madrid. The goal on Sunday was initially ruled out for offside against Josef Martinez, who was adjudged to have obstructed the view of Dallas goalkeeper Maarten Paes. But referee Cesar Ramos was advised to consult his pitchside monitor and soon the official had changed the call. It marked the first time Messi has combined with Alba, with whom he came through the academy at Barcelona. Messi stroked the ball home from the edge of the box following a pull-back from Alba Messi's opening goal against Dallas came in the sixth minute. Against Orlando City last time out, he netted after seven minutes. In his first start last month, a 4-0 win over Atlanta United, Messi needed only eight minutes to find the target. The goal, which took Messi alongside Minnesota's Bongokuhle Hlongwane in the Leagues Cup top scorers list, came just a couple of minutes after Dallas thought they had taken the lead. But the home team was on the wrong end of an offside call, with Jesus Ferreira's header ruled out by the assistant referee. Dallas did lead by the break, however, following two goals in eight minutes. That meant Inter Miami trailled for the first time in the tournament. After Dallas made it 3-1, Messi and Alba comibed once more to create a second Miami goal for Benjamin Cremaschi.

The problem lies with the kickoff time of 8.30pm AEST, which puts the broadcast of the match on Channel Seven past the bedtime of millions of young Australians who would love nothing better than to stay up and cheer on Sam Kerr and the rest of the squad. As it stands, the action is tipped to finish at around 10.30pm AEST - but that only applies if the result is decided in 90 minutes of regulation time. Since the round-of-16 match is a knockout fixture, it will go to two extra time periods of 15 minutes each if the scores are still locked up at fulltime. If the sides are still level after the extra 30 minutes of play, the result will be decided by a penalty shootout that works under a best-of-five system. Many young Matildas fans will be unable to watch the team do battle with Denmark due to the late kickoff putting the action past their bedtime (pictured, local football supporters at the Australia vs Ireland World Cup match) The game could finish long after 10.30pm if extra time and a penalty shootout are needed to get a result - which is a relatively common way for matches in big tournaments to end Should the tie remain unbroken after that, the shootout continues in a sudden-death format. Matches in the knockout stages of big tournaments like the Women's World Cup are often decided in penalty shootouts, and Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson - along with goalie Mackenzie Arnold - have confirmed they're preparing for the match to end that way. If the Denmark contest is decided in a shootout following two extra periods of play, that would set the end of the contest back to the point where many Aussie adults would be worried about staying up past their bedtime - never mind their young children. While the 8.30pm start time isn't the latest kickoff in the round-of-16 - France's game against Morocco on Tuesday begins at 9pm AEST - it is the latest for a match featuring Australia in the tournament so far. And while it must be pointed out that tournament organisers had no way of knowing the Matildas would fall into that slot ahead of time - as there was no guarantee the Aussies would even make it out of the group stage - local fans still have a legitimate gripe with the late start. Millions of Aussies are expected to tune in to see whether injured skipper Sam Kerr (pictured) can make an impact after she promised she will play against the Danes If the match stretches through the usual best-of-five penalty shootout and goes into a sudden-death contest based on kicks from the spot, the action will go past the bedtime of some Aussie adults, never mind their young kids (pictured, young Matildas fans at the Ireland game) The 8.30pm AEST kickoff translates to an 11.30am start in London, 12.30pm in the Danish capital of Copenhagen, 6.30am in New York and 3.30am in Los Angeles. Catering for the huge European and American markets is a delicate balancing act for World Cup organisers as they try to maximise ratings while also dealing with the huge time differences between those countries and hosts Australia and New Zealand. But one of the greatest benefits of hosting a World Cup is the way games are timed to fit in with the regular pattern of life instead of forcing fans to upend their sleeping patterns to see the action as it happens. Australians have already slammed the fact they can't watch the vast majority of the tournament on TV because most matches are behind Optus Sport's paywall, with only 15 of the Cup's 64 games available for free on Channel Seven. Between that and the time zone problem, keeping everyone happy is impossible - but Matildas fans know every game from here on could be the team's last in what is a once-in-a-lifetime home World Cup. That's why the crucial 30-minute delay that could prove the difference between young fans experiencing a priceless sporting memory or sleeping straight through it is sure to get Aussies offside.

The Matildas are readying themselves for their do-or-die clash with Denmark in Sydney as they hope to book a berth in the quarter finals. On Sunday, Caitlin Foord said that she was impressed with the support from Aussies but would like more noise from Sydney fans. 'I said it before, and I still think Sydney could be louder,' said Foord. 'I hope it is tomorrow. By far, at the moment, Melbourne has definitely took top notch - so I definitely want my home team to take that up.' The Matildas Active Support group (pictured before Australia's World Cup match against Nigeria) is hoping more fans will find their voice on Monday for the Denmark game The group is hoping Aussie fans will get more involved as the tournament goes on and they get used to the way hardcore football supporters pump up their team at big games Cat Gaggin, a member of the Matildas Active Support group, is hoping more supporters will find their voice. 'As Australians we love sports. No matter what it is, we're always going to turn up,' Gaggin Wide World of Sports . 'We are a group that is turning up and getting loud, and hopefully the more that we win and the more matches that we play , the louder we'll get.' Her fellow group member Liam Parslow says Aussie football fans are content to sit back and enjoy the spectacle rather than get vocal like other footballing nations around the world. 'I think Australian sporting crowds are conservative in general,' he said. 'Australian sporting fans like to be entertained but football crowds are different; we like to be involved, more hands-on, and we're very vocal and passionate.' For many Aussies, the World Cup is their first experience of big football matches, so the supporter group anticipates fans will get more involved as the tournament goes on. 'It is so many people's first football match that they're getting to see live and it is also their first chance to see the Matildas play,' Gaggin said. The Women's World Cup is the first time many Aussies have experienced huge football crowds and the culture that goes with them Matildas Active Support have many songs and chants ready for the match on Monday night 'With this World Cup on home soil, we need to build on people wanting to come to the football and then we can build the chants up from there.' 'European and South American football, they've been doing this for generations. Their chants have been around for generations. 'We can't compare as that's their life, football is everything to them.' Matildas Active Support have a well-developed songbook with team songs, Aussie anthems and individual player chants - and on Monday night they will be hard to miss at Stadium Australia. 'We're trying to get everyone on board with the same songs. They are pretty easy to learn once you know them,' Gaggin says. Fellow group member Majella Card adds: 'Even if you don't want to get up and sing, clap along with the beat of the drums because the drums are always going.'

Gundogan will help mentor a young Barca squad as they try to retain the LaLiga crown and get back to winning ways in the Champions League after years of European disappointments. They exited at the group stage of Europe's top club competition for the second year in a row last season and were knocked out of the Europa League by Manchester United. Barcelona have won the Champions League five times, most recently in 2015, and face a tough task to get back to the top table of European football after being forced to sell club legend Lionel Messi due to financial problems. Their outstanding domestic campaign was somewhat overshadowed by turmoil off the pitch including deepening financial issues and a refereeing scandal that could drag on for years. Spanish prosecutors in March filed a complaint over alleged payments Barcelona made from 2001 to 2018 totalling €7.3 million to firms owned by former refereeing official Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. A Barcelona court has agreed to take on the case and UEFA has provisionally cleared the club to compete in this season's Champions League despite ongoing investigations. They will not be able to play at their beloved Camp Nou for the next few seasons as they have agreed a financing deal worth €1.45 billion to renovate the iconic but outdated stadium. The 100,000-seater Camp Nou was the club's biggest source of income and they will be forced to be creative to stay competitive within the restrictions of LaLiga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Gundogan's arrival, Lewandowski's consistency, reliable goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and young players like Pedri, Gavi, Ronald Araujo, Luuk De Jong and Jules Kounde give Xavi a plenty of reasons to be optimistic. But he suffered a big blow last week with news of the imminent departure of French winger Ousmane Dembele who is joining Paris St Germain. Barcelona begin their LaLiga defence on Sunday (Aug 6) in the Spanish capital against Getafe and although the fans are still celebrating last season's romp to the title, there is plenty for them to be concerned about.","pubDate":"2023-08-07 02:04:57","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--aB8lz39Q--/c_fill,h_900,w_1600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2023-08-07t020457z_1_lynxmpej76010_rtroptp_3_soccer-spain-fcb-soc-report.jpg?itok=HEfWhcr4","source_id":"channelnewsasia","category":["sports"],"country":["singapore"],"language":"english"}]}
