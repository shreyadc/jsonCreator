Food that are fit for consumption as per Jewish law are only permissible. 21 November, 2022 OpIndia Staff FIFA World Cup 2022: Qatar will not serve kosher food for Jewish visitors, says report Facebook Twitter Telegram Email WhatsApp 2 Jewish organisations have said that Qatar has backtracked from promise of offering kosher food to visitors at the 2022 FIFA Football World Cup the Gulf country is hosting. According to The Jerusalem Post, Qatar will not allow any cooked kosher food be sold or offered to visitors. As per the report, Doha had promised to allow Jewish prayer services during the games but has backed out claiming they could not ‘secure’ this type of activity and proceeded to ban it completely. Citing a representative of Jewish organisation, TJP reported, that they were promised they would be allowed to create their prayer space for those religious Jews who come to watch the games. About 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world are expected to come to Doha during the World Cup. They were informed they would be able to cook kosher meat but are now informed that they will only be allowed cold bagel sandwiches. Kosher foods are food that conform to dietary regulations of the Jewish community. Food that are fit for consumption as per Jewish law are only permissible. A lot of wealthy American Jews were planning to visit Doha, but now have cancelled as they do not feel secured about kosher food, Shabbat meals and no public prayer services. Jerusalem Post has reached out to Qatari Foreign Ministry for comments but have not heard back from them yet. Earlier on Sunday, The Jerusalem Post was informed that the Jewish people will be able to buy kosher sandwiches in Qatar. In fact, opening of first ever kosher kitchen in time for the games was also announced recently. The kosher kitchen is under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik of Istanbul, chairman of the Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States, and his son Rabbi Eliyahu Chitrik. This kitchen will bake bagels and other ethnically Jewish delicacies. It will sell challah for Shabbat, bagel sandwiches with hummus, vegetables and smoked salmon. However, twarm kosher food will be served to Jewish visitors in Qatar only if they come in large groups. Support Us Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

But Webster had other ideas.“I told Shaun that if he had the fire and ambition to play at the highest level and to his potential then I wanted him here,” Webster said. “I couldn’t have made that clearer. He couldn’t have answered stronger.“I know when he is happy off the field and connected to his family that Shaun plays his best football. I know that from first hand experience. When he returned home late last year he played his best football. I’m excited about the legacy Shaun can leave.”APPOINTMENTUnlike his former fellow assistant coach at Penrith Cameron Ciraldo, Webster’s appointment went largely under the radar. Ciraldo attracted almost daily headlines with clubs scrambling for his signature. At the Warriors though they had eyes for Webster following Nathan Brown’s abrupt exit. Webster had the benefit of having worked at the Warriors previously for two seasons under Andrew McFadden.“It felt good,” Webster said. “Everyone asks if you’re ready to be a head coach. If I stayed at Penrith for five more years then I would’ve been five more years ready. Having an opportunity to work at a club I knew and felt comfortable at is a big advantage. If someone else got offered the Warriors job and had never been or loved living in Auckland it would’ve been a different challenge.”Webster spoke with Panthers coach Ivan Cleary, who remains highly respected at the Warriors before taking on the job.“Like anything in life you sit there and you work out the pros and cons,” Webster said. “It wasn’t a hard sell but I had to go through every part of it. I had a good feeling in my stomach throughout the whole process.“The conversations with Ivan were largely around him being a friend and mentor. He was a great sounding board and very supportive.”COPY CAT Webster has had first grade coaching experience before. It may have been for only two games as an interim coach at the Tigers in 2017 but the sideshow which accompanied that short stint has prepared Webster for what is coming.“It helped me a huge amount in a lot of ways,” Webster said. “As an interim coach, one thing I do know now is that you can have an influence but you can’t change the world in seven days. You can make them happier and change things slightly.“It is mental rather than technical. I walked away from the experience feeling that the pressure didn’t get much more than what I faced and I felt comfortable. “I know there is a different element now because I really had nothing to lose. But getting microphones thrown in front of your face with 20 journalists standing in front of you on day one — I don’t think anything can prepare you for that. I walked away from that experience feeling more comfortable managing a group.”The Tigers stint may have hardened Webster for the challenge ahead but it was his two seasons at Penrith which opened his eyes to success. The easy option? To mimic what he learnt at the Panthers.“The biggest mistake coaches make is they copy and paste things from where they’ve been,” Webster said. “But that might not suit this group of players. We have things that are non-negotiables. “We are going to have a team that works hard and be a skilful attacking side. “There are a million things that are fresh about the Warriors. We’ve gone home and have stability. “The good parts of the roster are still around and we’ve signed good players. There isn’t a complete overhaul of the staff but it feels new. “The best way for the Warriors to have success is via the pathways which is hard to do when the players haven’t been in New Zealand.“The staff have done a terrific job while the NRL side has been away.”HALVES BATTLESDylan Walker headlines a list of new recruits. He joins the likes of Marata Niukore, Luke Metcalf, Mitchell Barnett and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad as the new faces.“I see Dylan as that perfect No. 14,” Webster said. “He can play anywhere at a high level. If we have injuries he may play centre one week but if everyone is fit and healthy he will be our bench utility.“Metcalf is exciting. He is ambitious. “He is going to push everyone to take a spot. Ronald Volkman wants to be a starting halfback. It’s going to create a headache for me.”","pubDate":"2022-11-21 05:11:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Idiot’: Gallen caught up in petty prank","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/boxing-mma/tim-tszyu-trolls-boxing-rival-michael-zerafa-with-savage-prank-call/news-story/c2fe03660c47a1644064ffbd6c31158a","keywords":["Boxing MMA","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tim Tszyu doesn’t forget.","content":"The Australian boxing star has reminded his long time boxing foe Michael Zerafa there is no love between them with a savage phone call prank.Zerafa is headlining a boxing card in Sydney on Wednesday night that will feature the rematch between Paul Gallen and Justin Hodges. Watch Gallen v Hodges 2 & Michael Zerafa’s return to the ring LIVE on Main Event available on Foxtel & Kayo Sports, Wednesday November 23 from 7pm AEDT ORDER NOW >Zerafa (30-4) had been engaging in some verbal warfare with his opponent Danilo Creati at the pre-fight press conference when Gallen, who was sitting next to him, received a phone call from Tszyu.With his phone to his ear, Gallen said: “Timmy’s watching. I’m going to give him a wave. “Timmy wants to know if you’re going to turn up to this one. He just wants to make sure you turn up.”The cheeky dig was in reference to Zerafa pulling out of his much-anticipated fight against Tszyu last year at the 11th hour because his camp was concerned about strict Covid pandemic rules in Newcastle.“Tszyu, there we go. From one idiot to the next,” Zerafa said in response to Tszyu’s prank call.“I’ll turn up mate, don’t worry.”It was an impressively petty act considering Tszyu was in Melbourne for a Kayo Sports publicity event while Zerafa’s press conference was being held in Sydney.Tszyu is preparing for a blockbuster world title fight against Jermell Charlo in Las Vegas in January and will become the undisputed superwelterweight champion if he wins.“He said he’s going to turn up,” said Gallen, who was relishing the antics. “I’ll have a good chat to him. “That’s not me trying to pick a fight with him (Zerafa) either. Timmy just called. I’ll put in on silent, sorry.”Zerafa is the No. 1 ranked middleweight fighter in the world and could face boxing legend Gennady Golovkin next year for the WBA middleweight title.Tszyu has repeatedly said he has no plans to fight Zerafa, but the 30-year-old believes the two Aussie rivals will face off in the ring one day.“Tell him I’ll be turning up to his fight and helping him get picked up once Charlo knocks him out,” Zerafa said.“We’ll definitely cross paths. He knows that. I know that. He knows there was more to the situation for why the fight didn’t happen.“I’m blessed to be back and like I said, once he gets knocked out by Charlo he’s got to come back and build himself up. I’ll be winning Wednesday and I’ve got my world title fight in March. I’m here, I’m ready to go.

I’m a tween watching “Ocean’s Eleven” at Provo’s now-defunct Movies 8, and out of nowhere I hear it: Have you been to Utah? I think you’d really dig Provo. It’s a line spoken by one of the “Mormon twins” — two of the titular 11 — and it’s a simple throwaway joke. But it stopped me in my tracks. Hollywood knew about Latter-day Saints? About Provo? Up until that moment, I hadn’t realized that for all my participation in pop culture, I had never expected to be included in it. I blasted Backstreet Boys but turned down the volume if ever they swore. My friends and I found ways to sanitize music and movies. Like a wholesome version of telephone we used some combination of denial and CleanFlicks to force popular media into a form we could consume. We didn’t do this with anger or indignation, just a tacit understanding that to be in the world but not “of the world” meant accepting the fact media would never include us. But then, there it was! You’d really dig Provo. Four words I still remember hearing 20 years later. It’s a memory that proves what I’ve been trying to for years: being included matters, and it matters for Latter-day Saints, too. For some years now, I’ve co-run an Instagram account called @MormonsInMedia . It started as a joke between my writing partner Jill and I, where we’d text each other any time one of us saw the word “Mormon” pop up in something we were reading or watching. It was always surprising, rarely accurate and sometimes painful. Once we started tracking the references, we couldn’t stop seeing them. Minimal effort revealed Latter-day Saint moments in what felt like every major TV show from the last 30 years: “ Friends ,” “ Frasier ,” “ Cheers ,” “ Gossip Girl ,” “ 30 Rock ,” “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ,” “ Stranger Things ” — and what feels like every season of “The Bachelor.” There is a Latter-day Saint joke in the very first and very last episode of “ New Girl .” There are six references across the seven seasons of “ Gilmore Girls .” And that’s just TV. We’ve found innumerable references in books, podcasts, music and other forms of media. At first, every reference felt thrilling. But by the time we had enough to fill a spreadsheet we found ourselves annoyed. Nearly every reference was a casual joke about the cultural aspects or stereotypes of our faith that make us feel unrelatable. We didn’t feel represented, we felt caricatured. Jill and I started to think twice about our instinct to expect nothing by way of representation. If Latter-day Saints are such an inconsequential group as to not deserve it, why did we show up so often? And if we did deserve representation, why wasn’t any of it better? My definition of quality representation is a portrayal that expands a group beyond a stereotype. Something that adds complexity or humanity. Over the last four years, I’ve seen so many types of representation, I made a rubric to help myself categorize and assess them. The Representation rubric C grade: Punchlines that play on Latter-day Saint stereotypes. B grade: Stories that represent Latter-day Saints well. A grade : Well-told Latter-day Saint stories from Latter-day Saint voices. I’m aware this is a highly subjective grading scale, based entirely on my viewing preferences rather than what is empirically bad or good. But here are what grades I’m giving out, if I’m teaching the class. The C’s: Up until very recently, almost every reference we came across fell into the C category. There are the classic polygamy jokes, like in “ Two Weeks Notice ” where Sandra Bullock says “maybe in Utah” she could take two dates to dinner. There are the sobriety jokes, like the moment Michael Scott reads a supposed piece of Latter-day Saint literature at Meredith’s intervention , or on “ Friends ” when Rachel debates telling a date she can’t drink because she’s a Latter-day Saint (she’s pregnant). In “ That ’70s Show ” we have too many kids. In “ 30 Rock ,” we’re so weird we celebrate leap day. On their own, most of these jokes made me laugh. But taken together, the humor starts to feel lazy. Offensive or not, this type of reference reduces Latter-day Saints into stereotypes and punchlines. We are chaste, or sober, or polygamists, or nice. In a word, we are made to seem “other,” and we mostly exist to make people laugh. The B’s: To me, representing Latter-day Saints well means making them well-rounded. I’m not interested in seeing perfect Latter-day Saints — I want to see real ones. Complicated ones. And I am thrilled to have seen them in a few places this year. When we first learned that Dustin had a Latter-day Saint girlfriend in Season 3 of “Stranger Things,” I felt a familiar dread. What would they make of Suzie? A weirdo? Another caricature? I was not expecting a hero. In Season 4, not only do we get more mentions of Suzie, we road trip to her house! Inside is a happy chaos of creative children and rebellious teenagers. There is Suzie’s dad, writing her a heartfelt (and painfully accurate) letter about dating outside the church. There are her siblings filming a very dramatic piece of theater. There is brilliant Suzie out on the roof working on her telescope. I have known families like Suzie’s, and I loved watching their eccentricities dialed up to an eleven for the big screen. I loved it, really, because Suzie was more than just a token believer. She’s a no-nonsense hacker who saves the day. Her eccentricities are endearing, and while her religion is one of them, it’s just that — one. HBO’s “ Tokyo Vice ” follows the story of Jake Adelstein, an American writer for a Japanese newspaper who starts covering yakuza gangs. One of his few ex-pat friends is Samantha — a smart, self-assured hostess with dreams of starting her own club if only she can outrun her past. Midway through the season, we find out what that past entails — a Latter-day Saint mission and subsequent crime against her faith. Her mission for the church serves as a rich backstory for the character. It is the reason she fell in love with Japanese culture, the thing she painfully went against in order to stay in the country. And the details are spot-on, from the CTR ring buried in her jewelry box to flashbacks of her cheerily riding a bike through the streets of Japan wearing a knee-length skirt, nametag and helmet. Watching it, I felt certain there was a Latter-day Saint in the writers' room, but despite extensive googling so far, I’ve found zero connections. Even though the show is based on a memoir of the same name, Samantha’s character in the book is not a member of the church. But frankly, I don’t care whether it was written by a Latter-day Saint, because whoever did write it did their research. And I don’t care that it’s a bit far-fetched, I’m here for the ride. She is savvy and brave and was once a Latter-day Saint missionary. She’s complicated, and that makes her feel real. The A’s: To me, it’s a no-brainer that any group’s stories should come from its own people. But what’s interesting when the group is a religion is how widely the tone of each voice can vary depending on their experiences. I do understand the frustration of feeling like our stories most often come from disillusioned voices, which is why it was so refreshing to read Jennette McCurdy’s depictions in her buzzy new memoir “ I’m Glad My Mom Died.” The book chronicles McCurdy’s experience as a child actor and the trauma she suffered. We also learn that the “iCarly” star grew up in the faith (who knew?) and was significantly influenced by it in her younger years. Her experiences range from loving the warm fuzzy feeling she got in Primary to hating feeling like people expected her family to go inactive. Her passages about church are detailed and accurate and funny, and most surprisingly to me, they felt neutral. It’s clear McCurdy is no longer attending church. But it also seems clear she doesn’t carry any bitterness toward it. She treats her time as a Latter-day Saint the same way she does everything else in her book — with bitingly honest humor that left me aching for her as a much more complex person than the child actor I thought I knew. The most positive example I’ve seen this year was “ The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist,” which told the story of Manti Teo’s superstardom through college and the scandal that later came to define him. The show is humanizing both for Manti and for Ronniah (the alleged girlfriend), adding complexity to a story that millions of people across the globe had simplified to a headline, or maybe even to a meme. Teo says that the three pillars of his culture are faith, family and football. Throughout the show his faith is a steadying, behind-the-scenes factor that keeps him grounded. It’s the reason he chose to attend Notre Dame where his career took off, and it ends up being the thing that helps him forgive himself and move on. I felt refreshed to see a positive portrayal of Teo’s faith. But more, I appreciated hearing the story straight from its subjects. Everyone’s story counts. And I just want to see more of them told. And given the explosion of Latter-day Saint-related content we’ve seen in recent years, I have to think it’s possible. I am increasingly convinced that Latter-day Saints deserve mainstream media representation, not because we are marginalized but because we are unique. And we have a complicated history and a rich present. One of us is currently on “Survivor.” One of us was almost the president of the United States. All of us have stories to tell. And I can only hope that with this recent surge of shows that we begin to also see more rich and varied representation than what we’ve seen in the past. I’m holding out for a still-practicing Latter-day Saint to write something honest and beautiful and painful and funny about the complex lives real Latter-day Saints live. I want a show about a singles ward that isn’t “The Singles Ward.” I want to watch a mixed-faith couple or a couple who overcame hardship or a struggling missionary or a mega-popular vlogger who happens to also be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Maybe I’m asking for too much? But then again, we still believe in miracles.","pubDate":"2022-11-21 04:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mercato - PSG : Un duo légendaire entre Ronaldo et Messi bientôt à Paris ?","link":"https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/mercato-psg-un-duo-legendaire-entre-ronaldo-et-messi-bientot-a-paris-622424","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Depuis le lancement du projet QSI à Paris, il est question d’un rêve de faire venir l’une des deux figures de proue du football mondial.

The image was shared by both footballers on the eve of the start of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, through their Instagram accounts. While some social media users called it “iconic”, others hailed it as the “picture of the century”. With both of them sharing 12 Ballon d’Or’s between them, Ronaldo and Messi came together for a promotion campaign by Louis Vuitton ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Many view the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to be the final one for both players with the Argentinian great already confirming it. However, the Portuguese star has said he wants to play for a few more years. On Saturday, the fans of both players were in for a treat as Louis Vuitton released their new campaign featuring both of them. The two legendary footballers can be seen playing chess together in the picture with both deep in concentration on what their next move would be.

The Championships will be exclusively live streamed by KommunityTV from November 28-December 2 with the coverage including at least every match of the Championship division. The towering Raison will play centre for the Willetton side as they duke it out with the best basketball schools across the country. A WAFL Women’s first team regular for East Fremantle, Raison has the opportunity to cap a stellar year on the sporting fields which also included a breakout performance in the annual AFLW Futures match. The Year 11 student has shown an impressive ability across both the football field and the basketball court, putting her on the cusp of a tough decision to pick between the two. One person who knows about that decision well is Raison’s coach at Willetton Senior High, Danika Pisconeri, who showed plenty of talent in both sports before joining the West Coast Eagles AFLW squad in 2020. Pisconeri admitted she saw similarities in Raison’s rise as a dual-code athlete to her own journey, and said it was the youngster’s commitment to her craft that set her apart from her competition. “I think we do have similarities, in our body type and our frame, but I like to think we are similar because we love the team environment and work hard for our teammates,” Pisconeri said. “She has the benefit of the physicality from both sports, she’s not afraid of boxing out and rebounding. But it is the basics that she does well. Her work ethic, being a good teammate and having good communication. “She is composed and she is really coachable. You can push her in a session and then sit there afterwards and have a 30 minute conversation.

Despite being a school that has produced top talents in the past, including Cavaliers 2022 NBA draftee Luke Travers, Pisconeri said that the west was often overlooked on the national stage. “Before Covid-19 hit, the school had been going to the nationals for the past 32 years,” she said. “We have a board in the gym that details all the times we have medalled in the past. It is important to reinforce that history with our players. “There can sometimes be a little misconception at national tournaments of the level of WA teams and players. There have been times where we haven’t performed as well at these events, but we are not going to the Gold Coast for a week off.” The Willetton girls start their campaign with two games on the Monday against Templestowe College and a Lake Ginninderra side which features several BA Centre of Excellence talents.

L’équipe d’Ihorombe a même dominé au retour des vestiaires mais rate une nette occasion, l’attaquant Gildas n’a pas trouvé le cadre seul face au portier d’Andoharanofotsy, Chrétien (63e). «Les joueurs ont beau chercher le premier but mais ont raté une occasion nette. CFFA a réagi et a marqué à son tour… Nous étions plus stratèges en attaque et ont encore pu garder le score vierge à la pause mais en vain» regrette le coach du Mama FC, Careca Oelison Rafanomezantso. Le Barea, Rakool a ouvert la marque du côté du CFFA en transformant un penalty à la 70e minute. Le défenseur central du Mama FC, Bal a touché le ballon par la main, un tir d’Amoros à l’entrée de la surface. CFFA creuse l’écart grâce à un coup franc bien placé sur le côté droit. Le même Rakool a réalisé un doublé en plaçant cette fois la balle au deuxième poteau du portier, Mika (76e). «La confiance a été au rendez-vous. Nous avons un jeu simple sans se précipiter… Nous étions plus expérimentés » a mentionné le coach Titi Rasoanivo après le match inaugural. L’équipe de l’assurance a réduit l’écart peu de temps avant le coup de sifflet final. Après avoir éliminé Bertho puis le gardien Chrétien, il a mal contrôlé la balle et heureusement que Roni, l’attaquant a été juste à ses côtés pour la finition (87e). Bon début également pour Elgeco Plus, club vainqueur de la coupe de Madagascar qui a défait sur sa pelouse Disciples FC par 1 à 0, unique but signé Nest (19e). À Vontovorona hier, les Majungais du Fosa Juniors FC ont écarté pour leur part l’AS Fanalamanga sur le même score.","pubDate":"2022-11-21 02:30:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"lexpress","country":["Madagascar"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french"},{"title":"England vs Iran FIFA World Cup 2022 LIVE Streaming: How to watch ENG vs IRA and football World Cup matches for free online and TV in India?","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/football/england-vs-iran-fifa-world-cup-2022-live-streaming-how-to-watch-eng-vs-ira-and-football-world-cup-matches-for-free-online-and-tv-in-india-2538137.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Know here all the details related to the livestreaming of FIFA World Cup 2022 Group B match between England and Iran.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-21 02:27:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I’d never missed the start of a men’s World Cup.

In the Persian Gulf, host nation Qatar were kicking off the men’s World Cup against Ecuador, while at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea were taking on London rivals Spurs in the English Women’s Super League. Could the weather or cultural climates have been more antithetical? Some context. I haven’t missed an opening match of a World Cup since England played Uruguay in 1966, a 0-0 draw watched on black and white television. In 56 years I’ve never faced the choice I faced last night. In the end, FIFA President Gianni Infantino made the choice simple, with his bizarre speech: “Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled...” Sam Kerr has turned my football world upside down. Credit: Getty Images I felt like watching something else. Actually, it was a no-brainer. And I was rewarded after just 12 minutes, with Sam Kerr threading the ball between the goalkeeper and three defenders to open the scoring for Chelsea. The game ended up 3-0, sending Chelsea to the top of the table. Why am I watching more women’s football than men’s these days? First, in the women’s game, players rarely roll around on the floor after being fouled, looking as though they’ve just been hit by a sniper’s bullet. Second, to the best of my knowledge, fans are not boorishly brawling in the stands and streets before, during and after games. Third, I have a football-fan-crush for the phenomenon that is Sam Kerr. Kerr is not just a footballer. She’s a dude. She’s a humanitarian. She’s got chutzpah; I mean, she hip-and-shouldered (AFL Style) a pitch invader during a Chelsea game against Juventus. This year, you’ll find her front and centre of the video game FIFA 23, the first time in the game’s 20-year history a woman has featured on the cover . And, like the rest of the Australian women’s team, she hangs back after every game, signing every shirt offered to her, giving her boots to girls who she inspires and smiling for every selfie with fans – win, lose or draw. Sam Kerr drops a pitch invader during Chelsea’s Champions League draw with Juventus. Beyond all this, though, Kerr is a rare football talent. Take, for example, her two goals on the final day of the 2021-22 WSL season for Chelsea against Manchester United in May. Chelsea were 1-2 down and had to win to clinch the title. They were heading for a loss, allowing Arsenal to win the League. Early in the second half, a ridiculously crafted Kerr volley from just outside the penalty box levelled the score, but that was nothing compared to the audacity of her second goal (Chelsea’s fourth) minutes later. Forget comparisons of the men’s v women’s game. By anyone’s standards Kerr is simply good. More than good. Sam Kerr is great. Not that she or the women’s game need my approval.","pubDate":"2022-11-21 02:07:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Video: See Izak Rankine’s first Crows training run","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/afl-2022-follow-all-the-adelaide-crows-as-the-crows-begin-preseason/news-story/e81c035bcf1943692bd7dd5905bb12a9","keywords":["Adelaide Crows","AFL","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Adelaide was one of 10 clubs to return to pre-season training on Monday, with all eyes on a high-profile recruit.","content":"Here are the big takeaways as the Crows hit the track.1. RANKINE WATCHHe was wearing the non-contact hat after off-season shoulder surgery, but Izak Rankine moved well and showed exciting signs on his first day of pre-season for the Crows. The former Gold Coast Sun looked to be in good condition and was even around the ball for periods in match simulation. He also got on the end of a couple of chains for goals and produced a fine volley goal during shooting practice.2. CROUCHING TIGER After no interest from other clubs during the trade period, Matt Crouch was with the Crows first to four year players on day one of pre-season. After an injury interrupted 2021, Crouch had a bit of a slower start to pre-season in 2022. He moved without issue during the session and got plenty of the footy during match sim. He was joined by Taylor Walker, Brodie Smith and Wayne Milera in returning earlier than expected. The players who played in SANFL finals are expected back next week, but that didn’t stop Kieran Strachan, Luke Pedlar, Lachlan Gollant, James Borlase and Josh Worrell from turning up to day one. 3. SKIPPER BUILDING Rory Sloane emerged from the gym halfway through the session and did some running drills. After tearing his ACL in round 5 the Crows captain moved well. He was joined by Ben Keays, Mitch Hinge, Sam Berry and Tariek Newchurch in training away from the main group. 4. CHAYCE IS ON FOR JONES AND SHOLLThe early pre-season is Lachie Sholl and Chayce Jones’ time to shine, and the pair continued their habit of being among the stronger Crows runners when the majority of players did some gruelling shuttles at the end of the session. Smith and Milera also looked strong. On the other end of the scale, second-year player Zac Taylor was in some serious trouble and he limped to the line. But he got plenty of encouragement from his teammates as he struggled. CROWS TOP-10 DRAFT PICK TAKES PERSONAL LEAVEFormer No.6 draft pick Fischer McAsey isn’t expected to start pre-season until after Christmas after Adelaide granted him personal leave. The Crows first to four-year players will begin pre-season on Monday, with boom recruit Izak Rankine expected to be at West Lakes as he recovers from shoulder surgery. Players who took part in the SANFL finals campaign have been given an extra week and will start their pre-season campaigns next Monday. McAsey was in that group but on the eve of pre-season the Crows announced that the 21-year-old had been granted personal leave. Crows Head of Football Adam Kelly said the club was understanding of McAsey’s circumstances and he was not expected to return until after the Christmas break.“We are fully supportive of Fischer taking personal leave and we will give him the time and space that he requires,” Kelly said.“We will remain in regular communication with him, as well as his management, to ensure he has ongoing support while away from the club.“As always, the welfare of our people is the top priority and we ask that Fischer’s privacy be respected during this period.”When he was selected with the sixth pick of the 2019 draft, McAsey was at the time the Crows’ highest ever draft pick. He played 10 games in his debut season, but hasn’t played at AFL level since. In the 2021 pre-season his father, Chris, had a major health scare while McAsey was back home in Melbourne for the first time in months due to coronavirus travel limitations. He signed a two-year contract extension in April 2021 after speculation that he would look for a move back to Victoria. He played 18 SANFL games last season and finished eighth in the Crows’ state-league best-and-fairest in 2021.But McAsey suffered another setback when he sustained a stress fracture in his femur in December 2021, which sidelined him for six weeks. When he returned via the SANFL he was shifted forward in an attempt by the Crows for him to find some form. He then revealed to TV crews that he had been in discussions about a move back to Melbourne. But nothing eventuated during the trade period and Crows list manager Justin Reid told News Corp in September that a full pre-season would do McAsey the world of good. “I guess being a high draft pick there is also high expectations, but we feel like we have the program around Fischer and his off-season and pre-season will dictate the season he has next year,” he said. But for the third year in a row McAsey will have an interrupted pre-season, ahead of the final year of his contract.","pubDate":"2022-11-21 01:50:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap: Minnesota Vikings vs. Dallas Cowboys","link":"https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-nfl-week-11-recap-minnesota-vikings-dallas-cowboys-2022/","keywords":null,"creator":["Nathan Jahnke"],"video_url":null,"description":"PFF's fantasy football recaps focus on player usage and stats, breaking down all the vital information you need to achieve fantasy success in 2022.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-21 01:40:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"pff","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap: Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cincinnati Bengals","link":"https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-nfl-week-11-recap-pittsburgh-steelers-cincinnati-bengals-2022/","keywords":null,"creator":["Nathan Jahnke"],"video_url":null,"description":"PFF's fantasy football recaps focus on player usage and stats, breaking down all the vital information you need to achieve fantasy success in 2022.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-21 01:31:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"pff","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap: Denver Broncos vs. Las Vegas Raiders","link":"https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-nfl-week-11-recap-denver-broncos-las-vegas-raiders-2022/","keywords":null,"creator":["Nathan Jahnke"],"video_url":null,"description":"PFF's fantasy football recaps focus on player usage and stats, breaking down all the vital information you need to achieve fantasy success in 2022.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-21 01:20:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"pff","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BYU football: Bowl-bound Cougars get late-season lift from powerful RB","link":"https://www.deseret.com/2022/11/20/23466729/byu-football-cougars-chris-brooks-cal-transfer-stanford-jaren-hall-pro-nfl-kickoff-time-saturday","keywords":null,"creator":["Jay Drew"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"After rushing for 102 yards on just 12 carries in BYU’s 52-26 win over Utah Tech on Saturday afternoon at LaVell Edwards Stadium, Cougars running back Chris Brooks will have even more on his plate this week, and it has nothing to do with Thanksgiving dinner. As a graduate-transfer from Cal, Brooks has the task of convincing the 6-5 and now bowl-eligible Cougars that 3-8 Stanford will be a tough test this Saturday in the regular-season finale at Stanford Stadium (9 p.m. MST, Fox Sports 1). “Very, very (excited),” Brooks said about the prospects of facing Cal’s biggest rival. “It’s back to the Bay.” Fullback Houston Heimuli is also extra fired-up for the matchup, considering he played for the Cardinal from 2017-2021 before becoming a graduate-transfer at BYU. Heimuli has appeared in all 11 games on special teams, but has yet to log a carry or a reception. Brooks returned to action against Utah Tech after missing the East Carolina and Boise State games with a hamstring injury. He leads the Cougars in rushing, having picked up 561 yards on 88 carries. Brooks’ 6.38 yards-per-carry average would be 17th in the country if he had enough carries to qualify. “It felt great,” Brooks said of Saturday’s performance in which he got one carry for 1 yard in the first half and 11 carries for 101 yards in the second half. “I always had faith and belief (that he would play again in 2022),” Brooks said. “I actually wanted to play (against) Boise. But it was just a matter of time and just being smart.” Brooks, who was known as Chris Brown for most of his time at Cal before he changed his last name to honor his mother, Raquel, was 2-2 against Stanford while playing in Berkeley. Last year, he had 13 carries for 131 yards in Cal’s 41-11 victory at Stanford Stadium. Cal edged Stanford 27-20 on Saturday in Berkeley in the 125th edition of the Big Game, overcoming a 17-6 deficit in the third quarter with three fourth-quarter touchdowns, including a 37-yard scoop and score by Jackson Sirmon. The Cardinal are merely playing out their schedule now, while the Cougars know they will be going bowling in December. But that doesn’t mean Stanford is not a dangerous and talented team, Heimuli and Brooks will be telling their teammates this week. For BYU, it is a chance to even its record with the Pac-12, after the Cougars fell 41-20 to now-No. 10 Oregon (9-2) back on Sept. 17. Quarterback Jaren Hall, who threw for a career-high 456 yards and five touchdowns against UT, said that BYU recovering from four straight losses in October to get bowl eligible shows the resiliency and character of the program. “You know, (we are) playing our hearts out for coach Kalani (Sitake), and everything he has built here. When you don’t have a perfect season, the season you expect, it really comes down to how you finish the season,” Hall said. “We can’t control what has happened to this point. We lost control of that. So now it is: what can we control? And that is the Stanford game next week, and that is the bowl game that follows.” Hall, Brooks and star receiver Puka Nacua all said Saturday that, regardless of whether they turn pro (in the cases of Hall and Nacua) or return to BYU in 2023, they will play in the bowl game and not joining the recent trend of NFL-bound players bypassing bowl games. “It just comes back to our character, willingness to strain and finish regardless of what we thought we deserved to begin with, or what we wanted to see happen in the end,” Hall said. “Now, you just have to do what you can, have the right perspective about things, because it will say a lot more about us, how we finished, than anything else. “So just respecting the game, respecting each other and Kalani and all he has done for us. Just approaching every game like it is the biggest one of our lives,” Hall continued. Against Utah Tech, Boise State hero Hinckley Ropati got the start and picked up 43 yards on 16 carries. Lopini Katoa fumbled on BYU’s second possession, and was pulled. Brooks took over in the second half and ran like a man possessed, refusing to go down and bowling over would-be tacklers. Brooks said he got a little emotional doing the senior walk, although he’s only been in Provo for 10 months. “I am not usually an emotional guy, but when it comes to this football stuff and it comes to not knowing when that last down is going to be, I would say yeah,” he said, acknowledging that Senior Day meant a lot to him. “… It really does teach you to never take any of these games for granted. Because when you get to that senior walk, and you are walking that field, everything just flashes before your eyes. I am just grateful.” BYU Cougars running back Hinckley Ropati (7) runs the ball during the game against the Utah Tech Trailblazers at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo on Saturday, Nov. 19, 2022.

Instead, Weber State could meet fellow Big Sky program Montana State in the second round if they win Saturday. When Weber State coach Jay Hill was asked about the Wildcats not earning a top 8 seed, he said there were several teams with a similar argument who also weren’t seeded. “The reality is, get in and now we’re all in the exact same boat — win and advance,” he told reporters Sunday, per a video posted on the team’s Twitter account. “You’re going to have to beat some really good teams to advance.

Weber State and North Dakota have one common opponent: the Wildcats beat Northern Arizona 33-31, while the Fighting Hawks beat the Lumberjacks 27-24.

FIFA on Sunday AEDT proposed a series of alternative armbands featuring different social campaigns in response to the plans from the rogue European teams.FIFA said in a statement its proposed armbands would promote social messages, including “Football unites the world” and “Share the meal” in a United Nations-backed campaign.The move puts football’s world governing body on a collision course with teams such as Germany, whose captain Manuel Neuer said he would still wear a “OneLove” armband to promote diversity and inclusion.“Other European nations are wearing (the armband) and it is good we are doing it together,” Neuer said on Saturday.Denmark’s Christian Eriksen said his country’s captain Simon Kjaer would be wearing the rainbow armband too, regardless of any disciplinary action taken by FIFA.“We as a country are wearing it, our captain will be wearing the OneLove armband,” Eriksen said.“What the consequences will be I don’t know, but we’ll see.” England’s Football Association are also believed to be ready to support the “OneLove” campaign regardless and are understood to be seeking clarity on whether the rainbow armband and the FIFA ones can be worn together.FIFA has turned down several reported requests for clarification on the situation but has remained silent on the issue. However, The Telegraph first reported FIFA has made a late call to outlaw the armbands. The report reveals there are private fears from some European countries that their captain could be booked as soon as they step on the pitch.The Associated Press reports the scope for any potential punishment would likely be limited to fines of 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,500).The armband dispute flared two months ago and does not seem even close to being resolved.Kane will be the guinea pig subject as the first European captain to wear the armband at the World Cup when England takes on Iran from 12am Tuesday AEDT. “I think we’ve made it clear that we want to wear it,” Kane said on Sunday in Doha. Welsh coach Rob Page also confirmed superstar Gareth Bale will wear a rainbow armband.Germany has been among the most vocal nation in committing to wearing the “One Love” armband. “We will stay with the European position,” German soccer federation president Bernd Neuendorf said this week. “FIFA came up with their own armband idea just two days ago. That was not acceptable for us.”Adelaide United star Josh Cavallo on Monday morning also spoke out against the hosting of the tournament in Qatar. Cavallo, the first active male professional footballer to publicly announce he is gay, said World Cup leaders have attacked the LGBTQ+ community. The Socceroos make their World Cup debut in Wednesday morning’s opener against France having also made a powerful protest against the host nation and its record of human rights abuses.","pubDate":"2022-11-21 00:02:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"NFL Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap: New Orleans Saints vs. Los Angeles Rams","link":"https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-nfl-week-11-recap-new-orleans-saints-los-angeles-rams-2022/","keywords":null,"creator":["Nathan Jahnke"],"video_url":null,"description":"PFF's fantasy football recaps focus on player usage and stats, breaking down all the vital information you need to achieve fantasy success in 2022.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-20 23:45:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"pff","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
