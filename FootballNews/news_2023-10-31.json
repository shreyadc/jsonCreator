İşte detaylar...","content":"FIFA’nın düzenlediği Avrupa’da Yılın Futbolcusu Ödülü olarak bilinen organizasyonda bir önceki senenin en iyi futbolcusu seçildi. Avrupa’nın en iyi futbolcusu, dünyanın her yerinden antrenörlerin ve uluslararası takım kaptanlarının yanı sıra gazetecilerin de kullandığı oylarla belirlendi. Ballon d'Or 2023'ün sahibi Inter Miami forması giyen ve Arjantin Milli Takımı ile Dünya Kupası'nı kaldırmış olan Lionel Messi oldu. Yıldız futbolcu, bu ödülle birlikte Ballon d'O'r'u 8. kez kazandı. France Football dergisinin düzenlediği törende yılın en iyi oyuncusu ödülünü bir dönem Galatasaray'da da forma giyen Didier Drogba takdim etti. Yılın en iyi forvetine verilen Gerd Müller Trophy'nin sahibi Erling Haaland oldu. 2023 Kadınlar Ballon d'Or ödülünü Barcelona'nın İspanyol futbolcusu Aitana Bonmati kazandı. Yılın genç oyuncusuna verilen Kopa Trophy ödülünün sahibi ise Jude Bellingham oldu. Bellingham, ödül sonrasında yaptığı açıklamada, \"Birmingham, Dortmund ve Real Madrid... Teşekkür ederim. Daha fazlası da gelecek.\" ifadelerini kullandı. İnsani Yardım Ödülü olarak bilinen Socrates Ödülü'nün sahibi Vinicius Junior oldu. Real Madrid'in yıldızı ödül sonrası, \"Brezilya'daki insanlara yardım ettiğim ve bu ödülü aldığım için çok mutluyum. Irkçılık, sporun üzerinde olan bir konu. Elimden geldiğince insanların bunun farkında olmasını istiyorum.\" dedi. Bu yıl 67'ncisi düzenlenen ödül töreninde birçok Avrupalı oyuncu kıtayı terk ederek Suudi Arabistan’a, Katar’a ve Amerika Birleşik Devletleri’ne transfer oldu. Messi, Fransız takımı Paris Saint-Germain’den MLS ekibi Inter Miami’ye, son Ballon d’Or kazananı Benzema ise Arabistan ekibi El-İttihad’a transfer oldu. Manchester United’dan Al Nassr’a transfer olduğundan bu yana Cristiano Ronaldo’nun Ballon d’Or’a aday gösterilmemesi, Avrupa’dan giden yıldız oyuncuların önümüzdeki yıllarda aday gösterilmeme ihtimaline işaret ediyor.

The Nine Network NRL commentator was filmed being restrained by up to four men at a time inside the Shoalhaven Heads Hotel on the NSW south coast on Friday night. Gallen had gone to the hotel with his radio colleague Mark Levy, who could be heard in the background shouting: 'Stop it. Enough, enough. Gal, stop' as the men battled to hold the 42-year-old NSW Origin legend and shocked drinkers watched on. Levy and Gallen work on 2GB's Continuous Call Team during the NRL season and the Cronulla Sharks premiership-winning captain contributes to Nine's Wide World of Sports. When Daily Mail Australia asked Gallen about the incident on Tuesday afternoon he initially said: 'I don't know what you're talking about'. Told there was footage of the brawl taken by witnesses, Gallen added, 'No worries', then asked: 'What are the witnesses saying happened?' Gallen and Levy arrived together at the pub, also known as The Heads, where the retired footballer played played pool in the beer garden and took to the dance floor. The fracas involving the married father-of-four, which was recorded on mobile phone cameras, took place about midnight as the pub was preparing to close. Witnesses claimed the fight began after Gallen lost a pool game and a cue was broken over a table. Several sources said Gallen was bleeding from the face after being punched in the nose, which some observers believed had been broken. Daily Mail Australia understands no one else was treated for any injuries. Footballer turned multimillion-dollar professional boxer Paul Gallen has been captured in a wild pub brawl in a coastal holiday town - and it looks like a local patron got the better of him The Nine Network NRL commentator was filmed being restrained by up to four men at the Shoalhaven Heads Hotel on the NSW south coast on Friday night When asked if he wished to comment on how witnesses had described the events Gallen said: 'Yeah mate, I won't make any comment on it.' 'If there's footage of it, then we'll see what happens. I've got nothing to say.' In a second video, a staff member is shown cleaning up the professional pugilist's nose with a cloth, while a concerned Levy watches on. When a man somewhere else in the pub says, 'Thinks he's mad', Gallen turns towards around and rushes towards the voice. The first video, which lasts 1 min and 29 seconds, starts with Gallen being held by three men and apparently throwing punches at one of them. In the background, a concerned Levy can be heard pleading: 'Enough. Enough, enough, enough. Stop it. Enough. Enough. Gal, stop.' As a scuffle rolls through the hotel another voice says: 'Get the f*** out now' before Gallen falls to the ground. 'Stop your mate,' someone says, amid the sound of breaking glass. Levy appears to say again, 'Stop, stop, enough. Gal, enough.' Gallen had gone to the hotel with his radio colleague Mark Levy, who could be heard in the background shouting: 'Stop it. Enough. Enough. Gal, stop' The fracas involving the married father-of-four, which was recorded by mobile phone, took place about midnight as the pub was preparing to close One patron can be heard saying, 'He's bleeding everywhere' as Gallen gets to his feet. Another voice says, 'Get out of here'. Two men then push a third singlet-wearing man away from the melee and Levy appears to say, 'No more, Gal. No more. No more. No more. Stop.' There is no suggestion Levy, who regularly fills in for Ray Hadley on his 2GB morning show, did anything wrong, and footage confirms he attempted to prevent Gallen causing further trouble. Levy, who a friend confirmed would have acted as peacemaker, has been contacted for comment. Daily Mail Australia understands Gallen and Levy had been staying at Currarong, a 50-minute drive away, and arrived at the pub on the hotel's courtesy bus. Police did not attend the pub after the incident and Gallen and Levy are believed to have returned to their accommodation via the same 12-seater transport. Levy has in the past posted on social media about visiting the pub. Management at The Heads was contacted for comment. Gallen (left) and Levy (right) work on 2GB's Continuous Call Team during the NRL season and the Cronulla Sharks premiership-winning captain contributes to Nine's Wide World of Sports Daily Mail Australia understands Gallen and Levy had been staying at Currarong, a 50-minute drive from The Heads (above), and arrived on the pub's courtesy bus Gallen played 19 seasons of first grade with the Cronulla Sharks and captained the team to the club's first premiership in 2016. He appeared 24 times for NSW and skippered the side which won the 2014 State of Origin series which broke Queensland 's eight-year winning streak. For much of his interstate playing career Gallen was regarded by Maroons fans - who he had once labelled 'two heads' - as their number one enemy. In 2014, Gallen was among Cronulla players who admitted to unknowingly using a banned peptide in exchange for a reduced and backdated ban. Gallen took up boxing in 2012 and has won 15 of 18 bouts as a heavyweight, including wins over Lucas Browne and Mark Hunt. Last year he said he had made $25million from the sport . Gallen retired from the NRL in 2018 as the game's oldest player and since then has been employed by Nine on programs including the Sunday Footy Show, Sport Sunday and 100% Footy. Levy was been with 2GB since 2007, after spending more than six years as a producer and reporter with Sky Racing.

Et un an après son dernier match, il a assuré et rassuré, avec deux grosses parades en première mi-temps devant Abdelli (18e) et Diony (25e). Décisif ! APPIAH (6) Très bon lors de la victoire à Laval (1-0), l'ancien nantais a confirmé son retour en forme. Solide défensivement, il n'a pas hésité à se projeter. BRIANCON (6) Les Verts restaient sur 5 clean sheets et ils en ont enchaîné un 6e. Leur capitaine a encore été exemplaire, avec notamment un joli tacle glissé devant Diony (51e). NADE (5,5) Le robuste gaucher a profité de la blessure de Batubinsika pour jouer à nouveau les utilités. En manque de rythme, il a eu un peu de mal à entrer dans son match. Mais il est monté en puissance et a rendu une bonne copie. PETROT (8) Fidèle au poste, il enchaîne. Et cette fois, il a été carrément épatant, avec un sauvetage sur sa ligne devant Diony qui s'apprêtait à pousser le ballon dans les filets (35e), puis un but, du droit, pour faire le break, en s'arrachant. Le symbole de cette ASSE généreuse, c'est lui ! Le grand 8 pour Sissoko TARDIEU (6,5) Depuis son arrivée, les Verts ne perdent plus. Et il est de mieux en mieux. Il jaillit, il oriente. Il s'installe et bonifie de plus en plus le collectif. RIVERA (5,5), puis MONCONDUIT Milieu droit, Rivera n'a pas été avare d'efforts. Il a pressé et il a proposé, à défaut d'avoir fait des différences. Remplacé par MONCONDUIT, auteur d'un énorme tacle glissé sur lequel il s'est blessé (90e)... FOMBA (6), puis MOUEFFEK Auteur d'une bonne remise pour Bouchouari, Fomba a été précieux dans l'entrejeu, à la récupération comme à la construction. Relayé par MOUEFFEK, qui a apporté sa puissance. BOUCHOUARI (6), puis LOBRY Bouchouari a raté le cadre de peu sur une frappe enroulée après une belle incursion (39e). Il est allé de l'avant et a été agressif à la récupération du ballon. Remplacé par LOBRY, qui s'est mis au diapason. CAFARO (5,5), puis BENTAYG Cafaro a eu quelques fulgurances. Il aurait pu marquer si sa reprise n'avait pas été contrée par Sissoko (23e)... Et c'est lui qui a déposé le corner sur la tête de Sissoko, sur l'ouverture du score. Remplacé par BENTAYG, dangereux par sa vitesse. SISSOKO (6), puis CHARBONNIER Sissoko a été le premier à solliciter Fofana (5e, 30e). Malheureux sur cette action où il empêche Cafaro de marquer (23e), il s'est racheté en ouvrant le score de la tête. Son 8e but de la saison a montré la voie et permis à l'ASSE d'aller chercher sa plus belle victoire de ce début de saison. Remplacé par CHARBONNIER, qui n'a pas réussi à s'illustrer. function getDimensionGA() { var dimension1 = \"144\"; return dimension1; } var logora_config = { shortname: \"horyzon-f09581\", debate: { identifier: \"16-838938\" }, source: { source_url: \"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/actualite/asse-green-reussit-son-retour-sissoko-marque-encore-petrot-doublement-decisif-les-notes-des-verts-contre-angers-838938\", uid: \"16-838938\", title: \"ASSE : Green réussit son retour, Sissoko marque encore, Pétrot doublement décisif... les notes des Verts contre Angers\", description: \"L'ASSE recevait Angers en clôture de la 12e journée de L2.

Djokovic - who is in the city for the Paris Masters and was spotted in the crowd during the recent - was asked to read out the winner of the women’s Ballon d’Or - which went to Spanish world champion Aitana Bonmati. But the whole moment just became awkward for various reasons. First, Djokovic was asked about his own levels of football interest and proceeded to talk about his father being a professional player and how he had to choose between tennis and football as youngster. He’s not going to crack a gag about ‘making the right choice’, is he? Oh no .... “I think I was around nine or 10 years old and I was deciding if I was going to play football or tennis,” Djokovic told the crowd. “So I chose tennis, I don’t know if it was a good choice ... I think it was.” There was some polite applause but it’s fair to say the room didn’t erupt with laughter. Then, Bonmati graced the stage after her name was called out, but more awkward scenes followed. As Bonmati moved the mic and looked at her speech notes, the trophy was nowhere in sight and the star of the show looked less than impressed. Host Sandy Heribert was quick to notice things weren’t right and jumped in: “We’re going to give you the Ballon d’Or, of course.” Eventually, Bonmati was handed the trophy and Heribert again declared her the winner of the Ballon d’Or and asked the crowd to applaud again. The awards had already been heavily criticised because many star players, such as Australia’s Sam Kerr, could not make it due to international duties. And after the event, ABC football writer Samantha Lewis called out the various issues. “So, to summarise: 1) the ceremony was held during a women’s (international) window so most nominees couldn’t attend. 2) the women who WERE there got blanked by a male performer. 3) there’s no women’s equivalent of the Yashin trophy. 4) the biggest award was presented by a dude from... tennis?” She added: “The multiple layers of disrespect really is quite stunning. And all of them were active choices made by the people who run this thing.” Arsenal women correspondent Tim Stillman also found the presence of Djokovic strange. “Nothing says ‘celebrate the achievement of female athletes’ like inviting a male athlete who advocated against equal pay to talk about himself and the completely different sport he plays,” Stillman wrote. “They didn’t even have the actual award on stage for Bonmati when she got to the podium. Someone from backstage had to go and get it.” Fans and journalists were shocked by the fact that the trophy wasn’t ready. Journalist Sam Munnery said: “Almost the coup de grace of insults really - no one even thought to have the trophy out of the box so it eventually just gets shoved into her hands by the backstage bloke. Messi gets his presented by Beckham.” And a fan said: “To add insult to injury, it appears they all forgot to give her the trophy. Ooops. What a joke.” And another: “No one looks very happy about any of it.” Another punter called out the discrepancy between the men and women’s awards. “No U21 female player. No Top Female goal scorer. No Female Goalkeeper. Let’s get Serena or Steffi (Graf) to present Messi. JOKE!” they blasted on social media,” they said.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:15:30","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12386127/c8feccf815ab4b4b9bd0dc35627993cbe34f2f12-16x9-x0y2w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"364e3756d181efe848d27100c2638391","title":"Bonmatí recibe premio femenino","link":"https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/deportes/bonmati-recibe-premio-femenino/20231031000852925871.html","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":["REDACCIÓN"],"video_url":null,"description":"Aitana Bonmatí fue reconocida ayer con el Balón de Oro femenino, durante la gala de France Football en París.

La jugadora completó así una memorable temporada en la que con el FC Barcelona ganó la Liga Española, la Champions y la Supercopa. Sin dudas, su mejor momento llegó con el Mundial femenino que logró con España tras derrotar 1-0 a Inglaterra en la final. Bonmatí ya había ganado el premio UEFA a la mejor futbolista del Viejo Continente. La catalana ha destacado con luz propia y ha sido fundamental para que el Barça recibiera el premio al mejor club del mundo en el fútbol femenino. En varones, ese galardón se lo ha llevado el Manchester City. Emiliano Martínez, vital para Argentina en Catar 2022, fue acreedor del premio Lev Yashin al mejor arquero de este año. Por otro lado, el noruego Erling Haaland recibió el premio Gerd Müller al goleador de la gestión, ya que acumuló 56 festejos entre el Citizen y la selección noruega para ese galardón. El inglés Jude Bellingham, clave para que Real Madrid le ganara (1-2) al FC Barcelona en el clásico español, ha sido reconocido con el premio Kopa al futbolista más destacado, menor de 21 años. Vinicius Junior ha recibido el premio Sócrates por su obra social. Los Balones de Oro (masculino y femenino) recorrieron las calles de París antes de llegar al lugar de la ceremonia.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:08:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"opinionbo","source_priority":450813,"country":["bolivia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"ad2e4a9ab414becafe5b117b18ba08d2","title":"Leo dedica su octavo Balón de Oro ‘al Diego’","link":"https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/deportes/leo-dedica-octavo-balon-oro-diego/20231031000746925869.html","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":["ANDRÉS PACHECO PINTO"],"video_url":null,"description":"El Diez, fallecido en noviembre de 2020, habría cumplido 63 años ayer en lo que fue una jornada emotiva para Messi durante la gala en París.","content":"En una jornada emotiva, por el que habría sido el cumpleaños 63 de Diego Armando Maradona (fallecido en noviembre de 2020), Lionel Messi le dedicó ayer el octavo Balón de Oro de su carrera. Así lo manifestó el rosarino durante su discurso después de que la France Football le entregara el esperado galardón. “Quiero hacerle una mención a Diego. No hay mejor lugar para desearle un feliz cumpleaños, rodeado de gente que le gusta el fútbol, como le gustaba a él. Donde quiera que estés, feliz cumpleaños. Esto también es para vos”, expresó Messi. El actual jugador del Inter Miami de la MLS quedó por delante de Erling Haaland (goleador y figura del Manchester City) y Kylian Mbappé. Pese a que el noruego fue el máximo artillero de la Premier y la Champions (ambos títulos ganados por el Citizen), el futbolista argentino lo superó. Messi fue el capitán de Argentina en la consagración de la Copa del Mundo Catar 2022, la tercera estrella de su historia. Mbappé, de destacada labor con Francia en el torneo FIFA, ocupó la tercera plaza en la votación. Messi aportó con siete goles en la campaña de la Albiceleste que volvió a gritar campeón mundial por primera vez desde México 1986, donde había brillado Maradona. Aquel lauro se sumó también al conquistado en 1978, cuando el vecino país fue el anfitrión del evento mayor del deporte rey. Messi, además, agradeció nuevamente a su familia y compañeros de equipo. Asimismo, reconoció a Haaland y Mbappé como “figuras con hambre de gloria”. La ceremonia acabó con aplausos.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:07:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"opinionbo","source_priority":450813,"country":["bolivia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"bd063db656aa7618a8a24180681349e1","title":"Stade Rennais : confiance ou inconscience, le discours surréaliste du vestiaire rennais","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/stade-rennais/actualite/stade-rennais-confiance-ou-inconscience-le-discours-surrealiste-du-vestiaire-rennais-838896","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Auteur d'un match nul hier sur sa pelouse contre le RC Strasbourg (1-1), le Stade Rennais inquiète dans le jeu et reste englué au milieu de tableau.

The Lions jumped out to a 9-0 first-half lead after three field goals from Riley Patterson, and they never trailed as their defense shut down the Raiders and sacked Las Vegas quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo six times. The Raiders' only offensive touchdown was a Josh Jacobs three-yard run in the second quarter, before Marcus Peters returned an interception for a 75-yard touchdown in the third quarter. 'When your defense plays that good, you can overcome that,' head coach Dan Campbell said. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff passed for 272 yards and a touchdown while running back Jahmyr Gibbs added 152 yards on the ground (plus a score). Jared Goff threw for 272 yards and a touchdown as the Lions took care of business at home Amon-Ra St. Brown tallied six catches for 108 yards - his fifth 100-yard game of the season Davante Adams was visibly frustrated on the Raiders bench. pic.twitter.com/8wIEyZJleu — ESPN (@espn) October 31, 2023 'We wanted to get Gibbs going,' Campbell said. 'You could tell he was feeling it.' 'He's a very talented player with a very dynamic skill set, 'embattled coach Josh McDaniels said of Gibbs. Wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown had six catches for 108 yards - his fifth 100-yard game of the season already. Detroit is now just one game behind the NFL's best record in the Eagles (7-1), while they're level with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Ravens and Jaguars as well. Dating back to last season, they've won a staggering 14 of their last 18 games. And after they snuck into the playoffs last season, the postseason looks to be on the cards again as they have a two-game lead in the NFC North. The Raiders, meanwhile, fell to 3-5 as star receiver Davante Adams was frustrated to the tune of just one catch for 11 yards. Goff was intercepted by Marcus Peters for a 75-yard pick-six in the third quarter of the game He was seen slamming his helmet on the sideline late in the fourth quarter. 'I thought we did have some opportunities to make more plays on offense than we did, but we didn't make them,' McDaniels said. 'We just couldn't string together each enough plays in the passing game.' The Raiders will face the Giants on Sunday, while the Lions head into a bye.

Bernardo exhibited brilliant form throughout the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and provided the assist for Erling Haaland and the club’s second goal and was voted man of the match, despite team-mate Haaland scoring twice and assisting another. ADVERTISEMENT ‘No tattoos, no cars’ Following the match, Guardiola was effusive in his praise of the Portuguese international, commending the player for his adaptability, astuteness, and his simple lifestyle away from the field. “He doesn’t have any tattoos or a nice car—he is an incredible player for us. He loves to play at Old Trafford. He’s played as false 9 in the past and he has the ability to make a lot of passes,” said Guardiola. “He is so intelligent—everyone loves him, and it was another exceptional performance. He’s one of the best players I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve trained a lot and he’s one of the best,” he added. Haaland scored two goals and created another as Manchester City won over Manchester United. The Norwegian netted a first-half penalty and completed his double with a header shortly after the break, before setting up Phil Foden for a third as City closed the gap on leaders Tottenham Hotspur to two points. The City boss was delighted by his team’s performance against the Reds, and pinpointed Haaland’s second strike as a key moment in the game. “The second goal helped us a lot. We talked at half-time and thought they would be more aggressive. We made two incredible build-ups with Ruben and Ederson. After we dropped and after Bernardo and Jack made a good action and those were the key points of the game. ‘Special win at Old Trafford’ “The first seven minutes we lost the ball because we didn’t do simple things. We allowed them to make a transition. The second half was brilliant. Last season we lost, this season we won, and it is always special to win at Old Trafford,” he said. Guardiola’s side are third on point table with 24 points, level with Arsenal.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 03:18:08","image_url":"https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2023/oct/Bernado-ka_d.jpg","source_id":"mid_day","source_priority":4893,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"011e5ca3118a9b8baf3f21c8354c7fa9","title":"Carlton recruit Elijah Hollands pleads guilty to possessing cocaine after leaving wallet in Star casino toilets","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/afl/carlton-recruit-elijah-hollands-pleads-guilty-to-possessing-cocaine-after-leaving-wallet-in-star-casino-toilets-c-12386997","keywords":null,"creator":["Warren Barnsley"],"video_url":null,"description":"The AFL player has learned his fate in court after a slip-up in a casino toilet.","content":"recruit Elijah Hollands left his wallet in the toilets of a Gold Coast casino — and its contents landed him in trouble with the law and his new club. Hollands, 21, pleaded guilty to at The Star in Broadbeach on September 3. His lawyer told the court his offending had come while his mother was at “death’s door” from illness. Security guards found the wallet containing his ID cards and less than a gram of white powder inside. The drugs were seized by police and Hollands was interviewed by officers, before being charged. He was slapped with a two-month good behaviour bond and ordered to attend a drug education session on Tuesday. He avoided having a conviction recorded. “I’d like thank the magistrate for their time this morning,” Hollands said outside court. “I made a mistake that I’m extremely remorseful for. “It’s not only impacted me, but my family as well. “I’d like to thank both the Carlton footy club and the Gold Coast Suns for their continued support over the last few weeks. Thank you.” Carlton are yet to issue a statement on the court outcome, but similar incidents have resulted in two-match bans by the AFL. Hollands’ charge was made public on October 19 — the day after Gold Coast traded him to the Blues. Carlton revealed it knew about the charge when they recruited him. “The club was notified last month by Hollands, who was a Gold Coast Suns player at the time, given its existing interest in bringing him to the football club,” the club said in a statement. “An informed decision was then made to proceed with the recruitment, and the club will now provide the necessary support to Hollands. “He will commence pre-season training upon its scheduled resumption in November.” Hollands, the No.7 pick from the 2020 national draft, played just 14 games for Gold Coast and was keen to join his younger brother Ollie at the Blues. The AFL Integrity Unit is aware of the Hollands situation and has been conducting its own investigation. His defence lawyer Darren Mahony said while not an excuse, Hollands’ offending has occurred as his mother is seriously ill and is now “at death’s door”. “Sometimes a young man with otherwise exemplary character, a good family and a bright future does something foolish,” Mahony said. “And that’s what’s happened here with Mr Hollands. “Other members of his family are prominent sportsmen, so to be facing this charge is embarrassing to him. He feels as though he’s let himself down, his family down and also his respective clubs.” Hollands’ father Ben played for Richmond in the AFL and West Adelaide in the SANFL.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 02:46:43","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12386997/426c747e824dd1f70d1b5f5d84703028d37b1b44-16x9-x0y20w800h450.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"be25da7f12a7f6971fc845f1f42a8158","title":"Son dakika: FIFA Ballon d'Or'un sahibi Lionel Messi oldu!

Avrupa’nın en iyi futbolcusu, dünyanın her yerinden antrenörlerin ve uluslararası takım kaptanlarının yanı sıra gazetecilerin de kullandığı oylarla belirlendi. Ballon d'Or 2023'ün sahibi Inter Miami forması giyen ve Arjantin Milli Takımı ile Dünya Kupası'nı kaldırmış olan Lionel Messi oldu. Yıldız futbolcu, bu ödülle birlikte Ballon d'O'r'u 8. kez kazandı. France Football dergisinin düzenlediği törende yılın en iyi oyuncusu ödülünü bir dönem Galatasaray'da da forma giyen Didier Drogba takdim etti. Yılın en iyi forvetine verilen Gerd Müller Trophy'nin sahibi Erling Haaland oldu. 2023 Kadınlar Ballon d'Or ödülünü Barcelona'nın İspanyol futbolcusu Aitana Bonmati kazandı. Yılın genç oyuncusuna verilen Kopa Trophy ödülünün sahibi ise Jude Bellingham oldu. Bellingham, ödül sonrasında yaptığı açıklamada, \"Birmingham, Dortmund ve Real Madrid... Teşekkür ederim. Daha fazlası da gelecek.\" ifadelerini kullandı. İnsani Yardım Ödülü olarak bilinen Socrates Ödülü'nün sahibi Vinicius Junior oldu.

The Nine Network NRL commentator was filmed being restrained by up to four men at a time inside the Shoalhaven Heads Hotel on the NSW south coast on Friday night. Gallen had gone to the hotel with his radio colleague Mark Levy, who could be heard in the background shouting: 'Stop it. Enough, enough. Gal, stop' as the men battled to hold the 42-year-old NSW Origin legend and shocked drinkers watched on. Levy and Gallen work on 2GB's Continuous Call Team during the NRL season and the Cronulla Sharks premiership-winning captain contributes to Nine's Wide World of Sports. When Daily Mail Australia asked Gallen about the incident on Tuesday afternoon he initially said: 'I don't know what you're talking about'. Told there was footage of the brawl taken by witnesses, Gallen added, 'No worries', then asked: 'What are the witnesses saying happened?' Gallen and Levy arrived together at the pub, also known as The Heads, where the retired footballer played played pool in the beer garden and took to the dance floor. The fracas involving the married father-of-four, which was recorded on mobile phone cameras, took place about midnight as the pub was preparing to close. Witnesses claimed the fight began after Gallen lost a pool game and a cue was broken over a table. Several sources said Gallen was bleeding from the face after being punched in the nose, which some observers believed had been broken. Daily Mail Australia understands no one else was treated for any injuries. Footballer turned multimillion-dollar professional boxer Paul Gallen has been captured in a wild pub brawl in a coastal holiday town - and it looks like a local patron got the better of him The Nine Network NRL commentator was filmed being restrained by up to four men at the Shoalhaven Heads Hotel on the NSW south coast on Friday night When asked if he wished to comment on how witnesses had described the events Gallen said: 'Yeah mate, I won't make any comment on it.' 'If there's footage of it, then we'll see what happens. I've got nothing to say.' In a second video, a staff member is shown cleaning up the professional pugilist's nose with a cloth, while a concerned Levy watches on. When a man somewhere else in the pub says, 'Thinks he's mad', Gallen turns towards around and rushes towards the voice. The first video, which lasts 1 min and 29 seconds, starts with Gallen being held by three men and apparently throwing punches at one of them. In the background, a concerned Levy can be heard pleading: 'Enough. Enough, enough, enough. Stop it. Enough. Enough. Gal, stop.' As a scuffle rolls through the hotel another voice says: 'Get the f*** out now' before Gallen falls to the ground. 'Stop your mate,' someone says, amid the sound of breaking glass. Levy appears to say again, 'Stop, stop, enough. Gal, enough.' Gallen had gone to the hotel with his radio colleague Mark Levy, who could be heard in the background shouting: 'Stop it. Enough. Enough. Gal, stop' The fracas involving the married father-of-four, which was recorded by mobile phone, took place about midnight as the pub was preparing to close One patron can be heard saying, 'He's bleeding everywhere' as Gallen gets to his feet. Another voice says, 'Get out of here'. Two men then push a third singlet-wearing man away from the melee and Levy appears to say, 'No more, Gal. No more. No more. No more. Stop.' There is no suggestion Levy, who regularly fills in for Ray Hadley on his 2GB morning show, did anything wrong, and footage confirms he attempted to prevent Gallen causing further trouble. Levy, who a friend confirmed would have acted as peacemaker, has been contacted for comment. Daily Mail Australia understands Gallen and Levy had been staying at Currarong, a 50-minute drive away, and arrived at the pub on the hotel's courtesy bus. Police did not attend the pub after the incident and Gallen and Levy are believed to have returned to their accommodation via the same 12-seater transport. Levy has in the past posted on social media about visiting the pub. Management at The Heads was contacted for comment. Gallen (left) and Levy (right) work on 2GB's Continuous Call Team during the NRL season and the Cronulla Sharks premiership-winning captain contributes to Nine's Wide World of Sports Daily Mail Australia understands Gallen and Levy had been staying at Currarong, a 50-minute drive from The Heads (above), and arrived on the pub's courtesy bus Gallen played 19 seasons of first grade with the Cronulla Sharks and captained the team to the club's first premiership in 2016. He appeared 24 times for NSW and skippered the side which won the 2014 State of Origin series which broke Queensland 's eight-year winning streak. For much of his interstate playing career Gallen was regarded by Maroons fans - who he had once labelled 'two heads' - as their number one enemy. In 2014, Gallen was among Cronulla players who admitted to unknowingly using a banned peptide in exchange for a reduced and backdated ban. Gallen took up boxing in 2012 and has won 15 of 18 bouts as a heavyweight, including wins over Lucas Browne and Mark Hunt. Last year he said he had made $25million from the sport . Gallen retired from the NRL in 2018 as the game's oldest player and since then has been employed by Nine on programs including the Sunday Footy Show, Sport Sunday and 100% Footy. Levy was been with 2GB since 2007, after spending more than six years as a producer and reporter with Sky Racing.

APPIAH (6) Très bon lors de la victoire à Laval (1-0), l'ancien nantais a confirmé son retour en forme. Solide défensivement, il n'a pas hésité à se projeter. BRIANCON (6) Les Verts restaient sur 5 clean sheets et ils en ont enchaîné un 6e. Leur capitaine a encore été exemplaire, avec notamment un joli tacle glissé devant Diony (51e). NADE (5,5) Le robuste gaucher a profité de la blessure de Batubinsika pour jouer à nouveau les utilités. En manque de rythme, il a eu un peu de mal à entrer dans son match. Mais il est monté en puissance et a rendu une bonne copie. PETROT (8) Fidèle au poste, il enchaîne. Et cette fois, il a été carrément épatant, avec un sauvetage sur sa ligne devant Diony qui s'apprêtait à pousser le ballon dans les filets (35e), puis un but, du droit, pour faire le break, en s'arrachant. Le symbole de cette ASSE généreuse, c'est lui ! Le grand 8 pour Sissoko TARDIEU (6,5) Depuis son arrivée, les Verts ne perdent plus. Et il est de mieux en mieux. Il jaillit, il oriente.

BOUCHOUARI (6), puis LOBRY Bouchouari a raté le cadre de peu sur une frappe enroulée après une belle incursion (39e). Il est allé de l'avant et a été agressif à la récupération du ballon. Remplacé par LOBRY, qui s'est mis au diapason. CAFARO (5,5), puis BENTAYG Cafaro a eu quelques fulgurances. Il aurait pu marquer si sa reprise n'avait pas été contrée par Sissoko (23e)... Et c'est lui qui a déposé le corner sur la tête de Sissoko, sur l'ouverture du score. Remplacé par BENTAYG, dangereux par sa vitesse. SISSOKO (6), puis CHARBONNIER Sissoko a été le premier à solliciter Fofana (5e, 30e). Malheureux sur cette action où il empêche Cafaro de marquer (23e), il s'est racheté en ouvrant le score de la tête. Son 8e but de la saison a montré la voie et permis à l'ASSE d'aller chercher sa plus belle victoire de ce début de saison.

Djokovic - who is in the city for the Paris Masters and was spotted in the crowd during the recent - was asked to read out the winner of the women’s Ballon d’Or - which went to Spanish world champion Aitana Bonmati. But the whole moment just became awkward for various reasons. First, Djokovic was asked about his own levels of football interest and proceeded to talk about his father being a professional player and how he had to choose between tennis and football as youngster. He’s not going to crack a gag about ‘making the right choice’, is he? Oh no .... “I think I was around nine or 10 years old and I was deciding if I was going to play football or tennis,” Djokovic told the crowd. “So I chose tennis, I don’t know if it was a good choice ... I think it was.” There was some polite applause but it’s fair to say the room didn’t erupt with laughter. Then, Bonmati graced the stage after her name was called out, but more awkward scenes followed. As Bonmati moved the mic and looked at her speech notes, the trophy was nowhere in sight and the star of the show looked less than impressed. Host Sandy Heribert was quick to notice things weren’t right and jumped in: “We’re going to give you the Ballon d’Or, of course.” Eventually, Bonmati was handed the trophy and Heribert again declared her the winner of the Ballon d’Or and asked the crowd to applaud again. The awards had already been heavily criticised because many star players, such as Australia’s Sam Kerr, could not make it due to international duties. And after the event, ABC football writer Samantha Lewis called out the various issues. “So, to summarise: 1) the ceremony was held during a women’s (international) window so most nominees couldn’t attend. 2) the women who WERE there got blanked by a male performer. 3) there’s no women’s equivalent of the Yashin trophy. 4) the biggest award was presented by a dude from... tennis?” She added: “The multiple layers of disrespect really is quite stunning. And all of them were active choices made by the people who run this thing.” Arsenal women correspondent Tim Stillman also found the presence of Djokovic strange. “Nothing says ‘celebrate the achievement of female athletes’ like inviting a male athlete who advocated against equal pay to talk about himself and the completely different sport he plays,” Stillman wrote. “They didn’t even have the actual award on stage for Bonmati when she got to the podium. Someone from backstage had to go and get it.” Fans and journalists were shocked by the fact that the trophy wasn’t ready. Journalist Sam Munnery said: “Almost the coup de grace of insults really - no one even thought to have the trophy out of the box so it eventually just gets shoved into her hands by the backstage bloke. Messi gets his presented by Beckham.” And a fan said: “To add insult to injury, it appears they all forgot to give her the trophy. Ooops. What a joke.” And another: “No one looks very happy about any of it.” Another punter called out the discrepancy between the men and women’s awards. “No U21 female player. No Top Female goal scorer. No Female Goalkeeper. Let’s get Serena or Steffi (Graf) to present Messi. JOKE!” they blasted on social media,” they said.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:15:30","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12386127/c8feccf815ab4b4b9bd0dc35627993cbe34f2f12-16x9-x0y2w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"364e3756d181efe848d27100c2638391","title":"Bonmatí recibe premio femenino","link":"https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/deportes/bonmati-recibe-premio-femenino/20231031000852925871.html","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":["REDACCIÓN"],"video_url":null,"description":"Aitana Bonmatí fue reconocida ayer con el Balón de Oro femenino, durante la gala de France Football en París.

La jugadora completó así una memorable temporada en la que con el FC Barcelona ganó la Liga Española, la Champions y la Supercopa. Sin dudas, su mejor momento llegó con el Mundial femenino que logró con España tras derrotar 1-0 a Inglaterra en la final. Bonmatí ya había ganado el premio UEFA a la mejor futbolista del Viejo Continente. La catalana ha destacado con luz propia y ha sido fundamental para que el Barça recibiera el premio al mejor club del mundo en el fútbol femenino. En varones, ese galardón se lo ha llevado el Manchester City. Emiliano Martínez, vital para Argentina en Catar 2022, fue acreedor del premio Lev Yashin al mejor arquero de este año. Por otro lado, el noruego Erling Haaland recibió el premio Gerd Müller al goleador de la gestión, ya que acumuló 56 festejos entre el Citizen y la selección noruega para ese galardón. El inglés Jude Bellingham, clave para que Real Madrid le ganara (1-2) al FC Barcelona en el clásico español, ha sido reconocido con el premio Kopa al futbolista más destacado, menor de 21 años. Vinicius Junior ha recibido el premio Sócrates por su obra social. Los Balones de Oro (masculino y femenino) recorrieron las calles de París antes de llegar al lugar de la ceremonia.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:08:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"opinionbo","source_priority":450813,"country":["bolivia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"ad2e4a9ab414becafe5b117b18ba08d2","title":"Leo dedica su octavo Balón de Oro ‘al Diego’","link":"https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/deportes/leo-dedica-octavo-balon-oro-diego/20231031000746925869.html","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":["ANDRÉS PACHECO PINTO"],"video_url":null,"description":"El Diez, fallecido en noviembre de 2020, habría cumplido 63 años ayer en lo que fue una jornada emotiva para Messi durante la gala en París.","content":"En una jornada emotiva, por el que habría sido el cumpleaños 63 de Diego Armando Maradona (fallecido en noviembre de 2020), Lionel Messi le dedicó ayer el octavo Balón de Oro de su carrera. Así lo manifestó el rosarino durante su discurso después de que la France Football le entregara el esperado galardón. “Quiero hacerle una mención a Diego. No hay mejor lugar para desearle un feliz cumpleaños, rodeado de gente que le gusta el fútbol, como le gustaba a él. Donde quiera que estés, feliz cumpleaños. Esto también es para vos”, expresó Messi. El actual jugador del Inter Miami de la MLS quedó por delante de Erling Haaland (goleador y figura del Manchester City) y Kylian Mbappé. Pese a que el noruego fue el máximo artillero de la Premier y la Champions (ambos títulos ganados por el Citizen), el futbolista argentino lo superó. Messi fue el capitán de Argentina en la consagración de la Copa del Mundo Catar 2022, la tercera estrella de su historia. Mbappé, de destacada labor con Francia en el torneo FIFA, ocupó la tercera plaza en la votación. Messi aportó con siete goles en la campaña de la Albiceleste que volvió a gritar campeón mundial por primera vez desde México 1986, donde había brillado Maradona. Aquel lauro se sumó también al conquistado en 1978, cuando el vecino país fue el anfitrión del evento mayor del deporte rey. Messi, además, agradeció nuevamente a su familia y compañeros de equipo. Asimismo, reconoció a Haaland y Mbappé como “figuras con hambre de gloria”. La ceremonia acabó con aplausos.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:07:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"opinionbo","source_priority":450813,"country":["bolivia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"bd063db656aa7618a8a24180681349e1","title":"Stade Rennais : confiance ou inconscience, le discours surréaliste du vestiaire rennais","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/stade-rennais/actualite/stade-rennais-confiance-ou-inconscience-le-discours-surrealiste-du-vestiaire-rennais-838896","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Auteur d'un match nul hier sur sa pelouse contre le RC Strasbourg (1-1), le Stade Rennais inquiète dans le jeu et reste englué au milieu de tableau.

The Lions jumped out to a 9-0 first-half lead after three field goals from Riley Patterson, and they never trailed as their defense shut down the Raiders and sacked Las Vegas quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo six times. The Raiders' only offensive touchdown was a Josh Jacobs three-yard run in the second quarter, before Marcus Peters returned an interception for a 75-yard touchdown in the third quarter. 'When your defense plays that good, you can overcome that,' head coach Dan Campbell said. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff passed for 272 yards and a touchdown while running back Jahmyr Gibbs added 152 yards on the ground (plus a score). Jared Goff threw for 272 yards and a touchdown as the Lions took care of business at home Amon-Ra St. Brown tallied six catches for 108 yards - his fifth 100-yard game of the season Davante Adams was visibly frustrated on the Raiders bench. pic.twitter.com/8wIEyZJleu — ESPN (@espn) October 31, 2023 'We wanted to get Gibbs going,' Campbell said. 'You could tell he was feeling it.' 'He's a very talented player with a very dynamic skill set, 'embattled coach Josh McDaniels said of Gibbs. Wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown had six catches for 108 yards - his fifth 100-yard game of the season already. Detroit is now just one game behind the NFL's best record in the Eagles (7-1), while they're level with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Ravens and Jaguars as well. Dating back to last season, they've won a staggering 14 of their last 18 games. And after they snuck into the playoffs last season, the postseason looks to be on the cards again as they have a two-game lead in the NFC North. The Raiders, meanwhile, fell to 3-5 as star receiver Davante Adams was frustrated to the tune of just one catch for 11 yards. Goff was intercepted by Marcus Peters for a 75-yard pick-six in the third quarter of the game He was seen slamming his helmet on the sideline late in the fourth quarter. 'I thought we did have some opportunities to make more plays on offense than we did, but we didn't make them,' McDaniels said. 'We just couldn't string together each enough plays in the passing game.' The Raiders will face the Giants on Sunday, while the Lions head into a bye.

Bernardo exhibited brilliant form throughout the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and provided the assist for Erling Haaland and the club’s second goal and was voted man of the match, despite team-mate Haaland scoring twice and assisting another. ADVERTISEMENT ‘No tattoos, no cars’ Following the match, Guardiola was effusive in his praise of the Portuguese international, commending the player for his adaptability, astuteness, and his simple lifestyle away from the field. “He doesn’t have any tattoos or a nice car—he is an incredible player for us. He loves to play at Old Trafford. He’s played as false 9 in the past and he has the ability to make a lot of passes,” said Guardiola. “He is so intelligent—everyone loves him, and it was another exceptional performance. He’s one of the best players I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve trained a lot and he’s one of the best,” he added. Haaland scored two goals and created another as Manchester City won over Manchester United. The Norwegian netted a first-half penalty and completed his double with a header shortly after the break, before setting up Phil Foden for a third as City closed the gap on leaders Tottenham Hotspur to two points. The City boss was delighted by his team’s performance against the Reds, and pinpointed Haaland’s second strike as a key moment in the game. “The second goal helped us a lot. We talked at half-time and thought they would be more aggressive. We made two incredible build-ups with Ruben and Ederson. After we dropped and after Bernardo and Jack made a good action and those were the key points of the game. ‘Special win at Old Trafford’ “The first seven minutes we lost the ball because we didn’t do simple things. We allowed them to make a transition. The second half was brilliant. Last season we lost, this season we won, and it is always special to win at Old Trafford,” he said.

Hollands, 21, pleaded guilty to at The Star in Broadbeach on September 3. His lawyer told the court his offending had come while his mother was at “death’s door” from illness. Security guards found the wallet containing his ID cards and less than a gram of white powder inside. The drugs were seized by police and Hollands was interviewed by officers, before being charged. He was slapped with a two-month good behaviour bond and ordered to attend a drug education session on Tuesday. He avoided having a conviction recorded. “I’d like thank the magistrate for their time this morning,” Hollands said outside court. “I made a mistake that I’m extremely remorseful for. “It’s not only impacted me, but my family as well. “I’d like to thank both the Carlton footy club and the Gold Coast Suns for their continued support over the last few weeks. Thank you.” Carlton are yet to issue a statement on the court outcome, but similar incidents have resulted in two-match bans by the AFL. Hollands’ charge was made public on October 19 — the day after Gold Coast traded him to the Blues. Carlton revealed it knew about the charge when they recruited him. “The club was notified last month by Hollands, who was a Gold Coast Suns player at the time, given its existing interest in bringing him to the football club,” the club said in a statement. “An informed decision was then made to proceed with the recruitment, and the club will now provide the necessary support to Hollands. “He will commence pre-season training upon its scheduled resumption in November.” Hollands, the No.7 pick from the 2020 national draft, played just 14 games for Gold Coast and was keen to join his younger brother Ollie at the Blues. The AFL Integrity Unit is aware of the Hollands situation and has been conducting its own investigation. His defence lawyer Darren Mahony said while not an excuse, Hollands’ offending has occurred as his mother is seriously ill and is now “at death’s door”. “Sometimes a young man with otherwise exemplary character, a good family and a bright future does something foolish,” Mahony said. “And that’s what’s happened here with Mr Hollands. “Other members of his family are prominent sportsmen, so to be facing this charge is embarrassing to him. He feels as though he’s let himself down, his family down and also his respective clubs.” Hollands’ father Ben played for Richmond in the AFL and West Adelaide in the SANFL.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 02:46:43","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12386997/426c747e824dd1f70d1b5f5d84703028d37b1b44-16x9-x0y20w800h450.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"be25da7f12a7f6971fc845f1f42a8158","title":"Son dakika: FIFA Ballon d'Or'un sahibi Lionel Messi oldu!

Avrupa’nın en iyi futbolcusu, dünyanın her yerinden antrenörlerin ve uluslararası takım kaptanlarının yanı sıra gazetecilerin de kullandığı oylarla belirlendi. Ballon d'Or 2023'ün sahibi Inter Miami forması giyen ve Arjantin Milli Takımı ile Dünya Kupası'nı kaldırmış olan Lionel Messi oldu. Yıldız futbolcu, bu ödülle birlikte Ballon d'O'r'u 8. kez kazandı. France Football dergisinin düzenlediği törende yılın en iyi oyuncusu ödülünü bir dönem Galatasaray'da da forma giyen Didier Drogba takdim etti. Yılın en iyi forvetine verilen Gerd Müller Trophy'nin sahibi Erling Haaland oldu. 2023 Kadınlar Ballon d'Or ödülünü Barcelona'nın İspanyol futbolcusu Aitana Bonmati kazandı. Yılın genç oyuncusuna verilen Kopa Trophy ödülünün sahibi ise Jude Bellingham oldu. Bellingham, ödül sonrasında yaptığı açıklamada, \"Birmingham, Dortmund ve Real Madrid... Teşekkür ederim. Daha fazlası da gelecek.\" ifadelerini kullandı. İnsani Yardım Ödülü olarak bilinen Socrates Ödülü'nün sahibi Vinicius Junior oldu. Real Madrid'in yıldızı ödül sonrası, \"Brezilya'daki insanlara yardım ettiğim ve bu ödülü aldığım için çok mutluyum. Irkçılık, sporun üzerinde olan bir konu.

Gallen had gone to the hotel with his radio colleague Mark Levy, who could be heard in the background shouting: 'Stop it. Enough, enough. Gal, stop' as the men battled to hold the 42-year-old NSW Origin legend and shocked drinkers watched on. Levy and Gallen work on 2GB's Continuous Call Team during the NRL season and the Cronulla Sharks premiership-winning captain contributes to Nine's Wide World of Sports. When Daily Mail Australia asked Gallen about the incident on Tuesday afternoon he initially said: 'I don't know what you're talking about'. Told there was footage of the brawl taken by witnesses, Gallen added, 'No worries', then asked: 'What are the witnesses saying happened?' Gallen and Levy arrived together at the pub, also known as The Heads, where the retired footballer played played pool in the beer garden and took to the dance floor. The fracas involving the married father-of-four, which was recorded on mobile phone cameras, took place about midnight as the pub was preparing to close. Witnesses claimed the fight began after Gallen lost a pool game and a cue was broken over a table. Several sources said Gallen was bleeding from the face after being punched in the nose, which some observers believed had been broken. Daily Mail Australia understands no one else was treated for any injuries. Footballer turned multimillion-dollar professional boxer Paul Gallen has been captured in a wild pub brawl in a coastal holiday town - and it looks like a local patron got the better of him The Nine Network NRL commentator was filmed being restrained by up to four men at the Shoalhaven Heads Hotel on the NSW south coast on Friday night When asked if he wished to comment on how witnesses had described the events Gallen said: 'Yeah mate, I won't make any comment on it.' 'If there's footage of it, then we'll see what happens. I've got nothing to say.' In a second video, a staff member is shown cleaning up the professional pugilist's nose with a cloth, while a concerned Levy watches on. When a man somewhere else in the pub says, 'Thinks he's mad', Gallen turns towards around and rushes towards the voice. The first video, which lasts 1 min and 29 seconds, starts with Gallen being held by three men and apparently throwing punches at one of them. In the background, a concerned Levy can be heard pleading: 'Enough. Enough, enough, enough. Stop it. Enough. Enough. Gal, stop.' As a scuffle rolls through the hotel another voice says: 'Get the f*** out now' before Gallen falls to the ground. 'Stop your mate,' someone says, amid the sound of breaking glass. Levy appears to say again, 'Stop, stop, enough. Gal, enough.' Gallen had gone to the hotel with his radio colleague Mark Levy, who could be heard in the background shouting: 'Stop it. Enough. Enough. Gal, stop' The fracas involving the married father-of-four, which was recorded by mobile phone, took place about midnight as the pub was preparing to close One patron can be heard saying, 'He's bleeding everywhere' as Gallen gets to his feet. Another voice says, 'Get out of here'. Two men then push a third singlet-wearing man away from the melee and Levy appears to say, 'No more, Gal. No more. No more. No more. Stop.' There is no suggestion Levy, who regularly fills in for Ray Hadley on his 2GB morning show, did anything wrong, and footage confirms he attempted to prevent Gallen causing further trouble. Levy, who a friend confirmed would have acted as peacemaker, has been contacted for comment. Daily Mail Australia understands Gallen and Levy had been staying at Currarong, a 50-minute drive away, and arrived at the pub on the hotel's courtesy bus. Police did not attend the pub after the incident and Gallen and Levy are believed to have returned to their accommodation via the same 12-seater transport. Levy has in the past posted on social media about visiting the pub. Management at The Heads was contacted for comment. Gallen (left) and Levy (right) work on 2GB's Continuous Call Team during the NRL season and the Cronulla Sharks premiership-winning captain contributes to Nine's Wide World of Sports Daily Mail Australia understands Gallen and Levy had been staying at Currarong, a 50-minute drive from The Heads (above), and arrived on the pub's courtesy bus Gallen played 19 seasons of first grade with the Cronulla Sharks and captained the team to the club's first premiership in 2016. He appeared 24 times for NSW and skippered the side which won the 2014 State of Origin series which broke Queensland 's eight-year winning streak. For much of his interstate playing career Gallen was regarded by Maroons fans - who he had once labelled 'two heads' - as their number one enemy. In 2014, Gallen was among Cronulla players who admitted to unknowingly using a banned peptide in exchange for a reduced and backdated ban. Gallen took up boxing in 2012 and has won 15 of 18 bouts as a heavyweight, including wins over Lucas Browne and Mark Hunt. Last year he said he had made $25million from the sport . Gallen retired from the NRL in 2018 as the game's oldest player and since then has been employed by Nine on programs including the Sunday Footy Show, Sport Sunday and 100% Footy. Levy was been with 2GB since 2007, after spending more than six years as a producer and reporter with Sky Racing.

Et un an après son dernier match, il a assuré et rassuré, avec deux grosses parades en première mi-temps devant Abdelli (18e) et Diony (25e). Décisif ! APPIAH (6) Très bon lors de la victoire à Laval (1-0), l'ancien nantais a confirmé son retour en forme. Solide défensivement, il n'a pas hésité à se projeter. BRIANCON (6) Les Verts restaient sur 5 clean sheets et ils en ont enchaîné un 6e. Leur capitaine a encore été exemplaire, avec notamment un joli tacle glissé devant Diony (51e). NADE (5,5) Le robuste gaucher a profité de la blessure de Batubinsika pour jouer à nouveau les utilités. En manque de rythme, il a eu un peu de mal à entrer dans son match. Mais il est monté en puissance et a rendu une bonne copie. PETROT (8) Fidèle au poste, il enchaîne. Et cette fois, il a été carrément épatant, avec un sauvetage sur sa ligne devant Diony qui s'apprêtait à pousser le ballon dans les filets (35e), puis un but, du droit, pour faire le break, en s'arrachant. Le symbole de cette ASSE généreuse, c'est lui ! Le grand 8 pour Sissoko TARDIEU (6,5) Depuis son arrivée, les Verts ne perdent plus. Et il est de mieux en mieux. Il jaillit, il oriente. Il s'installe et bonifie de plus en plus le collectif. RIVERA (5,5), puis MONCONDUIT Milieu droit, Rivera n'a pas été avare d'efforts. Il a pressé et il a proposé, à défaut d'avoir fait des différences. Remplacé par MONCONDUIT, auteur d'un énorme tacle glissé sur lequel il s'est blessé (90e)... FOMBA (6), puis MOUEFFEK Auteur d'une bonne remise pour Bouchouari, Fomba a été précieux dans l'entrejeu, à la récupération comme à la construction. Relayé par MOUEFFEK, qui a apporté sa puissance. BOUCHOUARI (6), puis LOBRY Bouchouari a raté le cadre de peu sur une frappe enroulée après une belle incursion (39e). Il est allé de l'avant et a été agressif à la récupération du ballon. Remplacé par LOBRY, qui s'est mis au diapason. CAFARO (5,5), puis BENTAYG Cafaro a eu quelques fulgurances. Il aurait pu marquer si sa reprise n'avait pas été contrée par Sissoko (23e)... Et c'est lui qui a déposé le corner sur la tête de Sissoko, sur l'ouverture du score. Remplacé par BENTAYG, dangereux par sa vitesse. SISSOKO (6), puis CHARBONNIER Sissoko a été le premier à solliciter Fofana (5e, 30e). Malheureux sur cette action où il empêche Cafaro de marquer (23e), il s'est racheté en ouvrant le score de la tête. Son 8e but de la saison a montré la voie et permis à l'ASSE d'aller chercher sa plus belle victoire de ce début de saison. Remplacé par CHARBONNIER, qui n'a pas réussi à s'illustrer. function getDimensionGA() { var dimension1 = \"144\"; return dimension1; } var logora_config = { shortname: \"horyzon-f09581\", debate: { identifier: \"16-838938\" }, source: { source_url: \"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/actualite/asse-green-reussit-son-retour-sissoko-marque-encore-petrot-doublement-decisif-les-notes-des-verts-contre-angers-838938\", uid: \"16-838938\", title: \"ASSE : Green réussit son retour, Sissoko marque encore, Pétrot doublement décisif... les notes des Verts contre Angers\", description: \"L'ASSE recevait Angers en clôture de la 12e journée de L2.

Djokovic - who is in the city for the Paris Masters and was spotted in the crowd during the recent - was asked to read out the winner of the women’s Ballon d’Or - which went to Spanish world champion Aitana Bonmati. But the whole moment just became awkward for various reasons. First, Djokovic was asked about his own levels of football interest and proceeded to talk about his father being a professional player and how he had to choose between tennis and football as youngster. He’s not going to crack a gag about ‘making the right choice’, is he? Oh no .... “I think I was around nine or 10 years old and I was deciding if I was going to play football or tennis,” Djokovic told the crowd. “So I chose tennis, I don’t know if it was a good choice ... I think it was.” There was some polite applause but it’s fair to say the room didn’t erupt with laughter. Then, Bonmati graced the stage after her name was called out, but more awkward scenes followed. As Bonmati moved the mic and looked at her speech notes, the trophy was nowhere in sight and the star of the show looked less than impressed. Host Sandy Heribert was quick to notice things weren’t right and jumped in: “We’re going to give you the Ballon d’Or, of course.” Eventually, Bonmati was handed the trophy and Heribert again declared her the winner of the Ballon d’Or and asked the crowd to applaud again. The awards had already been heavily criticised because many star players, such as Australia’s Sam Kerr, could not make it due to international duties. And after the event, ABC football writer Samantha Lewis called out the various issues. “So, to summarise: 1) the ceremony was held during a women’s (international) window so most nominees couldn’t attend. 2) the women who WERE there got blanked by a male performer. 3) there’s no women’s equivalent of the Yashin trophy. 4) the biggest award was presented by a dude from... tennis?” She added: “The multiple layers of disrespect really is quite stunning. And all of them were active choices made by the people who run this thing.” Arsenal women correspondent Tim Stillman also found the presence of Djokovic strange. “Nothing says ‘celebrate the achievement of female athletes’ like inviting a male athlete who advocated against equal pay to talk about himself and the completely different sport he plays,” Stillman wrote. “They didn’t even have the actual award on stage for Bonmati when she got to the podium. Someone from backstage had to go and get it.” Fans and journalists were shocked by the fact that the trophy wasn’t ready. Journalist Sam Munnery said: “Almost the coup de grace of insults really - no one even thought to have the trophy out of the box so it eventually just gets shoved into her hands by the backstage bloke. Messi gets his presented by Beckham.” And a fan said: “To add insult to injury, it appears they all forgot to give her the trophy. Ooops. What a joke.” And another: “No one looks very happy about any of it.” Another punter called out the discrepancy between the men and women’s awards. “No U21 female player. No Top Female goal scorer. No Female Goalkeeper. Let’s get Serena or Steffi (Graf) to present Messi. JOKE!” they blasted on social media,” they said.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:15:30","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12386127/c8feccf815ab4b4b9bd0dc35627993cbe34f2f12-16x9-x0y2w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"364e3756d181efe848d27100c2638391","title":"Bonmatí recibe premio femenino","link":"https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/deportes/bonmati-recibe-premio-femenino/20231031000852925871.html","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":["REDACCIÓN"],"video_url":null,"description":"Aitana Bonmatí fue reconocida ayer con el Balón de Oro femenino, durante la gala de France Football en París.

La jugadora completó así una memorable temporada en la que con el FC Barcelona ganó la Liga Española, la Champions y la Supercopa. Sin dudas, su mejor momento llegó con el Mundial femenino que logró con España tras derrotar 1-0 a Inglaterra en la final. Bonmatí ya había ganado el premio UEFA a la mejor futbolista del Viejo Continente. La catalana ha destacado con luz propia y ha sido fundamental para que el Barça recibiera el premio al mejor club del mundo en el fútbol femenino. En varones, ese galardón se lo ha llevado el Manchester City. Emiliano Martínez, vital para Argentina en Catar 2022, fue acreedor del premio Lev Yashin al mejor arquero de este año. Por otro lado, el noruego Erling Haaland recibió el premio Gerd Müller al goleador de la gestión, ya que acumuló 56 festejos entre el Citizen y la selección noruega para ese galardón. El inglés Jude Bellingham, clave para que Real Madrid le ganara (1-2) al FC Barcelona en el clásico español, ha sido reconocido con el premio Kopa al futbolista más destacado, menor de 21 años. Vinicius Junior ha recibido el premio Sócrates por su obra social. Los Balones de Oro (masculino y femenino) recorrieron las calles de París antes de llegar al lugar de la ceremonia.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:08:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"opinionbo","source_priority":450813,"country":["bolivia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"ad2e4a9ab414becafe5b117b18ba08d2","title":"Leo dedica su octavo Balón de Oro ‘al Diego’","link":"https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/deportes/leo-dedica-octavo-balon-oro-diego/20231031000746925869.html","keywords":["Deportes"],"creator":["ANDRÉS PACHECO PINTO"],"video_url":null,"description":"El Diez, fallecido en noviembre de 2020, habría cumplido 63 años ayer en lo que fue una jornada emotiva para Messi durante la gala en París.","content":"En una jornada emotiva, por el que habría sido el cumpleaños 63 de Diego Armando Maradona (fallecido en noviembre de 2020), Lionel Messi le dedicó ayer el octavo Balón de Oro de su carrera. Así lo manifestó el rosarino durante su discurso después de que la France Football le entregara el esperado galardón. “Quiero hacerle una mención a Diego. No hay mejor lugar para desearle un feliz cumpleaños, rodeado de gente que le gusta el fútbol, como le gustaba a él. Donde quiera que estés, feliz cumpleaños. Esto también es para vos”, expresó Messi. El actual jugador del Inter Miami de la MLS quedó por delante de Erling Haaland (goleador y figura del Manchester City) y Kylian Mbappé. Pese a que el noruego fue el máximo artillero de la Premier y la Champions (ambos títulos ganados por el Citizen), el futbolista argentino lo superó. Messi fue el capitán de Argentina en la consagración de la Copa del Mundo Catar 2022, la tercera estrella de su historia. Mbappé, de destacada labor con Francia en el torneo FIFA, ocupó la tercera plaza en la votación. Messi aportó con siete goles en la campaña de la Albiceleste que volvió a gritar campeón mundial por primera vez desde México 1986, donde había brillado Maradona. Aquel lauro se sumó también al conquistado en 1978, cuando el vecino país fue el anfitrión del evento mayor del deporte rey. Messi, además, agradeció nuevamente a su familia y compañeros de equipo. Asimismo, reconoció a Haaland y Mbappé como “figuras con hambre de gloria”. La ceremonia acabó con aplausos.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 04:07:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"opinionbo","source_priority":450813,"country":["bolivia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"bd063db656aa7618a8a24180681349e1","title":"Stade Rennais : confiance ou inconscience, le discours surréaliste du vestiaire rennais","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/stade-rennais/actualite/stade-rennais-confiance-ou-inconscience-le-discours-surrealiste-du-vestiaire-rennais-838896","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Auteur d'un match nul hier sur sa pelouse contre le RC Strasbourg (1-1), le Stade Rennais inquiète dans le jeu et reste englué au milieu de tableau.

The Lions jumped out to a 9-0 first-half lead after three field goals from Riley Patterson, and they never trailed as their defense shut down the Raiders and sacked Las Vegas quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo six times. The Raiders' only offensive touchdown was a Josh Jacobs three-yard run in the second quarter, before Marcus Peters returned an interception for a 75-yard touchdown in the third quarter. 'When your defense plays that good, you can overcome that,' head coach Dan Campbell said. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff passed for 272 yards and a touchdown while running back Jahmyr Gibbs added 152 yards on the ground (plus a score). Jared Goff threw for 272 yards and a touchdown as the Lions took care of business at home Amon-Ra St. Brown tallied six catches for 108 yards - his fifth 100-yard game of the season Davante Adams was visibly frustrated on the Raiders bench. pic.twitter.com/8wIEyZJleu — ESPN (@espn) October 31, 2023 'We wanted to get Gibbs going,' Campbell said. 'You could tell he was feeling it.' 'He's a very talented player with a very dynamic skill set, 'embattled coach Josh McDaniels said of Gibbs. Wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown had six catches for 108 yards - his fifth 100-yard game of the season already. Detroit is now just one game behind the NFL's best record in the Eagles (7-1), while they're level with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Ravens and Jaguars as well. Dating back to last season, they've won a staggering 14 of their last 18 games. And after they snuck into the playoffs last season, the postseason looks to be on the cards again as they have a two-game lead in the NFC North. The Raiders, meanwhile, fell to 3-5 as star receiver Davante Adams was frustrated to the tune of just one catch for 11 yards.

Bernardo exhibited brilliant form throughout the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and provided the assist for Erling Haaland and the club’s second goal and was voted man of the match, despite team-mate Haaland scoring twice and assisting another. ADVERTISEMENT ‘No tattoos, no cars’ Following the match, Guardiola was effusive in his praise of the Portuguese international, commending the player for his adaptability, astuteness, and his simple lifestyle away from the field. “He doesn’t have any tattoos or a nice car—he is an incredible player for us. He loves to play at Old Trafford. He’s played as false 9 in the past and he has the ability to make a lot of passes,” said Guardiola. “He is so intelligent—everyone loves him, and it was another exceptional performance. He’s one of the best players I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve trained a lot and he’s one of the best,” he added. Haaland scored two goals and created another as Manchester City won over Manchester United. The Norwegian netted a first-half penalty and completed his double with a header shortly after the break, before setting up Phil Foden for a third as City closed the gap on leaders Tottenham Hotspur to two points. The City boss was delighted by his team’s performance against the Reds, and pinpointed Haaland’s second strike as a key moment in the game. “The second goal helped us a lot. We talked at half-time and thought they would be more aggressive. We made two incredible build-ups with Ruben and Ederson. After we dropped and after Bernardo and Jack made a good action and those were the key points of the game. ‘Special win at Old Trafford’ “The first seven minutes we lost the ball because we didn’t do simple things. We allowed them to make a transition. The second half was brilliant. Last season we lost, this season we won, and it is always special to win at Old Trafford,” he said. Guardiola’s side are third on point table with 24 points, level with Arsenal.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 03:18:08","image_url":"https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2023/oct/Bernado-ka_d.jpg","source_id":"mid_day","source_priority":4893,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"011e5ca3118a9b8baf3f21c8354c7fa9","title":"Carlton recruit Elijah Hollands pleads guilty to possessing cocaine after leaving wallet in Star casino toilets","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/afl/carlton-recruit-elijah-hollands-pleads-guilty-to-possessing-cocaine-after-leaving-wallet-in-star-casino-toilets-c-12386997","keywords":null,"creator":["Warren Barnsley"],"video_url":null,"description":"The AFL player has learned his fate in court after a slip-up in a casino toilet.","content":"recruit Elijah Hollands left his wallet in the toilets of a Gold Coast casino — and its contents landed him in trouble with the law and his new club. Hollands, 21, pleaded guilty to at The Star in Broadbeach on September 3. His lawyer told the court his offending had come while his mother was at “death’s door” from illness. Security guards found the wallet containing his ID cards and less than a gram of white powder inside. The drugs were seized by police and Hollands was interviewed by officers, before being charged. He was slapped with a two-month good behaviour bond and ordered to attend a drug education session on Tuesday. He avoided having a conviction recorded. “I’d like thank the magistrate for their time this morning,” Hollands said outside court. “I made a mistake that I’m extremely remorseful for. “It’s not only impacted me, but my family as well. “I’d like to thank both the Carlton footy club and the Gold Coast Suns for their continued support over the last few weeks. Thank you.” Carlton are yet to issue a statement on the court outcome, but similar incidents have resulted in two-match bans by the AFL. Hollands’ charge was made public on October 19 — the day after Gold Coast traded him to the Blues. Carlton revealed it knew about the charge when they recruited him. “The club was notified last month by Hollands, who was a Gold Coast Suns player at the time, given its existing interest in bringing him to the football club,” the club said in a statement. “An informed decision was then made to proceed with the recruitment, and the club will now provide the necessary support to Hollands. “He will commence pre-season training upon its scheduled resumption in November.” Hollands, the No.7 pick from the 2020 national draft, played just 14 games for Gold Coast and was keen to join his younger brother Ollie at the Blues. The AFL Integrity Unit is aware of the Hollands situation and has been conducting its own investigation. His defence lawyer Darren Mahony said while not an excuse, Hollands’ offending has occurred as his mother is seriously ill and is now “at death’s door”. “Sometimes a young man with otherwise exemplary character, a good family and a bright future does something foolish,” Mahony said. “And that’s what’s happened here with Mr Hollands. “Other members of his family are prominent sportsmen, so to be facing this charge is embarrassing to him. He feels as though he’s let himself down, his family down and also his respective clubs.” Hollands’ father Ben played for Richmond in the AFL and West Adelaide in the SANFL.","pubDate":"2023-10-31 02:46:43","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12386997/426c747e824dd1f70d1b5f5d84703028d37b1b44-16x9-x0y20w800h450.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
