Rwanda 2-0 South Africa 21 November 2023 Stade Huye Coach Hugo Broos made two changes from the win over Benin as Mothobi Mvala and Evidence Makgopa did not recover from their knocks and were replaced by Nkosinathi Mihlali Mayambela and Sibisi. The opening exchanges proved to be a scrappy affair, with the ball not moving smoothly on the water-logged artificial turf at Stade Huye due to the weather conditions on the day. The home side were not bothered by the conditions and took the lead on 12 minutes when Sibisi misjudged the flight of the ball, which allowed Innocent Nshuti to fire into the bottom corner with a neat finish. Rwanda managed to capitlise on another defensive error midway through the first half when Khuliso Mudau lost the ball in the box, with Gilbert Mugisha taking full advantage by slotting into the far corner for the second goal. Broos' charges showed a couple glimpses of getting back into the encounter, but they did not do enough to trouble Rwanda goalkeeper Fiacre Ntwari, who is no stranger to South African football as he is on the books of TS Galaxy. Broos opted for his first change five minutes after the break, as Orlando Pirate striker Zakhele Lepasa replaced Bongokuhle Hlongwane uprfont. Bafana did see more of the ball in the second half but Williams was first to be seriously tested just after the hour mark as he produced a fine save to keep out a powerful strike from distance. The visitors should have pulled one back in the 77th minute when Mayambela did well to pull the ball back for Themba Zwane, who controlled well before blazing over the target from 12 yards. Rwanda, meanwhile, remain solid defensively and were happy to run down the clock, with the home crowd showing their appreaction for each as they saw out the win. As a result, Rwanda have moved top of Group with four points, while Bafana have dropped to second spot.

The London side are the latest club to be put under the microscope following 10 point deduction for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, and amid ongoing investigations into and finances. According to , Tottenham committed serious breaches of FA rules while selling Jermain Defoe to in 2008. It's understood that Defoe, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and Harry Redknapp, who was Portsmouth manager at the time, all dealt with an unlicensed agent during negotiations. It has also emerged that the FA were aware of the rule breach but did nothing about it, despite the fact were docked 10 points that same year for breaking similar rules. The unlicensed agent involved in the Defoe deal was former and Tottenham player Mitchell Thomas, who was even named by the FA on a list of agents who had been operating in football without a licence in 2008. It was also heard that Levy hired Stuart Peters, an agent who was licensed, to act for Tottenham but that a representation contract - required under FA rules - was not in place at the time of the deal. Tottenham declined to comment when contacted by the Daily Star. Breaching agent rules can lead to punishments ranging from a transfer ban to a points deduction and even relegation to a lower division. Failure to comply with the regulations, according to independent experts, should be regarded as an extremely serious matter, potentially leading to heavy sanctions. The FA have now confirmed they're prepared to review the case and potentially dish out retrospective punishment if are found guilty. It comes with Man City and nervously waiting for reviews of their financial past to conclude. In February, City were charged with 115 separate violations of FFP rules following a four-year investigation. The Manchester club has continually pleaded its innocence and insists it has \"irrefutable evidence\" that it has not fallen foul of regulations, though experts say relegation is a very real threat if the charges stand.

Chelsea, meanwhile, are under the spotlight after leaked documents revealed a series of payments worth tens of millions of pounds made over a decade, routed through offshore vehicle belonging to former owner Roman Abramovich. Defoe, 41, had two spells at Tottenham. He joined the club from West Ham in 2003, and scored 64 goals in 176 games before leaving for Portsmouth mid-way through the 2007/08 season. He returned to Spurs a year later, however, weeks after Redknapp made the same move. He spent a further five years at the club, racking up another 186 appearances and scoring a further 79 goals before leaving for Toronto FC in 2014. The striker later had spells with Sunderland, Bournemouth and Rangers before hanging up his boots in 2022. Players found guilty of breaching FA agent rules are liable to be banned from the game for a period. However, as Defoe is no longer a player, it's likely he'll be fined if found guilty.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:41:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31189746.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Brighton-Hove-Albion-Premier-League.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"11d819d3b5b020f4c188f19c29a3d152","title":"Ex-Crystal Palace footballer who turned to porn Oliver Spedding dies aged 34","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-oliver-spedding-dead-31492669","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Crystal Palace academy player Oliver Spedding - aka porn star Damian Oliver - has died aged 34, two months on from faking girlfriend Sophie Anderson's death","content":"Footballer-turned-porn actor Oliver Spedding has died aged 34. Spedding, who was known in the adult industry as Damian Oliver, was a prospect in Crystal Palace's academy as a teenager.

The defender did continue to play non-league football - and his former club Croydon FC announced last Friday (November 17) he'd passed away, two months on from claims he . \"Croydon FC are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our former player, Oliver Spedding,\" a post on social media read. \"Oliver played for the club over a couple of spells and was a much-loved individual who always gave his utmost for the team. \"Oliver will be hugely missed by everyone at the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time. Rest in Peace, Ollie. Once a Tram, always a Tram.\" Reacting to the shock news, club manager Liam Giles revealed Spedding was considering another spell with them. He wrote: \"Such heartbreaking news, Ollie was a warrior on the pitch and gave 100 per cent every time he represented Croydon FC. \"We spoke a couple of weeks ago about him getting back into football. I hope you find your peace, mate - sleep tight.\" Croydon went on to beat Meridian FC in the London Senior Trophy at the weekend, with the victory dedicated to Spedding.

I am one of the people that helped to start the Premier League. It’s all about the competition, and it has been enormously successful because it’s the best footballing competition in the world. I mean, people around the world didn’t know what Reading was, they thought it was a book you read. They never knew where Wigan was until it was in the Premier League. There were even people arriving on trips from Asia to see Wigan. So, rather than stymie transfer fees as such and tell clubs what they can and cannot spend their money on, I am in favour of there being an overall cap on money spent. Not necessarily on money spent aligning to your turnover, although, obviously that has to have some bearing on it because Manchester United’s overheads are bigger than Luton’s, but but you can’t have Manchester City, United, Liverpool or whoever being able to outbid the Burnley’s of this world just because they can. Otherwise you end up like La Liga when there’s probably three, maybe four teams at the very top and 16 others that can only really compete at a certain level at any given time. I think there has to be a mechanism whereby the great and the good are pretty equal in terms of their ability to sign players. However, after signing young players, then their wellbeing has to be supported. Some of the biggest, saddest moments in my 40 years in football have come when that lovely young kid who’s an Arsenal fan actually gets signed by Arsenal and he’s a hero at school because he’s an Arsenal lad… but he gets to 15 and he’s just not what they want or he’s not good enough… There’s no real mental support for kids who suddenly find that their life has been devastated. It’s scary. You’re grappling with coming to terms with exams, your own sexuality, and suddenly you’re a failure at 15. You’re not of course, because you did really brilliantly by being where you are and there’s absolutely life outside of Arsenal Football Club, but that’s where I’m coming from. There should be a much more considered process and guardianship of young footballers coming through the system where they’re helped into it, helped through it and helped out a bit if they move elsewhere on their journey. I am dismayed by referees being pilloried, physically in some cases and certainly mentally. I just think it sets a really, really, really bad example. I even see it when watching kids play football on a Saturday. It’s not just the kids arguing with the referee, it’s the parents too, and in one case I saw a referee being pushed a few weeks ago. I thought that was beyond belief – and he wasn’t sent off. The parents are encouraging it, shouting abusive language at the referee. I’m a big fan of Mikel Arteta, but against Newcastle, he was wrong. Very wrong. If you have a referee, he’s in charge and he may make mistakes. We all do. And that’s just the way that it is. Just like in rugby, I think the referees should have a microphone attached and I think the crowd should be able to listen to it in real time. One abusive word or phrase – which doesn’t need repeating here – and they’re off, and the crowd will know exactly why. You cannot let the violent society we live in translate onto a football pitch. I’ve never known my country to be so violent in all my 70 years. It’s a ridiculous world we live in now and it’s not going to get any better any time soon. Our football leagues need to lead from the front. It’s the most watched, entertaining and enjoyed physical activity on the planet other than sex, so time to lead by emotional example here. I do think an orange card or sin-binning would be a great idea too because the game has to keep evolving and it would hopefully calm things down a bit more. I believe that there should be some penalty, so maybe 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever it might be – especially if it’s the last 20 minutes. I think that’s something that I would absolutely encourage the Premier League to look at. I like VAR but I know that a lot of people don’t. In the past I’ve been working with nation states at World Cup tournaments when the ball has definitely crossed the line. I’ve seen it cross the line but the referee was 30 yards behind play and didn’t see it, nor did the assistant referee. They’ve gone out of the competition at that stage and probably lost millions of potential income for their Federation because of a poor decision. So I love what they did in the 2022 World Cup with the semi-automated offside technology which is basically AI and it tracks the limbs. By the way, I don’t think a stud on the striker’s right boot should determine if he’s offside or not and I think there has to be a redefining of handball. It’s handball, not ball to hand. The semi-automated offside technology and the technology that runs alongside that I think is fantastic and is the way forward. The Premier League doesn’t employ that by the way. There should be a replay of the incident on the big stadium screen two or three times and somebody commentating on it so there’s some sort of crowd engagement. That wonderful Tottenham game… there were times it took four or five minutes for a decision. you could’ve gone to get a hot dog, come back and find the situation still wasn’t resolved. I don’t think I’m qualified as a referee to say how they should or shouldn’t use the technology, but all I know is that the technology is there, and the advanced technology that FIFA used is there, and it works – . There were a few space disasters before man landed on the moon. I think we’ve got to be cognisant that it may take a year or two, but I think they’ll get it right. It’s important they do and I absolutely believe the crowd should be involved in the engagement of the process. In principle, I agree that there should be some sort of management of multi-club ownership player swaps, because it gives rise to an advantage to those clubs against competing clubs who don’t have that accessibility to players and deals that perhaps are not as financially helpful. If you’re lending within your own group, you’re not really going to charge each other that much and the money gets reinvested into the group again. Of course, there’s ways around it. Let’s just say there are major funds, most of whom I know, who are seeking to own multiple football clubs, and some of the investors in those groups are sovereign wealth funds. So in other words, potentially, you have a country as an owner of a football club, dealing with a fund – of which that country’s sovereign wealth fund, which is different from the state ownership vehicle – actually means that is overly helpful to the initial club. I think clear, clearly defined capital ownership shows that there are no hidden ownerships in that mix, and if even if there are, by the way, that’s okay. Don’t forget Watford have been doing this for years with Udinese. Nobody’s complained, and it’s worked quite well for them. Providing it’s understood that it’s not a whole team, just one or two players every season or something like that, it’s absolutely financially advantageous for the clubs in that equation, beyond just the ability to move a player about. Let’s talk Everton for a moment. The rules are there for a reason and they should be obeyed. There’s been some unfortunate circumstances around Everton but it’s not the most heinous crime of the lot by comparison to what’s alleged at Man City. I think the 10 point deduction is a salutary moment because it will make make clubs sit up and take notice and think about what they might have done in the past. For example, we’ve had Paris Saint-Germain allegedly skirting merrily around certain regulations and financial fair play, and apparently having no sanctions at all. With Manchester City I’d like to put on record that I love the advancement that City have put into the football club ownership in their group . However, if they have breached the regulations 114 or 115 times, then they should be punished, and I’m a little concerned that we’ve heard nothing about that. But if they’re innocent, they’re innocent. They shouldn’t be pilloried because they’re wealthy either. If the regulators have got any teeth in the future, they have to be seen to bite now, because now is the moment where everyone’s eyes are looking at it. I am concerned that the governing bodies are becoming relatively benevolent for obvious reasons of requiring the financial support from some of the sizeable sovereign funds that are around, less so to the big hedge fund owners – but even they get a doff of the cap occasionally. So, I am concerned that if Qatar, Saudi Arabia or whomever want to change the rules, they’ve got more access to people at the top of the game than others. It needs to be literally a level playing field for everyone to have access to the lawmakers or else the supporters will start to drift away – and at that point, you lose the heartbeat of the game. Lastly, the 10-point deduction affects Everton’s supporters as much as it affects the ownership. So I think if if the financial value of a club has been enhanced by you breaching the regulations, in other words, you financially benefited, then a sizeable percentage of the punishment should be financial. Points is part of it yes, because it hurts, but the penalties should also be financial.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:34:02","image_url":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jon-Smith-Super-Agent-Series.jpg","source_id":"caughtoffside","source_priority":16638,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"aa9f9d7d4c6208ed10a398a6b9012cfa","title":"NPFL Alerts Public To Spurious Broadcast Rights Claims By Total Promotions","link":"https://www.completesports.com/npfl-alerts-public-to-spurious-broadcast-rights-claims-by-total-promotions/","keywords":["NPFL News","Nigeria","NPFL"],"creator":["Adeboye Amosu"],"video_url":null,"description":"In its first formal reaction to a certain Total Promotions laying claims to the Broadcast rights of the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL), the League body has asked the general public and it's existing and potential partners to disregard the claims.

While Moscardo looks a hugely promising young talent, it remains to be seen if he’d be quite ready to make the step up from playing in the Brazilian league to being a first-teamer for one of the top clubs in the Premier League. Jones suggested that Liverpool’s preference for South American talents is to see how they get on in Europe first, as was the case with signings like Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, Roberto Firmino, Alisson and others. Moscardo looks like he could fit the bill for Chelsea, however, based on their recent policy of signing some of the best young players from all over the world, including a number that have some from Brazil. Arsenal, on the other hand, might also want someone a bit more proven given where they are in their project right now, with Mikel Arteta’s side chasing the Premier League title this season and competing in the Champions League again. Discussing the Moscardo situation, Jones said: “Another young Brazilian linked with a move to Merseyside is Gabriel Moscardo of Corinthians, although my information is that both Chelsea and Arsenal have shown far more interest in the 18-year-old than Liverpool have. “Liverpool, generally, do not sign first-team players directly from South America. Their tendency in the past has been to wait and see how a talent develops once it has moved to Europe – think of Diaz, Firmino, Fabinho, Nunez, Mac Allister and Alisson as six great examples – before making their move when the player reaches their early-mid 20s.”","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:00:00","image_url":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pochettino-klopp-arteta.jpg","source_id":"caughtoffside","source_priority":16638,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"642f78de992cf20a0a47c131636c4d47","title":"Andre Onana, Luke Shaw, Casemiro - Latest Man Utd injury news & return dates for 11 players - gallery","link":"https://www.manchesterworld.uk/sport/football/manchester-united/andre-onana-luke-shaw-casemiro-latest-man-utd-injury-news-return-dates-for-11-players-4417675","keywords":["Manchester United","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Michael Plant"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester United could welcome back up to five for Sunday’s trip to Everton.","content":"return to the Premier League this weekend when they .

Biggest names in the gaming industry like Soul, GodLike, Gladiator eSports among others where competing for the biggest price, a chance to win a Red Bull Racing experience. Amongst them, Red Bull Athlete, Jonathan Amaral, professionally known as Jonathan Gaming shared his thoughts about his journey. This 21-year-old prodigy already has won his claim to fame through eSports and gaming industry. File image of Jonathan Amaral(Red Bull) What initially drew you into the world of esports, and how did you get started? When it all began initially, I used to love gaming a lot and I used to play shooting games. So, when I came into this scene, people did not expect that this player could play so well. They used to call me a hacker and even gave my ID to the officials to get me banned. All this used to happen back when I was just an amateur in the scene. I was quite nervous and scared that I would be out of the scene because I wanted to be a top notch esports player. Back then, it was my dream. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. What initially drew you into the world of esports, and how did you get started? Just after that, I thought I shouldn’t stop and now I will stream and show people how I play. I still remember my first stream, and I got a frag through the smoke, so people didn’t expect that this guy was playing legit as his live stream. From there, people came to know who Jonathan is and from there my journey started and I kept dominating. From the start, my dream was to keep winning and eventually win the India international trophy, but that is still a dream. How do you balance the demands of competitive gaming with other aspects of your life, such as work or education? About my practice, mostly I wake up at 12pm, max 1pm. Then, I go to the training grounds to practice my close range, sprays etc, and I do some drills in the training grounds for maybe about 20 to 25 minutes. After that, I go into TDMs so that I can improve my close-range skills. I keep doing this process the whole day and then finally I join my customs and train with my teammates. My focus has been to play competitively, usually I must skip my streams to play competitive matches, but when I think it’s the right time to stream on YouTube and other platforms, I am there. Mostly I try to skip and do less of my work so I can focus more on the esports side and get better in the game. Can you share your perspective on the importance of teamwork and communication in esports competitions? In the current scene, teamwork and communication should be top notch. If you don’t have the team synergy, you won’t be winning any trophies. Team work, communication and individual skills are very important to win any tournament. These are the three major things required in a team. How do you feel after being a part of Red Bull? Can you tell us about your thoughts? Being a part of Red Bull, first, this was quite a big surprise for me. I didn’t expect this honestly but now being a Red Bull Player, I feel like something next level has happened in my life. Because I am a frequent consumer of the product, and I was a Red Bull fan too. Now being a Red Bull Player, it has been a dream come true. In your opinion, what do you think about initiatives like Red Bull MEO? How impactful is it for developing esports Red Bull is known for building more scenes for the younger gamers through events like Red Bull Campus Clutch and Red Bull M.E.O. They have shown how it is important to have these initiatives. I am really looking forward to seeing such events and being a part of the initiatives. It is crucial for the Indian gaming scene to have such empowering events that also inspires the young gamers to elevate.

Rwanda 2-0 South Africa 21 November 2023 Stade Huye Coach Hugo Broos made two changes from the win over Benin as Mothobi Mvala and Evidence Makgopa did not recover from their knocks and were replaced by Nkosinathi Mihlali Mayambela and Sibisi. The opening exchanges proved to be a scrappy affair, with the ball not moving smoothly on the water-logged artificial turf at Stade Huye due to the weather conditions on the day. The home side were not bothered by the conditions and took the lead on 12 minutes when Sibisi misjudged the flight of the ball, which allowed Innocent Nshuti to fire into the bottom corner with a neat finish. Rwanda managed to capitlise on another defensive error midway through the first half when Khuliso Mudau lost the ball in the box, with Gilbert Mugisha taking full advantage by slotting into the far corner for the second goal. Broos' charges showed a couple glimpses of getting back into the encounter, but they did not do enough to trouble Rwanda goalkeeper Fiacre Ntwari, who is no stranger to South African football as he is on the books of TS Galaxy. Broos opted for his first change five minutes after the break, as Orlando Pirate striker Zakhele Lepasa replaced Bongokuhle Hlongwane uprfont. Bafana did see more of the ball in the second half but Williams was first to be seriously tested just after the hour mark as he produced a fine save to keep out a powerful strike from distance. The visitors should have pulled one back in the 77th minute when Mayambela did well to pull the ball back for Themba Zwane, who controlled well before blazing over the target from 12 yards. Rwanda, meanwhile, remain solid defensively and were happy to run down the clock, with the home crowd showing their appreaction for each as they saw out the win.

The London side are the latest club to be put under the microscope following 10 point deduction for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, and amid ongoing investigations into and finances. According to , Tottenham committed serious breaches of FA rules while selling Jermain Defoe to in 2008. It's understood that Defoe, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and Harry Redknapp, who was Portsmouth manager at the time, all dealt with an unlicensed agent during negotiations. It has also emerged that the FA were aware of the rule breach but did nothing about it, despite the fact were docked 10 points that same year for breaking similar rules. The unlicensed agent involved in the Defoe deal was former and Tottenham player Mitchell Thomas, who was even named by the FA on a list of agents who had been operating in football without a licence in 2008. It was also heard that Levy hired Stuart Peters, an agent who was licensed, to act for Tottenham but that a representation contract - required under FA rules - was not in place at the time of the deal. Tottenham declined to comment when contacted by the Daily Star. Breaching agent rules can lead to punishments ranging from a transfer ban to a points deduction and even relegation to a lower division. Failure to comply with the regulations, according to independent experts, should be regarded as an extremely serious matter, potentially leading to heavy sanctions. The FA have now confirmed they're prepared to review the case and potentially dish out retrospective punishment if are found guilty. It comes with Man City and nervously waiting for reviews of their financial past to conclude. In February, City were charged with 115 separate violations of FFP rules following a four-year investigation. The Manchester club has continually pleaded its innocence and insists it has \"irrefutable evidence\" that it has not fallen foul of regulations, though experts say relegation is a very real threat if the charges stand.

Chelsea, meanwhile, are under the spotlight after leaked documents revealed a series of payments worth tens of millions of pounds made over a decade, routed through offshore vehicle belonging to former owner Roman Abramovich. Defoe, 41, had two spells at Tottenham. He joined the club from West Ham in 2003, and scored 64 goals in 176 games before leaving for Portsmouth mid-way through the 2007/08 season. He returned to Spurs a year later, however, weeks after Redknapp made the same move. He spent a further five years at the club, racking up another 186 appearances and scoring a further 79 goals before leaving for Toronto FC in 2014. The striker later had spells with Sunderland, Bournemouth and Rangers before hanging up his boots in 2022. Players found guilty of breaching FA agent rules are liable to be banned from the game for a period. However, as Defoe is no longer a player, it's likely he'll be fined if found guilty.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:41:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31189746.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Brighton-Hove-Albion-Premier-League.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"11d819d3b5b020f4c188f19c29a3d152","title":"Ex-Crystal Palace footballer who turned to porn Oliver Spedding dies aged 34","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-oliver-spedding-dead-31492669","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Crystal Palace academy player Oliver Spedding - aka porn star Damian Oliver - has died aged 34, two months on from faking girlfriend Sophie Anderson's death","content":"Footballer-turned-porn actor Oliver Spedding has died aged 34. Spedding, who was known in the adult industry as Damian Oliver, was a prospect in Crystal Palace's academy as a teenager. He didn't make it in the professional game and after a stint in prison, he begun his X-rated career. The defender did continue to play non-league football - and his former club Croydon FC announced last Friday (November 17) he'd passed away, two months on from claims he . \"Croydon FC are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our former player, Oliver Spedding,\" a post on social media read. \"Oliver played for the club over a couple of spells and was a much-loved individual who always gave his utmost for the team. \"Oliver will be hugely missed by everyone at the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time. Rest in Peace, Ollie. Once a Tram, always a Tram.\" Reacting to the shock news, club manager Liam Giles revealed Spedding was considering another spell with them. He wrote: \"Such heartbreaking news, Ollie was a warrior on the pitch and gave 100 per cent every time he represented Croydon FC. \"We spoke a couple of weeks ago about him getting back into football. I hope you find your peace, mate - sleep tight.\" Croydon went on to beat Meridian FC in the London Senior Trophy at the weekend, with the victory dedicated to Spedding. Former team-mate Kieran Rufus commented: \"That win and that clean sheet were for Ollie today. \"He would of loved that and finishing with the song HE started at Croydon. That is all today.

I used to fight as well, maybe that could have gone somewhere. \"I was good at both of those things, but being a porn star, I thought that would be just as good. But it's not as good as people think.\" Spedding made a number of concerning social media posts in the weeks leading up to his death, which included faking Anderson's death in September. He later deleted claims she'd taken an overdose and her funeral was arranged.

I am one of the people that helped to start the Premier League. It’s all about the competition, and it has been enormously successful because it’s the best footballing competition in the world. I mean, people around the world didn’t know what Reading was, they thought it was a book you read. They never knew where Wigan was until it was in the Premier League. There were even people arriving on trips from Asia to see Wigan. So, rather than stymie transfer fees as such and tell clubs what they can and cannot spend their money on, I am in favour of there being an overall cap on money spent. Not necessarily on money spent aligning to your turnover, although, obviously that has to have some bearing on it because Manchester United’s overheads are bigger than Luton’s, but but you can’t have Manchester City, United, Liverpool or whoever being able to outbid the Burnley’s of this world just because they can. Otherwise you end up like La Liga when there’s probably three, maybe four teams at the very top and 16 others that can only really compete at a certain level at any given time. I think there has to be a mechanism whereby the great and the good are pretty equal in terms of their ability to sign players. However, after signing young players, then their wellbeing has to be supported. Some of the biggest, saddest moments in my 40 years in football have come when that lovely young kid who’s an Arsenal fan actually gets signed by Arsenal and he’s a hero at school because he’s an Arsenal lad… but he gets to 15 and he’s just not what they want or he’s not good enough… There’s no real mental support for kids who suddenly find that their life has been devastated. It’s scary. You’re grappling with coming to terms with exams, your own sexuality, and suddenly you’re a failure at 15. You’re not of course, because you did really brilliantly by being where you are and there’s absolutely life outside of Arsenal Football Club, but that’s where I’m coming from. There should be a much more considered process and guardianship of young footballers coming through the system where they’re helped into it, helped through it and helped out a bit if they move elsewhere on their journey. I am dismayed by referees being pilloried, physically in some cases and certainly mentally. I just think it sets a really, really, really bad example. I even see it when watching kids play football on a Saturday. It’s not just the kids arguing with the referee, it’s the parents too, and in one case I saw a referee being pushed a few weeks ago. I thought that was beyond belief – and he wasn’t sent off. The parents are encouraging it, shouting abusive language at the referee. I’m a big fan of Mikel Arteta, but against Newcastle, he was wrong. Very wrong. If you have a referee, he’s in charge and he may make mistakes. We all do. And that’s just the way that it is. Just like in rugby, I think the referees should have a microphone attached and I think the crowd should be able to listen to it in real time. One abusive word or phrase – which doesn’t need repeating here – and they’re off, and the crowd will know exactly why. You cannot let the violent society we live in translate onto a football pitch. I’ve never known my country to be so violent in all my 70 years. It’s a ridiculous world we live in now and it’s not going to get any better any time soon. Our football leagues need to lead from the front. It’s the most watched, entertaining and enjoyed physical activity on the planet other than sex, so time to lead by emotional example here. I do think an orange card or sin-binning would be a great idea too because the game has to keep evolving and it would hopefully calm things down a bit more. I believe that there should be some penalty, so maybe 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever it might be – especially if it’s the last 20 minutes. I think that’s something that I would absolutely encourage the Premier League to look at. I like VAR but I know that a lot of people don’t. In the past I’ve been working with nation states at World Cup tournaments when the ball has definitely crossed the line. I’ve seen it cross the line but the referee was 30 yards behind play and didn’t see it, nor did the assistant referee. They’ve gone out of the competition at that stage and probably lost millions of potential income for their Federation because of a poor decision. So I love what they did in the 2022 World Cup with the semi-automated offside technology which is basically AI and it tracks the limbs. By the way, I don’t think a stud on the striker’s right boot should determine if he’s offside or not and I think there has to be a redefining of handball. It’s handball, not ball to hand. The semi-automated offside technology and the technology that runs alongside that I think is fantastic and is the way forward. The Premier League doesn’t employ that by the way. There should be a replay of the incident on the big stadium screen two or three times and somebody commentating on it so there’s some sort of crowd engagement. That wonderful Tottenham game… there were times it took four or five minutes for a decision. you could’ve gone to get a hot dog, come back and find the situation still wasn’t resolved. I don’t think I’m qualified as a referee to say how they should or shouldn’t use the technology, but all I know is that the technology is there, and the advanced technology that FIFA used is there, and it works – . There were a few space disasters before man landed on the moon. I think we’ve got to be cognisant that it may take a year or two, but I think they’ll get it right. It’s important they do and I absolutely believe the crowd should be involved in the engagement of the process. In principle, I agree that there should be some sort of management of multi-club ownership player swaps, because it gives rise to an advantage to those clubs against competing clubs who don’t have that accessibility to players and deals that perhaps are not as financially helpful. If you’re lending within your own group, you’re not really going to charge each other that much and the money gets reinvested into the group again. Of course, there’s ways around it. Let’s just say there are major funds, most of whom I know, who are seeking to own multiple football clubs, and some of the investors in those groups are sovereign wealth funds. So in other words, potentially, you have a country as an owner of a football club, dealing with a fund – of which that country’s sovereign wealth fund, which is different from the state ownership vehicle – actually means that is overly helpful to the initial club. I think clear, clearly defined capital ownership shows that there are no hidden ownerships in that mix, and if even if there are, by the way, that’s okay. Don’t forget Watford have been doing this for years with Udinese. Nobody’s complained, and it’s worked quite well for them. Providing it’s understood that it’s not a whole team, just one or two players every season or something like that, it’s absolutely financially advantageous for the clubs in that equation, beyond just the ability to move a player about. Let’s talk Everton for a moment. The rules are there for a reason and they should be obeyed. There’s been some unfortunate circumstances around Everton but it’s not the most heinous crime of the lot by comparison to what’s alleged at Man City. I think the 10 point deduction is a salutary moment because it will make make clubs sit up and take notice and think about what they might have done in the past. For example, we’ve had Paris Saint-Germain allegedly skirting merrily around certain regulations and financial fair play, and apparently having no sanctions at all. With Manchester City I’d like to put on record that I love the advancement that City have put into the football club ownership in their group . However, if they have breached the regulations 114 or 115 times, then they should be punished, and I’m a little concerned that we’ve heard nothing about that. But if they’re innocent, they’re innocent. They shouldn’t be pilloried because they’re wealthy either. If the regulators have got any teeth in the future, they have to be seen to bite now, because now is the moment where everyone’s eyes are looking at it. I am concerned that the governing bodies are becoming relatively benevolent for obvious reasons of requiring the financial support from some of the sizeable sovereign funds that are around, less so to the big hedge fund owners – but even they get a doff of the cap occasionally. So, I am concerned that if Qatar, Saudi Arabia or whomever want to change the rules, they’ve got more access to people at the top of the game than others. It needs to be literally a level playing field for everyone to have access to the lawmakers or else the supporters will start to drift away – and at that point, you lose the heartbeat of the game. Lastly, the 10-point deduction affects Everton’s supporters as much as it affects the ownership. So I think if if the financial value of a club has been enhanced by you breaching the regulations, in other words, you financially benefited, then a sizeable percentage of the punishment should be financial. Points is part of it yes, because it hurts, but the penalties should also be financial.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:34:02","image_url":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jon-Smith-Super-Agent-Series.jpg","source_id":"caughtoffside","source_priority":16638,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"aa9f9d7d4c6208ed10a398a6b9012cfa","title":"NPFL Alerts Public To Spurious Broadcast Rights Claims By Total Promotions","link":"https://www.completesports.com/npfl-alerts-public-to-spurious-broadcast-rights-claims-by-total-promotions/","keywords":["NPFL News","Nigeria","NPFL"],"creator":["Adeboye Amosu"],"video_url":null,"description":"In its first formal reaction to a certain Total Promotions laying claims to the Broadcast rights of the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL), the League body has asked the general public and it's existing and potential partners to disregard the claims.

The pair have been together since meeting in 2005 while Crouch was playing for and got hitched six years later. The former and striker, 42, has moved into the media since hanging up his boots and has his own podcast, That Peter Crouch Podcast. He has also teamed up with model wife Clancy to front a podcast aimed at couples. The pair do not shy away from sharing intimate deals about their relationship, including one occasion when Abbey saucily tried to lure her beau away from a training session by going commando. Clancy made the revelation after Peter said: “It's easy to surprise me – very much so. If I came home and you had no clothes on, it'd be the best surprise ever. It's so simple – all you have to do is just not wear any clothes. It's so simple and I'll be so happy. I'm just being honest.” Clancy then divulged: “I picked you up from training once like that, didn't I? That Burberry Mac you got me, I picked him up from training once with that on and nothing underneath it – to get him home.” The stunt worked with Crouch adding: “And it worked – very well.” However, Crouch did complain that Clancy had made few romantic gestures during their relationship. “All the onus is on the man – that's the problem,” he moaned. Clancy did go all out on one occasion though, arranging a stripper for Crouch’s birthday one year. The worker turned up while the couple were out having a meal and it didn’t go down well with the birthday boy. “He went ballistic,” said Clancy. “I got him a roly-poly-o-gram and he went mad. A larger stripper – and he went mental that everyone was looking at him, so told her instantly to leave. She didn't even take one sock off.” The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!

I'm playing for Liverpool and England at the time and everyone started filming. “I was like 'I'm sorry, but I can't do this'. So I just gave her some cash and said 'Can you leave?'

While Moscardo looks a hugely promising young talent, it remains to be seen if he’d be quite ready to make the step up from playing in the Brazilian league to being a first-teamer for one of the top clubs in the Premier League. Jones suggested that Liverpool’s preference for South American talents is to see how they get on in Europe first, as was the case with signings like Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, Roberto Firmino, Alisson and others. Moscardo looks like he could fit the bill for Chelsea, however, based on their recent policy of signing some of the best young players from all over the world, including a number that have some from Brazil. Arsenal, on the other hand, might also want someone a bit more proven given where they are in their project right now, with Mikel Arteta’s side chasing the Premier League title this season and competing in the Champions League again. Discussing the Moscardo situation, Jones said: “Another young Brazilian linked with a move to Merseyside is Gabriel Moscardo of Corinthians, although my information is that both Chelsea and Arsenal have shown far more interest in the 18-year-old than Liverpool have. “Liverpool, generally, do not sign first-team players directly from South America. Their tendency in the past has been to wait and see how a talent develops once it has moved to Europe – think of Diaz, Firmino, Fabinho, Nunez, Mac Allister and Alisson as six great examples – before making their move when the player reaches their early-mid 20s.”","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:00:00","image_url":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pochettino-klopp-arteta.jpg","source_id":"caughtoffside","source_priority":16638,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"642f78de992cf20a0a47c131636c4d47","title":"Andre Onana, Luke Shaw, Casemiro - Latest Man Utd injury news & return dates for 11 players - gallery","link":"https://www.manchesterworld.uk/sport/football/manchester-united/andre-onana-luke-shaw-casemiro-latest-man-utd-injury-news-return-dates-for-11-players-4417675","keywords":["Manchester United","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Michael Plant"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester United could welcome back up to five for Sunday’s trip to Everton.","content":"return to the Premier League this weekend when they .

Biggest names in the gaming industry like Soul, GodLike, Gladiator eSports among others where competing for the biggest price, a chance to win a Red Bull Racing experience. Amongst them, Red Bull Athlete, Jonathan Amaral, professionally known as Jonathan Gaming shared his thoughts about his journey. This 21-year-old prodigy already has won his claim to fame through eSports and gaming industry. File image of Jonathan Amaral(Red Bull) What initially drew you into the world of esports, and how did you get started? When it all began initially, I used to love gaming a lot and I used to play shooting games. So, when I came into this scene, people did not expect that this player could play so well. They used to call me a hacker and even gave my ID to the officials to get me banned. All this used to happen back when I was just an amateur in the scene. I was quite nervous and scared that I would be out of the scene because I wanted to be a top notch esports player. Back then, it was my dream. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. What initially drew you into the world of esports, and how did you get started? Just after that, I thought I shouldn’t stop and now I will stream and show people how I play. I still remember my first stream, and I got a frag through the smoke, so people didn’t expect that this guy was playing legit as his live stream. From there, people came to know who Jonathan is and from there my journey started and I kept dominating. From the start, my dream was to keep winning and eventually win the India international trophy, but that is still a dream. How do you balance the demands of competitive gaming with other aspects of your life, such as work or education? About my practice, mostly I wake up at 12pm, max 1pm. Then, I go to the training grounds to practice my close range, sprays etc, and I do some drills in the training grounds for maybe about 20 to 25 minutes. After that, I go into TDMs so that I can improve my close-range skills. I keep doing this process the whole day and then finally I join my customs and train with my teammates. My focus has been to play competitively, usually I must skip my streams to play competitive matches, but when I think it’s the right time to stream on YouTube and other platforms, I am there. Mostly I try to skip and do less of my work so I can focus more on the esports side and get better in the game. Can you share your perspective on the importance of teamwork and communication in esports competitions? In the current scene, teamwork and communication should be top notch. If you don’t have the team synergy, you won’t be winning any trophies. Team work, communication and individual skills are very important to win any tournament. These are the three major things required in a team. How do you feel after being a part of Red Bull? Can you tell us about your thoughts? Being a part of Red Bull, first, this was quite a big surprise for me. I didn’t expect this honestly but now being a Red Bull Player, I feel like something next level has happened in my life. Because I am a frequent consumer of the product, and I was a Red Bull fan too. Now being a Red Bull Player, it has been a dream come true. In your opinion, what do you think about initiatives like Red Bull MEO? How impactful is it for developing esports Red Bull is known for building more scenes for the younger gamers through events like Red Bull Campus Clutch and Red Bull M.E.O. They have shown how it is important to have these initiatives. I am really looking forward to seeing such events and being a part of the initiatives. It is crucial for the Indian gaming scene to have such empowering events that also inspires the young gamers to elevate.

Rwanda 2-0 South Africa 21 November 2023 Stade Huye Coach Hugo Broos made two changes from the win over Benin as Mothobi Mvala and Evidence Makgopa did not recover from their knocks and were replaced by Nkosinathi Mihlali Mayambela and Sibisi. The opening exchanges proved to be a scrappy affair, with the ball not moving smoothly on the water-logged artificial turf at Stade Huye due to the weather conditions on the day. The home side were not bothered by the conditions and took the lead on 12 minutes when Sibisi misjudged the flight of the ball, which allowed Innocent Nshuti to fire into the bottom corner with a neat finish. Rwanda managed to capitlise on another defensive error midway through the first half when Khuliso Mudau lost the ball in the box, with Gilbert Mugisha taking full advantage by slotting into the far corner for the second goal. Broos' charges showed a couple glimpses of getting back into the encounter, but they did not do enough to trouble Rwanda goalkeeper Fiacre Ntwari, who is no stranger to South African football as he is on the books of TS Galaxy. Broos opted for his first change five minutes after the break, as Orlando Pirate striker Zakhele Lepasa replaced Bongokuhle Hlongwane uprfont. Bafana did see more of the ball in the second half but Williams was first to be seriously tested just after the hour mark as he produced a fine save to keep out a powerful strike from distance. The visitors should have pulled one back in the 77th minute when Mayambela did well to pull the ball back for Themba Zwane, who controlled well before blazing over the target from 12 yards. Rwanda, meanwhile, remain solid defensively and were happy to run down the clock, with the home crowd showing their appreaction for each as they saw out the win. As a result, Rwanda have moved top of Group with four points, while Bafana have dropped to second spot.

The London side are the latest club to be put under the microscope following 10 point deduction for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, and amid ongoing investigations into and finances. According to , Tottenham committed serious breaches of FA rules while selling Jermain Defoe to in 2008. It's understood that Defoe, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and Harry Redknapp, who was Portsmouth manager at the time, all dealt with an unlicensed agent during negotiations. It has also emerged that the FA were aware of the rule breach but did nothing about it, despite the fact were docked 10 points that same year for breaking similar rules. The unlicensed agent involved in the Defoe deal was former and Tottenham player Mitchell Thomas, who was even named by the FA on a list of agents who had been operating in football without a licence in 2008. It was also heard that Levy hired Stuart Peters, an agent who was licensed, to act for Tottenham but that a representation contract - required under FA rules - was not in place at the time of the deal. Tottenham declined to comment when contacted by the Daily Star. Breaching agent rules can lead to punishments ranging from a transfer ban to a points deduction and even relegation to a lower division. Failure to comply with the regulations, according to independent experts, should be regarded as an extremely serious matter, potentially leading to heavy sanctions. The FA have now confirmed they're prepared to review the case and potentially dish out retrospective punishment if are found guilty. It comes with Man City and nervously waiting for reviews of their financial past to conclude. In February, City were charged with 115 separate violations of FFP rules following a four-year investigation. The Manchester club has continually pleaded its innocence and insists it has \"irrefutable evidence\" that it has not fallen foul of regulations, though experts say relegation is a very real threat if the charges stand.

Chelsea, meanwhile, are under the spotlight after leaked documents revealed a series of payments worth tens of millions of pounds made over a decade, routed through offshore vehicle belonging to former owner Roman Abramovich. Defoe, 41, had two spells at Tottenham. He joined the club from West Ham in 2003, and scored 64 goals in 176 games before leaving for Portsmouth mid-way through the 2007/08 season. He returned to Spurs a year later, however, weeks after Redknapp made the same move. He spent a further five years at the club, racking up another 186 appearances and scoring a further 79 goals before leaving for Toronto FC in 2014. The striker later had spells with Sunderland, Bournemouth and Rangers before hanging up his boots in 2022. Players found guilty of breaching FA agent rules are liable to be banned from the game for a period. However, as Defoe is no longer a player, it's likely he'll be fined if found guilty.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:41:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31189746.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Brighton-Hove-Albion-Premier-League.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"11d819d3b5b020f4c188f19c29a3d152","title":"Ex-Crystal Palace footballer who turned to porn Oliver Spedding dies aged 34","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-oliver-spedding-dead-31492669","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Crystal Palace academy player Oliver Spedding - aka porn star Damian Oliver - has died aged 34, two months on from faking girlfriend Sophie Anderson's death","content":"Footballer-turned-porn actor Oliver Spedding has died aged 34. Spedding, who was known in the adult industry as Damian Oliver, was a prospect in Crystal Palace's academy as a teenager. He didn't make it in the professional game and after a stint in prison, he begun his X-rated career. The defender did continue to play non-league football - and his former club Croydon FC announced last Friday (November 17) he'd passed away, two months on from claims he . \"Croydon FC are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our former player, Oliver Spedding,\" a post on social media read. \"Oliver played for the club over a couple of spells and was a much-loved individual who always gave his utmost for the team. \"Oliver will be hugely missed by everyone at the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time. Rest in Peace, Ollie. Once a Tram, always a Tram.\" Reacting to the shock news, club manager Liam Giles revealed Spedding was considering another spell with them. He wrote: \"Such heartbreaking news, Ollie was a warrior on the pitch and gave 100 per cent every time he represented Croydon FC. \"We spoke a couple of weeks ago about him getting back into football. I hope you find your peace, mate - sleep tight.\" Croydon went on to beat Meridian FC in the London Senior Trophy at the weekend, with the victory dedicated to Spedding. Former team-mate Kieran Rufus commented: \"That win and that clean sheet were for Ollie today. \"He would of loved that and finishing with the song HE started at Croydon. That is all today. RIP bro, watching down on us helped us get the win for you and your family.\" Spedding met partner Anderson while on set, striking up a romance with her. He opened up on his experiences on the in July of last year - expressing some regret with his career decision. He said: \"When I was at , if I'd have stayed with them, then I could have been earning a lot more playing football. I used to fight as well, maybe that could have gone somewhere. \"I was good at both of those things, but being a porn star, I thought that would be just as good. But it's not as good as people think.\" Spedding made a number of concerning social media posts in the weeks leading up to his death, which included faking Anderson's death in September. He later deleted claims she'd taken an overdose and her funeral was arranged.

I am one of the people that helped to start the Premier League. It’s all about the competition, and it has been enormously successful because it’s the best footballing competition in the world. I mean, people around the world didn’t know what Reading was, they thought it was a book you read. They never knew where Wigan was until it was in the Premier League. There were even people arriving on trips from Asia to see Wigan. So, rather than stymie transfer fees as such and tell clubs what they can and cannot spend their money on, I am in favour of there being an overall cap on money spent. Not necessarily on money spent aligning to your turnover, although, obviously that has to have some bearing on it because Manchester United’s overheads are bigger than Luton’s, but but you can’t have Manchester City, United, Liverpool or whoever being able to outbid the Burnley’s of this world just because they can. Otherwise you end up like La Liga when there’s probably three, maybe four teams at the very top and 16 others that can only really compete at a certain level at any given time. I think there has to be a mechanism whereby the great and the good are pretty equal in terms of their ability to sign players. However, after signing young players, then their wellbeing has to be supported. Some of the biggest, saddest moments in my 40 years in football have come when that lovely young kid who’s an Arsenal fan actually gets signed by Arsenal and he’s a hero at school because he’s an Arsenal lad… but he gets to 15 and he’s just not what they want or he’s not good enough… There’s no real mental support for kids who suddenly find that their life has been devastated. It’s scary. You’re grappling with coming to terms with exams, your own sexuality, and suddenly you’re a failure at 15. You’re not of course, because you did really brilliantly by being where you are and there’s absolutely life outside of Arsenal Football Club, but that’s where I’m coming from. There should be a much more considered process and guardianship of young footballers coming through the system where they’re helped into it, helped through it and helped out a bit if they move elsewhere on their journey. I am dismayed by referees being pilloried, physically in some cases and certainly mentally. I just think it sets a really, really, really bad example. I even see it when watching kids play football on a Saturday. It’s not just the kids arguing with the referee, it’s the parents too, and in one case I saw a referee being pushed a few weeks ago. I thought that was beyond belief – and he wasn’t sent off. The parents are encouraging it, shouting abusive language at the referee. I’m a big fan of Mikel Arteta, but against Newcastle, he was wrong. Very wrong. If you have a referee, he’s in charge and he may make mistakes. We all do. And that’s just the way that it is. Just like in rugby, I think the referees should have a microphone attached and I think the crowd should be able to listen to it in real time. One abusive word or phrase – which doesn’t need repeating here – and they’re off, and the crowd will know exactly why. You cannot let the violent society we live in translate onto a football pitch. I’ve never known my country to be so violent in all my 70 years. It’s a ridiculous world we live in now and it’s not going to get any better any time soon. Our football leagues need to lead from the front. It’s the most watched, entertaining and enjoyed physical activity on the planet other than sex, so time to lead by emotional example here. I do think an orange card or sin-binning would be a great idea too because the game has to keep evolving and it would hopefully calm things down a bit more. I believe that there should be some penalty, so maybe 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever it might be – especially if it’s the last 20 minutes. I think that’s something that I would absolutely encourage the Premier League to look at. I like VAR but I know that a lot of people don’t. In the past I’ve been working with nation states at World Cup tournaments when the ball has definitely crossed the line. I’ve seen it cross the line but the referee was 30 yards behind play and didn’t see it, nor did the assistant referee. They’ve gone out of the competition at that stage and probably lost millions of potential income for their Federation because of a poor decision. So I love what they did in the 2022 World Cup with the semi-automated offside technology which is basically AI and it tracks the limbs. By the way, I don’t think a stud on the striker’s right boot should determine if he’s offside or not and I think there has to be a redefining of handball. It’s handball, not ball to hand. The semi-automated offside technology and the technology that runs alongside that I think is fantastic and is the way forward. The Premier League doesn’t employ that by the way. There should be a replay of the incident on the big stadium screen two or three times and somebody commentating on it so there’s some sort of crowd engagement. That wonderful Tottenham game… there were times it took four or five minutes for a decision. you could’ve gone to get a hot dog, come back and find the situation still wasn’t resolved. I don’t think I’m qualified as a referee to say how they should or shouldn’t use the technology, but all I know is that the technology is there, and the advanced technology that FIFA used is there, and it works – . There were a few space disasters before man landed on the moon. I think we’ve got to be cognisant that it may take a year or two, but I think they’ll get it right. It’s important they do and I absolutely believe the crowd should be involved in the engagement of the process. In principle, I agree that there should be some sort of management of multi-club ownership player swaps, because it gives rise to an advantage to those clubs against competing clubs who don’t have that accessibility to players and deals that perhaps are not as financially helpful. If you’re lending within your own group, you’re not really going to charge each other that much and the money gets reinvested into the group again. Of course, there’s ways around it. Let’s just say there are major funds, most of whom I know, who are seeking to own multiple football clubs, and some of the investors in those groups are sovereign wealth funds. So in other words, potentially, you have a country as an owner of a football club, dealing with a fund – of which that country’s sovereign wealth fund, which is different from the state ownership vehicle – actually means that is overly helpful to the initial club. I think clear, clearly defined capital ownership shows that there are no hidden ownerships in that mix, and if even if there are, by the way, that’s okay. Don’t forget Watford have been doing this for years with Udinese. Nobody’s complained, and it’s worked quite well for them. Providing it’s understood that it’s not a whole team, just one or two players every season or something like that, it’s absolutely financially advantageous for the clubs in that equation, beyond just the ability to move a player about. Let’s talk Everton for a moment. The rules are there for a reason and they should be obeyed. There’s been some unfortunate circumstances around Everton but it’s not the most heinous crime of the lot by comparison to what’s alleged at Man City. I think the 10 point deduction is a salutary moment because it will make make clubs sit up and take notice and think about what they might have done in the past. For example, we’ve had Paris Saint-Germain allegedly skirting merrily around certain regulations and financial fair play, and apparently having no sanctions at all. With Manchester City I’d like to put on record that I love the advancement that City have put into the football club ownership in their group . However, if they have breached the regulations 114 or 115 times, then they should be punished, and I’m a little concerned that we’ve heard nothing about that. But if they’re innocent, they’re innocent. They shouldn’t be pilloried because they’re wealthy either. If the regulators have got any teeth in the future, they have to be seen to bite now, because now is the moment where everyone’s eyes are looking at it. I am concerned that the governing bodies are becoming relatively benevolent for obvious reasons of requiring the financial support from some of the sizeable sovereign funds that are around, less so to the big hedge fund owners – but even they get a doff of the cap occasionally. So, I am concerned that if Qatar, Saudi Arabia or whomever want to change the rules, they’ve got more access to people at the top of the game than others. It needs to be literally a level playing field for everyone to have access to the lawmakers or else the supporters will start to drift away – and at that point, you lose the heartbeat of the game. Lastly, the 10-point deduction affects Everton’s supporters as much as it affects the ownership. So I think if if the financial value of a club has been enhanced by you breaching the regulations, in other words, you financially benefited, then a sizeable percentage of the punishment should be financial. Points is part of it yes, because it hurts, but the penalties should also be financial.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:34:02","image_url":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jon-Smith-Super-Agent-Series.jpg","source_id":"caughtoffside","source_priority":16638,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"aa9f9d7d4c6208ed10a398a6b9012cfa","title":"NPFL Alerts Public To Spurious Broadcast Rights Claims By Total Promotions","link":"https://www.completesports.com/npfl-alerts-public-to-spurious-broadcast-rights-claims-by-total-promotions/","keywords":["NPFL News","Nigeria","NPFL"],"creator":["Adeboye Amosu"],"video_url":null,"description":"In its first formal reaction to a certain Total Promotions laying claims to the Broadcast rights of the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL), the League body has asked the general public and it's existing and potential partners to disregard the claims.

While Moscardo looks a hugely promising young talent, it remains to be seen if he’d be quite ready to make the step up from playing in the Brazilian league to being a first-teamer for one of the top clubs in the Premier League. Jones suggested that Liverpool’s preference for South American talents is to see how they get on in Europe first, as was the case with signings like Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, Roberto Firmino, Alisson and others. Moscardo looks like he could fit the bill for Chelsea, however, based on their recent policy of signing some of the best young players from all over the world, including a number that have some from Brazil. Arsenal, on the other hand, might also want someone a bit more proven given where they are in their project right now, with Mikel Arteta’s side chasing the Premier League title this season and competing in the Champions League again. Discussing the Moscardo situation, Jones said: “Another young Brazilian linked with a move to Merseyside is Gabriel Moscardo of Corinthians, although my information is that both Chelsea and Arsenal have shown far more interest in the 18-year-old than Liverpool have. “Liverpool, generally, do not sign first-team players directly from South America. Their tendency in the past has been to wait and see how a talent develops once it has moved to Europe – think of Diaz, Firmino, Fabinho, Nunez, Mac Allister and Alisson as six great examples – before making their move when the player reaches their early-mid 20s.”","pubDate":"2023-11-21 14:00:00","image_url":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pochettino-klopp-arteta.jpg","source_id":"caughtoffside","source_priority":16638,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"642f78de992cf20a0a47c131636c4d47","title":"Andre Onana, Luke Shaw, Casemiro - Latest Man Utd injury news & return dates for 11 players - gallery","link":"https://www.manchesterworld.uk/sport/football/manchester-united/andre-onana-luke-shaw-casemiro-latest-man-utd-injury-news-return-dates-for-11-players-4417675","keywords":["Manchester United","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Michael Plant"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester United could welcome back up to five for Sunday’s trip to Everton.","content":"return to the Premier League this weekend when they . Remarkably, the Red Devils are the most in-form side in the division, with four wins from the last five matches. The most recent came in the form of a , when Victor Lindelof handed the side three points ahead of the international break. That result saw Erik ten Hag’s side move into sixth place and, despite the underwhelming displays this season, United are just five points off the Champions League spots at present. The club’s resolve will once again be tested this weekend when they make the short journey to Goodison Park. Everton are still reeling from their historic last week, the biggest in Premier League history. Aggrieved fans have also raised over £33,000 for banners and flags that will be on display , with supporters’ groups aiming to create a ‘hostile’ atmosphere. United have typically struggled to cope with any sort of adversity this season, and Sunday’s game will be a litmus test for this supposedly improving side. United could also be helped by the return of several key players from injury, and a study this week claimed no side in the league have suffered from more injury issues this season than the Red Devils. Ahead of the Everton clash there are concerns surrounding nine players, six of whom were ruled out of the Luton match. Two members of the team in that 1-0 victory, while another picked up an issue . Then there’s the Jadon Sancho saga and a final player who sat out the last match . We have the latest on all 11 first-teamers and when they’re expected to return to the side… Sustained a back injury in Cameroon's win over Mauritius last weekend but several reports claim he should be fit to face Everton. Missed the win over through illness but should be back for this weekend. Won't be back for another week or two, with the start of next month looking like a likely return date. Ten Hag said earlier this month that the defender won't play before Christmas as he recovers from a foot injury.","pubDate":"2023-11-21 13:57:07","image_url":"https://www.manchesterworld.uk/jpim-static/image/2023/11/21/13/20/GettyImages-1580366221.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"manchesterworld","source_priority":123384,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"64a38faf42c2c4697de47f9758654f26","title":"'Events like Red Bull M.E.O. crucial for Indian gamers to inspire and elevate Indian gaming scenario': Jonathan Amaral","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/events-like-red-bull-meo-crucial-for-indian-gamers-to-inspire-and-elevate-indian-gaming-scenario-jonathan-amaral-101700574252806.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Jonathan Amaral, a 21-year-old prodigy has already made a name for himself in the eSports and gaming industry.","content":"One of the biggest events in the Indian gaming community took place recently in Delhi on November 18, 2023, witnessed some of the exciting gameplays of 2023. Biggest names in the gaming industry like Soul, GodLike, Gladiator eSports among others where competing for the biggest price, a chance to win a Red Bull Racing experience. Amongst them, Red Bull Athlete, Jonathan Amaral, professionally known as Jonathan Gaming shared his thoughts about his journey. This 21-year-old prodigy already has won his claim to fame through eSports and gaming industry. File image of Jonathan Amaral(Red Bull) What initially drew you into the world of esports, and how did you get started? When it all began initially, I used to love gaming a lot and I used to play shooting games. So, when I came into this scene, people did not expect that this player could play so well. They used to call me a hacker and even gave my ID to the officials to get me banned. All this used to happen back when I was just an amateur in the scene. I was quite nervous and scared that I would be out of the scene because I wanted to be a top notch esports player. Back then, it was my dream. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. What initially drew you into the world of esports, and how did you get started? Just after that, I thought I shouldn’t stop and now I will stream and show people how I play. I still remember my first stream, and I got a frag through the smoke, so people didn’t expect that this guy was playing legit as his live stream. From there, people came to know who Jonathan is and from there my journey started and I kept dominating. From the start, my dream was to keep winning and eventually win the India international trophy, but that is still a dream. How do you balance the demands of competitive gaming with other aspects of your life, such as work or education? About my practice, mostly I wake up at 12pm, max 1pm. Then, I go to the training grounds to practice my close range, sprays etc, and I do some drills in the training grounds for maybe about 20 to 25 minutes. After that, I go into TDMs so that I can improve my close-range skills. I keep doing this process the whole day and then finally I join my customs and train with my teammates. My focus has been to play competitively, usually I must skip my streams to play competitive matches, but when I think it’s the right time to stream on YouTube and other platforms, I am there. Mostly I try to skip and do less of my work so I can focus more on the esports side and get better in the game. Can you share your perspective on the importance of teamwork and communication in esports competitions? In the current scene, teamwork and communication should be top notch. If you don’t have the team synergy, you won’t be winning any trophies. Team work, communication and individual skills are very important to win any tournament. These are the three major things required in a team. How do you feel after being a part of Red Bull? Can you tell us about your thoughts? Being a part of Red Bull, first, this was quite a big surprise for me. I didn’t expect this honestly but now being a Red Bull Player, I feel like something next level has happened in my life. Because I am a frequent consumer of the product, and I was a Red Bull fan too. Now being a Red Bull Player, it has been a dream come true. In your opinion, what do you think about initiatives like Red Bull MEO? How impactful is it for developing esports Red Bull is known for building more scenes for the younger gamers through events like Red Bull Campus Clutch and Red Bull M.E.O. They have shown how it is important to have these initiatives. I am really looking forward to seeing such events and being a part of the initiatives. It is crucial for the Indian gaming scene to have such empowering events that also inspires the young gamers to elevate.
