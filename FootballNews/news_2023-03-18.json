Conte, 53, was fuming with his Spurs players, after they let a 3-1 lead slip at Southampton in the last 15 minutes. And in an extraordinary rant , he claimed his side were going backwards and failing to take responsibility for their poor performances of late. Now, ex-Liverpool star Carragher believes Daniel Levy should put the ex-Chelsea coach 'out of his misery' and sack him tonight, Carragher tweeted: \"Conte wants to be sacked in this international break. \"Spurs should just put him out of his misery and do it tonight.\" Carragher was later quizzed by ex-Watford star Troy Deeney about Spurs' plight. The Sky Sports pundit continued: \"His point about Spurs not winning for a long time is right, but you don‚Äôt speak about your own club like that. \"Especially when you‚Äôre getting paid fortunes by them! The improvement in Arsenal this season after finishing above them last season kills a lot of his arguments.\" While Tottenham currently occupy fourth place, rivals for a Champions League spot Newcastle have two games in hand and trail the North London side by just two points. In recent weeks, Spurs have crashed out of the FA Cup to Sheffield United and were defeated by AC Milan in the Champions League over two legs. Conte was particularly livid with his team's collapse against Southampton. He told BBC Sport : \"I'm really upset because this is not the first time and I think today I can tell you that this is an upset because we are winning 3-1 and 15 minutes to go and I think you have to win. \"Instead we showed this another time, things started to improve last season but we lost the characteristic of last season. I don't want to talk about the technical aspect, the spirit is missing. \"We are not a team. We are a team that everyone is thinking of himself. \"When you are in this way that can happen, you lose against Sheffield United and drop the FA Cup and with AC Milan and to finish that run you're winning 3-1 and the last 15 you are able to give them the possibility to come back.

I know the way to beat teams, in the past I beat a lot of teams, winning teams. \"Now instead we are going behind, no one is interested in this. I have great frustration about this because me and the staff stay every day to think of a way to improve. Honestly, it's time I have to take responsibility for me, the staff, the club but also the players. \"The players go onto the pitch, I'm the coach OK I take the responsibility, the players have to take some. What happened in the last period is unacceptable and I tried every moment to speak to try to improve the situation and to transfer the importance to be a team and to help each other but I'm not seeing this. \"Today it happened in a game we're winning 3-1, it's in your hands but we have to take the environment. \"The club and I are always under scrutiny but the players have to take responsibility because I don't see this. 'In a process where you want to build something, the tactical aspect is important but the spirit is important. \"The mind has to stay focussed and despite one and a half years, I saw much more last season. This season we are going backwards.\"","pubDate":"2023-03-18 20:40:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"–ù–ê –ñ–ò–í–û: –£–¥–∏–Ω–µ–∑–µ - –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω 1:1, –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞–Ω –≤–ª–µ–∑–µ –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/italia/multimedia/video/na-zhivo-udineze-milan-11-zlatan-vleze-v-istoriiata-na-seriia-a-725900","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–£–¥–∏–Ω–µ–∑–µ –∏ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω –∏–≥—Ä–∞—è—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ 1:1 –≤ –º–∞—á –æ—Ç 27-–∏—è –∫—Ä—ä–≥ –Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê. –í 10-–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –ü–µ—Ä–µ–π—Ä–∞ –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:0. –í –ø—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –ø—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –ø–æ–ª—É–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞–Ω –ò–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:1. –ü—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –ø–æ-–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–µ—à–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥ –≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ \"—Ä–æ—Å–æ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ\". –°–ª–µ–¥ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –æ—Ç –∫–æ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ä –†–æ–¥—Ä–∏–≥–æ –ë–µ–∫–∞–æ –∏ –ê–π–∑—ä–∫ –°—ä–∫—Å–µ—Å –Ω–µ —É—Å–ø—è—Ö–∞ –¥...","content":"–£–¥–∏–Ω–µ–∑–µ –∏ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω –∏–≥—Ä–∞—è—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ 2:1 –≤ –º–∞—á –æ—Ç 27-–∏—è –∫—Ä—ä–≥ –Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê. –í 10-–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –ü–µ—Ä–µ–π—Ä–∞ –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:0. –í –ø—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –ø—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –ø–æ–ª—É–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞–Ω –ò–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:1. –í –ø–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–µ–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –Ω–∞ –ø—ä—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç –ë–µ—Ç–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ –∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ \"–∑–µ–±—Ä–∏—Ç–µ\" –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–µ–¥ –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—Ç–∞—Ç–∞.

The Gunners are currently topping the league table, but are spending less than half on wages than Manchester United and Chelsea . Arsenal‚Äôs London rivals Chelsea are splashing out the most on wages this season but are in the midst of a miserable season and sit 10th in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta leads his old mentor Pep Guardiola in the race for the title this year by five points, while Manchester City are also heavy spenders on wages. The two sides are the only ones truly in the title race with United 16 points behind Arsenal with 11 games to go. And the Emirates outfit are doing so without dipping too deep into their pockets to fork out salaries, spending just under ¬£98million on wages every year, according to the Mirror . That is the sixth-most in the Premier League, less than Liverpool and Tottenham as well. The exact number sits at ¬£97,878,000, which is more than half of Chelsea‚Äôs mammoth total that amounts at ¬£212,090,000. Arsenal‚Äôs biggest earners are Gabriel Jesus on ¬£265,000-a-week and Thomas Partey on ¬£200,000-a-week ‚Äì the only two players on ¬£200,000-a-week or more. Oleksandr Zinchenko has the next highest pay packet on ¬£150,000-a-week. And that is a million miles away from down the road at Chelsea, who have five players earning ¬£200,000-a-week or more ‚Äì Raheem Sterling (¬£325,000-a-week), Kalidou Koulibaly (¬£295,000-a-week), N‚ÄôGolo Kante (¬£290,000-a-week), Reece James (¬£250,000-a-week) and Wesley Fofana (¬£200,000-a-week). United are the next biggest spenders on wages, dishing out ¬£211,875,000-a-year, which is also more than double Arsenal‚Äôs amount. City are third with ¬£182,640,000-a-year and then Liverpool on ¬£158,788,000-a-year. Tottenham are even higher spenders than Arsenal, handing out ¬£110,438,000-a-year ‚Äì nearly ¬£13m more than their big rivals. On the opposite end of the table, Brighton and Brentford currently spend the least ‚Äì making their seasons even more incredible considering how they are battling for European spots. The Bees are the lowest, spending just ¬£30,170,000-a-year on wages, followed by Brighton on ¬£35,685,000-a-year.

Welcome back Vincent. Now let‚Äôs not forget who‚Äôs the master and who is the pupil, here, eh? A standing ovation from the fans who worshipped him for 11 years, and the warmest of embraces from Pep Guardiola ahead of this sixth round showdown. Then an end to the geniality and a jab for the jugular, as Erling Haaland led the charge for the throat and it all became just another day in the office for Guardiola and his City slickers. And a painful smack in the chops for Kompany‚Äôs Clarets as to what lies in wait once they are back in the rarefied atmosphere of the Premier League. It actually became so cruel in the end that you half expected a towel to come floating across from the Burnley dugout. If referee John Brooks had an ounce of compassion he‚Äôd have stopped this early. An FA Cup tie that was a genuine contest for over half an hour eventually turned into an exhibition. By the end City were so on top and Burnley so browbeaten that the home side could have been done for bullying. If it was an audition for which of Kompany‚Äôs Clarets were up to joining him on the journey back in the Promised Land next term, you‚Äôd have to say not many would have passed it. To be honest, for 33 minutes they must have been starting to wonder what all the fuss was about with the Premier League, City and this supposed goal machine called Haaland. Two devastatingly clinical first half minutes told them exactly what‚Ä¶drop your guard for a split second with him around and it‚Äôs curtains. HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL So suddenly half time pats on the back all round because finger pointing at who went missing where and when. Haaland does that to a side. Twice they gave him half a yard in the first half. Both times he punished them in the deadliest fashion. They did it again in the second half and guess what? Same again. A cruel nudge in the ribs for Kompany and his crew, too, that while you may get away with it in the Championship, when it comes to this level, not a chance. Take City‚Äôs opener, for example. A straight forward ball through the middle from Julian Alvarez, and Haaland was through on Bailey Peacock-Farrell. A dip of the shoulder, the hint of a shimmy and a poke under the keeper with the outside of his left boot. Two minutes later the Norwegian was in again, Peacock-Farrell was beaten again, and City were in the FA Cup semi-finals‚Ä¶.again. This time the creation was a little more crafted, Kevin De Bruyne setting Phil Foden free down the left with a slide rule ball inside Connor Roberts. Foden looked up, took aim and delivered the perfect low cross which Haaland met at just the right time to sidefoot in from close range. Game over, then, before half-time. Incredibly after Burnley looked to have done the donkey work of weathering an early storm. That worked out well, then. Before they knew it Haaland was completing his sixth hat-trick of the season, taking his tally to EIGHT in two games, and bagging yet another match ball. Again Foden was the creator, this time with a fizzing low drive which struck the upright and was clinically dispatched by the Norwegian‚Äôs one-touch finish. As if to prove that the quickfire first half one-two was no one-off, City then produced another to make it four. Riyad Mahrez and De Bruyne were the architects and Alverez the finisher, smashing into an empty net with the Clarets cracked wide open. Time, then, for Haaland to take a break. Not a bad week‚Äôs work, all told, to go with the five Champions League goals he helped himself to against Leipzig on Tuesday. And to think they all scoffed when it was first suggested he could reach 50 in his first season in England. Last night‚Äôs nap hand has left him on 42 already. The way it‚Äôs going, he‚Äôll be disappointed if his eventual haul stops at ‚Äújust‚Äù half a century. City certainly didn‚Äôt stop with his departure, mind, and Cole Palmer ‚Äì the man who came on for Haaland ‚Äì got in on the act by volleying into an empty net. Alvarez finished the romp by tapping in a point blank sixth, before referee Brooks finally called a halt to the punishment. Although for Kompany, somehow you imagine it will take a while longer for the pain to subside.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 20:13:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fans blast Gary Lineker as he returns to screens WITHOUT apologising for ‚Äòdisgraceful‚Äô Nazi tweet after BBC climbdown","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/10406361/fans-divided-gary-lineker-returns-without-apologising/","keywords":["Football","Sport","BBC","BBC ONE","Television","Twitter"],"creator":["Morgan Johnson"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"FANS are divided after Gary Lineker returned to screens WITHOUT apologising for his \"disgraceful\" Nazi tweet. The former footie star, 62, was back on TV tonight hosting live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley. He appeared alongside Alan Shearer and Micah Richards for the first time since the Twitter scandal which saw him suspended. The highest paid BBC pundit was taken off air over his criticism of Suella Braverman's migrant boats plan. His tweet - in which he likened the Illegal Migration Bill to \"Germany in the '30s\" - was blasted as ‚Äúfoul, ill-conceived and disgraceful‚Äù by MPs. And now fans have piled in, with some calling for Lineker to step down after he failed to apologise. One person said: \"Hypocrite. Please quit,\" while another added: \"Will definitely not be watching.\" Someone else wrote: \"Well stick to football then and leave the politics to the politicians.\" Another added: \"You don‚Äôt just stick to football and that‚Äôs the problem.\" \"Time for a change I feel. Bring in some new faces. Panel have had their day unfortunately in my eyes,\" someone else said. Fans also said the BBC's embarrassing U-turn 72 hours after taking Lineker off air may spell trouble for the cooperation. One viewer said: \"Lineker hammered the final nail home in the BBC‚Äôs coffin. \"Well done Gary - the license fee is now toast.\" The presenter , on ¬£1.35million a year was blasted for his criticism of Suella Braverman's migrant boats plan. He hit out at the Illegal Migration Bill, which bans people who arrive on small boats from settling in Britain, on Twitter. Lineker wrote: \"This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s, and I'm out of order?\" The bill will see migrants detained and removed to their home country, or a safe third state within 28 days. Tory MPs slammed the tweet as ‚Äúfoul, ill-conceived and disgraceful‚Äù, while Downing Street said his language was ‚Äúnot acceptable and disappointing to see‚Äù. Energy secretary Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúAs a Jewish cabinet minister I need no lessons about 1930s Germany from Gary Lineker. ‚ÄúLike Gary, I am hosting refugees in my own home, but unlike Gary, I do not believe it is either right or moral to tolerate criminal gangs trafficking vulnerable people across the channel.‚Äù Home secretary Suella Braverman branded the TV presenter‚Äôs comments ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù and immigration minister Robert Jenrick said he was ‚Äúout of step with the British public‚Äù. Following Lineker's tweet, the BBC \"decided that [Lineker] will step back from presenting Match of the Day\" after the post was found to have breached the BBC's strict impartiality rules. Lineker's co-hosts on the show, Ian Wright and Shearer, also pulled out in support if their colleague. But the BBC later confirmed Lineker WILL return to the channel in an embarrassing climbdown 72 hours later. Director General Tim Davie apologised for the \"difficult period\" for staff, presenters and audiences after his embarrassing climbdown. Lineker's failure to say sorry himself also attracted criticism. He today marked his return to the popular TV show by tweeting a picture of him and teammates Shearer and Micah Richards. The host will commentate live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley. The smiling pic of the trio comes minutes after Lineker posted a selfie with the caption: \"Ah the joys of being allowed to stick to football .\" Since the controversy exploded, the BBC have come under fire for their handling of the situation. Mr Davie said in a statement the corporation has commissioned an independent review of its social media guidelines and apologised for the impartiality row. He described the BBC's commitment to freedom of expression and impartiality as a \"difficult balancing act\". He added: \"The potential confusion caused by the grey areas of the BBC's social media guidance that was introduced in 2020 is recognised. \"I want to get matters resolved and our sport content back on air.\" Lineker is reportedly yet to confirm his role presenting the BBC's Champions League coverage when it kicks off next year. This comes as rival, BT Sport, is said to be targeting Lineker for their TNT Sports next season, according to Mail Online .

Conte, 53, was fuming with his Spurs players, after they let a 3-1 lead slip at Southampton in the last 15 minutes. And in an extraordinary rant , he claimed his side were going backwards and failing to take responsibility for their poor performances of late. Now, ex-Liverpool star Carragher believes Daniel Levy should put the ex-Chelsea coach 'out of his misery' and sack him tonight, Carragher tweeted: \"Conte wants to be sacked in this international break. \"Spurs should just put him out of his misery and do it tonight.\" Carragher was later quizzed by ex-Watford star Troy Deeney about Spurs' plight. The Sky Sports pundit continued: \"His point about Spurs not winning for a long time is right, but you don‚Äôt speak about your own club like that. \"Especially when you‚Äôre getting paid fortunes by them! The improvement in Arsenal this season after finishing above them last season kills a lot of his arguments.\" While Tottenham currently occupy fourth place, rivals for a Champions League spot Newcastle have two games in hand and trail the North London side by just two points. In recent weeks, Spurs have crashed out of the FA Cup to Sheffield United and were defeated by AC Milan in the Champions League over two legs. Conte was particularly livid with his team's collapse against Southampton. He told BBC Sport : \"I'm really upset because this is not the first time and I think today I can tell you that this is an upset because we are winning 3-1 and 15 minutes to go and I think you have to win. \"Instead we showed this another time, things started to improve last season but we lost the characteristic of last season. I don't want to talk about the technical aspect, the spirit is missing. \"We are not a team. We are a team that everyone is thinking of himself. \"When you are in this way that can happen, you lose against Sheffield United and drop the FA Cup and with AC Milan and to finish that run you're winning 3-1 and the last 15 you are able to give them the possibility to come back.

I know the way to beat teams, in the past I beat a lot of teams, winning teams. \"Now instead we are going behind, no one is interested in this. I have great frustration about this because me and the staff stay every day to think of a way to improve. Honestly, it's time I have to take responsibility for me, the staff, the club but also the players. \"The players go onto the pitch, I'm the coach OK I take the responsibility, the players have to take some. What happened in the last period is unacceptable and I tried every moment to speak to try to improve the situation and to transfer the importance to be a team and to help each other but I'm not seeing this. \"Today it happened in a game we're winning 3-1, it's in your hands but we have to take the environment. \"The club and I are always under scrutiny but the players have to take responsibility because I don't see this.

The Gunners are currently topping the league table, but are spending less than half on wages than Manchester United and Chelsea . Arsenal‚Äôs London rivals Chelsea are splashing out the most on wages this season but are in the midst of a miserable season and sit 10th in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta leads his old mentor Pep Guardiola in the race for the title this year by five points, while Manchester City are also heavy spenders on wages. The two sides are the only ones truly in the title race with United 16 points behind Arsenal with 11 games to go. And the Emirates outfit are doing so without dipping too deep into their pockets to fork out salaries, spending just under ¬£98million on wages every year, according to the Mirror . That is the sixth-most in the Premier League, less than Liverpool and Tottenham as well. The exact number sits at ¬£97,878,000, which is more than half of Chelsea‚Äôs mammoth total that amounts at ¬£212,090,000. Arsenal‚Äôs biggest earners are Gabriel Jesus on ¬£265,000-a-week and Thomas Partey on ¬£200,000-a-week ‚Äì the only two players on ¬£200,000-a-week or more. Oleksandr Zinchenko has the next highest pay packet on ¬£150,000-a-week. And that is a million miles away from down the road at Chelsea, who have five players earning ¬£200,000-a-week or more ‚Äì Raheem Sterling (¬£325,000-a-week), Kalidou Koulibaly (¬£295,000-a-week), N‚ÄôGolo Kante (¬£290,000-a-week), Reece James (¬£250,000-a-week) and Wesley Fofana (¬£200,000-a-week). United are the next biggest spenders on wages, dishing out ¬£211,875,000-a-year, which is also more than double Arsenal‚Äôs amount. City are third with ¬£182,640,000-a-year and then Liverpool on ¬£158,788,000-a-year. Tottenham are even higher spenders than Arsenal, handing out ¬£110,438,000-a-year ‚Äì nearly ¬£13m more than their big rivals. On the opposite end of the table, Brighton and Brentford currently spend the least ‚Äì making their seasons even more incredible considering how they are battling for European spots. The Bees are the lowest, spending just ¬£30,170,000-a-year on wages, followed by Brighton on ¬£35,685,000-a-year. Just below Arsenal in the spending list is Aston Villa and Everton, on ¬£89,880,000 and ¬£80,707,000 respectively. Both clubs employed England legends Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard at the start of the season but neither survived as relegation form loomed, with Unai Emery and Sean Dyche since arriving to try put out the fire.

Then an end to the geniality and a jab for the jugular, as Erling Haaland led the charge for the throat and it all became just another day in the office for Guardiola and his City slickers. And a painful smack in the chops for Kompany‚Äôs Clarets as to what lies in wait once they are back in the rarefied atmosphere of the Premier League. It actually became so cruel in the end that you half expected a towel to come floating across from the Burnley dugout. If referee John Brooks had an ounce of compassion he‚Äôd have stopped this early. An FA Cup tie that was a genuine contest for over half an hour eventually turned into an exhibition. By the end City were so on top and Burnley so browbeaten that the home side could have been done for bullying. If it was an audition for which of Kompany‚Äôs Clarets were up to joining him on the journey back in the Promised Land next term, you‚Äôd have to say not many would have passed it. To be honest, for 33 minutes they must have been starting to wonder what all the fuss was about with the Premier League, City and this supposed goal machine called Haaland. Two devastatingly clinical first half minutes told them exactly what‚Ä¶drop your guard for a split second with him around and it‚Äôs curtains. HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL So suddenly half time pats on the back all round because finger pointing at who went missing where and when. Haaland does that to a side. Twice they gave him half a yard in the first half. Both times he punished them in the deadliest fashion. They did it again in the second half and guess what? Same again. A cruel nudge in the ribs for Kompany and his crew, too, that while you may get away with it in the Championship, when it comes to this level, not a chance. Take City‚Äôs opener, for example. A straight forward ball through the middle from Julian Alvarez, and Haaland was through on Bailey Peacock-Farrell. A dip of the shoulder, the hint of a shimmy and a poke under the keeper with the outside of his left boot. Two minutes later the Norwegian was in again, Peacock-Farrell was beaten again, and City were in the FA Cup semi-finals‚Ä¶.again. This time the creation was a little more crafted, Kevin De Bruyne setting Phil Foden free down the left with a slide rule ball inside Connor Roberts. Foden looked up, took aim and delivered the perfect low cross which Haaland met at just the right time to sidefoot in from close range. Game over, then, before half-time. Incredibly after Burnley looked to have done the donkey work of weathering an early storm. That worked out well, then. Before they knew it Haaland was completing his sixth hat-trick of the season, taking his tally to EIGHT in two games, and bagging yet another match ball. Again Foden was the creator, this time with a fizzing low drive which struck the upright and was clinically dispatched by the Norwegian‚Äôs one-touch finish. As if to prove that the quickfire first half one-two was no one-off, City then produced another to make it four. Riyad Mahrez and De Bruyne were the architects and Alverez the finisher, smashing into an empty net with the Clarets cracked wide open. Time, then, for Haaland to take a break. Not a bad week‚Äôs work, all told, to go with the five Champions League goals he helped himself to against Leipzig on Tuesday. And to think they all scoffed when it was first suggested he could reach 50 in his first season in England. Last night‚Äôs nap hand has left him on 42 already. The way it‚Äôs going, he‚Äôll be disappointed if his eventual haul stops at ‚Äújust‚Äù half a century. City certainly didn‚Äôt stop with his departure, mind, and Cole Palmer ‚Äì the man who came on for Haaland ‚Äì got in on the act by volleying into an empty net. Alvarez finished the romp by tapping in a point blank sixth, before referee Brooks finally called a halt to the punishment. Although for Kompany, somehow you imagine it will take a while longer for the pain to subside.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 20:13:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fans blast Gary Lineker as he returns to screens WITHOUT apologising for ‚Äòdisgraceful‚Äô Nazi tweet after BBC climbdown","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/10406361/fans-divided-gary-lineker-returns-without-apologising/","keywords":["Football","Sport","BBC","BBC ONE","Television","Twitter"],"creator":["Morgan Johnson"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"FANS are divided after Gary Lineker returned to screens WITHOUT apologising for his \"disgraceful\" Nazi tweet. The former footie star, 62, was back on TV tonight hosting live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley. He appeared alongside Alan Shearer and Micah Richards for the first time since the Twitter scandal which saw him suspended. The highest paid BBC pundit was taken off air over his criticism of Suella Braverman's migrant boats plan. His tweet - in which he likened the Illegal Migration Bill to \"Germany in the '30s\" - was blasted as ‚Äúfoul, ill-conceived and disgraceful‚Äù by MPs. And now fans have piled in, with some calling for Lineker to step down after he failed to apologise. One person said: \"Hypocrite. Please quit,\" while another added: \"Will definitely not be watching.\" Someone else wrote: \"Well stick to football then and leave the politics to the politicians.\" Another added: \"You don‚Äôt just stick to football and that‚Äôs the problem.\" \"Time for a change I feel. Bring in some new faces. Panel have had their day unfortunately in my eyes,\" someone else said. Fans also said the BBC's embarrassing U-turn 72 hours after taking Lineker off air may spell trouble for the cooperation. One viewer said: \"Lineker hammered the final nail home in the BBC‚Äôs coffin. \"Well done Gary - the license fee is now toast.\" The presenter , on ¬£1.35million a year was blasted for his criticism of Suella Braverman's migrant boats plan. He hit out at the Illegal Migration Bill, which bans people who arrive on small boats from settling in Britain, on Twitter. Lineker wrote: \"This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s, and I'm out of order?\" The bill will see migrants detained and removed to their home country, or a safe third state within 28 days. Tory MPs slammed the tweet as ‚Äúfoul, ill-conceived and disgraceful‚Äù, while Downing Street said his language was ‚Äúnot acceptable and disappointing to see‚Äù. Energy secretary Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúAs a Jewish cabinet minister I need no lessons about 1930s Germany from Gary Lineker. ‚ÄúLike Gary, I am hosting refugees in my own home, but unlike Gary, I do not believe it is either right or moral to tolerate criminal gangs trafficking vulnerable people across the channel.‚Äù Home secretary Suella Braverman branded the TV presenter‚Äôs comments ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù and immigration minister Robert Jenrick said he was ‚Äúout of step with the British public‚Äù. Following Lineker's tweet, the BBC \"decided that [Lineker] will step back from presenting Match of the Day\" after the post was found to have breached the BBC's strict impartiality rules. Lineker's co-hosts on the show, Ian Wright and Shearer, also pulled out in support if their colleague. But the BBC later confirmed Lineker WILL return to the channel in an embarrassing climbdown 72 hours later. Director General Tim Davie apologised for the \"difficult period\" for staff, presenters and audiences after his embarrassing climbdown. Lineker's failure to say sorry himself also attracted criticism. He today marked his return to the popular TV show by tweeting a picture of him and teammates Shearer and Micah Richards. The host will commentate live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley. The smiling pic of the trio comes minutes after Lineker posted a selfie with the caption: \"Ah the joys of being allowed to stick to football .\" Since the controversy exploded, the BBC have come under fire for their handling of the situation. Mr Davie said in a statement the corporation has commissioned an independent review of its social media guidelines and apologised for the impartiality row. He described the BBC's commitment to freedom of expression and impartiality as a \"difficult balancing act\". He added: \"The potential confusion caused by the grey areas of the BBC's social media guidance that was introduced in 2020 is recognised. \"I want to get matters resolved and our sport content back on air.\" Lineker is reportedly yet to confirm his role presenting the BBC's Champions League coverage when it kicks off next year. This comes as rival, BT Sport, is said to be targeting Lineker for their TNT Sports next season, according to Mail Online . Today saw the arrival of the Home Secretary in Rwanda, to meet with President Paul Kagame and her counterpart Vincent Biruta, to discuss the plan.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 20:10:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"–°–∞–ª–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –∏ –ë–æ–ª–æ–Ω—è –Ω–µ —Å–µ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–∏—Ö–∞","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/italia/salernitana-i-bolonia-ne-se-pobediha-725914","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–°–∞–ª–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –∏ –ë–æ–ª–æ–Ω—è –∑–∞–≤—ä—Ä—à–∏—Ö–∞ 2:2 –≤ —Å—Ä–µ—â–∞ –æ—Ç 27-–∏—è –∫—Ä—ä–≥ –Ω–∞ –∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê. –°–∞–ª–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ –¥–≤–∞ –ø—ä—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–≤–µ–∂–¥–∞—à–µ –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, –Ω–æ –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ —É—Å–ø—è—Ö–∞ –¥–∞ –∏–∑–º—ä–∫–Ω–∞—Ç —Ç–æ—á–∫–∞—Ç–∞. –õ–æ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–æ –ü–∏—Ä–æ–ª–∞ –¥–∞–¥–µ –∞–≤–∞–Ω—Å –Ω–∞ –¥–æ–º–∞–∫–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ —Å–ª–µ–¥ –∞—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ö–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–≤–∞ –≤ 7-–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞, –Ω–æ —Å–∞–º–æ —á–µ—Ç–∏—Ä–∏ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∏ –ø–æ-–∫—ä—Å–Ω–æ –õ—é–∏—Å –§—ä—Ä–≥—é—Å—ä–Ω –∏–∑—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏ –∑–∞ ...","content":"–°–∞–ª–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –∏ –ë–æ–ª–æ–Ω—è –∑–∞–≤—ä—Ä—à–∏—Ö–∞ 2:2 –≤ —Å—Ä–µ—â–∞ –æ—Ç 27-–∏—è –∫—Ä—ä–≥ –Ω–∞ –∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê. –°–∞–ª–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ –¥–≤–∞ –ø—ä—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–≤–µ–∂–¥–∞—à–µ –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, –Ω–æ –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ —É—Å–ø—è—Ö–∞ –¥–∞ –∏–∑–º—ä–∫–Ω–∞—Ç —Ç–æ—á–∫–∞—Ç–∞. –õ–æ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–æ –ü–∏—Ä–æ–ª–∞ –¥–∞–¥–µ –∞–≤–∞–Ω—Å –Ω–∞ –¥–æ–º–∞–∫–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ —Å–ª–µ–¥ –∞—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ö–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–≤–∞ –≤ 7-–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞, –Ω–æ —Å–∞–º–æ —á–µ—Ç–∏—Ä–∏ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∏ –ø–æ-–∫—ä—Å–Ω–æ –õ—é–∏—Å –§—ä—Ä–≥—é—Å—ä–Ω –∏–∑—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏ –∑–∞ –ë–æ–ª–æ–Ω—è. –í—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç —Å–µ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏ –ø–æ –∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—á–µ–Ω –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω -

Conte, 53, was fuming with his Spurs players, after they let a 3-1 lead slip at Southampton in the last 15 minutes. And in an extraordinary rant , he claimed his side were going backwards and failing to take responsibility for their poor performances of late. Now, ex-Liverpool star Carragher believes Daniel Levy should put the ex-Chelsea coach 'out of his misery' and sack him tonight, Carragher tweeted: \"Conte wants to be sacked in this international break. \"Spurs should just put him out of his misery and do it tonight.\" Carragher was later quizzed by ex-Watford star Troy Deeney about Spurs' plight. The Sky Sports pundit continued: \"His point about Spurs not winning for a long time is right, but you don‚Äôt speak about your own club like that. \"Especially when you‚Äôre getting paid fortunes by them! The improvement in Arsenal this season after finishing above them last season kills a lot of his arguments.\" While Tottenham currently occupy fourth place, rivals for a Champions League spot Newcastle have two games in hand and trail the North London side by just two points. In recent weeks, Spurs have crashed out of the FA Cup to Sheffield United and were defeated by AC Milan in the Champions League over two legs. Conte was particularly livid with his team's collapse against Southampton. He told BBC Sport : \"I'm really upset because this is not the first time and I think today I can tell you that this is an upset because we are winning 3-1 and 15 minutes to go and I think you have to win. \"Instead we showed this another time, things started to improve last season but we lost the characteristic of last season. I don't want to talk about the technical aspect, the spirit is missing. \"We are not a team. We are a team that everyone is thinking of himself. \"When you are in this way that can happen, you lose against Sheffield United and drop the FA Cup and with AC Milan and to finish that run you're winning 3-1 and the last 15 you are able to give them the possibility to come back. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST ONLINE CASINOS FOR 2023 \"I don't see the sense of responsibility of the players.\" Conte added that he believes his team are going backwards and that Saturday's collapse was \"unacceptable\". \"Now it's difficult - we are working hard with this group and to move in the right direction,\" Conte continued. \"We are going behind, I see a lot of negative situations and a lot of selfish situations and players that I don't like. I know the way to beat teams, in the past I beat a lot of teams, winning teams. \"Now instead we are going behind, no one is interested in this. I have great frustration about this because me and the staff stay every day to think of a way to improve. Honestly, it's time I have to take responsibility for me, the staff, the club but also the players. \"The players go onto the pitch, I'm the coach OK I take the responsibility, the players have to take some. What happened in the last period is unacceptable and I tried every moment to speak to try to improve the situation and to transfer the importance to be a team and to help each other but I'm not seeing this. \"Today it happened in a game we're winning 3-1, it's in your hands but we have to take the environment. \"The club and I are always under scrutiny but the players have to take responsibility because I don't see this. 'In a process where you want to build something, the tactical aspect is important but the spirit is important. \"The mind has to stay focussed and despite one and a half years, I saw much more last season. This season we are going backwards.\"","pubDate":"2023-03-18 20:40:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"–ù–ê –ñ–ò–í–û: –£–¥–∏–Ω–µ–∑–µ - –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω 1:1, –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞–Ω –≤–ª–µ–∑–µ –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/italia/multimedia/video/na-zhivo-udineze-milan-11-zlatan-vleze-v-istoriiata-na-seriia-a-725900","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–£–¥–∏–Ω–µ–∑–µ –∏ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω –∏–≥—Ä–∞—è—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ 1:1 –≤ –º–∞—á –æ—Ç 27-–∏—è –∫—Ä—ä–≥ –Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê. –í 10-–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –ü–µ—Ä–µ–π—Ä–∞ –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:0. –í –ø—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –ø—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –ø–æ–ª—É–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞–Ω –ò–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:1. –ü—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –ø–æ-–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–µ—à–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥ –≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ \"—Ä–æ—Å–æ–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ\". –°–ª–µ–¥ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –æ—Ç –∫–æ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ä –†–æ–¥—Ä–∏–≥–æ –ë–µ–∫–∞–æ –∏ –ê–π–∑—ä–∫ –°—ä–∫—Å–µ—Å –Ω–µ —É—Å–ø—è—Ö–∞ –¥...","content":"–£–¥–∏–Ω–µ–∑–µ –∏ –ú–∏–ª–∞–Ω –∏–≥—Ä–∞—è—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ 2:1 –≤ –º–∞—á –æ—Ç 27-–∏—è –∫—Ä—ä–≥ –Ω–∞ –°–µ—Ä–∏—è –ê. –í 10-–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞ –†–æ–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –ü–µ—Ä–µ–π—Ä–∞ –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:0. –í –ø—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –ø—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –ø–æ–ª—É–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞–Ω –ò–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –≤–∫–∞—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ 1:1. –í –ø–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–µ–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –Ω–∞ –ø—ä—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç –ë–µ—Ç–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ –∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ \"–∑–µ–±—Ä–∏—Ç–µ\" –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–µ–¥ –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—Ç–∞—Ç–∞.

The Gunners are currently topping the league table, but are spending less than half on wages than Manchester United and Chelsea . Arsenal‚Äôs London rivals Chelsea are splashing out the most on wages this season but are in the midst of a miserable season and sit 10th in the Premier League. Mikel Arteta leads his old mentor Pep Guardiola in the race for the title this year by five points, while Manchester City are also heavy spenders on wages. The two sides are the only ones truly in the title race with United 16 points behind Arsenal with 11 games to go. And the Emirates outfit are doing so without dipping too deep into their pockets to fork out salaries, spending just under ¬£98million on wages every year, according to the Mirror . That is the sixth-most in the Premier League, less than Liverpool and Tottenham as well. The exact number sits at ¬£97,878,000, which is more than half of Chelsea‚Äôs mammoth total that amounts at ¬£212,090,000. Arsenal‚Äôs biggest earners are Gabriel Jesus on ¬£265,000-a-week and Thomas Partey on ¬£200,000-a-week ‚Äì the only two players on ¬£200,000-a-week or more. Oleksandr Zinchenko has the next highest pay packet on ¬£150,000-a-week. And that is a million miles away from down the road at Chelsea, who have five players earning ¬£200,000-a-week or more ‚Äì Raheem Sterling (¬£325,000-a-week), Kalidou Koulibaly (¬£295,000-a-week), N‚ÄôGolo Kante (¬£290,000-a-week), Reece James (¬£250,000-a-week) and Wesley Fofana (¬£200,000-a-week). United are the next biggest spenders on wages, dishing out ¬£211,875,000-a-year, which is also more than double Arsenal‚Äôs amount. City are third with ¬£182,640,000-a-year and then Liverpool on ¬£158,788,000-a-year. Tottenham are even higher spenders than Arsenal, handing out ¬£110,438,000-a-year ‚Äì nearly ¬£13m more than their big rivals. On the opposite end of the table, Brighton and Brentford currently spend the least ‚Äì making their seasons even more incredible considering how they are battling for European spots. The Bees are the lowest, spending just ¬£30,170,000-a-year on wages, followed by Brighton on ¬£35,685,000-a-year.

Welcome back Vincent. Now let‚Äôs not forget who‚Äôs the master and who is the pupil, here, eh? A standing ovation from the fans who worshipped him for 11 years, and the warmest of embraces from Pep Guardiola ahead of this sixth round showdown. Then an end to the geniality and a jab for the jugular, as Erling Haaland led the charge for the throat and it all became just another day in the office for Guardiola and his City slickers. And a painful smack in the chops for Kompany‚Äôs Clarets as to what lies in wait once they are back in the rarefied atmosphere of the Premier League. It actually became so cruel in the end that you half expected a towel to come floating across from the Burnley dugout. If referee John Brooks had an ounce of compassion he‚Äôd have stopped this early. An FA Cup tie that was a genuine contest for over half an hour eventually turned into an exhibition. By the end City were so on top and Burnley so browbeaten that the home side could have been done for bullying. If it was an audition for which of Kompany‚Äôs Clarets were up to joining him on the journey back in the Promised Land next term, you‚Äôd have to say not many would have passed it. To be honest, for 33 minutes they must have been starting to wonder what all the fuss was about with the Premier League, City and this supposed goal machine called Haaland. Two devastatingly clinical first half minutes told them exactly what‚Ä¶drop your guard for a split second with him around and it‚Äôs curtains. HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL So suddenly half time pats on the back all round because finger pointing at who went missing where and when. Haaland does that to a side. Twice they gave him half a yard in the first half. Both times he punished them in the deadliest fashion. They did it again in the second half and guess what? Same again. A cruel nudge in the ribs for Kompany and his crew, too, that while you may get away with it in the Championship, when it comes to this level, not a chance. Take City‚Äôs opener, for example. A straight forward ball through the middle from Julian Alvarez, and Haaland was through on Bailey Peacock-Farrell. A dip of the shoulder, the hint of a shimmy and a poke under the keeper with the outside of his left boot. Two minutes later the Norwegian was in again, Peacock-Farrell was beaten again, and City were in the FA Cup semi-finals‚Ä¶.again. This time the creation was a little more crafted, Kevin De Bruyne setting Phil Foden free down the left with a slide rule ball inside Connor Roberts. Foden looked up, took aim and delivered the perfect low cross which Haaland met at just the right time to sidefoot in from close range. Game over, then, before half-time. Incredibly after Burnley looked to have done the donkey work of weathering an early storm. That worked out well, then. Before they knew it Haaland was completing his sixth hat-trick of the season, taking his tally to EIGHT in two games, and bagging yet another match ball. Again Foden was the creator, this time with a fizzing low drive which struck the upright and was clinically dispatched by the Norwegian‚Äôs one-touch finish. As if to prove that the quickfire first half one-two was no one-off, City then produced another to make it four. Riyad Mahrez and De Bruyne were the architects and Alverez the finisher, smashing into an empty net with the Clarets cracked wide open. Time, then, for Haaland to take a break. Not a bad week‚Äôs work, all told, to go with the five Champions League goals he helped himself to against Leipzig on Tuesday. And to think they all scoffed when it was first suggested he could reach 50 in his first season in England. Last night‚Äôs nap hand has left him on 42 already. The way it‚Äôs going, he‚Äôll be disappointed if his eventual haul stops at ‚Äújust‚Äù half a century. City certainly didn‚Äôt stop with his departure, mind, and Cole Palmer ‚Äì the man who came on for Haaland ‚Äì got in on the act by volleying into an empty net. Alvarez finished the romp by tapping in a point blank sixth, before referee Brooks finally called a halt to the punishment. Although for Kompany, somehow you imagine it will take a while longer for the pain to subside.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 20:13:15","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fans blast Gary Lineker as he returns to screens WITHOUT apologising for ‚Äòdisgraceful‚Äô Nazi tweet after BBC climbdown","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/10406361/fans-divided-gary-lineker-returns-without-apologising/","keywords":["Football","Sport","BBC","BBC ONE","Television","Twitter"],"creator":["Morgan Johnson"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"FANS are divided after Gary Lineker returned to screens WITHOUT apologising for his \"disgraceful\" Nazi tweet. The former footie star, 62, was back on TV tonight hosting live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley. He appeared alongside Alan Shearer and Micah Richards for the first time since the Twitter scandal which saw him suspended. The highest paid BBC pundit was taken off air over his criticism of Suella Braverman's migrant boats plan. His tweet - in which he likened the Illegal Migration Bill to \"Germany in the '30s\" - was blasted as ‚Äúfoul, ill-conceived and disgraceful‚Äù by MPs. And now fans have piled in, with some calling for Lineker to step down after he failed to apologise. One person said: \"Hypocrite. Please quit,\" while another added: \"Will definitely not be watching.\" Someone else wrote: \"Well stick to football then and leave the politics to the politicians.\" Another added: \"You don‚Äôt just stick to football and that‚Äôs the problem.\" \"Time for a change I feel. Bring in some new faces. Panel have had their day unfortunately in my eyes,\" someone else said. Fans also said the BBC's embarrassing U-turn 72 hours after taking Lineker off air may spell trouble for the cooperation. One viewer said: \"Lineker hammered the final nail home in the BBC‚Äôs coffin. \"Well done Gary - the license fee is now toast.\" The presenter , on ¬£1.35million a year was blasted for his criticism of Suella Braverman's migrant boats plan. He hit out at the Illegal Migration Bill, which bans people who arrive on small boats from settling in Britain, on Twitter. Lineker wrote: \"This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the '30s, and I'm out of order?\" The bill will see migrants detained and removed to their home country, or a safe third state within 28 days. Tory MPs slammed the tweet as ‚Äúfoul, ill-conceived and disgraceful‚Äù, while Downing Street said his language was ‚Äúnot acceptable and disappointing to see‚Äù. Energy secretary Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúAs a Jewish cabinet minister I need no lessons about 1930s Germany from Gary Lineker. ‚ÄúLike Gary, I am hosting refugees in my own home, but unlike Gary, I do not believe it is either right or moral to tolerate criminal gangs trafficking vulnerable people across the channel.‚Äù Home secretary Suella Braverman branded the TV presenter‚Äôs comments ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù and immigration minister Robert Jenrick said he was ‚Äúout of step with the British public‚Äù. Following Lineker's tweet, the BBC \"decided that [Lineker] will step back from presenting Match of the Day\" after the post was found to have breached the BBC's strict impartiality rules. Lineker's co-hosts on the show, Ian Wright and Shearer, also pulled out in support if their colleague. But the BBC later confirmed Lineker WILL return to the channel in an embarrassing climbdown 72 hours later. Director General Tim Davie apologised for the \"difficult period\" for staff, presenters and audiences after his embarrassing climbdown. Lineker's failure to say sorry himself also attracted criticism. He today marked his return to the popular TV show by tweeting a picture of him and teammates Shearer and Micah Richards. The host will commentate live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between Manchester City and Burnley. The smiling pic of the trio comes minutes after Lineker posted a selfie with the caption: \"Ah the joys of being allowed to stick to football .\" Since the controversy exploded, the BBC have come under fire for their handling of the situation. Mr Davie said in a statement the corporation has commissioned an independent review of its social media guidelines and apologised for the impartiality row. He described the BBC's commitment to freedom of expression and impartiality as a \"difficult balancing act\". He added: \"The potential confusion caused by the grey areas of the BBC's social media guidance that was introduced in 2020 is recognised. \"I want to get matters resolved and our sport content back on air.\" Lineker is reportedly yet to confirm his role presenting the BBC's Champions League coverage when it kicks off next year. This comes as rival, BT Sport, is said to be targeting Lineker for their TNT Sports next season, according to Mail Online .
