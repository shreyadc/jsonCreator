To top it off, the former AJAX Footy Club junior and King David School graduate also won the AFLPA‚Äôs 2023 Best First Year Player award. Remarkably, Sheezel was tasked at the beginning of the season, by Roos head coach Alastair Clarkson, to play in the unfamiliar position of half back, rather than his usual half forward spot he‚Äôd played in for AJAX, the Sandringham Dragons, and Vic Metro. Taking hold of that new challenge with both hands, the 2022 AFL Draft number 3 pick averaged 27.0 disposals per game, and made the most disposals (622) by any player in their debut AFL season ever. In his Rising Star award acceptance speech, in front of Clarkson, his parents, and the who‚Äôs who of the AFL, Sheezel thanked his family, and especially his parents, Dean and Lana, for all they‚Äôve done to help him achieve what he has in the sport. ‚ÄúFrom day one, they‚Äôve done so much, and care so much for me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so passionate about football as well, which makes it even better, because I kind of live it with them. ‚ÄúThe support they‚Äôve shown to me, especially this year, has been incredible.‚Äù In an AFL press conference this morning, Sheezel reflected, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt too sure what to espect [in the half back role] at the start of the year, to be honest, but it worked out pretty well, and I love that role now ‚Äì you get a lot of freedom back there.‚Äù He said he also put his full trust in coach Alastair Clarkson putting him in the half back role, describing ‚ÄòClarko‚Äô as having ‚Äúan unbelievable football brain‚Äù. On receiving the award, Sheezel commented, ‚ÄúI think I had that belief and confidence earlier in the year, and the award was kind of a result of that‚Äù. ‚ÄúEvery week I‚Äôd just try and have that confidence that I belong at this level, and try to play my best every week, and so it was good to get recognised. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not too sure where I‚Äôll play [on the field next season]. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm definitely working on my leadership, and trying to drive the group.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-08-31 05:43:35","image_url":"https://static.timesofisrael.com/ajn/uploads/2023/08/20230831001836488282_31545-1024x640.jpeg","source_id":"australianjewishnews","source_priority":511030,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"12fe763306ed48ba6d7753a041a58c13","title":"Top-age contest","link":"https://borderwatch.com.au/sport/2023/08/31/top-age-contest/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Hui Jin"],"video_url":null,"description":"UNDER 18 ‚Äì SOUTH GAMBIER v NORTH GAMBIER AN anticipated match-up awaits in the Western Border Under 18 football qualifying [‚Ä¶] The post Top-age contest appeared first on The Border Watch.","content":"James Murphy UNDER 18 ‚Äì SOUTH GAMBIER v NORTH GAMBIER AN anticipated match-up awaits in the Western Border Under 18 football qualifying final.

Kade Allen was a highlight for North on that occasion, while captain Reece McLaughlin top scored with two goals. Liam Delaney slotted two majors for the Demons, while Kobe Bannon and Cayde Watson also put in solid performances. The other two encounters were one-sided affairs in favour of South and the reigning premiers will be on the hunt for a similar result on Saturday.

The 36-year-old Irishman will get the chance to follow in their footsteps and is determined it will be in the continent‚Äôs second-tier competition once again. It is 16 years since Darren Mackie headed home in a 1-1 draw with Dnipro that sent Jimmy Calderwood‚Äôs Dons into the UEFA Cup group stage. It saw them face Atletico Madrid, Panathinaikos, Copenhagen and Lokomotiv Moscow before mighty Bayern Munich in the knockout stages. Since then, Aberdeen teams have tried and failed to repeat the feat. Hayes was involved when Derek McInnes‚Äô side qualified for Europe eight years in a row and then again under Stephen Glass, only to fail to get beyond the qualifiers. Now Barry Robson‚Äôs crop know if they beat BK Hacken at Pittodrie tonight, they will be in the Europa League groups. If they don‚Äôt, the same stage of the Conference League looms. Hayes said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had two, three or four rounds of qualifying before, had tough draws and fallen that little bit short. I‚Äôve always been envious a little of the 2007-08 squad that played Dnipro. I wish we had one play-off game, regardless of the opposition, to prepare for.

We want to win the game and the glory that comes with playing Europa League football.‚Äù Robson wants his side to enjoy the occasion but Hayes is adamant they are going all out for the Europa League. They aren‚Äôt interested in the consolation should they fail to build on last week‚Äôs 2-2 draw in Sweden. He added: ‚ÄúGolfers want to win the prizes on offer and for us it‚Äôs the same. ‚ÄúThere is a difference between the Europa and Conference League and it is by no means a punishment to go into the Conference League. There‚Äôs an added incentive of the Europa League and I‚Äôm only thinking of winning a one-off game to go into the Europa League group stage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the closest this club have been in 15 years. Some years we had some really tough draws. We had Groningen and Real Sociedad in one season, which was really tough. ‚ÄúThe game that took us most by surprise was probably Shkendija in 2015. They played well but Niall McGinn scored and we went through on away goals. ‚ÄúThese teams are all technically really good. The gap is closing between the likes of Latvia and Macedonia with Scotland and Ireland. You come up against really quality teams you‚Äôve never heard of. Aberdeen's Jonny Hayes (Image: SNS Group) \"Playing one round is easier to overcome than three or four. Had we been offered that chance, we‚Äôd have bitten your hand off. But it‚Äôs come around now and we‚Äôre trying to deliver Europa League football for the club.‚Äù The veteran is in his second spell at Pittodrie and the only starting survivor from a Glass side that put Hacken out of the Conference League in 2021. The Dons opened up with a 5-1 home win and although the Swedes mounted a mini revival in Gothenburg, it wasn‚Äôt enough. This time they got a morale-boosting draw on the road and want to finish the tie at home. Hayes said: ‚ÄúIt feels like a lifetime ago, even though it was only a couple of years. It shows when things haven‚Äôt gone too well at a club, there‚Äôs a need for change. ‚ÄúIt also highlights we‚Äôre always trying to progress and be better. We were really good that night. It was different to what the manager is working on now but as a player you appreciate those moments you work on in training coming to fruition on the pitch. ‚ÄúIt clicked that night but it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. The result caught us a little by surprise but the performance was one we expected. This one will be end to end. They like to attack with pace and we like to go forward too. I‚Äôm not saying this because we scored two goals but the second half was one of the best halves of football I‚Äôve watched live in a long time. ‚ÄúThe fitness side can sway a game. For me, it was more about the mentality and character to get back into the game. We knew we‚Äôd get a second after we scored and had we had five more minutes, I‚Äôm sure a third would‚Äôve come. \"There are some games where you have to take your medicine, you don‚Äôt have the ball but keep going and never say die.

The Brazil international returned to familiar territory as then Blues boss Antonio Conte shuffled his pack with full-back Marcos Alonso also arriving from Fiorentina as midfielder Juan Cuadrado joined Juventus on loan. Luiz, then 23, had initially joined Chelsea from Portuguese side Benfica in a deal worth up to ¬£25million in January 2011. He had arrived at Stamford Bridge on the same day as striker Fernando Torres , who cost the reigning champions ¬£50million ‚Äì a record transfer fee between British clubs ‚Äì when they lured him away from Liverpool. The defender made 143 appearances in his first spell and won the Champions League, Europa League and the FA Cup before Paris St Germain paid ¬£50million for his services in June 2014 with then Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho preferring to use Gary Cahill and John Terry at the heart of his rearguard. Luiz‚Äôs time in France proved hugely successful as PSG dominated on the domestic front, but after two seasons at the Parc des Princes, he could not resist the opportunity to renew his acquaintance with English football. Speaking as his return to the Blues was confirmed, he told the club‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm delighted to return to Chelsea. We had a fantastic story during my first time at the club and I want to help the team and Antonio Conte achieve a lot of success. ‚ÄúI always had a wonderful relationship with the fans and I am looking forward to wearing the blue shirt at Stamford Bridge once again.‚Äù Over the length of his three-year contract, Luiz added a league title, an FA Cup and another Europa League trophy to his tally before making a shock ‚Äì and for some, controversial ‚Äì ¬£8million move to derby rivals Arsenal in August 2019 after indicating his desire to leave.

But he accepts he is still at the start of a football journey, the next step of which could be taken in Scotland, although there is no shortage of interest in him across the continent. ‚ÄúI do have some similarities with Rui Costa I suppose in style,‚Äù Bernardo said. \"But you have to remember I am just taking my very first openings in football. ‚ÄúMy debut for Benfica for the first team was the first step and my dream is to one day play for Portugal at a World Cup. But I am only young. I want to play, have fun and work to get my opportunities. \"My hero and the player I base my game on was Enzo Perez, when he was at Benfica. I‚Äôd love to play in a role like him as a free attacking midfielder.‚Äù Paiva reckons that wherever Bernardo ends up, he will shine as brightly as the name of the stadium he will leave behind. And that eventually, Benfica will make an absolute fortune on the boy he developed as a pre-teen into a budding superstar by impressing on him the need to add goals to his undoubted talent in the middle of the park. ‚ÄúPaulo had a beautiful history with us,‚Äù Paiva said recently. ‚ÄúHe was identified at Benfica as an elite midfielder, but I told him there was a difference between an elite midfielder and a high-quality midfielder, scoring goals. ‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt score goals, he would never become an elite midfielder. The truth is that Paulo, being the intelligent kid that he is, knew how to listen, be patient and work accordingly. ‚ÄúI left but I‚Äôm delighted whenever I see Paulo‚Äôs goals, because I remembered this story and he knows it‚Äôs true. What I can assess is Paulo‚Äôs potential and this is never-ending. \"And I said after leaving, Paulo could be the future biggest sale of Benfica. I see Paulo, with respect and affection to everyone else, this way. ‚ÄúI said this in the past about Joao Felix, and now I‚Äôm saying this about Paulo. I feel he‚Äôs different. If he stays healthy, he will give a lot of sporting and financial income to Benfica.‚Äù Joao Felix in action at the World Cup (Image: Offside via Getty Images) If Bernardo does find his way to Parkhead before the transfer window closes on Friday night, Paiva believes the Portugal U21 star will cope with anything that comes his way. He added: ‚ÄúBesides the quality he has, one fundamental thing is the mental aspect at this stage. ‚ÄúPaulo is a super-reserved kid. I‚Äôve already told him he must speak louder and more often, but I also think it helps him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs focused. On the field he changes and his football speaks for him and he‚Äôs becoming a leader. But outside it he‚Äôs a reserved kid, humble and very quiet, but focused on what he wants. ‚ÄúHe has everything to be an elite player, there are no extravagances or distractions. He‚Äôs highly intelligent, he knows what he wants, he knows how to listen, which is a great virtue. That‚Äôs how he got to where he has and how I think he will get to where he‚Äôs going.‚Äù Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.

To top it off, the former AJAX Footy Club junior and King David School graduate also won the AFLPA‚Äôs 2023 Best First Year Player award. Remarkably, Sheezel was tasked at the beginning of the season, by Roos head coach Alastair Clarkson, to play in the unfamiliar position of half back, rather than his usual half forward spot he‚Äôd played in for AJAX, the Sandringham Dragons, and Vic Metro. Taking hold of that new challenge with both hands, the 2022 AFL Draft number 3 pick averaged 27.0 disposals per game, and made the most disposals (622) by any player in their debut AFL season ever. In his Rising Star award acceptance speech, in front of Clarkson, his parents, and the who‚Äôs who of the AFL, Sheezel thanked his family, and especially his parents, Dean and Lana, for all they‚Äôve done to help him achieve what he has in the sport. ‚ÄúFrom day one, they‚Äôve done so much, and care so much for me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so passionate about football as well, which makes it even better, because I kind of live it with them. ‚ÄúThe support they‚Äôve shown to me, especially this year, has been incredible.‚Äù In an AFL press conference this morning, Sheezel reflected, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt too sure what to espect [in the half back role] at the start of the year, to be honest, but it worked out pretty well, and I love that role now ‚Äì you get a lot of freedom back there.‚Äù He said he also put his full trust in coach Alastair Clarkson putting him in the half back role, describing ‚ÄòClarko‚Äô as having ‚Äúan unbelievable football brain‚Äù. On receiving the award, Sheezel commented, ‚ÄúI think I had that belief and confidence earlier in the year, and the award was kind of a result of that‚Äù. ‚ÄúEvery week I‚Äôd just try and have that confidence that I belong at this level, and try to play my best every week, and so it was good to get recognised. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not too sure where I‚Äôll play [on the field next season]. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm definitely working on my leadership, and trying to drive the group.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-08-31 05:43:35","image_url":"https://static.timesofisrael.com/ajn/uploads/2023/08/20230831001836488282_31545-1024x640.jpeg","source_id":"australianjewishnews","source_priority":511030,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"12fe763306ed48ba6d7753a041a58c13","title":"Top-age contest","link":"https://borderwatch.com.au/sport/2023/08/31/top-age-contest/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Hui Jin"],"video_url":null,"description":"UNDER 18 ‚Äì SOUTH GAMBIER v NORTH GAMBIER AN anticipated match-up awaits in the Western Border Under 18 football qualifying [‚Ä¶] The post Top-age contest appeared first on The Border Watch.","content":"James Murphy UNDER 18 ‚Äì SOUTH GAMBIER v NORTH GAMBIER AN anticipated match-up awaits in the Western Border Under 18 football qualifying final.

The 36-year-old Irishman will get the chance to follow in their footsteps and is determined it will be in the continent‚Äôs second-tier competition once again. It is 16 years since Darren Mackie headed home in a 1-1 draw with Dnipro that sent Jimmy Calderwood‚Äôs Dons into the UEFA Cup group stage. It saw them face Atletico Madrid, Panathinaikos, Copenhagen and Lokomotiv Moscow before mighty Bayern Munich in the knockout stages. Since then, Aberdeen teams have tried and failed to repeat the feat. Hayes was involved when Derek McInnes‚Äô side qualified for Europe eight years in a row and then again under Stephen Glass, only to fail to get beyond the qualifiers. Now Barry Robson‚Äôs crop know if they beat BK Hacken at Pittodrie tonight, they will be in the Europa League groups. If they don‚Äôt, the same stage of the Conference League looms. Hayes said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had two, three or four rounds of qualifying before, had tough draws and fallen that little bit short. I‚Äôve always been envious a little of the 2007-08 squad that played Dnipro. I wish we had one play-off game, regardless of the opposition, to prepare for.

Some years we had some really tough draws. We had Groningen and Real Sociedad in one season, which was really tough. ‚ÄúThe game that took us most by surprise was probably Shkendija in 2015. They played well but Niall McGinn scored and we went through on away goals. ‚ÄúThese teams are all technically really good.

The Dons opened up with a 5-1 home win and although the Swedes mounted a mini revival in Gothenburg, it wasn‚Äôt enough. This time they got a morale-boosting draw on the road and want to finish the tie at home. Hayes said: ‚ÄúIt feels like a lifetime ago, even though it was only a couple of years. It shows when things haven‚Äôt gone too well at a club, there‚Äôs a need for change. ‚ÄúIt also highlights we‚Äôre always trying to progress and be better. We were really good that night. It was different to what the manager is working on now but as a player you appreciate those moments you work on in training coming to fruition on the pitch. ‚ÄúIt clicked that night but it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. The result caught us a little by surprise but the performance was one we expected. This one will be end to end. They like to attack with pace and we like to go forward too. I‚Äôm not saying this because we scored two goals but the second half was one of the best halves of football I‚Äôve watched live in a long time. ‚ÄúThe fitness side can sway a game. For me, it was more about the mentality and character to get back into the game. We knew we‚Äôd get a second after we scored and had we had five more minutes, I‚Äôm sure a third would‚Äôve come. \"There are some games where you have to take your medicine, you don‚Äôt have the ball but keep going and never say die.

Luiz, then 23, had initially joined Chelsea from Portuguese side Benfica in a deal worth up to ¬£25million in January 2011. He had arrived at Stamford Bridge on the same day as striker Fernando Torres , who cost the reigning champions ¬£50million ‚Äì a record transfer fee between British clubs ‚Äì when they lured him away from Liverpool.

We had a fantastic story during my first time at the club and I want to help the team and Antonio Conte achieve a lot of success. ‚ÄúI always had a wonderful relationship with the fans and I am looking forward to wearing the blue shirt at Stamford Bridge once again.‚Äù Over the length of his three-year contract, Luiz added a league title, an FA Cup and another Europa League trophy to his tally before making a shock ‚Äì and for some, controversial ‚Äì ¬£8million move to derby rivals Arsenal in August 2019 after indicating his desire to leave.

Ruben Dias, Joao Cancelo, Renato Sanches, Bernardo Silva, Helder Costa and Joao Felix to name just some over the course of his 18 years overseeing the development of young talent at a club that rivals Ajax as being among the best on the planet at producing world-class footballers. So when Paiva, now the head coach of Bahia in Brazil, casts his mind back over the kids he coached at Benfica‚Äôs incredible Seixal training campus and pinpoints Paulo Bernardo as the one whose potential has no limits, it‚Äôs worth taking his opinion seriously. And when the possibility of this kid playing his football in Scotland with Celtic this season arises, Paiva‚Äôs comments on him should fill Parkhead fans with hope they will soon be witnessing someone pretty special from the same academy that gave the Jota . Bernardo, at 21, has already made 17 appearances for Benfica‚Äôs first team but after being farmed out to Pacos de Ferreira in the second half of last term, is not part of current boss Roger Schmidt‚Äôs plans for this season. The Portuguese giants ‚Äì nicknames The Eagles ‚Äì are, however, ready to sanction another loan deal for the player who is under contract until 2027 and is highly enough rated to have a ¬£90million buyout clause built into it.

The youngster doesn‚Äôt shy away from the comparison ‚Äì although his idol is former Argentina and Benfica midfielder Enzo Perez. But he accepts he is still at the start of a football journey, the next step of which could be taken in Scotland, although there is no shortage of interest in him across the continent. ‚ÄúI do have some similarities with Rui Costa I suppose in style,‚Äù Bernardo said. \"But you have to remember I am just taking my very first openings in football. ‚ÄúMy debut for Benfica for the first team was the first step and my dream is to one day play for Portugal at a World Cup. But I am only young. I want to play, have fun and work to get my opportunities. \"My hero and the player I base my game on was Enzo Perez, when he was at Benfica. I‚Äôd love to play in a role like him as a free attacking midfielder.‚Äù Paiva reckons that wherever Bernardo ends up, he will shine as brightly as the name of the stadium he will leave behind. And that eventually, Benfica will make an absolute fortune on the boy he developed as a pre-teen into a budding superstar by impressing on him the need to add goals to his undoubted talent in the middle of the park. ‚ÄúPaulo had a beautiful history with us,‚Äù Paiva said recently. ‚ÄúHe was identified at Benfica as an elite midfielder, but I told him there was a difference between an elite midfielder and a high-quality midfielder, scoring goals. ‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt score goals, he would never become an elite midfielder. The truth is that Paulo, being the intelligent kid that he is, knew how to listen, be patient and work accordingly. ‚ÄúI left but I‚Äôm delighted whenever I see Paulo‚Äôs goals, because I remembered this story and he knows it‚Äôs true. What I can assess is Paulo‚Äôs potential and this is never-ending. \"And I said after leaving, Paulo could be the future biggest sale of Benfica. I see Paulo, with respect and affection to everyone else, this way. ‚ÄúI said this in the past about Joao Felix, and now I‚Äôm saying this about Paulo. I feel he‚Äôs different. If he stays healthy, he will give a lot of sporting and financial income to Benfica.‚Äù Joao Felix in action at the World Cup (Image: Offside via Getty Images) If Bernardo does find his way to Parkhead before the transfer window closes on Friday night, Paiva believes the Portugal U21 star will cope with anything that comes his way. He added: ‚ÄúBesides the quality he has, one fundamental thing is the mental aspect at this stage. ‚ÄúPaulo is a super-reserved kid. I‚Äôve already told him he must speak louder and more often, but I also think it helps him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs focused. On the field he changes and his football speaks for him and he‚Äôs becoming a leader. But outside it he‚Äôs a reserved kid, humble and very quiet, but focused on what he wants. ‚ÄúHe has everything to be an elite player, there are no extravagances or distractions. He‚Äôs highly intelligent, he knows what he wants, he knows how to listen, which is a great virtue. That‚Äôs how he got to where he has and how I think he will get to where he‚Äôs going.‚Äù Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.

To top it off, the former AJAX Footy Club junior and King David School graduate also won the AFLPA‚Äôs 2023 Best First Year Player award. Remarkably, Sheezel was tasked at the beginning of the season, by Roos head coach Alastair Clarkson, to play in the unfamiliar position of half back, rather than his usual half forward spot he‚Äôd played in for AJAX, the Sandringham Dragons, and Vic Metro. Taking hold of that new challenge with both hands, the 2022 AFL Draft number 3 pick averaged 27.0 disposals per game, and made the most disposals (622) by any player in their debut AFL season ever. In his Rising Star award acceptance speech, in front of Clarkson, his parents, and the who‚Äôs who of the AFL, Sheezel thanked his family, and especially his parents, Dean and Lana, for all they‚Äôve done to help him achieve what he has in the sport. ‚ÄúFrom day one, they‚Äôve done so much, and care so much for me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so passionate about football as well, which makes it even better, because I kind of live it with them. ‚ÄúThe support they‚Äôve shown to me, especially this year, has been incredible.‚Äù In an AFL press conference this morning, Sheezel reflected, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt too sure what to espect [in the half back role] at the start of the year, to be honest, but it worked out pretty well, and I love that role now ‚Äì you get a lot of freedom back there.‚Äù He said he also put his full trust in coach Alastair Clarkson putting him in the half back role, describing ‚ÄòClarko‚Äô as having ‚Äúan unbelievable football brain‚Äù.

The Dons opened up with a 5-1 home win and although the Swedes mounted a mini revival in Gothenburg, it wasn‚Äôt enough. This time they got a morale-boosting draw on the road and want to finish the tie at home. Hayes said: ‚ÄúIt feels like a lifetime ago, even though it was only a couple of years. It shows when things haven‚Äôt gone too well at a club, there‚Äôs a need for change. ‚ÄúIt also highlights we‚Äôre always trying to progress and be better. We were really good that night. It was different to what the manager is working on now but as a player you appreciate those moments you work on in training coming to fruition on the pitch. ‚ÄúIt clicked that night but it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. The result caught us a little by surprise but the performance was one we expected. This one will be end to end. They like to attack with pace and we like to go forward too. I‚Äôm not saying this because we scored two goals but the second half was one of the best halves of football I‚Äôve watched live in a long time. ‚ÄúThe fitness side can sway a game. For me, it was more about the mentality and character to get back into the game. We knew we‚Äôd get a second after we scored and had we had five more minutes, I‚Äôm sure a third would‚Äôve come. \"There are some games where you have to take your medicine, you don‚Äôt have the ball but keep going and never say die. That‚Äôs what the manager demands. You have to show the mentality that you want to win every game.‚Äù Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

The Brazil international returned to familiar territory as then Blues boss Antonio Conte shuffled his pack with full-back Marcos Alonso also arriving from Fiorentina as midfielder Juan Cuadrado joined Juventus on loan. Luiz, then 23, had initially joined Chelsea from Portuguese side Benfica in a deal worth up to ¬£25million in January 2011. He had arrived at Stamford Bridge on the same day as striker Fernando Torres , who cost the reigning champions ¬£50million ‚Äì a record transfer fee between British clubs ‚Äì when they lured him away from Liverpool. The defender made 143 appearances in his first spell and won the Champions League, Europa League and the FA Cup before Paris St Germain paid ¬£50million for his services in June 2014 with then Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho preferring to use Gary Cahill and John Terry at the heart of his rearguard. Luiz‚Äôs time in France proved hugely successful as PSG dominated on the domestic front, but after two seasons at the Parc des Princes, he could not resist the opportunity to renew his acquaintance with English football. Speaking as his return to the Blues was confirmed, he told the club‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm delighted to return to Chelsea. We had a fantastic story during my first time at the club and I want to help the team and Antonio Conte achieve a lot of success. ‚ÄúI always had a wonderful relationship with the fans and I am looking forward to wearing the blue shirt at Stamford Bridge once again.‚Äù Over the length of his three-year contract, Luiz added a league title, an FA Cup and another Europa League trophy to his tally before making a shock ‚Äì and for some, controversial ‚Äì ¬£8million move to derby rivals Arsenal in August 2019 after indicating his desire to leave. Luiz spent two seasons at the Emirates Stadium and, now 36, is currently playing his club football with Flamengo in Brazil‚Äôs Serie A.","pubDate":"2023-08-31 05:00:00","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/08/31/06/0994f7b3f2445ae81f4bca0cf28db497Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjkzNDY2NjA0-2.43203005.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d3701c93b7a2095aa95126400e5d3b4a","title":"Paulo Bernardo is Celtic transfer target with unlimited potential as Benfica mentor ranks golden boy with Joao Felix","link":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/paulo-bernardo-celtic-transfer-target-30825779","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["reporters@dailyrecord.co.uk (David McCarthy)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The midfielder's mentor has spoken in glowing terms about the man Celtic are believed to be after.","content":"Paulo Bernardo Get the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter More Newsletters Subscribe Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.

Ruben Dias, Joao Cancelo, Renato Sanches, Bernardo Silva, Helder Costa and Joao Felix to name just some over the course of his 18 years overseeing the development of young talent at a club that rivals Ajax as being among the best on the planet at producing world-class footballers. So when Paiva, now the head coach of Bahia in Brazil, casts his mind back over the kids he coached at Benfica‚Äôs incredible Seixal training campus and pinpoints Paulo Bernardo as the one whose potential has no limits, it‚Äôs worth taking his opinion seriously. And when the possibility of this kid playing his football in Scotland with Celtic this season arises, Paiva‚Äôs comments on him should fill Parkhead fans with hope they will soon be witnessing someone pretty special from the same academy that gave the Jota . Bernardo, at 21, has already made 17 appearances for Benfica‚Äôs first team but after being farmed out to Pacos de Ferreira in the second half of last term, is not part of current boss Roger Schmidt‚Äôs plans for this season. The Portuguese giants ‚Äì nicknames The Eagles ‚Äì are, however, ready to sanction another loan deal for the player who is under contract until 2027 and is highly enough rated to have a ¬£90million buyout clause built into it.

The youngster doesn‚Äôt shy away from the comparison ‚Äì although his idol is former Argentina and Benfica midfielder Enzo Perez. But he accepts he is still at the start of a football journey, the next step of which could be taken in Scotland, although there is no shortage of interest in him across the continent. ‚ÄúI do have some similarities with Rui Costa I suppose in style,‚Äù Bernardo said. \"But you have to remember I am just taking my very first openings in football. ‚ÄúMy debut for Benfica for the first team was the first step and my dream is to one day play for Portugal at a World Cup. But I am only young. I want to play, have fun and work to get my opportunities. \"My hero and the player I base my game on was Enzo Perez, when he was at Benfica. I‚Äôd love to play in a role like him as a free attacking midfielder.‚Äù Paiva reckons that wherever Bernardo ends up, he will shine as brightly as the name of the stadium he will leave behind. And that eventually, Benfica will make an absolute fortune on the boy he developed as a pre-teen into a budding superstar by impressing on him the need to add goals to his undoubted talent in the middle of the park. ‚ÄúPaulo had a beautiful history with us,‚Äù Paiva said recently. ‚ÄúHe was identified at Benfica as an elite midfielder, but I told him there was a difference between an elite midfielder and a high-quality midfielder, scoring goals. ‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt score goals, he would never become an elite midfielder. The truth is that Paulo, being the intelligent kid that he is, knew how to listen, be patient and work accordingly. ‚ÄúI left but I‚Äôm delighted whenever I see Paulo‚Äôs goals, because I remembered this story and he knows it‚Äôs true. What I can assess is Paulo‚Äôs potential and this is never-ending. \"And I said after leaving, Paulo could be the future biggest sale of Benfica. I see Paulo, with respect and affection to everyone else, this way. ‚ÄúI said this in the past about Joao Felix, and now I‚Äôm saying this about Paulo. I feel he‚Äôs different. If he stays healthy, he will give a lot of sporting and financial income to Benfica.‚Äù Joao Felix in action at the World Cup (Image: Offside via Getty Images) If Bernardo does find his way to Parkhead before the transfer window closes on Friday night, Paiva believes the Portugal U21 star will cope with anything that comes his way. He added: ‚ÄúBesides the quality he has, one fundamental thing is the mental aspect at this stage. ‚ÄúPaulo is a super-reserved kid. I‚Äôve already told him he must speak louder and more often, but I also think it helps him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs focused. On the field he changes and his football speaks for him and he‚Äôs becoming a leader. But outside it he‚Äôs a reserved kid, humble and very quiet, but focused on what he wants. ‚ÄúHe has everything to be an elite player, there are no extravagances or distractions. He‚Äôs highly intelligent, he knows what he wants, he knows how to listen, which is a great virtue. That‚Äôs how he got to where he has and how I think he will get to where he‚Äôs going.‚Äù Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.
