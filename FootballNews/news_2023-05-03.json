Sergio Contreras, better known as Koke, agreed to a plea deal at a court in Malaga after being warned state prosecutors were seeking to have him imprisoned for 16 years ahead of his trial. The ex-striker, whose clubs included Malaga , Olympique de Marseille and Sporting CP in Portugal, was one of 17 defendants accused of buying large amounts of drugs that were smuggled in lorries into different European countries. Koke had been described in a pre-trial indictment as the gang leader. The drugs were mainly marihuana and cannabis resin but also included cocaine. The gang Koke has now admitted he led was smashed in November 2019 following a police operation codenamed Operation Vinculada that involved wiretaps and undercover follows. One of the drug runs linked to the ex-footballer’s gang, consisting of vacuum-packed marihuana and cocaine hidden inside a cargo of garlic, was valued at £350,000. All 16 of the defendants who showed up for a trial at Malaga’s Provincial Court on March 27, which ended up being suspended following a no-show by a 17th female defendant police are still hunting, admitted their guilt at a brief hearing on Tuesday. As part of the plea bargain deals they struck following a subsequent period of negotiation between state prosecutors and their defence lawyers, they have agreed to accept prison sentences of between two and six years reflecting their different responsibilities in the gang. Jail sentences for first-time offenders in Spain normally end up being suspended. Koke, 40, started his footballing career at hometown club Malaga, making six first-team appearances after graduating from the club's academy. He went on to join Olympique de Marseille, initially on loan, before being loaned to Sporting CP. He then produced the best football of his career in years at Greek side Aris, where the first of his two spells there included a brief cameo in a 2011 3-0 Europa League defeat to Manchester City . The forward retired from football in 2016 following a brief second stint in Greece during which he scored one goal in three appearances. Koke's globetrotting career spanned nine countries and three continents, as he played in Spain, France, Portugal, Greece, the United States, Azerbaijan, Germany, Bolivia and India.

Xhaka had a strong game for the Gunners, assisting both of Martin Odegaard’s goals in their commanding 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium. Gabriel Jesus added a third to have the game wrapped up in the 34th minute and Noni Madueke’s consultation goal did little to take the shine off things. The win gave Arsenal a much-needed boost and, more importantly, ended a run of four games without victory to send them back to the top of the Premier League table. Xhaka was selected for post-match media duties, appearing live on Sky Sports to discuss the game. He appeared alongside presenter Dave Jones and pundits Patrick Vieira, Cesc Fabregas and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to answer questions. But it wasn’t what he said that caught the attention, rather what he was wearing . Xhaka had put on an Arsenal club jacket to keep warm on the pitch, but he wasn’t wearing his own. Instead he donned the jacket of Tom Geeson-Brown, Arsenal’s first team performance nutritionist, whose initials of TGB sparked comments online. “Xhaka rocking a Tottenham Get Battered top,” wrote one fan. Another added: “Proper s***housery from Xhaka! TOTTENHAM GET BATTERED everywhere they gooo! TGB.” HAVE YOUR SAY! What do you make of Granit Xhaka's choice of jacket? Comment below . “When I saw the post match interviews, I didn’t think of it but this is amazing,” another added. “Wow it's just brilliant,” concluded another. The initials appeared to mirror a favourite song of the Arsenal fans, who have had plenty of reason to sing it of late. Spurs are without a win from their last eight away matches in all competitions, having lost six and drawn two of those games, conceding 21 goals. Xhaka focused on Arsenal in his interview after the win sent them back past Manchester City into first place, albeit having played two games more. “As a team, we put in a good effort today after the four games we didn’t win, and I think we needed the three points. It was very important,” he said. “We needed a reaction for the fans, for ourselves as well to come back with confidence and hopefully we can continue like this for the next four games.” He earned lots of praise from former Arsenal midfielders Vieira and Fabreas. “He is a top player. I had a chance to spend a bit of time with him off the field and he loves this football club,” Vieira said. \"He is passionate on the field and that passion, he needs to share it around with the other players to take as well more responsibility. I hope that fire inside him, he will keep it, because that makes him as a player.\" Fabregas agreed, adding: \"I think he’s got the same passion but he’s not rash like before,\" he added. \"He’s not committing into challenges he cannot win.”","pubDate":"2023-05-03 10:44:58","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29877769.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GX2.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Моурінью: У Мілані Шевченко був як принц","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/03/928379/mourinyu-u-milani-shevchenko-buv-yak-prynts","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Колишній головний тренер Челсі Жозе Моурінью не пріоритезував підписання форварда Мілана Андрія Шевченка.Про це португалець розповів для документального серіалу від Paramount+.\"Шевченко не був моїм першим вибором.

Mudryk was greeted with boos by the Emirates crowd during his introduction as a second-half substitute in Arsenal’s 3-1 win. The Ukraine international was heavily linked with the Gunners during the January transfer window but signed for the Blues instead. TV cameras showed green lights being flashed in his face on multiple occasions. An Arsenal statement on Wednesday morning read: “An arrest has been made following the use of a laser during last night’s match. “This behaviour is dangerous and totally unacceptable, and we will fully support the police with their enquiries. We will obviously take the strongest possible action.” Meanwhile, Mudryk responded to the incident on Instagram by saying: “It’s OK.” The Gunners made light work of their London rivals at the Emirates to return to the top of the Premier League. The game was over 34 minutes, in truth, with Arsenal scoring three times through Martin Odegaard’s double and Gabriel Jesus’ poacher’s finish. Noni Madueke grabbed one back in the second-half but it was too little too late as Frank Lampard tasted defeat for a sixth time in a row since arriving at Chelsea . Mudryk brought some much-needed pace to Chelsea’s attack and the visitors looked somewhat better after an embarrassing first-half . The winger was also met with chants of ‘you’ve should have signed for Arsenal’ after missing out in January. Mikel Arteta was desperate to sign the 22-year-old earlier in the campaign but Shakhtar demanded a hefty fee. In the end, Chelsea swooped in with a £62million bid, with £26.5m in add-ons, landing the Ukrainian ahead of their London rivals. However, Mudryk has had a tough start to life in England and has registered just two assists in 14 appearances for the Blues. The loss makes it eight in a row in all competitions for Chelsea, and six in a row since Lampard took over. Lasers being shined on Mykhailo Mudryk’s face at the Emirates 🚨 pic.twitter.com/CxoUZ4kzAO It leaves them 12th in the Premier League and nine points above the relegation zone – while Thomas Tuchel’s ten points he earned before getting the chop now look like they could save Chelsea’s season. Lampard’s men take on Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest next in what must be construed as must-win games or risk tumbling further down the table. And with Manchester City, Newcastle and Manchester United left to play, it remains to be seen whether Chelsea will earn another point this season.","pubDate":"2023-05-03 10:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Шахтар - Минай: де дивитися онлайн матч 24 туру УПЛ 03.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/03/928278/shakhtar-mynay-de-dyvytysya-match-upl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 24-го туру УПЛ донецький Шахтар зіграє з Минаєм.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у середу, 3 травня.

Xhaka had a strong game for the Gunners, assisting both of Martin Odegaard’s goals in their commanding 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium. Gabriel Jesus added a third to have the game wrapped up in the 34th minute and Noni Madueke’s consultation goal did little to take the shine off things. The win gave Arsenal a much-needed boost and, more importantly, ended a run of four games without victory to send them back to the top of the Premier League table. Xhaka was selected for post-match media duties, appearing live on Sky Sports to discuss the game. He appeared alongside presenter Dave Jones and pundits Patrick Vieira, Cesc Fabregas and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to answer questions. But it wasn’t what he said that caught the attention, rather what he was wearing . Xhaka had put on an Arsenal club jacket to keep warm on the pitch, but he wasn’t wearing his own. Instead he donned the jacket of Tom Geeson-Brown, Arsenal’s first team performance nutritionist, whose initials of TGB sparked comments online. “Xhaka rocking a Tottenham Get Battered top,” wrote one fan.

The initials appeared to mirror a favourite song of the Arsenal fans, who have had plenty of reason to sing it of late. Spurs are without a win from their last eight away matches in all competitions, having lost six and drawn two of those games, conceding 21 goals. Xhaka focused on Arsenal in his interview after the win sent them back past Manchester City into first place, albeit having played two games more. “As a team, we put in a good effort today after the four games we didn’t win, and I think we needed the three points. It was very important,” he said. “We needed a reaction for the fans, for ourselves as well to come back with confidence and hopefully we can continue like this for the next four games.” He earned lots of praise from former Arsenal midfielders Vieira and Fabreas. “He is a top player. I had a chance to spend a bit of time with him off the field and he loves this football club,” Vieira said. \"He is passionate on the field and that passion, he needs to share it around with the other players to take as well more responsibility.

Mudryk was greeted with boos by the Emirates crowd during his introduction as a second-half substitute in Arsenal’s 3-1 win. The Ukraine international was heavily linked with the Gunners during the January transfer window but signed for the Blues instead. TV cameras showed green lights being flashed in his face on multiple occasions. An Arsenal statement on Wednesday morning read: “An arrest has been made following the use of a laser during last night’s match. “This behaviour is dangerous and totally unacceptable, and we will fully support the police with their enquiries. We will obviously take the strongest possible action.” Meanwhile, Mudryk responded to the incident on Instagram by saying: “It’s OK.” The Gunners made light work of their London rivals at the Emirates to return to the top of the Premier League. The game was over 34 minutes, in truth, with Arsenal scoring three times through Martin Odegaard’s double and Gabriel Jesus’ poacher’s finish. Noni Madueke grabbed one back in the second-half but it was too little too late as Frank Lampard tasted defeat for a sixth time in a row since arriving at Chelsea . Mudryk brought some much-needed pace to Chelsea’s attack and the visitors looked somewhat better after an embarrassing first-half . The winger was also met with chants of ‘you’ve should have signed for Arsenal’ after missing out in January. Mikel Arteta was desperate to sign the 22-year-old earlier in the campaign but Shakhtar demanded a hefty fee. In the end, Chelsea swooped in with a £62million bid, with £26.5m in add-ons, landing the Ukrainian ahead of their London rivals. However, Mudryk has had a tough start to life in England and has registered just two assists in 14 appearances for the Blues. The loss makes it eight in a row in all competitions for Chelsea, and six in a row since Lampard took over. Lasers being shined on Mykhailo Mudryk’s face at the Emirates 🚨 pic.twitter.com/CxoUZ4kzAO It leaves them 12th in the Premier League and nine points above the relegation zone – while Thomas Tuchel’s ten points he earned before getting the chop now look like they could save Chelsea’s season. Lampard’s men take on Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest next in what must be construed as must-win games or risk tumbling further down the table. And with Manchester City, Newcastle and Manchester United left to play, it remains to be seen whether Chelsea will earn another point this season.","pubDate":"2023-05-03 10:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Шахтар - Минай: де дивитися онлайн матч 24 туру УПЛ 03.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/03/928278/shakhtar-mynay-de-dyvytysya-match-upl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 24-го туру УПЛ донецький Шахтар зіграє з Минаєм.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у середу, 3 травня.

Arsenal returned to winning ways on Tuesday night with an impressive 3-1 victory against Chelsea , but Manchester City are still in pole position to clinch their fifth title in six years after beating the Gunners at the Etihad last week. Mikel Arteta refused to give up hope of overhauling Guardiola and co after their big win on Tuesday night - even though City have two games in hand on their rivals. But Guardiola has now sensationally written off Arsenal's chances of ending their 19-year title drought and claimed that fans should be \"so happy\" that their multi-year exile from the Champions League will end next year. Speaking ahead of City's match against West Ham on Wednesday night, Guardiola told Sky Sports: \"Arsenal have already achieved Champions League qualification after seven years. Maybe the mood there is a bit down. \"[But] after seven years they won the most important title of the season for the club – to qualify next season for the Champions League. Because financially, it is prestigious, new signings. For many reasons it is the most important title, by far, and it is already there. \"They lost the last game [against Man City] and they are sad, but I am pretty sure they have to be so happy because they make an incredible achievement.\" Join the debate! Arsenal fans: do you agree with Guardiola's comments on the Champions League? Let us know here. Arsenal last played in the Champions League six years ago and had aims of ending that run after missing out on the top-four in the final weeks of the 2021/22 campaign. However, the consolation prize of European football is unlikely to soften the blow for fans who have seen the Gunners blow a commanding eight-point lead in the title race since the start of April. Guardiola's comments come just days after Arteta insisted that Arsenal were \"not satisfied\" with securing Champions League football for next year. The Spaniard said: \"We are in the Champions League and everyone is still unsatisfied with the situation. This is what we need to move forward as a club and a team. \"We are Arsenal football club. We have to be here to win every single trophy. The demands have to be there.\" After dropping points in four successive games, Arsenal's win over Chelsea was enough to life them back above Manchester City at the summit of the Premier League . However, victory for Guardiola's side against West Ham at the Etihad will put City right back on top.","pubDate":"2023-05-03 13:13:41","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29880483.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-135116.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former LaLiga star accepts six-year prison sentence after leading drug trafficking ring","link":"https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/laliga-prison-drug-trafficking-koke-29880024","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["news@irishmirror.ie (Gerard Couzens)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Koke, full name Sergio Contreras, played for boyhood club Malaga, Marseille and Sporting Lisbon across a globetrotting career which spanned nine countries and three continents","content":"A LaLiga footballer has accepted a six-year prison sentence after being accused of leading a drug trafficking ring. Sergio Contreras, better known as Koke, agreed to a plea deal at a court in Malaga after being warned state prosecutors were seeking to have him imprisoned for 16 years ahead of his trial. The ex-striker, whose clubs included Malaga , Olympique de Marseille and Sporting CP in Portugal, was one of 17 defendants accused of buying large amounts of drugs that were smuggled in lorries into different European countries. Koke had been described in a pre-trial indictment as the gang leader. The drugs were mainly marihuana and cannabis resin but also included cocaine. The gang Koke has now admitted he led was smashed in November 2019 following a police operation codenamed Operation Vinculada that involved wiretaps and undercover follows. One of the drug runs linked to the ex-footballer’s gang, consisting of vacuum-packed marihuana and cocaine hidden inside a cargo of garlic, was valued at £350,000. All 16 of the defendants who showed up for a trial at Malaga’s Provincial Court on March 27, which ended up being suspended following a no-show by a 17th female defendant police are still hunting, admitted their guilt at a brief hearing on Tuesday. As part of the plea bargain deals they struck following a subsequent period of negotiation between state prosecutors and their defence lawyers, they have agreed to accept prison sentences of between two and six years reflecting their different responsibilities in the gang. Jail sentences for first-time offenders in Spain normally end up being suspended. Koke, 40, started his footballing career at hometown club Malaga, making six first-team appearances after graduating from the club's academy. He went on to join Olympique de Marseille, initially on loan, before being loaned to Sporting CP. He then produced the best football of his career in years at Greek side Aris, where the first of his two spells there included a brief cameo in a 2011 3-0 Europa League defeat to Manchester City . The forward retired from football in 2016 following a brief second stint in Greece during which he scored one goal in three appearances. Koke's globetrotting career spanned nine countries and three continents, as he played in Spain, France, Portugal, Greece, the United States, Azerbaijan, Germany, Bolivia and India. At both Malaga and Marseille he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup.","pubDate":"2023-05-03 12:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29879350.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_GettyImages-93029540.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Шахтар мінімально переграв Минай у 24 турі УПЛ","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/03/928383/shakhtar-minimalno-perehrav-mynay-u-24-turi-upl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Шахтар здобув мінімальну перемогу над Минаєм у межах 24-го туру УПЛ.Матч завершився з рахунком 1:0.

I hope that fire inside him, he will keep it, because that makes him as a player.\" Fabregas agreed, adding: \"I think he’s got the same passion but he’s not rash like before,\" he added. \"He’s not committing into challenges he cannot win.”","pubDate":"2023-05-03 10:44:58","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29877769.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GX2.jpg","source_id":"irishmirror","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Моурінью: У Мілані Шевченко був як принц","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/03/928379/mourinyu-u-milani-shevchenko-buv-yak-prynts","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Колишній головний тренер Челсі Жозе Моурінью не пріоритезував підписання форварда Мілана Андрія Шевченка.Про це португалець розповів для документального серіалу від Paramount+.\"Шевченко не був моїм першим вибором.

Mudryk was greeted with boos by the Emirates crowd during his introduction as a second-half substitute in Arsenal’s 3-1 win. The Ukraine international was heavily linked with the Gunners during the January transfer window but signed for the Blues instead. TV cameras showed green lights being flashed in his face on multiple occasions. An Arsenal statement on Wednesday morning read: “An arrest has been made following the use of a laser during last night’s match. “This behaviour is dangerous and totally unacceptable, and we will fully support the police with their enquiries. We will obviously take the strongest possible action.” Meanwhile, Mudryk responded to the incident on Instagram by saying: “It’s OK.” The Gunners made light work of their London rivals at the Emirates to return to the top of the Premier League. The game was over 34 minutes, in truth, with Arsenal scoring three times through Martin Odegaard’s double and Gabriel Jesus’ poacher’s finish. Noni Madueke grabbed one back in the second-half but it was too little too late as Frank Lampard tasted defeat for a sixth time in a row since arriving at Chelsea . Mudryk brought some much-needed pace to Chelsea’s attack and the visitors looked somewhat better after an embarrassing first-half . The winger was also met with chants of ‘you’ve should have signed for Arsenal’ after missing out in January. Mikel Arteta was desperate to sign the 22-year-old earlier in the campaign but Shakhtar demanded a hefty fee. In the end, Chelsea swooped in with a £62million bid, with £26.5m in add-ons, landing the Ukrainian ahead of their London rivals. However, Mudryk has had a tough start to life in England and has registered just two assists in 14 appearances for the Blues. The loss makes it eight in a row in all competitions for Chelsea, and six in a row since Lampard took over.

Lampard’s men take on Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest next in what must be construed as must-win games or risk tumbling further down the table. And with Manchester City, Newcastle and Manchester United left to play, it remains to be seen whether Chelsea will earn another point this season.","pubDate":"2023-05-03 10:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Шахтар - Минай: де дивитися онлайн матч 24 туру УПЛ 03.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/03/928278/shakhtar-mynay-de-dyvytysya-match-upl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 24-го туру УПЛ донецький Шахтар зіграє з Минаєм.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у середу, 3 травня.
