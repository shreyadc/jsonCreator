But as one of the game’s defining head coaches prepares for a fifth final in the club competition that matters most, Manchester City are also looking to become the second English team to complete the treble – after neighbours United in 1999. The stakes could barely be higher against an unfancied Inter Milan. But how will the heavy favourites tag weigh on City and their head coach? Guardiola has long recognised that his time at City will not be defined by domestic success but delivering their first Champions League. “I will be judged, if we don't win it … I will be a failure here. I know that,” he said in 2020. Three seasons on that is a sentiment that feels even stronger. Transfer news LIVE: Ten Hag's Rice alternaive, Maddison price tag discovered, Liverpool latest Inside Champions League final plans for fans as UEFA bids to avoid repeat of Paris horror A narrative of Guardiola’s overthinking and tinkering in key moments has snowballed – he wants it too much – but equally there has been bad luck and the simple reality that his sides have faced an opponent that performed to a higher level. Year-by-year, blow-by-blow, here is a breakdown of where it has gone wrong for the Catalan since that exceptional Barcelona team destroyed Manchester United at Wembley in May 2011. Barcelona 2011-12 – semi-finals Looking to retain the title, it was plain-sailing all the way to the last four. Then Chelsea , under caretaker Roberto di Matteo, dug in deep to win the first leg 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta made it 2-1 to Barca at Camp Nou until Ramires gave Chelsea an away-goal lead by scoring in first-half added time and Fernando Torres forced Gary Neville to make some unusual noises on commentary with his added time breakaway goal. Bayern Munich 2013-14 – semi-finals Refreshed from a year off playing chess with Garry Kasparov in New York, Guardiola won four trophies in his first campaign at Bayern – but the Champions League was not among them. Having coasted through in a group featuring City, the German giants beat Arsenal and Manchester United on the way to the last four. But familiar foes Real Madrid were on supreme form as they won the opening meeting at the Bernabeu 1-0 before crushing Bayern 4-0 in Bavaria. But Guardiola took the blame, having made a late decision to use a 4-2-3-1 instead of a 4-3-3 before at the last minute changing his mind again and using a 4-2-4 that ended up being ripped apart. \"I got it wrong, man,” he said afterwards. “I got it totally wrong. It's a monumental f*** up. A total mess. The biggest f*** up of my life as a coach.” Guardiola reacts during the hammering dished out by Real Madrid in Munich. 2014-15 – semi-finals The pattern continues. After topping a group in which City were second, Bayern scored seven across two legs against Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto to tee up a meeting with Barca. In the first leg at Camp Nou, Bayern were without Robben and Franck Ribery and therefore set out to frustrate and man mark their hosts. “Pep Guardiola’s gone and shocked us all,” Neville said on commentary. Yet they did a half-decent job for 77 minutes before Lionel Messi struck twice in three minutes and Neymar scored a third in added time while the Bavarians were unable to produce a single attempt on target. Humbled but unwilling to accept defeat, Bayern scored three in the second leg only for Neymar to find the net twice more for the eventual champions. 2015-16 – semi-finals A defeat defined by Thomas Muller’s penalty miss. Saul Niguez gave Atletico Madrid a 1-0 lead in the first leg in Spain but Xabi Alonso cancelled that out half an hour into the second with a deflected free kick. Then Muller had a chance to put his team in front from 12 yards, after Javi Martinez was felled, only to be denied by Jan Oblak. Nine minutes into the second half, the sucker punch arrived as Antoine Griezmann put Atletico 2-1 up on aggregate. Robert Lewandowski made it 2-2 but Diego Simeone’s team advanced on away goals. “Titles are just numbers, statistics,” Guardiola said. “I wanted to reach the Champions League final here and I didn’t achieve it but it doesn’t change my opinion about the way I have performed.” City, meanwhile, bowed out in the other semi against Real. Jan Oblak saves a penalty kick from Thomas Muller in 2016. Manchester City 2016-17 - round of 16 Still in the process of implementing his vision, Guardiola led City into the knockout stages despite a 4-0 thrashing away to Barcelona in the group stages. They scored six across two legs in the last 16 tie with Monaco – including five in the first leg at home – only to crash out on away goals to a team featuring Kylian Mbappe, Fabinho and future City players Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva. \"We will improve but this competition is so demanding,\" Guardiola said. \"Sometimes we have to be special and be lucky. We were not.\" 2017-18 - quarter-finals It was progress on a year previous but City were unable to handle an aggressive Liverpool in the first game at Anfield as Jurgen Klopp’s team scored three without reply. The reverse fixture saw City put up a fight as Gabriel Jesus scored but Guardiola ended up being shown a red card for protesting a Leroy Sane goal that was incorrectly ruled out. “He’s a referee who likes to feel different, he’s special,” Guardiola said of Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz afterwards. “When everybody sees things he is going to see the opposite. It’s too much to send off because I didn’t say any wrong word.” Regardless, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino scored to send Liverpool through 5-1 on aggregate. Leroy Sane appeals after his goal was wrongly ruled out for offside. 2018-19 - quarter-finals If Guardiola could blame the officials for halting their fightback against Liverpool, the 2019 defeat to Tottenham was a case of City’s head coach allowing his tinkering to sabotage their chances. While the dramatic second leg, ending in a 4-3 win for City that again saw them bow out on away goals, is what lives long in the memory a feeling remains that the damage was done in north London as Guardiola used Fabian Delph at full back, started Kevin De Bruyne on the bench and used Ilkay Gundogan in a defensive role … and Spurs decisively won 1-0. Raheem Sterling did see an added time goal ruled out in that remarkable second leg, leaving Guardiola to declare: \"It's tough, it's cruel but we have to accept it.” If only the team was set up differently for the opening game. 2019-20 - quarter-finals Things were looking good before the pandemic struck as Real Madrid were overcome in the round of 16 but City, who would finish second in the Premier League to Liverpool, looked dazed in a one-off last-eight tie against Lyon as the French side – relative minnows in a financial sense – found plenty of joy on the counterattack against a back three. David Silva, Bernardo, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez were among the substitutes, leading to Guardiola’s selection being criticised again. \"We tried to cover our weak points in comparison with their strong points,\" he said. \"Except in the first 20 minutes, we struggled to find our spaces to attack them.\" Guardiola walks off with a runners-up medal after the defeat to Chelsea in Porto. 2020-21 - final With the coronavirus keeping the turnstiles closed for almost the entire season, City waltzed into the final and were heavy favourites to beat Chelsea in Porto. But Guardiola decided to play without a defensive midfielder – leaving Rodri and Fernandinho on the bench – as Kai Havertz’s first half goal earned the West London club a second European Cup. City did bemoan the early loss of De Bruyne through a nasty facial injury inflicted by Antonio Rudiger but the Premier League champions did not do enough. 2021-22 - semi-finals Another semi-final, another meeting with Real Madrid and the late collapse to beat all late collapses. The first leg, in Manchester, was a barnstormer that City edged 4-3 and if it was not for the excellence of Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema they would have been out of sight heading to Spain for the second game. Yet City retained a semblance of control at the Bernabeu before Riyad Mahrez looked to have scored the decisive goal. In the 90th minute, City led 5-3 and, again, it would have been more if Jack Grealish had not been twice denied. But Rodrygo scored two in as many minutes, brought the game to extra time and Karim Benzema scored from the penalty spot to complete the turnaround and leave City heartbroken all over again. “Football is unpredictable and you have to accept it,” Guardiola said.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 07:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30175437.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Real-Madrid-v-Manchester-City-Semi-Final-Leg-Two-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"EPL: He’s a good person – Jack Wilshere lauds Arsenal target","link":"https://dailypost.ng/2023/06/09/epl-hes-a-good-person-jack-wilshere-lauds-arsenal-target/","keywords":["Sport","arsenal","EPL","Jack Wilshere"],"creator":["Don Silas"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Arsenal midfielder, Jack Wilshere has heaped praises on the club’s summer target, Declan Rice, for his outstanding performances for both club and country over the past two seasons.

Talking about Rice, Wilshire said (via Football Daily): “People forget how young he is. He’s been sort of carrying that club [West Ham] for the last two seasons. “One best thing about him is that he is such a good person.” Rice made 50 appearances for West Ham during the 2022/23 season, scoring five goals and providing four assists.

Dans un hôtel de l'ouest de Paris, les quelque 200 élus du football français - amateur et professionnel - sont invités à se prononcer sur l'identité du dirigeant amené à terminer le mandat en cours. Après onze années aux commandes de la Fédération sportive la plus puissante de France, Le Graët n'a pu mener celui-ci à son terme, victime d'une accumulation de polémiques et d'accusations qui l'ont poussé vers la sortie, fin février. Le Breton a tout de même été invité à l'AG et il est attendu samedi matin dans le XVIIe arrondissement, même s'il ne sera pas, cette fois, le maître de cérémonie de ces états généraux du football français. Son vice-président Philippe Diallo, devenu numéro 1 par intérim depuis le début de l'année, sollicite la confiance des élus (clubs, ligues locales, districts) pour poursuivre son action jusqu'à l'Assemblée élective de la fin 2024. Homme d'ombre et de dossiers, apprécié pour sa discrétion comme pour son écoute, cet ancien patron du syndicat des clubs professionnels (59 ans) dispose d'une cote élevée pour symboliser l'apaisement souhaité par le milieu après des mois de turbulences. Même si certains opposants ont tenté, au début du printemps, de réunir assez d'élus pour renverser l'actuel comité exécutif de la « 3F », la confirmation de Diallo samedi semble acquise aux yeux de tous les acteurs du football interrogés ces dernières semaines. « Après quelques mois d'exercice, je pense qu'on peut dire que la Fédération fonctionne. On est même en train de commencer sa transformation. Il y a besoin de retrouver de l'apaisement et j'espère avoir déjà contribué à cela », assurait le dirigeant début avril dans un entretien à l'AFP. Le football professionnel, qui remet ses droits TV sur le marché à la rentrée, compte notamment sur ce profil pour assurer une transition fluide et stable, loin du tumulte de l'automne et de l'hiver. Les accusations de harcèlement moral et sexuel visant Le Graët , les polémiques et autres dérapages ont en effet accompagné le début de saison du football français, épinglé en février par un audit de l'Inspection générale de l'éducation, du sport et de la recherche (IGESR), accablant pour la « Fédé » comme pour ses dirigeants. Même si le calme est progressivement revenu, les secousses ne sont jamais loin, à l'image de la fronde historique des joueuses de l'équipe de France ayant abouti au remplacement de la sélectionneuse Corinne Diacre par Hervé Renard. Jeudi, d'autres accusations de « harcèlement moral et sexuel » émises dans le magazine So Foot par un ex-arbitre actuellement coordinateur fédéral de l'arbitrage amateur, Nicolas Pottier, ont à nouveau assombri l'horizon. La FFF a immédiatement diligenté une enquête interne sur la gestion fédérale de l'arbitrage. Dans ce contexte incertain, l'Assemblée fédérale doit aussi voter la nomination de deux futurs membres du comité exécutif de la FFF, les présidents de district Claude Delforge et Alexandre Gougnard. Avec la démission de Le Graët et celle de Jamel Sandjak, président de la Ligue de Paris-Île de France en désaccord avec la direction prise par le « Comex », deux places s'étaient en effet libérées dans ce « gouvernement » du foot français. La Fédération présentera également son budget prévisionnel pour la saison 2023-24 et celui-ci sera déficitaire, une rareté. La baisse des droits audiovisuels de la Coupe de France, le limogeage de Corinne Diacre, l'effort de 4 à 5 millions d'euros supplémentaires consentis en faveur du football féminin et d'une future Ligue féminine professionnelle expliquent ainsi en partie le déficit prévisionnel estimé à 4,7 millions d'euros. Mais celui-ci pourrait être comblé, notamment si l'équipe de France féminine brille au Mondial cet été en Australie. La FFF table en effet sur un quart de finale dans ses prévisions financières. Un meilleur parcours des Bleues serait un bonus bienvenu pour les caisses fédérales.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:41:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"lefigaro","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Arsenal transfer news LIVE: Caicedo bid, Rice decision, Cancelo talks opened, Lazio eye Jorginho","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-live-caicedo-30100616","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Nathan Ridley"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mikel Arteta wants to refresh Arsenal's midfield during the summer transfer window and is centring his plans around Declan Rice, who's confirmed to be leaving West Ham over the coming weeks","content":"Arsenal are going on the offensive with the summer transfer window set to open in less than a week's time.

The England international, 24, has been tipped to leave the London Stadium at the end of the season and has emerged as Mikel Arteta's top summer transfer target in recent weeks. Recent reports have claimed that Arsenal planned to approach West Ham over a blockbuster deal for their talisman once they had played in the Europa Conference League final, which they won on Wednesday night . Even though the Gunners are now poised to firm up their interest, Rice was reluctant to entertain the idea of moving on in the aftermath of West Ham's big win - although he refused to rule out a move completely. Click here to read the full story. 13:20 Jacob Leeks Rice warned off Arsenal move Premier League icon David James has warned Declan Rice off making a move to Arsenal this summer. \"I think he is in a similar situation as Harry Kane, whereby West Ham fans would not begrudge him a move. Personally, I would love to see him play abroad for two reasons,\" he told King Casino Bonus . “The first, from a selfish point of view, is that I wouldn’t have to see him playing against West Ham! He’d undoubtedly cause them all sorts of problems as well, because he is such a solid professional and would take the emotion out of it. \"But secondly, for him personally, he would gain so much experience from playing abroad. You look at the success of Jude Bellingham at Borussia Dortmund, there is no reason why Rice couldn’t follow suit and go and become a legend with a foreign club, before returning to the UK as a much more developed player. “He could experience football in the same way I did when I was very late in my career; experiencing a new culture, becoming a more rounded player. I think we would all be able to enjoy Declan Rice on another level.” 11:25 Jacob Leeks Lazio eye Jorginho move Lazio are lining up a move for Jorginho, with Maurizio Sarri keen to reunite with the midfielder. The Italian still has a year remaining on his contract at Arsenal. But Sarri is hopeful he can convince him to return to Serie A. According to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Sarri has held talks with club president Claudio Lotito, with Jorginho one of the names mentioned. 10:39 KEY EVENT Rice exit confirmed by West Ham owner West Ham owner David Sullivan has confirmed that Declan Rice has played his last game for the club after winning the Europa Conference League. \"I think it has to be [his last game]. We promised him he could go. He set his heart on going. You can't ask for a man who has committed more to us this season. In due course, he has to get on and we have to get a replacement - or several replacements,\" Sullivan told talkSPORT. \"It's not something we want to happen. We offered him £200,000-a-week 18 months ago. He turned it down. It's cost him £10million to stay at West Ham in that time (in lost wages). And he wants to go. You can't keep a player who doesn't want to be there.\" Click here to read the full story. 09:41 Jacob Leeks Arsenal miss out on Guerreiro Arsenal are set to miss out on Raphael Guerreiro, with the Portugal international heading to Bayern Munich. The Gunners had been eyeing Guerreiro as a potential target, but reports now suggest that he has instead reached an agreement with Bayern. Terms have been agreed for a three-year contract, with his arrival at the Allianz expected next week. 09:04 Jacob Leeks Rice's transfer admission throws curveball to Gunners Declan Rice has thrown a curveball at Manchester United and Arsenal by admitting he may yet stay at West Ham beyond this summer. Rice captained the Hammers to winning the Europa Conference League on Wednesday night. Jarrod Bowen scored a last-minute winner to beat Fiorentina in the final of the competition in Prague, with Rice having been at his imperious best. The 2-1 victory means that the England international became the first West Ham player since Bobby Moore in 1965 to lift a European trophy. But there has been intense speculation about his future , with a belief that he will depart the London Stadium this summer.

The club are prepared planning to terminate his contract if he can't be sold this summer, according to a report from Football London . He spent this past season on loan with Nice, scoring eight goals in all competitions, including six in Ligue 1. 16:33 Fraser Watson Arsenal boosted by Bellingham move Arsenal were never in the race to sign Jude Bellingham this summer, but they'll be relieved the teenage star isn't heading to a Premier League rival either. Liverpool had long pursued the English international, whilst Man United's interest had long cooled. But Borussia Dortmund have agreed a deal with Real Madrid for around £108 million. Of course, the Gunners could still face him in the Champions League.... 16:01 Fraser Watson United eye up another option as Arsenal lead race for Rice Manchester United's interest in Declan Rice could now cool after another of their midfield targets expressed his desire to head to England. A player who Rice will line-up against in the Europa Conference final in Budapest, Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, is being tracked by the Red Devils and has admitted: \"Of course, the Premier League is a fantastic league, one of the strongest in the world. It would be nice to play there one day,\" he said. \"Football has changed a lot, it's more physical, you have more to be an athlete, the tempo and intensity is higher. Of course, in England the intensity is very high, so I think it could suit me.\" Read the full story here . 15:22 Fraser Watson Player of the Season: Martinelli finishes third The official Arsenal wesbite has allowed vans to vote for the club's player of the season, and have just announced the third placed finisher. Brazilian attacker Gabriel Martinelli polled plenty of votes after finishing joint-top goalscorer with 15 Premier League strikes. The 21-year-old also received a call-up to the Brazil squad for the 2022 World Cup, and was nominated for the Premier League’s Young Player of the Season. 15:02 Daniel Orme Arsenal and Spurs go head-to-head Arsenal and Spurs are facing off for the signing of Fenerbahce defender Victor Nelsson. According to Fanatik , the two Noth London rivals are interested in the Dane, as well as Spanish side Sevilla. He has a release clause worth €25 million (£21.4 million) written into his contract. Spurs have reportedly agreed to match that fee as they attempt to sign him. 14:27 Daniel Orme Pepe set for Arsenal return Arsenal's record signing Nicolas Pepe is set to return to the Emirates Stadium this summer with Nice not expected to pursue a permanent deal. The Ivorian joined the Ligue 1 side on a season-long loan deal at the start of the campaign and scored eight goals in 28 appearances in all competitions. However, according to Nice-Matin , the club are not going to pursue a permanent move. That once again sees Pepe's future go up in the air. 13:31 KEY EVENT Arsenal handed double Saudi blow Mikel Arteta's transfer plans have suffered a dent as Arsenal look set to miss out on two targets who are the subject of interest from multiple clubs in Saudi Arabia. Both Ilkay Gundogan and N'Golo Kante were players the Gunners boss was rumoured to be keen on bringing to the Emirates. Arteta has already proven he is a big fan of signing players who already boast Premier League experience and his sights were set on the Manchester City star, while Chelsea star Kante was also linked. Find out the full details here 13:00 Daniel Orme Balogun backed for big Arsenal impact Folarin Balogun has the talent to 'elevate\" the entire Arsenal squad according to Gunners team-mate and fellow countryman Matt Turner. Balogun has been on the books at Arsenal since he was just seven years old but has long been tipped for stardom. The 21-year-old enjoyed a sensational season last term while on loan at French outfit Reims, where he netted 21 goals in 39 appearances for the Ligue 1 side. Read what Turner had to say here 12:31 Daniel Orme Trusty set to leave Arsenal Arsenal defender Auston Trusty is set to leave Arsenal on a permanent basis this summer. The American has never played for the Gunners on a senior basis and spent last season on-loan woth Championship side Birmingham City. He was named as the Blues' player of the year and according to football.london , Arsenal will now cash-in on the centre-back. 11:59 KEY EVENT Arsenal to kick-off Rice negotiations Arsenal could kick-off their talks with West Ham regarding the signing of Declan Rice within hours. Previous reports were suggesting that the Gunners were willing to wait until after West Ham's Europa League final showdown with Fiorentina to open discussions. That game takes place this evening and regardless of the result, Arsenal will be keen to get moving on a deal. It is said that Arsenal value the England midfielder at £90m. 11:28 James Nursey Villa want answer from Arsenal target Aston Villa have told former Arsenal target Youri Tielemans they want a quick answer after making a move for the free agent. Villa boss Unai Emery hopes the lure of European football can tempt the Belgian international ,26, after they finished seventh. Tielemans’ representatives have been approached with Emery keen to push ahead with strengthening his squad in central midfield. Emery also wants a new winger with targets including Leicester’s Harvey Barnes and Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams. 10:59 Daniel Orme Nelson claim resurfaces Reiss Nelson is thought to be on the verge of signing a new contract at Arsenal despite at one point seeming destined for the Emirates exit. Late last year, Nelson spoke exclusively to Mirror Football and waxed lyrical over the impact Arteta has had on the Gunners and certainly didn't speak like a man who had any interest in ending his Arsenal stay. See what he had to say here 10:29 KEY EVENT Arsenal 'open' Cancelo talks Arsenal will face competition in their bid to sign Manchester City's Joao Cancelo this summer, with both Real Madrid and Barcelona in the running to sign the full-back. According to Sky Sports , Arsenal have engaged in ‘early verbal talks’ to sign the Portuguese full-back, with his Man City future uncertain in the wake of a training ground bust-up with Pep Guardiola following the World Cup . However, Cancelo's own preference has been revealed to be a move to a La Liga club, with Real Madrid and Barcelona the leading candidates. German outlet Kicker (via Besoccer ) report Cancelo's plans, with a wish to join either of the Spanish giants in a deal which could amount to €50 million (£43m). City are reportedly reluctant to allow another loan deal, with the player's contract expiring in four years' time having agreed a two-year extension on his original six-year deal just last summer.

The Frenchman sees his current contract expire next summer and it was reported that PSG were interested in a deal. According to football.london , discussions between Saliba's representatives and the club are 'progressing well'. In the meantime, it is also reported that the Gunners are keen to commit captain Martin Odegaard to a fresh deal. 09:02 KEY EVENT Arsenal set to seal Boey signing Arsenal are closing in on a deal for Galatasaray star Sacha Boey, who will become the Gunners' first signing of the summer transfer window. That is according to Turkish outlet Takvim , who state that the defender will complete a move to the Emirates Stadium soon. It is claimed that Arsenal had a £15.5 million rejected but a meeting will be held between the two clubs where a £17.2 million deal is expected to be pushed through.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:12:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30191325.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_MAIN-CUE-upload-Arsenal-transfer-news-LIVE-Fresh-Caicedo-bid-Rice-decision-Lazio-eye-Jorginho-Cance.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Affaire Kenzo : «la vérité des (faits) a été très nettement exagérée», martèle le président d'Ajaccio","link":"https://www.lefigaro.fr/sports/football/ligue-1/affaire-kenzo-la-verite-des-faits-a-ete-tres-nettement-exageree-martele-le-president-d-ajaccio-20230608","keywords":["Ligue 1"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Interrogé par Le Parisien, Alain Orsoni estime avoir été «berné et manipulé».

Apparemment, pas exactement ce qui a été rapporté, si on parle de l'agression du petit Kenzo… Rappel des faits : âgé de huit ans et atteint d'un cancer au cerveau, ce garçonnet de 8 ans était présent pour cette rencontre de la 38e journée de Ligue 1 . Un « rêve » qui s'est transformé en cauchemar quand il a été pris pour cible, avec ses parents, par plusieurs supporters du club corse. Une enquête avait été ouverte pour « violences en réunion », la LFP a déposé plainte et cette affaire a suscité des réactions jusqu'au sommet de l'Etat, le président Macron ayant réclamé des sanctions « claires et fortes » . Mais les sanctions ne seront peut-être pas celles qu'on attendait… Président de l'AC Ajaccio, Alain Orsoni signe jeudi un communiqué . « Il semblerait hélas, que les informations communiquées immédiatement après les faits, ne soient que très partiellement conformes à la réalité. Au début, je n'avais aucune raison de douter de la véracité des déclarations des parents du petit Kenzo, car il m'apparaissait impossible qu'ils aient pu vouloir instrumentaliser leur petit garçon malade à des fins de Bad Buzz. C'est pourquoi, soucieux de préserver les intérêts de mon club et sincèrement révolté, je me suis associé aux manifestations de soutien vis-à-vis de cette famille et condamné avec fermeté les faits tels qu'on les avait exposés », rappelle-t-il. Et de poursuivre : « Désormais, les éléments objectifs de l'enquête, et notamment le contenu de l'enregistrement de la vidéo-surveillance, révèlent que la vérité est toute autre et que la gravité des agissements de certains supporters ajacciens, au demeurant répréhensibles, ait été très nettement exagérée. » Ça fait pschitt ? Du coup, le club corse « se réserve la possibilité de faire valoir ses droits contre toutes personnes susceptibles d'avoir été à l'origine de ces informations erronées et ceux qui complaisamment, les ont relayées ». Renversement de situation total, avec donc les parents du petit Kenzo qui pourraient finalement être dans l'œil du cyclone ? Interrogé par Le Parisien , M. Orsoni s'exprime de manière beaucoup plus claire. « Forcément, quand j'ai appris ce qui s'était passé, j'étais dans l'émotion car l'acte tel qu'il a été présenté était ignoble. Mais j'ai été berné et manipulé. Attention, je n'excuse pas les trois jeunes qui sont entrés en loges pour voler un maillot. On peut juste condamner cette grosse bêtise », indique-t-il dans un premier temps. Avant de poursuivre : « Depuis dimanche, j'ai récolté des éléments précis que je tiens de la police. L'intrusion dans la loge n'a duré que 12 secondes. La maman, qui s'est répandue partout, n'était même pas présente. Elle peut donc raconter quoi ? Déjà, le gosse n'a pas été frappé. Toute la presse nationale a parlé de cette affaire et même le président de la République… Je me dois de défendre mon club. J'ai l'expérience du traitement que nous réservent de nombreux médias, donc je me dois de réagir. » Last but nos least, Alain Orsoni déclare qu'il se « réserve le droit de porter plainte » contre les parents du petit Kenzo.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:01:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"lefigaro","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Former Southampton star details journey from Man Utd transfer links to SEVENTH tier","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/southampton-jake-hesketh-man-utd-30166691","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Kieran King"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh has opened up on his career from the Premier League, into League One and now the seventh-tier of English football at 27","content":"In December 2014, Jake Hesketh fulfilled his lifelong dream when he came on for his Premier League debut in Southampton's game against Manchester United . Hesketh, 27, who is a boyhood United fan, came on for the final 20 minutes as Saints were beaten 2-1 by Louis van Gaal's side at St Mary's Stadium, with Robin van Persie scoring a brace for the Red Devils. Five days later, Hesketh made his first top-flight start in a 1-0 defeat at Burnley . Playing in the Premier League was what Hesketh wanted to achieve since he was a child. Speaking to Mirror Football on that experience, he recalled: \"It was my first time on the bench, I was never expecting to come on and it happened so quickly. Ex-Newcastle star recalls giving up ambulance driver job to become Premier League hero World's top 10 most valuable football club 'brands' as Man Utd climb and Liverpool drop \"You don’t have any time to process it, but I have looked back and realised that I’ve just played against some of the best players in the world. It’s obviously what you spent your life dreaming of really. It couldn’t really get any better at that point. I think playing in the Premier League was my dream.\" However, the midfielder had to wait almost another two years before making his next senior appearance. Hesketh scored his first and only Southampton goal in a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in September 2016, before playing in the Europa League against Hapoel Be'er Sheva. He added: \"Playing in Europe was mental, it was an atmosphere that you would have thought you would play in ever again. It was hostile and to just play in that kind of competition was really surreal. Jake Hesketh celebrates scoring his first Southampton goal ( Image: Getty Images) \"There is nothing like that kind of atmosphere, it happens a lot around Europe but as soon as you go to warm up there’s boos and whistles. Everything and it was the most hostile thing I have ever played in and in comparison to England, you won’t come across anything like how they do it over there.\" During that time, Hesketh was being linked with a shock transfer to Man Utd. The Daily Mail reported in 2016 that the Red Devils were considering a move for then 19-year-old Hesketh as they tried to compete with Manchester City ’s academy recruitment policy. \"It was a bit weird but as far as I know there was nothing to it,\" Hesketh claimed on the transfer interest. \"My family is from Manchester, that’s where I was born and I am a United fan so that made it a little bit weirder.\" Jake Hesketh enjoyed a loan spell at Burton ( Image: Getty Images) After another season in the Southampton academy, Hesketh decided to go out on loan for the first time in his career when he signed for Burton in 2018. The Brewers had just been relegated to League One and wanted to add quality to their squad. It is safe to say that the midfielder impressed during his time at the Pirelli Stadium. He played a key role in Burton’s run to the semi-final of the Carabao Cup against Man City and scored the winner in the quarter-final win at Middlesbrough. Hesketh scored a further two goals in a highly successful loan spell at the Brewers. \"I went to Burton until January, and then to MK Dons until the end of the season and got promoted,\" Hesketh added. \"At Burton, we got to the semi-final of the League Cup, which for a League One club, doesn’t happen very often. \"To score the winning goal in the quarter-finals was one of the highlights of my career. I was playing the best football of my career at that point, those two clubs that season, I was enjoying my football so much.\" Jake Hesketh's time at Burton was memorable ( Image: Getty Images) Hesketh's loan spell at Burton was cut-short in January 2019 and he immediately made the switch to promotion-chasing League Two outfit MK Dons for the remainder of the season. That was another move that paid off as The Dons snuck into the top-three on the final day. Hesketh continued: \"It was a great feeling because they had only just come down, and they were expecting to come back up. When I got there in January, they were eighth, a little bit off it, but we had a really good run, got ourselves into a good position. It came down to the last game of the season but the feeling after that game and the weekend was unbelievable.\" Unfortunately for Hesketh, his career trajectory has plummeted downhill ever since that summer. He spent time out on loan at Lincoln and Crawley but never really found a home before he was released by Southampton at the end of his contract in 2021. Although it was disappointing to leave Saints, Hesketh didn't have any regrets about his time at the club. \"I knew it was coming as I was 24, on loan at Crawley that year in League Two and I was realistic,\" he said. Jake Hesketh during his loan spell at Lincoln ( Image: Getty Images) \"I knew I wasn’t going to get another contract at a club that is playing in the Premier League. So, in that sense, it was fine because it didn’t come as a shock. Obviously it was disappointing and weird to move away from what you have known your whole life. I think having them loan spells, you get used to spending time away from the club, and where I was in my life, it was fine.\" Hesketh immediately found a new club following his departure and joined National League side Eastleigh. He made 60 appearances for the Spitfires, scoring six goals in a two-year spell before leaving at the end of this season. Once again, it didn’t take Hesketh long to find an employer. He made the two-tier drop to sign for Southern League Premier Division side Sholing on May 31. The news came as a huge shock to many fans on social media after what Hesketh achieved at Burton and MK Dons only a matter of years ago. Jake Hesketh was most recently at Eastleigh ( Image: Getty Images) But Hesketh has explained the decision. He said: \"I am really pleased to get the deal over the line. I first spoke to them around three to four weeks ago maybe. I went to a few of their games last year at the back end of last season and it all came together at the last minute. I am happy to get it sorted.\" \"It is definitely a club with ambition and the people in there want to do well,\" he added. \"I mean it’s tough to go for back-to-back promotions, but over the next couple of years it’s a club that will definitely be pushing to get into the National League South.\" The ex-Southampton star turned 27 in March and is arguably in the prime age of his career. Despite finding himself all the way down in the seventh-tier of English football, he wants to re-find his feet and enjoy his football again - something he hasn’t done in a number of years. Hesketh finished: \"I want to go and enjoy myself to be honest. When I was younger I absolutely loved playing football, but for the last few years, I would say not so much. I want to play with a smile on my face and play at a club that has that kind of feel, a tight knit group. \"I wouldn’t say there’s any unrealistic ambitions to go and do anything, but I want to enjoy myself. There will be a load of reasons for it, it’s a shame for me because it’s all what I’ve wanted to do growing up. \"To not like football anymore is a shame, but I hope I get that back at Sholing. If that can come hand-in-hand it would be perfect. I want to find a home and play football, hopefully at Sholing it will last longer than this season. I hope the relationship keeps growing.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30166903.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Jake-Hesketh-exclusive.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pep Guardiola's Champions League failures - from \"biggest f*** up\" to De Bruyne mistake","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiolas-champions-league-failures-30171817","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Alan Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester City are huge favourites to win their first Champions League against Inter Milan tomorrow as their head coach looks to correct more than a decade of bad luck, poor decisions and bizarre tinkering","content":"Twelve painful years have passed since Pep Guardiola last won the Champions League . But as one of the game’s defining head coaches prepares for a fifth final in the club competition that matters most, Manchester City are also looking to become the second English team to complete the treble – after neighbours United in 1999. The stakes could barely be higher against an unfancied Inter Milan. But how will the heavy favourites tag weigh on City and their head coach? Guardiola has long recognised that his time at City will not be defined by domestic success but delivering their first Champions League. “I will be judged, if we don't win it … I will be a failure here. I know that,” he said in 2020. Three seasons on that is a sentiment that feels even stronger. Transfer news LIVE: Ten Hag's Rice alternaive, Maddison price tag discovered, Liverpool latest Inside Champions League final plans for fans as UEFA bids to avoid repeat of Paris horror A narrative of Guardiola’s overthinking and tinkering in key moments has snowballed – he wants it too much – but equally there has been bad luck and the simple reality that his sides have faced an opponent that performed to a higher level. Year-by-year, blow-by-blow, here is a breakdown of where it has gone wrong for the Catalan since that exceptional Barcelona team destroyed Manchester United at Wembley in May 2011. Barcelona 2011-12 – semi-finals Looking to retain the title, it was plain-sailing all the way to the last four. Then Chelsea , under caretaker Roberto di Matteo, dug in deep to win the first leg 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta made it 2-1 to Barca at Camp Nou until Ramires gave Chelsea an away-goal lead by scoring in first-half added time and Fernando Torres forced Gary Neville to make some unusual noises on commentary with his added time breakaway goal. Bayern Munich 2013-14 – semi-finals Refreshed from a year off playing chess with Garry Kasparov in New York, Guardiola won four trophies in his first campaign at Bayern – but the Champions League was not among them. Having coasted through in a group featuring City, the German giants beat Arsenal and Manchester United on the way to the last four. But familiar foes Real Madrid were on supreme form as they won the opening meeting at the Bernabeu 1-0 before crushing Bayern 4-0 in Bavaria. But Guardiola took the blame, having made a late decision to use a 4-2-3-1 instead of a 4-3-3 before at the last minute changing his mind again and using a 4-2-4 that ended up being ripped apart. \"I got it wrong, man,” he said afterwards. “I got it totally wrong. It's a monumental f*** up. A total mess. The biggest f*** up of my life as a coach.” Guardiola reacts during the hammering dished out by Real Madrid in Munich. 2014-15 – semi-finals The pattern continues. After topping a group in which City were second, Bayern scored seven across two legs against Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto to tee up a meeting with Barca. In the first leg at Camp Nou, Bayern were without Robben and Franck Ribery and therefore set out to frustrate and man mark their hosts. “Pep Guardiola’s gone and shocked us all,” Neville said on commentary. Yet they did a half-decent job for 77 minutes before Lionel Messi struck twice in three minutes and Neymar scored a third in added time while the Bavarians were unable to produce a single attempt on target. Humbled but unwilling to accept defeat, Bayern scored three in the second leg only for Neymar to find the net twice more for the eventual champions. 2015-16 – semi-finals A defeat defined by Thomas Muller’s penalty miss. Saul Niguez gave Atletico Madrid a 1-0 lead in the first leg in Spain but Xabi Alonso cancelled that out half an hour into the second with a deflected free kick. Then Muller had a chance to put his team in front from 12 yards, after Javi Martinez was felled, only to be denied by Jan Oblak. Nine minutes into the second half, the sucker punch arrived as Antoine Griezmann put Atletico 2-1 up on aggregate. Robert Lewandowski made it 2-2 but Diego Simeone’s team advanced on away goals. “Titles are just numbers, statistics,” Guardiola said. “I wanted to reach the Champions League final here and I didn’t achieve it but it doesn’t change my opinion about the way I have performed.” City, meanwhile, bowed out in the other semi against Real. Jan Oblak saves a penalty kick from Thomas Muller in 2016. Manchester City 2016-17 - round of 16 Still in the process of implementing his vision, Guardiola led City into the knockout stages despite a 4-0 thrashing away to Barcelona in the group stages. They scored six across two legs in the last 16 tie with Monaco – including five in the first leg at home – only to crash out on away goals to a team featuring Kylian Mbappe, Fabinho and future City players Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva. \"We will improve but this competition is so demanding,\" Guardiola said. \"Sometimes we have to be special and be lucky. We were not.\" 2017-18 - quarter-finals It was progress on a year previous but City were unable to handle an aggressive Liverpool in the first game at Anfield as Jurgen Klopp’s team scored three without reply. The reverse fixture saw City put up a fight as Gabriel Jesus scored but Guardiola ended up being shown a red card for protesting a Leroy Sane goal that was incorrectly ruled out. “He’s a referee who likes to feel different, he’s special,” Guardiola said of Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz afterwards. “When everybody sees things he is going to see the opposite. It’s too much to send off because I didn’t say any wrong word.” Regardless, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino scored to send Liverpool through 5-1 on aggregate. Leroy Sane appeals after his goal was wrongly ruled out for offside. 2018-19 - quarter-finals If Guardiola could blame the officials for halting their fightback against Liverpool, the 2019 defeat to Tottenham was a case of City’s head coach allowing his tinkering to sabotage their chances. While the dramatic second leg, ending in a 4-3 win for City that again saw them bow out on away goals, is what lives long in the memory a feeling remains that the damage was done in north London as Guardiola used Fabian Delph at full back, started Kevin De Bruyne on the bench and used Ilkay Gundogan in a defensive role … and Spurs decisively won 1-0. Raheem Sterling did see an added time goal ruled out in that remarkable second leg, leaving Guardiola to declare: \"It's tough, it's cruel but we have to accept it.” If only the team was set up differently for the opening game. 2019-20 - quarter-finals Things were looking good before the pandemic struck as Real Madrid were overcome in the round of 16 but City, who would finish second in the Premier League to Liverpool, looked dazed in a one-off last-eight tie against Lyon as the French side – relative minnows in a financial sense – found plenty of joy on the counterattack against a back three. David Silva, Bernardo, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez were among the substitutes, leading to Guardiola’s selection being criticised again. \"We tried to cover our weak points in comparison with their strong points,\" he said. \"Except in the first 20 minutes, we struggled to find our spaces to attack them.\" Guardiola walks off with a runners-up medal after the defeat to Chelsea in Porto. 2020-21 - final With the coronavirus keeping the turnstiles closed for almost the entire season, City waltzed into the final and were heavy favourites to beat Chelsea in Porto. But Guardiola decided to play without a defensive midfielder – leaving Rodri and Fernandinho on the bench – as Kai Havertz’s first half goal earned the West London club a second European Cup. City did bemoan the early loss of De Bruyne through a nasty facial injury inflicted by Antonio Rudiger but the Premier League champions did not do enough. 2021-22 - semi-finals Another semi-final, another meeting with Real Madrid and the late collapse to beat all late collapses. The first leg, in Manchester, was a barnstormer that City edged 4-3 and if it was not for the excellence of Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema they would have been out of sight heading to Spain for the second game. Yet City retained a semblance of control at the Bernabeu before Riyad Mahrez looked to have scored the decisive goal. In the 90th minute, City led 5-3 and, again, it would have been more if Jack Grealish had not been twice denied.

Rice is expected to leave West Ham United this summer, and the England international has been linked with a move to Arsenal, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Liverpool. Talking about Rice, Wilshire said (via Football Daily): “People forget how young he is. He’s been sort of carrying that club [West Ham] for the last two seasons. “One best thing about him is that he is such a good person.” Rice made 50 appearances for West Ham during the 2022/23 season, scoring five goals and providing four assists.

Dans un hôtel de l'ouest de Paris, les quelque 200 élus du football français - amateur et professionnel - sont invités à se prononcer sur l'identité du dirigeant amené à terminer le mandat en cours. Après onze années aux commandes de la Fédération sportive la plus puissante de France, Le Graët n'a pu mener celui-ci à son terme, victime d'une accumulation de polémiques et d'accusations qui l'ont poussé vers la sortie, fin février. Le Breton a tout de même été invité à l'AG et il est attendu samedi matin dans le XVIIe arrondissement, même s'il ne sera pas, cette fois, le maître de cérémonie de ces états généraux du football français. Son vice-président Philippe Diallo, devenu numéro 1 par intérim depuis le début de l'année, sollicite la confiance des élus (clubs, ligues locales, districts) pour poursuivre son action jusqu'à l'Assemblée élective de la fin 2024. Homme d'ombre et de dossiers, apprécié pour sa discrétion comme pour son écoute, cet ancien patron du syndicat des clubs professionnels (59 ans) dispose d'une cote élevée pour symboliser l'apaisement souhaité par le milieu après des mois de turbulences. Même si certains opposants ont tenté, au début du printemps, de réunir assez d'élus pour renverser l'actuel comité exécutif de la « 3F », la confirmation de Diallo samedi semble acquise aux yeux de tous les acteurs du football interrogés ces dernières semaines. « Après quelques mois d'exercice, je pense qu'on peut dire que la Fédération fonctionne. On est même en train de commencer sa transformation. Il y a besoin de retrouver de l'apaisement et j'espère avoir déjà contribué à cela », assurait le dirigeant début avril dans un entretien à l'AFP. Le football professionnel, qui remet ses droits TV sur le marché à la rentrée, compte notamment sur ce profil pour assurer une transition fluide et stable, loin du tumulte de l'automne et de l'hiver. Les accusations de harcèlement moral et sexuel visant Le Graët , les polémiques et autres dérapages ont en effet accompagné le début de saison du football français, épinglé en février par un audit de l'Inspection générale de l'éducation, du sport et de la recherche (IGESR), accablant pour la « Fédé » comme pour ses dirigeants. Même si le calme est progressivement revenu, les secousses ne sont jamais loin, à l'image de la fronde historique des joueuses de l'équipe de France ayant abouti au remplacement de la sélectionneuse Corinne Diacre par Hervé Renard. Jeudi, d'autres accusations de « harcèlement moral et sexuel » émises dans le magazine So Foot par un ex-arbitre actuellement coordinateur fédéral de l'arbitrage amateur, Nicolas Pottier, ont à nouveau assombri l'horizon. La FFF a immédiatement diligenté une enquête interne sur la gestion fédérale de l'arbitrage. Dans ce contexte incertain, l'Assemblée fédérale doit aussi voter la nomination de deux futurs membres du comité exécutif de la FFF, les présidents de district Claude Delforge et Alexandre Gougnard. Avec la démission de Le Graët et celle de Jamel Sandjak, président de la Ligue de Paris-Île de France en désaccord avec la direction prise par le « Comex », deux places s'étaient en effet libérées dans ce « gouvernement » du foot français. La Fédération présentera également son budget prévisionnel pour la saison 2023-24 et celui-ci sera déficitaire, une rareté. La baisse des droits audiovisuels de la Coupe de France, le limogeage de Corinne Diacre, l'effort de 4 à 5 millions d'euros supplémentaires consentis en faveur du football féminin et d'une future Ligue féminine professionnelle expliquent ainsi en partie le déficit prévisionnel estimé à 4,7 millions d'euros. Mais celui-ci pourrait être comblé, notamment si l'équipe de France féminine brille au Mondial cet été en Australie. La FFF table en effet sur un quart de finale dans ses prévisions financières. Un meilleur parcours des Bleues serait un bonus bienvenu pour les caisses fédérales.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:41:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"lefigaro","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Arsenal transfer news LIVE: Caicedo bid, Rice decision, Cancelo talks opened, Lazio eye Jorginho","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-live-caicedo-30100616","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Nathan Ridley"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mikel Arteta wants to refresh Arsenal's midfield during the summer transfer window and is centring his plans around Declan Rice, who's confirmed to be leaving West Ham over the coming weeks","content":"Arsenal are going on the offensive with the summer transfer window set to open in less than a week's time.

Meanwhile, Manchester City star Ilkay Gundogan is high on Arteta's shopping list, as is Brighton's Moises Caicedo. City want to give Gundogan - soon to be a free agent - a new contract, while Caicedo is another player who'll be sold if the price is right.

The England international, 24, has been tipped to leave the London Stadium at the end of the season and has emerged as Mikel Arteta's top summer transfer target in recent weeks. Recent reports have claimed that Arsenal planned to approach West Ham over a blockbuster deal for their talisman once they had played in the Europa Conference League final, which they won on Wednesday night . Even though the Gunners are now poised to firm up their interest, Rice was reluctant to entertain the idea of moving on in the aftermath of West Ham's big win - although he refused to rule out a move completely. Click here to read the full story. 13:20 Jacob Leeks Rice warned off Arsenal move Premier League icon David James has warned Declan Rice off making a move to Arsenal this summer. \"I think he is in a similar situation as Harry Kane, whereby West Ham fans would not begrudge him a move. Personally, I would love to see him play abroad for two reasons,\" he told King Casino Bonus . “The first, from a selfish point of view, is that I wouldn’t have to see him playing against West Ham! He’d undoubtedly cause them all sorts of problems as well, because he is such a solid professional and would take the emotion out of it. \"But secondly, for him personally, he would gain so much experience from playing abroad. You look at the success of Jude Bellingham at Borussia Dortmund, there is no reason why Rice couldn’t follow suit and go and become a legend with a foreign club, before returning to the UK as a much more developed player. “He could experience football in the same way I did when I was very late in my career; experiencing a new culture, becoming a more rounded player. I think we would all be able to enjoy Declan Rice on another level.” 11:25 Jacob Leeks Lazio eye Jorginho move Lazio are lining up a move for Jorginho, with Maurizio Sarri keen to reunite with the midfielder.

In due course, he has to get on and we have to get a replacement - or several replacements,\" Sullivan told talkSPORT. \"It's not something we want to happen. We offered him £200,000-a-week 18 months ago. He turned it down. It's cost him £10million to stay at West Ham in that time (in lost wages). And he wants to go. You can't keep a player who doesn't want to be there.\" Click here to read the full story. 09:41 Jacob Leeks Arsenal miss out on Guerreiro Arsenal are set to miss out on Raphael Guerreiro, with the Portugal international heading to Bayern Munich. The Gunners had been eyeing Guerreiro as a potential target, but reports now suggest that he has instead reached an agreement with Bayern. Terms have been agreed for a three-year contract, with his arrival at the Allianz expected next week. 09:04 Jacob Leeks Rice's transfer admission throws curveball to Gunners Declan Rice has thrown a curveball at Manchester United and Arsenal by admitting he may yet stay at West Ham beyond this summer. Rice captained the Hammers to winning the Europa Conference League on Wednesday night. Jarrod Bowen scored a last-minute winner to beat Fiorentina in the final of the competition in Prague, with Rice having been at his imperious best. The 2-1 victory means that the England international became the first West Ham player since Bobby Moore in 1965 to lift a European trophy.

Liverpool had long pursued the English international, whilst Man United's interest had long cooled. But Borussia Dortmund have agreed a deal with Real Madrid for around £108 million. Of course, the Gunners could still face him in the Champions League.... 16:01 Fraser Watson United eye up another option as Arsenal lead race for Rice Manchester United's interest in Declan Rice could now cool after another of their midfield targets expressed his desire to head to England. A player who Rice will line-up against in the Europa Conference final in Budapest, Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, is being tracked by the Red Devils and has admitted: \"Of course, the Premier League is a fantastic league, one of the strongest in the world. It would be nice to play there one day,\" he said. \"Football has changed a lot, it's more physical, you have more to be an athlete, the tempo and intensity is higher. Of course, in England the intensity is very high, so I think it could suit me.\" Read the full story here . 15:22 Fraser Watson Player of the Season: Martinelli finishes third The official Arsenal wesbite has allowed vans to vote for the club's player of the season, and have just announced the third placed finisher.

According to Fanatik , the two Noth London rivals are interested in the Dane, as well as Spanish side Sevilla. He has a release clause worth €25 million (£21.4 million) written into his contract. Spurs have reportedly agreed to match that fee as they attempt to sign him. 14:27 Daniel Orme Pepe set for Arsenal return Arsenal's record signing Nicolas Pepe is set to return to the Emirates Stadium this summer with Nice not expected to pursue a permanent deal.

Previous reports were suggesting that the Gunners were willing to wait until after West Ham's Europa League final showdown with Fiorentina to open discussions. That game takes place this evening and regardless of the result, Arsenal will be keen to get moving on a deal. It is said that Arsenal value the England midfielder at £90m. 11:28 James Nursey Villa want answer from Arsenal target Aston Villa have told former Arsenal target Youri Tielemans they want a quick answer after making a move for the free agent.

See what he had to say here 10:29 KEY EVENT Arsenal 'open' Cancelo talks Arsenal will face competition in their bid to sign Manchester City's Joao Cancelo this summer, with both Real Madrid and Barcelona in the running to sign the full-back. According to Sky Sports , Arsenal have engaged in ‘early verbal talks’ to sign the Portuguese full-back, with his Man City future uncertain in the wake of a training ground bust-up with Pep Guardiola following the World Cup . However, Cancelo's own preference has been revealed to be a move to a La Liga club, with Real Madrid and Barcelona the leading candidates.

Apparemment, pas exactement ce qui a été rapporté, si on parle de l'agression du petit Kenzo… Rappel des faits : âgé de huit ans et atteint d'un cancer au cerveau, ce garçonnet de 8 ans était présent pour cette rencontre de la 38e journée de Ligue 1 . Un « rêve » qui s'est transformé en cauchemar quand il a été pris pour cible, avec ses parents, par plusieurs supporters du club corse. Une enquête avait été ouverte pour « violences en réunion », la LFP a déposé plainte et cette affaire a suscité des réactions jusqu'au sommet de l'Etat, le président Macron ayant réclamé des sanctions « claires et fortes » . Mais les sanctions ne seront peut-être pas celles qu'on attendait… Président de l'AC Ajaccio, Alain Orsoni signe jeudi un communiqué . « Il semblerait hélas, que les informations communiquées immédiatement après les faits, ne soient que très partiellement conformes à la réalité. Au début, je n'avais aucune raison de douter de la véracité des déclarations des parents du petit Kenzo, car il m'apparaissait impossible qu'ils aient pu vouloir instrumentaliser leur petit garçon malade à des fins de Bad Buzz. C'est pourquoi, soucieux de préserver les intérêts de mon club et sincèrement révolté, je me suis associé aux manifestations de soutien vis-à-vis de cette famille et condamné avec fermeté les faits tels qu'on les avait exposés », rappelle-t-il. Et de poursuivre : « Désormais, les éléments objectifs de l'enquête, et notamment le contenu de l'enregistrement de la vidéo-surveillance, révèlent que la vérité est toute autre et que la gravité des agissements de certains supporters ajacciens, au demeurant répréhensibles, ait été très nettement exagérée. » Ça fait pschitt ? Du coup, le club corse « se réserve la possibilité de faire valoir ses droits contre toutes personnes susceptibles d'avoir été à l'origine de ces informations erronées et ceux qui complaisamment, les ont relayées ». Renversement de situation total, avec donc les parents du petit Kenzo qui pourraient finalement être dans l'œil du cyclone ? Interrogé par Le Parisien , M. Orsoni s'exprime de manière beaucoup plus claire. « Forcément, quand j'ai appris ce qui s'était passé, j'étais dans l'émotion car l'acte tel qu'il a été présenté était ignoble. Mais j'ai été berné et manipulé. Attention, je n'excuse pas les trois jeunes qui sont entrés en loges pour voler un maillot. On peut juste condamner cette grosse bêtise », indique-t-il dans un premier temps. Avant de poursuivre : « Depuis dimanche, j'ai récolté des éléments précis que je tiens de la police. L'intrusion dans la loge n'a duré que 12 secondes. La maman, qui s'est répandue partout, n'était même pas présente. Elle peut donc raconter quoi ? Déjà, le gosse n'a pas été frappé. Toute la presse nationale a parlé de cette affaire et même le président de la République… Je me dois de défendre mon club. J'ai l'expérience du traitement que nous réservent de nombreux médias, donc je me dois de réagir. » Last but nos least, Alain Orsoni déclare qu'il se « réserve le droit de porter plainte » contre les parents du petit Kenzo.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:01:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"lefigaro","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Former Southampton star details journey from Man Utd transfer links to SEVENTH tier","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/southampton-jake-hesketh-man-utd-30166691","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Kieran King"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh has opened up on his career from the Premier League, into League One and now the seventh-tier of English football at 27","content":"In December 2014, Jake Hesketh fulfilled his lifelong dream when he came on for his Premier League debut in Southampton's game against Manchester United . Hesketh, 27, who is a boyhood United fan, came on for the final 20 minutes as Saints were beaten 2-1 by Louis van Gaal's side at St Mary's Stadium, with Robin van Persie scoring a brace for the Red Devils. Five days later, Hesketh made his first top-flight start in a 1-0 defeat at Burnley . Playing in the Premier League was what Hesketh wanted to achieve since he was a child. Speaking to Mirror Football on that experience, he recalled: \"It was my first time on the bench, I was never expecting to come on and it happened so quickly. Ex-Newcastle star recalls giving up ambulance driver job to become Premier League hero World's top 10 most valuable football club 'brands' as Man Utd climb and Liverpool drop \"You don’t have any time to process it, but I have looked back and realised that I’ve just played against some of the best players in the world. It’s obviously what you spent your life dreaming of really. It couldn’t really get any better at that point. I think playing in the Premier League was my dream.\" However, the midfielder had to wait almost another two years before making his next senior appearance. Hesketh scored his first and only Southampton goal in a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in September 2016, before playing in the Europa League against Hapoel Be'er Sheva. He added: \"Playing in Europe was mental, it was an atmosphere that you would have thought you would play in ever again. It was hostile and to just play in that kind of competition was really surreal. Jake Hesketh celebrates scoring his first Southampton goal ( Image: Getty Images) \"There is nothing like that kind of atmosphere, it happens a lot around Europe but as soon as you go to warm up there’s boos and whistles. Everything and it was the most hostile thing I have ever played in and in comparison to England, you won’t come across anything like how they do it over there.\" During that time, Hesketh was being linked with a shock transfer to Man Utd. The Daily Mail reported in 2016 that the Red Devils were considering a move for then 19-year-old Hesketh as they tried to compete with Manchester City ’s academy recruitment policy. \"It was a bit weird but as far as I know there was nothing to it,\" Hesketh claimed on the transfer interest. \"My family is from Manchester, that’s where I was born and I am a United fan so that made it a little bit weirder.\" Jake Hesketh enjoyed a loan spell at Burton ( Image: Getty Images) After another season in the Southampton academy, Hesketh decided to go out on loan for the first time in his career when he signed for Burton in 2018. The Brewers had just been relegated to League One and wanted to add quality to their squad. It is safe to say that the midfielder impressed during his time at the Pirelli Stadium. He played a key role in Burton’s run to the semi-final of the Carabao Cup against Man City and scored the winner in the quarter-final win at Middlesbrough. Hesketh scored a further two goals in a highly successful loan spell at the Brewers. \"I went to Burton until January, and then to MK Dons until the end of the season and got promoted,\" Hesketh added. \"At Burton, we got to the semi-final of the League Cup, which for a League One club, doesn’t happen very often. \"To score the winning goal in the quarter-finals was one of the highlights of my career. I was playing the best football of my career at that point, those two clubs that season, I was enjoying my football so much.\" Jake Hesketh's time at Burton was memorable ( Image: Getty Images) Hesketh's loan spell at Burton was cut-short in January 2019 and he immediately made the switch to promotion-chasing League Two outfit MK Dons for the remainder of the season. That was another move that paid off as The Dons snuck into the top-three on the final day. Hesketh continued: \"It was a great feeling because they had only just come down, and they were expecting to come back up. When I got there in January, they were eighth, a little bit off it, but we had a really good run, got ourselves into a good position. It came down to the last game of the season but the feeling after that game and the weekend was unbelievable.\" Unfortunately for Hesketh, his career trajectory has plummeted downhill ever since that summer. He spent time out on loan at Lincoln and Crawley but never really found a home before he was released by Southampton at the end of his contract in 2021. Although it was disappointing to leave Saints, Hesketh didn't have any regrets about his time at the club. \"I knew it was coming as I was 24, on loan at Crawley that year in League Two and I was realistic,\" he said. Jake Hesketh during his loan spell at Lincoln ( Image: Getty Images) \"I knew I wasn’t going to get another contract at a club that is playing in the Premier League. So, in that sense, it was fine because it didn’t come as a shock. Obviously it was disappointing and weird to move away from what you have known your whole life. I think having them loan spells, you get used to spending time away from the club, and where I was in my life, it was fine.\" Hesketh immediately found a new club following his departure and joined National League side Eastleigh. He made 60 appearances for the Spitfires, scoring six goals in a two-year spell before leaving at the end of this season. Once again, it didn’t take Hesketh long to find an employer. He made the two-tier drop to sign for Southern League Premier Division side Sholing on May 31. The news came as a huge shock to many fans on social media after what Hesketh achieved at Burton and MK Dons only a matter of years ago. Jake Hesketh was most recently at Eastleigh ( Image: Getty Images) But Hesketh has explained the decision. He said: \"I am really pleased to get the deal over the line. I first spoke to them around three to four weeks ago maybe. I went to a few of their games last year at the back end of last season and it all came together at the last minute. I am happy to get it sorted.\" \"It is definitely a club with ambition and the people in there want to do well,\" he added. \"I mean it’s tough to go for back-to-back promotions, but over the next couple of years it’s a club that will definitely be pushing to get into the National League South.\" The ex-Southampton star turned 27 in March and is arguably in the prime age of his career. Despite finding himself all the way down in the seventh-tier of English football, he wants to re-find his feet and enjoy his football again - something he hasn’t done in a number of years. Hesketh finished: \"I want to go and enjoy myself to be honest. When I was younger I absolutely loved playing football, but for the last few years, I would say not so much. I want to play with a smile on my face and play at a club that has that kind of feel, a tight knit group. \"I wouldn’t say there’s any unrealistic ambitions to go and do anything, but I want to enjoy myself. There will be a load of reasons for it, it’s a shame for me because it’s all what I’ve wanted to do growing up. \"To not like football anymore is a shame, but I hope I get that back at Sholing. If that can come hand-in-hand it would be perfect. I want to find a home and play football, hopefully at Sholing it will last longer than this season. I hope the relationship keeps growing.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30166903.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Jake-Hesketh-exclusive.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pep Guardiola's Champions League failures - from \"biggest f*** up\" to De Bruyne mistake","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiolas-champions-league-failures-30171817","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Alan Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester City are huge favourites to win their first Champions League against Inter Milan tomorrow as their head coach looks to correct more than a decade of bad luck, poor decisions and bizarre tinkering","content":"Twelve painful years have passed since Pep Guardiola last won the Champions League . But as one of the game’s defining head coaches prepares for a fifth final in the club competition that matters most, Manchester City are also looking to become the second English team to complete the treble – after neighbours United in 1999. The stakes could barely be higher against an unfancied Inter Milan. But how will the heavy favourites tag weigh on City and their head coach? Guardiola has long recognised that his time at City will not be defined by domestic success but delivering their first Champions League. “I will be judged, if we don't win it … I will be a failure here. I know that,” he said in 2020. Three seasons on that is a sentiment that feels even stronger. Transfer news LIVE: Ten Hag's Rice alternaive, Maddison price tag discovered, Liverpool latest Inside Champions League final plans for fans as UEFA bids to avoid repeat of Paris horror A narrative of Guardiola’s overthinking and tinkering in key moments has snowballed – he wants it too much – but equally there has been bad luck and the simple reality that his sides have faced an opponent that performed to a higher level. Year-by-year, blow-by-blow, here is a breakdown of where it has gone wrong for the Catalan since that exceptional Barcelona team destroyed Manchester United at Wembley in May 2011. Barcelona 2011-12 – semi-finals Looking to retain the title, it was plain-sailing all the way to the last four. Then Chelsea , under caretaker Roberto di Matteo, dug in deep to win the first leg 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta made it 2-1 to Barca at Camp Nou until Ramires gave Chelsea an away-goal lead by scoring in first-half added time and Fernando Torres forced Gary Neville to make some unusual noises on commentary with his added time breakaway goal. Bayern Munich 2013-14 – semi-finals Refreshed from a year off playing chess with Garry Kasparov in New York, Guardiola won four trophies in his first campaign at Bayern – but the Champions League was not among them. Having coasted through in a group featuring City, the German giants beat Arsenal and Manchester United on the way to the last four. But familiar foes Real Madrid were on supreme form as they won the opening meeting at the Bernabeu 1-0 before crushing Bayern 4-0 in Bavaria. But Guardiola took the blame, having made a late decision to use a 4-2-3-1 instead of a 4-3-3 before at the last minute changing his mind again and using a 4-2-4 that ended up being ripped apart. \"I got it wrong, man,” he said afterwards. “I got it totally wrong. It's a monumental f*** up. A total mess. The biggest f*** up of my life as a coach.” Guardiola reacts during the hammering dished out by Real Madrid in Munich. 2014-15 – semi-finals The pattern continues. After topping a group in which City were second, Bayern scored seven across two legs against Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto to tee up a meeting with Barca. In the first leg at Camp Nou, Bayern were without Robben and Franck Ribery and therefore set out to frustrate and man mark their hosts. “Pep Guardiola’s gone and shocked us all,” Neville said on commentary. Yet they did a half-decent job for 77 minutes before Lionel Messi struck twice in three minutes and Neymar scored a third in added time while the Bavarians were unable to produce a single attempt on target. Humbled but unwilling to accept defeat, Bayern scored three in the second leg only for Neymar to find the net twice more for the eventual champions. 2015-16 – semi-finals A defeat defined by Thomas Muller’s penalty miss. Saul Niguez gave Atletico Madrid a 1-0 lead in the first leg in Spain but Xabi Alonso cancelled that out half an hour into the second with a deflected free kick. Then Muller had a chance to put his team in front from 12 yards, after Javi Martinez was felled, only to be denied by Jan Oblak. Nine minutes into the second half, the sucker punch arrived as Antoine Griezmann put Atletico 2-1 up on aggregate. Robert Lewandowski made it 2-2 but Diego Simeone’s team advanced on away goals. “Titles are just numbers, statistics,” Guardiola said. “I wanted to reach the Champions League final here and I didn’t achieve it but it doesn’t change my opinion about the way I have performed.” City, meanwhile, bowed out in the other semi against Real. Jan Oblak saves a penalty kick from Thomas Muller in 2016. Manchester City 2016-17 - round of 16 Still in the process of implementing his vision, Guardiola led City into the knockout stages despite a 4-0 thrashing away to Barcelona in the group stages. They scored six across two legs in the last 16 tie with Monaco – including five in the first leg at home – only to crash out on away goals to a team featuring Kylian Mbappe, Fabinho and future City players Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva. \"We will improve but this competition is so demanding,\" Guardiola said. \"Sometimes we have to be special and be lucky. We were not.\" 2017-18 - quarter-finals It was progress on a year previous but City were unable to handle an aggressive Liverpool in the first game at Anfield as Jurgen Klopp’s team scored three without reply. The reverse fixture saw City put up a fight as Gabriel Jesus scored but Guardiola ended up being shown a red card for protesting a Leroy Sane goal that was incorrectly ruled out. “He’s a referee who likes to feel different, he’s special,” Guardiola said of Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz afterwards. “When everybody sees things he is going to see the opposite. It’s too much to send off because I didn’t say any wrong word.” Regardless, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino scored to send Liverpool through 5-1 on aggregate. Leroy Sane appeals after his goal was wrongly ruled out for offside. 2018-19 - quarter-finals If Guardiola could blame the officials for halting their fightback against Liverpool, the 2019 defeat to Tottenham was a case of City’s head coach allowing his tinkering to sabotage their chances. While the dramatic second leg, ending in a 4-3 win for City that again saw them bow out on away goals, is what lives long in the memory a feeling remains that the damage was done in north London as Guardiola used Fabian Delph at full back, started Kevin De Bruyne on the bench and used Ilkay Gundogan in a defensive role … and Spurs decisively won 1-0. Raheem Sterling did see an added time goal ruled out in that remarkable second leg, leaving Guardiola to declare: \"It's tough, it's cruel but we have to accept it.” If only the team was set up differently for the opening game. 2019-20 - quarter-finals Things were looking good before the pandemic struck as Real Madrid were overcome in the round of 16 but City, who would finish second in the Premier League to Liverpool, looked dazed in a one-off last-eight tie against Lyon as the French side – relative minnows in a financial sense – found plenty of joy on the counterattack against a back three. David Silva, Bernardo, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez were among the substitutes, leading to Guardiola’s selection being criticised again. \"We tried to cover our weak points in comparison with their strong points,\" he said. \"Except in the first 20 minutes, we struggled to find our spaces to attack them.\" Guardiola walks off with a runners-up medal after the defeat to Chelsea in Porto. 2020-21 - final With the coronavirus keeping the turnstiles closed for almost the entire season, City waltzed into the final and were heavy favourites to beat Chelsea in Porto. But Guardiola decided to play without a defensive midfielder – leaving Rodri and Fernandinho on the bench – as Kai Havertz’s first half goal earned the West London club a second European Cup. City did bemoan the early loss of De Bruyne through a nasty facial injury inflicted by Antonio Rudiger but the Premier League champions did not do enough. 2021-22 - semi-finals Another semi-final, another meeting with Real Madrid and the late collapse to beat all late collapses. The first leg, in Manchester, was a barnstormer that City edged 4-3 and if it was not for the excellence of Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema they would have been out of sight heading to Spain for the second game. Yet City retained a semblance of control at the Bernabeu before Riyad Mahrez looked to have scored the decisive goal. In the 90th minute, City led 5-3 and, again, it would have been more if Jack Grealish had not been twice denied. But Rodrygo scored two in as many minutes, brought the game to extra time and Karim Benzema scored from the penalty spot to complete the turnaround and leave City heartbroken all over again. “Football is unpredictable and you have to accept it,” Guardiola said.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 07:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30175437.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Real-Madrid-v-Manchester-City-Semi-Final-Leg-Two-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"EPL: He’s a good person – Jack Wilshere lauds Arsenal target","link":"https://dailypost.ng/2023/06/09/epl-hes-a-good-person-jack-wilshere-lauds-arsenal-target/","keywords":["Sport","arsenal","EPL","Jack Wilshere"],"creator":["Don Silas"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Arsenal midfielder, Jack Wilshere has heaped praises on the club’s summer target, Declan Rice, for his outstanding performances for both club and country over the past two seasons.

The 27-year-old is ready to leave the Bees this summer after twice rejecting the offer of a new Brentford contract. 1 Brentford are demanding at least £40m for Man Utd and Spurs target David Raya Credit: Getty He now only has 12 months remaining on his current deal. We revealed how Raya, 27, is ready to make the move across London after emerging as Spurs’ first choice to replace veteran captain Hugo Lloris this summer. United, who have told David De Gea he is not assured of being No1 next season if he pens an extension , are also targeting the star. However, a new update from Sky Sports has cast doubts on his exit. They state that both United and Spurs “do not currently agree that Raya is worth that amount” with just one-year remaining on his contract. And they add that “there has been no contact yet with the Bees”. The player’s representatives have threatened to allow Raya to run down his contract and walk away as a free agent next year if Brentford don’t agree to sell him during this transfer window. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is resigned to losing Raya, who cost the club just £3m when they signed him from Blackburn in 2019.

Dans un hôtel de l'ouest de Paris, les quelque 200 élus du football français - amateur et professionnel - sont invités à se prononcer sur l'identité du dirigeant amené à terminer le mandat en cours. Après onze années aux commandes de la Fédération sportive la plus puissante de France, Le Graët n'a pu mener celui-ci à son terme, victime d'une accumulation de polémiques et d'accusations qui l'ont poussé vers la sortie, fin février. Le Breton a tout de même été invité à l'AG et il est attendu samedi matin dans le XVIIe arrondissement, même s'il ne sera pas, cette fois, le maître de cérémonie de ces états généraux du football français. Son vice-président Philippe Diallo, devenu numéro 1 par intérim depuis le début de l'année, sollicite la confiance des élus (clubs, ligues locales, districts) pour poursuivre son action jusqu'à l'Assemblée élective de la fin 2024. Homme d'ombre et de dossiers, apprécié pour sa discrétion comme pour son écoute, cet ancien patron du syndicat des clubs professionnels (59 ans) dispose d'une cote élevée pour symboliser l'apaisement souhaité par le milieu après des mois de turbulences. Même si certains opposants ont tenté, au début du printemps, de réunir assez d'élus pour renverser l'actuel comité exécutif de la « 3F », la confirmation de Diallo samedi semble acquise aux yeux de tous les acteurs du football interrogés ces dernières semaines. « Après quelques mois d'exercice, je pense qu'on peut dire que la Fédération fonctionne. On est même en train de commencer sa transformation. Il y a besoin de retrouver de l'apaisement et j'espère avoir déjà contribué à cela », assurait le dirigeant début avril dans un entretien à l'AFP. Le football professionnel, qui remet ses droits TV sur le marché à la rentrée, compte notamment sur ce profil pour assurer une transition fluide et stable, loin du tumulte de l'automne et de l'hiver. Les accusations de harcèlement moral et sexuel visant Le Graët , les polémiques et autres dérapages ont en effet accompagné le début de saison du football français, épinglé en février par un audit de l'Inspection générale de l'éducation, du sport et de la recherche (IGESR), accablant pour la « Fédé » comme pour ses dirigeants. Même si le calme est progressivement revenu, les secousses ne sont jamais loin, à l'image de la fronde historique des joueuses de l'équipe de France ayant abouti au remplacement de la sélectionneuse Corinne Diacre par Hervé Renard. Jeudi, d'autres accusations de « harcèlement moral et sexuel » émises dans le magazine So Foot par un ex-arbitre actuellement coordinateur fédéral de l'arbitrage amateur, Nicolas Pottier, ont à nouveau assombri l'horizon. La FFF a immédiatement diligenté une enquête interne sur la gestion fédérale de l'arbitrage. Dans ce contexte incertain, l'Assemblée fédérale doit aussi voter la nomination de deux futurs membres du comité exécutif de la FFF, les présidents de district Claude Delforge et Alexandre Gougnard. Avec la démission de Le Graët et celle de Jamel Sandjak, président de la Ligue de Paris-Île de France en désaccord avec la direction prise par le « Comex », deux places s'étaient en effet libérées dans ce « gouvernement » du foot français. La Fédération présentera également son budget prévisionnel pour la saison 2023-24 et celui-ci sera déficitaire, une rareté. La baisse des droits audiovisuels de la Coupe de France, le limogeage de Corinne Diacre, l'effort de 4 à 5 millions d'euros supplémentaires consentis en faveur du football féminin et d'une future Ligue féminine professionnelle expliquent ainsi en partie le déficit prévisionnel estimé à 4,7 millions d'euros. Mais celui-ci pourrait être comblé, notamment si l'équipe de France féminine brille au Mondial cet été en Australie. La FFF table en effet sur un quart de finale dans ses prévisions financières. Un meilleur parcours des Bleues serait un bonus bienvenu pour les caisses fédérales.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:41:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"lefigaro","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Arsenal transfer news LIVE: Caicedo bid, Rice decision, Cancelo talks opened, Lazio eye Jorginho","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-live-caicedo-30100616","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Nathan Ridley"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mikel Arteta wants to refresh Arsenal's midfield during the summer transfer window and is centring his plans around Declan Rice, who's confirmed to be leaving West Ham over the coming weeks","content":"Arsenal are going on the offensive with the summer transfer window set to open in less than a week's time. Mikel Arteta and co have until next Wednesday before the window officially opens, but plenty of groundwork is being done to put the Gunners in the best possible position. Declan Rice is Arteta's No.1 transfer target and his hopes received a major boost yesterday when West Ham owner David Sullivan confirmed that the England international will be allowed to leave the Irons this summer . Meanwhile, Manchester City star Ilkay Gundogan is high on Arteta's shopping list, as is Brighton's Moises Caicedo. City want to give Gundogan - soon to be a free agent - a new contract, while Caicedo is another player who'll be sold if the price is right. Arsenal have also opened talks with City's out-of-favour full-back, Joao Cancelo , a target for Barcelona and Real Madrid .

According to Sky Sports , Arsenal have engaged in 'early verbal talks' to sign the Portuguese full-back, with his Man City future uncertain in the wake of a training ground bust-up with Pep Guardiola following the World Cup.

Caicedo, 21, will be allowed to leave the Seagulls this summer should their asking price be met. Moises Caicedo has been linked with a move to Arsenal ( Image: Getty Images) 07:27 Nathan Ridley Good morning Hello and welcome to today's live Arsenal transfer blog! We've got plenty on the agenda, so let's get straight into it. 15:50 Fraser Watson Saka second in player of the season vote We revealed yesterday that Arsenal fans had voted Gabriel Martinelli as the third placed finisher in their player of the season poll. And now the official club website has confirmed Buyako Saka has finished second. After 48 games, 15 goals, and 11 assists, it was some campaign for the 21-year-old. 15:25 Fraser Watson Arsenal's pursuit of Caicedo takes a twist Arsenal were reportedly closing in on Brighton star Moises Caicedo after agreeing terms with the star , but that saga has seemingly turned. According to Fabrizio Romano , Chelsea are currently leading the race to sign the Ecuadorian midfielder, with the valuation set between £70million and £80million. Romano claims that Caicedo hasn't agreed personal terms with any club, contrasting previous reports. 14:56 Jacob Leeks Arsenal confirm Nurnberg friendly Arsenal have confirmed a pre-season friendly against FC Nurnberg next month. The Gunners will take on the 2. Bundesliga side at Adidas' HQ during a training camp in Germany. Sporting director Edu said: “We're excited to begin our pre-season schedule at adidas HQ, and thank adidas for hosting us again at their world-class campus. Our match against 1. FC Nürnberg is another good opportunity to help Mikel and the squad prepare ahead of the new season. 14:01 Jacob Leeks Rice makes his feelings clear on Arsenal transfer plan Declan Rice was reluctant to be drawn into speculation over his next move amid reports linking him with a move to Arsenal. The England international, 24, has been tipped to leave the London Stadium at the end of the season and has emerged as Mikel Arteta's top summer transfer target in recent weeks. Recent reports have claimed that Arsenal planned to approach West Ham over a blockbuster deal for their talisman once they had played in the Europa Conference League final, which they won on Wednesday night . Even though the Gunners are now poised to firm up their interest, Rice was reluctant to entertain the idea of moving on in the aftermath of West Ham's big win - although he refused to rule out a move completely. Click here to read the full story. 13:20 Jacob Leeks Rice warned off Arsenal move Premier League icon David James has warned Declan Rice off making a move to Arsenal this summer. \"I think he is in a similar situation as Harry Kane, whereby West Ham fans would not begrudge him a move. Personally, I would love to see him play abroad for two reasons,\" he told King Casino Bonus . “The first, from a selfish point of view, is that I wouldn’t have to see him playing against West Ham! He’d undoubtedly cause them all sorts of problems as well, because he is such a solid professional and would take the emotion out of it. \"But secondly, for him personally, he would gain so much experience from playing abroad. You look at the success of Jude Bellingham at Borussia Dortmund, there is no reason why Rice couldn’t follow suit and go and become a legend with a foreign club, before returning to the UK as a much more developed player. “He could experience football in the same way I did when I was very late in my career; experiencing a new culture, becoming a more rounded player. I think we would all be able to enjoy Declan Rice on another level.” 11:25 Jacob Leeks Lazio eye Jorginho move Lazio are lining up a move for Jorginho, with Maurizio Sarri keen to reunite with the midfielder. The Italian still has a year remaining on his contract at Arsenal. But Sarri is hopeful he can convince him to return to Serie A. According to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Sarri has held talks with club president Claudio Lotito, with Jorginho one of the names mentioned. 10:39 KEY EVENT Rice exit confirmed by West Ham owner West Ham owner David Sullivan has confirmed that Declan Rice has played his last game for the club after winning the Europa Conference League. \"I think it has to be [his last game]. We promised him he could go. He set his heart on going. You can't ask for a man who has committed more to us this season. In due course, he has to get on and we have to get a replacement - or several replacements,\" Sullivan told talkSPORT. \"It's not something we want to happen. We offered him £200,000-a-week 18 months ago. He turned it down. It's cost him £10million to stay at West Ham in that time (in lost wages). And he wants to go. You can't keep a player who doesn't want to be there.\" Click here to read the full story. 09:41 Jacob Leeks Arsenal miss out on Guerreiro Arsenal are set to miss out on Raphael Guerreiro, with the Portugal international heading to Bayern Munich. The Gunners had been eyeing Guerreiro as a potential target, but reports now suggest that he has instead reached an agreement with Bayern. Terms have been agreed for a three-year contract, with his arrival at the Allianz expected next week. 09:04 Jacob Leeks Rice's transfer admission throws curveball to Gunners Declan Rice has thrown a curveball at Manchester United and Arsenal by admitting he may yet stay at West Ham beyond this summer. Rice captained the Hammers to winning the Europa Conference League on Wednesday night. Jarrod Bowen scored a last-minute winner to beat Fiorentina in the final of the competition in Prague, with Rice having been at his imperious best. The 2-1 victory means that the England international became the first West Ham player since Bobby Moore in 1965 to lift a European trophy. But there has been intense speculation about his future , with a belief that he will depart the London Stadium this summer.

The club are prepared planning to terminate his contract if he can't be sold this summer, according to a report from Football London . He spent this past season on loan with Nice, scoring eight goals in all competitions, including six in Ligue 1. 16:33 Fraser Watson Arsenal boosted by Bellingham move Arsenal were never in the race to sign Jude Bellingham this summer, but they'll be relieved the teenage star isn't heading to a Premier League rival either. Liverpool had long pursued the English international, whilst Man United's interest had long cooled. But Borussia Dortmund have agreed a deal with Real Madrid for around £108 million. Of course, the Gunners could still face him in the Champions League.... 16:01 Fraser Watson United eye up another option as Arsenal lead race for Rice Manchester United's interest in Declan Rice could now cool after another of their midfield targets expressed his desire to head to England. A player who Rice will line-up against in the Europa Conference final in Budapest, Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, is being tracked by the Red Devils and has admitted: \"Of course, the Premier League is a fantastic league, one of the strongest in the world. It would be nice to play there one day,\" he said. \"Football has changed a lot, it's more physical, you have more to be an athlete, the tempo and intensity is higher. Of course, in England the intensity is very high, so I think it could suit me.\" Read the full story here . 15:22 Fraser Watson Player of the Season: Martinelli finishes third The official Arsenal wesbite has allowed vans to vote for the club's player of the season, and have just announced the third placed finisher.

According to Fanatik , the two Noth London rivals are interested in the Dane, as well as Spanish side Sevilla. He has a release clause worth €25 million (£21.4 million) written into his contract. Spurs have reportedly agreed to match that fee as they attempt to sign him. 14:27 Daniel Orme Pepe set for Arsenal return Arsenal's record signing Nicolas Pepe is set to return to the Emirates Stadium this summer with Nice not expected to pursue a permanent deal. The Ivorian joined the Ligue 1 side on a season-long loan deal at the start of the campaign and scored eight goals in 28 appearances in all competitions. However, according to Nice-Matin , the club are not going to pursue a permanent move. That once again sees Pepe's future go up in the air. 13:31 KEY EVENT Arsenal handed double Saudi blow Mikel Arteta's transfer plans have suffered a dent as Arsenal look set to miss out on two targets who are the subject of interest from multiple clubs in Saudi Arabia. Both Ilkay Gundogan and N'Golo Kante were players the Gunners boss was rumoured to be keen on bringing to the Emirates.

The American has never played for the Gunners on a senior basis and spent last season on-loan woth Championship side Birmingham City. He was named as the Blues' player of the year and according to football.london , Arsenal will now cash-in on the centre-back. 11:59 KEY EVENT Arsenal to kick-off Rice negotiations Arsenal could kick-off their talks with West Ham regarding the signing of Declan Rice within hours. Previous reports were suggesting that the Gunners were willing to wait until after West Ham's Europa League final showdown with Fiorentina to open discussions. That game takes place this evening and regardless of the result, Arsenal will be keen to get moving on a deal. It is said that Arsenal value the England midfielder at £90m. 11:28 James Nursey Villa want answer from Arsenal target Aston Villa have told former Arsenal target Youri Tielemans they want a quick answer after making a move for the free agent. Villa boss Unai Emery hopes the lure of European football can tempt the Belgian international ,26, after they finished seventh. Tielemans’ representatives have been approached with Emery keen to push ahead with strengthening his squad in central midfield. Emery also wants a new winger with targets including Leicester’s Harvey Barnes and Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams. 10:59 Daniel Orme Nelson claim resurfaces Reiss Nelson is thought to be on the verge of signing a new contract at Arsenal despite at one point seeming destined for the Emirates exit. Late last year, Nelson spoke exclusively to Mirror Football and waxed lyrical over the impact Arteta has had on the Gunners and certainly didn't speak like a man who had any interest in ending his Arsenal stay. See what he had to say here 10:29 KEY EVENT Arsenal 'open' Cancelo talks Arsenal will face competition in their bid to sign Manchester City's Joao Cancelo this summer, with both Real Madrid and Barcelona in the running to sign the full-back.

German outlet Kicker (via Besoccer ) report Cancelo's plans, with a wish to join either of the Spanish giants in a deal which could amount to €50 million (£43m).

Apparemment, pas exactement ce qui a été rapporté, si on parle de l'agression du petit Kenzo… Rappel des faits : âgé de huit ans et atteint d'un cancer au cerveau, ce garçonnet de 8 ans était présent pour cette rencontre de la 38e journée de Ligue 1 . Un « rêve » qui s'est transformé en cauchemar quand il a été pris pour cible, avec ses parents, par plusieurs supporters du club corse. Une enquête avait été ouverte pour « violences en réunion », la LFP a déposé plainte et cette affaire a suscité des réactions jusqu'au sommet de l'Etat, le président Macron ayant réclamé des sanctions « claires et fortes » .

Au début, je n'avais aucune raison de douter de la véracité des déclarations des parents du petit Kenzo, car il m'apparaissait impossible qu'ils aient pu vouloir instrumentaliser leur petit garçon malade à des fins de Bad Buzz. C'est pourquoi, soucieux de préserver les intérêts de mon club et sincèrement révolté, je me suis associé aux manifestations de soutien vis-à-vis de cette famille et condamné avec fermeté les faits tels qu'on les avait exposés », rappelle-t-il. Et de poursuivre : « Désormais, les éléments objectifs de l'enquête, et notamment le contenu de l'enregistrement de la vidéo-surveillance, révèlent que la vérité est toute autre et que la gravité des agissements de certains supporters ajacciens, au demeurant répréhensibles, ait été très nettement exagérée. » Ça fait pschitt ? Du coup, le club corse « se réserve la possibilité de faire valoir ses droits contre toutes personnes susceptibles d'avoir été à l'origine de ces informations erronées et ceux qui complaisamment, les ont relayées ». Renversement de situation total, avec donc les parents du petit Kenzo qui pourraient finalement être dans l'œil du cyclone ? Interrogé par Le Parisien , M. Orsoni s'exprime de manière beaucoup plus claire. « Forcément, quand j'ai appris ce qui s'était passé, j'étais dans l'émotion car l'acte tel qu'il a été présenté était ignoble. Mais j'ai été berné et manipulé. Attention, je n'excuse pas les trois jeunes qui sont entrés en loges pour voler un maillot. On peut juste condamner cette grosse bêtise », indique-t-il dans un premier temps. Avant de poursuivre : « Depuis dimanche, j'ai récolté des éléments précis que je tiens de la police. L'intrusion dans la loge n'a duré que 12 secondes. La maman, qui s'est répandue partout, n'était même pas présente. Elle peut donc raconter quoi ? Déjà, le gosse n'a pas été frappé. Toute la presse nationale a parlé de cette affaire et même le président de la République… Je me dois de défendre mon club. J'ai l'expérience du traitement que nous réservent de nombreux médias, donc je me dois de réagir. » Last but nos least, Alain Orsoni déclare qu'il se « réserve le droit de porter plainte » contre les parents du petit Kenzo.","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:01:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"lefigaro","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Former Southampton star details journey from Man Utd transfer links to SEVENTH tier","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/southampton-jake-hesketh-man-utd-30166691","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Kieran King"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh has opened up on his career from the Premier League, into League One and now the seventh-tier of English football at 27","content":"In December 2014, Jake Hesketh fulfilled his lifelong dream when he came on for his Premier League debut in Southampton's game against Manchester United . Hesketh, 27, who is a boyhood United fan, came on for the final 20 minutes as Saints were beaten 2-1 by Louis van Gaal's side at St Mary's Stadium, with Robin van Persie scoring a brace for the Red Devils. Five days later, Hesketh made his first top-flight start in a 1-0 defeat at Burnley . Playing in the Premier League was what Hesketh wanted to achieve since he was a child. Speaking to Mirror Football on that experience, he recalled: \"It was my first time on the bench, I was never expecting to come on and it happened so quickly. Ex-Newcastle star recalls giving up ambulance driver job to become Premier League hero World's top 10 most valuable football club 'brands' as Man Utd climb and Liverpool drop \"You don’t have any time to process it, but I have looked back and realised that I’ve just played against some of the best players in the world. It’s obviously what you spent your life dreaming of really. It couldn’t really get any better at that point. I think playing in the Premier League was my dream.\" However, the midfielder had to wait almost another two years before making his next senior appearance. Hesketh scored his first and only Southampton goal in a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in September 2016, before playing in the Europa League against Hapoel Be'er Sheva. He added: \"Playing in Europe was mental, it was an atmosphere that you would have thought you would play in ever again. It was hostile and to just play in that kind of competition was really surreal. Jake Hesketh celebrates scoring his first Southampton goal ( Image: Getty Images) \"There is nothing like that kind of atmosphere, it happens a lot around Europe but as soon as you go to warm up there’s boos and whistles. Everything and it was the most hostile thing I have ever played in and in comparison to England, you won’t come across anything like how they do it over there.\" During that time, Hesketh was being linked with a shock transfer to Man Utd. The Daily Mail reported in 2016 that the Red Devils were considering a move for then 19-year-old Hesketh as they tried to compete with Manchester City ’s academy recruitment policy. \"It was a bit weird but as far as I know there was nothing to it,\" Hesketh claimed on the transfer interest. \"My family is from Manchester, that’s where I was born and I am a United fan so that made it a little bit weirder.\" Jake Hesketh enjoyed a loan spell at Burton ( Image: Getty Images) After another season in the Southampton academy, Hesketh decided to go out on loan for the first time in his career when he signed for Burton in 2018. The Brewers had just been relegated to League One and wanted to add quality to their squad. It is safe to say that the midfielder impressed during his time at the Pirelli Stadium. He played a key role in Burton’s run to the semi-final of the Carabao Cup against Man City and scored the winner in the quarter-final win at Middlesbrough. Hesketh scored a further two goals in a highly successful loan spell at the Brewers. \"I went to Burton until January, and then to MK Dons until the end of the season and got promoted,\" Hesketh added. \"At Burton, we got to the semi-final of the League Cup, which for a League One club, doesn’t happen very often. \"To score the winning goal in the quarter-finals was one of the highlights of my career. I was playing the best football of my career at that point, those two clubs that season, I was enjoying my football so much.\" Jake Hesketh's time at Burton was memorable ( Image: Getty Images) Hesketh's loan spell at Burton was cut-short in January 2019 and he immediately made the switch to promotion-chasing League Two outfit MK Dons for the remainder of the season. That was another move that paid off as The Dons snuck into the top-three on the final day. Hesketh continued: \"It was a great feeling because they had only just come down, and they were expecting to come back up. When I got there in January, they were eighth, a little bit off it, but we had a really good run, got ourselves into a good position. It came down to the last game of the season but the feeling after that game and the weekend was unbelievable.\" Unfortunately for Hesketh, his career trajectory has plummeted downhill ever since that summer. He spent time out on loan at Lincoln and Crawley but never really found a home before he was released by Southampton at the end of his contract in 2021. Although it was disappointing to leave Saints, Hesketh didn't have any regrets about his time at the club. \"I knew it was coming as I was 24, on loan at Crawley that year in League Two and I was realistic,\" he said.

So, in that sense, it was fine because it didn’t come as a shock. Obviously it was disappointing and weird to move away from what you have known your whole life. I think having them loan spells, you get used to spending time away from the club, and where I was in my life, it was fine.\" Hesketh immediately found a new club following his departure and joined National League side Eastleigh. He made 60 appearances for the Spitfires, scoring six goals in a two-year spell before leaving at the end of this season. Once again, it didn’t take Hesketh long to find an employer. He made the two-tier drop to sign for Southern League Premier Division side Sholing on May 31. The news came as a huge shock to many fans on social media after what Hesketh achieved at Burton and MK Dons only a matter of years ago. Jake Hesketh was most recently at Eastleigh ( Image: Getty Images) But Hesketh has explained the decision. He said: \"I am really pleased to get the deal over the line. I first spoke to them around three to four weeks ago maybe. I went to a few of their games last year at the back end of last season and it all came together at the last minute. I am happy to get it sorted.\" \"It is definitely a club with ambition and the people in there want to do well,\" he added. \"I mean it’s tough to go for back-to-back promotions, but over the next couple of years it’s a club that will definitely be pushing to get into the National League South.\" The ex-Southampton star turned 27 in March and is arguably in the prime age of his career. Despite finding himself all the way down in the seventh-tier of English football, he wants to re-find his feet and enjoy his football again - something he hasn’t done in a number of years. Hesketh finished: \"I want to go and enjoy myself to be honest. When I was younger I absolutely loved playing football, but for the last few years, I would say not so much. I want to play with a smile on my face and play at a club that has that kind of feel, a tight knit group. \"I wouldn’t say there’s any unrealistic ambitions to go and do anything, but I want to enjoy myself. There will be a load of reasons for it, it’s a shame for me because it’s all what I’ve wanted to do growing up. \"To not like football anymore is a shame, but I hope I get that back at Sholing. If that can come hand-in-hand it would be perfect. I want to find a home and play football, hopefully at Sholing it will last longer than this season. I hope the relationship keeps growing.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-09 06:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30166903.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Jake-Hesketh-exclusive.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}]}
