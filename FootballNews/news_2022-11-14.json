His assertion comes after the World Boxing Council (WBC) retroactively adjudged Jeff Fenech the winner of his first bout with Azumah Nelson in 1991. The Australian boxing legend was retroactively awarded the WBC Super Featherweight title at a WBC convention in Acapulco, Mexico, last Tuesday. Azumah, in his response, was disappointed with the verdict by the WBC, which was happening for the first time in professional boxing. “Reviewing results and awarding titles to boxers many decades after a fight is a dangerous precedent. This is happening for the first time in professional boxing, and they decided to start with me. “I am not worried about the decision, as it doesn’t change my legacy in boxing history, nor would it change anything going forward. If this will help Jeff Fenech to sleep well at night, I am happy for him,” the “Professor,” as he is affectionately known, said. Azumah added that this precedent would open the doors for many boxers to petition the WBC on grounds of disagreement with judges’ decisions years ago, and this, according to him, would not add any value to the sport of boxing. “This has the proclivity to create credibility issues for the sport if not managed properly. If the WBC wants to introduce a review panel or Video Assistant Referee (VAR) as done in football, I would think they start with the current generation, who would then have the opportunity to fight again or have the belt returned to the right winner and be contested for. “This decision by the WBC means I went to Australia in 1992 as a challenger and not the champion going to defend his title. This is very interesting,” he stated. Azumah further appreciated all who took to social media to vent their dissatisfaction with the WBC decision and assured them that he was not perturbed about it.

The injury may keep him out of action for several months. Marseille continued on the authority of Harith (25 years), who returned to the ranks of Marseille after playing with him in the second half of last season on loan from Schalke 04, “He is currently undergoing medical examinations to provide appropriate care for his injury. The player will follow an appropriate care protocol. Harith was injured in the 58th minute during an intervention with Axel Dizzy, so he stayed on the field for some time, before the Marseille medical staff intervened in order to transfer him to the dressing rooms on a stretcher, leaving his place to Dimitri Payet, who seemed affected by seeing his Moroccan colleague in pain. And the Moroccan player said before the Monaco match, “Starting from the time we start to pay attention to injuries, then we fall into the injury trap. I will play as a normal match. I will give everything, and when you give everything, you try to avoid injuries.” Harith, who participated in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, added, “We must play the matches 100% and not think about the World Cup. The World Cup will come later. If we play it, it will be good, and if we suffer an injury in the last match, it will be our destiny. On Monday, Desizzy was called up to the French squad to replace injured defender Prisnel Kimpembe.

Many have criticised the timing of the friendly after many players are set to break up before the Qatar tournament. And the Scots have named a number of drop outs ahead of the midweek match.

Fired barbs aside, there's no doubt the pair have had amazing careers, built up huge wealth, scored glam Wags , and have a lifestyle that's enviable of the football world. And, of course, there's been controversies along the way... Lethal pairing Ronaldo might not have played the best football of his career at United, but when he played alongside Rooney from 2004-2009 they formed a lethal partnership. They won three league titles together, as well as the Champions League in their five years at Old Trafford leading the Red Devils front line. A counter-attacking goal against Arsenal at the Emirates in a Champions League semi-final epitomised the chemistry the pair had on the pitch. Ronaldo managed 118 goals in 292 games, scooping the Golden Boot in 2008. Rooney would go on to become United's all-time top goalscorer with 253 goals from 559 matches. When Ronaldo left United, he grew into a bigger superstar - scoring 450 goals for Real Madrid in just 438 games and adding four more Champions League titles to his name. He would then win Serie A with Juventus twice, before returning to United where he reached 700 career club goals. Internationally, his career knows no bounds. With 117 goals for Portugal he's scored more than anyone else in international football, as well as lifted the European Championships. Rooney did become England's all-time top scorer, but looks likely to lose that mantle to Harry Kane. 16 Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney formed a lethal partnership for Man Utd Credit: Getty 16 Ronaldo and Rooney won three Premier League titles together in just five years Credit: Getty - Contributor After leaving United, spells at Everton, then DC United wound down his career. Derby County gave Roon a return to our shores, but went back across the pond to manage DC United following the Rams' relegation. Wags Rooney and Ronaldo, because of their high-profiles, were always going to have their love-lives splashed on the front pages. Rooney went for his childhood sweetheart, Coleen . After growing up together in Croxteth from the age of 12, they married in a glitzy ceremony in Portofino, Italy. The wedding was paid for by OK! Magazine who were said to have secured the rights to details and pictures of the nuptials for a cool £2.5million. They have four sons together, Kai, Klay, Kit, and Cass. Ronaldo was linked to a string of beautiful women in the past, and dated Russian supermodel Irina Shayk. But, after playing the field, he fell in love with former shop assistant Georgina Rodriguez. The Spanish stunner has since blossomed into a marketing man's dream, inking a reported five-figure Instagram deal with fashion house Pretty Little Thing, and is ambassador for the group alongside Kourtney Kardashian and Molly-Mae Hague. 16 Coleen Rooney is Wayne's high-school sweetheart Credit: Splash 16 Ronaldo fell for the charms of former shop assistant Georgina Rodriguez Credit: The Mega Agency 16 Rodriguez was pregnant with twins but sadly lost the son Credit: Instagram / @georginagio 16 The Rooneys pose for a Christmas snap And if that's not enough, she's the star of her own Netflix reality TV series I Am Georgina. Not to be outdone, Coleen appears in Rooney - an Amazon Prime documentary - and talks about the early stages of their romance as well as claims of cheating in their relationship. Like the Rooneys, Cristiano and Georgina have their own brood. She gave birth to Bella earlier this year to join Cristiano Jr, Eva Maria, Alana Martina and Mateo, but sadly lost Bella's twin while giving birth. Glam lifestyles Money is certainly no object for the pair, who boast incredible fortunes. Rooney is said to be worth around £144m, while Ronaldo has amassed a pot worth £425m. That's meant off the pitch they live a life of luxury, from living in mansions, driving expensive cars, owning super yachts and flying in private jets. After four years of delays, the Rooneys finally moved into their £20m Cheshire home. Called 'Mini-Versailles', the six-bedroom home sits on 40 acres of land. It houses a television room, bar, wine store, snooker room, cinema, gym, hot tub, swimming pool, plunge pool and steam room. There is also not one but two lifts - one for the family to use and another for visitors. Outside it boasts stables, a six-car garage, an orangery and two man-made fishing lakes. 16 Rooney's £20million Cheshire mansion was finally completed last year 16 Ronaldo has amassed a fortune of around £363m Credit: Instagram 16 This stunning villa in Marbella is one of Ronaldo's prized possessions Ronaldo is back in Manchester and renting a mansion that used to belong to Andy Cole. However, the jewel of his property empire is in Marbella. In 2019, Ronaldo reportedly spent £1.4m on a holiday home in the Costa del Sol. The area the lavish house sits in is called 'The Superstars Cul-De-Sac' because of the number of famous residents who live there. UFC star Conor McGregor is also believed to own a property nearby. It's got four bedrooms, high-vaulted ceilings and incredible views of the sea. There's a private golf course, the driveway is lit up by LED lights, it has a private gym, an in-built cinema and infinity pool. Ronaldo has also spent his well-earned cash on a luxury £5.5m yacht and a £20m private jet. And his £17m car collection is one of the best in sport - boasting high-profile motors including a Bugatti Centodieci worth £8.5m. Most recently, he was seen in a £200,000 Aston Martin DBS driving into Carrington. Rooney has the old footballers' favourite - a £150,000 Land Rover, among his fleet.

On it, the pair were famously embroiled in \"Winkergate\" - when the Portuguese superstar saw his then team-mate sent off in a World Cup quarter-final between England and Portugal, and delivered a nod to the cameras. Incredibly, the two brushed the incident under the carpet when they returned for Man Utd. Two years prior to that moment, Rooney would find himself on the front pages of the papers after admitting having sex with prostitutes after he was caught on CCTV visiting a backstreet brothel.
