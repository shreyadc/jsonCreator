The 24-year-old, who was part of Australia's World Cup squad this year, has most recently being playing in Mexico with Liga MX side Tigres UANL. She was on loan from her American parent club Racing Louisville in the NWSL where she made 26 appearances for the side over two seasons. While she was part of the Matildas' recent Olympic qualifiers, she was left out of their two-match series against Canada last month. Chidiac is the current Julie Dolan Medallist, winning Victory's highest individual honour in her second season. Victory coach Jeff Hopkins said he was thrilled to have Chidiac back for an extended period, with his team currently fourth on the ladder. \"We're incredibly pleased to have Alex back with us for the remainder of the campaign but even more exciting is that she will be with the squad for a further two seasons,\" Hopkins said in a statement Saturday. \"Alex has shown that she is one of the elite midfielders in this country and she's an invaluable asset to our side both on and off the park. \"At 24, her experience domestically and internationally is vast and over her time at Victory, she has been a leader with her actions, leading by example in everything she does and we're looking forward to what she can produce over an extended period at the club.\" Chidiac, who grew up in Adelaide, said she was also excited to be returning to Melbourne Victory on a permanent basis. \"Victory has become like a second home to me. Working with Jeff and the team brings out the best in me as a footballer and I'm looking forward to helping the team win more silverware over my time here,\" she said. Chidiac will be available for Saturday's match with Western Sydney Wanderers.

Curiously, the Baltimore Ravens quarterback remains a polarising figure, but has long been a master of proving people wrong. As a motivational strategy it is not unique. But if critics weren't respecting Jackson and the Ravens, they are now. At 12-3, Baltimore have the NFL's best record after their brutal 33-19 Christmas Day dismantling of San Francisco, who were previously hailed as the NFL's most complete team. The Ravens - who went into the game as 6.5-point underdogs - shattered that illusion with Jackson completing 23 of 35 passes for 252 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for a team-high 45 yards, including a trademark 30-yard scramble. 'I believe we've got a bunch of guys who've been doubted, a bunch of guys who've got things to prove — on our team — on both sides of the ball,' Jackson said on Wednesday. 'So, I believe, anytime we're the underdogs, we're going to always rise to the occasion. But we've got to stay locked in to do that.' Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are dreaming of Super Bowl glory this season A demolition job on the San Francisco 49ers has Jackson (right) leading the NFL's MVP race After five wins in a row, it does not get any easier. The Ravens can clinch a vital bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs with victory over the Miami Dolphins (11-4) on Sunday. But it helps that Jackson is in the form of his life and looks the complete player. While both Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen are dynamic improvisers, the ever elusive and utterly unpredictable Jackson leads all quarterbacks this season with 786 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns. Jackson is a joy to watch but a nightmare for opposing defences, such is his unerring ability to elude tackles, extend plays and make downfield throws. Yet he has become used to his unfair share of criticism. In 2016 he became the youngest-ever recipient of the Heisman Trophy — the annual award handed out to the outstanding player in college football — at Louisville. Two years later, he headed to Baltimore as the final pick of the first round in the 2018 NFL draft. 'They're gonna get a Super Bowl out of me. Believe that,' Jackson told Deion Sanders that night. Critics quickly leapt on Lamar, with some even saying he should switch to wide receiver. They haven't got off his back since. In his second year in the NFL, Jackson was unanimously voted the League's MVP as the Ravens romped to a 14-2 record, securing home-field advantage and a precious first-round bye. But it counted for little as the Ravens fell at the first hurdle, losing 28-12 against the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round. 'We just need to keep going, keep staying locked in and keep staying focused, because we know what it was in 2019 when we were playing against teams like this and winning regular season games,' Jackson (left) said after the win in San Francisco. 'When the time came, we didn't finish the season. We're just going to keep taking it a day at a time, a practice at a time and a game at a time. That's all I'm focused on right now.' It seems like a world away, but Jackson and the Ravens began the season at an impasse. In his first four years in the NFL, Jackson had the run heavy Greg Roman as offensive coordinator but with a lack of weapons at receiver, Baltimore had become one-dimensional. With Jackson injured down the stretch last year with a PCL injury, Baltimore's season ended with a playoff defeat in Cincinnati and backup Tyler Huntley at quarterback. In March, Jackson — who does not have an agent — demanded a trade. He was free to speak to and negotiate with any NFL team after the Ravens used the non-exclusive franchise tag, giving Baltimore the right to match any offer. But not one team confirmed an interest publicly. Jackson and the Ravens settled their differences in May, with the 26-year-old becoming the NFL's best paid player after signing a $260million, five-year deal, including $185m guaranteed. In the offseason, Baltimore worked on diversifying their offence. In came Todd Monken as offensive coordinator in February. Then Super Bowl winning wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr joined before wideout Zay Flowers was picked in the first round of April's draft. Jackson is a more complete player than in his MVP year and is on the cusp of setting a career-high in passing yards, throwing for 3,357 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Baltimore are a fearsome proposition. With the ball they can control the clock through a physical run game — which has overcome injuries to running backs JK Dobbins and Keaton Mitchell — and produce explosive plays with efficient passing. Without it, they boast a swarming defence of which franchise legends Ray Lewis and Ed Reed would be proud. Defensive tackle Justin Madubuike is enjoying a breakout season with 12 sacks, while veteran edge rushers Jadeveon Clowney and Kyle Van Noy — both late free agent pick ups — are enjoying a renaissance with the Ravens. Linebackers Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen organise the defence and smother ball carriers while heat seeking safety Kyle Hamilton (81 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, four interceptions, three sacks) is a lock in for All Pro honours in his second season. And in Justin Tucker, they boast the NFL's best kicker. With a 90.2 per cent conversion rate, Tucker is as close to a guaranteed field goal as there is. But at the centre of it all is Jackson, who has a 57-19 record in the regular season, but is 1-3 in the playoffs. 'He can do everything,' Flowers said this week. 'You saw it (Monday). He ran it; he threw it; he led the team. That's the MVP. 'You lead your team, you have the best record in the NFL, and he just comes out and continues to come out and do what he does game in and game out even though people say: 'He can't do this. He can't do that,' and he comes out and proves them wrong every time.' Ravens head coach John Harbaugh added: 'I thought Lamar had an MVP performance. It takes a team to create a performance like that, but it takes a player to play at that level — to play at an MVP level — it takes a player to play that way. 'And Lamar was all over the field doing everything.' Underdog or otherwise, Jackson is determined to keep his Super Bowl promise and is set on silencing any doubters once again.

Musim ini, Milan masih bersaing di papan atas Serie A, namun kesulitan menandingi konsistensi sang rival sekota Inter Milan. Saat Olivier Giroud dkk berada di urutan ketiga dengan 33 poin hingga pekan ke-17, Nerazzurri ada di puncak dengan keunggulan 11 poin. Lebih buruk lagi, Milan sudah terlempar ke Liga Europa usai hanya finis ketiga di penyisihan grup Liga Champions. Sementara Inter melenggang mulus ke babak 16 besar bersama dua wakil Italia lainnya, Lazio dan Napoli.

Namun pria yang membawa Milan meraih scudetto di musim 2021-22 itu merasa bisa membalikkan situasi. \"Saya tidak takut. Saya ingin tim mengekpresikan potensi terbaik mereka.

He was the first Ohio State receiver who was named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:59:24","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edc23aa/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2987x1680+0+156/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2F9d%2Fc654e8504540b7e22503da4bbbd4%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D21971144","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"21aa04e93f912d55aa6e1c7675e83f14","title":"Real Madrid 'set deadline for Kylian Mbappe decision'","link":"https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/transfer-talk/news/real-madrid-set-deadline-for-kylian-mbappe-decision_532424.html","keywords":["football","transfer talk","real madrid","la liga","paris saint-germain","ligue 1","al-hilal","saudi pro league","kylian mbappe","carlo ancelotti","luis enrique","532424"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Real Madrid reportedly give Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe a deadline to decide whether he wants to join the Spanish club next summer.","content":"The France international, who joined PSG from Monaco in 2018, has been linked with a move to Real Madrid for a number of years. The latest instalment of the transfer saga took place back in the summer when PSG put Mbappe up for sale, believing that he had already agreed to join Real Madrid on a free transfer in June 2024. Mbappe, who was left out of the pre-season tour of Japan and South Korea, was the subject of a world-record bid from Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal. However, Mbappe showed little interest in joining the Saudi Arabian side, and he was eventually reintegrated back into Luis Enrique's PSG squad. © Reuters While he intends to remain with the club for the duration of the 2023-24 campaign, his long-term future at the Parc des Princes is shrouded in uncertainty. With Mbappe set to enter the final six months of his contract, he will be free to negotiate with other clubs over a pre-contract agreement. According to The Athletic , Real Madrid are set to revive their interest in the 25-year-old, but they have given him a deadline to make a decision over his future. The report claims that Los Blancos want to know by the middle of January whether Mbappe intends to join them on a free transfer next summer. Real Madrid are determined to learn from the mistakes of the summer of 2022 when they thought they would sign the forward, only for him to agree a new contract with PSG. © Reuters While Carlo Ancelotti 's side are still looking to sign the Frenchman, the deal is likely to be different to the one they offered in 2022 due to the cost of the renovation work at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real Madrid are also mindful of controlling the wage bill, which could force Mbappe to compromise on his salary expectations if he wants to complete a move to the Spanish capital. Ancelotti, who has agreed to extend his deal until 2026, is keen to bring the 2018 World Cup winner to the club, but there is a feeling at PSG that their star player could decide to extend his contract with the club. The reigning Ligue 1 champions do not feel that Real Madrid will be able to offer the financial package that Mbappe is currently looking for. Although a question mark hangs over his PSG future, Mbappe has continued to play a leading role on the pitch, having scored 21 goals in his 22 competitive appearances this season.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:58:21","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/51/kylian-mbappe.jpg","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"00fcfb3134550c2103d17db940724fa1","title":"This College Football Playoff thing is old hat for Texas WR Adonai Mitchell","link":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/this-college-football-playoff-thing-is-old-hat-for-texas-wr-adonai-mitchell/article_1fe7811f-6580-5a9d-bb7f-e9239e7277a1.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Brett Martel The Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — For Texas receiver Adonai Mitchell, there's no mystery surrounding the College Football Playoff.","content":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — For Texas receiver Adonai Mitchell, there's no mystery surrounding the College Football Playoff. Monday's semifinal matchup between third-seeded Texas (12-1) and second-seeded Washington (13-0) in the Sugar Bowl will be the fifth CFP game of Mitchell's college career. And the transfer from Georgia likes to think his experience winning two national titles with the Bulldogs will benefit a Longhorns program that hasn't entered the postseason with a shot at a national title since the 2009 season. “Confidence is always a good thing. It's good energy that people can feed off of, good energy that's contagious,” Mitchell, who has touchdown catches in all four of his previous CFP games, said on Friday. “That's just exactly what you need ... ,\" he continued. \"You get three weeks to prepare, the other team gets three weeks to prepare, so you can be caught off guard a lot. And just keeping your composure, keeping poised in the stadium, that's very crucial in games like these.” The 6-foot-4 Mitchell grew up in Texas, and although he was thriving at Georgia and could have been part of the Bulldogs' ultimately unsuccessful bid for a third straight national title, the opportunity to play closer to home — and his young daughter — was something he couldn't pass up. Taking his pass-catching skills to Texas turned out to be a fortuitous move for him and the Longhorns. “I thought when I came here I was a complete player,” Mitchell said. “I wasn’t. I had a lot to learn. I had a lot of experiences that I had to go through.” This season, he said, he refined his ability to manage all the work off the field that goes into excelling on it, from workouts and meetings to practice habits and execution. This season, he has caught 51 passes for 813 yards and 10 TDs. “Certainly, he’s played in big games and playoff games and championship games before,” Texas offensive coordinator Kyle Flood said. “He’s got a skill set that we were lacking before he got here. “He is the complementary receiver to X (Xavier Worthy) really that we needed to kind of make the field a little bit more open for both of those guys and for a guy like JT (Ja’Tavion Sanders),” Flood continued. \"His role in what we do in the game plan is critical. I think he’s got an air of confidence about him that I think is good for everybody.” And it's fair to say Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers won't hesitate to trust Mitchell in clutch moments. “He definitely understands the magnitude of it. There’s not a whole lot more guys to trust than him,\" Ewers said. ”He’s been here and he’s done that. Definitely going to lean on him.” The relaxing of NCAA transfer rules in recent years and next year's expansion of the playoff to 12 teams might make it more common for players to make multiple CFP runs with different teams. But Washington cornerback Jabbar Muhammad figures it'll remain rare. “In our reality, every situation doesn't end up like his,” Muhammad said. “He done lucked up. He came to a winning program and now he's in the semifinals again. So, kudos to him.” Mitchell, meanwhile, sounds humbled by the way fate landed him in these huge games three years running. “It was great teams that I’ve been fortunate to be able to play on,\" Mitchell said. “It was great leadership and just being able to lean on guys and knowing that you’re not alone while you’re doing this.” Mitchell was a freshman when he hauled in a 40-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter of the game against Alabama that gave Georgia the lead and the first of consecutive titles. He missed most of 2022 with an ankle injury, but was a Georgia hero again when he returned in time for the postseason and caught the last-minute against Ohio State in the semifinal. Of his seven TDs at Georgia, four came in the playoff. Mitchell’s on social media included a photo himself with his daughter, Icylinn, in his lap. She was holding a football. Both were dressed in Longhorns gear. Because his daughter has been raised by his grandparents while he’s been in college, returning to Texas paid immediate personal dividends. Now it's led him back to another CFP game. Maybe two. “Definitely exciting. Definitely fun,\" Mitchell said. “It's three 15-game seasons (if Texas beats Washington), but it's all worth it.” ___ AP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, contributed. ___ AP college football: and","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:58:16","image_url":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/a5/6a52e759-1c86-5dab-b73a-b26c5cbe9709/658f5d9489197.image.jpg?resize=300%2C191","source_id":"thestar","source_priority":9555,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"09be23df80a8545d6cbc3e2e4be8e0b9","title":"Matildas midfielder Chidiac returns to Mebourne Victory","link":"https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/8472814/matildas-midfielder-chidiac-returns-to-mebourne-victory/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Matildas midfield ace Alex Chidiac has returned to the Melbourne Victory, signing a deal until the end of the 2025/26 A-League season.

Curiously, the Baltimore Ravens quarterback remains a polarising figure, but has long been a master of proving people wrong. As a motivational strategy it is not unique. But if critics weren't respecting Jackson and the Ravens, they are now. At 12-3, Baltimore have the NFL's best record after their brutal 33-19 Christmas Day dismantling of San Francisco, who were previously hailed as the NFL's most complete team. The Ravens - who went into the game as 6.5-point underdogs - shattered that illusion with Jackson completing 23 of 35 passes for 252 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for a team-high 45 yards, including a trademark 30-yard scramble. 'I believe we've got a bunch of guys who've been doubted, a bunch of guys who've got things to prove — on our team — on both sides of the ball,' Jackson said on Wednesday. 'So, I believe, anytime we're the underdogs, we're going to always rise to the occasion. But we've got to stay locked in to do that.' Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are dreaming of Super Bowl glory this season A demolition job on the San Francisco 49ers has Jackson (right) leading the NFL's MVP race After five wins in a row, it does not get any easier. The Ravens can clinch a vital bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs with victory over the Miami Dolphins (11-4) on Sunday. But it helps that Jackson is in the form of his life and looks the complete player. While both Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen are dynamic improvisers, the ever elusive and utterly unpredictable Jackson leads all quarterbacks this season with 786 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns. Jackson is a joy to watch but a nightmare for opposing defences, such is his unerring ability to elude tackles, extend plays and make downfield throws. Yet he has become used to his unfair share of criticism. In 2016 he became the youngest-ever recipient of the Heisman Trophy — the annual award handed out to the outstanding player in college football — at Louisville. Two years later, he headed to Baltimore as the final pick of the first round in the 2018 NFL draft. 'They're gonna get a Super Bowl out of me. Believe that,' Jackson told Deion Sanders that night. Critics quickly leapt on Lamar, with some even saying he should switch to wide receiver. They haven't got off his back since. In his second year in the NFL, Jackson was unanimously voted the League's MVP as the Ravens romped to a 14-2 record, securing home-field advantage and a precious first-round bye. But it counted for little as the Ravens fell at the first hurdle, losing 28-12 against the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round. 'We just need to keep going, keep staying locked in and keep staying focused, because we know what it was in 2019 when we were playing against teams like this and winning regular season games,' Jackson (left) said after the win in San Francisco. 'When the time came, we didn't finish the season. We're just going to keep taking it a day at a time, a practice at a time and a game at a time. That's all I'm focused on right now.' It seems like a world away, but Jackson and the Ravens began the season at an impasse. In his first four years in the NFL, Jackson had the run heavy Greg Roman as offensive coordinator but with a lack of weapons at receiver, Baltimore had become one-dimensional. With Jackson injured down the stretch last year with a PCL injury, Baltimore's season ended with a playoff defeat in Cincinnati and backup Tyler Huntley at quarterback. In March, Jackson — who does not have an agent — demanded a trade. He was free to speak to and negotiate with any NFL team after the Ravens used the non-exclusive franchise tag, giving Baltimore the right to match any offer. But not one team confirmed an interest publicly. Jackson and the Ravens settled their differences in May, with the 26-year-old becoming the NFL's best paid player after signing a $260million, five-year deal, including $185m guaranteed. In the offseason, Baltimore worked on diversifying their offence. In came Todd Monken as offensive coordinator in February. Then Super Bowl winning wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr joined before wideout Zay Flowers was picked in the first round of April's draft. Jackson is a more complete player than in his MVP year and is on the cusp of setting a career-high in passing yards, throwing for 3,357 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Baltimore are a fearsome proposition. With the ball they can control the clock through a physical run game — which has overcome injuries to running backs JK Dobbins and Keaton Mitchell — and produce explosive plays with efficient passing. Without it, they boast a swarming defence of which franchise legends Ray Lewis and Ed Reed would be proud. Defensive tackle Justin Madubuike is enjoying a breakout season with 12 sacks, while veteran edge rushers Jadeveon Clowney and Kyle Van Noy — both late free agent pick ups — are enjoying a renaissance with the Ravens. Linebackers Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen organise the defence and smother ball carriers while heat seeking safety Kyle Hamilton (81 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, four interceptions, three sacks) is a lock in for All Pro honours in his second season. And in Justin Tucker, they boast the NFL's best kicker. With a 90.2 per cent conversion rate, Tucker is as close to a guaranteed field goal as there is. But at the centre of it all is Jackson, who has a 57-19 record in the regular season, but is 1-3 in the playoffs. 'He can do everything,' Flowers said this week. 'You saw it (Monday). He ran it; he threw it; he led the team. That's the MVP. 'You lead your team, you have the best record in the NFL, and he just comes out and continues to come out and do what he does game in and game out even though people say: 'He can't do this. He can't do that,' and he comes out and proves them wrong every time.' Ravens head coach John Harbaugh added: 'I thought Lamar had an MVP performance. It takes a team to create a performance like that, but it takes a player to play at that level — to play at an MVP level — it takes a player to play that way. 'And Lamar was all over the field doing everything.' Underdog or otherwise, Jackson is determined to keep his Super Bowl promise and is set on silencing any doubters once again.

Musim ini, Milan masih bersaing di papan atas Serie A, namun kesulitan menandingi konsistensi sang rival sekota Inter Milan. Saat Olivier Giroud dkk berada di urutan ketiga dengan 33 poin hingga pekan ke-17, Nerazzurri ada di puncak dengan keunggulan 11 poin. Lebih buruk lagi, Milan sudah terlempar ke Liga Europa usai hanya finis ketiga di penyisihan grup Liga Champions. Sementara Inter melenggang mulus ke babak 16 besar bersama dua wakil Italia lainnya, Lazio dan Napoli.

Situasi ini tak pelak menjadi tekanan tersendiri untuk Pioli. Suara-suara sumbang tentang pemecatan dirinya mulai muncul di pengujung 2023. Namun pria yang membawa Milan meraih scudetto di musim 2021-22 itu merasa bisa membalikkan situasi. \"Saya tidak takut. Saya ingin tim mengekpresikan potensi terbaik mereka.

The latest instalment of the transfer saga took place back in the summer when PSG put Mbappe up for sale, believing that he had already agreed to join Real Madrid on a free transfer in June 2024. Mbappe, who was left out of the pre-season tour of Japan and South Korea, was the subject of a world-record bid from Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal. However, Mbappe showed little interest in joining the Saudi Arabian side, and he was eventually reintegrated back into Luis Enrique's PSG squad. © Reuters While he intends to remain with the club for the duration of the 2023-24 campaign, his long-term future at the Parc des Princes is shrouded in uncertainty. With Mbappe set to enter the final six months of his contract, he will be free to negotiate with other clubs over a pre-contract agreement. According to The Athletic , Real Madrid are set to revive their interest in the 25-year-old, but they have given him a deadline to make a decision over his future. The report claims that Los Blancos want to know by the middle of January whether Mbappe intends to join them on a free transfer next summer. Real Madrid are determined to learn from the mistakes of the summer of 2022 when they thought they would sign the forward, only for him to agree a new contract with PSG. © Reuters While Carlo Ancelotti 's side are still looking to sign the Frenchman, the deal is likely to be different to the one they offered in 2022 due to the cost of the renovation work at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real Madrid are also mindful of controlling the wage bill, which could force Mbappe to compromise on his salary expectations if he wants to complete a move to the Spanish capital. Ancelotti, who has agreed to extend his deal until 2026, is keen to bring the 2018 World Cup winner to the club, but there is a feeling at PSG that their star player could decide to extend his contract with the club. The reigning Ligue 1 champions do not feel that Real Madrid will be able to offer the financial package that Mbappe is currently looking for. Although a question mark hangs over his PSG future, Mbappe has continued to play a leading role on the pitch, having scored 21 goals in his 22 competitive appearances this season.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:58:21","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/51/kylian-mbappe.jpg","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"00fcfb3134550c2103d17db940724fa1","title":"This College Football Playoff thing is old hat for Texas WR Adonai Mitchell","link":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/this-college-football-playoff-thing-is-old-hat-for-texas-wr-adonai-mitchell/article_1fe7811f-6580-5a9d-bb7f-e9239e7277a1.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Brett Martel The Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — For Texas receiver Adonai Mitchell, there's no mystery surrounding the College Football Playoff.","content":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — For Texas receiver Adonai Mitchell, there's no mystery surrounding the College Football Playoff. Monday's semifinal matchup between third-seeded Texas (12-1) and second-seeded Washington (13-0) in the Sugar Bowl will be the fifth CFP game of Mitchell's college career. And the transfer from Georgia likes to think his experience winning two national titles with the Bulldogs will benefit a Longhorns program that hasn't entered the postseason with a shot at a national title since the 2009 season. “Confidence is always a good thing. It's good energy that people can feed off of, good energy that's contagious,” Mitchell, who has touchdown catches in all four of his previous CFP games, said on Friday. “That's just exactly what you need ... ,\" he continued. \"You get three weeks to prepare, the other team gets three weeks to prepare, so you can be caught off guard a lot. And just keeping your composure, keeping poised in the stadium, that's very crucial in games like these.” The 6-foot-4 Mitchell grew up in Texas, and although he was thriving at Georgia and could have been part of the Bulldogs' ultimately unsuccessful bid for a third straight national title, the opportunity to play closer to home — and his young daughter — was something he couldn't pass up. Taking his pass-catching skills to Texas turned out to be a fortuitous move for him and the Longhorns. “I thought when I came here I was a complete player,” Mitchell said. “I wasn’t. I had a lot to learn. I had a lot of experiences that I had to go through.” This season, he said, he refined his ability to manage all the work off the field that goes into excelling on it, from workouts and meetings to practice habits and execution. This season, he has caught 51 passes for 813 yards and 10 TDs. “Certainly, he’s played in big games and playoff games and championship games before,” Texas offensive coordinator Kyle Flood said. “He’s got a skill set that we were lacking before he got here. “He is the complementary receiver to X (Xavier Worthy) really that we needed to kind of make the field a little bit more open for both of those guys and for a guy like JT (Ja’Tavion Sanders),” Flood continued. \"His role in what we do in the game plan is critical. I think he’s got an air of confidence about him that I think is good for everybody.” And it's fair to say Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers won't hesitate to trust Mitchell in clutch moments. “He definitely understands the magnitude of it. There’s not a whole lot more guys to trust than him,\" Ewers said. ”He’s been here and he’s done that. Definitely going to lean on him.” The relaxing of NCAA transfer rules in recent years and next year's expansion of the playoff to 12 teams might make it more common for players to make multiple CFP runs with different teams. But Washington cornerback Jabbar Muhammad figures it'll remain rare. “In our reality, every situation doesn't end up like his,” Muhammad said. “He done lucked up. He came to a winning program and now he's in the semifinals again. So, kudos to him.” Mitchell, meanwhile, sounds humbled by the way fate landed him in these huge games three years running. “It was great teams that I’ve been fortunate to be able to play on,\" Mitchell said. “It was great leadership and just being able to lean on guys and knowing that you’re not alone while you’re doing this.” Mitchell was a freshman when he hauled in a 40-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter of the game against Alabama that gave Georgia the lead and the first of consecutive titles. He missed most of 2022 with an ankle injury, but was a Georgia hero again when he returned in time for the postseason and caught the last-minute against Ohio State in the semifinal. Of his seven TDs at Georgia, four came in the playoff. Mitchell’s on social media included a photo himself with his daughter, Icylinn, in his lap. She was holding a football. Both were dressed in Longhorns gear. Because his daughter has been raised by his grandparents while he’s been in college, returning to Texas paid immediate personal dividends. Now it's led him back to another CFP game. Maybe two. “Definitely exciting. Definitely fun,\" Mitchell said. “It's three 15-game seasons (if Texas beats Washington), but it's all worth it.” ___ AP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, contributed. ___ AP college football: and","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:58:16","image_url":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/a5/6a52e759-1c86-5dab-b73a-b26c5cbe9709/658f5d9489197.image.jpg?resize=300%2C191","source_id":"thestar","source_priority":9555,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"09be23df80a8545d6cbc3e2e4be8e0b9","title":"Matildas midfielder Chidiac returns to Mebourne Victory","link":"https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/8472814/matildas-midfielder-chidiac-returns-to-mebourne-victory/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Matildas midfield ace Alex Chidiac has returned to the Melbourne Victory, signing a deal until the end of the 2025/26 A-League season.

Curiously, the Baltimore Ravens quarterback remains a polarising figure, but has long been a master of proving people wrong. As a motivational strategy it is not unique. But if critics weren't respecting Jackson and the Ravens, they are now. At 12-3, Baltimore have the NFL's best record after their brutal 33-19 Christmas Day dismantling of San Francisco, who were previously hailed as the NFL's most complete team. The Ravens - who went into the game as 6.5-point underdogs - shattered that illusion with Jackson completing 23 of 35 passes for 252 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for a team-high 45 yards, including a trademark 30-yard scramble. 'I believe we've got a bunch of guys who've been doubted, a bunch of guys who've got things to prove — on our team — on both sides of the ball,' Jackson said on Wednesday. 'So, I believe, anytime we're the underdogs, we're going to always rise to the occasion. But we've got to stay locked in to do that.' Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens are dreaming of Super Bowl glory this season A demolition job on the San Francisco 49ers has Jackson (right) leading the NFL's MVP race After five wins in a row, it does not get any easier. The Ravens can clinch a vital bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs with victory over the Miami Dolphins (11-4) on Sunday. But it helps that Jackson is in the form of his life and looks the complete player. While both Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen are dynamic improvisers, the ever elusive and utterly unpredictable Jackson leads all quarterbacks this season with 786 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns. Jackson is a joy to watch but a nightmare for opposing defences, such is his unerring ability to elude tackles, extend plays and make downfield throws. Yet he has become used to his unfair share of criticism. In 2016 he became the youngest-ever recipient of the Heisman Trophy — the annual award handed out to the outstanding player in college football — at Louisville. Two years later, he headed to Baltimore as the final pick of the first round in the 2018 NFL draft. 'They're gonna get a Super Bowl out of me. Believe that,' Jackson told Deion Sanders that night. Critics quickly leapt on Lamar, with some even saying he should switch to wide receiver. They haven't got off his back since. In his second year in the NFL, Jackson was unanimously voted the League's MVP as the Ravens romped to a 14-2 record, securing home-field advantage and a precious first-round bye. But it counted for little as the Ravens fell at the first hurdle, losing 28-12 against the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round. 'We just need to keep going, keep staying locked in and keep staying focused, because we know what it was in 2019 when we were playing against teams like this and winning regular season games,' Jackson (left) said after the win in San Francisco. 'When the time came, we didn't finish the season. We're just going to keep taking it a day at a time, a practice at a time and a game at a time. That's all I'm focused on right now.' It seems like a world away, but Jackson and the Ravens began the season at an impasse. In his first four years in the NFL, Jackson had the run heavy Greg Roman as offensive coordinator but with a lack of weapons at receiver, Baltimore had become one-dimensional. With Jackson injured down the stretch last year with a PCL injury, Baltimore's season ended with a playoff defeat in Cincinnati and backup Tyler Huntley at quarterback. In March, Jackson — who does not have an agent — demanded a trade. He was free to speak to and negotiate with any NFL team after the Ravens used the non-exclusive franchise tag, giving Baltimore the right to match any offer. But not one team confirmed an interest publicly. Jackson and the Ravens settled their differences in May, with the 26-year-old becoming the NFL's best paid player after signing a $260million, five-year deal, including $185m guaranteed. In the offseason, Baltimore worked on diversifying their offence. In came Todd Monken as offensive coordinator in February. Then Super Bowl winning wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr joined before wideout Zay Flowers was picked in the first round of April's draft. Jackson is a more complete player than in his MVP year and is on the cusp of setting a career-high in passing yards, throwing for 3,357 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Baltimore are a fearsome proposition. With the ball they can control the clock through a physical run game — which has overcome injuries to running backs JK Dobbins and Keaton Mitchell — and produce explosive plays with efficient passing. Without it, they boast a swarming defence of which franchise legends Ray Lewis and Ed Reed would be proud. Defensive tackle Justin Madubuike is enjoying a breakout season with 12 sacks, while veteran edge rushers Jadeveon Clowney and Kyle Van Noy — both late free agent pick ups — are enjoying a renaissance with the Ravens. Linebackers Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen organise the defence and smother ball carriers while heat seeking safety Kyle Hamilton (81 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, four interceptions, three sacks) is a lock in for All Pro honours in his second season. And in Justin Tucker, they boast the NFL's best kicker. With a 90.2 per cent conversion rate, Tucker is as close to a guaranteed field goal as there is. But at the centre of it all is Jackson, who has a 57-19 record in the regular season, but is 1-3 in the playoffs. 'He can do everything,' Flowers said this week. 'You saw it (Monday). He ran it; he threw it; he led the team. That's the MVP. 'You lead your team, you have the best record in the NFL, and he just comes out and continues to come out and do what he does game in and game out even though people say: 'He can't do this. He can't do that,' and he comes out and proves them wrong every time.' Ravens head coach John Harbaugh added: 'I thought Lamar had an MVP performance. It takes a team to create a performance like that, but it takes a player to play at that level — to play at an MVP level — it takes a player to play that way. 'And Lamar was all over the field doing everything.' Underdog or otherwise, Jackson is determined to keep his Super Bowl promise and is set on silencing any doubters once again.

Musim ini, Milan masih bersaing di papan atas Serie A, namun kesulitan menandingi konsistensi sang rival sekota Inter Milan. Saat Olivier Giroud dkk berada di urutan ketiga dengan 33 poin hingga pekan ke-17, Nerazzurri ada di puncak dengan keunggulan 11 poin. Lebih buruk lagi, Milan sudah terlempar ke Liga Europa usai hanya finis ketiga di penyisihan grup Liga Champions. Sementara Inter melenggang mulus ke babak 16 besar bersama dua wakil Italia lainnya, Lazio dan Napoli.

Situasi ini tak pelak menjadi tekanan tersendiri untuk Pioli. Suara-suara sumbang tentang pemecatan dirinya mulai muncul di pengujung 2023. Namun pria yang membawa Milan meraih scudetto di musim 2021-22 itu merasa bisa membalikkan situasi. \"Saya tidak takut. Saya ingin tim mengekpresikan potensi terbaik mereka. Kami harus memiliki daya jelajah yang lebih baik di lapangan, lebih rapat dalam hal kualitas dan waktu,\" ujar Pioli, dikutip Football Italia.

The latest instalment of the transfer saga took place back in the summer when PSG put Mbappe up for sale, believing that he had already agreed to join Real Madrid on a free transfer in June 2024. Mbappe, who was left out of the pre-season tour of Japan and South Korea, was the subject of a world-record bid from Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal. However, Mbappe showed little interest in joining the Saudi Arabian side, and he was eventually reintegrated back into Luis Enrique's PSG squad. © Reuters While he intends to remain with the club for the duration of the 2023-24 campaign, his long-term future at the Parc des Princes is shrouded in uncertainty. With Mbappe set to enter the final six months of his contract, he will be free to negotiate with other clubs over a pre-contract agreement. According to The Athletic , Real Madrid are set to revive their interest in the 25-year-old, but they have given him a deadline to make a decision over his future. The report claims that Los Blancos want to know by the middle of January whether Mbappe intends to join them on a free transfer next summer. Real Madrid are determined to learn from the mistakes of the summer of 2022 when they thought they would sign the forward, only for him to agree a new contract with PSG. © Reuters While Carlo Ancelotti 's side are still looking to sign the Frenchman, the deal is likely to be different to the one they offered in 2022 due to the cost of the renovation work at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real Madrid are also mindful of controlling the wage bill, which could force Mbappe to compromise on his salary expectations if he wants to complete a move to the Spanish capital. Ancelotti, who has agreed to extend his deal until 2026, is keen to bring the 2018 World Cup winner to the club, but there is a feeling at PSG that their star player could decide to extend his contract with the club. The reigning Ligue 1 champions do not feel that Real Madrid will be able to offer the financial package that Mbappe is currently looking for. Although a question mark hangs over his PSG future, Mbappe has continued to play a leading role on the pitch, having scored 21 goals in his 22 competitive appearances this season.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:58:21","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/51/kylian-mbappe.jpg","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"00fcfb3134550c2103d17db940724fa1","title":"This College Football Playoff thing is old hat for Texas WR Adonai Mitchell","link":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/this-college-football-playoff-thing-is-old-hat-for-texas-wr-adonai-mitchell/article_1fe7811f-6580-5a9d-bb7f-e9239e7277a1.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Brett Martel The Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — For Texas receiver Adonai Mitchell, there's no mystery surrounding the College Football Playoff.","content":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — For Texas receiver Adonai Mitchell, there's no mystery surrounding the College Football Playoff. Monday's semifinal matchup between third-seeded Texas (12-1) and second-seeded Washington (13-0) in the Sugar Bowl will be the fifth CFP game of Mitchell's college career. And the transfer from Georgia likes to think his experience winning two national titles with the Bulldogs will benefit a Longhorns program that hasn't entered the postseason with a shot at a national title since the 2009 season. “Confidence is always a good thing. It's good energy that people can feed off of, good energy that's contagious,” Mitchell, who has touchdown catches in all four of his previous CFP games, said on Friday. “That's just exactly what you need ... ,\" he continued. \"You get three weeks to prepare, the other team gets three weeks to prepare, so you can be caught off guard a lot. And just keeping your composure, keeping poised in the stadium, that's very crucial in games like these.” The 6-foot-4 Mitchell grew up in Texas, and although he was thriving at Georgia and could have been part of the Bulldogs' ultimately unsuccessful bid for a third straight national title, the opportunity to play closer to home — and his young daughter — was something he couldn't pass up. Taking his pass-catching skills to Texas turned out to be a fortuitous move for him and the Longhorns. “I thought when I came here I was a complete player,” Mitchell said. “I wasn’t. I had a lot to learn. I had a lot of experiences that I had to go through.” This season, he said, he refined his ability to manage all the work off the field that goes into excelling on it, from workouts and meetings to practice habits and execution. This season, he has caught 51 passes for 813 yards and 10 TDs. “Certainly, he’s played in big games and playoff games and championship games before,” Texas offensive coordinator Kyle Flood said. “He’s got a skill set that we were lacking before he got here. “He is the complementary receiver to X (Xavier Worthy) really that we needed to kind of make the field a little bit more open for both of those guys and for a guy like JT (Ja’Tavion Sanders),” Flood continued. \"His role in what we do in the game plan is critical. I think he’s got an air of confidence about him that I think is good for everybody.” And it's fair to say Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers won't hesitate to trust Mitchell in clutch moments. “He definitely understands the magnitude of it. There’s not a whole lot more guys to trust than him,\" Ewers said. ”He’s been here and he’s done that. Definitely going to lean on him.” The relaxing of NCAA transfer rules in recent years and next year's expansion of the playoff to 12 teams might make it more common for players to make multiple CFP runs with different teams. But Washington cornerback Jabbar Muhammad figures it'll remain rare. “In our reality, every situation doesn't end up like his,” Muhammad said. “He done lucked up. He came to a winning program and now he's in the semifinals again. So, kudos to him.” Mitchell, meanwhile, sounds humbled by the way fate landed him in these huge games three years running. “It was great teams that I’ve been fortunate to be able to play on,\" Mitchell said. “It was great leadership and just being able to lean on guys and knowing that you’re not alone while you’re doing this.” Mitchell was a freshman when he hauled in a 40-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter of the game against Alabama that gave Georgia the lead and the first of consecutive titles. He missed most of 2022 with an ankle injury, but was a Georgia hero again when he returned in time for the postseason and caught the last-minute against Ohio State in the semifinal. Of his seven TDs at Georgia, four came in the playoff. Mitchell’s on social media included a photo himself with his daughter, Icylinn, in his lap. She was holding a football. Both were dressed in Longhorns gear. Because his daughter has been raised by his grandparents while he’s been in college, returning to Texas paid immediate personal dividends. Now it's led him back to another CFP game. Maybe two. “Definitely exciting. Definitely fun,\" Mitchell said. “It's three 15-game seasons (if Texas beats Washington), but it's all worth it.” ___ AP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, contributed. ___ AP college football: and","pubDate":"2023-12-29 23:58:16","image_url":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/a5/6a52e759-1c86-5dab-b73a-b26c5cbe9709/658f5d9489197.image.jpg?resize=300%2C191","source_id":"thestar","source_priority":9555,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"}]}
