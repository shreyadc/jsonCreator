Back in 1996, Shearer was hot property in the Premier League following a deadly scoring streak of 112 goals in 138 Premier League games for Blackburn Rovers. After helping them win the title in 1994/95, Shearer was on the move in the summer of 1996, with United, Arsenal and Real Madrid among the interested clubs. Ultimately, though, Shearer ended up joining his boyhood club Newcastle in a world-record £15million transfer. It was a dream move for the Tyneside-born striker, but it left Ferguson furious, after he thought he’d agreed a deal for his services. Harry Maguire makes plan for EFL Cup trophy lift that sums up dropped Man Utd skipper Wayne Rooney says Erik ten Hag has changed three Man Utd factors after training ground visit Having turned down United back in 1992, when he moved from Southampton to Blackburn, Shearer held talks with the club again four years later. He and his agent Tony Stephens met Ferguson and all appeared to go well. “He wanted to know if he would be able to take the penalty kicks and if he could wear the number nine shirt,” Ferguson wrote in In A Will to Win, his diary of the 1996/97 season. “I tell him that Eric Cantona hasn’t missed a penalty for us since he arrived but that if he ever did, then, possibly. As for the number nine shirt, no problem. I thought that if we were the only things worrying him, we would get our man.” Alex Ferguson wanted Alan Shearer to join Manchester United ( Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images) Stephens was supposed to call Ferguson back three days later to inform him of Shearer’s decision, but the call never came. Shearer had spoken to Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan and was won over by his sales pitch – and the move set up an awkward meeting with United soon after in the Charity Shield at Wembley. United won 4-0 and, after the match, Ferguson admitted that he was “‘sick and angry” about missing out on Shearer. “History will prove whether he was right to pick Newcastle ahead of us,” Ferguson wrote. “And I do feel that there’s often a sting in the tail when you sign someone for that kind of money. “Afterwards, my players tell me that there is already muttering in the Newcastle team about some of them looking for new contracts. It’s very difficult keeping some kind of pay parity in a club, especially in these days of agents.” Alan Shearer never regretted joining Newcastle ( Image: Shaun Botterill/Allsport/Getty Images) Ferguson placed most of the blame on the failed move down to Blackburn owner Jack Walker, who was not keen on his most prized asset joining a rival. A move to Newcastle represented a better fit for the selling club – and, as it happens, Shearer himself, who continued to bang in goals for the Magpies. The man himself certainly didn’t regret his choice. “At one point, I was going to Manchester United,” Shearer told the BBC years later. “But then, I sat down and I got a call from Kevin who asked to see me a day or two later. And I thought, ‘You know what, I’m going to go back to Newcastle. It was the club I always supported and wanted to play for. “I rang him but there was no answer, I thought I couldn’t leave a message. I rang him again but there was still no answer. So, I left him a message after the third time and, no surprise, I never got a call back. I’ve got no regrets, I’d do the same again.”","pubDate":"2023-02-26 10:54:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29315912.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_Untitled-1.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Messi tipped for FIFA Best award","link":"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/messi-tipped-for-fifa-best-award-26-february-2023/","keywords":["Soccer","Sport"],"creator":["Wade Pretorius"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi is widely favoured to win the FIFA Best award on Monday with Kylian Mbappe and Karim Benzema also nominated.","content":"Lionel Messi is widely favoured to win the FIFA Best award on Monday with Kylian Mbappe and Karim Benzema also nominated.

The Brazilian centre-back, 25, was rock solid as the Gunners earned a 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium thanks to compatriot and namesake Martinelli 's second-half strike. Gabriel helped Arsenal limit Leicester to a mere 0.2 expected goals in a dominant defensive display, but he also had to battle with his own team-mates as Mikel Arteta 's side held on to top spot in the Premier League . While left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko was touchingly handed the captain's armband by Arteta to mark the anniversary of Russia 's invasion of his homeland, Ukraine , Gabriel still showed great leadership. The 25-year-old, who's enjoying his third season with the Gunners and signed a long-term contract extension in October , made sure to keep the much more experienced Jorginho in check when he made an error during Saturday's hard-fought victory. Arsenal referee accused of \"phenomenal mistake\" after Bukayo Saka denied penalty Arsenal winners and losers as Mikel Arteta unveils new tactical plan vs Leicester As the Italian midfielder, 31, attempted and failed to pass the ball back with his shoulder, Gabriel unleashed a brief tirade by yelling at him to use his chest. It was a wake-up call for Jorginho, who was playing his third successive 90 minutes after signing in January. Gabriel wasn't done ensuring that his team were doing everything they can to become champions when the final whistle went, though, as he was involved in a heated exchanged with centre-back partner William Saliba which turned physical. It was reported by the Athletic that as Arsenal's players walked off the pitch after full-time, Saliba shoved Gabriel away at the end of a stern discussion. It's unclear what was said between the two players but manager Arteta only had praise for the duo post-match. \"I think defensively we were incredible because restricting Leicester to one shot on target in the whole game at home is a difficult thing to do,\" the Gunners boss beamed after his side's second away win on the bounce. \"The players did really well.\" Gabriel Magalhaes yelled at team-mate Jorginho ( Image: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) William Saliba later exchanged words with Gabriel ( Image: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) Have your say! Will Arsenal win the Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section . Arteta added on their impressive away form: \"It's really important obviously, it creates more belief, more belief in the players, more belief around our club, and externally, I had full faith the players could do it, it was coming back to some basics and some details that can get games away from us, we made it much more than what we got. \"In the last two games, especially today, we've done those things much better. Set plays, sloppy goals, and individual errors, it's part of football sometimes you are going to concede in games but the fact we are not conceding and giving chances away is really important if you want to be constantly winning matches.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-26 10:42:48","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29315758.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-1.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Евертон - Астон Вілла 0:2: огляд матчу АПЛ ВІДЕО","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/02/26/923306/everton-aston-villa-02-ohlyad-matchu-apl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Евертон поступився Астон Віллі в межах 25-го туру АПЛ.Українець Віталій Миколенко провів на полі увесь матч.Чемпіонат Англії - АПЛ25 тур, 25 лютогоЕвертон - Астон Вілла 0:2 (0:0)Голи:0:1 - 63 Воткінс (пен), 0:2 - 81 Буендія...","content":"#Чемпіонат Англії, АПЛ , #Астон Вілла , #Евертон , #Віталій Миколенко Джерело - Чемпіон .

Although Maguire is officially United captain, he has lost his starting place, with Bruno Fernandes wearing the armband when the England defender is not playing. Fernandes is set to captain United in today’s final, with Maguire among the substitutes as boss Erik ten Hag bids to win his first trophy in his debut season in charge. But Maguire is understood to have planned to lift the trophy jointly with Fernandes if United win - to honour the fact the Portuguese star has captained the team more than him this season and featured more in the run to the final. Qatar tell PSG to 'aggressively' slash wage bill amid Man Utd takeover speculation Casemiro shows feeling is mutual towards Man Utd teammate with 'best player' remark Fernandes has started all five of United’s games in the Carabao Cup en route to the final, while Maguire has started just two and came on as a late substitute in the 2-0 semi-final second-leg win over Nottingham Forest. United are bidding to end a six-year wait for a trophy, their worst run without silverware for four decades, by beating Eddie Howe’s side today. The last trophy United won was the 2017 Europa League under former boss Jose Mourinho . They reached the 2018 FA Cup final under Mourinho, but lost to Chelsea , and were beaten in a penalty shootout by Villarreal in the 2021 Europa League final, under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . \"As you have seen, we take every game serious. We take every [competition] serious so now we have progress to a final and it’s great to play in a final. But if you play, you want to win,\" Ten Hag said in his pre-match press conference. Harry Maguire is set to be on the bench for Man Utd vs Newcastle at Wembley “It's a great opportunity to get the silverware in and it's all about that. I think it's about glory and honour in football. We deserved to play the final and now we have a great opportunity to win the cup so we have to put everything in to get that cup to Manchester.” Asked if this could start a sustained period of success under his stewardship, he added: \"Yeah, but focus on [the next game]. That is the only thing that we can do at this moment [win the Carabao Cup]. After it, we will look further on what it means. \"Either we win them and that's good, that can have the impact you mentioned, but if you don't win them [we will have] more opportunities and we have to carry on the process because we are still in a good direction.

He and his agent Tony Stephens met Ferguson and all appeared to go well. “He wanted to know if he would be able to take the penalty kicks and if he could wear the number nine shirt,” Ferguson wrote in In A Will to Win, his diary of the 1996/97 season. “I tell him that Eric Cantona hasn’t missed a penalty for us since he arrived but that if he ever did, then, possibly.

Shearer had spoken to Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan and was won over by his sales pitch – and the move set up an awkward meeting with United soon after in the Charity Shield at Wembley. United won 4-0 and, after the match, Ferguson admitted that he was “‘sick and angry” about missing out on Shearer. “History will prove whether he was right to pick Newcastle ahead of us,” Ferguson wrote. “And I do feel that there’s often a sting in the tail when you sign someone for that kind of money. “Afterwards, my players tell me that there is already muttering in the Newcastle team about some of them looking for new contracts.

The man himself certainly didn’t regret his choice. “At one point, I was going to Manchester United,” Shearer told the BBC years later. “But then, I sat down and I got a call from Kevin who asked to see me a day or two later.

The Brazilian centre-back, 25, was rock solid as the Gunners earned a 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium thanks to compatriot and namesake Martinelli 's second-half strike. Gabriel helped Arsenal limit Leicester to a mere 0.2 expected goals in a dominant defensive display, but he also had to battle with his own team-mates as Mikel Arteta 's side held on to top spot in the Premier League . While left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko was touchingly handed the captain's armband by Arteta to mark the anniversary of Russia 's invasion of his homeland, Ukraine , Gabriel still showed great leadership. The 25-year-old, who's enjoying his third season with the Gunners and signed a long-term contract extension in October , made sure to keep the much more experienced Jorginho in check when he made an error during Saturday's hard-fought victory. Arsenal referee accused of \"phenomenal mistake\" after Bukayo Saka denied penalty Arsenal winners and losers as Mikel Arteta unveils new tactical plan vs Leicester As the Italian midfielder, 31, attempted and failed to pass the ball back with his shoulder, Gabriel unleashed a brief tirade by yelling at him to use his chest. It was a wake-up call for Jorginho, who was playing his third successive 90 minutes after signing in January. Gabriel wasn't done ensuring that his team were doing everything they can to become champions when the final whistle went, though, as he was involved in a heated exchanged with centre-back partner William Saliba which turned physical. It was reported by the Athletic that as Arsenal's players walked off the pitch after full-time, Saliba shoved Gabriel away at the end of a stern discussion. It's unclear what was said between the two players but manager Arteta only had praise for the duo post-match. \"I think defensively we were incredible because restricting Leicester to one shot on target in the whole game at home is a difficult thing to do,\" the Gunners boss beamed after his side's second away win on the bounce. \"The players did really well.\" Gabriel Magalhaes yelled at team-mate Jorginho ( Image: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) William Saliba later exchanged words with Gabriel ( Image: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) Have your say! Will Arsenal win the Premier League title? Give us your prediction in the comments section . Arteta added on their impressive away form: \"It's really important obviously, it creates more belief, more belief in the players, more belief around our club, and externally, I had full faith the players could do it, it was coming back to some basics and some details that can get games away from us, we made it much more than what we got. \"In the last two games, especially today, we've done those things much better.

Although Maguire is officially United captain, he has lost his starting place, with Bruno Fernandes wearing the armband when the England defender is not playing. Fernandes is set to captain United in today’s final, with Maguire among the substitutes as boss Erik ten Hag bids to win his first trophy in his debut season in charge. But Maguire is understood to have planned to lift the trophy jointly with Fernandes if United win - to honour the fact the Portuguese star has captained the team more than him this season and featured more in the run to the final. Qatar tell PSG to 'aggressively' slash wage bill amid Man Utd takeover speculation Casemiro shows feeling is mutual towards Man Utd teammate with 'best player' remark Fernandes has started all five of United’s games in the Carabao Cup en route to the final, while Maguire has started just two and came on as a late substitute in the 2-0 semi-final second-leg win over Nottingham Forest. United are bidding to end a six-year wait for a trophy, their worst run without silverware for four decades, by beating Eddie Howe’s side today. The last trophy United won was the 2017 Europa League under former boss Jose Mourinho . They reached the 2018 FA Cup final under Mourinho, but lost to Chelsea , and were beaten in a penalty shootout by Villarreal in the 2021 Europa League final, under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . \"As you have seen, we take every game serious. We take every [competition] serious so now we have progress to a final and it’s great to play in a final. But if you play, you want to win,\" Ten Hag said in his pre-match press conference. Harry Maguire is set to be on the bench for Man Utd vs Newcastle at Wembley “It's a great opportunity to get the silverware in and it's all about that. I think it's about glory and honour in football. We deserved to play the final and now we have a great opportunity to win the cup so we have to put everything in to get that cup to Manchester.” Asked if this could start a sustained period of success under his stewardship, he added: \"Yeah, but focus on [the next game]. That is the only thing that we can do at this moment [win the Carabao Cup]. After it, we will look further on what it means. \"Either we win them and that's good, that can have the impact you mentioned, but if you don't win them [we will have] more opportunities and we have to carry on the process because we are still in a good direction. We can't be dependent on one game.

While left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko was touchingly handed the captain's armband by Arteta to mark the anniversary of Russia 's invasion of his homeland, Ukraine , Gabriel still showed great leadership. The 25-year-old, who's enjoying his third season with the Gunners and signed a long-term contract extension in October , made sure to keep the much more experienced Jorginho in check when he made an error during Saturday's hard-fought victory. Arsenal referee accused of \"phenomenal mistake\" after Bukayo Saka denied penalty Arsenal winners and losers as Mikel Arteta unveils new tactical plan vs Leicester As the Italian midfielder, 31, attempted and failed to pass the ball back with his shoulder, Gabriel unleashed a brief tirade by yelling at him to use his chest. It was a wake-up call for Jorginho, who was playing his third successive 90 minutes after signing in January. Gabriel wasn't done ensuring that his team were doing everything they can to become champions when the final whistle went, though, as he was involved in a heated exchanged with centre-back partner William Saliba which turned physical. It was reported by the Athletic that as Arsenal's players walked off the pitch after full-time, Saliba shoved Gabriel away at the end of a stern discussion. It's unclear what was said between the two players but manager Arteta only had praise for the duo post-match. \"I think defensively we were incredible because restricting Leicester to one shot on target in the whole game at home is a difficult thing to do,\" the Gunners boss beamed after his side's second away win on the bounce. \"The players did really well.\" Gabriel Magalhaes yelled at team-mate Jorginho ( Image: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) William Saliba later exchanged words with Gabriel ( Image: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) Have your say!

Arteta added on their impressive away form: \"It's really important obviously, it creates more belief, more belief in the players, more belief around our club, and externally, I had full faith the players could do it, it was coming back to some basics and some details that can get games away from us, we made it much more than what we got. \"In the last two games, especially today, we've done those things much better. Set plays, sloppy goals, and individual errors, it's part of football sometimes you are going to concede in games but the fact we are not conceding and giving chances away is really important if you want to be constantly winning matches.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-26 10:42:48","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29315758.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-1.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Евертон - Астон Вілла 0:2: огляд матчу АПЛ ВІДЕО","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/02/26/923306/everton-aston-villa-02-ohlyad-matchu-apl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Евертон поступився Астон Віллі в межах 25-го туру АПЛ.Українець Віталій Миколенко провів на полі увесь матч.Чемпіонат Англії - АПЛ25 тур, 25 лютогоЕвертон - Астон Вілла 0:2 (0:0)Голи:0:1 - 63 Воткінс (пен), 0:2 - 81 Буендія...","content":"#Чемпіонат Англії, АПЛ , #Астон Вілла , #Евертон , #Віталій Миколенко Джерело - Чемпіон .

Although Maguire is officially United captain, he has lost his starting place, with Bruno Fernandes wearing the armband when the England defender is not playing. Fernandes is set to captain United in today’s final, with Maguire among the substitutes as boss Erik ten Hag bids to win his first trophy in his debut season in charge. But Maguire is understood to have planned to lift the trophy jointly with Fernandes if United win - to honour the fact the Portuguese star has captained the team more than him this season and featured more in the run to the final. Qatar tell PSG to 'aggressively' slash wage bill amid Man Utd takeover speculation Casemiro shows feeling is mutual towards Man Utd teammate with 'best player' remark Fernandes has started all five of United’s games in the Carabao Cup en route to the final, while Maguire has started just two and came on as a late substitute in the 2-0 semi-final second-leg win over Nottingham Forest. United are bidding to end a six-year wait for a trophy, their worst run without silverware for four decades, by beating Eddie Howe’s side today. The last trophy United won was the 2017 Europa League under former boss Jose Mourinho . They reached the 2018 FA Cup final under Mourinho, but lost to Chelsea , and were beaten in a penalty shootout by Villarreal in the 2021 Europa League final, under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . \"As you have seen, we take every game serious. We take every [competition] serious so now we have progress to a final and it’s great to play in a final. But if you play, you want to win,\" Ten Hag said in his pre-match press conference. Harry Maguire is set to be on the bench for Man Utd vs Newcastle at Wembley “It's a great opportunity to get the silverware in and it's all about that. I think it's about glory and honour in football. We deserved to play the final and now we have a great opportunity to win the cup so we have to put everything in to get that cup to Manchester.” Asked if this could start a sustained period of success under his stewardship, he added: \"Yeah, but focus on [the next game]. That is the only thing that we can do at this moment [win the Carabao Cup]. After it, we will look further on what it means. \"Either we win them and that's good, that can have the impact you mentioned, but if you don't win them [we will have] more opportunities and we have to carry on the process because we are still in a good direction. We can't be dependent on one game. But it's obvious we want to win the cup.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-26 10:21:53","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29315776.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1247191796.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Барселона зіграє з Альмерією: Розклад матчів Ла-Ліги","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/02/26/923304/zhyrona-tsyhankova-zustrinetsya-z-atletikom-barselona-zihraye-z-almeriyeyu-rozklad-matchiv-la-lihy","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Сьогодні, 26 лютого, відбудеться 4 матчі в межах 23-го туру іспанської Ла-Ліги.Чемпіонат Іспанії - Ла-Ліга23 тур, 26 лютого15:00 Атлетік - Жирона17:15 Сельта - Вальядолід19:30 Альмерія - Барселона22:00 Севілья - Осасуна...","content":"#Чемпіонат Іспанії, Ла Ліга Джерело - Чемпіон .
