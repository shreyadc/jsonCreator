Their coronation is still coming but the crown already sits on their thrones, unshaken and unmoved, with barely a threat on the horizon. Sundowns’ opponents on Tuesday night – three days after they officially retained their title again – Cape Town City gave them a guard of honour at Loftus. Bar Thapelo Morena, who was on the bench, head coach Rhulani Mokwena fielded arguably his strongest side but they could not overpower the Capetonians during the 0-0 draw. AS IT HAPPENED | Mamelodi Sundowns v Cape Town City They came here to entertain, to put to the sword, to parade their newly minted championship status but they could not find the goal that would garnish the DStv Premiership victory. But the draw didn’t take anything away from their superiority and consistency. In fact, their 18 shots to nine and 67% ball possession almost emphasised the point. Six league titles on the trot, 13 in the PSL era and the latest achieved in record time: with seven matches to spare and more than a month of the season remaining. In athletics terms, it’s Usain Bolt winning the Olympic 100m race three Games in a row and in a world record time. They are Michael Phelps dressed in Bayern Munich gear. Sundowns are still on course to break their most league points (71) by the end of the season, a record they achieved during the 2015/16 season. They could also obliterate their highest league-winning margin, 16, which they set last season. So far, they lead second-placed Pirates by a staggering 20 points. Downs’ first clear chance came in the 23rd minute when Neo Maema freed Cassius Mailula, who squared for their super striker Peter Shalulile. The forward nodded in but the linesman had the last say with his flag. Seven minutes later, City broke free and fashioned a counter-attacking opportunity, which ended with Darwin Gonzalez trying to curl one past an alert Ronwen Williams, who palmed it wide. Mailula had his own (legitimate) chance on 39 minutes after another in a series of late first-half attacking moves but the young attacker’s turn and shot ended up in a safe Darren Keet save. Teboho Mokoena came close with a free-kick that took a nick off a defender before he headed straight at Keet from the resultant corner. READ | Dominant Mamelodi Sundowns: Are they 'killing' the PSL or simply a class apart? Downs could smell the goal; it was just a matter of when they’d crack open the champagne. At half-time (0-0), the bubbly was on ice. But Sundowns’ high press was causing City problems all game and they almost profited just seconds after the break from it when Mailula won the ball in the City box but fed an off-side Shalulile. Sundowns weren’t allowing the Citizens time on the ball and to build from the back but the opposite was not true. The champions were comfortably bossing possession in all areas, leaving City little scraps off which to feed. Mailula came close again before the hour when he again twisted and turned City defenders but fizzed a low left-foot strike past a statuesque Keet and narrowly wide. City was then reduced to 10 men when Cameroonian Brice Ambina Fidèle was shown a second yellow card for an elbow on Aubrey Modiba’s face. The visitors needed some heroic Keet goalkeeping and Marc van Heerden defending as the two veterans prevented a flood of chances turning into a Downs winning goal at the death.","pubDate":"2023-04-04 20:31:23","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gold dealer Scott Sakupwanya to buy Yadah FC from Prophet Magaya?","link":"https://nehandaradio.com/2023/04/04/gold-dealer-scott-sakupwanya-to-buy-yadah-fc-from-prophet-magaya/","keywords":["Featured","Football","News","Religious","Sports","Pedzisayi Scott Sakupwanya","Scott Sakupwanya","Walter Magaya","Yadah FC"],"creator":["Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Controversial gold dealer Pedzisayi \"Scott\" Sakupwanya is said to be edging closer to completing a deal with PHD Ministries leader Prophet Walter Magaya to buy the latter's Premier League club, Yadah FC.

Since then, iGo said there've been over 1.6 million active player accounts on websites run by more than 40 operators that have agreements with iGaming Ontario. Some of the notable trends over the last year listed by iGo include: - On average, the monthly spend per active player account over the past year was about $70. - According to an Ipsos survey conducted last month and released Tuesday by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), about 85 per cent of respondents who gambled online in the province over the past three months did so on regulated sites. - Basketball was the most popular sport for bettors (28 per cent), followed by soccer (15 per cent), football (14 per cent), hockey (nine per cent) and baseball (eight per cent). - Nearly half (48 per cent) of all casino wagers were on slots. Thirty-two per cent were on table games with a live dealer and the remainder (19 per cent) on computer-based table games. According to the AGCO, there are currently 45 operators live in Ontario and it has approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the province. \"A key objective in this first year has been to move Ontario players from playing on unregulated sites to the regulated market, so that they would benefit from high standards of operator and game integrity, fairness and player protections including responsible gambling standards,\" said AGCO CEO/registrar Tom Mungham. \"Although there's still much work to be done, we're pleased to see such a substantial shift toward gaming on regulated sites so far, and everything that it represents for players and for the province.\" Added iGo board chair Dave Forestell: \"(Tuesday's) numbers demonstrate that Ontario has one of the best online gaming markets in the world. Since Ontario opened the market we have seen new investment, job creation, and captured revenue that used to leave the province. Ontario is well on its way to becoming the best gaming jurisdiction in the world.\" iGaming Ontario (iGo) is a subsidiary of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). It conducts and manages internet gaming in the province. iGo also stated the numbers in its report were unaudited and subject to adjustment. Tuesday's release was a nice change, given figures from the opening three quarters came weeks, sometimes months after the fact. However, again there was no breakdown or information provided regarding exactly where the sports-betting revenue is being earmarked. There was also no breakdown regarding exact fourth-quarter numbers. That's significant considering when Ontario's open market launched in 2022, it was following the Super Bowl and on the final day of March Madness, which are the two most popular sports-betting events. But as of Dec. 31, 2022, the industry had gone over $21.6 billion in total wagers over the first three quarters, with total gaming revenue being $886 million. Based on those figures, the Ontario market seemingly had a $14-billion handle and generated $514 million in revenue over the fourth quarter. That would be increases of 244 per cent from the first-quarter handle ($4.067 billion) and 217 per cent more than the first-quarter revenue ($162 million). What's more, the handle increased 21 per cent from the third quarter ($11.53 billion) and revenues went up 12.5 per cent ($457 million). The overall number of active player accounts (1.6 million) more than tripled over the first quarter (492,000) and player accounts increased substantially from the third quarter (910,000). The iGo report doesn't include revenue from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp’s online operations. \"Every player who places a wager with a legal Operator is doing so in a safe, regulated, and protected environment,\" said iGo executive director Martha Otton. \"I want to thank the players, our 40+ operators and our government partners for placing their trust in us. \"Together we can help this market continue its strong performance.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 4, 2023.

That would be increases of 244 per cent from the first-quarter handle ($4.067 billion) and 217 per cent more than the first-quarter revenue ($162 million). What's more, the handle increased 21 per cent from the third quarter ($11.53 billion) and revenues went up 12.5 per cent ($457 million). The overall number of active player accounts (1.6 million) more than tripled over the first quarter (492,000) and player accounts increased substantially from the third quarter (910,000). The iGo report doesn't include revenue from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp’s online operations. \"Every player who places a wager with a legal Operator is doing so in a safe, regulated, and protected environment,\" said iGo executive director Martha Otton. \"I want to thank the players, our 40+ operators and our government partners for placing their trust in us. \"Together we can help this market continue its strong performance.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 4, 2023.

Their coronation is still coming but the crown already sits on their thrones, unshaken and unmoved, with barely a threat on the horizon. Sundowns’ opponents on Tuesday night – three days after they officially retained their title again – Cape Town City gave them a guard of honour at Loftus. Bar Thapelo Morena, who was on the bench, head coach Rhulani Mokwena fielded arguably his strongest side but they could not overpower the Capetonians during the 0-0 draw. AS IT HAPPENED | Mamelodi Sundowns v Cape Town City They came here to entertain, to put to the sword, to parade their newly minted championship status but they could not find the goal that would garnish the DStv Premiership victory. But the draw didn’t take anything away from their superiority and consistency. In fact, their 18 shots to nine and 67% ball possession almost emphasised the point. Six league titles on the trot, 13 in the PSL era and the latest achieved in record time: with seven matches to spare and more than a month of the season remaining. In athletics terms, it’s Usain Bolt winning the Olympic 100m race three Games in a row and in a world record time. They are Michael Phelps dressed in Bayern Munich gear. Sundowns are still on course to break their most league points (71) by the end of the season, a record they achieved during the 2015/16 season. They could also obliterate their highest league-winning margin, 16, which they set last season. So far, they lead second-placed Pirates by a staggering 20 points. Downs’ first clear chance came in the 23rd minute when Neo Maema freed Cassius Mailula, who squared for their super striker Peter Shalulile. The forward nodded in but the linesman had the last say with his flag. Seven minutes later, City broke free and fashioned a counter-attacking opportunity, which ended with Darwin Gonzalez trying to curl one past an alert Ronwen Williams, who palmed it wide. Mailula had his own (legitimate) chance on 39 minutes after another in a series of late first-half attacking moves but the young attacker’s turn and shot ended up in a safe Darren Keet save. Teboho Mokoena came close with a free-kick that took a nick off a defender before he headed straight at Keet from the resultant corner. READ | Dominant Mamelodi Sundowns: Are they 'killing' the PSL or simply a class apart? Downs could smell the goal; it was just a matter of when they’d crack open the champagne. At half-time (0-0), the bubbly was on ice. But Sundowns’ high press was causing City problems all game and they almost profited just seconds after the break from it when Mailula won the ball in the City box but fed an off-side Shalulile. Sundowns weren’t allowing the Citizens time on the ball and to build from the back but the opposite was not true. The champions were comfortably bossing possession in all areas, leaving City little scraps off which to feed. Mailula came close again before the hour when he again twisted and turned City defenders but fizzed a low left-foot strike past a statuesque Keet and narrowly wide. City was then reduced to 10 men when Cameroonian Brice Ambina Fidèle was shown a second yellow card for an elbow on Aubrey Modiba’s face. The visitors needed some heroic Keet goalkeeping and Marc van Heerden defending as the two veterans prevented a flood of chances turning into a Downs winning goal at the death.","pubDate":"2023-04-04 20:31:23","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gold dealer Scott Sakupwanya to buy Yadah FC from Prophet Magaya?","link":"https://nehandaradio.com/2023/04/04/gold-dealer-scott-sakupwanya-to-buy-yadah-fc-from-prophet-magaya/","keywords":["Featured","Football","News","Religious","Sports","Pedzisayi Scott Sakupwanya","Scott Sakupwanya","Walter Magaya","Yadah FC"],"creator":["Staff Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Controversial gold dealer Pedzisayi \"Scott\" Sakupwanya is said to be edging closer to completing a deal with PHD Ministries leader Prophet Walter Magaya to buy the latter's Premier League club, Yadah FC.

If anything of that sort happens we shall give advice. “Currently we are working with Yadah FC, we are their sponsors for this season hence the club’s kit carries the Better Brands logo.

Since then, iGo said there've been over 1.6 million active player accounts on websites run by more than 40 operators that have agreements with iGaming Ontario. Some of the notable trends over the last year listed by iGo include: - On average, the monthly spend per active player account over the past year was about $70. - According to an Ipsos survey conducted last month and released Tuesday by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO), about 85 per cent of respondents who gambled online in the province over the past three months did so on regulated sites. - Basketball was the most popular sport for bettors (28 per cent), followed by soccer (15 per cent), football (14 per cent), hockey (nine per cent) and baseball (eight per cent). - Nearly half (48 per cent) of all casino wagers were on slots. Thirty-two per cent were on table games with a live dealer and the remainder (19 per cent) on computer-based table games. According to the AGCO, there are currently 45 operators live in Ontario and it has approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the province. \"A key objective in this first year has been to move Ontario players from playing on unregulated sites to the regulated market, so that they would benefit from high standards of operator and game integrity, fairness and player protections including responsible gambling standards,\" said AGCO CEO/registrar Tom Mungham. \"Although there's still much work to be done, we're pleased to see such a substantial shift toward gaming on regulated sites so far, and everything that it represents for players and for the province.\" Added iGo board chair Dave Forestell: \"(Tuesday's) numbers demonstrate that Ontario has one of the best online gaming markets in the world. Since Ontario opened the market we have seen new investment, job creation, and captured revenue that used to leave the province. Ontario is well on its way to becoming the best gaming jurisdiction in the world.\" iGaming Ontario (iGo) is a subsidiary of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). It conducts and manages internet gaming in the province. iGo also stated the numbers in its report were unaudited and subject to adjustment. Tuesday's release was a nice change, given figures from the opening three quarters came weeks, sometimes months after the fact. However, again there was no breakdown or information provided regarding exactly where the sports-betting revenue is being earmarked. There was also no breakdown regarding exact fourth-quarter numbers. That's significant considering when Ontario's open market launched in 2022, it was following the Super Bowl and on the final day of March Madness, which are the two most popular sports-betting events. But as of Dec. 31, 2022, the industry had gone over $21.6 billion in total wagers over the first three quarters, with total gaming revenue being $886 million. Based on those figures, the Ontario market seemingly had a $14-billion handle and generated $514 million in revenue over the fourth quarter. That would be increases of 244 per cent from the first-quarter handle ($4.067 billion) and 217 per cent more than the first-quarter revenue ($162 million).

Það verður að teljast afar ólíklegt að Saliba verði orðinn klár í leikinn á sunnudaginn en áður en hann meiddist hafði hann byrjað alla 27 leiki Arsenal í úrvalsdeildinni á tímabilinu.","pubDate":"2023-04-04 16:31:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"mbl","category":["sports"],"country":["Iceland"],"language":"Icelandic"},{"title":"Switzerland to host women's Euro 2025 football tournament","link":"https://www.france24.com/en/sport/20230404-switzerland-to-host-women-s-euro-2025-football-tournament","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["NEWS WIRES"],"video_url":null,"description":"Switzerland will host the 2025 Women's European Championship, European soccer's governing body UEFA said on Tuesday.","content":"Switzerland will host the 2025 Women's European Championship, European soccer's governing body UEFA said on Tuesday.","pubDate":"2023-04-04 16:09:03","image_url":"https://s.france24.com/media/display/be9f7362-d2ff-11ed-a6dd-005056bfb2b6/w:1024/p:16x9/000_QU5UJ.jpg","source_id":"france24","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Вердер Бремен преговаря с една от звездите си","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/germania/multimedia/video/verder-bremen-pregovaria-s-edna-ot-zvezdite-si-728601","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"...","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-04-04 15:44:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"gong","category":["sports"],"country":["bulgaria"],"language":"bulgarian"},{"title":"Роберто де Дзерби не попада в сметките на Челси","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/anglia/multimedia/video/roberto-de-dzerbi-ne-popada-v-smetkite-na-chelsi-728600","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"...","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-04-04 15:44:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"gong","category":["sports"],"country":["bulgaria"],"language":"bulgarian"}]}
