This was part of the Ghana Football Association’s effort to reshape the senior side to its glory days and also prepare them for international competitions. The players were taken through an intensive training session in Prampram to keep up with their fitness level and also learn some tactical skills going into the clash against their West African opponents. The players were made up of both foreign-based players and some local players selected from the 20 Premier League clubs in Ghana. Black Queens would depart Accra on Friday to Cotonou as they face Benin on February 19, 2023, after which they would take on Togo on February 25, 2023. The selected players are Abdulai Salamatu, Acheampong Juliet, Achiaa Anasthesia, Adubea Princella, Alhassan Adama, Amponsah Ophelia, Anima Naomi, Animah Grace, Appiah Martha, Asantewaa Grace, Atovor Edem, Evelyn Badu, Boaduwaa Doris, Boakye Portia, and Bugre Azumah.

PSL: Predicting the Orlando Pirates XI vs Maritzburg LOL: Five things that didn’t exist when Kaizer Chiefs last won a trophy Pirates fumbled the bag big time According to FIFA rules, a club that developed an U23 player is obliged to accrue a payment for every international transfer that the player makes. Pirates waived their share of future sell-on fees in the case of Lyle Foster, however, when the now 22-year-old moved to Monaco back in 2019. The Ligue 1 Principality side paid R20 million for Foster back then, which is a tiny proportion of the €10 million (R194 million) that Burnley shelled out for the talented Bafana striker.

They’re clearly benefiting from the loan system which has seen them acquire a number of Kaizer Chiefs stars on a temporary basis. “Tough one, it’s going to be an interesting one, but very good for football, I think the Nedbank Cup is giving all clubs an opportunity even in the lower divisions, talented players get to be seen and spotted by big teams,” coach Arthur Zwane said at Naturena on Thursday. Former Chiefs Head of Development Sundra Govinder is performing admirably alongside co-owner and head coach Bucs Mthombeni. Assistant duo Thabo Nthethe and Paulus Masehe are also chipping in.

The round-eight derby was abandoned after just 21 minutes as fans stormed the AAMI Park pitch during an emotion-charged fixture amid protests against the A-Leagues' controversial decision to play grand finals in Sydney for the next three years. Referee Alex King was injured and a television cameraman was hurt when struck by a flare, while City goalkeeper Tom Glover suffered concussion and lacerations to the face when hit with a metal bucket. The drama has cast a dark shadow over last-placed Victory's horror campaign, with $550,000 in fines and crowd restrictions among the sanctions handed down by Football Australia. The threat of a 10-point deduction - to be imposed if there is further crowd trouble within the next three-and-a-half seasons - still hangs over the club ahead of Saturday night's clash at AAMI Park. \"No one's ignoring it (but) we've all moved on from that,\" Victory coach Tony Popovic said. \"I don't know if the players are speaking about it internally but we're not addressing it as a group. \"We're happy to see our fans and members back, (and) we want that to continue.\" City led December's derby through a well-crafted Aiden O'Neill goal before the match was called off. They have since gone on to build a commanding eight-point lead over Central Coast at the top of the table, with a game in hand, and coach Rado Vidosic is adamant his players are focused on the task at hand. \"We are not going to talk about the 'memorable' things,\" Vidosic said, in reference to the pitch invasion. \"We will show some of the clips from the (previous derby) game, some of our attacking combination play. We scored a beautiful goal. \"We had several other good opportunities in the first 20 minutes but also they had a couple of chances as well. \"It's a derby, the form and position on the table never really make a big difference. It's going to be who does better on the day.\" Victory have managed just one win in eight matches since the abandoned derby but four fresh faces brought in during the transfer window have boosted hopes of a turnaround in fortunes. Damien Da Silva, Connor Chapman and Bruce Kamau all featured in last week's defeat away to Newcastle and could be joined by Fernando Romero in the side to face City. The Paraguyan striker - on loan from Primera Division outfit Cerro Porteno - is a chance to make his Victory debut off the bench as Popovic urges his side to use the derby as a springboard back into finals contention. \"We feel we're very close to turning this,\" Popovic said. \"There's no better night or no better game to do it than in a derby. \"We're up against the best (and) that's a fantastic challenge. We know we're good enough to win the game. \"Instead of talking about it, we have to show it in our performance. \"If we bring out the best performance I think we can really show Melbourne City what a good team we are.\" Sign up for our emails","pubDate":"2023-02-17 05:27:58","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-9787699/5a38e9111b2c17fe44420e3493a5eba1783e16d5-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WAFL 2023: Perth chase former Geelong midfielder Quinton Narkle as Essendon, Richmond VFL also in the hunt","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/perth-football-club/wafl-2023-perth-chase-former-geelong-midfielder-quinton-narkle-as-essendon-richmond-vfl-also-in-the-hunt-c-9785192","keywords":null,"creator":["Mitchell Woodcock"],"video_url":null,"description":"Perth are competing against two VFL sides for the signature of former Geelong midfielder Quinton Narkle after he did not get a spot on Richmond’s list.","content":"Perth are competing against two VFL sides for the signature of former Geelong midfielder Quinton Narkle after he did not get a spot on Richmond’s list. Narkle, 25, trained with the Tigers over the summer but was overlooked in favour of country forward Kaelan Bradtke, who was also set to play for Perth if he did not get a gig in the AFL. The AFL’s Supplementary Selection Period closed on Wednesday, meaning Narkle must now wait until the mid-season draft to add to his 41 games for the Cats. Staff writers Craig O'Donoghue The West Australian understands both Richmond and Essendon’s VFL sides want Narkle to play for them this season, with the midfielder weighing up his future based on his family. “Quinton came back from the Christmas break in career-best condition and impressed us with his character and commitment to our program,” Richmond national recruiting manager Matt Clarke said. “Unfortunately we did not have two spots available, so we needed to make a very hard decision. He couldn’t have done any more during his time training at the club.” Meanwhile, troubled former AFL star Sydney Stack is committed to playing for the Demons, having hit the track in their past eight sessions. Stack, 22, is set to be an important part of the Demons’ midfielder in 2023 as they seek a return to finals under new coach Peter German. Perth have also denied reports Sam Stubbs is unlikely to play for them in 2023, saying they’re off the mark. Stubbs has met with the club twice this week and is set to be at the club on Friday night after missing out on a spot on Fremantle’s list this year after training with them all summer. There were reports Stubbs did not want to play for Perth and even could play amateurs, but a Demons official shot them down and said the forward was committed to the club.

The post Again, Partey may miss Arsenal’s clash with Aston Villa appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.","content":"Arsenal Manager, Mikel Arteta, has not given a return date for Thomas Partey after the midfielder missed out on Arsenal’s defeat to Manchester City with an injury. The 29-year-old is now a major doubt to once again be unavailable for the Gunners’ 12:30pm clash at Aston Villa tomorrow – live on talkSPORT. Prior to Arsenal’s biggest game of the season, Partey was ruled out with a muscular problem on the day of the match. Partey, who was in attendance at the Emirates to cheer on his teammates, was replaced by January arrival Jorginho in the lone defensive midfield role. It was the first match that the Ghana international has been unavailable for since Arsenal‘s 3-1 defeat away at Manchester United in September. Speaking to Amazon Prime prior to kick-off, Arteta said of Partey: “It’s what happens in football. Players pick up injuries. “Unfortunately, Thomas felt something in his back muscle and he wasn’t available to play today.” And in his post-match press conference, the Spaniard declared he is unsure when the ex-Atletico Madrid man will be back ahead of the trip to Villa. Pressed for an update on his fitness, Arteta stated: “We don’t know. It’s what happens, it’s part of football. “I think Jorgi played a good game and we have to assess Tommy to see how bad it is.” Asked how late did he find out that Partey wouldn’t be able to play against City, Arteta remarked: “Very late. Very, very late.” A potential spell on the sidelines will be a huge blow for Arsenal, who are in somewhat of a mini-crisis having failed to win any of their last three Premier League games. They have now dropped down into second spot – level on points with City – though they do have a game in hand over Pep Guardiola’s men. Arteta’s side will have to get back to form to make sure they don’t lose ground on City with the goal difference the only thing separating the two. However, Arsenal do have an advantage if they can stay close to the Citizens as they still have a game in hand. Arsenal’s game in hand over Man City is at home to Everton on Wednesday, March 1. It will kick off at the Emirates at 7:45 p.m. The fixture was originally due to take place on Saturday, September 10 but was postponed due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A win for the Gunners could potentially see them regain the advantage in the title race and move back to the top of the Premier League table. Although they could already be there if they are to better Man City’s results up until the game in hand is played, in which case, three points against Everton would move them further clear. However, they lost only their second game of the season to the Toffees in Sean Dyche’s first game in charge of the Merseyside club. So, despite the two teams battling at opposite ends of the table, the clash will definitely not be an easy one for Arteta’s men.

Trabzonspor announced before the Europa Conference League tie that all proceeds from the game will be donated to the victims.

It certainly was. Not only a throwback to Solskjaer’s unforgettable winner in the 1999 Champions League final victory over Bayern Munich here, but to the days when United and Barcelona were slugging it out for Europe’s biggest prize. These two clubs don’t do boring, not even in the Europa League. One of the greatest match-ups in football produced a spectacle befitting its top billing at a packed Nou Camp last night. Marcus Rashford lit up the old place. He was practically unplayable for periods in the second half. Rashford scored one – his 14th goal in the last 16 games – to bring United level in the second half and created another. Marcos Alonso got the hosts off to a strong start in the second period opening the scoring in the 50th minute of the match Marcus Rashford scored his fourth in as many games just two minutes later to draw the visitors back level An own goal from Jules Kounde then allowed the Red Devils to take the lead just nine minutes after having gone behind Raphinha equalised to make it 2-2 on 76 minutes to deny the visitors a crucial first leg win in the Europa League play-off On the eve of this game, Barca boss Xavi had described Rashford as one of Europe’s most dangerous strikers and he looked like it, playing in a central role that isn’t meant to bring out the best in him. Who says? He put United within 14 minutes of beating Barca for the first time ever here. Who knows how this game would have turned out had referee Maurizio Mariani sent off Jules Kounde for a challenge on Rashford when United were still 2-1 up? Contact was made outside the box so no penalty, but Kounde can count himself a lucky boy that the Italian official took no action at all. Having gone ahead through former Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso, Barcelona levelled with a goal from another player familiar to the Premier League, Raphinha, to leave this tie all square going into next week’s second leg at Old Trafford. What a first leg it was. End to end, blow for blow. Two of Europe’s greats going at it like there was a Champions League final at stake, not a place in the Europa League last 16. The 94,000 fans in the Nou Camp loved it. United will feel as though they should have headed home with an advantage over what is, to be fair, far from the greatest Barcelona team of all time. But by the end of a pulsating game, it was the Catalans who were looking more likely to score. United came here planning to attack, even though an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation didn’t necessarily look like it. Erik ten Hag’s side had Bruno Fernandes on the right and Jadon Sancho switching to the left with, even more strangely, 6ft 6in striker Wout Weghorst playing in midfield. ‘Tactical’, was Ten Hag’s explanation and it worked for the most part with Weghorst able to help stifle Frenkie de Jong and Franck Kessie in the middle. The in-form England star equalised for his side in the 52nd minute of the game to continue his own rich purple patch David de Gea was rooted to the spot anticipating a touch from start striker Robert Lewandowski from Raphinha's cross in The sun had barely dipped below the towering banks of the Nou Camp when we got underway, but you quickly forgot that this was a Europa League tie kicking off at 5.45pm in the UK.

Barcelona responded as David de Gea beat away an effort from Robert Lewandowski, and Alonso and Jordi Alba both fired over. United created the best chances before half-time, however, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen denying Weghorst and Rashford. If the first half was entertaining, the second was a belter. Barca went ahead in the 50th minute when former Leeds favourite Raphinha swung a corner towards the back post where Alonso had already taken up position after peeling away from Fred. The United midfielder had got his body shape all wrong and was facing the wrong way entirely by the time Alonso rose to plant a downward header past inside De Gea’s near post. United roared straight back and equalised just two minutes later. Fred atoned by slipping a pass in between Alba and Alonso, the latter chasing Rashford as he broke into the box. United’s in-form striker looked to have taken the ball too wide with his first touch, and a cross seemed like the better option. But Rashford is playing with so much confidence at the moment that he fancied his chances, and rifled a shot past Ter Stegen at his near post. The England man was instrumental again when United took the lead seven minutes later. Luke Shaw played a short corner to Rashford and, again, the easier option seemed to be to take the ball to the left, away from Raphinha. Instead, Rashford suddenly dipped to the right where there was almost no space and beat his man before racing along the byeline. He crossed to the edge of the six-yard box where Fernandes helped the ball on and Kounde bundled the ball over his own goal line. Erik ten Hag said before the game that he wanted his side to take Barcelona out of their 'comfort zone' at the Nou Camp more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Xavi plotting to nullify top talent Marcus Rashford Watch video Erik ten Hag and Luke Shaw speak ahead of Man U clash with Barcelona Watch video Xavi and Ten Hag react to thrilling encounter between Utd and Barcelona Watch video Sort Out Your Life team declutters and organises 'regular' home Watch video Video shows never-before seen Titanic footage of human dive in 1986 Watch video Robert Ballard speaks on 1986 Titanic Exploration Expedition dive Watch video Nicola dive expert: 'I would have changed my whole search strategy' Watch video Storm Otto: Met Office warns of strong winds of 70 mph to hit UK Watch video TikT-oker demonstrates tongue exercises she used for defined jaw Watch video Researchers claim Russia's war could push millions more into poverty Watch video Live cam captures birth of two rare tiger cubs at Chester zoo Watch video Woman tells Prue Leith how her parents chose their death However, this is a Barcelona side unbeaten in their last 17 games now and they weren’t done yet. When Casemiro played an uncharacteristically poor pass on the edge of his own box in the 746th minute, the ball was intercepted and played out to Raphinha. He whipped in a cross and the presence of Lewandowski only seemed to confuse United as the Pole failed to get a touch on the ball which flew through Raphael Varane’s legs and past De Gea. Casemiro almost went one better – or worse – when he directed the ball against his own post in the frantic, dying moments. So we head back to Old Trafford to do it all again next week. What a treat.

Rashford is full of confidence at present and the Manchester United star made a significant impact in the 2-2 draw with Barcelona in the Europa League as he scored and also played a major part in Jules Kounde 's own goal. So far this season Rashford has scored 22 goals for United, matching his best ever tally from the 2019-20 campaign. Asked on BT Sport whether Rashford is one of the best finishers in the world, United legend Scholes said: 'He is at this point. This season he's been absolutely brilliant. You'd like to see it over the next four or five years if he's going to get to the levels of the really top players in the world. 'But tonight to come to Barcelona to come to this stadium, great atmosphere. It was a bit wild there, that's probably one of his better chances, but his all round play, his ability to go past people, his movement, the goal. He's got the power to do that. His all round game at the moment is nothing short of brilliant.' Paul Scholes praised Marcus Rashford, describing his all-round game as 'absolutely brilliant' Manchester United legend Scholes agreed Rashford is one of the best finishers at present Another former United player, Owen Hargreaves, also spoke fondly of Rashford. Hargreaves stated that given the way in which he is playing, Rashford will feel that he can get the better of any defender at present. In addition, Hargreaves feels that Rashford is capable of having a significant impact in different positions. Hargreaves said: 'I like to see him in different positions. He loves running off the left, Ten Hag played him quite central today. All the goals came off the right hand side. If he's allowed to drift I don't think you can stop him. 'I don't think he looks at any defender and sees any fear. Kounde's a great athlete, Araujo's a terrific athlete, but Marcus I don't think he had any fear whoever was in front of him. If he's positive and runs forward, I think he thinks he can beat anyone right now.' Rashford was on the scoresheet again in United's 2-2 Europa League draw against Barcelona Owen Hargreaves believes that Rashford won't be fearful of facing any defender at present Rashford will hope to keep making a major impact for United until the end of the campaign as the club look to end their wait for a trophy. In addition to their involvement in the Europa League, United are through to the final of the Carabao Cup, where they will take on Newcastle, while they are home to West Ham in the FA Cup fifth round. They are currently third in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Manchester City.

The players were made up of both foreign-based players and some local players selected from the 20 Premier League clubs in Ghana.

They’re clearly benefiting from the loan system which has seen them acquire a number of Kaizer Chiefs stars on a temporary basis. “Tough one, it’s going to be an interesting one, but very good for football, I think the Nedbank Cup is giving all clubs an opportunity even in the lower divisions, talented players get to be seen and spotted by big teams,” coach Arthur Zwane said at Naturena on Thursday.

The round-eight derby was abandoned after just 21 minutes as fans stormed the AAMI Park pitch during an emotion-charged fixture amid protests against the A-Leagues' controversial decision to play grand finals in Sydney for the next three years. Referee Alex King was injured and a television cameraman was hurt when struck by a flare, while City goalkeeper Tom Glover suffered concussion and lacerations to the face when hit with a metal bucket. The drama has cast a dark shadow over last-placed Victory's horror campaign, with $550,000 in fines and crowd restrictions among the sanctions handed down by Football Australia. The threat of a 10-point deduction - to be imposed if there is further crowd trouble within the next three-and-a-half seasons - still hangs over the club ahead of Saturday night's clash at AAMI Park. \"No one's ignoring it (but) we've all moved on from that,\" Victory coach Tony Popovic said. \"I don't know if the players are speaking about it internally but we're not addressing it as a group. \"We're happy to see our fans and members back, (and) we want that to continue.\" City led December's derby through a well-crafted Aiden O'Neill goal before the match was called off. They have since gone on to build a commanding eight-point lead over Central Coast at the top of the table, with a game in hand, and coach Rado Vidosic is adamant his players are focused on the task at hand. \"We are not going to talk about the 'memorable' things,\" Vidosic said, in reference to the pitch invasion. \"We will show some of the clips from the (previous derby) game, some of our attacking combination play. We scored a beautiful goal. \"We had several other good opportunities in the first 20 minutes but also they had a couple of chances as well. \"It's a derby, the form and position on the table never really make a big difference. It's going to be who does better on the day.\" Victory have managed just one win in eight matches since the abandoned derby but four fresh faces brought in during the transfer window have boosted hopes of a turnaround in fortunes. Damien Da Silva, Connor Chapman and Bruce Kamau all featured in last week's defeat away to Newcastle and could be joined by Fernando Romero in the side to face City. The Paraguyan striker - on loan from Primera Division outfit Cerro Porteno - is a chance to make his Victory debut off the bench as Popovic urges his side to use the derby as a springboard back into finals contention. \"We feel we're very close to turning this,\" Popovic said. \"There's no better night or no better game to do it than in a derby. \"We're up against the best (and) that's a fantastic challenge. We know we're good enough to win the game. \"Instead of talking about it, we have to show it in our performance. \"If we bring out the best performance I think we can really show Melbourne City what a good team we are.\" Sign up for our emails","pubDate":"2023-02-17 05:27:58","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-9787699/5a38e9111b2c17fe44420e3493a5eba1783e16d5-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WAFL 2023: Perth chase former Geelong midfielder Quinton Narkle as Essendon, Richmond VFL also in the hunt","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/perth-football-club/wafl-2023-perth-chase-former-geelong-midfielder-quinton-narkle-as-essendon-richmond-vfl-also-in-the-hunt-c-9785192","keywords":null,"creator":["Mitchell Woodcock"],"video_url":null,"description":"Perth are competing against two VFL sides for the signature of former Geelong midfielder Quinton Narkle after he did not get a spot on Richmond’s list.","content":"Perth are competing against two VFL sides for the signature of former Geelong midfielder Quinton Narkle after he did not get a spot on Richmond’s list. Narkle, 25, trained with the Tigers over the summer but was overlooked in favour of country forward Kaelan Bradtke, who was also set to play for Perth if he did not get a gig in the AFL. The AFL’s Supplementary Selection Period closed on Wednesday, meaning Narkle must now wait until the mid-season draft to add to his 41 games for the Cats. Staff writers Craig O'Donoghue The West Australian understands both Richmond and Essendon’s VFL sides want Narkle to play for them this season, with the midfielder weighing up his future based on his family. “Quinton came back from the Christmas break in career-best condition and impressed us with his character and commitment to our program,” Richmond national recruiting manager Matt Clarke said. “Unfortunately we did not have two spots available, so we needed to make a very hard decision. He couldn’t have done any more during his time training at the club.” Meanwhile, troubled former AFL star Sydney Stack is committed to playing for the Demons, having hit the track in their past eight sessions. Stack, 22, is set to be an important part of the Demons’ midfielder in 2023 as they seek a return to finals under new coach Peter German. Perth have also denied reports Sam Stubbs is unlikely to play for them in 2023, saying they’re off the mark. Stubbs has met with the club twice this week and is set to be at the club on Friday night after missing out on a spot on Fremantle’s list this year after training with them all summer. There were reports Stubbs did not want to play for Perth and even could play amateurs, but a Demons official shot them down and said the forward was committed to the club.

The post Again, Partey may miss Arsenal’s clash with Aston Villa appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.","content":"Arsenal Manager, Mikel Arteta, has not given a return date for Thomas Partey after the midfielder missed out on Arsenal’s defeat to Manchester City with an injury. The 29-year-old is now a major doubt to once again be unavailable for the Gunners’ 12:30pm clash at Aston Villa tomorrow – live on talkSPORT. Prior to Arsenal’s biggest game of the season, Partey was ruled out with a muscular problem on the day of the match. Partey, who was in attendance at the Emirates to cheer on his teammates, was replaced by January arrival Jorginho in the lone defensive midfield role. It was the first match that the Ghana international has been unavailable for since Arsenal‘s 3-1 defeat away at Manchester United in September. Speaking to Amazon Prime prior to kick-off, Arteta said of Partey: “It’s what happens in football. Players pick up injuries. “Unfortunately, Thomas felt something in his back muscle and he wasn’t available to play today.” And in his post-match press conference, the Spaniard declared he is unsure when the ex-Atletico Madrid man will be back ahead of the trip to Villa. Pressed for an update on his fitness, Arteta stated: “We don’t know. It’s what happens, it’s part of football. “I think Jorgi played a good game and we have to assess Tommy to see how bad it is.” Asked how late did he find out that Partey wouldn’t be able to play against City, Arteta remarked: “Very late. Very, very late.” A potential spell on the sidelines will be a huge blow for Arsenal, who are in somewhat of a mini-crisis having failed to win any of their last three Premier League games. They have now dropped down into second spot – level on points with City – though they do have a game in hand over Pep Guardiola’s men. Arteta’s side will have to get back to form to make sure they don’t lose ground on City with the goal difference the only thing separating the two. However, Arsenal do have an advantage if they can stay close to the Citizens as they still have a game in hand. Arsenal’s game in hand over Man City is at home to Everton on Wednesday, March 1. It will kick off at the Emirates at 7:45 p.m. The fixture was originally due to take place on Saturday, September 10 but was postponed due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A win for the Gunners could potentially see them regain the advantage in the title race and move back to the top of the Premier League table. Although they could already be there if they are to better Man City’s results up until the game in hand is played, in which case, three points against Everton would move them further clear. However, they lost only their second game of the season to the Toffees in Sean Dyche’s first game in charge of the Merseyside club. So, despite the two teams battling at opposite ends of the table, the clash will definitely not be an easy one for Arteta’s men.

It certainly was. Not only a throwback to Solskjaer’s unforgettable winner in the 1999 Champions League final victory over Bayern Munich here, but to the days when United and Barcelona were slugging it out for Europe’s biggest prize. These two clubs don’t do boring, not even in the Europa League. One of the greatest match-ups in football produced a spectacle befitting its top billing at a packed Nou Camp last night. Marcus Rashford lit up the old place. He was practically unplayable for periods in the second half. Rashford scored one – his 14th goal in the last 16 games – to bring United level in the second half and created another. Marcos Alonso got the hosts off to a strong start in the second period opening the scoring in the 50th minute of the match Marcus Rashford scored his fourth in as many games just two minutes later to draw the visitors back level An own goal from Jules Kounde then allowed the Red Devils to take the lead just nine minutes after having gone behind Raphinha equalised to make it 2-2 on 76 minutes to deny the visitors a crucial first leg win in the Europa League play-off On the eve of this game, Barca boss Xavi had described Rashford as one of Europe’s most dangerous strikers and he looked like it, playing in a central role that isn’t meant to bring out the best in him. Who says? He put United within 14 minutes of beating Barca for the first time ever here. Who knows how this game would have turned out had referee Maurizio Mariani sent off Jules Kounde for a challenge on Rashford when United were still 2-1 up? Contact was made outside the box so no penalty, but Kounde can count himself a lucky boy that the Italian official took no action at all. Having gone ahead through former Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso, Barcelona levelled with a goal from another player familiar to the Premier League, Raphinha, to leave this tie all square going into next week’s second leg at Old Trafford. What a first leg it was. End to end, blow for blow. Two of Europe’s greats going at it like there was a Champions League final at stake, not a place in the Europa League last 16. The 94,000 fans in the Nou Camp loved it. United will feel as though they should have headed home with an advantage over what is, to be fair, far from the greatest Barcelona team of all time. But by the end of a pulsating game, it was the Catalans who were looking more likely to score. United came here planning to attack, even though an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation didn’t necessarily look like it. Erik ten Hag’s side had Bruno Fernandes on the right and Jadon Sancho switching to the left with, even more strangely, 6ft 6in striker Wout Weghorst playing in midfield. ‘Tactical’, was Ten Hag’s explanation and it worked for the most part with Weghorst able to help stifle Frenkie de Jong and Franck Kessie in the middle. The in-form England star equalised for his side in the 52nd minute of the game to continue his own rich purple patch David de Gea was rooted to the spot anticipating a touch from start striker Robert Lewandowski from Raphinha's cross in The sun had barely dipped below the towering banks of the Nou Camp when we got underway, but you quickly forgot that this was a Europa League tie kicking off at 5.45pm in the UK.

Barcelona responded as David de Gea beat away an effort from Robert Lewandowski, and Alonso and Jordi Alba both fired over. United created the best chances before half-time, however, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen denying Weghorst and Rashford. If the first half was entertaining, the second was a belter. Barca went ahead in the 50th minute when former Leeds favourite Raphinha swung a corner towards the back post where Alonso had already taken up position after peeling away from Fred. The United midfielder had got his body shape all wrong and was facing the wrong way entirely by the time Alonso rose to plant a downward header past inside De Gea’s near post. United roared straight back and equalised just two minutes later. Fred atoned by slipping a pass in between Alba and Alonso, the latter chasing Rashford as he broke into the box. United’s in-form striker looked to have taken the ball too wide with his first touch, and a cross seemed like the better option. But Rashford is playing with so much confidence at the moment that he fancied his chances, and rifled a shot past Ter Stegen at his near post. The England man was instrumental again when United took the lead seven minutes later. Luke Shaw played a short corner to Rashford and, again, the easier option seemed to be to take the ball to the left, away from Raphinha. Instead, Rashford suddenly dipped to the right where there was almost no space and beat his man before racing along the byeline. He crossed to the edge of the six-yard box where Fernandes helped the ball on and Kounde bundled the ball over his own goal line. Erik ten Hag said before the game that he wanted his side to take Barcelona out of their 'comfort zone' at the Nou Camp more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Xavi plotting to nullify top talent Marcus Rashford Watch video Erik ten Hag and Luke Shaw speak ahead of Man U clash with Barcelona Watch video Xavi and Ten Hag react to thrilling encounter between Utd and Barcelona Watch video Sort Out Your Life team declutters and organises 'regular' home Watch video Video shows never-before seen Titanic footage of human dive in 1986 Watch video Robert Ballard speaks on 1986 Titanic Exploration Expedition dive Watch video Nicola dive expert: 'I would have changed my whole search strategy' Watch video Storm Otto: Met Office warns of strong winds of 70 mph to hit UK Watch video TikT-oker demonstrates tongue exercises she used for defined jaw Watch video Researchers claim Russia's war could push millions more into poverty Watch video Live cam captures birth of two rare tiger cubs at Chester zoo Watch video Woman tells Prue Leith how her parents chose their death However, this is a Barcelona side unbeaten in their last 17 games now and they weren’t done yet. When Casemiro played an uncharacteristically poor pass on the edge of his own box in the 746th minute, the ball was intercepted and played out to Raphinha. He whipped in a cross and the presence of Lewandowski only seemed to confuse United as the Pole failed to get a touch on the ball which flew through Raphael Varane’s legs and past De Gea. Casemiro almost went one better – or worse – when he directed the ball against his own post in the frantic, dying moments. So we head back to Old Trafford to do it all again next week. What a treat.

Rashford is full of confidence at present and the Manchester United star made a significant impact in the 2-2 draw with Barcelona in the Europa League as he scored and also played a major part in Jules Kounde 's own goal. So far this season Rashford has scored 22 goals for United, matching his best ever tally from the 2019-20 campaign. Asked on BT Sport whether Rashford is one of the best finishers in the world, United legend Scholes said: 'He is at this point. This season he's been absolutely brilliant. You'd like to see it over the next four or five years if he's going to get to the levels of the really top players in the world. 'But tonight to come to Barcelona to come to this stadium, great atmosphere. It was a bit wild there, that's probably one of his better chances, but his all round play, his ability to go past people, his movement, the goal. He's got the power to do that. His all round game at the moment is nothing short of brilliant.' Paul Scholes praised Marcus Rashford, describing his all-round game as 'absolutely brilliant' Manchester United legend Scholes agreed Rashford is one of the best finishers at present Another former United player, Owen Hargreaves, also spoke fondly of Rashford. Hargreaves stated that given the way in which he is playing, Rashford will feel that he can get the better of any defender at present. In addition, Hargreaves feels that Rashford is capable of having a significant impact in different positions. Hargreaves said: 'I like to see him in different positions. He loves running off the left, Ten Hag played him quite central today. All the goals came off the right hand side. If he's allowed to drift I don't think you can stop him. 'I don't think he looks at any defender and sees any fear. Kounde's a great athlete, Araujo's a terrific athlete, but Marcus I don't think he had any fear whoever was in front of him. If he's positive and runs forward, I think he thinks he can beat anyone right now.' Rashford was on the scoresheet again in United's 2-2 Europa League draw against Barcelona Owen Hargreaves believes that Rashford won't be fearful of facing any defender at present Rashford will hope to keep making a major impact for United until the end of the campaign as the club look to end their wait for a trophy. In addition to their involvement in the Europa League, United are through to the final of the Carabao Cup, where they will take on Newcastle, while they are home to West Ham in the FA Cup fifth round. They are currently third in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Manchester City.

They’re clearly benefiting from the loan system which has seen them acquire a number of Kaizer Chiefs stars on a temporary basis. “Tough one, it’s going to be an interesting one, but very good for football, I think the Nedbank Cup is giving all clubs an opportunity even in the lower divisions, talented players get to be seen and spotted by big teams,” coach Arthur Zwane said at Naturena on Thursday.

The round-eight derby was abandoned after just 21 minutes as fans stormed the AAMI Park pitch during an emotion-charged fixture amid protests against the A-Leagues' controversial decision to play grand finals in Sydney for the next three years. Referee Alex King was injured and a television cameraman was hurt when struck by a flare, while City goalkeeper Tom Glover suffered concussion and lacerations to the face when hit with a metal bucket. The drama has cast a dark shadow over last-placed Victory's horror campaign, with $550,000 in fines and crowd restrictions among the sanctions handed down by Football Australia. The threat of a 10-point deduction - to be imposed if there is further crowd trouble within the next three-and-a-half seasons - still hangs over the club ahead of Saturday night's clash at AAMI Park. \"No one's ignoring it (but) we've all moved on from that,\" Victory coach Tony Popovic said. \"I don't know if the players are speaking about it internally but we're not addressing it as a group. \"We're happy to see our fans and members back, (and) we want that to continue.\" City led December's derby through a well-crafted Aiden O'Neill goal before the match was called off. They have since gone on to build a commanding eight-point lead over Central Coast at the top of the table, with a game in hand, and coach Rado Vidosic is adamant his players are focused on the task at hand. \"We are not going to talk about the 'memorable' things,\" Vidosic said, in reference to the pitch invasion. \"We will show some of the clips from the (previous derby) game, some of our attacking combination play. We scored a beautiful goal. \"We had several other good opportunities in the first 20 minutes but also they had a couple of chances as well. \"It's a derby, the form and position on the table never really make a big difference. It's going to be who does better on the day.\" Victory have managed just one win in eight matches since the abandoned derby but four fresh faces brought in during the transfer window have boosted hopes of a turnaround in fortunes. Damien Da Silva, Connor Chapman and Bruce Kamau all featured in last week's defeat away to Newcastle and could be joined by Fernando Romero in the side to face City. The Paraguyan striker - on loan from Primera Division outfit Cerro Porteno - is a chance to make his Victory debut off the bench as Popovic urges his side to use the derby as a springboard back into finals contention. \"We feel we're very close to turning this,\" Popovic said. \"There's no better night or no better game to do it than in a derby. \"We're up against the best (and) that's a fantastic challenge.

The AFL’s Supplementary Selection Period closed on Wednesday, meaning Narkle must now wait until the mid-season draft to add to his 41 games for the Cats. Staff writers Craig O'Donoghue The West Australian understands both Richmond and Essendon’s VFL sides want Narkle to play for them this season, with the midfielder weighing up his future based on his family. “Quinton came back from the Christmas break in career-best condition and impressed us with his character and commitment to our program,” Richmond national recruiting manager Matt Clarke said. “Unfortunately we did not have two spots available, so we needed to make a very hard decision. He couldn’t have done any more during his time training at the club.” Meanwhile, troubled former AFL star Sydney Stack is committed to playing for the Demons, having hit the track in their past eight sessions. Stack, 22, is set to be an important part of the Demons’ midfielder in 2023 as they seek a return to finals under new coach Peter German. Perth have also denied reports Sam Stubbs is unlikely to play for them in 2023, saying they’re off the mark. Stubbs has met with the club twice this week and is set to be at the club on Friday night after missing out on a spot on Fremantle’s list this year after training with them all summer. There were reports Stubbs did not want to play for Perth and even could play amateurs, but a Demons official shot them down and said the forward was committed to the club.

The post Again, Partey may miss Arsenal’s clash with Aston Villa appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.","content":"Arsenal Manager, Mikel Arteta, has not given a return date for Thomas Partey after the midfielder missed out on Arsenal’s defeat to Manchester City with an injury. The 29-year-old is now a major doubt to once again be unavailable for the Gunners’ 12:30pm clash at Aston Villa tomorrow – live on talkSPORT. Prior to Arsenal’s biggest game of the season, Partey was ruled out with a muscular problem on the day of the match. Partey, who was in attendance at the Emirates to cheer on his teammates, was replaced by January arrival Jorginho in the lone defensive midfield role. It was the first match that the Ghana international has been unavailable for since Arsenal‘s 3-1 defeat away at Manchester United in September. Speaking to Amazon Prime prior to kick-off, Arteta said of Partey: “It’s what happens in football. Players pick up injuries. “Unfortunately, Thomas felt something in his back muscle and he wasn’t available to play today.” And in his post-match press conference, the Spaniard declared he is unsure when the ex-Atletico Madrid man will be back ahead of the trip to Villa. Pressed for an update on his fitness, Arteta stated: “We don’t know. It’s what happens, it’s part of football. “I think Jorgi played a good game and we have to assess Tommy to see how bad it is.” Asked how late did he find out that Partey wouldn’t be able to play against City, Arteta remarked: “Very late. Very, very late.” A potential spell on the sidelines will be a huge blow for Arsenal, who are in somewhat of a mini-crisis having failed to win any of their last three Premier League games. They have now dropped down into second spot – level on points with City – though they do have a game in hand over Pep Guardiola’s men. Arteta’s side will have to get back to form to make sure they don’t lose ground on City with the goal difference the only thing separating the two. However, Arsenal do have an advantage if they can stay close to the Citizens as they still have a game in hand. Arsenal’s game in hand over Man City is at home to Everton on Wednesday, March 1. It will kick off at the Emirates at 7:45 p.m. The fixture was originally due to take place on Saturday, September 10 but was postponed due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. A win for the Gunners could potentially see them regain the advantage in the title race and move back to the top of the Premier League table. Although they could already be there if they are to better Man City’s results up until the game in hand is played, in which case, three points against Everton would move them further clear. However, they lost only their second game of the season to the Toffees in Sean Dyche’s first game in charge of the Merseyside club. So, despite the two teams battling at opposite ends of the table, the clash will definitely not be an easy one for Arteta’s men.

The 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which struck while people were sleeping last week, has claimed the lives of more than 41,000 people, according to the latest figures. Rescue missions are still ongoing - including for former Newcastle and Chelsea player Christian Atsu - but authorities have not revealed how many people are still missing. Trabzonspor announced before the Europa Conference League tie that all proceeds from the game will be donated to the victims. And as the players walked out into the Akyazi Stadium, fans unveiled a special tifo which depicted an emergency service worker rescuing a baby from the rubble.

It certainly was. Not only a throwback to Solskjaer’s unforgettable winner in the 1999 Champions League final victory over Bayern Munich here, but to the days when United and Barcelona were slugging it out for Europe’s biggest prize. These two clubs don’t do boring, not even in the Europa League. One of the greatest match-ups in football produced a spectacle befitting its top billing at a packed Nou Camp last night. Marcus Rashford lit up the old place. He was practically unplayable for periods in the second half. Rashford scored one – his 14th goal in the last 16 games – to bring United level in the second half and created another. Marcos Alonso got the hosts off to a strong start in the second period opening the scoring in the 50th minute of the match Marcus Rashford scored his fourth in as many games just two minutes later to draw the visitors back level An own goal from Jules Kounde then allowed the Red Devils to take the lead just nine minutes after having gone behind Raphinha equalised to make it 2-2 on 76 minutes to deny the visitors a crucial first leg win in the Europa League play-off On the eve of this game, Barca boss Xavi had described Rashford as one of Europe’s most dangerous strikers and he looked like it, playing in a central role that isn’t meant to bring out the best in him. Who says? He put United within 14 minutes of beating Barca for the first time ever here. Who knows how this game would have turned out had referee Maurizio Mariani sent off Jules Kounde for a challenge on Rashford when United were still 2-1 up? Contact was made outside the box so no penalty, but Kounde can count himself a lucky boy that the Italian official took no action at all. Having gone ahead through former Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso, Barcelona levelled with a goal from another player familiar to the Premier League, Raphinha, to leave this tie all square going into next week’s second leg at Old Trafford. What a first leg it was. End to end, blow for blow. Two of Europe’s greats going at it like there was a Champions League final at stake, not a place in the Europa League last 16. The 94,000 fans in the Nou Camp loved it. United will feel as though they should have headed home with an advantage over what is, to be fair, far from the greatest Barcelona team of all time. But by the end of a pulsating game, it was the Catalans who were looking more likely to score. United came here planning to attack, even though an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation didn’t necessarily look like it. Erik ten Hag’s side had Bruno Fernandes on the right and Jadon Sancho switching to the left with, even more strangely, 6ft 6in striker Wout Weghorst playing in midfield. ‘Tactical’, was Ten Hag’s explanation and it worked for the most part with Weghorst able to help stifle Frenkie de Jong and Franck Kessie in the middle. The in-form England star equalised for his side in the 52nd minute of the game to continue his own rich purple patch David de Gea was rooted to the spot anticipating a touch from start striker Robert Lewandowski from Raphinha's cross in The sun had barely dipped below the towering banks of the Nou Camp when we got underway, but you quickly forgot that this was a Europa League tie kicking off at 5.45pm in the UK.

Barcelona responded as David de Gea beat away an effort from Robert Lewandowski, and Alonso and Jordi Alba both fired over. United created the best chances before half-time, however, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen denying Weghorst and Rashford. If the first half was entertaining, the second was a belter. Barca went ahead in the 50th minute when former Leeds favourite Raphinha swung a corner towards the back post where Alonso had already taken up position after peeling away from Fred. The United midfielder had got his body shape all wrong and was facing the wrong way entirely by the time Alonso rose to plant a downward header past inside De Gea’s near post. United roared straight back and equalised just two minutes later. Fred atoned by slipping a pass in between Alba and Alonso, the latter chasing Rashford as he broke into the box. United’s in-form striker looked to have taken the ball too wide with his first touch, and a cross seemed like the better option. But Rashford is playing with so much confidence at the moment that he fancied his chances, and rifled a shot past Ter Stegen at his near post. The England man was instrumental again when United took the lead seven minutes later. Luke Shaw played a short corner to Rashford and, again, the easier option seemed to be to take the ball to the left, away from Raphinha. Instead, Rashford suddenly dipped to the right where there was almost no space and beat his man before racing along the byeline. He crossed to the edge of the six-yard box where Fernandes helped the ball on and Kounde bundled the ball over his own goal line. Erik ten Hag said before the game that he wanted his side to take Barcelona out of their 'comfort zone' at the Nou Camp more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Xavi plotting to nullify top talent Marcus Rashford Watch video Erik ten Hag and Luke Shaw speak ahead of Man U clash with Barcelona Watch video Xavi and Ten Hag react to thrilling encounter between Utd and Barcelona Watch video Sort Out Your Life team declutters and organises 'regular' home Watch video Video shows never-before seen Titanic footage of human dive in 1986 Watch video Robert Ballard speaks on 1986 Titanic Exploration Expedition dive Watch video Nicola dive expert: 'I would have changed my whole search strategy' Watch video Storm Otto: Met Office warns of strong winds of 70 mph to hit UK Watch video TikT-oker demonstrates tongue exercises she used for defined jaw Watch video Researchers claim Russia's war could push millions more into poverty Watch video Live cam captures birth of two rare tiger cubs at Chester zoo Watch video Woman tells Prue Leith how her parents chose their death However, this is a Barcelona side unbeaten in their last 17 games now and they weren’t done yet. When Casemiro played an uncharacteristically poor pass on the edge of his own box in the 746th minute, the ball was intercepted and played out to Raphinha. He whipped in a cross and the presence of Lewandowski only seemed to confuse United as the Pole failed to get a touch on the ball which flew through Raphael Varane’s legs and past De Gea. Casemiro almost went one better – or worse – when he directed the ball against his own post in the frantic, dying moments. So we head back to Old Trafford to do it all again next week. What a treat.

Rashford is full of confidence at present and the Manchester United star made a significant impact in the 2-2 draw with Barcelona in the Europa League as he scored and also played a major part in Jules Kounde 's own goal. So far this season Rashford has scored 22 goals for United, matching his best ever tally from the 2019-20 campaign. Asked on BT Sport whether Rashford is one of the best finishers in the world, United legend Scholes said: 'He is at this point. This season he's been absolutely brilliant. You'd like to see it over the next four or five years if he's going to get to the levels of the really top players in the world. 'But tonight to come to Barcelona to come to this stadium, great atmosphere. It was a bit wild there, that's probably one of his better chances, but his all round play, his ability to go past people, his movement, the goal. He's got the power to do that. His all round game at the moment is nothing short of brilliant.' Paul Scholes praised Marcus Rashford, describing his all-round game as 'absolutely brilliant' Manchester United legend Scholes agreed Rashford is one of the best finishers at present Another former United player, Owen Hargreaves, also spoke fondly of Rashford. Hargreaves stated that given the way in which he is playing, Rashford will feel that he can get the better of any defender at present. In addition, Hargreaves feels that Rashford is capable of having a significant impact in different positions. Hargreaves said: 'I like to see him in different positions. He loves running off the left, Ten Hag played him quite central today. All the goals came off the right hand side. If he's allowed to drift I don't think you can stop him. 'I don't think he looks at any defender and sees any fear. Kounde's a great athlete, Araujo's a terrific athlete, but Marcus I don't think he had any fear whoever was in front of him. If he's positive and runs forward, I think he thinks he can beat anyone right now.' Rashford was on the scoresheet again in United's 2-2 Europa League draw against Barcelona Owen Hargreaves believes that Rashford won't be fearful of facing any defender at present Rashford will hope to keep making a major impact for United until the end of the campaign as the club look to end their wait for a trophy. In addition to their involvement in the Europa League, United are through to the final of the Carabao Cup, where they will take on Newcastle, while they are home to West Ham in the FA Cup fifth round. They are currently third in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Manchester City.
