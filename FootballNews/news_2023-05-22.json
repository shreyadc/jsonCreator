Fresh from their third straight Premier League title win, City are set for a summer spending spree to keep the chasing pack at arm's length and continue their domestic dominance. Boss Pep Guardiola has identified the £60million-rated Argentina midfielder as the ideal replacement for Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva, both of whom are set to leave City this summer. And Guardiola could make it a double Seagulls swoop, with the City boss also said to be a huge admirer of Brighton's 19-year-old Paraguay sensation, Julio Enciso.

That list includes Mac Allister, 24, and Enciso, 19, as well as Bayern Munich's versatile midfielder Joshua Kimmich, 28, and RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol, 21, with Aymeric Laporte potentially on his way. Should Laporte go, Guardiola has identified Gvardiol as the ideal replacement, following an impressive season which saw him help Croatia reach the World Cup semi-finals in Qatar.

Anfield paid tribute to the four departing Reds stars following Saturday's 1-1 draw against Aston Villa, with Roberto Firmino, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, Naby Keita and James Milner all leaving when the campaign draws to a close. Firmino marked the occasion by scoring a late equaliser in the match having been brought on as a substitute by Jurgen Klopp during the second-half. After the match, the Brazilian was in tears before being joined by teammates in a guard of honour led by Henderson .

After the match, Henderson described his emotions following what had been an emotional occasion at Anfield. Henderson said: “It’s hard. They are all close to me so it was really difficult to stand and watch them come through the guard of honour, and receive the reception they did. So of course I’m going to miss them and the rest of the lads will, It’s pretty emotional for me and the team as well.\" Milner and Firmino each made over 300 appearances for Liverpool having joined before Klopp's arrival in 2015. Both players, alongside Henderson, have been part of a transformative period in the club's history with the weekend marking the end of an era as it bade farewell to two of its longest serving players. James Milner was given a guard of honour at his final home match for Liverpool on Saturday ( Image: (Photo by Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)) Firmino has yet to announce his next move, while Milner is expected to join Brighton next season . After the match, the 37-year-old echoed Henderson's emotional sentiments regarding the day's events. He said: “To be fair, I get more emotional talking about the (other) boys. I get more emotional when it's about other people. Milner continued: “It's been amazing how eight years has gone like that. It's been a special time and the stuff we've achieved together, the journey we've been on, what we managed to achieve. I wanted to come here and win trophies and have success. “I'm fortunate now that we've managed to achieve what we have and pretty much what you want to achieve when you come here.

He told the Press Association: \"A tremendous amount of value to the team. I think the manager said it perfectly in that we wouldn’t have achieved anything without Milly. \"He is such a big character and such a big leader within the team. It will definitely be strange not seeing him at Liverpool next season, he’s been incredible ever since he came to the club. \"He helped me a lot and other players around him and is probably taken for granted a little bit as a player from the outside but from the inside he has got so much respect from all of the players and all of the staff and we wish him all the very best in whatever his next chapter looks like.\" Liverpool are now expected to overhaul their midfield, with three of their most used options in the engine room departing.

Former Tottenham boss Pochettino is expected to appointed as Chelsea's next manager in the summer, succeeding Frank Lampard. The Blues are enduring a miserable campaign, as they are 12th in the Premier League and failed to compete in the cup competitions. Chelsea could still finish as low as 14th in the table if they lose their remaining Premier League games against Manchester United and Newcastle . Despite the club's woes, pundit Owen thinks Pochettino is the right manager for the Stamford Bridge job. Emma Hayes makes title admission as Chelsea edge towards WSL crown Lampard explains decision to pull Chukwuemeka out of England U20s squad Speaking to Premier League productions, Owen said: \"I think they will [finish in the top four next season]. The most important thing at that club is to get rid of players. You can never, ever have a squad of that much quality and have harmony.\" Chelsea have been the biggest spenders in Europe since Todd Boehly's consortium completed a takeover a year ago. Signings include Raheem Sterling , Kalidou Koulibaly, Noni Madueke, Marc Cucurrella, Benoit Badiashile, Mykhaylo Mudruk and Enzo Fernandez. Several players are expected to leave Chelsea this summer after Jorginho joined Arsenal in January. The likes of Mason Mount , Conor Gallagher , Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic and N'Golo Kante have been linked with other clubs.

Owen added: \"You’re constantly draining all your energy trying to keep 30 players happy. I think the main thing now is to get rid of half a dozen players, focus on a smaller pool, and I think they will do alright next season. \"It’s easier said than done... there’s some that will naturally go - whether that be due to age, not being good enough or coming up to the end of their contract.\" Chelsea's recruitment drive has backfired. The Blues replaced manager Thomas Tuchel with Graham Potter, who failed to get the best out of their inflated squad.

During his time at Tottenham, Pochettino guided them to the 2015 League Cup final and the 2019 Champions League final, losing to Chelsea and Liverpool respectively. They also finished second to Chelsea in the Premier League title race six years ago. Pochettino is a four-time Premier League Manager of the Month and won three trophies at PSG: the Ligue 1 title, the French Cup and the French Super Cup.

The Brazillian forward was subjected to brutal racism from fans in the stands who allegedly called him ‘monkey monkey’ in Spanish on Sunday during Real Madrid’s 1-0 defeat at Valencia . Following the development football club Real Madrid filed a criminal complaint Monday with Spanish prosecutors over the racist abuse its Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior received during a weekend La Liga match, calling it a \"hate crime\". The 22-year-old Brazilian winger faced off with home supporters and pointed directly to one after racist insults during the second half. Notably, Vinicius has frequently been singled out for racial abuse in La Liga and the latest incident came at Valencia's Mestalla stadium. \"Real Madrid strongly condemns the events that took place yesterday against our player Vinícius Junior,\" the Spanish giants said in a statement. The club said it belives the abuse \"constitutes a hate crime\" and had filed a complaint with the prosecutors' office \"in order for the facts to be investigated and for those responsible to be held accountable.\" Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said he heard monkey chants near the start of the game, while Los Blancos coach Carlo Ancelotti said there was “a racist atmosphere\" at Mestalla. Further, Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea spoke to stadium officials, who made an announcement calling for racist insults to stop before play resumed 10 minutes later. The referee wrote in his post-match report that a fan shouted \"monkey, monkey\" at the player “It was not the first time, not the second and not the third. Racism is normal in La Liga. The competition thinks it’s normal, the (Spanish) Federation also thinks it’s normal and opponents encourage it,\" Vinicius wrote on Instagram on Sunday. “The league that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano (Ronaldo) and (Leo) Mess i, now belongs to racists. “I’m sorry for the Spaniards who don’t agree, but today, in Brazil, Spain is known as a country of racists. Unfortunately, for everything that happens every week, I have no way of defending it. I agree.\" La Liga said they were investigating what happened at Mestalla and will take the appropriate legal action if a hate crime is detected.

Anfield paid tribute to the four departing Reds stars following Saturday's 1-1 draw against Aston Villa, with Roberto Firmino, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, Naby Keita and James Milner all leaving when the campaign draws to a close. Firmino marked the occasion by scoring a late equaliser in the match having been brought on as a substitute by Jurgen Klopp during the second-half. After the match, the Brazilian was in tears before being joined by teammates in a guard of honour led by Henderson .

After the match, Henderson described his emotions following what had been an emotional occasion at Anfield. Henderson said: “It’s hard. They are all close to me so it was really difficult to stand and watch them come through the guard of honour, and receive the reception they did. So of course I’m going to miss them and the rest of the lads will, It’s pretty emotional for me and the team as well.\" Milner and Firmino each made over 300 appearances for Liverpool having joined before Klopp's arrival in 2015. Both players, alongside Henderson, have been part of a transformative period in the club's history with the weekend marking the end of an era as it bade farewell to two of its longest serving players. James Milner was given a guard of honour at his final home match for Liverpool on Saturday ( Image: (Photo by Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)) Firmino has yet to announce his next move, while Milner is expected to join Brighton next season . After the match, the 37-year-old echoed Henderson's emotional sentiments regarding the day's events. He said: “To be fair, I get more emotional talking about the (other) boys. I get more emotional when it's about other people. Milner continued: “It's been amazing how eight years has gone like that. It's been a special time and the stuff we've achieved together, the journey we've been on, what we managed to achieve.

He told the Press Association: \"A tremendous amount of value to the team. I think the manager said it perfectly in that we wouldn’t have achieved anything without Milly. \"He is such a big character and such a big leader within the team. It will definitely be strange not seeing him at Liverpool next season, he’s been incredible ever since he came to the club. \"He helped me a lot and other players around him and is probably taken for granted a little bit as a player from the outside but from the inside he has got so much respect from all of the players and all of the staff and we wish him all the very best in whatever his next chapter looks like.\" Liverpool are now expected to overhaul their midfield, with three of their most used options in the engine room departing.

Former Tottenham boss Pochettino is expected to appointed as Chelsea's next manager in the summer, succeeding Frank Lampard. The Blues are enduring a miserable campaign, as they are 12th in the Premier League and failed to compete in the cup competitions. Chelsea could still finish as low as 14th in the table if they lose their remaining Premier League games against Manchester United and Newcastle . Despite the club's woes, pundit Owen thinks Pochettino is the right manager for the Stamford Bridge job. Emma Hayes makes title admission as Chelsea edge towards WSL crown Lampard explains decision to pull Chukwuemeka out of England U20s squad Speaking to Premier League productions, Owen said: \"I think they will [finish in the top four next season]. The most important thing at that club is to get rid of players. You can never, ever have a squad of that much quality and have harmony.\" Chelsea have been the biggest spenders in Europe since Todd Boehly's consortium completed a takeover a year ago. Signings include Raheem Sterling , Kalidou Koulibaly, Noni Madueke, Marc Cucurrella, Benoit Badiashile, Mykhaylo Mudruk and Enzo Fernandez. Several players are expected to leave Chelsea this summer after Jorginho joined Arsenal in January. The likes of Mason Mount , Conor Gallagher , Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic and N'Golo Kante have been linked with other clubs.

Owen added: \"You’re constantly draining all your energy trying to keep 30 players happy. I think the main thing now is to get rid of half a dozen players, focus on a smaller pool, and I think they will do alright next season. \"It’s easier said than done... there’s some that will naturally go - whether that be due to age, not being good enough or coming up to the end of their contract.\" Chelsea's recruitment drive has backfired. The Blues replaced manager Thomas Tuchel with Graham Potter, who failed to get the best out of their inflated squad.

During his time at Tottenham, Pochettino guided them to the 2015 League Cup final and the 2019 Champions League final, losing to Chelsea and Liverpool respectively. They also finished second to Chelsea in the Premier League title race six years ago. Pochettino is a four-time Premier League Manager of the Month and won three trophies at PSG: the Ligue 1 title, the French Cup and the French Super Cup.

Following the development football club Real Madrid filed a criminal complaint Monday with Spanish prosecutors over the racist abuse its Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior received during a weekend La Liga match, calling it a \"hate crime\". The 22-year-old Brazilian winger faced off with home supporters and pointed directly to one after racist insults during the second half. Notably, Vinicius has frequently been singled out for racial abuse in La Liga and the latest incident came at Valencia's Mestalla stadium. \"Real Madrid strongly condemns the events that took place yesterday against our player Vinícius Junior,\" the Spanish giants said in a statement. The club said it belives the abuse \"constitutes a hate crime\" and had filed a complaint with the prosecutors' office \"in order for the facts to be investigated and for those responsible to be held accountable.\" Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said he heard monkey chants near the start of the game, while Los Blancos coach Carlo Ancelotti said there was “a racist atmosphere\" at Mestalla. Further, Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea spoke to stadium officials, who made an announcement calling for racist insults to stop before play resumed 10 minutes later. The referee wrote in his post-match report that a fan shouted \"monkey, monkey\" at the player “It was not the first time, not the second and not the third. Racism is normal in La Liga. The competition thinks it’s normal, the (Spanish) Federation also thinks it’s normal and opponents encourage it,\" Vinicius wrote on Instagram on Sunday. “The league that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano (Ronaldo) and (Leo) Mess i, now belongs to racists. “I’m sorry for the Spaniards who don’t agree, but today, in Brazil, Spain is known as a country of racists. Unfortunately, for everything that happens every week, I have no way of defending it. I agree.\" La Liga said they were investigating what happened at Mestalla and will take the appropriate legal action if a hate crime is detected.

Anfield paid tribute to the four departing Reds stars following Saturday's 1-1 draw against Aston Villa, with Roberto Firmino, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, Naby Keita and James Milner all leaving when the campaign draws to a close. Firmino marked the occasion by scoring a late equaliser in the match having been brought on as a substitute by Jurgen Klopp during the second-half. After the match, the Brazilian was in tears before being joined by teammates in a guard of honour led by Henderson . Each departing player made their way through their gathered teammates before being presented with a parting gift by legendary former Reds player and manager Kenny Dalglish. Liverpool to appoint sporting director this week as two main transfer targets identified Jamie Carragher responds to Graeme Souness after tearful appearance on live TV Henderson has won multiple major honours alongside all four players, with the Champions League and Premier League titles in successive years being a particular highlight. After the match, Henderson described his emotions following what had been an emotional occasion at Anfield. Henderson said: “It’s hard. They are all close to me so it was really difficult to stand and watch them come through the guard of honour, and receive the reception they did. So of course I’m going to miss them and the rest of the lads will, It’s pretty emotional for me and the team as well.\" Milner and Firmino each made over 300 appearances for Liverpool having joined before Klopp's arrival in 2015. Both players, alongside Henderson, have been part of a transformative period in the club's history with the weekend marking the end of an era as it bade farewell to two of its longest serving players.

After the match, the 37-year-old echoed Henderson's emotional sentiments regarding the day's events. He said: “To be fair, I get more emotional talking about the (other) boys. I get more emotional when it's about other people. Milner continued: “It's been amazing how eight years has gone like that. It's been a special time and the stuff we've achieved together, the journey we've been on, what we managed to achieve. I wanted to come here and win trophies and have success. “I'm fortunate now that we've managed to achieve what we have and pretty much what you want to achieve when you come here. That doesn't happen too often, does it?” Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool transfer latest as 'deal agreed' for Brighton star Jurgen Klopp issued perfect response with verdict on Vinicius Jr racism scandal Earlier this month, Henderson paid tribute to Milner specifically , explaining the often unsung midfielder's role in the club's recent success. He told the Press Association: \"A tremendous amount of value to the team. I think the manager said it perfectly in that we wouldn’t have achieved anything without Milly. \"He is such a big character and such a big leader within the team. It will definitely be strange not seeing him at Liverpool next season, he’s been incredible ever since he came to the club. \"He helped me a lot and other players around him and is probably taken for granted a little bit as a player from the outside but from the inside he has got so much respect from all of the players and all of the staff and we wish him all the very best in whatever his next chapter looks like.\" Liverpool are now expected to overhaul their midfield, with three of their most used options in the engine room departing. Alexis Mac Allister of Brighton could well be the first addition, with a potential £70 million transfer for the World Cup winner reported to be close to completion.","pubDate":"2023-05-22 15:53:08","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30045742.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-1491773966.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Michael Owen predicts how Chelsea will fare next season under Mauricio Pochettino","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-next-manager-pochettino-predictions-30044842","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Tom Blow)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chelsea could still finish as low as 14th in the Premier League table this season after struggling under Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter, Bruno Saltor and now Frank Lampard","content":"Michael Owen believes Chelsea will finish in the top four of the Premier League under Mauricio Pochettino next season. Former Tottenham boss Pochettino is expected to appointed as Chelsea's next manager in the summer, succeeding Frank Lampard. The Blues are enduring a miserable campaign, as they are 12th in the Premier League and failed to compete in the cup competitions. Chelsea could still finish as low as 14th in the table if they lose their remaining Premier League games against Manchester United and Newcastle . Despite the club's woes, pundit Owen thinks Pochettino is the right manager for the Stamford Bridge job. Emma Hayes makes title admission as Chelsea edge towards WSL crown Lampard explains decision to pull Chukwuemeka out of England U20s squad Speaking to Premier League productions, Owen said: \"I think they will [finish in the top four next season]. The most important thing at that club is to get rid of players. You can never, ever have a squad of that much quality and have harmony.\" Chelsea have been the biggest spenders in Europe since Todd Boehly's consortium completed a takeover a year ago. Signings include Raheem Sterling , Kalidou Koulibaly, Noni Madueke, Marc Cucurrella, Benoit Badiashile, Mykhaylo Mudruk and Enzo Fernandez. Several players are expected to leave Chelsea this summer after Jorginho joined Arsenal in January. The likes of Mason Mount , Conor Gallagher , Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic and N'Golo Kante have been linked with other clubs.

Owen added: \"You’re constantly draining all your energy trying to keep 30 players happy. I think the main thing now is to get rid of half a dozen players, focus on a smaller pool, and I think they will do alright next season. \"It’s easier said than done... there’s some that will naturally go - whether that be due to age, not being good enough or coming up to the end of their contract.\" Chelsea's recruitment drive has backfired. The Blues replaced manager Thomas Tuchel with Graham Potter, who failed to get the best out of their inflated squad. Lampard was re-appointed on a caretaker basis last month but has won just one game. 5 talking points as Man City assert title dominance in win over Chelsea 6 talking points as Chelsea close to fourth straight WSL title with Arsenal win Pochettino has been out of work since leaving Paris Saint-Germain a year ago. The Argentine is one of the most respected managers in Europe after spells with Espanyol, Southampton , Tottenham and PSG - although his Spurs links will alarm some Chelsea fans. During his time at Tottenham, Pochettino guided them to the 2015 League Cup final and the 2019 Champions League final, losing to Chelsea and Liverpool respectively. They also finished second to Chelsea in the Premier League title race six years ago. Pochettino is a four-time Premier League Manager of the Month and won three trophies at PSG: the Ligue 1 title, the French Cup and the French Super Cup. He will need to be successful at Chelsea after the club's toughest season in a generation.","pubDate":"2023-05-22 15:24:32","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article30045419.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Screenshot-2023-05-22-160936.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Real Madrid lodges complaint as Vinícius Jr faces racism during Spanish La Liga match","link":"https://www.livemint.com/sports/football-news/real-madrid-lodges-complaint-as-vin-cius-jr-says-la-liga-belonged-to-cristiano-ronaldo-and-leo-messi-now-is-racist-11684762061145.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The league that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano (Ronaldo) and (Leo) Messi, now belongs to racists: Vinícius Jr wrote on his Instagram profile","content":"Vinicius Junior faced vile racial abuse during the Spanish La Liga match over the weekend. The Real Madrid's Brazilian forward took to Istagram to say La Liga “belonged to Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, now it belongs to racists\". The Brazillian forward was subjected to brutal racism from fans in the stands who allegedly called him ‘monkey monkey’ in Spanish on Sunday during Real Madrid’s 1-0 defeat at Valencia . Following the development football club Real Madrid filed a criminal complaint Monday with Spanish prosecutors over the racist abuse its Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior received during a weekend La Liga match, calling it a \"hate crime\". The 22-year-old Brazilian winger faced off with home supporters and pointed directly to one after racist insults during the second half. Notably, Vinicius has frequently been singled out for racial abuse in La Liga and the latest incident came at Valencia's Mestalla stadium. \"Real Madrid strongly condemns the events that took place yesterday against our player Vinícius Junior,\" the Spanish giants said in a statement. The club said it belives the abuse \"constitutes a hate crime\" and had filed a complaint with the prosecutors' office \"in order for the facts to be investigated and for those responsible to be held accountable.\" Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said he heard monkey chants near the start of the game, while Los Blancos coach Carlo Ancelotti said there was “a racist atmosphere\" at Mestalla. Further, Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea spoke to stadium officials, who made an announcement calling for racist insults to stop before play resumed 10 minutes later. The referee wrote in his post-match report that a fan shouted \"monkey, monkey\" at the player “It was not the first time, not the second and not the third. Racism is normal in La Liga. The competition thinks it’s normal, the (Spanish) Federation also thinks it’s normal and opponents encourage it,\" Vinicius wrote on Instagram on Sunday. “The league that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano (Ronaldo) and (Leo) Mess i, now belongs to racists. “I’m sorry for the Spaniards who don’t agree, but today, in Brazil, Spain is known as a country of racists. Unfortunately, for everything that happens every week, I have no way of defending it. I agree.\" La Liga said they were investigating what happened at Mestalla and will take the appropriate legal action if a hate crime is detected. The Brazilian football federation (CBF) president Ednaldo Rodrigues also criticised the incident. (With agency inputs) Catch all the Sports News and Updates on Live Mint.
