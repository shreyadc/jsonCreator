Vendredi, et la qualification pour les demi-finales, a fini la tête dans un panier dans le vestiaire alors qu'elle venait de marquer son quatrième but de la compétition et d'être désignée pour la troisième fois meilleure joueuse du match. Cela n'a vraiment pas eu l'air de déplaire à Ilestedt, qui vit une Coupe du monde - sa troisième après 2015 et 2019 - féerique. Avec ses quatre buts aux antipodes, plus qu'en deux saisons complètes avec Paris (3), la défenseuse de 30 ans est déjà entrée dans l'histoire du football suédois en égalant la marque de la légendaire Pia Sundhage (4 en 1991), étant seulement devancée par Lena Videkull (5 buts en 1991).

Not that there's anything wrong with the young Liverpool midfielder. Far from it, in fact. Instead, the issue now is how the can best accelerate the development of the prodigiously-talented 18-year-old given his progress is, on this evidence, already starting to overtake under-21 level. Certainly, Clark was by some distance the game's star performer, particularly during a first half in which his combinations down the left flank with winger James Norris and full-back Calum Scanlon caused Everton constant problems. Whenever the midfielder gained possession, there was buzz of anticipation among the Academy crowd, the teenager effortlessly jinking away from players, probing relentlessly and striking the crossbar first half. It was inevitable he'd be the creator for Liverpool's game-breaking first for Mateusz Musialowski before assisting substitute Tom Hill and rattling in the goal his performance merited. With Clark having grabbed his opportunity in the summer with the first team - not least when scoring in the 4-0 romp over Leicester City in Singapore - Liverpool must now decide whether his immediate career is best served remaining in and around the senior set-up or with a loan to perhaps a Championship club. Chances for minutes will surely come in the coming months, with the Reds hardly over-stocked with midfield options. The League Cup and Europa League appear ready-made for Clark to stake his claim. But wherever he ends up, the Liverpool youngster is very much one to keep an eye on. The relief from Musialowski at scoring the opener was almost tangible. Taking Clark's pass, the Poland U21 international showed great composure to calmly evade Everton goalkeeper Billy Crellin and roll the ball home seven minutes after the break. It atoned for an earlier aberration when, after an umpteenth Liverpool forward raid of a one-sided first half, the 19-year-old was teed up by Luca Stephenson for what appeared a straightforward finish, only to smash his shot well over the crossbar. Musialowski later provided an assist for a rampaging Terence Miles to put the Reds 2-0 up and appeared far more buoyed following his goal. This is likely to be a pivotal campaign for the winger, who burst on to the scene with the U18s three years ago but, due to injury and loss of form, experienced an underwhelming last campaign with the U21s. It may not, however, necessarily be at Liverpool, Musialowski one of several starters here who could well depart on loan come the end of the transfer window. Liverpool U21s coach Barry Lewtas is unlikely to be able to select such a strong starting line-up many times this season. Oakley Cannonier was another former U18 star who had his previous Premier League 2 campaign hampered by injury. Indeed, this was only a second start in the competition for the 19-year-old, who hit the woodwork in a lively first-half showing. The number six has been very much on the minds of Liverpool supporters in recent weeks, such have been the ongoing forlorn attempts to recruit in that position. It prompted Jurgen Klopp to try a number of different alternatives in defensive midfield during pre-season, including 18-year-old James McConnell in an unaccustomed role. While usually a more progressive player, the teenager impressed significantly in the deeper position to earn the plaudits of the Reds boss and began the mini-derby there, with captain Stephenson pushed further forward. One crunching first-half challenge sparked a move which ended with Clark having a shot saved, and showcased the aggression that had so enthused Klopp in Germany and Singapore. Liverpool's territorial dominance, though, meant McConnell's defensive capabilities were rarely called upon. But an unexpected new route to more first-team opportunities may now have opened.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27344266.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_GettyImages-1548950843.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Enzo Fernandez has exposed major Liverpool flaw that will leave Jurgen Klopp scared","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/enzo-fernandez-exposed-major-liverpool-27519708","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"John Aldridge reflects on Sunday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea in part two of his weekly Liverpool column","content":"On reflection, a point at Chelsea was a fair result on Sunday afternoon. There were some good things going forward from , but we can do better. I think we played Chelsea at a good time, with Pochettino still trying to find his best team and starting system, and we didn’t take advantage of that. Having said that, we could potentially have come away with all three points had the penalty decision gone our way. Why the handball from Nicolas Jackson didn’t go to VAR, I have no idea. Whether Jackson meant it or not, it has hit his hand. It’s clear. To go over to the monitor doesn’t mean you have to change your original decision, but at least go and take a look. One concerning statistic from Sunday's game was the fact we ended the afternoon with just 35.1% possession. There have only been three other occasions whereby we have recorded a lower figure in a Premier League game during Klopp's reign, and two of them were against Manchester City. That statistic alone tells you all you need to know about Liverpool’s need for a defensive midfielder and control in this area of the pitch. Jurgen Klopp knows, the staff know and the fans know it’s what we’re crying out for. Mac Allister had a good game, but was playing in a role that is not his favoured position. Players taking on the responsibility of being the No.6 are the ones who constantly win second balls, which we saw Enzo Fernandez doing all game for Chelsea. Szoboszlai also put in a good shift, but you need someone to do the donkey work. Klopp was criticised for taking off Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz for Ben Doak and Harvey Elliott as we searched for a winning goal at Stamford Bridge, but I thought he was spot on with his subs. When Elliott and Doak came on, there was a noticeable difference to our play. We were quicker and looked more likely to score. Elliott had a really good pre-season and looks like he is starting to come on to the next stage. As for Doak, there will be some games where he can earn Liverpool a lot of points by coming on as a sub. He is a fly up the wall and something defenders can’t handle. Whether Salah goes off or goes to centre-forward, Doak has to have more game time this season because he could be a superstar in the making. Salah was visibly frustrated over his substitution, but no player should be guaranteed 90 minutes every game. You cannot play to your full potential every game and be the star. He was tired and the manager was right to take him off. As for Salah’s reaction to being subbed, plenty has been said about it. It’s good that he doesn’t want to come off but, in the future, just take it. You don’t have to come off smiling, though, that’s fine.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27519734.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_EnzoKlopp.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton could get new nickname as transfer frustration continues","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-could-new-nickname-transfer-27519606","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Ball tackles the big issues at Goodison Park after Everton's 1-0 defeat to Fulham in their opening game of the new Premier League season","content":"Jack Harrison is the latest new face through the door at Goodison Park – after our latest dose of drama – but Evertonians are frustrated that we haven’t brought in transfers earlier. It’s been obvious what positions we’re short on and it should have been done and dusted very early on in the summer but then I look round at other clubs and many of them are still trying to bring in their targets. Why was Harry Kane’s transfer left so late? That could have been done over a month ago. Look at Chelsea and the Moises Caicedo situation, that’s only getting done now after months of interest and Chelsea not wanting to pay £100million for him in January and now having to splash out £115million. Even our neighbours, they brought in Alexis Mac Allister early on but now they’re scrambling around – having tried to hijack Caicedo’s Chelsea move – chasing another midfielder. We know how agents and football clubs often work, wanting to build up interest in these players that are worth fighting for. At this moment in time, unfortunately aren’t a team who seem to be the most attractive proposition because we’ve struggled for the past couple of seasons and nobody seems to know what’s going on upstairs. The top of the club appears to have been a state of disarray for a long time now and potential signings are going to want answers to questions about these things and if they’ve got another option then they’re probably going to sidestep us. Look what happened with first time around when we were managerless. If someone goes for a medical but then has the chance to go and sign for another club, that tells me that not all is well. As Evertonians, I think we’ve got to strap ourselves in for more bumpy rides as I think there are still plenty of more twists and turns to come before the end of the transfer window. We’re getting called Interested Party FC as we’re potentially in the market for a whole host of players. In many ways it’s like moving house and you’re stuck in a chain, waiting for certain scenarios to happen and every party involved is trying to get the best deal for them.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27519625.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1609908503.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women’s World Cup: Confident Matildas say they’re ‘right where we belong’ as they hit training track","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/fifa-women-s-world-cup/womens-world-cup-confident-matildas-say-theyre-right-where-we-belong-as-they-hit-training-track-c-11594854","keywords":null,"creator":["Anna Harrington"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Matildas finally believe they belong at the pointy end of the Women’s World Cup as they go through their final preparations ahead of facing England for a place in the final.","content":"The Matildas finally believe they belong at the pointy end of the Women’s World Cup as they go through their final preparations ahead of facing England for a place in the final. Australia have experienced an up-and-down journey throughout Tony Gustavsson’s tenure as head coach, which began in September 2020. But everything is falling into place ahead of Wednesday’s blockbuster semi-final at Stadium Australia - against an England team the Matildas beat in a friendly just four months ago. “It’s been in the pipeline for the last two years,” midfielder Tameka Yallop said. “We went through not necessarily a rebuilding stage but an adjustment stage with a new coach. “But we’ve always had these core players, we’ve always had this talent, and right now everything is coming together and we do feel like we are playing the best football that we’ve ever played together. “We’ve got so much belief within this team that we do feel we’re right where we belong.” The Matildas have been in a major semi-final before, falling heartbreakingly short when losing 1-0 to Sweden at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. But this occasion, on home soil, is on another level. “The Olympics is the Olympics and it’s absolutely amazing,” Yallop said. “Then we step away from that and you train for four years as well waiting for this World Cup. “And in football, the World Cup, it’s the pinnacle. For it to be at home as well, this will probably be the biggest game in all of our careers and all of our lifetime of playing football. “So this game is on its own little platform.” The Matildas have taken plenty of heart from their extraordinary 7-6 penalty shoot-out win over France in the quarter-finals, showing a new-found grit. Saturday’s shoot-out was seven years to the day since Australia’s heartbreaking loss to Brazil in the same manner at the Rio Olympics. “We’ve always been capable of (reaching the highest levels),” Yallop said. “We’ve always had the skill set and the talent to do it. “We’ve just built an amazing environment right now within our team that we all feel so supported and so united in what we’re doing and the journey that we’re on, that there isn’t really any other option.” Jackson Barrett Recovery has been a key part of Australia’s success, with several players featuring in every, or almost every, minute of the tournament to date, including midfield duo Katrina Gorry and Kyra Cooney-Cross. “They do this kind of stuff week in and week out,” Yallop said. “It is a shorter turnaround, but it’s also - you’ve got all that extra motivation, drive and just that win to play for that means so much more than your club games week in and week out. “The whole team is capable of running, and we do really focus on recovery as well. That goes a long way.” Every player bar forward Kyah Simon (knee) hit the track in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah on Tuesday morning.

Doubt him at your peril.","content":"When his bosses made Robert O’Brien ride shotgun to the corner of politics and nepotism, the Broomfield football coach took one glance at the neighborhood and did the only thing he could. He jumped from the dang car. “I was removed for benching a quarterback who was the athletic director’s nephew,” O’Brien explained to me Monday at Empower Field, “and the district athletic director’s son.” This was back at Citrus High School in Inverness, Fla., during the fall of 2019. His first autumn as a prep head coach. Oh, and did we mention that his team was 8-1 over Coach OB’s first nine games when he was … Or that Citrus was cruising to its first playoff berth in six years? Or the ’Canes’ stellar record of 13-25 in the four seasons before O’Brien showed up? “I was asked to move to a middle school 30 minutes away,” the first-year Eagles coach continued. “They said that if I wanted to stay in the district and stay in Florida, that was going to be the move.” Instead, O’Brien Fans and justifiably. An online petition at Change.org calling for his reinstatement Somebody else coached the playoff game. Which, of course, Citrus lost by 22 points. The ’Canes haven’t sniffed the postseason since. “Welcome to Central Florida,” O’Brien chuckled. The man’s 37 going on 62. Doubt him at your peril. Whereas Dave Logan turned up to CHSAA fall sports media day and towered over peers in terms of height and gravitas, O’Brien, with his cool demeanor and mop of dark, curly hair, looked like one of the dudes. The guy charged with defending the Eagles’ 4A state title cracked wise with his players at Empower Field with a vibe that felt more like an older brother than grizzled mentor. “(He’s) honestly amazing,” offered Broomfield senior tackle Landen Davidson, a 308-pound who’s built like one of those . “And I feel like I can connect with (O’Brien) very well and I can tell him things and create that deeper bond with him. I really appreciate that going into my senior season. I need it.” The Eagles need a little serenity. Their state-championship QB from last fall, Cole LaCrue, Their state-championship coach from last fall, Blair Hubbard, was placed on administrative leave and last spring “Our team (had) kind of found out from the school,” senior defensive back Brent Harris said of Hubbard’s departure. “And we were all just surprised. And just didn’t know what was coming next.” Up next was O’Brien, a Louisville native who’d played at Monarch and was Hubbard’s defensive coordinator from 2016-18, having helped lead the Eagles to the state title game during his first season on the staff. “Building (Broomfield football) from ’16 to ’18 was something that we felt like I was a part of,” O’Brien said. “So it was pretty easy to jump back in and say, ‘We’ve built this (program) — it wasn’t just one guy. We as a program, as a staff, as a community, we built this.’ So it was pretty easy to make that transition.” So far, O’Brien — Davidson and Harris call him “Coach OB” — has managed to find the sweet spot between the familiar and the fresh. Most of the coaching staff is back. The upperclassmen have made it clear that the plan is to pick things up right where they left off, even going so far as to , BoCo’s other 4A beast, during a Monday news conference. “I think any time there’s going to be coaching change, there’s going to be challenges. Any time that a great coach leaves a program with a lot of success, there (are) going to be some differences,” O’Brien continued. “Have we worked through some of those things? Absolutely. Will there be more things that come up? I’m sure there will. But we’ve got a phenomenal group of coaches. We’ve got a phenomenal administration. We’ve got wonderful student-athletes and the parental support has been absolutely unbelievable.” And while Coach OB declined to get into specifics about what he and Hubbard have talked about since the former was hired, it can’t be any more awkward than the situation in Florida four years ago. “I’m not going to lie to you: a lot of prayer went into that,” O’Brien recalled. “It was a really difficult time. I leaned on my faith more so in that moment that I ever have in my entire life. And it brought me back to coaching. “And I still am in contact with a lot of those kids and a lot of the players from down there in Florida. As hard as it was, it was also a special experience for me to be able to develop those relationships and do some things that they had never done, (such as) having a winning season … Central Florida football is no joke.” Neither is he. “I’m that (BoCo) neighborhood type of kid,” he laughed. “And I know what that neighborhood type of kid is — hard-nosed, blue-collar, a little angry at times, a little physical, a little tough. And that’s the type of football that we play.” The year after he was run out of town, Citrus went 1-7. Since the fall of ’20, the Hurricanes are 5-23. Robert O’Brien, meanwhile, is settling into the driver’s seat from a mile high. And climbing.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 02:40:49","image_url":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TDP-L-BROOM-LOVELAND-CHAMPIONSHIP-7.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"denverpost","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Alex Collins, former Seahawks and Ravens running back, dies at age 28","link":"http://vancouversun.com/pmn/news-pmn/alex-collins-former-seahawks-and-ravens-running-back-dies-at-age-28/wcm/2484271f-8e36-4c37-87bb-ec3c3ff4e7a3","keywords":["Football","NFL","Sports"],"creator":["Mike Raptis"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Seahawks released a statement from Collins’ family Monday night","content":"Article content OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Former NFL running back Alex Collins, who played five seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens, was killed in a motorcycle crash in South Florida, authorities said. He was 28. Collins was driving a motorcycle that crashed into a sport-utility vehicle Sunday night in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Article content Article content The SUV was making a left turn when Collins’ motorcycle hit its rear passenger side. The impact caused Collins to go through a window of the SUV and come to rest inside the vehicle, the sheriff’s office said. Collins was pronounced dead at the scene. The SUV driver, whose name was withheld, remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators, authorities said. The Seahawks released a statement from Collins’ family Monday night “Alex was cherished by his family and friends as well as supporters from all around the world. All who truly know him can attest to his drive, determination, and larger-than-life personality,” the statement said. “We kindly request your thoughts and prayers for our family during this difficult time.” Collins played in college at Arkansas, where he rushed for over 1,000 yards in all three of his seasons. He’s second to Darren McFadden on the school’s career rushing list, and he was part of one of the most memorable plays in recent SEC history in 2015 at Mississippi. The Razorbacks were down by seven in overtime and faced fourth-and-25. Brandon Allen’s pass was complete to Hunter Henry, who was about to be tackled near the sideline, well short of the line to gain. Henry desperately flung the ball backwards toward the middle of the field. The ball bounced to Collins, who took off toward the other sideline and got the first down.

He was a legendary Razorback and an even better person,” the Arkansas football account posted on social media. “His love for the Razorbacks and desire to be a Hog was undeniable. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.” Collins played three seasons for the Seahawks and two for the Ravens. He rushed for 973 yards for Baltimore in 2017. “Alex was a joy to be around and someone whose light shined brightly,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement. “I’ll always remember him for being a great teammate who had an uplifting spirit that impacted everyone he encountered. He was also a smart player who ran with unlimited determination, and he contributed to a lot of our success during his time in Baltimore.” Collins played this year for the Memphis Showboats of the USFL. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Article content Share this article in your social network","pubDate":"2023-08-15 02:30:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"vancouversun","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Michael Oher, former NFL tackle known for 'The Blind Side,' sues to end Tuohys' conservatorship","link":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/08/15/sports/michael-oher-former-nfl-tackle-known-for-the-blind-side-sues-to-end-tuohys-conservatorship/1905448","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"NASHVILLE, Tennesse: Michael Oher, the former NFL tackle known for being the inspiration for the movie \"The Blind Side,\" filed a petition Monday in a Tennessee probate court accusing Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy of lying to by having him sign papers making them his conservators rather than his adoptive parents nearly two decades ago.In the petition filed Monday in Shelby County Probate Court, Oher asks for the conservatorship to be terminated along with asking for a full accounting of the money earned off the use of his name and story.

Cela n'a vraiment pas eu l'air de déplaire à Ilestedt, qui vit une Coupe du monde - sa troisième après 2015 et 2019 - féerique. Avec ses quatre buts aux antipodes, plus qu'en deux saisons complètes avec Paris (3), la défenseuse de 30 ans est déjà entrée dans l'histoire du football suédois en égalant la marque de la légendaire Pia Sundhage (4 en 1991), étant seulement devancée par Lena Videkull (5 buts en 1991).

Elle est, par exemple, la joueuse suédoise ayant parcouru le plus de kilomètres (40). Recrutée peu avant le Mondial par Arsenal pour pallier la blessure de Leah Williamson (genou) et le départ de Rafaelle Souza (vers Orlando), elle forme en sélection une charnière solide aux côtés de l'expérimentée Magdalena Eriksson : depuis le début de la compétition, la Suède n'a encaissé que deux buts et reste sur trois clean-sheets en cinq matches. ce mardin matin à Auckland, le défi paraît immense puisqu'il faudra franchir Ilestedt dans une surface et l'empêcher de marquer dans l'autre.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://medias.lequipe.fr/img-photo-jpg/amanda-ilestedt-lors-du-match-japon-suede-1-2-en-quarts-de-finale-du-mondial-vendredi-a-auckland-michael-bradley-afp/1500000001820868/0:0,1998:1332-665-335-70/b5d89.jpg","source_id":"lequipe","category":["sports"],"country":["france"],"language":"french"},{"title":"Liverpool transfer news LIVE - Romeo Lavia blow, Aurelien Tchouameni interest, Tyler Adams release clause met","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-transfer-news-live-lavia-27521639","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Liverpool transfer news, rumours, gossip and speculation including the latest on Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia, Aurelien Tchouameni and more","content":"Hello and welcome to our dedicated Liverpool live blog for Tuesday, August 15.

Not that there's anything wrong with the young Liverpool midfielder. Far from it, in fact. Instead, the issue now is how the can best accelerate the development of the prodigiously-talented 18-year-old given his progress is, on this evidence, already starting to overtake under-21 level. Certainly, Clark was by some distance the game's star performer, particularly during a first half in which his combinations down the left flank with winger James Norris and full-back Calum Scanlon caused Everton constant problems. Whenever the midfielder gained possession, there was buzz of anticipation among the Academy crowd, the teenager effortlessly jinking away from players, probing relentlessly and striking the crossbar first half. It was inevitable he'd be the creator for Liverpool's game-breaking first for Mateusz Musialowski before assisting substitute Tom Hill and rattling in the goal his performance merited. With Clark having grabbed his opportunity in the summer with the first team - not least when scoring in the 4-0 romp over Leicester City in Singapore - Liverpool must now decide whether his immediate career is best served remaining in and around the senior set-up or with a loan to perhaps a Championship club. Chances for minutes will surely come in the coming months, with the Reds hardly over-stocked with midfield options. The League Cup and Europa League appear ready-made for Clark to stake his claim. But wherever he ends up, the Liverpool youngster is very much one to keep an eye on. The relief from Musialowski at scoring the opener was almost tangible. Taking Clark's pass, the Poland U21 international showed great composure to calmly evade Everton goalkeeper Billy Crellin and roll the ball home seven minutes after the break. It atoned for an earlier aberration when, after an umpteenth Liverpool forward raid of a one-sided first half, the 19-year-old was teed up by Luca Stephenson for what appeared a straightforward finish, only to smash his shot well over the crossbar. Musialowski later provided an assist for a rampaging Terence Miles to put the Reds 2-0 up and appeared far more buoyed following his goal. This is likely to be a pivotal campaign for the winger, who burst on to the scene with the U18s three years ago but, due to injury and loss of form, experienced an underwhelming last campaign with the U21s. It may not, however, necessarily be at Liverpool, Musialowski one of several starters here who could well depart on loan come the end of the transfer window. Liverpool U21s coach Barry Lewtas is unlikely to be able to select such a strong starting line-up many times this season. Oakley Cannonier was another former U18 star who had his previous Premier League 2 campaign hampered by injury. Indeed, this was only a second start in the competition for the 19-year-old, who hit the woodwork in a lively first-half showing. The number six has been very much on the minds of Liverpool supporters in recent weeks, such have been the ongoing forlorn attempts to recruit in that position. It prompted Jurgen Klopp to try a number of different alternatives in defensive midfield during pre-season, including 18-year-old James McConnell in an unaccustomed role. While usually a more progressive player, the teenager impressed significantly in the deeper position to earn the plaudits of the Reds boss and began the mini-derby there, with captain Stephenson pushed further forward. One crunching first-half challenge sparked a move which ended with Clark having a shot saved, and showcased the aggression that had so enthused Klopp in Germany and Singapore. Liverpool's territorial dominance, though, meant McConnell's defensive capabilities were rarely called upon. But an unexpected new route to more first-team opportunities may now have opened.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27344266.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_GettyImages-1548950843.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Enzo Fernandez has exposed major Liverpool flaw that will leave Jurgen Klopp scared","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/enzo-fernandez-exposed-major-liverpool-27519708","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"John Aldridge reflects on Sunday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea in part two of his weekly Liverpool column","content":"On reflection, a point at Chelsea was a fair result on Sunday afternoon. There were some good things going forward from , but we can do better. I think we played Chelsea at a good time, with Pochettino still trying to find his best team and starting system, and we didn’t take advantage of that. Having said that, we could potentially have come away with all three points had the penalty decision gone our way. Why the handball from Nicolas Jackson didn’t go to VAR, I have no idea. Whether Jackson meant it or not, it has hit his hand. It’s clear. To go over to the monitor doesn’t mean you have to change your original decision, but at least go and take a look. One concerning statistic from Sunday's game was the fact we ended the afternoon with just 35.1% possession. There have only been three other occasions whereby we have recorded a lower figure in a Premier League game during Klopp's reign, and two of them were against Manchester City. That statistic alone tells you all you need to know about Liverpool’s need for a defensive midfielder and control in this area of the pitch. Jurgen Klopp knows, the staff know and the fans know it’s what we’re crying out for. Mac Allister had a good game, but was playing in a role that is not his favoured position. Players taking on the responsibility of being the No.6 are the ones who constantly win second balls, which we saw Enzo Fernandez doing all game for Chelsea. Szoboszlai also put in a good shift, but you need someone to do the donkey work. Klopp was criticised for taking off Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz for Ben Doak and Harvey Elliott as we searched for a winning goal at Stamford Bridge, but I thought he was spot on with his subs. When Elliott and Doak came on, there was a noticeable difference to our play. We were quicker and looked more likely to score. Elliott had a really good pre-season and looks like he is starting to come on to the next stage. As for Doak, there will be some games where he can earn Liverpool a lot of points by coming on as a sub. He is a fly up the wall and something defenders can’t handle. Whether Salah goes off or goes to centre-forward, Doak has to have more game time this season because he could be a superstar in the making. Salah was visibly frustrated over his substitution, but no player should be guaranteed 90 minutes every game. You cannot play to your full potential every game and be the star. He was tired and the manager was right to take him off. As for Salah’s reaction to being subbed, plenty has been said about it. It’s good that he doesn’t want to come off but, in the future, just take it. You don’t have to come off smiling, though, that’s fine.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27519734.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_EnzoKlopp.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton could get new nickname as transfer frustration continues","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-could-new-nickname-transfer-27519606","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Ball tackles the big issues at Goodison Park after Everton's 1-0 defeat to Fulham in their opening game of the new Premier League season","content":"Jack Harrison is the latest new face through the door at Goodison Park – after our latest dose of drama – but Evertonians are frustrated that we haven’t brought in transfers earlier. It’s been obvious what positions we’re short on and it should have been done and dusted very early on in the summer but then I look round at other clubs and many of them are still trying to bring in their targets. Why was Harry Kane’s transfer left so late? That could have been done over a month ago. Look at Chelsea and the Moises Caicedo situation, that’s only getting done now after months of interest and Chelsea not wanting to pay £100million for him in January and now having to splash out £115million. Even our neighbours, they brought in Alexis Mac Allister early on but now they’re scrambling around – having tried to hijack Caicedo’s Chelsea move – chasing another midfielder. We know how agents and football clubs often work, wanting to build up interest in these players that are worth fighting for. At this moment in time, unfortunately aren’t a team who seem to be the most attractive proposition because we’ve struggled for the past couple of seasons and nobody seems to know what’s going on upstairs. The top of the club appears to have been a state of disarray for a long time now and potential signings are going to want answers to questions about these things and if they’ve got another option then they’re probably going to sidestep us. Look what happened with first time around when we were managerless. If someone goes for a medical but then has the chance to go and sign for another club, that tells me that not all is well. As Evertonians, I think we’ve got to strap ourselves in for more bumpy rides as I think there are still plenty of more twists and turns to come before the end of the transfer window. We’re getting called Interested Party FC as we’re potentially in the market for a whole host of players. In many ways it’s like moving house and you’re stuck in a chain, waiting for certain scenarios to happen and every party involved is trying to get the best deal for them.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27519625.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1609908503.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women’s World Cup: Confident Matildas say they’re ‘right where we belong’ as they hit training track","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/fifa-women-s-world-cup/womens-world-cup-confident-matildas-say-theyre-right-where-we-belong-as-they-hit-training-track-c-11594854","keywords":null,"creator":["Anna Harrington"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Matildas finally believe they belong at the pointy end of the Women’s World Cup as they go through their final preparations ahead of facing England for a place in the final.","content":"The Matildas finally believe they belong at the pointy end of the Women’s World Cup as they go through their final preparations ahead of facing England for a place in the final. Australia have experienced an up-and-down journey throughout Tony Gustavsson’s tenure as head coach, which began in September 2020. But everything is falling into place ahead of Wednesday’s blockbuster semi-final at Stadium Australia - against an England team the Matildas beat in a friendly just four months ago. “It’s been in the pipeline for the last two years,” midfielder Tameka Yallop said. “We went through not necessarily a rebuilding stage but an adjustment stage with a new coach. “But we’ve always had these core players, we’ve always had this talent, and right now everything is coming together and we do feel like we are playing the best football that we’ve ever played together. “We’ve got so much belief within this team that we do feel we’re right where we belong.” The Matildas have been in a major semi-final before, falling heartbreakingly short when losing 1-0 to Sweden at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. But this occasion, on home soil, is on another level. “The Olympics is the Olympics and it’s absolutely amazing,” Yallop said. “Then we step away from that and you train for four years as well waiting for this World Cup. “And in football, the World Cup, it’s the pinnacle. For it to be at home as well, this will probably be the biggest game in all of our careers and all of our lifetime of playing football. “So this game is on its own little platform.” The Matildas have taken plenty of heart from their extraordinary 7-6 penalty shoot-out win over France in the quarter-finals, showing a new-found grit. Saturday’s shoot-out was seven years to the day since Australia’s heartbreaking loss to Brazil in the same manner at the Rio Olympics. “We’ve always been capable of (reaching the highest levels),” Yallop said. “We’ve always had the skill set and the talent to do it. “We’ve just built an amazing environment right now within our team that we all feel so supported and so united in what we’re doing and the journey that we’re on, that there isn’t really any other option.” Jackson Barrett Recovery has been a key part of Australia’s success, with several players featuring in every, or almost every, minute of the tournament to date, including midfield duo Katrina Gorry and Kyra Cooney-Cross. “They do this kind of stuff week in and week out,” Yallop said. “It is a shorter turnaround, but it’s also - you’ve got all that extra motivation, drive and just that win to play for that means so much more than your club games week in and week out. “The whole team is capable of running, and we do really focus on recovery as well. That goes a long way.” Every player bar forward Kyah Simon (knee) hit the track in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah on Tuesday morning.

His first autumn as a prep head coach. Oh, and did we mention that his team was 8-1 over Coach OB’s first nine games when he was … Or that Citrus was cruising to its first playoff berth in six years? Or the ’Canes’ stellar record of 13-25 in the four seasons before O’Brien showed up? “I was asked to move to a middle school 30 minutes away,” the first-year Eagles coach continued. “They said that if I wanted to stay in the district and stay in Florida, that was going to be the move.” Instead, O’Brien Fans and justifiably. An online petition at Change.org calling for his reinstatement Somebody else coached the playoff game. Which, of course, Citrus lost by 22 points. The ’Canes haven’t sniffed the postseason since. “Welcome to Central Florida,” O’Brien chuckled. The man’s 37 going on 62. Doubt him at your peril. Whereas Dave Logan turned up to CHSAA fall sports media day and towered over peers in terms of height and gravitas, O’Brien, with his cool demeanor and mop of dark, curly hair, looked like one of the dudes. The guy charged with defending the Eagles’ 4A state title cracked wise with his players at Empower Field with a vibe that felt more like an older brother than grizzled mentor. “(He’s) honestly amazing,” offered Broomfield senior tackle Landen Davidson, a 308-pound who’s built like one of those . “And I feel like I can connect with (O’Brien) very well and I can tell him things and create that deeper bond with him. I really appreciate that going into my senior season. I need it.” The Eagles need a little serenity. Their state-championship QB from last fall, Cole LaCrue, Their state-championship coach from last fall, Blair Hubbard, was placed on administrative leave and last spring “Our team (had) kind of found out from the school,” senior defensive back Brent Harris said of Hubbard’s departure. “And we were all just surprised. And just didn’t know what was coming next.” Up next was O’Brien, a Louisville native who’d played at Monarch and was Hubbard’s defensive coordinator from 2016-18, having helped lead the Eagles to the state title game during his first season on the staff. “Building (Broomfield football) from ’16 to ’18 was something that we felt like I was a part of,” O’Brien said. “So it was pretty easy to jump back in and say, ‘We’ve built this (program) — it wasn’t just one guy. We as a program, as a staff, as a community, we built this.’ So it was pretty easy to make that transition.” So far, O’Brien — Davidson and Harris call him “Coach OB” — has managed to find the sweet spot between the familiar and the fresh. Most of the coaching staff is back. The upperclassmen have made it clear that the plan is to pick things up right where they left off, even going so far as to , BoCo’s other 4A beast, during a Monday news conference. “I think any time there’s going to be coaching change, there’s going to be challenges. Any time that a great coach leaves a program with a lot of success, there (are) going to be some differences,” O’Brien continued. “Have we worked through some of those things? Absolutely. Will there be more things that come up? I’m sure there will. But we’ve got a phenomenal group of coaches. We’ve got a phenomenal administration. We’ve got wonderful student-athletes and the parental support has been absolutely unbelievable.” And while Coach OB declined to get into specifics about what he and Hubbard have talked about since the former was hired, it can’t be any more awkward than the situation in Florida four years ago. “I’m not going to lie to you: a lot of prayer went into that,” O’Brien recalled. “It was a really difficult time. I leaned on my faith more so in that moment that I ever have in my entire life. And it brought me back to coaching. “And I still am in contact with a lot of those kids and a lot of the players from down there in Florida. As hard as it was, it was also a special experience for me to be able to develop those relationships and do some things that they had never done, (such as) having a winning season … Central Florida football is no joke.” Neither is he. “I’m that (BoCo) neighborhood type of kid,” he laughed. “And I know what that neighborhood type of kid is — hard-nosed, blue-collar, a little angry at times, a little physical, a little tough. And that’s the type of football that we play.” The year after he was run out of town, Citrus went 1-7. Since the fall of ’20, the Hurricanes are 5-23. Robert O’Brien, meanwhile, is settling into the driver’s seat from a mile high. And climbing.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 02:40:49","image_url":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TDP-L-BROOM-LOVELAND-CHAMPIONSHIP-7.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"denverpost","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Alex Collins, former Seahawks and Ravens running back, dies at age 28","link":"http://vancouversun.com/pmn/news-pmn/alex-collins-former-seahawks-and-ravens-running-back-dies-at-age-28/wcm/2484271f-8e36-4c37-87bb-ec3c3ff4e7a3","keywords":["Football","NFL","Sports"],"creator":["Mike Raptis"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Seahawks released a statement from Collins’ family Monday night","content":"Article content OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Former NFL running back Alex Collins, who played five seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens, was killed in a motorcycle crash in South Florida, authorities said. He was 28. Collins was driving a motorcycle that crashed into a sport-utility vehicle Sunday night in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Article content Article content The SUV was making a left turn when Collins’ motorcycle hit its rear passenger side. The impact caused Collins to go through a window of the SUV and come to rest inside the vehicle, the sheriff’s office said. Collins was pronounced dead at the scene. The SUV driver, whose name was withheld, remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators, authorities said. The Seahawks released a statement from Collins’ family Monday night “Alex was cherished by his family and friends as well as supporters from all around the world. All who truly know him can attest to his drive, determination, and larger-than-life personality,” the statement said. “We kindly request your thoughts and prayers for our family during this difficult time.” Collins played in college at Arkansas, where he rushed for over 1,000 yards in all three of his seasons. He’s second to Darren McFadden on the school’s career rushing list, and he was part of one of the most memorable plays in recent SEC history in 2015 at Mississippi. The Razorbacks were down by seven in overtime and faced fourth-and-25. Brandon Allen’s pass was complete to Hunter Henry, who was about to be tackled near the sideline, well short of the line to gain. Henry desperately flung the ball backwards toward the middle of the field. The ball bounced to Collins, who took off toward the other sideline and got the first down. Article content Arkansas eventually won 53-52. “We are so saddened by the sudden and tragic passing of Alex Collins. He was a legendary Razorback and an even better person,” the Arkansas football account posted on social media. “His love for the Razorbacks and desire to be a Hog was undeniable. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.” Collins played three seasons for the Seahawks and two for the Ravens. He rushed for 973 yards for Baltimore in 2017. “Alex was a joy to be around and someone whose light shined brightly,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement. “I’ll always remember him for being a great teammate who had an uplifting spirit that impacted everyone he encountered. He was also a smart player who ran with unlimited determination, and he contributed to a lot of our success during his time in Baltimore.” Collins played this year for the Memphis Showboats of the USFL. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Article content Share this article in your social network","pubDate":"2023-08-15 02:30:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"vancouversun","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Michael Oher, former NFL tackle known for 'The Blind Side,' sues to end Tuohys' conservatorship","link":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/08/15/sports/michael-oher-former-nfl-tackle-known-for-the-blind-side-sues-to-end-tuohys-conservatorship/1905448","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"NASHVILLE, Tennesse: Michael Oher, the former NFL tackle known for being the inspiration for the movie \"The Blind Side,\" filed a petition Monday in a Tennessee probate court accusing Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy of lying to by having him sign papers making them his conservators rather than his adoptive parents nearly two decades ago.In the petition filed Monday in Shelby County Probate Court, Oher asks for the conservatorship to be terminated along with asking for a full accounting of the money earned off the use of his name and story.

Not that there's anything wrong with the young Liverpool midfielder. Far from it, in fact. Instead, the issue now is how the can best accelerate the development of the prodigiously-talented 18-year-old given his progress is, on this evidence, already starting to overtake under-21 level. Certainly, Clark was by some distance the game's star performer, particularly during a first half in which his combinations down the left flank with winger James Norris and full-back Calum Scanlon caused Everton constant problems. Whenever the midfielder gained possession, there was buzz of anticipation among the Academy crowd, the teenager effortlessly jinking away from players, probing relentlessly and striking the crossbar first half. It was inevitable he'd be the creator for Liverpool's game-breaking first for Mateusz Musialowski before assisting substitute Tom Hill and rattling in the goal his performance merited. With Clark having grabbed his opportunity in the summer with the first team - not least when scoring in the 4-0 romp over Leicester City in Singapore - Liverpool must now decide whether his immediate career is best served remaining in and around the senior set-up or with a loan to perhaps a Championship club. Chances for minutes will surely come in the coming months, with the Reds hardly over-stocked with midfield options. The League Cup and Europa League appear ready-made for Clark to stake his claim. But wherever he ends up, the Liverpool youngster is very much one to keep an eye on. The relief from Musialowski at scoring the opener was almost tangible. Taking Clark's pass, the Poland U21 international showed great composure to calmly evade Everton goalkeeper Billy Crellin and roll the ball home seven minutes after the break. It atoned for an earlier aberration when, after an umpteenth Liverpool forward raid of a one-sided first half, the 19-year-old was teed up by Luca Stephenson for what appeared a straightforward finish, only to smash his shot well over the crossbar. Musialowski later provided an assist for a rampaging Terence Miles to put the Reds 2-0 up and appeared far more buoyed following his goal. This is likely to be a pivotal campaign for the winger, who burst on to the scene with the U18s three years ago but, due to injury and loss of form, experienced an underwhelming last campaign with the U21s. It may not, however, necessarily be at Liverpool, Musialowski one of several starters here who could well depart on loan come the end of the transfer window. Liverpool U21s coach Barry Lewtas is unlikely to be able to select such a strong starting line-up many times this season. Oakley Cannonier was another former U18 star who had his previous Premier League 2 campaign hampered by injury. Indeed, this was only a second start in the competition for the 19-year-old, who hit the woodwork in a lively first-half showing. The number six has been very much on the minds of Liverpool supporters in recent weeks, such have been the ongoing forlorn attempts to recruit in that position. It prompted Jurgen Klopp to try a number of different alternatives in defensive midfield during pre-season, including 18-year-old James McConnell in an unaccustomed role. While usually a more progressive player, the teenager impressed significantly in the deeper position to earn the plaudits of the Reds boss and began the mini-derby there, with captain Stephenson pushed further forward. One crunching first-half challenge sparked a move which ended with Clark having a shot saved, and showcased the aggression that had so enthused Klopp in Germany and Singapore. Liverpool's territorial dominance, though, meant McConnell's defensive capabilities were rarely called upon. But an unexpected new route to more first-team opportunities may now have opened.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27344266.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_GettyImages-1548950843.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Enzo Fernandez has exposed major Liverpool flaw that will leave Jurgen Klopp scared","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/enzo-fernandez-exposed-major-liverpool-27519708","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"John Aldridge reflects on Sunday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea in part two of his weekly Liverpool column","content":"On reflection, a point at Chelsea was a fair result on Sunday afternoon. There were some good things going forward from , but we can do better. I think we played Chelsea at a good time, with Pochettino still trying to find his best team and starting system, and we didn’t take advantage of that. Having said that, we could potentially have come away with all three points had the penalty decision gone our way. Why the handball from Nicolas Jackson didn’t go to VAR, I have no idea. Whether Jackson meant it or not, it has hit his hand. It’s clear. To go over to the monitor doesn’t mean you have to change your original decision, but at least go and take a look. One concerning statistic from Sunday's game was the fact we ended the afternoon with just 35.1% possession. There have only been three other occasions whereby we have recorded a lower figure in a Premier League game during Klopp's reign, and two of them were against Manchester City. That statistic alone tells you all you need to know about Liverpool’s need for a defensive midfielder and control in this area of the pitch. Jurgen Klopp knows, the staff know and the fans know it’s what we’re crying out for. Mac Allister had a good game, but was playing in a role that is not his favoured position. Players taking on the responsibility of being the No.6 are the ones who constantly win second balls, which we saw Enzo Fernandez doing all game for Chelsea. Szoboszlai also put in a good shift, but you need someone to do the donkey work. Klopp was criticised for taking off Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz for Ben Doak and Harvey Elliott as we searched for a winning goal at Stamford Bridge, but I thought he was spot on with his subs. When Elliott and Doak came on, there was a noticeable difference to our play. We were quicker and looked more likely to score. Elliott had a really good pre-season and looks like he is starting to come on to the next stage. As for Doak, there will be some games where he can earn Liverpool a lot of points by coming on as a sub. He is a fly up the wall and something defenders can’t handle. Whether Salah goes off or goes to centre-forward, Doak has to have more game time this season because he could be a superstar in the making. Salah was visibly frustrated over his substitution, but no player should be guaranteed 90 minutes every game. You cannot play to your full potential every game and be the star. He was tired and the manager was right to take him off. As for Salah’s reaction to being subbed, plenty has been said about it. It’s good that he doesn’t want to come off but, in the future, just take it. You don’t have to come off smiling, though, that’s fine.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27519734.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_EnzoKlopp.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton could get new nickname as transfer frustration continues","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-could-new-nickname-transfer-27519606","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Ball tackles the big issues at Goodison Park after Everton's 1-0 defeat to Fulham in their opening game of the new Premier League season","content":"Jack Harrison is the latest new face through the door at Goodison Park – after our latest dose of drama – but Evertonians are frustrated that we haven’t brought in transfers earlier. It’s been obvious what positions we’re short on and it should have been done and dusted very early on in the summer but then I look round at other clubs and many of them are still trying to bring in their targets. Why was Harry Kane’s transfer left so late? That could have been done over a month ago. Look at Chelsea and the Moises Caicedo situation, that’s only getting done now after months of interest and Chelsea not wanting to pay £100million for him in January and now having to splash out £115million. Even our neighbours, they brought in Alexis Mac Allister early on but now they’re scrambling around – having tried to hijack Caicedo’s Chelsea move – chasing another midfielder. We know how agents and football clubs often work, wanting to build up interest in these players that are worth fighting for. At this moment in time, unfortunately aren’t a team who seem to be the most attractive proposition because we’ve struggled for the past couple of seasons and nobody seems to know what’s going on upstairs. The top of the club appears to have been a state of disarray for a long time now and potential signings are going to want answers to questions about these things and if they’ve got another option then they’re probably going to sidestep us. Look what happened with first time around when we were managerless. If someone goes for a medical but then has the chance to go and sign for another club, that tells me that not all is well. As Evertonians, I think we’ve got to strap ourselves in for more bumpy rides as I think there are still plenty of more twists and turns to come before the end of the transfer window. We’re getting called Interested Party FC as we’re potentially in the market for a whole host of players. In many ways it’s like moving house and you’re stuck in a chain, waiting for certain scenarios to happen and every party involved is trying to get the best deal for them.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27519625.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1609908503.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women’s World Cup: Confident Matildas say they’re ‘right where we belong’ as they hit training track","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/fifa-women-s-world-cup/womens-world-cup-confident-matildas-say-theyre-right-where-we-belong-as-they-hit-training-track-c-11594854","keywords":null,"creator":["Anna Harrington"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Matildas finally believe they belong at the pointy end of the Women’s World Cup as they go through their final preparations ahead of facing England for a place in the final.","content":"The Matildas finally believe they belong at the pointy end of the Women’s World Cup as they go through their final preparations ahead of facing England for a place in the final. Australia have experienced an up-and-down journey throughout Tony Gustavsson’s tenure as head coach, which began in September 2020. But everything is falling into place ahead of Wednesday’s blockbuster semi-final at Stadium Australia - against an England team the Matildas beat in a friendly just four months ago. “It’s been in the pipeline for the last two years,” midfielder Tameka Yallop said. “We went through not necessarily a rebuilding stage but an adjustment stage with a new coach. “But we’ve always had these core players, we’ve always had this talent, and right now everything is coming together and we do feel like we are playing the best football that we’ve ever played together. “We’ve got so much belief within this team that we do feel we’re right where we belong.” The Matildas have been in a major semi-final before, falling heartbreakingly short when losing 1-0 to Sweden at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. But this occasion, on home soil, is on another level. “The Olympics is the Olympics and it’s absolutely amazing,” Yallop said. “Then we step away from that and you train for four years as well waiting for this World Cup. “And in football, the World Cup, it’s the pinnacle. For it to be at home as well, this will probably be the biggest game in all of our careers and all of our lifetime of playing football. “So this game is on its own little platform.” The Matildas have taken plenty of heart from their extraordinary 7-6 penalty shoot-out win over France in the quarter-finals, showing a new-found grit. Saturday’s shoot-out was seven years to the day since Australia’s heartbreaking loss to Brazil in the same manner at the Rio Olympics. “We’ve always been capable of (reaching the highest levels),” Yallop said. “We’ve always had the skill set and the talent to do it. “We’ve just built an amazing environment right now within our team that we all feel so supported and so united in what we’re doing and the journey that we’re on, that there isn’t really any other option.” Jackson Barrett Recovery has been a key part of Australia’s success, with several players featuring in every, or almost every, minute of the tournament to date, including midfield duo Katrina Gorry and Kyra Cooney-Cross. “They do this kind of stuff week in and week out,” Yallop said. “It is a shorter turnaround, but it’s also - you’ve got all that extra motivation, drive and just that win to play for that means so much more than your club games week in and week out. “The whole team is capable of running, and we do really focus on recovery as well. That goes a long way.” Every player bar forward Kyah Simon (knee) hit the track in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah on Tuesday morning. That included vice-captain Steph Catley, who had her right thigh strapped.

Doubt him at your peril.","content":"When his bosses made Robert O’Brien ride shotgun to the corner of politics and nepotism, the Broomfield football coach took one glance at the neighborhood and did the only thing he could. He jumped from the dang car. “I was removed for benching a quarterback who was the athletic director’s nephew,” O’Brien explained to me Monday at Empower Field, “and the district athletic director’s son.” This was back at Citrus High School in Inverness, Fla., during the fall of 2019. His first autumn as a prep head coach. Oh, and did we mention that his team was 8-1 over Coach OB’s first nine games when he was … Or that Citrus was cruising to its first playoff berth in six years? Or the ’Canes’ stellar record of 13-25 in the four seasons before O’Brien showed up? “I was asked to move to a middle school 30 minutes away,” the first-year Eagles coach continued. “They said that if I wanted to stay in the district and stay in Florida, that was going to be the move.” Instead, O’Brien Fans and justifiably. An online petition at Change.org calling for his reinstatement Somebody else coached the playoff game. Which, of course, Citrus lost by 22 points. The ’Canes haven’t sniffed the postseason since. “Welcome to Central Florida,” O’Brien chuckled. The man’s 37 going on 62. Doubt him at your peril. Whereas Dave Logan turned up to CHSAA fall sports media day and towered over peers in terms of height and gravitas, O’Brien, with his cool demeanor and mop of dark, curly hair, looked like one of the dudes. The guy charged with defending the Eagles’ 4A state title cracked wise with his players at Empower Field with a vibe that felt more like an older brother than grizzled mentor. “(He’s) honestly amazing,” offered Broomfield senior tackle Landen Davidson, a 308-pound who’s built like one of those . “And I feel like I can connect with (O’Brien) very well and I can tell him things and create that deeper bond with him. I really appreciate that going into my senior season. I need it.” The Eagles need a little serenity. Their state-championship QB from last fall, Cole LaCrue, Their state-championship coach from last fall, Blair Hubbard, was placed on administrative leave and last spring “Our team (had) kind of found out from the school,” senior defensive back Brent Harris said of Hubbard’s departure. “And we were all just surprised. And just didn’t know what was coming next.” Up next was O’Brien, a Louisville native who’d played at Monarch and was Hubbard’s defensive coordinator from 2016-18, having helped lead the Eagles to the state title game during his first season on the staff. “Building (Broomfield football) from ’16 to ’18 was something that we felt like I was a part of,” O’Brien said. “So it was pretty easy to jump back in and say, ‘We’ve built this (program) — it wasn’t just one guy. We as a program, as a staff, as a community, we built this.’ So it was pretty easy to make that transition.” So far, O’Brien — Davidson and Harris call him “Coach OB” — has managed to find the sweet spot between the familiar and the fresh. Most of the coaching staff is back. The upperclassmen have made it clear that the plan is to pick things up right where they left off, even going so far as to , BoCo’s other 4A beast, during a Monday news conference. “I think any time there’s going to be coaching change, there’s going to be challenges. Any time that a great coach leaves a program with a lot of success, there (are) going to be some differences,” O’Brien continued. “Have we worked through some of those things? Absolutely. Will there be more things that come up? I’m sure there will. But we’ve got a phenomenal group of coaches. We’ve got a phenomenal administration. We’ve got wonderful student-athletes and the parental support has been absolutely unbelievable.” And while Coach OB declined to get into specifics about what he and Hubbard have talked about since the former was hired, it can’t be any more awkward than the situation in Florida four years ago. “I’m not going to lie to you: a lot of prayer went into that,” O’Brien recalled. “It was a really difficult time. I leaned on my faith more so in that moment that I ever have in my entire life. And it brought me back to coaching. “And I still am in contact with a lot of those kids and a lot of the players from down there in Florida. As hard as it was, it was also a special experience for me to be able to develop those relationships and do some things that they had never done, (such as) having a winning season … Central Florida football is no joke.” Neither is he. “I’m that (BoCo) neighborhood type of kid,” he laughed. “And I know what that neighborhood type of kid is — hard-nosed, blue-collar, a little angry at times, a little physical, a little tough. And that’s the type of football that we play.” The year after he was run out of town, Citrus went 1-7. Since the fall of ’20, the Hurricanes are 5-23. Robert O’Brien, meanwhile, is settling into the driver’s seat from a mile high. And climbing.","pubDate":"2023-08-15 02:40:49","image_url":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TDP-L-BROOM-LOVELAND-CHAMPIONSHIP-7.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"denverpost","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Alex Collins, former Seahawks and Ravens running back, dies at age 28","link":"http://vancouversun.com/pmn/news-pmn/alex-collins-former-seahawks-and-ravens-running-back-dies-at-age-28/wcm/2484271f-8e36-4c37-87bb-ec3c3ff4e7a3","keywords":["Football","NFL","Sports"],"creator":["Mike Raptis"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Seahawks released a statement from Collins’ family Monday night","content":"Article content OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Former NFL running back Alex Collins, who played five seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens, was killed in a motorcycle crash in South Florida, authorities said. He was 28. Collins was driving a motorcycle that crashed into a sport-utility vehicle Sunday night in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Article content Article content The SUV was making a left turn when Collins’ motorcycle hit its rear passenger side. The impact caused Collins to go through a window of the SUV and come to rest inside the vehicle, the sheriff’s office said. Collins was pronounced dead at the scene. The SUV driver, whose name was withheld, remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators, authorities said. The Seahawks released a statement from Collins’ family Monday night “Alex was cherished by his family and friends as well as supporters from all around the world. All who truly know him can attest to his drive, determination, and larger-than-life personality,” the statement said. “We kindly request your thoughts and prayers for our family during this difficult time.” Collins played in college at Arkansas, where he rushed for over 1,000 yards in all three of his seasons. He’s second to Darren McFadden on the school’s career rushing list, and he was part of one of the most memorable plays in recent SEC history in 2015 at Mississippi. The Razorbacks were down by seven in overtime and faced fourth-and-25. Brandon Allen’s pass was complete to Hunter Henry, who was about to be tackled near the sideline, well short of the line to gain. Henry desperately flung the ball backwards toward the middle of the field. The ball bounced to Collins, who took off toward the other sideline and got the first down. Article content Arkansas eventually won 53-52. “We are so saddened by the sudden and tragic passing of Alex Collins. He was a legendary Razorback and an even better person,” the Arkansas football account posted on social media. “His love for the Razorbacks and desire to be a Hog was undeniable. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.” Collins played three seasons for the Seahawks and two for the Ravens. He rushed for 973 yards for Baltimore in 2017. “Alex was a joy to be around and someone whose light shined brightly,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement. “I’ll always remember him for being a great teammate who had an uplifting spirit that impacted everyone he encountered. He was also a smart player who ran with unlimited determination, and he contributed to a lot of our success during his time in Baltimore.” Collins played this year for the Memphis Showboats of the USFL. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Article content Share this article in your social network","pubDate":"2023-08-15 02:30:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"vancouversun","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Michael Oher, former NFL tackle known for 'The Blind Side,' sues to end Tuohys' conservatorship","link":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/08/15/sports/michael-oher-former-nfl-tackle-known-for-the-blind-side-sues-to-end-tuohys-conservatorship/1905448","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"NASHVILLE, Tennesse: Michael Oher, the former NFL tackle known for being the inspiration for the movie \"The Blind Side,\" filed a petition Monday in a Tennessee probate court accusing Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy of lying to by having him sign papers making them his conservators rather than his adoptive parents nearly two decades ago.In the petition filed Monday in Shelby County Probate Court, Oher asks for the conservatorship to be terminated along with asking for a full accounting of the money earned off the use of his name and story.
