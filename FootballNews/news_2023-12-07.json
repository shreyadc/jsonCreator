It is akin to what Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in 1964 said of his test for obscenity: ‚ÄúI know it when I see it.‚Äô‚Äô What is going on with the Giants, Brian Daboll and Wink Martindale is not dysfunctional. You know that when you see it and this ain‚Äôt it. That does not mean it is all simpatico with the head coach and his defensive coordinator. Nothing that has transpired this season between the most important and second-most important coach in the building means there will definitely be a parting of the ways once the Giants put the footballs away. Could it happen? Sure. Will it? Too soon to tell. The winning the Giants experienced in Year 1 of the Daboll regime reinforced the desire to keep things together. The return of all three coordinators in 2023 was considered a boon to Daboll‚Äôs program. The losing the Giants are doing in Year 2 could lead to changes in the upper-reaches of Daboll‚Äôs staff. Perhaps Daboll will feel pressure to act. Maybe offensive coordinator Mike Kafka is the collateral damage for the scoring ineptitude. Daboll might want to shake things up with longtime special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey. There is a chance ownership pushes for Daboll to make moves. There is certainly a chance Kafka and McGaughey return and Daboll concentrates more on the continued building of the roster. And then there is Martindale. A Fox Sports report surfaced 11 games into the season stating the relationship between Daboll and Martindale is in a ‚Äúbad place‚Äô‚Äô and this could lead to Martindale leaving the team before the end of this season and more likely after this season. Daboll made a few cracks and downplayed all of it. Martindale‚Äôs first chance to comment on this comes Friday, when the Giants coordinators meet with the media for the first time since before the bye week. What Martindale says should be quite revealing, as he is not known as someone who keeps his thoughts hidden. If he is strong in his rebuttal that anything is brewing with Daboll it will go a long way in putting this to bed, at least until the season ends. If Martindale leaves any wiggle room, the insinuation of unrest lingers as the Giants at 4-8 prepare for their Monday night meeting with the Packers at MetLife Stadium. Was there tension? Is there tension? Much of this noise came to the surface after Daboll could be seen having an animated discussion with Martindale at halftime of the Week 10 game in Dallas. By the time the 49-17 rout by the Cowboys was over and done with, Martindale‚Äôs defense had allowed 640 total yards, the second-highest total in the 99-year history of the franchise. The Giants allowed two players to surpass 150 receiving yards in a game for the first time in franchise history. If you think this sort of abysmal performance does not engender tension between the head coach and the defensive coordinator you have not been around too many NFL coaching staffs. That this stinker came in the first game after Martindale unloaded on safety Xavier McKinney for his comments after the 30-6 loss in Las Vegas was not lost on individuals inside the building. McKinney complained there was not enough communication between the leaders on defense and the coaches and, if true, that did not reflect kindly on Martindale . No other player picked up on that accusation and there was no real controversy brewing ‚Äî until Martindale expressed how hurt he was by McKinney‚Äôs words. Daboll‚Äôs preference was for Martindale to keep all this inside the team; going public only created further distraction and the head coach is all about minimizing distraction. Daboll saw fit to alert the players that there is nothing wrong with his relationship with Martindale. ‚ÄúFirst time I heard it was when [Daboll] addressed it to us,‚Äô‚Äô Dexter Lawrence told The Post. ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt feel any tension, he says there‚Äôs no tension. He said the only thing they argue about is a slice of pizza .‚Äô‚Äô You want dysfunction? Recall how Joe Judge and his offensive line coach, Marc Colombo, nearly came to blows in Judge‚Äôs office . You want dysfunction? Judge and the general manager, Dave Gettleman, basically ignored each other down the stretch of the 2021 season ‚Äî a situation that ownership never should have tolerated. Daboll, 48, is demanding and believes in direct communication. He does not let things fester. He is aggressive in his fact-finding missions. Thin-skinned individuals will not do well in his sphere of influence. Despite a few hiccups, Martindale‚Äôs defense has far outperformed the mostly-feeble offense. He is 60 years old and has made no secret of his desire to be an NFL head coach. The Giants made the playoffs in his first year in the New York/New Jersey media market and Martindale received plenty of credit for the turnaround ‚Äî but only one interview (Colts) for a head-coaching position. Time is not on his side, with the Giants destined to watch this season‚Äôs postseason action from home. That can breed tension, too.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:22:48","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-7me201o9l-1701917764757.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1701899797","source_id":"nypost","source_priority":109,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8446795d7eef4e1c86a0873f0cce4bc2","title":"–¢–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ ‚Äî –æ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–µ –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª: ¬´–í –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ 30 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ —É ¬´–ú–Æ¬ª –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å¬ª","link":"https://www.sport-express.ru/football/england/news/glavnyy-trener-manchester-yunayted-erik-ten-hag-prokommentiroval-pobedu-nad-chelsi-2154554/","keywords":["–§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª - –ê–Ω–≥–ª–∏—è"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –≠—Ä–∏–∫ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—É –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª (2:1) –≤ 15-–º —Ç—É—Ä–µ –ê–ü–õ.","content":"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –≠—Ä–∏–∫ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—É –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª (2:1) –≤ 15-–º —Ç—É—Ä–µ –ê–ü–õ. ¬´–£ –º–µ–Ω—è –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –ø—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∑–∏–∏, –Ω–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–º –∏ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–π. –í –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ 30 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ —É –Ω–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å. –ù–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –≥–æ–ª. –ú—ã –≤—ã–∫–ª—é—á–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∏–∑ –∏–≥—Ä—ã. –ù–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è. –ú—ã –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–º—Å—è –≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏. –ú–∞–∫—Ç–æ–º–∏–Ω–µ–π –æ—á–µ–Ω—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫. –û–Ω –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ —Å –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏. –û–Ω –∑–∞–±–∏–ª –¥–≤–∞ –≥–æ–ª–∞ –∏ –º–æ–≥ –±—ã –∑–∞–±–∏—Ç—å –µ—â–µ¬ª, ‚Äî –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥–∞ –í–í–°. ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞–ª 27 –æ—á–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –ø–æ–¥–Ω—è–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞ 6-–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –≤ —Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–Ω–æ–π —Ç–∞–±–ª–∏—Ü–µ.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:20:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"sport_express","source_priority":81120,"country":["russia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"russian"},{"article_id":"35b77d07f5af5598aeb8888c238be42c","title":"New coach Jon Poppe sets Ivy League title goal for Columbia","link":"https://nypost.com/2023/12/06/sports/new-coach-jon-poppe-sets-ivy-league-title-goal-for-columbia/","keywords":null,"creator":["Miles Schachner"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jon Poppe spoke of promises to fulfill, goals to reach and a culture to build, but made one thing clear: he was hired to bring Columbia a championship.","content":"Columbia football has a new coach ‚Äî and he brings a reunion with lofty expectations. When an energetic, impassioned Jon Poppe approached the podium inside Columbia‚Äôs gymnasium on Wednesday, he spoke of promises to fulfill, goals to reach and a culture to build, but made one thing clear: he was hired to bring Columbia a championship. For a Columbia football program with a singular Ivy League title ‚Äî won back in 1961 ‚Äî championships are hard to come by. But Poppe, who spent three seasons at Columbia as a secondary coach and recruiting coordinator from 2015-17, appeared ready to accept that challenge. ‚ÄúWe will never be complacent,‚Äù Poppe said. ‚ÄúThe hunger is always going to exist. We‚Äôre going to focus on recruiting efforts on the best and brightest. ‚Ä¶ We want young people here that desire to be challenged.‚Äù The 38-year-old New Jersey native returns to Morningside Heights after successful stints at Harvard as a secondary and special teams coach and one year as a head coach at Union College. Poppe led the Garnet Chargers to a 10-2 record and the second round of the Division III Tournament last season, adding four wins to the team‚Äôs record and earning him a look when the Columbia job became available. He succeeds interim head coach Mark Fabish, a former offensive coordinator who stepped into the head-coaching role unexpectedly in 2023 when Al Bagnoli, a nine-time Ivy champion, retired six weeks before the season opener due to health concerns. Bagnoli, who served as a head coach for 40 years and compiled 274 wins, was coaxed out of retirement in 2015 to resurrect a Columbia program that had finished winless in consecutive seasons. \"You can make history here.\" ‚Äì @Coach_Poppe #RoarLionRoar // #OnlyHere üóΩü¶Å pic.twitter.com/TgTtKBVx7Y He did just that, the team‚Äôs best season during his tenure coming in 2017 when the Lions went 8-2 and came within one win of a sought-after conference championship. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come close here in my time,‚Äù Poppe, who helped recruit members of the 2017 team, said. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes the football bounces a funny way. So hopefully we‚Äôre preparing our young men right in practice, to get that ball to bounce the right way. We‚Äôve got to get Lady Karma on our side, that‚Äôs a big part of football sometimes.‚Äù Poppe inherits a team that stumbled during a transitional 2023 campaign, posting a 1-6 Ivy League record for its worst year since 2015. Fortunately for Columbia, Poppe has reached the Ivy League mountaintop before. During Poppe‚Äôs initial three-year stint at Harvard from 2011-14, the Crimson took home three conference championships as he led its secondary and special teams groups. Now, Columbia will look to Poppe to take the school where it hasn‚Äôt been in over 60 years.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:15:22","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-qlbn0aru3-1701916253235.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1701898288","source_id":"nypost","source_priority":109,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"19398ad7cc65358996ac0ea4eaf5d2e7","title":"L‚ÄôOM enfonce Lyon sur fond de protestations des groupes de supporteurs","link":"https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2023/12/07/l-om-enfonce-lyon-sur-fond-de-protestations-des-groupes-de-supporteurs_6204287_3242.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Report√©e apr√®s les incidents du 29 octobre, la rencontre de mercredi a √©t√© marqu√©e par un festival offensif phoc√©en (3-0) et un d√©but de grogne des ultras marseillais contre les interdictions de d√©placement.","content":"Cette fois, le match entre l‚ÄôOlympique de Marseille (OM) et l‚ÄôOlympique lyonnais (OL) version 2023-2024 a bien eu lieu. Report√©e le 29 octobre, apr√®s les attaques par des supporteurs marseillais de plusieurs bus des visiteurs, dont celui transportant les joueurs de l‚ÄôOL, la rencontre entre ces deux rivaux historiques du championnat de France s‚Äôest tenue sans incident, mercredi 6 d√©cembre, au Stade-V√©lodrome, √† Marseille. Mais elle marque aussi le d√©but d‚Äôune grogne du milieu ultra, qui s‚Äôoppose √† la volont√© des pouvoirs publics d‚Äôinterdire temporairement tout d√©placement lors de matches class√©s ¬´ √† risque ¬ª par la division nationale de lutte contre le hooliganisme. Devant 54 238 spectateurs, qui ont quitt√© l‚Äôenceinte ravis, l‚ÄôOM s‚Äôest impos√©e facilement (3-0) , mercredi.

Ce match entre Marseille et Lyon n‚Äôa pas √©t√© un sommet de football. Mais il √©tait surtout scrut√© pour ses √†-c√¥t√©s.

It is akin to what Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in 1964 said of his test for obscenity: ‚ÄúI know it when I see it.‚Äô‚Äô What is going on with the Giants, Brian Daboll and Wink Martindale is not dysfunctional. You know that when you see it and this ain‚Äôt it. That does not mean it is all simpatico with the head coach and his defensive coordinator. Nothing that has transpired this season between the most important and second-most important coach in the building means there will definitely be a parting of the ways once the Giants put the footballs away. Could it happen? Sure. Will it? Too soon to tell. The winning the Giants experienced in Year 1 of the Daboll regime reinforced the desire to keep things together. The return of all three coordinators in 2023 was considered a boon to Daboll‚Äôs program. The losing the Giants are doing in Year 2 could lead to changes in the upper-reaches of Daboll‚Äôs staff. Perhaps Daboll will feel pressure to act. Maybe offensive coordinator Mike Kafka is the collateral damage for the scoring ineptitude. Daboll might want to shake things up with longtime special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey. There is a chance ownership pushes for Daboll to make moves. There is certainly a chance Kafka and McGaughey return and Daboll concentrates more on the continued building of the roster. And then there is Martindale. A Fox Sports report surfaced 11 games into the season stating the relationship between Daboll and Martindale is in a ‚Äúbad place‚Äô‚Äô and this could lead to Martindale leaving the team before the end of this season and more likely after this season. Daboll made a few cracks and downplayed all of it. Martindale‚Äôs first chance to comment on this comes Friday, when the Giants coordinators meet with the media for the first time since before the bye week. What Martindale says should be quite revealing, as he is not known as someone who keeps his thoughts hidden. If he is strong in his rebuttal that anything is brewing with Daboll it will go a long way in putting this to bed, at least until the season ends. If Martindale leaves any wiggle room, the insinuation of unrest lingers as the Giants at 4-8 prepare for their Monday night meeting with the Packers at MetLife Stadium. Was there tension? Is there tension? Much of this noise came to the surface after Daboll could be seen having an animated discussion with Martindale at halftime of the Week 10 game in Dallas. By the time the 49-17 rout by the Cowboys was over and done with, Martindale‚Äôs defense had allowed 640 total yards, the second-highest total in the 99-year history of the franchise. The Giants allowed two players to surpass 150 receiving yards in a game for the first time in franchise history. If you think this sort of abysmal performance does not engender tension between the head coach and the defensive coordinator you have not been around too many NFL coaching staffs. That this stinker came in the first game after Martindale unloaded on safety Xavier McKinney for his comments after the 30-6 loss in Las Vegas was not lost on individuals inside the building. McKinney complained there was not enough communication between the leaders on defense and the coaches and, if true, that did not reflect kindly on Martindale . No other player picked up on that accusation and there was no real controversy brewing ‚Äî until Martindale expressed how hurt he was by McKinney‚Äôs words. Daboll‚Äôs preference was for Martindale to keep all this inside the team; going public only created further distraction and the head coach is all about minimizing distraction. Daboll saw fit to alert the players that there is nothing wrong with his relationship with Martindale. ‚ÄúFirst time I heard it was when [Daboll] addressed it to us,‚Äô‚Äô Dexter Lawrence told The Post. ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt feel any tension, he says there‚Äôs no tension. He said the only thing they argue about is a slice of pizza .‚Äô‚Äô You want dysfunction? Recall how Joe Judge and his offensive line coach, Marc Colombo, nearly came to blows in Judge‚Äôs office . You want dysfunction? Judge and the general manager, Dave Gettleman, basically ignored each other down the stretch of the 2021 season ‚Äî a situation that ownership never should have tolerated. Daboll, 48, is demanding and believes in direct communication. He does not let things fester. He is aggressive in his fact-finding missions. Thin-skinned individuals will not do well in his sphere of influence. Despite a few hiccups, Martindale‚Äôs defense has far outperformed the mostly-feeble offense. He is 60 years old and has made no secret of his desire to be an NFL head coach. The Giants made the playoffs in his first year in the New York/New Jersey media market and Martindale received plenty of credit for the turnaround ‚Äî but only one interview (Colts) for a head-coaching position. Time is not on his side, with the Giants destined to watch this season‚Äôs postseason action from home. That can breed tension, too.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:22:48","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-7me201o9l-1701917764757.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1701899797","source_id":"nypost","source_priority":109,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8446795d7eef4e1c86a0873f0cce4bc2","title":"–¢–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ ‚Äî –æ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–µ –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª: ¬´–í –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ 30 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ —É ¬´–ú–Æ¬ª –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å¬ª","link":"https://www.sport-express.ru/football/england/news/glavnyy-trener-manchester-yunayted-erik-ten-hag-prokommentiroval-pobedu-nad-chelsi-2154554/","keywords":["–§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª - –ê–Ω–≥–ª–∏—è"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –≠—Ä–∏–∫ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—É –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª (2:1) –≤ 15-–º —Ç—É—Ä–µ –ê–ü–õ.","content":"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –≠—Ä–∏–∫ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—É –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª (2:1) –≤ 15-–º —Ç—É—Ä–µ –ê–ü–õ. ¬´–£ –º–µ–Ω—è –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –ø—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∑–∏–∏, –Ω–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–º –∏ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–π. –í –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ 30 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ —É –Ω–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å. –ù–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –≥–æ–ª. –ú—ã –≤—ã–∫–ª—é—á–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∏–∑ –∏–≥—Ä—ã. –ù–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è. –ú—ã –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–º—Å—è –≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏. –ú–∞–∫—Ç–æ–º–∏–Ω–µ–π –æ—á–µ–Ω—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫. –û–Ω –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ —Å –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏. –û–Ω –∑–∞–±–∏–ª –¥–≤–∞ –≥–æ–ª–∞ –∏ –º–æ–≥ –±—ã –∑–∞–±–∏—Ç—å –µ—â–µ¬ª, ‚Äî –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥–∞ –í–í–°. ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞–ª 27 –æ—á–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –ø–æ–¥–Ω—è–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞ 6-–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –≤ —Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–Ω–æ–π —Ç–∞–±–ª–∏—Ü–µ.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:20:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"sport_express","source_priority":81120,"country":["russia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"russian"},{"article_id":"35b77d07f5af5598aeb8888c238be42c","title":"New coach Jon Poppe sets Ivy League title goal for Columbia","link":"https://nypost.com/2023/12/06/sports/new-coach-jon-poppe-sets-ivy-league-title-goal-for-columbia/","keywords":null,"creator":["Miles Schachner"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jon Poppe spoke of promises to fulfill, goals to reach and a culture to build, but made one thing clear: he was hired to bring Columbia a championship.","content":"Columbia football has a new coach ‚Äî and he brings a reunion with lofty expectations. When an energetic, impassioned Jon Poppe approached the podium inside Columbia‚Äôs gymnasium on Wednesday, he spoke of promises to fulfill, goals to reach and a culture to build, but made one thing clear: he was hired to bring Columbia a championship. For a Columbia football program with a singular Ivy League title ‚Äî won back in 1961 ‚Äî championships are hard to come by. But Poppe, who spent three seasons at Columbia as a secondary coach and recruiting coordinator from 2015-17, appeared ready to accept that challenge. ‚ÄúWe will never be complacent,‚Äù Poppe said. ‚ÄúThe hunger is always going to exist. We‚Äôre going to focus on recruiting efforts on the best and brightest. ‚Ä¶ We want young people here that desire to be challenged.‚Äù The 38-year-old New Jersey native returns to Morningside Heights after successful stints at Harvard as a secondary and special teams coach and one year as a head coach at Union College. Poppe led the Garnet Chargers to a 10-2 record and the second round of the Division III Tournament last season, adding four wins to the team‚Äôs record and earning him a look when the Columbia job became available. He succeeds interim head coach Mark Fabish, a former offensive coordinator who stepped into the head-coaching role unexpectedly in 2023 when Al Bagnoli, a nine-time Ivy champion, retired six weeks before the season opener due to health concerns. Bagnoli, who served as a head coach for 40 years and compiled 274 wins, was coaxed out of retirement in 2015 to resurrect a Columbia program that had finished winless in consecutive seasons. \"You can make history here.\" ‚Äì @Coach_Poppe #RoarLionRoar // #OnlyHere üóΩü¶Å pic.twitter.com/TgTtKBVx7Y He did just that, the team‚Äôs best season during his tenure coming in 2017 when the Lions went 8-2 and came within one win of a sought-after conference championship. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come close here in my time,‚Äù Poppe, who helped recruit members of the 2017 team, said. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes the football bounces a funny way. So hopefully we‚Äôre preparing our young men right in practice, to get that ball to bounce the right way. We‚Äôve got to get Lady Karma on our side, that‚Äôs a big part of football sometimes.‚Äù Poppe inherits a team that stumbled during a transitional 2023 campaign, posting a 1-6 Ivy League record for its worst year since 2015. Fortunately for Columbia, Poppe has reached the Ivy League mountaintop before. During Poppe‚Äôs initial three-year stint at Harvard from 2011-14, the Crimson took home three conference championships as he led its secondary and special teams groups. Now, Columbia will look to Poppe to take the school where it hasn‚Äôt been in over 60 years.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:15:22","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-qlbn0aru3-1701916253235.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1701898288","source_id":"nypost","source_priority":109,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"19398ad7cc65358996ac0ea4eaf5d2e7","title":"L‚ÄôOM enfonce Lyon sur fond de protestations des groupes de supporteurs","link":"https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2023/12/07/l-om-enfonce-lyon-sur-fond-de-protestations-des-groupes-de-supporteurs_6204287_3242.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Report√©e apr√®s les incidents du 29 octobre, la rencontre de mercredi a √©t√© marqu√©e par un festival offensif phoc√©en (3-0) et un d√©but de grogne des ultras marseillais contre les interdictions de d√©placement.","content":"Cette fois, le match entre l‚ÄôOlympique de Marseille (OM) et l‚ÄôOlympique lyonnais (OL) version 2023-2024 a bien eu lieu. Report√©e le 29 octobre, apr√®s les attaques par des supporteurs marseillais de plusieurs bus des visiteurs, dont celui transportant les joueurs de l‚ÄôOL, la rencontre entre ces deux rivaux historiques du championnat de France s‚Äôest tenue sans incident, mercredi 6 d√©cembre, au Stade-V√©lodrome, √† Marseille. Mais elle marque aussi le d√©but d‚Äôune grogne du milieu ultra, qui s‚Äôoppose √† la volont√© des pouvoirs publics d‚Äôinterdire temporairement tout d√©placement lors de matches class√©s ¬´ √† risque ¬ª par la division nationale de lutte contre le hooliganisme. Devant 54 238 spectateurs, qui ont quitt√© l‚Äôenceinte ravis, l‚ÄôOM s‚Äôest impos√©e facilement (3-0) , mercredi. L‚Äô√©quipe signe ainsi sa troisi√®me victoire d‚Äôaffil√©e en autant de sorties sur sa pelouse, et a disput√©, de l‚Äôavis g√©n√©ral, son meilleur match de la saison. Avec deux passes d√©cisives et un but, l‚Äôattaquant Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang confirme son renouveau ; apr√®s ses quatre buts en deux rencontres, la recrue phare de l‚Äôintersaison de l‚ÄôOM, bien aid√©e par la pr√©sence du Portugais Vitinha ‚Äì un but, une passe d√©cisive ‚Äî titularis√© √† ses c√¥t√©s, a fait taire les sifflets qui l‚Äôavaient accueilli une semaine plus t√¥t lors de la confrontation contre l‚ÄôAjax d‚ÄôAmsterdam en Ligue Europa. ¬´ On ne doit pas croire qu‚Äôon a tout r√©solu ¬ª, a relativis√© l‚Äôentra√Æneur marseillais, l‚ÄôItalien Gennaro Gattuso, apr√®s la rencontre, rappelant que son √©quipe avait pein√© dans les matches pr√©c√©dents. L‚Äô√©quipe lyonnaise, elle, poursuit son annus horribilis . La pr√©sence sur le banc de l‚ÄôOL de Pierre Sage, entra√Æneur int√©rimaire , n‚Äôa rien chang√© aux errements d‚Äôune formation inoffensive et fragile d√©fensivement. ¬´ Nous avons √©t√© en non-ma√Ætrise tout au long du match ¬ª, a reconnu le coach lyonnais. Avec sept points en quatorze matches, l‚ÄôOL se tra√Æne en queue de classement et semble, plus que jamais, sous la menace d‚Äôune rel√©gation en Ligue 2. ¬´ Nous avons conscience d‚Äô√™tre en danger ¬ª, confirme Pierre Sage. Ce match entre Marseille et Lyon n‚Äôa pas √©t√© un sommet de football. Mais il √©tait surtout scrut√© pour ses √†-c√¥t√©s. Le contexte de ces retrouvailles, pesant depuis l‚Äôannulation du premier face-√†-face, s‚Äôest encore alourdi avec la mort, dimanche, d‚Äôun supporteur nantais , poignard√© par un chauffeur de VTC en amont de la rencontre entre Nantes et Nice. Mercredi, l‚Äôarriv√©e du bus de l‚ÄôOL √©tait s√ªrement la plus attendue de la saison en Ligue 1. A 19 h 30, pr√©c√©d√© de motards, d‚Äôune voiture et de deux fourgons de police, le v√©hicule transportant les joueurs et le staff technique lyonnais, un autocar classique lou√© √† un transporteur vauclusien, a p√©n√©tr√© dans les entrailles du Stade-V√©lodrome. ¬´ Sans incident ¬ª, a pr√©cis√© la pr√©fecture de police, qui avait mobilis√© pr√®s de 700 policiers et gendarmes pour √©viter tout d√©bordement. Un v√©hicule blind√© avec un canon √† eau tr√¥nait m√™me √† l‚Äôentr√©e du stade alors que des drones surplombaient la sc√®ne.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:15:15","image_url":"https://img.lemde.fr/2023/12/06/1347/0/8078/4039/644/322/60/0/b36ac77_1dea1d613c054911ab059df855c785ed-0-035f492235a345d09d6eb0d9c7b4f344.jpg","source_id":"lemonde","source_priority":12566,"country":["france"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french"},{"article_id":"4ee668543e1d1346c57cde7e64e6d822","title":"Teen spirit drives Brisbane Roar towards ALM nirvana","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/soccer/teen-spirit-drives-brisbane-roar-towards-alm-nirvana-c-12819212","keywords":null,"creator":["Joel Gould"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brisbane Roar coach Ross Aloisi has given A-League debuts to teenagers Tom Waddingham, Shae Cahill, Quinn MacNicol and Rylan Brownlie this season.","content":"Brisbane Roar coach Ross Aloisi has an \"if you are good enough, you are old enough\" philosophy about picking young players and it is an ethos he is putting into practice.

It is akin to what Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in 1964 said of his test for obscenity: ‚ÄúI know it when I see it.‚Äô‚Äô What is going on with the Giants, Brian Daboll and Wink Martindale is not dysfunctional. You know that when you see it and this ain‚Äôt it. That does not mean it is all simpatico with the head coach and his defensive coordinator. Nothing that has transpired this season between the most important and second-most important coach in the building means there will definitely be a parting of the ways once the Giants put the footballs away. Could it happen? Sure. Will it? Too soon to tell. The winning the Giants experienced in Year 1 of the Daboll regime reinforced the desire to keep things together. The return of all three coordinators in 2023 was considered a boon to Daboll‚Äôs program. The losing the Giants are doing in Year 2 could lead to changes in the upper-reaches of Daboll‚Äôs staff. Perhaps Daboll will feel pressure to act. Maybe offensive coordinator Mike Kafka is the collateral damage for the scoring ineptitude. Daboll might want to shake things up with longtime special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey. There is a chance ownership pushes for Daboll to make moves. There is certainly a chance Kafka and McGaughey return and Daboll concentrates more on the continued building of the roster. And then there is Martindale. A Fox Sports report surfaced 11 games into the season stating the relationship between Daboll and Martindale is in a ‚Äúbad place‚Äô‚Äô and this could lead to Martindale leaving the team before the end of this season and more likely after this season. Daboll made a few cracks and downplayed all of it. Martindale‚Äôs first chance to comment on this comes Friday, when the Giants coordinators meet with the media for the first time since before the bye week. What Martindale says should be quite revealing, as he is not known as someone who keeps his thoughts hidden. If he is strong in his rebuttal that anything is brewing with Daboll it will go a long way in putting this to bed, at least until the season ends. If Martindale leaves any wiggle room, the insinuation of unrest lingers as the Giants at 4-8 prepare for their Monday night meeting with the Packers at MetLife Stadium. Was there tension? Is there tension? Much of this noise came to the surface after Daboll could be seen having an animated discussion with Martindale at halftime of the Week 10 game in Dallas. By the time the 49-17 rout by the Cowboys was over and done with, Martindale‚Äôs defense had allowed 640 total yards, the second-highest total in the 99-year history of the franchise. The Giants allowed two players to surpass 150 receiving yards in a game for the first time in franchise history. If you think this sort of abysmal performance does not engender tension between the head coach and the defensive coordinator you have not been around too many NFL coaching staffs. That this stinker came in the first game after Martindale unloaded on safety Xavier McKinney for his comments after the 30-6 loss in Las Vegas was not lost on individuals inside the building. McKinney complained there was not enough communication between the leaders on defense and the coaches and, if true, that did not reflect kindly on Martindale . No other player picked up on that accusation and there was no real controversy brewing ‚Äî until Martindale expressed how hurt he was by McKinney‚Äôs words. Daboll‚Äôs preference was for Martindale to keep all this inside the team; going public only created further distraction and the head coach is all about minimizing distraction. Daboll saw fit to alert the players that there is nothing wrong with his relationship with Martindale. ‚ÄúFirst time I heard it was when [Daboll] addressed it to us,‚Äô‚Äô Dexter Lawrence told The Post. ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt feel any tension, he says there‚Äôs no tension. He said the only thing they argue about is a slice of pizza .‚Äô‚Äô You want dysfunction? Recall how Joe Judge and his offensive line coach, Marc Colombo, nearly came to blows in Judge‚Äôs office . You want dysfunction? Judge and the general manager, Dave Gettleman, basically ignored each other down the stretch of the 2021 season ‚Äî a situation that ownership never should have tolerated. Daboll, 48, is demanding and believes in direct communication. He does not let things fester. He is aggressive in his fact-finding missions. Thin-skinned individuals will not do well in his sphere of influence. Despite a few hiccups, Martindale‚Äôs defense has far outperformed the mostly-feeble offense. He is 60 years old and has made no secret of his desire to be an NFL head coach. The Giants made the playoffs in his first year in the New York/New Jersey media market and Martindale received plenty of credit for the turnaround ‚Äî but only one interview (Colts) for a head-coaching position. Time is not on his side, with the Giants destined to watch this season‚Äôs postseason action from home. That can breed tension, too.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:22:48","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-7me201o9l-1701917764757.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1701899797","source_id":"nypost","source_priority":109,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8446795d7eef4e1c86a0873f0cce4bc2","title":"–¢–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ ‚Äî –æ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–µ –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª: ¬´–í –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ 30 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ —É ¬´–ú–Æ¬ª –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å¬ª","link":"https://www.sport-express.ru/football/england/news/glavnyy-trener-manchester-yunayted-erik-ten-hag-prokommentiroval-pobedu-nad-chelsi-2154554/","keywords":["–§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª - –ê–Ω–≥–ª–∏—è"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –≠—Ä–∏–∫ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—É –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª (2:1) –≤ 15-–º —Ç—É—Ä–µ –ê–ü–õ.","content":"–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –≠—Ä–∏–∫ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—É –Ω–∞–¥ ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª (2:1) –≤ 15-–º —Ç—É—Ä–µ –ê–ü–õ. ¬´–£ –º–µ–Ω—è –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –ø—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∑–∏–∏, –Ω–æ –º—ã –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–º –∏ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–π. –í –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ 30 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª–µ —É –Ω–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å. –ù–æ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –≥–æ–ª. –ú—ã –≤—ã–∫–ª—é—á–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∏–∑ –∏–≥—Ä—ã. –ù–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è. –ú—ã –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–º—Å—è –≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏. –ú–∞–∫—Ç–æ–º–∏–Ω–µ–π –æ—á–µ–Ω—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫. –û–Ω –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª ¬´–ß–µ–ª—Å–∏¬ª –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ —Å –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏. –û–Ω –∑–∞–±–∏–ª –¥–≤–∞ –≥–æ–ª–∞ –∏ –º–æ–≥ –±—ã –∑–∞–±–∏—Ç—å –µ—â–µ¬ª, ‚Äî –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ —Ç–µ–Ω –•–∞–≥–∞ –í–í–°. ¬´–ú–∞–Ω—á–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥¬ª –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞–ª 27 –æ—á–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –ø–æ–¥–Ω—è–ª—Å—è –Ω–∞ 6-–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –≤ —Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–Ω–æ–π —Ç–∞–±–ª–∏—Ü–µ.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:20:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"sport_express","source_priority":81120,"country":["russia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"russian"},{"article_id":"35b77d07f5af5598aeb8888c238be42c","title":"New coach Jon Poppe sets Ivy League title goal for Columbia","link":"https://nypost.com/2023/12/06/sports/new-coach-jon-poppe-sets-ivy-league-title-goal-for-columbia/","keywords":null,"creator":["Miles Schachner"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jon Poppe spoke of promises to fulfill, goals to reach and a culture to build, but made one thing clear: he was hired to bring Columbia a championship.","content":"Columbia football has a new coach ‚Äî and he brings a reunion with lofty expectations. When an energetic, impassioned Jon Poppe approached the podium inside Columbia‚Äôs gymnasium on Wednesday, he spoke of promises to fulfill, goals to reach and a culture to build, but made one thing clear: he was hired to bring Columbia a championship. For a Columbia football program with a singular Ivy League title ‚Äî won back in 1961 ‚Äî championships are hard to come by. But Poppe, who spent three seasons at Columbia as a secondary coach and recruiting coordinator from 2015-17, appeared ready to accept that challenge. ‚ÄúWe will never be complacent,‚Äù Poppe said. ‚ÄúThe hunger is always going to exist. We‚Äôre going to focus on recruiting efforts on the best and brightest. ‚Ä¶ We want young people here that desire to be challenged.‚Äù The 38-year-old New Jersey native returns to Morningside Heights after successful stints at Harvard as a secondary and special teams coach and one year as a head coach at Union College. Poppe led the Garnet Chargers to a 10-2 record and the second round of the Division III Tournament last season, adding four wins to the team‚Äôs record and earning him a look when the Columbia job became available. He succeeds interim head coach Mark Fabish, a former offensive coordinator who stepped into the head-coaching role unexpectedly in 2023 when Al Bagnoli, a nine-time Ivy champion, retired six weeks before the season opener due to health concerns. Bagnoli, who served as a head coach for 40 years and compiled 274 wins, was coaxed out of retirement in 2015 to resurrect a Columbia program that had finished winless in consecutive seasons. \"You can make history here.\" ‚Äì @Coach_Poppe #RoarLionRoar // #OnlyHere üóΩü¶Å pic.twitter.com/TgTtKBVx7Y He did just that, the team‚Äôs best season during his tenure coming in 2017 when the Lions went 8-2 and came within one win of a sought-after conference championship. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come close here in my time,‚Äù Poppe, who helped recruit members of the 2017 team, said. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes the football bounces a funny way. So hopefully we‚Äôre preparing our young men right in practice, to get that ball to bounce the right way. We‚Äôve got to get Lady Karma on our side, that‚Äôs a big part of football sometimes.‚Äù Poppe inherits a team that stumbled during a transitional 2023 campaign, posting a 1-6 Ivy League record for its worst year since 2015. Fortunately for Columbia, Poppe has reached the Ivy League mountaintop before. During Poppe‚Äôs initial three-year stint at Harvard from 2011-14, the Crimson took home three conference championships as he led its secondary and special teams groups. Now, Columbia will look to Poppe to take the school where it hasn‚Äôt been in over 60 years.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:15:22","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/newspress-collage-qlbn0aru3-1701916253235.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1701898288","source_id":"nypost","source_priority":109,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"19398ad7cc65358996ac0ea4eaf5d2e7","title":"L‚ÄôOM enfonce Lyon sur fond de protestations des groupes de supporteurs","link":"https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2023/12/07/l-om-enfonce-lyon-sur-fond-de-protestations-des-groupes-de-supporteurs_6204287_3242.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Report√©e apr√®s les incidents du 29 octobre, la rencontre de mercredi a √©t√© marqu√©e par un festival offensif phoc√©en (3-0) et un d√©but de grogne des ultras marseillais contre les interdictions de d√©placement.","content":"Cette fois, le match entre l‚ÄôOlympique de Marseille (OM) et l‚ÄôOlympique lyonnais (OL) version 2023-2024 a bien eu lieu. Report√©e le 29 octobre, apr√®s les attaques par des supporteurs marseillais de plusieurs bus des visiteurs, dont celui transportant les joueurs de l‚ÄôOL, la rencontre entre ces deux rivaux historiques du championnat de France s‚Äôest tenue sans incident, mercredi 6 d√©cembre, au Stade-V√©lodrome, √† Marseille. Mais elle marque aussi le d√©but d‚Äôune grogne du milieu ultra, qui s‚Äôoppose √† la volont√© des pouvoirs publics d‚Äôinterdire temporairement tout d√©placement lors de matches class√©s ¬´ √† risque ¬ª par la division nationale de lutte contre le hooliganisme. Devant 54 238 spectateurs, qui ont quitt√© l‚Äôenceinte ravis, l‚ÄôOM s‚Äôest impos√©e facilement (3-0) , mercredi. L‚Äô√©quipe signe ainsi sa troisi√®me victoire d‚Äôaffil√©e en autant de sorties sur sa pelouse, et a disput√©, de l‚Äôavis g√©n√©ral, son meilleur match de la saison. Avec deux passes d√©cisives et un but, l‚Äôattaquant Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang confirme son renouveau ; apr√®s ses quatre buts en deux rencontres, la recrue phare de l‚Äôintersaison de l‚ÄôOM, bien aid√©e par la pr√©sence du Portugais Vitinha ‚Äì un but, une passe d√©cisive ‚Äî titularis√© √† ses c√¥t√©s, a fait taire les sifflets qui l‚Äôavaient accueilli une semaine plus t√¥t lors de la confrontation contre l‚ÄôAjax d‚ÄôAmsterdam en Ligue Europa. ¬´ On ne doit pas croire qu‚Äôon a tout r√©solu ¬ª, a relativis√© l‚Äôentra√Æneur marseillais, l‚ÄôItalien Gennaro Gattuso, apr√®s la rencontre, rappelant que son √©quipe avait pein√© dans les matches pr√©c√©dents. L‚Äô√©quipe lyonnaise, elle, poursuit son annus horribilis . La pr√©sence sur le banc de l‚ÄôOL de Pierre Sage, entra√Æneur int√©rimaire , n‚Äôa rien chang√© aux errements d‚Äôune formation inoffensive et fragile d√©fensivement. ¬´ Nous avons √©t√© en non-ma√Ætrise tout au long du match ¬ª, a reconnu le coach lyonnais. Avec sept points en quatorze matches, l‚ÄôOL se tra√Æne en queue de classement et semble, plus que jamais, sous la menace d‚Äôune rel√©gation en Ligue 2. ¬´ Nous avons conscience d‚Äô√™tre en danger ¬ª, confirme Pierre Sage. Ce match entre Marseille et Lyon n‚Äôa pas √©t√© un sommet de football. Mais il √©tait surtout scrut√© pour ses √†-c√¥t√©s. Le contexte de ces retrouvailles, pesant depuis l‚Äôannulation du premier face-√†-face, s‚Äôest encore alourdi avec la mort, dimanche, d‚Äôun supporteur nantais , poignard√© par un chauffeur de VTC en amont de la rencontre entre Nantes et Nice. Mercredi, l‚Äôarriv√©e du bus de l‚ÄôOL √©tait s√ªrement la plus attendue de la saison en Ligue 1. A 19 h 30, pr√©c√©d√© de motards, d‚Äôune voiture et de deux fourgons de police, le v√©hicule transportant les joueurs et le staff technique lyonnais, un autocar classique lou√© √† un transporteur vauclusien, a p√©n√©tr√© dans les entrailles du Stade-V√©lodrome. ¬´ Sans incident ¬ª, a pr√©cis√© la pr√©fecture de police, qui avait mobilis√© pr√®s de 700 policiers et gendarmes pour √©viter tout d√©bordement. Un v√©hicule blind√© avec un canon √† eau tr√¥nait m√™me √† l‚Äôentr√©e du stade alors que des drones surplombaient la sc√®ne.","pubDate":"2023-12-07 03:15:15","image_url":"https://img.lemde.fr/2023/12/06/1347/0/8078/4039/644/322/60/0/b36ac77_1dea1d613c054911ab059df855c785ed-0-035f492235a345d09d6eb0d9c7b4f344.jpg","source_id":"lemonde","source_priority":12566,"country":["france"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french"},{"article_id":"4ee668543e1d1346c57cde7e64e6d822","title":"Teen spirit drives Brisbane Roar towards ALM nirvana","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/soccer/teen-spirit-drives-brisbane-roar-towards-alm-nirvana-c-12819212","keywords":null,"creator":["Joel Gould"],"video_url":null,"description":"Brisbane Roar coach Ross Aloisi has given A-League debuts to teenagers Tom Waddingham, Shae Cahill, Quinn MacNicol and Rylan Brownlie this season.","content":"Brisbane Roar coach Ross Aloisi has an \"if you are good enough, you are old enough\" philosophy about picking young players and it is an ethos he is putting into practice.

They were a little bit more aggressive than us,\" he added. \"But we were competitive because we made chances and maybe enough to draw the game. But when the result is 2-1 you get nothing. I think we need to be calm and keep going, trying to help the players to be ready for Sunday.\" Chelsea, who are 10th in the league with 19 points from 15 games, visit Everton on Sunday.
