But Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson is still going to have a crack at it. The Cup of Nations is here, and while there‚Äôs a trophy up for grabs, the truth is it‚Äôs meaningless. This is simply a series of friendlies dressed up as a tournament. The winners won‚Äôt be out getting tattoos to commemorate the achievement. This trophy is meaningless - but what it represents is huge for the Matildas and coach Tony Gustavsson. Credit: Getty But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important. Gustavsson and the Matildas, who face Czechia on Thursday night at Industree Group Stadium, are approaching it as a dress rehearsal for the Women‚Äôs World Cup in every conceivable way - from the three teams they‚Äôll face which were hand-picked to best replicate the attributes of their Group B opponents, to the way they‚Äôll play and even the timing, location and identity of the players who will be made available for their pre-match media commitments. Gustavsson joked he might even practice parts of the speech he‚Äôll give the team before they face Ireland at Accor Stadium on July 20. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spent two years now talking about, you know how I always say, ‚ÄòOne day better‚Äô? This is now training tournament football,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeaning, how do we prepare, how do we win against Czech Republic [if it was] an opening game in a group stage? [That] is going to replicate what we‚Äôre going to talk about when we play Ireland. ‚ÄúEverything we do now is like a World Cup rehearsal. It doesn‚Äôt mean the focus is only on winning in that sense, but we need to train tournament format - how we close that game out and quickly check into something completely different tactically against Spain, and then the same thing [against Jamaica].‚Äù If nothing else, it will be an excellent measure of where the Matildas really sit after a rocky 2022 which began with a poor Asian Cup, hit the skids after concerning losses to Spain, Portugal and Canada, and then improved markedly with a series of impressive friendly performances in October and November.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 07:05:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Pique: Why I Have Not Contacted Messi","link":"https://www.snl24.com/soccerladuma/International/Messi-Ronaldo-Neymar-Mbappe-watch/gerard-pique-why-i-have-not-contacted-lionel-messi-since-2022-fifa-world-cup-win-20230215","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ex-Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has revealed why he has not contacted Lionel Messi to congratulate him for winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina.","content":"Ex-Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has revealed why he has not contacted Lionel Messi to congratulate him for winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina. After the forward left the Catalan giants as a free agent in 2021, rumours suggested that his relationship with Pique had broken down due to the Spaniard's stance over his exit. Spanish publications claimed the since-retired defender had told president Joan Laporta that Messi leaving would not impact the team negatively, with the club chief later deciding against a contract renewal for the Blaugrana's all-time leading goalscorer. Messi and Pique came through the ranks of La Masia together before eventually developing into key players for Barcelona‚Äôs senior team after the Spaniard returned to the Camp Nou following a brief stint at Manchester United. In a recent interview, Pique appeared to hint that their feud is still ongoing when he was asked if he had got in touch with his ex-colleague since his World Cup victory in December. \"Not really. I was, and this is crazy but it is true, I didn't watch any game,\" he said in an interview with social media personality John Nellis, according to . \"Just the final, not the whole game.

We will not make any further comment until that process is complete.‚Äù In an update reported on by The Daily Star , the internal probe will apparently could go on for several more months, and all signs suggest that there is no chance Greenwood will be considered for selection this season. The 21-year-old remains contracted to United until the middle of 2025, but has not played for the Red Devils since January 22 last year.

It‚Äôs one of the biggest clubs in the world. They need to make a statement and letting him back would be the worst thing they could do.

Greenwood has since remained under ongoing investigation for the better part of the last year. However, a Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson explained at the start of 2023 why charges had been dropped. ‚ÄúWe have a duty to keep cases under continuous review. In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case. ‚ÄúWe have explained our decision to all parties. ‚ÄòWe would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.‚Äù In a short statement released on his behalf, Greenwood commented: ‚ÄúI am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support.

But Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson is still going to have a crack at it. The Cup of Nations is here, and while there‚Äôs a trophy up for grabs, the truth is it‚Äôs meaningless. This is simply a series of friendlies dressed up as a tournament. The winners won‚Äôt be out getting tattoos to commemorate the achievement. This trophy is meaningless - but what it represents is huge for the Matildas and coach Tony Gustavsson. Credit: Getty But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important. Gustavsson and the Matildas, who face Czechia on Thursday night at Industree Group Stadium, are approaching it as a dress rehearsal for the Women‚Äôs World Cup in every conceivable way - from the three teams they‚Äôll face which were hand-picked to best replicate the attributes of their Group B opponents, to the way they‚Äôll play and even the timing, location and identity of the players who will be made available for their pre-match media commitments. Gustavsson joked he might even practice parts of the speech he‚Äôll give the team before they face Ireland at Accor Stadium on July 20. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spent two years now talking about, you know how I always say, ‚ÄòOne day better‚Äô? This is now training tournament football,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeaning, how do we prepare, how do we win against Czech Republic [if it was] an opening game in a group stage? [That] is going to replicate what we‚Äôre going to talk about when we play Ireland. ‚ÄúEverything we do now is like a World Cup rehearsal. It doesn‚Äôt mean the focus is only on winning in that sense, but we need to train tournament format - how we close that game out and quickly check into something completely different tactically against Spain, and then the same thing [against Jamaica].‚Äù If nothing else, it will be an excellent measure of where the Matildas really sit after a rocky 2022 which began with a poor Asian Cup, hit the skids after concerning losses to Spain, Portugal and Canada, and then improved markedly with a series of impressive friendly performances in October and November.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 07:05:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Pique: Why I Have Not Contacted Messi","link":"https://www.snl24.com/soccerladuma/International/Messi-Ronaldo-Neymar-Mbappe-watch/gerard-pique-why-i-have-not-contacted-lionel-messi-since-2022-fifa-world-cup-win-20230215","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ex-Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has revealed why he has not contacted Lionel Messi to congratulate him for winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina.","content":"Ex-Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has revealed why he has not contacted Lionel Messi to congratulate him for winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina. After the forward left the Catalan giants as a free agent in 2021, rumours suggested that his relationship with Pique had broken down due to the Spaniard's stance over his exit. Spanish publications claimed the since-retired defender had told president Joan Laporta that Messi leaving would not impact the team negatively, with the club chief later deciding against a contract renewal for the Blaugrana's all-time leading goalscorer. Messi and Pique came through the ranks of La Masia together before eventually developing into key players for Barcelona‚Äôs senior team after the Spaniard returned to the Camp Nou following a brief stint at Manchester United. In a recent interview, Pique appeared to hint that their feud is still ongoing when he was asked if he had got in touch with his ex-colleague since his World Cup victory in December. \"Not really.

However, it still remains to be seen what actions United will take, with the only statement to date reading as follows: ‚ÄúThe club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps. We will not make any further comment until that process is complete.‚Äù In an update reported on by The Daily Star , the internal probe will apparently could go on for several more months, and all signs suggest that there is no chance Greenwood will be considered for selection this season. The 21-year-old remains contracted to United until the middle of 2025, but has not played for the Red Devils since January 22 last year. It‚Äôs expected that the club will now interview Greenwood to ascertain his version of events and will also get specialists in to assess his mental and physical state. ALSO READ | FINALLY SOME GOOD INJURY NEWS FOR KAIZER CHIEFS It‚Äôs also been reported that United manager Erik Ten Hag got in touch with the youngster over the phone after the case was dropped. ‚ÄúThe manager enquired how he was feeling physically and mentally and said he was pleased the charges had been dropped,‚Äù a source told The Sun High-profile football publication, The Athletic , recently approached several female supporters to find out their views on any possible return for Greenwood, with the publication stating that ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs voices have been largely absent‚Äù during this story. Natalie Burrell, the founder of United Women‚Äôs Supporters‚Äô Club made her position clear: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he should play again for Manchester United. It‚Äôs one of the biggest clubs in the world. They need to make a statement and letting him back would be the worst thing they could do. It would set our club back in terms of what we‚Äôre trying to do with our women‚Äôs team and campaigns like Her Game Too which are trying to encourage women to play and watch football.‚Äù ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to see him training. I don‚Äôt want to see him in a [United] kit. I don‚Äôt want to see him ever coming out at Old Trafford again.‚Äù Another die-heard fan, named Gina, said there was no doubt about what the club should do: ‚ÄúWhile ‚Äòcharges dropped‚Äô is not conclusive either way, if there is any doubt from United that he is guilty of these allegations then I do not feel he should play for United, or any other club, again.‚Äù A third fan, 33-year-old Kaydee, echoed these sentiments. ‚ÄúThey definitely shouldn‚Äôt have him back ‚Äì not after how far the game has come to promote women. It‚Äôs just not acceptable and a club like United should know better.‚Äù READ | MASON GREENWOOD COMMENTS AFTER RAPE CHARGES DROPPED GREENWOOD HAS STILL BEEN BANKING A SIGNIFICANT SALARY FROM UNITED Towards the end of June, it was confirmed that Greenwood had his police bail extended once again as investigations continued after damning videos and images came to light on the social media account of former girlfriend Harriet Robson . Greenwood has since remained under ongoing investigation for the better part of the last year. However, a Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson explained at the start of 2023 why charges had been dropped. ‚ÄúWe have a duty to keep cases under continuous review. In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case. ‚ÄúWe have explained our decision to all parties. ‚ÄòWe would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.‚Äù In a short statement released on his behalf, Greenwood commented: ‚ÄúI am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support. There will be no further comment at this time.‚Äù Increasingly it appeared that his future with Manchester United would be viewed as untenable, but it now remains to be seen what stance the club will take.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 06:29:49","image_url":"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/wp-content/themes/jnews-child/assets/images/normal.jpeg.optimal.jpeg","source_id":"thesouthafrican","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã 1-0 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ","link":"https://www.khaskhabar.com/sports/football-news/sports-news-ac-milan-beat-spurs-1-0-in-the-champions-league-news-hindi-1-543625-KKN.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã 1-0 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ","content":"‡§∞‡•ã‡§Æ‡•§ ‡§á‡§ü‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§è‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§à‡§è‡§´‡§è ‡§ö‡•à‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ó ‡§∞‡§æ‡§â‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ë‡§´ 16 ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§ö‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ü‡•â‡§ü‡§®‡§π‡•à‡§Æ ‡§π‡•â‡§ü‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã 1-0 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä, ‡§ú‡§ø‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ú ‡§®‡•á 7‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ó‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ 2013-2014 ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ú‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§™‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ö‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡§æ ‡§®‡•â‡§ï‡§Ü‡§â‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§•‡§æ‡•§ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§á‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ó‡§®‡§®, ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§¨‡•á‡§®‡•á‡§∏‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§ü‡§® ‡§á‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡§æ ‡§∏‡•à‡§® ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ‡•§ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§°‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§™‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï ‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§•‡•Ä‡•§ ‡§ö‡•ã‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ó‡•ã ‡§≤‡•ã‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ó‡•ã ‡§¨‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§®‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ ‡§µ‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç, ‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§∞‡•á-‡§è‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ú‡§¨‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ‡•§ ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§≤‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ã, ‡§∞‡•â‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§¢‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä 1-0 ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§§ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§è ‡§∞‡§ñ‡•Ä, ‡§ú‡§¨‡§ï‡§ø ‡§ü‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡§®‡§π‡•à‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§° ‡§π‡•à‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á‡§® ‡§∏‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§ú‡•á‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡§Ç‡§§‡§∞ ‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§•‡•á‡•§ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§™‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§∞‡§£ 8 ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡§®‡§π‡§Æ ‡§π‡•â‡§ü‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ú‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ --‡§Ü‡§à‡§è‡§è‡§®‡§è‡§∏","pubDate":"2023-02-15 06:25:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"khaskhabar","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Main Siya Stories","link":"https://www.snl24.com/soccerladuma/Local/main-siya-stories-20230214-233","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Soccer Laduma‚Äôs latest edition, issue 1311, is out on the shelves with our exclusive Siyagobhoza.","content":"Soccer Laduma‚Äôs latest edition, issue 1311, is out on the shelves with our exclusive Siyagobhoza.

But Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson is still going to have a crack at it. The Cup of Nations is here, and while there‚Äôs a trophy up for grabs, the truth is it‚Äôs meaningless. This is simply a series of friendlies dressed up as a tournament. The winners won‚Äôt be out getting tattoos to commemorate the achievement. This trophy is meaningless - but what it represents is huge for the Matildas and coach Tony Gustavsson. Credit: Getty But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important. Gustavsson and the Matildas, who face Czechia on Thursday night at Industree Group Stadium, are approaching it as a dress rehearsal for the Women‚Äôs World Cup in every conceivable way - from the three teams they‚Äôll face which were hand-picked to best replicate the attributes of their Group B opponents, to the way they‚Äôll play and even the timing, location and identity of the players who will be made available for their pre-match media commitments. Gustavsson joked he might even practice parts of the speech he‚Äôll give the team before they face Ireland at Accor Stadium on July 20. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spent two years now talking about, you know how I always say, ‚ÄòOne day better‚Äô? This is now training tournament football,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeaning, how do we prepare, how do we win against Czech Republic [if it was] an opening game in a group stage? [That] is going to replicate what we‚Äôre going to talk about when we play Ireland. ‚ÄúEverything we do now is like a World Cup rehearsal. It doesn‚Äôt mean the focus is only on winning in that sense, but we need to train tournament format - how we close that game out and quickly check into something completely different tactically against Spain, and then the same thing [against Jamaica].‚Äù If nothing else, it will be an excellent measure of where the Matildas really sit after a rocky 2022 which began with a poor Asian Cup, hit the skids after concerning losses to Spain, Portugal and Canada, and then improved markedly with a series of impressive friendly performances in October and November.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 07:05:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Pique: Why I Have Not Contacted Messi","link":"https://www.snl24.com/soccerladuma/International/Messi-Ronaldo-Neymar-Mbappe-watch/gerard-pique-why-i-have-not-contacted-lionel-messi-since-2022-fifa-world-cup-win-20230215","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ex-Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has revealed why he has not contacted Lionel Messi to congratulate him for winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina.","content":"Ex-Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has revealed why he has not contacted Lionel Messi to congratulate him for winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Argentina. After the forward left the Catalan giants as a free agent in 2021, rumours suggested that his relationship with Pique had broken down due to the Spaniard's stance over his exit. Spanish publications claimed the since-retired defender had told president Joan Laporta that Messi leaving would not impact the team negatively, with the club chief later deciding against a contract renewal for the Blaugrana's all-time leading goalscorer. Messi and Pique came through the ranks of La Masia together before eventually developing into key players for Barcelona‚Äôs senior team after the Spaniard returned to the Camp Nou following a brief stint at Manchester United. In a recent interview, Pique appeared to hint that their feud is still ongoing when he was asked if he had got in touch with his ex-colleague since his World Cup victory in December. \"Not really. I was, and this is crazy but it is true, I didn't watch any game,\" he said in an interview with social media personality John Nellis, according to . \"Just the final, not the whole game.

We will not make any further comment until that process is complete.‚Äù In an update reported on by The Daily Star , the internal probe will apparently could go on for several more months, and all signs suggest that there is no chance Greenwood will be considered for selection this season. The 21-year-old remains contracted to United until the middle of 2025, but has not played for the Red Devils since January 22 last year.

Greenwood has since remained under ongoing investigation for the better part of the last year. However, a Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson explained at the start of 2023 why charges had been dropped. ‚ÄúWe have a duty to keep cases under continuous review. In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case. ‚ÄúWe have explained our decision to all parties. ‚ÄòWe would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.‚Äù In a short statement released on his behalf, Greenwood commented: ‚ÄúI am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support. There will be no further comment at this time.‚Äù Increasingly it appeared that his future with Manchester United would be viewed as untenable, but it now remains to be seen what stance the club will take.","pubDate":"2023-02-15 06:29:49","image_url":"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/wp-content/themes/jnews-child/assets/images/normal.jpeg.optimal.jpeg","source_id":"thesouthafrican","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã 1-0 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ","link":"https://www.khaskhabar.com/sports/football-news/sports-news-ac-milan-beat-spurs-1-0-in-the-champions-league-news-hindi-1-543625-KKN.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã 1-0 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ","content":"‡§∞‡•ã‡§Æ‡•§ ‡§á‡§ü‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§è‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§à‡§è‡§´‡§è ‡§ö‡•à‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ó ‡§∞‡§æ‡§â‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ë‡§´ 16 ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§ö‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ü‡•â‡§ü‡§®‡§π‡•à‡§Æ ‡§π‡•â‡§ü‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã 1-0 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä, ‡§ú‡§ø‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ú ‡§®‡•á 7‡§µ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ó‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ 2013-2014 ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ú‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§™‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ö‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡§æ ‡§®‡•â‡§ï‡§Ü‡§â‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§•‡§æ‡•§ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§á‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ó‡§®‡§®, ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§¨‡•á‡§®‡•á‡§∏‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§ü‡§® ‡§á‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡§æ ‡§∏‡•à‡§® ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ‡•§ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§°‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§™‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï ‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§•‡•Ä‡•§ ‡§ö‡•ã‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ó‡•ã ‡§≤‡•ã‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ó‡•ã ‡§¨‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§®‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ ‡§µ‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç, ‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§∞‡•á-‡§è‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ú‡§¨‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ‡•§ ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§≤‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ã, ‡§∞‡•â‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§¢‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä 1-0 ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§§ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§è ‡§∞‡§ñ‡•Ä, ‡§ú‡§¨‡§ï‡§ø ‡§ü‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡§®‡§π‡•à‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§° ‡§π‡•à‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á‡§® ‡§∏‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§ú‡•á‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡§Ç‡§§‡§∞ ‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§•‡•á‡•§ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§™‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§∞‡§£ 8 ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡§®‡§π‡§Æ ‡§π‡•â‡§ü‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ú‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ --‡§Ü‡§à‡§è‡§è‡§®‡§è‡§∏","pubDate":"2023-02-15 06:25:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"khaskhabar","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Main Siya Stories","link":"https://www.snl24.com/soccerladuma/Local/main-siya-stories-20230214-233","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Soccer Laduma‚Äôs latest edition, issue 1311, is out on the shelves with our exclusive Siyagobhoza.","content":"Soccer Laduma‚Äôs latest edition, issue 1311, is out on the shelves with our exclusive Siyagobhoza.
