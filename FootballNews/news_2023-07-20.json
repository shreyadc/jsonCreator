What an unbelievable day for both host nations of the 2023 Women’s World Cup. New Zealand absolutely stunned favourites Norway to claim a 1-0 victory in Auckland, after star forward Hannah Wilkinson scored just after half-time. It’s the Football Ferns first-ever World Cup victory, and they got to do it in front of 40,000 people - the biggest crowd to ever watch a football match in New Zealand. And then, the Matildas. It might not have gone exactly the way they wanted, but the Matildas walked away with a victory for their first match of the World Cup, in front of about 80,000 people. Steph Catley was an absolute superstar stepping in for Sam Kerr as captain, and Katrina Gorry was a machine taking on a very physical Katie McCabe.

Credit: Getty Images 8.50pm Player ratings: How the Matildas stacked-up By Vince Rugari and Emma Kemp Mackenzie Arnold - 7.5 - Didn’t have much to do in the way of blocking shots, but was supremely confident when called upon, particularly in collecting aerial balls during Ireland’s second-half rally, and made a terrific low, late save to deny Lucy Quinn at the death. Steph Catley - 8 - Assured in defence and led the way in regular skipper Sam Kerr’s absence. When the penalty was given, she was the one who wanted it, and that confidence came through in her delivery. Clare Hunt - 7 - It remains absolutely mind-boggling that she had never played international football prior to February. It’s been said before, but it looks like she’s been doing this for a decade. Rock-solid, if a little jagged with the ball at her feet sometimes. Alanna Kennedy - 7 - Built on her return from injury last week with a performance just as outstanding. Technically sound and growing in partnership with Hunt. Ellie Carpenter - 6.5 - The divine ponytail rocketed up the right-hand flank all night long, but her touches were often too heavy, and she was occasionally caught wildly out of position at times during the second-half Irish siege. Katrina Gorry - 8.5 - Started with two divine tackles on Ruesha Littlejohn and Denise O’Sullivan intervened in the nick of time to save a would-be Ireland goal and was the focal point of Australia’s attacks throughout. Katrina Gorry was one of the Matildas’ best players in their vicotry over Ireland. Credit: Reuters Kyra Cooney-Cross 6.5 - not quite her usual fluent self but her delivery into the box which resulted in the penalty was one of the pivotal moments of the match. Hayley Raso - 7 - drew the Matildas’ penalty and well and truly held her own under some heavy physical pressure from Katie McCabe and other Ireland opponents. Super fast and smart cutting in. Cortnee Vine - 6 - A quiet shift given her recent form. Offered lightning pace early in the second half and a half chance but could not get through the Irish wall. Substituted with 15 minutes remaining for Emily van Egmond. Caitlin Foord - 6.5 - Down on her usual output, which is understandable given how much of the team’s plans had relied on her combination with Sam Kerr - but also not all her fault, because the Matildas struggled to generate many chances through the middle. Mary Fowler - 7 - Stepping into the enormous shoes of Sam Kerr would be a fiendishly difficult task for a normal 20-year-old. Fowler, however, was super cool throughout - if only a few other players had her ability to steer through tight spaces and keep the ball close. Substitutes: Emily van Egmond - 5 - Was on for 15 minutes but offered little. Clare Polkinghorne - N/A - Came on for the final five minutes as Tony Gustavsson stiffened up his back four into a back five. When she was needed, she was there. 8.37pm Australia’s victory in photos Advertisement 8.31pm Minus their ace, Matildas prove themselves a team in every sense of the word By Emma Kemp Thursday night and the lights are bright, and the mass is waiting for Sam Kerr.

Overtones and undertones. A creed to Sam Kerr. Sam Kerr celebrates with team members after their win. Credit: Edwina Pickles This World Cup has a face and it has a name. Both are at the airport when you get off the plane. On street corners and train stations and Tiktok. The cameras are poised to record the highlight reels. Kerr is poised to score in Australia’s opening match, to send Ireland packing and the Matildas on their way. But now she is on Instagram, telling the world she will not. She is on the bench when she should be captaining her country. But you cannot backflip with an injured calf. Even the drums and chants of children and a sea of phone lights worshipping in the dark cannot fix that. Kerr still gives the pre-match team talk. Yesterday she still did the pre-match press conference, giving away no sign anything was awry. Her role here is to pep talk the huddle. Tell her team they can still win without her. That almost all of the 75,784 in attendance are here to see them, and that the Irish diaspora - in their flags and felt hats and rugby shirts - do not have a say. Still, they ask: who are the Matildas without Sam Kerr? You can read who they are here . 8.22pm Catley stands up for Matildas in win over Ireland What had been a note-perfect preparation for the Matildas was derailed in the worst possible way - their best player Sam Kerr ruled out with a calf injury suffered at training the day before.

Credit: Getty The energy at Stadium Australia shifted from a quiet confidence to crippling concern to, over the course of 51 and a half painful minutes, flat-out panic. Not just for this match, but the ones to come, and the team’s Women’s World Cup campaign at large. Those worries can wait. The first hurdle, at least, has been cleared after stand-in skipper Steph Catley’s second-half penalty secured a precious 1-0 win over Ireland at a jam-packed Stadium Australia. It wasn’t pretty. But it was enough. Read the full match report from Vince Rugari here . 8.12pm Plenty for Matildas to work on before clash with Nigeria It was a nervous first victory for Australia, who were strongly tipped to overrun Ireland. The loss of Sam Kerr before the game couldn’t have been easy, but they managed to hang on in the end. Coach Tony Gustavsson will be relieved to get that first game out of the way, but there’s a lot to work on before they have their second match against Nigeria next Thursday. As for Ireland, they were strong in defence - Australia scored their only goal from a penalty because the five-person defensive line was so hard to break through. They play Olympic champions Canada next, another tough task for the team who are in their first World Cup. Matildas’ coach Tony Gustavsson congratulates players after the game.

Australia's campaign suffered a hammer blow when Kerr was ruled out of Thursday's night's game and the subsequent game against Nigeria with a calf injury suffered in Wednesday's final training session. According to Football Australia, the Chelsea striker will be assessed after the Matildas' second group B game against Nigeria in Brisbane on July 27. Vice-captain Catley wore the armband and stepped up in the 52nd minute to take a penalty after Hayley Raso was brought down, coolly dispatching the winning spot-kick into the top corner to send Stadium Australia into raptures. The sellout crowd of 75,784 was a new Matildas record on home soil. Australia have won their opening game of the World Cup with a gutsy 1-0 victory Steph Catley scored the match-winning penalty in the second half for the Matildas The stand-in captain celebrates after putting away her spot kick in Sydney Mary Fowler replaced Kerr in Australia's starting line-up against Ireland and was the only change to the team that beat France 1-0 in Melbourne in the final warm up. Caitlin Foord led Australia's attack in Kerr's absence. Coach Tony Gustavsson opted for Alanna Kennedy to pair with Clare Hunt in the centre of defence instead of veteran Clare Polkinghorne. As expected, Ireland parked the bus, playing five at the back and giving the Australians a green wall of players to get through. For more than 45 minutes, it worked. The Matildas probed early without reward, struggling to break down the Irish and taking some nervous-looking loose touches. Katrina Gorry was everywhere, controlling the game from midfield, while Raso's frantic energy and pace kept Ireland on their toes and she had a fiery battle with Irish skipper Katie McCabe. Australia's best early chance arrived in the 27th minute when Raso nodded a Catley cross just wide, while Foord hit the side netting eight minutes later. Australia broke through when Kyra Cooney-Cross lifted a diagonal ball into the penalty box and in the chaos, Marissa Sheva bundled over Raso. Foord initially picked up the ball but handed it off to Catley, who made no mistake in converting the penalty. Fowler, Foord and Gorry had good chances to add to the lead but couldn't put them away. The hosts endured a frustrating first half with Ireland defending resolutely Hayley Raso aims a header towards goal as Australia searched for the opening strike Raso grimaces after going down injured during the Group B match on Thursday Australia looked nervous as Ireland pressed for an equaliser late but held their nerve. McCabe sent in a dangerous corner in the 71st that Mackenzie Arnold punched to safety and three minutes later, Denise O'Sullivan sent a shot way over the bar. Arnold made a last ditch save late in extra time to save Australia's lead. Share or comment on this article: Australia 1-0 Ireland: No Sam Kerr? No problem!

'Certainly motherhood has not blunted her competitive instincts, that's for sure,' Seven commentator David Basheer said as the Matildas midfielder won a tackle. 'She is one fighter for Australia.' Katryna Gorry (left) stared for the Matildas in their World Cup opener against Ireland The remark was met with a backlash fans watching the game on TV. 'As we celebrate women in sport and continue to argue for equality what type of archaic commentary is this, Channel 7?,' a viewer wrote, while another described the comment as 'disgraceful'. A third, meanwhile, questioned whether the same remark would have been made about a man footballer becoming a father. 'Would you say this about a male/dad football player? Stop stereotyping mothers.' The combative midfielder is a mother-of-one to daughter Harper , who will shortly turn two. Gorry, affectionately known as 'Mini', gave birth to her daughter solo via IVF , before making a stunning return to football. Viewers slammed David Basheer's comment as 'archaic' on social media Others questioned whether the remark would have been made about a male footballer The 94-cap veteran felt the time was right to become a mother when the coronavirus pandemic forced the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed by 12 months to July 2021. At the time, the Matildas star was playing in Norway for Avaldsnes when she decided to have IVF treatment in the country, while the world came to a standstill because of the pandemic. As a result, she does not know the identity of Harper's father as fertility clinics in Norway do not disclose the identity of the donors. Last month, Gorry announced her engagement to fellow footballer Clara Markstedt . The pair met while playing at Swedish club Vittsjö, and got together last year, with Matildas teammates Charlotte Grant and Tegan Micah taking up baby-sitting duties while the romance blossomed.

Crawley riding his luck Zak Crawley has led a fortunate existence at Old Trafford but his partnership with Moeen Ali has England off to a sound start at lunch on day two in their pursuit of Australia’s 317. After Ben Duckett edged Mitchell Starc, Crawley was beaten on numerous occasions by Starc and Josh Hazlewood, edging the latter just short of David Warner in the slips. He was also given lbw by Joel Wilson to Cameron Green, only for HawkEye to predict the ball would have missed leg stump - how Green would have wished for a similar ball-tracking verdict on the previous afternoon. Moeen played attractively, meanwhile, raising his 3000 runs in Test cricket. Lunch Good session for England, who make it to the interval on 1/61, chasing 317. The unlikely first-wicket pair of Zak Crawley and Moeen Ali have added 52 after the early loss of Ben Duckett to Mitchell Starc. If the trend of this series is any guide, I expect Australia to land some blows after lunch to tighten it up. The session belonged to England, who claimed two wickets for the addition of 19 runs. They are marginally ahead in the game. Rare milestone for Moeen Ali Moeen Ali joins a very exclusive club in English cricket. He’s just the fifth man to score 3000 runs and take 200 wickets. He follows in the footsteps of Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Stuart Broad. Ben Stokes is likely to the be fifth. He’s on 197 wickets, having already scored in excess of 6000 Test runs. Wicket overturned Zak Crawley escapes. The review goes England’s way. The Australians thought Cameron Green had Zak Crawley trapped in front but the England opener sends it upstairs. It’s a smart call. Ball-tracker had it missing leg stump. It may have been a bit high as well. Green will be smarting after the way he went out yesterday. Double change - Green time This is an important bowling change from the perspective of Australia’s selections. Cameron Green is into the attack. He was a line-ball call ahead of Todd Murphy. The big all-rounder made 16 with the bat, so selectors need him to make an impact with the ball. I’m backing him in. Cummins into the attack For the first time this innings, it’s Pat Cummins into the attack. And he almost strikes first-up. Zak Crawley nearly chops on. Crawley and Moeen Ali have done well against the new ball - but they will need to be on guard against the might of Cummins, who has a habit of making things happen against the flow of play. Ellyse Perry, you star We all know there’s another major sporting event on tonight involving Australia. Just so you don’t have to switch tabs, the Matildas are up 1-0, 62 minutes in. Steph Catley scored from the spot for the hosts. While I’m at it, we can’t let a football reference go without mentioning this wondergoal from Ellyse Perry at the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Twelve years on, I feel as if sports fans in this country don’t fully appreciate how big a feat it was by Perry to make it to the top of two sports. She will go down in history as one of the finest cricketers of her generation. Edge, and it doesn’t carry Josh Hazlewood’s generating some heat. He’s got one to rise sharply off a good length to Zak Crawley. The ball earlier, he found Crawley’s outside edge but it lands short of David Warner at first slip. Nice soft hands there eby Crawley. Good contest building.

Τέτοια θέματα στην σημερινή συνεδρίαση είναι τα υπ’ αρ. 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 (που είτε είναι το ίδιο με το θέμα 23, είτε η ΕΠΟ δαπανά για υπηρεσίες φύλαξης τα μεγαλύτερα ποσά στην Ελλάδα!), 28, 29, 30, τα οποία ασφαλώς και δεν έχουν θέση σε οποιαδήποτε συζήτηση εφόσον δεν έχουν περιεχόμενο σαφές και εκ των προτέρων γνωστό στα Μέλη της Ε.Ε./ Ε.Π.Ο. Σε ό,τι αφορά στα υπόλοιπα θέματα της ΗΔ, επιχειρείται εκ της πλαγίας οδού (και ιδίως δια του θέματος 6) να εισαχθεί προς «έγκριση»/ «επικύρωση» η «ανανέωση των συμβάσεων των Μελών της ΚΕΔ που ολοκληρώνονται στις 31.07.2023» χωρίς να διευκρινίζεται ποια είναι τα Μέλη αυτά. Προσωπικά είμαι κάθετα αντίθετος στην ανανέωση οποιασδήποτε σύμβασης όταν δεν γνωρίζω ποια πρόσωπα συγκεκριμένα αφορά και όταν δεν προκύπτουν με σαφήνεια τα καθήκοντά τους. Παρά το Καταστατικό και χωρίς καμία αρμοδιότητα κ. Πρόεδρε «χρίσατε» τον κ. Στ. Μάνταλο «Αντιπρόεδρο» της ΚΕΔ όπως ο ίδιος ο Αρχιδιαιτητής κ. Benett προσδιόρισε την ιδιότητά του κατά την συνάντησή του με τους εκπροσώπους των ΠΑΕ της Superleague 1 τον περασμένο Μάρτιο. Εξίσου παρανόμως ο κ. Μάνταλος συμμετέχει στους ορισμούς των Διαιτητών του Επαγγελματικού Ποδοσφαίρου και έχει αναλάβει την επικοινωνία μαζί τους ή την εκπαίδευσή τους στα σεμινάρια, όπως και πάλι συνομολόγησε ο κ. Benett. Kι όλα αυτά όταν η θέση του στο οργανόγραμμα της ΚΕΔ συναρτάται μόνο με το ερασιτεχνικό ποδόσφαιρο. Σας ξεκαθαρίζω ότι δεν είμαι διατεθειμένος – εκπροσωπώντας τον μεγαλύτερο φορέα του Επαγγελματικού Ποδοσφαίρου στην Ελλάδα – να ανεχθώ «Μάνταλους» και «σκιώδεις αρχιδιαιτητές». Ούτε και πρόκειται να συναινέσω ποτέ σε συμβάσεις «Μάνταλων» και άλλων που αδιαφανώς διοικούν την ελληνική διαιτησία κρυπτόμενοι. Τέλος, μου προκαλεί αλγεινή εντύπωση το γεγονός ότι δεν υπάρχει στην ΗΔ καμία απολύτως αναφορά στο θέμα των ημερών που απασχολεί το σύνολο του ελληνικού ποδοσφαίρου και αφορά τις εν εξελίξει έρευνες για το κύκλωμα στοιχηματισμού και διαφθοράς που λυμαίνεται τα επαγγελματικά πρωταθλήματα. Η μόνη σπουδή της Ομοσπονδίας ήταν να εκδώσει μια «προσωπική» ανακοίνωση ο Πρόεδρος για να δείξει τα «αντανακλαστικά» του και να κάνει επίδειξη «αποφασιστικότητας». Σε αυτή μας ανακοίνωσε την πρόθεσή του να «εισηγηθεί» την αντιμετώπιση του παράνομου στοιχηματισμού με μεθόδους ανεδαφικές και επικίνδυνες. Ούτε λίγο ούτε πολύ ο Πρόεδρος της ΕΠΟ μας είπε ότι αν θέλει κάποιος μπορεί να πληρώσει και να χειραγωγήσει έναν αγώνα ελεύθερα. Είναι η πρώτη φορά και ίσως μοναδική στα παγκόσμια ποδοσφαιρικά πράγματα που τα φαινόμενα χειραγώγησης αντιμετωπίζονται με λογική «τιμοκαταλόγου». Για να μην αναφερθώ στο νομοθετικά ανεδαφικό κομμάτι των προτάσεών του που είναι αδύνατο να υλοποιηθούν σε οποιαδήποτε ευνομούμενη χώρα. Αντί ο Πρόεδρος της ΕΠΟ να αναλαμβάνει «πρωτοβουλίες» που «κανονικοποιούν» την παρανομία και που δεν έχουν κανέναν άλλο σκοπό παρά να παρεκτρέψουν την συζήτηση από το πραγματικό πρόβλημα (και ενδεχομένως να καθυστερήσουν την διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης….), καλύτερο θα ήταν να ζητήσει από τα δικαστικά όργανα της ΕΠΟ να επιταχύνουν την διαδικασία της εις βάθος εξέτασης του θέματος άμεσα και χωρίς καθυστερήσεις. Οι Δικαστές που απαρτίζουν την Επιτροπή Δεοντολογίας της ΕΠΟ είναι και έμπειροι και ικανοί και έχουν στην διάθεσή τους επαρκές νομικό οπλοστάσιο ώστε να δράσουν αποτελεσματικά. Αυτό που χρειάζεται είναι να κινηθούν πιο γρήγορα και όχι «κανονιστικές πρωτοβουλίες» που θα τους καθυστερήσουν περισσότερο. Θα περιμέναμε από την Ομοσπονδία να έχει ήδη ενεργήσει προκειμένου να διευκολυνθούν στο έργο τους, αλλά δυστυχώς φαίνεται πως για την ΕΠΟ η ταχύτατη διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης δεν είναι επιθυμητή και γι’ αυτό θα πρέπει να δοθούν επαρκείς εξηγήσεις. Η Superleague 1 θα πράξει κάθε τι απαραίτητο προκειμένου η υπόθεση αυτή να προχωρήσει με γοργούς ρυθμούς ώστε να εξαφανιστεί οποιαδήποτε σκιά πάνω από το επαγγελματικό ποδόσφαιρο. Τέλος, σας δηλώνω ότι επιφυλάσσομαι για κάθε νόμιμο δικαίωμα του Συνεταιρισμού έναντι οιασδήποτε απόφασης που είναι αντίθετη στις διατάξεις του Νόμου και του Καταστατικού και δύναται να βλάψει τα συμφέροντά μας.

What an unbelievable day for both host nations of the 2023 Women’s World Cup. New Zealand absolutely stunned favourites Norway to claim a 1-0 victory in Auckland, after star forward Hannah Wilkinson scored just after half-time. It’s the Football Ferns first-ever World Cup victory, and they got to do it in front of 40,000 people - the biggest crowd to ever watch a football match in New Zealand. And then, the Matildas. It might not have gone exactly the way they wanted, but the Matildas walked away with a victory for their first match of the World Cup, in front of about 80,000 people. Steph Catley was an absolute superstar stepping in for Sam Kerr as captain, and Katrina Gorry was a machine taking on a very physical Katie McCabe. Have a good rest of your night football fans, let’s do this again next Thursday when Australia takes on Nigeria. Fans watch the Matildas beat Ireland in Federation Square. Credit: Getty Images 8.50pm Player ratings: How the Matildas stacked-up By Vince Rugari and Emma Kemp Mackenzie Arnold - 7.5 - Didn’t have much to do in the way of blocking shots, but was supremely confident when called upon, particularly in collecting aerial balls during Ireland’s second-half rally, and made a terrific low, late save to deny Lucy Quinn at the death. Steph Catley - 8 - Assured in defence and led the way in regular skipper Sam Kerr’s absence. When the penalty was given, she was the one who wanted it, and that confidence came through in her delivery. Clare Hunt - 7 - It remains absolutely mind-boggling that she had never played international football prior to February. It’s been said before, but it looks like she’s been doing this for a decade. Rock-solid, if a little jagged with the ball at her feet sometimes. Alanna Kennedy - 7 - Built on her return from injury last week with a performance just as outstanding. Technically sound and growing in partnership with Hunt. Ellie Carpenter - 6.5 - The divine ponytail rocketed up the right-hand flank all night long, but her touches were often too heavy, and she was occasionally caught wildly out of position at times during the second-half Irish siege. Katrina Gorry - 8.5 - Started with two divine tackles on Ruesha Littlejohn and Denise O’Sullivan intervened in the nick of time to save a would-be Ireland goal and was the focal point of Australia’s attacks throughout. Katrina Gorry was one of the Matildas’ best players in their vicotry over Ireland. Credit: Reuters Kyra Cooney-Cross 6.5 - not quite her usual fluent self but her delivery into the box which resulted in the penalty was one of the pivotal moments of the match. Hayley Raso - 7 - drew the Matildas’ penalty and well and truly held her own under some heavy physical pressure from Katie McCabe and other Ireland opponents. Super fast and smart cutting in. Cortnee Vine - 6 - A quiet shift given her recent form. Offered lightning pace early in the second half and a half chance but could not get through the Irish wall. Substituted with 15 minutes remaining for Emily van Egmond. Caitlin Foord - 6.5 - Down on her usual output, which is understandable given how much of the team’s plans had relied on her combination with Sam Kerr - but also not all her fault, because the Matildas struggled to generate many chances through the middle. Mary Fowler - 7 - Stepping into the enormous shoes of Sam Kerr would be a fiendishly difficult task for a normal 20-year-old. Fowler, however, was super cool throughout - if only a few other players had her ability to steer through tight spaces and keep the ball close. Substitutes: Emily van Egmond - 5 - Was on for 15 minutes but offered little. Clare Polkinghorne - N/A - Came on for the final five minutes as Tony Gustavsson stiffened up his back four into a back five. When she was needed, she was there. 8.37pm Australia’s victory in photos Advertisement 8.31pm Minus their ace, Matildas prove themselves a team in every sense of the word By Emma Kemp Thursday night and the lights are bright, and the mass is waiting for Sam Kerr. The cathedral is packed and the pews are full. They moved heaven and earth for a ticket. They moved stadiums to make more tickets. They printed back pages and front pages, chapter and verse. Overtones and undertones. A creed to Sam Kerr. Sam Kerr celebrates with team members after their win. Credit: Edwina Pickles This World Cup has a face and it has a name. Both are at the airport when you get off the plane. On street corners and train stations and Tiktok. The cameras are poised to record the highlight reels. Kerr is poised to score in Australia’s opening match, to send Ireland packing and the Matildas on their way. But now she is on Instagram, telling the world she will not. She is on the bench when she should be captaining her country. But you cannot backflip with an injured calf. Even the drums and chants of children and a sea of phone lights worshipping in the dark cannot fix that. Kerr still gives the pre-match team talk. Yesterday she still did the pre-match press conference, giving away no sign anything was awry. Her role here is to pep talk the huddle. Tell her team they can still win without her. That almost all of the 75,784 in attendance are here to see them, and that the Irish diaspora - in their flags and felt hats and rugby shirts - do not have a say. Still, they ask: who are the Matildas without Sam Kerr? You can read who they are here . 8.22pm Catley stands up for Matildas in win over Ireland What had been a note-perfect preparation for the Matildas was derailed in the worst possible way - their best player Sam Kerr ruled out with a calf injury suffered at training the day before.

Credit: Getty The energy at Stadium Australia shifted from a quiet confidence to crippling concern to, over the course of 51 and a half painful minutes, flat-out panic. Not just for this match, but the ones to come, and the team’s Women’s World Cup campaign at large. Those worries can wait. The first hurdle, at least, has been cleared after stand-in skipper Steph Catley’s second-half penalty secured a precious 1-0 win over Ireland at a jam-packed Stadium Australia. It wasn’t pretty. But it was enough. Read the full match report from Vince Rugari here . 8.12pm Plenty for Matildas to work on before clash with Nigeria It was a nervous first victory for Australia, who were strongly tipped to overrun Ireland. The loss of Sam Kerr before the game couldn’t have been easy, but they managed to hang on in the end. Coach Tony Gustavsson will be relieved to get that first game out of the way, but there’s a lot to work on before they have their second match against Nigeria next Thursday. As for Ireland, they were strong in defence - Australia scored their only goal from a penalty because the five-person defensive line was so hard to break through. They play Olympic champions Canada next, another tough task for the team who are in their first World Cup. Matildas’ coach Tony Gustavsson congratulates players after the game.

Australia's campaign suffered a hammer blow when Kerr was ruled out of Thursday's night's game and the subsequent game against Nigeria with a calf injury suffered in Wednesday's final training session. According to Football Australia, the Chelsea striker will be assessed after the Matildas' second group B game against Nigeria in Brisbane on July 27. Vice-captain Catley wore the armband and stepped up in the 52nd minute to take a penalty after Hayley Raso was brought down, coolly dispatching the winning spot-kick into the top corner to send Stadium Australia into raptures. The sellout crowd of 75,784 was a new Matildas record on home soil. Australia have won their opening game of the World Cup with a gutsy 1-0 victory Steph Catley scored the match-winning penalty in the second half for the Matildas The stand-in captain celebrates after putting away her spot kick in Sydney Mary Fowler replaced Kerr in Australia's starting line-up against Ireland and was the only change to the team that beat France 1-0 in Melbourne in the final warm up. Caitlin Foord led Australia's attack in Kerr's absence. Coach Tony Gustavsson opted for Alanna Kennedy to pair with Clare Hunt in the centre of defence instead of veteran Clare Polkinghorne. As expected, Ireland parked the bus, playing five at the back and giving the Australians a green wall of players to get through. For more than 45 minutes, it worked. The Matildas probed early without reward, struggling to break down the Irish and taking some nervous-looking loose touches. Katrina Gorry was everywhere, controlling the game from midfield, while Raso's frantic energy and pace kept Ireland on their toes and she had a fiery battle with Irish skipper Katie McCabe. Australia's best early chance arrived in the 27th minute when Raso nodded a Catley cross just wide, while Foord hit the side netting eight minutes later. Australia broke through when Kyra Cooney-Cross lifted a diagonal ball into the penalty box and in the chaos, Marissa Sheva bundled over Raso. Foord initially picked up the ball but handed it off to Catley, who made no mistake in converting the penalty. Fowler, Foord and Gorry had good chances to add to the lead but couldn't put them away. The hosts endured a frustrating first half with Ireland defending resolutely Hayley Raso aims a header towards goal as Australia searched for the opening strike Raso grimaces after going down injured during the Group B match on Thursday Australia looked nervous as Ireland pressed for an equaliser late but held their nerve. McCabe sent in a dangerous corner in the 71st that Mackenzie Arnold punched to safety and three minutes later, Denise O'Sullivan sent a shot way over the bar. Arnold made a last ditch save late in extra time to save Australia's lead. Share or comment on this article: Australia 1-0 Ireland: No Sam Kerr? No problem!

LIVE: Matildas kick off World Cup campaign against Republic of Ireland Sam Kerr will miss the first two games of the tournament with calf injury Australian viewers furious with Channel Seven's streaming service By Dan Cancian For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 13:30, 20 July 2023 e-mail View comments Matildas fans turned on Seven commentary's team for an ill-advised remark on Katrina Gorry in the second half of Australia's 1-0 win in their Women's World Cup opener against the Republic of Ireland . 'Certainly motherhood has not blunted her competitive instincts, that's for sure,' Seven commentator David Basheer said as the Matildas midfielder won a tackle. 'She is one fighter for Australia.' Katryna Gorry (left) stared for the Matildas in their World Cup opener against Ireland The remark was met with a backlash fans watching the game on TV. 'As we celebrate women in sport and continue to argue for equality what type of archaic commentary is this, Channel 7?,' a viewer wrote, while another described the comment as 'disgraceful'. A third, meanwhile, questioned whether the same remark would have been made about a man footballer becoming a father. 'Would you say this about a male/dad football player? Stop stereotyping mothers.' The combative midfielder is a mother-of-one to daughter Harper , who will shortly turn two. Gorry, affectionately known as 'Mini', gave birth to her daughter solo via IVF , before making a stunning return to football. Viewers slammed David Basheer's comment as 'archaic' on social media Others questioned whether the remark would have been made about a male footballer The 94-cap veteran felt the time was right to become a mother when the coronavirus pandemic forced the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed by 12 months to July 2021. At the time, the Matildas star was playing in Norway for Avaldsnes when she decided to have IVF treatment in the country, while the world came to a standstill because of the pandemic. As a result, she does not know the identity of Harper's father as fertility clinics in Norway do not disclose the identity of the donors. Last month, Gorry announced her engagement to fellow footballer Clara Markstedt . The pair met while playing at Swedish club Vittsjö, and got together last year, with Matildas teammates Charlotte Grant and Tegan Micah taking up baby-sitting duties while the romance blossomed.

Crawley riding his luck Zak Crawley has led a fortunate existence at Old Trafford but his partnership with Moeen Ali has England off to a sound start at lunch on day two in their pursuit of Australia’s 317. After Ben Duckett edged Mitchell Starc, Crawley was beaten on numerous occasions by Starc and Josh Hazlewood, edging the latter just short of David Warner in the slips. He was also given lbw by Joel Wilson to Cameron Green, only for HawkEye to predict the ball would have missed leg stump - how Green would have wished for a similar ball-tracking verdict on the previous afternoon. Moeen played attractively, meanwhile, raising his 3000 runs in Test cricket. Lunch Good session for England, who make it to the interval on 1/61, chasing 317. The unlikely first-wicket pair of Zak Crawley and Moeen Ali have added 52 after the early loss of Ben Duckett to Mitchell Starc. If the trend of this series is any guide, I expect Australia to land some blows after lunch to tighten it up. The session belonged to England, who claimed two wickets for the addition of 19 runs. They are marginally ahead in the game. Rare milestone for Moeen Ali Moeen Ali joins a very exclusive club in English cricket. He’s just the fifth man to score 3000 runs and take 200 wickets. He follows in the footsteps of Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Stuart Broad. Ben Stokes is likely to the be fifth. He’s on 197 wickets, having already scored in excess of 6000 Test runs. Wicket overturned Zak Crawley escapes. The review goes England’s way. The Australians thought Cameron Green had Zak Crawley trapped in front but the England opener sends it upstairs. It’s a smart call. Ball-tracker had it missing leg stump. It may have been a bit high as well. Green will be smarting after the way he went out yesterday. Double change - Green time This is an important bowling change from the perspective of Australia’s selections. Cameron Green is into the attack. He was a line-ball call ahead of Todd Murphy. The big all-rounder made 16 with the bat, so selectors need him to make an impact with the ball. I’m backing him in. Cummins into the attack For the first time this innings, it’s Pat Cummins into the attack. And he almost strikes first-up. Zak Crawley nearly chops on. Crawley and Moeen Ali have done well against the new ball - but they will need to be on guard against the might of Cummins, who has a habit of making things happen against the flow of play. Ellyse Perry, you star We all know there’s another major sporting event on tonight involving Australia. Just so you don’t have to switch tabs, the Matildas are up 1-0, 62 minutes in. Steph Catley scored from the spot for the hosts. While I’m at it, we can’t let a football reference go without mentioning this wondergoal from Ellyse Perry at the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Twelve years on, I feel as if sports fans in this country don’t fully appreciate how big a feat it was by Perry to make it to the top of two sports. She will go down in history as one of the finest cricketers of her generation. Edge, and it doesn’t carry Josh Hazlewood’s generating some heat. He’s got one to rise sharply off a good length to Zak Crawley. The ball earlier, he found Crawley’s outside edge but it lands short of David Warner at first slip. Nice soft hands there eby Crawley.

Τέτοια θέματα στην σημερινή συνεδρίαση είναι τα υπ’ αρ. 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 (που είτε είναι το ίδιο με το θέμα 23, είτε η ΕΠΟ δαπανά για υπηρεσίες φύλαξης τα μεγαλύτερα ποσά στην Ελλάδα!), 28, 29, 30, τα οποία ασφαλώς και δεν έχουν θέση σε οποιαδήποτε συζήτηση εφόσον δεν έχουν περιεχόμενο σαφές και εκ των προτέρων γνωστό στα Μέλη της Ε.Ε./ Ε.Π.Ο. Σε ό,τι αφορά στα υπόλοιπα θέματα της ΗΔ, επιχειρείται εκ της πλαγίας οδού (και ιδίως δια του θέματος 6) να εισαχθεί προς «έγκριση»/ «επικύρωση» η «ανανέωση των συμβάσεων των Μελών της ΚΕΔ που ολοκληρώνονται στις 31.07.2023» χωρίς να διευκρινίζεται ποια είναι τα Μέλη αυτά. Προσωπικά είμαι κάθετα αντίθετος στην ανανέωση οποιασδήποτε σύμβασης όταν δεν γνωρίζω ποια πρόσωπα συγκεκριμένα αφορά και όταν δεν προκύπτουν με σαφήνεια τα καθήκοντά τους. Παρά το Καταστατικό και χωρίς καμία αρμοδιότητα κ. Πρόεδρε «χρίσατε» τον κ. Στ. Μάνταλο «Αντιπρόεδρο» της ΚΕΔ όπως ο ίδιος ο Αρχιδιαιτητής κ. Benett προσδιόρισε την ιδιότητά του κατά την συνάντησή του με τους εκπροσώπους των ΠΑΕ της Superleague 1 τον περασμένο Μάρτιο. Εξίσου παρανόμως ο κ. Μάνταλος συμμετέχει στους ορισμούς των Διαιτητών του Επαγγελματικού Ποδοσφαίρου και έχει αναλάβει την επικοινωνία μαζί τους ή την εκπαίδευσή τους στα σεμινάρια, όπως και πάλι συνομολόγησε ο κ. Benett. Kι όλα αυτά όταν η θέση του στο οργανόγραμμα της ΚΕΔ συναρτάται μόνο με το ερασιτεχνικό ποδόσφαιρο. Σας ξεκαθαρίζω ότι δεν είμαι διατεθειμένος – εκπροσωπώντας τον μεγαλύτερο φορέα του Επαγγελματικού Ποδοσφαίρου στην Ελλάδα – να ανεχθώ «Μάνταλους» και «σκιώδεις αρχιδιαιτητές». Ούτε και πρόκειται να συναινέσω ποτέ σε συμβάσεις «Μάνταλων» και άλλων που αδιαφανώς διοικούν την ελληνική διαιτησία κρυπτόμενοι. Τέλος, μου προκαλεί αλγεινή εντύπωση το γεγονός ότι δεν υπάρχει στην ΗΔ καμία απολύτως αναφορά στο θέμα των ημερών που απασχολεί το σύνολο του ελληνικού ποδοσφαίρου και αφορά τις εν εξελίξει έρευνες για το κύκλωμα στοιχηματισμού και διαφθοράς που λυμαίνεται τα επαγγελματικά πρωταθλήματα. Η μόνη σπουδή της Ομοσπονδίας ήταν να εκδώσει μια «προσωπική» ανακοίνωση ο Πρόεδρος για να δείξει τα «αντανακλαστικά» του και να κάνει επίδειξη «αποφασιστικότητας». Σε αυτή μας ανακοίνωσε την πρόθεσή του να «εισηγηθεί» την αντιμετώπιση του παράνομου στοιχηματισμού με μεθόδους ανεδαφικές και επικίνδυνες. Ούτε λίγο ούτε πολύ ο Πρόεδρος της ΕΠΟ μας είπε ότι αν θέλει κάποιος μπορεί να πληρώσει και να χειραγωγήσει έναν αγώνα ελεύθερα. Είναι η πρώτη φορά και ίσως μοναδική στα παγκόσμια ποδοσφαιρικά πράγματα που τα φαινόμενα χειραγώγησης αντιμετωπίζονται με λογική «τιμοκαταλόγου». Για να μην αναφερθώ στο νομοθετικά ανεδαφικό κομμάτι των προτάσεών του που είναι αδύνατο να υλοποιηθούν σε οποιαδήποτε ευνομούμενη χώρα. Αντί ο Πρόεδρος της ΕΠΟ να αναλαμβάνει «πρωτοβουλίες» που «κανονικοποιούν» την παρανομία και που δεν έχουν κανέναν άλλο σκοπό παρά να παρεκτρέψουν την συζήτηση από το πραγματικό πρόβλημα (και ενδεχομένως να καθυστερήσουν την διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης….), καλύτερο θα ήταν να ζητήσει από τα δικαστικά όργανα της ΕΠΟ να επιταχύνουν την διαδικασία της εις βάθος εξέτασης του θέματος άμεσα και χωρίς καθυστερήσεις. Οι Δικαστές που απαρτίζουν την Επιτροπή Δεοντολογίας της ΕΠΟ είναι και έμπειροι και ικανοί και έχουν στην διάθεσή τους επαρκές νομικό οπλοστάσιο ώστε να δράσουν αποτελεσματικά. Αυτό που χρειάζεται είναι να κινηθούν πιο γρήγορα και όχι «κανονιστικές πρωτοβουλίες» που θα τους καθυστερήσουν περισσότερο. Θα περιμέναμε από την Ομοσπονδία να έχει ήδη ενεργήσει προκειμένου να διευκολυνθούν στο έργο τους, αλλά δυστυχώς φαίνεται πως για την ΕΠΟ η ταχύτατη διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης δεν είναι επιθυμητή και γι’ αυτό θα πρέπει να δοθούν επαρκείς εξηγήσεις. Η Superleague 1 θα πράξει κάθε τι απαραίτητο προκειμένου η υπόθεση αυτή να προχωρήσει με γοργούς ρυθμούς ώστε να εξαφανιστεί οποιαδήποτε σκιά πάνω από το επαγγελματικό ποδόσφαιρο. Τέλος, σας δηλώνω ότι επιφυλάσσομαι για κάθε νόμιμο δικαίωμα του Συνεταιρισμού έναντι οιασδήποτε απόφασης που είναι αντίθετη στις διατάξεις του Νόμου και του Καταστατικού και δύναται να βλάψει τα συμφέροντά μας.

What an unbelievable day for both host nations of the 2023 Women’s World Cup. New Zealand absolutely stunned favourites Norway to claim a 1-0 victory in Auckland, after star forward Hannah Wilkinson scored just after half-time. It’s the Football Ferns first-ever World Cup victory, and they got to do it in front of 40,000 people - the biggest crowd to ever watch a football match in New Zealand. And then, the Matildas. It might not have gone exactly the way they wanted, but the Matildas walked away with a victory for their first match of the World Cup, in front of about 80,000 people. Steph Catley was an absolute superstar stepping in for Sam Kerr as captain, and Katrina Gorry was a machine taking on a very physical Katie McCabe. Have a good rest of your night football fans, let’s do this again next Thursday when Australia takes on Nigeria. Fans watch the Matildas beat Ireland in Federation Square. Credit: Getty Images 8.50pm Player ratings: How the Matildas stacked-up By Vince Rugari and Emma Kemp Mackenzie Arnold - 7.5 - Didn’t have much to do in the way of blocking shots, but was supremely confident when called upon, particularly in collecting aerial balls during Ireland’s second-half rally, and made a terrific low, late save to deny Lucy Quinn at the death. Steph Catley - 8 - Assured in defence and led the way in regular skipper Sam Kerr’s absence. When the penalty was given, she was the one who wanted it, and that confidence came through in her delivery. Clare Hunt - 7 - It remains absolutely mind-boggling that she had never played international football prior to February. It’s been said before, but it looks like she’s been doing this for a decade. Rock-solid, if a little jagged with the ball at her feet sometimes. Alanna Kennedy - 7 - Built on her return from injury last week with a performance just as outstanding. Technically sound and growing in partnership with Hunt. Ellie Carpenter - 6.5 - The divine ponytail rocketed up the right-hand flank all night long, but her touches were often too heavy, and she was occasionally caught wildly out of position at times during the second-half Irish siege. Katrina Gorry - 8.5 - Started with two divine tackles on Ruesha Littlejohn and Denise O’Sullivan intervened in the nick of time to save a would-be Ireland goal and was the focal point of Australia’s attacks throughout. Katrina Gorry was one of the Matildas’ best players in their vicotry over Ireland. Credit: Reuters Kyra Cooney-Cross 6.5 - not quite her usual fluent self but her delivery into the box which resulted in the penalty was one of the pivotal moments of the match. Hayley Raso - 7 - drew the Matildas’ penalty and well and truly held her own under some heavy physical pressure from Katie McCabe and other Ireland opponents. Super fast and smart cutting in. Cortnee Vine - 6 - A quiet shift given her recent form. Offered lightning pace early in the second half and a half chance but could not get through the Irish wall. Substituted with 15 minutes remaining for Emily van Egmond. Caitlin Foord - 6.5 - Down on her usual output, which is understandable given how much of the team’s plans had relied on her combination with Sam Kerr - but also not all her fault, because the Matildas struggled to generate many chances through the middle. Mary Fowler - 7 - Stepping into the enormous shoes of Sam Kerr would be a fiendishly difficult task for a normal 20-year-old. Fowler, however, was super cool throughout - if only a few other players had her ability to steer through tight spaces and keep the ball close. Substitutes: Emily van Egmond - 5 - Was on for 15 minutes but offered little. Clare Polkinghorne - N/A - Came on for the final five minutes as Tony Gustavsson stiffened up his back four into a back five. When she was needed, she was there. 8.37pm Australia’s victory in photos Advertisement 8.31pm Minus their ace, Matildas prove themselves a team in every sense of the word By Emma Kemp Thursday night and the lights are bright, and the mass is waiting for Sam Kerr. The cathedral is packed and the pews are full. They moved heaven and earth for a ticket. They moved stadiums to make more tickets. They printed back pages and front pages, chapter and verse. Overtones and undertones. A creed to Sam Kerr. Sam Kerr celebrates with team members after their win. Credit: Edwina Pickles This World Cup has a face and it has a name. Both are at the airport when you get off the plane. On street corners and train stations and Tiktok. The cameras are poised to record the highlight reels. Kerr is poised to score in Australia’s opening match, to send Ireland packing and the Matildas on their way. But now she is on Instagram, telling the world she will not. She is on the bench when she should be captaining her country. But you cannot backflip with an injured calf. Even the drums and chants of children and a sea of phone lights worshipping in the dark cannot fix that. Kerr still gives the pre-match team talk. Yesterday she still did the pre-match press conference, giving away no sign anything was awry. Her role here is to pep talk the huddle. Tell her team they can still win without her. That almost all of the 75,784 in attendance are here to see them, and that the Irish diaspora - in their flags and felt hats and rugby shirts - do not have a say. Still, they ask: who are the Matildas without Sam Kerr? You can read who they are here . 8.22pm Catley stands up for Matildas in win over Ireland What had been a note-perfect preparation for the Matildas was derailed in the worst possible way - their best player Sam Kerr ruled out with a calf injury suffered at training the day before. Not only would she miss this game, but next week’s clash with Nigeria too, and there are no guarantees she’ll be fit after that. Australia celebrate at full-time. Credit: Getty The energy at Stadium Australia shifted from a quiet confidence to crippling concern to, over the course of 51 and a half painful minutes, flat-out panic. Not just for this match, but the ones to come, and the team’s Women’s World Cup campaign at large. Those worries can wait. The first hurdle, at least, has been cleared after stand-in skipper Steph Catley’s second-half penalty secured a precious 1-0 win over Ireland at a jam-packed Stadium Australia. It wasn’t pretty. But it was enough.

The loss of Sam Kerr before the game couldn’t have been easy, but they managed to hang on in the end. Coach Tony Gustavsson will be relieved to get that first game out of the way, but there’s a lot to work on before they have their second match against Nigeria next Thursday. As for Ireland, they were strong in defence - Australia scored their only goal from a penalty because the five-person defensive line was so hard to break through. They play Olympic champions Canada next, another tough task for the team who are in their first World Cup. Matildas’ coach Tony Gustavsson congratulates players after the game.

Australia's campaign suffered a hammer blow when Kerr was ruled out of Thursday's night's game and the subsequent game against Nigeria with a calf injury suffered in Wednesday's final training session. According to Football Australia, the Chelsea striker will be assessed after the Matildas' second group B game against Nigeria in Brisbane on July 27. Vice-captain Catley wore the armband and stepped up in the 52nd minute to take a penalty after Hayley Raso was brought down, coolly dispatching the winning spot-kick into the top corner to send Stadium Australia into raptures. The sellout crowd of 75,784 was a new Matildas record on home soil. Australia have won their opening game of the World Cup with a gutsy 1-0 victory Steph Catley scored the match-winning penalty in the second half for the Matildas The stand-in captain celebrates after putting away her spot kick in Sydney Mary Fowler replaced Kerr in Australia's starting line-up against Ireland and was the only change to the team that beat France 1-0 in Melbourne in the final warm up. Caitlin Foord led Australia's attack in Kerr's absence. Coach Tony Gustavsson opted for Alanna Kennedy to pair with Clare Hunt in the centre of defence instead of veteran Clare Polkinghorne. As expected, Ireland parked the bus, playing five at the back and giving the Australians a green wall of players to get through. For more than 45 minutes, it worked. The Matildas probed early without reward, struggling to break down the Irish and taking some nervous-looking loose touches. Katrina Gorry was everywhere, controlling the game from midfield, while Raso's frantic energy and pace kept Ireland on their toes and she had a fiery battle with Irish skipper Katie McCabe. Australia's best early chance arrived in the 27th minute when Raso nodded a Catley cross just wide, while Foord hit the side netting eight minutes later. Australia broke through when Kyra Cooney-Cross lifted a diagonal ball into the penalty box and in the chaos, Marissa Sheva bundled over Raso. Foord initially picked up the ball but handed it off to Catley, who made no mistake in converting the penalty. Fowler, Foord and Gorry had good chances to add to the lead but couldn't put them away. The hosts endured a frustrating first half with Ireland defending resolutely Hayley Raso aims a header towards goal as Australia searched for the opening strike Raso grimaces after going down injured during the Group B match on Thursday Australia looked nervous as Ireland pressed for an equaliser late but held their nerve. McCabe sent in a dangerous corner in the 71st that Mackenzie Arnold punched to safety and three minutes later, Denise O'Sullivan sent a shot way over the bar. Arnold made a last ditch save late in extra time to save Australia's lead. Share or comment on this article: Australia 1-0 Ireland: No Sam Kerr? No problem!

'Certainly motherhood has not blunted her competitive instincts, that's for sure,' Seven commentator David Basheer said as the Matildas midfielder won a tackle. 'She is one fighter for Australia.' Katryna Gorry (left) stared for the Matildas in their World Cup opener against Ireland The remark was met with a backlash fans watching the game on TV. 'As we celebrate women in sport and continue to argue for equality what type of archaic commentary is this, Channel 7?,' a viewer wrote, while another described the comment as 'disgraceful'. A third, meanwhile, questioned whether the same remark would have been made about a man footballer becoming a father. 'Would you say this about a male/dad football player? Stop stereotyping mothers.' The combative midfielder is a mother-of-one to daughter Harper , who will shortly turn two. Gorry, affectionately known as 'Mini', gave birth to her daughter solo via IVF , before making a stunning return to football. Viewers slammed David Basheer's comment as 'archaic' on social media Others questioned whether the remark would have been made about a male footballer The 94-cap veteran felt the time was right to become a mother when the coronavirus pandemic forced the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed by 12 months to July 2021. At the time, the Matildas star was playing in Norway for Avaldsnes when she decided to have IVF treatment in the country, while the world came to a standstill because of the pandemic. As a result, she does not know the identity of Harper's father as fertility clinics in Norway do not disclose the identity of the donors. Last month, Gorry announced her engagement to fellow footballer Clara Markstedt . The pair met while playing at Swedish club Vittsjö, and got together last year, with Matildas teammates Charlotte Grant and Tegan Micah taking up baby-sitting duties while the romance blossomed.

Crawley riding his luck Zak Crawley has led a fortunate existence at Old Trafford but his partnership with Moeen Ali has England off to a sound start at lunch on day two in their pursuit of Australia’s 317. After Ben Duckett edged Mitchell Starc, Crawley was beaten on numerous occasions by Starc and Josh Hazlewood, edging the latter just short of David Warner in the slips. He was also given lbw by Joel Wilson to Cameron Green, only for HawkEye to predict the ball would have missed leg stump - how Green would have wished for a similar ball-tracking verdict on the previous afternoon. Moeen played attractively, meanwhile, raising his 3000 runs in Test cricket. Lunch Good session for England, who make it to the interval on 1/61, chasing 317. The unlikely first-wicket pair of Zak Crawley and Moeen Ali have added 52 after the early loss of Ben Duckett to Mitchell Starc. If the trend of this series is any guide, I expect Australia to land some blows after lunch to tighten it up. The session belonged to England, who claimed two wickets for the addition of 19 runs. They are marginally ahead in the game. Rare milestone for Moeen Ali Moeen Ali joins a very exclusive club in English cricket. He’s just the fifth man to score 3000 runs and take 200 wickets. He follows in the footsteps of Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Stuart Broad. Ben Stokes is likely to the be fifth. He’s on 197 wickets, having already scored in excess of 6000 Test runs. Wicket overturned Zak Crawley escapes. The review goes England’s way. The Australians thought Cameron Green had Zak Crawley trapped in front but the England opener sends it upstairs. It’s a smart call. Ball-tracker had it missing leg stump. It may have been a bit high as well. Green will be smarting after the way he went out yesterday. Double change - Green time This is an important bowling change from the perspective of Australia’s selections. Cameron Green is into the attack. He was a line-ball call ahead of Todd Murphy. The big all-rounder made 16 with the bat, so selectors need him to make an impact with the ball. I’m backing him in. Cummins into the attack For the first time this innings, it’s Pat Cummins into the attack. And he almost strikes first-up. Zak Crawley nearly chops on. Crawley and Moeen Ali have done well against the new ball - but they will need to be on guard against the might of Cummins, who has a habit of making things happen against the flow of play. Ellyse Perry, you star We all know there’s another major sporting event on tonight involving Australia. Just so you don’t have to switch tabs, the Matildas are up 1-0, 62 minutes in. Steph Catley scored from the spot for the hosts. While I’m at it, we can’t let a football reference go without mentioning this wondergoal from Ellyse Perry at the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Twelve years on, I feel as if sports fans in this country don’t fully appreciate how big a feat it was by Perry to make it to the top of two sports. She will go down in history as one of the finest cricketers of her generation. Edge, and it doesn’t carry Josh Hazlewood’s generating some heat. He’s got one to rise sharply off a good length to Zak Crawley. The ball earlier, he found Crawley’s outside edge but it lands short of David Warner at first slip. Nice soft hands there eby Crawley.

Σε αυτή μας ανακοίνωσε την πρόθεσή του να «εισηγηθεί» την αντιμετώπιση του παράνομου στοιχηματισμού με μεθόδους ανεδαφικές και επικίνδυνες. Ούτε λίγο ούτε πολύ ο Πρόεδρος της ΕΠΟ μας είπε ότι αν θέλει κάποιος μπορεί να πληρώσει και να χειραγωγήσει έναν αγώνα ελεύθερα. Είναι η πρώτη φορά και ίσως μοναδική στα παγκόσμια ποδοσφαιρικά πράγματα που τα φαινόμενα χειραγώγησης αντιμετωπίζονται με λογική «τιμοκαταλόγου». Για να μην αναφερθώ στο νομοθετικά ανεδαφικό κομμάτι των προτάσεών του που είναι αδύνατο να υλοποιηθούν σε οποιαδήποτε ευνομούμενη χώρα. Αντί ο Πρόεδρος της ΕΠΟ να αναλαμβάνει «πρωτοβουλίες» που «κανονικοποιούν» την παρανομία και που δεν έχουν κανέναν άλλο σκοπό παρά να παρεκτρέψουν την συζήτηση από το πραγματικό πρόβλημα (και ενδεχομένως να καθυστερήσουν την διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης….), καλύτερο θα ήταν να ζητήσει από τα δικαστικά όργανα της ΕΠΟ να επιταχύνουν την διαδικασία της εις βάθος εξέτασης του θέματος άμεσα και χωρίς καθυστερήσεις. Οι Δικαστές που απαρτίζουν την Επιτροπή Δεοντολογίας της ΕΠΟ είναι και έμπειροι και ικανοί και έχουν στην διάθεσή τους επαρκές νομικό οπλοστάσιο ώστε να δράσουν αποτελεσματικά. Αυτό που χρειάζεται είναι να κινηθούν πιο γρήγορα και όχι «κανονιστικές πρωτοβουλίες» που θα τους καθυστερήσουν περισσότερο. Θα περιμέναμε από την Ομοσπονδία να έχει ήδη ενεργήσει προκειμένου να διευκολυνθούν στο έργο τους, αλλά δυστυχώς φαίνεται πως για την ΕΠΟ η ταχύτατη διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης δεν είναι επιθυμητή και γι’ αυτό θα πρέπει να δοθούν επαρκείς εξηγήσεις. Η Superleague 1 θα πράξει κάθε τι απαραίτητο προκειμένου η υπόθεση αυτή να προχωρήσει με γοργούς ρυθμούς ώστε να εξαφανιστεί οποιαδήποτε σκιά πάνω από το επαγγελματικό ποδόσφαιρο. Τέλος, σας δηλώνω ότι επιφυλάσσομαι για κάθε νόμιμο δικαίωμα του Συνεταιρισμού έναντι οιασδήποτε απόφασης που είναι αντίθετη στις διατάξεις του Νόμου και του Καταστατικού και δύναται να βλάψει τα συμφέροντά μας.

Erik ten Hag managed to guide the Red Devils to a big step forward, securing the return of football, but amid significant spending this summer, expectations will only rise. With in the bag and Andre Onana all-but secured, United will now be concentrating on signing a striker ahead of potentially adding depth, depending on outgoings. With all that in mind, we have put together a potential United starting XI for the new season based on new signings and the possible striker signing, and it’s an XI worth a whopping £453.3million, according to valuations. Onana will be David De Gea’s replacement for the new season. Malacia should win the left-back race, but Luke Shaw will be applying pressure. Varane is United’s leader at the back, and that is not going to change. Back-to-back superb seasons? That’s what Martinez will be hoping to make it.","pubDate":"2023-07-20 12:00:11","image_url":"https://www.manchesterworld.uk/jpim-static/image/2023/07/20/12/GettyImages-1497870900.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"manchesterworld","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}]}
