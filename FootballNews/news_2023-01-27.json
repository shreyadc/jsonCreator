But with Ajax fifth in the Eredivisie, seven points behind leaders Feyenoord after 18 matches, they decided to part ways with the former Club Brugge coach. “This is a painful decision, but it’s necessary,” Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar said in a statement. “Regardless of the good start to the season, we lost a lot of unnecessary points. The football itself was precarious too. “Due to the World Cup, we had an early and long break during the winter. We gave Alfred our time and trust to change the way things were going. It became clear to us that he could not change the tide.” Ajax have not won in the league since defeating RKC Waalwijk on October 23 and have drawn their last six Eredivisie matches.

The spiky, gripping derby clash turned against Diego Simeone’s side in the additional period when defender Stefan Savic was sent off. Atletico took the lead through Alvaro Morata after 19 minutes but Rodrygo’s sensational slalom run past three defenders and slick finish pulled Madrid level with 11 minutes remaining. After Savic’s 99th minute red card, Benzema tucked home from Marco Asensio’s pass and Vinicius netted at the death to send Los Blancos through to the final four for the first time since 2019. The build-up to the derby was tainted when a crude effigy of Vinicius was hung from a bridge near Real Madrid’s training ground, which the club described as “a disgusting act of racism, xenophobia and hatred.” A dummy dressed in a Vinicius shirt was strung up near Real Madrid’s training ground overnight before the game with a message reading “Madrid hates Real.” Both Real Madrid and Atletico, as well as La Liga and the Spanish football federation, spoke out about the incident. The 22-year-old Brazilian forward’s club described the effigy as a “disgusting act of racism, xenophobia and hatred” in a statement. “There’s only one Madrid. We all know,” wrote Vinicius on Twitter after his side eliminated their city rivals to reach the semi-finals. “(Vinicius) controlled the match well, he really wanted to play and he had a very good game,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference. “I think the goal was his reward for his great work. What happened is very regrettable.” Madrid fans had planned to sing Vinicius’ name in support in the 20th minute, matching his shirt number, but were stunned into silence by Morata’s goal moments before. Atletico, hitting their best form of the season, conjured a brilliant move to break the deadlock, with Morata tapping home after Koke’s dink allowed Nahuel Molina to stroke a first-time cross to the back post. Eder Militao might have equalised but headed over from point-blank range, the ball deflecting slightly behind his leap to make the chance harder. Antoine Griezmann was moving with freedom between the lines, relishing his new deeper role and pulling the strings for Atletico as they dominated the first half. Madrid added another name to a long injury list when Ferland Mendy had to be replaced before half-time, with Eduardo Camavinga slotting in at left back and Dani Ceballos coming on. Along with injuries for Dani Carvajal, David Alaba and Lucas Vazquez, it left Madrid without any natural full backs. Benzema was not far away from reaching Fede Valverde’s flick-on from Nacho’s drive, as Madrid started the second half strongly. Jan Oblak produced a fine save to deny the French forward, with Vinicius unable to react quickly enough to finish from the rebound. At the other end, Axel Witsel sent an overhead kick narrowly wide and Thibaut Courtois tipped a vicious Griezmann free kick over as Atletico tried and failed to kill off the game. Rodrygo levelled with 11 minutes to go with his jinking solo effort and subtle near-post finish, taking the game to extra-time. Atletico defender Savic foolishly handed Madrid the edge when he was sent off for two yellow cards in two minutes. The first came during an argument with Vinicius and the second for fouling Camavinga. Madrid immediately began to capitalise when Vinicius crossed for Antonio Rudiger, who headed narrowly wide. Benzema struck lethally after 104 minutes when Vinicius miskicked Marco Asensio’s cross and the ball travelled through to the striker. Madrid, who last won the Copa del Rey in 2014, kept Atletico at bay in the final 15 minutes before Vinicius dribbled through and fired home to clinch the victory. Earlier Athletic Bilbao won 3-1 at Valencia to join record 31-time winners Barcelona and Osasuna in Monday’s semi-final draw.

Will Unwin Walsall v Leicester, Saturday 12.30pm 2) Reds’ return to Brighton Jürgen Klopp was adamant that progress was being made following Liverpool’s drab goalless draw at home to Chelsea, but a truer test awaits the holders on their return to the Amex Stadium. Brighton ripped through Liverpool in the Premier League a fortnight ago, when Klopp described his team’s 3-0 defeat as one of the worst displays of his managerial career. Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Joël Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were all withdrawn in a quadruple substitution midway through the second half against Roberto De Zerbi’s polished side. None have started in the two matches since. Eighteen-year-old Stefan Bajcetic has seized his chance in central midfield, injecting an energy and bite that was previously lacking, while Ibrahima Konaté and Joe Gomez have benefited from the improvement in front of them. Both managers should go strong with no midweek fixtures to concern them. Klopp must hope De Zerbi finds Liverpool unrecognisable.

Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters 3) Cup no distraction for Wrexham The focus at Wrexham in recent times has been off the field, which is unsurprising due to the Hollywood status of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. On the pitch they were unlucky to miss out on promotion last season, coming second to Stockport in the league. Things have been slowly building in north Wales due to the investment of the owners, who know the National League is the hardest division to get out of and to do so they need goals, hence why Paul Mullin was brought in a great expense. Some might think the Cup is a distraction from the all-important battle for promotion but no one in a Wrexham shirt on Sunday will. Instead it will be an opportunity for players to show they are capable of competing with a Sheffield United team three leagues higher, as they already proved at Coventry in the last round . They will be desperate to show that result was not a fluke. WU Wrexham v Sheffield United, Sunday 4.30pm 4) Untimely Hammers blows David Moyes is still in a job after beating Everton last week but this has not been an entirely positive week for the West Ham manager. Victory came at a cost. As if losing Danny Ings for a few weeks was bad enough after the new signing suffered a debut knee injury after his introduction from the bench, West Ham have also discovered Kurt Zouma will be missing for a couple of games. Once again Moyes will be forced into a reshuffle at centre-back. He had welcomed Zouma back from knee surgery and could have done without the defender hurting himself. West Ham’s options are limited following Craig Dawson’s move to Wolves and they will need to take care when they visit Derby. The surging League One side – unbeaten in 14 games – will certainly take heart from the absence of Ings, who was signed to solve West Ham’s goalscoring issues. With Zouma missing, it could be an uncomfortable evening for Moyes. Jacob Steinberg Derby County v West Ham, Monday 7.45pm 5) Does Kane need a rest? Playing against a team in the league below could be the perfect opportunity for Harry Kane to surpass Jimmy Greaves’s Tottenham goalscoring record. The Spurs No 9 drew level with the club legend in Monday’s win over Fulham , meaning his next strike will make history in north London. Antonio Conte, however, needs to perform a balancing act with Kane, who is irreplaceable in the Spurs lineup – in the league at least – and rarely gets a chance to be rested. He has scored three times as many goals this season as Son Heung-min, who is second in the club charts. Richarlison, who needs minutes on the pitch, led the line impressively for Brazil at the World Cup and would be a fine option for Conte to start at Deepdale if he decides Kane cannot play every minute of every game. WU Preston v Tottenham, Saturday 6pm Richarlison could be in line to take the load off Harry Kane. Photograph: Kieran McManus/Shutterstock 6) Weghorst in the spotlight The latest evidence of Erik ten Hag’s apparent Midas touch came in Wout Weghorst’s strike in Manchester United’s 3-0 dismantling of Nottingham Forest – as this was his first goal in only a third appearance since joining temporarily. The 6ft 5in marksman is supposedly solely a deputy to Anthony Martial at No 9 for those games where Marcus Rashford’s pace is not needed to replace the serially-injured Frenchman down the middle. But here lies the great unknown as the second half of the season unfolds: when he is in the XI, will Weghorst’s sluggish pace cost Ten Hag’s team Champions League qualification points and progression in the knockout competitions? If so, this would shine a light on how in the current window United’s owners, the Glazers, failed to back the manager in the same manner Arsenal’s owners did Mikel Arteta. It would cast Weghorst as a sticking-plaster addition unless, of course, the manager can conjure a consistent contribution from the 30-year-old. A further clue will be offered if Weghorst starts (as is expected) against Reading at Old Trafford.

Patrick Bamford has not started for Leeds since the 2-0 defeat at Leicester in October. An injury kept him sidelined from the end of that month until the loss to Aston Villa in mid-January, when he came off the bench to score a consolation goal. Leeds’s goalless draw against Brentford last weekend showed that Jesse Marsch’s side were lacking a true No 9. Despite this, the head coach kept Bamford and the new record signing, Georginio Rutter, back. Bamford came on for 10 minutes, while Rutter remained unused. Saturday’s trip to Accrington seems a perfect opportunity to get as many minutes under Bamford’s belt as possible and move him closer to full match fitness, because he will be very important to Leeds in the run-in if they want to avoid a relegation battle. Rodrigo has done well down the middle but greater variety in forward roles would be a useful asset for Marsch. WU Accrington v Leeds, Saturday, 12.30pm 8) Mariners to call on nomad The Grimsby striker Danilo Orsi-Dadomo has had a nomadic career; he started in London at Cockfosters before moving to the US to play football for a college. Eventually he returned home for a collection of non-league stints in the south-east with East Thurrock United, Hungerford Town and Hampton & Richmond, before a fine season with Maidenhead led to him being snapped up by Harrogate Town in 2021. Since then, however, he has struggled to find the net and was allowed to join Grimsby last summer. Once again he is not a regular, having started three times for the Mariners without scoring, but Paul Hurst has a striker crisis due to injury and ineligibility, and will need to call on Orsi for the trip to Luton. Orsi’s tale is one of an underdog and the FA Cup loves a storyline. WU Luton v Grimsby, Saturday 3pm Danilo Orsi-Dadomo of Grimsby Town. Photograph: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images 9) Solomon’s Fulham chance Fulham need a response after a couple of narrow defeats against Newcastle and Tottenham. They have not been playing badly and have not had much luck. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s penalty blunder proved costly against Newcastle and there was a lot to like about Fulham’s general play against Spurs. Where Marco Silva’s side have been lacking, though, is in the final third. They did not make enough chances against Spurs, though Manor Solomon’s cameo off the bench was a positive. The Israel winger was bright after coming on, going close with a bending shot, and will hope to be given a chance against Sunderland. Solomon, who joined from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, needs games. He had a long spell on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury on the opening day of the season and has been restricted to four substitute appearances. Could this be the moment for Silva to unleash him from the start? JS Fulham v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm 10) Apprentice challenges master Under the Etihad Stadium lights this clash can be billed as a potentially titanic master-versus-apprentice clash. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City take on Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal in a tie that acts as primer for the two Premier League games in February and April between the champions and leaders. The intent of the Arsenal board to end a 19-year title drought is underlined by the €50m January outlay on Leonardo Trossard and Jakob Kiwior, in a move that underlines, too, how thrilled the hierarchy is at how Arteta, once Guardiola’s assistant, has constructed a team worthy of a five-point advantage over his former employers. But the Catalan, now his sporting adversary, is a man driven to win and, despite the gap in the Premier League and recent criticism of his players, Guardiola’s men start as favourites. But, only just – which is the mark of how impressive Arteta and his side are this term.

The midfield warrior made an encouraging debut in the goalless duel with Stockport in midweek. Clayton offered an immediate presence at the start of the short-term contract he signed following his Doncaster exit. He also wasted no time in turning up the volume on the pitch. The Bantams have been accused of being too quiet as a team at times - something that Clayton’s arrival will help to rectify. The 34-year-old feels that being vocal is a vital part of the game that is often overlooked. It is also not easy to master. \"That's something I've prided myself on from probably 26 onwards,” said Clayton. \"Tony Pulis showed me what defensively you can do with your voice from that position and it's something I took on. “I think I've got quite good at it and I quite enjoy it but it is a skill. \"It's not just like talking in the dressing room. You can be a loud, boisterous person and not know how to do that on the pitch. It's all about learning how and what and why. \"It's like learning how to pass. It's not just about being confident and loud; you've got to really learn it. \"If I could choose a skill to start again with at 15, that's probably what I'd choose.” Clayton is 11 games short of reaching 500 in a career now in its 14th year. Being one of the main voices in the team comes easier from having that know-how behind him. He added: \"It comes with experience and you've got to feel like you've got the authority within the group. “You might be a really good young player but you don't want to shout at one of the older players. But it's not that really. \"It's all about understanding. Hopefully that's something I can bring and make others do more.” In-game communication is a “massive thing” for Mark Hughes, who wants players to be able to think on their feet and adapt effectively to changing situations. “We talk time and time again, not only about general play but set-plays, it’s about getting organised early and you have to communicate,” said the City boss. “You have to talk and shout on the pitch just to get yourself sorted. It makes a hard job easier if you are getting help and can impart help. “Being able to communicate loudly, clearly, concisely and correctly is a massive thing for a player. “I will always encourage that. The more guys you have that can take on responsibility and not only do their job but maybe 25-50 per cent of somebody else’s if they are having a bad time. “It just gets players through. It’s important that we have good players who are able to do that.” City captain Richie Smallwood is another vocal presence (Image: Thomas Gadd) Hughes will welcome more noise in the ranks as the Bantams head towards the business end of the campaign and a promotion-defining final 20 games. He wants to see that leadership in the heat of the battle that Clayton will look to add alongside the likes of skipper Richie Smallwood and Alex Gilliead. “At times, I’ve felt we’ve maybe been a little bit quiet on the pitch in terms of organising. We just need more numbers to be more actively involved in that part of the game. “Communication on the pitch is vital and if we can improve that aspect it will allow us to be more effective, in my view. “Players will lead in different ways. “Richie is a talker but he leads by example as well. Adam was someone who was always quite vocal. “We’ve got other leaders in the group. Gilly is great in that regard, leading by example. “We have got leadership but if you can add to it, as long with the ability of the player, then that’s a good thing.” Hughes has noticed a change in the dressing room since he started out in management. Players are now likely to look more to their coaches for advice during games. “There are always ways and means to make yourself heard. “I think there is more of an onus on looking to the sideline rather than understanding what’s happening in a game. “It’s quite difficult to recognise what the opposition are doing when you’re in the heat of a football match. “You are trying to cope with what demands have been placed on you as an individual and it can be difficult. It takes a lot of talent and experience to recognise what is happening as you’re within the game. “You don’t see a lot of players being able to understand what’s required at any given time. It becomes more prevalent that coaches and managers on the sideline have to sort things out from afar. “You can improve that aspect of your team and hopefully players will step up and take up the slack.” The rise in the number of foreign players, particularly in the Premier League, has meant managers have also had to adapt their approach. Hughes saw that during his 14 years at the helm with six clubs in the top flight. But leaders can still emerge within the squad. “When I was playing and starting managing, the make-up of the dressing room were predominantly British-based players,” he added. “That’s not the case anymore. There’s a lot of diversity in it and managing the same and reacting to poor play is a little bit dangerous if you’ve got different cultures. “Players from different countries with different attitudes take criticism in different ways. “You have to learn and understand that and recognise it could be a problem if you just bowled in and managed like you did 15-20 years ago. “It does change but it’s still about good leadership there. “It’s not necessarily just British-based players that have that character. “One of the best leaders I was ever involved with was Vincent Kompany. “He came to these shores and straight away from the first moment I was in his company, I realised he was a guy who was going to lead people. “You never know. You have to work and be around them to understand what they do. “But if you have one, two, three or even more (leaders) in your group then that’s going to help you.”","pubDate":"2023-01-27 00:01:00","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/16392317/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Ronaldo’s Al Nassr knocked out of Saudi Super Cup","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-ronaldo-s-al-nassr-knocked-out-of-saudi-super-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 27, 2023 7:14 AMRIYADH - Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr were knocked of the Saudi Super Cup on Thursday after a 3-1 semi-final loss to Al Ittihad in Riyadh.","content":"RIYADH - Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr were knocked of the Saudi Super Cup on Thursday after a 3-1 semi-final loss to Al Ittihad in Riyadh.

Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving to join Dutch club PSV Eindhoven and general manager Brian McBride has stood down from his role, U.S. Soccer said. National team coach Gregg Berhalter, who guided the team to the last-16 at December’s World Cup in Qatar, is out of contract, no longer working with the team and his future remains uncertain. Berhalter is facing an investigation by the federation for a 1991 domestic violence incident. The incident came to light following the controversy surrounding Berhalter’s tense relationship with Borussia Dortmund player Gio Reyna at the World Cup in Qatar. U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone told an online press conference that they had now hired a consultancy company to begin a full review of the organisation’s sports department. With vacancies in three top jobs, Parlow Cone said they would take their time to conclude various reviews and make the new appointments. “We’re not going to rush it,” she said. “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain for you in the media, for our staff, for players. What it actually is a clean canvas,” she added. U.S. Soccer chief executive officer J.T. Batson said the Berhalter saga had not had any impact on the decisions of Stewart and McBride to leave the organisation. The United States, along with Mexico and Canada, will host the World Cup in 2026 but rather than begin building on the progress made by the promising young team, the federation now must find key personnel and deal with the fall-out of the Berhalter-Reyna row. Parlow Cone, who said she would like a new head coach in place “by the end of summer” said the departures allowed the federation to assess its direction. “We did not plan it this way but we find ourselves in this position and we’re going to take the opportunity to really do a deep dive on our sporting side to make sure we’re as effective and as efficient as possible, because we have grand vision of where we want to go on the sporting side and we want to make sure we’re in the best position to accomplish those goals,” she said. The consultancy firm, Sportsology Group, will help in the search for a new sporting director as well as provide a broader review. Once appointed, a new sporting director will then hire the next head coach of the team although Sportsology will help analyse possible candidates ahead of time. Stewart will remain in his job until February 15 and in a statement released by the federation said he had full confidence in the organisation. “When the opportunity arose to return to the Netherlands to pursue an exciting and challenging role that was near my family, I could not turn it down,” said Stewart. “I am extremely proud of what our sporting department has accomplished over the past four years. This is a pivotal time for the sport in the United States and I have full confidence in the leadership of U.S. Soccer heading into 2026 and beyond,” he said. The conflict between Berhalter and Reyna took a dark turn in early January after US Soccer announced it had launched an investigation into allegations of decades-old domestic violence by Berhalter. Berhalter admitted in a statement on Twitter to kicking the woman who he would later marry during an argument in 1991. Later it emerged that US Soccer had been alerted to the incident by Gio Reyna’s family. Father Claudio Reyna is a former US captain and team-mate of Berhalter’s, while his wife Danielle was a college soccer team-mate of Berhalter’s wife Rosalind. Later on Thursday, Claudio Reyna announced that he was standing down from his role as technical director of Major League Soccer club Austin FC. Reyna will take on an advisory post and said he was looking for “a less all consuming role”. The U.S team, currently being coached on an interim basis by Anthony Hudson, lost 2-1 on Wednesday in a friendly against Serbia in which both countries played under-strength line-ups.

Hakim Ziyech, pe radarul celor de la AC Milan Este vorba despre vedeta londonezilor de la Chelsea, Hakim Ziyech. Conform Football Italia , cei de la AC Milan au decis să nu mai intre în cursa pentru Zaniolo după ce atacantul italian a primit o ofertă din partea celor de la Bournemouth, de 30 de milioane de euro, plus bonusuri. Se pare că Zaniolo și-ar fi dorit să meargă la AC Milan, însă oferta venită din partea clubului din Premier League l-a făcut să se răzgândească. Rossonerii ar fi discutat deja cu cei de la Chelsea despre un posibil transfer al lui Hakim Ziyech, însă lucrurile sunt complicate din cauza salariului pe care îl cere fotbalistul, dar și pentru că marocanul este dorit de mai multe cluburi. Hakim Ziyech s-ar fi autopropus la Chelsea Atacantul marocan ș i-ar dori să ajungă pe Camp Nou , astfel că agenții săi le-au transmis catalanilor că Ziyech este dispus să semneze chiar în această iarnă. Fotbalistul este nemulțumit de minutele primite la Chelsea și vrea să ajungă la o altă echipă la care să poată juca, iar Barcelona pare cea mai bună variantă în acest moment pentru marocan. Nu este pentru prima dată când se vorbește despre un eventual transfer al lui Hakim Ziyech la Barcelona. În 2020, înainte ca Chelsea să rezolve transferul marocanului de la Ajax, atunci când londonezii au plătit 40 de milioane de euro, fotbalistul era și pe lista Barcelonei. Chiar și iarna trecută, Ziyech ar fi putut ajunge la Barcelona. Catalanii au dorit să îl aducă sub formă de împrumut pe Ziyech, însă, în cele din urmă, pe Camp Nou a ajuns Adama Traore .

Gomes wanted a move to the Premier League club ahead of Ligue 1 side Lyon, and he appears to have been granted his wish. Wolves will pay a fee of €17 million to sign Gomes from Flamengo and he will take a medical next week. He is set to become the club's sixth arrival this transfer window.

Wolves' spending in this transfer window will reach £80 million after Gomes' move is confirmed, with Cunha costing over half of that figure having made three appearances for his new team, which activated his permanent move from Atletico Madrid. Gomes, whose contract with Flamengo runs until 2027, is viewed by Wolves as the long-term replacement for Ruben Neves.

The spiky, gripping derby clash turned against Diego Simeone’s side in the additional period when defender Stefan Savic was sent off. Atletico took the lead through Alvaro Morata after 19 minutes but Rodrygo’s sensational slalom run past three defenders and slick finish pulled Madrid level with 11 minutes remaining. After Savic’s 99th minute red card, Benzema tucked home from Marco Asensio’s pass and Vinicius netted at the death to send Los Blancos through to the final four for the first time since 2019. The build-up to the derby was tainted when a crude effigy of Vinicius was hung from a bridge near Real Madrid’s training ground, which the club described as “a disgusting act of racism, xenophobia and hatred.” A dummy dressed in a Vinicius shirt was strung up near Real Madrid’s training ground overnight before the game with a message reading “Madrid hates Real.” Both Real Madrid and Atletico, as well as La Liga and the Spanish football federation, spoke out about the incident. The 22-year-old Brazilian forward’s club described the effigy as a “disgusting act of racism, xenophobia and hatred” in a statement. “There’s only one Madrid. We all know,” wrote Vinicius on Twitter after his side eliminated their city rivals to reach the semi-finals. “(Vinicius) controlled the match well, he really wanted to play and he had a very good game,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference. “I think the goal was his reward for his great work. What happened is very regrettable.” Madrid fans had planned to sing Vinicius’ name in support in the 20th minute, matching his shirt number, but were stunned into silence by Morata’s goal moments before. Atletico, hitting their best form of the season, conjured a brilliant move to break the deadlock, with Morata tapping home after Koke’s dink allowed Nahuel Molina to stroke a first-time cross to the back post. Eder Militao might have equalised but headed over from point-blank range, the ball deflecting slightly behind his leap to make the chance harder. Antoine Griezmann was moving with freedom between the lines, relishing his new deeper role and pulling the strings for Atletico as they dominated the first half. Madrid added another name to a long injury list when Ferland Mendy had to be replaced before half-time, with Eduardo Camavinga slotting in at left back and Dani Ceballos coming on. Along with injuries for Dani Carvajal, David Alaba and Lucas Vazquez, it left Madrid without any natural full backs. Benzema was not far away from reaching Fede Valverde’s flick-on from Nacho’s drive, as Madrid started the second half strongly. Jan Oblak produced a fine save to deny the French forward, with Vinicius unable to react quickly enough to finish from the rebound. At the other end, Axel Witsel sent an overhead kick narrowly wide and Thibaut Courtois tipped a vicious Griezmann free kick over as Atletico tried and failed to kill off the game. Rodrygo levelled with 11 minutes to go with his jinking solo effort and subtle near-post finish, taking the game to extra-time. Atletico defender Savic foolishly handed Madrid the edge when he was sent off for two yellow cards in two minutes. The first came during an argument with Vinicius and the second for fouling Camavinga. Madrid immediately began to capitalise when Vinicius crossed for Antonio Rudiger, who headed narrowly wide. Benzema struck lethally after 104 minutes when Vinicius miskicked Marco Asensio’s cross and the ball travelled through to the striker. Madrid, who last won the Copa del Rey in 2014, kept Atletico at bay in the final 15 minutes before Vinicius dribbled through and fired home to clinch the victory. Earlier Athletic Bilbao won 3-1 at Valencia to join record 31-time winners Barcelona and Osasuna in Monday’s semi-final draw.

Will Unwin Walsall v Leicester, Saturday 12.30pm 2) Reds’ return to Brighton Jürgen Klopp was adamant that progress was being made following Liverpool’s drab goalless draw at home to Chelsea, but a truer test awaits the holders on their return to the Amex Stadium. Brighton ripped through Liverpool in the Premier League a fortnight ago, when Klopp described his team’s 3-0 defeat as one of the worst displays of his managerial career. Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Joël Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were all withdrawn in a quadruple substitution midway through the second half against Roberto De Zerbi’s polished side. None have started in the two matches since. Eighteen-year-old Stefan Bajcetic has seized his chance in central midfield, injecting an energy and bite that was previously lacking, while Ibrahima Konaté and Joe Gomez have benefited from the improvement in front of them. Both managers should go strong with no midweek fixtures to concern them. Klopp must hope De Zerbi finds Liverpool unrecognisable.

Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters 3) Cup no distraction for Wrexham The focus at Wrexham in recent times has been off the field, which is unsurprising due to the Hollywood status of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. On the pitch they were unlucky to miss out on promotion last season, coming second to Stockport in the league. Things have been slowly building in north Wales due to the investment of the owners, who know the National League is the hardest division to get out of and to do so they need goals, hence why Paul Mullin was brought in a great expense. Some might think the Cup is a distraction from the all-important battle for promotion but no one in a Wrexham shirt on Sunday will. Instead it will be an opportunity for players to show they are capable of competing with a Sheffield United team three leagues higher, as they already proved at Coventry in the last round . They will be desperate to show that result was not a fluke. WU Wrexham v Sheffield United, Sunday 4.30pm 4) Untimely Hammers blows David Moyes is still in a job after beating Everton last week but this has not been an entirely positive week for the West Ham manager. Victory came at a cost. As if losing Danny Ings for a few weeks was bad enough after the new signing suffered a debut knee injury after his introduction from the bench, West Ham have also discovered Kurt Zouma will be missing for a couple of games. Once again Moyes will be forced into a reshuffle at centre-back. He had welcomed Zouma back from knee surgery and could have done without the defender hurting himself. West Ham’s options are limited following Craig Dawson’s move to Wolves and they will need to take care when they visit Derby. The surging League One side – unbeaten in 14 games – will certainly take heart from the absence of Ings, who was signed to solve West Ham’s goalscoring issues. With Zouma missing, it could be an uncomfortable evening for Moyes. Jacob Steinberg Derby County v West Ham, Monday 7.45pm 5) Does Kane need a rest? Playing against a team in the league below could be the perfect opportunity for Harry Kane to surpass Jimmy Greaves’s Tottenham goalscoring record. The Spurs No 9 drew level with the club legend in Monday’s win over Fulham , meaning his next strike will make history in north London. Antonio Conte, however, needs to perform a balancing act with Kane, who is irreplaceable in the Spurs lineup – in the league at least – and rarely gets a chance to be rested. He has scored three times as many goals this season as Son Heung-min, who is second in the club charts. Richarlison, who needs minutes on the pitch, led the line impressively for Brazil at the World Cup and would be a fine option for Conte to start at Deepdale if he decides Kane cannot play every minute of every game. WU Preston v Tottenham, Saturday 6pm Richarlison could be in line to take the load off Harry Kane. Photograph: Kieran McManus/Shutterstock 6) Weghorst in the spotlight The latest evidence of Erik ten Hag’s apparent Midas touch came in Wout Weghorst’s strike in Manchester United’s 3-0 dismantling of Nottingham Forest – as this was his first goal in only a third appearance since joining temporarily. The 6ft 5in marksman is supposedly solely a deputy to Anthony Martial at No 9 for those games where Marcus Rashford’s pace is not needed to replace the serially-injured Frenchman down the middle. But here lies the great unknown as the second half of the season unfolds: when he is in the XI, will Weghorst’s sluggish pace cost Ten Hag’s team Champions League qualification points and progression in the knockout competitions? If so, this would shine a light on how in the current window United’s owners, the Glazers, failed to back the manager in the same manner Arsenal’s owners did Mikel Arteta. It would cast Weghorst as a sticking-plaster addition unless, of course, the manager can conjure a consistent contribution from the 30-year-old. A further clue will be offered if Weghorst starts (as is expected) against Reading at Old Trafford.

Patrick Bamford has not started for Leeds since the 2-0 defeat at Leicester in October. An injury kept him sidelined from the end of that month until the loss to Aston Villa in mid-January, when he came off the bench to score a consolation goal. Leeds’s goalless draw against Brentford last weekend showed that Jesse Marsch’s side were lacking a true No 9. Despite this, the head coach kept Bamford and the new record signing, Georginio Rutter, back. Bamford came on for 10 minutes, while Rutter remained unused. Saturday’s trip to Accrington seems a perfect opportunity to get as many minutes under Bamford’s belt as possible and move him closer to full match fitness, because he will be very important to Leeds in the run-in if they want to avoid a relegation battle. Rodrigo has done well down the middle but greater variety in forward roles would be a useful asset for Marsch. WU Accrington v Leeds, Saturday, 12.30pm 8) Mariners to call on nomad The Grimsby striker Danilo Orsi-Dadomo has had a nomadic career; he started in London at Cockfosters before moving to the US to play football for a college. Eventually he returned home for a collection of non-league stints in the south-east with East Thurrock United, Hungerford Town and Hampton & Richmond, before a fine season with Maidenhead led to him being snapped up by Harrogate Town in 2021. Since then, however, he has struggled to find the net and was allowed to join Grimsby last summer. Once again he is not a regular, having started three times for the Mariners without scoring, but Paul Hurst has a striker crisis due to injury and ineligibility, and will need to call on Orsi for the trip to Luton. Orsi’s tale is one of an underdog and the FA Cup loves a storyline. WU Luton v Grimsby, Saturday 3pm Danilo Orsi-Dadomo of Grimsby Town. Photograph: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images 9) Solomon’s Fulham chance Fulham need a response after a couple of narrow defeats against Newcastle and Tottenham. They have not been playing badly and have not had much luck. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s penalty blunder proved costly against Newcastle and there was a lot to like about Fulham’s general play against Spurs. Where Marco Silva’s side have been lacking, though, is in the final third. They did not make enough chances against Spurs, though Manor Solomon’s cameo off the bench was a positive. The Israel winger was bright after coming on, going close with a bending shot, and will hope to be given a chance against Sunderland. Solomon, who joined from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, needs games. He had a long spell on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury on the opening day of the season and has been restricted to four substitute appearances. Could this be the moment for Silva to unleash him from the start? JS Fulham v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm 10) Apprentice challenges master Under the Etihad Stadium lights this clash can be billed as a potentially titanic master-versus-apprentice clash. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City take on Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal in a tie that acts as primer for the two Premier League games in February and April between the champions and leaders. The intent of the Arsenal board to end a 19-year title drought is underlined by the €50m January outlay on Leonardo Trossard and Jakob Kiwior, in a move that underlines, too, how thrilled the hierarchy is at how Arteta, once Guardiola’s assistant, has constructed a team worthy of a five-point advantage over his former employers. But the Catalan, now his sporting adversary, is a man driven to win and, despite the gap in the Premier League and recent criticism of his players, Guardiola’s men start as favourites. But, only just – which is the mark of how impressive Arteta and his side are this term.

The midfield warrior made an encouraging debut in the goalless duel with Stockport in midweek. Clayton offered an immediate presence at the start of the short-term contract he signed following his Doncaster exit. He also wasted no time in turning up the volume on the pitch. The Bantams have been accused of being too quiet as a team at times - something that Clayton’s arrival will help to rectify. The 34-year-old feels that being vocal is a vital part of the game that is often overlooked. It is also not easy to master. \"That's something I've prided myself on from probably 26 onwards,” said Clayton. \"Tony Pulis showed me what defensively you can do with your voice from that position and it's something I took on. “I think I've got quite good at it and I quite enjoy it but it is a skill. \"It's not just like talking in the dressing room. You can be a loud, boisterous person and not know how to do that on the pitch. It's all about learning how and what and why. \"It's like learning how to pass. It's not just about being confident and loud; you've got to really learn it. \"If I could choose a skill to start again with at 15, that's probably what I'd choose.” Clayton is 11 games short of reaching 500 in a career now in its 14th year. Being one of the main voices in the team comes easier from having that know-how behind him. He added: \"It comes with experience and you've got to feel like you've got the authority within the group. “You might be a really good young player but you don't want to shout at one of the older players. But it's not that really. \"It's all about understanding. Hopefully that's something I can bring and make others do more.” In-game communication is a “massive thing” for Mark Hughes, who wants players to be able to think on their feet and adapt effectively to changing situations. “We talk time and time again, not only about general play but set-plays, it’s about getting organised early and you have to communicate,” said the City boss. “You have to talk and shout on the pitch just to get yourself sorted. It makes a hard job easier if you are getting help and can impart help. “Being able to communicate loudly, clearly, concisely and correctly is a massive thing for a player. “I will always encourage that. The more guys you have that can take on responsibility and not only do their job but maybe 25-50 per cent of somebody else’s if they are having a bad time. “It just gets players through. It’s important that we have good players who are able to do that.” City captain Richie Smallwood is another vocal presence (Image: Thomas Gadd) Hughes will welcome more noise in the ranks as the Bantams head towards the business end of the campaign and a promotion-defining final 20 games. He wants to see that leadership in the heat of the battle that Clayton will look to add alongside the likes of skipper Richie Smallwood and Alex Gilliead. “At times, I’ve felt we’ve maybe been a little bit quiet on the pitch in terms of organising. We just need more numbers to be more actively involved in that part of the game. “Communication on the pitch is vital and if we can improve that aspect it will allow us to be more effective, in my view. “Players will lead in different ways. “Richie is a talker but he leads by example as well. Adam was someone who was always quite vocal. “We’ve got other leaders in the group. Gilly is great in that regard, leading by example. “We have got leadership but if you can add to it, as long with the ability of the player, then that’s a good thing.” Hughes has noticed a change in the dressing room since he started out in management. Players are now likely to look more to their coaches for advice during games. “There are always ways and means to make yourself heard. “I think there is more of an onus on looking to the sideline rather than understanding what’s happening in a game. “It’s quite difficult to recognise what the opposition are doing when you’re in the heat of a football match. “You are trying to cope with what demands have been placed on you as an individual and it can be difficult. It takes a lot of talent and experience to recognise what is happening as you’re within the game. “You don’t see a lot of players being able to understand what’s required at any given time. It becomes more prevalent that coaches and managers on the sideline have to sort things out from afar. “You can improve that aspect of your team and hopefully players will step up and take up the slack.” The rise in the number of foreign players, particularly in the Premier League, has meant managers have also had to adapt their approach. Hughes saw that during his 14 years at the helm with six clubs in the top flight. But leaders can still emerge within the squad. “When I was playing and starting managing, the make-up of the dressing room were predominantly British-based players,” he added. “That’s not the case anymore. There’s a lot of diversity in it and managing the same and reacting to poor play is a little bit dangerous if you’ve got different cultures. “Players from different countries with different attitudes take criticism in different ways. “You have to learn and understand that and recognise it could be a problem if you just bowled in and managed like you did 15-20 years ago. “It does change but it’s still about good leadership there. “It’s not necessarily just British-based players that have that character. “One of the best leaders I was ever involved with was Vincent Kompany. “He came to these shores and straight away from the first moment I was in his company, I realised he was a guy who was going to lead people. “You never know. You have to work and be around them to understand what they do. “But if you have one, two, three or even more (leaders) in your group then that’s going to help you.”","pubDate":"2023-01-27 00:01:00","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/16392317/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Ronaldo’s Al Nassr knocked out of Saudi Super Cup","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-ronaldo-s-al-nassr-knocked-out-of-saudi-super-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 27, 2023 7:14 AMRIYADH - Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr were knocked of the Saudi Super Cup on Thursday after a 3-1 semi-final loss to Al Ittihad in Riyadh.","content":"RIYADH - Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr were knocked of the Saudi Super Cup on Thursday after a 3-1 semi-final loss to Al Ittihad in Riyadh.

Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving to join Dutch club PSV Eindhoven and general manager Brian McBride has stood down from his role, U.S. Soccer said. National team coach Gregg Berhalter, who guided the team to the last-16 at December’s World Cup in Qatar, is out of contract, no longer working with the team and his future remains uncertain. Berhalter is facing an investigation by the federation for a 1991 domestic violence incident. The incident came to light following the controversy surrounding Berhalter’s tense relationship with Borussia Dortmund player Gio Reyna at the World Cup in Qatar. U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone told an online press conference that they had now hired a consultancy company to begin a full review of the organisation’s sports department. With vacancies in three top jobs, Parlow Cone said they would take their time to conclude various reviews and make the new appointments. “We’re not going to rush it,” she said. “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain for you in the media, for our staff, for players. What it actually is a clean canvas,” she added. U.S. Soccer chief executive officer J.T. Batson said the Berhalter saga had not had any impact on the decisions of Stewart and McBride to leave the organisation. The United States, along with Mexico and Canada, will host the World Cup in 2026 but rather than begin building on the progress made by the promising young team, the federation now must find key personnel and deal with the fall-out of the Berhalter-Reyna row. Parlow Cone, who said she would like a new head coach in place “by the end of summer” said the departures allowed the federation to assess its direction. “We did not plan it this way but we find ourselves in this position and we’re going to take the opportunity to really do a deep dive on our sporting side to make sure we’re as effective and as efficient as possible, because we have grand vision of where we want to go on the sporting side and we want to make sure we’re in the best position to accomplish those goals,” she said. The consultancy firm, Sportsology Group, will help in the search for a new sporting director as well as provide a broader review. Once appointed, a new sporting director will then hire the next head coach of the team although Sportsology will help analyse possible candidates ahead of time. Stewart will remain in his job until February 15 and in a statement released by the federation said he had full confidence in the organisation. “When the opportunity arose to return to the Netherlands to pursue an exciting and challenging role that was near my family, I could not turn it down,” said Stewart. “I am extremely proud of what our sporting department has accomplished over the past four years. This is a pivotal time for the sport in the United States and I have full confidence in the leadership of U.S. Soccer heading into 2026 and beyond,” he said. The conflict between Berhalter and Reyna took a dark turn in early January after US Soccer announced it had launched an investigation into allegations of decades-old domestic violence by Berhalter. Berhalter admitted in a statement on Twitter to kicking the woman who he would later marry during an argument in 1991. Later it emerged that US Soccer had been alerted to the incident by Gio Reyna’s family. Father Claudio Reyna is a former US captain and team-mate of Berhalter’s, while his wife Danielle was a college soccer team-mate of Berhalter’s wife Rosalind. Later on Thursday, Claudio Reyna announced that he was standing down from his role as technical director of Major League Soccer club Austin FC. Reyna will take on an advisory post and said he was looking for “a less all consuming role”. The U.S team, currently being coached on an interim basis by Anthony Hudson, lost 2-1 on Wednesday in a friendly against Serbia in which both countries played under-strength line-ups.

Hakim Ziyech, pe radarul celor de la AC Milan Este vorba despre vedeta londonezilor de la Chelsea, Hakim Ziyech. Conform Football Italia , cei de la AC Milan au decis să nu mai intre în cursa pentru Zaniolo după ce atacantul italian a primit o ofertă din partea celor de la Bournemouth, de 30 de milioane de euro, plus bonusuri. Se pare că Zaniolo și-ar fi dorit să meargă la AC Milan, însă oferta venită din partea clubului din Premier League l-a făcut să se răzgândească. Rossonerii ar fi discutat deja cu cei de la Chelsea despre un posibil transfer al lui Hakim Ziyech, însă lucrurile sunt complicate din cauza salariului pe care îl cere fotbalistul, dar și pentru că marocanul este dorit de mai multe cluburi. Hakim Ziyech s-ar fi autopropus la Chelsea Atacantul marocan ș i-ar dori să ajungă pe Camp Nou , astfel că agenții săi le-au transmis catalanilor că Ziyech este dispus să semneze chiar în această iarnă. Fotbalistul este nemulțumit de minutele primite la Chelsea și vrea să ajungă la o altă echipă la care să poată juca, iar Barcelona pare cea mai bună variantă în acest moment pentru marocan. Nu este pentru prima dată când se vorbește despre un eventual transfer al lui Hakim Ziyech la Barcelona. În 2020, înainte ca Chelsea să rezolve transferul marocanului de la Ajax, atunci când londonezii au plătit 40 de milioane de euro, fotbalistul era și pe lista Barcelonei. Chiar și iarna trecută, Ziyech ar fi putut ajunge la Barcelona. Catalanii au dorit să îl aducă sub formă de împrumut pe Ziyech, însă, în cele din urmă, pe Camp Nou a ajuns Adama Traore .

The spiky, gripping derby clash turned against Diego Simeone’s side in the additional period when defender Stefan Savic was sent off. Atletico took the lead through Alvaro Morata after 19 minutes but Rodrygo’s sensational slalom run past three defenders and slick finish pulled Madrid level with 11 minutes remaining. After Savic’s 99th minute red card, Benzema tucked home from Marco Asensio’s pass and Vinicius netted at the death to send Los Blancos through to the final four for the first time since 2019. The build-up to the derby was tainted when a crude effigy of Vinicius was hung from a bridge near Real Madrid’s training ground, which the club described as “a disgusting act of racism, xenophobia and hatred.” A dummy dressed in a Vinicius shirt was strung up near Real Madrid’s training ground overnight before the game with a message reading “Madrid hates Real.” Both Real Madrid and Atletico, as well as La Liga and the Spanish football federation, spoke out about the incident. The 22-year-old Brazilian forward’s club described the effigy as a “disgusting act of racism, xenophobia and hatred” in a statement. “There’s only one Madrid. We all know,” wrote Vinicius on Twitter after his side eliminated their city rivals to reach the semi-finals. “(Vinicius) controlled the match well, he really wanted to play and he had a very good game,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference. “I think the goal was his reward for his great work. What happened is very regrettable.” Madrid fans had planned to sing Vinicius’ name in support in the 20th minute, matching his shirt number, but were stunned into silence by Morata’s goal moments before. Atletico, hitting their best form of the season, conjured a brilliant move to break the deadlock, with Morata tapping home after Koke’s dink allowed Nahuel Molina to stroke a first-time cross to the back post. Eder Militao might have equalised but headed over from point-blank range, the ball deflecting slightly behind his leap to make the chance harder. Antoine Griezmann was moving with freedom between the lines, relishing his new deeper role and pulling the strings for Atletico as they dominated the first half. Madrid added another name to a long injury list when Ferland Mendy had to be replaced before half-time, with Eduardo Camavinga slotting in at left back and Dani Ceballos coming on. Along with injuries for Dani Carvajal, David Alaba and Lucas Vazquez, it left Madrid without any natural full backs. Benzema was not far away from reaching Fede Valverde’s flick-on from Nacho’s drive, as Madrid started the second half strongly. Jan Oblak produced a fine save to deny the French forward, with Vinicius unable to react quickly enough to finish from the rebound. At the other end, Axel Witsel sent an overhead kick narrowly wide and Thibaut Courtois tipped a vicious Griezmann free kick over as Atletico tried and failed to kill off the game. Rodrygo levelled with 11 minutes to go with his jinking solo effort and subtle near-post finish, taking the game to extra-time. Atletico defender Savic foolishly handed Madrid the edge when he was sent off for two yellow cards in two minutes. The first came during an argument with Vinicius and the second for fouling Camavinga. Madrid immediately began to capitalise when Vinicius crossed for Antonio Rudiger, who headed narrowly wide. Benzema struck lethally after 104 minutes when Vinicius miskicked Marco Asensio’s cross and the ball travelled through to the striker. Madrid, who last won the Copa del Rey in 2014, kept Atletico at bay in the final 15 minutes before Vinicius dribbled through and fired home to clinch the victory. Earlier Athletic Bilbao won 3-1 at Valencia to join record 31-time winners Barcelona and Osasuna in Monday’s semi-final draw.

Will Unwin Walsall v Leicester, Saturday 12.30pm 2) Reds’ return to Brighton Jürgen Klopp was adamant that progress was being made following Liverpool’s drab goalless draw at home to Chelsea, but a truer test awaits the holders on their return to the Amex Stadium. Brighton ripped through Liverpool in the Premier League a fortnight ago, when Klopp described his team’s 3-0 defeat as one of the worst displays of his managerial career. Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Joël Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were all withdrawn in a quadruple substitution midway through the second half against Roberto De Zerbi’s polished side. None have started in the two matches since. Eighteen-year-old Stefan Bajcetic has seized his chance in central midfield, injecting an energy and bite that was previously lacking, while Ibrahima Konaté and Joe Gomez have benefited from the improvement in front of them. Both managers should go strong with no midweek fixtures to concern them. Klopp must hope De Zerbi finds Liverpool unrecognisable.

Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters 3) Cup no distraction for Wrexham The focus at Wrexham in recent times has been off the field, which is unsurprising due to the Hollywood status of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. On the pitch they were unlucky to miss out on promotion last season, coming second to Stockport in the league. Things have been slowly building in north Wales due to the investment of the owners, who know the National League is the hardest division to get out of and to do so they need goals, hence why Paul Mullin was brought in a great expense. Some might think the Cup is a distraction from the all-important battle for promotion but no one in a Wrexham shirt on Sunday will. Instead it will be an opportunity for players to show they are capable of competing with a Sheffield United team three leagues higher, as they already proved at Coventry in the last round . They will be desperate to show that result was not a fluke. WU Wrexham v Sheffield United, Sunday 4.30pm 4) Untimely Hammers blows David Moyes is still in a job after beating Everton last week but this has not been an entirely positive week for the West Ham manager. Victory came at a cost. As if losing Danny Ings for a few weeks was bad enough after the new signing suffered a debut knee injury after his introduction from the bench, West Ham have also discovered Kurt Zouma will be missing for a couple of games. Once again Moyes will be forced into a reshuffle at centre-back. He had welcomed Zouma back from knee surgery and could have done without the defender hurting himself. West Ham’s options are limited following Craig Dawson’s move to Wolves and they will need to take care when they visit Derby. The surging League One side – unbeaten in 14 games – will certainly take heart from the absence of Ings, who was signed to solve West Ham’s goalscoring issues. With Zouma missing, it could be an uncomfortable evening for Moyes. Jacob Steinberg Derby County v West Ham, Monday 7.45pm 5) Does Kane need a rest? Playing against a team in the league below could be the perfect opportunity for Harry Kane to surpass Jimmy Greaves’s Tottenham goalscoring record. The Spurs No 9 drew level with the club legend in Monday’s win over Fulham , meaning his next strike will make history in north London. Antonio Conte, however, needs to perform a balancing act with Kane, who is irreplaceable in the Spurs lineup – in the league at least – and rarely gets a chance to be rested. He has scored three times as many goals this season as Son Heung-min, who is second in the club charts. Richarlison, who needs minutes on the pitch, led the line impressively for Brazil at the World Cup and would be a fine option for Conte to start at Deepdale if he decides Kane cannot play every minute of every game. WU Preston v Tottenham, Saturday 6pm Richarlison could be in line to take the load off Harry Kane. Photograph: Kieran McManus/Shutterstock 6) Weghorst in the spotlight The latest evidence of Erik ten Hag’s apparent Midas touch came in Wout Weghorst’s strike in Manchester United’s 3-0 dismantling of Nottingham Forest – as this was his first goal in only a third appearance since joining temporarily. The 6ft 5in marksman is supposedly solely a deputy to Anthony Martial at No 9 for those games where Marcus Rashford’s pace is not needed to replace the serially-injured Frenchman down the middle. But here lies the great unknown as the second half of the season unfolds: when he is in the XI, will Weghorst’s sluggish pace cost Ten Hag’s team Champions League qualification points and progression in the knockout competitions? If so, this would shine a light on how in the current window United’s owners, the Glazers, failed to back the manager in the same manner Arsenal’s owners did Mikel Arteta. It would cast Weghorst as a sticking-plaster addition unless, of course, the manager can conjure a consistent contribution from the 30-year-old. A further clue will be offered if Weghorst starts (as is expected) against Reading at Old Trafford.

Patrick Bamford has not started for Leeds since the 2-0 defeat at Leicester in October. An injury kept him sidelined from the end of that month until the loss to Aston Villa in mid-January, when he came off the bench to score a consolation goal. Leeds’s goalless draw against Brentford last weekend showed that Jesse Marsch’s side were lacking a true No 9. Despite this, the head coach kept Bamford and the new record signing, Georginio Rutter, back. Bamford came on for 10 minutes, while Rutter remained unused. Saturday’s trip to Accrington seems a perfect opportunity to get as many minutes under Bamford’s belt as possible and move him closer to full match fitness, because he will be very important to Leeds in the run-in if they want to avoid a relegation battle. Rodrigo has done well down the middle but greater variety in forward roles would be a useful asset for Marsch. WU Accrington v Leeds, Saturday, 12.30pm 8) Mariners to call on nomad The Grimsby striker Danilo Orsi-Dadomo has had a nomadic career; he started in London at Cockfosters before moving to the US to play football for a college. Eventually he returned home for a collection of non-league stints in the south-east with East Thurrock United, Hungerford Town and Hampton & Richmond, before a fine season with Maidenhead led to him being snapped up by Harrogate Town in 2021. Since then, however, he has struggled to find the net and was allowed to join Grimsby last summer. Once again he is not a regular, having started three times for the Mariners without scoring, but Paul Hurst has a striker crisis due to injury and ineligibility, and will need to call on Orsi for the trip to Luton. Orsi’s tale is one of an underdog and the FA Cup loves a storyline. WU Luton v Grimsby, Saturday 3pm Danilo Orsi-Dadomo of Grimsby Town.

They have not been playing badly and have not had much luck. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s penalty blunder proved costly against Newcastle and there was a lot to like about Fulham’s general play against Spurs. Where Marco Silva’s side have been lacking, though, is in the final third. They did not make enough chances against Spurs, though Manor Solomon’s cameo off the bench was a positive. The Israel winger was bright after coming on, going close with a bending shot, and will hope to be given a chance against Sunderland. Solomon, who joined from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, needs games. He had a long spell on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury on the opening day of the season and has been restricted to four substitute appearances. Could this be the moment for Silva to unleash him from the start? JS Fulham v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm 10) Apprentice challenges master Under the Etihad Stadium lights this clash can be billed as a potentially titanic master-versus-apprentice clash. Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City take on Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal in a tie that acts as primer for the two Premier League games in February and April between the champions and leaders. The intent of the Arsenal board to end a 19-year title drought is underlined by the €50m January outlay on Leonardo Trossard and Jakob Kiwior, in a move that underlines, too, how thrilled the hierarchy is at how Arteta, once Guardiola’s assistant, has constructed a team worthy of a five-point advantage over his former employers. But the Catalan, now his sporting adversary, is a man driven to win and, despite the gap in the Premier League and recent criticism of his players, Guardiola’s men start as favourites. But, only just – which is the mark of how impressive Arteta and his side are this term.

The midfield warrior made an encouraging debut in the goalless duel with Stockport in midweek. Clayton offered an immediate presence at the start of the short-term contract he signed following his Doncaster exit. He also wasted no time in turning up the volume on the pitch. The Bantams have been accused of being too quiet as a team at times - something that Clayton’s arrival will help to rectify. The 34-year-old feels that being vocal is a vital part of the game that is often overlooked. It is also not easy to master. \"That's something I've prided myself on from probably 26 onwards,” said Clayton. \"Tony Pulis showed me what defensively you can do with your voice from that position and it's something I took on. “I think I've got quite good at it and I quite enjoy it but it is a skill. \"It's not just like talking in the dressing room. You can be a loud, boisterous person and not know how to do that on the pitch. It's all about learning how and what and why. \"It's like learning how to pass. It's not just about being confident and loud; you've got to really learn it. \"If I could choose a skill to start again with at 15, that's probably what I'd choose.” Clayton is 11 games short of reaching 500 in a career now in its 14th year. Being one of the main voices in the team comes easier from having that know-how behind him. He added: \"It comes with experience and you've got to feel like you've got the authority within the group. “You might be a really good young player but you don't want to shout at one of the older players. But it's not that really. \"It's all about understanding. Hopefully that's something I can bring and make others do more.” In-game communication is a “massive thing” for Mark Hughes, who wants players to be able to think on their feet and adapt effectively to changing situations. “We talk time and time again, not only about general play but set-plays, it’s about getting organised early and you have to communicate,” said the City boss. “You have to talk and shout on the pitch just to get yourself sorted. It makes a hard job easier if you are getting help and can impart help. “Being able to communicate loudly, clearly, concisely and correctly is a massive thing for a player. “I will always encourage that. The more guys you have that can take on responsibility and not only do their job but maybe 25-50 per cent of somebody else’s if they are having a bad time. “It just gets players through. It’s important that we have good players who are able to do that.” City captain Richie Smallwood is another vocal presence (Image: Thomas Gadd) Hughes will welcome more noise in the ranks as the Bantams head towards the business end of the campaign and a promotion-defining final 20 games. He wants to see that leadership in the heat of the battle that Clayton will look to add alongside the likes of skipper Richie Smallwood and Alex Gilliead. “At times, I’ve felt we’ve maybe been a little bit quiet on the pitch in terms of organising. We just need more numbers to be more actively involved in that part of the game. “Communication on the pitch is vital and if we can improve that aspect it will allow us to be more effective, in my view. “Players will lead in different ways. “Richie is a talker but he leads by example as well. Adam was someone who was always quite vocal. “We’ve got other leaders in the group. Gilly is great in that regard, leading by example. “We have got leadership but if you can add to it, as long with the ability of the player, then that’s a good thing.” Hughes has noticed a change in the dressing room since he started out in management. Players are now likely to look more to their coaches for advice during games. “There are always ways and means to make yourself heard. “I think there is more of an onus on looking to the sideline rather than understanding what’s happening in a game. “It’s quite difficult to recognise what the opposition are doing when you’re in the heat of a football match. “You are trying to cope with what demands have been placed on you as an individual and it can be difficult. It takes a lot of talent and experience to recognise what is happening as you’re within the game. “You don’t see a lot of players being able to understand what’s required at any given time. It becomes more prevalent that coaches and managers on the sideline have to sort things out from afar. “You can improve that aspect of your team and hopefully players will step up and take up the slack.” The rise in the number of foreign players, particularly in the Premier League, has meant managers have also had to adapt their approach. Hughes saw that during his 14 years at the helm with six clubs in the top flight. But leaders can still emerge within the squad. “When I was playing and starting managing, the make-up of the dressing room were predominantly British-based players,” he added. “That’s not the case anymore. There’s a lot of diversity in it and managing the same and reacting to poor play is a little bit dangerous if you’ve got different cultures. “Players from different countries with different attitudes take criticism in different ways. “You have to learn and understand that and recognise it could be a problem if you just bowled in and managed like you did 15-20 years ago. “It does change but it’s still about good leadership there. “It’s not necessarily just British-based players that have that character. “One of the best leaders I was ever involved with was Vincent Kompany. “He came to these shores and straight away from the first moment I was in his company, I realised he was a guy who was going to lead people. “You never know. You have to work and be around them to understand what they do. “But if you have one, two, three or even more (leaders) in your group then that’s going to help you.”","pubDate":"2023-01-27 00:01:00","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/16392317/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Ronaldo’s Al Nassr knocked out of Saudi Super Cup","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-ronaldo-s-al-nassr-knocked-out-of-saudi-super-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 27, 2023 7:14 AMRIYADH - Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr were knocked of the Saudi Super Cup on Thursday after a 3-1 semi-final loss to Al Ittihad in Riyadh.","content":"RIYADH - Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr were knocked of the Saudi Super Cup on Thursday after a 3-1 semi-final loss to Al Ittihad in Riyadh.

Sporting director Earnie Stewart is leaving to join Dutch club PSV Eindhoven and general manager Brian McBride has stood down from his role, U.S. Soccer said. National team coach Gregg Berhalter, who guided the team to the last-16 at December’s World Cup in Qatar, is out of contract, no longer working with the team and his future remains uncertain. Berhalter is facing an investigation by the federation for a 1991 domestic violence incident. The incident came to light following the controversy surrounding Berhalter’s tense relationship with Borussia Dortmund player Gio Reyna at the World Cup in Qatar. U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone told an online press conference that they had now hired a consultancy company to begin a full review of the organisation’s sports department. With vacancies in three top jobs, Parlow Cone said they would take their time to conclude various reviews and make the new appointments. “We’re not going to rush it,” she said. “I know this moment feels a bit uncertain for you in the media, for our staff, for players. What it actually is a clean canvas,” she added. U.S. Soccer chief executive officer J.T. Batson said the Berhalter saga had not had any impact on the decisions of Stewart and McBride to leave the organisation. The United States, along with Mexico and Canada, will host the World Cup in 2026 but rather than begin building on the progress made by the promising young team, the federation now must find key personnel and deal with the fall-out of the Berhalter-Reyna row. Parlow Cone, who said she would like a new head coach in place “by the end of summer” said the departures allowed the federation to assess its direction. “We did not plan it this way but we find ourselves in this position and we’re going to take the opportunity to really do a deep dive on our sporting side to make sure we’re as effective and as efficient as possible, because we have grand vision of where we want to go on the sporting side and we want to make sure we’re in the best position to accomplish those goals,” she said. The consultancy firm, Sportsology Group, will help in the search for a new sporting director as well as provide a broader review. Once appointed, a new sporting director will then hire the next head coach of the team although Sportsology will help analyse possible candidates ahead of time. Stewart will remain in his job until February 15 and in a statement released by the federation said he had full confidence in the organisation. “When the opportunity arose to return to the Netherlands to pursue an exciting and challenging role that was near my family, I could not turn it down,” said Stewart. “I am extremely proud of what our sporting department has accomplished over the past four years. This is a pivotal time for the sport in the United States and I have full confidence in the leadership of U.S. Soccer heading into 2026 and beyond,” he said. The conflict between Berhalter and Reyna took a dark turn in early January after US Soccer announced it had launched an investigation into allegations of decades-old domestic violence by Berhalter. Berhalter admitted in a statement on Twitter to kicking the woman who he would later marry during an argument in 1991. Later it emerged that US Soccer had been alerted to the incident by Gio Reyna’s family. Father Claudio Reyna is a former US captain and team-mate of Berhalter’s, while his wife Danielle was a college soccer team-mate of Berhalter’s wife Rosalind. Later on Thursday, Claudio Reyna announced that he was standing down from his role as technical director of Major League Soccer club Austin FC. Reyna will take on an advisory post and said he was looking for “a less all consuming role”. The U.S team, currently being coached on an interim basis by Anthony Hudson, lost 2-1 on Wednesday in a friendly against Serbia in which both countries played under-strength line-ups.

Hakim Ziyech, pe radarul celor de la AC Milan Este vorba despre vedeta londonezilor de la Chelsea, Hakim Ziyech. Conform Football Italia , cei de la AC Milan au decis să nu mai intre în cursa pentru Zaniolo după ce atacantul italian a primit o ofertă din partea celor de la Bournemouth, de 30 de milioane de euro, plus bonusuri. Se pare că Zaniolo și-ar fi dorit să meargă la AC Milan, însă oferta venită din partea clubului din Premier League l-a făcut să se răzgândească. Rossonerii ar fi discutat deja cu cei de la Chelsea despre un posibil transfer al lui Hakim Ziyech, însă lucrurile sunt complicate din cauza salariului pe care îl cere fotbalistul, dar și pentru că marocanul este dorit de mai multe cluburi. Hakim Ziyech s-ar fi autopropus la Chelsea Atacantul marocan ș i-ar dori să ajungă pe Camp Nou , astfel că agenții săi le-au transmis catalanilor că Ziyech este dispus să semneze chiar în această iarnă. Fotbalistul este nemulțumit de minutele primite la Chelsea și vrea să ajungă la o altă echipă la care să poată juca, iar Barcelona pare cea mai bună variantă în acest moment pentru marocan. Nu este pentru prima dată când se vorbește despre un eventual transfer al lui Hakim Ziyech la Barcelona. În 2020, înainte ca Chelsea să rezolve transferul marocanului de la Ajax, atunci când londonezii au plătit 40 de milioane de euro, fotbalistul era și pe lista Barcelonei. Chiar și iarna trecută, Ziyech ar fi putut ajunge la Barcelona. Catalanii au dorit să îl aducă sub formă de împrumut pe Ziyech, însă, în cele din urmă, pe Camp Nou a ajuns Adama Traore .
