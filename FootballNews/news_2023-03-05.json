The Blues won the match at Stamford Bridge by a scoreline of 1-0. Wesley Fofana, who returned to action after a lengthy injury lay-off, scored the only goal of the match from a corner. The Blues finally won a league match after a barren run of five matches. While the result was certainly a much welcome one for Graham Potter's side, Dawson was not convinced with Havertz's performance. He told Sky Sports News: Havertz took only one shot on target, completed and attempted zero dribbles, and completed one cross during the match against Leeds United. The former Bayer Leverkusen star, who was an important player for Chelsea during the initial days of his career at the club, has struggled for form in recent times. In 32 matches this season, Havertz has scored only six goals and has provided one assist. Since his arrival at Stamford Bridge in 2020, the German international has scored 29 goals and has provided 15 assists in 124 matches for the west Londoners. The Blues , meanwhile, remained in 10th spot despite their win. They currently have 34 points on the board after 25 league games. Chelsea's recent lack of form has seen the pressure pile on Graham Potter's position as the manager. The win against Leeds United was a temporary relief not only for Potter, but for the entire club. Potter acknowledged and told the media after the game that the team deserved the win after suffering so much.

Stroud has decided not to run the 40-yard dash during his Saturday NFL Scouting Combine performance. Stroud is thought to be one of the top two quarterbacks in the 2023 NFL Draft. Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Bryce Young and Florida Gators quarterback Anthony Richardson are the other top two guys at the position. There's little mystery as to why Stroud has decided not to run the 40. There's not much for him to gain, since he's not thought to be a running quarterback by any means. He excels at manipulating the pocket and evading pressure, not by running to evade defenders and get yards with his legs. For guys like Anthony Richardson and Bryce Young, proving that they're fast and can throw on the move was very important. Not so much for the Ohio State product. Everyone knows that he has a pretty deep ball. He's trying to concentrate his powers on being the best thrower in the bunch on Saturday. The top quarterbacks in the 2023 NFL Draft are clear, but they all come with a caveat that makes it difficult to decide which one is the best. Alabama's Bryce Young remains the favorite to be the number one pick. He has been one of the most dominant players in college football for the past two years. There's no doubt about his quality. The problem is that he is the same size as Kyler Murray and is considered small by NFL standards. Some teams will be disengaged in picking him. Ohio State's C.J. Stroud is 1B, as he has the best fundamentals of the class and his mechanics are clean, but he does not have the same athletic ability as the other guys. He's an excellent quarterback, but he does not have the same ability to evade defenders and run the ball. It's not going to be a surprise if one of these QBs is selected with the number one overall pick, provided there's a trade with the Chicago Bears for the first overall pick. They're both extremely talented and merit a high pick.

Richardson set an NFL Combine record for quarterbacks with a 40.5-inch vertical jump. His 10-foot-9-inch broad jump was also a record for the position. The Florida Gator blew the rest of the quarterbacks out of the park in terms of physique. He looks more like a cross between running back and linebacker than a quarterback. Richardson hasn't even run his final 40-yard dash, and he's already trending on social media thanks to his record-breaking feats. He might not be the best thrower in his class or the most accurate, but he sure is the most athletic player in his position coming into this year's draft. On Saturday, Anthony Richardson measured in at 6-foot-4 while weighing in at 244 pounds. This comes a mere day after it was reported that Richardson charmed NFL teams during the interview process. He also recorded a ridiculous 40.5-inch vertical leap, which the NFL's research department said was the highest for a quarterback since 2003. As if that wasn't enough, the Florida State University alum put up a startling 10' 9\" broad jump, the NFL Combine record for a quarterback. Before the draft, scouts and analysts were already raving about how special of a specimen Anthony Richardson was. Nothing could prepare the NFL for what they witnessed in Saturday's session of the NFL Combine . Richardson is solidifying his top 10 prospects. Since there's no consensus number one this year, fans should consider a team taking Richardson number one in late April. We've never seen a player like Richardson heading into the modern NFL; his physical tools are phenomenal. Instagram Post Anthony Richardson had a tipsy-turvy college football career, as he was the Florida Gators starter for one year. He played four games in his first year at Florida in 2020, making one of two passes for 27 yards with a passing touchdown and an interception. He redshirted his first year of university eligibility. Richardson entered the 2021 season as the backup to Emory Jones but still earned more playing time. Richardson's breakthrough year was 2022, as he utilized his newly acquired starting role. The highlight of his season came when he helped the Gators pull off an unlikely win over the heavily favored seventh-ranked Utah Utes. Richardson paid his dues at the college level and declared for the 2023 NFL Draft . He put up a stat line of 3,105 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. He also totaled 1,116 rushing yards and 12 TDs on the ground. Simply put, Richardson is built differently, and it will be fun watching him take on the big leagues.

While the Uruguayan striker required 301 games to score 200 goals, Mbappe has accomplished the feat in just 247 matches. Speaking after the game to Canal Plus (via PSG Report), he revealed: He continued: Born and raised in Paris, Kylian Mbappe joined the club from Monaco in 2017 for a world-record transfer fee of €180 million, the highest amount paid for a teenager at the time. However, his tenure at the Parc des Princes has not been free of controversy. A prolonged transfer saga with Real Madrid caused a strain in relations with fans before he eventually signed a three-year contract extension with PSG in May last year. In a thrilling encounter at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, Lionel Messi showcased his masterclass by breaking the deadlock with his 18th goal of the season. Jaouen Hadjam's unfortunate own goal just 17 minutes in only added to Nantes' misery. However, Nantes refused to be cowed and Ludovic Blas capitalized on Gianluigi Donnarumma's error, finding the back of the net to give his side a glimmer of hope. Ignatius Ganago then leveled the scoreline with a powerful header, setting the stage for a pulsating first half. But the Parisians weren't going to let this slip away, and Danilo Pereira's well-timed header restored their lead in the second half.

Though an assist may not seem like much, in the context of Chelsea's recent goal drought, it was a vital contribution that could prove to be a turning point for the team. With their recent losses adding pressure to the squad, the win over Leeds was a step in the right direction, and hopefully, it will mark the beginning of a new winning streak. As Chilwell put it in his latest Instagram post, \"Let's take this momentum into Tuesday,\" urging his teammates to carry their newfound confidence into the game against Dortmund. Instagram Post However, it won't be an easy feat, given the recent form of both teams. Though the Blues had the upper hand in the first leg, they were unable to convert their chances. Against Leeds, they missed three golden opportunities, indicating that their goalscoring struggles continued. Nonetheless, the victory against Leeds was a much-needed confidence boost, and the Blues will need to carry that momentum into their upcoming match against Dortmund.

Under the guidance of Christophe Galtier, PSG have extended their lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table to an impressive 11 points, a significant margin given their recent struggles in the league. The hosts drew first blood in the 12th minute when Lionel Messi finished off a slick team move, linking up with Sergio Ramos in midfield before receiving a deflected cross from Nuno Mendes. Just a few minutes later, the hosts doubled their lead thanks to Jaouen Hadjam's own goal as he deflected Nordi Mukiele's effort into his own net. Nantes pulled one back against the run of play in the 30th minute as Ludovic Blas found the back of the net after skipping past Vitinha and Mukiele on the right touchline. Messi almost restored the PSG's two-goal advantage with a snap-shot from the edge of the box that sailed just over the crossbar, before goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made a costly mistake, spilling a shot from Florent Mollet, but Marquinhos cleared the danger just in time. From the ensuing corner, Nantes equalized when Ignatius Ganago flicked Mollet's delivery into the net at the near post, with the help of Jean-Charles Castelletto. PSG were presented with an excellent opportunity to regain their lead shortly after halftime. However, Mukiele stumbled and played an errant pass behind Kylian Mbappe, despite having the option to shoot or pass to his teammate. Nonetheless, the home team found themselves in the lead once again in the 60th minute, as Danilo Pereira nodded in a cross from Mbappe after Nantes cleared a corner. Lionel Messi had two efforts from free-kicks, but the Argentine playmaker could not get them past goalkeeper Alban Lafont. Mbappe, who was on the cusp of breaking PSG's all-time scoring record, missed the opportunity to do so when his 25-yard shot narrowly missed the mark. In addition, Lafont's quick reflexes prevented Warren Zaire-Emery from scoring late on. Substitute Timothee Pembele came on in stoppage time and provided a magnificent assist to Kylian Mbappe, who turned and fired the ball into the back of the net.

The Blues have struggled to score in recent months, and despite securing three points with Wesley Fofana's headed goal, they still missed other major chances during the match. Havertz's miss was particularly glaring, as he failed to beat Leeds' goalkeeper Illan Meslier in a one-on-one situation created by Raheem Sterling's well-placed pass. Agbonlahor was clearly unimpressed with Havertz's performance. Speaking to TalkSPORT (via ChelseaChronicle), the former Aston Villa man explained: With Joao Felix also hitting the crossbar in the match, the Blues could have made their win much more comfortable. However, unless they start converting these big chances, their recent struggles in front of goal could continue, and their victory against Leeds may only be a temporary reprieve. The Blues notably have a massive game against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday - their only chance at silverware this season. In a hard-fought encounter at Stamford Bridge, defender Wesley Fofana's towering header proved to be the difference as Chelsea secured a crucial 1-0 victory over a resilient Leeds United side on Saturday. The Blues started the match brightly, dominating possession and creating several early chances. Joao Felix, on loan from Atletico Madrid, came closest to breaking the deadlock with a fierce strike that crashed against the crossbar. However, it was not until the 53rd minute that Fofana rose the highest to nod in a corner from the impressive Ben Chilwell, much to the relief of the home crowd. It was only the second goal the Blues had scored at home in 2023 and provided a much-needed boost for under-fire coach Graham Potter. Leeds, who have struggled away from home this season, pushed hard for an equalizer in the second half, but the hosts defended resolutely to hold on for the win.

But the Gunners showed they can cope with the pressure of the title race with a remarkable comeback that kept them five points ahead of second placed City. “I’m incredibly happy. It was just mad. It was a really special win and it took until the last second to earn it,” Arteta said. Arsenal hadn’t even touched the ball when Philip Billing gave bottom of the table Bournemouth the lead after just 9.11 seconds with a clinical finish from inside the Gunners area. The quickest goal in Premier League history was scored by Shane Long after 7.69 seconds for Southampton against Watford in 2019. Arsenal fell further behind in the 57 th minute as Marcos Senesi escaped Thomas Partey to glance a header past Aaron Ramsdale from a corner. Partey made amends for his slack marking five minutes later when he reduced the deficit with a close-range finish from Emile Smith-Rowe’s header. Underlining their desire to win a first title since 2004, Arsenal seized the momentum and equalised through Ben White’s powerful finish from Nelson’s cross in the 70 th minute. Nelson completed Arsenal’s incredible revival in the seventh minute of stoppage-time when the substitute produced a superb finish from 20 yards to spark scenes of wild celebration all around the Emirates Stadium. “They never gave up. We want to stay there (at the top) for as long as possible,” Arteta said. Earlier yesterday, City rode their luck in a 2-0 win over Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium. Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva scored the goals for the champions, who were let off the hook by a series of glaring misses from the visitors. Sean Longstaff, Callum Wilson and Joelinton were all guilty of not even forcing Ederson into a save as fifth placed Newcastle suffered another blow to their hopes of a top-four finish. “It was an incredibly good result for us because it was a tricky game,” City boss Pep Guardiola said. Potter gets a break Wesley Fofana eased the pressure on Chelsea boss Graham Potter as the French defender sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds at Stamford Bridge. Fofana put Chelsea in front with his first league goal for the club seven minutes after half-time, the former Leicester centre-back rising to head home from Ben Chilwell’s corner. It was Chelsea’s first goal in 396 minutes and just their second in seven games in all competitions. The 10 th placed Blues held on for just their third win in their last 16 games in all competitions. Ending a run of three successive defeats will give Potter a little breathing space ahead of Chelsea’s bid to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Borussia Dortmund next week. “We’ve had to suffer. It’s been a challenging period. We were a team who had something to lose so it was great character from the players. It gives us something to build on,” Potter said. Fourth placed Tottenham’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were rocked by a 1-0 defeat at Wolves. Just days after losing 1-0 at second tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round, the north Londoners were beaten again as Adama Traore struck in the 82 nd minute, driving the rebound in off the bar after Raul Jimenez’s effort was saved. Southampton climbed off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 victory against Leicester as Carlos Alcaraz scored the 35 th minute winner at St Mary’s. Brighton kept West Ham in relegation trouble with a 4-0 victory at the Amex Stadium courtesy of goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Joel Veltman, Kaori Mitoma and Danny Welbeck.

Stroud has decided not to run the 40-yard dash during his Saturday NFL Scouting Combine performance. Stroud is thought to be one of the top two quarterbacks in the 2023 NFL Draft. Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Bryce Young and Florida Gators quarterback Anthony Richardson are the other top two guys at the position. There's little mystery as to why Stroud has decided not to run the 40. There's not much for him to gain, since he's not thought to be a running quarterback by any means. He excels at manipulating the pocket and evading pressure, not by running to evade defenders and get yards with his legs. For guys like Anthony Richardson and Bryce Young, proving that they're fast and can throw on the move was very important. Not so much for the Ohio State product. Everyone knows that he has a pretty deep ball. He's trying to concentrate his powers on being the best thrower in the bunch on Saturday. The top quarterbacks in the 2023 NFL Draft are clear, but they all come with a caveat that makes it difficult to decide which one is the best. Alabama's Bryce Young remains the favorite to be the number one pick. He has been one of the most dominant players in college football for the past two years. There's no doubt about his quality. The problem is that he is the same size as Kyler Murray and is considered small by NFL standards. Some teams will be disengaged in picking him. Ohio State's C.J. Stroud is 1B, as he has the best fundamentals of the class and his mechanics are clean, but he does not have the same athletic ability as the other guys. He's an excellent quarterback, but he does not have the same ability to evade defenders and run the ball. It's not going to be a surprise if one of these QBs is selected with the number one overall pick, provided there's a trade with the Chicago Bears for the first overall pick. They're both extremely talented and merit a high pick.

Richardson set an NFL Combine record for quarterbacks with a 40.5-inch vertical jump. His 10-foot-9-inch broad jump was also a record for the position. The Florida Gator blew the rest of the quarterbacks out of the park in terms of physique. He looks more like a cross between running back and linebacker than a quarterback. Richardson hasn't even run his final 40-yard dash, and he's already trending on social media thanks to his record-breaking feats. He might not be the best thrower in his class or the most accurate, but he sure is the most athletic player in his position coming into this year's draft. On Saturday, Anthony Richardson measured in at 6-foot-4 while weighing in at 244 pounds. This comes a mere day after it was reported that Richardson charmed NFL teams during the interview process. He also recorded a ridiculous 40.5-inch vertical leap, which the NFL's research department said was the highest for a quarterback since 2003. As if that wasn't enough, the Florida State University alum put up a startling 10' 9\" broad jump, the NFL Combine record for a quarterback. Before the draft, scouts and analysts were already raving about how special of a specimen Anthony Richardson was. Nothing could prepare the NFL for what they witnessed in Saturday's session of the NFL Combine . Richardson is solidifying his top 10 prospects. Since there's no consensus number one this year, fans should consider a team taking Richardson number one in late April. We've never seen a player like Richardson heading into the modern NFL; his physical tools are phenomenal. Instagram Post Anthony Richardson had a tipsy-turvy college football career, as he was the Florida Gators starter for one year. He played four games in his first year at Florida in 2020, making one of two passes for 27 yards with a passing touchdown and an interception. He redshirted his first year of university eligibility. Richardson entered the 2021 season as the backup to Emory Jones but still earned more playing time. Richardson's breakthrough year was 2022, as he utilized his newly acquired starting role. The highlight of his season came when he helped the Gators pull off an unlikely win over the heavily favored seventh-ranked Utah Utes. Richardson paid his dues at the college level and declared for the 2023 NFL Draft . He put up a stat line of 3,105 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. He also totaled 1,116 rushing yards and 12 TDs on the ground. Simply put, Richardson is built differently, and it will be fun watching him take on the big leagues.

While the Uruguayan striker required 301 games to score 200 goals, Mbappe has accomplished the feat in just 247 matches. Speaking after the game to Canal Plus (via PSG Report), he revealed: He continued: Born and raised in Paris, Kylian Mbappe joined the club from Monaco in 2017 for a world-record transfer fee of €180 million, the highest amount paid for a teenager at the time. However, his tenure at the Parc des Princes has not been free of controversy. A prolonged transfer saga with Real Madrid caused a strain in relations with fans before he eventually signed a three-year contract extension with PSG in May last year. In a thrilling encounter at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, Lionel Messi showcased his masterclass by breaking the deadlock with his 18th goal of the season. Jaouen Hadjam's unfortunate own goal just 17 minutes in only added to Nantes' misery. However, Nantes refused to be cowed and Ludovic Blas capitalized on Gianluigi Donnarumma's error, finding the back of the net to give his side a glimmer of hope. Ignatius Ganago then leveled the scoreline with a powerful header, setting the stage for a pulsating first half. But the Parisians weren't going to let this slip away, and Danilo Pereira's well-timed header restored their lead in the second half.

Though an assist may not seem like much, in the context of Chelsea's recent goal drought, it was a vital contribution that could prove to be a turning point for the team. With their recent losses adding pressure to the squad, the win over Leeds was a step in the right direction, and hopefully, it will mark the beginning of a new winning streak. As Chilwell put it in his latest Instagram post, \"Let's take this momentum into Tuesday,\" urging his teammates to carry their newfound confidence into the game against Dortmund. Instagram Post However, it won't be an easy feat, given the recent form of both teams. Though the Blues had the upper hand in the first leg, they were unable to convert their chances. Against Leeds, they missed three golden opportunities, indicating that their goalscoring struggles continued. Nonetheless, the victory against Leeds was a much-needed confidence boost, and the Blues will need to carry that momentum into their upcoming match against Dortmund.

Under the guidance of Christophe Galtier, PSG have extended their lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table to an impressive 11 points, a significant margin given their recent struggles in the league. The hosts drew first blood in the 12th minute when Lionel Messi finished off a slick team move, linking up with Sergio Ramos in midfield before receiving a deflected cross from Nuno Mendes. Just a few minutes later, the hosts doubled their lead thanks to Jaouen Hadjam's own goal as he deflected Nordi Mukiele's effort into his own net. Nantes pulled one back against the run of play in the 30th minute as Ludovic Blas found the back of the net after skipping past Vitinha and Mukiele on the right touchline. Messi almost restored the PSG's two-goal advantage with a snap-shot from the edge of the box that sailed just over the crossbar, before goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made a costly mistake, spilling a shot from Florent Mollet, but Marquinhos cleared the danger just in time. From the ensuing corner, Nantes equalized when Ignatius Ganago flicked Mollet's delivery into the net at the near post, with the help of Jean-Charles Castelletto. PSG were presented with an excellent opportunity to regain their lead shortly after halftime. However, Mukiele stumbled and played an errant pass behind Kylian Mbappe, despite having the option to shoot or pass to his teammate. Nonetheless, the home team found themselves in the lead once again in the 60th minute, as Danilo Pereira nodded in a cross from Mbappe after Nantes cleared a corner. Lionel Messi had two efforts from free-kicks, but the Argentine playmaker could not get them past goalkeeper Alban Lafont. Mbappe, who was on the cusp of breaking PSG's all-time scoring record, missed the opportunity to do so when his 25-yard shot narrowly missed the mark. In addition, Lafont's quick reflexes prevented Warren Zaire-Emery from scoring late on. Substitute Timothee Pembele came on in stoppage time and provided a magnificent assist to Kylian Mbappe, who turned and fired the ball into the back of the net.

The Blues have struggled to score in recent months, and despite securing three points with Wesley Fofana's headed goal, they still missed other major chances during the match. Havertz's miss was particularly glaring, as he failed to beat Leeds' goalkeeper Illan Meslier in a one-on-one situation created by Raheem Sterling's well-placed pass. Agbonlahor was clearly unimpressed with Havertz's performance. Speaking to TalkSPORT (via ChelseaChronicle), the former Aston Villa man explained: With Joao Felix also hitting the crossbar in the match, the Blues could have made their win much more comfortable. However, unless they start converting these big chances, their recent struggles in front of goal could continue, and their victory against Leeds may only be a temporary reprieve. The Blues notably have a massive game against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday - their only chance at silverware this season. In a hard-fought encounter at Stamford Bridge, defender Wesley Fofana's towering header proved to be the difference as Chelsea secured a crucial 1-0 victory over a resilient Leeds United side on Saturday. The Blues started the match brightly, dominating possession and creating several early chances. Joao Felix, on loan from Atletico Madrid, came closest to breaking the deadlock with a fierce strike that crashed against the crossbar. However, it was not until the 53rd minute that Fofana rose the highest to nod in a corner from the impressive Ben Chilwell, much to the relief of the home crowd. It was only the second goal the Blues had scored at home in 2023 and provided a much-needed boost for under-fire coach Graham Potter. Leeds, who have struggled away from home this season, pushed hard for an equalizer in the second half, but the hosts defended resolutely to hold on for the win.

But the Gunners showed they can cope with the pressure of the title race with a remarkable comeback that kept them five points ahead of second placed City. “I’m incredibly happy. It was just mad. It was a really special win and it took until the last second to earn it,” Arteta said. Arsenal hadn’t even touched the ball when Philip Billing gave bottom of the table Bournemouth the lead after just 9.11 seconds with a clinical finish from inside the Gunners area. The quickest goal in Premier League history was scored by Shane Long after 7.69 seconds for Southampton against Watford in 2019. Arsenal fell further behind in the 57 th minute as Marcos Senesi escaped Thomas Partey to glance a header past Aaron Ramsdale from a corner. Partey made amends for his slack marking five minutes later when he reduced the deficit with a close-range finish from Emile Smith-Rowe’s header. Underlining their desire to win a first title since 2004, Arsenal seized the momentum and equalised through Ben White’s powerful finish from Nelson’s cross in the 70 th minute. Nelson completed Arsenal’s incredible revival in the seventh minute of stoppage-time when the substitute produced a superb finish from 20 yards to spark scenes of wild celebration all around the Emirates Stadium. “They never gave up. We want to stay there (at the top) for as long as possible,” Arteta said. Earlier yesterday, City rode their luck in a 2-0 win over Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium. Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva scored the goals for the champions, who were let off the hook by a series of glaring misses from the visitors. Sean Longstaff, Callum Wilson and Joelinton were all guilty of not even forcing Ederson into a save as fifth placed Newcastle suffered another blow to their hopes of a top-four finish. “It was an incredibly good result for us because it was a tricky game,” City boss Pep Guardiola said. Potter gets a break Wesley Fofana eased the pressure on Chelsea boss Graham Potter as the French defender sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds at Stamford Bridge. Fofana put Chelsea in front with his first league goal for the club seven minutes after half-time, the former Leicester centre-back rising to head home from Ben Chilwell’s corner. It was Chelsea’s first goal in 396 minutes and just their second in seven games in all competitions. The 10 th placed Blues held on for just their third win in their last 16 games in all competitions. Ending a run of three successive defeats will give Potter a little breathing space ahead of Chelsea’s bid to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Borussia Dortmund next week. “We’ve had to suffer. It’s been a challenging period. We were a team who had something to lose so it was great character from the players. It gives us something to build on,” Potter said. Fourth placed Tottenham’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were rocked by a 1-0 defeat at Wolves. Just days after losing 1-0 at second tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round, the north Londoners were beaten again as Adama Traore struck in the 82 nd minute, driving the rebound in off the bar after Raul Jimenez’s effort was saved. Southampton climbed off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 victory against Leicester as Carlos Alcaraz scored the 35 th minute winner at St Mary’s. Brighton kept West Ham in relegation trouble with a 4-0 victory at the Amex Stadium courtesy of goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Joel Veltman, Kaori Mitoma and Danny Welbeck.

Richardson set an NFL Combine record for quarterbacks with a 40.5-inch vertical jump. His 10-foot-9-inch broad jump was also a record for the position. The Florida Gator blew the rest of the quarterbacks out of the park in terms of physique. He looks more like a cross between running back and linebacker than a quarterback. Richardson hasn't even run his final 40-yard dash, and he's already trending on social media thanks to his record-breaking feats. He might not be the best thrower in his class or the most accurate, but he sure is the most athletic player in his position coming into this year's draft. On Saturday, Anthony Richardson measured in at 6-foot-4 while weighing in at 244 pounds. This comes a mere day after it was reported that Richardson charmed NFL teams during the interview process. He also recorded a ridiculous 40.5-inch vertical leap, which the NFL's research department said was the highest for a quarterback since 2003. As if that wasn't enough, the Florida State University alum put up a startling 10' 9\" broad jump, the NFL Combine record for a quarterback. Before the draft, scouts and analysts were already raving about how special of a specimen Anthony Richardson was. Nothing could prepare the NFL for what they witnessed in Saturday's session of the NFL Combine . Richardson is solidifying his top 10 prospects. Since there's no consensus number one this year, fans should consider a team taking Richardson number one in late April. We've never seen a player like Richardson heading into the modern NFL; his physical tools are phenomenal. Instagram Post Anthony Richardson had a tipsy-turvy college football career, as he was the Florida Gators starter for one year. He played four games in his first year at Florida in 2020, making one of two passes for 27 yards with a passing touchdown and an interception. He redshirted his first year of university eligibility. Richardson entered the 2021 season as the backup to Emory Jones but still earned more playing time. Richardson's breakthrough year was 2022, as he utilized his newly acquired starting role. The highlight of his season came when he helped the Gators pull off an unlikely win over the heavily favored seventh-ranked Utah Utes. Richardson paid his dues at the college level and declared for the 2023 NFL Draft . He put up a stat line of 3,105 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. He also totaled 1,116 rushing yards and 12 TDs on the ground. Simply put, Richardson is built differently, and it will be fun watching him take on the big leagues.

While the Uruguayan striker required 301 games to score 200 goals, Mbappe has accomplished the feat in just 247 matches. Speaking after the game to Canal Plus (via PSG Report), he revealed: He continued: Born and raised in Paris, Kylian Mbappe joined the club from Monaco in 2017 for a world-record transfer fee of €180 million, the highest amount paid for a teenager at the time. However, his tenure at the Parc des Princes has not been free of controversy. A prolonged transfer saga with Real Madrid caused a strain in relations with fans before he eventually signed a three-year contract extension with PSG in May last year. In a thrilling encounter at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, Lionel Messi showcased his masterclass by breaking the deadlock with his 18th goal of the season. Jaouen Hadjam's unfortunate own goal just 17 minutes in only added to Nantes' misery. However, Nantes refused to be cowed and Ludovic Blas capitalized on Gianluigi Donnarumma's error, finding the back of the net to give his side a glimmer of hope. Ignatius Ganago then leveled the scoreline with a powerful header, setting the stage for a pulsating first half. But the Parisians weren't going to let this slip away, and Danilo Pereira's well-timed header restored their lead in the second half.

Chilwell's performance against Leeds United was exemplary, as the defender's attacking display created Wesley Fofana's match-winning goal. Though an assist may not seem like much, in the context of Chelsea's recent goal drought, it was a vital contribution that could prove to be a turning point for the team. With their recent losses adding pressure to the squad, the win over Leeds was a step in the right direction, and hopefully, it will mark the beginning of a new winning streak. As Chilwell put it in his latest Instagram post, \"Let's take this momentum into Tuesday,\" urging his teammates to carry their newfound confidence into the game against Dortmund. Instagram Post However, it won't be an easy feat, given the recent form of both teams. Though the Blues had the upper hand in the first leg, they were unable to convert their chances. Against Leeds, they missed three golden opportunities, indicating that their goalscoring struggles continued. Nonetheless, the victory against Leeds was a much-needed confidence boost, and the Blues will need to carry that momentum into their upcoming match against Dortmund. Failing to do so would mean elimination from the Champions League. The odds may be stacked against them, but with Chilwell's rallying cry and a renewed sense of confidence, the Blues will look to turn the tide and emerge victorious. The Chelsea boss might have wanted more goals, but he will have to make do with the single effort that provided his side with all three points on Saturday.

Under the guidance of Christophe Galtier, PSG have extended their lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table to an impressive 11 points, a significant margin given their recent struggles in the league. The hosts drew first blood in the 12th minute when Lionel Messi finished off a slick team move, linking up with Sergio Ramos in midfield before receiving a deflected cross from Nuno Mendes. Just a few minutes later, the hosts doubled their lead thanks to Jaouen Hadjam's own goal as he deflected Nordi Mukiele's effort into his own net. Nantes pulled one back against the run of play in the 30th minute as Ludovic Blas found the back of the net after skipping past Vitinha and Mukiele on the right touchline. Messi almost restored the PSG's two-goal advantage with a snap-shot from the edge of the box that sailed just over the crossbar, before goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made a costly mistake, spilling a shot from Florent Mollet, but Marquinhos cleared the danger just in time. From the ensuing corner, Nantes equalized when Ignatius Ganago flicked Mollet's delivery into the net at the near post, with the help of Jean-Charles Castelletto. PSG were presented with an excellent opportunity to regain their lead shortly after halftime. However, Mukiele stumbled and played an errant pass behind Kylian Mbappe, despite having the option to shoot or pass to his teammate. Nonetheless, the home team found themselves in the lead once again in the 60th minute, as Danilo Pereira nodded in a cross from Mbappe after Nantes cleared a corner. Lionel Messi had two efforts from free-kicks, but the Argentine playmaker could not get them past goalkeeper Alban Lafont. Mbappe, who was on the cusp of breaking PSG's all-time scoring record, missed the opportunity to do so when his 25-yard shot narrowly missed the mark. In addition, Lafont's quick reflexes prevented Warren Zaire-Emery from scoring late on. Substitute Timothee Pembele came on in stoppage time and provided a magnificent assist to Kylian Mbappe, who turned and fired the ball into the back of the net. This goal enabled him to surpass Edinson Cavani as the club's all-time leading scorer.

The Blues have struggled to score in recent months, and despite securing three points with Wesley Fofana's headed goal, they still missed other major chances during the match. Havertz's miss was particularly glaring, as he failed to beat Leeds' goalkeeper Illan Meslier in a one-on-one situation created by Raheem Sterling's well-placed pass. Agbonlahor was clearly unimpressed with Havertz's performance. Speaking to TalkSPORT (via ChelseaChronicle), the former Aston Villa man explained: With Joao Felix also hitting the crossbar in the match, the Blues could have made their win much more comfortable. However, unless they start converting these big chances, their recent struggles in front of goal could continue, and their victory against Leeds may only be a temporary reprieve. The Blues notably have a massive game against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday - their only chance at silverware this season. In a hard-fought encounter at Stamford Bridge, defender Wesley Fofana's towering header proved to be the difference as Chelsea secured a crucial 1-0 victory over a resilient Leeds United side on Saturday. The Blues started the match brightly, dominating possession and creating several early chances. Joao Felix, on loan from Atletico Madrid, came closest to breaking the deadlock with a fierce strike that crashed against the crossbar. However, it was not until the 53rd minute that Fofana rose the highest to nod in a corner from the impressive Ben Chilwell, much to the relief of the home crowd. It was only the second goal the Blues had scored at home in 2023 and provided a much-needed boost for under-fire coach Graham Potter. Leeds, who have struggled away from home this season, pushed hard for an equalizer in the second half, but the hosts defended resolutely to hold on for the win. The visitors had a couple of chances to level the scores, with Weston McKennie and captain Luke Ayling both firing wide of the target.

But the Gunners showed they can cope with the pressure of the title race with a remarkable comeback that kept them five points ahead of second placed City. “I’m incredibly happy. It was just mad. It was a really special win and it took until the last second to earn it,” Arteta said. Arsenal hadn’t even touched the ball when Philip Billing gave bottom of the table Bournemouth the lead after just 9.11 seconds with a clinical finish from inside the Gunners area. The quickest goal in Premier League history was scored by Shane Long after 7.69 seconds for Southampton against Watford in 2019. Arsenal fell further behind in the 57 th minute as Marcos Senesi escaped Thomas Partey to glance a header past Aaron Ramsdale from a corner. Partey made amends for his slack marking five minutes later when he reduced the deficit with a close-range finish from Emile Smith-Rowe’s header. Underlining their desire to win a first title since 2004, Arsenal seized the momentum and equalised through Ben White’s powerful finish from Nelson’s cross in the 70 th minute. Nelson completed Arsenal’s incredible revival in the seventh minute of stoppage-time when the substitute produced a superb finish from 20 yards to spark scenes of wild celebration all around the Emirates Stadium. “They never gave up. We want to stay there (at the top) for as long as possible,” Arteta said. Earlier yesterday, City rode their luck in a 2-0 win over Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium. Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva scored the goals for the champions, who were let off the hook by a series of glaring misses from the visitors. Sean Longstaff, Callum Wilson and Joelinton were all guilty of not even forcing Ederson into a save as fifth placed Newcastle suffered another blow to their hopes of a top-four finish. “It was an incredibly good result for us because it was a tricky game,” City boss Pep Guardiola said. Potter gets a break Wesley Fofana eased the pressure on Chelsea boss Graham Potter as the French defender sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds at Stamford Bridge. Fofana put Chelsea in front with his first league goal for the club seven minutes after half-time, the former Leicester centre-back rising to head home from Ben Chilwell’s corner. It was Chelsea’s first goal in 396 minutes and just their second in seven games in all competitions. The 10 th placed Blues held on for just their third win in their last 16 games in all competitions. Ending a run of three successive defeats will give Potter a little breathing space ahead of Chelsea’s bid to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie against Borussia Dortmund next week. “We’ve had to suffer. It’s been a challenging period. We were a team who had something to lose so it was great character from the players. It gives us something to build on,” Potter said. Fourth placed Tottenham’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were rocked by a 1-0 defeat at Wolves. Just days after losing 1-0 at second tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round, the north Londoners were beaten again as Adama Traore struck in the 82 nd minute, driving the rebound in off the bar after Raul Jimenez’s effort was saved. Southampton climbed off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 victory against Leicester as Carlos Alcaraz scored the 35 th minute winner at St Mary’s. Brighton kept West Ham in relegation trouble with a 4-0 victory at the Amex Stadium courtesy of goals from Alexis Mac Allister, Joel Veltman, Kaori Mitoma and Danny Welbeck.
