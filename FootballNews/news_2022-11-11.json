The video announcing the Swiss national team contains stunning clips of the country’s landscape alongside several fans wearing the team’s shirts – including a gay couple walking hand-in-hand. The video comes after months of debate on whether LGBTQ+ fans are safe to visit Qatar for the World Cup, a country in which it is illegal to be gay, and abuses against the LGBTQ+ community have been reported as recently as October. A longer version of the video includes an interview with Swiss FA spokesman Adrian Arnold, who confirmed Swiss team captain Granit Xhaka will be wearing the OneLove anti-discrimination armband throughout the tournament. ‘The same rights should apply to everyone’ Arnold said: “With the clear demand to all those involved that the same rights should apply to everyone around the world, including in Qatar, regardless of a person’s political, religious or sexual orientation, we have decided together with the players that we will wear the OneLove captain’s armband. “ Granit Xhaka will do so for the games at the World Cup as a signal that the same rights should apply to all people in the world – regardless of their political, religious or sexual orientation.” Switzerland is one of nine European nations, including England and Wales, who have stated they will be wearing the One Love armband throughout the tournament in Qatar. ❤️🇨🇭 What Switzerland and our National Team are all about 🇨🇭❤️ @fifaworldcup #squad #aufgebot #sélection #convocazione #natimiteuch #lanatiavecvous #lanaticonvoi pic.twitter.com/mIyjUcHxjz — 🇨🇭 Nati (@nati_sfv_asf) November 9, 2022 As the competition approaches, the debate around Qatar’s human rights laws grows increasingly heated. Qatari World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman recently doubled down on his comments about homosexuality being a “damage in the mind” , stating that the conservative country “will not change” for the football tournament. Salman came under fire on Tuesday (8 November) for an interview in which he said homosexuality is “haram”, or forbidden, because it is “damage in the mind”. He has since stated that his comments were taken out of context, but stresses his anti-LGBTQ+ stance.

The Ibrox legend believes the under-fire Rangers boss has been badly let down by key players this season. 3 Arthur Numan has demanded more from Rangers' key men. Gers ended a torrid European campaign as the worst team in Champions League history and currently trail Celtic by seven points in the race for the title. And last night Numan turned his guns on two men he insists have failed to deliver.

And Numan reckons if neither are fully committed to the Ibrox cause they should stand aside now. Numan said: “ Alfredo and Ryan are out of contract in the summer. They can sign a pre-contract with another at the start of January. 3 Alfredo Morelos was signled out by van Bronckhorst's fellow Dutchman. 3 Kent improved his recent form against Hearts - and scored against the Jambos earlier this season. \"Maybe they will stay at Rangers and sign new deals. “I've no idea what the situation is with any talks that may or not be going on. “However, what I do know is that whether they stay or move on, they should be looking to show more. “They should be looking to produce the goods for the football club, the supporters, the manager and for themselves. “When I was coming to the end of my contract at Rangers in 2003 and knew I wouldn't be signing another one, I didn't down tools and go through the motions. “No, I was more determined than ever to give my all for the jersey and for everyone at Rangers to have positive memories of my contribution to the club. “We went on and won the Treble that season and it was just incredible for everyone. I was so happy and so proud. “At this moment, this is a vital period for everyone and Giovanni needs every player on board and giving 100 percent. “If anyone in the squad is not willing to do that they should stand aside.” Numan backed the Ibrox board’s decision not to sack van Bronckhorst in the wake of last week’s crushing defeat at St Johnstone. He believes his former Gers teammate can still turn it around - pleading with supporters to get behind the beleaguered boss. Numan - writing in his 5Stars column - said: “When things aren't going to plan, it's important for everyone to stay calm and show cool heads and intelligent minds. “The Rangers board showed this in the wake of the disappointing 2-1 defeat at St Johnstone last Sunday . “A lot of supporters wanted Giovanni sacked there and then. “I didn't agree with that viewpoint. “He deserved to be in charge for the game against Hearts and we managed to get a 1-0 victory. “The manager and the players showed the necessary patience required to get an important three points and a clean sheet. “We now move to Saturday and the difficult away game at St Mirren .

Cillessen, 33, whom pundits say recently moved from Valencia to NEC Nijmegen to improve his chances of selection, was dropped in favour of Feyenoord’s Justin Bijlow, Ajax’s Remko Pasveer and the surprise inclusion of Heeenveen’s Andries Noppert, the Dutch Royal Football Federation announced in a statement. Cillessen, who made his debut for the Oranje in 2013 also featured in the team that finished third in the 2014 World Cup under Van Gaal, nicknamed the “Iron Tulip” because of his no-nonsense approach to management. In total Cillessen has 63 appearances for his country and was also in the training squad before last year’s European Championship — but was then dropped in favour of another veteran Maarten Stekelenburg after contracting Covid-19. Dutch media reported Cillessen “exploded with anger” after earlier hearing he was not in the selection, having told website Voetbal International in an interview in October he “hoped to be on the plane to Qatar.” Virgil van Dijk, Matthijs de Ligt, Frenkie de Jong, Steven Berghuis, Steven Bergwijn, Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo are all expected to play a crucial role for the team that failed to qualify for Russia four years ago.

Amnesty and 24 other groups including Human Rights Watch wrote to Infantino in May urging him to establish a remediation programme for “abuses” suffered by workers. The groups say that many migrant workers — predominantly from South Asia and South-East Asia and Africa — have suffered exploitation and widespread labour abuses. Workers have complained of working conditions that amount to forced labour, lost and unpaid wages, and long hours without days off. World Cup sponsors including Adidas, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have backed the initial call and the Australian national team released a video saying the decision to host football’s showcase tournament in Qatar had resulted in some workers suffering harm. Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard said in an op-ed published in international media on Friday: “Amid this growing clamour, the most crucial voice of all has remained conspicuously silent: Gianni Infantino. “Despite private and public assurances from Fifa that they are ‘considering the proposal’, Infantino, a few platitudes aside, has consistently dodged the topic. To date, he has provided no response to our joint letter.” Infantino angered rights groups by calling for the 32 nations competing in Qatar to “focus on the football” in a letter earlier this month. He also urged the teams to stop “handing out moral lessons”. While Callamard said Infantino had “presided over a notable shift in the governing body’s approach to human rights”, she called that letter “a crass attempt at shirking Fifa’s culpability for these abuses and responsibility towards these workers”. “Enshrined in (Fifa’s) own policies is a commitment to remedy human rights abuses it has contributed to,” she said in the op-ed. “Given the well documented history of labour rights abuses in Qatar, Fifa knew — or should have known — the obvious risks to workers when it awarded Qatar the tournament.” Qatar itself has rejected calls for a compensation fund for migrant workers killed or injured on World Cup projects, with a minister telling AFP this month it was a “publicity stunt”. Labour Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said Qatar was already handing out hundreds of millions of dollars for unpaid wages, and accused the Gulf state’s critics of “racism”. Amnesty said it was a “common refrain” from Fifa and the Qatari authorities that a remedy package would be complicated to design and administer. “Yes the number of people and the scope of abuses involved make this a complex undertaking: but this must not be used as an excuse for inaction or further delay,” secretary general Callamard said. “All we are calling for at this stage is a cast-iron commitment from Fifa that abused workers will be compensated and that programmes to prevent further abuses are funded,” she added. “This should include a centre where workers can learn about their rights and seek legal assistance and advice. All of this can be done at the stroke of Infantino’s pen.” Fifa’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell told the Council of Europe in October “it was important to try to see that anyone who suffered injury as consequence of working in the World Cup... is somehow redressed” and said it was “something that we’re interested in progressing”. — AFP","pubDate":"2022-11-11 12:05:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"malaymail","country":["singapore","malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"I loved him\" - Michael Parkinson holds back the tears as he remembers George Best","link":"https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/i-loved-him-michael-parkinson-25491480","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["news@belfastlive.co.uk (Gareth Fullerton)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Parkinson first met football legend George Best when the Belfast hero arrived in Manchester at the age of 16","content":"Michael Parkinson with football legend George Best (Image: Getty) Group 28 Want all the latest Sports news direct to your inbox?

The former talk show host - who retired back in 2007 - first met Best when the Belfast hero arrived in Manchester at the age of 16. It would be the start of a lifelong bond that has always held a special place in Parkinson's heart.

A visibly emotional Parkinson held back the tears as he looked back on the pair's friendship. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"George was my pal, and the greatest player I ever saw...by a mile. \"I can't talk about George without wanting to cry. \"We had a meeting last night with several friends of ours and George was part of our party and we were just reminiscing about the times we had with him.

He was 59. Dubbed the 'Fifth Beatle' because of his mop haircut and movie-star looks, Best is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers to have ever played the beautiful game. Born and raised in Cregagh estate in East Belfast, Best helped Manchester United win the First Division title in 1965 and 1967 and the European Cup in 1968. He was also named European Footballer of the Year that same year. He made 466 appearances for United, scoring a total of 178 goals. Best also won 37 caps for Northern Ireland. Parkinson tries to remember the flawed genius for his talents on the pitch, and hailed Best as the best footballer he has ever seen. \"I met George when he was 16 when he first came to Manchester and I knew him until the day he died,\" Parkinson added. \"And I can't be even-minded about George. I mean, he was the greatest soccer player I ever saw. He was also a very good friend. \"A good friend, a loyal friend, and I loved him. Simple as that.\" Michael Parkinson (Image: Getty) Parkinson has written a new book on his career entitled 'My Sporting Life: Memories, Moments and Declarations', which he has co-written with his son, Michael Jr. Michael Jr fondly recalls playing football with Best in their back garden when he was just a youngster. He said: \"George used to come down to the house when he was in trouble with the paparazzi. And dad used to try and get George into the study and say, 'come on George, you have to do this' and George would say, 'yeah, absolutely, I am just going to go outside'. \"So he would go outside, throw down a bag of balls and play football with me and my brothers. And the game was to try and get the ball off George Best. \"The next day I went to school, and this is a true story, and they asked 'what did you do at the weekend, children?'. \"I put my hand up and said, 'I played football with George Best' and the teacher said, 'please do not lie'. \"I said I did and they said that is absolutely disgraceful and I got detention. \"Next time George came down I told him he got me in trouble and he asked how. He asked for a football and he wrote 'to Sister (she was a nun), I did play football with Michael. Love, George Best'. \"I took it into school and she slightly blushed.\" READ NEXT: That's What I Call Football podcast S5 Ep 8 Man Utd supporters' club in Co Down is second biggest in the world Crusaders boss Baxter has \"no issues\" over new Premiership challenge Positive mural from Newtownabbey football club shows 'best of the community' Sign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox.

Credit: Claudia Greco / Getty After being suspended for the first two games for his new club, Ferguson has become increasingly influential in Italy and nailed down a first-team spot with new manager Thiago Motta. The ex-Hamilton Accies player scored in consecutive games for Bologna against Lecce and Monza and he's been widely praised for his performances. Now reports in Italy have revealed Juventus are weighing up a move for Ferguson in January, either on a loan deal or a permanent bid.

Michael Owen’s goal against Argentina at France '98, and Gazza’s tears at Italia 90, also ranked highly in the top 20 list. Other unforgettable moments, chosen by the 2,000 football fans polled, include Ronaldinho’s outrageous lobbing of David Seaman at the 2002 World Cup – and Bobby Moore lifting the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966. For two in five respondents (39%), a demonstration of brilliant skill is what is most needed to make a standout moment at the World Cup truly iconic. And 36% love the drama of an unexpected result, whether a last-minute upset – or the snatching of victory from the jaws of defeat. The research was commissioned by Sky ahead of November 13th, when three World Cup documentaries will be aired based on Geoff Hurst, Italia 90, and the 2002 cup-winning side, Brazil. Poppy Dixon, director of documentaries & factual for Sky, said: “Every four years, the World Cup puts the beautiful game under a global spotlight. “In those conditions, under that pressure, players have the opportunity to elevate themselves to living legend status – or to go down in infamy. “In any case, the results of our study seem to have uncovered an appetite in British football fans for all flavours of world cup drama.” The study also found more than half (52%) of fans are looking to the future, and hope to witness more iconic moments this month in Qatar. And one in six (17%) think sporting events like the World Cup feel like more of an event when hosted abroad, compared to matches happening domestically. A third (32%) also feel that sporting events like the World Cup are a great opportunity to learn about other cultures, and 43% like to see their country being represented on the world stage, and on foreign soil. Southgate’s squad were also backed most by fans, with a fifth (19%) reckoning they could finally bring the trophy home ahead of other heavyweights such as Brazil and Argentina. It also emerged 35% think the World Cup reliably delivers once-in-a-lifetime moments on the pitch – with the average football fan believing they have witnessed seven iconic moments during world cup matches. And while it can feel like the golden era of dramatic football has passed, respondents disagree. A quarter think iconic moments were more likely to be seen in the competition before the year 2000 – but 22% think football has become more exciting in the new millennium. Outside of the tournament, 24% of football fans have witnessed an iconic moment on the pitch in-person, and 25% have seen their national team play from the stands. But 42% also indulge in football documentaries to learn more about their favourite teams and the sport – with two-thirds planning to watch similar shows in the run-up to the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The three Sky documentaries – Italia 90: Four Weeks That Changed The World, Hurst: The First and Only, and Brazil 2002 – will air this Sunday, and will also be offered as a box set on streaming service NOW. Poppy Dixon, from Sky, added: “Our passion for football shouldn’t be constrained to the 90 minutes of a match, or the few weeks that the World Cup takes place. “We hope that football fans are ready to get into the mood and celebrate some of the greatest moments of tournaments past, by tuning in.” THE TOP 20 GREATEST WORLD CUP MOMENTS OF ALL TIME:","pubDate":"2022-11-11 11:02:25","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/article28464405.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_Screenshot-2022-11-09-at-162052.png","source_id":"irishmirror","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SFA release statement on Celtic concerns after VAR camera missed offside Jota goal in Motherwell clash","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/9747754/sfa-statement-celtic-var-camera-offside-jota-goal-motherwell/","keywords":["Football","Scottish Premiership","Sport","Celtic","VAR"],"creator":["Ryan Rowe"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"THE SFA say that the camera that was in line with Jota as he was flagged for offside in the match against Motherwell \"did not capture an appropriate view of the incident\".

Erik ten Hag is apparently 'crazy' about the player and could try to sign the midfielder in January. That is where Ten Hag may struggle to get what he wants as the Portuguese side are reluctant to sell Fernandez before the end of the season. If United are desperate to sign the 21-year-old in the upcoming transfer window, Ojogo have reported he has a release clause around £100million which they would need to trigger.

Rooney has decided to go with a 4-2-3-1 formation despite the possibility of Gareth Southgate opting for a back three to give England some extra solidity in defence. There were no shocks when it came to the keeper, with the ex-Everton striker selecting Jordan Pickford in between the sticks. He then picked Man Utd duo Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire in the back line, along with John Stones and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Rooney picked a midfield trio of Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips with Jude Bellginham operating in the number 10 role. He has then gone with Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka ahead of Raheem Sterling as the two wide players, with Harry Kane leading the line. Kealan Hughes 20 minutes ago Gallagher compared to England great England midfielder Conor Gallagher has been likened to the legendary Frank Lampard and hailed as a “game-changer” by Jermaine Jenas. Speaking to BBC MOTD, Jenas said: “I had a feeling that he might sneak in there you know. I had a feeling, he’s a goal threat. “He reminds me a lot of Lampard and also he [Gareth Southgate] likes to promote from within. “In that midfield area I can imagine he was deliberating between James Ward-Prowse, someone who is a bit more reliable and a great set-piece taker but then Gallagher just offers you something else. “I think he is a game-changer aswell Conor Gallagher. He’s the type of player that you bring on and he has an impact on the game. “He presses, gets himself in the box and creates chances.\" Kealan Hughes 41 minutes ago Mane going to World Cup Sadio Mane has been included in Senegal's squad for the World Cup. The Bayern Munich star picked up an injury on Tuesday but Senegal are risking his inclusion in the hope he passes fit to play.

He said: \"This is a shame, a joke. I feel ashamed. What is Martinelli's story? 33 career goals. This is a shame, a lack of respect for football. Doing this with football shows that you don't deserve the position you are in. \"Calling up Martinelli and not calling up Gabigol [Barbosa] is a lack of respect. \"The biggest shame of all the call-ups.

He told the Press Association: “I look at 2018 in Russia, the expectation level before that tournament was very, very low. “England went into that tournament not really expecting to win it, not really expecting to do brilliantly well, so because the expectation levels were low, it was an unexpected success, like in 1990 for us, and obviously 2021 as well with the Euros final. “But the expectation level here now is low because of the results this year – and it is results which bring everybody along on that bus and which make everybody special.” Kealan Hughes Today, 09:45 Ramsdale buzzing for England mate Aaron Ramsdale has discussed his World Cup dream while revealing his delight at Arsenal team-mate Ben White being called up. He said: \"The World Cup is a dream for any boy - none more so than me from Stoke on Trent \"I’ve worked my whole life to get here after watching so many tournaments and seeing players compete. It is such a privilege to be selected for this country. Now it’s time to graft even more.\" \"I found out today at about ten to 12, we got a text from Emily, our player liaison. I actually found out that Ben was in the group first and we were all buzzing for him and it kind of filtered through that me and Bukayo were in as well. “The first reaction was we were just buzzing for Ben White. He’s been really impressive, right-back is not his main position but it’s one which he’s excelling in at the moment.\" Kealan Hughes Today, 09:30 Gazza warns England must gel Paul Gascoigne hopes the England players will gel as a team at the World Cup – rather than just counting on one of them to make the difference in Qatar. Gazza told PA: “We have got some quality players there (in the squad), but we are talking now individual players. “You have got to look at a team player – I was fortunate, because in 1990 and then at Euro 96, we were a team. Today’s teams have got quite a few individual players, but it is whether you gel together, that is more important than anything else. “In 1990, I was so proud of the players that didn’t play because when we scored, they were all up celebrating, there was nobody who sulked if they were not playing – some of them went there and never got a game, but they were still behind us, which is what the players are going to need more than anything. “So I was fortunate to be amongst all them and they just let me get on and enjoy myself, and of course Bobby Robson was a brilliant manager.” Kealan Hughes Today, 09:16 Uruguay announce World Cup squad Uruguay have confirmed their 26-man squad featuring three Premier League stars ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Liverpool's record-signing Darwin Nunez is one of the star names included in a stacked attacking line-up selected by manager Oscar Tabarez. The former Benfica striker is also joined by two of Premier League stars including Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur and Manchester United youngster Facundo Pellistri. Pellistri is the surprise name selected from the Premier League, given that he has failed to make a single competitive appearance for the Red Devils. Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani have also been selected for their fourth World Cups. Kealan Hughes Today, 08:57 Grealish posts England throwback pic Jack Grealish posted an epic throwback picture as he celebrated his World Cup call-up.

Grealish firstly tweeted a video made up of childhood photos and videos of himself that showed his progression from a young boy to his present day status as a Premier League winner and Three Lions international. He captioned it with: “Dream come true. I’m just a kid from Solihull who’s going to a World Cup with England. “I remember going into school early to watch England vs Brazil in 2002, my first ever World Cup I can remember… to think 20 years later I’d be playing at one blows my mind…” Kealan Hughes Today, 08:45 Rio Ferdinand raises Maguire questions Rio Ferdinand has urged Gareth Southgate to drop Manchester United captain Harry Maguire ahead of the England’s World Cup campaign. The former United defender believes that Southgate has better options to choose from going into the tournament. Speaking to talkSPORT, Ferdinand said, “Walker would start for me at centre-half, but he’s not fit. “Will he make it? I don’t know. John Stones would be the first name on the team sheet. “And I’ll be honest I just can’t pick who else it’s going to be, it’s that difficult. Will you play Harry Maguire who hasn’t played any games? I think you need to playing week in, week out.\" Kealan Hughes Today, 08:29 Fifa impose ban on Denmark Fifa have rejected Denmark's request to train at the World Cup in shirts with the words \"human rights for all\" on them. The Danish Football Association (DBU) said in 2021 that their two training kit sponsors would make way for messages critical of Qatar. And they also pledged to minimise the number of trips to the country to avoid commercial activities promoting the World Cup hosts' events. But DBU chief executive Jakob Jensen said: \"We have today got a message from FIFA that the training shirts our players were to train in, where it would say 'human rights for all' at the stomach (of the shirt), have been rejected due to technical reasons, which is regrettable.\" Kealan Hughes Today, 08:14 Trippier discusses World Cup heartbreak Kieran Trippier still bears the mental scars from Russia four years ago. The defender was the last England player to score at the World Cup — but has struggled to let that crushing 2-1 semi-final defeat to Croatia go. And further heartbreak came last summer when the Three Lions lost the Euros final to Italy on penalties. But Newcastle star Trippier now reckons: “We’ve got the squad to go one step further in Qatar. “It’s difficult to let go, I’m not going to lie, getting beat in a semi-final when you know you were so close. There is no point to prove but we could have been 3-0 up in the first 45 minutes. “You just need to forget about it, have your rest with your families after the tournament and try and move on as quickly as possible. “That’s long gone. We’ve all achieved things since then and now we want to put that right. “We’ve made a final and now we want to go one step further.\" Kealan Hughes Today, 08:00 Rashford buzzing for World Cup Marcus Rashford is relishing “a massive month” with England after celebrating his World Cup call-up with a goal. Rashford scored United’s second in their rousing comeback win over Aston Villa hours after Gareth Southgate named him in his squad for Qatar. Speaking of the call-up, he said: “It was just this morning I found out. “If you’re performing at United, then England will be round the corner. It will be a massive month for us, I’m looking forward to that. \"My aim is to enjoy my football and at the moment I am. If I’m scoring goals and winning, then I’m happy.” Kealan Hughes Today, 07:50 Ramsdale wants England No1 spot Aaron Ramsdale is delighted to be in the England World Cup squad but he knows he faces a big challenge to dislodge No1 Jordan Pickford. He told talkSPORT: “It’s a difficult one. All three goalkeepers have a case to start that first game in the World Cup. I think that all three of us are in good form and it’s down to the coaching staff and Gareth, ultimately, to what he picks. “It would be nice to have a few warm-up games to try and show directly what we all can do, so it’s all down to the luck of the draw but I’ll wait and see. “No matter what, it’s a World Cup and it’s my first one. I’ve got time on my side and the experience of being there and helping out or playing will be amazing.” Kealan Hughes Today, 07:35 Martinelli unfazed by Brazil critics Gabriel Martinelli is unfazed by the vicious criticism of his inclusion in the Brazil squad for the World Cup. The winger has impressed for Arsenal this season but some have questioned his inclusion in the squad over more experienced players like Roberto Firmino. But Martinelli hit out at critics, telling ESPN Brazil: \"I think this is normal. Some people in Brazil don't know me and it's also normal to say that other players deserved to be there [the squad]. But I'm pretty cool about it. I think this is normal \"I know what I'm doing at my club, I know my ability and I know what I can do. And you can be sure that I will do my best for the Brazilian team, in whatever I can help the team I will help. It will be a great experience for me.\" Kealan Hughes Today, 07:20 Haaland speaks about English connection Erling Haaland says he could have played for England had dad Alfie stayed longer in the Premier League. The Manchester City star was born in Leeds and then lived in Manchester before heading back to Norway when his old man’s career was winding up. But Haaland Jr, 22, insists he has always felt Norwegian. The £51.4million strike ace said: “It’s always a pleasure for me to play for my national team and also a proud moment. I lived in England for three-and-a-half or four years and I lived in Norway for a long time so it was natural to choose them. “You never know how it would be if my father had stayed longer in England — then maybe I would be English. “But I’m Norwegian and I’m proud of it.” Kealan Hughes Today, 07:08 Gareth Bale living the dream Gareth Bale reckons Wales’ first World Cup appearance in 64 years is a \"Hollywood script\". The Dragons captain is already back in Cardiff preparing for Qatar after scoring a crucial goal in Saturday’s Los Angeles FC’s MLS Cup final triumph against Philadelphia Union on penalties. The 33-year-old said: “There have been a lot of missed opportunities where we could have qualified and never did. “To play with your mates as I do, having grown up with them in the youth system in Wales has been a fun time. No matter how life was at our clubs we really enjoy playing together. “It’s a Hollywood script that you wouldn’t believe.

So I don't know too much about older generations.\" Anthony Chapman 10th Nov 2022, 22:04 Workers warned over Qatar bunking A warning is being issued for football fans - if you call in sick to watch World Cup games you could be sacked. A recent survey found that one in three of the 2,000 Brits polled said they planned to \"pull a sickie\" so they could support England from afar for the first game against Iran. But lawyers have today urged workers not to dream up an illness to stay home for the game as they could face getting sacked. Employment law experts at Richard Nelson LLP have said rather than fibbing about being sick, people should approach their bosses to work out a deal instead. Anthony Chapman 10th Nov 2022, 21:20 Brazil blasted over Martinelli selection Brazil legend Neto has criticised national team boss Tite for taking Gabriel Martinelli to the World Cup. He roared: \"This is a shame, a joke! I feel ashamed! Not because of Dani Alves' story. What is Martinelli's story? 33 career goals. \"This is a shame, a lack of respect for football. \"Doing this with football shows that you don't deserve the position you are in. \"Calling up Martinelli and not calling up Gabigol is a lack of respect.
