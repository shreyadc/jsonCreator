Of the internet cries of ‘fix’ Warren says: ‘What nonsense. Where was the fix when Tyson came within a second or two of being counted out when he was knocked down in the third round? Where was the fix when he had to knuckle down and fight hard to pull out the win he deserved? ‘All this idiocy has come from mostly the same people who were saying before the fight that it was a farce, a sham, a circus for the world heavyweight champion to be taking a crossover fight with Ngannou which he would win so easily it would be over whenever he wanted. ‘We knew that Ngannou would be a tough opponent with massive punching power and the physical strength to take big shots himself. Fran Warren slammed those calling Tyson Fury's tight win over Francis Ngannou a robbery Tyson Fury won his showdown with Francis Ngannou by split decision in Riyadh last week Ngannou managed to knock Fury down after a run of blistering rounds - but the Gypsy King recovered nicely Spotify Privacy Policy We did expect that Tyson would work him out in the first two or three rounds and go on to win but the knock-down changed the fight. So now the people who rubbished it in advance as a joke are saying it was a disgrace and bad for boxing that he was taken to a close decision. ‘As for the so-called robbery, anyone with the slightest idea about how to score a fight knows that Fury won despite a poor performance by his high standards. And more and more people who have watched a TV replay are coming round to that opinion.’ Warren has insisted that Fury takes a time out to recover from a bruising battle and re-schedule Usyk. He says: ‘Had Tyson pulled out an early finish we could have gone for just before Christmas but he can’t go straight back into training camp after this one.’ The revised date for Fury-Usyk is March 10, which is still within the calendar for the Riyadh Season months-long festival of culture, sports and concerts. Of suggestions that Usyk would pull the plug in frustration, Warren says: ‘If he did that when there is so much money involved they would be taking him to the nut-house. But Oleksandr is no fool.’ Of rumours that the Saudi paymasters will react negatively to Fury’s disappointing performance, the promoter adds: ‘Come on. Between Tyson being off a bit off and having to fall back on his grit and courage and Francis turning out to be a really good boxer despite this being his first boxing match they gave us all a great fight to watch, ‘All the people in the arena loved every minute. A lot of young people cheering like crazy. The fight added to that amazing pre-fight sound and light show. This has to be the most spectacular boxing event ever staged. It doesn’t matter to the Saudis when the Usyk fight takes place, as long as it’s in Riyadh. Not when the Crown Prince (Mohammad bin Salman) is a huge boxing fan himself. No, it will be [in the new year]. Absolutely.’ As to whether Fury, at 35, can recharge his mojo Warren says: ‘One of his biggest problems against Ngannou was that even though Tyson trained hard for this one – oh yes he did – there was no evidence to watch to enable him to prepare for Francis simply because this was his boxing debut.’ 'Who the hell knew he would turn out to be good counter-puncher? Usyk will be an entirely different fight. He is smaller and Tyson is aware of his style as well as being able to use his size.’ Warren is at odds, also, with ‘all those who blather on about boxing being used by the Saudis for so-called sports-washing their image.’ He adds: ‘They call out boxing while choosing to ignore all the other sports which are going to the Kingdom to build their finances. What about Formula 1, golf, tennis, all the other combat sports, the esports? Warren disagrees with critics who single out boxing for its embrace of Saudi Arabian money Fury and Usyk are set to put their heavyweight belts on the line in a bout in the new year ‘The surge in interest in all that is bringing more and more kids into playing sport. And then there’s the football. Many of the best players in the world are being recruited to strengthen the Saudi League. It is getting stronger which means they can encourage the development of their own young players. With that and the speed with which they construct stadiums – unbelievable that they build they the built the one for Tyson at the weekend in only 90 days – they will be ready to put on the World Cup in 2034. ‘But no-one can give boxing credit. They should go take a look at Mike Tyson’s new club in Riyadh and see all the youngsters coming in. And they can’t wait for Tyson’s next big night.’ There are a number of fights in prospect. For example, rematch clauses for both heavyweight champions are in the Fury-Usyk contracts and there is clamour for Fury to go again with Ngannou, who suddenly finds himself a hot boxing property in his own right.

No one is jetting off to a warmer destination or at home kicking up their feet. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers are hard at work trying their best to stay sharp for their upcoming post-season push while also making time for some rest. John Woods / THE CANADIAN PRESS files Bombers all-star receiver Nic Demski says experience has taught his teammates how to prepare for the West final. The No. 1 seeded Bombers (14-4) host the West Final Nov. 11 at IG Field against the winner of Saturday’s tilt in Vancouver between the B.C. Lions (12-6) and Calgary Stampeders (6-12). It’s the third year in a row the Bombers have earned themselves a bye to the CFL’s final four weekend. “I don’t want to come out and sound cocky, but I guess it seems a little routine,” said receiver Nic Demski, who was named a West all-star on Thursday. “A lot of us have been here before, so to go through this with the same group of guys, everybody has a good grasp on how we handle these things.” It’s hard to knock the Bombers as they did win the past two division title games on home turf. With that said, they weren’t at their best in either of those victories. In 2021, they played their worst game of the year and committed a whopping six turnovers. Somehow, someway, they still managed to pull it off and prevail 21-17 over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. It was nowehere near as ugly last season in a 28-20 win over the Lions, but it still wasn’t great. Running back Brady Oliveira stole the show with 20 carries for 130 rushing yards, but quarterback Zach Collaros – who went 14-of-20 passing for 178 yards, with one touchdown and one interception in the end zone – wasn’t particularly sharp. Returner Janarion Grant also had an early fumble that led to a free touchdown for the Leos. In both instances, the Bombers clinched the division with three regular season games remaining and were able to coast, to some extent, down the stretch. They secured the top spot in 2023 with two games remaining. They gave the night off to a long list of starters in last week’s 36-13 regular season finale win in Calgary. “I’m not gonna blame the weather, but it is different playing in the extremities like that. When it’s so frigid, the ball is a rock, and everything’s slick and slippery,” said receiver Drew Wolitarsky. “I think it probably has to do with rest, maybe too much rest. And I think we learned from that.” Wolitarsky said it was evident at Thursday’s closed practice that guys were going harder than they were at this time of year in both 2021 and 2022. The Bombers averaged 33 points per game this season and they don’t want to see a drop off from that in a week and a half. “We’re practising this week and really emphasizing full speed, strength and intensity. We need to come out and do that because we’re not playing a game this week. Having game reps is really good for your brain so we’ve got to replicate that the best we can,” said Wolitarsky. No one’s complaining about a bye and homefield advantage, but it doesn’t guarantee anything. Dating back to 1972, the home side in the West Final is 29-20, and the last five have all been one score games. Whether it’s B.C. or Calgary, they’ll be arriving in Winnipeg with some momentum. “The team that we’re gonna play is gonna be coming here to play their best game and this is our opportunity to get one leg up,” said defensive end Willie Jefferson. “They’re gonna have to play a physical game this week to come in here to play another physical game and that’s hard for teams, especially in this weather.” This week’s docket for the Blue and Gold also includes more trips to the treatment room, cold tub, hot tub and sauna. The team also organized a yoga session for the players on Thursday which is something they don’t schedule in an average week. “We have a good plan. Obviously, this organization has been in this position quite a few times,” said centre Chris Kolankowski. Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions. Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. “Osh (head coach Mike O’Shea) has been through it a lot, our O-line coach has been through it a lot, our strength coach and therapists have a good plan, so, really, it’s just trusting them. They give us recommendations of what we should do and our strength coach gives us a workout on the board. Earlier in the season, I kinda do my own thing the day after a game. I like to do a heavy upper-body and lower-body (workout), but at this point in the season, I’m just full on trusting the people around me taking that off my plate and it’s been great so far.” As for Saturday, most players are planning to get together to watch both semifinals (Montreal Alouettes host the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at 2 p.m. in the East Final, followed by the Lions taking on the Stamps at 5:30 p.m.). Kolankowski and the O-line will gather at Geoff Gray’s house for a day of football and good eats. The starting left guard is celebrated for his cooking skills and hosts the fellow blockers for a weekly dinner throughout the season. “This is the big day where he makes all the highlights of the year. So, this is one of our favourite days of the year. He makes the stuff that we like the most and asks what we want. All of our favourites get made by Geoff which is something we really appreciate he does,” said Kolankowski. “We’re hanging out at Geoff’s for eight t0 12 hours, just the guys getting together, and usually the quarterbacks come. It’s just a good day where we get to spend some time together before it’s the final drive to where we want to go.” taylor.allen@freepress.mb.ca X: @taylorallen31 Eighteen years old and still in high school, Taylor got his start with the Free Press on June 1, 2011.

A place in the final is at stake as the Dons face Hibernian at Hampden on Saturday and Barry Robson’s side head to the National Stadium with a spring in their step following their The Dons set the tone for an impressive victory from the first minute as they raced into a 4-0 lead and MacKenzie insists a repeat of the tempo shown at Fir Park is vital against the Hibees. He said: “We need to start on Saturday as we did at Motherwell. If you start poorly and find yourself a couple of goals down it is really difficult to come back from that so we need to start well. “Hibs are a really good side and they have improved a lot under the new manager. “We know it will be a really tough game and one both teams want to win so I’m sure it will be a good spectacle.” Big games keep coming for the Dons As satisfying as the win in Lanarkshire was there is little time for Aberdeen to rest on their laurels with another huge match looming at the National Stadium on Saturday. Dons fans will travel in their thousands to cheer on their side in their bid to reach the final and MacKenzie insists the support of the fans is crucial. He said: “The fans have been amazing this season travelling all over the place in Europe and in these games from Ross County all the way down to Glasgow. “We know they’ll push us on at the weekend as well and we’re really grateful for them. “We’ve played against a lot of top teams already and Hibs are another top team so we’ll be ready for them.” ‘We know we needed to win’ Aberdeen’s dominant display has certainly lifted the mood at Pittodrie following a tough week. MacKenzie knows it was vital his side stopped the rot following back-to-back defeats to PAOK in the Conference League and at Kilmarnock on Sunday and was pleased to do so in style at Fir Park. He said: “We knew we needed to win the game and get ourselves up there in the table going into the semi-final. “Going into that on the back of three defeats would not have been good so we will take the confidence from our win. “We’re struggling for consistency a wee bit at the moment. We were really good against PAOK, really poor at Kilmarnock but really good again against Motherwell. “If you are playing and it’s win one, lose one, win one, lose one you’ll never get to where you want to be.” Dons bounce back from Kilmarnock loss in style The three points gained at Well lifted the Dons from second bottom to sixth in the table with a game in hand. Aberdeen are within touching distance of the top four and having rallied up the table under Robson in the second half of last season MacKenzie knows the difference picking up points regularly makes in the Premiership. He said: “It’s been really tight for the last couple of years. “We took ourselves from ninth to third and qualifying for Europe on the back of a seven-game winning run last season so it’s there for any team that can put a run together. “There was a lot of criticism off the back of the weekend and we went into the game in 11th place knowing we had to perform and we managed to do that. “We really improved from the weekend where we were really poor. “For 80 minutes we were really good but we were sloppy in the last 10 minutes when we conceded the two goals. “But getting the three points was the most important thing as Motherwell is always a tough place to go so we’re delighted with that. “The pitch was really good and we knew we’d be able to pass the ball. It was a case of just doing it. “The pitch at Kilmarnock is really poor but we managed to pass the ball well at Fir Park.”","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:28","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/20906193_54005746-3ji4fk1dt-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0a3e3c021fcbc1e0b82ef6fce1449164","title":"Malky Mackay insists Ross County players will run hard to match fans’ commitment","link":"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/ross-county/6245629/mackay-insists-county-players-will-run-hard-to-match-fans-commitment/","keywords":["Ross County","Dingwall","Malky MacKay","Premiership","Ross County FC","SPFL"],"creator":["Andy Skinner"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Staggies have clocked up over 1,000 miles across three away matches during the past week.","content":"Malky Mackay insists Ross County’s players have been left in no doubt about who they are representing when they pull on the Staggies shirt. The Staggies return to home action against Celtic on Saturday, following a run of three away games in the space of seven days.

Mackay has been overwhelmed by the commitment of Staggies supporters who have followed his side around the country. He insists his players must reciprocate by giving them their all on the pitch. Fans prepared to put miles in Mackay said: “I’m just glad to get back to Dingwall so that our fans can see our team again. “On Tuesday night 178 hardy souls were down at Easter Road, and I’m absolutely amazed and delighted that they came. “I take my hat off to them because I have so much admiration for our fans with the distances they have to travel. Most of them probably had to get up in the morning to get to work too. “That’s what we touched on with the players – what the day looked like for our supporters on Tuesday. “They had to get time off work, plan their journey, pay to get down somehow, pay to eat and drink during the day, and find somewhere to park and get to the game. 🦌 1006 miles in 7 days We thank all supporters for their efforts in supporting the club in our triple header on the road, your support is appreciated as always. — Ross County FC (@RossCounty) “They then had to deal with the roadworks coming back up the road and going off to work the next morning. “You look at that and think that’s one of the reasons we have to run hard in matches, because you’ve got people paying good money. “They are taking time out of their lives, that’s uncomfortable for them, to come and watch us. “We have to put a performance in for them.” County pushed until latter stages at Easter Road The Staggies claimed a point from each of their away fixtures, Given the recent schedule, Mackay took heart from the way his side went on to push for a winner in the dying stages in Edinburgh. Mackay added: “I don’t think I can remember having three away games in the one week, where that travelling can be so much. I don’t think it even happened in England. “The way it has fallen has meant we have had a lot of mileage, and with that comes a lot of logistics. “To come off the back of that week and have the energy we did in the three games – especially by the last 10 minutes of game three of the week away from home, on a big pitch at Easter Road – was pleasing.” County are expecting a capacity crowd for the visit of champions Celtic this weekend The club has issued the following important safety message ahead of Saturday's match against Celtic.

Ten Hag is facing questions about his own future following eight defeats in 15 games – the club's worst start to a season since 1962. But to make matters worse the Dutchman is also having to deal with in-fighting within his broken squad. It's understood some cliques have developed in the wake of the off-field scenarios involving Mason Greenwood, and Antony. Some stars want Sancho to be recalled to first team training, while others would like to see Antony dropped from the squad. In the meantime, Ten Hag will be given more games to show he can stop the rot - despite Wednesday's shambolic home defeat to Newcastle. United have now lost five of 10 home games this season for the first time since 1931. Ten Hag insists he is still the right man to stop the downward spiral at Old Trafford. The manager is in constant dialogue with CEO Richard Arnold about the growing crisis and what can be done to save a disastrous campaign. because of the success he engineered last season, when United finished third and won the Carabao Cup. And Ten Hag is expected to get more time to survive due to the ongoing saga of the club's ownership. The Glazers are still negotiating with Sir Jim Ratcliffe about him purchasing a 25% stake in the club. And while talks continue, no-one involved in the running of United wants the distraction of having to change managers. Ten Hag spoke to his squad on Thursday and told them Friday would not be a day off ahead of Saturday's must-win clash at Fulham. The eight-place Red Devils go to Craven Cottage in the Premier League's lunch-time kick-off, where a win would at least temporarily bump them back up into sixth spot.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31345091.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_JS315745029.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e461f5b398735b52c9e8bad60dae25b5","title":"Ligue 1 : Lille «veut se montrer confiant» sur sa sécurité avant le déplacement à Marseille","link":"https://www.lefigaro.fr/sports/football/ligue-1/ligue-1-lille-veut-se-montrer-confiant-sur-sa-securite-avant-le-deplacement-a-marseille-20231102","keywords":["Ligue 1"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Des mesures de sécurité exceptionnelles ont été mises en place pour le transport de l’équipe de Lille à Marseille samedi (21h).","content":"Le Losc « veut se montrer confiant » au sujet des mesures prises pour assurer la sécurité de son équipe et de ses supporters à Marseille samedi, après les incidents d'OM-OL dimanche dernier , a indiqué le club nordiste dans un communiqué jeudi. « Le LOSC a été informé par la préfecture des Bouches-du-Rhône de l'ensemble des mesures d'encadrement et dispositifs de sécurité renforcés, déployés afin de garantir le bon acheminement et la sécurité de la délégation officielle lilloise ainsi que de ses supporters se déplaçant au stade Vélodrome », explique la formation 4e de Ligue 1. « Le LOSC prend acte de ces décisions et veut se montrer confiant quant au dimensionnement et à l'efficacité des mesures exceptionnelles nécessairement prises par les autorités », ajoute-t-il.

Sakho, 33, has left Montpellier after arriving in 2021 from . The France international was previously suspended by the club on October 24, after he grabbed 60-year-old manager Michel Der Zakarian by the collar and knocked him to the ground, according to . The confrontation was said to have begun after Sakho was not awarded a free kick during training by the manager, who called him a ‘cry baby’. Sakho reacted before leaving training after staff stepped in to de-escalate the incident. Sakho was suspended by the club but has now seemingly left on his own accord, although he still maintains his innocence in the altercation, refusing to accept any of the blame. In a statement, Sakho said: “You have to know how to leave the table when respect is no longer served,' the statement began. “Following the incident that took place last week at the training centre and for which I decline all responsibility, I have decided, on this day of 11/2/2023, to ending my collaboration with Montpellier Herault Sports Club. “I spent two years in this family club where I took pleasure to share my high-level experience with my team-mates and my 'little brothers' from the centre of training. At the same time, I think them for their support flawless as well as the medical stuff without forgetting the supporters who appreciated my time at the club. “Thanks also to the sports director Bruno Carotti for his loyalty to me throughout my adventure [at] Montpellier. “Finally, I wanted to give a special thanks to the president, Laurent Nicollin, who, like his late father did before him, heads the MHSC with the values and principles that are dear to me. “We met as men, let's leave as men. Happy end of the season, Mamadou Sakho.” Sakho played 80 times for Liverpool between 2013 and 2017, only to be shown the door by after a fallout in pre-season. He played 75 times for Palace before returning back to France in 2021. The defender was reportedly free to leave Montpellier in the summer but no transfer destinations materialised.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:14:18","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31349107.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_Mamadou-Sakho-file-photo.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"712ac94ddbf77d4086ef59dbe76e23a5","title":"Everton Women supporters group issue statement after Mary Earps incident","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/11/02/everton-women-supporters-group-issue-statement-after-mary-earps-incident/","keywords":["Everton Women","everton","Manchester United","Mary Earps"],"creator":["Callum O'Connell"],"video_url":null,"description":"Peter McFarlane, the Secretary of the Everton Women Official Supporters Club, has called for action to be taken after Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps was abused online.

McFarlane has claimed that incidents like this will be a step backwards for the growth of the women’s game and for the connection between the fans and the supporters of these clubs. McFarlane’s statement, as shared by the [31 October], read: “Unfortunately, it seems to be a common theme these days that people tend to go to these matches not solely to support the players or watch the matches. “As supporters, it’s our job to go there and support and the only thing we can expect in return is that the players give their all for 90 minutes. Anything beyond that is not expected, certainly not included in your ticket.” Abuse happens at all levels of football, from grassroots to the very top of the men’s game, but for the women’s game especially, incidents like this could have a particularly damaging effect. Very quickly, the women’s game has gone from being community-focused, where a few loyal fans would attend home games and the occasional away game, to a global spectacle attracting fans from all around the world to attend and view these games. For the players and the loyal fans, this rise has been both a positive and a negative. More eyes and therefore more money on the game is always a positive, but incidents like this one are the negative of attracting such a widespread audience. Expectations of the players tend to overlook the fact that they are just people, and the online abuse targeted at them, especially Earps in this situation, is an unacceptable but seemingly inevitable byproduct of the expansion of the women’s game.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:10:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/05/goodison3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"744e3a5e7856fa93afd7c3793825fbcc","title":"Frank Warren slams social media trolls labelling Tyson Fury's win over Francis Ngannou a robbery - as he confirms the Gypsy King's undisputed world heavyweight title fight with Oleksandr Usyk will happen in the New Year","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-12703313/Frank-Warren-slams-social-media-trolls-labelling-Tyson-Furys-win-Francis-Ngannou-robbery-confirms-Gypsy-Kings-undisputed-world-heavyweight-title-fight-Oleksandr-Usyk-happen-New-Year.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Warren denounced speculation that Usyk would pull out unless the fight with Fury went ahead on the pre-set date of December 23, or that Saudi Arabia would withdraw their backing.","content":"Frank Warren slams social media trolls labelling Tyson Fury's win over Francis Ngannou a robbery - as he confirms the Gypsy King's undisputed world heavyweight title fight with Oleksandr Usyk will happen in the New Year Tyson Fury kept his unbeaten run as he defeated Ngannou by split decision He is set to meet Oleksandr Usyk in an undisputed heavyweight bout next year Listen to Mail Sport's new boxing podcast THE HOOK - with exclusive interviews By Jeff Powell For Mailonline Published: 16:43 GMT, 2 November 2023 | Updated: 00:37 GMT, 3 November 2023 e-mail 42 shares 96 View comments Frank Warren has rounded on the social media trolls calling Tyson Fury ’s unexpectedly close victory over UFC legend Francis Ngannou a robbery, while confirming the Gypsy King’s fight with Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed world heavyweight title will definitely happen in the new year back in Riyadh Fury’s promoter denounced speculation that Usyk would pull out unless the fight with Fury went ahead on the pre-set date of December 23, or that Saudi Arabia would withdraw their financial backing because his man had a bizarre off night not long before the sun rose over the Arabian desert on Sunday morning. Of the internet cries of ‘fix’ Warren says: ‘What nonsense. Where was the fix when Tyson came within a second or two of being counted out when he was knocked down in the third round? Where was the fix when he had to knuckle down and fight hard to pull out the win he deserved? ‘All this idiocy has come from mostly the same people who were saying before the fight that it was a farce, a sham, a circus for the world heavyweight champion to be taking a crossover fight with Ngannou which he would win so easily it would be over whenever he wanted. ‘We knew that Ngannou would be a tough opponent with massive punching power and the physical strength to take big shots himself. Fran Warren slammed those calling Tyson Fury's tight win over Francis Ngannou a robbery Tyson Fury won his showdown with Francis Ngannou by split decision in Riyadh last week Ngannou managed to knock Fury down after a run of blistering rounds - but the Gypsy King recovered nicely Spotify Privacy Policy We did expect that Tyson would work him out in the first two or three rounds and go on to win but the knock-down changed the fight. So now the people who rubbished it in advance as a joke are saying it was a disgrace and bad for boxing that he was taken to a close decision. ‘As for the so-called robbery, anyone with the slightest idea about how to score a fight knows that Fury won despite a poor performance by his high standards. And more and more people who have watched a TV replay are coming round to that opinion.’ Warren has insisted that Fury takes a time out to recover from a bruising battle and re-schedule Usyk. He says: ‘Had Tyson pulled out an early finish we could have gone for just before Christmas but he can’t go straight back into training camp after this one.’ The revised date for Fury-Usyk is March 10, which is still within the calendar for the Riyadh Season months-long festival of culture, sports and concerts. Of suggestions that Usyk would pull the plug in frustration, Warren says: ‘If he did that when there is so much money involved they would be taking him to the nut-house. But Oleksandr is no fool.’ Of rumours that the Saudi paymasters will react negatively to Fury’s disappointing performance, the promoter adds: ‘Come on. Between Tyson being off a bit off and having to fall back on his grit and courage and Francis turning out to be a really good boxer despite this being his first boxing match they gave us all a great fight to watch, ‘All the people in the arena loved every minute. A lot of young people cheering like crazy. The fight added to that amazing pre-fight sound and light show. This has to be the most spectacular boxing event ever staged. It doesn’t matter to the Saudis when the Usyk fight takes place, as long as it’s in Riyadh. Not when the Crown Prince (Mohammad bin Salman) is a huge boxing fan himself. No, it will be [in the new year]. Absolutely.’ As to whether Fury, at 35, can recharge his mojo Warren says: ‘One of his biggest problems against Ngannou was that even though Tyson trained hard for this one – oh yes he did – there was no evidence to watch to enable him to prepare for Francis simply because this was his boxing debut.’ 'Who the hell knew he would turn out to be good counter-puncher? Usyk will be an entirely different fight. He is smaller and Tyson is aware of his style as well as being able to use his size.’ Warren is at odds, also, with ‘all those who blather on about boxing being used by the Saudis for so-called sports-washing their image.’ He adds: ‘They call out boxing while choosing to ignore all the other sports which are going to the Kingdom to build their finances. What about Formula 1, golf, tennis, all the other combat sports, the esports? Warren disagrees with critics who single out boxing for its embrace of Saudi Arabian money Fury and Usyk are set to put their heavyweight belts on the line in a bout in the new year ‘The surge in interest in all that is bringing more and more kids into playing sport. And then there’s the football. Many of the best players in the world are being recruited to strengthen the Saudi League. It is getting stronger which means they can encourage the development of their own young players. With that and the speed with which they construct stadiums – unbelievable that they build they the built the one for Tyson at the weekend in only 90 days – they will be ready to put on the World Cup in 2034. ‘But no-one can give boxing credit. They should go take a look at Mike Tyson’s new club in Riyadh and see all the youngsters coming in. And they can’t wait for Tyson’s next big night.’ There are a number of fights in prospect. For example, rematch clauses for both heavyweight champions are in the Fury-Usyk contracts and there is clamour for Fury to go again with Ngannou, who suddenly finds himself a hot boxing property in his own right.

No one is jetting off to a warmer destination or at home kicking up their feet. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers are hard at work trying their best to stay sharp for their upcoming post-season push while also making time for some rest. John Woods / THE CANADIAN PRESS files Bombers all-star receiver Nic Demski says experience has taught his teammates how to prepare for the West final. The No. 1 seeded Bombers (14-4) host the West Final Nov. 11 at IG Field against the winner of Saturday’s tilt in Vancouver between the B.C. Lions (12-6) and Calgary Stampeders (6-12). It’s the third year in a row the Bombers have earned themselves a bye to the CFL’s final four weekend. “I don’t want to come out and sound cocky, but I guess it seems a little routine,” said receiver Nic Demski, who was named a West all-star on Thursday. “A lot of us have been here before, so to go through this with the same group of guys, everybody has a good grasp on how we handle these things.” It’s hard to knock the Bombers as they did win the past two division title games on home turf. With that said, they weren’t at their best in either of those victories. In 2021, they played their worst game of the year and committed a whopping six turnovers. Somehow, someway, they still managed to pull it off and prevail 21-17 over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. It was nowehere near as ugly last season in a 28-20 win over the Lions, but it still wasn’t great. Running back Brady Oliveira stole the show with 20 carries for 130 rushing yards, but quarterback Zach Collaros – who went 14-of-20 passing for 178 yards, with one touchdown and one interception in the end zone – wasn’t particularly sharp. Returner Janarion Grant also had an early fumble that led to a free touchdown for the Leos. In both instances, the Bombers clinched the division with three regular season games remaining and were able to coast, to some extent, down the stretch. They secured the top spot in 2023 with two games remaining. They gave the night off to a long list of starters in last week’s 36-13 regular season finale win in Calgary. “I’m not gonna blame the weather, but it is different playing in the extremities like that. When it’s so frigid, the ball is a rock, and everything’s slick and slippery,” said receiver Drew Wolitarsky. “I think it probably has to do with rest, maybe too much rest. And I think we learned from that.” Wolitarsky said it was evident at Thursday’s closed practice that guys were going harder than they were at this time of year in both 2021 and 2022. The Bombers averaged 33 points per game this season and they don’t want to see a drop off from that in a week and a half. “We’re practising this week and really emphasizing full speed, strength and intensity. We need to come out and do that because we’re not playing a game this week. Having game reps is really good for your brain so we’ve got to replicate that the best we can,” said Wolitarsky. No one’s complaining about a bye and homefield advantage, but it doesn’t guarantee anything. Dating back to 1972, the home side in the West Final is 29-20, and the last five have all been one score games. Whether it’s B.C. or Calgary, they’ll be arriving in Winnipeg with some momentum. “The team that we’re gonna play is gonna be coming here to play their best game and this is our opportunity to get one leg up,” said defensive end Willie Jefferson. “They’re gonna have to play a physical game this week to come in here to play another physical game and that’s hard for teams, especially in this weather.” This week’s docket for the Blue and Gold also includes more trips to the treatment room, cold tub, hot tub and sauna. The team also organized a yoga session for the players on Thursday which is something they don’t schedule in an average week. “We have a good plan. Obviously, this organization has been in this position quite a few times,” said centre Chris Kolankowski. Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions. Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. “Osh (head coach Mike O’Shea) has been through it a lot, our O-line coach has been through it a lot, our strength coach and therapists have a good plan, so, really, it’s just trusting them. They give us recommendations of what we should do and our strength coach gives us a workout on the board. Earlier in the season, I kinda do my own thing the day after a game. I like to do a heavy upper-body and lower-body (workout), but at this point in the season, I’m just full on trusting the people around me taking that off my plate and it’s been great so far.” As for Saturday, most players are planning to get together to watch both semifinals (Montreal Alouettes host the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at 2 p.m. in the East Final, followed by the Lions taking on the Stamps at 5:30 p.m.). Kolankowski and the O-line will gather at Geoff Gray’s house for a day of football and good eats. The starting left guard is celebrated for his cooking skills and hosts the fellow blockers for a weekly dinner throughout the season. “This is the big day where he makes all the highlights of the year. So, this is one of our favourite days of the year. He makes the stuff that we like the most and asks what we want. All of our favourites get made by Geoff which is something we really appreciate he does,” said Kolankowski. “We’re hanging out at Geoff’s for eight t0 12 hours, just the guys getting together, and usually the quarterbacks come. It’s just a good day where we get to spend some time together before it’s the final drive to where we want to go.” taylor.allen@freepress.mb.ca X: @taylorallen31 Eighteen years old and still in high school, Taylor got his start with the Free Press on June 1, 2011.

A place in the final is at stake as the Dons face Hibernian at Hampden on Saturday and Barry Robson’s side head to the National Stadium with a spring in their step following their The Dons set the tone for an impressive victory from the first minute as they raced into a 4-0 lead and MacKenzie insists a repeat of the tempo shown at Fir Park is vital against the Hibees. He said: “We need to start on Saturday as we did at Motherwell. If you start poorly and find yourself a couple of goals down it is really difficult to come back from that so we need to start well. “Hibs are a really good side and they have improved a lot under the new manager. “We know it will be a really tough game and one both teams want to win so I’m sure it will be a good spectacle.” Big games keep coming for the Dons As satisfying as the win in Lanarkshire was there is little time for Aberdeen to rest on their laurels with another huge match looming at the National Stadium on Saturday. Dons fans will travel in their thousands to cheer on their side in their bid to reach the final and MacKenzie insists the support of the fans is crucial. He said: “The fans have been amazing this season travelling all over the place in Europe and in these games from Ross County all the way down to Glasgow. “We know they’ll push us on at the weekend as well and we’re really grateful for them. “We’ve played against a lot of top teams already and Hibs are another top team so we’ll be ready for them.” ‘We know we needed to win’ Aberdeen’s dominant display has certainly lifted the mood at Pittodrie following a tough week. MacKenzie knows it was vital his side stopped the rot following back-to-back defeats to PAOK in the Conference League and at Kilmarnock on Sunday and was pleased to do so in style at Fir Park. He said: “We knew we needed to win the game and get ourselves up there in the table going into the semi-final. “Going into that on the back of three defeats would not have been good so we will take the confidence from our win. “We’re struggling for consistency a wee bit at the moment. We were really good against PAOK, really poor at Kilmarnock but really good again against Motherwell. “If you are playing and it’s win one, lose one, win one, lose one you’ll never get to where you want to be.” Dons bounce back from Kilmarnock loss in style The three points gained at Well lifted the Dons from second bottom to sixth in the table with a game in hand. Aberdeen are within touching distance of the top four and having rallied up the table under Robson in the second half of last season MacKenzie knows the difference picking up points regularly makes in the Premiership. He said: “It’s been really tight for the last couple of years. “We took ourselves from ninth to third and qualifying for Europe on the back of a seven-game winning run last season so it’s there for any team that can put a run together. “There was a lot of criticism off the back of the weekend and we went into the game in 11th place knowing we had to perform and we managed to do that. “We really improved from the weekend where we were really poor. “For 80 minutes we were really good but we were sloppy in the last 10 minutes when we conceded the two goals. “But getting the three points was the most important thing as Motherwell is always a tough place to go so we’re delighted with that. “The pitch was really good and we knew we’d be able to pass the ball. It was a case of just doing it. “The pitch at Kilmarnock is really poor but we managed to pass the ball well at Fir Park.”","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:28","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/20906193_54005746-3ji4fk1dt-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0a3e3c021fcbc1e0b82ef6fce1449164","title":"Malky Mackay insists Ross County players will run hard to match fans’ commitment","link":"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/ross-county/6245629/mackay-insists-county-players-will-run-hard-to-match-fans-commitment/","keywords":["Ross County","Dingwall","Malky MacKay","Premiership","Ross County FC","SPFL"],"creator":["Andy Skinner"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Staggies have clocked up over 1,000 miles across three away matches during the past week.","content":"Malky Mackay insists Ross County’s players have been left in no doubt about who they are representing when they pull on the Staggies shirt.

Most of them probably had to get up in the morning to get to work too. “That’s what we touched on with the players – what the day looked like for our supporters on Tuesday. “They had to get time off work, plan their journey, pay to get down somehow, pay to eat and drink during the day, and find somewhere to park and get to the game. 🦌 1006 miles in 7 days We thank all supporters for their efforts in supporting the club in our triple header on the road, your support is appreciated as always. — Ross County FC (@RossCounty) “They then had to deal with the roadworks coming back up the road and going off to work the next morning. “You look at that and think that’s one of the reasons we have to run hard in matches, because you’ve got people paying good money. “They are taking time out of their lives, that’s uncomfortable for them, to come and watch us. “We have to put a performance in for them.” County pushed until latter stages at Easter Road The Staggies claimed a point from each of their away fixtures, Given the recent schedule, Mackay took heart from the way his side went on to push for a winner in the dying stages in Edinburgh. Mackay added: “I don’t think I can remember having three away games in the one week, where that travelling can be so much. I don’t think it even happened in England. “The way it has fallen has meant we have had a lot of mileage, and with that comes a lot of logistics. “To come off the back of that week and have the energy we did in the three games – especially by the last 10 minutes of game three of the week away from home, on a big pitch at Easter Road – was pleasing.” County are expecting a capacity crowd for the visit of champions Celtic this weekend The club has issued the following important safety message ahead of Saturday's match against Celtic.

He added: “I don’t think we’re ever going to match what Celtic bring. “When Celtic and Rangers come up, invariably it’s a really noisy atmosphere – and invariably it has been well-behaved. “It certainly makes for a really good atmosphere in the stadium. I think for our fans, there is an extra bit of excitement in the town, and for the ones who come to the game there is a certain atmosphere bouncing around it.”","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:28","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/14177024bl_53988572-1xotmtup-e1698944029962-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"04cf363b4d2094425521e7db476ede96","title":"Man Utd's broken squad at war as Erik ten Hag battles with in-fighting and cliques","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-ten-hag-exclusive-31344979","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"EXCLUSIVE: Erik ten Hag's Manchester United are in crisis, with in-house fighting splitting up the dressing room after a ton of issues surrounding the likes of Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho","content":"is battling to bring together a divided dressing room at . Ten Hag is facing questions about his own future following eight defeats in 15 games – the club's worst start to a season since 1962. But to make matters worse the Dutchman is also having to deal with in-fighting within his broken squad. It's understood some cliques have developed in the wake of the off-field scenarios involving Mason Greenwood, and Antony. Some stars want Sancho to be recalled to first team training, while others would like to see Antony dropped from the squad. In the meantime, Ten Hag will be given more games to show he can stop the rot - despite Wednesday's shambolic home defeat to Newcastle. United have now lost five of 10 home games this season for the first time since 1931. Ten Hag insists he is still the right man to stop the downward spiral at Old Trafford. The manager is in constant dialogue with CEO Richard Arnold about the growing crisis and what can be done to save a disastrous campaign. because of the success he engineered last season, when United finished third and won the Carabao Cup. And Ten Hag is expected to get more time to survive due to the ongoing saga of the club's ownership. The Glazers are still negotiating with Sir Jim Ratcliffe about him purchasing a 25% stake in the club. And while talks continue, no-one involved in the running of United wants the distraction of having to change managers. Ten Hag spoke to his squad on Thursday and told them Friday would not be a day off ahead of Saturday's must-win clash at Fulham. The eight-place Red Devils go to Craven Cottage in the Premier League's lunch-time kick-off, where a win would at least temporarily bump them back up into sixth spot.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31345091.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_JS315745029.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e461f5b398735b52c9e8bad60dae25b5","title":"Ligue 1 : Lille «veut se montrer confiant» sur sa sécurité avant le déplacement à Marseille","link":"https://www.lefigaro.fr/sports/football/ligue-1/ligue-1-lille-veut-se-montrer-confiant-sur-sa-securite-avant-le-deplacement-a-marseille-20231102","keywords":["Ligue 1"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Des mesures de sécurité exceptionnelles ont été mises en place pour le transport de l’équipe de Lille à Marseille samedi (21h).","content":"Le Losc « veut se montrer confiant » au sujet des mesures prises pour assurer la sécurité de son équipe et de ses supporters à Marseille samedi, après les incidents d'OM-OL dimanche dernier , a indiqué le club nordiste dans un communiqué jeudi. « Le LOSC a été informé par la préfecture des Bouches-du-Rhône de l'ensemble des mesures d'encadrement et dispositifs de sécurité renforcés, déployés afin de garantir le bon acheminement et la sécurité de la délégation officielle lilloise ainsi que de ses supporters se déplaçant au stade Vélodrome », explique la formation 4e de Ligue 1. « Le LOSC prend acte de ces décisions et veut se montrer confiant quant au dimensionnement et à l'efficacité des mesures exceptionnelles nécessairement prises par les autorités », ajoute-t-il.

Sakho reacted before leaving training after staff stepped in to de-escalate the incident. Sakho was suspended by the club but has now seemingly left on his own accord, although he still maintains his innocence in the altercation, refusing to accept any of the blame. In a statement, Sakho said: “You have to know how to leave the table when respect is no longer served,' the statement began. “Following the incident that took place last week at the training centre and for which I decline all responsibility, I have decided, on this day of 11/2/2023, to ending my collaboration with Montpellier Herault Sports Club. “I spent two years in this family club where I took pleasure to share my high-level experience with my team-mates and my 'little brothers' from the centre of training. At the same time, I think them for their support flawless as well as the medical stuff without forgetting the supporters who appreciated my time at the club. “Thanks also to the sports director Bruno Carotti for his loyalty to me throughout my adventure [at] Montpellier. “Finally, I wanted to give a special thanks to the president, Laurent Nicollin, who, like his late father did before him, heads the MHSC with the values and principles that are dear to me. “We met as men, let's leave as men.

McFarlane has claimed that incidents like this will be a step backwards for the growth of the women’s game and for the connection between the fans and the supporters of these clubs. McFarlane’s statement, as shared by the [31 October], read: “Unfortunately, it seems to be a common theme these days that people tend to go to these matches not solely to support the players or watch the matches. “As supporters, it’s our job to go there and support and the only thing we can expect in return is that the players give their all for 90 minutes. Anything beyond that is not expected, certainly not included in your ticket.” Abuse happens at all levels of football, from grassroots to the very top of the men’s game, but for the women’s game especially, incidents like this could have a particularly damaging effect. Very quickly, the women’s game has gone from being community-focused, where a few loyal fans would attend home games and the occasional away game, to a global spectacle attracting fans from all around the world to attend and view these games. For the players and the loyal fans, this rise has been both a positive and a negative. More eyes and therefore more money on the game is always a positive, but incidents like this one are the negative of attracting such a widespread audience. Expectations of the players tend to overlook the fact that they are just people, and the online abuse targeted at them, especially Earps in this situation, is an unacceptable but seemingly inevitable byproduct of the expansion of the women’s game.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:10:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/05/goodison3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"744e3a5e7856fa93afd7c3793825fbcc","title":"Frank Warren slams social media trolls labelling Tyson Fury's win over Francis Ngannou a robbery - as he confirms the Gypsy King's undisputed world heavyweight title fight with Oleksandr Usyk will happen in the New Year","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-12703313/Frank-Warren-slams-social-media-trolls-labelling-Tyson-Furys-win-Francis-Ngannou-robbery-confirms-Gypsy-Kings-undisputed-world-heavyweight-title-fight-Oleksandr-Usyk-happen-New-Year.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Warren denounced speculation that Usyk would pull out unless the fight with Fury went ahead on the pre-set date of December 23, or that Saudi Arabia would withdraw their backing.","content":"Frank Warren slams social media trolls labelling Tyson Fury's win over Francis Ngannou a robbery - as he confirms the Gypsy King's undisputed world heavyweight title fight with Oleksandr Usyk will happen in the New Year Tyson Fury kept his unbeaten run as he defeated Ngannou by split decision He is set to meet Oleksandr Usyk in an undisputed heavyweight bout next year Listen to Mail Sport's new boxing podcast THE HOOK - with exclusive interviews By Jeff Powell For Mailonline Published: 16:43 GMT, 2 November 2023 | Updated: 00:37 GMT, 3 November 2023 e-mail 42 shares 96 View comments Frank Warren has rounded on the social media trolls calling Tyson Fury ’s unexpectedly close victory over UFC legend Francis Ngannou a robbery, while confirming the Gypsy King’s fight with Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed world heavyweight title will definitely happen in the new year back in Riyadh Fury’s promoter denounced speculation that Usyk would pull out unless the fight with Fury went ahead on the pre-set date of December 23, or that Saudi Arabia would withdraw their financial backing because his man had a bizarre off night not long before the sun rose over the Arabian desert on Sunday morning. Of the internet cries of ‘fix’ Warren says: ‘What nonsense. Where was the fix when Tyson came within a second or two of being counted out when he was knocked down in the third round? Where was the fix when he had to knuckle down and fight hard to pull out the win he deserved? ‘All this idiocy has come from mostly the same people who were saying before the fight that it was a farce, a sham, a circus for the world heavyweight champion to be taking a crossover fight with Ngannou which he would win so easily it would be over whenever he wanted. ‘We knew that Ngannou would be a tough opponent with massive punching power and the physical strength to take big shots himself. Fran Warren slammed those calling Tyson Fury's tight win over Francis Ngannou a robbery Tyson Fury won his showdown with Francis Ngannou by split decision in Riyadh last week Ngannou managed to knock Fury down after a run of blistering rounds - but the Gypsy King recovered nicely Spotify Privacy Policy We did expect that Tyson would work him out in the first two or three rounds and go on to win but the knock-down changed the fight. So now the people who rubbished it in advance as a joke are saying it was a disgrace and bad for boxing that he was taken to a close decision. ‘As for the so-called robbery, anyone with the slightest idea about how to score a fight knows that Fury won despite a poor performance by his high standards. And more and more people who have watched a TV replay are coming round to that opinion.’ Warren has insisted that Fury takes a time out to recover from a bruising battle and re-schedule Usyk. He says: ‘Had Tyson pulled out an early finish we could have gone for just before Christmas but he can’t go straight back into training camp after this one.’ The revised date for Fury-Usyk is March 10, which is still within the calendar for the Riyadh Season months-long festival of culture, sports and concerts. Of suggestions that Usyk would pull the plug in frustration, Warren says: ‘If he did that when there is so much money involved they would be taking him to the nut-house. But Oleksandr is no fool.’ Of rumours that the Saudi paymasters will react negatively to Fury’s disappointing performance, the promoter adds: ‘Come on. Between Tyson being off a bit off and having to fall back on his grit and courage and Francis turning out to be a really good boxer despite this being his first boxing match they gave us all a great fight to watch, ‘All the people in the arena loved every minute. A lot of young people cheering like crazy. The fight added to that amazing pre-fight sound and light show. This has to be the most spectacular boxing event ever staged. It doesn’t matter to the Saudis when the Usyk fight takes place, as long as it’s in Riyadh. Not when the Crown Prince (Mohammad bin Salman) is a huge boxing fan himself. No, it will be [in the new year]. Absolutely.’ As to whether Fury, at 35, can recharge his mojo Warren says: ‘One of his biggest problems against Ngannou was that even though Tyson trained hard for this one – oh yes he did – there was no evidence to watch to enable him to prepare for Francis simply because this was his boxing debut.’ 'Who the hell knew he would turn out to be good counter-puncher? Usyk will be an entirely different fight. He is smaller and Tyson is aware of his style as well as being able to use his size.’ Warren is at odds, also, with ‘all those who blather on about boxing being used by the Saudis for so-called sports-washing their image.’ He adds: ‘They call out boxing while choosing to ignore all the other sports which are going to the Kingdom to build their finances. What about Formula 1, golf, tennis, all the other combat sports, the esports? Warren disagrees with critics who single out boxing for its embrace of Saudi Arabian money Fury and Usyk are set to put their heavyweight belts on the line in a bout in the new year ‘The surge in interest in all that is bringing more and more kids into playing sport. And then there’s the football. Many of the best players in the world are being recruited to strengthen the Saudi League. It is getting stronger which means they can encourage the development of their own young players. With that and the speed with which they construct stadiums – unbelievable that they build they the built the one for Tyson at the weekend in only 90 days – they will be ready to put on the World Cup in 2034. ‘But no-one can give boxing credit. They should go take a look at Mike Tyson’s new club in Riyadh and see all the youngsters coming in. And they can’t wait for Tyson’s next big night.’ There are a number of fights in prospect. For example, rematch clauses for both heavyweight champions are in the Fury-Usyk contracts and there is clamour for Fury to go again with Ngannou, who suddenly finds himself a hot boxing property in his own right.

No one is jetting off to a warmer destination or at home kicking up their feet. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers are hard at work trying their best to stay sharp for their upcoming post-season push while also making time for some rest. John Woods / THE CANADIAN PRESS files Bombers all-star receiver Nic Demski says experience has taught his teammates how to prepare for the West final. The No. 1 seeded Bombers (14-4) host the West Final Nov. 11 at IG Field against the winner of Saturday’s tilt in Vancouver between the B.C. Lions (12-6) and Calgary Stampeders (6-12). It’s the third year in a row the Bombers have earned themselves a bye to the CFL’s final four weekend. “I don’t want to come out and sound cocky, but I guess it seems a little routine,” said receiver Nic Demski, who was named a West all-star on Thursday. “A lot of us have been here before, so to go through this with the same group of guys, everybody has a good grasp on how we handle these things.” It’s hard to knock the Bombers as they did win the past two division title games on home turf. With that said, they weren’t at their best in either of those victories. In 2021, they played their worst game of the year and committed a whopping six turnovers. Somehow, someway, they still managed to pull it off and prevail 21-17 over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. It was nowehere near as ugly last season in a 28-20 win over the Lions, but it still wasn’t great. Running back Brady Oliveira stole the show with 20 carries for 130 rushing yards, but quarterback Zach Collaros – who went 14-of-20 passing for 178 yards, with one touchdown and one interception in the end zone – wasn’t particularly sharp. Returner Janarion Grant also had an early fumble that led to a free touchdown for the Leos. In both instances, the Bombers clinched the division with three regular season games remaining and were able to coast, to some extent, down the stretch. They secured the top spot in 2023 with two games remaining. They gave the night off to a long list of starters in last week’s 36-13 regular season finale win in Calgary. “I’m not gonna blame the weather, but it is different playing in the extremities like that. When it’s so frigid, the ball is a rock, and everything’s slick and slippery,” said receiver Drew Wolitarsky. “I think it probably has to do with rest, maybe too much rest. And I think we learned from that.” Wolitarsky said it was evident at Thursday’s closed practice that guys were going harder than they were at this time of year in both 2021 and 2022. The Bombers averaged 33 points per game this season and they don’t want to see a drop off from that in a week and a half. “We’re practising this week and really emphasizing full speed, strength and intensity. We need to come out and do that because we’re not playing a game this week. Having game reps is really good for your brain so we’ve got to replicate that the best we can,” said Wolitarsky. No one’s complaining about a bye and homefield advantage, but it doesn’t guarantee anything. Dating back to 1972, the home side in the West Final is 29-20, and the last five have all been one score games. Whether it’s B.C. or Calgary, they’ll be arriving in Winnipeg with some momentum. “The team that we’re gonna play is gonna be coming here to play their best game and this is our opportunity to get one leg up,” said defensive end Willie Jefferson. “They’re gonna have to play a physical game this week to come in here to play another physical game and that’s hard for teams, especially in this weather.” This week’s docket for the Blue and Gold also includes more trips to the treatment room, cold tub, hot tub and sauna. The team also organized a yoga session for the players on Thursday which is something they don’t schedule in an average week. “We have a good plan. Obviously, this organization has been in this position quite a few times,” said centre Chris Kolankowski. Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions. Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. “Osh (head coach Mike O’Shea) has been through it a lot, our O-line coach has been through it a lot, our strength coach and therapists have a good plan, so, really, it’s just trusting them. They give us recommendations of what we should do and our strength coach gives us a workout on the board. Earlier in the season, I kinda do my own thing the day after a game. I like to do a heavy upper-body and lower-body (workout), but at this point in the season, I’m just full on trusting the people around me taking that off my plate and it’s been great so far.” As for Saturday, most players are planning to get together to watch both semifinals (Montreal Alouettes host the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at 2 p.m. in the East Final, followed by the Lions taking on the Stamps at 5:30 p.m.). Kolankowski and the O-line will gather at Geoff Gray’s house for a day of football and good eats. The starting left guard is celebrated for his cooking skills and hosts the fellow blockers for a weekly dinner throughout the season. “This is the big day where he makes all the highlights of the year. So, this is one of our favourite days of the year. He makes the stuff that we like the most and asks what we want. All of our favourites get made by Geoff which is something we really appreciate he does,” said Kolankowski. “We’re hanging out at Geoff’s for eight t0 12 hours, just the guys getting together, and usually the quarterbacks come. It’s just a good day where we get to spend some time together before it’s the final drive to where we want to go.” taylor.allen@freepress.mb.ca X: @taylorallen31 Eighteen years old and still in high school, Taylor got his start with the Free Press on June 1, 2011.

A place in the final is at stake as the Dons face Hibernian at Hampden on Saturday and Barry Robson’s side head to the National Stadium with a spring in their step following their The Dons set the tone for an impressive victory from the first minute as they raced into a 4-0 lead and MacKenzie insists a repeat of the tempo shown at Fir Park is vital against the Hibees. He said: “We need to start on Saturday as we did at Motherwell. If you start poorly and find yourself a couple of goals down it is really difficult to come back from that so we need to start well. “Hibs are a really good side and they have improved a lot under the new manager. “We know it will be a really tough game and one both teams want to win so I’m sure it will be a good spectacle.” Big games keep coming for the Dons As satisfying as the win in Lanarkshire was there is little time for Aberdeen to rest on their laurels with another huge match looming at the National Stadium on Saturday. Dons fans will travel in their thousands to cheer on their side in their bid to reach the final and MacKenzie insists the support of the fans is crucial. He said: “The fans have been amazing this season travelling all over the place in Europe and in these games from Ross County all the way down to Glasgow. “We know they’ll push us on at the weekend as well and we’re really grateful for them. “We’ve played against a lot of top teams already and Hibs are another top team so we’ll be ready for them.” ‘We know we needed to win’ Aberdeen’s dominant display has certainly lifted the mood at Pittodrie following a tough week. MacKenzie knows it was vital his side stopped the rot following back-to-back defeats to PAOK in the Conference League and at Kilmarnock on Sunday and was pleased to do so in style at Fir Park. He said: “We knew we needed to win the game and get ourselves up there in the table going into the semi-final. “Going into that on the back of three defeats would not have been good so we will take the confidence from our win. “We’re struggling for consistency a wee bit at the moment. We were really good against PAOK, really poor at Kilmarnock but really good again against Motherwell. “If you are playing and it’s win one, lose one, win one, lose one you’ll never get to where you want to be.” Dons bounce back from Kilmarnock loss in style The three points gained at Well lifted the Dons from second bottom to sixth in the table with a game in hand. Aberdeen are within touching distance of the top four and having rallied up the table under Robson in the second half of last season MacKenzie knows the difference picking up points regularly makes in the Premiership. He said: “It’s been really tight for the last couple of years. “We took ourselves from ninth to third and qualifying for Europe on the back of a seven-game winning run last season so it’s there for any team that can put a run together. “There was a lot of criticism off the back of the weekend and we went into the game in 11th place knowing we had to perform and we managed to do that. “We really improved from the weekend where we were really poor. “For 80 minutes we were really good but we were sloppy in the last 10 minutes when we conceded the two goals. “But getting the three points was the most important thing as Motherwell is always a tough place to go so we’re delighted with that. “The pitch was really good and we knew we’d be able to pass the ball. It was a case of just doing it. “The pitch at Kilmarnock is really poor but we managed to pass the ball well at Fir Park.”","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:28","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/20906193_54005746-3ji4fk1dt-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0a3e3c021fcbc1e0b82ef6fce1449164","title":"Malky Mackay insists Ross County players will run hard to match fans’ commitment","link":"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/ross-county/6245629/mackay-insists-county-players-will-run-hard-to-match-fans-commitment/","keywords":["Ross County","Dingwall","Malky MacKay","Premiership","Ross County FC","SPFL"],"creator":["Andy Skinner"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Staggies have clocked up over 1,000 miles across three away matches during the past week.","content":"Malky Mackay insists Ross County’s players have been left in no doubt about who they are representing when they pull on the Staggies shirt. The Staggies return to home action against Celtic on Saturday, following a run of three away games in the space of seven days. Across trips to Dundee, Motherwell and Hibernian, the Dingwall side racked up a combined total of 1006 miles during the week. Mackay has been overwhelmed by the commitment of Staggies supporters who have followed his side around the country. He insists his players must reciprocate by giving them their all on the pitch. Fans prepared to put miles in Mackay said: “I’m just glad to get back to Dingwall so that our fans can see our team again. “On Tuesday night 178 hardy souls were down at Easter Road, and I’m absolutely amazed and delighted that they came. “I take my hat off to them because I have so much admiration for our fans with the distances they have to travel. Most of them probably had to get up in the morning to get to work too. “That’s what we touched on with the players – what the day looked like for our supporters on Tuesday. “They had to get time off work, plan their journey, pay to get down somehow, pay to eat and drink during the day, and find somewhere to park and get to the game. 🦌 1006 miles in 7 days We thank all supporters for their efforts in supporting the club in our triple header on the road, your support is appreciated as always. — Ross County FC (@RossCounty) “They then had to deal with the roadworks coming back up the road and going off to work the next morning. “You look at that and think that’s one of the reasons we have to run hard in matches, because you’ve got people paying good money. “They are taking time out of their lives, that’s uncomfortable for them, to come and watch us. “We have to put a performance in for them.” County pushed until latter stages at Easter Road The Staggies claimed a point from each of their away fixtures, Given the recent schedule, Mackay took heart from the way his side went on to push for a winner in the dying stages in Edinburgh. Mackay added: “I don’t think I can remember having three away games in the one week, where that travelling can be so much. I don’t think it even happened in England. “The way it has fallen has meant we have had a lot of mileage, and with that comes a lot of logistics. “To come off the back of that week and have the energy we did in the three games – especially by the last 10 minutes of game three of the week away from home, on a big pitch at Easter Road – was pleasing.” County are expecting a capacity crowd for the visit of champions Celtic this weekend The club has issued the following important safety message ahead of Saturday's match against Celtic.

He added: “I don’t think we’re ever going to match what Celtic bring. “When Celtic and Rangers come up, invariably it’s a really noisy atmosphere – and invariably it has been well-behaved. “It certainly makes for a really good atmosphere in the stadium.

Ten Hag is facing questions about his own future following eight defeats in 15 games – the club's worst start to a season since 1962. But to make matters worse the Dutchman is also having to deal with in-fighting within his broken squad. It's understood some cliques have developed in the wake of the off-field scenarios involving Mason Greenwood, and Antony. Some stars want Sancho to be recalled to first team training, while others would like to see Antony dropped from the squad. In the meantime, Ten Hag will be given more games to show he can stop the rot - despite Wednesday's shambolic home defeat to Newcastle. United have now lost five of 10 home games this season for the first time since 1931. Ten Hag insists he is still the right man to stop the downward spiral at Old Trafford. The manager is in constant dialogue with CEO Richard Arnold about the growing crisis and what can be done to save a disastrous campaign. because of the success he engineered last season, when United finished third and won the Carabao Cup. And Ten Hag is expected to get more time to survive due to the ongoing saga of the club's ownership. The Glazers are still negotiating with Sir Jim Ratcliffe about him purchasing a 25% stake in the club. And while talks continue, no-one involved in the running of United wants the distraction of having to change managers. Ten Hag spoke to his squad on Thursday and told them Friday would not be a day off ahead of Saturday's must-win clash at Fulham. The eight-place Red Devils go to Craven Cottage in the Premier League's lunch-time kick-off, where a win would at least temporarily bump them back up into sixth spot.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:30:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31345091.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_JS315745029.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e461f5b398735b52c9e8bad60dae25b5","title":"Ligue 1 : Lille «veut se montrer confiant» sur sa sécurité avant le déplacement à Marseille","link":"https://www.lefigaro.fr/sports/football/ligue-1/ligue-1-lille-veut-se-montrer-confiant-sur-sa-securite-avant-le-deplacement-a-marseille-20231102","keywords":["Ligue 1"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Des mesures de sécurité exceptionnelles ont été mises en place pour le transport de l’équipe de Lille à Marseille samedi (21h).","content":"Le Losc « veut se montrer confiant » au sujet des mesures prises pour assurer la sécurité de son équipe et de ses supporters à Marseille samedi, après les incidents d'OM-OL dimanche dernier , a indiqué le club nordiste dans un communiqué jeudi. « Le LOSC a été informé par la préfecture des Bouches-du-Rhône de l'ensemble des mesures d'encadrement et dispositifs de sécurité renforcés, déployés afin de garantir le bon acheminement et la sécurité de la délégation officielle lilloise ainsi que de ses supporters se déplaçant au stade Vélodrome », explique la formation 4e de Ligue 1. « Le LOSC prend acte de ces décisions et veut se montrer confiant quant au dimensionnement et à l'efficacité des mesures exceptionnelles nécessairement prises par les autorités », ajoute-t-il.

In a statement, Sakho said: “You have to know how to leave the table when respect is no longer served,' the statement began. “Following the incident that took place last week at the training centre and for which I decline all responsibility, I have decided, on this day of 11/2/2023, to ending my collaboration with Montpellier Herault Sports Club. “I spent two years in this family club where I took pleasure to share my high-level experience with my team-mates and my 'little brothers' from the centre of training. At the same time, I think them for their support flawless as well as the medical stuff without forgetting the supporters who appreciated my time at the club. “Thanks also to the sports director Bruno Carotti for his loyalty to me throughout my adventure [at] Montpellier. “Finally, I wanted to give a special thanks to the president, Laurent Nicollin, who, like his late father did before him, heads the MHSC with the values and principles that are dear to me. “We met as men, let's leave as men.

McFarlane has claimed that incidents like this will be a step backwards for the growth of the women’s game and for the connection between the fans and the supporters of these clubs. McFarlane’s statement, as shared by the [31 October], read: “Unfortunately, it seems to be a common theme these days that people tend to go to these matches not solely to support the players or watch the matches. “As supporters, it’s our job to go there and support and the only thing we can expect in return is that the players give their all for 90 minutes. Anything beyond that is not expected, certainly not included in your ticket.” Abuse happens at all levels of football, from grassroots to the very top of the men’s game, but for the women’s game especially, incidents like this could have a particularly damaging effect. Very quickly, the women’s game has gone from being community-focused, where a few loyal fans would attend home games and the occasional away game, to a global spectacle attracting fans from all around the world to attend and view these games. For the players and the loyal fans, this rise has been both a positive and a negative. More eyes and therefore more money on the game is always a positive, but incidents like this one are the negative of attracting such a widespread audience. Expectations of the players tend to overlook the fact that they are just people, and the online abuse targeted at them, especially Earps in this situation, is an unacceptable but seemingly inevitable byproduct of the expansion of the women’s game.","pubDate":"2023-11-02 22:10:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/05/goodison3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
