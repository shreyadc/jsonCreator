Chelsea rate the 19-year-old midfielder highly, but he has played just 97 minutes of first-team football since moving to the City Ground in the summer. The sacking of Steve Cooper has not influenced the situation, despite Portuguese speaker Nuno Espirito Santo coming in as his replacement. Forest are also happy to follow Chelsea’s wishes to help continue building a positive relationship between the two clubs. Santos will now carefully consider his next steps and can only move on loan to another team in England, as FIFA limit clubs to just seven overseas loanees, with Chelsea's spots already filled. Crystal Palace and a host of Championship clubs are interested in the one-time Brazil international, but the Blues are not in a rush to jump into another loan move. They will carefully consider what is best for the youngster’s development to avoid another wasted six months. Santos is likely to train under Mauricio Pochettino at Cobham in the interim period and he could stay at Chelsea until the end of the season. If Santos features for Chelsea in January, it would end his chances of moving on loan again this month as players are only allowed to play for two clubs per season.

The 28-year-old is out of contract with the Bundesliga champions in the summer of 2025 and has been attracting interest from clubs across Europe. Kimmich is yet to extend the four-year contract he penned in 2021, resulting in speculation he could depart Thomas Tuchel 's side at the end of the season as Bayern would look to receive a fee for the German. According to Spanish outlet AS , the northwest rivals are at the front of the queue for the player currently earning more than £300,000 per week. The report highlights the changed landscape in Munich from the one in which Kimmich extended his deal. In 2021, his commitment was overseen by then-CEO Oliver Kahn and director Hasan Salihamidzic.

The pair have since been dismissed in the shake-up that took place immediately after the Bavarian giant's record-extending 11th straight league title at the end of last season. Kimmich has remained a permanent fixture in the Bayern team when he has been available this season. He has started all 11 of his appearances in the league, with his only absences coming through suspension and illness. Tuchel has exclusively used the Champions League winner at the base of his midfield but Kimmich is able to play higher up as well as at right-back and even in central defence. Following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's £1.3billion investment at Old Trafford, United have set about crafting the squad that will take them forward. Mail Sport reveled that the club have decided against triggering an option to extend Raphael Varane's £340,000-a-week contract by 12 months leaving the defender free to hold talks with foreign clubs over a summer transfer.

Meanwhile, Liverpool have found £16m signing Wataru Endo to be more than apt cover for their hole in defensive midfield.

You'll make some appetizers, order pizza and wings, and give yourself a cheat day because you were so good in January. You may even crack a can or a bottle (maybe even more than one). Maybe your team is playing the game. Maybe you bet your buddy 5 bucks on the coin toss or time length of the national anthem. Maybe you don't care about football - or even sports in general - but you watch anyway because you like the commercials and the halftime show. But still, the day revolves around food, drinks and getting together with friends or family. Sounds like a holiday, doesn't it? Well, I'm here to tell you that it should be. Super bowl Sunday Should be a recognized holiday and workers should have Monday off. This idea of partying on a Sunday night - only to work Monday morning or burn a sick day for it...

Hojbjerg has fallen in the pecking order this season under Ange Postecoglou and has been used mainly as a rotation option for Pape Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma . The Danish international is believed to be open to the possibility of a move away from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in search of regular playing time during the current transfer window. According to Calciomercato , Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has pinpointed Hojbjerg ahead of Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips as his first choice to reinforce the team's midfield this month and talks with Tottenham are expected to commence in the coming days. The report adds that Spurs may be willing to part ways with the 28-year-old on loan in January but want an obligation to buy clause included in the agreement. Napoli were also interested in Hojbjerg, but it is understood that their interest has cooled due to them being compelled to purchase the midfielder in the summer. © Reuters Elsewhere in Serie A, Roma are reportedly closing in on a loan move for West Ham United defender Thilo Kehrer . The 27-year-old was a regular in the starting lineup during his first season in East London after joining from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2022 but has only featured in four Premier League games this term, with Vladimir Coufal currently holding down the right-back spot. Kehrer was included in the Germany squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but he has not played for his country since June last year and was left out of all three sets of international fixtures in the current season. Several clubs in Italy and Germany had been linked with a move for the defender in the lead-up to the transfer window, and Roma have now joined the race to secure his services, according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport . The report adds that Jose Mourinho 's side are expected to bolster their backline in the current transfer window and have also been linked with a possible move for Union Berlin 's Leonardo Bonucci . The veteran defender is understood to be keen to return to Serie A and has already made contact with Mourinho over a possible move this month. © Reuters Borussia Dortmund are understood to be leading the race among several European clubs to sign the highly-rated Port Vale teenager Liam Brazier . The 16-year-old midfielder is a product of Vale's youth system and has contributed six goals and seven assists in the current campaign at academy level. Brazier's academy performances led to him being called up to the senior side, and he is already pushing for a regular spot in the first-team lineup following three impressive appearances in League One this term. The Sun report that several clubs from across Europe have taken an interest in The Valiants' prodigy, but Dortmund are believed to be at the front of the queue of potential suitors.

Chelsea rate the 19-year-old midfielder highly, but he has played just 97 minutes of first-team football since moving to the City Ground in the summer. The sacking of Steve Cooper has not influenced the situation, despite Portuguese speaker Nuno Espirito Santo coming in as his replacement. Forest are also happy to follow Chelsea’s wishes to help continue building a positive relationship between the two clubs. Santos will now carefully consider his next steps and can only move on loan to another team in England, as FIFA limit clubs to just seven overseas loanees, with Chelsea's spots already filled. Crystal Palace and a host of Championship clubs are interested in the one-time Brazil international, but the Blues are not in a rush to jump into another loan move. They will carefully consider what is best for the youngster’s development to avoid another wasted six months. Santos is likely to train under Mauricio Pochettino at Cobham in the interim period and he could stay at Chelsea until the end of the season. If Santos features for Chelsea in January, it would end his chances of moving on loan again this month as players are only allowed to play for two clubs per season.

The 28-year-old is out of contract with the Bundesliga champions in the summer of 2025 and has been attracting interest from clubs across Europe. Kimmich is yet to extend the four-year contract he penned in 2021, resulting in speculation he could depart Thomas Tuchel 's side at the end of the season as Bayern would look to receive a fee for the German. According to Spanish outlet AS , the northwest rivals are at the front of the queue for the player currently earning more than £300,000 per week. The report highlights the changed landscape in Munich from the one in which Kimmich extended his deal. In 2021, his commitment was overseen by then-CEO Oliver Kahn and director Hasan Salihamidzic. Joshua Kimmich has attracted interest from clubs across Europe as his contract draws closer to its expiration Man United have sought to address their expensive squad following the £1.3bn investment into the club by Sir Jim Ratcliffe Your browser does not support iframes. The pair have since been dismissed in the shake-up that took place immediately after the Bavarian giant's record-extending 11th straight league title at the end of last season. Kimmich has remained a permanent fixture in the Bayern team when he has been available this season. He has started all 11 of his appearances in the league, with his only absences coming through suspension and illness. Tuchel has exclusively used the Champions League winner at the base of his midfield but Kimmich is able to play higher up as well as at right-back and even in central defence. Following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's £1.3billion investment at Old Trafford, United have set about crafting the squad that will take them forward. Mail Sport reveled that the club have decided against triggering an option to extend Raphael Varane's £340,000-a-week contract by 12 months leaving the defender free to hold talks with foreign clubs over a summer transfer.

Meanwhile, Liverpool have found £16m signing Wataru Endo to be more than apt cover for their hole in defensive midfield.

Hojbjerg has fallen in the pecking order this season under Ange Postecoglou and has been used mainly as a rotation option for Pape Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma . The Danish international is believed to be open to the possibility of a move away from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in search of regular playing time during the current transfer window. According to Calciomercato , Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has pinpointed Hojbjerg ahead of Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips as his first choice to reinforce the team's midfield this month and talks with Tottenham are expected to commence in the coming days. The report adds that Spurs may be willing to part ways with the 28-year-old on loan in January but want an obligation to buy clause included in the agreement. Napoli were also interested in Hojbjerg, but it is understood that their interest has cooled due to them being compelled to purchase the midfielder in the summer. © Reuters Elsewhere in Serie A, Roma are reportedly closing in on a loan move for West Ham United defender Thilo Kehrer . The 27-year-old was a regular in the starting lineup during his first season in East London after joining from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2022 but has only featured in four Premier League games this term, with Vladimir Coufal currently holding down the right-back spot. Kehrer was included in the Germany squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but he has not played for his country since June last year and was left out of all three sets of international fixtures in the current season. Several clubs in Italy and Germany had been linked with a move for the defender in the lead-up to the transfer window, and Roma have now joined the race to secure his services, according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport . The report adds that Jose Mourinho 's side are expected to bolster their backline in the current transfer window and have also been linked with a possible move for Union Berlin 's Leonardo Bonucci . The veteran defender is understood to be keen to return to Serie A and has already made contact with Mourinho over a possible move this month. © Reuters Borussia Dortmund are understood to be leading the race among several European clubs to sign the highly-rated Port Vale teenager Liam Brazier . The 16-year-old midfielder is a product of Vale's youth system and has contributed six goals and seven assists in the current campaign at academy level. Brazier's academy performances led to him being called up to the senior side, and he is already pushing for a regular spot in the first-team lineup following three impressive appearances in League One this term.

Chelsea rate the 19-year-old midfielder highly, but he has played just 97 minutes of first-team football since moving to the City Ground in the summer. The sacking of Steve Cooper has not influenced the situation, despite Portuguese speaker Nuno Espirito Santo coming in as his replacement. Forest are also happy to follow Chelsea’s wishes to help continue building a positive relationship between the two clubs. Santos will now carefully consider his next steps and can only move on loan to another team in England, as FIFA limit clubs to just seven overseas loanees, with Chelsea's spots already filled. Crystal Palace and a host of Championship clubs are interested in the one-time Brazil international, but the Blues are not in a rush to jump into another loan move. They will carefully consider what is best for the youngster’s development to avoid another wasted six months. Santos is likely to train under Mauricio Pochettino at Cobham in the interim period and he could stay at Chelsea until the end of the season. If Santos features for Chelsea in January, it would end his chances of moving on loan again this month as players are only allowed to play for two clubs per season.

The 28-year-old is out of contract with the Bundesliga champions in the summer of 2025 and has been attracting interest from clubs across Europe. Kimmich is yet to extend the four-year contract he penned in 2021, resulting in speculation he could depart Thomas Tuchel 's side at the end of the season as Bayern would look to receive a fee for the German. According to Spanish outlet AS , the northwest rivals are at the front of the queue for the player currently earning more than £300,000 per week. The report highlights the changed landscape in Munich from the one in which Kimmich extended his deal. In 2021, his commitment was overseen by then-CEO Oliver Kahn and director Hasan Salihamidzic. Joshua Kimmich has attracted interest from clubs across Europe as his contract draws closer to its expiration Man United have sought to address their expensive squad following the £1.3bn investment into the club by Sir Jim Ratcliffe Your browser does not support iframes. The pair have since been dismissed in the shake-up that took place immediately after the Bavarian giant's record-extending 11th straight league title at the end of last season. Kimmich has remained a permanent fixture in the Bayern team when he has been available this season. He has started all 11 of his appearances in the league, with his only absences coming through suspension and illness. Tuchel has exclusively used the Champions League winner at the base of his midfield but Kimmich is able to play higher up as well as at right-back and even in central defence. Following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's £1.3billion investment at Old Trafford, United have set about crafting the squad that will take them forward. Mail Sport reveled that the club have decided against triggering an option to extend Raphael Varane's £340,000-a-week contract by 12 months leaving the defender free to hold talks with foreign clubs over a summer transfer.

Meanwhile, Liverpool have found £16m signing Wataru Endo to be more than apt cover for their hole in defensive midfield.

Hojbjerg has fallen in the pecking order this season under Ange Postecoglou and has been used mainly as a rotation option for Pape Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma . The Danish international is believed to be open to the possibility of a move away from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in search of regular playing time during the current transfer window. According to Calciomercato , Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has pinpointed Hojbjerg ahead of Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips as his first choice to reinforce the team's midfield this month and talks with Tottenham are expected to commence in the coming days. The report adds that Spurs may be willing to part ways with the 28-year-old on loan in January but want an obligation to buy clause included in the agreement. Napoli were also interested in Hojbjerg, but it is understood that their interest has cooled due to them being compelled to purchase the midfielder in the summer. © Reuters Elsewhere in Serie A, Roma are reportedly closing in on a loan move for West Ham United defender Thilo Kehrer . The 27-year-old was a regular in the starting lineup during his first season in East London after joining from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2022 but has only featured in four Premier League games this term, with Vladimir Coufal currently holding down the right-back spot. Kehrer was included in the Germany squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but he has not played for his country since June last year and was left out of all three sets of international fixtures in the current season. Several clubs in Italy and Germany had been linked with a move for the defender in the lead-up to the transfer window, and Roma have now joined the race to secure his services, according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport . The report adds that Jose Mourinho 's side are expected to bolster their backline in the current transfer window and have also been linked with a possible move for Union Berlin 's Leonardo Bonucci . The veteran defender is understood to be keen to return to Serie A and has already made contact with Mourinho over a possible move this month. © Reuters Borussia Dortmund are understood to be leading the race among several European clubs to sign the highly-rated Port Vale teenager Liam Brazier . The 16-year-old midfielder is a product of Vale's youth system and has contributed six goals and seven assists in the current campaign at academy level. Brazier's academy performances led to him being called up to the senior side, and he is already pushing for a regular spot in the first-team lineup following three impressive appearances in League One this term.
