FC Köln has deployed the company's Cloud Media Hub and Mobile App powered by MXT-1 AI indexing technology to improve its content workflows. Newsbridge's solutions enable the three-time Bundesliga champions to ingest and auto-index the club's vast library of digital assets, efficiently create content, and quickly distribute media to partners, players, and fans via social platforms. Local system integrator Qvest ensured a smooth deployment and integration with 1. FC Köln's existing media ecosystem. \"Newsbridge fulfills our rigorous requirements for in-house video production, centralizing our archived content and enabling fast media search and distribution of player and match highlights at scale,\" says Michael Rudolph, head of media and communication, at 1. FC Köln. \"The fact that we can ingest and distribute our content to external parties, and on multiple platforms, is an absolute game changer. Being in the cloud, Newsbridge's Media Hub provides our team with high flexibility — whether they're at the stadium working from the sideline or creating content remotely.\" 1. FC Köln has adopted Newsbridge's Cloud Media Hub with the capacity for 6,000 hours of video content and three million photos. Powered by MXT-1 multimodal and generative AI, the Cloud Media Hub enables FC Köln to rapidly detect content with high editorial value. All of 1. FC Köln's media assets are fully searchable thanks to advanced facial recognition, object and logo detection, speech-to-text transcription, and optical character recognition technology. Through Newsbridge's Mobile App, players and partner agencies can directly access and share match and training photos across social media channels. An automatic asset placeholder workflow was implemented via API to automatically log match information such as home team, away team, season, location and stadium, when content is pushed to the asset placeholders. Additionally, the Newsbridge Cloud Media Hub is being integrated with Buffer, JW Player, and Stats Perform advanced analytics, synchronizing sports data and enriching 1. FC Köln's live and archived media assets. The result of these integrations is faster, more efficient media workflows. \"Newsbridge's Cloud Media Hub with its state-of-the-art indexing, semantic search engine and sports data integrations enable football clubs to find pivotal moments in their large media collections in less than two seconds,\" says Philippe Petitpont, co-founder and CEO at Newsbridge. \"As one of the early adopters of our MXT-1 AI indexing technology, FC Köln is on the bleeding edge of providing premium experiences to sponsors and fans.\" 1. FC Köln is Newsbridge's second German Bundesliga customer. Newsbridge's other sports clients include Bayer Leverkusen, the Icelandic Football Association (KSÍ), French Federation of Football (FFF), the French Basketball Federation (FFBB), and the French Rugby League (LNR).","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-02-02 16:24:37","image_url":"https://www.sportsvideo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FC_Cologne_Newsbridge_Media_Hub.png","source_id":"sportsvideo","source_url":"https://www.sportsvideo.org","source_priority":80877,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"50bed48b42581e5e2dd16f690fe6a5cc","title":"Pablo Fornals' £6.8m transfer to Real Betis FINALLY goes through after falling through on deadline day... with the Hammers still working to fix Said Benrahma's deal to join Lyon amid FIFA investigation","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-13038717/Pablo-Fornals-6-8m-Real-Betis-Said-Benrahma-Lyon-FIFA.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KIERAN GILL: FIFA had been investigating why West Ham failed to sell Said Benrahma and Fornals on deadline day after Lyon and Real Betis accused the English club of botching the paperwork.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-02-02 16:24:27","image_url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/02/11/80772305-0-image-a-38_1706873834280.jpg","source_id":"dailymailuk","source_url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html","source_priority":135,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"3c8b2ebcd75fc3b117eec3b9ea71240e","title":"Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou pulls prank on journalists with Lewis Hamilton transfer gag","link":"https://talksport.com/football/1735115/tottenham-ange-postecoglou-transfers-lewis-hamilton-ferrari/","keywords":["football","premier league","ferrari","formula 1","transfer news"],"creator":["Jake Lambourne"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-02-02 16:24:21","image_url":"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/02/56485531-093e-4766-ac6d-07efb48a86c5.jpg?strip=all&w=546","source_id":"talksport","source_url":"https://talksport.com","source_priority":4624,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"44f9f6c25c8dc2b9bc2af3fa67fee846","title":"Soccer-Manchester City earned record £176.2 million for 2023 Premier League victory","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/football/2024/02/03/soccer-manchester-city-earned-record-1762-million-for-2023-premier-league-victory","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Manchester City's third consecutive Premier League title in 2023 earned the club a record 176.2 million pounds ($223 million), a 15% hike over the previous season, the league revealed in their Annual Report released on Friday.
