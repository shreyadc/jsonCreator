He has scored 14 fifties in his last 51 Test innings. However, his quest for a century continues. Pujara is one of the senior players in the Indian team. He is playing as a regular batsman in the Test team. He played 97 Test matches and scored 6882 runs in 165 innings. This includes 18 centuries and 35 fifties. In the ongoing Test match against Bangladesh, Pujara along with youngsters Pant and Shreyas Iyer has rescued the struggling team. He was amazing by forming a partnership of 64 runs with Pant and 149 runs with Shreyas. However, he could not register a century. At the end of the first day‚Äôs play, the Indian team has scored 278 runs after losing 6 wickets in 90 overs. Shreyas Iyer will continue tomorrow‚Äôs match with 82 runs. He had last scored 193 runs against Australia in Sydney in 2019. Since then he has not registered a century in the 51 innings he has played so far. However, he has recorded 14 half-centuries in this intervening period. He has been dismissed twice in these last 51 innings of over 90+ runs. He has lost his wicket once in 80+ runs and twice in 70+ runs. Pujara is the 8th highest run-scorer in Test cricket for the Indian team. Kohli is at the 6th position with 8075 runs. Sachin (15,921 runs) is on the first position, Dravid (13,265 runs) is on the second position and Gavaskar (10,122 runs) is on the third position.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 13:35:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Messi'ah of Millions: Indian fans wait for Messi's '2011 Tendulkar moment'","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/messiah-of-millions-indian-fans-wait-for-messis-2011-tendulkar-moment/articleshow/96229534.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"When you see Messi running circles around the best in the world and then make them chase shadows -- like he did with defender Josko Gvardiol on Tuesday night in Doha -- the world appears to be magical.

In every session, the demands would be different but one thing is sure that you are going to see a lot of aggressive cricket from our side,‚Äù India stand-in skipper KL Rahul had said recently, ahead of the match.However, there was no aggressive approach seen among the visiting openers on Wednesday.While the opening duo of Rahul and Shubman Gill did manage to hit boundaries at regular intervals during the first seven overs, with Rahul even cutting through point against Shakib Al Hasan at one stage, the boundaries were hard to come by for India following that phase.Shubman Gill too scored three fours including a pull shot off Ebadot Hossain, but fell for the paddle sweep off Taijul Islam, as Gill was caught by Yasir Ali at slip after getting a top edge off his bat.KL Rahul and Virat Kohli soon followed after, with the duo being dismissed within an over‚Äôs gap between the 19th and 20th to leave India at 48-3 at one stage.Virat Kohli‚Äôs cheap dismissalVirat Kohli, whose last Test hundred had come against Bangladesh in November 2019, was dismissed cheaply this time, falling for just one run.Facing Taijul Islam in the 20th over, Kohli was trapped LBW plumb in front of middle stump. Kohli had a chat with Pujara at the other end and went for the review with three seconds remaining, but UltraEdge confirmed there was no bat involved and ball-tracking showed it was clearly hitting the stumps.Kohli was stuck on the back foot while trying to playing it to leg side, but the ball ended up spinning sharply and eventually struck Kohli on the backpad.Cheteshwar Pujara misses tonCheteshwar Pujara has been in the nervous nineties phase before, and on Wednesday, he was victim of yet another dismissal in the 90s.Pujara had got to his half-century in 125 deliveries, but failed to convert it into a century, being dismissed for 90 by Taijul Islam.Taijul came up with a flatter ball pitching on middle, and turned enough to beat the outside edge, eventually hitting the off-stump and knocking the bails off.Notably, Pujara last scored a Test century for India in January 2019, when he amassed 193 against Australia in Sydney. The wait for another Test century goes on for Pujara.Pujara-Iyer standCheteshwar Pujara and Shreyas Iyer played pivotal roles in India‚Äôs recovering on Day one of the first Test against Bangladesh. While Pujara was involved in a 64-run stand with Rishabh Pant (46), Pujara went onto forge 149-run stand with Shreyas Iyer for the fifth wicket.That partnership stabilised India‚Äôs innings, and that helped India win some momentum going into day two, and while India have lost Pujara, Shreyas Iyer remains unbeaten on 82.They may have just four wickets in hand, but India will look to get past the 300-run mark in the first session on Day 2 to make it tough for Bangladesh in their first-innings reply, while Shreyas Iyer searches for what will be just his second Test century.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The action shifts to Brabourne Stadium in the southern end of Mumbai, just a few kilometres away from the Wankhede Stadium where the BCCI is headquartered. The Women in Blue made a fine comeback in the second T20I in front of a sold-out DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai after suffering a nine-wicket thrashing in the opening game. While the Indians could collect just one wicket in the second game as well, it was their batting department that primarily helped stage the turnaround, with Smriti Mandhana (79) and Richa Ghosh (26 not out) helping the side finish level on scores after being set 188 to win. India would then score 20 runs in the Super Over, 13 of which came of Mandhana‚Äôs bat. Seamer Renuka Singh would then bowl out a tidy over to ensure the hosts were abreast with the world champions heading into the third game. Squads : India : Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet Kaur(c), Richa Ghosh(w), Deepti Sharma, Devika Vaidya, Radha Yadav, Anjali Sarvani, Meghna Singh, Renuka Thakur Singh, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Sabbhineni Meghana, Harleen Deol, Yastika Bhatia.

FP Trending December 14th, 2022 14:56:19 IST File image of former Australia and KKR spinner Brad Hogg. Sportzpics The upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League is already being awaited by fans. The mini-auction ahead of the marquee tournament, which will be held on 23 December, will see the 10 teams bidding for players like Joe Root, Kane Williamson, Cameroon Green Holder and Ajinkya Rahane. While both cricketers and franchises are gearing up for the IPL 2023 mini-auction, former Australia cricketer Brad Hogg is of a different opinion about the tournament‚Äôs role in cricket. The spinner has claimed that the cash-rich league is having an adverse effect on the sport as younger cricketers are more interested in playing T20s than the longer formats of the game. In an Instagram post, Brad Hogg said that IPL is affecting Indian cricket ‚Äúbecause the young players that are coming through the system are more focused on playing T20 IPL cricket because there is probably a little more cash in it, it‚Äôs a short form, it‚Äôs quick and you get the game done and dusted. It seems a bit like easier money.‚Äù He also said that due to the focus on T20 games, Tests and ODIs take a backseat. Watch: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Brad Hogg (@brad_hogg) Comparing the younger generation of players to greats like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, Hogg said that it was the newer players who were most affected by the shift to T20 cricket. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know how bowlers set up batters to take wickets and how batters build their innings to bat for long periods of time,‚Äù the Aussie all-rounder added. The video has garnered several responses with several people disagreeing with Brad Hogg‚Äôs comments. Many people credited the IPL with bringing forward new talent. Others said it all came down to the viewers. ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs not impacting anything in the end sports is business. If more people watch test cricket, then ipl players will make more money by playing tests and they will focus more there. So just enjoy cricket,‚Äù commented one person. ‚ÄúTournaments like Ranji, Syed Mustaq Ali are equally helping players to develop in other formats. It‚Äôs just that obviously there is more focus and money in t20 cricket‚Äù, wrote another.

FP Trending December 14th, 2022 14:40:32 IST Pakistan captain Babar Azam. AP Pakistan‚Äôs performance in Test cricket has come under the scanner since the side suffered their third consecutive Test defeat on home soil, for the first time in 63 years. They have already lost the three-match series against England with the second loss in a row In the second Test, the Babar Azam-led side fell 26 runs short of the 355-run target in the fourth innings following a batting disaster. Among several controversies, skipper Azam‚Äôs leadership ability , especially in Tests has become the talk of the town. Referring to the topic, former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi slammed the opener for not taking suggestions from senior members of the squad. Prior to Pakistan‚Äôs defeat in the second Test, Afridi revealed his thoughts about the unit‚Äôs disappointing results in recent times while featuring in a discussion on Samaa TV . According to him, Azam is relying more on advice from outsiders rather than listening to the veteran cricketers. Thus, he went on to make some blunders in the planning procedure and also in taking crucial in-match calls. Reminiscing his tenure as the Pakistan skipper, Afridi explained, ‚ÄúAs a captain, I always believed that being a good leader requires bringing all the players together. It implies that you should talk to seniors about your ideas. Problems arise when you start seeking advice from outsiders while excluding senior folks.‚Äù However, Afridi showed his trust in Azam‚Äôs batting capability. Though the right-handed batter could not live up to the expectations during the fourth-innings chase, the former cricketer refused to doubt him. Fans at the Multan Cricket Stadium went outrageous after Azam departed early scoring just 1 run at an important moment. After his dismissal, the crowd was heard chanting ‚ÄúZimBabar‚Äù in the stands. The gesture from the home supporters did not go down well with Afridi. He noted, ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt respect our players, the rest of the world won‚Äôt either.‚Äù The 45-year-old strongly criticised the fans for putting all the blame on the captain as each of the players should equally bear the responsibility for the loss. ‚ÄúBabar Azam is the backbone of the team. In the series, he has not performed too badly. He doesn‚Äôt play squash or table tennis to win a match for his team alone. If the team doesn‚Äôt perform, we can‚Äôt expect enough from any one person. He is the captain and is responsible for many things. He is our hero and will always be,‚Äù Afridi added further.

Pant accomplished this feat during the first innings of the opening Test against Bangladesh. After three quick wickets, Bangladesh were right on top with India having lost the star likes of Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Shubman Gill. However, vice-captain Cheteshwar Pujara and Rishabh Pant showed some resurgence with a 37-run partnership stand while the Men in Blue were in serious trouble. Pant‚Äôs aggression has helped India, which has lost three games in a row after a strong start. Taijul struck twice, including Kohli‚Äôs head, and Khaled dispatched the India captain. Pant, on the other hand, has already struck four boundaries and a six in his 26-ball 29* to lead the recovery after being promoted. After India opted to bat, Taijul Islam was the one who eventually broke through in the Indian batting order. Shubman Gill attempted to lap-sweep a full delivery at the start of the drinks break, but the ball simply plummeted at him, inducing a top edge. Yasir Ali came around from the first slip and grabbed it, expecting the shot. KL Rahul soon collapsed, falling prey to Khaled‚Äôs delivery on his stumps. In the next over, Virat Kohli was trapped lbw by a length ball from Taijul that spun past his outside edge. That meant India, who appeared to be in out of control at 41 for no loss, were suddenly in trouble. Pujara and Pant batted in their respective ways for the remainder of the session. Pant even skipped down the pitch to hit Taijul for a six-over wide long-on. At lunch, he was on 29 off 26, while Pujara was on 12 off 32.

Aussie Test star Marnus Labuschagne ahead of a first-ever Test clash against his birth country even though he expects the tourists could throw some ‚Äúcurve-balls‚Äù his way in the sledging department.","content":"Labuschagne has become the world‚Äòs No.1 Test batsman in the three years since his debut at Lord‚Äôs in 2019, as a concussion sub, and hits the showdown with the Proteas off the back of a man-of-the series performance against the West Indies in which he belted 502 runs. He‚Äôs never played a Test against South Africa, but has played three ODI‚Äôs against them and scored a fairytale century against then in Potchefstroom in 2020. The 28-year-old, who moved to Australia when he was 10 and could only speak Afrikaans, conceded this series was ‚Äúa little bit closer to my heart‚Äù but he wouldn‚Äôt be taking his foot off the pedal have pounded out three hundreds including a double, in four innings against the Windies. ‚ÄúMy family have adopted Australia as their home and they support me, they support the Australian cricket team,‚Äù Labuschagne said ahead of the first Test in Brisbane starting on Saturday. ‚ÄúBut I certainly think it‚Äòs it‚Äôs always exciting what this Test holds because it is a little bit closer to my heart because it‚Äôs the country where I grew up and where I spent 10 years of my life.‚ÄùLabuschagne is also playing as a father for the first time after he and his wife, Rebekah welcomed their first child in September.Their daughter Hallie travelled to Perth and was introduced to his teammates in change rooms during the first Test against the Windies.Labuschagne said being a dad had helped him ‚Äúswitch off‚Äù from his cricket obsession, but wouldn‚Äôt end it. ‚ÄúWhen my family‚Äòs with me, certainly the two differences between when they were with me in Perth to when they weren‚Äôt with me in Adelaide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got to bed a lot later in Adelaide and I was watching a lot more cricket videos at night.In Perth that wasn‚Äòt the case, I was getting to bed earlier, putting her (Hallie) to bed.‚ÄúI am who I am is because I am obsessed and I am obsessive, I love to try and get better each time and each day.‚ÄúI think that part, hopefully it never stops for me because I think that‚Äòs what makes me who I am.‚Äù His South African background is also an inescapable part of who is and that wasn‚Äôt lost on South African captain Dean Elgar. ‚ÄúHe is one of the form batters in the world and I am sure there is going to be a little bit of extra spice knowing he is ex-South African as well,‚Äô‚Äô Elgar said.The Proteas skipper also recalled Labuschagne trying to unsettle him in a county game in England by speaking Afrikaans, and suggested they could be a ploy they use during the series. But Labuschagne is ready for whatever they send his way ‚ÄúI‚Äòve got no doubt that they‚Äôre going to throw some curve-balls,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHopefully the responses can be either funny or none at all.‚Äú","pubDate":"2022-12-14 07:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Africa star‚Äôs explosive Smith ‚Äòmilking‚Äô claim","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/smith-milked-it-like-a-soccer-player-south-africa-reopen-sandpapergate-wounds/news-story/14ec0e4f539d8258b675e049e5c7b240","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Faf du Plessis has re-opened the wounds of cricket‚Äôs ugliest ever tour by accusing Steve Smith of ‚Äúmilking like a football player‚Äù in a showdown with explosive fast bowler Kagiso Rabada.","content":"In all the hypothesising about what events led to the Sandpapergate scandal, perhaps the most underplayed factor was the fury that erupted in the Australian camp two days before the Cape Town Test when Rabada was sensationally cleared at a six-hour appeal hearing of intentionally barging into Smith.On day one of the preceding second Test in Port Elizabeth, a fired-up Rabada made physical contact with Smith‚Äôs shoulder after dismissing the batsman, having already given David Warner an aggressive send-off. Rabada was charged over both incidents.‚ÄúThis episode has almost been forgotten against the backdrop of what the series still had up its sleeve, or more accurately, down its trousers,‚Äù wrote du Plessis in his recently released book.SCBBL PROMOIn his retelling of the events leading into the Sandpapergate Test, the former Proteas captain accused Smith of deliberately staging for Rabada to be cited by umpires.‚ÄúThey brushed shoulders during one of KG‚Äôs overs but Smith milked it like a football player,‚Äù wrote du Plessis.‚ÄúWe knew that KG was one demerit point away from a suspension.‚ÄùA tight-lipped Rabada only added to the anticipation over what might happen when he charges into Smith and Warner at the Gabba this weekend when he told News Corp he will refuse to discuss the heated clash with the world‚Äôs best batsman until after he‚Äôs retired.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happened has happened,‚Äô‚Äô Rabada told News Corp.‚ÄúI am not going to say anything now. After my career I might talk a bit more about it and look back at what happened. But at the moment we will move on.‚ÄúIt was definitely a Test series I will never forget and things did not end too well off the field.‚ÄùAfter originally copping a two match suspension which would have ruled him out of the remainder of the 2018 series, Rabada became one of the first players to ever have an ICC ban successfully overturned.The South Africans lawyered up for a marathon hearing where a bemused Smith was not even invited to give his version of events.Proteas quick Vernon Philander was another to accuse Smith of ‚Äúmilking‚Äù; claims the Australian captain rubbished at the time.‚ÄúThe contact was harder than it actually looked on the TV. Whether it was intentional or not that‚Äôs not for me to decide,‚Äù Smith said following the contentious hearing.‚ÄúI was going down the other end of the wicket to speak to Shaun (Marsh) who was in with me at the time.‚ÄúI think when you‚Äôve got someone out you‚Äôve already won the battle. There‚Äôs no need to go over the top. I was walking down the other end of the wicket, I certainly didn‚Äôt change my line or anything.‚Äú‚Ä¶ The ICC have set the standard, haven‚Äôt they? There was clearly contact out in the middle. I certainly won‚Äôt be telling my bowlers to go out there and after you take a wicket go and get in their space. I don‚Äôt think that is on and part of the game.‚ÄùRabada said in the wake of the incident that he would not change his emotional reactions after taking wickets.Sandpaper timeline‚ÄúNo I won‚Äôt change the way I express myself. I will just get far away from the batter.‚ÄùSmith told News Corp earlier this summer that he would not be intimidated should Rabada try and get in his face again.‚ÄúNah, I guess it‚Äôs all part of it. Chill out and go about your business and try and play,‚Äù said Smith.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty much it. Just play the game.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs (Rabada) a competitor. He‚Äôs a terrific bowler. You just have to look at his record and he‚Äôs always at you.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a good summer with both their attack and our attack going at it. It should make for some entertaining cricket.‚ÄùSmith admitted this week he has been troubled more by South Africa‚Äôs hostile bowlers than any other attack he‚Äôs faced.‚ÄúSouth Africa‚Äôs probably the one team that have bowled pretty well to me in the past, my record‚Äôs probably not quite as good against them as some of the others,‚Äù Smith said.Only one of Smith‚Äôs 29 career Test hundreds has come against South Africa.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 07:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England's Wood considered quitting test cricket during injury layoff","link":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/englands-wood-considered-quitting-test-cricket-during-injury-layoff-3143836","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-14 06:49:48","image_url":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--L49zK2CU--/c_fill,h_900,w_1600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2022-12-14t064948z_1_lynxmpeibd07w_rtroptp_3_cricket-test-pak-eng.jpg?itok=0HlboxJU","source_id":"channelnewsasia","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shaun Udal exclusive: 'I have dark days but cricket has been fantastic to me'","link":"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/shaun-udal-exclusive-dark-days-061748494.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-14 06:17:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England‚Äôs Andrew Flintoff rushed to hospital after Top Gear accident","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/international/englands-andrew-flintoff-rushed-to-hospital-after-top-gear-accident-1483dbd6-c063-41f3-9e7f-c41254143c2e","keywords":null,"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"English cricket legend Andrew Flintoff has been taken to hospital after an accident.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-14 05:39:45","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/cef16bad-ba24-5027-badd-474e5845041f&operation=CROP&offset=0x0&resize=1011x569","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄòTimes have changed,‚Äô but AFL, NRL unlikely to follow cricket‚Äôs COVID lead","link":"https://www.watoday.com.au/sport/cricket/times-have-changed-but-afl-nrl-unlikely-to-follow-cricket-s-covid-lead-20221214-p5c66r.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Roy Ward"],"video_url":null,"description":"The sight of cricketers Marcus Stoinis and Joe Burns playing after testing positive to COVID-19 on Tuesday was a shock to some, but the AFL is expecting its club doctors will keep infectious players away from teams.","content":"The vision of Melbourne Stars duo Marcus Stoinis and Joe Burns shivering by themselves as they played a Big Bash game after testing positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday night made for unusual viewing for Australians.

Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan stated if he had won the toss, he would also have opted to bat first. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôll try to get some early wickets. If you got into the history (of this ground), more wickets have fallen on the opening day (than on the final). We will try to get early wickets and put them under pressure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little difficult (to adapt from white-ball cricket), we‚Äôre playing a Test after a big gap of five months but we‚Äôve prepared well. This is an important series hopefully we can put some WTC points,‚Äù he added. For Bangladesh , top-order batter Zakir Hasan, who made a heroic 173 to force a draw against India A in a four-day match at Cox‚Äôs Bazar, is making his Test debut, making him the 101st cricketer in this format from his country. While India will be opening with Rahul and Shubman Gill, Bangladesh have dropped Mahmudul Hasan Joy to have their opening pair in Zakir and Najmul Hossain Shanto. India are playing Tests after five months, while Bangladesh are featuring in the format after nearly six months. India need to win their remaining six Tests (or even five victories with a draw) ‚Äì two in Bangladesh and four against Australia at home in February-March next year ‚Äì to be in contention for the World Test Championship final to be played at The Oval in June 2023.

FirstCricket Staff December 14th, 2022 9:20:23 IST The India-Australia T20 series is currently tied 1-1. Image: BCCI It was in a spectacular fashion that India levelled the five-match T20I series, 1-1 against Australia. Asked to chase a target of 188, India didn‚Äôt let past failures dictate terms as they held onto the nerves to first tie the match and then clinch the Super Over to secure one of the best wins in their history. Quite often India had been guilty of succumbing to pressure and losing matches from winning positions against Australia, but not on Sunday. In front of an unprecedented 47,000+ fans at the DY Patil Stadium , Harmanpreet Kaur and Co produced a performance that should surely inspire a few more to take up the sport. But as they move from Navi Mumbai to Mumbai for the third T20I of the match, they also need to move on quickly from the win. Consistency needed with bat Scoring big, batting first or second, had been an issue for India. With scores of 172 and 187 in the first two matches of the series respectively and by consistently scoring 150+ totals this year, India have shown that they can are close to decoding the winning total puzzle in the T20I format. Still, they can only be fully confident of their abilities if they can do this consistently against Australia, the T20 and ODI world champions. In fact, Australia chased down a target of 173 in the first ODI and scored 187 in the second with ease, by losing just one wicket in both matches. For India, the big scores have been a result of some inspired late-order batting by Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma coupled with openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma giving the team good starts. To score big consistently, India will need Jemimah Rodrigues to quickly find her scoring touch while Devika Vaidya who has been picked ahead of Yastike Bhatia would be looking to make an impact with the bat. All-round effort needed Australia are the gold standard in women‚Äôs cricket and for India to be like them, it will take a well-rounded team. While batters have put up the runs, the bowling has been quite underwhelming. Feilding has been horrendous. Deepti and Vedika are the only Indian bowlers to take a wicket each in two matches so far. Pacers Renuka Singh, Anjali Sarvani and Meghna Singh have all gone for runs and are yet to take a wicket. Despite Australia‚Äôs formidable batting lineup, the stats of Indian bowlers leave much to be desired. It‚Äôs possible that may include left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the squad for Meghna Singh as the Brabourne Stadium may not offer a belter of the pitch like DY Patil ground. Whatever the mix, it‚Äôs important for Indian bowlers to pull up their socks. Similarly, fielding has not been up to the mark in the first two games. India‚Äôs fielding has improved drastically in recent years but there are occasional dips in the performance and that is not something that you can afford against Australia. Squads Australia: Alyssa Healy (c), Tahlia McGrath (vc), Darcie Brown, Nicola Carey, Ashleigh Gardner, Kim Garth, Heather Graham, Grace Harris, Jess Jonassen, Alana King, Phoebe Litchfield, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland India: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana (vc), Shafali Verma, Yastika Bhatia, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Radha Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Renuka Singh Thakur, Meghna Singh, Anjali Sarvani, Devika Vaidya, S Meghana, Richa Ghosh, Harleen Deol The 3rd T20I will start at 7 PM and will be shown live on Star Sports and Disney+ Hotstar.

The Bangladesh series [‚Ä¶]","content":"Chatogram : The first match of the 2-Test series between India and Bangladesh will start at 9 am today in Chattogram. Indian cricket team is touring Bangladesh. The two teams will face each other in a 2-Test series. The first match will start today at 9 am at Jaghur Ahmed Stadium in Chattogram. The Bangladesh series is crucial for the Indian team to qualify for the World Test Championship final. India are currently 4th in the World Test Championship points table. Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka are the top 3 teams. To qualify for the final in June 2023, India will need to win the 2nd Test against Bangladesh and the next 4th Test against Australia. Only if they win all these 6 matches can they directly qualify for the final without waiting for the results of the other teams. Team India‚Äôs journey to qualify for the World Test Championship final begins today at the Jharkhand Stadium. This ground is good for batting. However, it will give way to the whirlwind in the last days. Bangladesh have yet to win a Test match against India. However, the absence of Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Shami and Ravindra Jadeja due to injury may give the Indian team some setback. Jadeja‚Äôs absence on such a pitch could put the opposition‚Äôs 3rd and 4th innings batting at a disadvantage. However, Axar Patel may try to fill Jadeja‚Äôs place. Apart from this, in the absence of Rohit Sharma, the Indian team is led by KL Rahul. Kuldeep Yadav or Saurabh Kumar could be in place if India decide to go with a 3rd spinner. Left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar recently took 15 wickets in the 2-Test series against Bangladesh ‚ÄòA‚Äô. Perhaps Jaydev Unathkat or Navdeep Saini could be in place along with Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Siraj if India decide to go with 3 fast bowlers. Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant can add strength in the batting.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 02:24:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
