The 22-year-old was handpicked by legendary Manchester City defender and current Burnley coach Vincent Kompany to join the Turf Moor side in the January transfer window. The former Orlando Pirates attacker penned a four-year deal with Burnley, hoping to increase the club's chances of promotion from the Championship to the Premier League. Foster jumped from Belgium's Westerloo for a fee to rise up to the region of €10 million (R187 million), with a base fee set at €7 million (R131 million), making him the most expensive South African player, overtaking legendary Bafana striker Benni McCarthy.

Two World Cup flops and a poor showing in between have taken their toll on what was a proud heritage for Germany. The four-time World Cup winner no longer strikes fear among opponents. The German Soccer Federation wants to change that before the country hosts Euro 2024. It’s an opportunity to restore lost pride, albeit with the potential for more embarrassment. The campaign starts this week with friendly games against Peru in Mainz on Saturday, then Belgium in Cologne three days later. The federation has given coach Hansi Flick another chance to lead the team after its first-round exit at the 2022 World Cup. It also brought in former Germany striker and coach Rudi Voller as sporting director to oversee what it hopes will be a successful shakeup. Another one. Former coach Joachim Low attempted a shakeup after Germany’s first-round exit at the 2018 World Cup, then ditched it after a 6-0 drubbing by Spain when he recalled veterans Thomas Muller and Mats Hummels for the coronavirus-delayed Euro 2020 tournament. It only got his team as far as the second round, where England ended Low’s 15-year stint in charge. Flick is banking on more success with the latest focus on youth, building his squad on a foundation of talented but untested under-21 players. Flick has called up six debutants for the games against Peru and Belgium, while leaving out established regulars like Muller, Leroy Sane, Ilkay Gundogan, Antonio Rüdiger and Marco Reus among others. “We’ve taken this path to see which players have the potential to be at the European Championship next year,” Flick said. Bayer Leverkusen’s 19-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz is the German team’s new star, particularly with Bayern Munich’s 20-year-old Jamal Musiala ruled out of the upcoming games through injury. Both were already established players for the senior team, though Wirtz missed the World Cup last November with a knee injury. Perhaps to underline Germany’s new faith in its youth setup, under-21 coach Antonio Di Salvo appeared alongside Flick and Voller at Monday’s press conference. Di Salvo is preparing his team for the Under-21 European Championship in Georgia and Romania this summer, but said he was happy to see players like AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw get their chance with Flick’s senior team. “It’s an honor for the players. It’s also an honor for all the coaches involved along the way from the club to the under-21 team,” Di Salvo said. Voller also stressed the importance of Germany’s underage sides. “I myself am a child of the under-21 team,” said Völler, whose goals helped West Germany win the World Cup in 1990. The now 62-year-old Voller said Germany’s success at the 1982 Under-21 European Championship, where his team reached the final, laid the foundation for the 1990 World Cup win. He also referred to 2009 European champions Manuel Neuer, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Höwedes, Mesut Özil and others helping Germany win the World Cup in 2014. “That’s the basis for us,” said Voller, who said all the players in Flick and Di Salvo’s teams had the chance to play for Germany at Euro 2024. “It’s fortunate we have this wonderful European Championship here next year. It’s important for every player and it shows the young players, especially those who are there, how lovely it is to have such a big tournament in your own country,” Völler said. “Every tournament is hugely important and it brings you forward. But to have a tournament in your own country is something special.”","pubDate":"2023-03-20 23:49:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"arabnews","category":["sports"],"country":["saudi arabia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Данія - Фінляндія: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч кваліфікації Євро-2024 23.03.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/03/21/925093/daniya-finlyandiya-de-dyvytysya-match-kvalifikatsiyi-yevro-2024","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 1-го туру кваліфікації чемпіонату Європи-2024 з футболу збірна Данії прийме Фінляндію.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у четвер, 23 березня.

The match in Eindhoven was halted during the closing stages after the supporter ran on to the pitch and assaulted Dmitrovic, punching him in the face before being wrestled to the ground by the Serbian goalkeeper. The 20-year-old supporter was handed a three-month prison sentence, with one month suspended by the East Brabant District Court. “In addition to the 40-year stadium ban, PSV will initiate proceedings to recover any damages the club incurs from him,” the Eredivisie side said in a statement. “He has also received a two-year area ban around the Philips Stadium from the Public Prosecutor’s Office. “At the time, due to a stadium ban for previous misconduct, he should not have been present at all.” The man was already serving a national stadium ban until 2026 imposed by the Dutch football association, but PSV said he had entered the ground with a ticket bought by a friend. Sevilla lost the game 2-0 but advanced to the next round with a 3-2 aggregate score. The record six-times winners of the competition face Manchester United in the quarterfinals next month.

Hodgson, 75, will return to Selhurst Park and replace Patrick Vieira , less than two years after the Arsenal legend was brought in to move the club forward from the former England boss' four-year tenure. The veteran manager, who insisted he would not return to management after a brief spell at Watford last season, has agreed a deal until the end of the season. Palace axed Vieira, 46, with the club three points above the relegation zone after a run of 12 games without a win in all competitions. Under-21s manager Paddy McCarthy took charge of the 4-1 defeat to Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday and is expected to be part of Hodgson's staff, alongside long-term assistant Ray Lewington. The former Liverpool and West Brom manager kept Palace in the top flight across his four years in charge on a shoestring budget and remains popular with many of the players. Hodgson's return is a huge departure from Crystal Palace's long-term progression plan, which began following his departure. Palace invested heavily in youth, pursuing a more attractive style of play which saw them finish 12th and reach the FA Cup semi-final under Vieira. But a failure to replace Conor Gallagher , last season's player of the year, over the summer and poor investment in the January window did not sit well with Vieira, whose relationship with the Palace hierarchy began to strain. A run of no wins in 2023 made things far worse, with owner Steve Parish sacking the Frenchman in a 7am phone call on Friday morning, insisting it was the best option to ensure their survival.

The Three Lions will face the reigning European champions in Naples on Thursday night in the first of their qualifiers for next summer's tournament in Germany. And they took part in one of their final training sessions before jetting off to Campania for their clash with the Azzurri - who pipped them to glory in the final of Euro 2020 . Southgate oversaw a somewhat light training session at St George's Park, in which the players were all smiles for large parts. The former England international held court several times during the session as he instructed his troops on the game plan for Thursday's match at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. In addition to their work on the pitch, the Prem stars also worked out in the gym - although the session didn't seem to be too gruelling. Three Lions chief Southgate named his squad for their qualifiers with Italy and Ukraine last week. But THREE stars have been forced to withdraw ahead of Thursday's trip to Italy. Marcus Rashford, Mason Mount and Nick Pope have all pulled out of the squad due to injury. Manchester United hitman Rashford picked up a knock in the Red Devils' FA Cup quarter-final victory over Fulham on Sunday.

Two World Cup flops and a poor showing in between have taken their toll on what was a proud heritage for Germany. The four-time World Cup winner no longer strikes fear among opponents. The German Soccer Federation wants to change that before the country hosts Euro 2024. It’s an opportunity to restore lost pride, albeit with the potential for more embarrassment. The campaign starts this week with friendly games against Peru in Mainz on Saturday, then Belgium in Cologne three days later. The federation has given coach Hansi Flick another chance to lead the team after its first-round exit at the 2022 World Cup. It also brought in former Germany striker and coach Rudi Voller as sporting director to oversee what it hopes will be a successful shakeup. Another one. Former coach Joachim Low attempted a shakeup after Germany’s first-round exit at the 2018 World Cup, then ditched it after a 6-0 drubbing by Spain when he recalled veterans Thomas Muller and Mats Hummels for the coronavirus-delayed Euro 2020 tournament. It only got his team as far as the second round, where England ended Low’s 15-year stint in charge. Flick is banking on more success with the latest focus on youth, building his squad on a foundation of talented but untested under-21 players. Flick has called up six debutants for the games against Peru and Belgium, while leaving out established regulars like Muller, Leroy Sane, Ilkay Gundogan, Antonio Rüdiger and Marco Reus among others. “We’ve taken this path to see which players have the potential to be at the European Championship next year,” Flick said. Bayer Leverkusen’s 19-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz is the German team’s new star, particularly with Bayern Munich’s 20-year-old Jamal Musiala ruled out of the upcoming games through injury. Both were already established players for the senior team, though Wirtz missed the World Cup last November with a knee injury. Perhaps to underline Germany’s new faith in its youth setup, under-21 coach Antonio Di Salvo appeared alongside Flick and Voller at Monday’s press conference. Di Salvo is preparing his team for the Under-21 European Championship in Georgia and Romania this summer, but said he was happy to see players like AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw get their chance with Flick’s senior team. “It’s an honor for the players. It’s also an honor for all the coaches involved along the way from the club to the under-21 team,” Di Salvo said. Voller also stressed the importance of Germany’s underage sides. “I myself am a child of the under-21 team,” said Völler, whose goals helped West Germany win the World Cup in 1990. The now 62-year-old Voller said Germany’s success at the 1982 Under-21 European Championship, where his team reached the final, laid the foundation for the 1990 World Cup win. He also referred to 2009 European champions Manuel Neuer, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Höwedes, Mesut Özil and others helping Germany win the World Cup in 2014. “That’s the basis for us,” said Voller, who said all the players in Flick and Di Salvo’s teams had the chance to play for Germany at Euro 2024. “It’s fortunate we have this wonderful European Championship here next year. It’s important for every player and it shows the young players, especially those who are there, how lovely it is to have such a big tournament in your own country,” Völler said. “Every tournament is hugely important and it brings you forward. But to have a tournament in your own country is something special.”","pubDate":"2023-03-20 23:49:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"arabnews","category":["sports"],"country":["saudi arabia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Данія - Фінляндія: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч кваліфікації Євро-2024 23.03.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/03/21/925093/daniya-finlyandiya-de-dyvytysya-match-kvalifikatsiyi-yevro-2024","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 1-го туру кваліфікації чемпіонату Європи-2024 з футболу збірна Данії прийме Фінляндію.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у четвер, 23 березня.

The match in Eindhoven was halted during the closing stages after the supporter ran on to the pitch and assaulted Dmitrovic, punching him in the face before being wrestled to the ground by the Serbian goalkeeper. The 20-year-old supporter was handed a three-month prison sentence, with one month suspended by the East Brabant District Court. “In addition to the 40-year stadium ban, PSV will initiate proceedings to recover any damages the club incurs from him,” the Eredivisie side said in a statement. “He has also received a two-year area ban around the Philips Stadium from the Public Prosecutor’s Office. “At the time, due to a stadium ban for previous misconduct, he should not have been present at all.” The man was already serving a national stadium ban until 2026 imposed by the Dutch football association, but PSV said he had entered the ground with a ticket bought by a friend. Sevilla lost the game 2-0 but advanced to the next round with a 3-2 aggregate score. The record six-times winners of the competition face Manchester United in the quarterfinals next month.

Hodgson, 75, will return to Selhurst Park and replace Patrick Vieira , less than two years after the Arsenal legend was brought in to move the club forward from the former England boss' four-year tenure. The veteran manager, who insisted he would not return to management after a brief spell at Watford last season, has agreed a deal until the end of the season. Palace axed Vieira, 46, with the club three points above the relegation zone after a run of 12 games without a win in all competitions. Under-21s manager Paddy McCarthy took charge of the 4-1 defeat to Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday and is expected to be part of Hodgson's staff, alongside long-term assistant Ray Lewington. The former Liverpool and West Brom manager kept Palace in the top flight across his four years in charge on a shoestring budget and remains popular with many of the players. Hodgson's return is a huge departure from Crystal Palace's long-term progression plan, which began following his departure. Palace invested heavily in youth, pursuing a more attractive style of play which saw them finish 12th and reach the FA Cup semi-final under Vieira. But a failure to replace Conor Gallagher , last season's player of the year, over the summer and poor investment in the January window did not sit well with Vieira, whose relationship with the Palace hierarchy began to strain. A run of no wins in 2023 made things far worse, with owner Steve Parish sacking the Frenchman in a 7am phone call on Friday morning, insisting it was the best option to ensure their survival.

The Three Lions will face the reigning European champions in Naples on Thursday night in the first of their qualifiers for next summer's tournament in Germany. And they took part in one of their final training sessions before jetting off to Campania for their clash with the Azzurri - who pipped them to glory in the final of Euro 2020 . Southgate oversaw a somewhat light training session at St George's Park, in which the players were all smiles for large parts. The former England international held court several times during the session as he instructed his troops on the game plan for Thursday's match at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. In addition to their work on the pitch, the Prem stars also worked out in the gym - although the session didn't seem to be too gruelling. Three Lions chief Southgate named his squad for their qualifiers with Italy and Ukraine last week. But THREE stars have been forced to withdraw ahead of Thursday's trip to Italy. Marcus Rashford, Mason Mount and Nick Pope have all pulled out of the squad due to injury. Manchester United hitman Rashford picked up a knock in the Red Devils' FA Cup quarter-final victory over Fulham on Sunday.

The former Orlando Pirates attacker penned a four-year deal with Burnley, hoping to increase the club's chances of promotion from the Championship to the Premier League.

Perhaps to underline Germany’s new faith in its youth setup, under-21 coach Antonio Di Salvo appeared alongside Flick and Voller at Monday’s press conference. Di Salvo is preparing his team for the Under-21 European Championship in Georgia and Romania this summer, but said he was happy to see players like AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw get their chance with Flick’s senior team. “It’s an honor for the players. It’s also an honor for all the coaches involved along the way from the club to the under-21 team,” Di Salvo said. Voller also stressed the importance of Germany’s underage sides. “I myself am a child of the under-21 team,” said Völler, whose goals helped West Germany win the World Cup in 1990. The now 62-year-old Voller said Germany’s success at the 1982 Under-21 European Championship, where his team reached the final, laid the foundation for the 1990 World Cup win. He also referred to 2009 European champions Manuel Neuer, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Höwedes, Mesut Özil and others helping Germany win the World Cup in 2014. “That’s the basis for us,” said Voller, who said all the players in Flick and Di Salvo’s teams had the chance to play for Germany at Euro 2024. “It’s fortunate we have this wonderful European Championship here next year. It’s important for every player and it shows the young players, especially those who are there, how lovely it is to have such a big tournament in your own country,” Völler said. “Every tournament is hugely important and it brings you forward. But to have a tournament in your own country is something special.”","pubDate":"2023-03-20 23:49:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"arabnews","category":["sports"],"country":["saudi arabia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Данія - Фінляндія: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч кваліфікації Євро-2024 23.03.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/03/21/925093/daniya-finlyandiya-de-dyvytysya-match-kvalifikatsiyi-yevro-2024","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 1-го туру кваліфікації чемпіонату Європи-2024 з футболу збірна Данії прийме Фінляндію.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у четвер, 23 березня.

The match in Eindhoven was halted during the closing stages after the supporter ran on to the pitch and assaulted Dmitrovic, punching him in the face before being wrestled to the ground by the Serbian goalkeeper. The 20-year-old supporter was handed a three-month prison sentence, with one month suspended by the East Brabant District Court. “In addition to the 40-year stadium ban, PSV will initiate proceedings to recover any damages the club incurs from him,” the Eredivisie side said in a statement. “He has also received a two-year area ban around the Philips Stadium from the Public Prosecutor’s Office. “At the time, due to a stadium ban for previous misconduct, he should not have been present at all.” The man was already serving a national stadium ban until 2026 imposed by the Dutch football association, but PSV said he had entered the ground with a ticket bought by a friend. Sevilla lost the game 2-0 but advanced to the next round with a 3-2 aggregate score. The record six-times winners of the competition face Manchester United in the quarterfinals next month.

Hodgson, 75, will return to Selhurst Park and replace Patrick Vieira , less than two years after the Arsenal legend was brought in to move the club forward from the former England boss' four-year tenure. The veteran manager, who insisted he would not return to management after a brief spell at Watford last season, has agreed a deal until the end of the season. Palace axed Vieira, 46, with the club three points above the relegation zone after a run of 12 games without a win in all competitions. Under-21s manager Paddy McCarthy took charge of the 4-1 defeat to Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday and is expected to be part of Hodgson's staff, alongside long-term assistant Ray Lewington. The former Liverpool and West Brom manager kept Palace in the top flight across his four years in charge on a shoestring budget and remains popular with many of the players. Hodgson's return is a huge departure from Crystal Palace's long-term progression plan, which began following his departure. Palace invested heavily in youth, pursuing a more attractive style of play which saw them finish 12th and reach the FA Cup semi-final under Vieira. But a failure to replace Conor Gallagher , last season's player of the year, over the summer and poor investment in the January window did not sit well with Vieira, whose relationship with the Palace hierarchy began to strain. A run of no wins in 2023 made things far worse, with owner Steve Parish sacking the Frenchman in a 7am phone call on Friday morning, insisting it was the best option to ensure their survival.

And the relegation six-pointers continue until the end of April as they come up against Everton, Wolves and West Ham.","pubDate":"2023-03-20 23:13:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Soccer-Fulham&#039;s coach Silva and striker Mitrovic charged after Man United tie","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/football/2023/03/21/soccer-fulham039s-coach-silva-and-striker-mitrovic-charged-after-man-united-tie","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic is facing a lengthy ban after the Football Association said the standard punishment for his dismissal during their 3-1 FA Cup quarter-final defeat by Manchester United would be \"clearly insufficient\".

Fulham coach Marco Silva was also charged by the FA on Monday. During the second half of Sunday's tie, a confrontation broke out after Fulham's Willian was red-carded for handling the ball in the box following a VAR review. During a chaotic few minutes, coach Silva angrily addressed the fourth official before being shown a red card. Serbian forward Mitrovic was also red-carded after confronting referee Chris Kavanagh and shoving him with his shoulder. \"It's alleged that Marco Silva used abusive and/or insulting words, and/or gestures and/or behaviours towards the fourth official prior to his dismissal and... after being sent off,\" the FA said in a statement. \"It's further alleged that in throwing a water bottle in the direction of the assistant referee his behaviour was improper.\" The FA also said that Mitrovic's behaviour after the sending off was insulting and threatening. \"The standard punishment which would otherwise apply to Aleksander Mitrovic for the sending off offence of violent conduct that he committed towards the match referee is clearly insufficient.\" The governing body added that Fulham failed to ensure that their players would behave themselves and has yet to announce the sanctions to be handed down.

Champion du monde 2018 et vice-champion du monde 2022, Mbappé était pressenti depuis plusieurs semaines pour hériter du brassard, après avoir guidé les Bleus vers leur deuxième finale de suite au Qatar en décembre. Le Parisien, leader technique et dont la voix porte de plus en plus dans le vestiaire, a marqué un triplé contre l'Argentine en finale et a réussi son tir au but, sans parvenir à offrir un troisième titre planétaire aux Tricolores (3-3, 4-2 t.a.b.).

The Three Lions will face the reigning European champions in Naples on Thursday night in the first of their qualifiers for next summer's tournament in Germany. And they took part in one of their final training sessions before jetting off to Campania for their clash with the Azzurri - who pipped them to glory in the final of Euro 2020 . Southgate oversaw a somewhat light training session at St George's Park, in which the players were all smiles for large parts. The former England international held court several times during the session as he instructed his troops on the game plan for Thursday's match at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. In addition to their work on the pitch, the Prem stars also worked out in the gym - although the session didn't seem to be too gruelling. Three Lions chief Southgate named his squad for their qualifiers with Italy and Ukraine last week. But THREE stars have been forced to withdraw ahead of Thursday's trip to Italy. Marcus Rashford, Mason Mount and Nick Pope have all pulled out of the squad due to injury. Manchester United hitman Rashford picked up a knock in the Red Devils' FA Cup quarter-final victory over Fulham on Sunday.

And Chelsea ace Mount will remain in London as he's still recovering from a bruised pelvis. Southampton keeper Fraser Forster has been brought in to replace Pope, although Southgate has opted not to bring in replacements for Rashford and Mount. Prior to their withdrawals, Southgate said of the qualifiers coming soon after the World Cup: “That is the big challenge we have got. \"To go to a World Cup, everyone wanted to be there and the fight for places was immense, the hunger was there and it was clear. Now you have to start again. “I know exactly where our most senior players are with that challenge: they are ready. \"The [Jordan] Hendersons, the [Harry] Kanes, they set the tone for that sort of mentality that is going to be needed. “We have basically a couple of days on the training pitch to prepare for a humdinger of a game in Naples so we have got to makes sure we are ready for that but I think the players will be ready for that. \"I know we are as a group of staff and it is a good test for us. “These are the sorts of games where we have to show we can go to these places and win.
