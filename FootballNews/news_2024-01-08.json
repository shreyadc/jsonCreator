WINNER: Bill Foley/behind the scenes football diplomacy A CBS interview with Texan Bill Foley, the billionaire owner of the new Auckland A-league side, provided a fascinating insight into his methods, and why he has been so successful. The 79-year-old’s attention to a range of details is impressive, and this even extends to the way he wants his EPL team Bournemouth to play. Attacking football is his mantra, believing that this is the only style that will enable Bournemouth to punch above its weight. Foley got mega-rich by establishing an insurance company 40 years ago, and the word is he has a great head for numbers. He comes across as refreshingly precise and clear-headed. I understand that this smart approach includes the new Auckland A-league operation going the extra mile to establish good relations with the city’s local football clubs. Understanding the issues is one thing, solving them is another when it comes to sporting passions. And running a local sports club is a tough business these days. Over many years, I’ve often detected what might be termed at least mild resistance to an A-league club among the big local clubs. They fear - it seems - they will get squashed and have the best young talent, which they have developed, prematurely ripped away. While their concerns have to be taken seriously, I would urge local clubs to grasp this A-league opportunity for all it is worth. And this new Auckland A-league club understands the pitfalls, and why local development programmes need to be respected. Here’s the bottom line though. It is, very likely, the last chance Auckland will ever have to get a tiny toehold in the wonderful world of professional football leagues. Bill Foley is a godsend. The chances of someone like him coming along, to give this city another chance in the football limelight, are close to zero. His presence is, quite honestly, a sporting miracle. Remember, he sees the Auckland club as the bottom step in a worldwide club system that peaks with Bournemouth. Along the way, the Auckland A-league club will give a clutch of local players their best chance of playing in the A-league and even moving beyond. It will also raise the prospects of local players making the World Cup-bound All Whites. And fans will have a local professional team to support, rejuvenating our flagging local sports scene. There may be arguments, there may be disputes. That’s life, and a robust football scene will only add to the game’s strength. But when it comes to the big picture, Auckland football has so much to gain if it can get on the same A-league page. WINNER: Unexpected comebacks to look forward to in 2024… …as in Joseph Parker and the new Auckland A-league football side. Parker surprised almost everybody with his Christmas victory over big-punching Deontay Wilder. The Auckland boxer is back in the heavyweight title game, although as Parker himself said in an interview over the weekend a rise in the rankings doesn’t automatically give him a better shot at glory. Boxing matchmaking is a mysterious business, and Parker may now be seen as a big risk to take on without enough financial gains. Bottom line though: Joseph Parker is a potentially fascinating sports story once again. As is the Auckland football side. After the failure of two previous franchises, it’s unlikely many people believed that Auckland would get another chance. WINNER: Coco Gauff Let’s hope the teenage American’s successful defence of the Auckland tennis title encourages her to return. Maybe a great run in the Aussie Open will also play a part in that. New Zealand gets so few world sports stars to compete here anymore. Her victory also helped get a bit more world coverage for our comparatively little tennis tournament. Thanks for coming, Coco Gauff. LOSER/WINNER: David Warner Warner should be revered - or at least highly respected - in his own cricket-loving country, but the flamboyant opener divides opinion in Australia. Will time help save his reputation? I’m not sure. For now, the 2018 ball-tampering controversy still looms large - rather than a black cloud, it’s a little piece of yellow sandpaper that hangs over his career. And he appears to have made matters worse with what many see as manipulative public statements. The retiring 37-year-old received a standing farewell ovation at the SCG, but his legacy is more complex. He also has a reputation as an arrogant sledger around the world, although great Aussie cricketers of the past have never feared being disliked beyond their shores. Warner could be a fantastic opener to watch though. And experience has taught me that the public persona of sports stars, the general perception of them, can be very different to reality. WINNER/LOSER: South African cricket The Proteas put on an incredible bowling burst at Newlands, dismissing six Indian batsmen for zero runs. It still wasn’t enough to save them, having scored just 55 in their first innings. This match was about as bizarre as test cricket can get, with Aiden Markram scoring a brilliant run-a-ball century, while none of his fellow South African batters passed 15 in the entire test. Once again, a test wicket came in for severe criticism after a rapid-fire, poor-quality game. WINNER: The Jordan Henderson story. The much-admired former Liverpool football captain attracted scorn when he quit for the Saudi Pro League, particularly as it flew in the face of his strident support for the LGBQT+ community. He is unsettled though and wants to return to the Premier League, with stories highlighting the poor crowds at the Saudi club matches. At one game last year, Henderson’s club Al-Ettifaq played in front of a mighty 696 fans. Yahoo. The Saudis believe that money can buy them anything, and are prepared to raid the world’s best football leagues. Reports say they want to dominate the world football scene. But the Saudis don’t seem to understand that football is a sport that is steeped in traditions and rivalries. They have no hope of recreating those aspects that drive the game around the world. Given that they are prepared to disrupt and deplete the great football leagues of the world and have the financial power to do so, it would be lovely to see the Saudi Pro League collapse.

Having suffered a 3-1 loss when the sides met in the Taca da Liga just four weeks ago, the Dragoes will look to exact their revenge against the hosts and pick up their first win of the year. © Reuters Estoril Praia were denied a dream start to the new year as they suffered a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Sporting Lisbon at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Friday. In-form striker Viktor Gyokeres finished with a hat-trick of assists while English winger Marcus Edwards netted a first-half brace to inspire the hosts to all three points. Prior to that, Estoril were on a four-game unbeaten run, picking up one draw and three wins, including a 3-1 victory over Porto when the sides met in Group D of the Taca da Liga on December 6. Friday's result leaves Vasco Seabra 's men ninth in the Primeira Liga standings , level on 17 points with Estrela Amadora and Boavista, and just two points above 16th-placed Portimonense in the relegation playoff spot. However, Estoril now return home, where they have won each of their last five matches, scoring 17 goals and conceding just twice since a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Benfica on October 7. © Reuters Porto, on the other hand, failed to make it five consecutive victories over Boavista on Friday as they were held to a 1-1 draw when the sides squared off at the Estadio do Bessa in the Primeira Liga. The Dragoes looked on course to a routine victory after Toni Martinez opened the scoring in the 23rd minute but Bruno Lourenco restored parity five minutes later before Os Axadrezados turned in a defensive masterclass to see out the draw. This result has now seen Porto slip five points adrift of Sporting Lisbon at the top of the Primeira Liga table as they currently occupy third-place, having picked up 35 points from 16 matches. Sergio Conceicao 's men now turn their attention to the Taca de Portugal, where they kicked off the campaign with a 2-0 victory over Vilar Perdizes on October 20, five weeks before thrashing Montalegre 4-0 in the second round. Tuesday's tie sees Porto journey to the Estadio Antonio Coimbra da Mota, where they are unbeaten in 11 of their last 12 visits — claiming six wins and five draws — with December's cup defeat being the exception. h1{font-family:sans-serif;font-size:1.2rem;letter-spacing:-.05rem}.container>div{width:400px}pre{background:#ddd;padding:5px;word-wrap:break-word}.hide{display:none} © Reuters Estoril Praia will take to the pitch without the services of Uruguayan defender Erick Cabaco , who has been out of action since last September through a muscle injury. Other than that, this weekend's hosts head into the game with a clean bill of health giving Saebra the luxury of a full strength squad at his disposal. We expect the Portuguese head coach to make a few changes to the starting sides that suffered a 5-1 hammering against Sporting, with the experienced duo of Cassiano and former Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala coming into the XI. Porto, on the other hand, remain without the services of experienced defender Ivan Marcano , who has been sidelined since sustaining an ACL injury back in September. He is joined on the Dragoes injury table by 29-year-old goalkeeper Samuel Portugal , who is currently recuperating from a groin problem. Conceicao will also be unable to name the attacking duo of Gabriel Veron and Fran Navarro, following their recent transfers to Cruzeiro and Olympiacos respectively. Estoril Praia possible starting lineup: Carne; Parra, Alvaro, Vital; Marques, Gomes, Araujo, Guitane; Koindredi, Holsgrove, Marques Porto possible starting lineup: Costa; Mario, Pepe, Cardoso, Wendell; Franco, Grujic, Eustaquio, Pepe; Martinez, Evanilson Having suffered a slip-up in their first outing of the year, Porto will head into the cup tie looking to quickly find their feet. While we expect Estoril to put up a fight at home, where they have been tough to crack of late, Conceicao's men boast the firepower needed to get the job done and we fancy them coming away with the desired results.

Estevao is already making waves at Under-20 level, though, netting twice in a 7-0 Copinha win over Queimadense on Thursday, and he was one of the stars of the 2023 Under-17 World Cup. The 2007-born attacker could not prevent Brazil from bowing out to Argentina in the quarter-finals, but he scored three goals and set up three more during the November tournament, earning plenty of glances from across Europe in the process. All of Barcelona, Real Madrid , Manchester City , Manchester United , Arsenal and Chelsea have been tipped to make a move for Estevao, whose contract with Palmeiras runs until 2026 with a release clause of €60m (£51.6m). © Reuters While Estevao is yearning for a switch to Camp Nou, it was previously reported that Barcelona's financial problems could jeopardize their chances of signing the South American protege given the widespread interest in his services. However, Mundo Deportivo now claims that Barcelona have been given the green light to pursue a move for Estevao despite their economic woes, as the 16-year-old only has eyes for a transfer to the La Liga champions. Estevao has been nicknamed 'Messinho' - an ode to his idol Lionel Messi - and both his agent and family are also convinced that Barcelona is the best place for him to develop in the coming years. First-team coach Xavi and sporting director Deco are also of the view that Estevao will blossom into a crucial player for the Blaugrana in the future, but he will not be able to officially join the club until his 18th birthday in 2025. Palmeiras are sympathetic to Estevao's desire to join Barcelona, and in order to help him fulfil his dream, the Brazilian club are supposedly prepared to accept a small percentage of the release clause now before receiving most of the money next year. © Reuters The report adds that only a \"crazy\" offer from a rival party would potentially make Palmeiras think twice, but for the moment, all the signs are pointing towards Estevao joining Barcelona. La Blaugrana have already added one up-and-coming Brazilian forward to their ranks this month, completing a deal to sign 18-year-old Vitor Roque from Athletico Paranaense on a seven-and-a-half-year contract. Roque has already made two appearances for Xavi's side, making his debut in Thursday's 2-1 La Liga win over Las Palmas and also coming off the bench in Sunday's 3-2 Copa del Rey beating of Barbastro. Barcelona are now gearing up for a trip to Saudi Arabia for the 2024 Supercopa de Espana, where they will face Osasuna on Thursday before a potential final against either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid on January 14.","pubDate":"2024-01-08 00:00:17","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/48/barcelona.jpg","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"3a1b0dcf783d6662e09bbd183777e753","title":"Mourinho Refuses To Coach Brazil","link":"https://www.zimeye.net/2024/01/08/mourinho-refuses-to-coach-brazil-2/","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["_Masv"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jose Mourinho has quashed rumors linking him to the role of Brazil’s next coach, refuting reports suggesting talks with the … Continue reading \"Mourinho Refuses To Coach Brazil\"","content":"Jose Mourinho has quashed rumors linking him to the role of Brazil’s next coach, refuting reports suggesting talks with the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF).

Both the Argentinian and the Brazilian were expected to be back in action this month, and that could still be the case, but Ten Hag has made no guarantees of that. The Red Devils boss says it could still be weeks for the defender and the midfielder to make the ‘next steps’ towards a return, after training on the grass fora number of days already. ‘They are a long time already back on the grass and now they return back into team training but not fully, so partial,’ Ten Hag told a press conference ahead of an FA Cup tie against Wigan on Monday night. ‘Now they have to make the next steps and that may take some days, I think even weeks.’ Manchester United still have a long list of injuries, but the likes of Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Anthony Martial are all thought to be back for the Premier League meeting with Tottenham on 14 January. Rasmus Hojlund is due to be back even sooner and is set to be involved on Monday at Wigan after recovering from the illness that kept him out of the defeat to Nottingham Forest last time out. ‘He will return,’ said Ten Hag. ‘He dropped out shortly before the game [against Forest] and so he was a little bit unwell before the game. ‘The day before we expected him to play and then he dropped out shortly before the game but he is back in training.’ MORE : Erik ten Hag speaks out on why Manchester United have suffered so many transfer nightmares MORE : Why Manchester United refused option to buy clause in Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho deal For more stories like this, check our sport page .

The win allowed Juventus to keep pace with leaders Inter Milan in the title race as they reached the halfway mark in the campaign in second spot in the standings on 46 points. They are two points behind Inter, who beat lowly Verona 2-1 in a drama-filled clash on Saturday, and seven above third-placed AC Milan . 'Let's be realistic. We have the Inter team in front of us who are having an important championship,' coach Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. 'Winning in Salerno was important to maintain the distance from fifth place.

Vlahovic echoed the coach's comments, stressing that a top-four finish is currently Juventus' main focus. 'Our goal is to get into the Champions League,' Vlahovic said. 'Let's move forward game by game, then we'll see.' Juventus missed out on the top-tier European competition this season having ended seventh last year after they were docked 10 points in May for the club's transfer dealings. Salernitana midfielder Giulio Maggiore beat Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with an unstoppable shot from the edge of the box before the break but Samuel Iling-Junior equalised in the 65th minute and Vlahovic headed home the winner in the 91st. The hosts were left with 10 men when Maggiore received his second booking for a tackle on Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot in the 53rd minute. Salernitana, who on Thursday were thrashed 6-1 at Juve in the Coppa Italia last 16 after opening the scoring in the first minute, had an early chance through Junior Sambia but Szczesny did well to keep out his low shot towards the near corner. However, Filippo Inzaghi's side took the lead six minutes before halftime, and Juventus were poor in front of goal until Iling-Junior found the leveller, striking into the roof of the net from close range. But 10-man Salernitana did not let Juve settle and Szczesny had to keep out a long-range effort from Domagoj Bradaric one minute later. The Pole had a lucky escape moments later when Simeon Nwankwo struck just wide from close range.

Mercato - RC Lens : Un transfert surprise se prépare https://t.co/lKmvbDxu5J pic.twitter.com/FFqDzJryM6 Transfert le plus cher de l’histoire du club, l’ancien attaquant de Montpellier n’a inscrit que 4 buts toutes compétitions confondues cette saison. Un manque d’efficacité qui commence à agacer une partie des supporters du RC Lens . Remplacé à la 73e minute par Wesley Saïd , Elye Wahi est sorti sous les sifflets de Bollaert. Ce qui n’a pas plu à Franck Haise : « On se parle régulièrement avec Elye. Le message à ceux qui sifflent : s’ils pensent que siffler un jeune joueur est la meilleure manière pour lui donner de la confiance et le rendre fort… ils ne sont pas très intelligents », a déclaré l’entraîneur du RC Lens .","pubDate":"2024-01-07 23:45:00","image_url":"https://le10static.com/img/cache/article/288x162/0000/0023/233428.jpeg","source_id":"le10sport","source_priority":1001293,"country":["france"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"3bdbd2399da249adbffe31da7e39075b","title":"Preview: Derby County vs. Bradford City - prediction, team news, lineups","link":"https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/derby-county/efl-trophy/preview/preview-derby-vs-bradford-prediction-team-news-lineups_533196.html","keywords":["football","efl trophy","derby county","league one","bradford city","league two","jake rooney","conor washington","korey smith","martyn waghorn","joe wildsmith","callum elder","tom barkhuizen","alex pattison","lewis richards","andy cook","graham alexander","liam ridehalgh","corey addai","nathaniel mendez-laing","james collins","jayden stockley","jamie walker","derby county vs bradford city","533196"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sports Mole previews Tuesday's EFL Trophy clash between Derby County and Bradford City, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.","content":"A place in the EFL Trophy quarter-finals will be at stake when League One Derby County play host to fourth-tier Bradford City on Tuesday. Derby have won four of their last five matches, while the Bantams enter the midweek contest off the back of a four-game winless run. © Reuters Derby will head into Tuesday's encounter in a positive mood after they bounced back from a 3-2 defeat against Peterborough United to beat Fleetwood Town 3-1 in Saturday's away fixture. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and James Collins grabbed a goal apiece to give the Rams a two-goal cushion, before Fleetwood striker Jayden Stockley halved the deficit in the 76th minute. However, substitute Tom Barkhuizen netted a third to ensure Derby picked up all three points, leaving them in fourth position and just two points adrift of the League One promotion places. Incidentally, Saturday's result represented the second time the Rams had beaten Fleetwood in the space of a month after cruising to a 3-0 victory in December's EFL Trophy clash to set up the last-16 tie against Bradford. Having won all four matches in this season's competition, the Rams will fancy their chances of claiming another win on Tuesday, especially as three of those victories took place on home turf. While Derby have won eight of their last 10 competitive matches (D1, L1), Bradford have failed to win any of their last four matches since beating Doncaster Rovers 3-1 before Christmas. After rounding off 2023 with consecutive draws, the Bantams have begun the new year with back-to-back defeats, including a 4-2 loss in Saturday's home clash with Crawley Town. Graham Alexander 's side came from behind to establish a 2-1 lead thanks to a Liam Ridehalgh effort and a Corey Addai own goal, but they ultimately conceded three late goals – including two in stoppage time – to fall to their first home defeat since November 11. The Bantams, who occupy 14th place in League Two, will be looking for a positive response when they face Derby in a competitive game for the first time since April 2004. Like their hosts, Bradford have won all four games in the EFL Trophy this season, scoring an impressive 13 goals in that period – four of which came in the previous round against Liverpool Under-21s. © Reuters Derby are unable to call upon defender Jake Rooney and forward Conor Washington due to knee and ankle problems respectively. Korey Smith and Martyn Waghorn are closing in on a return to full training, but Tuesday's contest will come too soon for the pair. Warne could be tempted to make a few changes, with Joe Wildsmith , Callum Elder and Barkhuizen all in contention to start against the Bantams. As for the visitors, they are still without the services of Alex Pattison and Jamie Walker , who are ruled out through injury. Left-back Lewis Richards is set to miss a fourth straight game with a calf problem, but he is targeting a return for Saturday's league clash with Colchester United. Having scored 12 goals across all competitions this term, experienced forward Andy Cook will provide Bradford's main goal threat in Tuesday's EFL Trophy meeting. Derby County possible starting lineup: Wildsmith; Nelson, Bradley, Cashin; Wilson, Bird, Hourihane, Forsyth; Mendez-Laing, Barkhuizen; Collins Bradford City possible starting lineup: Lewis; Tomkinson, Kelly, Platt; Halliday, Gilliead, Smallwood, Ridehalgh; Odour; Cook, Smith Although Bradford have struggled in recent league games, they have won all four games in the EFL Trophy to seal their place in the last 16. However, we think their fine run in the competition will be brought to an end by an in-form Derby side that has won four of their last five competitive matches.

Winfield dove to force a fumble by Panthers wide receiver DJ Chark before Chark could score a touchdown and had a sack that forced the Panthers to try a longer field goal that Matthew Wright missed in the second half. Those plays loomed large in a 9-0 win that made the Bucs the NFC South champs for the third straight year. Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles said “thank goodness” for Winfield’s forced fumble after the game and shared his thoughts on how Winfield can continue to make something out of being passed over for the Pro Bowl. “He can take us , just like he did,” Bowles said, via the team’s website. “Winning playoff games and Super Bowls, that’s what helps your Pro Bowl snubs.” Winfield and the Bucs will host a playoff game next weekend and that will give him a chance to continue an outstanding season in Tampa.","pubDate":"2024-01-07 23:41:02","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f082f4f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4771x2684+0+0/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F6a%2Feb8ae5fb4edb9c82dafb16927419%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1915237209","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"fefcf03df1ed372942a21034e36cfb02","title":"Auckland’s new billionaire A-League owner ‘refreshingly precise’ - Chris Rattue","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/aucklands-new-billionaire-a-league-owner-refreshingly-precise-chris-rattue/DBXS2UGLKNA5VN5UE2AF56RSMM/","keywords":null,"creator":["Chris Rattue"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Rattue runs through the best and worst from the sporting weekend.","content":"Chris Rattue runs through the best and worst from the sporting weekend. WINNER: Bill Foley/behind the scenes football diplomacy A CBS interview with Texan Bill Foley, the billionaire owner of the new Auckland A-league side, provided a fascinating insight into his methods, and why he has been so successful. The 79-year-old’s attention to a range of details is impressive, and this even extends to the way he wants his EPL team Bournemouth to play. Attacking football is his mantra, believing that this is the only style that will enable Bournemouth to punch above its weight. Foley got mega-rich by establishing an insurance company 40 years ago, and the word is he has a great head for numbers. He comes across as refreshingly precise and clear-headed. I understand that this smart approach includes the new Auckland A-league operation going the extra mile to establish good relations with the city’s local football clubs. Understanding the issues is one thing, solving them is another when it comes to sporting passions. And running a local sports club is a tough business these days. Over many years, I’ve often detected what might be termed at least mild resistance to an A-league club among the big local clubs. They fear - it seems - they will get squashed and have the best young talent, which they have developed, prematurely ripped away. While their concerns have to be taken seriously, I would urge local clubs to grasp this A-league opportunity for all it is worth. And this new Auckland A-league club understands the pitfalls, and why local development programmes need to be respected. Here’s the bottom line though. It is, very likely, the last chance Auckland will ever have to get a tiny toehold in the wonderful world of professional football leagues. Bill Foley is a godsend. The chances of someone like him coming along, to give this city another chance in the football limelight, are close to zero. His presence is, quite honestly, a sporting miracle. Remember, he sees the Auckland club as the bottom step in a worldwide club system that peaks with Bournemouth. Along the way, the Auckland A-league club will give a clutch of local players their best chance of playing in the A-league and even moving beyond. It will also raise the prospects of local players making the World Cup-bound All Whites. And fans will have a local professional team to support, rejuvenating our flagging local sports scene. There may be arguments, there may be disputes. That’s life, and a robust football scene will only add to the game’s strength. But when it comes to the big picture, Auckland football has so much to gain if it can get on the same A-league page. WINNER: Unexpected comebacks to look forward to in 2024… …as in Joseph Parker and the new Auckland A-league football side. Parker surprised almost everybody with his Christmas victory over big-punching Deontay Wilder. The Auckland boxer is back in the heavyweight title game, although as Parker himself said in an interview over the weekend a rise in the rankings doesn’t automatically give him a better shot at glory. Boxing matchmaking is a mysterious business, and Parker may now be seen as a big risk to take on without enough financial gains. Bottom line though: Joseph Parker is a potentially fascinating sports story once again. As is the Auckland football side. After the failure of two previous franchises, it’s unlikely many people believed that Auckland would get another chance. WINNER: Coco Gauff Let’s hope the teenage American’s successful defence of the Auckland tennis title encourages her to return. Maybe a great run in the Aussie Open will also play a part in that. New Zealand gets so few world sports stars to compete here anymore. Her victory also helped get a bit more world coverage for our comparatively little tennis tournament. Thanks for coming, Coco Gauff. LOSER/WINNER: David Warner Warner should be revered - or at least highly respected - in his own cricket-loving country, but the flamboyant opener divides opinion in Australia. Will time help save his reputation? I’m not sure. For now, the 2018 ball-tampering controversy still looms large - rather than a black cloud, it’s a little piece of yellow sandpaper that hangs over his career. And he appears to have made matters worse with what many see as manipulative public statements. The retiring 37-year-old received a standing farewell ovation at the SCG, but his legacy is more complex. He also has a reputation as an arrogant sledger around the world, although great Aussie cricketers of the past have never feared being disliked beyond their shores. Warner could be a fantastic opener to watch though. And experience has taught me that the public persona of sports stars, the general perception of them, can be very different to reality. WINNER/LOSER: South African cricket The Proteas put on an incredible bowling burst at Newlands, dismissing six Indian batsmen for zero runs. It still wasn’t enough to save them, having scored just 55 in their first innings. This match was about as bizarre as test cricket can get, with Aiden Markram scoring a brilliant run-a-ball century, while none of his fellow South African batters passed 15 in the entire test. Once again, a test wicket came in for severe criticism after a rapid-fire, poor-quality game. WINNER: The Jordan Henderson story. The much-admired former Liverpool football captain attracted scorn when he quit for the Saudi Pro League, particularly as it flew in the face of his strident support for the LGBQT+ community. He is unsettled though and wants to return to the Premier League, with stories highlighting the poor crowds at the Saudi club matches. At one game last year, Henderson’s club Al-Ettifaq played in front of a mighty 696 fans. Yahoo. The Saudis believe that money can buy them anything, and are prepared to raid the world’s best football leagues. Reports say they want to dominate the world football scene. But the Saudis don’t seem to understand that football is a sport that is steeped in traditions and rivalries. They have no hope of recreating those aspects that drive the game around the world. Given that they are prepared to disrupt and deplete the great football leagues of the world and have the financial power to do so, it would be lovely to see the Saudi Pro League collapse.

Having suffered a 3-1 loss when the sides met in the Taca da Liga just four weeks ago, the Dragoes will look to exact their revenge against the hosts and pick up their first win of the year. © Reuters Estoril Praia were denied a dream start to the new year as they suffered a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Sporting Lisbon at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Friday. In-form striker Viktor Gyokeres finished with a hat-trick of assists while English winger Marcus Edwards netted a first-half brace to inspire the hosts to all three points. Prior to that, Estoril were on a four-game unbeaten run, picking up one draw and three wins, including a 3-1 victory over Porto when the sides met in Group D of the Taca da Liga on December 6. Friday's result leaves Vasco Seabra 's men ninth in the Primeira Liga standings , level on 17 points with Estrela Amadora and Boavista, and just two points above 16th-placed Portimonense in the relegation playoff spot. However, Estoril now return home, where they have won each of their last five matches, scoring 17 goals and conceding just twice since a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Benfica on October 7. © Reuters Porto, on the other hand, failed to make it five consecutive victories over Boavista on Friday as they were held to a 1-1 draw when the sides squared off at the Estadio do Bessa in the Primeira Liga. The Dragoes looked on course to a routine victory after Toni Martinez opened the scoring in the 23rd minute but Bruno Lourenco restored parity five minutes later before Os Axadrezados turned in a defensive masterclass to see out the draw. This result has now seen Porto slip five points adrift of Sporting Lisbon at the top of the Primeira Liga table as they currently occupy third-place, having picked up 35 points from 16 matches. Sergio Conceicao 's men now turn their attention to the Taca de Portugal, where they kicked off the campaign with a 2-0 victory over Vilar Perdizes on October 20, five weeks before thrashing Montalegre 4-0 in the second round. Tuesday's tie sees Porto journey to the Estadio Antonio Coimbra da Mota, where they are unbeaten in 11 of their last 12 visits — claiming six wins and five draws — with December's cup defeat being the exception. h1{font-family:sans-serif;font-size:1.2rem;letter-spacing:-.05rem}.container>div{width:400px}pre{background:#ddd;padding:5px;word-wrap:break-word}.hide{display:none} © Reuters Estoril Praia will take to the pitch without the services of Uruguayan defender Erick Cabaco , who has been out of action since last September through a muscle injury. Other than that, this weekend's hosts head into the game with a clean bill of health giving Saebra the luxury of a full strength squad at his disposal. We expect the Portuguese head coach to make a few changes to the starting sides that suffered a 5-1 hammering against Sporting, with the experienced duo of Cassiano and former Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala coming into the XI. Porto, on the other hand, remain without the services of experienced defender Ivan Marcano , who has been sidelined since sustaining an ACL injury back in September. He is joined on the Dragoes injury table by 29-year-old goalkeeper Samuel Portugal , who is currently recuperating from a groin problem. Conceicao will also be unable to name the attacking duo of Gabriel Veron and Fran Navarro, following their recent transfers to Cruzeiro and Olympiacos respectively.

Estevao is already making waves at Under-20 level, though, netting twice in a 7-0 Copinha win over Queimadense on Thursday, and he was one of the stars of the 2023 Under-17 World Cup. The 2007-born attacker could not prevent Brazil from bowing out to Argentina in the quarter-finals, but he scored three goals and set up three more during the November tournament, earning plenty of glances from across Europe in the process. All of Barcelona, Real Madrid , Manchester City , Manchester United , Arsenal and Chelsea have been tipped to make a move for Estevao, whose contract with Palmeiras runs until 2026 with a release clause of €60m (£51.6m). © Reuters While Estevao is yearning for a switch to Camp Nou, it was previously reported that Barcelona's financial problems could jeopardize their chances of signing the South American protege given the widespread interest in his services. However, Mundo Deportivo now claims that Barcelona have been given the green light to pursue a move for Estevao despite their economic woes, as the 16-year-old only has eyes for a transfer to the La Liga champions. Estevao has been nicknamed 'Messinho' - an ode to his idol Lionel Messi - and both his agent and family are also convinced that Barcelona is the best place for him to develop in the coming years. First-team coach Xavi and sporting director Deco are also of the view that Estevao will blossom into a crucial player for the Blaugrana in the future, but he will not be able to officially join the club until his 18th birthday in 2025. Palmeiras are sympathetic to Estevao's desire to join Barcelona, and in order to help him fulfil his dream, the Brazilian club are supposedly prepared to accept a small percentage of the release clause now before receiving most of the money next year. © Reuters The report adds that only a \"crazy\" offer from a rival party would potentially make Palmeiras think twice, but for the moment, all the signs are pointing towards Estevao joining Barcelona. La Blaugrana have already added one up-and-coming Brazilian forward to their ranks this month, completing a deal to sign 18-year-old Vitor Roque from Athletico Paranaense on a seven-and-a-half-year contract. Roque has already made two appearances for Xavi's side, making his debut in Thursday's 2-1 La Liga win over Las Palmas and also coming off the bench in Sunday's 3-2 Copa del Rey beating of Barbastro. Barcelona are now gearing up for a trip to Saudi Arabia for the 2024 Supercopa de Espana, where they will face Osasuna on Thursday before a potential final against either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid on January 14.","pubDate":"2024-01-08 00:00:17","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/48/barcelona.jpg","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"3a1b0dcf783d6662e09bbd183777e753","title":"Mourinho Refuses To Coach Brazil","link":"https://www.zimeye.net/2024/01/08/mourinho-refuses-to-coach-brazil-2/","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["_Masv"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jose Mourinho has quashed rumors linking him to the role of Brazil’s next coach, refuting reports suggesting talks with the … Continue reading \"Mourinho Refuses To Coach Brazil\"","content":"Jose Mourinho has quashed rumors linking him to the role of Brazil’s next coach, refuting reports suggesting talks with the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF).

FA Cup replays must remain for the good of English football - It's All Kicking Off By Reuters Published: 23:51 GMT, 7 January 2024 | Updated: 23:51 GMT, 7 January 2024 e-mail View comments A stoppage-time header by Dusan Vlahovic helped Juventus come from behind to grab a 2-1 win at Salernitana in Serie A on Sunday after the hosts were reduced to 10 men early in the second half. The win allowed Juventus to keep pace with leaders Inter Milan in the title race as they reached the halfway mark in the campaign in second spot in the standings on 46 points. They are two points behind Inter, who beat lowly Verona 2-1 in a drama-filled clash on Saturday, and seven above third-placed AC Milan . 'Let's be realistic. We have the Inter team in front of us who are having an important championship,' coach Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. 'Winning in Salerno was important to maintain the distance from fifth place. We have a 14-point advantage, that means five games. That's already a lot.'

Vlahovic echoed the coach's comments, stressing that a top-four finish is currently Juventus' main focus. 'Our goal is to get into the Champions League,' Vlahovic said. 'Let's move forward game by game, then we'll see.' Juventus missed out on the top-tier European competition this season having ended seventh last year after they were docked 10 points in May for the club's transfer dealings. Salernitana midfielder Giulio Maggiore beat Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with an unstoppable shot from the edge of the box before the break but Samuel Iling-Junior equalised in the 65th minute and Vlahovic headed home the winner in the 91st. The hosts were left with 10 men when Maggiore received his second booking for a tackle on Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot in the 53rd minute. Salernitana, who on Thursday were thrashed 6-1 at Juve in the Coppa Italia last 16 after opening the scoring in the first minute, had an early chance through Junior Sambia but Szczesny did well to keep out his low shot towards the near corner. However, Filippo Inzaghi's side took the lead six minutes before halftime, and Juventus were poor in front of goal until Iling-Junior found the leveller, striking into the roof of the net from close range. But 10-man Salernitana did not let Juve settle and Szczesny had to keep out a long-range effort from Domagoj Bradaric one minute later. The Pole had a lucky escape moments later when Simeon Nwankwo struck just wide from close range.

Derby have won four of their last five matches, while the Bantams enter the midweek contest off the back of a four-game winless run. © Reuters Derby will head into Tuesday's encounter in a positive mood after they bounced back from a 3-2 defeat against Peterborough United to beat Fleetwood Town 3-1 in Saturday's away fixture. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and James Collins grabbed a goal apiece to give the Rams a two-goal cushion, before Fleetwood striker Jayden Stockley halved the deficit in the 76th minute. However, substitute Tom Barkhuizen netted a third to ensure Derby picked up all three points, leaving them in fourth position and just two points adrift of the League One promotion places. Incidentally, Saturday's result represented the second time the Rams had beaten Fleetwood in the space of a month after cruising to a 3-0 victory in December's EFL Trophy clash to set up the last-16 tie against Bradford. Having won all four matches in this season's competition, the Rams will fancy their chances of claiming another win on Tuesday, especially as three of those victories took place on home turf. While Derby have won eight of their last 10 competitive matches (D1, L1), Bradford have failed to win any of their last four matches since beating Doncaster Rovers 3-1 before Christmas. After rounding off 2023 with consecutive draws, the Bantams have begun the new year with back-to-back defeats, including a 4-2 loss in Saturday's home clash with Crawley Town. Graham Alexander 's side came from behind to establish a 2-1 lead thanks to a Liam Ridehalgh effort and a Corey Addai own goal, but they ultimately conceded three late goals – including two in stoppage time – to fall to their first home defeat since November 11. The Bantams, who occupy 14th place in League Two, will be looking for a positive response when they face Derby in a competitive game for the first time since April 2004. Like their hosts, Bradford have won all four games in the EFL Trophy this season, scoring an impressive 13 goals in that period – four of which came in the previous round against Liverpool Under-21s. © Reuters Derby are unable to call upon defender Jake Rooney and forward Conor Washington due to knee and ankle problems respectively. Korey Smith and Martyn Waghorn are closing in on a return to full training, but Tuesday's contest will come too soon for the pair. Warne could be tempted to make a few changes, with Joe Wildsmith , Callum Elder and Barkhuizen all in contention to start against the Bantams. As for the visitors, they are still without the services of Alex Pattison and Jamie Walker , who are ruled out through injury. Left-back Lewis Richards is set to miss a fourth straight game with a calf problem, but he is targeting a return for Saturday's league clash with Colchester United. Having scored 12 goals across all competitions this term, experienced forward Andy Cook will provide Bradford's main goal threat in Tuesday's EFL Trophy meeting. Derby County possible starting lineup: Wildsmith; Nelson, Bradley, Cashin; Wilson, Bird, Hourihane, Forsyth; Mendez-Laing, Barkhuizen; Collins Bradford City possible starting lineup: Lewis; Tomkinson, Kelly, Platt; Halliday, Gilliead, Smallwood, Ridehalgh; Odour; Cook, Smith Although Bradford have struggled in recent league games, they have won all four games in the EFL Trophy to seal their place in the last 16. However, we think their fine run in the competition will be brought to an end by an in-form Derby side that has won four of their last five competitive matches.

Winfield dove to force a fumble by Panthers wide receiver DJ Chark before Chark could score a touchdown and had a sack that forced the Panthers to try a longer field goal that Matthew Wright missed in the second half. Those plays loomed large in a 9-0 win that made the Bucs the NFC South champs for the third straight year. Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles said “thank goodness” for Winfield’s forced fumble after the game and shared his thoughts on how Winfield can continue to make something out of being passed over for the Pro Bowl. “He can take us , just like he did,” Bowles said, via the team’s website. “Winning playoff games and Super Bowls, that’s what helps your Pro Bowl snubs.” Winfield and the Bucs will host a playoff game next weekend and that will give him a chance to continue an outstanding season in Tampa.","pubDate":"2024-01-07 23:41:02","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f082f4f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4771x2684+0+0/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F6a%2Feb8ae5fb4edb9c82dafb16927419%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1915237209","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"fefcf03df1ed372942a21034e36cfb02","title":"Auckland’s new billionaire A-League owner ‘refreshingly precise’ - Chris Rattue","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/aucklands-new-billionaire-a-league-owner-refreshingly-precise-chris-rattue/DBXS2UGLKNA5VN5UE2AF56RSMM/","keywords":null,"creator":["Chris Rattue"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Rattue runs through the best and worst from the sporting weekend.","content":"Chris Rattue runs through the best and worst from the sporting weekend. WINNER: Bill Foley/behind the scenes football diplomacy A CBS interview with Texan Bill Foley, the billionaire owner of the new Auckland A-league side, provided a fascinating insight into his methods, and why he has been so successful. The 79-year-old’s attention to a range of details is impressive, and this even extends to the way he wants his EPL team Bournemouth to play. Attacking football is his mantra, believing that this is the only style that will enable Bournemouth to punch above its weight. Foley got mega-rich by establishing an insurance company 40 years ago, and the word is he has a great head for numbers. He comes across as refreshingly precise and clear-headed. I understand that this smart approach includes the new Auckland A-league operation going the extra mile to establish good relations with the city’s local football clubs. Understanding the issues is one thing, solving them is another when it comes to sporting passions. And running a local sports club is a tough business these days. Over many years, I’ve often detected what might be termed at least mild resistance to an A-league club among the big local clubs. They fear - it seems - they will get squashed and have the best young talent, which they have developed, prematurely ripped away. While their concerns have to be taken seriously, I would urge local clubs to grasp this A-league opportunity for all it is worth. And this new Auckland A-league club understands the pitfalls, and why local development programmes need to be respected. Here’s the bottom line though. It is, very likely, the last chance Auckland will ever have to get a tiny toehold in the wonderful world of professional football leagues. Bill Foley is a godsend. The chances of someone like him coming along, to give this city another chance in the football limelight, are close to zero. His presence is, quite honestly, a sporting miracle. Remember, he sees the Auckland club as the bottom step in a worldwide club system that peaks with Bournemouth. Along the way, the Auckland A-league club will give a clutch of local players their best chance of playing in the A-league and even moving beyond. It will also raise the prospects of local players making the World Cup-bound All Whites. And fans will have a local professional team to support, rejuvenating our flagging local sports scene. There may be arguments, there may be disputes. That’s life, and a robust football scene will only add to the game’s strength. But when it comes to the big picture, Auckland football has so much to gain if it can get on the same A-league page. WINNER: Unexpected comebacks to look forward to in 2024… …as in Joseph Parker and the new Auckland A-league football side. Parker surprised almost everybody with his Christmas victory over big-punching Deontay Wilder. The Auckland boxer is back in the heavyweight title game, although as Parker himself said in an interview over the weekend a rise in the rankings doesn’t automatically give him a better shot at glory. Boxing matchmaking is a mysterious business, and Parker may now be seen as a big risk to take on without enough financial gains. Bottom line though: Joseph Parker is a potentially fascinating sports story once again. As is the Auckland football side. After the failure of two previous franchises, it’s unlikely many people believed that Auckland would get another chance. WINNER: Coco Gauff Let’s hope the teenage American’s successful defence of the Auckland tennis title encourages her to return. Maybe a great run in the Aussie Open will also play a part in that. New Zealand gets so few world sports stars to compete here anymore. Her victory also helped get a bit more world coverage for our comparatively little tennis tournament. Thanks for coming, Coco Gauff. LOSER/WINNER: David Warner Warner should be revered - or at least highly respected - in his own cricket-loving country, but the flamboyant opener divides opinion in Australia. Will time help save his reputation? I’m not sure. For now, the 2018 ball-tampering controversy still looms large - rather than a black cloud, it’s a little piece of yellow sandpaper that hangs over his career. And he appears to have made matters worse with what many see as manipulative public statements. The retiring 37-year-old received a standing farewell ovation at the SCG, but his legacy is more complex. He also has a reputation as an arrogant sledger around the world, although great Aussie cricketers of the past have never feared being disliked beyond their shores. Warner could be a fantastic opener to watch though. And experience has taught me that the public persona of sports stars, the general perception of them, can be very different to reality. WINNER/LOSER: South African cricket The Proteas put on an incredible bowling burst at Newlands, dismissing six Indian batsmen for zero runs. It still wasn’t enough to save them, having scored just 55 in their first innings. This match was about as bizarre as test cricket can get, with Aiden Markram scoring a brilliant run-a-ball century, while none of his fellow South African batters passed 15 in the entire test. Once again, a test wicket came in for severe criticism after a rapid-fire, poor-quality game. WINNER: The Jordan Henderson story. The much-admired former Liverpool football captain attracted scorn when he quit for the Saudi Pro League, particularly as it flew in the face of his strident support for the LGBQT+ community. He is unsettled though and wants to return to the Premier League, with stories highlighting the poor crowds at the Saudi club matches. At one game last year, Henderson’s club Al-Ettifaq played in front of a mighty 696 fans. Yahoo. The Saudis believe that money can buy them anything, and are prepared to raid the world’s best football leagues. Reports say they want to dominate the world football scene. But the Saudis don’t seem to understand that football is a sport that is steeped in traditions and rivalries. They have no hope of recreating those aspects that drive the game around the world. Given that they are prepared to disrupt and deplete the great football leagues of the world and have the financial power to do so, it would be lovely to see the Saudi Pro League collapse.

Having suffered a 3-1 loss when the sides met in the Taca da Liga just four weeks ago, the Dragoes will look to exact their revenge against the hosts and pick up their first win of the year. © Reuters Estoril Praia were denied a dream start to the new year as they suffered a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Sporting Lisbon at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Friday. In-form striker Viktor Gyokeres finished with a hat-trick of assists while English winger Marcus Edwards netted a first-half brace to inspire the hosts to all three points. Prior to that, Estoril were on a four-game unbeaten run, picking up one draw and three wins, including a 3-1 victory over Porto when the sides met in Group D of the Taca da Liga on December 6. Friday's result leaves Vasco Seabra 's men ninth in the Primeira Liga standings , level on 17 points with Estrela Amadora and Boavista, and just two points above 16th-placed Portimonense in the relegation playoff spot. However, Estoril now return home, where they have won each of their last five matches, scoring 17 goals and conceding just twice since a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Benfica on October 7. © Reuters Porto, on the other hand, failed to make it five consecutive victories over Boavista on Friday as they were held to a 1-1 draw when the sides squared off at the Estadio do Bessa in the Primeira Liga. The Dragoes looked on course to a routine victory after Toni Martinez opened the scoring in the 23rd minute but Bruno Lourenco restored parity five minutes later before Os Axadrezados turned in a defensive masterclass to see out the draw. This result has now seen Porto slip five points adrift of Sporting Lisbon at the top of the Primeira Liga table as they currently occupy third-place, having picked up 35 points from 16 matches. Sergio Conceicao 's men now turn their attention to the Taca de Portugal, where they kicked off the campaign with a 2-0 victory over Vilar Perdizes on October 20, five weeks before thrashing Montalegre 4-0 in the second round. Tuesday's tie sees Porto journey to the Estadio Antonio Coimbra da Mota, where they are unbeaten in 11 of their last 12 visits — claiming six wins and five draws — with December's cup defeat being the exception. h1{font-family:sans-serif;font-size:1.2rem;letter-spacing:-.05rem}.container>div{width:400px}pre{background:#ddd;padding:5px;word-wrap:break-word}.hide{display:none} © Reuters Estoril Praia will take to the pitch without the services of Uruguayan defender Erick Cabaco , who has been out of action since last September through a muscle injury. Other than that, this weekend's hosts head into the game with a clean bill of health giving Saebra the luxury of a full strength squad at his disposal. We expect the Portuguese head coach to make a few changes to the starting sides that suffered a 5-1 hammering against Sporting, with the experienced duo of Cassiano and former Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala coming into the XI. Porto, on the other hand, remain without the services of experienced defender Ivan Marcano , who has been sidelined since sustaining an ACL injury back in September. He is joined on the Dragoes injury table by 29-year-old goalkeeper Samuel Portugal , who is currently recuperating from a groin problem. Conceicao will also be unable to name the attacking duo of Gabriel Veron and Fran Navarro, following their recent transfers to Cruzeiro and Olympiacos respectively.

All of Barcelona, Real Madrid , Manchester City , Manchester United , Arsenal and Chelsea have been tipped to make a move for Estevao, whose contract with Palmeiras runs until 2026 with a release clause of €60m (£51.6m). © Reuters While Estevao is yearning for a switch to Camp Nou, it was previously reported that Barcelona's financial problems could jeopardize their chances of signing the South American protege given the widespread interest in his services. However, Mundo Deportivo now claims that Barcelona have been given the green light to pursue a move for Estevao despite their economic woes, as the 16-year-old only has eyes for a transfer to the La Liga champions. Estevao has been nicknamed 'Messinho' - an ode to his idol Lionel Messi - and both his agent and family are also convinced that Barcelona is the best place for him to develop in the coming years. First-team coach Xavi and sporting director Deco are also of the view that Estevao will blossom into a crucial player for the Blaugrana in the future, but he will not be able to officially join the club until his 18th birthday in 2025. Palmeiras are sympathetic to Estevao's desire to join Barcelona, and in order to help him fulfil his dream, the Brazilian club are supposedly prepared to accept a small percentage of the release clause now before receiving most of the money next year. © Reuters The report adds that only a \"crazy\" offer from a rival party would potentially make Palmeiras think twice, but for the moment, all the signs are pointing towards Estevao joining Barcelona. La Blaugrana have already added one up-and-coming Brazilian forward to their ranks this month, completing a deal to sign 18-year-old Vitor Roque from Athletico Paranaense on a seven-and-a-half-year contract. Roque has already made two appearances for Xavi's side, making his debut in Thursday's 2-1 La Liga win over Las Palmas and also coming off the bench in Sunday's 3-2 Copa del Rey beating of Barbastro. Barcelona are now gearing up for a trip to Saudi Arabia for the 2024 Supercopa de Espana, where they will face Osasuna on Thursday before a potential final against either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid on January 14.","pubDate":"2024-01-08 00:00:17","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/48/barcelona.jpg","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"3a1b0dcf783d6662e09bbd183777e753","title":"Mourinho Refuses To Coach Brazil","link":"https://www.zimeye.net/2024/01/08/mourinho-refuses-to-coach-brazil-2/","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["_Masv"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jose Mourinho has quashed rumors linking him to the role of Brazil’s next coach, refuting reports suggesting talks with the … Continue reading \"Mourinho Refuses To Coach Brazil\"","content":"Jose Mourinho has quashed rumors linking him to the role of Brazil’s next coach, refuting reports suggesting talks with the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF).

He emphasized his agent’s directive not to engage in talks unless a club’s interest is confirmed.

Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis Martinez has been out since September due to a foot injury, while Casemiro last played on 1 September as he has a hamstring issue. Both the Argentinian and the Brazilian were expected to be back in action this month, and that could still be the case, but Ten Hag has made no guarantees of that. The Red Devils boss says it could still be weeks for the defender and the midfielder to make the ‘next steps’ towards a return, after training on the grass fora number of days already. ‘They are a long time already back on the grass and now they return back into team training but not fully, so partial,’ Ten Hag told a press conference ahead of an FA Cup tie against Wigan on Monday night. ‘Now they have to make the next steps and that may take some days, I think even weeks.’ Manchester United still have a long list of injuries, but the likes of Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire and Anthony Martial are all thought to be back for the Premier League meeting with Tottenham on 14 January. Rasmus Hojlund is due to be back even sooner and is set to be involved on Monday at Wigan after recovering from the illness that kept him out of the defeat to Nottingham Forest last time out. ‘He will return,’ said Ten Hag. ‘He dropped out shortly before the game [against Forest] and so he was a little bit unwell before the game. ‘The day before we expected him to play and then he dropped out shortly before the game but he is back in training.’ MORE : Erik ten Hag speaks out on why Manchester United have suffered so many transfer nightmares MORE : Why Manchester United refused option to buy clause in Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho deal For more stories like this, check our sport page .

FA Cup replays must remain for the good of English football - It's All Kicking Off By Reuters Published: 23:51 GMT, 7 January 2024 | Updated: 23:51 GMT, 7 January 2024 e-mail View comments A stoppage-time header by Dusan Vlahovic helped Juventus come from behind to grab a 2-1 win at Salernitana in Serie A on Sunday after the hosts were reduced to 10 men early in the second half. The win allowed Juventus to keep pace with leaders Inter Milan in the title race as they reached the halfway mark in the campaign in second spot in the standings on 46 points. They are two points behind Inter, who beat lowly Verona 2-1 in a drama-filled clash on Saturday, and seven above third-placed AC Milan . 'Let's be realistic. We have the Inter team in front of us who are having an important championship,' coach Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. 'Winning in Salerno was important to maintain the distance from fifth place. We have a 14-point advantage, that means five games. That's already a lot.'

Vlahovic echoed the coach's comments, stressing that a top-four finish is currently Juventus' main focus. 'Our goal is to get into the Champions League,' Vlahovic said. 'Let's move forward game by game, then we'll see.' Juventus missed out on the top-tier European competition this season having ended seventh last year after they were docked 10 points in May for the club's transfer dealings. Salernitana midfielder Giulio Maggiore beat Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with an unstoppable shot from the edge of the box before the break but Samuel Iling-Junior equalised in the 65th minute and Vlahovic headed home the winner in the 91st. The hosts were left with 10 men when Maggiore received his second booking for a tackle on Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot in the 53rd minute. Salernitana, who on Thursday were thrashed 6-1 at Juve in the Coppa Italia last 16 after opening the scoring in the first minute, had an early chance through Junior Sambia but Szczesny did well to keep out his low shot towards the near corner. However, Filippo Inzaghi's side took the lead six minutes before halftime, and Juventus were poor in front of goal until Iling-Junior found the leveller, striking into the roof of the net from close range. But 10-man Salernitana did not let Juve settle and Szczesny had to keep out a long-range effort from Domagoj Bradaric one minute later. The Pole had a lucky escape moments later when Simeon Nwankwo struck just wide from close range.

Derby have won four of their last five matches, while the Bantams enter the midweek contest off the back of a four-game winless run. © Reuters Derby will head into Tuesday's encounter in a positive mood after they bounced back from a 3-2 defeat against Peterborough United to beat Fleetwood Town 3-1 in Saturday's away fixture. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and James Collins grabbed a goal apiece to give the Rams a two-goal cushion, before Fleetwood striker Jayden Stockley halved the deficit in the 76th minute. However, substitute Tom Barkhuizen netted a third to ensure Derby picked up all three points, leaving them in fourth position and just two points adrift of the League One promotion places. Incidentally, Saturday's result represented the second time the Rams had beaten Fleetwood in the space of a month after cruising to a 3-0 victory in December's EFL Trophy clash to set up the last-16 tie against Bradford. Having won all four matches in this season's competition, the Rams will fancy their chances of claiming another win on Tuesday, especially as three of those victories took place on home turf. While Derby have won eight of their last 10 competitive matches (D1, L1), Bradford have failed to win any of their last four matches since beating Doncaster Rovers 3-1 before Christmas. After rounding off 2023 with consecutive draws, the Bantams have begun the new year with back-to-back defeats, including a 4-2 loss in Saturday's home clash with Crawley Town. Graham Alexander 's side came from behind to establish a 2-1 lead thanks to a Liam Ridehalgh effort and a Corey Addai own goal, but they ultimately conceded three late goals – including two in stoppage time – to fall to their first home defeat since November 11. The Bantams, who occupy 14th place in League Two, will be looking for a positive response when they face Derby in a competitive game for the first time since April 2004. Like their hosts, Bradford have won all four games in the EFL Trophy this season, scoring an impressive 13 goals in that period – four of which came in the previous round against Liverpool Under-21s. © Reuters Derby are unable to call upon defender Jake Rooney and forward Conor Washington due to knee and ankle problems respectively. Korey Smith and Martyn Waghorn are closing in on a return to full training, but Tuesday's contest will come too soon for the pair. Warne could be tempted to make a few changes, with Joe Wildsmith , Callum Elder and Barkhuizen all in contention to start against the Bantams. As for the visitors, they are still without the services of Alex Pattison and Jamie Walker , who are ruled out through injury. Left-back Lewis Richards is set to miss a fourth straight game with a calf problem, but he is targeting a return for Saturday's league clash with Colchester United. Having scored 12 goals across all competitions this term, experienced forward Andy Cook will provide Bradford's main goal threat in Tuesday's EFL Trophy meeting. Derby County possible starting lineup: Wildsmith; Nelson, Bradley, Cashin; Wilson, Bird, Hourihane, Forsyth; Mendez-Laing, Barkhuizen; Collins Bradford City possible starting lineup: Lewis; Tomkinson, Kelly, Platt; Halliday, Gilliead, Smallwood, Ridehalgh; Odour; Cook, Smith Although Bradford have struggled in recent league games, they have won all four games in the EFL Trophy to seal their place in the last 16. However, we think their fine run in the competition will be brought to an end by an in-form Derby side that has won four of their last five competitive matches.

Winfield dove to force a fumble by Panthers wide receiver DJ Chark before Chark could score a touchdown and had a sack that forced the Panthers to try a longer field goal that Matthew Wright missed in the second half. Those plays loomed large in a 9-0 win that made the Bucs the NFC South champs for the third straight year. Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles said “thank goodness” for Winfield’s forced fumble after the game and shared his thoughts on how Winfield can continue to make something out of being passed over for the Pro Bowl. “He can take us , just like he did,” Bowles said, via the team’s website. “Winning playoff games and Super Bowls, that’s what helps your Pro Bowl snubs.” Winfield and the Bucs will host a playoff game next weekend and that will give him a chance to continue an outstanding season in Tampa.","pubDate":"2024-01-07 23:41:02","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f082f4f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4771x2684+0+0/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F6a%2Feb8ae5fb4edb9c82dafb16927419%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1915237209","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"}]}
