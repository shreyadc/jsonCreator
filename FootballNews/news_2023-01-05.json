Amnesty International said Ronaldo‚Äôs signing is part of a ‚Äúwider pattern of sportswashing‚Äù in Saudi Arabia. The arrival of the former Real Madrid forward comes against the backdrop of a Saudi push into sports including golf, boxing, tennis and F1 as well as football, following the takeover of English Premier League club Newcastle United in 2021. The Gulf nation is also mulling a joint bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup. ‚ÄúInstead of offering uncritical praise of Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo should use his considerable public platform to draw attention to human rights issues in the country,‚Äù said Dana Ahmed, Amnesty‚Äôs Middle East researcher. ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia regularly executes people for crimes including murder, rape and drug smuggling.

I am very proud of my team because they helped each other out on the field, they were a pleasure to watch and we put in a great performance for the fans,‚Äù Inter manager Simone Inzaghi said to DAZN. Napoli top the table with 41 points after 16 games. They lead second-placed AC Milan by five points, while fourth-placed Inter are on 33 points. ‚ÄúWe can do more in terms of quality, some of our players were a little below par today,‚Äù Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti said. ‚ÄúYou are meant to move the ball side to side to pull the opposition out of shape, but that doesn‚Äôt work when you do it slowly and without the usual quality.‚Äù Inter went close after four minutes when Romelu Lukaku crossed into the box, but the angle was too narrow for DiMarco, who sent his effort wide. Lukaku then shot over after 41 minutes after being played in by a backheel from Nicolo Barella. Barella fed DiMarco in the box a minute later, but Napoli keeper Alex Meret saved his effort before the offside flag was raised. The visitors started to build momentum after Dzeko‚Äôs goal but struggled to create opportunities. ‚ÄúGames have different moments, towards the end of the first half, we went deeper and allowed Napoli more possession, but we could‚Äôve scored three goals in the first half,‚Äù Inzaghi said.

However, Jashari ‚Äì who was a surprise inclusion in Switzerland‚Äôs squad for Qatar ‚Äì insists he is only concentrating on returning to league football with his club, where he was made captain as a teenager. He said: ‚ÄúOf course, I have read all the stories about my transfers to other clubs and I am aware of all the speculation. ‚ÄúBut I am happy that I am back in training with the club. ‚ÄúFor me, my focus right now is only with Luzern so that I can prepare well for the resumption of the league system. Everything else is out of my control. ‚ÄúWith regards to any possible transfer, the timing and financial aspect of any deal would have to be right for both me and the club.‚Äù Reports in Poland also suggest Celts are leading the chase to sign Bosnian striker Said Hamulic. Hamulic has been the unexpected star of the season in the Polish league so far after netting nine goals and helping with four assists in 17 games for unfancied club Stal Mielec. The Dutch-born 22-year-old was snapped up in the summer from Lithuanian outfit Dainava and has helped his club into the European places in the Ekstraklasa. Celtic were linked with a move for Hamulic, who has made it clear he wants to play for Bosnia in the future and the club want a relatively cut-price fee of ¬£2.2 million to land him. And Stal Mielec president Jacek Klimek accepts they are set to lose their strike sensation this month. He said: ‚ÄúOur top scorer and best player, Said Hamulic, will probably leave us this winter. ‚ÄúHis transfer has not yet been agreed upon, but it will be difficult to keep him. He is already thinking about his next move. ‚ÄúWe negotiate every day with clubs and just this week, we rejected an offer from a French club. ‚ÄúWe have a set price for him of around 2.5million Euros [¬£2.2m] and the offers we have received are not far away from that. ‚ÄúRemember, we have to pay the club in Lithuania that we bought him from a sell-on fee of around 30 per cent, so our profits won‚Äôt be that big when we do sell him.‚Äù GettyReports in Poland suggest Said Hamulic of Stal Mielec is a Celtic target[/caption] Keep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page","pubDate":"2023-01-04 22:26:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"thescottishsun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Ings equaliser gives Villa share of spoils against Wolves","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-ings-equaliser-gives-villa-share-of-spoils-against-wolves","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 05, 2023 6:24 AMIngs nets 12 minutes from time to level after Daniel Podence‚Äôs skilful goal hands Wolves an early lead.","content":"BIRMINGHAM, England - Aston Villa substitute Danny Ings grabbed a late equaliser to secure a 1-1 home draw with Midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers after trailing for much of Wednesday‚Äôs Premier League tussle.

Defender Matt Doherty and Son Heung-min netted further goals for the visitors as Palace capitulated in the second half having been the better side in the opening period when the teams went to the break at 0-0. The win moves Tottenham to 33 points from their 18 matches and to within two points of fourth-placed Manchester United, though they have played a game more. Palace are in 12th position with 22 points from 17 games. After a quiet first half, Kane rose highest at the back post to head in Ivan Perisic‚Äôs cross on 48 minutes, and shortly afterwards added a second as he collected a pass from Bryan Gil, took a touch and arrowed his shot into the bottom corner to take his career Premier League goals tally to 198. ‚ÄúIt was a really important win. We have not come back (from Qatar) and got the best results. It was nice to put that performance in,‚Äù Kane told SkySports after Tottenham chalked up their first win since action in the Premier League resumed following the six-week break for the World Cup. ‚ÄúIt was about moving the ball quick, getting runs in behind and then quality in the final third. It was great to keep a clean sheet.‚Äù The win eases the pressure on Tottenham manager Antonio Conte after his Spurs side had lost four of their previous seven topflight matches, including a demoralising 2-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday that saw them booed off the pitch by their own supporters. An Eberechi Eze-inspired Palace looked the more dangerous in the first half as Jordan Ayew forced a good low save from Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and defender Joachim Andersen flashed a 25-yard shot narrowly wide of goal. Chances were few and far between for Tottenham, but Kane sent a header well wide of the goal from their best moment. They started much the brighter in the second half to change the momentum in the game and Kane‚Äôs quickfire brace was a blow from which Palace never recovered. Doherty, always looking to get forward from his wingback position, side-footed in a third to make the points safe, before Son drilled home the final goal, a relief to him after some poor form in recent games. ‚ÄúWe scored at an important time in the game,‚Äù Kane said. ‚ÄúWe have done well this season in terms of when we get one goal, a second is not too far behind. It is a really good win.‚Äù Both sides now switch focus to FA Cup third round ties as Tottenham host third-tier Portsmouth and Palace welcome Premier League rivals Southampton.

During the first quarter, Bills' safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field after tackling Bengals' wide receiver Tee Higgins. Hamlin needed CPR and an AED before he was escorted off the field in an ambulance and taken to UC Medical Center where he remains in critical condition. Bucs players, fans show support for Bills‚Äô Damar Hamlin after he collapsed during Monday‚Äôs game The Buffalo Bills later confirmed that Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest. Although his family said his condition is improving, the moment Hamlin went down will live in the minds of all that were watching ‚Äì including Bowles. \"I think it rattles you as a person, not just a player,\" Bowles said. \"A coach, a parent, a friend...just looking at the TV rattles you. As a fan in the stands...it rattles you as a person. It doesn't just rattle you as a player.\" \"Monday night, you know, something like that hadn't happened before, that was different.\" Bowles continued. \"It was heartbreaking and it still is.\" \"I have two kids that play football coming up, you know, you think about that part of it, and having played myself, we chose to play this game. It helps you appreciate the little things that you think you have going on in your life when you see something like that happen, so my heart just goes out to the family and I hope he gets better,\" Bowles said. Following Hamlin's' critical injury, fans and NFL players flooded his foundation with donations.

Born 1936 in Stepney to Rose and gangster dad Godfrey ‚ÄòGoldy‚Äô, who wound up in prison, young David was forced to flog buttons to support his struggling mum. He did this from the family home on Green Street, directly opposite West Ham‚Äôs former Boleyn Ground ‚Äì he‚Äôd later play for the youth team, and go onto buy it in 2010. Gold worked as a bricklayer before going into business with brother Ralph, spending ¬£10,000 on the Ann Summers store at London‚Äôs Marble Arch. The pair got to work transforming the run-of-the-mill sex shop into a quality lingerie and sex toy boutique worthy of the high street. Business boomed, and in 1979 Gold was joined by 19-year-old daughter Jacqueline who would go on to build the firm into one of Britain‚Äôs most iconic brands. Ann Summers grew and grew, banking millions of pounds of profits each year as it expanded into Tupperware-style parties for women. The explosion of his business came alongside ventures into the adult entertainment industry ‚Äì where he launched Gold Star Productions which ran porno mags Raider and Rustler. He joined forces with West Ham co-owner David Sullivan in 1972, later launching the Sunday Sport newspaper in 1986. The millionaire ‚Äì who could fly helicopters and planes ‚Äì also set up Gold Air International which flew the rich and famous, he sold the firm in 2004 for ¬£4.4 million. But Gold ‚Äì who drove around in a red Rolls Royce complete with a ‚ÄòD GOLD‚Äô number plate ‚Äì was never far from a controversy with his sex empire. In 2006, Muslim groups fumed at the release of a blow up sex doll called Mustafa Shag which shared a name with the Prophet Mohammed. And in 2007 when Ann Summers launched the iGasm ‚Äì which plugged into iPods ‚Äì Apple brought in the lawyers. Today Ann Summers has 145 stores across the UK and Republic of Ireland, and an annual turnover of ¬£150m. A string of celebrities, including Love Island favourites Tasha Ghouri and Megan Barton-Hanson, have since modelled for the chain. Gold would go on to embody his namesake amassing a monster ¬£500 million fortune. In an emotional statement following the tycoons Death, David Sullivan said: ‚ÄúOn behalf of everyone at the football club, it is with profound sorrow and a heavy heart that we mourn the passing of our colleague and friend, David Gold. ‚ÄúOf all our joint ventures, none gave us more pride and happiness than the day we took ownership of West Ham United, our Club, in January 2010. ‚ÄúDavid had a long-standing connection with the Hammers, having grown up opposite the Boleyn Ground in Green Street, and represented the Club at junior level. ‚ÄúHe always wanted what was best for West Ham United, and his passing is a great loss for all of us.‚Äù David Gold, who lived in Surrey, died peacefully with his daughters Jacqueline and Vanessa, and his fianc√©e Lesley, by his side.
