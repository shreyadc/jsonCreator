Nachdem im Verlauf der Rennwoche bereits fünf Tiere eingeschläfert werden mussten, sind vor dem Hauptrennen am Samstag zwei weitere Galopper auf tierärztliche Anweisung wegen Verletzungen getötet worden. Beide Pferde hatten die Verletzungen während ihrer Rennen erlitten. Der dreijährige Wallach Chloe's Dream habe einen Fehltritt gemacht und sich dabei eine Knieverletzung zugezogen, sagte Trainer Jeff Hiles der Nachrichtenagentur AP. Dies könne auch auf dem Feld und nicht nur auf der Rennstrecke passieren. \"Das ist bedauerlich. Wir müssen damit umgehen\", sagte Hiles. Das dreijährige Hengstfohlen Freezing Point wurde nach Angaben seines Trainers Joe Lejzerowicz während des Rennens von einem anderen Pferd getroffen und erlitt eine Knöchelverletzung. Beide Tiere wurden eingeschläfert. Unter den fünf toten Pferden zuvor waren zwei Galopper , die während ihrer Rennen zusammengebrochen waren und starben. Beide wurden von Saffie Joseph Jr. trainiert, der von den Organisatoren auf unbestimmte Zeit suspendiert wurde. Es sei ungewöhnlich, dass zwei Pferde aus demselben Stall unter solch mysteriösen Umständen sterben würden, sagte Wayne Pacelle, Präsident der Tierschutz-Organisation Animal Wellness Action. \"Die Art von Leuten, die etwas über den Sport wissen, finden es unglaublich ungewöhnlich, dass vier- und fünfjährige Pferde nach ihren Rennen tot umfallen\", sagte Pacelle, \"es ist so unglaublich ungewöhnlich, dass etwas dafür spricht, das der Trainer getan hat, um sie einem gewissen Risiko auszusetzen.\" Außenseiter Mage gewinnt Das Hauptrennen Kentucky Derby, wegen der Auszeichnung für den Sieger auch als \"Run for the Roses\" bekannt, ist ein Rennen für dreijährige Vollblüter über 1,25 Meilen (2012 Meter). Vor rund 150.000 Besuchern, darunter American-Football-Star Patrick Mahomes, gewann Außenseiter Mage mit Jockey Javier Castellano im Sattel die mit drei Millionen Dollar (rund 2,7 Millionen Euro) dotierte die 149.

Kermit Erasmus opened the scoring for Bucs, while Yusuf Maart equalised for Chiefs to take the game to extra-time.

Even if it was another team, we were still going to celebrate, but for us, it was not a celebration, to be honest, it was an ‘okay bring it on’,” the Chiefs coach explained during a post-match press-conference. “Obviously it’s one of the big games in the South African football calendar and if you play against your direct rivals you always want to get the best out of the players. And the players as well see this as anopportunity to showcase their talents.” Zwane further explained that playing in the Soweto derby isbig and it might be another reason his players were happy with facing Pirates.

After fetching about K36 million in the first week’s eight matches, gate revenue has dropped to about K28 million in the third week. During the league’s opening match between Silver Strikers and FCB Nyasa Bullets, revenue totalled K20 585 830 while the match between Mighty Mukuru Wanderers and Civil Service at Kamuzu Stadium grossed K8 966 100. But this is way below last season’s revenue when the match between Silver and Bullets at Silver Stadium grossed about K25 million while the Wanderers and Civo game at Kamuzu Stadium made K15 million. The other six matches in the the first week made less than K700 000 each. Moyale and Karonga United at Mzuzu Stadium grossed K680 900, Mighty Tigers and Extreme at Mpira Stadium (K563 000); Mafco and Chitipa United at Chitowe Stadium (K118 750); Blue Eagles and Red Lions at Nankhaka (K370 000); Ekwendeni Hammers and Kamuzu Barracks at Mzuzu Stadium (K134 4000) grossed not more than K700 000. In other words, with open stands tickets at K2 000, the patronage at these matches was less than. In week two, Karonga United and Chitipa United at Karonga Stadium grossed K3 213 600; Bangwe All Stars and Mighty Tigers at Mpira Stadium (K2 301 050); Civo and Extreme at Civo Stadium (K631 600); Ekwendeni Hammers and Moyale at Mzuzu Stadium (K645 000). Whereas the matches between Red Lions and Mighty Mukuru Wanderers at Balaka Stadium grossed K7 467 000 Blue Eagles and Silver at Nankhaka made K4 590 100; Bullets and Mafco at Kamuzu Stadium grossed K14 146 480. This also shows a drop in revenue in matches of crowd-pullers Bullets, Silver and Wanderers. It was the same in week three as matches between Bullets and Extreme at Civo Stadium (K11 762 200), Wanderers and Ekwendeni Hammers at Kamuzu Stadium (K8 150 750) fetched less than what the Blantyre giants fetched in the first two weeks. Matches between Chitipa United and Dedza Dynamos at Karonga (K1 473 400); Bangwe All Stars and Blue Eagles at Mulanje Park (K1 697 000); Silver and Red Lions at Bingu National Stadium (K5 025 720) fetched over K1 million. But Mafco against Karonga United at Chitowe (K240 050), Kamuzu Barracks and Moyale Barracks at Civo Stadium (K93 950), Mighty Tigers and Civo at Mpira Stadium (K675 200) grossed less that K700 000. Super League of Malawi (Sulom) general secretary Williams Banda admitted that low patronage is a challenge but that there are several factors that affected the revenue such as the Fifa+ live streaming platform. However, analysts have warned that as long as football administrators fail to bring in other elements of entertainment, football will keep on losing fans. Soccer analyst Patrick Zgambo observed that the standards of the game have contributed to the poor patronage. He said: “Overall, I think exposure to top leagues especially English Premiership through television, has exposed Malawians to high expectations in terms of standards of football and they are not impressed when they watch the local match. “A local football fan will still hold his allegiance to their local club, but he is more invested in the EPL because it is a better product and that’s what is more interesting. “The EPL has become a monster and has not only hurt the local game, but even European leagues like La Liga, Bundesliga are unable to compete as it has dominated interest of the global football.” Zgambo said football officials need to find means of addressing the situation to bring back the crowds. He sa id: “Malawi football must find a sustainable solution because the crowds will not return at a flip of a switch. They have to creatively stimulate interest of young people to get to the stadium. The older geriatrics who believed in a stadium atmosphere for a good old fashioned derby are dying off. Someone has to replace them in the stadia.” On his part, Kelvin Moyo said low patronage is also related to the generals etup at matches. He said: “Football should acknowledge that as an industry, competition in terms of entertainment is now high. Other entertaining industries such as live music, have raised the bar in offering far much better ser vices than football.” Moyo explained that football administrators should eat humble pie and adapt to the present situation. The anal yst sa i d : “Football has taken things for granted for so long. You should observe the crowd that is outside the stadium where booze, food etc is sold. “That is the part of entertainment that we are missing within the confines of the stadium. Let’s regulate some of these things and create an entertaining environment for our fans.” Moyo said football has also failed to provide entertainment suited for the millennials. He said: “What the older generation used to like cannot be equated to the present generation. Football has failed to look at the needs of the present younger g e n e r a t i o n . T h e r e is need to offer a fan zone to the fans at our football grounds suited for millennials. A part from a match that will be played at 14.30, there is no entertainment at the venue, the atmosphere is very boring.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 08:38:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"mwnation","category":["sports"],"country":["malawi"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tonga boss Kristian Woolf wants Test against St Helens’ Jonny Lomax","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/22278667/england-tonga-kristian-woolf-st-helens-jonny-lomax/","keywords":["Rugby League","Sport","England rugby league team","Rugby Football League","St Helens"],"creator":["Gary Carter"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"KRISTIAN Woolf hopes to face the ‘best he has ever worked with’ if Jonny Lomax makes England’s Test series against Tonga. The former St Helens chief will lead the Pacific nation – now a rugby league powerhouse – in a history-making three encounters in the Autumn. And he would love nothing more than testing himself against the man he believes is the standout, if national boss Shaun Wane picks him. Woolf said: “I’d like to see Jonny play. I had three great years working with him. The Saints guys are a great group but Jonny’s at the forefront of that. “There aren’t many players I’ve worked with that work harder than Jonny. He’s had massive things to get over in his career – including a brain injury - but he’s got through all that and plays at the level he does. “I’d go as far as saying I’ve never worked with a player who prepares as well as he does. You see in his performances it means something to him and playing for St Helens means something to him. “And I know if Jonny puts his hand up, he'll be a very influential player.” Woolf and Tonga stepped up after New Zealand’s series fell through, meaning it is the first time a Pacific nation will play a full tour against England. The island reached the World Cup semi-finals in 2017 and defeated Great Britain and Australia in 2019 Tests – but they under-performed in last year’s tournament. It can also help the development of the international game after he consulted former England boss, now his senior at NRL side Dolphins, Wayne Bennett. He added: “We were disappointed last year. We had a more talented squad than in 2019 but we didn’t reach our potential. We want to make amends. “The vast majority of players were very keen to get over to the UK and this is a really exciting opportunity. It’s a bit of a ‘grow up’ moment for us. “Hopefully, it rekindles that feeling for Test rugby. The fact we play three Tests, rather than just one, only adds to the excitement. “When we were tossing up the idea, I spoke to Wayne and he was extremely supportive. “He saw the positives and the strengths in terms of what it does for Tonga and international rugby league. He thought it was the way we should go.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 08:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lampard delighted with “first step” after Chelsea end winless run","link":"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/597100-lampard-delighted-with-first-step-after-chelsea-end-winless-run.html","keywords":["Football","chelsea","English Premier League (EPL)","frank lampard","lampard","Premier League"],"creator":["Agency Report"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chelsea are still 11th in the Premier League with four games left.

The former English Premier League (EPL) champions snapped a nine-match winless run in all competitions with a 3-1 victory at Bournemouth on Saturday. Chelsea have looked like a fractured outfit after a number of arrivals in the last two transfer windows and three different managers this season. But they showed glimpses of finally gelling together as a unit to end a six-match losing run. Chelsea are still 11th in the Premier League with four games left. But Lampard said the win would be a boost as they look to end the season on a high after just their second away victory of the year. “I’m happy. We came in off the back of a tough run. It’s been a tough year and there is a lot of work to do,” he told reporters. “But the performance and the result in isolation are really good, we deserved to win the game. “It’s a nice step forward for the lads. To work hard and come to a place that has been very hard for a lot of teams this year… I’m very happy. “In the modern game, those changes are huge. It’s important with the squad that we have that people feel like they can come in and affect the game. “We’ve worked towards that and I think every one of them did.” Lampard said there were still a lot of players finding their feet, especially youngsters, and urged them to “grasp” confidence from the performance. “Typically at Chelsea, one or two have fed into the group and now we have more. It’s understandable that as a group finding rhythm and confidence can be difficult,” the former Chelsea player added. “This is a first step. It won’t be plain sailing, but there is talent there and the players need to come together to get us to where we want to be.” Chelsea’s next game is at home against relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest next weekend. But tougher tests await with their last three games of the season against top-four sides Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United.

Shaw captured her first award at Friday’s Concacaf Awards after a season where she helped the Reggae Girlz to qualify for their second consecutive Women’s World Cup as well as played a role in Manchester City’s League Cup triumph. Canada’s Alphonso Davies won the Concacaf Men’s Player-of-the-Year award for the second consecutive year. Shaw, who was a finalist in 2018, became the first player from the Caribbean to win the award, an honour she dedicated to her teammates. “It is an unbelievable feeling to be named Concacaf Women’s Player of the Year. But I could not have done it without my teammates because they have played a massive part in this. I wish everyone could have this,” Shaw told the Manchester City Club website. Last June, Shaw scored three goals in the Concacaf Women’s Championship and was named to the team of the tournament. Domestically, she scored 26 goals in all competitions in 2022, helping City to the Continental Cup that year. Of those 26 goals in 2022, she scored 15 in 19 league matches. This season she is currently leading the golden boot race with 18 goals and Manchester City are now in second place in the table with 44 points, three points behind leaders Manchester United. Shaw said she hoped that others would be motivated to stay the course in their own journey with continued hard work and belief. “The message I have to anybody who has a dream like I did is to keep believing and enjoy the process and journey,” Shaw said. “The journey is ultimately what is going to get you to your destination, so just work hard every day, knowing where you want to get to and no matter what obstacles come your way, you need to keep believing in yourself and doing your best.” Jamaica Football Federation president Michael Ricketts congratulated Shaw on the honour, recognising her trailblazing efforts for the women’s game in Jamaica. “In winning this award, Khadija has enhanced brand Jamaica, but even more so, has offered immense hope to countless young Jamaican female footballers,” Ricketts said in a statement released yesterday. “From playing in the streets of Spanish Town to St Jago High School, to club, to the national team, to college and the professional ranks, she has not only paved the football pathway but has shown the qualities that breed success.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 06:48:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicagleaner","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Building a legacy","link":"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/sports/20230507/building-legacy","keywords":null,"creator":["Lester Hinds - Gleaner Writer"],"video_url":null,"description":"PORTLANDERS FOOTBALL Club is on a mission – not just to invest in young men but to build the kind of football legacy that will be replicated and put Jamaica on the football map in a big way.

The club, formerly known as St George’s Football Club, based in Buff Bay, Portland, currently encompasses almost the entire parish of Portland, while also attracting boys from parts of St Mary, a neighbouring parish. Currently, Portlanders Football Club is a franchise of the Jamaica Football Federation and has teams competing at various levels. The club has teams playing at Tier II Premier level, under-20, under-17 and under-13 teams. St George’s Football Club was taken over and incorporated in July 2018 by Dr Kingsley Chin, a board certified spinal surgeon, who lives in the United States but hails from Buff Bay and attended Titchfield High School. In September 2018, he changed the name to Portlanders Football Club because of the vision to make it a parish-wide club. Since taking over the club and changing its name to Portlanders Football Club, Dr Chin has poured resources into the team. KIC Ventures, a US-based company, of which Dr Chin is founder and chief executive officer, has reportedly already invested some $20 million in the teams. He has purchased a team bus to take the players to games across the island, provided all necessary gear and ensured that the members of the teams are provided for nutrition-wise. He has also upgraded the Lynch Park in Portland where the teams train and put management structures in place to ensure that the team can function independently of him. Dr Chin played football for Titchfield and represented Jamaica. He was given a football scholarship which took him to Columbia University in New York where he played collegiate football. He also attended Harvard Medical School where he became a doctor. “I remember running about playing football barefooted and football is what took me to the United States. I owe everything I have become to football,” he told . “My dream is to build a full football academy in Portland,” he said. Dr Chin says he is giving back to Jamaica in this way because through football a start can be made to reclaim boys from the streets, who may potentially fall into a life of crime. He urges others in the diaspora, who can get involved in sports in Jamaica to do so, as this is another tangible way of giving back to the country. “I believe that young men need male role models and football can provide such role models. I know when I played football for the parish at age 12, I looked up to the senior players with whom I came into contact. They became my role models and I believe that this can work for our young men today,” he said. He envisions several of the players on Portlanders Football Club representing Jamaica or getting scholarships that could change their lives. Portlanders Football Club have also entered into an unofficial agreement with Titchfield High through which young players from the club can join the school’s football programme. Dr Chin paid tribute to Raymond Munzie Gordon as coach, Colin Mattis, the field manager, Brian Davis, assistant coach and player recruitment, and Leslie Phillips, transportation and food manager for their work in helping to develop and shape Portlanders Football Club. Delano Smith, a 26-year-old member of the senior team that competes in the Tier II competition, said that he became involved with the team because of his brother, who was also a member. “Right now we are rebuilding the team because some of the players who were in the team have left. What the management is trying to do is instilling discipline and putting into place structures and some people are resentful of the discipline,” he said. Smith said that the club is being built around young players and he likes the atmosphere surrounding the team. “I like the atmosphere. I like the team spirit being developed. We lost about 14 players but we are rebuilding. It is not an easy road, but we hope to make Portlanders Football Club a name in football in Jamaica,” he said. According to Smith, the team is looking to be in the top four of the competition. Junior Linder, a member of the under-20 team, who also spoke with , said he joined the club because he likes the direction in which it is going. “I believe that if we continue as we are going, very soon we will have a great team representing the parish,” he said. Linder said the club is building the kind of team spirit that will take it far in the future. “We are developing as a team although we come from different parts of the parish. We have one goal and that is to make the club a success. We want to win and we can do so if we play as a team and do all the things that it takes to win,” said Linder. According to Portlanders manager, Blake Brown, the club is the premier footballing organisation in the parish. “We have teams from under 13 through to a senior team. Our senior team will be competing in the national Tier II competition which starts next week, April 22. “At Portlanders, we emphasise true leadership at all levels on and off the field. It is with great humility that we are the standard-bearers for the great parish of Portland. I’m certain that we will continue our contribution to the development of football at the parish level and beyond,” said Brown. According to Brown, since the club had been taken over by Dr Chin, the programme had been growing and all the necessary pieces for a successful programme were being put in place. “We are on the right track and we will be making our mark on football in Jamaica.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 06:44:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicagleaner","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ASSE – Mercato : un jeune buteur de l'OM dans le viseur","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/mercato/asse-mercato-une-promesse-de-lom-dans-le-viseur-817182","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"En fin de contrat à l'OM, Lionnel Lukoki (18 ans) intéresse l'ASSE.","content":"S'il est aujourd'hui meilleur buteur de l'équipe U19, Lionnel Lukoki (18 ans) fait partie de la liste des 46 joueurs que l'OM ne conservera pas dans son centre de formation au 1er juillet prochain.

Diamantakos, who joined Kerala Blasters FC in 2022, had a memorable campaign in the ISL 2022-23 season. He ended the season as the club’s top scorer, scoring 12 goals while chipping in with three assists. His contributions were vital as Kerala Blasters FC qualified for the ISL playoffs in consecutive seasons, a first in the club’s history. The Blasters saw their campaign come to an end after going down to Bengaluru FC in a one-legged knockout playoffs fixture. However, Diamantakos was confident of the club bouncing back and spoke about their target of winning the League Shield next season. “I must say that it was a good season for me as I scored some goals, but it didn’t help the team achieve our goals and I hope that next season we win the (League) Shield because that is our target. And I hope that I score more goals and help the team more,” Diamantakos said in an interview with the club. With 12 goal contributions, Diamantakos was the leading goal contributor for Kerala Blasters FC in ISL 2022-23. His tally of goals was just two short of Odisha FC’s Diego Mauricio, who emerged as the Golden Boot winner during the ISL 2022-2023 season. Diamantakos credited the players and coaching staff for his performances while also highlighting his partnership with midfielder Adrian Luna. “We are one really good group. All the players are really good. But the one that helped me the most and I think he needs to take most of the credit because he gave me the most assists, is Adrian Luna,” the Greek striker said. “But all the players helped me and the coaches developed my football and helped me play my best football,” he added. Thanks to his goalscoring exploits, Diamantakos developed a reputation as a fan favourite among the Kerala Blasters FC faithful. The 30-year-old striker acknowledged the support from the fans during good and difficult situations. “I have a lot of good moments because, after every game we played in our stadium when we finished the game, we saw the crowd celebrate together after every win and even after the losses. They are always there and make everything better for us and support us a lot,” Diamantakos expressed.

Nachdem im Verlauf der Rennwoche bereits fünf Tiere eingeschläfert werden mussten, sind vor dem Hauptrennen am Samstag zwei weitere Galopper auf tierärztliche Anweisung wegen Verletzungen getötet worden. Beide Pferde hatten die Verletzungen während ihrer Rennen erlitten. Der dreijährige Wallach Chloe's Dream habe einen Fehltritt gemacht und sich dabei eine Knieverletzung zugezogen, sagte Trainer Jeff Hiles der Nachrichtenagentur AP. Dies könne auch auf dem Feld und nicht nur auf der Rennstrecke passieren. \"Das ist bedauerlich. Wir müssen damit umgehen\", sagte Hiles. Das dreijährige Hengstfohlen Freezing Point wurde nach Angaben seines Trainers Joe Lejzerowicz während des Rennens von einem anderen Pferd getroffen und erlitt eine Knöchelverletzung. Beide Tiere wurden eingeschläfert. Unter den fünf toten Pferden zuvor waren zwei Galopper , die während ihrer Rennen zusammengebrochen waren und starben. Beide wurden von Saffie Joseph Jr. trainiert, der von den Organisatoren auf unbestimmte Zeit suspendiert wurde. Es sei ungewöhnlich, dass zwei Pferde aus demselben Stall unter solch mysteriösen Umständen sterben würden, sagte Wayne Pacelle, Präsident der Tierschutz-Organisation Animal Wellness Action. \"Die Art von Leuten, die etwas über den Sport wissen, finden es unglaublich ungewöhnlich, dass vier- und fünfjährige Pferde nach ihren Rennen tot umfallen\", sagte Pacelle, \"es ist so unglaublich ungewöhnlich, dass etwas dafür spricht, das der Trainer getan hat, um sie einem gewissen Risiko auszusetzen.\" Außenseiter Mage gewinnt Das Hauptrennen Kentucky Derby, wegen der Auszeichnung für den Sieger auch als \"Run for the Roses\" bekannt, ist ein Rennen für dreijährige Vollblüter über 1,25 Meilen (2012 Meter).

Even if it was another team, we were still going to celebrate, but for us, it was not a celebration, to be honest, it was an ‘okay bring it on’,” the Chiefs coach explained during a post-match press-conference. “Obviously it’s one of the big games in the South African football calendar and if you play against your direct rivals you always want to get the best out of the players. And the players as well see this as anopportunity to showcase their talents.” Zwane further explained that playing in the Soweto derby isbig and it might be another reason his players were happy with facing Pirates.

After fetching about K36 million in the first week’s eight matches, gate revenue has dropped to about K28 million in the third week. During the league’s opening match between Silver Strikers and FCB Nyasa Bullets, revenue totalled K20 585 830 while the match between Mighty Mukuru Wanderers and Civil Service at Kamuzu Stadium grossed K8 966 100. But this is way below last season’s revenue when the match between Silver and Bullets at Silver Stadium grossed about K25 million while the Wanderers and Civo game at Kamuzu Stadium made K15 million. The other six matches in the the first week made less than K700 000 each. Moyale and Karonga United at Mzuzu Stadium grossed K680 900, Mighty Tigers and Extreme at Mpira Stadium (K563 000); Mafco and Chitipa United at Chitowe Stadium (K118 750); Blue Eagles and Red Lions at Nankhaka (K370 000); Ekwendeni Hammers and Kamuzu Barracks at Mzuzu Stadium (K134 4000) grossed not more than K700 000. In other words, with open stands tickets at K2 000, the patronage at these matches was less than. In week two, Karonga United and Chitipa United at Karonga Stadium grossed K3 213 600; Bangwe All Stars and Mighty Tigers at Mpira Stadium (K2 301 050); Civo and Extreme at Civo Stadium (K631 600); Ekwendeni Hammers and Moyale at Mzuzu Stadium (K645 000). Whereas the matches between Red Lions and Mighty Mukuru Wanderers at Balaka Stadium grossed K7 467 000 Blue Eagles and Silver at Nankhaka made K4 590 100; Bullets and Mafco at Kamuzu Stadium grossed K14 146 480. This also shows a drop in revenue in matches of crowd-pullers Bullets, Silver and Wanderers. It was the same in week three as matches between Bullets and Extreme at Civo Stadium (K11 762 200), Wanderers and Ekwendeni Hammers at Kamuzu Stadium (K8 150 750) fetched less than what the Blantyre giants fetched in the first two weeks. Matches between Chitipa United and Dedza Dynamos at Karonga (K1 473 400); Bangwe All Stars and Blue Eagles at Mulanje Park (K1 697 000); Silver and Red Lions at Bingu National Stadium (K5 025 720) fetched over K1 million. But Mafco against Karonga United at Chitowe (K240 050), Kamuzu Barracks and Moyale Barracks at Civo Stadium (K93 950), Mighty Tigers and Civo at Mpira Stadium (K675 200) grossed less that K700 000. Super League of Malawi (Sulom) general secretary Williams Banda admitted that low patronage is a challenge but that there are several factors that affected the revenue such as the Fifa+ live streaming platform. However, analysts have warned that as long as football administrators fail to bring in other elements of entertainment, football will keep on losing fans. Soccer analyst Patrick Zgambo observed that the standards of the game have contributed to the poor patronage. He said: “Overall, I think exposure to top leagues especially English Premiership through television, has exposed Malawians to high expectations in terms of standards of football and they are not impressed when they watch the local match. “A local football fan will still hold his allegiance to their local club, but he is more invested in the EPL because it is a better product and that’s what is more interesting. “The EPL has become a monster and has not only hurt the local game, but even European leagues like La Liga, Bundesliga are unable to compete as it has dominated interest of the global football.” Zgambo said football officials need to find means of addressing the situation to bring back the crowds. He sa id: “Malawi football must find a sustainable solution because the crowds will not return at a flip of a switch. They have to creatively stimulate interest of young people to get to the stadium. The older geriatrics who believed in a stadium atmosphere for a good old fashioned derby are dying off. Someone has to replace them in the stadia.” On his part, Kelvin Moyo said low patronage is also related to the generals etup at matches. He said: “Football should acknowledge that as an industry, competition in terms of entertainment is now high. Other entertaining industries such as live music, have raised the bar in offering far much better ser vices than football.” Moyo explained that football administrators should eat humble pie and adapt to the present situation. The anal yst sa i d : “Football has taken things for granted for so long. You should observe the crowd that is outside the stadium where booze, food etc is sold. “That is the part of entertainment that we are missing within the confines of the stadium. Let’s regulate some of these things and create an entertaining environment for our fans.” Moyo said football has also failed to provide entertainment suited for the millennials. He said: “What the older generation used to like cannot be equated to the present generation. Football has failed to look at the needs of the present younger g e n e r a t i o n . T h e r e is need to offer a fan zone to the fans at our football grounds suited for millennials. A part from a match that will be played at 14.30, there is no entertainment at the venue, the atmosphere is very boring.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 08:38:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"mwnation","category":["sports"],"country":["malawi"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tonga boss Kristian Woolf wants Test against St Helens’ Jonny Lomax","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/22278667/england-tonga-kristian-woolf-st-helens-jonny-lomax/","keywords":["Rugby League","Sport","England rugby league team","Rugby Football League","St Helens"],"creator":["Gary Carter"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"KRISTIAN Woolf hopes to face the ‘best he has ever worked with’ if Jonny Lomax makes England’s Test series against Tonga. The former St Helens chief will lead the Pacific nation – now a rugby league powerhouse – in a history-making three encounters in the Autumn. And he would love nothing more than testing himself against the man he believes is the standout, if national boss Shaun Wane picks him. Woolf said: “I’d like to see Jonny play. I had three great years working with him. The Saints guys are a great group but Jonny’s at the forefront of that. “There aren’t many players I’ve worked with that work harder than Jonny. He’s had massive things to get over in his career – including a brain injury - but he’s got through all that and plays at the level he does. “I’d go as far as saying I’ve never worked with a player who prepares as well as he does. You see in his performances it means something to him and playing for St Helens means something to him. “And I know if Jonny puts his hand up, he'll be a very influential player.” Woolf and Tonga stepped up after New Zealand’s series fell through, meaning it is the first time a Pacific nation will play a full tour against England. The island reached the World Cup semi-finals in 2017 and defeated Great Britain and Australia in 2019 Tests – but they under-performed in last year’s tournament. It can also help the development of the international game after he consulted former England boss, now his senior at NRL side Dolphins, Wayne Bennett. He added: “We were disappointed last year. We had a more talented squad than in 2019 but we didn’t reach our potential. We want to make amends. “The vast majority of players were very keen to get over to the UK and this is a really exciting opportunity. It’s a bit of a ‘grow up’ moment for us. “Hopefully, it rekindles that feeling for Test rugby. The fact we play three Tests, rather than just one, only adds to the excitement. “When we were tossing up the idea, I spoke to Wayne and he was extremely supportive. “He saw the positives and the strengths in terms of what it does for Tonga and international rugby league. He thought it was the way we should go.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 08:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lampard delighted with “first step” after Chelsea end winless run","link":"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/597100-lampard-delighted-with-first-step-after-chelsea-end-winless-run.html","keywords":["Football","chelsea","English Premier League (EPL)","frank lampard","lampard","Premier League"],"creator":["Agency Report"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chelsea are still 11th in the Premier League with four games left.

The former English Premier League (EPL) champions snapped a nine-match winless run in all competitions with a 3-1 victory at Bournemouth on Saturday. Chelsea have looked like a fractured outfit after a number of arrivals in the last two transfer windows and three different managers this season. But they showed glimpses of finally gelling together as a unit to end a six-match losing run. Chelsea are still 11th in the Premier League with four games left. But Lampard said the win would be a boost as they look to end the season on a high after just their second away victory of the year. “I’m happy. We came in off the back of a tough run. It’s been a tough year and there is a lot of work to do,” he told reporters. “But the performance and the result in isolation are really good, we deserved to win the game. “It’s a nice step forward for the lads. To work hard and come to a place that has been very hard for a lot of teams this year… I’m very happy. “In the modern game, those changes are huge. It’s important with the squad that we have that people feel like they can come in and affect the game. “We’ve worked towards that and I think every one of them did.” Lampard said there were still a lot of players finding their feet, especially youngsters, and urged them to “grasp” confidence from the performance. “Typically at Chelsea, one or two have fed into the group and now we have more. It’s understandable that as a group finding rhythm and confidence can be difficult,” the former Chelsea player added. “This is a first step. It won’t be plain sailing, but there is talent there and the players need to come together to get us to where we want to be.” Chelsea’s next game is at home against relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest next weekend. But tougher tests await with their last three games of the season against top-four sides Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United.

Shaw captured her first award at Friday’s Concacaf Awards after a season where she helped the Reggae Girlz to qualify for their second consecutive Women’s World Cup as well as played a role in Manchester City’s League Cup triumph. Canada’s Alphonso Davies won the Concacaf Men’s Player-of-the-Year award for the second consecutive year. Shaw, who was a finalist in 2018, became the first player from the Caribbean to win the award, an honour she dedicated to her teammates. “It is an unbelievable feeling to be named Concacaf Women’s Player of the Year. But I could not have done it without my teammates because they have played a massive part in this. I wish everyone could have this,” Shaw told the Manchester City Club website. Last June, Shaw scored three goals in the Concacaf Women’s Championship and was named to the team of the tournament. Domestically, she scored 26 goals in all competitions in 2022, helping City to the Continental Cup that year. Of those 26 goals in 2022, she scored 15 in 19 league matches. This season she is currently leading the golden boot race with 18 goals and Manchester City are now in second place in the table with 44 points, three points behind leaders Manchester United. Shaw said she hoped that others would be motivated to stay the course in their own journey with continued hard work and belief. “The message I have to anybody who has a dream like I did is to keep believing and enjoy the process and journey,” Shaw said. “The journey is ultimately what is going to get you to your destination, so just work hard every day, knowing where you want to get to and no matter what obstacles come your way, you need to keep believing in yourself and doing your best.” Jamaica Football Federation president Michael Ricketts congratulated Shaw on the honour, recognising her trailblazing efforts for the women’s game in Jamaica. “In winning this award, Khadija has enhanced brand Jamaica, but even more so, has offered immense hope to countless young Jamaican female footballers,” Ricketts said in a statement released yesterday. “From playing in the streets of Spanish Town to St Jago High School, to club, to the national team, to college and the professional ranks, she has not only paved the football pathway but has shown the qualities that breed success.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 06:48:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicagleaner","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Building a legacy","link":"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/sports/20230507/building-legacy","keywords":null,"creator":["Lester Hinds - Gleaner Writer"],"video_url":null,"description":"PORTLANDERS FOOTBALL Club is on a mission – not just to invest in young men but to build the kind of football legacy that will be replicated and put Jamaica on the football map in a big way.

The club, formerly known as St George’s Football Club, based in Buff Bay, Portland, currently encompasses almost the entire parish of Portland, while also attracting boys from parts of St Mary, a neighbouring parish. Currently, Portlanders Football Club is a franchise of the Jamaica Football Federation and has teams competing at various levels. The club has teams playing at Tier II Premier level, under-20, under-17 and under-13 teams. St George’s Football Club was taken over and incorporated in July 2018 by Dr Kingsley Chin, a board certified spinal surgeon, who lives in the United States but hails from Buff Bay and attended Titchfield High School. In September 2018, he changed the name to Portlanders Football Club because of the vision to make it a parish-wide club. Since taking over the club and changing its name to Portlanders Football Club, Dr Chin has poured resources into the team. KIC Ventures, a US-based company, of which Dr Chin is founder and chief executive officer, has reportedly already invested some $20 million in the teams. He has purchased a team bus to take the players to games across the island, provided all necessary gear and ensured that the members of the teams are provided for nutrition-wise. He has also upgraded the Lynch Park in Portland where the teams train and put management structures in place to ensure that the team can function independently of him. Dr Chin played football for Titchfield and represented Jamaica. He was given a football scholarship which took him to Columbia University in New York where he played collegiate football. He also attended Harvard Medical School where he became a doctor. “I remember running about playing football barefooted and football is what took me to the United States. I owe everything I have become to football,” he told . “My dream is to build a full football academy in Portland,” he said. Dr Chin says he is giving back to Jamaica in this way because through football a start can be made to reclaim boys from the streets, who may potentially fall into a life of crime. He urges others in the diaspora, who can get involved in sports in Jamaica to do so, as this is another tangible way of giving back to the country. “I believe that young men need male role models and football can provide such role models. I know when I played football for the parish at age 12, I looked up to the senior players with whom I came into contact. They became my role models and I believe that this can work for our young men today,” he said. He envisions several of the players on Portlanders Football Club representing Jamaica or getting scholarships that could change their lives. Portlanders Football Club have also entered into an unofficial agreement with Titchfield High through which young players from the club can join the school’s football programme. Dr Chin paid tribute to Raymond Munzie Gordon as coach, Colin Mattis, the field manager, Brian Davis, assistant coach and player recruitment, and Leslie Phillips, transportation and food manager for their work in helping to develop and shape Portlanders Football Club. Delano Smith, a 26-year-old member of the senior team that competes in the Tier II competition, said that he became involved with the team because of his brother, who was also a member. “Right now we are rebuilding the team because some of the players who were in the team have left. What the management is trying to do is instilling discipline and putting into place structures and some people are resentful of the discipline,” he said. Smith said that the club is being built around young players and he likes the atmosphere surrounding the team. “I like the atmosphere. I like the team spirit being developed. We lost about 14 players but we are rebuilding. It is not an easy road, but we hope to make Portlanders Football Club a name in football in Jamaica,” he said. According to Smith, the team is looking to be in the top four of the competition. Junior Linder, a member of the under-20 team, who also spoke with , said he joined the club because he likes the direction in which it is going. “I believe that if we continue as we are going, very soon we will have a great team representing the parish,” he said. Linder said the club is building the kind of team spirit that will take it far in the future. “We are developing as a team although we come from different parts of the parish. We have one goal and that is to make the club a success. We want to win and we can do so if we play as a team and do all the things that it takes to win,” said Linder. According to Portlanders manager, Blake Brown, the club is the premier footballing organisation in the parish. “We have teams from under 13 through to a senior team. Our senior team will be competing in the national Tier II competition which starts next week, April 22. “At Portlanders, we emphasise true leadership at all levels on and off the field. It is with great humility that we are the standard-bearers for the great parish of Portland. I’m certain that we will continue our contribution to the development of football at the parish level and beyond,” said Brown. According to Brown, since the club had been taken over by Dr Chin, the programme had been growing and all the necessary pieces for a successful programme were being put in place. “We are on the right track and we will be making our mark on football in Jamaica.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 06:44:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicagleaner","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ASSE – Mercato : un jeune buteur de l'OM dans le viseur","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/mercato/asse-mercato-une-promesse-de-lom-dans-le-viseur-817182","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"En fin de contrat à l'OM, Lionnel Lukoki (18 ans) intéresse l'ASSE.","content":"S'il est aujourd'hui meilleur buteur de l'équipe U19, Lionnel Lukoki (18 ans) fait partie de la liste des 46 joueurs que l'OM ne conservera pas dans son centre de formation au 1er juillet prochain.

Diamantakos, who joined Kerala Blasters FC in 2022, had a memorable campaign in the ISL 2022-23 season. He ended the season as the club’s top scorer, scoring 12 goals while chipping in with three assists. His contributions were vital as Kerala Blasters FC qualified for the ISL playoffs in consecutive seasons, a first in the club’s history. The Blasters saw their campaign come to an end after going down to Bengaluru FC in a one-legged knockout playoffs fixture. However, Diamantakos was confident of the club bouncing back and spoke about their target of winning the League Shield next season. “I must say that it was a good season for me as I scored some goals, but it didn’t help the team achieve our goals and I hope that next season we win the (League) Shield because that is our target. And I hope that I score more goals and help the team more,” Diamantakos said in an interview with the club. With 12 goal contributions, Diamantakos was the leading goal contributor for Kerala Blasters FC in ISL 2022-23. His tally of goals was just two short of Odisha FC’s Diego Mauricio, who emerged as the Golden Boot winner during the ISL 2022-2023 season. Diamantakos credited the players and coaching staff for his performances while also highlighting his partnership with midfielder Adrian Luna. “We are one really good group. All the players are really good. But the one that helped me the most and I think he needs to take most of the credit because he gave me the most assists, is Adrian Luna,” the Greek striker said. “But all the players helped me and the coaches developed my football and helped me play my best football,” he added. Thanks to his goalscoring exploits, Diamantakos developed a reputation as a fan favourite among the Kerala Blasters FC faithful. The 30-year-old striker acknowledged the support from the fans during good and difficult situations. “I have a lot of good moments because, after every game we played in our stadium when we finished the game, we saw the crowd celebrate together after every win and even after the losses. They are always there and make everything better for us and support us a lot,” Diamantakos expressed.

Das dreijährige Hengstfohlen Freezing Point wurde nach Angaben seines Trainers Joe Lejzerowicz während des Rennens von einem anderen Pferd getroffen und erlitt eine Knöchelverletzung. Beide Tiere wurden eingeschläfert. Unter den fünf toten Pferden zuvor waren zwei Galopper , die während ihrer Rennen zusammengebrochen waren und starben. Beide wurden von Saffie Joseph Jr. trainiert, der von den Organisatoren auf unbestimmte Zeit suspendiert wurde. Es sei ungewöhnlich, dass zwei Pferde aus demselben Stall unter solch mysteriösen Umständen sterben würden, sagte Wayne Pacelle, Präsident der Tierschutz-Organisation Animal Wellness Action. \"Die Art von Leuten, die etwas über den Sport wissen, finden es unglaublich ungewöhnlich, dass vier- und fünfjährige Pferde nach ihren Rennen tot umfallen\", sagte Pacelle, \"es ist so unglaublich ungewöhnlich, dass etwas dafür spricht, das der Trainer getan hat, um sie einem gewissen Risiko auszusetzen.\" Außenseiter Mage gewinnt Das Hauptrennen Kentucky Derby, wegen der Auszeichnung für den Sieger auch als \"Run for the Roses\" bekannt, ist ein Rennen für dreijährige Vollblüter über 1,25 Meilen (2012 Meter).

Kermit Erasmus opened the scoring for Bucs, while Yusuf Maart equalised for Chiefs to take the game to extra-time.

Even if it was another team, we were still going to celebrate, but for us, it was not a celebration, to be honest, it was an ‘okay bring it on’,” the Chiefs coach explained during a post-match press-conference. “Obviously it’s one of the big games in the South African football calendar and if you play against your direct rivals you always want to get the best out of the players. And the players as well see this as anopportunity to showcase their talents.” Zwane further explained that playing in the Soweto derby isbig and it might be another reason his players were happy with facing Pirates.

After fetching about K36 million in the first week’s eight matches, gate revenue has dropped to about K28 million in the third week. During the league’s opening match between Silver Strikers and FCB Nyasa Bullets, revenue totalled K20 585 830 while the match between Mighty Mukuru Wanderers and Civil Service at Kamuzu Stadium grossed K8 966 100. But this is way below last season’s revenue when the match between Silver and Bullets at Silver Stadium grossed about K25 million while the Wanderers and Civo game at Kamuzu Stadium made K15 million. The other six matches in the the first week made less than K700 000 each. Moyale and Karonga United at Mzuzu Stadium grossed K680 900, Mighty Tigers and Extreme at Mpira Stadium (K563 000); Mafco and Chitipa United at Chitowe Stadium (K118 750); Blue Eagles and Red Lions at Nankhaka (K370 000); Ekwendeni Hammers and Kamuzu Barracks at Mzuzu Stadium (K134 4000) grossed not more than K700 000. In other words, with open stands tickets at K2 000, the patronage at these matches was less than. In week two, Karonga United and Chitipa United at Karonga Stadium grossed K3 213 600; Bangwe All Stars and Mighty Tigers at Mpira Stadium (K2 301 050); Civo and Extreme at Civo Stadium (K631 600); Ekwendeni Hammers and Moyale at Mzuzu Stadium (K645 000). Whereas the matches between Red Lions and Mighty Mukuru Wanderers at Balaka Stadium grossed K7 467 000 Blue Eagles and Silver at Nankhaka made K4 590 100; Bullets and Mafco at Kamuzu Stadium grossed K14 146 480. This also shows a drop in revenue in matches of crowd-pullers Bullets, Silver and Wanderers. It was the same in week three as matches between Bullets and Extreme at Civo Stadium (K11 762 200), Wanderers and Ekwendeni Hammers at Kamuzu Stadium (K8 150 750) fetched less than what the Blantyre giants fetched in the first two weeks. Matches between Chitipa United and Dedza Dynamos at Karonga (K1 473 400); Bangwe All Stars and Blue Eagles at Mulanje Park (K1 697 000); Silver and Red Lions at Bingu National Stadium (K5 025 720) fetched over K1 million. But Mafco against Karonga United at Chitowe (K240 050), Kamuzu Barracks and Moyale Barracks at Civo Stadium (K93 950), Mighty Tigers and Civo at Mpira Stadium (K675 200) grossed less that K700 000. Super League of Malawi (Sulom) general secretary Williams Banda admitted that low patronage is a challenge but that there are several factors that affected the revenue such as the Fifa+ live streaming platform. However, analysts have warned that as long as football administrators fail to bring in other elements of entertainment, football will keep on losing fans. Soccer analyst Patrick Zgambo observed that the standards of the game have contributed to the poor patronage. He said: “Overall, I think exposure to top leagues especially English Premiership through television, has exposed Malawians to high expectations in terms of standards of football and they are not impressed when they watch the local match. “A local football fan will still hold his allegiance to their local club, but he is more invested in the EPL because it is a better product and that’s what is more interesting. “The EPL has become a monster and has not only hurt the local game, but even European leagues like La Liga, Bundesliga are unable to compete as it has dominated interest of the global football.” Zgambo said football officials need to find means of addressing the situation to bring back the crowds. He sa id: “Malawi football must find a sustainable solution because the crowds will not return at a flip of a switch. They have to creatively stimulate interest of young people to get to the stadium. The older geriatrics who believed in a stadium atmosphere for a good old fashioned derby are dying off. Someone has to replace them in the stadia.” On his part, Kelvin Moyo said low patronage is also related to the generals etup at matches. He said: “Football should acknowledge that as an industry, competition in terms of entertainment is now high. Other entertaining industries such as live music, have raised the bar in offering far much better ser vices than football.” Moyo explained that football administrators should eat humble pie and adapt to the present situation. The anal yst sa i d : “Football has taken things for granted for so long. You should observe the crowd that is outside the stadium where booze, food etc is sold. “That is the part of entertainment that we are missing within the confines of the stadium. Let’s regulate some of these things and create an entertaining environment for our fans.” Moyo said football has also failed to provide entertainment suited for the millennials. He said: “What the older generation used to like cannot be equated to the present generation. Football has failed to look at the needs of the present younger g e n e r a t i o n . T h e r e is need to offer a fan zone to the fans at our football grounds suited for millennials. A part from a match that will be played at 14.30, there is no entertainment at the venue, the atmosphere is very boring.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 08:38:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"mwnation","category":["sports"],"country":["malawi"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tonga boss Kristian Woolf wants Test against St Helens’ Jonny Lomax","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/22278667/england-tonga-kristian-woolf-st-helens-jonny-lomax/","keywords":["Rugby League","Sport","England rugby league team","Rugby Football League","St Helens"],"creator":["Gary Carter"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"KRISTIAN Woolf hopes to face the ‘best he has ever worked with’ if Jonny Lomax makes England’s Test series against Tonga. The former St Helens chief will lead the Pacific nation – now a rugby league powerhouse – in a history-making three encounters in the Autumn. And he would love nothing more than testing himself against the man he believes is the standout, if national boss Shaun Wane picks him. Woolf said: “I’d like to see Jonny play. I had three great years working with him. The Saints guys are a great group but Jonny’s at the forefront of that. “There aren’t many players I’ve worked with that work harder than Jonny. He’s had massive things to get over in his career – including a brain injury - but he’s got through all that and plays at the level he does. “I’d go as far as saying I’ve never worked with a player who prepares as well as he does. You see in his performances it means something to him and playing for St Helens means something to him. “And I know if Jonny puts his hand up, he'll be a very influential player.” Woolf and Tonga stepped up after New Zealand’s series fell through, meaning it is the first time a Pacific nation will play a full tour against England. The island reached the World Cup semi-finals in 2017 and defeated Great Britain and Australia in 2019 Tests – but they under-performed in last year’s tournament. It can also help the development of the international game after he consulted former England boss, now his senior at NRL side Dolphins, Wayne Bennett. He added: “We were disappointed last year. We had a more talented squad than in 2019 but we didn’t reach our potential. We want to make amends. “The vast majority of players were very keen to get over to the UK and this is a really exciting opportunity. It’s a bit of a ‘grow up’ moment for us. “Hopefully, it rekindles that feeling for Test rugby. The fact we play three Tests, rather than just one, only adds to the excitement. “When we were tossing up the idea, I spoke to Wayne and he was extremely supportive. “He saw the positives and the strengths in terms of what it does for Tonga and international rugby league. He thought it was the way we should go.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 08:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lampard delighted with “first step” after Chelsea end winless run","link":"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/597100-lampard-delighted-with-first-step-after-chelsea-end-winless-run.html","keywords":["Football","chelsea","English Premier League (EPL)","frank lampard","lampard","Premier League"],"creator":["Agency Report"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chelsea are still 11th in the Premier League with four games left.

The former English Premier League (EPL) champions snapped a nine-match winless run in all competitions with a 3-1 victory at Bournemouth on Saturday. Chelsea have looked like a fractured outfit after a number of arrivals in the last two transfer windows and three different managers this season. But they showed glimpses of finally gelling together as a unit to end a six-match losing run. Chelsea are still 11th in the Premier League with four games left. But Lampard said the win would be a boost as they look to end the season on a high after just their second away victory of the year. “I’m happy. We came in off the back of a tough run. It’s been a tough year and there is a lot of work to do,” he told reporters. “But the performance and the result in isolation are really good, we deserved to win the game. “It’s a nice step forward for the lads. To work hard and come to a place that has been very hard for a lot of teams this year… I’m very happy. “In the modern game, those changes are huge. It’s important with the squad that we have that people feel like they can come in and affect the game. “We’ve worked towards that and I think every one of them did.” Lampard said there were still a lot of players finding their feet, especially youngsters, and urged them to “grasp” confidence from the performance. “Typically at Chelsea, one or two have fed into the group and now we have more. It’s understandable that as a group finding rhythm and confidence can be difficult,” the former Chelsea player added. “This is a first step. It won’t be plain sailing, but there is talent there and the players need to come together to get us to where we want to be.” Chelsea’s next game is at home against relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest next weekend. But tougher tests await with their last three games of the season against top-four sides Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United.

Shaw captured her first award at Friday’s Concacaf Awards after a season where she helped the Reggae Girlz to qualify for their second consecutive Women’s World Cup as well as played a role in Manchester City’s League Cup triumph. Canada’s Alphonso Davies won the Concacaf Men’s Player-of-the-Year award for the second consecutive year. Shaw, who was a finalist in 2018, became the first player from the Caribbean to win the award, an honour she dedicated to her teammates. “It is an unbelievable feeling to be named Concacaf Women’s Player of the Year. But I could not have done it without my teammates because they have played a massive part in this. I wish everyone could have this,” Shaw told the Manchester City Club website. Last June, Shaw scored three goals in the Concacaf Women’s Championship and was named to the team of the tournament. Domestically, she scored 26 goals in all competitions in 2022, helping City to the Continental Cup that year. Of those 26 goals in 2022, she scored 15 in 19 league matches. This season she is currently leading the golden boot race with 18 goals and Manchester City are now in second place in the table with 44 points, three points behind leaders Manchester United. Shaw said she hoped that others would be motivated to stay the course in their own journey with continued hard work and belief. “The message I have to anybody who has a dream like I did is to keep believing and enjoy the process and journey,” Shaw said. “The journey is ultimately what is going to get you to your destination, so just work hard every day, knowing where you want to get to and no matter what obstacles come your way, you need to keep believing in yourself and doing your best.” Jamaica Football Federation president Michael Ricketts congratulated Shaw on the honour, recognising her trailblazing efforts for the women’s game in Jamaica. “In winning this award, Khadija has enhanced brand Jamaica, but even more so, has offered immense hope to countless young Jamaican female footballers,” Ricketts said in a statement released yesterday. “From playing in the streets of Spanish Town to St Jago High School, to club, to the national team, to college and the professional ranks, she has not only paved the football pathway but has shown the qualities that breed success.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 06:48:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicagleaner","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Building a legacy","link":"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/sports/20230507/building-legacy","keywords":null,"creator":["Lester Hinds - Gleaner Writer"],"video_url":null,"description":"PORTLANDERS FOOTBALL Club is on a mission – not just to invest in young men but to build the kind of football legacy that will be replicated and put Jamaica on the football map in a big way.

The club, formerly known as St George’s Football Club, based in Buff Bay, Portland, currently encompasses almost the entire parish of Portland, while also attracting boys from parts of St Mary, a neighbouring parish. Currently, Portlanders Football Club is a franchise of the Jamaica Football Federation and has teams competing at various levels. The club has teams playing at Tier II Premier level, under-20, under-17 and under-13 teams. St George’s Football Club was taken over and incorporated in July 2018 by Dr Kingsley Chin, a board certified spinal surgeon, who lives in the United States but hails from Buff Bay and attended Titchfield High School. In September 2018, he changed the name to Portlanders Football Club because of the vision to make it a parish-wide club. Since taking over the club and changing its name to Portlanders Football Club, Dr Chin has poured resources into the team. KIC Ventures, a US-based company, of which Dr Chin is founder and chief executive officer, has reportedly already invested some $20 million in the teams. He has purchased a team bus to take the players to games across the island, provided all necessary gear and ensured that the members of the teams are provided for nutrition-wise. He has also upgraded the Lynch Park in Portland where the teams train and put management structures in place to ensure that the team can function independently of him. Dr Chin played football for Titchfield and represented Jamaica. He was given a football scholarship which took him to Columbia University in New York where he played collegiate football. He also attended Harvard Medical School where he became a doctor. “I remember running about playing football barefooted and football is what took me to the United States. I owe everything I have become to football,” he told . “My dream is to build a full football academy in Portland,” he said. Dr Chin says he is giving back to Jamaica in this way because through football a start can be made to reclaim boys from the streets, who may potentially fall into a life of crime. He urges others in the diaspora, who can get involved in sports in Jamaica to do so, as this is another tangible way of giving back to the country. “I believe that young men need male role models and football can provide such role models. I know when I played football for the parish at age 12, I looked up to the senior players with whom I came into contact. They became my role models and I believe that this can work for our young men today,” he said. He envisions several of the players on Portlanders Football Club representing Jamaica or getting scholarships that could change their lives. Portlanders Football Club have also entered into an unofficial agreement with Titchfield High through which young players from the club can join the school’s football programme. Dr Chin paid tribute to Raymond Munzie Gordon as coach, Colin Mattis, the field manager, Brian Davis, assistant coach and player recruitment, and Leslie Phillips, transportation and food manager for their work in helping to develop and shape Portlanders Football Club. Delano Smith, a 26-year-old member of the senior team that competes in the Tier II competition, said that he became involved with the team because of his brother, who was also a member. “Right now we are rebuilding the team because some of the players who were in the team have left. What the management is trying to do is instilling discipline and putting into place structures and some people are resentful of the discipline,” he said. Smith said that the club is being built around young players and he likes the atmosphere surrounding the team. “I like the atmosphere. I like the team spirit being developed. We lost about 14 players but we are rebuilding. It is not an easy road, but we hope to make Portlanders Football Club a name in football in Jamaica,” he said. According to Smith, the team is looking to be in the top four of the competition. Junior Linder, a member of the under-20 team, who also spoke with , said he joined the club because he likes the direction in which it is going. “I believe that if we continue as we are going, very soon we will have a great team representing the parish,” he said. Linder said the club is building the kind of team spirit that will take it far in the future. “We are developing as a team although we come from different parts of the parish. We have one goal and that is to make the club a success. We want to win and we can do so if we play as a team and do all the things that it takes to win,” said Linder. According to Portlanders manager, Blake Brown, the club is the premier footballing organisation in the parish. “We have teams from under 13 through to a senior team. Our senior team will be competing in the national Tier II competition which starts next week, April 22. “At Portlanders, we emphasise true leadership at all levels on and off the field. It is with great humility that we are the standard-bearers for the great parish of Portland. I’m certain that we will continue our contribution to the development of football at the parish level and beyond,” said Brown. According to Brown, since the club had been taken over by Dr Chin, the programme had been growing and all the necessary pieces for a successful programme were being put in place. “We are on the right track and we will be making our mark on football in Jamaica.”","pubDate":"2023-05-07 06:44:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicagleaner","category":["sports"],"country":["Gabon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ASSE – Mercato : un jeune buteur de l'OM dans le viseur","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/mercato/asse-mercato-une-promesse-de-lom-dans-le-viseur-817182","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"En fin de contrat à l'OM, Lionnel Lukoki (18 ans) intéresse l'ASSE.","content":"S'il est aujourd'hui meilleur buteur de l'équipe U19, Lionnel Lukoki (18 ans) fait partie de la liste des 46 joueurs que l'OM ne conservera pas dans son centre de formation au 1er juillet prochain.

Diamantakos, who joined Kerala Blasters FC in 2022, had a memorable campaign in the ISL 2022-23 season. He ended the season as the club’s top scorer, scoring 12 goals while chipping in with three assists. His contributions were vital as Kerala Blasters FC qualified for the ISL playoffs in consecutive seasons, a first in the club’s history. The Blasters saw their campaign come to an end after going down to Bengaluru FC in a one-legged knockout playoffs fixture. However, Diamantakos was confident of the club bouncing back and spoke about their target of winning the League Shield next season. “I must say that it was a good season for me as I scored some goals, but it didn’t help the team achieve our goals and I hope that next season we win the (League) Shield because that is our target. And I hope that I score more goals and help the team more,” Diamantakos said in an interview with the club. With 12 goal contributions, Diamantakos was the leading goal contributor for Kerala Blasters FC in ISL 2022-23. His tally of goals was just two short of Odisha FC’s Diego Mauricio, who emerged as the Golden Boot winner during the ISL 2022-2023 season. Diamantakos credited the players and coaching staff for his performances while also highlighting his partnership with midfielder Adrian Luna. “We are one really good group. All the players are really good. But the one that helped me the most and I think he needs to take most of the credit because he gave me the most assists, is Adrian Luna,” the Greek striker said. “But all the players helped me and the coaches developed my football and helped me play my best football,” he added. Thanks to his goalscoring exploits, Diamantakos developed a reputation as a fan favourite among the Kerala Blasters FC faithful. The 30-year-old striker acknowledged the support from the fans during good and difficult situations. “I have a lot of good moments because, after every game we played in our stadium when we finished the game, we saw the crowd celebrate together after every win and even after the losses. They are always there and make everything better for us and support us a lot,” Diamantakos expressed.
