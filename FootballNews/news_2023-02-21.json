Brian Taylor will continue to call the Friday night games with James Brayshaw. Abbey Holmes, the former AFLW player, is likely to take up the boundary riding role for Friday nights in place of Richardson. Television industry sources familiar with the line-ups also revealed: Riewoldt is spending 2023 in the United States with his family and has taken leave from Foxtel. Riewoldt’s position on the light-hearted Saturday night post-game show Best On Ground will not be filled, either. Fox Footy will continue with the other four cast members – Mark Howard, ex-champions Nathan Buckley and Jonathan Brown and Kath Loughnan. But Riewoldt will be replaced by a prominent former player for the long-running On the Couch on Monday nights, which ex-Melbourne skipper Garry Lyon will host again, alongside Brown. Buckley would be the logical replacement for Riewoldt. Foxtel will continue to use longstanding callers Anthony Hudson, Dwayne Russell, Howard and Kelli Underwood and Perth-based Adam Papalia. Special commentary for games will be provided by Lyon, Buckley, Brown and a range of other decorated ex-players including Jason Dunstall, Gerard Healy, David King, Jordan Lewis, Nick Dal Santo, Mark Ricciuto (Adelaide), Matthew Pavlich (Perth), Brad Johnson and Cameron Mooney. Foxtel, which broadcasts five-and-a-half games per round compared to free to air broadcaster Seven’s three and a half matches, will also use Collingwood AFLW stars Chloe Molloy and Ruby Schleicher to provide expert comments.

There had been doubt over whether Benzema would be available for the highly-anticipated clash at Anfield after missing Real’s 2-0 win over Osasuna in LaLiga on Saturday. Rodrygo started in place of the 35-year-old striker on the weekend, but it has since emerged that Ancelotti was only managing his minutes ahead of the crucial tie against Liverpool . Benzema has struggled to stay fit all season and missed France’s World Cup campaign as a result. But when asked about his star striker in Monday’s pre-match press conference, Ancelotti allayed any doubts about his readiness. \"I see Benzema looking well,” he said. “Tomorrow he will start.\" Jurgen Klopp left stunned when asked if Vinicius Jr brings racist attacks on himself 5 things noticed from Liverpool training ahead of Real Madrid including Nunez update The veteran striker scored 15 goals in 12 Champions League appearances last season to help Los Blancos win the highly-coveted trophy. Liverpool know all about his talents, having been beaten 1-0 in the final at the Stade de France in May. He has 11 goals in 13 LaLiga appearances so far this season, but is yet to hit the heights of his outstanding 2021/22 campaign, which saw him score 44 goals and scoop the Ballon d’Or in October . Benzema will be hoping to end a five-game goal drought in the Champions League, having failed to net in 324 minutes in the competition since scoring in the semi-final second leg against Manchester City last season. While he can call upon Benzema’s experience up front, Ancelotti does have injury problems in midfield, where Toni Kroos and Aurelien Tchouameni are both absent. Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Ceballos have started the past two matches alongside Luka Modric in midfield and Ancelotti is confident they will perform well against Liverpool. Karim Benzema trained with his Real Madrid team-mates on Monday ( Image: Pedro Castillo/Real Madrid via Getty Images) HAVE YOUR SAY! Will Karim Benzema make all the difference for Real Madrid, or can Liverpool get the better of the defending champions? Comment below . \"We keep going with the transition of young players coming through and it has been forced on us a bit because of injuries,” he said. \"I'm not worried about it as we have some good players who have come in. \"The players who have come in for Tchouameni and Kroos have done really well.

His condition is good and he still wants to play for Madrid.\" Real Madrid qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League by finishing top of Group F on 13 points. They picked up four wins, one draw and one defeat against RB Leipzig, Celtic and Shakhtar Donetsk. Despite taking 15 points, Liverpool went through in second place in Group A, with Napoli taking top spot on goal difference.

Potter is under huge pressure at Chelsea following their embarrassing 1-0 defeat by managerless Southampton on Saturday. Saints are bottom of the Premier League and had just one win from their previous 11 league games, but still came away from Stamford Bridge with three points thanks to James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick. Chelsea have lost nine of their last 15 games in all competitions and sit 10th in the Premier League, 11 points adrift of the top four. Potter has won just nine of his 25 matches in charge since succeeding Thomas Tuchel in September and was booed by the Blues fans on Saturday. Chelsea's five reasons for not sacking Graham Potter as Todd Boehly under pressure to act Graham Potter's future as Chelsea boss hanging in balance as Todd Boehly makes decision Nevertheless, Todd Boehly and co-owner Behdad Eghbali remain determined to keep the faith with the former Brighton manager. That stance does not appear to be one that Belle Silva would agree with. Belle, the wife of veteran defender Thiago Silva, is well-known among Chelsea fans for being forthright with her views on the team – and she hasn’t held back from criticising Potter. After tweeting about Carnival in her native Brazil, Belle received a reply on a very different topic from a user called PassmasterEnzo5, which she proceeded to like. It read : “can u ask [Thiago] silva to coach our club himself because we have a deadbeat tacticless [sic] coach who doesn't know what he is doing ,he doesn't even understand this is Chelsea football club he thinks he is still at Brighton.” Graham Potter is under mounting pressure at Chelsea ( Image: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/REX/Shutterstock) HAVE YOUR SAY! Do you think Chelsea should sack Graham Potter? Comment below . It is not the first time that Belle’s social media activity has raised eyebrows. After Chelsea lost 2-1 to rivals Fulham in January, she wrote, “If there was a @tsilva3 in attack and one in midfield, with what we already have in defense…” After a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Manchester City in the FA Cup , she wrote: “I just think that going back or looking for solutions when you take a hasty and totally wrong attitude is not wrong. #goblues.” Thiago Silva's wife Belle has often used her social media accounts to vent about Chelsea ( Image: Aurelien Meunier - PSG/PSG via Getty Images) Potter admitted that his side’s performance was not good enough against Southampton, but said that his side remain a work in progress with so many players yet to settle in following a hugely busy January transfer window. \"After a 1-0 defeat at home, any criticism you get is understandable,\" he said on Saturday. \"We've had a tough period and are integrating young players into the Premier League. When results don't go your way, it's tough. \"I'm not arrogant enough to say that their opinion isn't worth articulating. My job is to help the team and work through a team period.

That is good news for Wrexham , who are trying to get out of the National League under the ownership of Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. The pair have spent a small fortune since completing a takeover in November 2008, but to no avail. Wrexham finished second in the National League last season to qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Grimsby . They are in the same position this time around - sitting five points behind leaders Notts County . Wrexham do have two games in hand, however. Birmingham City face points deduction after being charged for EFL breaches Boss of fan knocked out at West Ham vs Chelsea breaks silence on apprentice Parry was asked about the possibility of three promotion spots from the National League instead of just two during an interview with BBC Sport . The EFL boss admitted: \"We are having a lot of discussion about three up, three down. \"We absolutely recognise the need to look downwards as well as up. We have to be consistent in our approach. We haven't put proposals to our clubs yet, but do we envisage that being part of the package we put forward? Yes, 100 per cent.\" The EFL are looking to reform their competitions - including the Carabao Cup. The relevance of the competition has been questioned, with UEFA's president Aleksander Ceferin telling The Telegraph English football \"would not lose much if you lose that cup\". Ryan Reynolds owns Wrexham with fellow Hollywood star Rob McElhenney ( Image: PA) Do you think the EFL should change their promotion and relegation structure? Let us know in the comments below! The chances of the Carabao Cup being scrapped are slim after Parry defended the competition, although reform is a possibility. Manchester United take on Premier League rivals Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup at Wembley on Sunday. Parry added: \"Last year we had a record TV audience of four million for the Carabao Cup final... But of course we recognise there are challenges with the calendar. Are we prepared to have constructive dialogue, given those challenges? Yes, of course.\" Reynolds and McElhenney are desperate to take Wrexham out of the National League, as they look to establish the Welsh club near the top of the English pyramid. The National League is arguably the hardest division to win promotion from at this moment in time. Liverpool issue response to leaked report into Champions League final chaos European Super League branded \"a walking corpse\" as fans fume at new proposal Only one team is guaranteed automatic promotion, and there are some big clubs in the National League. The likes of Notts County, Chesterfield, Southend, York, Yeovil, Torquay, Scunthorpe and former Premier League club Oldham would all love a return to the EFL. Wrexham's challenge is apparent by Notts County's form. The Nottingham-based club have won six consecutive league games and already have 80 points, with 13 games remaining. In theory, Wrexham or Notts County could gain more than 100 points and stay down. \"We need to get out of this f****** league,\" ranted McElhenney after Wrexham's game against Aldershot in October 2021 was abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch. Wrexham players attempted to clear water off the pitch themselves.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:58:03","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article29269067.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1246648667.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"5 destinations for Lionel Messi as Paris Saint-Germain star closes in on summer exit","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lionel-messi-transfer-miami-barcelona-29268742","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Felix Keith)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain is set to expire at the end of June and the Argentina star has not yet decided whether to stay put or leave for another club","content":"Lionel Messi is facing a big decision in the coming months, with his current contract with Paris Saint-Germain set to expire at the end of June. Messi joined PSG on a two-year deal in August 2021 after his emotional departure from Barcelona came about due to financial reasons. The 35-year-old has formed a star-studded front line in France’s capital, playing alongside general talents Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, but it all might come to an end when the season finishes. There has been lots of speculation about Messi’s future since he played a starring role in Argentina’s World Cup win in December. Reports at the time stated he was considering the offer of a contract extension with PSG, but L’Equipe now says he is leaning towards leaving Paris. Lionel Messi saves PSG after Neymar stretchered off and sporting director took over mid-game Lionel Messi's father rates chances of son ever making Barcelona return His stunning free-kick in the 95th minute to earn a 4-3 win over Lille on the weekend showed just how important he is for Christophe Galtier’s side. But could they be about to lose him? Here Mirror Football takes a look at five possible destinations if Messi does decide to call it a day in France. Inter Miami The MLS franchise, who are part-owned by David Beckham and coached by Phil Neville, have made no secret of their desire to sign Messi. The Times have reported they are ‘confident’ of signing Messi and would give him a deal which would make him the highest-paid player in MLS history. Messi is known to be a fan of Miami as a place. He has holidayed there with his family on several occasions and the lifestyle clearly holds an allure. But is he willing to turn his back on the higher level of European football to move to the US? David Beckham wants to bring Lionel Messi to Inter Miami ( Image: Mark Brown/Getty Images) Barcelona Messi made it absolutely clear that he did not want to leave Barca in August 2021. “We were convinced we were continuing here, at home,\" he said as he unsuccessfully tried not to cry. \"I did all that I could to stay, because I wanted to stay.\" Barcelona is Messi’s home – and, despite all the financial troubles with the Catalan giants, there will always be a desire to bring the Argentine star back. The club would likely have to make sacrifices in other areas to bring Messi back, but it is possible he would be willing to take a significant pay cut to finish his career with the club where he scored 672 goals in 778 and lifted 35 trophies. HAVE YOUR SAY! Where would you like to see Lionel Messi go this summer if he leaves PSG? Comment below . Lionel Messi did not want to leave Barcelona in August 2021 ( Image: Marc Gonzalez Aloma/Getty Images) Manchester City PSG weren’t the only club linked with Messi in the summer of 2021. Pep Guardiola’s presence at Manchester City – and the club’s deep pockets – meant they were also earmarked as a potential destination. Guardiola has not been shy to shower praise on Messi, who worked wonders under his management at Barcelona. However, signing a soon-to-be 36-year-old would represent a departure from City’s strategy in the transfer market, no matter how good Messi is. Pep Guardiola and Lionel Messi worked together at Barca ( Image: Getty Images) Al-Hilal Cristiano Ronaldo ’s mega-money move to Al-Nassr showed that Saudi Arabia is willing to break the bank to lure superstar players to its league. Ever since Ronaldo made the move to Riyadh there have been rumours that Messi could follow suit. Saudi Arabia is bidding to host the 2030 World Cup – and getting Messi on board as an ambassador is something the country would love to do. Mundo Deportivo reported recently that Al-Nassr’s rivals Al-Hillal would be willing to pay Messi a staggering £245m-a-year – a figure which would dwarf Ronaldo’s £177m per year pay cheque . That’s a tempting offer. Al-Hilal are keen on signing Lionel Messi this summer ( Image: KARIM JAAFAR/AFP via Getty Images) Lionel Messi is revered at Newell's Old Boys ( Image: Luciano Bisbal/Getty Images) Newell’s Old Boys \"The desire is always playing for Newell's – it is what I dreamed of as a kid,\" Messi told TyC Sports five years ago. \"When I went to the club I imagined playing in the Primera Division, but I do not know what's going to happen in a few years. I cannot say I'm going back because I do not know where I'm going to be.\" It is a romantic notion, returning to where it all began as a child before he moved to Barcelona, and it is one that could appeal to Messi now. After winning the World Cup – the last trophy he desired – Messi could up sticks and return to Argentina for a swansong before retirement.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:38:11","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article29268786.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1467976844.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rio Ferdinand reveals \"dramatic\" change at Man Utd training ground after visit","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-rio-ferdinand-training-29268837","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Thomas Bristow)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester United are third in the Premier League and still in the running for four trophies under Erik ten Hag - and Rio Ferdinand can sense the mood change at the club","content":"Rio Ferdinand says the vibe at Manchester United's training base has dramatically shifted. The former United defender, winner of six Premier League titles, visited Carrington to interview Bruno Fernandes on Monday. While there, Ferdinand spoke to some of United's players, the staff and even took a gander through the building's corridors. What the 44-year-old noticed blew him away, as he believes the positivity he witnessed is of stark contrast to previous visits to the training ground. Ferdinand, like many United fans, will have lived through some bleak times. Louis van Gaal , Jose Mourinho , Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick failed to inspire the same way Erik ten Hag has, but few have had the opportunity to see things close up like the former England centre-back. Man Utd takeover: Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar make same Glazer demand after bids Man Utd finally reach agreement with Alejandro Garnacho as final hurdle remains It seems that what is going on behind the scenes is on par with what United are achieving on the pitch. Under Ten Hag, United are still in the running for four trophies and sit third in the Premier League. The Dutchman is also getting the best out of a resurgent Marcus Rashford , who has recorded his best ever scoring season for United. All these positives are indicative of a good training base, where United spend the majority of their time. \"The vibes at Carrington and Old Trafford have changed dramatically,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube show, FIVE . \"It's become more positive, the ambience in the place. The cafeteria has even changed. It's like everything has changed. Looks different, feels different, food's different. The feeling when you walk in, I've had very negative vibes [in the past] when I've walked through the corridors of the training ground. Rio Ferdinand was pleased to see Kath is still going strong at Manchester United ( Image: Twitter@https://twitter.com/rioferdy5) Rio Ferdinand and Bruno Fernandes at Carrington ( Image: Twitter@https://twitter.com/rioferdy5) \"I was on my own, walking back out through the training ground, through the corridors, and I stood there and just smiled. I can sense something happening in here now. I don't what it is or where it's going to but the ambience is very different. There's a confidence in the place. \"And the confidence isn't about the players alone, it's the staff. I can sense something with the staff. They're more upbeat, happy to be in at work every day. And that's all been generated and created by Erik ten Hag and his management team and some people behind the scenes, because there's not one person who can change the whole culture of a football club - it's a collaborative approach. Man Utd takeover: Sir Jim Ratcliffe's bid hides crucial detail that gives Qatar edge Victor Lindelof speaks out on Man Utd players being distracted by takeover talks \"It's the right path right now and given they're in the running for four trophies still, not that I think they'll win four. It's nice to go to Carrington and Old Trafford and feel more optimistic than negative.\" He added: \"The vibe when they're out training, doing the rondos, there's a different energy that I haven't seen for a while, not that I've been there loads.

Trailing Motherwell by two goals to nil...","content":"IT was a moment that rather summed up a terrible day at the office for Hearts. Trailing Motherwell by two goals to nil, manager Robbie Neilson made a triple change in an attempt to inject some life into his uncharacteristically off-colour team. The trouble was that when the board went up, the wrong number was displayed, leading to full-back Alex Cochrane leaving the pitch behind the Motherwell goal and applauding the large travelling support as he trudged round to the dugout, only for striker Lawrence Shankland to eventually inform him he hadn’t been subbed off at all. In fairness to Cochrane, he admits that any one of the 10 outfield players could have been hooked during a desperately disappointing afternoon for the Jambos, with only goalkeeper Zander Clark perhaps emerging with any credit. READ MORE: Motherwell 2 Hearts 0: Kettlewell makes it two in a row \"That's something I've never seen before,” Cochrane said. “It summed up our day, I think. “My number did go up. They meant to put 29 up but 19 actually went up. I was oblivious to it, just walking off the pitch, and then I heard Shanks call my name to go back on. It's something I've never seen in football before - being subbed off then subbed back on again. \"It wasn't the best performance from us, we know that as a team and we spoke about it. We need to win these games if we want to be in that third position. It wasn't a good day for us. \"Motherwell make it tough whenever we come here. We were a bit slack with passing, everyone could have been a bit braver going forward, including myself. We all know we weren't at the races and we're all disappointed with the result. “We have to dust ourselves down and go again. We've got next weekend off, then we've got a big game against St Johnstone, then Celtic back-to-back. There are big games coming up for us.” The magnitude of those games has been heightened slightly further still by something of a resurgence in form on the other side of Edinburgh, with Hibernian remarkably now just five points behind their city rivals. READ MORE: Burrows details 'emotional' Motherwell exit after final Fir Park game Cochrane though says that any assumption Hearts already had third place sewn up has only been external, and that the poor showing at Fir Park was not a necessary wake-up call, denying that complacency had set in. \"I don't think so,” he said. “We've been on a good run and this was an off day. We can't be having any more of them. It wasn't our best performance and everyone in the dressing room knows that. \"We never thought third place was done and dusted, there are still plenty games to go in the season. “Yes, it's five points [to Hibs]. It's a gap but we need to make sure we keep that gap. We've got big games coming up, so we need to make sure we are right at it.” Unfortunately for Hearts though, they will be left to lick their wounds from the Motherwell defeat for an extended period, with no match this weekend due to the Viaplay Cup Final. Cochrane thinks that may be no bad thing though, affording them an opportunity to reset and get back to their old selves. “There will be a few days off so it's obviously a chance to recharge the batteries and go again in a couple of weeks' time,” he said. “It's a good chance to see where we are but we know that, on the training pitch, we need to put in the work. “We will speak about this game but as soon as that's done then we need to move on quickly - focus on ourselves and then hopefully the rest takes care of itself.”","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:30:00","image_url":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/16475899/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"heraldscotland","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Уотфорд - Уест Бромич 3:2 /репортаж/","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/anglia/multimedia/video/uotford-uest-bromich-32-reportazh-721518","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Уотфорд победи Уест Бромич Албиън с 3:2 у дома.

As the former West Brom manager put one over the club who sacked him in December 2020 in his first reunion with the Baggies, a madcap second half was settled by Ken Sema's fortuitous winner. Bilic will not give a pancake's toss that fortune smiled on him just enough to send the Hornets back into the play-off places in fifth. But whether your topping of choice is maple syrup, lemon and sugar or caramelised banana, none of your favourite Shrove Tuesday dishes will be as exotic as this thrilling recipe of mistakes. With just 36 points from his first 23 games in charge, the Croatian needs lashings of tempo, verve and bravery to win a ticket to the £180million Championship play-offs lottery. Conor Townsend equalised for West Brom for the first time in the 56th minute ( Image: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images) And after 23 minutes of shadow boxing, Watford suddenly found the right mixture. When Darnell Furlong could only half-block a Keinan Davis shot on the turn from close range, Baggies keeper Josh Griffiths pushed it into Sema's path and the Swedish winger lifted his third goal of the season into the roof of the net. If the home side's breakthrough scored low marks for artistic merit, Albion's contribution to it was a mess. Griffiths fared better with a sprawling save to deny Davis when the on-loan Aston Villa striker was clean through after more negligent defending. But apart from Brandon Thomas-Asante's stooping header wide at the near post, Albion offered little going forward and they were booed off at the break. Boss Carlos Corberan responded with a double change, hooking England one-cap wonder Nathaniel Chalobah, who struggled on his return to Vicarage Road, and his reshuffle worked a treat within 11 minutes. Will Watford make the play-offs? Have your say in the comments! Slaven Bilic is under pressure but Watford's play-off hopes were boosted with victory over West Brom ( Image: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images) Daniel Bachmann made a fine save to deny John Swift, but within seconds Conor Townsend prodded the equaliser from close range after substitute Jason Molumby's mishit shot bounced kindly for him six yards out. Ismaila Sarr was inches away from restoring Watford's lead within a minutes, clipping the post after bursting into the box on his left foot. The Senegal winger was on target 11 minutes later with a crisp finish from 12 yards, his ninth bullseye of the campaign, but the Hornets' joy didn't last. Bachmann's attempt to play out from the back was rumbled and Jed Wallace – who was offside – rolled home from 12 yards, seconds after Sema had been denied by a linesman's flag at the other end. But providence was kinder to King Ken, as he is known in these parts, with 12 minutes left as his angled shot took a big deflection off Erik Pieters to make it 3-2.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:15:43","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29268858.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1468018885.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How AFL commentary teams will change for season 2023","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/how-afl-commentary-teams-will-change-for-season-2023-20230221-p5cm4o.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / AFL"],"creator":["Jake Niall"],"video_url":null,"description":"Daisy Pearce will not provide special comments on Seven’s Friday night broadcasts, while Fox and Seven have decided not to replace two big-name analysts in 2023.","content":"Popular ex-Richmond great Matthew Richardson will replace Daisy Pearce in the upstairs commentary box for Seven’s coverage of Friday night football in 2023.

There had been doubt over whether Benzema would be available for the highly-anticipated clash at Anfield after missing Real’s 2-0 win over Osasuna in LaLiga on Saturday. Rodrygo started in place of the 35-year-old striker on the weekend, but it has since emerged that Ancelotti was only managing his minutes ahead of the crucial tie against Liverpool . Benzema has struggled to stay fit all season and missed France’s World Cup campaign as a result. But when asked about his star striker in Monday’s pre-match press conference, Ancelotti allayed any doubts about his readiness. \"I see Benzema looking well,” he said. “Tomorrow he will start.\" Jurgen Klopp left stunned when asked if Vinicius Jr brings racist attacks on himself 5 things noticed from Liverpool training ahead of Real Madrid including Nunez update The veteran striker scored 15 goals in 12 Champions League appearances last season to help Los Blancos win the highly-coveted trophy. Liverpool know all about his talents, having been beaten 1-0 in the final at the Stade de France in May. He has 11 goals in 13 LaLiga appearances so far this season, but is yet to hit the heights of his outstanding 2021/22 campaign, which saw him score 44 goals and scoop the Ballon d’Or in October . Benzema will be hoping to end a five-game goal drought in the Champions League, having failed to net in 324 minutes in the competition since scoring in the semi-final second leg against Manchester City last season. While he can call upon Benzema’s experience up front, Ancelotti does have injury problems in midfield, where Toni Kroos and Aurelien Tchouameni are both absent. Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Ceballos have started the past two matches alongside Luka Modric in midfield and Ancelotti is confident they will perform well against Liverpool. Karim Benzema trained with his Real Madrid team-mates on Monday ( Image: Pedro Castillo/Real Madrid via Getty Images) HAVE YOUR SAY! Will Karim Benzema make all the difference for Real Madrid, or can Liverpool get the better of the defending champions? Comment below . \"We keep going with the transition of young players coming through and it has been forced on us a bit because of injuries,” he said. \"I'm not worried about it as we have some good players who have come in. \"The players who have come in for Tchouameni and Kroos have done really well.

Potter is under huge pressure at Chelsea following their embarrassing 1-0 defeat by managerless Southampton on Saturday. Saints are bottom of the Premier League and had just one win from their previous 11 league games, but still came away from Stamford Bridge with three points thanks to James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick. Chelsea have lost nine of their last 15 games in all competitions and sit 10th in the Premier League, 11 points adrift of the top four. Potter has won just nine of his 25 matches in charge since succeeding Thomas Tuchel in September and was booed by the Blues fans on Saturday. Chelsea's five reasons for not sacking Graham Potter as Todd Boehly under pressure to act Graham Potter's future as Chelsea boss hanging in balance as Todd Boehly makes decision Nevertheless, Todd Boehly and co-owner Behdad Eghbali remain determined to keep the faith with the former Brighton manager. That stance does not appear to be one that Belle Silva would agree with. Belle, the wife of veteran defender Thiago Silva, is well-known among Chelsea fans for being forthright with her views on the team – and she hasn’t held back from criticising Potter. After tweeting about Carnival in her native Brazil, Belle received a reply on a very different topic from a user called PassmasterEnzo5, which she proceeded to like. It read : “can u ask [Thiago] silva to coach our club himself because we have a deadbeat tacticless [sic] coach who doesn't know what he is doing ,he doesn't even understand this is Chelsea football club he thinks he is still at Brighton.” Graham Potter is under mounting pressure at Chelsea ( Image: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/REX/Shutterstock) HAVE YOUR SAY! Do you think Chelsea should sack Graham Potter? Comment below . It is not the first time that Belle’s social media activity has raised eyebrows. After Chelsea lost 2-1 to rivals Fulham in January, she wrote, “If there was a @tsilva3 in attack and one in midfield, with what we already have in defense…” After a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Manchester City in the FA Cup , she wrote: “I just think that going back or looking for solutions when you take a hasty and totally wrong attitude is not wrong. #goblues.” Thiago Silva's wife Belle has often used her social media accounts to vent about Chelsea ( Image: Aurelien Meunier - PSG/PSG via Getty Images) Potter admitted that his side’s performance was not good enough against Southampton, but said that his side remain a work in progress with so many players yet to settle in following a hugely busy January transfer window. \"After a 1-0 defeat at home, any criticism you get is understandable,\" he said on Saturday. \"We've had a tough period and are integrating young players into the Premier League. When results don't go your way, it's tough. \"I'm not arrogant enough to say that their opinion isn't worth articulating. My job is to help the team and work through a team period.

That is good news for Wrexham , who are trying to get out of the National League under the ownership of Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. The pair have spent a small fortune since completing a takeover in November 2008, but to no avail. Wrexham finished second in the National League last season to qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Grimsby . They are in the same position this time around - sitting five points behind leaders Notts County . Wrexham do have two games in hand, however. Birmingham City face points deduction after being charged for EFL breaches Boss of fan knocked out at West Ham vs Chelsea breaks silence on apprentice Parry was asked about the possibility of three promotion spots from the National League instead of just two during an interview with BBC Sport . The EFL boss admitted: \"We are having a lot of discussion about three up, three down. \"We absolutely recognise the need to look downwards as well as up. We have to be consistent in our approach. We haven't put proposals to our clubs yet, but do we envisage that being part of the package we put forward? Yes, 100 per cent.\" The EFL are looking to reform their competitions - including the Carabao Cup. The relevance of the competition has been questioned, with UEFA's president Aleksander Ceferin telling The Telegraph English football \"would not lose much if you lose that cup\". Ryan Reynolds owns Wrexham with fellow Hollywood star Rob McElhenney ( Image: PA) Do you think the EFL should change their promotion and relegation structure? Let us know in the comments below! The chances of the Carabao Cup being scrapped are slim after Parry defended the competition, although reform is a possibility. Manchester United take on Premier League rivals Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup at Wembley on Sunday. Parry added: \"Last year we had a record TV audience of four million for the Carabao Cup final... But of course we recognise there are challenges with the calendar. Are we prepared to have constructive dialogue, given those challenges? Yes, of course.\" Reynolds and McElhenney are desperate to take Wrexham out of the National League, as they look to establish the Welsh club near the top of the English pyramid. The National League is arguably the hardest division to win promotion from at this moment in time. Liverpool issue response to leaked report into Champions League final chaos European Super League branded \"a walking corpse\" as fans fume at new proposal Only one team is guaranteed automatic promotion, and there are some big clubs in the National League. The likes of Notts County, Chesterfield, Southend, York, Yeovil, Torquay, Scunthorpe and former Premier League club Oldham would all love a return to the EFL. Wrexham's challenge is apparent by Notts County's form. The Nottingham-based club have won six consecutive league games and already have 80 points, with 13 games remaining. In theory, Wrexham or Notts County could gain more than 100 points and stay down. \"We need to get out of this f****** league,\" ranted McElhenney after Wrexham's game against Aldershot in October 2021 was abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch. Wrexham players attempted to clear water off the pitch themselves.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:58:03","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article29269067.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1246648667.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"5 destinations for Lionel Messi as Paris Saint-Germain star closes in on summer exit","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lionel-messi-transfer-miami-barcelona-29268742","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Felix Keith)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain is set to expire at the end of June and the Argentina star has not yet decided whether to stay put or leave for another club","content":"Lionel Messi is facing a big decision in the coming months, with his current contract with Paris Saint-Germain set to expire at the end of June. Messi joined PSG on a two-year deal in August 2021 after his emotional departure from Barcelona came about due to financial reasons. The 35-year-old has formed a star-studded front line in France’s capital, playing alongside general talents Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, but it all might come to an end when the season finishes. There has been lots of speculation about Messi’s future since he played a starring role in Argentina’s World Cup win in December. Reports at the time stated he was considering the offer of a contract extension with PSG, but L’Equipe now says he is leaning towards leaving Paris. Lionel Messi saves PSG after Neymar stretchered off and sporting director took over mid-game Lionel Messi's father rates chances of son ever making Barcelona return His stunning free-kick in the 95th minute to earn a 4-3 win over Lille on the weekend showed just how important he is for Christophe Galtier’s side. But could they be about to lose him? Here Mirror Football takes a look at five possible destinations if Messi does decide to call it a day in France. Inter Miami The MLS franchise, who are part-owned by David Beckham and coached by Phil Neville, have made no secret of their desire to sign Messi. The Times have reported they are ‘confident’ of signing Messi and would give him a deal which would make him the highest-paid player in MLS history. Messi is known to be a fan of Miami as a place. He has holidayed there with his family on several occasions and the lifestyle clearly holds an allure. But is he willing to turn his back on the higher level of European football to move to the US? David Beckham wants to bring Lionel Messi to Inter Miami ( Image: Mark Brown/Getty Images) Barcelona Messi made it absolutely clear that he did not want to leave Barca in August 2021. “We were convinced we were continuing here, at home,\" he said as he unsuccessfully tried not to cry. \"I did all that I could to stay, because I wanted to stay.\" Barcelona is Messi’s home – and, despite all the financial troubles with the Catalan giants, there will always be a desire to bring the Argentine star back. The club would likely have to make sacrifices in other areas to bring Messi back, but it is possible he would be willing to take a significant pay cut to finish his career with the club where he scored 672 goals in 778 and lifted 35 trophies. HAVE YOUR SAY! Where would you like to see Lionel Messi go this summer if he leaves PSG? Comment below . Lionel Messi did not want to leave Barcelona in August 2021 ( Image: Marc Gonzalez Aloma/Getty Images) Manchester City PSG weren’t the only club linked with Messi in the summer of 2021. Pep Guardiola’s presence at Manchester City – and the club’s deep pockets – meant they were also earmarked as a potential destination. Guardiola has not been shy to shower praise on Messi, who worked wonders under his management at Barcelona. However, signing a soon-to-be 36-year-old would represent a departure from City’s strategy in the transfer market, no matter how good Messi is. Pep Guardiola and Lionel Messi worked together at Barca ( Image: Getty Images) Al-Hilal Cristiano Ronaldo ’s mega-money move to Al-Nassr showed that Saudi Arabia is willing to break the bank to lure superstar players to its league. Ever since Ronaldo made the move to Riyadh there have been rumours that Messi could follow suit. Saudi Arabia is bidding to host the 2030 World Cup – and getting Messi on board as an ambassador is something the country would love to do. Mundo Deportivo reported recently that Al-Nassr’s rivals Al-Hillal would be willing to pay Messi a staggering £245m-a-year – a figure which would dwarf Ronaldo’s £177m per year pay cheque . That’s a tempting offer. Al-Hilal are keen on signing Lionel Messi this summer ( Image: KARIM JAAFAR/AFP via Getty Images) Lionel Messi is revered at Newell's Old Boys ( Image: Luciano Bisbal/Getty Images) Newell’s Old Boys \"The desire is always playing for Newell's – it is what I dreamed of as a kid,\" Messi told TyC Sports five years ago. \"When I went to the club I imagined playing in the Primera Division, but I do not know what's going to happen in a few years. I cannot say I'm going back because I do not know where I'm going to be.\" It is a romantic notion, returning to where it all began as a child before he moved to Barcelona, and it is one that could appeal to Messi now. After winning the World Cup – the last trophy he desired – Messi could up sticks and return to Argentina for a swansong before retirement.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:38:11","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article29268786.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1467976844.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rio Ferdinand reveals \"dramatic\" change at Man Utd training ground after visit","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-rio-ferdinand-training-29268837","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Thomas Bristow)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester United are third in the Premier League and still in the running for four trophies under Erik ten Hag - and Rio Ferdinand can sense the mood change at the club","content":"Rio Ferdinand says the vibe at Manchester United's training base has dramatically shifted. The former United defender, winner of six Premier League titles, visited Carrington to interview Bruno Fernandes on Monday. While there, Ferdinand spoke to some of United's players, the staff and even took a gander through the building's corridors. What the 44-year-old noticed blew him away, as he believes the positivity he witnessed is of stark contrast to previous visits to the training ground. Ferdinand, like many United fans, will have lived through some bleak times. Louis van Gaal , Jose Mourinho , Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick failed to inspire the same way Erik ten Hag has, but few have had the opportunity to see things close up like the former England centre-back. Man Utd takeover: Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar make same Glazer demand after bids Man Utd finally reach agreement with Alejandro Garnacho as final hurdle remains It seems that what is going on behind the scenes is on par with what United are achieving on the pitch. Under Ten Hag, United are still in the running for four trophies and sit third in the Premier League. The Dutchman is also getting the best out of a resurgent Marcus Rashford , who has recorded his best ever scoring season for United. All these positives are indicative of a good training base, where United spend the majority of their time. \"The vibes at Carrington and Old Trafford have changed dramatically,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube show, FIVE . \"It's become more positive, the ambience in the place.

Trailing Motherwell by two goals to nil, manager Robbie Neilson made a triple change in an attempt to inject some life into his uncharacteristically off-colour team. The trouble was that when the board went up, the wrong number was displayed, leading to full-back Alex Cochrane leaving the pitch behind the Motherwell goal and applauding the large travelling support as he trudged round to the dugout, only for striker Lawrence Shankland to eventually inform him he hadn’t been subbed off at all. In fairness to Cochrane, he admits that any one of the 10 outfield players could have been hooked during a desperately disappointing afternoon for the Jambos, with only goalkeeper Zander Clark perhaps emerging with any credit. READ MORE: Motherwell 2 Hearts 0: Kettlewell makes it two in a row \"That's something I've never seen before,” Cochrane said. “It summed up our day, I think. “My number did go up. They meant to put 29 up but 19 actually went up. I was oblivious to it, just walking off the pitch, and then I heard Shanks call my name to go back on. It's something I've never seen in football before - being subbed off then subbed back on again. \"It wasn't the best performance from us, we know that as a team and we spoke about it. We need to win these games if we want to be in that third position. It wasn't a good day for us. \"Motherwell make it tough whenever we come here. We were a bit slack with passing, everyone could have been a bit braver going forward, including myself. We all know we weren't at the races and we're all disappointed with the result. “We have to dust ourselves down and go again. We've got next weekend off, then we've got a big game against St Johnstone, then Celtic back-to-back. There are big games coming up for us.” The magnitude of those games has been heightened slightly further still by something of a resurgence in form on the other side of Edinburgh, with Hibernian remarkably now just five points behind their city rivals. READ MORE: Burrows details 'emotional' Motherwell exit after final Fir Park game Cochrane though says that any assumption Hearts already had third place sewn up has only been external, and that the poor showing at Fir Park was not a necessary wake-up call, denying that complacency had set in. \"I don't think so,” he said. “We've been on a good run and this was an off day. We can't be having any more of them. It wasn't our best performance and everyone in the dressing room knows that. \"We never thought third place was done and dusted, there are still plenty games to go in the season. “Yes, it's five points [to Hibs]. It's a gap but we need to make sure we keep that gap. We've got big games coming up, so we need to make sure we are right at it.” Unfortunately for Hearts though, they will be left to lick their wounds from the Motherwell defeat for an extended period, with no match this weekend due to the Viaplay Cup Final. Cochrane thinks that may be no bad thing though, affording them an opportunity to reset and get back to their old selves. “There will be a few days off so it's obviously a chance to recharge the batteries and go again in a couple of weeks' time,” he said. “It's a good chance to see where we are but we know that, on the training pitch, we need to put in the work. “We will speak about this game but as soon as that's done then we need to move on quickly - focus on ourselves and then hopefully the rest takes care of itself.”","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:30:00","image_url":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/16475899/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"heraldscotland","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Уотфорд - Уест Бромич 3:2 /репортаж/","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/anglia/multimedia/video/uotford-uest-bromich-32-reportazh-721518","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Уотфорд победи Уест Бромич Албиън с 3:2 у дома.

As the former West Brom manager put one over the club who sacked him in December 2020 in his first reunion with the Baggies, a madcap second half was settled by Ken Sema's fortuitous winner. Bilic will not give a pancake's toss that fortune smiled on him just enough to send the Hornets back into the play-off places in fifth. But whether your topping of choice is maple syrup, lemon and sugar or caramelised banana, none of your favourite Shrove Tuesday dishes will be as exotic as this thrilling recipe of mistakes. With just 36 points from his first 23 games in charge, the Croatian needs lashings of tempo, verve and bravery to win a ticket to the £180million Championship play-offs lottery. Conor Townsend equalised for West Brom for the first time in the 56th minute ( Image: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images) And after 23 minutes of shadow boxing, Watford suddenly found the right mixture. When Darnell Furlong could only half-block a Keinan Davis shot on the turn from close range, Baggies keeper Josh Griffiths pushed it into Sema's path and the Swedish winger lifted his third goal of the season into the roof of the net. If the home side's breakthrough scored low marks for artistic merit, Albion's contribution to it was a mess. Griffiths fared better with a sprawling save to deny Davis when the on-loan Aston Villa striker was clean through after more negligent defending. But apart from Brandon Thomas-Asante's stooping header wide at the near post, Albion offered little going forward and they were booed off at the break. Boss Carlos Corberan responded with a double change, hooking England one-cap wonder Nathaniel Chalobah, who struggled on his return to Vicarage Road, and his reshuffle worked a treat within 11 minutes.

Ismaila Sarr was inches away from restoring Watford's lead within a minutes, clipping the post after bursting into the box on his left foot. The Senegal winger was on target 11 minutes later with a crisp finish from 12 yards, his ninth bullseye of the campaign, but the Hornets' joy didn't last. Bachmann's attempt to play out from the back was rumbled and Jed Wallace – who was offside – rolled home from 12 yards, seconds after Sema had been denied by a linesman's flag at the other end. But providence was kinder to King Ken, as he is known in these parts, with 12 minutes left as his angled shot took a big deflection off Erik Pieters to make it 3-2.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:15:43","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29268858.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1468018885.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How AFL commentary teams will change for season 2023","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/how-afl-commentary-teams-will-change-for-season-2023-20230221-p5cm4o.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":["Sport / AFL"],"creator":["Jake Niall"],"video_url":null,"description":"Daisy Pearce will not provide special comments on Seven’s Friday night broadcasts, while Fox and Seven have decided not to replace two big-name analysts in 2023.","content":"Popular ex-Richmond great Matthew Richardson will replace Daisy Pearce in the upstairs commentary box for Seven’s coverage of Friday night football in 2023.

There had been doubt over whether Benzema would be available for the highly-anticipated clash at Anfield after missing Real’s 2-0 win over Osasuna in LaLiga on Saturday. Rodrygo started in place of the 35-year-old striker on the weekend, but it has since emerged that Ancelotti was only managing his minutes ahead of the crucial tie against Liverpool . Benzema has struggled to stay fit all season and missed France’s World Cup campaign as a result. But when asked about his star striker in Monday’s pre-match press conference, Ancelotti allayed any doubts about his readiness. \"I see Benzema looking well,” he said. “Tomorrow he will start.\" Jurgen Klopp left stunned when asked if Vinicius Jr brings racist attacks on himself 5 things noticed from Liverpool training ahead of Real Madrid including Nunez update The veteran striker scored 15 goals in 12 Champions League appearances last season to help Los Blancos win the highly-coveted trophy. Liverpool know all about his talents, having been beaten 1-0 in the final at the Stade de France in May. He has 11 goals in 13 LaLiga appearances so far this season, but is yet to hit the heights of his outstanding 2021/22 campaign, which saw him score 44 goals and scoop the Ballon d’Or in October . Benzema will be hoping to end a five-game goal drought in the Champions League, having failed to net in 324 minutes in the competition since scoring in the semi-final second leg against Manchester City last season. While he can call upon Benzema’s experience up front, Ancelotti does have injury problems in midfield, where Toni Kroos and Aurelien Tchouameni are both absent. Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Ceballos have started the past two matches alongside Luka Modric in midfield and Ancelotti is confident they will perform well against Liverpool.

Potter is under huge pressure at Chelsea following their embarrassing 1-0 defeat by managerless Southampton on Saturday. Saints are bottom of the Premier League and had just one win from their previous 11 league games, but still came away from Stamford Bridge with three points thanks to James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick. Chelsea have lost nine of their last 15 games in all competitions and sit 10th in the Premier League, 11 points adrift of the top four.

That stance does not appear to be one that Belle Silva would agree with. Belle, the wife of veteran defender Thiago Silva, is well-known among Chelsea fans for being forthright with her views on the team – and she hasn’t held back from criticising Potter. After tweeting about Carnival in her native Brazil, Belle received a reply on a very different topic from a user called PassmasterEnzo5, which she proceeded to like. It read : “can u ask [Thiago] silva to coach our club himself because we have a deadbeat tacticless [sic] coach who doesn't know what he is doing ,he doesn't even understand this is Chelsea football club he thinks he is still at Brighton.” Graham Potter is under mounting pressure at Chelsea ( Image: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/REX/Shutterstock) HAVE YOUR SAY! Do you think Chelsea should sack Graham Potter? Comment below . It is not the first time that Belle’s social media activity has raised eyebrows. After Chelsea lost 2-1 to rivals Fulham in January, she wrote, “If there was a @tsilva3 in attack and one in midfield, with what we already have in defense…” After a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Manchester City in the FA Cup , she wrote: “I just think that going back or looking for solutions when you take a hasty and totally wrong attitude is not wrong. #goblues.” Thiago Silva's wife Belle has often used her social media accounts to vent about Chelsea ( Image: Aurelien Meunier - PSG/PSG via Getty Images) Potter admitted that his side’s performance was not good enough against Southampton, but said that his side remain a work in progress with so many players yet to settle in following a hugely busy January transfer window. \"After a 1-0 defeat at home, any criticism you get is understandable,\" he said on Saturday. \"We've had a tough period and are integrating young players into the Premier League. When results don't go your way, it's tough. \"I'm not arrogant enough to say that their opinion isn't worth articulating. My job is to help the team and work through a team period.

That is good news for Wrexham , who are trying to get out of the National League under the ownership of Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. The pair have spent a small fortune since completing a takeover in November 2008, but to no avail. Wrexham finished second in the National League last season to qualify for the play-offs, where they lost to Grimsby . They are in the same position this time around - sitting five points behind leaders Notts County . Wrexham do have two games in hand, however. Birmingham City face points deduction after being charged for EFL breaches Boss of fan knocked out at West Ham vs Chelsea breaks silence on apprentice Parry was asked about the possibility of three promotion spots from the National League instead of just two during an interview with BBC Sport . The EFL boss admitted: \"We are having a lot of discussion about three up, three down. \"We absolutely recognise the need to look downwards as well as up. We have to be consistent in our approach. We haven't put proposals to our clubs yet, but do we envisage that being part of the package we put forward? Yes, 100 per cent.\" The EFL are looking to reform their competitions - including the Carabao Cup. The relevance of the competition has been questioned, with UEFA's president Aleksander Ceferin telling The Telegraph English football \"would not lose much if you lose that cup\". Ryan Reynolds owns Wrexham with fellow Hollywood star Rob McElhenney ( Image: PA) Do you think the EFL should change their promotion and relegation structure? Let us know in the comments below! The chances of the Carabao Cup being scrapped are slim after Parry defended the competition, although reform is a possibility. Manchester United take on Premier League rivals Newcastle in the final of the Carabao Cup at Wembley on Sunday. Parry added: \"Last year we had a record TV audience of four million for the Carabao Cup final... But of course we recognise there are challenges with the calendar. Are we prepared to have constructive dialogue, given those challenges? Yes, of course.\" Reynolds and McElhenney are desperate to take Wrexham out of the National League, as they look to establish the Welsh club near the top of the English pyramid. The National League is arguably the hardest division to win promotion from at this moment in time. Liverpool issue response to leaked report into Champions League final chaos European Super League branded \"a walking corpse\" as fans fume at new proposal Only one team is guaranteed automatic promotion, and there are some big clubs in the National League. The likes of Notts County, Chesterfield, Southend, York, Yeovil, Torquay, Scunthorpe and former Premier League club Oldham would all love a return to the EFL. Wrexham's challenge is apparent by Notts County's form. The Nottingham-based club have won six consecutive league games and already have 80 points, with 13 games remaining. In theory, Wrexham or Notts County could gain more than 100 points and stay down. \"We need to get out of this f****** league,\" ranted McElhenney after Wrexham's game against Aldershot in October 2021 was abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch. Wrexham players attempted to clear water off the pitch themselves.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:58:03","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article29269067.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1246648667.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"5 destinations for Lionel Messi as Paris Saint-Germain star closes in on summer exit","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lionel-messi-transfer-miami-barcelona-29268742","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Felix Keith)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain is set to expire at the end of June and the Argentina star has not yet decided whether to stay put or leave for another club","content":"Lionel Messi is facing a big decision in the coming months, with his current contract with Paris Saint-Germain set to expire at the end of June. Messi joined PSG on a two-year deal in August 2021 after his emotional departure from Barcelona came about due to financial reasons. The 35-year-old has formed a star-studded front line in France’s capital, playing alongside general talents Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, but it all might come to an end when the season finishes. There has been lots of speculation about Messi’s future since he played a starring role in Argentina’s World Cup win in December. Reports at the time stated he was considering the offer of a contract extension with PSG, but L’Equipe now says he is leaning towards leaving Paris. Lionel Messi saves PSG after Neymar stretchered off and sporting director took over mid-game Lionel Messi's father rates chances of son ever making Barcelona return His stunning free-kick in the 95th minute to earn a 4-3 win over Lille on the weekend showed just how important he is for Christophe Galtier’s side. But could they be about to lose him? Here Mirror Football takes a look at five possible destinations if Messi does decide to call it a day in France. Inter Miami The MLS franchise, who are part-owned by David Beckham and coached by Phil Neville, have made no secret of their desire to sign Messi. The Times have reported they are ‘confident’ of signing Messi and would give him a deal which would make him the highest-paid player in MLS history. Messi is known to be a fan of Miami as a place. He has holidayed there with his family on several occasions and the lifestyle clearly holds an allure. But is he willing to turn his back on the higher level of European football to move to the US? David Beckham wants to bring Lionel Messi to Inter Miami ( Image: Mark Brown/Getty Images) Barcelona Messi made it absolutely clear that he did not want to leave Barca in August 2021. “We were convinced we were continuing here, at home,\" he said as he unsuccessfully tried not to cry. \"I did all that I could to stay, because I wanted to stay.\" Barcelona is Messi’s home – and, despite all the financial troubles with the Catalan giants, there will always be a desire to bring the Argentine star back. The club would likely have to make sacrifices in other areas to bring Messi back, but it is possible he would be willing to take a significant pay cut to finish his career with the club where he scored 672 goals in 778 and lifted 35 trophies. HAVE YOUR SAY! Where would you like to see Lionel Messi go this summer if he leaves PSG? Comment below . Lionel Messi did not want to leave Barcelona in August 2021 ( Image: Marc Gonzalez Aloma/Getty Images) Manchester City PSG weren’t the only club linked with Messi in the summer of 2021. Pep Guardiola’s presence at Manchester City – and the club’s deep pockets – meant they were also earmarked as a potential destination. Guardiola has not been shy to shower praise on Messi, who worked wonders under his management at Barcelona. However, signing a soon-to-be 36-year-old would represent a departure from City’s strategy in the transfer market, no matter how good Messi is.

Ever since Ronaldo made the move to Riyadh there have been rumours that Messi could follow suit. Saudi Arabia is bidding to host the 2030 World Cup – and getting Messi on board as an ambassador is something the country would love to do. Mundo Deportivo reported recently that Al-Nassr’s rivals Al-Hillal would be willing to pay Messi a staggering £245m-a-year – a figure which would dwarf Ronaldo’s £177m per year pay cheque . That’s a tempting offer. Al-Hilal are keen on signing Lionel Messi this summer ( Image: KARIM JAAFAR/AFP via Getty Images) Lionel Messi is revered at Newell's Old Boys ( Image: Luciano Bisbal/Getty Images) Newell’s Old Boys \"The desire is always playing for Newell's – it is what I dreamed of as a kid,\" Messi told TyC Sports five years ago. \"When I went to the club I imagined playing in the Primera Division, but I do not know what's going to happen in a few years. I cannot say I'm going back because I do not know where I'm going to be.\" It is a romantic notion, returning to where it all began as a child before he moved to Barcelona, and it is one that could appeal to Messi now. After winning the World Cup – the last trophy he desired – Messi could up sticks and return to Argentina for a swansong before retirement.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:38:11","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article29268786.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1467976844.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rio Ferdinand reveals \"dramatic\" change at Man Utd training ground after visit","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-rio-ferdinand-training-29268837","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Thomas Bristow)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Manchester United are third in the Premier League and still in the running for four trophies under Erik ten Hag - and Rio Ferdinand can sense the mood change at the club","content":"Rio Ferdinand says the vibe at Manchester United's training base has dramatically shifted. The former United defender, winner of six Premier League titles, visited Carrington to interview Bruno Fernandes on Monday. While there, Ferdinand spoke to some of United's players, the staff and even took a gander through the building's corridors. What the 44-year-old noticed blew him away, as he believes the positivity he witnessed is of stark contrast to previous visits to the training ground. Ferdinand, like many United fans, will have lived through some bleak times. Louis van Gaal , Jose Mourinho , Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick failed to inspire the same way Erik ten Hag has, but few have had the opportunity to see things close up like the former England centre-back. Man Utd takeover: Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatar make same Glazer demand after bids Man Utd finally reach agreement with Alejandro Garnacho as final hurdle remains It seems that what is going on behind the scenes is on par with what United are achieving on the pitch. Under Ten Hag, United are still in the running for four trophies and sit third in the Premier League. The Dutchman is also getting the best out of a resurgent Marcus Rashford , who has recorded his best ever scoring season for United. All these positives are indicative of a good training base, where United spend the majority of their time. \"The vibes at Carrington and Old Trafford have changed dramatically,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube show, FIVE . \"It's become more positive, the ambience in the place. The cafeteria has even changed. It's like everything has changed. Looks different, feels different, food's different. The feeling when you walk in, I've had very negative vibes [in the past] when I've walked through the corridors of the training ground. Rio Ferdinand was pleased to see Kath is still going strong at Manchester United ( Image: Twitter@https://twitter.com/rioferdy5) Rio Ferdinand and Bruno Fernandes at Carrington ( Image: Twitter@https://twitter.com/rioferdy5) \"I was on my own, walking back out through the training ground, through the corridors, and I stood there and just smiled. I can sense something happening in here now. I don't what it is or where it's going to but the ambience is very different. There's a confidence in the place. \"And the confidence isn't about the players alone, it's the staff. I can sense something with the staff. They're more upbeat, happy to be in at work every day. And that's all been generated and created by Erik ten Hag and his management team and some people behind the scenes, because there's not one person who can change the whole culture of a football club - it's a collaborative approach. Man Utd takeover: Sir Jim Ratcliffe's bid hides crucial detail that gives Qatar edge Victor Lindelof speaks out on Man Utd players being distracted by takeover talks \"It's the right path right now and given they're in the running for four trophies still, not that I think they'll win four. It's nice to go to Carrington and Old Trafford and feel more optimistic than negative.\" He added: \"The vibe when they're out training, doing the rondos, there's a different energy that I haven't seen for a while, not that I've been there loads. Tweeting about his trip on Monday, Ferdinand said: \"Good being back at Carrington today...Great to see Kath - 56yrs at the club & still going strong!\"","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:36:53","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29268820.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_MAIN-MIRRORRIO.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Alex Cochrane on the sub mix-up that summed up Hearts’ dismal day","link":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/23334605.alex-cochrane-sub-mix-up-summed-hearts-dismal-day/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IT was a moment that rather summed up a terrible day at the office for Hearts.

Trailing Motherwell by two goals to nil, manager Robbie Neilson made a triple change in an attempt to inject some life into his uncharacteristically off-colour team. The trouble was that when the board went up, the wrong number was displayed, leading to full-back Alex Cochrane leaving the pitch behind the Motherwell goal and applauding the large travelling support as he trudged round to the dugout, only for striker Lawrence Shankland to eventually inform him he hadn’t been subbed off at all. In fairness to Cochrane, he admits that any one of the 10 outfield players could have been hooked during a desperately disappointing afternoon for the Jambos, with only goalkeeper Zander Clark perhaps emerging with any credit. READ MORE: Motherwell 2 Hearts 0: Kettlewell makes it two in a row \"That's something I've never seen before,” Cochrane said. “It summed up our day, I think. “My number did go up. They meant to put 29 up but 19 actually went up. I was oblivious to it, just walking off the pitch, and then I heard Shanks call my name to go back on. It's something I've never seen in football before - being subbed off then subbed back on again. \"It wasn't the best performance from us, we know that as a team and we spoke about it. We need to win these games if we want to be in that third position. It wasn't a good day for us. \"Motherwell make it tough whenever we come here. We were a bit slack with passing, everyone could have been a bit braver going forward, including myself. We all know we weren't at the races and we're all disappointed with the result. “We have to dust ourselves down and go again. We've got next weekend off, then we've got a big game against St Johnstone, then Celtic back-to-back. There are big games coming up for us.” The magnitude of those games has been heightened slightly further still by something of a resurgence in form on the other side of Edinburgh, with Hibernian remarkably now just five points behind their city rivals. READ MORE: Burrows details 'emotional' Motherwell exit after final Fir Park game Cochrane though says that any assumption Hearts already had third place sewn up has only been external, and that the poor showing at Fir Park was not a necessary wake-up call, denying that complacency had set in. \"I don't think so,” he said. “We've been on a good run and this was an off day. We can't be having any more of them. It wasn't our best performance and everyone in the dressing room knows that. \"We never thought third place was done and dusted, there are still plenty games to go in the season. “Yes, it's five points [to Hibs]. It's a gap but we need to make sure we keep that gap. We've got big games coming up, so we need to make sure we are right at it.” Unfortunately for Hearts though, they will be left to lick their wounds from the Motherwell defeat for an extended period, with no match this weekend due to the Viaplay Cup Final. Cochrane thinks that may be no bad thing though, affording them an opportunity to reset and get back to their old selves. “There will be a few days off so it's obviously a chance to recharge the batteries and go again in a couple of weeks' time,” he said. “It's a good chance to see where we are but we know that, on the training pitch, we need to put in the work. “We will speak about this game but as soon as that's done then we need to move on quickly - focus on ourselves and then hopefully the rest takes care of itself.”","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:30:00","image_url":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/16475899/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"heraldscotland","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Уотфорд - Уест Бромич 3:2 /репортаж/","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/anglia/multimedia/video/uotford-uest-bromich-32-reportazh-721518","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Уотфорд победи Уест Бромич Албиън с 3:2 у дома.

As the former West Brom manager put one over the club who sacked him in December 2020 in his first reunion with the Baggies, a madcap second half was settled by Ken Sema's fortuitous winner. Bilic will not give a pancake's toss that fortune smiled on him just enough to send the Hornets back into the play-off places in fifth. But whether your topping of choice is maple syrup, lemon and sugar or caramelised banana, none of your favourite Shrove Tuesday dishes will be as exotic as this thrilling recipe of mistakes. With just 36 points from his first 23 games in charge, the Croatian needs lashings of tempo, verve and bravery to win a ticket to the £180million Championship play-offs lottery. Conor Townsend equalised for West Brom for the first time in the 56th minute ( Image: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images) And after 23 minutes of shadow boxing, Watford suddenly found the right mixture. When Darnell Furlong could only half-block a Keinan Davis shot on the turn from close range, Baggies keeper Josh Griffiths pushed it into Sema's path and the Swedish winger lifted his third goal of the season into the roof of the net. If the home side's breakthrough scored low marks for artistic merit, Albion's contribution to it was a mess. Griffiths fared better with a sprawling save to deny Davis when the on-loan Aston Villa striker was clean through after more negligent defending. But apart from Brandon Thomas-Asante's stooping header wide at the near post, Albion offered little going forward and they were booed off at the break. Boss Carlos Corberan responded with a double change, hooking England one-cap wonder Nathaniel Chalobah, who struggled on his return to Vicarage Road, and his reshuffle worked a treat within 11 minutes. Will Watford make the play-offs? Have your say in the comments! Slaven Bilic is under pressure but Watford's play-off hopes were boosted with victory over West Brom ( Image: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images) Daniel Bachmann made a fine save to deny John Swift, but within seconds Conor Townsend prodded the equaliser from close range after substitute Jason Molumby's mishit shot bounced kindly for him six yards out. Ismaila Sarr was inches away from restoring Watford's lead within a minutes, clipping the post after bursting into the box on his left foot. The Senegal winger was on target 11 minutes later with a crisp finish from 12 yards, his ninth bullseye of the campaign, but the Hornets' joy didn't last. Bachmann's attempt to play out from the back was rumbled and Jed Wallace – who was offside – rolled home from 12 yards, seconds after Sema had been denied by a linesman's flag at the other end. But providence was kinder to King Ken, as he is known in these parts, with 12 minutes left as his angled shot took a big deflection off Erik Pieters to make it 3-2.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 22:15:43","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29268858.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1468018885.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}]}
