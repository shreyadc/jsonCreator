But Evans - who earned his 100th cap in what proved to be Ian Baraclough's final game in charge in Greece - has not played for Leicester since before the World Cup, suffering with a calf injury and more recently a thigh strain.

But while those two count as stalwarts, O'Neill has had to bring in four uncapped players in a youthful 26-man group for his return due to the considerable number of injuries he is dealing with. Davis, 38, suffered a double ACL tear in December, while faint hopes that Dallas, out with a broken leg suffered last season, might return in time for this window have been dashed. With Corry Evans and McCann also missing, O'Neill is without four midfield regulars and so has called in Everton's Isaac Price, Motherwell' s Sean Goss and Oostende midfielder Cameron McGeehan. Bolton defender Eoin Toal is the fourth new face. Former Rangers loan star Goss and McGeehan are both 27 and did receive senior calls in 2018 during O'Neill's first stint, but each had to withdraw through injury. Price, 19, made his Premier League debut for Everton last season, while Toal, 24, is a former under-21s captain.

Arteta will not take any risks with Jesus in their last 16 first leg away to Sporting – instead using this as a chance to re-integrate his star striker further in training sessions. It is also unlikely Jesus will be in the match day squad to face Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday. If all goes well, Arsenal potentially see the first game back from the international break as a chance to use him from the bench – the home outing against Leeds on April 1.

The Spurs manager has missed the past four games as he took extra time off to recover from gall-bladder surgery and his assistant, Cristian Stellini, has been taking the reins. During his time away, a pair of 2-0 wins against West Ham and Chelsea suggested Tottenham were on course to clinch a top-four place in the Premier League. But that optimism faded after a dismal 1-0 loss at second-tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round and a drab league defeat by the same score at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. Spurs will be seeking to get back to winning ways on Wednesday, as they hope to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Milan. “Now I’m back and I’m really happy,” said Conte. “We want to go to the next round and for tomorrow I hope to feel an amazing atmosphere in our stadium as our fans give us a major boost. “I repeat that I have to stay with the players and breathe the atmosphere of the training ground. Now I’m well, my feeling is good. I try to transfer my energy to my players. It’s an important game for us.” The 53-year-old also urged his team not to be too affected by recent poor results. “It’s important to not look too much back. We have a very important game tomorrow. We have to be positive. We needed to learn from the negatives,” he said. “I hope that if we have another negative game the players learn because you can learn a lot from defeats. After wins you are happy but after defeats you can learn.” Whatever happens in the Champions League, Spurs are sitting in fourth place in the Premier League but at risk of an anti-climactic end to the season, being hunted down by a rejuvenated Liverpool, who trail by three points with a game in hand. They are still without a major trophy since their League Cup win in 2008 and even a manager of Conte’s pedigree has been unable to break that long drought. There are signs that he will leave as he has yet to sign an extension to a contract that expires at the end of this season, but the Spurs boss did not comment on his future. For now, his focus will be on Wednesday. Tottenham will be without long-term injury absentees Ryan Sessegnon, Hugo Lloris, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, while Eric Dier is suspended. Milan are aiming to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign. Like Spurs, the Italians also head into the clash following a defeat, a 2-1 loss to Fiorentina. “The (Fiorentina) performance won’t influence us, just as Tottenham’s two consecutive defeats won’t influence them. It is a very important match for both teams, we will both play to the best of our abilities,” said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. Just two wins from their last eight away games is a concern, and Brahim Diaz – the scorer in the first leg – is a doubt following a knee sprain.

But Evans - who earned his 100th cap in what proved to be Ian Baraclough's final game in charge in Greece - has not played for Leicester since before the World Cup, suffering with a calf injury and more recently a thigh strain.

But while those two count as stalwarts, O'Neill has had to bring in four uncapped players in a youthful 26-man group for his return due to the considerable number of injuries he is dealing with. Davis, 38, suffered a double ACL tear in December, while faint hopes that Dallas, out with a broken leg suffered last season, might return in time for this window have been dashed. With Corry Evans and McCann also missing, O'Neill is without four midfield regulars and so has called in Everton's Isaac Price, Motherwell' s Sean Goss and Oostende midfielder Cameron McGeehan. Bolton defender Eoin Toal is the fourth new face. Former Rangers loan star Goss and McGeehan are both 27 and did receive senior calls in 2018 during O'Neill's first stint, but each had to withdraw through injury. Price, 19, made his Premier League debut for Everton last season, while Toal, 24, is a former under-21s captain. With the likes of Shea Charles and Dale Taylor also included, there is certainly a younger feel to this squad. \"I certainly sense the senior players are excited about the campaign and that's important because they drive anything,\" O'Neill said. \"It's a blow to have players unavailable, particularly Stuart and Steven and Corry with longer-term injuries. \"We have to find that excitement without those players for the time being.\" Keep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page","pubDate":"2023-03-07 14:03:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"thescottishsun","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gabriel Jesus to travel with Arsenal squad to Sporting Lisbon in huge boost to Arteta after three months out","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/10327668/gabriel-jesus-injury-arsenal-sporting-lisbon-arteta/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Premier League"],"creator":["Jordan Davies"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"GABRIEL JESUS is expected to travel to Portugal with the Arsenal squad for their Europa League clash with Sporting Lisbon.

And SunSport understands Jesus’ progress means he is likely to fly out to Lisbon on Wednesday to take the next step in his rehabilitation. Arteta will not take any risks with Jesus in their last 16 first leg away to Sporting – instead using this as a chance to re-integrate his star striker further in training sessions. It is also unlikely Jesus will be in the match day squad to face Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday. If all goes well, Arsenal potentially see the first game back from the international break as a chance to use him from the bench – the home outing against Leeds on April 1.

He has created 121 chances to Osimhen's 46. And he has had more touches inside the opposition penalty area.

The Spurs manager has missed the past four games as he took extra time off to recover from gall-bladder surgery and his assistant, Cristian Stellini, has been taking the reins. During his time away, a pair of 2-0 wins against West Ham and Chelsea suggested Tottenham were on course to clinch a top-four place in the Premier League. But that optimism faded after a dismal 1-0 loss at second-tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round and a drab league defeat by the same score at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. Spurs will be seeking to get back to winning ways on Wednesday, as they hope to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Milan. “Now I’m back and I’m really happy,” said Conte. “We want to go to the next round and for tomorrow I hope to feel an amazing atmosphere in our stadium as our fans give us a major boost. “I repeat that I have to stay with the players and breathe the atmosphere of the training ground. Now I’m well, my feeling is good. I try to transfer my energy to my players. It’s an important game for us.” The 53-year-old also urged his team not to be too affected by recent poor results. “It’s important to not look too much back. We have a very important game tomorrow. We have to be positive. We needed to learn from the negatives,” he said. “I hope that if we have another negative game the players learn because you can learn a lot from defeats. After wins you are happy but after defeats you can learn.” Whatever happens in the Champions League, Spurs are sitting in fourth place in the Premier League but at risk of an anti-climactic end to the season, being hunted down by a rejuvenated Liverpool, who trail by three points with a game in hand. They are still without a major trophy since their League Cup win in 2008 and even a manager of Conte’s pedigree has been unable to break that long drought. There are signs that he will leave as he has yet to sign an extension to a contract that expires at the end of this season, but the Spurs boss did not comment on his future. For now, his focus will be on Wednesday. Tottenham will be without long-term injury absentees Ryan Sessegnon, Hugo Lloris, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, while Eric Dier is suspended. Milan are aiming to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign. Like Spurs, the Italians also head into the clash following a defeat, a 2-1 loss to Fiorentina. “The (Fiorentina) performance won’t influence us, just as Tottenham’s two consecutive defeats won’t influence them. It is a very important match for both teams, we will both play to the best of our abilities,” said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. Just two wins from their last eight away games is a concern, and Brahim Diaz – the scorer in the first leg – is a doubt following a knee sprain.

But while those two count as stalwarts, O'Neill has had to bring in four uncapped players in a youthful 26-man group for his return due to the considerable number of injuries he is dealing with. Davis, 38, suffered a double ACL tear in December, while faint hopes that Dallas, out with a broken leg suffered last season, might return in time for this window have been dashed. With Corry Evans and McCann also missing, O'Neill is without four midfield regulars and so has called in Everton's Isaac Price, Motherwell' s Sean Goss and Oostende midfielder Cameron McGeehan. Bolton defender Eoin Toal is the fourth new face. Former Rangers loan star Goss and McGeehan are both 27 and did receive senior calls in 2018 during O'Neill's first stint, but each had to withdraw through injury. Price, 19, made his Premier League debut for Everton last season, while Toal, 24, is a former under-21s captain. With the likes of Shea Charles and Dale Taylor also included, there is certainly a younger feel to this squad. \"I certainly sense the senior players are excited about the campaign and that's important because they drive anything,\" O'Neill said. \"It's a blow to have players unavailable, particularly Stuart and Steven and Corry with longer-term injuries. \"We have to find that excitement without those players for the time being.\" Keep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page","pubDate":"2023-03-07 14:03:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"thescottishsun","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gabriel Jesus to travel with Arsenal squad to Sporting Lisbon in huge boost to Arteta after three months out","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/10327668/gabriel-jesus-injury-arsenal-sporting-lisbon-arteta/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Premier League"],"creator":["Jordan Davies"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"GABRIEL JESUS is expected to travel to Portugal with the Arsenal squad for their Europa League clash with Sporting Lisbon.

And SunSport understands Jesus’ progress means he is likely to fly out to Lisbon on Wednesday to take the next step in his rehabilitation. Arteta will not take any risks with Jesus in their last 16 first leg away to Sporting – instead using this as a chance to re-integrate his star striker further in training sessions. It is also unlikely Jesus will be in the match day squad to face Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday. If all goes well, Arsenal potentially see the first game back from the international break as a chance to use him from the bench – the home outing against Leeds on April 1.

The Spurs manager has missed the past four games as he took extra time off to recover from gall-bladder surgery and his assistant, Cristian Stellini, has been taking the reins. During his time away, a pair of 2-0 wins against West Ham and Chelsea suggested Tottenham were on course to clinch a top-four place in the Premier League. But that optimism faded after a dismal 1-0 loss at second-tier Sheffield United in the FA Cup fifth round and a drab league defeat by the same score at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. Spurs will be seeking to get back to winning ways on Wednesday, as they hope to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Milan. “Now I’m back and I’m really happy,” said Conte. “We want to go to the next round and for tomorrow I hope to feel an amazing atmosphere in our stadium as our fans give us a major boost. “I repeat that I have to stay with the players and breathe the atmosphere of the training ground. Now I’m well, my feeling is good. I try to transfer my energy to my players. It’s an important game for us.” The 53-year-old also urged his team not to be too affected by recent poor results. “It’s important to not look too much back. We have a very important game tomorrow. We have to be positive. We needed to learn from the negatives,” he said. “I hope that if we have another negative game the players learn because you can learn a lot from defeats. After wins you are happy but after defeats you can learn.” Whatever happens in the Champions League, Spurs are sitting in fourth place in the Premier League but at risk of an anti-climactic end to the season, being hunted down by a rejuvenated Liverpool, who trail by three points with a game in hand. They are still without a major trophy since their League Cup win in 2008 and even a manager of Conte’s pedigree has been unable to break that long drought. There are signs that he will leave as he has yet to sign an extension to a contract that expires at the end of this season, but the Spurs boss did not comment on his future. For now, his focus will be on Wednesday. Tottenham will be without long-term injury absentees Ryan Sessegnon, Hugo Lloris, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, while Eric Dier is suspended. Milan are aiming to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign. Like Spurs, the Italians also head into the clash following a defeat, a 2-1 loss to Fiorentina. “The (Fiorentina) performance won’t influence us, just as Tottenham’s two consecutive defeats won’t influence them. It is a very important match for both teams, we will both play to the best of our abilities,” said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. Just two wins from their last eight away games is a concern, and Brahim Diaz – the scorer in the first leg – is a doubt following a knee sprain.
