Players who took part in the SANFL finals campaign have been given an extra week and will start their pre-season campaigns next Monday. McAsey was in that group but on the eve of pre-season the Crows announced that the 21-year-old had been granted personal leave. Crows Head of Football Adam Kelly said the club was understanding of McAsey’s circumstances and he was not expected to return until after the Christmas break.“We are fully supportive of Fischer taking personal leave and we will give him the time and space that he requires,” Kelly said.“We will remain in regular communication with him, as well as his management, to ensure he has ongoing support while away from the club.“As always, the welfare of our people is the top priority and we ask that Fischer’s privacy be respected during this period.”When he was selected with the sixth pick of the 2019 draft, McAsey was at the time the Crows’ highest ever draft pick. He played 10 games in his debut season, but hasn’t played at AFL level since. In the 2021 pre-season his father, Chris, had a major health scare while McAsey was back home in Melbourne for the first time in months due to coronavirus travel limitations. He signed a two-year contract extension in April 2021 after speculation that he would look for a move back to Victoria. He played 18 SANFL games last season and finished eighth in the Crows’ state-league best-and-fairest in 2021.But McAsey suffered another setback when he sustained a stress fracture in his femur in December 2021, which sidelined him for six weeks. When he returned via the SANFL he was shifted forward in an attempt by the Crows for him to find some form. He then revealed to TV crews that he had been in discussions about a move back to Melbourne. But nothing eventuated during the trade period and Crows list manager Justin Reid told News Corp in September that a full pre-season would do McAsey the world of good. “I guess being a high draft pick there is also high expectations, but we feel like we have the program around Fischer and his off-season and pre-season will dictate the season he has next year,” he said. But for the third year in a row McAsey will have an interrupted pre-season, ahead of the final year of his contract.","pubDate":"2022-11-20 06:16:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The numbers behind hosting a football world cup","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/the-numbers-behind-hosting-a-football-world-cup/articleshow/95635438.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Qatar has spent comfortably over $200 billion preparing for the tournament, which has been accompanied by controversy since day 1.

Karim Benzema published the news of his exclusion from the 2022 World Cup with an impressive message in his official account on the “Instagram” website, after the injury he sustained during the training of the Rooster Battalion: “In my life I have never given up, but tonight I have to think about the team as I always do, so I was told To leave my place for someone who can help the national team achieve a great achievement in the World Cup .. Thank you all for the messages of support.” The French Football Federation confirmed that player Karim Benzema underwent MRI medical examinations in a hospital in Doha, which proved that Benzema had a muscle tear in the femoral rectum. The French national team striker will need a recovery period of at least 3 weeks, to become outside the accounts of coach Didier Deschamps in the World Cup, after he had been absent from Real Madrid for a while during the current season, due to injury and muscle fatigue as well. It is noteworthy that Karim Benzema did not participate in the previous edition of the World Cup with the French national team, which was crowned with the title led by its young star Kylian Mbappe, after defeating the Croatian national team in the final match.

But he is treading down a path of Sepp Blatterism; where he forgets his role and thinks he can solve the world’s geopolitical and cultural problems.At least that’s one conclusion to draw from his farcical suggestion of pitching North Korea as a Women’s World Cup host – alongside South Korea.“Football brings people together. If we want to organise an event in North Korea, I actually went to North Korea some years ago to ask if they were ready to host part of a Women’s World Cup with South Korea,” he added.“I was not successful, obviously. But I’m still convinced… This particular World Cup will help to open the eyes of the world.”Infantino, who is confirmed to be running unopposed for the FIFA presidency again next year, implored critics to leave Qatar alone and to direct all fury at him. And he may get his wish over the next 24 hours.“If you want to criticise someone, criticise me, I am here, crucify me. Don’t criticise Qatar. Criticise FIFA, criticise me,” he said.And so, after an incredible performance, Infantino finished his 55-minute rant perhaps the way he should’ve started it.“Now, onto the World Cup…”","pubDate":"2022-11-20 05:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"FIFA WC 2022 | Salient features of stadiums; Floating hotels!","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/fifa-wc-2022-salient-features-of-stadiums-floating-hotels/","keywords":["Sports","FIFA WC 2022","FIFA World Cup","Football World Cup","qatar","Stadiums","World Cup Soccer"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"8 stadiums have been built within a distance of 55 km around Doha, the capital city of Qatar for the World Cup football series.

Our players are no different. They have been getting together in reasonable size groups and working hard together. From what we have seen already for guys coming through the Hangar, they are in good shape and they will be able to hit the ground running tomorrow,” Mahoney said.“That trip was a long time ago now, so they have had that time, and now had a solid block of six to eight weeks of training with an off-season program. There is not much time, only four weeks before the Christmas break so every training session is important for us and the players are really clear that is our mindset going into this pre-season.”Jye Caldwell had AC joint surgery post-season but will join in full training before Christmas, with James Stewart (foot) and Tex Wanganeen (navicular) the only two other players who will not be at full pace immediately upon their return.Dyson Heppell could give up the captaincy after signing on again for another season but Mahoney said the club hadn’t worked through that process.“It’s probably something we will look at through the pre-season period. We haven’t had any discussions with Dyson about it. He is our captain and we have a good group of players around him that help out, but it will bea focus for us across our playing group to improve our leadership capabilities, and it’s not just going to fall on our captain.”Mahoney said new coach Scott would work on his game style across summer to marry it with the list’s strengths, but was aware of the need to prioritise contest work and the club’s defence.“Brad is taking time to work out our list, what our strengths are as a team and it will evolve over the pre-season,” he said.“We think when we do play offensively we are naturally a very effective team going forward. “We had some work to do defensively, but we think a balanced approach and improving around the contest is going to be important for us and making sure we still have the flair in offence, but also strengthening up our defence.”","pubDate":"2022-11-20 04:17:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"USC vs. UCLA score: Live game updates, college football scores, NCAA top 25 highlights today - CBS Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy91c2MtdnMtdWNsYS1zY29yZS1saXZlLWdhbWUtdXBkYXRlcy1jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLXNjb3Jlcy1uY2FhLXRvcC0yNS1oaWdobGlnaHRzLXRvZGF5L2xpdmUv0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9uZXdzL3VzYy12cy11Y2xhLXNjb3JlLWxpdmUtZ2FtZS11cGRhdGVzLWNvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwtc2NvcmVzLW5jYWEtdG9wLTI1LWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtdG9kYXkvbGl2ZS9hbXAv?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"USC vs. UCLA score: Live game updates, college football scores, NCAA top 25 highlights today  CBS SportsUCLA vs. USC Game Day  CBS Los AngelesGame Prediction: #7 USC Trojans at #16 UCLA Bruins  Sports IllustratedUSC, UCLA football rivalry squaring off in Los Angeles  KTLA 5Men's Water Polo - USC 12, UCLA 11: Highlights (11/19/22)  USCAthletics","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-20 04:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Latham’s anger over Zelic’s World Cup claim","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/football/world-cup/mark-latham-takes-a-swipe-over-lucy-zelics-world-cup-comment/news-story/5a2fe7e91360ddf97755a989f0ca1066","keywords":["Football","Sport news and galleries","World Cup"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mark Latham has taken an extraordinary, unprovoked swipe at Australian football commentator Lucy Zelic hours before the World Cup opening ceremony.","content":"The former SBS TV host on Sunday revealed her reservations about the Qatar World Cup, an event that has become one of the most divisive sporting events in recent memory.The popular football analyst posted on Twitter her discomfort at celebrating the event, which has been largely overshadowed by widespread protests and condemnation of the host nation’s human rights abuses. The former Labor MP turned One Nation MLC responded by suggesting Zelic should not be politicising the World Cup. The horse has already bolted — long ago.The Socceroos have stuck their necks out in Qatar after being the first national team to make a unanimous statement of condemnation of the World Cup host earlier this year.With the World Cup opening ceremony beginning on Monday morning AEDT and with the Socceroos just days away from their 2022 World Cup opener against France on November 23 at 6am AEDT — the debate about saying ‘Nup to the Cup’ is raging.

Start your free trial now >Zelic says it “would feel weird to act like a cheerleader” as the world’s most watched sporting event kicks off. “On the eve of the FIFA World Cup I wanted to wish all the competing nations + administrators great success, but it’s been such an unsettling build-up to this tournament, which has been plagued by unnecessary tragedy + controversy that it would feel weird to act like a cheerleader,” she wrote on Twitter.“When your sport is built on the fundamental belief that every nation, player, man, woman or child is welcome to participate in it - your organisation, and who you entrust to represent those beliefs, damn-well better reflect that. “So, whilst I’ll still watch my beloved teams and admire the football, I’ll also be thinking of the families who lost loved ones and ask why it had to come to this. @FIFAcom we want it to be about the football but YOU choose to make it about everything else.”Her comment referenced the fact Qatar’s $A470 billion construction extravaganza for the tournament came at the cost of an estimated 6500 construction workers’ lives.Qatar was controversially awarded the rights to host the biggest sporting event on the planet in 2010 despite a lack of facilities and the prospect of playing the tournament in hot desert conditions. That is just the tip of the iceberg.Homosexuality is also illegal in Qatar and Muslims found breaking the strict Islamic law can face the death penalty. Latham responded to Zelic’s tweet by saying: “Get a grip, it’s just a game of soccer”.He also responded to one of her tweets by writing: “If you want to turn soccer into politics, at least have the courage to put your name on a ballot paper”. FIFA Sweep No-oddsFootball icon David Beckham has been repeatedly criticised this month over his mega-rich deal as an ambassador for the host nation and the tournament. The former England and Manchester United star has signed a 10-year deal worth a reported $A266 million to promote the World Cup and its host nation Qatar.Socceroos great Craig Foster this week slammed Beckham over the Arab nation’s discrimination against gay people and women, as well as its human rights record.“Not saying anything about the criminalisation of the LGBTI community in Qatar is absolutely horrendous,” Foster said.“He’s been called on by various people in the UK to change his stance. I hope he does.“His incredible brand known all around the world... he actually has an opportunity to try and create significant impact and even change there in Qatar, so I hope he uses it.”The Socceroos also earned plenty of praise from around the world for its powerful statement in the lead up to the tournament.Sixteen players read lines from a collective statement calling for an “effective remedy” to Qatar’s human rights issues.“Addressing these issues is not easy. And we do not have all the answers,” the Australian players said.“We stand with FIFPro, the Building and Wood Workers International, and the International Trade Union Confederation, seeking to embed reforms and establish a lasting legacy in Qatar. This must include establishing a migrant resource centre, effective remedy for those who have been denied their rights, and the decriminalisation of all same-sex relationships.“These are the basic rights that should be afforded to all and will ensure continued progress in Qatar … [and] a legacy that goes well beyond the final whistle of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.”","pubDate":"2022-11-20 03:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"22nd World Cup Football | A sensational start in Qatar today – Qatar vs Ecuador clash in the first match","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/22nd-world-cup-football-a-sensational-start-in-qatar-today-qatar-vs-ecuador-clash-in-the-first-match/","keywords":["Sports","FIFA","FIFA World Cup","Football","Football World Cup","qatar","World Cup"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Toga: FIFA’s 22nd FIFA World Cup kicks off with a bang today in Qatar.

There is no bad blood between me and Chanel.“We talked after the game and we know there is all love there. It was honestly a genuine freak accident. “I never want anyone to get injured on the field like that, especially knockouts. Two of my great mates in Jackie Friend and Boyd Cordner, it has ruined their careers. “So I never want to injure anyone. That was not my intention at all. So anyone I have upset, anyone in his family, anyone in the Samoan community that I have upset, I am genuinely sorry for that because it was not my intention.“I am looking forward to hanging out with him. I want to get the message across and I want to let his family know that I am genuinely sorry, I want to let the Samoan community know that there was no malice in it.”Parish was ropable that Crichton was allowed to return to the action, taking aim at referee Ashley Klein.“Five minutes into the second half our hooker gets elbowed in the head and gets carted off,” Parish said.“The referee makes a weak decision and puts him in the bin. Dumfounded.”Asked whether it was a poor decision, Parish said: “An elbow to the head and the hooker gets taken out of the game. What do you think.”If Crichton is charged by the match review committee, he is likely to miss the start of next for the Sydney Roosters. Samoan captain Junior Paulo was comfortable with the decision.“Knowing Angus Crichton, I have been playing [against] him for a while now, it is probably not in his game,” Paulo said.“So it is what it is.”Told of Parish’s comments, Australian coach Mal Meninga said:“My view is that he should have stayed on the field, that’s just silly”. Crichton was thankful to Paulo for the support.“Obviously I have known Junior a long time and I am great mates with Junior,” Crichton said.“It is all love between me and Chanel.He knows whenever I play football, I don’t try to injure anyone or try to hurt anyone. I know I am a good person.“I play the game the way the game is meant to be played.”Despite his troubles in the final, Crichton emerged from the World Cup with his reputation enhanced after playing a prominent role for the Kangaroos throughout the tournament.“It is amazing,” he said.“To be over on the other side of the world in front of my mum and dad, it was an amazing experience.“I loved every moment for sure. It has been a huge honour to be able to represent Australia. To play under Mal (Meninga) has given me a lot of confidence.“Obviously today wasn’t the game that I planned on playing but it was the game that occurred and I am just happy we came away with the win.“It was a great moment in my career.”","pubDate":"2022-11-20 01:31:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"College football picks, schedule: Predictions against the spread, odds for top 25 games in Week 12 - CBS Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvbmV3cy9jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLXBpY2tzLXNjaGVkdWxlLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLWFnYWluc3QtdGhlLXNwcmVhZC1vZGRzLWZvci10b3AtMjUtZ2FtZXMtaW4td2Vlay0xMi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"College football picks, schedule: Predictions against the spread, odds for top 25 games in Week 12  CBS SportsView Full Coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-20 01:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Photo shows heartbreak for 68 million people","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/football/world-cup/worlds-best-players-world-cup-campaign-is-suddenly-finished/news-story/199f6224fadbb003aa4fdb5780910bda","keywords":["Football","Socceroos","Sport news and galleries","World Cup"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"France’s hopes of successfully defending the World Cup were dealt a huge blow on Sunday morning AEDT as Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema was ruled out of the tournament in Qatar with an injured left thigh.","content":"The 34-year-old Real Madrid striker had been struggling with the injury for some time and had played less than half an hour of football in his club’s last six games before the World Cup.On Saturday, he took part in full training for the first time since the World Cup holders gathered last week ahead of the tournament.Photos captured the moment Benzema was seen struggling during the session.He was forced to withdraw from the session at the home stadium of Qatari champions Al Sadd with the injury and was taken for tests.The French Football Federation (FFF) later said in a statement that the injury “will require a recovery period of three weeks”, ruling out any prospect of him being fully fit for the tournament which finishes on December 18.“I am extremely sad for Karim, for whom this World Cup was a major objective,” France coach Didier Deschamps was quoted as saying in the FFF statement.“Despite this new blow for the France team I have full faith in my squad. We will do all we can to rise to the huge challenge that awaits us.” Confirming his withdrawal, Benzema stated: “In my life I have never given up, but tonight I have to think about the team as I have always done.“So reason tells me to leave my place to someone who can help our squad have a good World Cup.“Thank you for all your messages of support.”It is a hammer blow for the team and the nation of 68 million people. The 36-year-old Olivier Giroud is set to benefit from Benzema’s absence by coming into the France attack alongside Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann.However, under FIFA rules Deschamps can still call up a replacement for an injured player until Monday, on the eve of their first game.France begin their defence of the trophy on Tuesday, when they take on Australia in Al Wakrah.They will also play Denmark and Tunisia in Group D as they aim to become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to retain the World Cup.Benzema’s injury is a major blow for Deschamps, whose preparations for the tournament had already been hampered by fitness problems.France have come to Qatar without the key duo of Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante, their starting midfield pairing from the successful 2018 World Cup campaign, who were both ruled out due to injury before Deschamps named his squad.Back-up goalkeeper Mike Maignan and centre-back Presnel Kimpembe also withdrew before RB Leipzig forward Christopher Nkunku had to pull out after suffering a knee injury in France’s final training session before departing for Qatar.Nkunku was replaced in the squad by Eintracht Frankfurt forward Randal Kolo Muani.Manchester United defender Raphael Varane has also been struggling to prove his fitness since coming off in tears with a leg injury in a game against Chelsea on October 22.Benzema, who will turn 35 next month, had targeted the World Cup to cap off a remarkable career renaissance.He won the Ballon d’Or after scoring 44 goals in 46 games for Real Madrid last season as the Spanish club won the Champions League and La Liga.Benzema had previously been frozen out of the France team for five-and-a-half years because of his involvement in a blackmail scandal over a sex tape involving his former teammate Mathieu Valbuena.That saw him miss France’s victorious 2018 World Cup campaign and led to him being handed a one-year suspended prison sentence as well as a fine of 75,000 euros.On winning the Ballon d’Or he said: “There are things that are still left to be done. I hope to be in the squad for Qatar, to go to the World Cup and do everything to win it.”","pubDate":"2022-11-20 01:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"3 takeaways from BYU football’s win over Utah Tech","link":"https://www.deseret.com/2022/11/19/23468531/3-takeaways-from-byu-football-win-over-utah-tech","keywords":null,"creator":["Brandon Judd"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"BYU Cougars wide receiver Chase Roberts (27) makes a catch under pressure from Utah Tech cornerback Antonio Mayes (12) and runs the ball in for a touchdown to put the Cougars up 14-13 after the PAT during the game at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo on Saturday, Nov. 19, 2022.Spenser Heaps, Deseret News BYU’s home finale ended the way it was expected to, with the Cougars earning a 52-26 victory over FCS opponent Utah Tech.The Trailblazers, though, kept the game close for perhaps longer than many expected before BYU put the game away in the second half. Related Highlights, key plays and photos from BYU’s 52-26 win over Utah Tech Here are three takeaways from the Cougars’ sixth win of the season, which clinched bowl eligibility for them.It wasn’t always clean, but it was enough Utah Tech spent a good portion of the first half with a lead before BYU went ahead for good with just over five minutes until halftime. Even then, it was a one-score game midway through the third quarter.But the Cougars scored 31 straight points at one point to finally put the game away, and they relied on their passing game to fuel their offense until late in the second half, when their rush attack started putting up yards.BYU finished with 676 yards of total offense, including a career-best 456 passing yards from Jaren Hall. Hall, who went over 3,000 passing yards on the season with Saturday’s effort, accounted for six total touchdowns — five passing and one rushing — to go with one interception.  You heard it here!

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News 19 of 19 BYU’s defense shut things down after a wobbly first half The halftime stats for Utah Tech looked scary for the BYU defense: The Trailblazers had 277 yards of total offense in the first two quarters, including 208 passing yards from Victor Gabalis.Utah Tech had benefited from long passes of 54 yards and 80 yards (a touchdown) when the Cougars’ secondary suffered breakdowns in coverage.That all led to a 28-20 game, with BYU leading, when the two teams went into the half. Utah Tech led by six three different times in the first half.In the second half, though, the Cougars finally put the clamps on a high-scoring Utah Tech offense that helped the Trailblazers enter Provo on a three-game winning streak.BYU forced Utah Tech to punt on six straight possessions in the second half — that included four three-and-outs — before the Trailblazers scored a late touchdown with the game well in hand. .@kalanifsitake has to say some goodbyes 😥#GoCougs | #BYUFOOTBALL pic.twitter.com/MX1iCWnerl— BYU Sports Nation (@BYUSportsNation) November 20, 2022 There are things to fix for sure: Utah Tech had 420 yards of total offense, including 350 yards passing from Gabalis, who finished with three touchdowns and one interception.The Cougars gave up two 100-yard receivers — Deven Osborne had three catches for 138 yards and a touchdown, while Joey Hobert added 11 receptions for 100 yards and two scores.BYU also had another game in which it failed to register a sack, and the Cougars struggled getting pressure on the QB for too much of the day.BYU allowed Utah Tech to convert just 4 of 16 third downs, though, and gave up just 3.8 yards per carry.After a scary first half, the second half at least gave some hope for BYU’s final two games of the season. BYU is bowl eligible It was closer than expected for a good portion of the game, but BYU got to bowl eligibility with its sixth win of the season and second straight.Getting bowl eligible didn’t seem like a certainty during the program’s four-game losing streak in October.The extra practices afforded for bowl prep will be beneficial for the Cougars as they prepare to join the Big 12 Conference next season.BYU will wrap up the regular season with a game at the Pac-12’s Stanford, and going into the day, the Cougars were a slight favorite for that matchup, according to ESPN’s Football Power Index.","pubDate":"2022-11-20 01:01:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian man's flag attack leaves Portugal fans enraged","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1011771-indian-man-s-flag-attack-leaves-portugal-fans-enraged","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: An Indian man has been arrested after upsetting his football-mad neighbours by tearing up a Portugal flag, hoisted for the World Cup, when he mistook it for the emblem of a controversial Islamist group.Social media footage showed Deepak Elangode pulling the flag off its hoisting and...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-20 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Infantino lambasts 'hypocrites'","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1011770-infantino-lambasts-hypocrites","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"DOHA: Two weeks after FIFA urged the 32 teams at the World Cup to “focus on the football”, Gianni Infantino veered off-script on Saturday.Nothing was off limits as the most powerful man in football vented his frustration in a 1hr 1min tirade that encompassed 3,000 years of history, the...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-20 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Iowa's win over Minnesota creates clear path for Big Ten West repeat - Des Moines Register","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvaW93YS9mb290YmFsbC8yMDIyLzExLzIwL2lvd2EtZm9vdGJhbGwtbWlubmVzb3RhLWhhd2tleWVzLWJpZy10ZW4td2VzdC1zdGFuZGluZ3MtamFjay1jYW1wYmVsbC82OTY2MTU3NzAwNy_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Iowa's win over Minnesota creates clear path for Big Ten West repeat  Des Moines RegisterIowa vs. Minnesota - Game Recap - November 19, 2022  ESPNIowa at Minnesota | Highlights | Big Ten Football | Nov. 19, 2022  Big Ten NetworkIowa kicks late field goal to beat Gophers 13-10, claim Floyd of Rosedale for eighth straight time  Star TribuneIowa 13, Minnesota 10: Close Shave November  Black Heart Gold Pants","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-20 00:34:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Getting nasty: Which club is leaking to headquarters?","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/nrl/whats-the-buzz-paul-gallen-demoted-in-farewell-fight-the-rat-in-nrl-club-ranks/news-story/1cf1c652077fe4153cfed845b0bff108","keywords":["NRL News"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NRL clubs are almost back to being normal.","content":"The feeling of solidarity in the funding dispute with the NRL is fast disappearing.Half the clubs now want to accept the NRL’s latest offer, the other half don’t.It’s getting nasty behind the scenes.One CEO, who shall remain nameless, has been accused of sharing sensitive information from chief executive phone hook-ups straight to NRL headquarters.This guy won’t have too many mates at the next CEO’s conference.

SAINT, SINNER, SHOOSH: LOW BLOW FOR GALLENIn a major snub, old warhorse Paul Gallen has been relegated from main event status for his farewell fight against Justin Hodges on Wednesday night.It is a huge shock and could be considered disrespectful to the 41-year-old sporting warrior who has regularly dragged in big pay-per-view audiences for promoters No Limit and Foxtel’s Main Event.In fairness Gallen’s form has been on the decline for two years and the fight with Hodges, whom he fought not so long ago, lacks the appeal of some of his bigger shows.Age has finally caught up with one of Australia’s toughest ever sports stars.Instead the highly regarded world middleweight contender Michael Zerafa has been given the main billing on Wednesday night at Darling Harbour’s International convention centre.It marks an incredible turnaround for Zerafa, who infamously pulled out of his much-hyped grudge match against Tim Tszyu in July last year.So low were the Melburnians’ stocks at the time, there was even talk he would never fight on television in Australia again.But with a new team and talk of a potential world title shot against Gennady Golovkin on the horizon, Zerafa risks it all against Sydney-based Italian Danilo Creati.It will be a huge night of boxing with another rugby league star on debut as Gallen calls it a day.As first reported by this column, France bound ex-Rooster Siua Sio Taukehio has been confirmed to make his boxing debut against former South Sydney, Cowboys and Storm enforcer Jaiman Lowe.Securing the Tongan international a fight had been a challenge for promoters due the timing around the rugby league world Cup.South Sydney Rabbitohs forward Daniel Suluka-Fifita will also make his professional boxing debut on the card. Suluka-Fifita has been training under the watchful eye legendary trainer of Johnny Lewis for the past eight weeks having started boxing training at Redfern PCYC as a 13 year-old.* * * * * SAINTFooty legend Ian Walsh came from the tiny country town of Eugowra that has been wiped out in the floods. Walsh’s daughter Donna still lives in the area. Donna is assisting in the huge recovery operation and has appealed to NRL clubs to help out. Not with money but with manpower. “Eugowra put dad on the map as a rugby league player,” Donna said, “I know he’d want me to be reaching out to the game when the town is suffering like it is.” Donna has even organised for Dominos to supply free pizzas for the clean-up operation. All she needs now is some players. Donna can be contacted on 0409 743 682 if you’d like to help out.SINNERWe all love Victor Radley, even those who dislike the Roosters. He’s a great character and a tough old-school footy player. However there comes a time when we all need to grow up and walk away from a looming incident and/or violence, even when provoked. It’s time for him to start behaving like a professional athlete.SHOOSHWhich big-name NRL star is talking to a rival Sydney club about the possibility of him quitting his team for an immediate switch. It is potentially a monster story.SPOTTEDCommission chairman Peter V’landys and NRL boss Andrew Abdo entering the North Sydney headquarters of the independent always – or at least sometimes – Nine Entertainment, presumably for a meeting with CEO Mike Sneesby and senior SMH editorial executives last week.SPOTTEDIt can be tough work for a boxer preparing to fight for a world title. Tim Tszyu has moved his training camp to Thailand ahead of the January super fight against Jermell Charlo. He takes a break every now and then to go jetskiing.SPOTTEDThe great Ken Arthurson has understandably been struggling since the recent passing of his lovely wife, Barbara. It helps that there are good people like Tom Trbojevic around. Turbo picked up the phone last week to ring and check in on the legendary old Manly supremo. Their chat has given Arko an enormous lift.SPOTTEDAllianz Stadium maintenance staff replacing 30 seats that were stomped on and smashed by fans at the Sydney FC v Wanderers derby last weekend.

This is an empty bar at the MCG last Sunday night in the 14th over of the game. Their fans rarely drink at the cricket. It costs the caterers big time. If the Aussies were playing, they’d be lining up six-deep. THE POLITICIAN, HONEY KING PRAWNS AND NOT-SO-SECRET MEETINGNo other NRL club can leak sensitive information like the Canterbury Bulldogs.You’ll remember last November Eels hooker Reed Mahoney was having a private dinner in the club’s Chinese restaurant with Gus Gould and Trent Barrett. Contract talks over honey king prawns and Mongolian lamb. A picture was sent straight to The Daily Telegraph.You’ve got to wonder why they met in such a public space.Then there was the photo of Billy Kikau in a Bulldogs shirt at Belmore with Gus and Baz being leaked last year while he was still at the Penrith Panthers. Highly embarrassing for Kikau, who copped a hard time from his fans.An employee, who took a frame from security CCTV and circulated it on social media, was sacked.Then July this year. Cameron Ciraldo and his manager George Mimis had a secret lunch with Bulldogs sponsor Craig Laundy to discuss the coaching job. Footage was leaked straight to Channel 9. This week, same again. Hotel billionaire Arthur Laundy signed up for a new five-year sponsorship deal to match the length of Ciraldo’s coaching contract.It’s worth $1 million a year or $1.2 million if they make the finals.A good positive story about a rock-solid businessman who signed up when the club was at its lowest but is now committing long term.The plan was to make a major announcement this week to ensure Laundy got maximum exposure.Turns out Craig Laundy had photos taken on his phone at the official signing. He shared them with Gould, Ciraldo and other mates on Wednesday night. His pictures then hit social media.To be fully transparent, your columnist is writing this with a certain amount of disappointment.We were going to reveal the $5 million sponsorship deal two weeks ago. Chairman John Khoury and CEO Aaron Warburton asked us to hold off. We made an agreement. We would break the story this week before their official announcement.Craig Laundy, a former Liberal federal minister, is like all politicians. They leak like a sieve.The Daily Telegraph NRL Podcast – PlaylistBOO & BALI A TRIBUTE TO FIFITARecently retired Sharks big man Andrew Fifita has found himself in a little bit of froth and bubble while holidaying in Bali.But before you jump to conclusions, the froth and bubble was courtesy of a barista who amazed the 2016 premiership hero, garnishing his brew with a recent tribute cartoon, done by Telegraph sports sketcher Boo Bailey.The copying process is a specialty of the house at Coffee Cartel and had a surprised Fifita joking: “I got squeezed out of the Sharks cap, but made it into this one.”SYDNEY FC SIGN UP 11-YEAR-OLD TWINSSydney FC have signed their youngest ever players – 11-year-old identical twin brothers.Jacob and Benjamin Zaidel have joined the club’s junior academy alongside some of the country’s most outstanding soccer prospects.It is an exciting story on the eve of the World Cup that local clubs are now following the lead of global giants in Europe and South America by recognising kids at such a young age.“They live and breathe the game,” says their dad Dani. “Who knows what the future holds – as long as they keep enjoying it.”Interestingly there are rules in the NRL that prevent clubs from signing players before they turn 15.The boys have been identified by Kelly Cross, Sydney FC’s youth technical director, who has a long and proud history of nurturing the best talent in Australian soccer.Kelly is a former head of football at Westfield Sports High who coached current Socceroos Aaron Mooy and Andrew Redmayne, as well as Harry Kewell, Alex Brosque and Jason Culina.“We’ve been monitoring Ben and Jacob for a period of time and it became clear that they were both equally talented,” Cross said.“You couldn’t tell them apart in terms of ability so it helped that they were wearing different coloured and numbered bibs so there were no problems identifying them.“They are only 11-years old but they are promising young players showing creative potential and it’s great to bring them into our environment.“They are great kids, bubbly and enthusiastic with a good attitude. They get on well with each other and their peers.”The boys’ dad Dani could not be prouder.“Sydney FC start with Under 13’s at their academy,” he said, “The boys are going in a year early. “It’s a year by year agreement that the parents sign.“They’ve had a big advantage as twins kicking a football around the backyard from when they were tiny. They just love the game and are really excited about it.”‘ROCKY’ A GREAT MAN AND INNOVATORJournalism lost an all-time legend with the passing of Roy “Rocky” Miller, a former editor of this newspaper and the most tragic St George Illawarra Dragons fan. The great man was 77.I learnt more from Rocky’s weekly Sunday Telegraph editorial meetings than I have from anyone in 46 years. He was a fanatical news chaser and innovator.Back in the 1980s, before anyone kept or thought of rugby league statistics, he sent copy boys to every game to do tackle counts. They became hugely popular in Monday’s papers.Our staff would all cheer for the Dragons each weekend knowing a victory would mean he’d be in a good mood for Tuesday morning conference. It could be miserable otherwise.As an editor, he was one of the great mentors. He gave me my start as a sports editor. I remember him playing an instrumental role in broadcaster Ray Hadley’s career in his early days. Hadley had just started the Continuous Call team on 2UE. He was up against the high-profile Hollywood and Zorba, a duo that won every footy ratings survey.Zorba used to joke: “Ray could rob a bank without a balaclava and get away with it because no one knows who he is.”Hadley then made an appointment to meet Rocky. He needed to lift his profile and asked Miller if he could write a weekly column in The Sunday Telegraph sports section – Hadley’s Hard Hits. He did it for free. He would soon become one of the major voices in league and regularly win the ratings.What I admired most was Rocky’s loyalty. He’d stick solid no matter what. Three weeks before his death he sent me a text about Dragons legend Craig Young, one of his all-time favourite players who was under siege as chairman for his controversial support of Brett Finch in a court reference.“Look after him,” Rocky wrote. “He made a mistake trying to help a mate (Finch’s father). Does not deserve to be crucified.”Typical Rocky. Always looking after his beloved club … and his mates right to the end.* Rocky’s funeral is on Tuesday at 11am at St Aloysius church in Cronulla.","pubDate":"2022-11-19 23:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"College football scores, updates: USC vs. UCLA, Tennessee vs. South Carolina and more - Yahoo Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLXNjb3Jlcy11cGRhdGVzLW9oaW8tc3RhdGUtdnMtbWFyeWxhbmQtYW5kLW1vcmUtMjM0NDI1NzEzLmh0bWzSAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC1zY29yZXMtdXBkYXRlcy1zb3V0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1yb3V0cy1uby01LXRlbm5lc3NlZS11c2MtdnMtdWNsYS11cGRhdGVzLTA0MDIwMzQ2Mi5odG1s?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"College football scores, updates: USC vs. UCLA, Tennessee vs. South Carolina and more  Yahoo SportsNo. 4 TCU still undefeated after game-ending FG at Baylor  ESPN#4 TCU vs Baylor Highlights | College Football Week 12 | 2022 College Football Highlights  WheelsNo. 4 TCU stays unbeaten on last-gasp field goal to beat Baylor 29-28  Yahoo SportsCollege football Week 12 highlights - Top plays, games and takeaways  ESPN","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-19 23:42:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Giovanni van Bronckhorst personality trait that will keep him fighting for future at Rangers revealed by ex-Ibrox coach","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/9791634/giovanni-van-bronckhorst-personality-trait-fighting-future-rangers/","keywords":["Football","Scottish Premiership"],"creator":["David Oliver"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"GIOVANNI van Bronckhorst won't walk away from Rangers despite his recent struggles at Ibrox, one of his football mentors has insisted.

Today, one day before the World Cup, I thought it was important to discuss the topics that have rightly or wrongly been put on the table. Some things that have been picked up in the last few months that have been quite incredible, I would say.“Today I have very strong feelings.“Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker.”(Long pause.)“And I feel this, all this, because of what I’ve been seeing and what I’ve been told since I don’t read, otherwise I would be depressed I think.“What I see brings me back to my personal story. I am a son of migrant workers. My parents were working very, very hard in very, very difficult conditions. Not in Qatar, but in Switzerland. I remember very well, I’m not 150 years old, not speaking about apartheid in South Africa, I remember the migrant workers where they were living in Switzerland. I remember as a child how migrant workers were treated. “When I came to Doha, the first time after I was elected FIFA President, I went to see the workers’ accommodation here. I was brought back to my childhood. And I say to them here this is not good. Same as Switzerland today, this has become a place of inclusion. With rights, Qatar has made progress as well.“I feel many other things as well. Of course I am not Qatari, I am not Arab, not African, not gay, not disabled, but I feel like them, because I know what it means to be discriminated, to be bullied as a foreigner in a foreign country. I was bullied because I had red hair … and freckles.”A TROUBLED 12 YEARS“I feel as well, very much for all the FIFA staff. For all the Qatar Supreme Committee staff, all the volunteers., all the others. They are all here because they want to deliver to you and to the world an incredible football event. They’re all proud to be here. I’m proud to have this FIFA sign on my jacket.“It’s not easy to read all these criticisms of the decision taken 12 years ago when nobody was there, nobody was there. And now everyone knows we have to make the best out of it. And Doha is ready, Qatar is ready, it will be the best World Cup ever, of course. The magic of football, as soon as the ball rolls, people will concentrate on that because that’s what people want.”MIGRANT WORKERS“We are taught many, many lessons from Europeans and the western world. I am European. I think for Europeans what we have done in the world for the last 3000 years we should be apologising for the next 3000 years. “I came here six years ago and addressed the matter of migrant workers straight on, my very first meeting. How many of these western European businesses … how many have addressed migrant workers rights with the authorities? I have the answer. None of them. Because any change to the legislation means less profit. Instead of one billion profit it means 900 million profit. We did it, and FIFA generates much less than any of these companies from Qatar.“The country that had some pearls and sand, but what they have now is gas. If there was no gas they would not come. And now they all come. And they all want something, but who cares about the work? FIFA does, the World Cup does, and to be fair to them Qatar does as well.”DISABLED POPULATION“There are one billion disabled people in the world. Nobody cares, nobody cares. 15 per cent of the world’s population is disabled. We had four journalists to an event. You think nobody suffers because nobody cares? Of course we have to care, of course we have to do things to help. Like we have to do for the workers, for the LGBT, and for any minority who is in any way suffering or being abused.“Whilst many, many things are not perfect, change takes time. It took hundreds of years in Europe. I wonder if that’s the case. The only way of obtaining results is by engaging, searching the dialogue, not by hammering, insulting. When your child does something bad at school and you tell him you are an idiot, useless, you put him in his room, what do you think his reaction will be? “If you engage with him, let’s work together and you will have better grades, he will recognise that. I don’t want to give you any lessons of life, just realising what is going on here is profoundly, profoundly unjust.”GAY RIGHTS“Let me also mention the LGBT situation. I have been speaking about this topic with the highest leadership in the country, several times. They have confirmed that everyone is welcome. If you have a person that says the opposite, well it’s not the opinion of the country and certainly not the opinion of FIFA. Everyone that comes is welcome. Whatever religion, race, sexual orientation, belief she or he has, everyone is welcome. “The Qatari state sticks to that requirement. They will tell you that legislation that prohibits that to jail. Yes, these legislations exist in many countries in the world. These legislations existed during the World Cup in Switzerland in 1954. So again, like the workers, these are processes.”“What do you want to do about it? You want to stay home and hammer, and criticise these Arabs or these Muslims because it’s not allowed in public? Of course I believe it should be allowed as FIFA President. If I ask the same question to my father if he’s not here anymore, he probably has a different answer to me. So if somebody thinks by just hammering and criticising you will achieve something, well I can tell you, you will achieve exactly the opposite. And that’s bad.”FAKE FANS“The world is divided enough. We are organising the World Cup. We are not organising a war. We are organising a World Cup, that many people have many problems in their life, for them to come and enjoy. To go see the teams, be happy. Cheer the teams. “And what do I read? Well they don’t look like English, they look like Indians, they shouldn’t cheer for English. Can someone who does look like they are from England go cheer for them, or for Spain, or for Germany? You know what this is. This is racism. This is pure racism. We need to stop it. Because everyone in the world has the right to cheer for who he or she wants. Tolerance starts with ourselves, we shouldn’t spread aggression. We should spread understanding.”FIFA’S ROLE IN THE WORLD“Football brings people together. If we want to organise an event in North Korea, I actually went to North Korea some years ago to ask if they were ready to host part of a Women’s World Cup with South Korea. I was not successful, obviously, but I will go another hundred times if it would help. Only engagement can bring real change.“I’m still convinced … this particular World Cup will help to open the eyes of the world.”STADIUM BEER BAN“Honestly, if this is the biggest issue we have for the World Cup I will sign up immediately to go to the beach and relax until the 18th of December. Every decision that is taken in this World Cup is a joint decision. Between Qatar and FIFA. It is discussed and taken jointly. There will be many 8-10 fan zones, and over 200 places you can buy alcohol in Qatar. The late change of policy is because we tried until the end to see what was possible.”","pubDate":"2022-11-19 23:33:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everything Marcus Freeman Said After Notre Dame Beat Boston College - 247Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS9ub3RyZS1kYW1lL0xvbmdGb3JtQXJ0aWNsZS9FdmVyeXRoaW5nLU1hcmN1cy1GcmVlbWFuLVNhaWQtQWZ0ZXItTm90cmUtRGFtZS1CZWF0LUJvc3Rvbi1Db2xsZWdlLTE5ODAzODczOS_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly8yNDdzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2Uvbm90cmUtZGFtZS9Mb25nRm9ybUFydGljbGUvRXZlcnl0aGluZy1NYXJjdXMtRnJlZW1hbi1TYWlkLUFmdGVyLU5vdHJlLURhbWUtQmVhdC1Cb3N0b24tQ29sbGVnZS0xOTgwMzg3MzkvQW1wLw?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Everything Marcus Freeman Said After Notre Dame Beat Boston College  247SportsMarcus Freeman Postgame Press Conference - Boston College | Notre Dame Football (11.19.22)  Notre Dame Fighting IrishMarcus Freeman Talks Notre Dame Resiliency, Isaiah Foskey, Benjamin Morrison, Michael Mayer And More  Sports IllustratedWatch: Marcus Freeman instructs players to 'challenge everything'  Fighting Irish WireNotre Dame captains run onto field for Irish Senior Day | NBC Sports  NBC Sports","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-19 23:26:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Celtic ace Daizen Maeda opens up on World Cup bid, his disappointment for team-mates Reo Hatate and Kyogo… and BAKING!","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/9791500/celtic-daizen-maeda-world-cup-reo-hatate-kyogo-baking/","keywords":["Football","Sport","World Cup","Celtic","Scottish Premiership","World Cup 2022"],"creator":["David Friel"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"DAIZEN MAEDA admits he once behaved like a bit of a doughball during his high school days.

Start your free trial now >The ugly blow saw Fox League’s commentators tipping Crichton to be sent off, but Klein instead raised 10 fingers and gave the backrower his marching orders.“This could be the end of Crichton’s night Vossy,” the commentator said.“It’s a dead ball situation and the elbow is raised, it looks worse the more you slow it down, but for all intents and purposes there is head contact when the ball is dead,” Fox League’s Andrew Voss said.“This is a big moment.”“I think Crichton might be lucky to stay on the field, whatever card this may be,” the commentator said.Parish’s side went down 30-10 and were valiant against Mal Meninga’s Kangaroos, but the Samoan coach was clearly angry they weren’t playing against 12 players for almost a full half.“Five minutes into the second half our hooker gets elbowed in the head and gets carted off, then the referee makes a weak decision and puts him in the bin, dumbfounded,” Parish said.“An elbow to the head and the hooker gets knocked out and taken out of the game.”Australian coach Mal Meninga though disagreed, telling reporters: “My view is that he should have stayed on the field, that’s just silly”.The Samoan squad was down to bare bones after a number of injuries forced players to sit out of the tournament.Parish revealed he only had a squad of 19 players to pick from coming into the World Cup final.Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, Tyrone May, Braden Hamlin-Uele, Josh Aloiai, Izack Tago and Fa’amanu Brown all sat out of the clash, while Spencer Leniu played but was in doubt in the days prior to the game.Hooker Danny Levi also returned home due to personal reasons.“Down to 19 players, that’s all we had in the squad, blokes playing out of position, blokes playing full halves and it was so courageous,” Parish said.Samoan skipper Junior Paulo went in to bat for Crichton, who he has played with before in the NSW Blues set-up under Brad Fittler.“Knowing Angus Crichton and playing with him before, it’s probably not in his game so it is what it is,” Paulo said.Meanwhile, Harris-Tavita dropped a bombshell on the rugby league world earlier this year by announcing he’d be taking an indefinite break from the game following the World Cup.The 23-year-old slotted into hooker after Samoa’s injury crisis and was desperate for a dream way to exit the game for the time being.Unfortunately he left the field after suffering the ugly head knock and was unable to return.“This is the bad luck that has cursed Samoa through the tournament,” Voss said.“Harris-Tavita, this could be his last moment in rugby league what we have just witnessed there.”Speaking post-match Crichton also revealed he will be travelling with Harris-Tavitain the weeks following the World Cup.“I didn’t know he was coming and there was no malice at all, sending out my blessings to his family,” Crichton said.“It is all love between me and Chanel, I spoke to him after the game and I apologised, whenever I play football I don’t try to injury anyone.“I never want to see anyone get injured on a football field, we love rugby league because of the nature of the sport, we don’t go out there trying to hurt people.“I just want everyone to know it was just a genuine reaction, I never go out on the field to try and hurt someone.“He's a great player and I am actually meant to be travelling with him after this so there’s no bad blood between me and Chanel.“He’s great friends with Nathan Cleary, who I am also great mates with... I am genuinely sorry for that, it was not my intention at all.”Harris-Tavita revealed he came to the decision to walk away from the game after getting injured during a heavy loss to the Storm in Round 7 of the 2022 season.“For the past couple of years I just haven’t felt that love for the game, I’ve woken up on many training days and asked myself - is this really what I want to do,” Harris-Tavita said.“It was hard for me to make this decision because you can get a lot of money in this game and you have a short career, so that was one of the toughest parts.“But after I’d ruptured my testicle, I spent a bit of time by myself contemplating my next move and (whether to) sign my next contract, and the decision I made was the best for me moving forward.”","pubDate":"2022-11-19 22:58:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rabat : L’Ambassadeur du Qatar au Maroc, inaugure une « Fan Zone miniature » pour promouvoir la Coupe du Monde !","link":"https://fr.le7tv.ma/2022/11/19/rabat-lambassadeur-du-qatar-au-maroc-inaugure-une-fan-zone-miniature-pour-promouvoir-la-coupe-du-monde/","keywords":["Événements","Football Marocain","Sport","sport et culture","Sport et formation","Sport et Management","Sport et motivations","Sport et sensibilisation","Sport et valeurs","Sport international"],"creator":["le7tv"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dans le cadre de la promotion de l’événement planétaire qui débutera demain à Doha, à savoir la Coupe du Monde de football Qatar 2022, l’Ambassadeur de l’Émirat du Qatar à Rabat, a inauguré une « Fan Zone » miniature, dans la gare ferroviaire de Rabat, pour essayer de rapprocher l’ambiance de la fête footballistique, des supporters marocains,au …","content":"Dans le cadre de la promotion de l’événement planétaire qui débutera demain à Doha, à savoir la Coupe du Monde de football Qatar 2022, l’Ambassadeur de l’Émirat du Qatar à Rabat, a inauguré une « Fan Zone » miniature, dans la gare ferroviaire de Rabat, pour essayer de rapprocher l’ambiance de la fête footballistique, des supporters marocains,au coeur même de la capitale du Maroc.
