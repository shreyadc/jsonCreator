Wonderkid Palmer, who scored City's only goal in their Community Shield defeat by Arsenal at Wembley, will be hopeful of more game time this season after bursting onto the scene under Pep Guardiola and impressing in his sporadic appearances. However, with City actively working on a deal to lure Paqueta from the London Stadium, Palmer may once again find himself forced to settle for a bit-part role. As a result, West Ham will look to include the 21-year-old in negotiations with City over talisman Paqueta, either on loan or as part of a permanent move. That is according to the Evening Standard , who add that David Moyes may play Jarrod Bowen as a striker and deploy Palmer down the right wing instead. Palmer has been particularly effective when cutting in from the same flank, having jinked inside and beaten Aaron Ramsdale with a superb effort at the weekend. He is a seasoned international for England's U21s and has also attracted attention from the likes of Brighton, Burnley and Leicester this summer, various reports say. The starlet has been non-committal when questioned on his short-term future. 'Have to see what the plan is for next season, see where I am playing and hopefully play as many games as possible,' he said after City's recent loss. 'Hopefully we can win the treble again but that will be a difficult task. The lads have been sharp in training and hopefully we can do it all over again.' Paqueta, meanwhile, wants to join City this summer, Mail Sport understands. However, West Ham are keen to keep him despite a £70million bid being lodged. The midfielder became a key player under David Moyes last season, helping the club to their Europa Conference League triumph, and is a shock name on City's shortlist. And as a result, West Ham chairman David Sullivan is determined not to sell him. Having lost captain Declan Rice to Arsenal, Sullivan does not want to let another key player slip away to a Premier League rival and is, at least for now, standing firm.

In the post-match press conference, Riveiro shed some insight into the dynamism that the exciting trio offers the Buccaneers. \"They (Saleng, Mofokeng, Maswanganyi) are similar somehow so in those positions, the way we play we try to make sure that the opponent is not comfortable, there is a permanent change for them to mark. \"It's not the same to deal with Saleng than to deal with Patrick, they have different details that make defending against them different (difficult), Rele is different as well, different foot (left-footed). \"So there is organised freedom for them, if we can say that, and depending on the opponent. We try and occupy the spaces that the opposition allow to go in. \"Sometimes we need Mako lower because they (Royal AM) were pressing with two, so Rele must keep the field ore opened, It's not Rele that it's Patrick, we don't mind as long as they are disciplined. \"The problem with a change of positions is the moment where you lose the ball. At the moment, they are doing very well when we lose the ball. \"They are disciplined, they follow their role to until the end. It's something we have been doing since last season and little by little it's getting better. \"It's the first time them play together, so there also moments that you can see that it is the first time. But they are very talented guys, they are real football players and it's easy [to work] with them.\" The win temporarily takes Pirates up to third spot on the DStv Premiership table. Up next for Riveiro's side is an MTN8 quarter-final clash against Sekhukhune United to be played at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Kick-off is at 18:00.","pubDate":"2023-08-10 08:20:29","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/kickoff24.png","source_id":"snl24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Nigeria Women's World Cup star slams 'unacceptable' resources back home as she reveals their camp doesn't have a gym and players have to sometimes SHARE beds","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12392357/Nigeria-Womens-World-Cup-star-slams-unacceptable-resources-home-reveals-camp-doesnt-gym-players-SHARE-beds.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Nigeria striker Ifeoma Onumonu has opened up on their 'unacceptable' resources back home following their Women's World Cup exit at the hands of England.","content":"Nigeria Women's World Cup star slams 'unacceptable' resources back home as she reveals their camp doesn't have a gym and players have to sometimes SHARE beds Nigeria were knocked out of the Women's World Cup on penalties to England Striker Ifeoma Onumonu has opened up on their lack of resources back home Nigeria considered boycotting their opening match over bonus payments By Kieran Lynch For Mailonline Published: 09:00 BST, 10 August 2023 | Updated: 09:00 BST, 10 August 2023 e-mail View comments Nigeria striker Ifeoma Onumonu has opened up on their 'unacceptable' resources back home following their Women's World Cup exit at the hands of England . The Super Falcons took England all the way to penalties in their last-16 tie, though Sarina Wiegman 's side were more clinical from the spot with a 4-2 shootout victory. Onumonu, who led the line for the African nation against the Lionesses, highlighted the difference in support that both teams receive back home. She told the Guardian : 'I've seen what England has access to. In Nigeria we don't have access to much. 'Our training fields aren't great. Where we sleep isn't great. Sometimes we share beds. Ifeoma Onumonu has opened up on Nigeria's unacceptable resources back home, days after the side were eliminated in the last-16 stage of the World Cup on penalties to England She claimed that the Super Falcons don't have access to a gym in camp in Nigeria and that players sometimes have to share beds 'It's not good enough. In terms of recovery we don't have much of any of that. We don't have access to a gym in camp in Nigeria. There's a lot that needs to be done.' The 29-year-old who plays for Gotham FC added that it was hard to adjust at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand. She said: 'We do what we can because we love playing for our country but hopefully they make it easier for us to do our best Back home the pitches aren't great. The grass is rocky, bumps everywhere. The stadium we play in for qualifying, you'd be surprised. She also revealed that the under-20s side were 'sleeping in airports for 24 hours' after they were knocked out of the U20 World Cup in the quarter-finals last year. 'That's not acceptable. What we have to fight for is bigger than us,' she said. Nigeria impressed at this summer's World Cup, going through their group unbeaten with draws against Canada and Republic of Ireland, with a victory over hosts Australia. However, they considered a boycott of their first match in the tournamen t after the squad were informed they won't be paid tournament match bonuses . Manager Randy Waldrum also heavily criticised the Nigerian FA in two different podcasts, which included comments about failing to pay players, poor facilities, a cancellation of a pre-tournament camp and interference in selection matters and staff appointments. Onumono admitted that it was hard to adjust to life at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand Nigeria boss Randy Waldrum heavily criticised the Nigerian FA in two different podcasts Ian Wright had his say on social media , tweeting 'Pay them!!!!!' after their defeat to England. Earlier this week, global players union' FIFPRO released a statement on behalf of the Nigeria Women's National team confirming they will assist the players in their ongoing dispute. 'Following the Nigeria women's national team's elimination from the FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFPRO can confirm it is assisting players in a disagreement with the Nigeria Football Federation concerning bonus payments, camp allowances and expenses, some of which date back to 2021. 'During the World Cup, the players expressed the desire to remain focused on their performance without making public statements or facing other distractions. However, the Super Falcons believe that it is now time for the Nigeria Football Federation to honour their commitments and pay the outstanding amounts. 'The team is extremely frustrated that they have had to pursue the Nigeria Football Federation for these payments before and during the tournament and may have to continue doing so afterwards. It is regrettable that players needed to challenge their own federation at such an important time in their careers. 'FIFPRO will continue to work with the players to ensure their contractual rights are honoured and the outstanding payments are settled.'

He then scored two goals in the friendlies he played in the Premier League Summer Series against Fulham and Brentford. The 24-year-old could play a key role for Villa next season as Emery's side set their sights on silverware having qualified for the Europa Conference League last term.

He looks like a great motivator. \"I thought that aiming for a top-half finish would have been great for them, but the run they had was unbelievable.

I like Moussa Diaby, I think he could be a top player. He’s set up for the Premier League, he’s got pace, skill and can beat players. \"Villa’s not an easy place to go and I’ve got a good feeling about him.

We have a group that competes and they are all fighting for the same objective, and they’re very motivated,” Vilda told reporters on Thursday. Last September, 15 players declared themselves unavailable for selection around events they said impacted their emotional and physical health, directing the bulk of their complaints at Vilda. The Spanish federation backed the coach. While only six of those players are at the World Cup, La Roja has already made history by qualifying for the quarterfinals for the first time in three appearances. “We are concentrating on what we’re doing now, the 23 players, we are committed to achieving the same objective with the same willpower and we want to continue in this World Cup,” said Ivana Andres, one of the half dozen who returned to the team. “We have an excellent relationship with Jorge,” added the Real Madrid defender. “We have total confidence in him. We believe that we are a team, not only the players but all the technical staff. And we all have shared responsibility in the match. If we win, we all win and if we lose, we all lose.” Damaris Egurrola, who was born in the U.S. to a Dutch mother and Spanish father, made her senior debut for Spain in 2019 but switched to the Netherlands in 2022, saying she had issues with Vilda. The Lyon midfielder will take the pitch for the Dutch on Friday. “We worry about our players and the players that we can include in the lineup and I would not change any of my 23 players for anyone else,” Vilda said when asked about Egurrola. The 42-year-old, who has coached Spain’s senior team since 2015, praised how hard his players have worked at the World Cup. “They have been impeccable in all training sessions. They are true professionals. And there is no doubt whatsoever about that,” Vilda said. “Today we trained in 6 degrees (43 Fahrenheit), windy, they did an excellent training session. “They trained when it was hot and also trained fabulously, and they’ve taken care of themselves to be in perfect conditions for the game.” Friday’s winner will face either Japan or Sweden in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Auckland.

The 2023/24 Premier League season is upon us and the predictions are in, with Arsenal, Rasmus Hojlund, David Moyes and many more featuring. As is traditional, tell me who will win the league. Sarah Winterburn : Last season I said Liverpool just to be contrary and then kicked myself because I never thought it would be anybody but Manchester City. No such mistake this time: Man City. Matt Stead : The squad might look a little different than was foreseen, but it has already been spoken: 2023/24 Premier League champions, Arsenal . John Nicholson : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Manchester City. Ian Watson : Arsenal are tempting, but not quite tempting enough. Manchester City. Dave Tickner : Manchester City, but stated with slightly less confidence than this time last year. Will Ford : Manchester City by a long, long way. Joe Williams : I predicted Liverpool last year as I told myself picking Manchester City was boring. I’m starting to think boring is almost always right though, so I’m going for Pep Guardiola’s side to win their fourth title on the bounce. Lewis Oldham : F*** it, Arsenal will do it. Three great signings (four with David Raya) and Man City will drop off after doing the treble. Jason Soutar : Arsenal are going to do it. I can feel it in my bones. Will Arsenal lift silverware again? And the rest of the top four, in order. Which nobody ever gets right. SW : Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea. It won’t be right; it’s never right. MS : Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea. JN : Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea. Spurs 5th, Villa 6th, Newcastle 7th. IW : Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool. Though I could say Chelsea, Newcastle, Spurs with almost equal conviction. DT : Arsenal, Manchester United and, oh, let’s say Spurs for shits and giggles. Does feel like the top three should be certainties and then it’s any one of four or five teams for that fourth spot. But even that equivocation will be wrong because as we all know by now this question is f***ing impossible. WF : Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United. A proper battle though – Chelsea not far behind. JW : Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United. LO : Man City, Liverpool and Man Utd. Aston Villa will not be far off in fifth while Newcastle and Spurs battle for sixth. JS : Man City, Man Utd, Liverpool. Fourth is wide open, though. If Villa or Spurs manage it I will not be surprised at all. Three picks for relegation please. SW : Luton and Sheffield United are surely doomed before a ball is kicked. The third is far more difficult but I will opt for Wolves as the squad and the manager will both be significantly weaker. I don’t like Bournemouth’s squad either but at least they have upgraded their coach. MS : Everton are surely gone this time. Yet they’re also going to scrape through again with sub-40 points nevertheless being enough to keep them clear of Sheffield United, Wolves and Luton. JN : Luton could shock everyone and stay up, but likely won’t. Nottingham Forest should be too poor away from home to survive another season but Sheffield United don’t appear to have the quality needed either, so I’ll take the Blades to go down. Wolves lack goals and have got the stench of decay about them. IW : I can’t make a case for Sheffield United staying up, and Luton will be the new Blackpool, spending the season being patronised all the way back to the Championship. Wolves will follow them. DT : Luton and Sheffield United don’t really look anywhere near what’s required sadly. And while there are several teams one can make a very strong case for in 18th it’s currently pretty hard to see past Wolves who’ve downgraded both squad and, at the very last minute, manager. We already feared for them, we really did , even before Lopetegui decided to sod it all for a game of soldiers. WF : Sheffield United and Luton won’t have anywhere near enough, and Everton – time to put them out of their misery. JW : Sheffield United, Bournemouth and Wolves. The less we talk about the Blades the better. LO : Luton Town (who will put up a great fight before finishing 18th) along with Wolves and Sheffield United (who have both had a nightmare this summer). Crystal Palace and Fulham will slump into a relegation scrap, while Everton will be boringly steady under Sean Dyche. JS : Sheffield United will finish 20th (sorry, JW). They’ll be joined in the bottom three by Luton – whose fine home form won’t be enough on its own – and Wolves. Once again, this is wide open and I think even West Ham, Fulham and Brentford could be in a spot of bother. Looking further down the league, I’d expect @LutonTown and @SheffieldUnited to struggle. The jump from The Championship to The @premierleague is huge. I’m also worried for @Wolves who have sold some of their best players and not replaced them. Expect @WestHam to spend most of… — Michael Owen (@themichaelowen) August 5, 2023 Which club will be a pleasant surprise? SW : The easy answer is Burnley but I don’t think anybody will be remotely surprised at their mid-table finish. But I bizarrely think that Everton will have a relatively serene season. MS : Bournemouth are tempting but they’re such a gloriously unknown quantity. Brentford will yet again tick along delightfully, taking a few more scalps along the way as they flirt with another top-half finish without anyone even noticing. JN : Burnley are the obvious choice for this one. There’s often one promoted club that outperforms expectations and I think Vinnie’s style will work well in the top flight. IW : Burnley will be fine but that will come as a shock to no-one. Everton not being sh*te might, though. DT : Burnley will be mid-table, and it’s up to you to decide whether this is pleasant or surprising. Spurs will play some wonderful attacking football and do some hilarious defending . The former at least might surprise some after the rancid football they’ve served up under a pair of misery-guts serial winners in the last few years, and the latter should be pleasant for everyone who isn’t a Spurs fan. WF : Sacking Gary O’Neil will pay off for Bournemouth, who will comfortably avoid relegation and play some decent football. JW : Luton Town. I watched the Hatters a lot last season and think they can cause a lot of Premier League teams problems with their physicality and direct play, while Rob Edwards has also demonstrated that he’s a brilliant tactician. I’m not tipping them for a top-half finish, but I think they have what it takes to avoid relegation. LO : AFC Bournemouth. Binning off Gary O’Neil is an inspired decision as Andoni Iraola is a clear upgrade. They’ll be comfy between 10th and 14th. JS : Tottenham. The expectations are very low so I feel like Ange Postecoglou’s style of play and a top-six finish (at worse) will be seen as a pleasant surprise. Who will win the Golden Boot? SW : Still can’t believe we didn’t opt for Haaland en masse this year. No chance of anybody else this time around. MS : Might as well skip this section, because: Erling Haaland. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Erling Haaland. IW : Haaland, obvs. DT : Erling Haaland, innit. Only one other person who could even theoretically come close and he might not even be here. WF : Erling Haaland by such a margin that we won’t be allowed to select him in the 2024/25 pre-season predictions. JW : Erling Haaland. You’d have to be proper daft to not pick him this time. Darwin Nunez, you let me down last season. LO : Erling Haaland. I’m not risking it this year. JS : Now is not the time for edginess. It will be the Nordic robot. Erling Haaland could score a couple more goals for Manchester City Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? SW : Andre Onana at Manchester United; he will single-handedly push Manchester United a bit further up the pitch and we should see a proper Ten Hag team. MS : A Jefferson Lerma with an entire pre-season worth of Roy Hodgson double training sessions is to be feared. And Pau Torres gives Aston Villa a whole new dimension. JN : James Trafford is a great signing for Burnley and could be the difference between struggling and surviving. And I fancy Andre Onana will oil United’s wheels and speed up their play, as well as making us all very happy when he’s lobbed 40 metres out of his goal. IW : The knives will be out for Andre Onana as soon as he gets tackled on the halfway-line while trying to Cruyff-turn away from Harry Kane next week. But the new United keeper will be a clear and obvious upgrade. DT : Jurrien Timber has probably got the least attention of Arsenal’s summer moves but is surely the most significant for being a) dead good and b) significantly reducing the chances of another title challenge falling to pieces because Rob Holding and his ludicrous hairhat have got involved. WF : Nicolas Jackson, partly because he’s good at football but mainly because of the incredibly low striker bar at Chelsea. JW : Moussa Diaby. The new Aston Villa signing contributed 14 goals and nine assists in all competitions last season. I reckon there’s an exciting season ahead for the France international and the Villans. LO : James Maddison. Spurs won’t be as sh*t as most are expecting them to be this season and he’s the Christian Eriksen replacement they have been craving . JS : Dominik Szoboszlai. No Bundesliga tax here. And which one will turn out to be a massive flop? SW : I just don’t see it with Kai Havertz – he will look exactly like the player that struggled at Chelsea. MS : Three words: The Pep Year. Three more words: Seventy-seven million. Another three words: Josko bloody Gvardiol. Then he will be absolutely unbelievable thereafter. JN : Rasmus Hojlund has strong Angel Di Maria vibes. £72million is a lot to pay for a player with his goal record. Will be only playing in the League Cup come the winter. IW : Sandro Tonali. He might make the best of it and turn out to be prime-Pirlo but it’s hard to shake the feeling that he doesn’t want to be there, or anywhere else but Milan. DT : Rasmus Hojlund will do precisely as well as a 20-year-old striker with a roughly one-in-three scoring record thrown into a new league can reasonably be expected to do, but that fee, the lack of any other centre-forward in Manchester United’s squad and the harsh but inevitable comparisons with Haaland down the road and Kane who United “should have signed” (even though they had no chance of doing so) means expectations will be far from reasonable and he is thus heading inexorably for flopsville. WF : Rasmus Hojlund. Huge pressure on a young striker. Will need a season to adapt but the Haaland comparisons have already started. JW : Rasmus Hojlund. There will be demands on the 20-year-old to score goals immediately because of his £72m transfer fee. Worrying rumours that the Dane is nursing a back injury in the early days of his time at Man Utd, potentially limiting his game time this season, will not fill the fans with confidence that he can improve on his tally of nine league goals for Atalanta last term. LO : Rasmus Hojlund. He’ll probably come good in the long run but Man Utd will rely on him too much during his debut season before he is ready. JS : I think Kai Havertz will be a popular choice so let’s go with Fulham’s Calvin Bassey. Raul Jimenez will be rubbish as well, for what it’s worth. Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? SW : Pau Torres for less than £28m is an astonishing signing from Aston Villa. Bloody good business. MS : It is quite unfathomably Ross Barkley time yet again. Matt Turner will also help keep Forest up for just £7m. JN : South Korean centre-back Ji-soo Kim cost Brentford £640,000. The 18-year-old is young and inexperienced but is good with both feet, tall and quick. There are a lot of bargains to be had in South Korea. He could be a real surprise package. IW : Mark Flekken could be a bargain in Brentford’s goal since he cost not far shy of a third of the fella he’s replacing. DT : I don’t really know why Sheffield United so casually sold Sander Berge for just £14m to a theoretical direct rival or why the entire bottom half of the Premier League weren’t all over that. So him, I guess. WF : Mahmoud Dahoud, because Brighton. JW : It’s hard to see where the goals are going to come from at Sheffield United and almost as difficult to find a player going for less than £15m this summer. For that reason I’m going to hope Benie Traore, signed from Swedish side Hacken for £4m, can score the goals to keep the Blades up. LO : Mahmoud Dahoud. A decent replacement for Alexis Mac Allister on a free. Great business. JS : Jefferson Lerma after joining Crystal Palace on a free transfer. I don’t think the extent of Mo Dahoud’s skillset has quite sunk in yet… on a free transfer too, we will be shown soon. 🪄 pic.twitter.com/IC2R3T5sL0 — Ryan (@ryanadsett) August 3, 2023 Who will be named the PFA Player of the Year? SW : Impossible to see beyond Erling Haaland now. Literally. He is massive. MS : Declan Rice. No, you’re an idiot. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Erling Haaland. IW : Factoring in the level of thought that goes into most players’ PFA vote, it’d be daft to say anyone but the lad who scores a mega-f***-tonne of goals. Haaland, then. DT : So boring to say Haaland. So correct, but so boring. We’re all going to say Haaland, aren’t we? He is an existential threat to the F365 Predictions and must be stopped/sold to Real Madrid at the earliest convenience. WF : Erling Haaland. JW : Erling Haaland. He is reyt good. LO : Bukayo Saka. Arsenal’s star boy will get loads of goals and assists en route to becoming a Premier League champion. JS : Erling Haaland will probably score a ridiculous amount of goals, so the natural choice is him. First manager to leave their Premier League job? SW : Whoever comes in at Wolves because that looks like a near-impossible job. MS : West Ham and David Moyes are clearly in the most successful and unbreakable of marriages at this point – one built on distrust and utter contempt for one another – so let’s say Marco Silva will regret turning down those Saudi riches. Aleksandar Mitrovic and Willian having their heads turned by Middle East interest, the absence or absolute loss of Joao Palhinha, a regression to the xG mean and some of those single-goal wins swinging the other way will all contribute to a tough start as Fulham finally accept they need to have at least three managers for one of their Premier League seasons to count. JN : The flies are surely already buzzing around David Moyes. People are saying he’s got credit in the bank after winning the Europa Conference League but a Hammers fan told me that it only felt like such a big, unlikely win precisely because they did it with Moyes as manager. A case of in spite of, not because of. I don’t fancy Paul Heckingbottom’s chances of being in work by Xmas either. IW : Gary O’Neil and Paul Heckingbottom might push him close, but anything less than a stellar start would give people at West Ham the excuse they want to bin David Moyes. DT : Gary O’Neil. He hasn’t even been appointed as I write, so that does give this even higher than normal potential for calamity, but Wolves look absolutely dreadful, have now had absolutely no meaningful pre-season whatsoever and face four of last season’s top six – Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Manchester City – before the end of September. Plus I’m not sure even Watford have ever managed to get first and second place in the Sack Race before, so that would be an achievement of sorts. WF : Roy Hodgson in the most mutual consent-y sacking in history. JW : David Moyes. There have already been rumblings of discontent over the summer. LO : David Moyes. The cracks are already clear to see. JS : David Moyes. West Ham are a mess. Pick the Champions League winner. SW : Real Madrid after the signing of Jude Bellingham. MS : Al-Hilal. Ah, gotcha. Last one before the Swiss model nonsense, isn’t it? City again. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Manchester City. IW : If Real get their hands on Kylian Mbappe, them. If not, urgh, City. DT : Must be Real Madrid’s turn again now. WF : Manchester City will win everything they give a toss about until Pep leaves. JW : Real Madrid. Jude Bellingham (and maybe Kylian Mbappe) to make the difference. LO : Real Madrid; a Jude Bellingham and Joselu masterclass is incoming. JS : Real Madrid. Have I really just predicted City to end the season without the PL or CL? In five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season. SW : Who will bottle this season? MS : Luton Town’s away end entrance. JN : Watching Scottish football drinking vodka. IW : Lots of new Prem goalkeepers. DT : Spurs bringing Bazball to football. WF : Kane-less Spurs winning a trophy JW : Brewster to get a goal.

Erik ten Hag needs to offload some members of his squad to raise funds for new recruits and Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer. Fulham's interest in a player United value around the £20million mark was the first to emerge and there were also talks with Turkish club Galatasaray. They made an undisclosed bid last month which was turned down by United , while Saudi Arabian clubs have also expressed an interest in the 30-year-old. But Fulham could now offer Fred the opportunity to remain in the Premier League as discussions continue. Fulham have re-opened talks with Manchester United over their Brazilian midfielder Fred Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer as United manager Erik ten Hag reshapes his team Fred signed for United from Shakhtar Donetsk for £52m in 2018 and has made 213 appearances across all competitions, scoring 14 times. While Fred can't be faulted for his work ethic, he has often frustrated fans by giving the ball away in midfield or rushing into tackles. Ten Hag did improve his ability to make late runs into opposition penalty boxes, as shown by a joint career-best return of six goals last season. He could join fellow midfielders Scott McTominay, who is wanted by West Ham , and Donny van de Beek, in talks with Spanish side Real Sociedad , in leaving United before the window closes. That would raise funds so Ten Hag can buy another midfielder, such as the Moroccan international Sofyan Amrabat , valued by Fiorentina at £30m. They also need reinforcements in defence following Harry Maguire's £30m move to West Ham. Talks have been held over a move for Nice's Jean-Clair Todibo, with Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba, Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi also names in the frame. Meanwhile, French club Amiens wants to take young United defender Teden Mengi on loan.

Wonderkid Palmer, who scored City's only goal in their Community Shield defeat by Arsenal at Wembley, will be hopeful of more game time this season after bursting onto the scene under Pep Guardiola and impressing in his sporadic appearances. However, with City actively working on a deal to lure Paqueta from the London Stadium, Palmer may once again find himself forced to settle for a bit-part role. As a result, West Ham will look to include the 21-year-old in negotiations with City over talisman Paqueta, either on loan or as part of a permanent move. That is according to the Evening Standard , who add that David Moyes may play Jarrod Bowen as a striker and deploy Palmer down the right wing instead. Palmer has been particularly effective when cutting in from the same flank, having jinked inside and beaten Aaron Ramsdale with a superb effort at the weekend. He is a seasoned international for England's U21s and has also attracted attention from the likes of Brighton, Burnley and Leicester this summer, various reports say. The starlet has been non-committal when questioned on his short-term future. 'Have to see what the plan is for next season, see where I am playing and hopefully play as many games as possible,' he said after City's recent loss. 'Hopefully we can win the treble again but that will be a difficult task. The lads have been sharp in training and hopefully we can do it all over again.' Paqueta, meanwhile, wants to join City this summer, Mail Sport understands. However, West Ham are keen to keep him despite a £70million bid being lodged. The midfielder became a key player under David Moyes last season, helping the club to their Europa Conference League triumph, and is a shock name on City's shortlist. And as a result, West Ham chairman David Sullivan is determined not to sell him. Having lost captain Declan Rice to Arsenal, Sullivan does not want to let another key player slip away to a Premier League rival and is, at least for now, standing firm.

We try and occupy the spaces that the opposition allow to go in. \"Sometimes we need Mako lower because they (Royal AM) were pressing with two, so Rele must keep the field ore opened, It's not Rele that it's Patrick, we don't mind as long as they are disciplined. \"The problem with a change of positions is the moment where you lose the ball. At the moment, they are doing very well when we lose the ball. \"They are disciplined, they follow their role to until the end.

The Super Falcons took England all the way to penalties in their last-16 tie, though Sarina Wiegman 's side were more clinical from the spot with a 4-2 shootout victory. Onumonu, who led the line for the African nation against the Lionesses, highlighted the difference in support that both teams receive back home. She told the Guardian : 'I've seen what England has access to. In Nigeria we don't have access to much. 'Our training fields aren't great. Where we sleep isn't great. Sometimes we share beds. Ifeoma Onumonu has opened up on Nigeria's unacceptable resources back home, days after the side were eliminated in the last-16 stage of the World Cup on penalties to England She claimed that the Super Falcons don't have access to a gym in camp in Nigeria and that players sometimes have to share beds 'It's not good enough. In terms of recovery we don't have much of any of that. We don't have access to a gym in camp in Nigeria. There's a lot that needs to be done.' The 29-year-old who plays for Gotham FC added that it was hard to adjust at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand. She said: 'We do what we can because we love playing for our country but hopefully they make it easier for us to do our best Back home the pitches aren't great. The grass is rocky, bumps everywhere. The stadium we play in for qualifying, you'd be surprised. She also revealed that the under-20s side were 'sleeping in airports for 24 hours' after they were knocked out of the U20 World Cup in the quarter-finals last year. 'That's not acceptable. What we have to fight for is bigger than us,' she said. Nigeria impressed at this summer's World Cup, going through their group unbeaten with draws against Canada and Republic of Ireland, with a victory over hosts Australia. However, they considered a boycott of their first match in the tournamen t after the squad were informed they won't be paid tournament match bonuses . Manager Randy Waldrum also heavily criticised the Nigerian FA in two different podcasts, which included comments about failing to pay players, poor facilities, a cancellation of a pre-tournament camp and interference in selection matters and staff appointments. Onumono admitted that it was hard to adjust to life at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand Nigeria boss Randy Waldrum heavily criticised the Nigerian FA in two different podcasts Ian Wright had his say on social media , tweeting 'Pay them!!!!!' after their defeat to England. Earlier this week, global players union' FIFPRO released a statement on behalf of the Nigeria Women's National team confirming they will assist the players in their ongoing dispute. 'Following the Nigeria women's national team's elimination from the FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFPRO can confirm it is assisting players in a disagreement with the Nigeria Football Federation concerning bonus payments, camp allowances and expenses, some of which date back to 2021. 'During the World Cup, the players expressed the desire to remain focused on their performance without making public statements or facing other distractions. However, the Super Falcons believe that it is now time for the Nigeria Football Federation to honour their commitments and pay the outstanding amounts. 'The team is extremely frustrated that they have had to pursue the Nigeria Football Federation for these payments before and during the tournament and may have to continue doing so afterwards. It is regrettable that players needed to challenge their own federation at such an important time in their careers. 'FIFPRO will continue to work with the players to ensure their contractual rights are honoured and the outstanding payments are settled.'

The 24-year-old could play a key role for Villa next season as Emery's side set their sights on silverware having qualified for the Europa Conference League last term. Former star Downing believes a top six finish would represent progress in what will be Emery's first season in charge.

He looks like a great motivator. \"I thought that aiming for a top-half finish would have been great for them, but the run they had was unbelievable. He’s a top manager and with the right resources he could do really well. \"I think they’ll be in and around the top six again. I think if they get into the top six and establish themselves, that will represent progress.\" Asked about Villa's summer additions, Downing said: \"With the players they’ve brought in, it’s possible. I like Moussa Diaby, I think he could be a top player. He’s set up for the Premier League, he’s got pace, skill and can beat players. \"Villa’s not an easy place to go and I’ve got a good feeling about him. Youri Tielemans is another player they have brought in who was touted for £40-50million at one point, and he can play attractive football. Bringing in Pau Torres suggests that’s what they’re going to do as well.\" What do you make of Downing's comments?

It appears Villa have now made a decision on his future. According to The Athletic , Villa are \"open to a sale\" for the youngster this summer, with Middlesbrough likely to be among the teams interested as they continue to search for a new striker.

We have a group that competes and they are all fighting for the same objective, and they’re very motivated,” Vilda told reporters on Thursday. Last September, 15 players declared themselves unavailable for selection around events they said impacted their emotional and physical health, directing the bulk of their complaints at Vilda. The Spanish federation backed the coach. While only six of those players are at the World Cup, La Roja has already made history by qualifying for the quarterfinals for the first time in three appearances. “We are concentrating on what we’re doing now, the 23 players, we are committed to achieving the same objective with the same willpower and we want to continue in this World Cup,” said Ivana Andres, one of the half dozen who returned to the team. “We have an excellent relationship with Jorge,” added the Real Madrid defender. “We have total confidence in him. We believe that we are a team, not only the players but all the technical staff. And we all have shared responsibility in the match. If we win, we all win and if we lose, we all lose.” Damaris Egurrola, who was born in the U.S. to a Dutch mother and Spanish father, made her senior debut for Spain in 2019 but switched to the Netherlands in 2022, saying she had issues with Vilda. The Lyon midfielder will take the pitch for the Dutch on Friday. “We worry about our players and the players that we can include in the lineup and I would not change any of my 23 players for anyone else,” Vilda said when asked about Egurrola. The 42-year-old, who has coached Spain’s senior team since 2015, praised how hard his players have worked at the World Cup. “They have been impeccable in all training sessions. They are true professionals. And there is no doubt whatsoever about that,” Vilda said. “Today we trained in 6 degrees (43 Fahrenheit), windy, they did an excellent training session. “They trained when it was hot and also trained fabulously, and they’ve taken care of themselves to be in perfect conditions for the game.” Friday’s winner will face either Japan or Sweden in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Auckland.

The 2023/24 Premier League season is upon us and the predictions are in, with Arsenal, Rasmus Hojlund, David Moyes and many more featuring. As is traditional, tell me who will win the league. Sarah Winterburn : Last season I said Liverpool just to be contrary and then kicked myself because I never thought it would be anybody but Manchester City. No such mistake this time: Man City. Matt Stead : The squad might look a little different than was foreseen, but it has already been spoken: 2023/24 Premier League champions, Arsenal . John Nicholson : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Manchester City. Ian Watson : Arsenal are tempting, but not quite tempting enough. Manchester City. Dave Tickner : Manchester City, but stated with slightly less confidence than this time last year. Will Ford : Manchester City by a long, long way. Joe Williams : I predicted Liverpool last year as I told myself picking Manchester City was boring. I’m starting to think boring is almost always right though, so I’m going for Pep Guardiola’s side to win their fourth title on the bounce. Lewis Oldham : F*** it, Arsenal will do it. Three great signings (four with David Raya) and Man City will drop off after doing the treble. Jason Soutar : Arsenal are going to do it. I can feel it in my bones. Will Arsenal lift silverware again? And the rest of the top four, in order. Which nobody ever gets right. SW : Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea. It won’t be right; it’s never right. MS : Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea. JN : Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea. Spurs 5th, Villa 6th, Newcastle 7th. IW : Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool. Though I could say Chelsea, Newcastle, Spurs with almost equal conviction. DT : Arsenal, Manchester United and, oh, let’s say Spurs for shits and giggles. Does feel like the top three should be certainties and then it’s any one of four or five teams for that fourth spot. But even that equivocation will be wrong because as we all know by now this question is f***ing impossible. WF : Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United. A proper battle though – Chelsea not far behind. JW : Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United. LO : Man City, Liverpool and Man Utd. Aston Villa will not be far off in fifth while Newcastle and Spurs battle for sixth. JS : Man City, Man Utd, Liverpool. Fourth is wide open, though. If Villa or Spurs manage it I will not be surprised at all. Three picks for relegation please. SW : Luton and Sheffield United are surely doomed before a ball is kicked. The third is far more difficult but I will opt for Wolves as the squad and the manager will both be significantly weaker. I don’t like Bournemouth’s squad either but at least they have upgraded their coach. MS : Everton are surely gone this time. Yet they’re also going to scrape through again with sub-40 points nevertheless being enough to keep them clear of Sheffield United, Wolves and Luton. JN : Luton could shock everyone and stay up, but likely won’t. Nottingham Forest should be too poor away from home to survive another season but Sheffield United don’t appear to have the quality needed either, so I’ll take the Blades to go down. Wolves lack goals and have got the stench of decay about them. IW : I can’t make a case for Sheffield United staying up, and Luton will be the new Blackpool, spending the season being patronised all the way back to the Championship. Wolves will follow them. DT : Luton and Sheffield United don’t really look anywhere near what’s required sadly. And while there are several teams one can make a very strong case for in 18th it’s currently pretty hard to see past Wolves who’ve downgraded both squad and, at the very last minute, manager. We already feared for them, we really did , even before Lopetegui decided to sod it all for a game of soldiers. WF : Sheffield United and Luton won’t have anywhere near enough, and Everton – time to put them out of their misery. JW : Sheffield United, Bournemouth and Wolves. The less we talk about the Blades the better. LO : Luton Town (who will put up a great fight before finishing 18th) along with Wolves and Sheffield United (who have both had a nightmare this summer). Crystal Palace and Fulham will slump into a relegation scrap, while Everton will be boringly steady under Sean Dyche. JS : Sheffield United will finish 20th (sorry, JW). They’ll be joined in the bottom three by Luton – whose fine home form won’t be enough on its own – and Wolves. Once again, this is wide open and I think even West Ham, Fulham and Brentford could be in a spot of bother. Looking further down the league, I’d expect @LutonTown and @SheffieldUnited to struggle. The jump from The Championship to The @premierleague is huge. I’m also worried for @Wolves who have sold some of their best players and not replaced them. Expect @WestHam to spend most of… — Michael Owen (@themichaelowen) August 5, 2023 Which club will be a pleasant surprise? SW : The easy answer is Burnley but I don’t think anybody will be remotely surprised at their mid-table finish. But I bizarrely think that Everton will have a relatively serene season. MS : Bournemouth are tempting but they’re such a gloriously unknown quantity. Brentford will yet again tick along delightfully, taking a few more scalps along the way as they flirt with another top-half finish without anyone even noticing. JN : Burnley are the obvious choice for this one. There’s often one promoted club that outperforms expectations and I think Vinnie’s style will work well in the top flight. IW : Burnley will be fine but that will come as a shock to no-one. Everton not being sh*te might, though. DT : Burnley will be mid-table, and it’s up to you to decide whether this is pleasant or surprising. Spurs will play some wonderful attacking football and do some hilarious defending . The former at least might surprise some after the rancid football they’ve served up under a pair of misery-guts serial winners in the last few years, and the latter should be pleasant for everyone who isn’t a Spurs fan. WF : Sacking Gary O’Neil will pay off for Bournemouth, who will comfortably avoid relegation and play some decent football. JW : Luton Town. I watched the Hatters a lot last season and think they can cause a lot of Premier League teams problems with their physicality and direct play, while Rob Edwards has also demonstrated that he’s a brilliant tactician. I’m not tipping them for a top-half finish, but I think they have what it takes to avoid relegation. LO : AFC Bournemouth. Binning off Gary O’Neil is an inspired decision as Andoni Iraola is a clear upgrade. They’ll be comfy between 10th and 14th. JS : Tottenham. The expectations are very low so I feel like Ange Postecoglou’s style of play and a top-six finish (at worse) will be seen as a pleasant surprise. Who will win the Golden Boot? SW : Still can’t believe we didn’t opt for Haaland en masse this year. No chance of anybody else this time around. MS : Might as well skip this section, because: Erling Haaland. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Erling Haaland. IW : Haaland, obvs. DT : Erling Haaland, innit. Only one other person who could even theoretically come close and he might not even be here. WF : Erling Haaland by such a margin that we won’t be allowed to select him in the 2024/25 pre-season predictions. JW : Erling Haaland. You’d have to be proper daft to not pick him this time. Darwin Nunez, you let me down last season. LO : Erling Haaland. I’m not risking it this year. JS : Now is not the time for edginess. It will be the Nordic robot. Erling Haaland could score a couple more goals for Manchester City Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? SW : Andre Onana at Manchester United; he will single-handedly push Manchester United a bit further up the pitch and we should see a proper Ten Hag team. MS : A Jefferson Lerma with an entire pre-season worth of Roy Hodgson double training sessions is to be feared. And Pau Torres gives Aston Villa a whole new dimension. JN : James Trafford is a great signing for Burnley and could be the difference between struggling and surviving. And I fancy Andre Onana will oil United’s wheels and speed up their play, as well as making us all very happy when he’s lobbed 40 metres out of his goal. IW : The knives will be out for Andre Onana as soon as he gets tackled on the halfway-line while trying to Cruyff-turn away from Harry Kane next week. But the new United keeper will be a clear and obvious upgrade. DT : Jurrien Timber has probably got the least attention of Arsenal’s summer moves but is surely the most significant for being a) dead good and b) significantly reducing the chances of another title challenge falling to pieces because Rob Holding and his ludicrous hairhat have got involved. WF : Nicolas Jackson, partly because he’s good at football but mainly because of the incredibly low striker bar at Chelsea. JW : Moussa Diaby. The new Aston Villa signing contributed 14 goals and nine assists in all competitions last season. I reckon there’s an exciting season ahead for the France international and the Villans. LO : James Maddison. Spurs won’t be as sh*t as most are expecting them to be this season and he’s the Christian Eriksen replacement they have been craving . JS : Dominik Szoboszlai. No Bundesliga tax here. And which one will turn out to be a massive flop? SW : I just don’t see it with Kai Havertz – he will look exactly like the player that struggled at Chelsea. MS : Three words: The Pep Year. Three more words: Seventy-seven million. Another three words: Josko bloody Gvardiol. Then he will be absolutely unbelievable thereafter. JN : Rasmus Hojlund has strong Angel Di Maria vibes. £72million is a lot to pay for a player with his goal record. Will be only playing in the League Cup come the winter. IW : Sandro Tonali. He might make the best of it and turn out to be prime-Pirlo but it’s hard to shake the feeling that he doesn’t want to be there, or anywhere else but Milan. DT : Rasmus Hojlund will do precisely as well as a 20-year-old striker with a roughly one-in-three scoring record thrown into a new league can reasonably be expected to do, but that fee, the lack of any other centre-forward in Manchester United’s squad and the harsh but inevitable comparisons with Haaland down the road and Kane who United “should have signed” (even though they had no chance of doing so) means expectations will be far from reasonable and he is thus heading inexorably for flopsville. WF : Rasmus Hojlund. Huge pressure on a young striker. Will need a season to adapt but the Haaland comparisons have already started. JW : Rasmus Hojlund. There will be demands on the 20-year-old to score goals immediately because of his £72m transfer fee. Worrying rumours that the Dane is nursing a back injury in the early days of his time at Man Utd, potentially limiting his game time this season, will not fill the fans with confidence that he can improve on his tally of nine league goals for Atalanta last term. LO : Rasmus Hojlund. He’ll probably come good in the long run but Man Utd will rely on him too much during his debut season before he is ready. JS : I think Kai Havertz will be a popular choice so let’s go with Fulham’s Calvin Bassey. Raul Jimenez will be rubbish as well, for what it’s worth. Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? SW : Pau Torres for less than £28m is an astonishing signing from Aston Villa. Bloody good business. MS : It is quite unfathomably Ross Barkley time yet again. Matt Turner will also help keep Forest up for just £7m. JN : South Korean centre-back Ji-soo Kim cost Brentford £640,000. The 18-year-old is young and inexperienced but is good with both feet, tall and quick. There are a lot of bargains to be had in South Korea. He could be a real surprise package. IW : Mark Flekken could be a bargain in Brentford’s goal since he cost not far shy of a third of the fella he’s replacing. DT : I don’t really know why Sheffield United so casually sold Sander Berge for just £14m to a theoretical direct rival or why the entire bottom half of the Premier League weren’t all over that. So him, I guess. WF : Mahmoud Dahoud, because Brighton. JW : It’s hard to see where the goals are going to come from at Sheffield United and almost as difficult to find a player going for less than £15m this summer. For that reason I’m going to hope Benie Traore, signed from Swedish side Hacken for £4m, can score the goals to keep the Blades up. LO : Mahmoud Dahoud. A decent replacement for Alexis Mac Allister on a free. Great business. JS : Jefferson Lerma after joining Crystal Palace on a free transfer. I don’t think the extent of Mo Dahoud’s skillset has quite sunk in yet… on a free transfer too, we will be shown soon. 🪄 pic.twitter.com/IC2R3T5sL0 — Ryan (@ryanadsett) August 3, 2023 Who will be named the PFA Player of the Year? SW : Impossible to see beyond Erling Haaland now. Literally. He is massive. MS : Declan Rice. No, you’re an idiot. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Erling Haaland. IW : Factoring in the level of thought that goes into most players’ PFA vote, it’d be daft to say anyone but the lad who scores a mega-f***-tonne of goals. Haaland, then. DT : So boring to say Haaland. So correct, but so boring. We’re all going to say Haaland, aren’t we? He is an existential threat to the F365 Predictions and must be stopped/sold to Real Madrid at the earliest convenience. WF : Erling Haaland. JW : Erling Haaland. He is reyt good. LO : Bukayo Saka. Arsenal’s star boy will get loads of goals and assists en route to becoming a Premier League champion. JS : Erling Haaland will probably score a ridiculous amount of goals, so the natural choice is him. First manager to leave their Premier League job? SW : Whoever comes in at Wolves because that looks like a near-impossible job. MS : West Ham and David Moyes are clearly in the most successful and unbreakable of marriages at this point – one built on distrust and utter contempt for one another – so let’s say Marco Silva will regret turning down those Saudi riches. Aleksandar Mitrovic and Willian having their heads turned by Middle East interest, the absence or absolute loss of Joao Palhinha, a regression to the xG mean and some of those single-goal wins swinging the other way will all contribute to a tough start as Fulham finally accept they need to have at least three managers for one of their Premier League seasons to count. JN : The flies are surely already buzzing around David Moyes. People are saying he’s got credit in the bank after winning the Europa Conference League but a Hammers fan told me that it only felt like such a big, unlikely win precisely because they did it with Moyes as manager. A case of in spite of, not because of. I don’t fancy Paul Heckingbottom’s chances of being in work by Xmas either. IW : Gary O’Neil and Paul Heckingbottom might push him close, but anything less than a stellar start would give people at West Ham the excuse they want to bin David Moyes. DT : Gary O’Neil. He hasn’t even been appointed as I write, so that does give this even higher than normal potential for calamity, but Wolves look absolutely dreadful, have now had absolutely no meaningful pre-season whatsoever and face four of last season’s top six – Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Manchester City – before the end of September. Plus I’m not sure even Watford have ever managed to get first and second place in the Sack Race before, so that would be an achievement of sorts. WF : Roy Hodgson in the most mutual consent-y sacking in history. JW : David Moyes. There have already been rumblings of discontent over the summer. LO : David Moyes. The cracks are already clear to see. JS : David Moyes. West Ham are a mess. Pick the Champions League winner. SW : Real Madrid after the signing of Jude Bellingham. MS : Al-Hilal. Ah, gotcha. Last one before the Swiss model nonsense, isn’t it? City again. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Manchester City. IW : If Real get their hands on Kylian Mbappe, them. If not, urgh, City. DT : Must be Real Madrid’s turn again now. WF : Manchester City will win everything they give a toss about until Pep leaves. JW : Real Madrid. Jude Bellingham (and maybe Kylian Mbappe) to make the difference. LO : Real Madrid; a Jude Bellingham and Joselu masterclass is incoming. JS : Real Madrid. Have I really just predicted City to end the season without the PL or CL? In five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season. SW : Who will bottle this season?

Erik ten Hag needs to offload some members of his squad to raise funds for new recruits and Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer. Fulham's interest in a player United value around the £20million mark was the first to emerge and there were also talks with Turkish club Galatasaray. They made an undisclosed bid last month which was turned down by United , while Saudi Arabian clubs have also expressed an interest in the 30-year-old. But Fulham could now offer Fred the opportunity to remain in the Premier League as discussions continue. Fulham have re-opened talks with Manchester United over their Brazilian midfielder Fred Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer as United manager Erik ten Hag reshapes his team Fred signed for United from Shakhtar Donetsk for £52m in 2018 and has made 213 appearances across all competitions, scoring 14 times. While Fred can't be faulted for his work ethic, he has often frustrated fans by giving the ball away in midfield or rushing into tackles. Ten Hag did improve his ability to make late runs into opposition penalty boxes, as shown by a joint career-best return of six goals last season. He could join fellow midfielders Scott McTominay, who is wanted by West Ham , and Donny van de Beek, in talks with Spanish side Real Sociedad , in leaving United before the window closes. That would raise funds so Ten Hag can buy another midfielder, such as the Moroccan international Sofyan Amrabat , valued by Fiorentina at £30m. They also need reinforcements in defence following Harry Maguire's £30m move to West Ham. Talks have been held over a move for Nice's Jean-Clair Todibo, with Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba, Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi also names in the frame. Meanwhile, French club Amiens wants to take young United defender Teden Mengi on loan.

Wonderkid Palmer, who scored City's only goal in their Community Shield defeat by Arsenal at Wembley, will be hopeful of more game time this season after bursting onto the scene under Pep Guardiola and impressing in his sporadic appearances. However, with City actively working on a deal to lure Paqueta from the London Stadium, Palmer may once again find himself forced to settle for a bit-part role. As a result, West Ham will look to include the 21-year-old in negotiations with City over talisman Paqueta, either on loan or as part of a permanent move. That is according to the Evening Standard , who add that David Moyes may play Jarrod Bowen as a striker and deploy Palmer down the right wing instead. Palmer has been particularly effective when cutting in from the same flank, having jinked inside and beaten Aaron Ramsdale with a superb effort at the weekend. He is a seasoned international for England's U21s and has also attracted attention from the likes of Brighton, Burnley and Leicester this summer, various reports say. The starlet has been non-committal when questioned on his short-term future. 'Have to see what the plan is for next season, see where I am playing and hopefully play as many games as possible,' he said after City's recent loss. 'Hopefully we can win the treble again but that will be a difficult task. The lads have been sharp in training and hopefully we can do it all over again.' Paqueta, meanwhile, wants to join City this summer, Mail Sport understands. However, West Ham are keen to keep him despite a £70million bid being lodged. The midfielder became a key player under David Moyes last season, helping the club to their Europa Conference League triumph, and is a shock name on City's shortlist. And as a result, West Ham chairman David Sullivan is determined not to sell him. Having lost captain Declan Rice to Arsenal, Sullivan does not want to let another key player slip away to a Premier League rival and is, at least for now, standing firm.

We try and occupy the spaces that the opposition allow to go in. \"Sometimes we need Mako lower because they (Royal AM) were pressing with two, so Rele must keep the field ore opened, It's not Rele that it's Patrick, we don't mind as long as they are disciplined. \"The problem with a change of positions is the moment where you lose the ball. At the moment, they are doing very well when we lose the ball. \"They are disciplined, they follow their role to until the end. It's something we have been doing since last season and little by little it's getting better. \"It's the first time them play together, so there also moments that you can see that it is the first time. But they are very talented guys, they are real football players and it's easy [to work] with them.\" The win temporarily takes Pirates up to third spot on the DStv Premiership table. Up next for Riveiro's side is an MTN8 quarter-final clash against Sekhukhune United to be played at Orlando Stadium on Saturday.

The Super Falcons took England all the way to penalties in their last-16 tie, though Sarina Wiegman 's side were more clinical from the spot with a 4-2 shootout victory. Onumonu, who led the line for the African nation against the Lionesses, highlighted the difference in support that both teams receive back home. She told the Guardian : 'I've seen what England has access to. In Nigeria we don't have access to much. 'Our training fields aren't great. Where we sleep isn't great. Sometimes we share beds. Ifeoma Onumonu has opened up on Nigeria's unacceptable resources back home, days after the side were eliminated in the last-16 stage of the World Cup on penalties to England She claimed that the Super Falcons don't have access to a gym in camp in Nigeria and that players sometimes have to share beds 'It's not good enough. In terms of recovery we don't have much of any of that. We don't have access to a gym in camp in Nigeria. There's a lot that needs to be done.' The 29-year-old who plays for Gotham FC added that it was hard to adjust at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand. She said: 'We do what we can because we love playing for our country but hopefully they make it easier for us to do our best Back home the pitches aren't great. The grass is rocky, bumps everywhere. The stadium we play in for qualifying, you'd be surprised. She also revealed that the under-20s side were 'sleeping in airports for 24 hours' after they were knocked out of the U20 World Cup in the quarter-finals last year. 'That's not acceptable. What we have to fight for is bigger than us,' she said. Nigeria impressed at this summer's World Cup, going through their group unbeaten with draws against Canada and Republic of Ireland, with a victory over hosts Australia. However, they considered a boycott of their first match in the tournamen t after the squad were informed they won't be paid tournament match bonuses . Manager Randy Waldrum also heavily criticised the Nigerian FA in two different podcasts, which included comments about failing to pay players, poor facilities, a cancellation of a pre-tournament camp and interference in selection matters and staff appointments. Onumono admitted that it was hard to adjust to life at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand Nigeria boss Randy Waldrum heavily criticised the Nigerian FA in two different podcasts Ian Wright had his say on social media , tweeting 'Pay them!!!!!' after their defeat to England. Earlier this week, global players union' FIFPRO released a statement on behalf of the Nigeria Women's National team confirming they will assist the players in their ongoing dispute. 'Following the Nigeria women's national team's elimination from the FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFPRO can confirm it is assisting players in a disagreement with the Nigeria Football Federation concerning bonus payments, camp allowances and expenses, some of which date back to 2021. 'During the World Cup, the players expressed the desire to remain focused on their performance without making public statements or facing other distractions. However, the Super Falcons believe that it is now time for the Nigeria Football Federation to honour their commitments and pay the outstanding amounts. 'The team is extremely frustrated that they have had to pursue the Nigeria Football Federation for these payments before and during the tournament and may have to continue doing so afterwards. It is regrettable that players needed to challenge their own federation at such an important time in their careers. 'FIFPRO will continue to work with the players to ensure their contractual rights are honoured and the outstanding payments are settled.'

He then scored two goals in the friendlies he played in the Premier League Summer Series against Fulham and Brentford. The 24-year-old could play a key role for Villa next season as Emery's side set their sights on silverware having qualified for the Europa Conference League last term.

While only six of those players are at the World Cup, La Roja has already made history by qualifying for the quarterfinals for the first time in three appearances. “We are concentrating on what we’re doing now, the 23 players, we are committed to achieving the same objective with the same willpower and we want to continue in this World Cup,” said Ivana Andres, one of the half dozen who returned to the team. “We have an excellent relationship with Jorge,” added the Real Madrid defender. “We have total confidence in him. We believe that we are a team, not only the players but all the technical staff. And we all have shared responsibility in the match. If we win, we all win and if we lose, we all lose.” Damaris Egurrola, who was born in the U.S. to a Dutch mother and Spanish father, made her senior debut for Spain in 2019 but switched to the Netherlands in 2022, saying she had issues with Vilda. The Lyon midfielder will take the pitch for the Dutch on Friday. “We worry about our players and the players that we can include in the lineup and I would not change any of my 23 players for anyone else,” Vilda said when asked about Egurrola. The 42-year-old, who has coached Spain’s senior team since 2015, praised how hard his players have worked at the World Cup. “They have been impeccable in all training sessions. They are true professionals. And there is no doubt whatsoever about that,” Vilda said. “Today we trained in 6 degrees (43 Fahrenheit), windy, they did an excellent training session. “They trained when it was hot and also trained fabulously, and they’ve taken care of themselves to be in perfect conditions for the game.” Friday’s winner will face either Japan or Sweden in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Auckland.

The 2023/24 Premier League season is upon us and the predictions are in, with Arsenal, Rasmus Hojlund, David Moyes and many more featuring. As is traditional, tell me who will win the league. Sarah Winterburn : Last season I said Liverpool just to be contrary and then kicked myself because I never thought it would be anybody but Manchester City. No such mistake this time: Man City. Matt Stead : The squad might look a little different than was foreseen, but it has already been spoken: 2023/24 Premier League champions, Arsenal . John Nicholson : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Manchester City. Ian Watson : Arsenal are tempting, but not quite tempting enough. Manchester City. Dave Tickner : Manchester City, but stated with slightly less confidence than this time last year. Will Ford : Manchester City by a long, long way. Joe Williams : I predicted Liverpool last year as I told myself picking Manchester City was boring. I’m starting to think boring is almost always right though, so I’m going for Pep Guardiola’s side to win their fourth title on the bounce. Lewis Oldham : F*** it, Arsenal will do it. Three great signings (four with David Raya) and Man City will drop off after doing the treble. Jason Soutar : Arsenal are going to do it. I can feel it in my bones. Will Arsenal lift silverware again? And the rest of the top four, in order. Which nobody ever gets right. SW : Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea. It won’t be right; it’s never right. MS : Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea. JN : Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea. Spurs 5th, Villa 6th, Newcastle 7th. IW : Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool. Though I could say Chelsea, Newcastle, Spurs with almost equal conviction. DT : Arsenal, Manchester United and, oh, let’s say Spurs for shits and giggles. Does feel like the top three should be certainties and then it’s any one of four or five teams for that fourth spot. But even that equivocation will be wrong because as we all know by now this question is f***ing impossible. WF : Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United. A proper battle though – Chelsea not far behind. JW : Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United. LO : Man City, Liverpool and Man Utd. Aston Villa will not be far off in fifth while Newcastle and Spurs battle for sixth. JS : Man City, Man Utd, Liverpool. Fourth is wide open, though. If Villa or Spurs manage it I will not be surprised at all. Three picks for relegation please. SW : Luton and Sheffield United are surely doomed before a ball is kicked. The third is far more difficult but I will opt for Wolves as the squad and the manager will both be significantly weaker. I don’t like Bournemouth’s squad either but at least they have upgraded their coach. MS : Everton are surely gone this time. Yet they’re also going to scrape through again with sub-40 points nevertheless being enough to keep them clear of Sheffield United, Wolves and Luton. JN : Luton could shock everyone and stay up, but likely won’t. Nottingham Forest should be too poor away from home to survive another season but Sheffield United don’t appear to have the quality needed either, so I’ll take the Blades to go down. Wolves lack goals and have got the stench of decay about them. IW : I can’t make a case for Sheffield United staying up, and Luton will be the new Blackpool, spending the season being patronised all the way back to the Championship. Wolves will follow them. DT : Luton and Sheffield United don’t really look anywhere near what’s required sadly. And while there are several teams one can make a very strong case for in 18th it’s currently pretty hard to see past Wolves who’ve downgraded both squad and, at the very last minute, manager. We already feared for them, we really did , even before Lopetegui decided to sod it all for a game of soldiers. WF : Sheffield United and Luton won’t have anywhere near enough, and Everton – time to put them out of their misery. JW : Sheffield United, Bournemouth and Wolves. The less we talk about the Blades the better. LO : Luton Town (who will put up a great fight before finishing 18th) along with Wolves and Sheffield United (who have both had a nightmare this summer). Crystal Palace and Fulham will slump into a relegation scrap, while Everton will be boringly steady under Sean Dyche. JS : Sheffield United will finish 20th (sorry, JW). They’ll be joined in the bottom three by Luton – whose fine home form won’t be enough on its own – and Wolves. Once again, this is wide open and I think even West Ham, Fulham and Brentford could be in a spot of bother. Looking further down the league, I’d expect @LutonTown and @SheffieldUnited to struggle. The jump from The Championship to The @premierleague is huge. I’m also worried for @Wolves who have sold some of their best players and not replaced them. Expect @WestHam to spend most of… — Michael Owen (@themichaelowen) August 5, 2023 Which club will be a pleasant surprise? SW : The easy answer is Burnley but I don’t think anybody will be remotely surprised at their mid-table finish. But I bizarrely think that Everton will have a relatively serene season. MS : Bournemouth are tempting but they’re such a gloriously unknown quantity. Brentford will yet again tick along delightfully, taking a few more scalps along the way as they flirt with another top-half finish without anyone even noticing. JN : Burnley are the obvious choice for this one. There’s often one promoted club that outperforms expectations and I think Vinnie’s style will work well in the top flight. IW : Burnley will be fine but that will come as a shock to no-one. Everton not being sh*te might, though. DT : Burnley will be mid-table, and it’s up to you to decide whether this is pleasant or surprising. Spurs will play some wonderful attacking football and do some hilarious defending . The former at least might surprise some after the rancid football they’ve served up under a pair of misery-guts serial winners in the last few years, and the latter should be pleasant for everyone who isn’t a Spurs fan. WF : Sacking Gary O’Neil will pay off for Bournemouth, who will comfortably avoid relegation and play some decent football. JW : Luton Town. I watched the Hatters a lot last season and think they can cause a lot of Premier League teams problems with their physicality and direct play, while Rob Edwards has also demonstrated that he’s a brilliant tactician. I’m not tipping them for a top-half finish, but I think they have what it takes to avoid relegation. LO : AFC Bournemouth. Binning off Gary O’Neil is an inspired decision as Andoni Iraola is a clear upgrade. They’ll be comfy between 10th and 14th. JS : Tottenham. The expectations are very low so I feel like Ange Postecoglou’s style of play and a top-six finish (at worse) will be seen as a pleasant surprise. Who will win the Golden Boot? SW : Still can’t believe we didn’t opt for Haaland en masse this year. No chance of anybody else this time around. MS : Might as well skip this section, because: Erling Haaland. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Erling Haaland. IW : Haaland, obvs. DT : Erling Haaland, innit. Only one other person who could even theoretically come close and he might not even be here. WF : Erling Haaland by such a margin that we won’t be allowed to select him in the 2024/25 pre-season predictions. JW : Erling Haaland. You’d have to be proper daft to not pick him this time. Darwin Nunez, you let me down last season. LO : Erling Haaland. I’m not risking it this year. JS : Now is not the time for edginess. It will be the Nordic robot. Erling Haaland could score a couple more goals for Manchester City Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? SW : Andre Onana at Manchester United; he will single-handedly push Manchester United a bit further up the pitch and we should see a proper Ten Hag team. MS : A Jefferson Lerma with an entire pre-season worth of Roy Hodgson double training sessions is to be feared. And Pau Torres gives Aston Villa a whole new dimension. JN : James Trafford is a great signing for Burnley and could be the difference between struggling and surviving. And I fancy Andre Onana will oil United’s wheels and speed up their play, as well as making us all very happy when he’s lobbed 40 metres out of his goal. IW : The knives will be out for Andre Onana as soon as he gets tackled on the halfway-line while trying to Cruyff-turn away from Harry Kane next week. But the new United keeper will be a clear and obvious upgrade. DT : Jurrien Timber has probably got the least attention of Arsenal’s summer moves but is surely the most significant for being a) dead good and b) significantly reducing the chances of another title challenge falling to pieces because Rob Holding and his ludicrous hairhat have got involved. WF : Nicolas Jackson, partly because he’s good at football but mainly because of the incredibly low striker bar at Chelsea. JW : Moussa Diaby. The new Aston Villa signing contributed 14 goals and nine assists in all competitions last season. I reckon there’s an exciting season ahead for the France international and the Villans. LO : James Maddison. Spurs won’t be as sh*t as most are expecting them to be this season and he’s the Christian Eriksen replacement they have been craving . JS : Dominik Szoboszlai. No Bundesliga tax here. And which one will turn out to be a massive flop? SW : I just don’t see it with Kai Havertz – he will look exactly like the player that struggled at Chelsea. MS : Three words: The Pep Year. Three more words: Seventy-seven million. Another three words: Josko bloody Gvardiol. Then he will be absolutely unbelievable thereafter. JN : Rasmus Hojlund has strong Angel Di Maria vibes. £72million is a lot to pay for a player with his goal record. Will be only playing in the League Cup come the winter. IW : Sandro Tonali. He might make the best of it and turn out to be prime-Pirlo but it’s hard to shake the feeling that he doesn’t want to be there, or anywhere else but Milan. DT : Rasmus Hojlund will do precisely as well as a 20-year-old striker with a roughly one-in-three scoring record thrown into a new league can reasonably be expected to do, but that fee, the lack of any other centre-forward in Manchester United’s squad and the harsh but inevitable comparisons with Haaland down the road and Kane who United “should have signed” (even though they had no chance of doing so) means expectations will be far from reasonable and he is thus heading inexorably for flopsville. WF : Rasmus Hojlund. Huge pressure on a young striker. Will need a season to adapt but the Haaland comparisons have already started. JW : Rasmus Hojlund. There will be demands on the 20-year-old to score goals immediately because of his £72m transfer fee. Worrying rumours that the Dane is nursing a back injury in the early days of his time at Man Utd, potentially limiting his game time this season, will not fill the fans with confidence that he can improve on his tally of nine league goals for Atalanta last term. LO : Rasmus Hojlund. He’ll probably come good in the long run but Man Utd will rely on him too much during his debut season before he is ready. JS : I think Kai Havertz will be a popular choice so let’s go with Fulham’s Calvin Bassey. Raul Jimenez will be rubbish as well, for what it’s worth. Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? SW : Pau Torres for less than £28m is an astonishing signing from Aston Villa. Bloody good business. MS : It is quite unfathomably Ross Barkley time yet again. Matt Turner will also help keep Forest up for just £7m. JN : South Korean centre-back Ji-soo Kim cost Brentford £640,000. The 18-year-old is young and inexperienced but is good with both feet, tall and quick. There are a lot of bargains to be had in South Korea. He could be a real surprise package. IW : Mark Flekken could be a bargain in Brentford’s goal since he cost not far shy of a third of the fella he’s replacing. DT : I don’t really know why Sheffield United so casually sold Sander Berge for just £14m to a theoretical direct rival or why the entire bottom half of the Premier League weren’t all over that. So him, I guess. WF : Mahmoud Dahoud, because Brighton. JW : It’s hard to see where the goals are going to come from at Sheffield United and almost as difficult to find a player going for less than £15m this summer. For that reason I’m going to hope Benie Traore, signed from Swedish side Hacken for £4m, can score the goals to keep the Blades up. LO : Mahmoud Dahoud. A decent replacement for Alexis Mac Allister on a free. Great business. JS : Jefferson Lerma after joining Crystal Palace on a free transfer. I don’t think the extent of Mo Dahoud’s skillset has quite sunk in yet… on a free transfer too, we will be shown soon. 🪄 pic.twitter.com/IC2R3T5sL0 — Ryan (@ryanadsett) August 3, 2023 Who will be named the PFA Player of the Year? SW : Impossible to see beyond Erling Haaland now. Literally. He is massive. MS : Declan Rice. No, you’re an idiot. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Erling Haaland. IW : Factoring in the level of thought that goes into most players’ PFA vote, it’d be daft to say anyone but the lad who scores a mega-f***-tonne of goals. Haaland, then. DT : So boring to say Haaland. So correct, but so boring. We’re all going to say Haaland, aren’t we? He is an existential threat to the F365 Predictions and must be stopped/sold to Real Madrid at the earliest convenience. WF : Erling Haaland. JW : Erling Haaland. He is reyt good. LO : Bukayo Saka. Arsenal’s star boy will get loads of goals and assists en route to becoming a Premier League champion. JS : Erling Haaland will probably score a ridiculous amount of goals, so the natural choice is him. First manager to leave their Premier League job? SW : Whoever comes in at Wolves because that looks like a near-impossible job. MS : West Ham and David Moyes are clearly in the most successful and unbreakable of marriages at this point – one built on distrust and utter contempt for one another – so let’s say Marco Silva will regret turning down those Saudi riches. Aleksandar Mitrovic and Willian having their heads turned by Middle East interest, the absence or absolute loss of Joao Palhinha, a regression to the xG mean and some of those single-goal wins swinging the other way will all contribute to a tough start as Fulham finally accept they need to have at least three managers for one of their Premier League seasons to count. JN : The flies are surely already buzzing around David Moyes. People are saying he’s got credit in the bank after winning the Europa Conference League but a Hammers fan told me that it only felt like such a big, unlikely win precisely because they did it with Moyes as manager. A case of in spite of, not because of. I don’t fancy Paul Heckingbottom’s chances of being in work by Xmas either. IW : Gary O’Neil and Paul Heckingbottom might push him close, but anything less than a stellar start would give people at West Ham the excuse they want to bin David Moyes. DT : Gary O’Neil. He hasn’t even been appointed as I write, so that does give this even higher than normal potential for calamity, but Wolves look absolutely dreadful, have now had absolutely no meaningful pre-season whatsoever and face four of last season’s top six – Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Manchester City – before the end of September. Plus I’m not sure even Watford have ever managed to get first and second place in the Sack Race before, so that would be an achievement of sorts. WF : Roy Hodgson in the most mutual consent-y sacking in history. JW : David Moyes. There have already been rumblings of discontent over the summer. LO : David Moyes. The cracks are already clear to see. JS : David Moyes. West Ham are a mess. Pick the Champions League winner. SW : Real Madrid after the signing of Jude Bellingham. MS : Al-Hilal. Ah, gotcha. Last one before the Swiss model nonsense, isn’t it? City again. JN : There’s no point in thinking it will be anyone but Manchester City. IW : If Real get their hands on Kylian Mbappe, them. If not, urgh, City. DT : Must be Real Madrid’s turn again now. WF : Manchester City will win everything they give a toss about until Pep leaves. JW : Real Madrid. Jude Bellingham (and maybe Kylian Mbappe) to make the difference. LO : Real Madrid; a Jude Bellingham and Joselu masterclass is incoming. JS : Real Madrid. Have I really just predicted City to end the season without the PL or CL? In five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season. SW : Who will bottle this season? MS : Luton Town’s away end entrance. JN : Watching Scottish football drinking vodka. IW : Lots of new Prem goalkeepers. DT : Spurs bringing Bazball to football. WF : Kane-less Spurs winning a trophy JW : Brewster to get a goal. LO : Rotherham United staying up… again JS : Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka. ;","pubDate":"2023-08-10 07:26:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"football365","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fulham revive talks with Manchester United for £20m-rated Brazilian midfielder Fred, with Erik ten Hag keen to raise funds to bring in new recruits","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12392149/Fulham-revive-talks-Manchester-United-Brazil-midfielder-Fred-Erik-ten-Hag.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Erik ten Hag needs to offload some members of his squad to raise funds for new recruits and Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer.","content":"Fulham revive talks with Manchester United for £20m-rated Brazilian midfielder Fred, with Erik ten Hag keen to raise funds to bring in new recruits Fulham have been interested in the Brazilian midfielder, 30, all summer Talks have now re-opened after United turned down an offer from Galatasaray Erik ten Hag needs to offload players with three midfielders potentially leaving By Simon Jones and Adam Shergold for MailOnline Published: 07:24 BST, 10 August 2023 | Updated: 08:26 BST, 10 August 2023 e-mail 6 View comments Fulham have revived talks for Manchester United 's Brazilian midfielder Fred. Erik ten Hag needs to offload some members of his squad to raise funds for new recruits and Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer. Fulham's interest in a player United value around the £20million mark was the first to emerge and there were also talks with Turkish club Galatasaray. They made an undisclosed bid last month which was turned down by United , while Saudi Arabian clubs have also expressed an interest in the 30-year-old. But Fulham could now offer Fred the opportunity to remain in the Premier League as discussions continue. Fulham have re-opened talks with Manchester United over their Brazilian midfielder Fred Fred has been on the for-sale list all summer as United manager Erik ten Hag reshapes his team Fred signed for United from Shakhtar Donetsk for £52m in 2018 and has made 213 appearances across all competitions, scoring 14 times. While Fred can't be faulted for his work ethic, he has often frustrated fans by giving the ball away in midfield or rushing into tackles. Ten Hag did improve his ability to make late runs into opposition penalty boxes, as shown by a joint career-best return of six goals last season. He could join fellow midfielders Scott McTominay, who is wanted by West Ham , and Donny van de Beek, in talks with Spanish side Real Sociedad , in leaving United before the window closes. That would raise funds so Ten Hag can buy another midfielder, such as the Moroccan international Sofyan Amrabat , valued by Fiorentina at £30m. They also need reinforcements in defence following Harry Maguire's £30m move to West Ham. Talks have been held over a move for Nice's Jean-Clair Todibo, with Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba, Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi also names in the frame. Meanwhile, French club Amiens wants to take young United defender Teden Mengi on loan.
