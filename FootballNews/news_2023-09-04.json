As part of the campaign, this week sees the Citizens' prolific forward sit down with KickOff and share some of how it felt to make his debut along with Rhodes' views on his \"sexy\" style and how he deals with disappointment. I knew from my time at Hellenic because me and Mark Byrne were very close and he made it clear to me that I had the potential to make it to the top. He made me make sacrifices like moving me out of Atlantis away from my family, put me in a school so I knew that at some point I had to make it. I can't go through all this stuff and not reach the finish line. Just two years ago, I was sitting in the stand watching Cape Town City and Ajax Cape Town play against each other and here I am the field. It was a big achievement. Neymar, he is creative and stylish. I am that kind of player. In this world, it is you versus you. If you don't go out there and get it, no one is going to do it for you. I prefer a bit of both. It depends on the occasion, I like to mix it up sometimes a nice oversized t-shirt with jeans. Keagan Buchanan. Keagan Buchanan, if you go to his Instagram. The tattoos, the jewellery he has on, everything is stylish. The stuff that goes on social media can affect your mind and thinking, So it is not good for you but its not all bad. I am a person that loves to ignore negative comments, i don't still bother by replying or reading that stuff. It depends on my mood so maybe i will go the mall but I love going to the beach where I kick the ball around. The sport I love besides soccer is tennis. I grew up watching tennis and my favourite player is Rafael Nadal. I'm not bad at playing tennis, I can play but I won't say I am good at it. If it wasn't for soccer I don't know where I would be. Growing up, it was something else. I went on wrong route. Soccer saved my life. Another career i would consider is being a model. Giveon, Meek Mill and Nipsey Hussle. Before I go onto the pitch, I listen to Stay from Rihanna and after that I will listen to Meek Mill to get me hyped up. Sometimes it is tough to deal with it but you can't be too hard on yourself. You may feel disappointment but there is always a next game to improve and a next training session to improve. If you want to go get something, never stop never settle keep going. That football can change very quickly. it can take you up but it can take you down as well. Someone who is experienced told me this. Sexy Piano, this is the instrument I always wanted to play. I just love the way it sounds.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:36:50","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8931/2c01d7b2e6b6489c885e371bd6f8b01e.jpg","source_id":"snl24","source_priority":103202,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"863a6c16186ab00a2b6713da74fec8cb","title":"OL : la nouvelle annonce pol√©mique de Blanc sur son avenir, Cucci y va aussi de sa sortie !","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/ol/actualite/ol-psg-laurent-blanc-a-vecu-un-cauchemar-son-president-entretient-le-flou-sur-la-suite-832009","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Alors que son avenir √† l'OL semble tr√®s compromis, Laurent Blanc n'a pas eu droit √† un soutien tr√®s franc de son pr√©sident √† l'issue de la d√©route face au PSG (1-4).

Lourdement battu par le PSG (1-4), le C√©v√©nol a reconnu avoir v√©cu ¬´ un cauchemar ¬ª durant ¬´ tout le match ¬ª : ¬´ Dans l'analyse, tout le monde a sa part de responsabilit√©. Si l'objectif est de se qualifier en Ligue des champions, comme vous le dites, on a vraiment beaucoup de travail. On a des probl√®mes, il va falloir les r√©gler ¬ª. ¬´ Je ne suis pas dans une meilleure situation qu‚Äôavant ¬ª Alpagu√© par les Bad Gones qui ont d√©ploy√© un cinglant message √† son endroit (¬´ Blanc, si tu n'as plus les couilles de te battre, d√©missionne ¬ª), Laurent Blanc - qui avait √©chang√© avec son pr√©sident d√©l√©gu√© Santiago Cucci juste avant dans le vestiaire - n‚Äôa pas voulu r√©pondre en conf√©rence de presse d‚Äôapr√®s-match : ¬´ Je ne vais pas parler de √ßa parce que je vais √™tre un peu cru. Les supporters ont raison d'√™tre d√©√ßus. Est-ce que je suis menac√© ? Quand un entra√Æneur n'a pas de r√©sultat, il est en danger. Donc ce soir apr√®s ce match, je ne suis pas dans une meilleure situation qu'avant. ¬ª Au micro d‚ÄôAmazon Prime Vid√©o, l‚Äôancien coach du PSG a √©galement √©t√© interrog√© sur son avenir. ¬´ La question ne s‚Äôest pas pas pos√©e. J‚Äôessaierais d‚Äô√™tre l√† dans 15 jours ¬ª, a-t-il r√©pondu avec le sourire aux l√®vres. Une sortie et une attitude qui ne manquent pas de faire pol√©mique. Cucci veut un ¬´ entra√Æneur qui entra√Æne ¬ª Ce n‚Äôest d‚Äôailleurs pas les propos de Santiago Cucci face √† la presse en parall√®le de son passage en conf√©rence de presse qui sont de nature √† rassurer sur son cas : ¬´ Laurent Blanc ? Ce n'est pas le sujet. Je ne vais pas vous r√©pondre tout de suite. Il faut un entra√Æneur qui entra√Æne. ¬ª Relanc√© sur le fait que cette phrase ressemblait √† une pique √† Laurent Blanc, l‚Äôancien PDG de Levi‚Äôs Europe a d√©menti : ¬´ Je ne suis pas en train de vous dire √ßa. Il n'y a pas que lui qui est responsable, ce n'est pas lui qui joue au foot ¬ª. La quinzaine risque d‚Äô√™tre anim√©e √† Lyon‚Ä¶ Et si Botafogo a refus√© la d√©mission de Bruno Lage (et donc son arriv√©e anticip√©e dans la Capitale des Gaules !), rien ne dit que l‚ÄôOL ne cherchera pas quelqu‚Äôun d‚Äôautre pour relancer les Gones, d√©sormais derniers de Ligue 1.

It comes after the Manchester United winger hit out at the Dutchman following claims he dropped Sancho due to the manner of his performances in training. Sancho failed to make the bench as his United team-mates slumped to a 3-1 defeat against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Ten Hag said following the clash: \"Jadon, on his performances in training we did not select him. \"You have to reach a level every day at Manchester United and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\" It prompted the England international to respond on social media as he issued a statement defending his performances at Carrington - declaring there were exterior motives behind his omission. Now Arsenal fan Morgan has stirred the pot, tweeting : \"Hi Jadon, come on @PiersUncensored and I‚Äôll get you out of this Ten Hag nightmare.\" It's safe to say it's unlikely Sancho will be taking Morgan up on his offer, like Cristiano Ronaldo did last year, as he awaits his potential fate at Carrington on Monday. The 23-year-old said on his social media channels: \"Please don't believe everything you read. \"I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself very well in training this week. \"I believe there are other reasons for this matter that I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair!\" Sancho, who has featured in all three of United's other Premier League matches, added: \"All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to my team. \"I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and am grateful to do so, which I know every week is a challenge. \"I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what.\" Last year, Sancho was exiled from the United first-team picture and was sent to Holland during the World Cup to work on his performance and fitness levels with a private coach. He was later reintegrated into the United setup and was back with a bang as he inspired a fightback against Leeds from the bench at Old Trafford in February. However, he has since struggled to nail down a starting berth despite United's struggles in attack and now Sancho is facing yet another obstacle as he bids to turn his Old Trafford career around. Sancho has not been part of an England squad since way back in October 2021 when he provided two assists in a 5-0 win over Andorra.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"express","source_priority":1139,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0025080afcbe7d976e84918591f0d2fe","title":"Arsenal recreate the Battle of Old Trafford with pizzas all round in Man Utd victory","link":"https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1808963/Arsenal-Battle-of-Old-Trafford-Man-Utd","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"COMMENT: Arsenal celebrated their victory over Man Utd in style","content":"It was as if Martin Keown was bouncing in the face of Ruud van Nistelrooy all over again. The late drama of 2003‚Äôs Battle of Old Trafford was being repeated here at the Emirates as Arsenal snatched victory from what looked like a last-gasp defeat. And boy did the Gunners celebrate it. Pizzas all round, no doubt! As the emotions ebbed away with the fans into the unseasonably warm London evening, cold reason could only conclude it was a win that Arsenal had deserved. They had dominated most of the match and some better, more incisive finishing in front of goal might have given them the win before all the late drama. Any sort of drama would have been welcome in a fairly drab first half save for a couple of minutes which served up goals at either end. Kai Havertz had already fluffed an appalling left-foot shot with the goal at his mercy in the 13th minute, then gave the ball away cheaply in the 27th. Christian Eriksen‚Äôs pass was as immaculate as ever and Marcus Rashford was on it straight away, his shot was too strong to be pushed away by the fingertips of Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal responded to going behind against the run of play instantly, though when Martin Odegaard hammered in a drive from the edge of the area. That was pretty much it until an incident on the hour-mark that would be a prelude to all the drama. When Havertz went to the floor under challenge from Aaron Wan-Bissake, referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot. It looked clumsy, but every replay seemed to show less and less contact, until eventually Australian VAR Jarred Gillett, still establishing himself in this country, made the brave call to suggest arguably the country‚Äôs leading official had possibly made a mistake. (It‚Äôs supposed to take out the human element, right?) The important thing was that Taylor agreed after looking at the monitor and it looked as though United were going to hold on for a point they ill-deserved. Rasmus Winther Hojlund finally came on for his debut and looked abrasive and bristling, but was fighting a lone battle with no real understanding with the players around him. At the other end, United were to end the game with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans. The first game after the window had shut, nothing about it was saying title challengers. Yet Erik Ten Hag and his player thought they had nicked all three of the points. Substitute Alejandro Garnacho ran clear on a counter-attack in the 87th minute and coolly slid the ball past Ramsdale as the away fans went wild. VAR had not finished for the evening, though - and after an agonising couple of minutes decided the Argentina international had started marginally offside. That was just the start of it. Eight minutes of additional time were indicated and in the sixth of these Declan Rice bundled the ball home and a slight deflection off Evans was no more than he deserved for another commanding midfield performance. The Emirates went mad. Assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg was booked for going a bit too wild, but as with Keown all those years ago when Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a last-minute penalty to leave the game goalless, there was a lot of emotion sitting behind that dam. These days, though, we have added time to the added time and United sense there was still time for one last twist. Instead, it was Gabriel Jesus who sprinted from the half-way line, left Diago Dalot on his backside and swept the ball into the empty corner of the net. The scoreline certainly could have been very different, but ultimately the worry for Ten Hag is it was probably a fair reflection of the relative balance between these two auld enemies at the moment.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"express","source_priority":1139,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"65cfdc8d62c2d085bb0da49a52e94a8c","title":"ASSE : Batlles prend une premi√®re d√©cision radicale √† la tr√™ve","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/actualite/asse-batlles-prend-une-premiere-decision-radicale-a-la-treve-832024","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tr√®s d√©√ßu et frustr√© par le nouveau match nul de l‚ÄôAS Saint-√âtienne contre le Valenciennes FC samedi lors de la 5e journ√©e de Ligue 2 (1-1), Laurent Batlles a pris une d√©cision radicale √† la tr√™ve.","content":"L‚ÄôASSE n‚Äôavance pas.

The Reds beat Aston Villa to make it three wins and a draw in their opening four games of the new campaign, easing to a 3-0 victory at Anfield. The season opened with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea before a victory over Bournemouth at Anfield. Liverpool then travelled to St James' Park, seeing Virgil van Dijk sent off and falling behind to a Anthony Gordon goal. Darwin Nunez came off the bench to score twice late on to win the game for Liverpool. However, injury problems are starting to add up for Jurgen Klopp, with Trent Alexander-Arnold substituted with a hamstring concern against Villa. Even just a few weeks into the new season the Reds have a number of injuries to contend with. But Klopp will hope to have some players back fit after the international break, below is the latest Liverpool injury news: Trent Alexander-Arnold took a knock in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa, limping off and straight down the tunnel with just under 20 minutes to play. Jurgen Klopp admitted afterwards that it was a hamstring problem and that the Scouse full-back would need a scan to discover the extent of any damage. Speaking on the injury, Klopp said: \"I asked him and he said it‚Äôs (his) hamstring. Not too serious is his opinion, but we obviously have to wait for the scans. Then we will know more.\" French defender Ibrahima Konate missed the wins over Newcastle and Aston Villa with Jurgen Klopp hopeful he'd be fit for Wolves after the international break. But with France initially selecting the centre-back for their squad to face Ireland and Germany, before swapping for Jean-Clair Tobido, it has raised fears that the injury is worse than first thought. The hamstring problem wasn't believed to be too serious, but Liverpool will be hoping he's back fit for Wolves. T was close to a long awaited return to action before suffering a setback in training and remaining sidelined. Jurgen Klopp confirmed that, like Curtis Jones, the Spaniard would be back in training after Newcastle, but the Spaniard would return too quickly and will now try to get back to fill fitness during the international break. \"Thiago had a little setback. He started training with the team and had a little setback so we have to slow down there a little bit,\" Klopp said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not cool for him, it‚Äôs not cool for us but it‚Äôs how it is. Thiago will use the (September) international break for that, to be up to speed I‚Äôm pretty sure. It should hopefully be enough. All the rest are available.‚Äù The young full-back showed potential with pre-season performances in Germany, playing 90 minutes over the course of two fixtures. He was then left out of the group that travelled to Singapore following a minor, unspecified injury and has not featured in any matchday squads since the start of the season, though has been involved in training since his team-mates returned to England. Once fit the Northern Irishman is expected to slot into Klopp's plans as understudy to Alexander-Arnold, having proven himself in League One with Bolton Wanderers last year.

The incident happened towards the end of the game after Alejandro Garnacho looked to have won the match for United in the 88th minute before VAR ruled the goal out.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 08:10:20","image_url":"https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/resources/images/17186800/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"oxfordmail","source_priority":41844596,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d41cc15c98be7b4f910b2680eac345de","title":"–ë–æ–¥–∏–≥–∞—Ä–¥—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –ú–µ—Å–∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ –≤ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ (–≤–∏–¥–µ–æ)","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/drugi/multimedia/video/bodigardyt-na-mesi-otnovo-v-dejstvie-video-752034","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"...","content":"–ê—Ä–∂–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä–∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –õ–∏–æ–Ω–µ–ª –ú–µ—Å–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–∞–≤–∞ –¥–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏ —Ñ—É—Ä–æ—Ä –≤ –°–ê–©. –ü—Ä–µ–¥–∏ —á–∞—Å–æ–≤–µ –Ω–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏—è—Ç –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä –ú–∞—è–º–∏ —É—Å–ø—è –¥–∞ –Ω–∞–¥–≤–∏–µ –Ω–æ–≤–∏—è —Ç–∏–º –Ω–∞ –§–∏–ª–∏–ø –ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç–µ–≤ –õ–æ—Å –ê–Ω–¥–∂–µ–ª–∏—Å –§–ö —Å 3:1 –≤ –º–∞—á –æ—Ç –ú–õ–°. –ú–µ—Å–∏ —Å–µ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏ —Å –¥–≤–µ –∞—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ –≤ –¥–≤—É–±–æ—è. –û–∫–æ–ª–æ –∞—Ä–∂–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–µ–Ω—Ü–∞ –Ω–∞—à—É–º—è –∏ –±–æ–¥–∏–≥–∞—Ä–¥—ä—Ç –º—É, –∫–æ–π—Ç–æ –ø–∞–∑–∏ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤–Ω–∏—è —à–∞–º–ø–∏–æ–Ω –Ω–µ —Å–∞–º–æ –∏–∑–≤—ä–Ω —Ç–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ, –Ω–æ –∏ –ø–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –Ω–∞ –º–∞—á–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ. –í –µ–¥–Ω–∞ –æ—Ç —Å—Ä–µ—â–∏—Ç–µ —Ç–æ–π –±–µ —É–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω –∫–∞–∫ —Ç–∏—á–∞ –∫—Ä–∞–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥–∏ –∑–∞ –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–µ—Å–∏. –í –º–∞—á–∞ —Å—Ä–µ—â—É –õ–æ—Å –ê–Ω–¥–∂–µ–ª–∏—Å –§–ö –ø—ä–∫ –±–æ–¥–∏–≥–∞—Ä–¥—ä—Ç —Å–µ –Ω–∞–º–µ—Å–∏ –ø–æ-–±—ä—Ä–∑–æ –æ—Ç —Å—Ç—é–∞—Ä–¥–∏—Ç–µ, –∫–æ–≥–∞—Ç–æ —Ñ–µ–Ω –Ω–∞—Ö–ª—É –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–æ–Ω–∞, –∑–∞ –¥–∞ —Å—Ç–∏–≥–Ω–µ –¥–æ –õ–∏–æ–Ω–µ–ª –ú–µ—Å–∏. –ú—ä–∂—ä—Ç —Å–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏ –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ —Å—ä—Å –∑–∞–ø–∞–ª—è–Ω–∫–æ—Ç–æ, —Å–ª–µ–¥ –∫–æ–µ—Ç–æ –≥–æ \"–ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞–¥–µ\" –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—é–∞—Ä–¥–∏—Ç–µ.

As part of the campaign, this week sees the Citizens' prolific forward sit down with KickOff and share some of how it felt to make his debut along with Rhodes' views on his \"sexy\" style and how he deals with disappointment. I knew from my time at Hellenic because me and Mark Byrne were very close and he made it clear to me that I had the potential to make it to the top. He made me make sacrifices like moving me out of Atlantis away from my family, put me in a school so I knew that at some point I had to make it. I can't go through all this stuff and not reach the finish line. Just two years ago, I was sitting in the stand watching Cape Town City and Ajax Cape Town play against each other and here I am the field. It was a big achievement. Neymar, he is creative and stylish. I am that kind of player. In this world, it is you versus you. If you don't go out there and get it, no one is going to do it for you. I prefer a bit of both. It depends on the occasion, I like to mix it up sometimes a nice oversized t-shirt with jeans. Keagan Buchanan. Keagan Buchanan, if you go to his Instagram. The tattoos, the jewellery he has on, everything is stylish. The stuff that goes on social media can affect your mind and thinking, So it is not good for you but its not all bad. I am a person that loves to ignore negative comments, i don't still bother by replying or reading that stuff. It depends on my mood so maybe i will go the mall but I love going to the beach where I kick the ball around. The sport I love besides soccer is tennis. I grew up watching tennis and my favourite player is Rafael Nadal. I'm not bad at playing tennis, I can play but I won't say I am good at it. If it wasn't for soccer I don't know where I would be. Growing up, it was something else. I went on wrong route. Soccer saved my life. Another career i would consider is being a model. Giveon, Meek Mill and Nipsey Hussle. Before I go onto the pitch, I listen to Stay from Rihanna and after that I will listen to Meek Mill to get me hyped up. Sometimes it is tough to deal with it but you can't be too hard on yourself. You may feel disappointment but there is always a next game to improve and a next training session to improve. If you want to go get something, never stop never settle keep going. That football can change very quickly. it can take you up but it can take you down as well. Someone who is experienced told me this. Sexy Piano, this is the instrument I always wanted to play. I just love the way it sounds.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:36:50","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8931/2c01d7b2e6b6489c885e371bd6f8b01e.jpg","source_id":"snl24","source_priority":103202,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"863a6c16186ab00a2b6713da74fec8cb","title":"OL : la nouvelle annonce pol√©mique de Blanc sur son avenir, Cucci y va aussi de sa sortie !","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/ol/actualite/ol-psg-laurent-blanc-a-vecu-un-cauchemar-son-president-entretient-le-flou-sur-la-suite-832009","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Alors que son avenir √† l'OL semble tr√®s compromis, Laurent Blanc n'a pas eu droit √† un soutien tr√®s franc de son pr√©sident √† l'issue de la d√©route face au PSG (1-4).

Lourdement battu par le PSG (1-4), le C√©v√©nol a reconnu avoir v√©cu ¬´ un cauchemar ¬ª durant ¬´ tout le match ¬ª : ¬´ Dans l'analyse, tout le monde a sa part de responsabilit√©. Si l'objectif est de se qualifier en Ligue des champions, comme vous le dites, on a vraiment beaucoup de travail. On a des probl√®mes, il va falloir les r√©gler ¬ª. ¬´ Je ne suis pas dans une meilleure situation qu‚Äôavant ¬ª Alpagu√© par les Bad Gones qui ont d√©ploy√© un cinglant message √† son endroit (¬´ Blanc, si tu n'as plus les couilles de te battre, d√©missionne ¬ª), Laurent Blanc - qui avait √©chang√© avec son pr√©sident d√©l√©gu√© Santiago Cucci juste avant dans le vestiaire - n‚Äôa pas voulu r√©pondre en conf√©rence de presse d‚Äôapr√®s-match : ¬´ Je ne vais pas parler de √ßa parce que je vais √™tre un peu cru. Les supporters ont raison d'√™tre d√©√ßus. Est-ce que je suis menac√© ? Quand un entra√Æneur n'a pas de r√©sultat, il est en danger. Donc ce soir apr√®s ce match, je ne suis pas dans une meilleure situation qu'avant. ¬ª Au micro d‚ÄôAmazon Prime Vid√©o, l‚Äôancien coach du PSG a √©galement √©t√© interrog√© sur son avenir. ¬´ La question ne s‚Äôest pas pas pos√©e. J‚Äôessaierais d‚Äô√™tre l√† dans 15 jours ¬ª, a-t-il r√©pondu avec le sourire aux l√®vres. Une sortie et une attitude qui ne manquent pas de faire pol√©mique. Cucci veut un ¬´ entra√Æneur qui entra√Æne ¬ª Ce n‚Äôest d‚Äôailleurs pas les propos de Santiago Cucci face √† la presse en parall√®le de son passage en conf√©rence de presse qui sont de nature √† rassurer sur son cas : ¬´ Laurent Blanc ? Ce n'est pas le sujet. Je ne vais pas vous r√©pondre tout de suite. Il faut un entra√Æneur qui entra√Æne. ¬ª Relanc√© sur le fait que cette phrase ressemblait √† une pique √† Laurent Blanc, l‚Äôancien PDG de Levi‚Äôs Europe a d√©menti : ¬´ Je ne suis pas en train de vous dire √ßa. Il n'y a pas que lui qui est responsable, ce n'est pas lui qui joue au foot ¬ª. La quinzaine risque d‚Äô√™tre anim√©e √† Lyon‚Ä¶ Et si Botafogo a refus√© la d√©mission de Bruno Lage (et donc son arriv√©e anticip√©e dans la Capitale des Gaules !), rien ne dit que l‚ÄôOL ne cherchera pas quelqu‚Äôun d‚Äôautre pour relancer les Gones, d√©sormais derniers de Ligue 1.

It comes after the Manchester United winger hit out at the Dutchman following claims he dropped Sancho due to the manner of his performances in training. Sancho failed to make the bench as his United team-mates slumped to a 3-1 defeat against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Ten Hag said following the clash: \"Jadon, on his performances in training we did not select him. \"You have to reach a level every day at Manchester United and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\" It prompted the England international to respond on social media as he issued a statement defending his performances at Carrington - declaring there were exterior motives behind his omission. Now Arsenal fan Morgan has stirred the pot, tweeting : \"Hi Jadon, come on @PiersUncensored and I‚Äôll get you out of this Ten Hag nightmare.\" It's safe to say it's unlikely Sancho will be taking Morgan up on his offer, like Cristiano Ronaldo did last year, as he awaits his potential fate at Carrington on Monday. The 23-year-old said on his social media channels: \"Please don't believe everything you read. \"I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself very well in training this week. \"I believe there are other reasons for this matter that I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair!\" Sancho, who has featured in all three of United's other Premier League matches, added: \"All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to my team. \"I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and am grateful to do so, which I know every week is a challenge. \"I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what.\" Last year, Sancho was exiled from the United first-team picture and was sent to Holland during the World Cup to work on his performance and fitness levels with a private coach. He was later reintegrated into the United setup and was back with a bang as he inspired a fightback against Leeds from the bench at Old Trafford in February. However, he has since struggled to nail down a starting berth despite United's struggles in attack and now Sancho is facing yet another obstacle as he bids to turn his Old Trafford career around. Sancho has not been part of an England squad since way back in October 2021 when he provided two assists in a 5-0 win over Andorra.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"express","source_priority":1139,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0025080afcbe7d976e84918591f0d2fe","title":"Arsenal recreate the Battle of Old Trafford with pizzas all round in Man Utd victory","link":"https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1808963/Arsenal-Battle-of-Old-Trafford-Man-Utd","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"COMMENT: Arsenal celebrated their victory over Man Utd in style","content":"It was as if Martin Keown was bouncing in the face of Ruud van Nistelrooy all over again. The late drama of 2003‚Äôs Battle of Old Trafford was being repeated here at the Emirates as Arsenal snatched victory from what looked like a last-gasp defeat. And boy did the Gunners celebrate it. Pizzas all round, no doubt! As the emotions ebbed away with the fans into the unseasonably warm London evening, cold reason could only conclude it was a win that Arsenal had deserved. They had dominated most of the match and some better, more incisive finishing in front of goal might have given them the win before all the late drama. Any sort of drama would have been welcome in a fairly drab first half save for a couple of minutes which served up goals at either end. Kai Havertz had already fluffed an appalling left-foot shot with the goal at his mercy in the 13th minute, then gave the ball away cheaply in the 27th. Christian Eriksen‚Äôs pass was as immaculate as ever and Marcus Rashford was on it straight away, his shot was too strong to be pushed away by the fingertips of Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal responded to going behind against the run of play instantly, though when Martin Odegaard hammered in a drive from the edge of the area. That was pretty much it until an incident on the hour-mark that would be a prelude to all the drama. When Havertz went to the floor under challenge from Aaron Wan-Bissake, referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot. It looked clumsy, but every replay seemed to show less and less contact, until eventually Australian VAR Jarred Gillett, still establishing himself in this country, made the brave call to suggest arguably the country‚Äôs leading official had possibly made a mistake. (It‚Äôs supposed to take out the human element, right?) The important thing was that Taylor agreed after looking at the monitor and it looked as though United were going to hold on for a point they ill-deserved. Rasmus Winther Hojlund finally came on for his debut and looked abrasive and bristling, but was fighting a lone battle with no real understanding with the players around him. At the other end, United were to end the game with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans. The first game after the window had shut, nothing about it was saying title challengers. Yet Erik Ten Hag and his player thought they had nicked all three of the points. Substitute Alejandro Garnacho ran clear on a counter-attack in the 87th minute and coolly slid the ball past Ramsdale as the away fans went wild. VAR had not finished for the evening, though - and after an agonising couple of minutes decided the Argentina international had started marginally offside. That was just the start of it. Eight minutes of additional time were indicated and in the sixth of these Declan Rice bundled the ball home and a slight deflection off Evans was no more than he deserved for another commanding midfield performance. The Emirates went mad. Assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg was booked for going a bit too wild, but as with Keown all those years ago when Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a last-minute penalty to leave the game goalless, there was a lot of emotion sitting behind that dam. These days, though, we have added time to the added time and United sense there was still time for one last twist. Instead, it was Gabriel Jesus who sprinted from the half-way line, left Diago Dalot on his backside and swept the ball into the empty corner of the net. The scoreline certainly could have been very different, but ultimately the worry for Ten Hag is it was probably a fair reflection of the relative balance between these two auld enemies at the moment.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"express","source_priority":1139,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"65cfdc8d62c2d085bb0da49a52e94a8c","title":"ASSE : Batlles prend une premi√®re d√©cision radicale √† la tr√™ve","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/actualite/asse-batlles-prend-une-premiere-decision-radicale-a-la-treve-832024","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tr√®s d√©√ßu et frustr√© par le nouveau match nul de l‚ÄôAS Saint-√âtienne contre le Valenciennes FC samedi lors de la 5e journ√©e de Ligue 2 (1-1), Laurent Batlles a pris une d√©cision radicale √† la tr√™ve.","content":"L‚ÄôASSE n‚Äôavance pas.

The Reds beat Aston Villa to make it three wins and a draw in their opening four games of the new campaign, easing to a 3-0 victory at Anfield. The season opened with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea before a victory over Bournemouth at Anfield. Liverpool then travelled to St James' Park, seeing Virgil van Dijk sent off and falling behind to a Anthony Gordon goal. Darwin Nunez came off the bench to score twice late on to win the game for Liverpool. However, injury problems are starting to add up for Jurgen Klopp, with Trent Alexander-Arnold substituted with a hamstring concern against Villa. Even just a few weeks into the new season the Reds have a number of injuries to contend with. But Klopp will hope to have some players back fit after the international break, below is the latest Liverpool injury news: Trent Alexander-Arnold took a knock in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa, limping off and straight down the tunnel with just under 20 minutes to play. Jurgen Klopp admitted afterwards that it was a hamstring problem and that the Scouse full-back would need a scan to discover the extent of any damage. Speaking on the injury, Klopp said: \"I asked him and he said it‚Äôs (his) hamstring. Not too serious is his opinion, but we obviously have to wait for the scans. Then we will know more.\" French defender Ibrahima Konate missed the wins over Newcastle and Aston Villa with Jurgen Klopp hopeful he'd be fit for Wolves after the international break. But with France initially selecting the centre-back for their squad to face Ireland and Germany, before swapping for Jean-Clair Tobido, it has raised fears that the injury is worse than first thought. The hamstring problem wasn't believed to be too serious, but Liverpool will be hoping he's back fit for Wolves. T was close to a long awaited return to action before suffering a setback in training and remaining sidelined. Jurgen Klopp confirmed that, like Curtis Jones, the Spaniard would be back in training after Newcastle, but the Spaniard would return too quickly and will now try to get back to fill fitness during the international break. \"Thiago had a little setback. He started training with the team and had a little setback so we have to slow down there a little bit,\" Klopp said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not cool for him, it‚Äôs not cool for us but it‚Äôs how it is. Thiago will use the (September) international break for that, to be up to speed I‚Äôm pretty sure. It should hopefully be enough. All the rest are available.‚Äù The young full-back showed potential with pre-season performances in Germany, playing 90 minutes over the course of two fixtures. He was then left out of the group that travelled to Singapore following a minor, unspecified injury and has not featured in any matchday squads since the start of the season, though has been involved in training since his team-mates returned to England. Once fit the Northern Irishman is expected to slot into Klopp's plans as understudy to Alexander-Arnold, having proven himself in League One with Bolton Wanderers last year.

The incident happened towards the end of the game after Alejandro Garnacho looked to have won the match for United in the 88th minute before VAR ruled the goal out.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 08:10:20","image_url":"https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/resources/images/17186800/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"oxfordmail","source_priority":41844596,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d41cc15c98be7b4f910b2680eac345de","title":"–ë–æ–¥–∏–≥–∞—Ä–¥—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –ú–µ—Å–∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ –≤ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ (–≤–∏–¥–µ–æ)","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/drugi/multimedia/video/bodigardyt-na-mesi-otnovo-v-dejstvie-video-752034","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"...","content":"–ê—Ä–∂–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä–∑–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ –õ–∏–æ–Ω–µ–ª –ú–µ—Å–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–∞–≤–∞ –¥–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏ —Ñ—É—Ä–æ—Ä –≤ –°–ê–©. –ü—Ä–µ–¥–∏ —á–∞—Å–æ–≤–µ –Ω–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏—è—Ç –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä –ú–∞—è–º–∏ —É—Å–ø—è –¥–∞ –Ω–∞–¥–≤–∏–µ –Ω–æ–≤–∏—è —Ç–∏–º –Ω–∞ –§–∏–ª–∏–ø –ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç–µ–≤ –õ–æ—Å –ê–Ω–¥–∂–µ–ª–∏—Å –§–ö —Å 3:1 –≤ –º–∞—á –æ—Ç –ú–õ–°. –ú–µ—Å–∏ —Å–µ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∏ —Å –¥–≤–µ –∞—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ –≤ –¥–≤—É–±–æ—è. –û–∫–æ–ª–æ –∞—Ä–∂–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–µ–Ω—Ü–∞ –Ω–∞—à—É–º—è –∏ –±–æ–¥–∏–≥–∞—Ä–¥—ä—Ç –º—É, –∫–æ–π—Ç–æ –ø–∞–∑–∏ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤–Ω–∏—è —à–∞–º–ø–∏–æ–Ω –Ω–µ —Å–∞–º–æ –∏–∑–≤—ä–Ω —Ç–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ, –Ω–æ –∏ –ø–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –Ω–∞ –º–∞—á–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ. –í –µ–¥–Ω–∞ –æ—Ç —Å—Ä–µ—â–∏—Ç–µ —Ç–æ–π –±–µ —É–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω –∫–∞–∫ —Ç–∏—á–∞ –∫—Ä–∞–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥–∏ –∑–∞ –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–µ—Å–∏. –í –º–∞—á–∞ —Å—Ä–µ—â—É –õ–æ—Å –ê–Ω–¥–∂–µ–ª–∏—Å –§–ö –ø—ä–∫ –±–æ–¥–∏–≥–∞—Ä–¥—ä—Ç —Å–µ –Ω–∞–º–µ—Å–∏ –ø–æ-–±—ä—Ä–∑–æ –æ—Ç —Å—Ç—é–∞—Ä–¥–∏—Ç–µ, –∫–æ–≥–∞—Ç–æ —Ñ–µ–Ω –Ω–∞—Ö–ª—É –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–æ–Ω–∞, –∑–∞ –¥–∞ —Å—Ç–∏–≥–Ω–µ –¥–æ –õ–∏–æ–Ω–µ–ª –ú–µ—Å–∏. –ú—ä–∂—ä—Ç —Å–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏ –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ —Å—ä—Å –∑–∞–ø–∞–ª—è–Ω–∫–æ—Ç–æ, —Å–ª–µ–¥ –∫–æ–µ—Ç–æ –≥–æ \"–ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞–¥–µ\" –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—é–∞—Ä–¥–∏—Ç–µ.

As part of the campaign, this week sees the Citizens' prolific forward sit down with KickOff and share some of how it felt to make his debut along with Rhodes' views on his \"sexy\" style and how he deals with disappointment. I knew from my time at Hellenic because me and Mark Byrne were very close and he made it clear to me that I had the potential to make it to the top. He made me make sacrifices like moving me out of Atlantis away from my family, put me in a school so I knew that at some point I had to make it. I can't go through all this stuff and not reach the finish line. Just two years ago, I was sitting in the stand watching Cape Town City and Ajax Cape Town play against each other and here I am the field. It was a big achievement. Neymar, he is creative and stylish. I am that kind of player. In this world, it is you versus you. If you don't go out there and get it, no one is going to do it for you. I prefer a bit of both. It depends on the occasion, I like to mix it up sometimes a nice oversized t-shirt with jeans. Keagan Buchanan. Keagan Buchanan, if you go to his Instagram. The tattoos, the jewellery he has on, everything is stylish. The stuff that goes on social media can affect your mind and thinking, So it is not good for you but its not all bad. I am a person that loves to ignore negative comments, i don't still bother by replying or reading that stuff. It depends on my mood so maybe i will go the mall but I love going to the beach where I kick the ball around. The sport I love besides soccer is tennis. I grew up watching tennis and my favourite player is Rafael Nadal. I'm not bad at playing tennis, I can play but I won't say I am good at it. If it wasn't for soccer I don't know where I would be. Growing up, it was something else. I went on wrong route. Soccer saved my life. Another career i would consider is being a model. Giveon, Meek Mill and Nipsey Hussle. Before I go onto the pitch, I listen to Stay from Rihanna and after that I will listen to Meek Mill to get me hyped up. Sometimes it is tough to deal with it but you can't be too hard on yourself. You may feel disappointment but there is always a next game to improve and a next training session to improve. If you want to go get something, never stop never settle keep going. That football can change very quickly. it can take you up but it can take you down as well. Someone who is experienced told me this. Sexy Piano, this is the instrument I always wanted to play. I just love the way it sounds.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:36:50","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8931/2c01d7b2e6b6489c885e371bd6f8b01e.jpg","source_id":"snl24","source_priority":103202,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"863a6c16186ab00a2b6713da74fec8cb","title":"OL : la nouvelle annonce pol√©mique de Blanc sur son avenir, Cucci y va aussi de sa sortie !","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/ol/actualite/ol-psg-laurent-blanc-a-vecu-un-cauchemar-son-president-entretient-le-flou-sur-la-suite-832009","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Alors que son avenir √† l'OL semble tr√®s compromis, Laurent Blanc n'a pas eu droit √† un soutien tr√®s franc de son pr√©sident √† l'issue de la d√©route face au PSG (1-4).

Lourdement battu par le PSG (1-4), le C√©v√©nol a reconnu avoir v√©cu ¬´ un cauchemar ¬ª durant ¬´ tout le match ¬ª : ¬´ Dans l'analyse, tout le monde a sa part de responsabilit√©. Si l'objectif est de se qualifier en Ligue des champions, comme vous le dites, on a vraiment beaucoup de travail. On a des probl√®mes, il va falloir les r√©gler ¬ª. ¬´ Je ne suis pas dans une meilleure situation qu‚Äôavant ¬ª Alpagu√© par les Bad Gones qui ont d√©ploy√© un cinglant message √† son endroit (¬´ Blanc, si tu n'as plus les couilles de te battre, d√©missionne ¬ª), Laurent Blanc - qui avait √©chang√© avec son pr√©sident d√©l√©gu√© Santiago Cucci juste avant dans le vestiaire - n‚Äôa pas voulu r√©pondre en conf√©rence de presse d‚Äôapr√®s-match : ¬´ Je ne vais pas parler de √ßa parce que je vais √™tre un peu cru. Les supporters ont raison d'√™tre d√©√ßus. Est-ce que je suis menac√© ? Quand un entra√Æneur n'a pas de r√©sultat, il est en danger. Donc ce soir apr√®s ce match, je ne suis pas dans une meilleure situation qu'avant. ¬ª Au micro d‚ÄôAmazon Prime Vid√©o, l‚Äôancien coach du PSG a √©galement √©t√© interrog√© sur son avenir. ¬´ La question ne s‚Äôest pas pas pos√©e. J‚Äôessaierais d‚Äô√™tre l√† dans 15 jours ¬ª, a-t-il r√©pondu avec le sourire aux l√®vres. Une sortie et une attitude qui ne manquent pas de faire pol√©mique. Cucci veut un ¬´ entra√Æneur qui entra√Æne ¬ª Ce n‚Äôest d‚Äôailleurs pas les propos de Santiago Cucci face √† la presse en parall√®le de son passage en conf√©rence de presse qui sont de nature √† rassurer sur son cas : ¬´ Laurent Blanc ? Ce n'est pas le sujet. Je ne vais pas vous r√©pondre tout de suite. Il faut un entra√Æneur qui entra√Æne. ¬ª Relanc√© sur le fait que cette phrase ressemblait √† une pique √† Laurent Blanc, l‚Äôancien PDG de Levi‚Äôs Europe a d√©menti : ¬´ Je ne suis pas en train de vous dire √ßa. Il n'y a pas que lui qui est responsable, ce n'est pas lui qui joue au foot ¬ª. La quinzaine risque d‚Äô√™tre anim√©e √† Lyon‚Ä¶ Et si Botafogo a refus√© la d√©mission de Bruno Lage (et donc son arriv√©e anticip√©e dans la Capitale des Gaules !), rien ne dit que l‚ÄôOL ne cherchera pas quelqu‚Äôun d‚Äôautre pour relancer les Gones, d√©sormais derniers de Ligue 1.

It comes after the Manchester United winger hit out at the Dutchman following claims he dropped Sancho due to the manner of his performances in training. Sancho failed to make the bench as his United team-mates slumped to a 3-1 defeat against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Ten Hag said following the clash: \"Jadon, on his performances in training we did not select him. \"You have to reach a level every day at Manchester United and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\" It prompted the England international to respond on social media as he issued a statement defending his performances at Carrington - declaring there were exterior motives behind his omission. Now Arsenal fan Morgan has stirred the pot, tweeting : \"Hi Jadon, come on @PiersUncensored and I‚Äôll get you out of this Ten Hag nightmare.\" It's safe to say it's unlikely Sancho will be taking Morgan up on his offer, like Cristiano Ronaldo did last year, as he awaits his potential fate at Carrington on Monday. The 23-year-old said on his social media channels: \"Please don't believe everything you read. \"I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself very well in training this week. \"I believe there are other reasons for this matter that I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair!\" Sancho, who has featured in all three of United's other Premier League matches, added: \"All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to my team. \"I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and am grateful to do so, which I know every week is a challenge. \"I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what.\" Last year, Sancho was exiled from the United first-team picture and was sent to Holland during the World Cup to work on his performance and fitness levels with a private coach. He was later reintegrated into the United setup and was back with a bang as he inspired a fightback against Leeds from the bench at Old Trafford in February. However, he has since struggled to nail down a starting berth despite United's struggles in attack and now Sancho is facing yet another obstacle as he bids to turn his Old Trafford career around. Sancho has not been part of an England squad since way back in October 2021 when he provided two assists in a 5-0 win over Andorra.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"express","source_priority":1139,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0025080afcbe7d976e84918591f0d2fe","title":"Arsenal recreate the Battle of Old Trafford with pizzas all round in Man Utd victory","link":"https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1808963/Arsenal-Battle-of-Old-Trafford-Man-Utd","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"COMMENT: Arsenal celebrated their victory over Man Utd in style","content":"It was as if Martin Keown was bouncing in the face of Ruud van Nistelrooy all over again. The late drama of 2003‚Äôs Battle of Old Trafford was being repeated here at the Emirates as Arsenal snatched victory from what looked like a last-gasp defeat. And boy did the Gunners celebrate it. Pizzas all round, no doubt! As the emotions ebbed away with the fans into the unseasonably warm London evening, cold reason could only conclude it was a win that Arsenal had deserved. They had dominated most of the match and some better, more incisive finishing in front of goal might have given them the win before all the late drama. Any sort of drama would have been welcome in a fairly drab first half save for a couple of minutes which served up goals at either end. Kai Havertz had already fluffed an appalling left-foot shot with the goal at his mercy in the 13th minute, then gave the ball away cheaply in the 27th. Christian Eriksen‚Äôs pass was as immaculate as ever and Marcus Rashford was on it straight away, his shot was too strong to be pushed away by the fingertips of Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal responded to going behind against the run of play instantly, though when Martin Odegaard hammered in a drive from the edge of the area. That was pretty much it until an incident on the hour-mark that would be a prelude to all the drama. When Havertz went to the floor under challenge from Aaron Wan-Bissake, referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot. It looked clumsy, but every replay seemed to show less and less contact, until eventually Australian VAR Jarred Gillett, still establishing himself in this country, made the brave call to suggest arguably the country‚Äôs leading official had possibly made a mistake. (It‚Äôs supposed to take out the human element, right?) The important thing was that Taylor agreed after looking at the monitor and it looked as though United were going to hold on for a point they ill-deserved. Rasmus Winther Hojlund finally came on for his debut and looked abrasive and bristling, but was fighting a lone battle with no real understanding with the players around him. At the other end, United were to end the game with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans. The first game after the window had shut, nothing about it was saying title challengers. Yet Erik Ten Hag and his player thought they had nicked all three of the points. Substitute Alejandro Garnacho ran clear on a counter-attack in the 87th minute and coolly slid the ball past Ramsdale as the away fans went wild. VAR had not finished for the evening, though - and after an agonising couple of minutes decided the Argentina international had started marginally offside. That was just the start of it. Eight minutes of additional time were indicated and in the sixth of these Declan Rice bundled the ball home and a slight deflection off Evans was no more than he deserved for another commanding midfield performance. The Emirates went mad. Assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg was booked for going a bit too wild, but as with Keown all those years ago when Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a last-minute penalty to leave the game goalless, there was a lot of emotion sitting behind that dam. These days, though, we have added time to the added time and United sense there was still time for one last twist. Instead, it was Gabriel Jesus who sprinted from the half-way line, left Diago Dalot on his backside and swept the ball into the empty corner of the net. The scoreline certainly could have been very different, but ultimately the worry for Ten Hag is it was probably a fair reflection of the relative balance between these two auld enemies at the moment.","pubDate":"2023-09-04 06:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"express","source_priority":1139,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"65cfdc8d62c2d085bb0da49a52e94a8c","title":"ASSE : Batlles prend une premi√®re d√©cision radicale √† la tr√™ve","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/asse/actualite/asse-batlles-prend-une-premiere-decision-radicale-a-la-treve-832024","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tr√®s d√©√ßu et frustr√© par le nouveau match nul de l‚ÄôAS Saint-√âtienne contre le Valenciennes FC samedi lors de la 5e journ√©e de Ligue 2 (1-1), Laurent Batlles a pris une d√©cision radicale √† la tr√™ve.","content":"L‚ÄôASSE n‚Äôavance pas.

The Reds beat Aston Villa to make it three wins and a draw in their opening four games of the new campaign, easing to a 3-0 victory at Anfield. The season opened with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea before a victory over Bournemouth at Anfield. Liverpool then travelled to St James' Park, seeing Virgil van Dijk sent off and falling behind to a Anthony Gordon goal. Darwin Nunez came off the bench to score twice late on to win the game for Liverpool. However, injury problems are starting to add up for Jurgen Klopp, with Trent Alexander-Arnold substituted with a hamstring concern against Villa. Even just a few weeks into the new season the Reds have a number of injuries to contend with. But Klopp will hope to have some players back fit after the international break, below is the latest Liverpool injury news: Trent Alexander-Arnold took a knock in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa, limping off and straight down the tunnel with just under 20 minutes to play. Jurgen Klopp admitted afterwards that it was a hamstring problem and that the Scouse full-back would need a scan to discover the extent of any damage. Speaking on the injury, Klopp said: \"I asked him and he said it‚Äôs (his) hamstring. Not too serious is his opinion, but we obviously have to wait for the scans. Then we will know more.\" French defender Ibrahima Konate missed the wins over Newcastle and Aston Villa with Jurgen Klopp hopeful he'd be fit for Wolves after the international break. But with France initially selecting the centre-back for their squad to face Ireland and Germany, before swapping for Jean-Clair Tobido, it has raised fears that the injury is worse than first thought. The hamstring problem wasn't believed to be too serious, but Liverpool will be hoping he's back fit for Wolves. T was close to a long awaited return to action before suffering a setback in training and remaining sidelined. Jurgen Klopp confirmed that, like Curtis Jones, the Spaniard would be back in training after Newcastle, but the Spaniard would return too quickly and will now try to get back to fill fitness during the international break. \"Thiago had a little setback. He started training with the team and had a little setback so we have to slow down there a little bit,\" Klopp said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not cool for him, it‚Äôs not cool for us but it‚Äôs how it is. Thiago will use the (September) international break for that, to be up to speed I‚Äôm pretty sure. It should hopefully be enough. All the rest are available.‚Äù The young full-back showed potential with pre-season performances in Germany, playing 90 minutes over the course of two fixtures. He was then left out of the group that travelled to Singapore following a minor, unspecified injury and has not featured in any matchday squads since the start of the season, though has been involved in training since his team-mates returned to England. Once fit the Northern Irishman is expected to slot into Klopp's plans as understudy to Alexander-Arnold, having proven himself in League One with Bolton Wanderers last year.
