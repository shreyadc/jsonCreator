The bid “intends to deliver a world-class tournament and will draw inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s ongoing social and economic transformation and the country’s deep-rooted passion for football”, said a statement from the Saudi Arabian football federation. News of the bid comes one year after neighbouring Qatar hosted the first World Cup in the Middle East, where the Saudi national team scored a stunning group stage victory over eventual winners Argentina. The Saudi announcement came an hour after world football’s governing body FIFA released a statement giving its plans for the 2030 World Cup and inviting countries in the Asian Football Confederation to bid for 2034. On the heels of the Qatar tournament, Saudi Arabia signed Cristiano Ronaldo to play in the Saudi Pro League, the first in a slew of major stars drawn by eye-watering salaries to the world’s biggest crude oil exporter. Sport is a major component of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to transform Saudi Arabia into a tourism and business hub while transitioning the economy away from fossil fuels. – Spending spree – In the coming weeks, the kingdom is set to host the final LIV Golf League tournament of the regular season, a boxing match featuring Anthony Joshua and the Next Gen ATP Finals tennis tournament. It will also host the FIFA Club World Cup in December. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia was confirmed as host of football’s 2027 Asian Cup. That event will enable Saudi officials to improve on existing football infrastructure, with new “world-class stadiums” constructed “in the most sustainable ways”, Saudi Football Federation President, Yasser Al Misehal, said on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia previously explored a tri-continental World Cup bid with Egypt and Greece, though that plan has been shelved. The new Saudi-only bid means fans would face “maximum three-hour flying times between cities and stadiums”, Misehal said.

In an interview with Fox News last month, Prince Mohammed dismissed those attacks, saying “I will continue doing sportswashing” if it will benefit the Saudi economy. – Prince in spotlight – Hosting the World Cup would ratchet up scrutiny of the 38-year-old de facto ruler, who critics accuse of consolidating power through a fierce crackdown on dissent, including one recent case in which a retired teacher was sentenced to death for critical social media posts. Prince Mohammed told Fox he was “ashamed” of that verdict. World Cup-related construction could also draw a backlash from environmental activists who sounded the alarm last year after Saudi Arabia was awarded hosting rights for the 2029 Asian Winter Games, a 47-event competition to be held in Trojena, an area of the planned $500 billion futuristic megacity known as NEOM. At the time, Greenpeace questioned how plans for Trojena – including a man-made freshwater lake, chalets, mansions and ultra-luxury hotels – could possibly be sustainable. But Riyadh would be keen to use the World Cup as a showcase for various natural attractions, dispelling the notion that Saudi Arabia is one giant desert. But Misehal said on Wednesday that fans would be drawn to “our mountains, our islands and of course our culture”, adding: “Everything will be connected with state-of-the-art facilities to guarantee an amazing fan experience.” The Asian Football Confederation came out in support of the Saudi 2034 World Cup bid shortly after it was announced on Wednesday. “I am delighted to note that the (Saudi football federation) have presented their intention to bid for the FIFA World Cup in 2034,” said AFC President Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa. “The entire Asian football family will stand united in support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s momentous initiative, and we are committed to working closely with the global football family to ensure its success.” AFP","pubDate":"2023-10-04 19:03:40","image_url":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/04080630/World-Cup.jpg","source_id":"punchng","source_priority":19103,"country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cf76f0173a19c03c9786d5d28a8d3c34","title":"Osimhen Will Renew Napoli’s Contract — De Laurentiis","link":"https://www.completesports.com/osimhen-will-renew-napolis-contract-de-laurentiis/","keywords":["Nigerian Footballers Abroad","Série A News"],"creator":["Austin Akhilomen"],"video_url":null,"description":"Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis has assured the Naple fans that Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen will renew his contract with the club.

Hyderabad had recorded some impressive wins in the club friendlies ahead of the ISL 2023 campaign. They claimed a 6-0 win against Kidderpore before smashing eight goals past Neroca in club-friendlies. Their ISL campaign, however, tells a different story. Hyderabad recently conceded a 2-1 defeat to East Bengal in their ISL opening game. In that match, Hyderabad had taken an early lead after Jitesh Sharma scored in the eighth minute but they conceded a goal just a couple of minutes later. Cleiton Silva added a second in the dying stages of the game to wrap up a victory for the Kolkata giants.

Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been chosen as the sole candidate to host the World Cup. However in order to celebrate one of the biggest tournament’s 100th anniversary, centenary celebration and celebratory games will take place in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. The first of these three matches which will be played in South America will be played at the stadium where it all began, in Montevideo’s Estadio Centenario. With this, all six nations – Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have directly qualified for the tournament. “The FIFA Council unanimously agreed that the sole candidacy will be the combined bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, which will host the event in 2030 and qualify automatically from the existing slot allocation subject to the completion of a successful bidding process conducted by FIFA and a decision by the FIFA Congress in 2024,” as quoted from a statement by FIFA. FIFA President Gianni Infantino talked about how football will be uniting different pasts of the world and said as quoted from the official website of FIFA, “In a divided world, FIFA and football are uniting. The FIFA Council, representing the entire world of football, unanimously agreed to celebrate the centenary of the FIFA World Cup, whose first edition was played in Uruguay in 1930, in the most appropriate way. As a result, a celebration will take place in South America and three South American countries – Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay – will organise one match each of the FIFA World Cup 2030. The first of these three matches will of course be played at the stadium where it all began, in Montevideo’s mythical Estadio Centenario, precisely to celebrate the centenary edition of the FIFA World Cup.” “In 2030, we will have a unique global footprint, three continents — Africa, Europe and South America — six countries — Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and Uruguay — welcoming and uniting the world while celebrating together the beautiful game, the centenary and the FIFA World Cup,” Infantino added.","pubDate":"2023-10-04 18:31:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsmill","source_priority":3781717,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5ed19925d7c5e96c8036c28e8fae5b9c","title":"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp admits his call for Tottenham replay is unlikely","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23834733.liverpool-boss-jurgen-klopp-admits-call-tottenham-replay-unlikely/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With the score at 0-0, Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was flagged offside but replays showed he was actually onside, which VAR failed to correct.","content":"With the score at 0-0, Diaz was flagged offside but replays showed he was actually onside although Darren England, the VAR, mistakenly believed the on-field decision had been to award the goal, leading him to tell referee Simon Hooper the check was complete. Liverpool’s complaints promoted the publication of the audio between officials which revealed the first person to spot the mistake was the replay operator, who urged the team of officials to stop the game, but the VAR and assistant VAR repeatedly said they could not intervene because play had restarted. Klopp felt such an unprecedented scenario required a similarly unprecedented solution. “The audio didn’t change it at all because I was not really interested in why things happened because I knew,” he said. “I saw the outcome, I saw goal we scored and it didn’t count so I wasn’t now waiting for the audio and sitting there hoping I’d find out how it could happen or whatever. “Yes, it was an obvious mistake and I think there would have been solutions for it afterwards. “If not, I can say immediately – and probably some people don’t want me to say it – not as the manager of Liverpool but, much more as a football person, I think the only outcome should be a replay. It probably will not happen. “The argument against that will probably be if you open that gate then everybody will ask for it. I think the situation is that unprecedented – it didn’t happen before. “I’m 56 years old and I’m absolutely used to wrong decisions, difficult decisions but something like that as far as I can remember has never happened. That’s why I think the replay would be the right thing. “The next argument would be if it would happen again, I think a replay would be the right thing to do or the referee has the opportunity to bring both coaches together and say ‘sorry, we made a mistake, but we can sort it, that Liverpool score a goal and we start from there’.” PGMOL can confirm that we have carried out a review into the circumstances which led to the Luis Diaz goal being incorrectly disallowed for offside in the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur FC and Liverpool FC. Full statement and the audio between the on-field team… — PGMOL (@FA_PGMOL) Asked whether the club had made – or would make – a formal request for the match to be replayed Klopp, after taking advice from his press officer, said: “We are still going through the information that we have.” The PA news agency understands the Premier League’s stance remains the same as earlier in the week – that a replay would not be considered. The manager stressed he did not want to single out the individuals involved for the errors made, but wanted to find a solution within the framework of the system which would prevent something similar recurring in futrure. “What I want to say is it’s really important that as big as football is, and important as it is for us, that we really deal with it in a proper way,” he added. “I mean that all the people involved – on-field ref, linesman, fourth official and especially now in this case VAR – they didn’t do that on purpose. We shouldn’t forget that. “I’m not angry with any of them (the officials), not at all. It’s not only the respect, but the only thing for human beings in general is we should not go for them. It’s not allowed to go for them in any way. “They made a mistake and they felt horrible that night, I’m 100 per cent sure. That’s enough for me. Nobody needs further punishment. We should discuss it on a completely normal basis without emotions.” Klopp was still unhappy with some other decisions taken in the game, notably the upgrading of Curtis Jones’ yellow card to a red, and also the two yellow cards issued to Diogo Jota. “The referee got called to the screen and saw for the first three seconds a frozen picture. I would have given immediately a red card for that picture. Then he sees the replay in slow motion and I’d have given a red card for the slow motion. But in reality it’s not a red card. “The ref’s first decision is yellow. Then the clear and obvious mistake is showing a frozen picture and in slow motion. “On top of that, Diogo Jota got two yellow cards for not touching a player once. That is unprecedented as well I would say.” Jota will be available for Thursday’s Europa League visit of Belgian side Union Saint Gilloise but fellow forward Cody Gakpo, who was injured in the Spurs game, is out.

It must have been around his 60 th birthday when my mum bought him a new one, and it was clear it hadn’t gone down all that well. Pressed for an explanation, he pointed out that the cardy only had one pocket, whereas he required two – ‘one for my fags, and one for my inhaler.’ I’ll be surprised if there’s a crossover with the tailoring options of the Man City version, but thought I’d share anyway!” Tremendous. 6m ago 14.53 EDT Looking at the Celtic team, they’ve got the players to hurt Lazio .

Lazio and Celtic have one and none respectively. 13m ago 14.45 EDT Just the five goals for Haaland last time City played Leipzig. 18m ago 14.40 EDT Email! “Aside from Erling Haaland looking like he could play a particularly dangerous Targaryen in House of The Dragon,” says Nick Smith, “I can’t be the only one to think Paddy Considine could play Scott Carson in the inevitable movie of his life? Anyone? I’ll get my cardigan…” I’d love to see his interpretation of the Bursaspor period. Photograph: Lexy Ilsley/Manchester City FC/Getty Images Updated at 14.48 EDT 25m ago 14.33 EDT Eddie Howe has picked the team you expect him to. I guess Jacob Murphy might be disappointed to miss out, but Miguel Almiron has been in good nick recently, so. Paris, meanwhile, are playing a 4-4-2 – I think – with Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe flanking Manuel Ugarte and Warren Zaire-Emery in midfield, behind Goncalo Ramos and Randal Kolo Muani. It might, though, also be a 4-4-2 diamond – we shall see. 30m ago 14.29 EDT In Antwerp, Shakhtar now lead 3-2; Atleti sare still 3-2 in front at home to Feyenoord. 31m ago 14.27 EDT Leipzig, meanwhile, will play 4-2-2-2, one of my least favourite formations. But they’ve been playing it pretty well so far this season, and Emil Forsberg is a player who might give City trouble. 33m ago 14.26 EDT We’ll stick with City to look who starts for them and, at the back, Josko Gvardiol replaces Nathan Ake. In midfield, it’s Rico Lewis and Rodri, not Matteo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes while, behind Haaland, Grealish and Bernardo replace Alvarez and Doku. City appear to have some strength in depth. 37m ago 14.22 EDT So yes, this – but with CARSON 33 on the back.

I never thought I’d say this, but we’ll miss these group stages when they’re gone and tonight’s fixtures are part of the reason why. I will, of course, be providing updates on Newcastle v PSG – a game you can follow in MBM form here – but there’s a surfeit of other behaviour to enjoy, so let’s get on with that, beginning with the other fixture in that group, Borussia Dortmund v AC Milan. The German unchampions competed well enough losing in Paris the other week, though looked worryingly impotent, while Milan will still be smarting they failed to beat the Geordies; in what looks like being a tight group, home wins are essential. In Group E, Lazio – who drew 1-1 at home to Atlético in “gameweek 1” visit Parkhead with Celtic , beaten 2-0 in Rotterdam, in desperate need a result. Meantime, Atléti and Feyernoord are 2-2 with 50 or so minutes gone. Group G serves us winners v winners and losers v losers, holders Manchester City travelling to face Leipzig with Crvena zvezda taking on Young Boys, while in Group H, two more victors from the first round of games meet with Porto entertaining Barcelona; the meeting between the losers sees Antwerp leading Shakhtar 2-1. As Burna Boy sings, it’s plenty. It’s just a shame Uefa – and the clubs – aren’t listening.

He added that it’s “mad” that some of the Blues fans have overlooked the red flags surrounding the US investment firm, but he believes they are just desperate to see the back of the current ownership on Merseyside. “Do Everton really need to be in a network?” asked Critchley. “If there’s a club at the minute that needs the full and undivided attention of whoever is in charge there, it’s Everton. “They’ve got all these debts, they’ve got to finish the stadium, they’ve got to keep their head above water. It demands that kind of engagement and that kind of attention that only really some owners that are absolutely dedicated and committed can give to it. “It’s mad at the same time how despite all these red flags and all the scare stories, a lot of fans are still willing to give them a go because they are just desperate. It just speaks to the air of desperation.” There have been an awful lot of red flags surrounding 777 and the Everton fans should really be cautious about who they are letting take over their historic club. In the latest concerning development to come out about the group, The Guardian on Monday (2 October) that it had missed three transfer payments worth £4.5million at Vasco de Gama, one of the other clubs it owns. That has led to the Brazilian side being hit with a transfer ban by FIFA after the unpaid payments were recently reported to the governing body. It’s understandable that the Blues fans want to see an end to Farhad Moshiri’s time at the club, but there is nothing to suggest that the US company can take them forward. Although there will be plenty of due diligence done over the next couple of months to ensure it is the best party to take over at Goodison, there are huge question marks around the firm at this moment in time.","pubDate":"2023-10-04 17:40:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/09/Resizing-template-2023-09-13T144329.031-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6e846e1c1eae648cb0c62e9414a566b0","title":"ISL 2023-24: Javi Hernandez Scores Wonder Goal to Inspire Bengaluru FC to 2-1 Win Over East Bengal","link":"https://www.news18.com/football/isl-2023-24-javi-hernandez-scores-wonder-goal-to-inspire-bengaluru-fc-to-2-1-win-over-east-bengal-8603338.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Javi Hernandez scored the winner for Bengaluru after Sunil Chhetri cancelled out the early strike from Naorem Mahesh Singh, Blue pick up first win this season","content":"Bengaluru FC wrapped up an intriguing battle against their former head coach Carles Cuadrat’s East Bengal FC with a 2-1 win at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium tonight. The Blues were put behind in the contest by Naorem Mahesh Singh, who struck a goal in the 15th minute. However, Chhetri converted a kick from the spot in the 21st minute before Javi Hernandez secured the winner with an acrobatic bicycle kick in the second half to seal the first victory of the season for Simon Grayson’s men. Nanda Kumar carved open the Bengaluru backline with an impressive through ball that was gathered well by Mahesh 15 minutes into the game. Mahesh’s first touch and footwork helped him get past the home team’s centre-back pairing of Parag Srivas and Slavko Damjanovic. He then had only goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to get past and the attacker made light work of the same much to Cuadrat’s happiness. However, the wave of optimism was short lived as Mandar Rao Dessai brought down Chhetri inside the 18-yard box to hand a spot-kick to the home team merely four minutes later. The 39-year-old was flawless as ever as he deposited the ball to the bottom right corner to draw the scores level at a crucial juncture in the first half.

The duo of Mahesh and Nanda combined again in the second half to give their team a potential winning strike. Mahesh shifted wide and curled in a pass that eased past Bengaluru’s defensive line to land at Nanda’s feet on the left flank. However, the winger couldn’t keep his shot on target and ended up hitting way above the crossbar to blow away a well-crafted opportunity. Eventually, Javi Hernandez pulled off an absolute entertainer to delight the home crowd and bag three points for his team in the 72nd minute. Young forward Rohit Danu frenetically managed to get the ball to the attacking midfielder through a headed pass. Hernandez chipped it up and then bicycle kicked it into the back of the net to sum up a move fitting of his delightful creativity and goal-scoring prowess.

The bid “intends to deliver a world-class tournament and will draw inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s ongoing social and economic transformation and the country’s deep-rooted passion for football”, said a statement from the Saudi Arabian football federation. News of the bid comes one year after neighbouring Qatar hosted the first World Cup in the Middle East, where the Saudi national team scored a stunning group stage victory over eventual winners Argentina. The Saudi announcement came an hour after world football’s governing body FIFA released a statement giving its plans for the 2030 World Cup and inviting countries in the Asian Football Confederation to bid for 2034. On the heels of the Qatar tournament, Saudi Arabia signed Cristiano Ronaldo to play in the Saudi Pro League, the first in a slew of major stars drawn by eye-watering salaries to the world’s biggest crude oil exporter. Sport is a major component of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to transform Saudi Arabia into a tourism and business hub while transitioning the economy away from fossil fuels. – Spending spree – In the coming weeks, the kingdom is set to host the final LIV Golf League tournament of the regular season, a boxing match featuring Anthony Joshua and the Next Gen ATP Finals tennis tournament. It will also host the FIFA Club World Cup in December. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia was confirmed as host of football’s 2027 Asian Cup. That event will enable Saudi officials to improve on existing football infrastructure, with new “world-class stadiums” constructed “in the most sustainable ways”, Saudi Football Federation President, Yasser Al Misehal, said on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia previously explored a tri-continental World Cup bid with Egypt and Greece, though that plan has been shelved. The new Saudi-only bid means fans would face “maximum three-hour flying times between cities and stadiums”, Misehal said.

In an interview with Fox News last month, Prince Mohammed dismissed those attacks, saying “I will continue doing sportswashing” if it will benefit the Saudi economy. – Prince in spotlight – Hosting the World Cup would ratchet up scrutiny of the 38-year-old de facto ruler, who critics accuse of consolidating power through a fierce crackdown on dissent, including one recent case in which a retired teacher was sentenced to death for critical social media posts. Prince Mohammed told Fox he was “ashamed” of that verdict. World Cup-related construction could also draw a backlash from environmental activists who sounded the alarm last year after Saudi Arabia was awarded hosting rights for the 2029 Asian Winter Games, a 47-event competition to be held in Trojena, an area of the planned $500 billion futuristic megacity known as NEOM. At the time, Greenpeace questioned how plans for Trojena – including a man-made freshwater lake, chalets, mansions and ultra-luxury hotels – could possibly be sustainable. But Riyadh would be keen to use the World Cup as a showcase for various natural attractions, dispelling the notion that Saudi Arabia is one giant desert. But Misehal said on Wednesday that fans would be drawn to “our mountains, our islands and of course our culture”, adding: “Everything will be connected with state-of-the-art facilities to guarantee an amazing fan experience.” The Asian Football Confederation came out in support of the Saudi 2034 World Cup bid shortly after it was announced on Wednesday. “I am delighted to note that the (Saudi football federation) have presented their intention to bid for the FIFA World Cup in 2034,” said AFC President Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa. “The entire Asian football family will stand united in support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s momentous initiative, and we are committed to working closely with the global football family to ensure its success.” AFP","pubDate":"2023-10-04 19:03:40","image_url":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/04080630/World-Cup.jpg","source_id":"punchng","source_priority":19103,"country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cf76f0173a19c03c9786d5d28a8d3c34","title":"Osimhen Will Renew Napoli’s Contract — De Laurentiis","link":"https://www.completesports.com/osimhen-will-renew-napolis-contract-de-laurentiis/","keywords":["Nigerian Footballers Abroad","Série A News"],"creator":["Austin Akhilomen"],"video_url":null,"description":"Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis has assured the Naple fans that Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen will renew his contract with the club.

Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been chosen as the sole candidate to host the World Cup. However in order to celebrate one of the biggest tournament’s 100th anniversary, centenary celebration and celebratory games will take place in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. The first of these three matches which will be played in South America will be played at the stadium where it all began, in Montevideo’s Estadio Centenario. With this, all six nations – Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have directly qualified for the tournament. “The FIFA Council unanimously agreed that the sole candidacy will be the combined bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, which will host the event in 2030 and qualify automatically from the existing slot allocation subject to the completion of a successful bidding process conducted by FIFA and a decision by the FIFA Congress in 2024,” as quoted from a statement by FIFA. FIFA President Gianni Infantino talked about how football will be uniting different pasts of the world and said as quoted from the official website of FIFA, “In a divided world, FIFA and football are uniting. The FIFA Council, representing the entire world of football, unanimously agreed to celebrate the centenary of the FIFA World Cup, whose first edition was played in Uruguay in 1930, in the most appropriate way. As a result, a celebration will take place in South America and three South American countries – Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay – will organise one match each of the FIFA World Cup 2030. The first of these three matches will of course be played at the stadium where it all began, in Montevideo’s mythical Estadio Centenario, precisely to celebrate the centenary edition of the FIFA World Cup.” “In 2030, we will have a unique global footprint, three continents — Africa, Europe and South America — six countries — Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and Uruguay — welcoming and uniting the world while celebrating together the beautiful game, the centenary and the FIFA World Cup,” Infantino added.","pubDate":"2023-10-04 18:31:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsmill","source_priority":3781717,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5ed19925d7c5e96c8036c28e8fae5b9c","title":"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp admits his call for Tottenham replay is unlikely","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23834733.liverpool-boss-jurgen-klopp-admits-call-tottenham-replay-unlikely/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With the score at 0-0, Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was flagged offside but replays showed he was actually onside, which VAR failed to correct.","content":"With the score at 0-0, Diaz was flagged offside but replays showed he was actually onside although Darren England, the VAR, mistakenly believed the on-field decision had been to award the goal, leading him to tell referee Simon Hooper the check was complete. Liverpool’s complaints promoted the publication of the audio between officials which revealed the first person to spot the mistake was the replay operator, who urged the team of officials to stop the game, but the VAR and assistant VAR repeatedly said they could not intervene because play had restarted. Klopp felt such an unprecedented scenario required a similarly unprecedented solution. “The audio didn’t change it at all because I was not really interested in why things happened because I knew,” he said. “I saw the outcome, I saw goal we scored and it didn’t count so I wasn’t now waiting for the audio and sitting there hoping I’d find out how it could happen or whatever. “Yes, it was an obvious mistake and I think there would have been solutions for it afterwards. “If not, I can say immediately – and probably some people don’t want me to say it – not as the manager of Liverpool but, much more as a football person, I think the only outcome should be a replay. It probably will not happen. “The argument against that will probably be if you open that gate then everybody will ask for it. I think the situation is that unprecedented – it didn’t happen before. “I’m 56 years old and I’m absolutely used to wrong decisions, difficult decisions but something like that as far as I can remember has never happened. That’s why I think the replay would be the right thing. “The next argument would be if it would happen again, I think a replay would be the right thing to do or the referee has the opportunity to bring both coaches together and say ‘sorry, we made a mistake, but we can sort it, that Liverpool score a goal and we start from there’.” PGMOL can confirm that we have carried out a review into the circumstances which led to the Luis Diaz goal being incorrectly disallowed for offside in the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur FC and Liverpool FC. Full statement and the audio between the on-field team… — PGMOL (@FA_PGMOL) Asked whether the club had made – or would make – a formal request for the match to be replayed Klopp, after taking advice from his press officer, said: “We are still going through the information that we have.” The PA news agency understands the Premier League’s stance remains the same as earlier in the week – that a replay would not be considered. The manager stressed he did not want to single out the individuals involved for the errors made, but wanted to find a solution within the framework of the system which would prevent something similar recurring in futrure. “What I want to say is it’s really important that as big as football is, and important as it is for us, that we really deal with it in a proper way,” he added. “I mean that all the people involved – on-field ref, linesman, fourth official and especially now in this case VAR – they didn’t do that on purpose. We shouldn’t forget that. “I’m not angry with any of them (the officials), not at all. It’s not only the respect, but the only thing for human beings in general is we should not go for them. It’s not allowed to go for them in any way. “They made a mistake and they felt horrible that night, I’m 100 per cent sure. That’s enough for me. Nobody needs further punishment. We should discuss it on a completely normal basis without emotions.” Klopp was still unhappy with some other decisions taken in the game, notably the upgrading of Curtis Jones’ yellow card to a red, and also the two yellow cards issued to Diogo Jota. “The referee got called to the screen and saw for the first three seconds a frozen picture. I would have given immediately a red card for that picture. Then he sees the replay in slow motion and I’d have given a red card for the slow motion. But in reality it’s not a red card. “The ref’s first decision is yellow. Then the clear and obvious mistake is showing a frozen picture and in slow motion. “On top of that, Diogo Jota got two yellow cards for not touching a player once. That is unprecedented as well I would say.” Jota will be available for Thursday’s Europa League visit of Belgian side Union Saint Gilloise but fellow forward Cody Gakpo, who was injured in the Spurs game, is out. At our arrival at Anfield ahead of tonight's training session, we paid tribute to the 97 victims of the Hillsborough disaster. — Royale Union Saint-Gilloise (@UnionStGilloise) Union coach Alexander Blessin believes he could have been a Klopp player himself for Mainz. “He was planning his new squad. He called me and asked ‘How are you?’ ‘Fine’, ‘Blah blah blah’ and we knew each other there a little bit,” said the German. “He said we’d stay in contact and I never heard anything back.” On his side’s chances he added: “We need a really perfect day and they need a bad day. “We will do everything and aren’t here just drinking coffee saying ‘Oh, it’s nice’.”","pubDate":"2023-10-04 18:29:27","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17297086/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"eed31ce203b619e87d5bcc20007e957c","title":"Newcastle v Paris Saint-Germain: Champions League – live","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/oct/04/newcastle-v-paris-saint-germain-champions-league-live","keywords":["Champions League","Newcastle United","Paris Saint-Germain","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Scott Murray"],"video_url":null,"description":"Updates from the 8pm BST kick-off at St James’ ParkGet in touch: email Scott with your thoughtsYou want more on that aforementioned 3-2 win over Barcelona … as well as Newcastle’s last home Champions League game, a 2-0 defeat by the same opponents in 2003?

I never thought I’d say this, but we’ll miss these group stages when they’re gone and tonight’s fixtures are part of the reason why. I will, of course, be providing updates on Newcastle v PSG – a game you can follow in MBM form here – but there’s a surfeit of other behaviour to enjoy, so let’s get on with that, beginning with the other fixture in that group, Borussia Dortmund v AC Milan. The German unchampions competed well enough losing in Paris the other week, though looked worryingly impotent, while Milan will still be smarting they failed to beat the Geordies; in what looks like being a tight group, home wins are essential. In Group E, Lazio – who drew 1-1 at home to Atlético in “gameweek 1” visit Parkhead with Celtic , beaten 2-0 in Rotterdam, in desperate need a result. Meantime, Atléti and Feyernoord are 2-2 with 50 or so minutes gone. Group G serves us winners v winners and losers v losers, holders Manchester City travelling to face Leipzig with Crvena zvezda taking on Young Boys, while in Group H, two more victors from the first round of games meet with Porto entertaining Barcelona; the meeting between the losers sees Antwerp leading Shakhtar 2-1. As Burna Boy sings, it’s plenty. It’s just a shame Uefa – and the clubs – aren’t listening.

He added that it’s “mad” that some of the Blues fans have overlooked the red flags surrounding the US investment firm, but he believes they are just desperate to see the back of the current ownership on Merseyside. “Do Everton really need to be in a network?” asked Critchley. “If there’s a club at the minute that needs the full and undivided attention of whoever is in charge there, it’s Everton. “They’ve got all these debts, they’ve got to finish the stadium, they’ve got to keep their head above water. It demands that kind of engagement and that kind of attention that only really some owners that are absolutely dedicated and committed can give to it. “It’s mad at the same time how despite all these red flags and all the scare stories, a lot of fans are still willing to give them a go because they are just desperate. It just speaks to the air of desperation.” There have been an awful lot of red flags surrounding 777 and the Everton fans should really be cautious about who they are letting take over their historic club. In the latest concerning development to come out about the group, The Guardian on Monday (2 October) that it had missed three transfer payments worth £4.5million at Vasco de Gama, one of the other clubs it owns. That has led to the Brazilian side being hit with a transfer ban by FIFA after the unpaid payments were recently reported to the governing body. It’s understandable that the Blues fans want to see an end to Farhad Moshiri’s time at the club, but there is nothing to suggest that the US company can take them forward. Although there will be plenty of due diligence done over the next couple of months to ensure it is the best party to take over at Goodison, there are huge question marks around the firm at this moment in time.","pubDate":"2023-10-04 17:40:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/09/Resizing-template-2023-09-13T144329.031-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6e846e1c1eae648cb0c62e9414a566b0","title":"ISL 2023-24: Javi Hernandez Scores Wonder Goal to Inspire Bengaluru FC to 2-1 Win Over East Bengal","link":"https://www.news18.com/football/isl-2023-24-javi-hernandez-scores-wonder-goal-to-inspire-bengaluru-fc-to-2-1-win-over-east-bengal-8603338.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Javi Hernandez scored the winner for Bengaluru after Sunil Chhetri cancelled out the early strike from Naorem Mahesh Singh, Blue pick up first win this season","content":"Bengaluru FC wrapped up an intriguing battle against their former head coach Carles Cuadrat’s East Bengal FC with a 2-1 win at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium tonight. The Blues were put behind in the contest by Naorem Mahesh Singh, who struck a goal in the 15th minute. However, Chhetri converted a kick from the spot in the 21st minute before Javi Hernandez secured the winner with an acrobatic bicycle kick in the second half to seal the first victory of the season for Simon Grayson’s men. Nanda Kumar carved open the Bengaluru backline with an impressive through ball that was gathered well by Mahesh 15 minutes into the game. Mahesh’s first touch and footwork helped him get past the home team’s centre-back pairing of Parag Srivas and Slavko Damjanovic. He then had only goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to get past and the attacker made light work of the same much to Cuadrat’s happiness. However, the wave of optimism was short lived as Mandar Rao Dessai brought down Chhetri inside the 18-yard box to hand a spot-kick to the home team merely four minutes later. The 39-year-old was flawless as ever as he deposited the ball to the bottom right corner to draw the scores level at a crucial juncture in the first half.

The duo of Mahesh and Nanda combined again in the second half to give their team a potential winning strike. Mahesh shifted wide and curled in a pass that eased past Bengaluru’s defensive line to land at Nanda’s feet on the left flank. However, the winger couldn’t keep his shot on target and ended up hitting way above the crossbar to blow away a well-crafted opportunity. Eventually, Javi Hernandez pulled off an absolute entertainer to delight the home crowd and bag three points for his team in the 72nd minute. Young forward Rohit Danu frenetically managed to get the ball to the attacking midfielder through a headed pass. Hernandez chipped it up and then bicycle kicked it into the back of the net to sum up a move fitting of his delightful creativity and goal-scoring prowess. Hernandez broke into a cheerful celebration as Grayson’s impeccable in-game management ensured that East Bengal couldn’t come close to equalising after that.

The bid “intends to deliver a world-class tournament and will draw inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s ongoing social and economic transformation and the country’s deep-rooted passion for football”, said a statement from the Saudi Arabian football federation. News of the bid comes one year after neighbouring Qatar hosted the first World Cup in the Middle East, where the Saudi national team scored a stunning group stage victory over eventual winners Argentina. The Saudi announcement came an hour after world football’s governing body FIFA released a statement giving its plans for the 2030 World Cup and inviting countries in the Asian Football Confederation to bid for 2034. On the heels of the Qatar tournament, Saudi Arabia signed Cristiano Ronaldo to play in the Saudi Pro League, the first in a slew of major stars drawn by eye-watering salaries to the world’s biggest crude oil exporter. Sport is a major component of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to transform Saudi Arabia into a tourism and business hub while transitioning the economy away from fossil fuels. – Spending spree – In the coming weeks, the kingdom is set to host the final LIV Golf League tournament of the regular season, a boxing match featuring Anthony Joshua and the Next Gen ATP Finals tennis tournament. It will also host the FIFA Club World Cup in December. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia was confirmed as host of football’s 2027 Asian Cup. That event will enable Saudi officials to improve on existing football infrastructure, with new “world-class stadiums” constructed “in the most sustainable ways”, Saudi Football Federation President, Yasser Al Misehal, said on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia previously explored a tri-continental World Cup bid with Egypt and Greece, though that plan has been shelved. The new Saudi-only bid means fans would face “maximum three-hour flying times between cities and stadiums”, Misehal said.

In an interview with Fox News last month, Prince Mohammed dismissed those attacks, saying “I will continue doing sportswashing” if it will benefit the Saudi economy. – Prince in spotlight – Hosting the World Cup would ratchet up scrutiny of the 38-year-old de facto ruler, who critics accuse of consolidating power through a fierce crackdown on dissent, including one recent case in which a retired teacher was sentenced to death for critical social media posts. Prince Mohammed told Fox he was “ashamed” of that verdict. World Cup-related construction could also draw a backlash from environmental activists who sounded the alarm last year after Saudi Arabia was awarded hosting rights for the 2029 Asian Winter Games, a 47-event competition to be held in Trojena, an area of the planned $500 billion futuristic megacity known as NEOM. At the time, Greenpeace questioned how plans for Trojena – including a man-made freshwater lake, chalets, mansions and ultra-luxury hotels – could possibly be sustainable. But Riyadh would be keen to use the World Cup as a showcase for various natural attractions, dispelling the notion that Saudi Arabia is one giant desert. But Misehal said on Wednesday that fans would be drawn to “our mountains, our islands and of course our culture”, adding: “Everything will be connected with state-of-the-art facilities to guarantee an amazing fan experience.” The Asian Football Confederation came out in support of the Saudi 2034 World Cup bid shortly after it was announced on Wednesday. “I am delighted to note that the (Saudi football federation) have presented their intention to bid for the FIFA World Cup in 2034,” said AFC President Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa. “The entire Asian football family will stand united in support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s momentous initiative, and we are committed to working closely with the global football family to ensure its success.” AFP","pubDate":"2023-10-04 19:03:40","image_url":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/04080630/World-Cup.jpg","source_id":"punchng","source_priority":19103,"country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cf76f0173a19c03c9786d5d28a8d3c34","title":"Osimhen Will Renew Napoli’s Contract — De Laurentiis","link":"https://www.completesports.com/osimhen-will-renew-napolis-contract-de-laurentiis/","keywords":["Nigerian Footballers Abroad","Série A News"],"creator":["Austin Akhilomen"],"video_url":null,"description":"Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis has assured the Naple fans that Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen will renew his contract with the club.

Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been chosen as the sole candidate to host the World Cup. However in order to celebrate one of the biggest tournament’s 100th anniversary, centenary celebration and celebratory games will take place in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. The first of these three matches which will be played in South America will be played at the stadium where it all began, in Montevideo’s Estadio Centenario. With this, all six nations – Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have directly qualified for the tournament. “The FIFA Council unanimously agreed that the sole candidacy will be the combined bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, which will host the event in 2030 and qualify automatically from the existing slot allocation subject to the completion of a successful bidding process conducted by FIFA and a decision by the FIFA Congress in 2024,” as quoted from a statement by FIFA. FIFA President Gianni Infantino talked about how football will be uniting different pasts of the world and said as quoted from the official website of FIFA, “In a divided world, FIFA and football are uniting. The FIFA Council, representing the entire world of football, unanimously agreed to celebrate the centenary of the FIFA World Cup, whose first edition was played in Uruguay in 1930, in the most appropriate way. As a result, a celebration will take place in South America and three South American countries – Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay – will organise one match each of the FIFA World Cup 2030. The first of these three matches will of course be played at the stadium where it all began, in Montevideo’s mythical Estadio Centenario, precisely to celebrate the centenary edition of the FIFA World Cup.” “In 2030, we will have a unique global footprint, three continents — Africa, Europe and South America — six countries — Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and Uruguay — welcoming and uniting the world while celebrating together the beautiful game, the centenary and the FIFA World Cup,” Infantino added.","pubDate":"2023-10-04 18:31:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsmill","source_priority":3781717,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5ed19925d7c5e96c8036c28e8fae5b9c","title":"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp admits his call for Tottenham replay is unlikely","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23834733.liverpool-boss-jurgen-klopp-admits-call-tottenham-replay-unlikely/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"With the score at 0-0, Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was flagged offside but replays showed he was actually onside, which VAR failed to correct.","content":"With the score at 0-0, Diaz was flagged offside but replays showed he was actually onside although Darren England, the VAR, mistakenly believed the on-field decision had been to award the goal, leading him to tell referee Simon Hooper the check was complete. Liverpool’s complaints promoted the publication of the audio between officials which revealed the first person to spot the mistake was the replay operator, who urged the team of officials to stop the game, but the VAR and assistant VAR repeatedly said they could not intervene because play had restarted. Klopp felt such an unprecedented scenario required a similarly unprecedented solution. “The audio didn’t change it at all because I was not really interested in why things happened because I knew,” he said. “I saw the outcome, I saw goal we scored and it didn’t count so I wasn’t now waiting for the audio and sitting there hoping I’d find out how it could happen or whatever. “Yes, it was an obvious mistake and I think there would have been solutions for it afterwards. “If not, I can say immediately – and probably some people don’t want me to say it – not as the manager of Liverpool but, much more as a football person, I think the only outcome should be a replay. It probably will not happen. “The argument against that will probably be if you open that gate then everybody will ask for it. I think the situation is that unprecedented – it didn’t happen before. “I’m 56 years old and I’m absolutely used to wrong decisions, difficult decisions but something like that as far as I can remember has never happened. That’s why I think the replay would be the right thing. “The next argument would be if it would happen again, I think a replay would be the right thing to do or the referee has the opportunity to bring both coaches together and say ‘sorry, we made a mistake, but we can sort it, that Liverpool score a goal and we start from there’.” PGMOL can confirm that we have carried out a review into the circumstances which led to the Luis Diaz goal being incorrectly disallowed for offside in the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur FC and Liverpool FC. Full statement and the audio between the on-field team… — PGMOL (@FA_PGMOL) Asked whether the club had made – or would make – a formal request for the match to be replayed Klopp, after taking advice from his press officer, said: “We are still going through the information that we have.” The PA news agency understands the Premier League’s stance remains the same as earlier in the week – that a replay would not be considered. The manager stressed he did not want to single out the individuals involved for the errors made, but wanted to find a solution within the framework of the system which would prevent something similar recurring in futrure. “What I want to say is it’s really important that as big as football is, and important as it is for us, that we really deal with it in a proper way,” he added. “I mean that all the people involved – on-field ref, linesman, fourth official and especially now in this case VAR – they didn’t do that on purpose. We shouldn’t forget that. “I’m not angry with any of them (the officials), not at all. It’s not only the respect, but the only thing for human beings in general is we should not go for them. It’s not allowed to go for them in any way. “They made a mistake and they felt horrible that night, I’m 100 per cent sure. That’s enough for me. Nobody needs further punishment. We should discuss it on a completely normal basis without emotions.” Klopp was still unhappy with some other decisions taken in the game, notably the upgrading of Curtis Jones’ yellow card to a red, and also the two yellow cards issued to Diogo Jota. “The referee got called to the screen and saw for the first three seconds a frozen picture. I would have given immediately a red card for that picture. Then he sees the replay in slow motion and I’d have given a red card for the slow motion. But in reality it’s not a red card. “The ref’s first decision is yellow. Then the clear and obvious mistake is showing a frozen picture and in slow motion. “On top of that, Diogo Jota got two yellow cards for not touching a player once. That is unprecedented as well I would say.” Jota will be available for Thursday’s Europa League visit of Belgian side Union Saint Gilloise but fellow forward Cody Gakpo, who was injured in the Spurs game, is out.

Newcastle will fancy their chances, though, having not lost at home in Europe since Deportivo La Coruña came to town in the 2006 Intertoto. Could be a cracker. Kick off is at 8pm BST. It’s on!

And yet. 4m ago 14.55 EDT “My late father,” begins Scott Blair, “despite various health problems including having suffered tuberculosis as a young man, was a fiercely committed smoker and (in his later years) inveterate cardigan-wearer. It must have been around his 60 th birthday when my mum bought him a new one, and it was clear it hadn’t gone down all that well. Pressed for an explanation, he pointed out that the cardy only had one pocket, whereas he required two – ‘one for my fags, and one for my inhaler.’ I’ll be surprised if there’s a crossover with the tailoring options of the Man City version, but thought I’d share anyway!” Tremendous. 6m ago 14.53 EDT Looking at the Celtic team, they’ve got the players to hurt Lazio . I worry about them defensively, but Kyogo and Daizen Maeda are trouble, when given scope to create. 9m ago 14.49 EDT And Shakhtar have won 3-2 in Antwerp. they join Porto and Barcelona on three points. 11m ago 14.48 EDT Atleti have beaten Feyenoord 3-2; they top Group E with four points while Feyenoord have three. Lazio and Celtic have one and none respectively. 13m ago 14.45 EDT Just the five goals for Haaland last time City played Leipzig. 18m ago 14.40 EDT Email! “Aside from Erling Haaland looking like he could play a particularly dangerous Targaryen in House of The Dragon,” says Nick Smith, “I can’t be the only one to think Paddy Considine could play Scott Carson in the inevitable movie of his life? Anyone? I’ll get my cardigan…” I’d love to see his interpretation of the Bursaspor period. Photograph: Lexy Ilsley/Manchester City FC/Getty Images Updated at 14.48 EDT 25m ago 14.33 EDT Eddie Howe has picked the team you expect him to. I guess Jacob Murphy might be disappointed to miss out, but Miguel Almiron has been in good nick recently, so. Paris, meanwhile, are playing a 4-4-2 – I think – with Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe flanking Manuel Ugarte and Warren Zaire-Emery in midfield, behind Goncalo Ramos and Randal Kolo Muani. It might, though, also be a 4-4-2 diamond – we shall see. 30m ago 14.29 EDT In Antwerp, Shakhtar now lead 3-2; Atleti sare still 3-2 in front at home to Feyenoord. 31m ago 14.27 EDT Leipzig, meanwhile, will play 4-2-2-2, one of my least favourite formations. But they’ve been playing it pretty well so far this season, and Emil Forsberg is a player who might give City trouble. 33m ago 14.26 EDT We’ll stick with City to look who starts for them and, at the back, Josko Gvardiol replaces Nathan Ake. In midfield, it’s Rico Lewis and Rodri, not Matteo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes while, behind Haaland, Grealish and Bernardo replace Alvarez and Doku. City appear to have some strength in depth. 37m ago 14.22 EDT So yes, this – but with CARSON 33 on the back.

I never thought I’d say this, but we’ll miss these group stages when they’re gone and tonight’s fixtures are part of the reason why. I will, of course, be providing updates on Newcastle v PSG – a game you can follow in MBM form here – but there’s a surfeit of other behaviour to enjoy, so let’s get on with that, beginning with the other fixture in that group, Borussia Dortmund v AC Milan. The German unchampions competed well enough losing in Paris the other week, though looked worryingly impotent, while Milan will still be smarting they failed to beat the Geordies; in what looks like being a tight group, home wins are essential. In Group E, Lazio – who drew 1-1 at home to Atlético in “gameweek 1” visit Parkhead with Celtic , beaten 2-0 in Rotterdam, in desperate need a result. Meantime, Atléti and Feyernoord are 2-2 with 50 or so minutes gone. Group G serves us winners v winners and losers v losers, holders Manchester City travelling to face Leipzig with Crvena zvezda taking on Young Boys, while in Group H, two more victors from the first round of games meet with Porto entertaining Barcelona; the meeting between the losers sees Antwerp leading Shakhtar 2-1. As Burna Boy sings, it’s plenty. It’s just a shame Uefa – and the clubs – aren’t listening.

He added that it’s “mad” that some of the Blues fans have overlooked the red flags surrounding the US investment firm, but he believes they are just desperate to see the back of the current ownership on Merseyside. “Do Everton really need to be in a network?” asked Critchley. “If there’s a club at the minute that needs the full and undivided attention of whoever is in charge there, it’s Everton. “They’ve got all these debts, they’ve got to finish the stadium, they’ve got to keep their head above water. It demands that kind of engagement and that kind of attention that only really some owners that are absolutely dedicated and committed can give to it. “It’s mad at the same time how despite all these red flags and all the scare stories, a lot of fans are still willing to give them a go because they are just desperate. It just speaks to the air of desperation.” There have been an awful lot of red flags surrounding 777 and the Everton fans should really be cautious about who they are letting take over their historic club. In the latest concerning development to come out about the group, The Guardian on Monday (2 October) that it had missed three transfer payments worth £4.5million at Vasco de Gama, one of the other clubs it owns. That has led to the Brazilian side being hit with a transfer ban by FIFA after the unpaid payments were recently reported to the governing body. It’s understandable that the Blues fans want to see an end to Farhad Moshiri’s time at the club, but there is nothing to suggest that the US company can take them forward. Although there will be plenty of due diligence done over the next couple of months to ensure it is the best party to take over at Goodison, there are huge question marks around the firm at this moment in time.","pubDate":"2023-10-04 17:40:00","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/09/Resizing-template-2023-09-13T144329.031-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","source_priority":120305,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"6e846e1c1eae648cb0c62e9414a566b0","title":"ISL 2023-24: Javi Hernandez Scores Wonder Goal to Inspire Bengaluru FC to 2-1 Win Over East Bengal","link":"https://www.news18.com/football/isl-2023-24-javi-hernandez-scores-wonder-goal-to-inspire-bengaluru-fc-to-2-1-win-over-east-bengal-8603338.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Javi Hernandez scored the winner for Bengaluru after Sunil Chhetri cancelled out the early strike from Naorem Mahesh Singh, Blue pick up first win this season","content":"Bengaluru FC wrapped up an intriguing battle against their former head coach Carles Cuadrat’s East Bengal FC with a 2-1 win at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium tonight. The Blues were put behind in the contest by Naorem Mahesh Singh, who struck a goal in the 15th minute. However, Chhetri converted a kick from the spot in the 21st minute before Javi Hernandez secured the winner with an acrobatic bicycle kick in the second half to seal the first victory of the season for Simon Grayson’s men. Nanda Kumar carved open the Bengaluru backline with an impressive through ball that was gathered well by Mahesh 15 minutes into the game. Mahesh’s first touch and footwork helped him get past the home team’s centre-back pairing of Parag Srivas and Slavko Damjanovic. He then had only goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to get past and the attacker made light work of the same much to Cuadrat’s happiness. However, the wave of optimism was short lived as Mandar Rao Dessai brought down Chhetri inside the 18-yard box to hand a spot-kick to the home team merely four minutes later. The 39-year-old was flawless as ever as he deposited the ball to the bottom right corner to draw the scores level at a crucial juncture in the first half.

The duo of Mahesh and Nanda combined again in the second half to give their team a potential winning strike. Mahesh shifted wide and curled in a pass that eased past Bengaluru’s defensive line to land at Nanda’s feet on the left flank. However, the winger couldn’t keep his shot on target and ended up hitting way above the crossbar to blow away a well-crafted opportunity. Eventually, Javi Hernandez pulled off an absolute entertainer to delight the home crowd and bag three points for his team in the 72nd minute. Young forward Rohit Danu frenetically managed to get the ball to the attacking midfielder through a headed pass. Hernandez chipped it up and then bicycle kicked it into the back of the net to sum up a move fitting of his delightful creativity and goal-scoring prowess. Hernandez broke into a cheerful celebration as Grayson’s impeccable in-game management ensured that East Bengal couldn’t come close to equalising after that.
