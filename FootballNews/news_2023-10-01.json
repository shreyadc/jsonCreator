Neville, formerly of Manchester United, has been vocal in his support of Ten Hag amid difficult circumstances at Old Trafford with the club's owners the Glazer family collaring criticism from supporters and ex-players. Posting a lengthy statement on his X - formerly Twitter - account, Neville explained he was giving his 'Sunday opinion' on the weekend's biggest Premier League talking points. Erik ten Hag is under pressure in his position as Man United manager caused by a disastrous start to the new season Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino (middle) has endured a nightmare start to life at the club 'Chelsea and United are the way they are currently due to cultural issues and chaos.

American co-owner Todd Boehly sanctioned huge spending in the three transfer windows he has overseen since completing a £4.25bn takeover of the Blues in May last year.

Controversy arose on Saturday after Luis Diaz looked to have given his side the lead, before his goal in the first-half was controversially ruled out for offside following a VAR review. However, it later emerged that the decision was a result of a miscommunication between the on-field officials and those on VAR. Darren England was the man tasked with VAR duties for the match, with Dan Cook acting as assistant VAR. On Sunday morning, PGMOL confirmed that both England and Cook would step down from their roles for upcoming fixtures before Keys took to social media to vent his own thoughts. The former Sky Sports presenter suggested that Michael Oliver should have been in charge of the match instead of England - who were both in Saudi Arabia earlier this week. Richard Keys has questioned why PGMOL decided to appoint Darren England as the VAR instead of Michael Oliver (left) for Tottenham's 2-1 win over Liverpool PGMOL have since confirmed that VAR official Darren England (pictured) and VAR assistant Dan Cook (not pictured) will step down from their roles for upcoming fixtures Keys took to social media to vent his frustrations following drama in Spurs' win over Liverpool VAR ruled out a Liverpool goal against Tottenham, despite replays clearing showing Luis Diaz was being played onside by Cristian Romero Your browser does not support iframes. In a Tweet , Keys wrote: 'Why was Michael Oliver in UAE to ref Thursday’s game between Al Sharjah v Al Ain? Darren England assisted in VAR. 'Oliver wasn’t involved yesterday. He’s VAR today. Too tired? If so why wasn’t England stood down? Better still - stop this freelancing. More in tomorrows blog'. According to The Sun , Oliver was approached by Saudi Arabia to begin officiating over in the middle east and, as a result, went to officiate the biggest match in the United Arab Emirates Pro League between Sharjah and Al Ain. Oliver was also joined by England, who was on VAR duty, and assistants Stuart Burt and Dan Cook - who did not return to England until Friday night. Despite Keys' claims, Oliver was in-fact on duty during the Tottenham and Liverpool clash on Saturday, as he took on the fourth official role - with England and Cook taking on VAR duties. Almost immediately after the match, PGMOL admitted that Diaz 's strike was incorrectly ruled out for offside and issued an apology to Liverpool. 'PGMOL acknowledge a significant human error occurred during the first half of Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool,' the statement began. 'The goal but Luis Diaz was disallowed for offside by the on-field team of match officials. This was a clear and obvious factual error and should have resulted in the goal being awarded through VAR intervention, however, the VAR failed to intervene. 'PGMOL will conduct a full review into the circumstances which led to the error. 'PGMOL will immediately be contacting Liverpool at the conclusion of the fixture to acknowledge the error.' Diaz appeared to beat the offside trap to convert before it was ruled out for offside Replays showed that the decision was the wrong one, with PGMOL coming out after the match to issue a statement The incident drew criticisms from fans, analysts and even managers - as Jurgen Klopp lashed out at the error during a post-match interview. After hearing the statement, Klopp said: 'Does that help? No. We had that situation at the Man United game (against Wolves last month) – did they get points for that? No. We will not get points for it today so it doesn't help. 'Nobody expects 100 per cent right decisions on field. I think we all thought when VAR came in, it might make things easier. I don't know why people are acting under that much pressure. Today the decision was made really quickly for the goal. It changed the momentum of the game.' IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

In a game that will live long in the memory, mostly for negative reasons, left north London with nothing to show for their commendable effort. ’s side battled admirably for more than 20 minutes with nine men after a disputed straight red for in the first half and two yellow cards for . A heart-wrenching own goal from in the final minute of added time proved to be the winner for Spurs, following cancelling out Son Heung-min’s opener before the interval. However, the game could have easily looked completely different, if not for a glaring error by the officials. After going down to 10 men, Jurgen Klopp’s side refused to allow their heads to drop. With the game still goalless, got himself in behind Tottenham's backline and produced an inch-perfect finish to seemingly put ahead but it was swiftly ruled out for offside by the assistant referee and VAR did not reverse the decision. Refereeing body PGMOL released a statement admitting that Diaz’s goal should have stood and that a had led VAR to not intervene. During the broadcast of the game, there were no lines drawn to indicate whether Diaz was offside or not. Despite the mistake benefitting his former side, O’Hara hit out at the officials on social media. “Seriously though, I’ll take the three points all day but these refs are becoming an absolute shambles,” the pundit wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I could see from the studio on a small tv it was onside, just bin it if you can’t even get clear decisions correct.” When informed that PGMOL had admitted the mistake and would be conducting a review of the incident, Liverpool boss : “Does that help now? We had that situation in the Man United game (on the opening weekend), did Wolves get points for it? No. We will not get points for it.

It was the Hatters' first win as a Premier League club and killed all the momentum the Blues' had built up by their 3-1 success at Brentford and 2-1 triumph at Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup. And here Chris Beesley picks out some moments you might have missed from what was another miserable day for Blues at Goodison Park. On what was a pretty shambolic defensive display from with a couple of major first-half lapses costing them dearly, it was actually the youngest and least-experienced of the hosts’ back four who came out of this contest with the greatest credit. Despite playing in a struggling side, , who only turned 21 on June 27, has shown great promise since coming into the side after the 4-0 thrashing at Aston Villa in the Blues’ first away game. There was one particular moment that caught the eye here as Luton’s Marvelous Nakama – no slouch himself – burst clear toward goal but despite the Zimbabwe midfielder having a head start on him, the Everton centre-back caught him up to make a strong recovery tackle that had many of the home fans cheering and on their feet. Soon afterwards, one highly-experienced member of the Merseyside press pack told a colleague that he believes Branthwaite is going to be a really top defender and given his assured displays at such tender years, there’s a feel of about him. Going further back, the way the Cumbrian used his pace to get back and make the challenge, there were even shades of another left-sided centre-back, Everton’s most-successful captain Kevin Ratcliffe, but given his size and strength, Branthwaite has the potential to be even more of a colossus than either of that highly-decorated pair. The only real glimmer of hope that loyal but long-suffering Evertonians can take from this game is that netted his third goal in as many matches for what was his team’s first strike at Goodison Park this season, ending a drought stretching back to May 28 when registered in spectacular fashion to avoid what would have been the club’s first relegation in 72 years. However, even this moment of relief was tempered by an agonising wait for what seemed like an eternity with an even longer than usual VAR review by Wigan-based official Paul Tierney down in London at Stockley Park. There was so much going on in the goalmouth scramble with Luton’s Reece Burke appearing to tug jersey then Doucoure and Calvert-Lewin steaming in ahead of Burke and Amari’i Bell for the loose ball. But Anthony Taylor for once had a decision taken out of his hands – probably to the relief of many in the crowd – and pointed back toward the centre circle to award the goal. During the nervous period that the decision was being made, dozens of fans in close proximity to the press box in Goodison’s Main Stand attempted to crane their necks to try and catch a glimpse of the replays. In truth though, the screens in that area are difficult enough for even working members of the media to see and even if you do come to a conclusion to what you’re convinced you saw, there’s no guarantee the powers that be are even going to agree. Top brass from Everton’s prospective new owners, got their first taste of Goodison Park with the Miami-based private investment firm’s co-founders and Steve Pasko both attending the game alongside Don Dransfield, CEO of 777’s football group. Americans Wander and Pasko stood out in the directors’ box as they both sported baseball caps but while Pasko, the older of the pair, kept out the chill on a wet weekend in Walton with a cardigan and scarf underneath his jacket, Wander did make the effort to garner favour with Evertonians by sporting a royal blue tie as he took his place in the stands next to director of football . When asked when leaving whether he had enjoyed his first Goodison Park experience, Wander replied: “Except the result,” but even that had an ominous ring to it. 7+7+7= 21.

Liverpool went down to nine men as Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota were sent off in the feisty clash before an own goal by Joel Matip sealed a stoppage-time win for Spurs. The Merseyside club thought it had taken the lead in the first half through Luis Diaz who got behind the defence and fired into the bottom corner past goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. However, the goal was ruled out by the referee for offside. The referees’ body, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), later admitted it was the wrong decision to disallow Diaz’s effort, blaming human error, and “should have resulted in the goal being awarded through VAR intervention”. In a statement on Sunday, the PGMOL said: “Darren England, VAR on the Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool fixture, and Dan Cook, (assistant VAR) on the same game, have been replaced for the Nottingham Forest v Brentford and Fulham v Chelsea matches today and tomorrow night respectively. “Craig Pawson will now assume England’s duties as fourth official at the City Ground while Eddie Smart will take over from Cook as assistant referee at Craven Cottage.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2023-10-01 10:45:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bd4abec705c3632d638e136dd7ba6c67","title":"Josh Wander delivers three-word Everton verdict after Goodison Park visit","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/josh-wander-three-word-message-27819383","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"777 Partners co-founders Josh Wander and Steve Pasko watched on as Everton were defeated at home by Luton Town","content":"Prospective Everton buyer Josh Wander responded with a three-word answer when asked if he enjoyed his first match at Goodison Park.

England’s triumphant World Cup (in the Italia 90 sense) and the rapid growth of women’s football makes this the most keenly anticipated season of all. We’ll be covering all six games in a special, marathon, pressure-sore-inducing opening-day clockwatch. The most intriguing is probably at Villa Park, where Aston Villa, easily the best of the rest last season, host title-chasing Manchester United. The champions Chelsea host Spurs in the late game, Arsenal play Liverpool at the Emirates and Manchester City have a tricky trip to West Ham. Most excitingly of all, a host of star signings, from Alessia Russo to Hinata Miyazawa, should make WSL debuts for their new teams.

England was due to be the fourth official at the City Ground and Cook the assistant referee at Craven Cottage. Luis Díaz thought he had scored the opening goal at Tottenham only for a flag to go up. But rather than overrule the on-field decision, England, the VAR, called “check complete” because he had not noticed the goal had been disallowed and instead thought it had been given by the referee, Simon Hooper. The PGMOL issued an apology for the “significant human error” and for England’s lapse of concentration. Since the start of last season, the PGMOL has apologised for mistakes on 14 occasions. Jürgen Klopp was left bewildered by the disallowed goal but cut England some slack . “I am pretty sure whoever made the decision didn’t do it on purpose,” the Liverpool manager said after what was his team’s first defeat of the season. “It didn’t take extremely long to come to the conclusion. That’s a bit strange but someone else has to explain.” As with all goals, the VAR checks every element of the goal to ensure they are correct. The lines were drawn and the process was correctly followed. However, England lost focus of the initial onfield decision. PGMOL acknowledged the decision to rule out Díaz’s 34th-minute goal was a “clear and obvious factual error”. The error is another mortifying episode in a difficult season for PGMOL and its implementation of VAR. The first weekend of the season was marred by the match officials failing to award Wolves a stoppage-time penalty, leading to Hooper, also the referee that day, Michael Salisbury, the VAR, and Richard West, the AVAR, being dropped from duty for the following round of matches . Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer at PGMOL, has stressed referees must be accountable for their decisions in bid to make the organisation and its working practices more transparent and understood. However, this latest error will further and severely test the credibility of all involved. Speaking on Sky Sports after Saturday’s game, Gary Neville said of the Díaz decision: “That is unbelievable. That is a bad one. They said [in the statement], ‘significant’. That is very significant.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both giants of English football have endured tortured starts to the new season with Erik ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino coming under increasing pressure in their managerial positions. Neville, formerly of Manchester United, has been vocal in his support of Ten Hag amid difficult circumstances at Old Trafford with the club's owners the Glazer family collaring criticism from supporters and ex-players.

Controversy arose on Saturday after Luis Diaz looked to have given his side the lead, before his goal in the first-half was controversially ruled out for offside following a VAR review. However, it later emerged that the decision was a result of a miscommunication between the on-field officials and those on VAR. Darren England was the man tasked with VAR duties for the match, with Dan Cook acting as assistant VAR. On Sunday morning, PGMOL confirmed that both England and Cook would step down from their roles for upcoming fixtures before Keys took to social media to vent his own thoughts. The former Sky Sports presenter suggested that Michael Oliver should have been in charge of the match instead of England - who were both in Saudi Arabia earlier this week. Richard Keys has questioned why PGMOL decided to appoint Darren England as the VAR instead of Michael Oliver (left) for Tottenham's 2-1 win over Liverpool PGMOL have since confirmed that VAR official Darren England (pictured) and VAR assistant Dan Cook (not pictured) will step down from their roles for upcoming fixtures Keys took to social media to vent his frustrations following drama in Spurs' win over Liverpool VAR ruled out a Liverpool goal against Tottenham, despite replays clearing showing Luis Diaz was being played onside by Cristian Romero Your browser does not support iframes. In a Tweet , Keys wrote: 'Why was Michael Oliver in UAE to ref Thursday’s game between Al Sharjah v Al Ain? Darren England assisted in VAR. 'Oliver wasn’t involved yesterday. He’s VAR today. Too tired? If so why wasn’t England stood down? Better still - stop this freelancing. More in tomorrows blog'. According to The Sun , Oliver was approached by Saudi Arabia to begin officiating over in the middle east and, as a result, went to officiate the biggest match in the United Arab Emirates Pro League between Sharjah and Al Ain. Oliver was also joined by England, who was on VAR duty, and assistants Stuart Burt and Dan Cook - who did not return to England until Friday night. Despite Keys' claims, Oliver was in-fact on duty during the Tottenham and Liverpool clash on Saturday, as he took on the fourth official role - with England and Cook taking on VAR duties. Almost immediately after the match, PGMOL admitted that Diaz 's strike was incorrectly ruled out for offside and issued an apology to Liverpool. 'PGMOL acknowledge a significant human error occurred during the first half of Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool,' the statement began. 'The goal but Luis Diaz was disallowed for offside by the on-field team of match officials. This was a clear and obvious factual error and should have resulted in the goal being awarded through VAR intervention, however, the VAR failed to intervene. 'PGMOL will conduct a full review into the circumstances which led to the error. 'PGMOL will immediately be contacting Liverpool at the conclusion of the fixture to acknowledge the error.' Diaz appeared to beat the offside trap to convert before it was ruled out for offside Replays showed that the decision was the wrong one, with PGMOL coming out after the match to issue a statement The incident drew criticisms from fans, analysts and even managers - as Jurgen Klopp lashed out at the error during a post-match interview. After hearing the statement, Klopp said: 'Does that help? No. We had that situation at the Man United game (against Wolves last month) – did they get points for that? No. We will not get points for it today so it doesn't help. 'Nobody expects 100 per cent right decisions on field. I think we all thought when VAR came in, it might make things easier. I don't know why people are acting under that much pressure. Today the decision was made really quickly for the goal. It changed the momentum of the game.' IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

A heart-wrenching own goal from in the final minute of added time proved to be the winner for Spurs, following cancelling out Son Heung-min’s opener before the interval.

It was the Hatters' first win as a Premier League club and killed all the momentum the Blues' had built up by their 3-1 success at Brentford and 2-1 triumph at Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup. And here Chris Beesley picks out some moments you might have missed from what was another miserable day for Blues at Goodison Park. On what was a pretty shambolic defensive display from with a couple of major first-half lapses costing them dearly, it was actually the youngest and least-experienced of the hosts’ back four who came out of this contest with the greatest credit. Despite playing in a struggling side, , who only turned 21 on June 27, has shown great promise since coming into the side after the 4-0 thrashing at Aston Villa in the Blues’ first away game. There was one particular moment that caught the eye here as Luton’s Marvelous Nakama – no slouch himself – burst clear toward goal but despite the Zimbabwe midfielder having a head start on him, the Everton centre-back caught him up to make a strong recovery tackle that had many of the home fans cheering and on their feet. Soon afterwards, one highly-experienced member of the Merseyside press pack told a colleague that he believes Branthwaite is going to be a really top defender and given his assured displays at such tender years, there’s a feel of about him. Going further back, the way the Cumbrian used his pace to get back and make the challenge, there were even shades of another left-sided centre-back, Everton’s most-successful captain Kevin Ratcliffe, but given his size and strength, Branthwaite has the potential to be even more of a colossus than either of that highly-decorated pair. The only real glimmer of hope that loyal but long-suffering Evertonians can take from this game is that netted his third goal in as many matches for what was his team’s first strike at Goodison Park this season, ending a drought stretching back to May 28 when registered in spectacular fashion to avoid what would have been the club’s first relegation in 72 years. However, even this moment of relief was tempered by an agonising wait for what seemed like an eternity with an even longer than usual VAR review by Wigan-based official Paul Tierney down in London at Stockley Park. There was so much going on in the goalmouth scramble with Luton’s Reece Burke appearing to tug jersey then Doucoure and Calvert-Lewin steaming in ahead of Burke and Amari’i Bell for the loose ball. But Anthony Taylor for once had a decision taken out of his hands – probably to the relief of many in the crowd – and pointed back toward the centre circle to award the goal. During the nervous period that the decision was being made, dozens of fans in close proximity to the press box in Goodison’s Main Stand attempted to crane their necks to try and catch a glimpse of the replays. In truth though, the screens in that area are difficult enough for even working members of the media to see and even if you do come to a conclusion to what you’re convinced you saw, there’s no guarantee the powers that be are even going to agree. Top brass from Everton’s prospective new owners, got their first taste of Goodison Park with the Miami-based private investment firm’s co-founders and Steve Pasko both attending the game alongside Don Dransfield, CEO of 777’s football group. Americans Wander and Pasko stood out in the directors’ box as they both sported baseball caps but while Pasko, the older of the pair, kept out the chill on a wet weekend in Walton with a cardigan and scarf underneath his jacket, Wander did make the effort to garner favour with Evertonians by sporting a royal blue tie as he took his place in the stands next to director of football . When asked when leaving whether he had enjoyed his first Goodison Park experience, Wander replied: “Except the result,” but even that had an ominous ring to it. 7+7+7= 21.

Liverpool went down to nine men as Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota were sent off in the feisty clash before an own goal by Joel Matip sealed a stoppage-time win for Spurs. The Merseyside club thought it had taken the lead in the first half through Luis Diaz who got behind the defence and fired into the bottom corner past goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. However, the goal was ruled out by the referee for offside. The referees’ body, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), later admitted it was the wrong decision to disallow Diaz’s effort, blaming human error, and “should have resulted in the goal being awarded through VAR intervention”. In a statement on Sunday, the PGMOL said: “Darren England, VAR on the Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool fixture, and Dan Cook, (assistant VAR) on the same game, have been replaced for the Nottingham Forest v Brentford and Fulham v Chelsea matches today and tomorrow night respectively. “Craig Pawson will now assume England’s duties as fourth official at the City Ground while Eddie Smart will take over from Cook as assistant referee at Craven Cottage.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2023-10-01 10:45:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bd4abec705c3632d638e136dd7ba6c67","title":"Josh Wander delivers three-word Everton verdict after Goodison Park visit","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/josh-wander-three-word-message-27819383","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"777 Partners co-founders Josh Wander and Steve Pasko watched on as Everton were defeated at home by Luton Town","content":"Prospective Everton buyer Josh Wander responded with a three-word answer when asked if he enjoyed his first match at Goodison Park.

England’s triumphant World Cup (in the Italia 90 sense) and the rapid growth of women’s football makes this the most keenly anticipated season of all. We’ll be covering all six games in a special, marathon, pressure-sore-inducing opening-day clockwatch. The most intriguing is probably at Villa Park, where Aston Villa, easily the best of the rest last season, host title-chasing Manchester United. The champions Chelsea host Spurs in the late game, Arsenal play Liverpool at the Emirates and Manchester City have a tricky trip to West Ham. Most excitingly of all, a host of star signings, from Alessia Russo to Hinata Miyazawa, should make WSL debuts for their new teams. We shouldn’t pretend that everything is brilliant – equality remains a thing of the future, and the WSL is a 12-team league in name and a four-team league in nature – but it’s probably fair to say women’s football has never been in a better state. These are today’s games.

England was due to be the fourth official at the City Ground and Cook the assistant referee at Craven Cottage. Luis Díaz thought he had scored the opening goal at Tottenham only for a flag to go up. But rather than overrule the on-field decision, England, the VAR, called “check complete” because he had not noticed the goal had been disallowed and instead thought it had been given by the referee, Simon Hooper. The PGMOL issued an apology for the “significant human error” and for England’s lapse of concentration. Since the start of last season, the PGMOL has apologised for mistakes on 14 occasions. Jürgen Klopp was left bewildered by the disallowed goal but cut England some slack . “I am pretty sure whoever made the decision didn’t do it on purpose,” the Liverpool manager said after what was his team’s first defeat of the season. “It didn’t take extremely long to come to the conclusion. That’s a bit strange but someone else has to explain.” As with all goals, the VAR checks every element of the goal to ensure they are correct. The lines were drawn and the process was correctly followed. However, England lost focus of the initial onfield decision. PGMOL acknowledged the decision to rule out Díaz’s 34th-minute goal was a “clear and obvious factual error”. The error is another mortifying episode in a difficult season for PGMOL and its implementation of VAR. The first weekend of the season was marred by the match officials failing to award Wolves a stoppage-time penalty, leading to Hooper, also the referee that day, Michael Salisbury, the VAR, and Richard West, the AVAR, being dropped from duty for the following round of matches . Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer at PGMOL, has stressed referees must be accountable for their decisions in bid to make the organisation and its working practices more transparent and understood. However, this latest error will further and severely test the credibility of all involved. Speaking on Sky Sports after Saturday’s game, Gary Neville said of the Díaz decision: “That is unbelievable. That is a bad one. They said [in the statement], ‘significant’. That is very significant.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

United slumped to a second consecutive home league defeat against Crystal Palace for the first time in two-years on Saturday while Chelsea prepare to play Fulham on Monday. Both giants of English football have endured tortured starts to the new season with Erik ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino coming under increasing pressure in their managerial positions. Neville, formerly of Manchester United, has been vocal in his support of Ten Hag amid difficult circumstances at Old Trafford with the club's owners the Glazer family collaring criticism from supporters and ex-players. Posting a lengthy statement on his X - formerly Twitter - account, Neville explained he was giving his 'Sunday opinion' on the weekend's biggest Premier League talking points.

Controversy arose on Saturday after Luis Diaz looked to have given his side the lead, before his goal in the first-half was controversially ruled out for offside following a VAR review. However, it later emerged that the decision was a result of a miscommunication between the on-field officials and those on VAR. Darren England was the man tasked with VAR duties for the match, with Dan Cook acting as assistant VAR. On Sunday morning, PGMOL confirmed that both England and Cook would step down from their roles for upcoming fixtures before Keys took to social media to vent his own thoughts. The former Sky Sports presenter suggested that Michael Oliver should have been in charge of the match instead of England - who were both in Saudi Arabia earlier this week. Richard Keys has questioned why PGMOL decided to appoint Darren England as the VAR instead of Michael Oliver (left) for Tottenham's 2-1 win over Liverpool PGMOL have since confirmed that VAR official Darren England (pictured) and VAR assistant Dan Cook (not pictured) will step down from their roles for upcoming fixtures Keys took to social media to vent his frustrations following drama in Spurs' win over Liverpool VAR ruled out a Liverpool goal against Tottenham, despite replays clearing showing Luis Diaz was being played onside by Cristian Romero Your browser does not support iframes. In a Tweet , Keys wrote: 'Why was Michael Oliver in UAE to ref Thursday’s game between Al Sharjah v Al Ain? Darren England assisted in VAR. 'Oliver wasn’t involved yesterday. He’s VAR today. Too tired? If so why wasn’t England stood down? Better still - stop this freelancing. More in tomorrows blog'. According to The Sun , Oliver was approached by Saudi Arabia to begin officiating over in the middle east and, as a result, went to officiate the biggest match in the United Arab Emirates Pro League between Sharjah and Al Ain. Oliver was also joined by England, who was on VAR duty, and assistants Stuart Burt and Dan Cook - who did not return to England until Friday night. Despite Keys' claims, Oliver was in-fact on duty during the Tottenham and Liverpool clash on Saturday, as he took on the fourth official role - with England and Cook taking on VAR duties. Almost immediately after the match, PGMOL admitted that Diaz 's strike was incorrectly ruled out for offside and issued an apology to Liverpool. 'PGMOL acknowledge a significant human error occurred during the first half of Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool,' the statement began. 'The goal but Luis Diaz was disallowed for offside by the on-field team of match officials. This was a clear and obvious factual error and should have resulted in the goal being awarded through VAR intervention, however, the VAR failed to intervene. 'PGMOL will conduct a full review into the circumstances which led to the error. 'PGMOL will immediately be contacting Liverpool at the conclusion of the fixture to acknowledge the error.' Diaz appeared to beat the offside trap to convert before it was ruled out for offside Replays showed that the decision was the wrong one, with PGMOL coming out after the match to issue a statement The incident drew criticisms from fans, analysts and even managers - as Jurgen Klopp lashed out at the error during a post-match interview. After hearing the statement, Klopp said: 'Does that help? No. We had that situation at the Man United game (against Wolves last month) – did they get points for that? No. We will not get points for it today so it doesn't help. 'Nobody expects 100 per cent right decisions on field. I think we all thought when VAR came in, it might make things easier. I don't know why people are acting under that much pressure. Today the decision was made really quickly for the goal. It changed the momentum of the game.' IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

In a game that will live long in the memory, mostly for negative reasons, left north London with nothing to show for their commendable effort. ’s side battled admirably for more than 20 minutes with nine men after a disputed straight red for in the first half and two yellow cards for . A heart-wrenching own goal from in the final minute of added time proved to be the winner for Spurs, following cancelling out Son Heung-min’s opener before the interval. However, the game could have easily looked completely different, if not for a glaring error by the officials. After going down to 10 men, Jurgen Klopp’s side refused to allow their heads to drop. With the game still goalless, got himself in behind Tottenham's backline and produced an inch-perfect finish to seemingly put ahead but it was swiftly ruled out for offside by the assistant referee and VAR did not reverse the decision. Refereeing body PGMOL released a statement admitting that Diaz’s goal should have stood and that a had led VAR to not intervene. During the broadcast of the game, there were no lines drawn to indicate whether Diaz was offside or not. Despite the mistake benefitting his former side, O’Hara hit out at the officials on social media. “Seriously though, I’ll take the three points all day but these refs are becoming an absolute shambles,” the pundit wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I could see from the studio on a small tv it was onside, just bin it if you can’t even get clear decisions correct.” When informed that PGMOL had admitted the mistake and would be conducting a review of the incident, Liverpool boss : “Does that help now? We had that situation in the Man United game (on the opening weekend), did Wolves get points for it? No. We will not get points for it. It doesn’t help. “Nobody expects 100% correct decisions on the field, but we all thought when VAR comes in that it might make things easier.”","pubDate":"2023-10-01 11:01:38","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27820632.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1699280444.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","source_priority":3400,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bdfe9892b9927fc999504303b50ee6b2","title":"Jarrad Branthwaite handed huge Everton compliment as 777 Partners reaction spotted","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jarrad-branthwaite-handed-huge-everton-27820778","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Beesley picks out some moments missed from Everton's 2-1 home defeat to Luton Town","content":"Everton suffered their fourth consecutive home defeat since the start of this season as Luton Town secured a 2-1 victory. It was the Hatters' first win as a Premier League club and killed all the momentum the Blues' had built up by their 3-1 success at Brentford and 2-1 triumph at Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup. And here Chris Beesley picks out some moments you might have missed from what was another miserable day for Blues at Goodison Park. On what was a pretty shambolic defensive display from with a couple of major first-half lapses costing them dearly, it was actually the youngest and least-experienced of the hosts’ back four who came out of this contest with the greatest credit. Despite playing in a struggling side, , who only turned 21 on June 27, has shown great promise since coming into the side after the 4-0 thrashing at Aston Villa in the Blues’ first away game. There was one particular moment that caught the eye here as Luton’s Marvelous Nakama – no slouch himself – burst clear toward goal but despite the Zimbabwe midfielder having a head start on him, the Everton centre-back caught him up to make a strong recovery tackle that had many of the home fans cheering and on their feet. Soon afterwards, one highly-experienced member of the Merseyside press pack told a colleague that he believes Branthwaite is going to be a really top defender and given his assured displays at such tender years, there’s a feel of about him. Going further back, the way the Cumbrian used his pace to get back and make the challenge, there were even shades of another left-sided centre-back, Everton’s most-successful captain Kevin Ratcliffe, but given his size and strength, Branthwaite has the potential to be even more of a colossus than either of that highly-decorated pair. The only real glimmer of hope that loyal but long-suffering Evertonians can take from this game is that netted his third goal in as many matches for what was his team’s first strike at Goodison Park this season, ending a drought stretching back to May 28 when registered in spectacular fashion to avoid what would have been the club’s first relegation in 72 years. However, even this moment of relief was tempered by an agonising wait for what seemed like an eternity with an even longer than usual VAR review by Wigan-based official Paul Tierney down in London at Stockley Park. There was so much going on in the goalmouth scramble with Luton’s Reece Burke appearing to tug jersey then Doucoure and Calvert-Lewin steaming in ahead of Burke and Amari’i Bell for the loose ball. But Anthony Taylor for once had a decision taken out of his hands – probably to the relief of many in the crowd – and pointed back toward the centre circle to award the goal. During the nervous period that the decision was being made, dozens of fans in close proximity to the press box in Goodison’s Main Stand attempted to crane their necks to try and catch a glimpse of the replays. In truth though, the screens in that area are difficult enough for even working members of the media to see and even if you do come to a conclusion to what you’re convinced you saw, there’s no guarantee the powers that be are even going to agree. Top brass from Everton’s prospective new owners, got their first taste of Goodison Park with the Miami-based private investment firm’s co-founders and Steve Pasko both attending the game alongside Don Dransfield, CEO of 777’s football group. Americans Wander and Pasko stood out in the directors’ box as they both sported baseball caps but while Pasko, the older of the pair, kept out the chill on a wet weekend in Walton with a cardigan and scarf underneath his jacket, Wander did make the effort to garner favour with Evertonians by sporting a royal blue tie as he took his place in the stands next to director of football . When asked when leaving whether he had enjoyed his first Goodison Park experience, Wander replied: “Except the result,” but even that had an ominous ring to it. 7+7+7= 21. Or 2-1 (to Luton!)","pubDate":"2023-10-01 10:51:48","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27820842.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1709880274.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","source_priority":3400,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a9bd0e19a8d919069ea593bd20f30417","title":"VAR officials replaced after offside error in Liverpool defeat","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/epl/liverpool-vs-tottenham-var-controversey-referees-darren-england-dan-cook-replaced-two-matches/article67368860.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Liverpool went down to nine men as Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota were sent off in the feisty clash, before an own goal by Joel Matip sealed a stoppage-time win for Spurs.","content":"Video Assistant Referee (VAR) officials Darren England and Dan Cook have been replaced for two games this matchweek after Liverpool wrongly had a goal disallowed in its 2-1 Premier League defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Liverpool went down to nine men as Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota were sent off in the feisty clash before an own goal by Joel Matip sealed a stoppage-time win for Spurs. The Merseyside club thought it had taken the lead in the first half through Luis Diaz who got behind the defence and fired into the bottom corner past goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. However, the goal was ruled out by the referee for offside. The referees’ body, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), later admitted it was the wrong decision to disallow Diaz’s effort, blaming human error, and “should have resulted in the goal being awarded through VAR intervention”. In a statement on Sunday, the PGMOL said: “Darren England, VAR on the Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool fixture, and Dan Cook, (assistant VAR) on the same game, have been replaced for the Nottingham Forest v Brentford and Fulham v Chelsea matches today and tomorrow night respectively. “Craig Pawson will now assume England’s duties as fourth official at the City Ground while Eddie Smart will take over from Cook as assistant referee at Craven Cottage.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2023-10-01 10:45:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bd4abec705c3632d638e136dd7ba6c67","title":"Josh Wander delivers three-word Everton verdict after Goodison Park visit","link":"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/josh-wander-three-word-message-27819383","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"777 Partners co-founders Josh Wander and Steve Pasko watched on as Everton were defeated at home by Luton Town","content":"Prospective Everton buyer Josh Wander responded with a three-word answer when asked if he enjoyed his first match at Goodison Park.

England’s triumphant World Cup (in the Italia 90 sense) and the rapid growth of women’s football makes this the most keenly anticipated season of all. We’ll be covering all six games in a special, marathon, pressure-sore-inducing opening-day clockwatch. The most intriguing is probably at Villa Park, where Aston Villa, easily the best of the rest last season, host title-chasing Manchester United. The champions Chelsea host Spurs in the late game, Arsenal play Liverpool at the Emirates and Manchester City have a tricky trip to West Ham. Most excitingly of all, a host of star signings, from Alessia Russo to Hinata Miyazawa, should make WSL debuts for their new teams. We shouldn’t pretend that everything is brilliant – equality remains a thing of the future, and the WSL is a 12-team league in name and a four-team league in nature – but it’s probably fair to say women’s football has never been in a better state.

England was due to be the fourth official at the City Ground and Cook the assistant referee at Craven Cottage. Luis Díaz thought he had scored the opening goal at Tottenham only for a flag to go up. But rather than overrule the on-field decision, England, the VAR, called “check complete” because he had not noticed the goal had been disallowed and instead thought it had been given by the referee, Simon Hooper. The PGMOL issued an apology for the “significant human error” and for England’s lapse of concentration. Since the start of last season, the PGMOL has apologised for mistakes on 14 occasions. Jürgen Klopp was left bewildered by the disallowed goal but cut England some slack . “I am pretty sure whoever made the decision didn’t do it on purpose,” the Liverpool manager said after what was his team’s first defeat of the season. “It didn’t take extremely long to come to the conclusion. That’s a bit strange but someone else has to explain.” As with all goals, the VAR checks every element of the goal to ensure they are correct. The lines were drawn and the process was correctly followed. However, England lost focus of the initial onfield decision. PGMOL acknowledged the decision to rule out Díaz’s 34th-minute goal was a “clear and obvious factual error”. The error is another mortifying episode in a difficult season for PGMOL and its implementation of VAR. The first weekend of the season was marred by the match officials failing to award Wolves a stoppage-time penalty, leading to Hooper, also the referee that day, Michael Salisbury, the VAR, and Richard West, the AVAR, being dropped from duty for the following round of matches . Howard Webb, the chief refereeing officer at PGMOL, has stressed referees must be accountable for their decisions in bid to make the organisation and its working practices more transparent and understood. However, this latest error will further and severely test the credibility of all involved. Speaking on Sky Sports after Saturday’s game, Gary Neville said of the Díaz decision: “That is unbelievable. That is a bad one. They said [in the statement], ‘significant’. That is very significant.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
