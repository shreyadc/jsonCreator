They have conceded 20 goals.Football commentator Zhan Jun said Branko Ivankovic’s men lost “due to lack of experience, lack of ability and poor handling of details”.The Croatian coach’s tactics were “not suitable for the team” and put too much pressure on defensive midfielder Wang Shangyuan, Zhan wrote on the Weibo social media site.Veteran pundit Ji Yuyang complained that Ivankovic’s leadership had let the team down and that the coach was “not as good as several of his predecessors”.“In their group the Chinese team lost the most games and conceded the most goals,“ Ji noted on Weibo.China's long-suffering fans vented online.One said that “these national players simply don’t realise that the point of football is to kick the ball into the opponents’ goal”.“They only know how to stupidly chase the ball!”The national team has long been the butt of jokes and a target of derision in China both for its poor record and corruption in the sport.“The last time the national team made it to the World Cup, I was in year six of primary school,“ wrote another online.“We might be able to make it by the time my grandchildren are in sixth grade.”Chinese people “have long been emotionally prepared to be eliminated (from the World Cup),“ one supporter said on Weibo.“No matter how crappy you are, we will not give up our World Cup dream!”The national team play again on Tuesday in the southwestern city of Chongqing in what is now a deadrubber against similarly eliminated Bahrain. – AFP","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-06 05:02:17","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://thesun.my/news-portlet/img/ogimage_default.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_my","source_name":"Thesun","source_priority":81564,"source_url":"https://thesun.my","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/thesun_my.png","language":"english","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"efc06a899f3f3530b12d68fc751e4c2c","title":"The £60 pills that will give England an edge at the World Cup","link":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/60-pills-england-edge-world-050200667.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["The Telegraph"],"description":"Of all the items handed out to England players this week – from match shirts to personalised legacy number caps to training bibs – they can be sure that there is one which the Football Association staff will not be asking them to give back.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-06 05:02:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/E.4YCoovloauCsg7fSgx.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/fd857c00fa6fcda843496859ec0c2c74","video_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","source_name":"Yahoo!

Just his name stands out — I have limitless admiration for him.“It’s really great to see a player at his age to keep playing and be as fit as he is. I admire him very much.”Mikel Merino, another Spanish goalscorer on Thursday, was confident.“It’s not our first final,” he said.“Munich brings us amazing memories from the European Championship.“I’m very happy to be in another final is a huge accomplishment and hopefully we can win it again.”","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-06
