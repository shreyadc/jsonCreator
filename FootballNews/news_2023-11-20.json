The Ineos chief, 71, has struck an agreement with the Glazer family to acquire 25 per cent of his boyhood club; a deal which will bring a taxing year-long process to an end. The terms of the £1.3billion proposal will give Ratcliffe control of United's sporting operations. Ratcliffe is expected to make significant changes once he is in power and chief executive Richard Arnold has already confirmed he will be leaving the club in December. His replacement and a new sporting director are expected to be confirmed in due course by Ratcliffe, who has held further talks with United co-owner Joel Glazer.

The report goes on to outline that Ineos is particularly dismayed with the club's current departmental strategies, although it remains to be seen if these are areas of the business which Ratcliffe has already earmarked for change. Mirror Football outlined last week that football director John Murtough is set to be the next executive to depart the club as part of Ratcliffe's shake-up, while director of football operations David Harrison is also expected to move on imminently. Join the debate! Would you like Ratcliffe to be more hands-on than the Glazers? Let us know here. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is closing in on a deal for 25 per cent stake of Manchester United ( Image: Getty Images) It seems likely that Ratcliffe will be far more hands-on with his approach than the club's current regime as he implements plans to install several of his own people within the Old Trafford hierarchy. The Glazers have taken a backseat since acquiring the Premier League giants in a leveraged buyout back in 2005 but Ratcliffe has designs on running the club in a completely different way. That much is clear from insight provided by Francesco Farioli: the head coach of the French club Ratcliffe and Ineos already own, OGC Nice. In an interview with The Telegraph, he detailed how he has regular contact with Ratcliffe but is free to do things his own way on the pitch - a huge contrast with how Manchester United is currently run. \"I met Jim Ratcliffe a few days after (taking the job) because he was very busy,\" Farioli explains. \"But from his side, the first time we met, the feeling he transferred to me, it was really like the feeling of somebody that was really aware of many things.

His Argentina team were bested by Nunez's Uruguay on Friday, with the Reds striker grabbing the second goal in a 2-0 win to hand the world champions their first defeat since losing to Saudi Arabia in Qatar a year ago. Speaking ahead of his country's mammoth World Cup qualifier with Brazil on Wednesday, Messi said Uruguay fully deserved to win and commended Nunez for being at the centre of their success. \"Uruguay are good at rebounding and playing in space on counter attack,\" the 36-year-old said. \"They have excellent players for that like Darwin [Nunez].\" Liverpool supporters on social media reckoned Messi's comments were proof that their No. 9, who has struggled for form and goals since arriving from Benfica in 2022, will eventually come good. \"Messi backs Nunez! There's no way he doesn't become a top level striker with all his talents,\" one fan wrote on X. \"Messi knows ball,\" said another. A third declared: \"No doubt in my mind Nunez will make it at Liverpool. Even Messi knows he's a great player,\" while a fourth beamed: \"Nunez gets the Messi seal of approval, and soon, the rest of the world's!\" Nunez, 24, has scored roughly a goal every three games at Anfield since arriving from Benfica, but his year-and-a-half stint at the club has been underwhelming considering his hefty price tag (£85million). He's been in decent form so far this campaign and looks to have shaken off some of his first season jitters, but whether he'll ever be consistent enough to lead the line for Liverpool long-term is another question.

The Reds endured a major overhaul in the middle of the park - some players leaving when their contracts weren't renewed with others departing unexpectedly after lucrative offers were tabled from Saudi Arabia. Fabinho and Jordan Henderson opted for switches to the Middle East. However, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain left and have since found new homes in Germany and Turkey respectively.

Oxlade-Chamberlain meanwhile was hampered by injury throughout his time at Anfield. Arthur struggled for minutes throughout his spell with the Reds, playing with the club's U21s as he too battled injury problems. The Brazilian has seen his career stall since leaving Barcelona, where he was highly thought of as having arrived in Europe as an unknown quantity. Liverpool's profile also has them listing Fabio Carvalho as a midfielder despite the young Portuguese star heading out on loan for the year. He found opportunities hard to come by last term having arrived from Fulham. Carvalho is now trying to further his development with RB Leipzig. Liverpool waved goodbye to several major names in the summer ( Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images) The squad list does include several other defensive loan departures. The likes of Calvin Ramsay and Rhys Williams both headed elsewhere in search of more minutes. However other temporary exits like Nathaniel Phillips, who headed to Celtic, have been taken off the squad list. Other Liverpool departures, like James Milner, are not listed as part of their squad following his move to Brighton in the summer. After the raft of exits, Liverpool were bolstered by the arrivals of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Wataru Endo. Join our new WhatsApp community!

The French defender, now playing for Lorient, was acquitted of all charges brought against him earlier this year.

Mendy joined the club in 2017 from Monaco in a deal worth £52m and won the Premier League title on three occasions at the club. In August the high court heard that HM Revenue and Customs was seeking a bankruptcy order against the full back over a tax debt of nearly £800,000. However an accountant on behalf of Mendy, who did not attend the hearing, told the court that the footballer was “in negotiations with Manchester City to get the back pay on the basis that he has been found not guilty.\" The accountant, who would not give his full name to media, said that the full sum Mendy was looking to be paid was \"£9-10m gross.\" “He himself has moved back to France where he comes from,” the accountant said. “I would like to ask for a short extension because I am told very firmly by his agent that the pay issue will be resolved from Manchester City. He was very short of money indeed, the cost of the legal case were over £1m.” Benjamin Mendy in action for Lorient against Monaco in September. ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) The accountant also said that Mendy was selling his Cheshire mansion with a listed price of £5m. Judge Clive Jones told August's hearing that Mendy’s HMRC debt was £788,409. Criticising Mendy, the judge said: “I’m very unimpressed at the lack of information that’s been provided both to HMRC and to the court prior to this hearing. That, I really think, is the wrong step for him to take,” he said, adding that Mendy must attend any further hearing or be legally represented.\" Mendy has made three substitute appearances for new club Lorient having signed a deal with the Ligue 1 outfit shortly after his acquittal in a retrial at Chester crown court.

The NFL star, a two-time Super Bowl winner, has encountered a whole new level of fame since he started dating Swift this year, with things turning official when she turned up at Arrowhead Stadium for the first time to cheer him on in late September. Speaking to the Wall Street Journa l magazine , Kelce revealed that someone in Swift's team helped set them up after he opened up on his failed attempt to give her his number after her Eras show in Kansas City. 'There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: Yo! Did you know he was coming? I had somebody playing Cupid,' Kelce said. It didn't take long for them to arrange a first date but even for Kelce, who usually exudes confidence on the football field, there were some nerves. NFL star Travis Kelce has opened up on his whirlwind romance with Taylor Swift Kelce, who usually exudes confidence on the field, admitted to having first date nerves Kelce describes Swift as 'hilarious' and 'a genius' - saying her intellect is 'f***ing mind-blowing' Kelce describes the build-up as 'Everybody around me telling me 'don't f*** this up' and me sitting here saying 'yeah, got it' 'When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there.' He said he was worried about making a mis-step in those early days: 'That was the biggest thing to me: make sure I don't say anything that would push Taylor away.' But they clearly hit it off and Kelce describes Swift as 'hilarious' and a 'genius'. 'Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day,' he said. Kelce also said that he and Taylor sang 'Teenage Dirtbag' together at a late night party at his house in Kansas City. 'There was some wine involved, for sure,' he said. Kelce also admitted that Swift's fame has inevitably had an impact on his own life. Kelce is happy to deal with the extra attention that comes with dating someone like Swift Kelce admitted he had friends joking at him 'not to f*** this up' before his first date with Taylor Kelce and Swift's families could be spending Thanksgiving together in Kansas City 'Obviously I've never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I've never dealt with it,' Kelce says. 'But at the same time, I'm not running away from any of it. 'The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she's just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.' Tonight, Kelce's parents are expected to meet Taylor's for the first time as he plays for the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles - the team Swift and her dad support. Taylor has met Travis's mom Donna and father Ed - the first time she was at a Chiefs game, she was alongside Donna in the family suite. Soon after, Donna was on the TODAY show and asked about her son's relationship with Swift when, in an effort to downplay the attention, simply said watching a game with her was 'OK'. As the internet questioned if she was really a fan of Taylor, Travis called her to tell her she had done a great job on her television appearance. Taylor will not be there - a rescheduled Eras date in Brazil prevents her from making it to Kansas City for the game. But reports on Monday morning suggested that both sets of families will spend Thanksgiving together in Kansas City.

The pendulum has seemingly swung the way of the Argentinian in the past 12 months, inspiring his country to a World Cup win in Qatar and picking up an unprecedented eighth Ballon d'Or crown. And yet, despite now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo's record-breaking exploits continue, with his tally of 128 international goals putting him 22 ahead of his rival. And it's not just fans divided over the debate, but legendary players as well. Indeed, Steven Gerrard has now weighed into the debate, even if his views seem to have altered somewhat since joining CR7 in the Middle East... Best Football Betting Sites in September 2023 according to Oddschecker Roy Keane challenged to £1m boxing fight by ex-Liverpool star in Eddie Hearn plea Steven Gerrard Gerrard previously implied to Gary Neville on the Overlap YouTube channel that Messi held the edge over Ronaldo, but coincidentally, that view has altered since he began work in Saudi Arabia. \"The arrival of ‘The GOAT’ as we call him, Cristiano, him arriving in January obviously was a huge signing,\" Gerrard told the Saudi Pro League. \"He still had a lot of football to offer. \"So, from afar, for six months, I was looking in at Cristiano Ronaldo's results, at the league, watching some games and watching some highlights. I think from that moment, the league around the world had become a very popular talking point for everyone. After Cristiano’s arrival, even more, big-name signings, talents and skill sets were joining the league.\" HAVE YOUR SAY! Is the GOAT Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? Comment below . Steven Gerrard changed his mind on Cristiano Ronaldo ( Image: Franco Romano/NurPhoto) Gary Lineker While many pundits are torn over the debate, Gary Lineker had never been in any doubt, long labelling Messi the greatest player to have ever laced up a pair of boots. \"He's just phenomenal,\" Lineker previously told talkSPORT. \"He's 31 now and he's still going strong. He plays the game in a way the rest of us are not familiar with. I watch a lot of football, and people pine on this whole Messi vs Ronaldo debate; there's no comparison for me. Messi is on a different level to everybody else, it's as simple as that. \"People say to me what about Ronaldo's goalscoring record and so forth? But I say to them have you seen Messi pass a football? Have you seen him dribble towards goal?\" Gary Lineker is a huge fan of Lionel Messi ( Image: Twitter) Ronaldinho Ronaldinho was in his prime at Barcelona when a teenage Messi was rising to prominence. The Brazilian playmaker wowed at the Nou Camp before leaving in 2008, and Messi duly picked up the mantle. And Ronaldinho is another in no doubt as to where he stands on the GOAT argument. \"Messi,\" he previously said, via Goal: I would have loved to continue playing alongside him. I didn't get enough time with him, he was very young. I'd love to take to the pitch with him one more time.\" Lionel Messi celebrates with Ronaldinho back in 2006 Frank Lampard Like his old England midfield colleague, Lampard was initially quoted as favouring Messi in the debate. And also like Gerrard, he later changed his mind Speaking to The Overlap in 2021, the Chelsea legend argued that Ronaldo's tendency to deliver on the big occasion had swayed his thinking. Worth noting his comments came before Messi and co tasted glory in Qatar though. \"I actually think for Ronaldo's output and actual numbers, and goals in big finals and semi-finals like we've seen, I think I maybe give him the edge,\" he said. \"That's going to start a load of hate, now!\" Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard both scored in the 2008 Champions League final Michael Owen Perhaps unsurprisingly for a former striker, Michael Owen has been swayed by goal stats. And Ronaldo's prolific record, which included a record 140 Champions League goals, has persuaded Owen to opt for the Portuguese star: \"Goalscoring is the hardest art in football and [Ronaldo] makes it look so easy,\" he said on BT Sport. \"Head, left foot, right foot.

I think Messi is outstanding in certain attributes but as an all-round physique, Ronaldo is such an all-around player.\" David Beckham Long before David Beckham signed Lionel Messi for Inter Miami, he'd made his stance on the debate very clear. Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi holds the Ballon d'Or award \"They have similarities in their technical skills and talent, and it is amazing for football to have them both present, but Messi is simply the best player in the world,\" he once said. \"He [Messi] is alone in his class as a player, it is impossible that there is another like him.

Ferguson, 19, signed an improved five-year deal with Brighton earlier this month, having emerged as one of the Premier League's brightest prospects since his top-flight debut in February 2022. Clubs often insert eye-watering release clauses into their best young players' contracts but the Seagulls opted against doing so in the case of Ferguson, leaving United in the dark regarding his true valuation. This allows Brighton to demand as much as they want for Ferguson, whose five league goals this season have only seen his stock rise. The Republic of Ireland international was tipped to join United during the summer transfer window before the Red Devils splurged £72million on highly-rated Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund , who himself is only 20. Ex-Man Utd scout furiously confronted club chiefs over Glazers' two transfer mistakes Amazon's music deal could convince you to drop Spotify and Apple Music Should United rekindle their interest in Ferguson, Brighton will undoubtedly drive a hard bargain, as demonstrated by the lucrative sales of ex-Seagulls stars Moises Caicedo , Ben White , Marc Cucurella and Alexis Mac Allister . The Athletic report that isn't a set figure which Brighton chiefs would have to accept should a club come in for their 19-year-old hotshot. Arsenal and Liverpool are among the sides who've also been linked with a big-money move for Ferguson, whose grand-uncle Damien notably played for the Red Devils in the 1970s. \"I supported United as a boy,\" the Irish starlet revealed to the Daily Mail . \"You had the [Wayne] Rooneys , the [Dimitar] Berbatovs and obviously [Brighton team-mate] Danny Welbeck . They've always had a good thing going with the striker.\" Get involved! Should Manchester United attempt to sign Evan Ferguson? Let us know your stance in the comments section . Evan Ferguson doesn't have a release clause in his Brighton contract ( Image: Alex Broadway/Getty Images) Ferguson, who recently became the first teenager since Rooney in 2005 to score at least 10 Premier League goals in a calendar year, has even been tipped to complete a \"dream\" move to United or Liverpool by ex-Ireland defender Richard Dunne . Speaking to BoyleSports , Dunne explained: \"I'm sure Evan Ferguson would be delighted at the thought of playing for Liverpool and Manchester United as most Irish boys would dream of that. \"I think it'll happen for him in the future, but he's still learning his trade at the moment at Brighton. He's in for some games, rested for others, and is still developing as a player. I'm sure Brighton will help him move on when he feels the time is right.

The Ineos chief, 71, has struck an agreement with the Glazer family to acquire 25 per cent of his boyhood club; a deal which will bring a taxing year-long process to an end. The terms of the £1.3billion proposal will give Ratcliffe control of United's sporting operations. Ratcliffe is expected to make significant changes once he is in power and chief executive Richard Arnold has already confirmed he will be leaving the club in December. His replacement and a new sporting director are expected to be confirmed in due course by Ratcliffe, who has held further talks with United co-owner Joel Glazer. Amazon's music deal could convince you to drop Spotify and Apple Music Man Utd suffer Evan Ferguson transfer blow as Brighton contract details emerge However, according to a new report from The Manchester Evening News, Ratcliffe has been left 'unimpressed' after learning more about how the club operates under the Glazers during a number of virtual meetings with Joel. The report goes on to outline that Ineos is particularly dismayed with the club's current departmental strategies, although it remains to be seen if these are areas of the business which Ratcliffe has already earmarked for change. Mirror Football outlined last week that football director John Murtough is set to be the next executive to depart the club as part of Ratcliffe's shake-up, while director of football operations David Harrison is also expected to move on imminently. Join the debate! Would you like Ratcliffe to be more hands-on than the Glazers? Let us know here. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is closing in on a deal for 25 per cent stake of Manchester United ( Image: Getty Images) It seems likely that Ratcliffe will be far more hands-on with his approach than the club's current regime as he implements plans to install several of his own people within the Old Trafford hierarchy. The Glazers have taken a backseat since acquiring the Premier League giants in a leveraged buyout back in 2005 but Ratcliffe has designs on running the club in a completely different way. That much is clear from insight provided by Francesco Farioli: the head coach of the French club Ratcliffe and Ineos already own, OGC Nice. In an interview with The Telegraph, he detailed how he has regular contact with Ratcliffe but is free to do things his own way on the pitch - a huge contrast with how Manchester United is currently run. \"I met Jim Ratcliffe a few days after (taking the job) because he was very busy,\" Farioli explains. \"But from his side, the first time we met, the feeling he transferred to me, it was really like the feeling of somebody that was really aware of many things.

His Argentina team were bested by Nunez's Uruguay on Friday, with the Reds striker grabbing the second goal in a 2-0 win to hand the world champions their first defeat since losing to Saudi Arabia in Qatar a year ago. Speaking ahead of his country's mammoth World Cup qualifier with Brazil on Wednesday, Messi said Uruguay fully deserved to win and commended Nunez for being at the centre of their success. \"Uruguay are good at rebounding and playing in space on counter attack,\" the 36-year-old said. \"They have excellent players for that like Darwin [Nunez].\" Liverpool supporters on social media reckoned Messi's comments were proof that their No. 9, who has struggled for form and goals since arriving from Benfica in 2022, will eventually come good. \"Messi backs Nunez! There's no way he doesn't become a top level striker with all his talents,\" one fan wrote on X. \"Messi knows ball,\" said another. A third declared: \"No doubt in my mind Nunez will make it at Liverpool. Even Messi knows he's a great player,\" while a fourth beamed: \"Nunez gets the Messi seal of approval, and soon, the rest of the world's!\" Nunez, 24, has scored roughly a goal every three games at Anfield since arriving from Benfica, but his year-and-a-half stint at the club has been underwhelming considering his hefty price tag (£85million). He's been in decent form so far this campaign and looks to have shaken off some of his first season jitters, but whether he'll ever be consistent enough to lead the line for Liverpool long-term is another question.

The Reds endured a major overhaul in the middle of the park - some players leaving when their contracts weren't renewed with others departing unexpectedly after lucrative offers were tabled from Saudi Arabia. Fabinho and Jordan Henderson opted for switches to the Middle East. However, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain left and have since found new homes in Germany and Turkey respectively. Arthur, a loan signing last summer from Juventus, also departed when his deal ended but all three remain on the club's Premier League profile. Egypt chief explains why Salah targeted by pitch invaders in \"worried\" admission Liverpool have signed \"Lionel Messi at his best\" this season as incredible impact hailed Keita was a big-money signing back in 2018 and is arguably the only major acquisition of the Jurgen Klopp era who failed to hit the heights expected. Oxlade-Chamberlain meanwhile was hampered by injury throughout his time at Anfield. Arthur struggled for minutes throughout his spell with the Reds, playing with the club's U21s as he too battled injury problems. The Brazilian has seen his career stall since leaving Barcelona, where he was highly thought of as having arrived in Europe as an unknown quantity. Liverpool's profile also has them listing Fabio Carvalho as a midfielder despite the young Portuguese star heading out on loan for the year. He found opportunities hard to come by last term having arrived from Fulham. Carvalho is now trying to further his development with RB Leipzig. Liverpool waved goodbye to several major names in the summer ( Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images) The squad list does include several other defensive loan departures. The likes of Calvin Ramsay and Rhys Williams both headed elsewhere in search of more minutes. However other temporary exits like Nathaniel Phillips, who headed to Celtic, have been taken off the squad list. Other Liverpool departures, like James Milner, are not listed as part of their squad following his move to Brighton in the summer. After the raft of exits, Liverpool were bolstered by the arrivals of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Wataru Endo. Join our new WhatsApp community!

The French defender, now playing for Lorient, was acquitted of all charges brought against him earlier this year. And Mendy, 29, has now filed a complaint with an employment tribunal with regards to \"unauthorised deductions from wages\" after he was charged with rape and sexual assault in 2021. He left City when his contract expired at the end of June this year. He is being represented in the action by Nick De Marco KC and a statement confirming the proceedings said: \"Manchester City FC failed to pay Mr Mendy any wages at all from September 2021, following Mr Mendy being charged with various offence all of which he was subsequently acquitted of, until the end of his contract in June 2023. The claim will come before an Employment Tribunal.\" Mendy was found not guilty of six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault at the conclusion of an initial trial in January and he was then acquitted of two remaining charges in a retrial at Chester crown court in June.

Mendy joined the club in 2017 from Monaco in a deal worth £52m and won the Premier League title on three occasions at the club. In August the high court heard that HM Revenue and Customs was seeking a bankruptcy order against the full back over a tax debt of nearly £800,000. However an accountant on behalf of Mendy, who did not attend the hearing, told the court that the footballer was “in negotiations with Manchester City to get the back pay on the basis that he has been found not guilty.\" The accountant, who would not give his full name to media, said that the full sum Mendy was looking to be paid was \"£9-10m gross.\" “He himself has moved back to France where he comes from,” the accountant said. “I would like to ask for a short extension because I am told very firmly by his agent that the pay issue will be resolved from Manchester City. He was very short of money indeed, the cost of the legal case were over £1m.” Benjamin Mendy in action for Lorient against Monaco in September. ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) The accountant also said that Mendy was selling his Cheshire mansion with a listed price of £5m. Judge Clive Jones told August's hearing that Mendy’s HMRC debt was £788,409. Criticising Mendy, the judge said: “I’m very unimpressed at the lack of information that’s been provided both to HMRC and to the court prior to this hearing. That, I really think, is the wrong step for him to take,” he said, adding that Mendy must attend any further hearing or be legally represented.\" Mendy has made three substitute appearances for new club Lorient having signed a deal with the Ligue 1 outfit shortly after his acquittal in a retrial at Chester crown court.

The NFL star, a two-time Super Bowl winner, has encountered a whole new level of fame since he started dating Swift this year, with things turning official when she turned up at Arrowhead Stadium for the first time to cheer him on in late September. Speaking to the Wall Street Journa l magazine , Kelce revealed that someone in Swift's team helped set them up after he opened up on his failed attempt to give her his number after her Eras show in Kansas City. 'There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: Yo! Did you know he was coming? I had somebody playing Cupid,' Kelce said. It didn't take long for them to arrange a first date but even for Kelce, who usually exudes confidence on the football field, there were some nerves. NFL star Travis Kelce has opened up on his whirlwind romance with Taylor Swift Kelce, who usually exudes confidence on the field, admitted to having first date nerves Kelce describes Swift as 'hilarious' and 'a genius' - saying her intellect is 'f***ing mind-blowing' Kelce describes the build-up as 'Everybody around me telling me 'don't f*** this up' and me sitting here saying 'yeah, got it' 'When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there.' He said he was worried about making a mis-step in those early days: 'That was the biggest thing to me: make sure I don't say anything that would push Taylor away.' But they clearly hit it off and Kelce describes Swift as 'hilarious' and a 'genius'. 'Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day,' he said. Kelce also said that he and Taylor sang 'Teenage Dirtbag' together at a late night party at his house in Kansas City. 'There was some wine involved, for sure,' he said. Kelce also admitted that Swift's fame has inevitably had an impact on his own life. Kelce is happy to deal with the extra attention that comes with dating someone like Swift Kelce admitted he had friends joking at him 'not to f*** this up' before his first date with Taylor Kelce and Swift's families could be spending Thanksgiving together in Kansas City 'Obviously I've never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I've never dealt with it,' Kelce says. 'But at the same time, I'm not running away from any of it. 'The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she's just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.' Tonight, Kelce's parents are expected to meet Taylor's for the first time as he plays for the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles - the team Swift and her dad support. Taylor has met Travis's mom Donna and father Ed - the first time she was at a Chiefs game, she was alongside Donna in the family suite. Soon after, Donna was on the TODAY show and asked about her son's relationship with Swift when, in an effort to downplay the attention, simply said watching a game with her was 'OK'. As the internet questioned if she was really a fan of Taylor, Travis called her to tell her she had done a great job on her television appearance. Taylor will not be there - a rescheduled Eras date in Brazil prevents her from making it to Kansas City for the game. But reports on Monday morning suggested that both sets of families will spend Thanksgiving together in Kansas City.

The pendulum has seemingly swung the way of the Argentinian in the past 12 months, inspiring his country to a World Cup win in Qatar and picking up an unprecedented eighth Ballon d'Or crown. And yet, despite now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo's record-breaking exploits continue, with his tally of 128 international goals putting him 22 ahead of his rival. And it's not just fans divided over the debate, but legendary players as well. Indeed, Steven Gerrard has now weighed into the debate, even if his views seem to have altered somewhat since joining CR7 in the Middle East... Best Football Betting Sites in September 2023 according to Oddschecker Roy Keane challenged to £1m boxing fight by ex-Liverpool star in Eddie Hearn plea Steven Gerrard Gerrard previously implied to Gary Neville on the Overlap YouTube channel that Messi held the edge over Ronaldo, but coincidentally, that view has altered since he began work in Saudi Arabia. \"The arrival of ‘The GOAT’ as we call him, Cristiano, him arriving in January obviously was a huge signing,\" Gerrard told the Saudi Pro League. \"He still had a lot of football to offer. \"So, from afar, for six months, I was looking in at Cristiano Ronaldo's results, at the league, watching some games and watching some highlights. I think from that moment, the league around the world had become a very popular talking point for everyone. After Cristiano’s arrival, even more, big-name signings, talents and skill sets were joining the league.\" HAVE YOUR SAY! Is the GOAT Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? Comment below . Steven Gerrard changed his mind on Cristiano Ronaldo ( Image: Franco Romano/NurPhoto) Gary Lineker While many pundits are torn over the debate, Gary Lineker had never been in any doubt, long labelling Messi the greatest player to have ever laced up a pair of boots. \"He's just phenomenal,\" Lineker previously told talkSPORT. \"He's 31 now and he's still going strong. He plays the game in a way the rest of us are not familiar with. I watch a lot of football, and people pine on this whole Messi vs Ronaldo debate; there's no comparison for me. Messi is on a different level to everybody else, it's as simple as that. \"People say to me what about Ronaldo's goalscoring record and so forth? But I say to them have you seen Messi pass a football? Have you seen him dribble towards goal?\" Gary Lineker is a huge fan of Lionel Messi ( Image: Twitter) Ronaldinho Ronaldinho was in his prime at Barcelona when a teenage Messi was rising to prominence. The Brazilian playmaker wowed at the Nou Camp before leaving in 2008, and Messi duly picked up the mantle. And Ronaldinho is another in no doubt as to where he stands on the GOAT argument. \"Messi,\" he previously said, via Goal: I would have loved to continue playing alongside him. I didn't get enough time with him, he was very young. I'd love to take to the pitch with him one more time.\" Lionel Messi celebrates with Ronaldinho back in 2006 Frank Lampard Like his old England midfield colleague, Lampard was initially quoted as favouring Messi in the debate. And also like Gerrard, he later changed his mind Speaking to The Overlap in 2021, the Chelsea legend argued that Ronaldo's tendency to deliver on the big occasion had swayed his thinking. Worth noting his comments came before Messi and co tasted glory in Qatar though. \"I actually think for Ronaldo's output and actual numbers, and goals in big finals and semi-finals like we've seen, I think I maybe give him the edge,\" he said. \"That's going to start a load of hate, now!\" Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard both scored in the 2008 Champions League final Michael Owen Perhaps unsurprisingly for a former striker, Michael Owen has been swayed by goal stats. And Ronaldo's prolific record, which included a record 140 Champions League goals, has persuaded Owen to opt for the Portuguese star: \"Goalscoring is the hardest art in football and [Ronaldo] makes it look so easy,\" he said on BT Sport. \"Head, left foot, right foot.

Ferguson, 19, signed an improved five-year deal with Brighton earlier this month, having emerged as one of the Premier League's brightest prospects since his top-flight debut in February 2022. Clubs often insert eye-watering release clauses into their best young players' contracts but the Seagulls opted against doing so in the case of Ferguson, leaving United in the dark regarding his true valuation. This allows Brighton to demand as much as they want for Ferguson, whose five league goals this season have only seen his stock rise. The Republic of Ireland international was tipped to join United during the summer transfer window before the Red Devils splurged £72million on highly-rated Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund , who himself is only 20. Ex-Man Utd scout furiously confronted club chiefs over Glazers' two transfer mistakes Amazon's music deal could convince you to drop Spotify and Apple Music Should United rekindle their interest in Ferguson, Brighton will undoubtedly drive a hard bargain, as demonstrated by the lucrative sales of ex-Seagulls stars Moises Caicedo , Ben White , Marc Cucurella and Alexis Mac Allister . The Athletic report that isn't a set figure which Brighton chiefs would have to accept should a club come in for their 19-year-old hotshot. Arsenal and Liverpool are among the sides who've also been linked with a big-money move for Ferguson, whose grand-uncle Damien notably played for the Red Devils in the 1970s. \"I supported United as a boy,\" the Irish starlet revealed to the Daily Mail . \"You had the [Wayne] Rooneys , the [Dimitar] Berbatovs and obviously [Brighton team-mate] Danny Welbeck .

Speaking to BoyleSports , Dunne explained: \"I'm sure Evan Ferguson would be delighted at the thought of playing for Liverpool and Manchester United as most Irish boys would dream of that. \"I think it'll happen for him in the future, but he's still learning his trade at the moment at Brighton.

The Ineos chief, 71, has struck an agreement with the Glazer family to acquire 25 per cent of his boyhood club; a deal which will bring a taxing year-long process to an end. The terms of the £1.3billion proposal will give Ratcliffe control of United's sporting operations. Ratcliffe is expected to make significant changes once he is in power and chief executive Richard Arnold has already confirmed he will be leaving the club in December. His replacement and a new sporting director are expected to be confirmed in due course by Ratcliffe, who has held further talks with United co-owner Joel Glazer.

The report goes on to outline that Ineos is particularly dismayed with the club's current departmental strategies, although it remains to be seen if these are areas of the business which Ratcliffe has already earmarked for change. Mirror Football outlined last week that football director John Murtough is set to be the next executive to depart the club as part of Ratcliffe's shake-up, while director of football operations David Harrison is also expected to move on imminently.

The Glazers have taken a backseat since acquiring the Premier League giants in a leveraged buyout back in 2005 but Ratcliffe has designs on running the club in a completely different way. That much is clear from insight provided by Francesco Farioli: the head coach of the French club Ratcliffe and Ineos already own, OGC Nice. In an interview with The Telegraph, he detailed how he has regular contact with Ratcliffe but is free to do things his own way on the pitch - a huge contrast with how Manchester United is currently run. \"I met Jim Ratcliffe a few days after (taking the job) because he was very busy,\" Farioli explains. \"But from his side, the first time we met, the feeling he transferred to me, it was really like the feeling of somebody that was really aware of many things.

There's no way he doesn't become a top level striker with all his talents,\" one fan wrote on X. \"Messi knows ball,\" said another.

Fabinho and Jordan Henderson opted for switches to the Middle East. However, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain left and have since found new homes in Germany and Turkey respectively.

Oxlade-Chamberlain meanwhile was hampered by injury throughout his time at Anfield. Arthur struggled for minutes throughout his spell with the Reds, playing with the club's U21s as he too battled injury problems. The Brazilian has seen his career stall since leaving Barcelona, where he was highly thought of as having arrived in Europe as an unknown quantity.

However other temporary exits like Nathaniel Phillips, who headed to Celtic, have been taken off the squad list. Other Liverpool departures, like James Milner, are not listed as part of their squad following his move to Brighton in the summer.

Mendy joined the club in 2017 from Monaco in a deal worth £52m and won the Premier League title on three occasions at the club. In August the high court heard that HM Revenue and Customs was seeking a bankruptcy order against the full back over a tax debt of nearly £800,000. However an accountant on behalf of Mendy, who did not attend the hearing, told the court that the footballer was “in negotiations with Manchester City to get the back pay on the basis that he has been found not guilty.\" The accountant, who would not give his full name to media, said that the full sum Mendy was looking to be paid was \"£9-10m gross.\" “He himself has moved back to France where he comes from,” the accountant said. “I would like to ask for a short extension because I am told very firmly by his agent that the pay issue will be resolved from Manchester City. He was very short of money indeed, the cost of the legal case were over £1m.” Benjamin Mendy in action for Lorient against Monaco in September.

Judge Clive Jones told August's hearing that Mendy’s HMRC debt was £788,409. Criticising Mendy, the judge said: “I’m very unimpressed at the lack of information that’s been provided both to HMRC and to the court prior to this hearing. That, I really think, is the wrong step for him to take,” he said, adding that Mendy must attend any further hearing or be legally represented.\" Mendy has made three substitute appearances for new club Lorient having signed a deal with the Ligue 1 outfit shortly after his acquittal in a retrial at Chester crown court.

The NFL star, a two-time Super Bowl winner, has encountered a whole new level of fame since he started dating Swift this year, with things turning official when she turned up at Arrowhead Stadium for the first time to cheer him on in late September. Speaking to the Wall Street Journa l magazine , Kelce revealed that someone in Swift's team helped set them up after he opened up on his failed attempt to give her his number after her Eras show in Kansas City. 'There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: Yo! Did you know he was coming? I had somebody playing Cupid,' Kelce said. It didn't take long for them to arrange a first date but even for Kelce, who usually exudes confidence on the football field, there were some nerves. NFL star Travis Kelce has opened up on his whirlwind romance with Taylor Swift Kelce, who usually exudes confidence on the field, admitted to having first date nerves Kelce describes Swift as 'hilarious' and 'a genius' - saying her intellect is 'f***ing mind-blowing' Kelce describes the build-up as 'Everybody around me telling me 'don't f*** this up' and me sitting here saying 'yeah, got it' 'When I met her in New York, we had already kind of been talking, so I knew we could have a nice dinner and, like, a conversation, and what goes from there will go from there.' He said he was worried about making a mis-step in those early days: 'That was the biggest thing to me: make sure I don't say anything that would push Taylor away.' But they clearly hit it off and Kelce describes Swift as 'hilarious' and a 'genius'. 'Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day,' he said. Kelce also said that he and Taylor sang 'Teenage Dirtbag' together at a late night party at his house in Kansas City. 'There was some wine involved, for sure,' he said. Kelce also admitted that Swift's fame has inevitably had an impact on his own life. Kelce is happy to deal with the extra attention that comes with dating someone like Swift Kelce admitted he had friends joking at him 'not to f*** this up' before his first date with Taylor Kelce and Swift's families could be spending Thanksgiving together in Kansas City 'Obviously I've never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I've never dealt with it,' Kelce says. 'But at the same time, I'm not running away from any of it. 'The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she's just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.' Tonight, Kelce's parents are expected to meet Taylor's for the first time as he plays for the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles - the team Swift and her dad support. Taylor has met Travis's mom Donna and father Ed - the first time she was at a Chiefs game, she was alongside Donna in the family suite. Soon after, Donna was on the TODAY show and asked about her son's relationship with Swift when, in an effort to downplay the attention, simply said watching a game with her was 'OK'. As the internet questioned if she was really a fan of Taylor, Travis called her to tell her she had done a great job on her television appearance. Taylor will not be there - a rescheduled Eras date in Brazil prevents her from making it to Kansas City for the game. But reports on Monday morning suggested that both sets of families will spend Thanksgiving together in Kansas City.

The Premier League trio completely dominate the rankings for the best players in the English top flight, with City boasting five of the top six players in the top divisions - Mohamed Salah at No.4 giving Liverpool an entrant in that top six - while City and Liverpool boast the entire top nine, with Bukayo Saka's entry at No.10 the highest Arsenal entrant. Arsenal were one of the most improved sides in the 2022/23 Premier League season as they challenged treble winners City for the title - Mikel Arteta's men eventually falling short - and that's been reflected in the FM24 top 100 Premier League player rankings, with 16 stars from the Gunners featuring. The best of the rest is Bruno Fernandes at No.12, while Spurs forward Son Heung-min is in at No.14. That duo, and Newcastle playmaker Bruno Guimaraes, are the only players outside the Liverpool, City, Arsenal stronghold in the top 20. Mason Greenwood is among Manchester United's most 'disliked people' on FM24 EA FC 24 FC Pro Live promo – confirmed release date, leaks and what we know The top 100 Premier League players in the world ranked by FM24 Current Ability is an attribute used in Football Manager games to judge how good a player is, with each player in the game's database given a rating out of 200 for both Current Ability (CA) and Potential Ability (PA). Potential Ability is a rating given to judge how good players could become, but we've just used CA to assemble a list of the top 100 players in Football Manager 2024. De Bruyne is the best player in the Premier League on FM24, with the midfielder's CA of 190/200 also making him the best in the entire game. City teammate Haaland closely follows the Belgian, while Ederson, Salah and Bernardo Silva make up the remainder of the top five. There are some surprising rankings in the top 100, with one of the Premier League players of the season so far James Maddison ranked 62nd in the top 100, possessing the same CA as Kai Havertz. Brighton's Kauro Mitoma just about made the top 100 in 97th place.

The pendulum has seemingly swung the way of the Argentinian in the past 12 months, inspiring his country to a World Cup win in Qatar and picking up an unprecedented eighth Ballon d'Or crown. And yet, despite now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo's record-breaking exploits continue, with his tally of 128 international goals putting him 22 ahead of his rival. And it's not just fans divided over the debate, but legendary players as well. Indeed, Steven Gerrard has now weighed into the debate, even if his views seem to have altered somewhat since joining CR7 in the Middle East... Best Football Betting Sites in September 2023 according to Oddschecker Roy Keane challenged to £1m boxing fight by ex-Liverpool star in Eddie Hearn plea Steven Gerrard Gerrard previously implied to Gary Neville on the Overlap YouTube channel that Messi held the edge over Ronaldo, but coincidentally, that view has altered since he began work in Saudi Arabia. \"The arrival of ‘The GOAT’ as we call him, Cristiano, him arriving in January obviously was a huge signing,\" Gerrard told the Saudi Pro League. \"He still had a lot of football to offer. \"So, from afar, for six months, I was looking in at Cristiano Ronaldo's results, at the league, watching some games and watching some highlights. I think from that moment, the league around the world had become a very popular talking point for everyone. After Cristiano’s arrival, even more, big-name signings, talents and skill sets were joining the league.\" HAVE YOUR SAY! Is the GOAT Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? Comment below . Steven Gerrard changed his mind on Cristiano Ronaldo ( Image: Franco Romano/NurPhoto) Gary Lineker While many pundits are torn over the debate, Gary Lineker had never been in any doubt, long labelling Messi the greatest player to have ever laced up a pair of boots. \"He's just phenomenal,\" Lineker previously told talkSPORT. \"He's 31 now and he's still going strong. He plays the game in a way the rest of us are not familiar with. I watch a lot of football, and people pine on this whole Messi vs Ronaldo debate; there's no comparison for me. Messi is on a different level to everybody else, it's as simple as that. \"People say to me what about Ronaldo's goalscoring record and so forth? But I say to them have you seen Messi pass a football? Have you seen him dribble towards goal?\" Gary Lineker is a huge fan of Lionel Messi ( Image: Twitter) Ronaldinho Ronaldinho was in his prime at Barcelona when a teenage Messi was rising to prominence. The Brazilian playmaker wowed at the Nou Camp before leaving in 2008, and Messi duly picked up the mantle. And Ronaldinho is another in no doubt as to where he stands on the GOAT argument. \"Messi,\" he previously said, via Goal: I would have loved to continue playing alongside him. I didn't get enough time with him, he was very young. I'd love to take to the pitch with him one more time.\" Lionel Messi celebrates with Ronaldinho back in 2006 Frank Lampard Like his old England midfield colleague, Lampard was initially quoted as favouring Messi in the debate. And also like Gerrard, he later changed his mind Speaking to The Overlap in 2021, the Chelsea legend argued that Ronaldo's tendency to deliver on the big occasion had swayed his thinking. Worth noting his comments came before Messi and co tasted glory in Qatar though. \"I actually think for Ronaldo's output and actual numbers, and goals in big finals and semi-finals like we've seen, I think I maybe give him the edge,\" he said. \"That's going to start a load of hate, now!\" Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard both scored in the 2008 Champions League final Michael Owen Perhaps unsurprisingly for a former striker, Michael Owen has been swayed by goal stats. And Ronaldo's prolific record, which included a record 140 Champions League goals, has persuaded Owen to opt for the Portuguese star: \"Goalscoring is the hardest art in football and [Ronaldo] makes it look so easy,\" he said on BT Sport. \"Head, left foot, right foot.

I think Messi is outstanding in certain attributes but as an all-round physique, Ronaldo is such an all-around player.\" David Beckham Long before David Beckham signed Lionel Messi for Inter Miami, he'd made his stance on the debate very clear. Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi holds the Ballon d'Or award \"They have similarities in their technical skills and talent, and it is amazing for football to have them both present, but Messi is simply the best player in the world,\" he once said. \"He [Messi] is alone in his class as a player, it is impossible that there is another like him.

Ferguson, 19, signed an improved five-year deal with Brighton earlier this month, having emerged as one of the Premier League's brightest prospects since his top-flight debut in February 2022. Clubs often insert eye-watering release clauses into their best young players' contracts but the Seagulls opted against doing so in the case of Ferguson, leaving United in the dark regarding his true valuation. This allows Brighton to demand as much as they want for Ferguson, whose five league goals this season have only seen his stock rise. The Republic of Ireland international was tipped to join United during the summer transfer window before the Red Devils splurged £72million on highly-rated Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund , who himself is only 20. Ex-Man Utd scout furiously confronted club chiefs over Glazers' two transfer mistakes Amazon's music deal could convince you to drop Spotify and Apple Music Should United rekindle their interest in Ferguson, Brighton will undoubtedly drive a hard bargain, as demonstrated by the lucrative sales of ex-Seagulls stars Moises Caicedo , Ben White , Marc Cucurella and Alexis Mac Allister . The Athletic report that isn't a set figure which Brighton chiefs would have to accept should a club come in for their 19-year-old hotshot. Arsenal and Liverpool are among the sides who've also been linked with a big-money move for Ferguson, whose grand-uncle Damien notably played for the Red Devils in the 1970s. \"I supported United as a boy,\" the Irish starlet revealed to the Daily Mail . \"You had the [Wayne] Rooneys , the [Dimitar] Berbatovs and obviously [Brighton team-mate] Danny Welbeck . They've always had a good thing going with the striker.\" Get involved! Should Manchester United attempt to sign Evan Ferguson? Let us know your stance in the comments section . Evan Ferguson doesn't have a release clause in his Brighton contract ( Image: Alex Broadway/Getty Images) Ferguson, who recently became the first teenager since Rooney in 2005 to score at least 10 Premier League goals in a calendar year, has even been tipped to complete a \"dream\" move to United or Liverpool by ex-Ireland defender Richard Dunne . Speaking to BoyleSports , Dunne explained: \"I'm sure Evan Ferguson would be delighted at the thought of playing for Liverpool and Manchester United as most Irish boys would dream of that. \"I think it'll happen for him in the future, but he's still learning his trade at the moment at Brighton. He's in for some games, rested for others, and is still developing as a player. I'm sure Brighton will help him move on when he feels the time is right.
