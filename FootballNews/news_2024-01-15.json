The Magpies had previously been the favourites to land the England midfielder on loan, after City boss Pep Guardiola admitted he had \"struggled\" to see the former Leeds star in his starting line-up. However, a January exit for the 28-year-old looks increasingly unlikely according to , who reported that the reigning champions are demanding a £7million loan fee which Newcastle denied to pay, branding the deal as \"not making financial sense\".

Despite their Saudi takeover in 2021, the club are in financial straits with FFP after announcing a £73.4million loss in 2023. The mass monetary loss has led to reports that the Magpies will be forced to offload one of their top stars in order to reinvest in the squad with the likes of Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimaraes, and Sven Botman attracting interest from top clubs. While a deal does not look likely at this point, they would require City to lower the £7m fee demand in order to bring Phillips to St James' Park. The midfielder has made just 10 appearances this season, racking up just 318 minutes of action in the first half of the season. The Leeds native has yet to start a Premier League game this season with his last appearance in the competition going all the way back to November when he played 19 minutes in City's 6-1 destruction of Bournemouth.

Onana played the 90 minutes for his club on Sunday as 's side drew 2-2 at home to . The 27-year-old that he would play the fixture before jetting to the Ivory Coast to represent his country 24 hours later - but was unable to do so. That's after it was revealed bad weather saw his private plane was diverted to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, around 150 miles from where his country raised the curtain on its campaign in Yamoussoukro. The Indomitable Lions have been tasked with a difficult route to the AFCON knockout stages after being named in Group C opposite Guinea, Senegal and Gambia. The reported weather conditions in Yamoussoukro made it impossible for Onana to complete his journey as planned. As a result, Nimes stopper Fabrice Ondoa started between the posts against Guinea at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium. And it appeared to hurt Rigobert Song's side after some uncertain defending resulted in Guinea taking an early lead against his side. Le Havre striker Mohamed Bayo (on loan from Lille) pounced to score in the ninth minute despite Ondoa's best efforts following a disastrous attempt to play out from the back. It's understood Onana completed his journey by car after Yamoussoukro Airport was surrounded by fog. And those additional hours may have made all the difference as he was unable to represent his country in a crucial fixture. Guinea may well be the easiest opponent in Cameroon's group considering Senegal won the AFCON in 2021, the same year Gambia made their first quarter-final appearance. And Onana's decision to stay on and prove his loyalties to United may end up impacting his country if they make an early exit in the Ivory Coast.

Summer signing Altay Bayindir - who joined from Fenerbahce in the summer - could get his chance to start that game in Onana's absence having yet to make his senior United debut.

Despite their Saudi takeover in 2021, the club are in financial straits with FFP after announcing a £73.4million loss in 2023. The mass monetary loss has led to reports that the Magpies will be forced to offload one of their top stars in order to reinvest in the squad with the likes of Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimaraes, and Sven Botman attracting interest from top clubs. While a deal does not look likely at this point, they would require City to lower the £7m fee demand in order to bring Phillips to St James' Park.

The Leeds native has yet to start a Premier League game this season with his last appearance in the competition going all the way back to November when he played 19 minutes in City's 6-1 destruction of Bournemouth.

Това не е най-трудният ми гол, но съм доволен, че успях да се разпиша, защото мина известно време откакто нямам гол на „Сан Сиро“ в шампионата. С Тео се познаваме добре, знаех къде се намира, но и имах малко късмет, защото топката мина под крака на съперников играч. Тео вкара страхотен гол\". \"Трябва да се концентрираме върху нас самите.

Onana played the 90 minutes for his club on Sunday as 's side drew 2-2 at home to . The 27-year-old that he would play the fixture before jetting to the Ivory Coast to represent his country 24 hours later - but was unable to do so. That's after it was revealed bad weather saw his private plane was diverted to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, around 150 miles from where his country raised the curtain on its campaign in Yamoussoukro. The Indomitable Lions have been tasked with a difficult route to the AFCON knockout stages after being named in Group C opposite Guinea, Senegal and Gambia. The reported weather conditions in Yamoussoukro made it impossible for Onana to complete his journey as planned. As a result, Nimes stopper Fabrice Ondoa started between the posts against Guinea at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium. And it appeared to hurt Rigobert Song's side after some uncertain defending resulted in Guinea taking an early lead against his side. Le Havre striker Mohamed Bayo (on loan from Lille) pounced to score in the ninth minute despite Ondoa's best efforts following a disastrous attempt to play out from the back. It's understood Onana completed his journey by car after Yamoussoukro Airport was surrounded by fog. And those additional hours may have made all the difference as he was unable to represent his country in a crucial fixture. Guinea may well be the easiest opponent in Cameroon's group considering Senegal won the AFCON in 2021, the same year Gambia made their first quarter-final appearance. And Onana's decision to stay on and prove his loyalties to United may end up impacting his country if they make an early exit in the Ivory Coast.

The Magpies had previously been the favourites to land the England midfielder on loan, after City boss Pep Guardiola admitted he had \"struggled\" to see the former Leeds star in his starting line-up. However, a January exit for the 28-year-old looks increasingly unlikely according to , who reported that the reigning champions are demanding a £7million loan fee which Newcastle denied to pay, branding the deal as \"not making financial sense\". Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C £22 a month The hierarchy at Newcastle were also reportedly put off by City's willingness to include an obligation to buy as part of the terms of the loan. Despite their Saudi takeover in 2021, the club are in financial straits with FFP after announcing a £73.4million loss in 2023. The mass monetary loss has led to reports that the Magpies will be forced to offload one of their top stars in order to reinvest in the squad with the likes of Alexander Isak, Bruno Guimaraes, and Sven Botman attracting interest from top clubs. While a deal does not look likely at this point, they would require City to lower the £7m fee demand in order to bring Phillips to St James' Park. The midfielder has made just 10 appearances this season, racking up just 318 minutes of action in the first half of the season. The Leeds native has yet to start a Premier League game this season with his last appearance in the competition going all the way back to November when he played 19 minutes in City's 6-1 destruction of Bournemouth.

Onana played the 90 minutes for his club on Sunday as 's side drew 2-2 at home to . The 27-year-old that he would play the fixture before jetting to the Ivory Coast to represent his country 24 hours later - but was unable to do so. That's after it was revealed bad weather saw his private plane was diverted to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, around 150 miles from where his country raised the curtain on its campaign in Yamoussoukro. The Indomitable Lions have been tasked with a difficult route to the AFCON knockout stages after being named in Group C opposite Guinea, Senegal and Gambia. The reported weather conditions in Yamoussoukro made it impossible for Onana to complete his journey as planned. As a result, Nimes stopper Fabrice Ondoa started between the posts against Guinea at the Charles Konan Banny Stadium. And it appeared to hurt Rigobert Song's side after some uncertain defending resulted in Guinea taking an early lead against his side. Le Havre striker Mohamed Bayo (on loan from Lille) pounced to score in the ninth minute despite Ondoa's best efforts following a disastrous attempt to play out from the back. It's understood Onana completed his journey by car after Yamoussoukro Airport was surrounded by fog. And those additional hours may have made all the difference as he was unable to represent his country in a crucial fixture. Guinea may well be the easiest opponent in Cameroon's group considering Senegal won the AFCON in 2021, the same year Gambia made their first quarter-final appearance. And Onana's decision to stay on and prove his loyalties to United may end up impacting his country if they make an early exit in the Ivory Coast.
