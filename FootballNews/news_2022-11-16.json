The team travelled in a plane named ‘Rain Bow’, as a gesture against Qatar’s anti-LGBT laws. According to the reports, the plane owned by the Virgin Atlantic which ferried the England team to Qatar also portrayed a cartoon figure posed in rainbow-themed trainers. The airbus further had a registration number GV-PRD, an abbreviation of ‘Pride’. The stunt was revealed as England men’s team players arrived for the tournament and posed in front of rainbow-styled Nike swooshes.

The design, which has seven rainbow-colored vertical stripes under “USA” written in dark blue letters, is part of the team’s ‘Be The Change’ program, which was launched in 2020 to motivate action on social justice concerns. #WATCH | US use rainbow logo at Qatar World Cup in support of LGBTQ community#fifa #lgbtq #qatar #fifaworldcup pic.twitter.com/XeQvrnwITp— Zee News English (@ZeeNewsEnglish) November 15, 2022 US coach Gregg Berhalter said on Monday that it is important to bring awareness to these issues on the world stage, especially in Qatar. “It is not just Stateside that we want to bring attention to social issues, it is also abroad. We recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress but there’s some work still to do,” he was quoted. US Soccer spokesman Neil Buethe also commented on the issue and said, “Our rainbow badge has an important and consistent role in the identity of US Soccer. Locations that we will manage and operate at the Fifa World Cup, such as the team hotel, media areas and parties, will feature both traditional and rainbow US Soccer branding.” Germany hails diversity in its team aircraft Meanwhile, Germany also made its stand on the issue clear by making a statement on its flight out. The statement ‘diversity wins’ has been written over the body of their Lufthansa Airbus A330 which would ferry the squad to Qatar. The German plane is currently at its training base in Oman while the England men’s team reached the World Cup host country on November 15. Reports mention that the England men’s team in Qatar will also be wearing rainbow ‘One Love’ armbands regardless of FIFA permission. In Qatar, same-sex relationships are outlawed, and the host country has come under fire for its harsh anti-LGBTQ regulations as the dates for the World Cup draw closer. Earlier, England and Wales and six other European nations had requested FIFA to allow their captains to wear ‘OneLove’ multicolored wristbands at the World Cup, in a response to concerns about Qatar’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws. However, FIFA president Gianni Infantino and secretary general Fatma Samoura sent a letter to the teams urging them to ‘let football take center stage’.

Qatar’s Foreign Minister, HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani then summoned the German ambassador over the concerns raised by his country over the alleged human rights violations in Qatar. He accused Germany of ‘double standards’ and also reminded the people that the European countries have no problem with Qatar when it comes to energy partnerships or investments. As reported earlier, a large majority of people in Britain think the World Cup should not be held in Qatar because of its position on LGBTQ+ rights. 62% of British people believe Qatar’s stance on homosexual rights should have been enough to disqualify it from hosting the event. Organizers of the game say that they are welcoming everyone regardless of their sexual orientation or background but has also issued warnings against public displays of affection. Qatar won the right to host the summer World Cup in December 2010 against all odds in 50 degrees celsius temperature, before FIFA moved the World Cup to winter for the first time in history to protect players from that heat. The tournament will now be held from 21st November to 18th December in the small Arabian country.","pubDate":"2022-11-16 09:15:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"opindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ASSE, PSG, OM, OL, FC Nantes, RC Lens, LOSC, Rennes, Nice : un arbitre de L1 et L2 est mort","link":"https://www.butfootballclub.fr/ligue-1/asse-psg-om-ol-fc-nantes-rc-lens-losc-rennes-nice-un-arbitre-de-l1-et-l2-est-mort-796325","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Arbitre de Ligue 1 depuis 2016, Johan Hamel s’est éteint à l’âge de 42 ans des suites d’un AVC à l’entraînement.

And after we don’t know about Liverpool but they are already 11 points behind and 10 points behind Man City is a mountain to climb. And SunSport columnist Piers Morgan wants Arsenal to sign Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo after his explosive interview on Piers Morgan: Uncensored. Morgan believes Ronaldo would lead the Gunners to the top of the Premier League alongside Gabriel Jesus. Asked on Twitter if he hoped the North Londoners would sign CR7, the journalist responded: \"Yes, actually. \"He’s exactly what we need. Ronaldo and Gabriel Jesus would take us to the title.\" Finally, United have joined Arsenal in the bidding war for Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhailo Mudryk, as per SunSport's Daniel Cutts. SunSport understands United have been tracking Mudryk for a while, with scouts keeping watch, while manager Erik ten Hag has been keen on him since his days as Ajax boss. However, Shakhtar are reluctant to let one of their prized assets go on the cheap, and would demand a substantial fee for the winger. It is unlikely the Red Devils will go for the Ukraine international in January, after having major investment in the squad over the past summer. Kostas Lianos 14th Nov 2022, 22:47 Sutton on Arsenal chances Arsenal have what it takes to win the Premier League title if key players avoid injuries, claims Chris Sutton. Sutton believes the Gunners can capitalise on Manchester City's \"mistakes\" and that everyone in football knows they are strong contenders. The ex-Chelsea ace also stressed that the January transfer window will be important for the North Londoners - if they can strengthen their squad they could go all the way. Sutton further believes that manager Mikel Arteta will try to downplay their chances but inwardly will be believing something else Kostas Lianos 14th Nov 2022, 22:19 Mudryk on Arsenal fans Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhailo Mudryk revealed he is surprised by all the messages he is getting from Arsenal fans amid the Gunners' interest in signing him. Mudryk told Vlada Sedan, Oleksandr Zinchenko’s wife: “One surprise for me was how many Arsenal fans followed me. “No other club’s fans have interacted as much as them. Telling me that they are waiting for me, saying ‘Come to us’. \"One of my recent posts has over 500 comments saying that” Kostas Lianos 14th Nov 2022, 21:49 Mudryk's transfer tip Shakhtar Donetsk star Mykhailo Mudryk revealed he would only agree to join another team if the manager promised him he would at least get a chance to play. Mudryk has received intense interest from Arsenal ahead of the January transfer window. The winger said: “I would first want to know from the head coach that even if I wasn’t a guaranteed starter, that I’d receive a chance. “Essentially I need to hear directly from the manager what he envisages my role to be in his side” Kostas Lianos 14th Nov 2022, 21:28 Jesus' Spurs snub Arsenal star Gabriel Jesus didn't mention rivals Tottenham among his team's Premier League title threats this season. Jesus said: \"We cannot look to others. \"We know Man City , obviously I know them more than most of the people. But we have to do our job.

That is according to Fichajes , who claim the Yellow Submarine could look to cash in on Chukwueze while they still have negotiating power - with his contract expiring in 2024. The winger has been on the Gunners' radar for several years and Mikel Arteta's side missed out on the chance to sign him for just £4million in 2018.

Bellerin has started just three times for Barca across all competitions so far this season and his inactivity is now seeing him being linked away from the Nou Camp. According to Calcio Mercato , Roma are interested in bringing the full-back to Italy. Jose Mourinho's side is keen to sell current right-back Rick Karsdorp and if they are able to offload him then the Spaniard is being looked at as an ideal replacement Kostas Lianos 14th Nov 2022, 19:52 Tears and jeers Arsenal star Gabriel Martinelli revealed how he sobbed at being called up for Brazil’s 2022 World Cup squad. Martinelli said: “I'm very happy, it's one of the most important moments in my life and in my family's life as well - I'm buzzing. I'm so excited to go there and be part of this team. “I cried a lot, I couldn't even talk and I was with my family and on the phone but I needed to turn the phone off and call them later because I couldn't even talk. “I think it will be good for my career and to play in the World Cup will be amazing.

Unfortunately we have another four players with the same symptoms, so I don't know exactly what happened. \"There were a few players not feeling great.

[Gabriel] Jesus is having a bit of a moment, he’s playing well and doing a great job for the team but not got the goals. \"That’s when you need your midfield players, wide men, can they chip in and make the difference?

Back in 2019, just months after being booed by his own fans, who he then told to f**k off, Xhaka was ready to leave. The midfielder was on the verge of signing for Hertha Berlin but Arteta, who had literally just arrived at the club, asked him for six more months. Xhaka said: \"In our first conversation I told him that I was going. He just said: 'Stay, I will make sure that you deliver top performances.

They solved one of their problems on Wednesday when Jackson Hastings was officially announced on a three year deal with Newcastle releasing prop David Klemmer to join the Tigers.While the Ponga/Hastings is all but locked in the Knights will now shift their attention to finding a fullback. They missed out on Manly flyer Reuben Garrick who recommitted to the club on a long-term deal and want to give Miller a crack at fullback.However, the Sharks are privately knocking back any move to release Miller from the final year of his contract. The ex-Olympic sevens player made a mark for Cronulla during his seven matches this year – including running for a game high 198 metres and scoring a try against Newcastle in the final round of the season.The Sharks have a high opinion of Miller and believe he will be an asset next season. Cronulla refused to release Luke Metcalf this year despite the half signing with the Warriors for next year.Other options internally at the Knights include the versatile Kurt Mann or veteran Dane Gagai. The Knights were also in pursuit of Brisbane’s Tesi Niu but he has been linked with the Dolphins.Tigers coach Tim Sheens “congratulated” Hastings on securing on his long-term future. The Tigers had made it clear he would play lock for the club.“I don‘t blame Jacko, he wanted to play seven and (Newcastle) offered him a seven jumper,” Sheens said. ”He was in our plans to be 13, but he’s off to Newcastle to play seven and we wish him well.”Klemmer joins the club for at least the next three seasons with a mutual option for a fourth year. He reunites with Sheens who handed Klemmer his Kangaroos debut in 2014.“We needed a bit of experience in the front row, we’ve got some great kids coming through in our 20s and our State Cup, but some more experience in there was something we were looking for and he fits the bill really well,” Sheens said. “I‘m looking forward to having him in the joint. He’s got lovely hands, he can play footy, he’s big and he’s fit. He won the Knights player of the year and he’s a quality person, having met his wife and family. “I enjoyed the time I had with him in the Australian side when he was younger and I‘m comfortable we’ve got ourselves a strong buy that will help lead the forwards.”The Tigers are continuing discussions with English backrower John Batemen to form a revamped forward pack.IT’S OFFICIAL: KNIGHTS UNVEIL NEW HALFBACK—Michael Carayannis, Phil RothfieldNewcastle have lauded the signing of Jackson Hastings as the Knights and Tigers confirm a player swap.Hastings will link up with Newcastle and wear the no.7 jersey after agreeing to a three year deal to join the club immediately.His arrival will see ex-Kangaroos and NSW prop David Klemmer join the Tigers for at least the next three years.Newcastle director of football Peter Parr said the club were “delighted” to secure Hastings.“He compliments our playing roster and adds further depth to our halves, with the additional bonus of being a competent goal kicker.“Jackson is at a stage of his career where he is coming into his prime and we believe his best years are ahead of him.”Tigers boss Justin Pascoe said Hastings’ departure was based on “tough decisions” needed to be made at the club.“Our members and fans need to understand that every decision that is made is in the best interest of this club and changing the fortunes on the field.“This was a good opportunity for Jackson to get a long-term deal playing in his preferred position at number seven.”PLAYERS WARNED TO STAY AWAY AMID SWAP SPECULATIONNewcastle’s 12-month search for a halfback is set to end while the Tigers continue to add grunt to their forward pack in a player market shake-up.Barring any last minute hurdle, Jackson Hastings will join Newcastle while David Klemmer is Tigers bound after the two clubs were locked in discussions in the past 72 hours to get a deal done.Both players were told to skip training on Monday while the clubs continued negotiations as they move to finalise a deal which works for both parties.It is understood the respective contracts will be for at least three seasons. Hastings and Klemmer had 12 months left on their current deals.Hastings gets a crack at wearing the No.7 jersey he has craved after the Tigers preferred Luke Brooks – who the Knights also flirted with signing – to start at halfback. Hastings was set to play at lock for the Tigers this year.Instead, he will now most likely form a dynamic combination with Kalyn Ponga, with the Knights toying with the idea of moving their superstar fullback into the halves.The Knights struggled for any direction in the halves this year after Mitchell Pearce left the club during last off-season. Adam Clune, Jake Clifford and Phoenix Crossland were all tried in the No.7 jersey with limited success. Clune remains at the club and they have added Brisbane five-eighth Tyson Gamble.Immortal Andrew Johns has personally reached out to Hastings to talk him into joining the Knights.The Knights unsuccessfully pursued Manly’s Reuben Garrick with the promise of a shot at fullback.Klemmer is also given the security of a long-term deal which may not have eventuated if he saw out the final year of his $850,000 deal. He will also reunite with Tigers coach Tim Sheens, who handed Klemmer his Kangaroos debut in 2014.The Tigers will enjoy a vastly different forward pack next season. They have added Klemmer and fellow internationals Api Koroisau and Isaiah Papali’I and remain in the market for English back-rower John Bateman.The Knights will leave for a pre-season training camp on Tuesday.The Tigers are building a world-class forward pack. They have already signed representative duo Api Koroisau and Isaiah Papali’I and are now close to landing Klemmer and Englishman John Batmen. It is understood Bateman’s partner – who he met in Canberra – has returned to Australia with their young child. Bateman fell out with the Raiders in his final season at the club in 2020. He is only halfway through a four-year deal at Wigan. The Tigers already have the likes of Stefano Utoikamanu, Joe Ofahengaue, Shawn Blore and Alex Twal already on their books. Klemmer is still only 28 and needs just six games to play 200 first grade matches. The swap would be the second one for the Tigers after letting Tyrone Peachey go to Penrith in exchange for Charlie Staines.POTENTIAL TIGERS 2023 TEAM1 Charlie Staines2 David Nofoaluma 3 Starford To’a 4 Brent Naden 5 Ken Maumalo6 Adam Doueihi 7 Luke Brooks8 David Klemmer9 Api Koroisau10 Alex Twal11 John Bateman12 Isaiah Papali’I13 Joe Ofahengaue 14 Daine Laurie 15 Fonua Pole16 Shawn Blore 17 Stefano Utoikamanu","pubDate":"2022-11-16 05:44:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cristiano Ronaldo: All that Manchester United footballer has said in his explosive interview","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/cristiano-ronaldo-all-that-manchester-united-footballer-has-said-in-his-explosive-interview-11635541.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cristiano Ronaldo: All that Manchester United footballer has said in his explosive interview","content":"Sports Cristiano Ronaldo: All that Manchester United footballer has said in his explosive interview In a scathing interview, Cristiano Ronaldo has slammed his club Manchester United and manager Erik ten Hag. FP Sports November 16, 2022 11:03:46 IST Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to leave Manchester United in January transfer window. AP Just days before the start of FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo rocked the world of football with his explosive interview in which he claimed he felt “betrayed” by Manchester United and that manager Erik ten Hag is trying to force him out of the club. Ronaldo’s interview with Piers Morgan is yet to be aired but the snippets from it are being released. In the latest revelation, Ronaldo spoke about the pain his family and he had to suffer after one of his newborn twins died. The footballer had announced in April that his son Angel had died during childbirth . In the interview with TalkTV , Ronaldo opened up on the moment when he informed his other children that their newborn brother has died. Angel’s twin sister Bella was born healthy. “Gio arrived home and the kids start to say where’s the other baby, where’s the other baby?” Ronaldo said in the interview that has also been published in The Sun. “The kids start to say ‘Mom, where is the other baby….'” “After one week I say, ‘Let’s be upfront, and let’s be honest with the kids, let’s say that, Ángel, which is his name, he go to the Heaven.’ ” “That moment was probably the most difficult moment that I have in my life.” Cristiano Ronaldo opens up about the devastating death of his baby son, telling Piers Morgan: “We don’t understand why it happened to us.” @cristiano | @piersmorgan | @TalkTV | #PMU pic.twitter.com/tOba0WJpBf — Piers Morgan Uncensored (@PiersUncensored) November 15, 2022 ‘Worst moment in life’ Ronaldo further said that it was the most difficult moment in his life since his father died. “[It was] probably the worst moment that I passed through in my life, since my father died,” he said. “When you have a kid, you expect that everything will be normal, and you have that problem, it’s hard…we had quite difficult moments because we don’t understand why it happened to us.” He added Angle’s ashes are kept at the footballer’s house and that he still talks to him. “His ashes are with me, like my Daddy, they are here in the house. It is something that I want to hold for the rest of my life and not throw to the ocean or to the sea. I keep with me. They are next to my dad. I have a small church downstairs, a chapel, and I keep my daddy and my son there.” “Yes I do (talk to Angle and his father)…all the time and they are on my side. You know they help me to be a better man, to be a better person, to be a better father.” United ‘didn’t believe’ Roanldo about daughter’s illness In another part of the interview that was released earlier, Ronaldo revealed why he was late for Manchester United’s training for the 2022-23 season. “They didn’t believe that something was going wrong.” Cristiano Ronaldo has told Piers Morgan he felt doubted by his Manchester United bosses when he told them his newborn daughter was sick. @cristiano | @piersmorgan | @TalkTV | #PMU pic.twitter.com/Y2jDLFR62J — Piers Morgan Uncensored (@PiersUncensored) November 14, 2022 The footballer said that his newborn daughter Bella was ill after her twin brother had died and that delayed his arrival for the preseason, however, Manchester United executives “didn’t believe him”. “I spoke with the director and the president of Man Utd and they kind of didn’t believe that something was going wrong, which made me feel bad,” Ronaldo said. “I didn’t want to leave my family to do the pre-season because I didn’t think it was fair to leave my family for a pre-season. This is why I didn’t go.” Ronaldo slams Ten Hag and Manchester United Coming to Manchester United, Ronaldo has slammed managed Ten Hag for lack of respect towards the five-time Ballon d’Or winner. The multiple time Champions League, La Liga and Premier League winner has been reduced to a peripheral figure at United since the arrival of Ten Hag at the club. Recently Ronaldo refused to come on as a substitute for United in their 2-0 win against Tottenham. He was then dropped from the squad for the next game against Chelsea. “I don’t have respect for him because he doesn’t show respect for me,” Ronaldo said of Ten Hag . “Not only the coach, but another two or three guys around the club. I felt betrayed.” On being asked if he felt he is being forced out of the club, Ronaldo said: “Yes, I felt betrayed and I felt like some people don’t want me here, not only this year but last year too.” No evolution at United In another scathing attack, Ronaldo claimed that there has been no progress at the club since his first spell at United. Ronaldo played for United from 2003-2009 before joining Real Madrid. He also played for Juventus and returned to the English club in 2021. “Since Sir Alex left, I saw no evolution in the club. Nothing had changed,” said Ronaldo. “I want the best for the club. This is why I come to Manchester United. But you have some things inside that don’t help (us) reach the top level as (Manchester) City, Liverpool and even now Arsenal…a club with this dimension should be top of the three in my opinion and they are not unfortunately.” The footballer, who is currently in Qatar with the Portugal national team, also attacked the United owners, the Glazer family. “The Glazers, they don’t care about the club.” Cristiano Ronaldo has sensationally blasted Manchester United’s American owners. @cristiano | @piersmorgan | @TalkTV | #90MinutesWithRonaldo pic.twitter.com/nNTyHgqvPy — Piers Morgan Uncensored (@PiersUncensored) November 14, 2022 “The Glazers, they don’t care about the club. I mean, professional sport, as you know, Manchester is a marketing club,” he said. “They will get money from the marketing – the sport, it’s, they don’t really care, in my opinion. “The fans, they’re always right. I think the fans should know the truth, should know that the players want the best for the club. I want the best for the club. This is why I came to Manchester United.” Meanwhile, Manchester United have declined to comment on the interview. “Manchester United notes the media coverage regarding an interview by Cristiano Ronaldo,” the statement read. “The club will consider its response after the full facts have been established.

Tedesco, however, may yet have the last laugh.","content":"Manu picked up the Golden Boot award as the game’s best international player at the Australian team hotel on Tuesday night (AEDT), having flown back from a holiday in Greece to be on hand for the ceremony.Earlier in the day he had been named in the team of the tournament for the World Cup, beating Tedesco to the coveted fullback position.Tedesco won’t be too concerned given he may finish up the biggest prize of all as he prepares to lead the Kangaroos onto Old Trafford on Sunday morning (AEDT) in pursuit of the World Cup.Manu was one of only two New Zealand players named in the team of the tournament. Australia fared only slightly better - they had four. Samoa, the Kangaroos’ opponents on Saturday night - had five players.Tim Lafai was among them, named in the centres ahead of Jack Wighton and Latrell Mitchell. One or both could mount a strong argument in their favour given Lafai was only brought in after Samoa suffered injuries in their opening loss to England.Other Australian players had the right to feel snubbed. Valentine Holmes has been outstanding on the wing and Angus Crichton has been a standout in the second row.So too Patrick Carrigan in the front row. Their omission has given the Kangaroos extra ammunition heading into the weekend as they prepare for an historic occasion at the home of Manchester United.Of the five Samoan players named in the team of the tournament, arguably their most dangerous player was nowhere to be seen.Like Tedesco, Joseph Suaalii was overlooked in favour of Manu by the judging panel but Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga refuses to underestimate the teenage Sydney Roosters star heading into the weekend.Meninga wanted to bring Suaalii on tour with the Kangaroos but lost out to Samoa.He refuses to hold a grudge and has only admiration for the way the 19-year-old has conducted himself throughout the tournament.He also hit back at the implication that Samoan players were playing with more passion than the Australians.“I am pretty happy that he made a choice - that is why I pushed it from the middle of the year,” Meninga said.“I want players playing with passion. He wants to play for Samoa and he has a passion for it. I am really happy with my 25 players putting on the green and gold because they want to be there too.“We are no less passionate or committed than any other team. I think it has been great for the game for players to play for whoever they want to play, particularly their ancestral nation.“We will come up with a plan to try to nullify him (Suaalii). We know he will run the ball back hard and we have to handle that. “That is what rugby league is all about - it is confrontation. We will come up with the right answers when he carries the football.”Easier said than done. Suaalii has been a devastating presence in the World Cup, having churned through meters and tackle busts.“He has been awesome,” Manu said.“He is only 19 and he is only going to get better, It will be nice to see Ted and Suaalii going at it on the weekend.WORLD CUP TEAM OF THE TOURNAMENT“You have seen how tough he is, especially in the backfield. Some of the stuff he does at training, the skills, he is really silky, we will definitely see that over the next few years.“I always knew he was going to do well. It is pretty crazy what he can do. I don’t think everyone has seen what he can do yet.“I think he has that toughness too that really makes him a great player. He is so tough, the style he plays and bringing the ball back.“Then there is class on the end of it and skills. We haven’t seen much of that as fans. In training you see it every day. It is only time before he becomes the best player.”","pubDate":"2022-11-16 05:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New York City's first Major League Soccer stadium coming to Queens","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-city-football-club-stadium-willets-point-queens/","keywords":["Local News","Syndicated Local","Sports","NYCFC","Syndicated CBSNNY","New York News"],"creator":["CBS New York Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"The 25,000-seat stadium in Willets Point will be the new home of the New York City Football Club.","content":"NEW YORK -- CBS2 has confirmed New York City's first Major League Soccer stadium will be built in Queens .

The GoodThe top 10 stayed pretty static, and that’s fine.If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and it ain’t. Besides Oregon sliding from No. 6 to No. 12 after losing their second game to Washington, the top 10 is basically unchanged. (Utah moves to the No. 10 spot after Ole Miss and UCLA also lost.)The battle lines are pretty clearly drawn for a straightforward final stretch that could yield: Georgia undefeated Big Ten champ undefeatedTCU undefeatedCommittee chair Boo Corrigan was asked directly about the Frogs, who stuck at No. 4 after a defensive 17–10 win over Texas where the Longhorns’ only score was a fumble returned for a touchdown. “You’re looking for improvement during the course of the year and for their defense to give up three points,” Corrigan said on the ESPN rankings reveal show. “As you look at the whole package, they continue to improve. They’ve earned the opportunity to be in the top four.” Those are the easy solutions. One would think if those three situations stay chalky, each team would be in. Then we have a potential decision. USC as a one-loss Pac-12 champ would mean wins over UCLA, Notre Dame and either Oregon or Utah in the conference championship game. USC doesn’t have many quality wins … yet. One-loss ACC champion. North Carolina creeps up to No. 13 while Clemson sits at No. 9. We’ll have to wait until they get together in Charlotte to se how that matchup would affect the standings. UNC also has an opportunity to notch another top-25 win over NC State on rivalry weekend.All of this is okay. There isn’t much to find egregious with the top of the rankings. But as we know, college football rarely gives us something straightforward. TCU showed it knows how to win a defensive battle against Texas.Stephen Spillman/AP The BadStill no respect on Coastal Carolina’s name.Yes, Grayson McCall is injured for the rest of the regular season, and it remains unclear if the Chanticleers will get a chance to play Virginia on Saturday with the status of the game in flux due to the tragic deaths of three UVa players on Sunday night. But Coastal is still not ranked despite being 9–1 and being one of two teams to beat No. 21 Tulane (the other is No. 20 UCF). Head coach Jamey Chadwell asked for some more respect and the committee didn’t exactly give it to him. The UglyWhy exactly is NC State ranked?They were kept at arm’s length by Clemson, lost to Syracuse with an anemic offense (albeit with a backup quarterback) and then lost to a Boston College team that has not been good by one point. Considering Coastal Carolina isn’t in, it’s mind boggling NC State is. More College Football Coverage:TCU Might Be the Only Protection From a Power 2 PlayoffMichigan's Nonconference Slate Could Spark Playoff DebateAfter Unspeakable Tragedy, UVA Students Left With One Question: Why?Seven Potential Comeback Stories to Watch Out for Down the StretchJimbo Fisher Shows the Perils of Over-Investment","pubDate":"2022-11-16 04:25:46","image_url":"http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNzgwMjY2Mjc4MzMxODg4/jamey-chadwell.jpg","source_id":"si","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Commentary: To reach playoff, USC would likely need to win heated Tennessee debate","link":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-11-15/commentary-cfp-rankings-usc-tennessee-georgia-ohio-state-tcu","keywords":null,"creator":["J.

Not to look for that killer pass all the time, and then in the last 20, 30 minutes was when we changed gear.\"After a controversial Shinsuke Nakamura goal in the first half, where a clear foul on goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was ignored, the Socceroos were staring down the barrel of a 1-0 defeat as time ticked away.But Hiddink, and the players, weren't flustered. ﻿\"There was no doubt we could turn it around,\" Aloisi told Wide World of Sports.\"I probably got a yellow card after one minute of being on, just trying to give the boys a lift. Then we got a free kick and I remember shooting at goal just to get the keeper to make a save, and try and lift that energy as much as possible.\"Tim did the same, and Josh [Kennedy] did the same - and we knew that was our role. We'd do it at training when Guus would go 'OK guys, now we're chasing the game'.With Kennedy thrown on for Craig Moore with half an hour to go, Australia were playing with three out-and-out No.9s when Aloisi joined the fray, as well as a host of other attacking players such as Cahill, and Harry Kewell.Group-by-group previews: Group A | Group B| Group C | Group D | Group E﻿ | Group F\"You come off thinking and hoping that you can get back into the game and that the changes can be the difference - and we had the character and the quality in that squad to beat anyone,\" Wilkshire said of his feelings with 15 to go.\"That never say die attitude was well and truly part of our beliefs. We weren't afraid, we never took a backwards step.\"﻿There was six minutes to go when Australia found a way back into the game, ﻿a long throw pinballing around the area before Cahill prodded home.But while the first was scrappy, the second was sublime.Cahill picked up possession on the edge of the area, and curled a shot that bounced satisfyingly off the left-hand post, before nestling in the right-side netting. ﻿﻿Japan had a penalty shout waved away in the dying minutes, before Aloisi put the result beyond doubt - but he credited his manager with, at least partially, preventing that spot kick from being awarded.\"Timmy probably gave away a penalty that they didn't give which could have made it 2-2, but I think Guus Hiddink played it well,\" he said.\"He went crazy at the referee at half-time [in regards to the Japan goal] to say 'you owe us one because that's not a foul', and I think that's why we get away with one.\"Fortune favoured Australia in that case, and the full time whistle blew moments after Aloisi broke away to secure a 3-1 win.\"You can't describe it - anyone who's scored a goal before knows how it feels, and as a striker that's what you're there to do - but it's the best feeling in the world to score a goal, and to score a goal at a World Cup, you can't top it,\" he said.\"I knew that third goal was to win the game because there wasn't much time left, and it was one of those games where we looked down and out, a draw probably wouldn't have been enough for us.\"With the spectre of Brazil looming in the second game, starting strongly was vital - and well and truly ignited the hopes and dreams of fans back home.\"To go there and hold our own and cause some upsets really brought football to the front of people's minds,\" Wilkshire said.If 2005's heroics against Uruguay had thrust football into the spotlight, the Japan game had cranked the brightness all the way up. ﻿\"It was hugely important. We didn't want to go there and not do well, and we believed once we made it that we could show the world what we could do,\" Aloisi said.\"It's one thing qualifying, it's another thing really competing against the likes of Brazil, Croatia, Japan, and Italy, who ended up winning it.\"Now, 16 years later, the new crop have a chance to be heroes - and both of these members of the class of 06 know just how important it is for the sport back home. ﻿\"People take notice - this is the World Cup, it's the biggest event in sport so we need to be there, and we need to perform,\" Wilkshire said.\"In what other sport are you going to have people that aren't fanatical fans getting up a 2, 3am to watch games of another sport? You wouldn't. It's massive.\"If we can get through this group, then you're going to get shockwaves again through the sport.\" Australia's campaign begins on Wednesday morning, against France - and after the disappointment of Russia and Brazil, better results are sorely needed.\"That's the shot in the arm we need every four years, that's just the way it is. And we shouldn't take it for granted - the whole nation does get behind the Socceroos when we're at a World Cup,\" Aloisi said.\"We're not hiding behind the fact that sometimes we get lost behind the other codes and people don't know what's going on with Australian football, but come World Cup time, everyone knows what's going on.\" ﻿For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here","pubDate":"2022-11-16 04:20:11","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/11/466840/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"German Football Bars Boycott \"Unacceptable\" Qatar World Cup","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/football/german-football-bars-boycott-unacceptable-qatar-world-cup-3524466","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"When Germany kick off their Qatar World Cup campaign against Japan next week, the projector screens at Berlin's Fargo football bar will be in their unusual rolled-up position","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-16 04:11:37","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/k1limi7o_dortmund-fans-afp_625x300_16_November_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shocking TV ambush raises World Cup safety fears","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/football/fifa-world-cup-2022-danish-reporter-reveals-frightening-censorship-attempt-in-qatar/34ab4241-2410-4051-a8bc-840056c6e36b","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"A﻿ Danish journalist has received an apology after two locals attempted to censor a live cross from the streets of Doha.","content":"F﻿ears over the safety of tourists travelling to Qatar for the FIFA World Cup have once again risen after a shocking attempt at censorship caught on live television.Danish reporter ﻿Rasmus Tantholdt was doing a live cross on the streets of Doha for TV 2 NYHEDERNE when two Qatari locals interrupted and threatened to smash his camera.Tantholdt was chatting to a camera, when ﻿two men appeared in a buggy.

Lycett called out Beckham in a video uploaded to social media where he questioned the ‘gay icon’ for accepting money from Qatar.“This is a message to David Beckham. I consider you, along with Kim Woodburn and Monty Don, to be a gay icon,” Lycett says.“You were the first premiership footballer to do shoots with gay magazines like Attitude, to speak openly about your gay fans, and you married a Spice Girl, which is the gayest thing a human being can do.“But now it’s 2022, and you’ve signed a reported 10 million pound deal with Qatar to be their ambassador during the FIFA World Cup.“Qatar was voted as one of the worst places in the world to be gay; homosexuality is illegal punishable by imprisonment and, if you’re Muslim, possibly even death.”“You’ve always talked about the power of football as a force for good, which suggests to me you’ve never seen West Brom but generally I agree.“So with that in mind I’m giving you a choice.“If you end your relationship with Qatar, I’ll donate this 10 grand of my own money as a grand for every million you’re reportedly getting, to charities that support queer people in football,” Lycett said in the video.“However, if you do not, by midday next Sunday, I will throw this money into a shredder just before the opening ceremony of the World Cup and stream it live on a website I’ve registered called benderslikebeckham.com.“Not just the money, but also your status as a gay icon will be shredded, you’ll be forcing me to commit a crime.”Lycett’s video however attracted widespread outrage from his followers who criticised him for threatening to shred the money.His followers were quick to point out the money should be used for charity instead of being wasted.“Please don’t shred the money. That’s a lifeline to a small charity,” one user wrote.Another responded: “Could you include a clause that the £10k could actually go to a cause instead of being wasted? Loads available. Or maybe to Beckham’s pet hate. But not totally wasted.”One fan responded to his video with: “For the love of Christ, Joe, do not ACTUALLY waste that literally life-changing amount of money for the sake of naming and shaming a celebrity footballer.”Music icon Dua Lipa shut down rumours linking her to a World Cup performance by pointing out she wouldn’t be venturing to Qatar because of their human rights record.“There is currently a lot of speculation that I will be performing at the opening ceremony of the World Cup in Qatar.“I will not be performing and nor have I ever been involved in any negotiation to perform.“I will be cheering England on from afar and I look forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made when it won the right to host the World Cup.“One love, Dua x.”Lycett’s ultimatum to Beckham will end ahead of the opening game between Qatar and Ecuador on Monday morning at 3am (AEDT).","pubDate":"2022-11-16 03:53:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How a 12-Team College Football Playoff Would Look After Week 11","link":"https://www.si.com/college/2022/11/16/cfp-rankings-12-team-playoff-college-football-week-11","keywords":["College Football","HP Feature","College","News And Analysis"],"creator":["Ross Dellenger"],"video_url":null,"description":"The expanded playoff would make possible some electric first- and second-round matchups.","content":"The expanded playoff would make possible some electric first- and second-round matchups.Are you sick of Alabama-Clemson national championship games?

SPECIAL OFFER: UNLOCK EVERYTHING ON RACENET FOR JUST $1But Hulbert insists Moody should never have had to apologise and shouldn’t face any action over his audio rant.Eagle Farm trainer Hulbert is still fighting to clear his name and overturn a $1000 fine after blasting jockey Andrew Mallyon as a “f---ing brain dead c--- that will never f---ing sit on one of our horses ever again” after a race on the Sunshine Coast in January last year.The message to owners ends with: “I’m f---en ropeable, I could “f---ing kill that c---.”Hulbert says private messages from trainers to owners should stay that way.And he maintains trainers have every right to call it as they see it.“Trainers shouldn’t have to apologise for someone else’s mistake,” Hulbert told Racenet.“We get out of bed at 3am every day to do our best for owners and then to have someone completely ruin it in under two minutes when going completely against instructions is unfathomable.“Jockeys can’t always ride to instructions I know, but there has to be a Plan B and don’t come back in after a race and refuse to say that you stuffed up when you clearly did.“If jockeys don’t do their job properly, they should be made accountable, why are they a protected species?“If football players or referees stuff up, they get dropped.“Moody’s message to owners – much like mine – should have remained private.“And as for jockeys, if they just come in and own their mistake then trainers will cop that.” Hulbert has had some joy at a Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal appeal of his matter which is now almost two years old.His case remains in limbo but Hulbert’s lawyer Dave Garratt said QCAT had agreed the appeal needed to be re-heard.“For me, it was never about the $1000 fine,” Hulbert said.“It is about what is right.“I have so far spent more than $13,000 on legal fees trying to clear my name.”","pubDate":"2022-11-16 03:42:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"UVA grieves slain football team members: \"It feels like it's a nightmare,\" coach says","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/uva-football-layers-killed-devin-chandler-lavel-davis-jr-dsean-perry-remembered/","keywords":["U.S.","Crime","Sports"],"creator":["Li Cohen"],"video_url":null,"description":"\"I'm ready for somebody to pinch me and wake me up and say this didn't happen,\" head football coach Tony Elliott said Tuesday.","content":"University of Virginia head football coach Tony Elliott and athletics director Carla Williams held back tears as they spoke about the outpouring of support the school has received and how team members are healing following the shooting deaths of three football players on Sunday night. \"It feels like it's a nightmare, to be honest with you. I'm ready for somebody to pinch me and wake me up and say this didn't happen,\" Elliott told reporters at a Tuesday press conference. College sophomore Devin Chandler, junior Lavel Davis Jr. and senior D'Sean Perry were killed in the shooting on a bus that was \"full of students\" returning from a field trip, officials said. They were also beloved members of the UVA football team, playing as wide receivers and linebacker, respectively. Two other students were injured in the shooting. The 22-year-old suspect in the shooting has since been arrested and charged with three counts of second-degree murder, two counts of malicious wounding and five counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony. There are no words to describe this tremendous loss to our UVA Football family. Lavel, Devin, D’Sean - you will all be dearly missed and we will never forget the impact you had on our team and community. pic.twitter.com/xdiq9KCU17 Elliott said that team members are relying on each other to navigate the tragedy. \"The approach with the team, once we were given the clear to communicate, we immediately got the team together and just started the process of grieving together and fellowshipping, and trying to make sure that nobody was isolated, that everybody was together,\" he said Tuesday. \"We pulled all the resources that we could from a counseling standpoint to give these young men the support that they need.\" Elliott said that after the initial shock, the team seems to now be slowly recovering from the tragedy. \"The first meeting was really, really tough,\" Elliot said as he fought back tears. \"Today was much better, we were able to transition from pain to finding a little bit of joy in celebrating the lives of Lavel, D'Sean, and Devin, and so today we started how probably the last two days have started, but it ended a lot better and I think that the guys are on the road to healing but it's going to take some time and our approach is to keep them together as much as we possibly can.\" Athletics director Carla Williams told reporters that a decision has not yet been made about whether the team will play its scheduled game against Coastal Carolina on Saturday, but said an announcement will be made soon. \"It will be a discussion with coach and the team,\" Williams said. \"Obviously, they're going through a lot. And we want to make sure they're involved as well. We'll use our best judgment.\" both devin chandler and lavel davis were my students. devin was in my class in spring 2022, and lavel is in my class this semester. I am so indescribably sad right now but I wanted to share a few memories of them, because they were wonderful people University of Virginia associate professor of media studies and American studies Jack Hamilton says he taught Chandler in the spring and Davis this semester. He said he is \"indescribably sad\" in the wake of their deaths, and shared memories of the two students on Twitter. Chandler, he said, was a transfer student who was in Hamilton's large lecture class, but would always make a point to go to Hamilton's office for insight about life at UVA. Later, Hamilton helped him decide his major – American studies, \"which he was really excited about.\" \"He was an unbelievably nice person, always a huge smile, really gregarious and funny,\" Hamilton said. \"One of those people who's just impossible not to like. It is so sad and enraging that he is gone.\" Davis, though quieter than Chandler in Hamilton's experience, was equally as nice of a person, he said. \"After our first day of class this semester, he made a point to come up and shake my hand and told me I should call him Vel,\" Hamilton said. Chandler, or Vel, would \"go out of his way\" to make friends with students in the class who weren't fellow athletes, Hamilton said, adding that he was struck by \"how much his classmates liked him and vice versa.\" \"I am just stunned and devastated and completely at a loss but wanted to say all this because they were great people with truly limitless futures and they should still be here,\" Hamilton said. \"It breaks my heart.\" Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News, focusing on social justice issues.","pubDate":"2022-11-16 03:41:00","image_url":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/11/15/28cb79f9-8e0a-433e-b1e7-1bb2de845b4b/thumbnail/1024x576/80fae9e6a003e29760baf63da973ef33/ap22319565056257.jpg","source_id":"newyorkcbslocal","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"College Football Playoff: SEC has 3 of the top 6 in the new rankings, putting it in position to get 2 teams in again","link":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-college-football-playoff-rankings-20221116-bbudeeenezfhrg7lcsvunqjmhe-story.html#ed=rss_www.chicagotribune.com/arcio/rss/category/sports/","keywords":null,"creator":["Ralph D.
