The agreement among the 12 schools comes after the Washington Supreme Court declined to review a lower court decision that granted control of the Pac-12 board of directors to the two remaining schools. As part of the agreement, the 10 departing schools will forfeit an undisclosed portion of revenue distributions over the rest of the 2023-24 school year and have provided “specific guarantees against potential future liabilities,” per ESPN . “In September, as the two remaining members of the Pac-12 Conference, Oregon State University and Washington State University were forced to act swiftly to protect the future viability of the Pac-12. Thanks to the determination and strength of Beaver Nation and Cougar Nation and the excellence of our student-athletes, coaches and staff, we are now closer to achieving our goal,” OSU president Jayathi Murthy and WSU president Kirk Schultz said in a joint statement. “Today’s news marks a huge victory for our universities and a significant step toward stabilizing the Pac-12 Conference and preserving its 108-year legacy.” The Pac-12 will retain all its assets and future revenues, the presidents said. The agreement allows all the schools to move forward, and give Oregon State and Washington State a clearer financial picture as they try to rebuild the Pac-12. In another statement, the departing schools said they will work out the final details in the coming days. “For now, we are grateful to resolve this dispute and look forward to competing against each other over the next several months in the Pac-12,” their statement said. Meantime, Oregon State and Washington State announced a scheduling alliance with the Mountain West Conference to play six MWC opponents in football during the 2024 season. The schools are also close to finalizing an affiliate agreement with the West Coast Conference to host most of its other sports, most notably men’s and women’s basketball, ESPN reported. In September, Washington State and Oregon State, sued the Pac-12 and commissioner George Kliavkoff over control of the conference and more than $400 million in revenue generated in 2023-24 school year. At issue is whether the 10 schools leaving the Pac-12 for other conferences should have a say in how the conference operates — or what happens to its assets. Whitman County (Washington) Superior Court Judge Gary Libey issued an injunction prohibiting the conference and its board of directors from recognizing any schools other than Washington State and Oregon State. The University of Washington on behalf of the 10 departing schools appealed the ruling to the Washington Supreme Court. In declining to review the case, the court left Washington State and Oregon State in control of the conference’s governing board.","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:36:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","source_priority":1778,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3620af98d2e3e0e987eea2e0039c3218","title":"Derby lover Curtis Good ready for Victory, Fornaroli","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/soccer/derby-lover-curtis-good-ready-for-victory-fornaroli-c-12997645","keywords":null,"creator":["Anna Harrington"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne City defender Curtis Good knows his way around a Christmas derby and is ready to take on Melbourne Victory and red-hot ALM striker Bruno Fornaroli.","content":"Few players love the Melbourne Christmas derby quite like Curtis Good. There are also fewer players better placed to handle one of the most unenviable jobs in Australian football right now. Good will go head-to-head with red-hot Melbourne Victory striker and his former City captain Bruno Fornaroli in Saturday night's A-League Men grudge match at AAMI Park, fresh off the 36-year-old's Socceroos recall. The cool-headed central defender can't wait. \"Obviously Bruno was here for a bit and I've played against him a lot,\" Good told AAP. \"He was really good (at City). When I first joined the club he was captain at the time and I remember the senior boys being very welcoming to me. \"He's in stellar form at the moment. \"Everything he's touching at the moment turns to gold. It's one of those things where you have to be very wary of him.\" Good played at the Heart from 2011-12, then had a six-year stint in England before joining City in 2018. Saturday's match is 12 years to the day since an 18-year-old Good took to the field in his first Christmas derby, a dramatic 3-2 win. \"I came off the bench for a bit. But I remember being very, very nervous,\" Good, now 30, said. \"Matt Thompson scored the double and we won. \"I just remember, like, 'damn, this is insane. This is crazy - this kind of experience.' It was awesome. \"It's probably the biggest game of the year, not including finals, especially the Christmas derby. \"It's probably my earliest memory as a footballer - a big game and the build-up and the lead-up to it, you can feel the the energy when you're out on the field. \"There's something about the late kick off just before Christmas, always get massive crowds and the energy's massive. So I'm looking forward to it.\" Good was right there just over a year ago when a pitch invasion forced the abandonment of last year's Christmas derby, but insists City have well and truly moved on. \"It was an experience. I mean, all the reflection was done probably prior to the replay of that game initially,\" he said. \"So we're in a situation now where a lot of the squad is very different. So it hasn't really been talked about at all. It's all been just, 'it's Melbourne Victory. It's a derby. Biggest game of the year.' \"It's one of those ones where if you can get a result going into Christmas you can just get a flow-on effect for the whole club and supporters and even your whole life. \"It being just before Christmas and that gives you that buzz.

Sheffield omen and Gareth Southgate scored as Unai Emery looks to leapfrog Arsenal","link":"https://talksport.com/football/1688498/aston-villa-top-premier-league-sheffield-united-unai-emery/","keywords":["Football","Premier League"],"creator":["Joe Brophy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Aston Villa have the chance to go top of the Premier League for the first time this century when they host Sheffield United tonight. Unai Emery has overseen an incredible turnaround at Villa Park and recent wins over Arsenal and Manchester City have put them in the title race. The Spaniard was appointed on October 24, 2022, with Villa having won just three of 12 Premier League games that season. Their dismal form had left them 14th, three points above the relegation zone, with Emery's predecessor Steven Gerrard dismissed. However, just over a year later, Villa have the chance to go top should they extend their record home run to 16 matches with a win over the Blades, live on talkSPORT . Emery's men are bidding to be the first crop of Villa players to be top of the table since January 8, 1999, after at least 18 matches played. Villa playing on Friday, a day before Liverpool take on Arsenal, means the club are guaranteed to be top overnight with a victory. The last time that happened was 25 years ago when Villa ironically beat Sheffield United 's neighbours Wednesday 2-1 to go top. England manager Gareth Southgate opened the scoring that day before a late winner from Ugo Ehiogu overcame the Owls. Villa ultimately limped to a sixth-placed finish after racking up just 16 more points in their final 18 league matches as Manchester United ultimately won the title. While it seems highly unlikely considering their form that Villa would suffer a similar fate this time, Emery has offered a word of warning. Emery said: \"I am focusing with [the players] every match we are facing trying to analyse the three points we are facing. Of course, I spoke when we lost in Newcastle 5-1, when we were losing in Liverpool 3-0, losing in Nottingham Forest 2-0, I was speaking about the same idea. \"We are building a team and we are trying to get better with each match with the players we have. We have to be demanding to improve and we are trying to build a team. \"We are in this process and it is not stopping. We are getting points, we are deserving to be there. The idea is to try and keep it. \"My challenges in front are the next matches in front and then how we can face against teams being consistent against teams who are contenders for the top seven.\"","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:32:51","image_url":"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/douglas-luiz-aston-villa-celebrates-848988969.jpg?strip=all&w=960","source_id":"talksport","source_priority":4624,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"40d2cbd250ee43bcad425d3b1c2f2209","title":"Florida State board approves lawsuit against ACC, challenging contract that binds school to league","link":"https://www.wfla.com/sports/college-sports/florida-state-board-approves-lawsuit-against-acc-challenging-contract-that-binds-school-to-league/","keywords":["College Sports","AP Sports","AP Top Headlines","AP Top News","Florida","Mobile","News","Outdoor Sports","Sports","Top Stories","Top Videos","Video"],"creator":["Ralph D.

Florida State outside counsel David Ashburn said a lawsuit was ready to be filed that claims the ACC’s grant of rights violates antitrust law and has unenforceable withdrawal penalties. Ashburn said it would cost a school $572 million to withdraw from the conference. The lawsuit also accuses the ACC of breach of contract and violation of public policy. Florida State is looking for a way out of the conference it has been a member of since 1992 because it believes the ACC is locked into an undervalued and unusually lengthy media rights deal with ESPN that runs through 2036. The school leaders also say the league refuses to change its revenue distribution model to match FSU’s value. Florida State leaders have been pushing for unequal distribution of revenue for more than a year. “It’s time for us to try to do something about it,” Florida State President Richard McCullough said. McCullough said the trustees’ approval of the legal challenge was not a direct reaction to Florida State recently being left out of the College Football Playoff, despite having an undefeated record. “This is not a reaction, but something we’ve done a lot of due diligence on,” he said. The ACC has agreed to create a bonus system that would direct more revenue to schools that have postseason success in football and basketball. It did not immediately comment on Friday’s decision.","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:31:16","image_url":"https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2023/12/fsu-acc.jpg?w=900","source_id":"wfla","source_priority":4217,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"79c75bfbf5c2fa0a2a1657fbb28b6500","title":"Manchester United takeover timeline amid Sir Jim Ratcliffe's imminent arrival","link":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-takeover-timeline-amid-28338895","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@men-news.co.uk (Jack Flintham)"],"video_url":null,"description":"INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25 per cent acquisition of Manchester United is close to being officially announced","content":"Manchester United have been in limbo for more than a year while the Glazers have carried out their strategic review but, just in time for Christmas , there are some positive reports about the takeover saga being completed. In November, Sir Jim Ratcliffe distanced himself as the favourite to purchase a minority stake in United after Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani withdrew from the process. Richard Arnold's departure as CEO during that month's international break was seen by many as a precursor for INEOS' imminent arrival. However, delays in the process let the saga drag on further, but fresh reports from The Times suggest a deal could be completed by Christmas with some murmurings suggesting it may have been rubber stamped on Friday afternoon. Here's how the next few weeks might look. READ MORE: Ratcliffe investment could be 'completed by Christmas' READ MORE: Howe breaks silence on United's Ashworth interest When will Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal be done? The suggestion is Ratcliffe could arrive before Christmas. However, with Christmas Day coming on Monday, it seems unlikely he will be at Carrington until the New Year. An official announcement could be saved until January 2 onwards which will set off a chain of events. When does the New York Stock Exchange need to be told? Before any official announcement by the club, the Glazers are required by the stock market to notify the NYSE at least 10 minutes before a press release, as per their regulations. When will the Premier League ratify the deal? Once United have announced Ratcliffe's intended arrival, the Premier League will need to ratify the deal. This could take up to eight weeks to confirm as the British billionaire is subjected to the Owners and Directors' test. What is the Owners and Directors' test? This test, which is colloquially referred to as the 'fit and proper persons' test', is used by the Premier League to assess whether a new owner or director has the necessary funds and is of the right calibre to take on a role in the boardroom. Critics of the test have argued it is not stringent enough but the top flight has made changes to attempt to make it stricter. What does this mean for January? Ultimately, the delays to Ratcliffe's arrival mean January is unlikely to be a groundbreaking month for INEOS or United. The window opens on January 1 and shall shut at 11pm on January 31. Even if Ratcliffe was to be confirmed today, there would be no time to get him ratified before the market shut. Had INEOS been in post sooner, there was no guarantees of big spending due to the club's perilous Financial Fair Play situation. Therefore, we can expect more outgoings than incomings next month.

'I can't wait to get started, and I'm ready to work to make the dream of winning more titles with this great club a reality.

Earlier this week, meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported that the club traded its No 3 draft pick in the MLS SuperDraft for FC Dallas ' No 15 selection and $300,000 in general allocation money. Those funds are expected to go towards paying Suarez's salary. Inter Miami first hinted at the signing after waiving forward Josef Martinez at the end of the 2023 season.

Mauricio Pochettino's side haven't had the ideal opening half of the season, with his team currently sat in 10th place, six points off the top seven and 12 points off the top four. The Blues' home form of late has been encouraging though, with the West London side winning four of their last five matches at Stamford Bridge, the only blip on that record being a draw against defending league champions Man City who were top of the league at the time. Making the trip to the Bridge on Wednesday is a Crystal Palace side who have found wins hard to come by in recent months, having only picked up one of them in their 12 matches since September. Performances have slowly been on the up though after a run of four defeats in five matches, drawing their last two games, notably coming back from two goals down to snatch a draw at the Etihad Stadium last weekend before a 1-1 draw with Brighton on Thursday. Roy Hodgson's still haven't picked up a win in their last eight matches though, a run which has seen them fall to 15th in the table, though still with a nine point lead over the bottom three, and are only four points off their opponents on Wednesday night. Pochettino historically has the better record between the two managers, winning five of the six matches he's managed against Hodgson. Chelsea have won their last 12 matches against Crystal Palace, who haven't won at Stamford Bridge since 2017. BetVictor have boosted a handful of their odds ahead of Wednesday night's clash, including those for Chelsea to win and both teams to score , which is now available at 27/10 . Nicolas Jackson is Chelsea's leading scorer this season and the odds for the Senegalese to add to his goal tally on Wednesday have been boosted 13/8 , while backing him to score the only goal of the game is now 30/1 .

The agreement among the 12 schools comes after the Washington Supreme Court declined to review a lower court decision that granted control of the Pac-12 board of directors to the two remaining schools. As part of the agreement, the 10 departing schools will forfeit an undisclosed portion of revenue distributions over the rest of the 2023-24 school year and have provided “specific guarantees against potential future liabilities,” per ESPN . “In September, as the two remaining members of the Pac-12 Conference, Oregon State University and Washington State University were forced to act swiftly to protect the future viability of the Pac-12. Thanks to the determination and strength of Beaver Nation and Cougar Nation and the excellence of our student-athletes, coaches and staff, we are now closer to achieving our goal,” OSU president Jayathi Murthy and WSU president Kirk Schultz said in a joint statement. “Today’s news marks a huge victory for our universities and a significant step toward stabilizing the Pac-12 Conference and preserving its 108-year legacy.” The Pac-12 will retain all its assets and future revenues, the presidents said. The agreement allows all the schools to move forward, and give Oregon State and Washington State a clearer financial picture as they try to rebuild the Pac-12. In another statement, the departing schools said they will work out the final details in the coming days. “For now, we are grateful to resolve this dispute and look forward to competing against each other over the next several months in the Pac-12,” their statement said. Meantime, Oregon State and Washington State announced a scheduling alliance with the Mountain West Conference to play six MWC opponents in football during the 2024 season. The schools are also close to finalizing an affiliate agreement with the West Coast Conference to host most of its other sports, most notably men’s and women’s basketball, ESPN reported. In September, Washington State and Oregon State, sued the Pac-12 and commissioner George Kliavkoff over control of the conference and more than $400 million in revenue generated in 2023-24 school year. At issue is whether the 10 schools leaving the Pac-12 for other conferences should have a say in how the conference operates — or what happens to its assets. Whitman County (Washington) Superior Court Judge Gary Libey issued an injunction prohibiting the conference and its board of directors from recognizing any schools other than Washington State and Oregon State. The University of Washington on behalf of the 10 departing schools appealed the ruling to the Washington Supreme Court. In declining to review the case, the court left Washington State and Oregon State in control of the conference’s governing board.","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:36:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","source_priority":1778,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3620af98d2e3e0e987eea2e0039c3218","title":"Derby lover Curtis Good ready for Victory, Fornaroli","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/soccer/derby-lover-curtis-good-ready-for-victory-fornaroli-c-12997645","keywords":null,"creator":["Anna Harrington"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne City defender Curtis Good knows his way around a Christmas derby and is ready to take on Melbourne Victory and red-hot ALM striker Bruno Fornaroli.","content":"Few players love the Melbourne Christmas derby quite like Curtis Good. There are also fewer players better placed to handle one of the most unenviable jobs in Australian football right now. Good will go head-to-head with red-hot Melbourne Victory striker and his former City captain Bruno Fornaroli in Saturday night's A-League Men grudge match at AAMI Park, fresh off the 36-year-old's Socceroos recall. The cool-headed central defender can't wait. \"Obviously Bruno was here for a bit and I've played against him a lot,\" Good told AAP. \"He was really good (at City). When I first joined the club he was captain at the time and I remember the senior boys being very welcoming to me. \"He's in stellar form at the moment. \"Everything he's touching at the moment turns to gold. It's one of those things where you have to be very wary of him.\" Good played at the Heart from 2011-12, then had a six-year stint in England before joining City in 2018.

But I remember being very, very nervous,\" Good, now 30, said. \"Matt Thompson scored the double and we won. \"I just remember, like, 'damn, this is insane. This is crazy - this kind of experience.' It was awesome. \"It's probably the biggest game of the year, not including finals, especially the Christmas derby. \"It's probably my earliest memory as a footballer - a big game and the build-up and the lead-up to it, you can feel the the energy when you're out on the field. \"There's something about the late kick off just before Christmas, always get massive crowds and the energy's massive. So I'm looking forward to it.\" Good was right there just over a year ago when a pitch invasion forced the abandonment of last year's Christmas derby, but insists City have well and truly moved on. \"It was an experience. I mean, all the reflection was done probably prior to the replay of that game initially,\" he said. \"So we're in a situation now where a lot of the squad is very different. So it hasn't really been talked about at all. It's all been just, 'it's Melbourne Victory. It's a derby. Biggest game of the year.' \"It's one of those ones where if you can get a result going into Christmas you can just get a flow-on effect for the whole club and supporters and even your whole life. \"It being just before Christmas and that gives you that buzz.

Unai Emery has overseen an incredible turnaround at Villa Park and recent wins over Arsenal and Manchester City have put them in the title race. The Spaniard was appointed on October 24, 2022, with Villa having won just three of 12 Premier League games that season. Their dismal form had left them 14th, three points above the relegation zone, with Emery's predecessor Steven Gerrard dismissed. However, just over a year later, Villa have the chance to go top should they extend their record home run to 16 matches with a win over the Blades, live on talkSPORT . Emery's men are bidding to be the first crop of Villa players to be top of the table since January 8, 1999, after at least 18 matches played. Villa playing on Friday, a day before Liverpool take on Arsenal, means the club are guaranteed to be top overnight with a victory. The last time that happened was 25 years ago when Villa ironically beat Sheffield United 's neighbours Wednesday 2-1 to go top. England manager Gareth Southgate opened the scoring that day before a late winner from Ugo Ehiogu overcame the Owls. Villa ultimately limped to a sixth-placed finish after racking up just 16 more points in their final 18 league matches as Manchester United ultimately won the title. While it seems highly unlikely considering their form that Villa would suffer a similar fate this time, Emery has offered a word of warning. Emery said: \"I am focusing with [the players] every match we are facing trying to analyse the three points we are facing. Of course, I spoke when we lost in Newcastle 5-1, when we were losing in Liverpool 3-0, losing in Nottingham Forest 2-0, I was speaking about the same idea. \"We are building a team and we are trying to get better with each match with the players we have. We have to be demanding to improve and we are trying to build a team. \"We are in this process and it is not stopping. We are getting points, we are deserving to be there. The idea is to try and keep it. \"My challenges in front are the next matches in front and then how we can face against teams being consistent against teams who are contenders for the top seven.\"","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:32:51","image_url":"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/douglas-luiz-aston-villa-celebrates-848988969.jpg?strip=all&w=960","source_id":"talksport","source_priority":4624,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"40d2cbd250ee43bcad425d3b1c2f2209","title":"Florida State board approves lawsuit against ACC, challenging contract that binds school to league","link":"https://www.wfla.com/sports/college-sports/florida-state-board-approves-lawsuit-against-acc-challenging-contract-that-binds-school-to-league/","keywords":["College Sports","AP Sports","AP Top Headlines","AP Top News","Florida","Mobile","News","Outdoor Sports","Sports","Top Stories","Top Videos","Video"],"creator":["Ralph D.

Florida State outside counsel David Ashburn said a lawsuit was ready to be filed that claims the ACC’s grant of rights violates antitrust law and has unenforceable withdrawal penalties. Ashburn said it would cost a school $572 million to withdraw from the conference. The lawsuit also accuses the ACC of breach of contract and violation of public policy. Florida State is looking for a way out of the conference it has been a member of since 1992 because it believes the ACC is locked into an undervalued and unusually lengthy media rights deal with ESPN that runs through 2036. The school leaders also say the league refuses to change its revenue distribution model to match FSU’s value. Florida State leaders have been pushing for unequal distribution of revenue for more than a year. “It’s time for us to try to do something about it,” Florida State President Richard McCullough said. McCullough said the trustees’ approval of the legal challenge was not a direct reaction to Florida State recently being left out of the College Football Playoff, despite having an undefeated record. “This is not a reaction, but something we’ve done a lot of due diligence on,” he said. The ACC has agreed to create a bonus system that would direct more revenue to schools that have postseason success in football and basketball. It did not immediately comment on Friday’s decision.","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:31:16","image_url":"https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2023/12/fsu-acc.jpg?w=900","source_id":"wfla","source_priority":4217,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"79c75bfbf5c2fa0a2a1657fbb28b6500","title":"Manchester United takeover timeline amid Sir Jim Ratcliffe's imminent arrival","link":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-takeover-timeline-amid-28338895","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@men-news.co.uk (Jack Flintham)"],"video_url":null,"description":"INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25 per cent acquisition of Manchester United is close to being officially announced","content":"Manchester United have been in limbo for more than a year while the Glazers have carried out their strategic review but, just in time for Christmas , there are some positive reports about the takeover saga being completed. In November, Sir Jim Ratcliffe distanced himself as the favourite to purchase a minority stake in United after Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani withdrew from the process. Richard Arnold's departure as CEO during that month's international break was seen by many as a precursor for INEOS' imminent arrival. However, delays in the process let the saga drag on further, but fresh reports from The Times suggest a deal could be completed by Christmas with some murmurings suggesting it may have been rubber stamped on Friday afternoon. Here's how the next few weeks might look. READ MORE: Ratcliffe investment could be 'completed by Christmas' READ MORE: Howe breaks silence on United's Ashworth interest When will Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal be done? The suggestion is Ratcliffe could arrive before Christmas. However, with Christmas Day coming on Monday, it seems unlikely he will be at Carrington until the New Year. An official announcement could be saved until January 2 onwards which will set off a chain of events. When does the New York Stock Exchange need to be told? Before any official announcement by the club, the Glazers are required by the stock market to notify the NYSE at least 10 minutes before a press release, as per their regulations. When will the Premier League ratify the deal? Once United have announced Ratcliffe's intended arrival, the Premier League will need to ratify the deal. This could take up to eight weeks to confirm as the British billionaire is subjected to the Owners and Directors' test. What is the Owners and Directors' test? This test, which is colloquially referred to as the 'fit and proper persons' test', is used by the Premier League to assess whether a new owner or director has the necessary funds and is of the right calibre to take on a role in the boardroom. Critics of the test have argued it is not stringent enough but the top flight has made changes to attempt to make it stricter. What does this mean for January? Ultimately, the delays to Ratcliffe's arrival mean January is unlikely to be a groundbreaking month for INEOS or United. The window opens on January 1 and shall shut at 11pm on January 31. Even if Ratcliffe was to be confirmed today, there would be no time to get him ratified before the market shut. Had INEOS been in post sooner, there was no guarantees of big spending due to the club's perilous Financial Fair Play situation. Therefore, we can expect more outgoings than incomings next month.

Suarez is the latest superstar to land in South Florida , following former Barcelona teammates Messi, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets to Major League Soccer . 'Nothing more beautiful than with friends,' Inter Miami wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of kids carrying the names of the team's four superstars. The team then added on X, formerly known as Twitter : 'Welcome to the Miami dream.' Suarez joins the MLS club following his departure from Brazilian side Gremio earlier this month. 'I'm very happy and excited to take on this new challenge with Inter Miami,' Suarez said. 'I can't wait to get started, and I'm ready to work to make the dream of winning more titles with this great club a reality. Inter Miami has confirmed the arrival of former Barcelona striker Luis Suarez to MLS 'I'm optimistic about what we can achieve together with our shared ambition,' said Suarez The 36-year-old - a European and five-time LaLiga champion - has signed a one-year deal 'I'm optimistic about what we can achieve together with our shared ambition,' said Suarez.

Earlier this week, meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported that the club traded its No 3 draft pick in the MLS SuperDraft for FC Dallas ' No 15 selection and $300,000 in general allocation money. Those funds are expected to go towards paying Suarez's salary. Inter Miami first hinted at the signing after waiving forward Josef Martinez at the end of the 2023 season. The club is also expected to sign winger Julian Gressel from the newly-crowned MLS Champions Columbus Crew , per the Miami Herald.

Mauricio Pochettino's side haven't had the ideal opening half of the season, with his team currently sat in 10th place, six points off the top seven and 12 points off the top four. The Blues' home form of late has been encouraging though, with the West London side winning four of their last five matches at Stamford Bridge, the only blip on that record being a draw against defending league champions Man City who were top of the league at the time. Making the trip to the Bridge on Wednesday is a Crystal Palace side who have found wins hard to come by in recent months, having only picked up one of them in their 12 matches since September. Performances have slowly been on the up though after a run of four defeats in five matches, drawing their last two games, notably coming back from two goals down to snatch a draw at the Etihad Stadium last weekend before a 1-1 draw with Brighton on Thursday. Roy Hodgson's still haven't picked up a win in their last eight matches though, a run which has seen them fall to 15th in the table, though still with a nine point lead over the bottom three, and are only four points off their opponents on Wednesday night. Pochettino historically has the better record between the two managers, winning five of the six matches he's managed against Hodgson. Chelsea have won their last 12 matches against Crystal Palace, who haven't won at Stamford Bridge since 2017.

The agreement among the 12 schools comes after the Washington Supreme Court declined to review a lower court decision that granted control of the Pac-12 board of directors to the two remaining schools. As part of the agreement, the 10 departing schools will forfeit an undisclosed portion of revenue distributions over the rest of the 2023-24 school year and have provided “specific guarantees against potential future liabilities,” per ESPN . “In September, as the two remaining members of the Pac-12 Conference, Oregon State University and Washington State University were forced to act swiftly to protect the future viability of the Pac-12. Thanks to the determination and strength of Beaver Nation and Cougar Nation and the excellence of our student-athletes, coaches and staff, we are now closer to achieving our goal,” OSU president Jayathi Murthy and WSU president Kirk Schultz said in a joint statement. “Today’s news marks a huge victory for our universities and a significant step toward stabilizing the Pac-12 Conference and preserving its 108-year legacy.” The Pac-12 will retain all its assets and future revenues, the presidents said. The agreement allows all the schools to move forward, and give Oregon State and Washington State a clearer financial picture as they try to rebuild the Pac-12. In another statement, the departing schools said they will work out the final details in the coming days. “For now, we are grateful to resolve this dispute and look forward to competing against each other over the next several months in the Pac-12,” their statement said. Meantime, Oregon State and Washington State announced a scheduling alliance with the Mountain West Conference to play six MWC opponents in football during the 2024 season. The schools are also close to finalizing an affiliate agreement with the West Coast Conference to host most of its other sports, most notably men’s and women’s basketball, ESPN reported. In September, Washington State and Oregon State, sued the Pac-12 and commissioner George Kliavkoff over control of the conference and more than $400 million in revenue generated in 2023-24 school year. At issue is whether the 10 schools leaving the Pac-12 for other conferences should have a say in how the conference operates — or what happens to its assets. Whitman County (Washington) Superior Court Judge Gary Libey issued an injunction prohibiting the conference and its board of directors from recognizing any schools other than Washington State and Oregon State. The University of Washington on behalf of the 10 departing schools appealed the ruling to the Washington Supreme Court. In declining to review the case, the court left Washington State and Oregon State in control of the conference’s governing board.","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:36:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","source_priority":1778,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3620af98d2e3e0e987eea2e0039c3218","title":"Derby lover Curtis Good ready for Victory, Fornaroli","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/soccer/derby-lover-curtis-good-ready-for-victory-fornaroli-c-12997645","keywords":null,"creator":["Anna Harrington"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne City defender Curtis Good knows his way around a Christmas derby and is ready to take on Melbourne Victory and red-hot ALM striker Bruno Fornaroli.","content":"Few players love the Melbourne Christmas derby quite like Curtis Good. There are also fewer players better placed to handle one of the most unenviable jobs in Australian football right now. Good will go head-to-head with red-hot Melbourne Victory striker and his former City captain Bruno Fornaroli in Saturday night's A-League Men grudge match at AAMI Park, fresh off the 36-year-old's Socceroos recall. The cool-headed central defender can't wait. \"Obviously Bruno was here for a bit and I've played against him a lot,\" Good told AAP. \"He was really good (at City). When I first joined the club he was captain at the time and I remember the senior boys being very welcoming to me. \"He's in stellar form at the moment. \"Everything he's touching at the moment turns to gold. It's one of those things where you have to be very wary of him.\" Good played at the Heart from 2011-12, then had a six-year stint in England before joining City in 2018.

But I remember being very, very nervous,\" Good, now 30, said. \"Matt Thompson scored the double and we won. \"I just remember, like, 'damn, this is insane. This is crazy - this kind of experience.' It was awesome. \"It's probably the biggest game of the year, not including finals, especially the Christmas derby. \"It's probably my earliest memory as a footballer - a big game and the build-up and the lead-up to it, you can feel the the energy when you're out on the field. \"There's something about the late kick off just before Christmas, always get massive crowds and the energy's massive. So I'm looking forward to it.\" Good was right there just over a year ago when a pitch invasion forced the abandonment of last year's Christmas derby, but insists City have well and truly moved on. \"It was an experience. I mean, all the reflection was done probably prior to the replay of that game initially,\" he said. \"So we're in a situation now where a lot of the squad is very different. So it hasn't really been talked about at all. It's all been just, 'it's Melbourne Victory. It's a derby. Biggest game of the year.' \"It's one of those ones where if you can get a result going into Christmas you can just get a flow-on effect for the whole club and supporters and even your whole life. \"It being just before Christmas and that gives you that buzz.

Unai Emery has overseen an incredible turnaround at Villa Park and recent wins over Arsenal and Manchester City have put them in the title race. The Spaniard was appointed on October 24, 2022, with Villa having won just three of 12 Premier League games that season. Their dismal form had left them 14th, three points above the relegation zone, with Emery's predecessor Steven Gerrard dismissed. However, just over a year later, Villa have the chance to go top should they extend their record home run to 16 matches with a win over the Blades, live on talkSPORT . Emery's men are bidding to be the first crop of Villa players to be top of the table since January 8, 1999, after at least 18 matches played. Villa playing on Friday, a day before Liverpool take on Arsenal, means the club are guaranteed to be top overnight with a victory. The last time that happened was 25 years ago when Villa ironically beat Sheffield United 's neighbours Wednesday 2-1 to go top. England manager Gareth Southgate opened the scoring that day before a late winner from Ugo Ehiogu overcame the Owls. Villa ultimately limped to a sixth-placed finish after racking up just 16 more points in their final 18 league matches as Manchester United ultimately won the title. While it seems highly unlikely considering their form that Villa would suffer a similar fate this time, Emery has offered a word of warning. Emery said: \"I am focusing with [the players] every match we are facing trying to analyse the three points we are facing. Of course, I spoke when we lost in Newcastle 5-1, when we were losing in Liverpool 3-0, losing in Nottingham Forest 2-0, I was speaking about the same idea. \"We are building a team and we are trying to get better with each match with the players we have. We have to be demanding to improve and we are trying to build a team. \"We are in this process and it is not stopping. We are getting points, we are deserving to be there. The idea is to try and keep it. \"My challenges in front are the next matches in front and then how we can face against teams being consistent against teams who are contenders for the top seven.\"","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:32:51","image_url":"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/douglas-luiz-aston-villa-celebrates-848988969.jpg?strip=all&w=960","source_id":"talksport","source_priority":4624,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"40d2cbd250ee43bcad425d3b1c2f2209","title":"Florida State board approves lawsuit against ACC, challenging contract that binds school to league","link":"https://www.wfla.com/sports/college-sports/florida-state-board-approves-lawsuit-against-acc-challenging-contract-that-binds-school-to-league/","keywords":["College Sports","AP Sports","AP Top Headlines","AP Top News","Florida","Mobile","News","Outdoor Sports","Sports","Top Stories","Top Videos","Video"],"creator":["Ralph D.

Florida State outside counsel David Ashburn said a lawsuit was ready to be filed that claims the ACC’s grant of rights violates antitrust law and has unenforceable withdrawal penalties. Ashburn said it would cost a school $572 million to withdraw from the conference. The lawsuit also accuses the ACC of breach of contract and violation of public policy. Florida State is looking for a way out of the conference it has been a member of since 1992 because it believes the ACC is locked into an undervalued and unusually lengthy media rights deal with ESPN that runs through 2036. The school leaders also say the league refuses to change its revenue distribution model to match FSU’s value. Florida State leaders have been pushing for unequal distribution of revenue for more than a year. “It’s time for us to try to do something about it,” Florida State President Richard McCullough said. McCullough said the trustees’ approval of the legal challenge was not a direct reaction to Florida State recently being left out of the College Football Playoff, despite having an undefeated record. “This is not a reaction, but something we’ve done a lot of due diligence on,” he said. The ACC has agreed to create a bonus system that would direct more revenue to schools that have postseason success in football and basketball. It did not immediately comment on Friday’s decision.","pubDate":"2023-12-22 16:31:16","image_url":"https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2023/12/fsu-acc.jpg?w=900","source_id":"wfla","source_priority":4217,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"79c75bfbf5c2fa0a2a1657fbb28b6500","title":"Manchester United takeover timeline amid Sir Jim Ratcliffe's imminent arrival","link":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-takeover-timeline-amid-28338895","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@men-news.co.uk (Jack Flintham)"],"video_url":null,"description":"INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 25 per cent acquisition of Manchester United is close to being officially announced","content":"Manchester United have been in limbo for more than a year while the Glazers have carried out their strategic review but, just in time for Christmas , there are some positive reports about the takeover saga being completed. In November, Sir Jim Ratcliffe distanced himself as the favourite to purchase a minority stake in United after Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al-Thani withdrew from the process. Richard Arnold's departure as CEO during that month's international break was seen by many as a precursor for INEOS' imminent arrival. However, delays in the process let the saga drag on further, but fresh reports from The Times suggest a deal could be completed by Christmas with some murmurings suggesting it may have been rubber stamped on Friday afternoon. Here's how the next few weeks might look. READ MORE: Ratcliffe investment could be 'completed by Christmas' READ MORE: Howe breaks silence on United's Ashworth interest When will Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal be done? The suggestion is Ratcliffe could arrive before Christmas. However, with Christmas Day coming on Monday, it seems unlikely he will be at Carrington until the New Year. An official announcement could be saved until January 2 onwards which will set off a chain of events. When does the New York Stock Exchange need to be told? Before any official announcement by the club, the Glazers are required by the stock market to notify the NYSE at least 10 minutes before a press release, as per their regulations. When will the Premier League ratify the deal? Once United have announced Ratcliffe's intended arrival, the Premier League will need to ratify the deal. This could take up to eight weeks to confirm as the British billionaire is subjected to the Owners and Directors' test. What is the Owners and Directors' test? This test, which is colloquially referred to as the 'fit and proper persons' test', is used by the Premier League to assess whether a new owner or director has the necessary funds and is of the right calibre to take on a role in the boardroom. Critics of the test have argued it is not stringent enough but the top flight has made changes to attempt to make it stricter. What does this mean for January? Ultimately, the delays to Ratcliffe's arrival mean January is unlikely to be a groundbreaking month for INEOS or United. The window opens on January 1 and shall shut at 11pm on January 31. Even if Ratcliffe was to be confirmed today, there would be no time to get him ratified before the market shut. Had INEOS been in post sooner, there was no guarantees of big spending due to the club's perilous Financial Fair Play situation. Therefore, we can expect more outgoings than incomings next month.

The team then added on X, formerly known as Twitter : 'Welcome to the Miami dream.' Suarez joins the MLS club following his departure from Brazilian side Gremio earlier this month. 'I'm very happy and excited to take on this new challenge with Inter Miami,' Suarez said. 'I can't wait to get started, and I'm ready to work to make the dream of winning more titles with this great club a reality. Inter Miami has confirmed the arrival of former Barcelona striker Luis Suarez to MLS 'I'm optimistic about what we can achieve together with our shared ambition,' said Suarez The 36-year-old - a European and five-time LaLiga champion - has signed a one-year deal 'I'm optimistic about what we can achieve together with our shared ambition,' said Suarez.

Earlier this week, meanwhile, the Miami Herald reported that the club traded its No 3 draft pick in the MLS SuperDraft for FC Dallas ' No 15 selection and $300,000 in general allocation money. Those funds are expected to go towards paying Suarez's salary. Inter Miami first hinted at the signing after waiving forward Josef Martinez at the end of the 2023 season. The club is also expected to sign winger Julian Gressel from the newly-crowned MLS Champions Columbus Crew , per the Miami Herald.

Mauricio Pochettino's side haven't had the ideal opening half of the season, with his team currently sat in 10th place, six points off the top seven and 12 points off the top four. The Blues' home form of late has been encouraging though, with the West London side winning four of their last five matches at Stamford Bridge, the only blip on that record being a draw against defending league champions Man City who were top of the league at the time. Making the trip to the Bridge on Wednesday is a Crystal Palace side who have found wins hard to come by in recent months, having only picked up one of them in their 12 matches since September. Performances have slowly been on the up though after a run of four defeats in five matches, drawing their last two games, notably coming back from two goals down to snatch a draw at the Etihad Stadium last weekend before a 1-1 draw with Brighton on Thursday. Roy Hodgson's still haven't picked up a win in their last eight matches though, a run which has seen them fall to 15th in the table, though still with a nine point lead over the bottom three, and are only four points off their opponents on Wednesday night.
