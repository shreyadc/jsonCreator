Cu Sarr și Bissouma plecați la Cupa Africii pe Națiuni, Hojbjerg pe picior de plcare, Betancur pe ultima sută de metri spre recuperarea după accidentare și Lo Celso incert, Tottenham vrea să aducă și un mijlocaș în această iarnă. Potrivit Football London , pe lista britanicilor se află Conor Gallagher de la Chelsea, Ezequiel Fernandez de la Boca Juniors, Ismael Yuksek de la Fenerbahce, Kalvin Phillips de la Manchester City și Joshua Kimmich de la Bayern Munchen. Rămâne de văzut dacă Spurs va reuși să ajungă la un acord cu vreunul dintre jucătorii menționați anterior, având în vedere că țintele sunt destul greu de atins. Radu Drăgușin, al 16-lea român din Premier League și al patrulea din istoria lui Tottenham Genoa și Tottenham au bătut palma pentru transferul românului, care se face pentru o sumă care poate ajunge cu tot cu bonusuri la 30 de milioane de euro, iar Radu Drăgușin va încasa un salariu enorm , de 2.8 milioane de euro pe an, scrie jurnalistul Nicolo Schira.

Confirmation of Dragusin's switch to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is expected to arrive in the coming hours, and he will become Spurs' second signing of the winter window after RB Leipzig loanee Timo Werner . Postecoglou made no secret of his desire to bolster his backline in January, having seen both of Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven sidelined by hamstring problems, sometimes forcing him to deploy a rearguard quartet comprising only full-backs. According to The Independent , Postecoglou is now keen to welcome another lynchpin to the club this month after obtaining his key defensive and attacking targets, having lost Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr to Africa Cup of Nations call-ups. © Reuters The long-term future of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is also unclear after he was bumped down the midfield pecking order by the aforementioned duo, but an exit in January is not expected to come to fruition given Juventus' decision to withdraw their interest. Nevertheless, Postecoglou is supposedly still hoping to beef up his engine room with a number eight in the coming weeks, and Chelsea's Conor Gallagher remains at the top of the Australian's wishlist. The England international has assumed more responsibility at Stamford Bridge under Mauricio Pochettino , often wearing the captain's armband in the absence of Reece James and starting 19 Premier League matches this term. However, Gallagher has now entered the final 18 months of his Chelsea contract, putting the Blues at risk of losing him on a free transfer in 2025 unless they accept an offer in the next couple of windows. Pochettino recently confirmed that he has held discussions with Gallagher over his future at Stamford Bridge, but his contract situation remains unchanged, and Chelsea are supposedly open to offers of around the £50m mark. © Reuters Pochettino himself is supposedly reluctant to lose Gallagher given how well he has adapted to the Argentine's 4-3-3 setup, and Tottenham are said to have a cheaper alternative option in mind. A separate report from Football Insider claims that the Lilywhites have their eye on 19-year-old Blackburn Rovers midfielder Adam Wharton , who has one goal and three assists to show from 24 Championship fixtures in the centre of the park this season. Blackburn tied Wharton down to a new contract until 2028 only a month ago, but the second-tier side are reportedly willing to accept bids of between £10m and £15m for the teenager in the summer window. However, Blackburn have no intention of parting ways with Wharton before the end of January, although Rovers may find it difficult to resist a lucrative offer from a Premier League outfit. Spurs boss Postecoglou apparently wants a new midfielder to arrive at Hotspur Way in between Sunday's clash with Manchester United and their fourth-round FA Cup showdown with Manchester City, which takes place on January 27.","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:23:05","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/51/ange-postecoglou.JPG","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"f35caff434210c7ff80d789f8f1a123d","title":"Diễn biến vụ Christensen đến Man Utd","link":"https://www.bongda.com.vn/dien-bien-vu-christensen-den-man-utd-d716226.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Trao đổi với Football Insider, ký giả Pete O'Rourke đã mang đến những thông tin đáng chú ý xoay quanh thương vụ tiềm năng của Manchester United.","content":"Theo tiết lộ từ Pete O'Rourke, thực sự đang quan tâm đến Andreas Christensen, nhưng Jean Clair-Todibo vẫn được xem là mục tiêu hàng đầu để củng cố vị trí trung vệ của Quỷ đỏ.

She will take up a job with Norway, it has been confirmed. The news comes after a difficult period for Grainger's side, who suffered heavy defeats in the Nations League against Denmark and Germany last year during a run of eight matches without a win. Grainger will become head coach at former world champions Norway. Grainger was appointed Wales boss in March 2021, spending nearly three years in the role, and guided the team to the brink of qualification for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, missing out to a last-minute defeat in the play-off final against Switzerland. Grainger’s final match in charge of the National Team was a 0-0 draw in the UEFA Women’s Nations League against Germany at Swansea .com Stadium in December. Noel Mooney, FAW Chief Executive, said: “I would like to place on record our sincere gratitude for what Gemma has achieved during her time as Cymru National Team Manager. She worked incredibly hard with all of us at the FAW to provide the best possible environment for the Women’s National Team to be successful. “We are really happy that we have progressed well under Gemma and now, we enter a period of recruitment for a new manager that will give us the best opportunity to qualify for UEFA EURO 2025 and the 2027 FIFA World Cup.” Grainger added: “Over the last three years I have given my heart and soul to our journey, and I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to work with this team and proud nation. It has been an honour and a privilege to work with this group of players and staff, and to represent a nation that has supported the team with incredible pride and passion. “I had no intention to leave Cymru, but I have been offered an unexpected opportunity that I could not turn down and it has been extremely difficult for me to get to this point. I hope you know the decision to leave has not been taken lightly. “I truly believe this team is ready to take the next steps and qualify. I’m confident the team can continue to build and grow from this point forward. “Cymru will forever have a place in my heart, diolch am bopeth.”","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:18:04","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article24954885.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS276681792.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","source_priority":16103,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"36bc5ea3d5b6b8e65e5a58578a67c2cd","title":"Κηφισιά: Χωρίς Μποτία, Τεττέι και Λαντρ με Ολυμπιακό","link":"https://www.gazzetta.gr/football/superleague/2292845/kifisia-horis-mpotia-tettei-kai-lantr-me-olympiako","keywords":["ποδόσφαιρο","superleague","ολυμπιακός","κηφισιά","βασίλης μπαλατσός"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"O Ντέιβιντ Νίλσεν δεν μπορεί να υπολογίζει στους Ανδρέα Τεττέι, Αλμπέρτο Μποτία και Λόικ Λαντρ για την αναμέτρηση της Κηφισιάς με τον Ολυμπιακό (14/1, 17:00).","content":"Δυο ποδοσφαιριστές της Κηφισιάς αποκόμισαν προβλήματα τραυματισμών στην εκτός έδρας αναμέτρηση με τον Πανσερραϊκό .

The post ’No way’: Celtic told Brendan Rodgers didn’t agree to 23-year-old's signing, he could now leave appeared first on HITC.","content":"Who would have thought that Liam Scales, on-loan at Aberdeen last season, would be one of Celtic’s most important players by the New Year and partnering Stephen Welsh against Rangers?! Well, whilst two separate injuries to Cameron Carter-Vickers have played a part in that, the disappointment of summer arrivals, such as and Maik Nawrocki is another reason. Kenny Miller says there is ‘no way’ accepted or was the one who signed the Sweden international for in the summer, as he told . If you recall, Gustaf Lagerbielke did start Celtic’s 1-0 win at Ibrox at the start of the campaign, but he did look fishy and has hardly played since. , which raises the question as to who allowed this signing to happen. If it was Brendan Rodgers, then surely the Celtic boss would have given the 23-year-old time to prove himself, but as Kenny Miller alluded to, that’s clearly not the case. Gustaf Lagerbielke and Brendan Rodgers “Three centre-backs have come in and I know there have been an injury to Nawrocki,” said Miller. “But three centre-backs have come in during the summer and none of them have played effectively. You went to two academy products in an Old Firm game, with Scales and Welsh. “Lagerbielke from the Old Firm game at Ibrox. I thought he looked really, really dodgy. He didn’t look up to it. Scales was his partner that day, he was the one who looked like the steady chip. “There is no way Brendan Rodgers signed him. No way that Brendan Rodgers signed the player five months ago and now he’s not good enough. “If you have signed him, and you believe he could be this player, then you don’t write it off that quickly.” Will Brendan Rodgers be backed? For a while now, the Northern Irishman has spoken about Celtic needing quality and hoping for proven players to come through the doors. It’s still early days, but from an incoming standpoint, it has been a fairly quiet January transfer window so far. Perhaps when players return to action, that’s when things will start to kick off, or as it typically happens, during the last few days of the window. If you are going to bring a manager like Rodgers back to the club, especially given what he won in his first spell, then there is no need to mess about, just back him properly, let him bring in who he wants and get on with it!","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:15:00","image_url":"https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1569529607-1024x617.jpg","source_id":"hitc","source_priority":768,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"99ddccb01ea56fec9fdbd0c4d12d02fc","title":"Juventus put price tag on Kean loan deal","link":"https://football-italia.net/juventus-put-price-tag-on-kean-loan-deal/","keywords":["latest","juventus","latest transfers","news","newsnow","transfer market"],"creator":["Apollo Heyes"],"video_url":null,"description":"Juventus have agreed to let Moise Kean leave on loan this month and have figures...","content":"have agreed to let Moise Kean leave on loan this month and have figures in mind after receiving interest from and Monza.

And why on earth was referee Michael Oliver in the away end? It's All Kicking Off By David Wood for MailOnline Published: 18:13, 10 January 2024 | Updated: 18:13, 10 January 2024 e-mail View comments Newcastle have had an enquiry about Dominic Solanke rebuffed as Bournemouth do not want to sell him this month, according to the Telegraph . Newcastle manager and former Cherries boss Eddie Howe is a long-standing admirer of Solanke, having brought him to the Vitality Stadium. The 26-year-old was signed from Liverpool five years ago in a £19 million deal and Bournemouth would stand to make a huge profit on their investment, but are determined to keep him until at least the summer. Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola is also reluctant to sanction a deal with forwards Dango Ouattara and Antoine Semenyo at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bournemouth are 'bracing themselves for bids' from top Premier League sides given his excellent form this season. Newcastle have reportedly had an enquiry about Dominic Solanke rebuffed by Bournemouth Newcastle boss Eddie Howe signed Solanke in 2019 when he was manager at Bournemouth Your browser does not support iframes. Tottenham are reportedly keeping a close eye on Solanke, with the club still on the lookout for a replacement for Harry Kane . The club have not signed a replacement for the England captain since his £100m move to Bayern Munich. Solanke has been in excellent form for the Cherries this season, scoring 11 Premier League goals, including a hat-trick during their dramatic 3-2 win over Nottingham Forest at the weekend. The club have been watching Solanke throughout the season, with scouts to continue monitoring him into the New Year - ahead of a potential summer move. Liverpool could benefit from any move for Solanke as it's believed they have a 20 per cent sell-on clause from their £24m sale of the striker back in 2019. Solanke has taken time to find his feet in the Premier League after struggling to make the mark at Chelsea and then Liverpool.

Cu Sarr și Bissouma plecați la Cupa Africii pe Națiuni, Hojbjerg pe picior de plcare, Betancur pe ultima sută de metri spre recuperarea după accidentare și Lo Celso incert, Tottenham vrea să aducă și un mijlocaș în această iarnă. Potrivit Football London , pe lista britanicilor se află Conor Gallagher de la Chelsea, Ezequiel Fernandez de la Boca Juniors, Ismael Yuksek de la Fenerbahce, Kalvin Phillips de la Manchester City și Joshua Kimmich de la Bayern Munchen. Rămâne de văzut dacă Spurs va reuși să ajungă la un acord cu vreunul dintre jucătorii menționați anterior, având în vedere că țintele sunt destul greu de atins. Radu Drăgușin, al 16-lea român din Premier League și al patrulea din istoria lui Tottenham Genoa și Tottenham au bătut palma pentru transferul românului, care se face pentru o sumă care poate ajunge cu tot cu bonusuri la 30 de milioane de euro, iar Radu Drăgușin va încasa un salariu enorm , de 2.8 milioane de euro pe an, scrie jurnalistul Nicolo Schira. Contractul pe care Radu Drăgușin îl va semna în cursul zilei de miercuri, 10 ianuarie, se întinde până la 30 iunie 2029. Fundașul în vârstă de 21 de ani va deveni astfel al patrulea român din istoria lui Tottenham, după Gică Popescu, Ilie Dumitrescu și Vlad Chiricheș. Totodată, Drăgușin este al 16-lea conațional care va juca în Premier League. În galeria FOTO de mai jos sunt prezentați toți românii care au evoluat în primul eșalon englez.

Confirmation of Dragusin's switch to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is expected to arrive in the coming hours, and he will become Spurs' second signing of the winter window after RB Leipzig loanee Timo Werner . Postecoglou made no secret of his desire to bolster his backline in January, having seen both of Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven sidelined by hamstring problems, sometimes forcing him to deploy a rearguard quartet comprising only full-backs. According to The Independent , Postecoglou is now keen to welcome another lynchpin to the club this month after obtaining his key defensive and attacking targets, having lost Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr to Africa Cup of Nations call-ups. © Reuters The long-term future of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is also unclear after he was bumped down the midfield pecking order by the aforementioned duo, but an exit in January is not expected to come to fruition given Juventus' decision to withdraw their interest. Nevertheless, Postecoglou is supposedly still hoping to beef up his engine room with a number eight in the coming weeks, and Chelsea's Conor Gallagher remains at the top of the Australian's wishlist. The England international has assumed more responsibility at Stamford Bridge under Mauricio Pochettino , often wearing the captain's armband in the absence of Reece James and starting 19 Premier League matches this term. However, Gallagher has now entered the final 18 months of his Chelsea contract, putting the Blues at risk of losing him on a free transfer in 2025 unless they accept an offer in the next couple of windows. Pochettino recently confirmed that he has held discussions with Gallagher over his future at Stamford Bridge, but his contract situation remains unchanged, and Chelsea are supposedly open to offers of around the £50m mark. © Reuters Pochettino himself is supposedly reluctant to lose Gallagher given how well he has adapted to the Argentine's 4-3-3 setup, and Tottenham are said to have a cheaper alternative option in mind. A separate report from Football Insider claims that the Lilywhites have their eye on 19-year-old Blackburn Rovers midfielder Adam Wharton , who has one goal and three assists to show from 24 Championship fixtures in the centre of the park this season. Blackburn tied Wharton down to a new contract until 2028 only a month ago, but the second-tier side are reportedly willing to accept bids of between £10m and £15m for the teenager in the summer window. However, Blackburn have no intention of parting ways with Wharton before the end of January, although Rovers may find it difficult to resist a lucrative offer from a Premier League outfit. Spurs boss Postecoglou apparently wants a new midfielder to arrive at Hotspur Way in between Sunday's clash with Manchester United and their fourth-round FA Cup showdown with Manchester City, which takes place on January 27.","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:23:05","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/51/ange-postecoglou.JPG","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"f35caff434210c7ff80d789f8f1a123d","title":"Diễn biến vụ Christensen đến Man Utd","link":"https://www.bongda.com.vn/dien-bien-vu-christensen-den-man-utd-d716226.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Trao đổi với Football Insider, ký giả Pete O'Rourke đã mang đến những thông tin đáng chú ý xoay quanh thương vụ tiềm năng của Manchester United.","content":"Theo tiết lộ từ Pete O'Rourke, thực sự đang quan tâm đến Andreas Christensen, nhưng Jean Clair-Todibo vẫn được xem là mục tiêu hàng đầu để củng cố vị trí trung vệ của Quỷ đỏ.

She will take up a job with Norway, it has been confirmed. The news comes after a difficult period for Grainger's side, who suffered heavy defeats in the Nations League against Denmark and Germany last year during a run of eight matches without a win. Grainger will become head coach at former world champions Norway. Grainger was appointed Wales boss in March 2021, spending nearly three years in the role, and guided the team to the brink of qualification for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, missing out to a last-minute defeat in the play-off final against Switzerland. Grainger’s final match in charge of the National Team was a 0-0 draw in the UEFA Women’s Nations League against Germany at Swansea .com Stadium in December. Noel Mooney, FAW Chief Executive, said: “I would like to place on record our sincere gratitude for what Gemma has achieved during her time as Cymru National Team Manager. She worked incredibly hard with all of us at the FAW to provide the best possible environment for the Women’s National Team to be successful. “We are really happy that we have progressed well under Gemma and now, we enter a period of recruitment for a new manager that will give us the best opportunity to qualify for UEFA EURO 2025 and the 2027 FIFA World Cup.” Grainger added: “Over the last three years I have given my heart and soul to our journey, and I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to work with this team and proud nation. It has been an honour and a privilege to work with this group of players and staff, and to represent a nation that has supported the team with incredible pride and passion. “I had no intention to leave Cymru, but I have been offered an unexpected opportunity that I could not turn down and it has been extremely difficult for me to get to this point. I hope you know the decision to leave has not been taken lightly. “I truly believe this team is ready to take the next steps and qualify. I’m confident the team can continue to build and grow from this point forward. “Cymru will forever have a place in my heart, diolch am bopeth.”","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:18:04","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article24954885.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS276681792.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","source_priority":16103,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"36bc5ea3d5b6b8e65e5a58578a67c2cd","title":"Κηφισιά: Χωρίς Μποτία, Τεττέι και Λαντρ με Ολυμπιακό","link":"https://www.gazzetta.gr/football/superleague/2292845/kifisia-horis-mpotia-tettei-kai-lantr-me-olympiako","keywords":["ποδόσφαιρο","superleague","ολυμπιακός","κηφισιά","βασίλης μπαλατσός"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"O Ντέιβιντ Νίλσεν δεν μπορεί να υπολογίζει στους Ανδρέα Τεττέι, Αλμπέρτο Μποτία και Λόικ Λαντρ για την αναμέτρηση της Κηφισιάς με τον Ολυμπιακό (14/1, 17:00).","content":"Δυο ποδοσφαιριστές της Κηφισιάς αποκόμισαν προβλήματα τραυματισμών στην εκτός έδρας αναμέτρηση με τον Πανσερραϊκό .

Who would have thought that Liam Scales, on-loan... The post ’No way’: Celtic told Brendan Rodgers didn’t agree to 23-year-old's signing, he could now leave appeared first on HITC.","content":"Who would have thought that Liam Scales, on-loan at Aberdeen last season, would be one of Celtic’s most important players by the New Year and partnering Stephen Welsh against Rangers?! Well, whilst two separate injuries to Cameron Carter-Vickers have played a part in that, the disappointment of summer arrivals, such as and Maik Nawrocki is another reason. Kenny Miller says there is ‘no way’ accepted or was the one who signed the Sweden international for in the summer, as he told . If you recall, Gustaf Lagerbielke did start Celtic’s 1-0 win at Ibrox at the start of the campaign, but he did look fishy and has hardly played since. , which raises the question as to who allowed this signing to happen. If it was Brendan Rodgers, then surely the Celtic boss would have given the 23-year-old time to prove himself, but as Kenny Miller alluded to, that’s clearly not the case. Gustaf Lagerbielke and Brendan Rodgers “Three centre-backs have come in and I know there have been an injury to Nawrocki,” said Miller. “But three centre-backs have come in during the summer and none of them have played effectively. You went to two academy products in an Old Firm game, with Scales and Welsh. “Lagerbielke from the Old Firm game at Ibrox. I thought he looked really, really dodgy. He didn’t look up to it. Scales was his partner that day, he was the one who looked like the steady chip. “There is no way Brendan Rodgers signed him. No way that Brendan Rodgers signed the player five months ago and now he’s not good enough. “If you have signed him, and you believe he could be this player, then you don’t write it off that quickly.” Will Brendan Rodgers be backed? For a while now, the Northern Irishman has spoken about Celtic needing quality and hoping for proven players to come through the doors. It’s still early days, but from an incoming standpoint, it has been a fairly quiet January transfer window so far. Perhaps when players return to action, that’s when things will start to kick off, or as it typically happens, during the last few days of the window.

And why on earth was referee Michael Oliver in the away end? It's All Kicking Off By David Wood for MailOnline Published: 18:13, 10 January 2024 | Updated: 18:13, 10 January 2024 e-mail View comments Newcastle have had an enquiry about Dominic Solanke rebuffed as Bournemouth do not want to sell him this month, according to the Telegraph . Newcastle manager and former Cherries boss Eddie Howe is a long-standing admirer of Solanke, having brought him to the Vitality Stadium. The 26-year-old was signed from Liverpool five years ago in a £19 million deal and Bournemouth would stand to make a huge profit on their investment, but are determined to keep him until at least the summer. Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola is also reluctant to sanction a deal with forwards Dango Ouattara and Antoine Semenyo at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bournemouth are 'bracing themselves for bids' from top Premier League sides given his excellent form this season. Newcastle have reportedly had an enquiry about Dominic Solanke rebuffed by Bournemouth Newcastle boss Eddie Howe signed Solanke in 2019 when he was manager at Bournemouth Your browser does not support iframes. Tottenham are reportedly keeping a close eye on Solanke, with the club still on the lookout for a replacement for Harry Kane . The club have not signed a replacement for the England captain since his £100m move to Bayern Munich. Solanke has been in excellent form for the Cherries this season, scoring 11 Premier League goals, including a hat-trick during their dramatic 3-2 win over Nottingham Forest at the weekend. The club have been watching Solanke throughout the season, with scouts to continue monitoring him into the New Year - ahead of a potential summer move. Liverpool could benefit from any move for Solanke as it's believed they have a 20 per cent sell-on clause from their £24m sale of the striker back in 2019. Solanke has taken time to find his feet in the Premier League after struggling to make the mark at Chelsea and then Liverpool. Those struggles continued at Bournemouth as he scored just four goals in his first full Premier League season with the club. However, he scored 45 goals across two seasons in the Championship, and has netted more goals this season than he did last (six) in the top flight.

Cu Sarr și Bissouma plecați la Cupa Africii pe Națiuni, Hojbjerg pe picior de plcare, Betancur pe ultima sută de metri spre recuperarea după accidentare și Lo Celso incert, Tottenham vrea să aducă și un mijlocaș în această iarnă. Potrivit Football London , pe lista britanicilor se află Conor Gallagher de la Chelsea, Ezequiel Fernandez de la Boca Juniors, Ismael Yuksek de la Fenerbahce, Kalvin Phillips de la Manchester City și Joshua Kimmich de la Bayern Munchen. Rămâne de văzut dacă Spurs va reuși să ajungă la un acord cu vreunul dintre jucătorii menționați anterior, având în vedere că țintele sunt destul greu de atins. Radu Drăgușin, al 16-lea român din Premier League și al patrulea din istoria lui Tottenham Genoa și Tottenham au bătut palma pentru transferul românului, care se face pentru o sumă care poate ajunge cu tot cu bonusuri la 30 de milioane de euro, iar Radu Drăgușin va încasa un salariu enorm , de 2.8 milioane de euro pe an, scrie jurnalistul Nicolo Schira.

Confirmation of Dragusin's switch to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is expected to arrive in the coming hours, and he will become Spurs' second signing of the winter window after RB Leipzig loanee Timo Werner . Postecoglou made no secret of his desire to bolster his backline in January, having seen both of Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven sidelined by hamstring problems, sometimes forcing him to deploy a rearguard quartet comprising only full-backs. According to The Independent , Postecoglou is now keen to welcome another lynchpin to the club this month after obtaining his key defensive and attacking targets, having lost Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr to Africa Cup of Nations call-ups. © Reuters The long-term future of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is also unclear after he was bumped down the midfield pecking order by the aforementioned duo, but an exit in January is not expected to come to fruition given Juventus' decision to withdraw their interest. Nevertheless, Postecoglou is supposedly still hoping to beef up his engine room with a number eight in the coming weeks, and Chelsea's Conor Gallagher remains at the top of the Australian's wishlist. The England international has assumed more responsibility at Stamford Bridge under Mauricio Pochettino , often wearing the captain's armband in the absence of Reece James and starting 19 Premier League matches this term. However, Gallagher has now entered the final 18 months of his Chelsea contract, putting the Blues at risk of losing him on a free transfer in 2025 unless they accept an offer in the next couple of windows. Pochettino recently confirmed that he has held discussions with Gallagher over his future at Stamford Bridge, but his contract situation remains unchanged, and Chelsea are supposedly open to offers of around the £50m mark. © Reuters Pochettino himself is supposedly reluctant to lose Gallagher given how well he has adapted to the Argentine's 4-3-3 setup, and Tottenham are said to have a cheaper alternative option in mind. A separate report from Football Insider claims that the Lilywhites have their eye on 19-year-old Blackburn Rovers midfielder Adam Wharton , who has one goal and three assists to show from 24 Championship fixtures in the centre of the park this season. Blackburn tied Wharton down to a new contract until 2028 only a month ago, but the second-tier side are reportedly willing to accept bids of between £10m and £15m for the teenager in the summer window. However, Blackburn have no intention of parting ways with Wharton before the end of January, although Rovers may find it difficult to resist a lucrative offer from a Premier League outfit. Spurs boss Postecoglou apparently wants a new midfielder to arrive at Hotspur Way in between Sunday's clash with Manchester United and their fourth-round FA Cup showdown with Manchester City, which takes place on January 27.","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:23:05","image_url":"https://sm.imgix.net/23/51/ange-postecoglou.JPG","source_id":"sportsmole","source_priority":3238,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"f35caff434210c7ff80d789f8f1a123d","title":"Diễn biến vụ Christensen đến Man Utd","link":"https://www.bongda.com.vn/dien-bien-vu-christensen-den-man-utd-d716226.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Trao đổi với Football Insider, ký giả Pete O'Rourke đã mang đến những thông tin đáng chú ý xoay quanh thương vụ tiềm năng của Manchester United.","content":"Theo tiết lộ từ Pete O'Rourke, thực sự đang quan tâm đến Andreas Christensen, nhưng Jean Clair-Todibo vẫn được xem là mục tiêu hàng đầu để củng cố vị trí trung vệ của Quỷ đỏ.

She worked incredibly hard with all of us at the FAW to provide the best possible environment for the Women’s National Team to be successful. “We are really happy that we have progressed well under Gemma and now, we enter a period of recruitment for a new manager that will give us the best opportunity to qualify for UEFA EURO 2025 and the 2027 FIFA World Cup.” Grainger added: “Over the last three years I have given my heart and soul to our journey, and I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to work with this team and proud nation. It has been an honour and a privilege to work with this group of players and staff, and to represent a nation that has supported the team with incredible pride and passion. “I had no intention to leave Cymru, but I have been offered an unexpected opportunity that I could not turn down and it has been extremely difficult for me to get to this point. I hope you know the decision to leave has not been taken lightly. “I truly believe this team is ready to take the next steps and qualify.

Well, whilst two separate injuries to Cameron Carter-Vickers have played a part in that, the disappointment of summer arrivals, such as and Maik Nawrocki is another reason. Kenny Miller says there is ‘no way’ accepted or was the one who signed the Sweden international for in the summer, as he told . If you recall, Gustaf Lagerbielke did start Celtic’s 1-0 win at Ibrox at the start of the campaign, but he did look fishy and has hardly played since. , which raises the question as to who allowed this signing to happen. If it was Brendan Rodgers, then surely the Celtic boss would have given the 23-year-old time to prove himself, but as Kenny Miller alluded to, that’s clearly not the case. Gustaf Lagerbielke and Brendan Rodgers “Three centre-backs have come in and I know there have been an injury to Nawrocki,” said Miller. “But three centre-backs have come in during the summer and none of them have played effectively. You went to two academy products in an Old Firm game, with Scales and Welsh. “Lagerbielke from the Old Firm game at Ibrox. I thought he looked really, really dodgy. He didn’t look up to it. Scales was his partner that day, he was the one who looked like the steady chip. “There is no way Brendan Rodgers signed him. No way that Brendan Rodgers signed the player five months ago and now he’s not good enough. “If you have signed him, and you believe he could be this player, then you don’t write it off that quickly.” Will Brendan Rodgers be backed? For a while now, the Northern Irishman has spoken about Celtic needing quality and hoping for proven players to come through the doors. It’s still early days, but from an incoming standpoint, it has been a fairly quiet January transfer window so far. Perhaps when players return to action, that’s when things will start to kick off, or as it typically happens, during the last few days of the window. If you are going to bring a manager like Rodgers back to the club, especially given what he won in his first spell, then there is no need to mess about, just back him properly, let him bring in who he wants and get on with it!","pubDate":"2024-01-10 18:15:00","image_url":"https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1569529607-1024x617.jpg","source_id":"hitc","source_priority":768,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"99ddccb01ea56fec9fdbd0c4d12d02fc","title":"Juventus put price tag on Kean loan deal","link":"https://football-italia.net/juventus-put-price-tag-on-kean-loan-deal/","keywords":["latest","juventus","latest transfers","news","newsnow","transfer market"],"creator":["Apollo Heyes"],"video_url":null,"description":"Juventus have agreed to let Moise Kean leave on loan this month and have figures...","content":"have agreed to let Moise Kean leave on loan this month and have figures in mind after receiving interest from and Monza.

And why on earth was referee Michael Oliver in the away end? It's All Kicking Off By David Wood for MailOnline Published: 18:13, 10 January 2024 | Updated: 18:13, 10 January 2024 e-mail View comments Newcastle have had an enquiry about Dominic Solanke rebuffed as Bournemouth do not want to sell him this month, according to the Telegraph . Newcastle manager and former Cherries boss Eddie Howe is a long-standing admirer of Solanke, having brought him to the Vitality Stadium. The 26-year-old was signed from Liverpool five years ago in a £19 million deal and Bournemouth would stand to make a huge profit on their investment, but are determined to keep him until at least the summer. Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola is also reluctant to sanction a deal with forwards Dango Ouattara and Antoine Semenyo at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bournemouth are 'bracing themselves for bids' from top Premier League sides given his excellent form this season. Newcastle have reportedly had an enquiry about Dominic Solanke rebuffed by Bournemouth Newcastle boss Eddie Howe signed Solanke in 2019 when he was manager at Bournemouth Your browser does not support iframes. Tottenham are reportedly keeping a close eye on Solanke, with the club still on the lookout for a replacement for Harry Kane . The club have not signed a replacement for the England captain since his £100m move to Bayern Munich. Solanke has been in excellent form for the Cherries this season, scoring 11 Premier League goals, including a hat-trick during their dramatic 3-2 win over Nottingham Forest at the weekend. The club have been watching Solanke throughout the season, with scouts to continue monitoring him into the New Year - ahead of a potential summer move. Liverpool could benefit from any move for Solanke as it's believed they have a 20 per cent sell-on clause from their £24m sale of the striker back in 2019. Solanke has taken time to find his feet in the Premier League after struggling to make the mark at Chelsea and then Liverpool. Those struggles continued at Bournemouth as he scored just four goals in his first full Premier League season with the club. However, he scored 45 goals across two seasons in the Championship, and has netted more goals this season than he did last (six) in the top flight.
