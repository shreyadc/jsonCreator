With the 2022 World Cup drawing to a close, we are now very close to the resumption of the football season, with the Premier League kicking-off again on Boxing Day. While so much can still happen between now and the end of the season, it is hard to imagine anyone else but Arsenal or City lifting the trophy in May. After 14 games, the Gunners have a five point lead over the Citizens who in turn have two point lead over third-placed Newcastle, albeit the Magpies have played a match more than the leaders. Despite trailing, Pep Guardiola’s side are still favourites to win, having won four of the last five titles, and have developed a strong reputation for finishing the season better than how they started it. But having dropped points just twice so far this campaign, via a draw at Southampton and a defeat at Manchester United, Mikel Arteta has given Arsenal fans real hope that their club can finally end their 19-year wait for a league title. Clichy was part of that 2003/04 ‘Invincibles’ side before leaving for the Etihad in 2011 where he would win another two league titles, and he still has a strong affinity for both clubs but is especially hopeful that one emerges triumphant. Who will win the 2022/23 Premier League title: Arsenal or Man City? (Photo by Visionhaus) ‘City are really strong overall because they’ve been there for so long now,’ the former French international told talkSPORT. ‘It’s been ten years since they’ve been consistent so you can’t just put them out but I think Arsenal have got a great chance. ‘You know the next few weeks are gonna be really important and if there’s a team that can really challenge City this year, it’s them. ‘They are doing everything impeccably since the beginning of the season and I really hope they can go all the way because it’s a club that deserves and a manager that deserves to bring success to this team.’ Arsenal first match post-World Cup will be against West Ham on Boxing Day, while City travel to Leeds 48 hours later. As for Clichy, the left-back is still going strong at 37, currently winding down his career at Swiss side Servette.

Plus, can the much-improved Jaguars upset the Cowboys?We’re in Week 15 of the NFL season, and only the Eagles have clinched a playoff berth, while the Bears, Texans and Broncos have been eliminated from playoff contention. So 28 teams still have hopes of making the postseason tournament, and five of those teams can clinch playoff spots Sunday.Here’s a closer look at this week’s playoff-clinching scenarios: The Chiefs can clinch the AFC West title with a win against the Texans—or a Chargers loss—or a tie and a Chargers tie. They can clinch a playoff berth with a tie, plus losses by the Jets and Patriots—or a tie, plus losses by the Dolphins and Jets or a Jets tie—or a tie, plus losses by the Dolphins and Jets and a Patriots tie.The Bills can clinch a playoff berth with a win against the Dolphins—or a tie and a Chargers loss—or a tie, plus losses by the Patriots and Jets—or a tie, plus ties by the Chargers and Patriots and a Jets loss.The Cowboys can clinch a playoff berth with a win against the Jaguars—or a tie and a Giants loss—or a tie and Giants-Commanders doesn’t end in a tie—or a tie and Seahawks loss—or a Seahawks loss and Lions loss or tie—or a Seahawks loss and a Commanders loss.The Vikings can clinch the NFC North with a win or tie against the Colts—or a Detroit loss or tie.The 49ers can clinch the NFC West with a win against the Seahawks.So there are plenty of big games to focus on this week, and Albert and Conor will take you through Sunday’s slate, noting the best matchups and the story lines they’ll be watching.Games of the week Tagovailoa hasn't played in snow during his NFL career. But he could encounter a large amount of it on Saturday in Orchard Park, where the weather forecast calls for four to eight inches.Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Dolphins (8–5) at Bills (10–3), 8:15 p.m. ET Saturday: It’s gonna be cold. It’s gonna snow. And you’ve heard about it all week because it’s a team from Miami going there (spare me the crying from Floridians on cold-weather teams needing to have roofs over their stadiums). Buffalo can’t clinch the AFC East this week, but a win would eliminate the Jets and Patriots, and mean the Dolphins would have to go 3–0, and the Bills would have to go 0–3 for the division not to be theirs for a third consecutive year. Sean McDermott’s crew also seems to be coming together at a time when the Dolphins have hit a skid, with two straight losses. So everything’s screaming Bills here, which probably should have Buffalo worried. — Albert BreerLions (6–7) at Jets (7–6), 1 p.m. ET Sunday: The Jets are attempting to save their season against one of the hottest teams in the NFL. All preseason, smart folks such as colleague Richard Johnson were predicting the Lions were going to be playing meaningful snaps in January. Smart colleagues such as Gary Gramling were predicting on The MMQB podcast that Jared Goff would become a more accepted, borderline top-tier passer. It’s happening. Meanwhile, the Jets need to figure out how healthy Mike White is after a brutal, physical loss to the Bills, especially with the vulnerable Zach Wilson in the No. 2 spot. — Conor OrrCowboys (10–3) at Jaguars (5–8), 1 p.m. ET Sunday: Trevor Lawrence is playing good ball and so is the team around him—with a pretty consistent level of play, save for one off day in Detroit, over their past five games. Believe it or not, if the Titans trip up against the Chargers, and the Jags upend the Cowboys, Jacksonville will control its own destiny in the AFC South. Meanwhile, Dallas needs to keep winning to stay alive for the NFC East crown, with a showdown with 12–1 Philadelphia looming on Christmas Eve. — A.B.Patriots (7–6) at Raiders (5–8), 4:05 p.m. ET Sunday: The Belichick Bowl could have an intriguing new face: Pierre Strong, the team’s fourth-round pick out of North Dakota State. Strong looked great in a truncated workload against the Cardinals and could be one of New England’s secret weapons down the stretch. Anything to hopefully snap this offense out of the sleepwalk they’ve been on for the better part of this season. — C.0.Bengals (9–4) at Buccaneers (6–7), 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday: Joe Burrow would never say it so I will—I believe he’s the closest comp to Tom Brady to come into the league since Brady himself came to prominence two decades ago. In this case, Burrow’s got a shot to deliver a devastating blow to the Buccaneers, who are struggling to stay in front of the Falcons and Panthers in the NFC South. The status of three of Burrow’s targets this week—Tee Higgins, Tyler Boyd and Hayden Hurst—could be key to how this one plays out. — A.B.Fantasy bold prediction of the weekThe Jets defense will hold Jared Goff under 12 fantasy points. Goff has been one of the hottest quarterbacks in fantasy football, scoring a combined 47.7 points in his past two games and posting 17-plus in three consecutive contests. All of those games, however, were at Ford Field. On the road, Goff is far less productive. In fact, he’s thrown just two touchdown passes and has seven giveaways in five road games. The Jets defense has been tough on quarterbacks, so Goff could be in for a difficult day in New Jersey. — Michael Fabiano• Fabiano’s Week 15 Start ’Em, Sit ’Em: QB | RB | WR | TE | K/DSTKey questions After his amazing comeback on Thursday Night Football, there isn't any doubt that playing for McVay might be best for Mayfield.Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports What is your one big prediction for Week 15?Orr: Desmond Ridder scores three touchdowns against the Saints. We’re all expecting the third-round pick to flounder, but what if he’s…fine? Sure, New Orleans’ defense is great and has been torturous on young quarterbacks in the past, but what if Ridder playing on schedule unlocks some of the skill-position talent on this roster? Breer: Derek Carr will throw for 300 yards and a triple-digit passer rating on a really strong Patriots defense. Josh McDaniels knows the New England defensive scheme inside and out, and its personnel, too. And as such, I think he’s going to generate matchups for Davante Adams, and space for Josh Jacobs, two things that’ll add up to Carr being set up to play an efficient, strong game.Which team most needs a win in Week 15?Orr: The Browns. Cleveland’s offense has looked so overwhelmingly pedestrian since they made a quarterback change three weeks ago. While anyone needs time to adjust to the speed of the NFL, the Browns will need to see glimpses of the reason they altered the course of their franchise for Deshaun Watson. Beating the Texans with special teams and defensive touchdowns doesn’t count. Breer: The Titans. Tennessee has lost three in a row, and its offensive coordinator Todd Downing got a DUI after the team’s win against the Packers. General manager Jon Robinson got fired, and big picture questions are being asked. A loss opens the door for the Jags to steal the division from Mike Vrabel’s crew down the stretch. And a win won’t be easy to come by against the Chargers in L.A. So, to me, this becomes one of two things—either a foot-in-the-ground turning point for the Titans, or a sign that the clock is starting to wind down on a proud core of veteran players in Nashville.Who are the offensive and defensive coordinators who will land head-coaching jobs in 2023?Breer: On offense, give me Philly’s Shane Steichen—the Eagles have actually prepared for that with Kevin Patullo lined up to replace him. I’d put the Bills’ Ken Dorsey and the Lions’ Ben Johnson next after Steichen. And on defense, it’s hard to not put the 49ers’ DeMeco Ryans at the top of the list. He checks a lot of boxes (very productive unit coached, ex-player, experience in a successful system, varied experience), and has the personality and temperament of a head coach built in. But he’s just one name in what’s a pretty significant backlog of qualified defensive coaches (Raheem Morris, Dan Quinn, Jerod Mayo, Vance Joseph, Jonathan Gannon, Ejiro Evero, etc., etc.) that’s built up as owners have veered towards hiring offensive guys.Orr: I’ll concur with Albert. I think Steichen is the name I’d go out on a limb for. I think Johnson, who we tabbed as a Sean McVay in the making in September, is another intriguing option. Frank Smith (Dolphins) and Kellen Moore (Cowboys) are other offensive coaches ready for a bump up the ladder. On defense, it’s all about Ryans right now. These are his jobs to lose, especially given his access to offensive coaches on Kyle Shanahan’s staff. Others to keep an eye on: Gannon, who interviewed with the Texans last year; Quinn, who had a handful of interviews as well; and Evero (Broncos) and Morris (Rams). Will Tom Brady be a starting quarterback in the NFL in 2023 or in the booth for Fox?Breer: I think this is a real toss up—I don’t think even he knows whether he’ll play. But I’ll say he will—just based on history—and he should have options if he does decide to give it a go (with the 49ers, Raiders and the Giants all potential suitors).Orr: I have always believed that Brady will never call a game for the omnivorous mammal network, or any other for that matter. I think there are too many complex wheelings and dealings for us to ever take any public move he makes at face value. As he has said publicly, he’s lying about almost everything he says in front of reporters. So how silly would we be to sit there, nod, and say, “Oh sure, yes, this is one of the three percent of times.” Where will Baker Mayfield be playing next season?Orr: The Cardinals. Should Kliff Kingsbury make it to next season, he’ll need a quarterback who knows the system and its principles. While I think Mayfield should do all he can to remain in the McVay orbit, a McVay Lite offense with familiar Air Raid flavoring would suit him well. Breer: The Rams. I think this is L.A.’s first real swing at replacing Matthew Stafford, whose arm issues and the concussion this year I believe will make him at least think about walking away. In the end, I do think Stafford will give it another year, but the uncertainty over his future, and his fit with McVay, would afford Mayfield the chance to prove he could become No. 9’s successor.Kyler Murray tore his ACL on Monday night and will likely miss significant time next season. Could we see major changes next year in Arizona? A coaching change? Maybe a new GM?Orr: With Steve Keim stepping away for health reasons, I’ll defer comment on the latter. What I will say about the former, and I have written a few times in the past, was that Kingsbury’s extension absolutely floored some people in the coaching community. I’d spoken to folks who expected that job to be open before last year, and open even with the Cardinals limping into the playoffs. Breer: I think there’s a decent chance that ownership detonates the building, so long as the Bidwills are willing to cut the checks to do so.Sunday Night Football best betWe saw these two NFC East foes tie just two weeks ago but that’s a lifetime ago by NFL standards. In the week between their first and upcoming second showdown, the Giants were dismantled by the Eagles, 48–22, while the Commanders had the week off to rest and recover. New York has either lost or tied their past four games, but they still have one of the league’s best records against the spread (9–4). The Giants are getting 4.5 points on the road in Washington where the Commanders have a 3-2-1 home record (ATS) but just a 1–3 record (ATS) against NFC East rivals. Can the Giants get back on track to save their playoff hopes? Probably not, but they will at least cover the spread. Bank the 4.5 points with Brian Daboll’s squad in Week 15.Final thoughtsOrr: These are the top five Christmas albums of all time: 1. Vince Guaraldi Trio: “A Charlie Brown Christmas”2. John Denver & The Muppets: “A Christmas Together”3. Kenny Burrell: “Have Yourself a Soulful Little Christmas”4. Barenaked Ladies: “Barenaked for the Holidays”5. “A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector” Have a nice weekend. Breer: Not sure how I top that.

What made it remarkable, and a candidate for one of the all-time great assists, is that Messi did not look up yet found Molina with preposterous perfection.It was in that game where Messi cemented his Qatari love affair with Argentine fans, who in the past have sometimes compared him harshly against Maradona's extrovert personality, passion for his country, and 1986 World Cup triumph.After scoring a penalty to send Argentine fans into delirium, the usually impeccably-behaved Messi ran towards the Dutch bench cupping his ears in a provocative gesture.Then after the game, he confronted a Dutch striker with a jibe caught on camera: \"What are you looking at, fool?\" Though some pundits criticized him for disrespect, Argentine fans were largely delighted at the Maradona-like flashes of defiance from the introverted Messi.Some have had tattoos of the phrase.\"The game against Holland was when his 'inner Maradona' finally came out. They are one. They are eternal. They are Argentina!\" said one ecstatic fan Jorge Castellanos, who was at the game with a flag depicting both men arm-in-arm.Despite such adulation, everyone knows that true immortal parity with Maradona - at least in the biggest sporting tournament on earth - does still hinge on beating the French.Many non-Argentines have long had Argentina as their second team, hoping Messi will win the World Cup if their own nation cannot to complete what would be a beautiful story.'THANKS, CAPTAIN'Messi left Argentina at 13 to join Barcelona's youth setup.Despite worries that he was too small, the new boy shone in the junior ranks before coach Frank Rijkaard gave him a senior debut at the age of 16 in a friendly against Porto in 2003.Messi went on to become Barcelona's all-time top scorer and appearance maker with 672 goals in 778 games.In one season, 2011-12, he smashed La Liga's scoring record with 50 goals. In total, he won 35 trophies with Barcelona, including 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies, before moving to Paris St Germain last year.Along the way, he won the Ballon d'Or a record seven times and FIFA Player of the Year six.For Argentina, he is the all-time top scorer and led his nation to Copa America glory last year after a 28-year trophy drought including a string of heartbreaking finals defeats.All that is missing in the Messi story is a World Cup.But even should the unthinkable happen and Argentina lose, it seems he has won over a nation that now knows Messi loved the shirt every bit as much as Maradona, brought them wondrous moments over the years, and simply could not have tried harder or come closer to lifting the World Cup.Argentine journalist Sofia Martinez Mateos summed up the mood when she ended an interview with Messi this week not with a question but with a speech on behalf of the nation.\"The final is coming and of course we all want to win, but I want to tell you that whatever the result, there is something no-one can ever take from you,\" she told a visibly moved Messi.\"You have entered the heart of every Argentine. Honestly, there's not a kid without your shirt. You have marked all our lives... Carry it in your heart because that is more important than a World Cup and you've already won that, thanks Captain.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-16 11:42:54","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/12/2022_12$largeimg_1446189763.JPG","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CAN 2025 : L'Algérie officiellement candidate","link":"https://www.dzfoot.com/divers/can-2025-lalgerie-officiellement-candidate-235901.html?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=unknown","keywords":["Divers","Algérie","CAN 2025","Candidate"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"La Fédération algérienne de football a procédé ce vendredi au dépôt officiel du dossier de candidature de l'Algérie au niveau du siège de la Confédération africaine au Caire (Egypte), pour abriter la Coupe d'Afrique des nations 2025.

L’occasion pour l’ancien défenseur de l’OM de s’en prendre à l’Albiceleste. Pour le champion du monde 2018, il serait un admirateur de Lionel Messi mais pas de l’équipe argentine. A la curiosité de savoir pourquoi il n’appréciait pas la sélection de Lionel Scaloni, selon lui, il la trouve irrespectueuse envers les adversaires pendant ce mondial disputé au Qatar. « J’aime tout de Lionel Messi… mais je n’aime pas cette équipe d’Argentine. L’image qu’elle a montrée durant cette Coupe du monde, avec beaucoup d’agressivité, de méchanceté, de non-fair-play… Sur le terrain, elle n’a pas montré une belle image », a ainsi lancé Rami.

The already packed football calendar will have to accomodate a new competition that was initially due to take place in 2021 in China, but was abandoned due to the Covid pandemic. Infantino failed to elaborate on which teams would be involved but insisted FIFA was ready to capitalise on the ever increasing popularity of the sport, highlighted by, in his words, the most successful World Cup ever in Qatar. ‘When it comes to the council meeting, we could confirm revenues of this four-year cycle – 7.5 billion,’ said Infantino. ‘Looking forward, the FIFA Council approved the budget for the next four year cycle, which will be eleven billion and almost 10 billion will go directly back to football. ‘We discussed some strategic principles. For the men, we agreed to have a new men’s Club World Cup, this will happen in 2025 and will have 32 teams, making it like this World Cup. ‘We had a Club World Cup planned in 2020 with 24 teams. It wasn’t replaced or postponed. We did that to allow for the Copa America and the Euros and protect the health and well-being of players and not overburden the calendar.’ Gianni Infantino has hailed the success of the Qatar World Cup (Picture: Getty) In order to ease the burden on footballers in the coming years, Infantino confirmed the usual September and October international windows will be combined so nations play four games across late September and early October, rather than two in each. ‘We have seen the importance of teams from different continents happening more regularly,’ said Infantino. ‘We want to use the March windows in even years to organise friendly tournaments between four teams of four different confederations under the Fifa umbrella – Fifa World Series events. ‘For women’s football, it will be very similar. We want to create a new women’s Club World Cup and a new Fifa Futsal Women’s World Cup every four years. ‘We would like to see if the women’s Olympic tournament can have 16 teams like the men’s does.’ On protecting the welfare of players, he added: ‘A very important element is we have to take into consideration is the health and well-being of players hence four-game window, rather than two-game windows. We need to make sure there is a rest period for the players. ‘We will consult on these topics and elaborate.’ MORE : Norway boss slams Arsene Wenger and claims Arsenal legend has been ‘brainwashed’ by FIFA MORE : Fifa confirms death of another migrant worker at Qatar World Cup For more stories like this, check our sport page.

Nii Otu Kwei II, who doubles as head of the Odaiteitsewe Clan of Nungua as well as the Akutsotse and Abekunane Mantse, however, tasked the Ghana Football Association (GFA), to as a matter of urgency ensure that new players - as well as those who switched nationality be-cause of the World Cup, be made to participate in the 2024 Nations Cup qualifiers. The Nations Cup tournament was scheduled to take place in June-July 2023, but was deferred to January-February 2024 - partly to avoid repeated disputes with European clubs forced to re-lease players in the middle of the season. Brighton's right-back Tariq Lamptey, Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams, Belgium-born Club Brugge defender Denis Odoi, were three of the lucky players to be at the World Cup, after switch-ing citizenship. The afore-listed players - as well as Bristol City striker Antoine Semenyo, Clermont Foot 63 de-fender Alidu Seidu, Southampton centre-back Mohammed Salisu, Club Brugge's Kamal Sowah and Lens' Salis Abdul Samed are some of the new players yet to partici-pate in the Nations Cup qualifiers. \"We have to avoid the situation where some players break their backs for the team to qualify and then invite new faces to take up their places. For me, it does not encourage team bonding. \"Besides, we can only build a formidably fearsome squad if the players are made to play consistently and learn from their mistakes,\" the divisional chief of the Nungua Tradition-al Area, asserted. Ghana share the summit of Group E on four points with Angola, after the second round of games in June. The Black Stars thrashed Madagas-car 3-0 at home and drew 1-1 with Central African Republic (CAR) away, before the quali-fiers were put on ice to enable the continent's teams prepare for the World Cup in Qatar. The third and fourth rounds of qualifying for the 2024 Cup of Nations are scheduled for March 2023 with the Stars hosting Angola in a top-of-the-table clash. Match days five and six will be held in June with the sixth day set for September.","pubDate":"2022-12-16 10:39:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"allafrica","country":["tanzania"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"L'amichevole di oggi Torino-Almeria in diretta su Torino Channel","link":"https://www.torinogranata.it/notizie/l-amichevole-di-oggi-torino-almeria-in-diretta-su-torino-channel-144414","keywords":["Notizie"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Il Torino Football Club comunica che l'amichevole Torino-Almeria sarà trasmessa in diretta su Torino Channel.

The Three Lions suffered a painful World Cup quarter-final exit at the hands of defending champions France last week after which Southgate confirmed he would take time to reflect on whether he is up to the task of spearheading England’s Euro 2024 qualifying campaign. A lack of outstanding potential replacements, allied to his solid performance in the job, means the Football Association are keen for Southgate to commit and remain until the end of his current contract. The FA are said to be considering the option of hiring a foreign coach, with Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel said to be interested, but retaining the services of Southgate is said to be their desired option. England are not back in action again until March, but Southgate’s former England teammate Neville believes the 52-year-old owes it to his employers to give them a swift decision. He told Sky Sports: ‘I think Gareth needs to come out over the next few days and put it to bed whether he’s staying or not. ‘We’re going into the New Year and we’ve got games in March I don’t think that’s fair on the FA who will need to find a successor. Mauricio Pochettino is said to be interested in becoming the next England manager (Picture: Getty) ‘Gareth is an honest man with great integrity and he’ll do the right thing so I think it feels like 18 months is right doing that next tournament and then putting a succession plan in place.’ Regardless of when he calls time on his time managing the national team, Neville hopes Southgate resists the urge to return to club management and is offered a administrative role within the FA. He said: ‘I hope he doesn’t go back into club management. I think Gareth’s future for me, and look, he’ll decide his future, I just look at him and think there’s no English person alive who has got more experience of major tournaments, junior tournaments, or youth tournaments, who has played for his country. ‘He’s seen it all Gareth, so I think he should be kept in the system to design the future. He knows how to support, he’s been there for 10 years. ‘We’ve had great success with the women’s team, the junior teams I think we’ve had relative really good success with the men’s team. ‘He’s seen that through over 10 years that improvement in performance. I’d like him to stay with the FA beyond his coaching role.’ MORE : England should do everything to appoint Eddie Howe after Gareth Southgate, says Jack Wilshere MORE : Former England manager says Mauricio Pochettino could be an ideal replacement for Gareth Southgate after World Cup exit For more stories like this, check our sport page.
