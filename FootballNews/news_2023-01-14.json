Article source : CHAN 2023 – Les observateurs du championnat local donnent leurs pronostics sur Côte d’Ivoire v Sénégal !","content":"Les Lions Locaux vont effectuer leur première sortie au CHAN ce soir à 19H. A quelques heures du coup d’envoi de ce match très attendu, des observateurs du football local partagent avec wiwsport leurs analyses de ce duel ouest-africain Côte d’Ivoire v Sénégal. Nos consultants du jour sont unanimes sur un point : il faut prendre les matchs les uns après les autres et viser comme premier objectif : la qualification au second tour. Dans une poule aussi relevée que celle du B où loge le Sénégal, en plus de ces longues années (12) sans disputer le CHAN, il ne faut pas afficher de grandes ambitions mais toujours se laisser guider par la magie du football. Laye Terry est bien connu dans le monde du football local. Selon lui, le groupe est relevé mais les deux premiers matchs sont prenables. Démarrer par la Cote d’Ivoire est une belle opportunité pour commencer. « Nous sommes dans une poule ou la RDC est le super favori. Donc commencer contre la Côte d’Ivoire est bénéfique pour les Lions dans la mesure où elle n’est pas une foudre de guerre. Ce match c’est du 50-50. Il faut venir et imposer sa marque, le premier match est important parce que ça permet de lancer une compétition. Gagner donne de la confiance. L’entraîneur est avec son groupe depuis un an. Durant les deux matchs amicaux, il a mis deux 11 différents donc je pense qu’il a son ossature en tête. Le maître mot est la patience. Il faut aussi rester concentrer jusqu’au but, assurer devant et ne pas prendre de but. Il faut gagner les deux premiers matchs et surtout ouvrir la compétition avec une victoire ». Capitaine Kassé est aussi bien instruit sur les championnats locaux en Afrique. Selon lui, la Cote d’Ivoire n’est pas un adversaire dangereux, il espére une victoire ce soir. « Je pense que le Sénégal peut avoir un résultat positif à l’issue de ce match. Bien vrai que la Côte d’Ivoire compte plus de participations que nous, elle n’est pas plus méritante. Il faut le dire la CIV déçoit toujours en CHAN. Et le championnat ivoirien n’est plus le même. Leur seule force est l’ASEC Mimosas, d’ailleurs la plupart des joueurs sélectionnés viennent de là-bas. En plus de perdre leur meilleur attaquant Karim Konate blessé. Le Sénégal a un groupe où ont voit de jeunes talents et d’expérimenté qui ont 60% de chances contre 40 pour la CIV ». Toutefois, pour gagner, il espére que les attaquants feront le job. « Ma seule inquiétude c’est l’attaque. On ne marque pas beaucoup. Durant la préparation, on a marqué 3 buts et on a encaissé 4. Si on arrive à inscrire 1 ou 2 buts par match on sera intenable. Si l’attaque marche, on va gagner ». Aly Marhawann Baba est un fervent supporter des équipes nationales du Sénégal. Actuellement en Algérie, il nous raconte l’ambiance à Annaba. « L’ambiance est plutôt calme du coté de la ou loge les lions. Cependant dès qu’on atterrit on voit déjà qu’il ya un événement dans la ville avec les drapeaux de tous les pays qui flottent au bord des routes et sur les grands bâtiments. 1-0 pour le Senegal. Ce sera un match très difficile vu la qualité de l’équipe ivoirienne ». wiwsport.com","pubDate":"2023-01-14 12:26:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"wiwsport","country":["senegal"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french"},{"title":"The Overwatch League ruled esports. Then everything went wrong","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1910038","keywords":["Gaming & Culture","Blizzard","esports","overwatch","syndication"],"creator":["WIRED"],"video_url":null,"description":"Activision-Blizzard’s ambitious, much-hyped initiative has stalled.","content":"Enlarge Sergio Flores/Bloomberg via Getty Images reader comments 5 with 0 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Since its formation in 2017, the Overwatch League—the professional esports program for Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch hero shooter—has drawn frequent comparisons to traditional sporting institutions. Its stated aim, as WIRED put it in a 2017 feature , was to become the new US National Football League. The two institutions certainly overlapped: The Overwatch League was the first major esports league to franchise local teams in major cities, and it features live spectator events with hometown crowds and salaried athletes. The goal was to offer esports fans a more traditional sports model, where they could go to a local arena or venue, see their hometown team play against an “away” team, and cheer during the event. The model offered local pop-up stores, team merchandise, ticket sales, media rights, and licensing. Well-known sports tycoons co-own multiple esports teams. Steve Bornstein was CEO of the NFL Network before he became Blizzard’s esports chair. (He told WIRED in 2017, “When I left the NFL, the only thing I saw that had the potential to be as big was the esports space.”) No more potent symbol of the league’s ambition existed than the plans for a Philadelphia Fusion stadium: a $50 million, 65,000-square-foot, 3,500-seat arena , projected to turn Philadelphia into an “ esports town .” Advertisement As Cecilia D’Anastasio recently revealed to Bloomberg, Activision Blizzard enticed team buyers with a projected league revenue of $125 million by 2020. This money has not materialized. Though buoyed by the release of Overwatch 2 and the beginning of a new season of the Overwatch League, viewership has dwindled . Overwatch League 2022 Summer Showdown, for example, was less popular than the two previous years’ events, according to Esports Charts, with just 51,000 peak viewers—particularly grating when you consider franchise owners pay upward of $20 million to license a team. Questionable moves—like switching the Overwatch League’s primary broadcast medium from Amazon-owned Twitch, the most popular site on the web for livestreamed game content, to YouTube in early 2020 —have driven viewers away. Shortly after that move, COVID-19 shut down the live, in-person events and tournaments that gave the League life, along with the international travel that players relied on to get quickly from their hometowns to matches. On top of all those factors, allegations of abuse and harassment inside Activision Blizzard led gamers, advertisers, and sponsors to abandon the League , forcing the company to scale back some of its growth ambitions. In 2023, the League’s path to profitability is unclear. Pessimism is compounded by the uncertain future of its pioneer, Bobby Kotick, and Activision Blizzard’s decision to lay off 50 esports employees in 2021. Even now, the US Federal Trade Commission is seeking to block the company’s $69 billion acquisition by Microsoft. It’s an understatement to say the League has had a rough time over the past several years. The latest development in this saga is the rebranding of the Philadelphia Fusion , one of the League’s more popular teams, to the Seoul Infernal. The team will relocate and become the second Seoul-based team, alongside the existing Seoul Dynasty. ( Most Overwatch players are South Korean , and the majority of the competition moved there during the pandemic, while Comcast owns Korean company T1 Entertainment and Sports.) The stadium has been abandoned and will become a retail facility instead.","pubDate":"2023-01-14 12:20:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"arstechnica","country":["united states of america","india","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Meet the gorgeous Wags glamming up the Australian Open – from a TikTok star to football legend’s daughter and fellow pro","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/10060261/wags-australia-open-tiktok/","keywords":["Sport","Tennis","australian open","Sport Features"],"creator":["Jon Boon"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"THE Australian Open always brings out the glam on the ATP Tour.

Joao Felix will serve the first of a three-game ban following his reckless red card at Fulham on Thursday. How Chelsea could line up against Crystal Palace Graham Potter has seen an already depleted squad thin even further following Felix’s suspension. Denis Zakaria is also set to miss out after picking up a thigh injury in the 2-1 defeat to Fulham. Felix’s suspension means Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is likely to start his first Chelsea match since October. The 31-year-old has started just four Premier League games this season, scoring one goal. A lack of options means he is poised to be joined in the front three by Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech with Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic both crocked. Zakaria’s injury is a blow for Chelsea, with the loanee impressing in midfield as of late. His absence could see a midfield trio of Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and Mason Mount start the game against Palace. Lewis Hall looks like a serious prospect at left-back, and he may get the nod again ahead of Marc Cucurella. HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL Cesar Azpilicueta will continue in the right in the absence of Reece James. Alternatively, Potter could stick with the same five at the back system he used at Fulham. That would see Cucurella slot in alongside Silva, while Potter may decide to hand a debut to new signing Benoit Badiashile.

Alisha went to the front door in her brown dressing gown as he left. Meanwhile, Defoe wore a blue puffer jacket over a hooded top, designer ripped jeans and black trainers. He also had a Stetson hat and moustache. He climbed into his Range Rover before driving away as Alisha waved him off smiling. She then walked to her Land Rover Defender to pick up a bag from posh Selfridges, where she used to work as a personal shopper. TV football pundit Defoe was back again in the evening and drove off again the following morning. Sources told the MailOnline he had been a “regular visitor” in the past few weeks. They have also been seen in a nearby cafe. Alisha has posted glamorous photos from exotic locations including Jamaica, Ibiza, Paris and Capri in Italy on her social media. When she was rumoured to be on Winter’s Love Island, a source said: “Alisha is exactly the type of contestant ITV2 is looking for – she’s gorgeous, body confident and isn’t afraid to be herself. “She already works as an influencer and has collaborated with brands like PrettyLittleThing, Missguided and ASOS. “She’s an advocate of body positivity and often admits on her Instagram to never wanting to be perfect, which is an important message to young viewers of the show.” Last month Defoe sparked fears his marriage was in trouble after spending Christmas in the Caribbean while wife Donna stayed at home in Glasgow. The former Spurs and West Ham star, 40, was pictured without his wedding ring while Donna, also 40, has reverted to her maiden name of Tierney on social media and has unfollowed her hubby. Neither of them has posted about each other on social media for eight weeks. Both have removed Instagram images of the OK! magazine cover that featured their £200,000 wedding last June. The Sun on Sunday revealed Defoe had begged a nurse for sex just a month after getting married. A source said: “The marriage seems to be in trouble. You would think they would want to spend their first Christmas together as husband and wife but they haven’t so things aren’t looking at all good.” Defoe and Donna married at stately home Cliveden House, in Berkshire, in June last year. The lavish bash featured across 14 pages as well as the cover of OK! magazine later that month. But the £20,000 wedding has caused a riddle about whether it actually happened. The local register office has no record of him and his “bride” Donna Tierney legally getting married at the country house venue, which it normally would do. There is also no record of any marriage in Glasgow where they were living at the time on June 4 last year. A source said: “It’s all a mystery. They didn’t let the mag have their reporter and photographer at the wedding at Cliveden House. “Instead, they had their own photographer and sent them the pictures, and then subsequently gave an interview to a reporter. “But no one is aware of them actually getting married and there were no pictures in the magazine of anyone marrying them.” When The Sun approached Donna — who has removed the pics from her social media — and asked if they actually got wed, she said: “Of course we did. I’ve heard these rumours, I don’t know where they’ve come from.” Alisha Lemay was rumoured to be on Love Island in 2019 Former England international footballer Defoe retired from playing last yearThe FA - Getty Images Donna Tierney insists her wedding to Jermain Defoe was legitimateinstagram instagramDefoe and Donna both spent Christmas apart – which should have been their first together as a married couple[/caption]","pubDate":"2023-01-14 11:55:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"thescottishsun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Celtic hero Chris Sutton names FIVE Rangers conspiracy cases whilst adding Ibrox idol Ally McCoist to ‘paranoia club’","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/10059694/celtic-sutton-rangers-conspiracy-cases-mccoist-paranoia/","keywords":["Football","Scottish Premiership","Sport"],"creator":["Chris Dodds"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"CELTIC hero Chris Sutton has sensationally made old pal and Rangers legend Ally McCoist a member of the ‘Scottish conspiracy and paranoia club’ – leaving the ex-Gers manager in stitches.

He has gone to extreme lengths to show that he is a no-nonsense personality. The 2007 world champion, who is also referred to as ‘The Iceman’ is famous for his dry humour and reluctance to participate in public relations and for his innumerable drunk anecdotes. The host of the Top Gear show, Jeremy Clarkson, revealed yet another story of the Icemen when he amazed his fan by collapsing on his feet. Clarkson asked Raikkonen if he met ‘The Stig’ because he is a big fan of the Iceman. Though, he further revealed that this is not the first time that Stig had met Raikkonen even though they didn’t speak a lot to each other. He[Stig] was in Monaco, standing in a bar when Raikkonen collapsed on his feet, drunk. Humorously he looked at the floor and was amazed as he realised, ‘Oh it’s my hero.’ As he listened to the story carefully, Raikkonen recalled collapsing in a bar in Monaco giving everybody a good laugh. Also Read: Michael Schumacher was once left perplexed after an unexpected chat about Indian football Kimi Raikkonen thinks the job of the Stig is best for him For those who don’t know, Clarkson introduced the character of ‘Stig’ on his show. The character depicts the anonymity of drivers behind the helmet, with no one knowing who is inside the stig’s suit. As the character defines, the Stig stays quiet in order to keep his identity anonymous and gets to drive different types of racing cars. Raikkonen who avoids being captured in social situations said that he thinks he would be the best suited for Stig’s job since everything that the job requires is ‘no talk, just drive.’ Starting the new year with the video of a drunk Michael Schumacher with Kimi Raikkonen (2003).

And when he was a kid and spoke a lot less than other kids around him, his parents got a little worried. They took a 6-year-old Raikkonen to a child therapist. The therapist told them that Kimi spoke less due to his above-average intelligence. The therapist even gave the young Finnish a coordination exercise which takes about 3 hours for an adult to solve. But given his high intelligence, Raikkonen amazed the room by finishing the test in merely 20 mins.

La fédération, créée en 1950, a ajouté que le régime algérien était impliqué dans de mauvaises décisions et dans une escalade hystérique contre le Maroc. Le fait de priver le Maroc de participer à cette compétition continentale qu’il avait remportée lors des deux dernières éditions, le CHAN-2023, qui perd ainsi de son importance, est mêlée à un conflit politique créé par le régime algérien. La Fédération des Journalistes du Pérou a souligné les déclarations du président de la Fédération royale marocaine de football, Fouzi Lekjaa, qui a estimé qu'”il est vraiment déplorable de priver de jeunes joueurs qui se sont préparés pendant un mois de participer à cette compétition sportive africaine”. La FJP est revenue également sur les propos du président de la Confédération africaine de football (CAF), Patrice Motsepe, tenus à son arrivée vendredi à l’Aéroport de Rabat-Salé, en compagnie du président de la Fédération internationale de football (FIFA), Gianni Infantino, afin d’assister à la cérémonie de tirage au sort de la Coupe du monde des clubs, prévue du 1er au 11 février au Maroc. Motsepe s’est dit “attristé” par le fait que la sélection marocaine ne puisse pas prendre part au Championnat d’Afrique des joueurs locaux en Algérie, a noté la même source.

But there is one chink in his armoury that could haunt him if he moves to Rangers. PANorwich City’s Todd Cantwell, who Rangers boss Michael Beale is a fan of[/caption] The 24-year-old is on the cusp of a transfer to Ibrox. Celtic hero Peter Grant has known the mercurial midfielder Cantwell for a long time due to his own association with Norwich City, having played there after leaving the Hoops and later managing the Norfolk club in 2006-07. His son also played alongside Cantwell in the Canaries’ youth sides, so he has seen plenty of his qualities over the years. For all his ability on the ball, Grant thinks Cantwell struggles to deal with criticism – something he would no doubt experience playing in the Old Firm bubble. Grant told GO Radio’s Football Show: “Todd is one of these kids I’ve known for a long time. He played with my son Raymond and James Maddison, so it was a very good side. “Todd is one of these boys who can play but my concern would be if he handle the criticism when things are not going particularly well. That was one thing I thought was his weakness at Norwich. “He had some terrific games and worked hard for his team. You would either play him as a 10 or a wide left so he can drift in, but he is a very good footballer there is no getting away from it.” Grant highlighted a current player at Hibs who he reckons has similar tendencies to those Cantwell once had, such as worrying too much about social media and his hairstyle. He explained: “I look at the boy (Harry) McKirdy at Hibs. He comes out with this hair and everything, and I’m not saying anybody shouldn’t have their own style or whatever, but I’m thinking well ‘you better be able to play, son’ – and he’s not proven that yet. Todd went through a period like that. “There was too much of this Facebook stuff and he had the best of gear. You know, concentrate on your football. “This is the bad side he has probably had. If you remember, they got relegated and he sat on the park and the chief executive hammered him after it. He said something like ‘I wish they had cried more during the season and we would have got better performances’. “They are the things you think to yourself ‘it’s not about you, it’s about how much work you put in’. He has got the talent. There is no question about the quality, it’s the other parts of it. “Because I have been down there for so long (England), coming to a Celtic or a Rangers is a completely different thing. Can you handle it daily? 24/7. “ Keep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page","pubDate":"2023-01-14 10:51:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"thescottishsun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lionel Messi ‘wanted by two Saudi clubs in £306M-A-YEAR transfer’ that would see him reignite Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/10059874/messi-wanted-two-saudi-clubs-transfer-ronaldo-rivalry/","keywords":["Football","Sport"],"creator":["Giacomo Pisa"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"LIONEL MESSI is reportedly wanted by TWO clubs in Saudi Arabia – which would see him reignite his rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo.

Dans quelques semaines ils ne se basculeront plus sur le petit gradin du stade municipal. Celui-ci a été complètement détruit et reconstruit par le maire Mame Diop sur le budget municipal et verra sa capacité multipliée presque par six. Le projet avait été présenté au mouvement association et aux autres acteurs sportifs de la ville par le maire, actuel président de l’Assemblée nationale, il y a environs deux ans. Selon les explications qu’il avait fournies à l’époque, la destruction de l’ancienne tribune de 200 places environs, trop petite pour contenir les sportifs de la ville était une demande de la jeunesse qu’il fallait satisfaire. Il a ainsi décidé de puiser sur le budget municipal pour engager des travaux de reconstruction permettant d’augmenter la capacité de cette tribune. A la fin des travaux qui sont à la dernière phase, le stade disposera d’une nouvelle tribune d’une capacité six fois plus grande. Dans cette nouvelle tribune toutes les places seront couvertes avec au rez-de-chaussée deux vestiaires pour les équipes, un pour les arbitres, un pour commissaires de match, une salle multifonctionnelle pour les sports comme le volley-ball, le Handball etc, un bureau pour le directeur du stade, une salle de conférence pour la presse, des bureaux pour les ligues, une salle de soins et un local pour le gardien. Au premier niveau, il y aura une partie aménagée où seront construits trois bureaux, un réfectoire, des toilettes et une cuisine. Par ailleurs les gradins, situés au niveau supérieur seront composés de trois parties dont celle centrale réservée aux officiels, un salon d’honneur et une cabine de reportage. De part et d’autres de cette partie de 400 places environs, les ailes seront composées chacune de 420 places. Des nouveaux parkings seront aussi construits à l’intérieur dont quatre pour abriter les bus et une dizaine pour les officiels. D’autres parkings seront aussi aménagés dehors et à l’intérieur pour le public. Des travaux bientôt engagés pour l’aire de jeu Selon des informations fournies par l’entrepreneur, les travaux n’ont pas pris en charge pour le moment la réfection de l’aire de jeux et le système d’évacuation des eaux pluviales. Des travaux qui pourraient bientôt être engagés, selon un proche du maire dont les populations se disent déjà très satisfaites pour ce grand pas franchi dans le cadre de la modernisation des infrastructures dédiées à la jeunesse de la ville sucrière.

Après un show d'heure et demi avec notamment une prestation musicale animée par Soolking et un discours du petit fils de Mandela qui a enflammé la foule, la sélection nationale A' entrait sur le terrain pour affronter une équipe libyenne qu'elle redoutait quelque peu. En effet face à une équipe de Libye bien regroupée et surtout plus expérimentée car composée pratiquement des joueurs de la sélection A, les coéquipiers d'Ayoub Abdellaoui se sont présenté dans un dispositif en 4-2-3-1 avec Mrezigue et Draoui à la récupération, Kendouci pratiquement en numero 10 derrière Mahious en pointe ainsi que Meziane et Lahemri sur les ailes. Bien que tenant la balle l'équipe algérienne a eu un peu de mal a combiner surtout en première période pour trouver l'attaquant de pointe Aymen Mahious ni a terre, ni par des centres aériens et malgré la justesse techniques de certains joueurs comme Kendouci, les libyens étaient toujours à l'affût. Il aura fallu une faute du gardien Mahious en début de seconde période pour débloquer le match. Après que l'attaquant de l'USMA transforme le penalty (57') et devienne le premier buteur de l'histoire au stade Nelson Mandela, les libyens vont se réveiller et trouver le poteau du gardien Guendouz, qui signalons le et très bon les sorties aériennes.

Throughout his 20-year career, he treated fans to some brilliant racing action on the track, but also became famous for his personality off it. Raikkonen was a fan favorite for his interviews and radio messages, which were perceived as funny because he is very blunt and straightforward while presenting his opinions. One such instance took place at the 2021 British GP in Silverstone, where Raikkonen didn’t hold back while giving his race engineer an earful. Kimi Raikkonen Team Radio: The Ultimate Collection So many brilliant Iceman moments from down the years – watch the complete collection now! #F1 — Formula 1 (@F1) September 2, 2021 Raikkonen was tussling for P10 alongside Red Bull’s Sergio Perez in the closing stages of the race. The Red Bull driver and Raikkonen raced wheel to wheel for a while before the Finn was spun out of the track. This spoiled all his efforts, as he ended up not scoring any points that race. For a team like Alfa Romeo that was struggling at the back end of the grid, even a point would have been very valuable.

His race engineer, Julien Simon-Chautemps tried to console him by saying that his shunt with Perez was ‘unlucky’ and it could have been a good day for him with a P10. “It’s a shame with Perez,” Simon-Chautemps said. “I said it’s a shame with the accident with Perez. We could have maybe scored.” Raikkonen, however, was not at all pleased with what his race engineer had to say. Instead of blaming luck, he blamed the team for providing him with a slow car. The Iceman is one of the best drivers of his generation, and was not happy with the car his disposal. “Maybe,” Raikkonen replied. “Or maybe we need to make the car faster, simple. It is impossible to fight against them. Same this, same that and try to fight with the other cars. Come on, we got to wake up and do something!” Raikkonen decided to retire from F1 after the end of the 2021 F1 season. He spent the last three of his career (2019-2021) with the Hinwil based outfit and the majority of that time, he scrambled for places at the back of the grid.

The Los Angeles Chargers currently face the wrath of injury as offense weapon Mike Williams is ruled out for their wild-card game against the Jaguars. The wild card round of the playoffs has arrived and the NFL community has been in anticipation all year for these last rounds of fireworks. As teams gear up for what is the most significant part of their season, some have to deal with the inevitable part of sports. The Chargers will travel to Jacksonville as the Jaguars host them. The Los Angeles team finished the regular season with the Number 5 seed. On the other hand, the Jaguars ended the season as the Number 4 seed. This will be the first time the two teams face off in a playoff game. Mike Williams set to miss the playoffs The Chargers have been a quality side in the 2022 NFL season, having met the 10-win mark. With Justin Herbert at the helm, the Los Angeles team finished second in their division, falling short to Patrick Mahomes’ chiefs. The Chargers are also 4-1 in their last five games, having lost their game-week 18 matchup with the Broncos. Along with losing the game, the Chargers also lost out on a key O-line member in this game. As the festivities of the playoffs kick off in Jacksonville, the Chargers will be without their key attackman, Mike Williams. Citing a back injury, the Chargers wide receiver will not only miss out on this game but even the remainder of the playoffs. This obviously is dependent on how far the Chargers make it. Williams appears to have fractured his back in the regular season finale against the Broncos. While head coach Brandon Staley was hopeful for a quick recovery for his starman, team doctors crushed his hopes. A detailed report stated his minor fracture would take at least two-three weeks to recover. Also Read: “That Was Nasty”: Kevin Durant Blown Away By Mike Williams’ Catch of The Season Against LA Rams Questionable coaching decision by Brandon Staley With this news, Staley’s game-week 18 decision is back to haunt him. Having already secured a playoff berth before heading into the Broncos game, Staley played his starters. Williams was one of them. In a game that wouldn’t affect their season, Staley played his starters and as a result, will now be without Williams. It’s safe to say, Chargers fans weren’t happy with this decision. Williams has recorded a solid performance through 13 games this season. He has 63 catches for close to 900 yards, having made 4 touchdown receptions in the process. With these numbers, it’s clear that Williams was key in Justin Herbert’s plans, something he will have to tweak for Sunday.
