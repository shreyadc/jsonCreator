Reports have linked Palace winger Olise with a summer move to Old Trafford Right-sided attacker would come into direct competition with misfiring Antony Mail Sport's Chief Football Reporter Sami Mokbel gives the transfer latest on Ivan Toney, Conor Gallagher and more on It's All Kicking Off By Adam Shergold for MailOnline Published: 14:30, 4 January 2024 | Updated: 14:34, 4 January 2024 e-mail View comments The January transfer window has only just opened but Manchester United 's new owners are already looking ahead to the summer. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are shortlisting transfer targets having completed their £1.3billion buy-in at Old Trafford. A report in the Evening Standard named Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise as someone the new United hierarchy are interested in. Even though the 22-year-old only signed a new four-year contract at Selhurst Park back in August, it is believed to contain a release clause which kicks in this summer. The precise amount isn't known but it would likely be a considerable sum as Palace look to protect the value of one of their star players. Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise has emerged as a transfer target for Manchester United Erik ten Hag's (left) ailing side looks like it will need further reinforcement in the summer and Sir Jim Ratcliffe (right) could give the green light for Olise Your browser does not support iframes. It's not hard to understand why Olise, a right-sided winger, represents an attractive proposition. Having missed the opening weeks of the season with a hamstring injury, he has scored five goals and supplied one assist in nine matches since his return. Olise will be crucial in Palace's efforts to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle from their current position of 14th in the Premier League. One of the many problems United have encountered this season is a lack of end product from their wide attackers and a shortage of service for £72million centre forward Rasmus Hojlund. Their Brazilian winger Antony, an £85m signing demanded by manager Erik ten Hag in 2022, hasn't provided a single goal or assist in 21 outings this season. If United sign Olise, Antony's status as their first-choice right winger would be seriously threatened. A comparison of their output in Premier League matches this season, courtesy of FBref , confirms Olise offers far more than Antony. The Palace winger's xG [Expected Goals] is 3.0 and his expected xAG [Expected Assisted Goals] is 2.7 compared to Antony's 1.4 and 2.1 respectively. Olise trumps Antony in terms of average shots per 90 minutes [3.46 to 2.39] and shots on target per 90 [1.06 to 0.50]. He also creates more chances with 5.85 Shot-creating Actions per 90 minutes to Antony's 3.48. Olise's average passes completed figure per game is 36.8 as opposed to 30.7. Right-sided winger Olise is adept at taking on opponents and has a very good end product If United signed Olise, he would be a direct competitor for misfiring Brazilian winger Antony OLISE vs MAN UNITED WIDE ATTACKERS IN PREMIER LEAGUE 2023-24 Stat Olise Antony Rashford Garnacho Appearances 9 16 19 18 Goals scored 5 0 3 3 Assists 1 0 2 2 Expected goals 3.0 1.4 5.0 3.8 Expected assists 2.7 2.1 1.9 1.8 Shots per 90min 3.46 2.39 2.79 3.63 Shots on target per 90min 1.06 0.50 0.75 0.76 Shot creating actions per 90 5.85 3.48 3.40 3.63 Average passes completed 36.8 30.7 21.8 24.7 Take-on success rate % 60.0 32.6 42.6 36.1 Source: FBref One criticism often levelled at Antony is he doesn't perform well enough when taking on defenders and the stats bear this out. He is successful in 32.6 per cent of take-ons, compared to 60 per cent for Olise. So within the small sample size of Olise's nine games this season, he is outperforming Antony in almost every area of significance to their roles. Antony will need to produce far more during the second half of the season to convince United's hierarchy they don't need to sign a replacement on the right wing. As it happens, Olise is doing a bit better in several areas of his game than Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, United's other two frequently-used wide attackers. Both Rashford and Garnacho, who are typically stationed on the left flank, have three goals and two assists to their credit in Premier League action this season. Alejandro Garnacho has been one of United's better performing wingers without sparkling Marcus Rashford's form during the current campaign is a shadow of last season's brilliance IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

Advertisement Rashford [5.0] and Garnacho [3.8] beat Olise [3.0] for xG, but the Palace winger trumps them when it comes to Expected Assisted Goals [2.7 compared to 1.9 for Rashford and 1.8 for Garnacho]. Olise's average shots on goal per game is higher than Rashford and only a shade lower than Garnacho, but he beats them both for getting efforts on target. His 60 per cent take-on success is also clearly better than 42.6 for Rashford and 36.1 for Garnacho, and actually from more attempts on average per game. But Olise hasn't played on the left-side since his Reading days, meaning he isn't in direct competition with Rashford or Garnacho. Olise has been in sizzling form since returning from a hamstring injury earlier in the campaign Based on the stats, however, he would walk into United's side on the right, ahead of Antony, plus Facundo Pellistri and Amad Diallo, who are rarely used. In fairness to Antony, his figures do stand up better when compared to Olise last season - the Brazilian produced more goals and assists, with his xG a healthy 6.9. Trouble is, his form has fallen off a cliff during his second season with United, his struggles representative of the side as a whole. As INEOS perform their review of United's playing side, there's no question Antony is a weak link at present and Olise could represent a good replacement if the price is right.

The Jamaican was among those Villa were willing to let go last summer but he has developed into a key player this term, scoring six goals and providing five assists to help Emery's men into second, three points behind leaders Liverpool . Bailey joined Villa in 2021 for about £25million with part of the proceeds from the £100m sale of Jack Grealish to Manchester City , and signed an initial four-year deal thought to include options for extension. But so impressive has Bailey been in the autumn and winter that Villa are keen to reward him with fresh terms and elevate him closer to Villa's top bracket of earners, which includes Emi Martinez, Tyrone Mings , Moussa Diaby and Ollie Watkins . Since Emery replaced Steven Gerrard in October 2022, Villa's wage bill has increased significantly, with Mings, Watkins, Martinez, John McGinn and Ezri Konsa among the players who have had big pay rises.

Bailey scored as Villa beat Burnley 3-2 in their final game of 2023, though he is likely to be among several players given a breather for Saturday's FA Cup tie at Middlesbrough.

He felt his hamstring with the last sprint he made of the game. Unfortunately for us, he won’t take part in this game,” Hodgson told the media ahead of the Everton clash. “We’ll have to nurse him through and hope he gets back as soon as possible. For how long is he out? I can’t answer that one I’m afraid. “[His character] is good. We’re hoping that this one is going to be nothing like the one that put him out of the game for nearly six months.

After his last two performances, which were so good, we were hoping he’d be stepping out tomorrow and treating us again to another great football exhibition. “He’s a bit upset that that can’t happen and as are we, but let’s not put too much of a dampener on what’s going to happen going forward.

A £10 wager on our three-leg acca would pay out £40.30, while the same stake on our five-leg version offers a potential return of £117.17. Find the best football bookies to place your acca with: Two of the Premier League’s biggest clubs will lock horns at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, with one of Arsenal and Liverpool destined to be eliminated in the third round. Arsenal head into this fixture with their confidence dented after a surprise pair of defeats by West Ham United and Fulham. Those losses saw the Gunners drop down to fourth in the standings and Liverpool will see this as an opportunity to inflict more damage on their title rivals. The Reds will be without Mohamed Salah and Wataru Endo for this one after that pair jetted off to the Africa Cup of Nations and Asian Cup respectively. The loss of Salah in particular is a blow, but Liverpool will still feel they can cause Arsenal plenty of problems here. ⚽ Kick things off with a Liverpool win or draw at 8/11 with bet365 ⚽ The tie of the round pits arch-rivals Sunderland and Newcastle United against one another at the Stadium of Light. These fiercest of adversaries have not met since March 2016, when the pair drew 1-1. Each of the six previous head-to-head clashes ended in a Sunderland victory. Given they are now a Championship team and Newcastle have played Champions League football this season, it will be tougher for Sunderland to emerge triumphant this time. Do not write them off, though. Newcastle are in dismal form with just one win in their last eight outings in all competitions. They conceded a huge number of chances in a 4-2 defeat by Liverpool on Monday, so Sunderland will be confident of at least finding the back of the net. ⚽ Select both teams to score at 4/6 with bet365 ⚽ Chelsea will hope 2024 brings them more success than 2023, which will be remembered as one of their worst calendar years in recent history. The Blues showed the best and worst of themselves last weekend. After storming into a 3-0 lead over Luton Town, Chelsea conceded twice late on and had to cling on for all three points. Preston North End will see this as a free hit. No one expects them to get anything from their trip to London and a loss would be seen as par for the course. Conversely, a victory would make everyone sit up and take notice. Preston will therefore be incentivised to go on the attack, not least because of Chelsea’s defensive vulnerabilities. The Blues are at least looking much better going forward, so expect goals in this one. ⚽ Go for over 2.5 goals at Stamford Bridge with 2/5 with bet365 ⚽ Back our treble with bet365 to win £40.30 from a £10 bet Add the following two bets to make it a 5-fold acca. The FA Cup holders will begin the defence of their crown when Huddersfield Town head to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Manchester City are, unsurprisingly, the favourites to lift the trophy again this year, and anyone searching for a third-round giant-killing should probably look elsewhere. Huddersfield are somewhat preoccupied with their battle against relegation to League One, with just three points separating them from the drop zone at present. Even if Pep Guardiola uses this as an opportunity to shuffle his pack after a busy December, City should have too much quality for their second-flight opponents. Guardiola’s side are magnificent at home and this should be a relatively comfortable 90 minutes for them. ⚽ Tip Manchester City to win both halves at 4/7 with bet365 ⚽ Two Championship teams will do battle at The Den this weekend, as Millwall and Leicester City seek a place in the fourth round. The Foxes are flying high in the second tier and look dead certs for promotion. After 26 rounds of fixtures, they have a 10-point lead over Ipswich Town in second and a 13-point advantage over third-placed Southampton. That gives them a significant margin for error, which should result in Enzo Maresca taking the FA Cup more seriously than he would have done had Leicester been in the play-off places. Even Premier League teams would not relish facing Maresca’s men right now, and Millwall will be up against it this weekend. ⚽ Back Leicester City to beat Millwall at 17/20 with bet365 ⚽ Back our 5-fold acca with bet365 to win £117.17 from a £10 bet Greg Lea Greg Lea is a freelance football writer from London.

The French striker has been linked with a move to Anfield for years, with his future now being the topic of conversation once more. Mbappe is out of contract at the end of the season, while he is now free to talk to foreign clubs regarding a Bosman transfer. The striker has also said that he is yet to reach a decision on his future. While Liverpool remain linked, Klopp has already dismissed the chances of his side making a move for Mbappe. \"We laugh about it,\" Klopp told Sky Germany in August following yet more links. \"I can say that I think he's a really good player but the financial conditions don't suit us at all. I wouldn't like to ruin the story now... but as far as I know, there's nothing to it.

That would be the first time.\" While Liverpool do not appear likely to sign Mbappe any time soon, they have actually attempted to make a move for him in the past. Speaking in 2022, Mbappe admitted: “I talked to Liverpool because it’s the favourite club of my mum, my mum loves Liverpool. \"I don’t know why, you will have to ask her! It’s a good club and we met them five years ago. When I was in Monaco I met them.

Share your predictions in the comments below Mbappe is currently in the midst of another sensational season with PSG . He has 22 goals in 23 appearances for the French side, a record that includes a strike in their Trophee des Champions victory against Toulouse. With Klopp having seemingly ruled Liverpool out of the race, that could potentially open the door to Real Madrid . The Spanish giants almost signed Mbappe in the summer of 2022, only for the striker to sign a fresh deal in the French capital. That decision left Florentino Pérez furious , who hit out at the forward for his u-turn. Real’s interest remains though. However, Carlo Ancelotti has remained tight-lipped about a potential deal. Replying to reporters after being asked about Mbappe, the Italian said: “I don’t recognise you, you must be one of the new ones who doesn’t know that I won’t speak about that [Mbappe]. I won’t touch on that topic.” Join our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Now he is hoping to dislodge Andrew Wogan, 18, who finished last season as the Boynesiders’ no 1. Barr said: “I’ve been playing in Northern Ireland, but I know how tough the league is here. Drogheda came in for me, and I’m really excited to get going. “I made my debut in the South African league when I was seventeen. The league in South Africa is different compared to here. “Playing with Portadown, I think I’ve adjusted to the differences in the climate and weather as well. I’ve been patient, waiting until January to get a move and I’m really buzzing to be here at Drogheda now. “I played my first senior international games for South Africa this year which was a dream come true for me. “I was grateful the people back home took notice of how I was playing in Northern Ireland and gave me a chance. I think I did well, we didn’t lose any of the three games, so hopefully there are eyes back on me and I can kick on now. “I want to play as many games as possible. Andrew has done really well, we’ve seen it from up North, he’s put in some great performances. “Being the older goalkeeper in the team, I can always guide him and offer advice but I also want to push him for his spot, because I am here to compete for my place in the team.” Drogs boss Kevin Doherty is delighted with the capture of a player who had limited first-team experience with Bidvest Wits, Stellenbosch and Maritzburg United before joining Portadown in 2021 Doherty said: “There were a number of clubs looking at Jethren so it’s a great one for us to have. It’s not often you sign an international player either. “I had looked at a few different goalkeepers but when I saw Jethren, when you put together his experience and his age, it fit. “Then I spoke to him, and I was so impressed just by speaking to him - his attitude, his enthusiasm, how positive he was. “Everyone knows we have a really good goalkeeper here in Andy Wogan, so this is good competition now too. “His experience plays a big part, and it is a strange dynamic with goalkeepers at times because only one can play but I’m bringing Jethren in here to compete with Andy.”","pubDate":"2024-01-04 14:19:14","image_url":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270d.png","source_id":"thesun_ie","source_priority":45285,"country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"e1bcb0d0a498a7031a93be17a16facac","title":"Soccer-Ngamaleu returns for Cameroon as teams forced into Cup of Nations squad changes","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/football/2024/01/04/soccer-ngamaleu-returns-for-cameroon-as-teams-forced-into-cup-of-nations-squad-changes","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Winger Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu will make his return to the Cameroon selection after being named on Thursday as a late replacement in their Africa Cup of Nations squad headed to the Ivory Coast later this month.

The 29-year-old Ngamaleu was one of his country's key players when they hosted the finals two years ago but was omitted from the original squad for this tournament, which kicks off next Saturday. He also played at the 2022 World Cup finals. He comes in at the last moment to replace uncapped teenager Regis Mughe, who has elected to stay with his French club Olympique de Marseille rather than go with the Indomitable Lions. Cameroon are among several countries forced to make late changes as the deadline for the submission of squads passed on Wednesday. After losing forward Amine Gouiri, Algeria will now have to do without veteran goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi, who has also suffered an injury. The 37-year-old was approaching his 100th cap but is replaced by Saudi-based Mustafa Zaghba, the Algerian federation said. Egypt have lost uncapped Ahmed Nabil Kouka, who had been in top form for African champions Al Ahly and was an exciting call-up, to a foot injury suffered in training. He is replaced by Mohanad Lashin. Fullback Osama Galal, who suffered a knee injury, was replaced on Wednesday by Yasser Ibrahim, whose original omission from the squad had been widely criticised by pundits in Egypt. Tunisia have allowed Mortadha Ben Ouanes to withdraw for what the federation said were family reasons and replaced the Turkish-based striker with Seifeddine Jaziri. The 30-year-old Jaziri was Tunisia’s lead attacker at the last Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon two years ago. Mauritania goalkeeper Babacar Diop underwent surgery on Wednesday after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in training in Tunisia, where they are preparing for the tournament. A replacement has yet to be announced. The 24 participating countries had until Wednesday to name their squads, which can be a maximum of 27 players but also have until kickoff in their first game to replace injured players, but only after producing medical evidence.

Reports have linked Palace winger Olise with a summer move to Old Trafford Right-sided attacker would come into direct competition with misfiring Antony Mail Sport's Chief Football Reporter Sami Mokbel gives the transfer latest on Ivan Toney, Conor Gallagher and more on It's All Kicking Off By Adam Shergold for MailOnline Published: 14:30, 4 January 2024 | Updated: 14:34, 4 January 2024 e-mail View comments The January transfer window has only just opened but Manchester United 's new owners are already looking ahead to the summer. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are shortlisting transfer targets having completed their £1.3billion buy-in at Old Trafford. A report in the Evening Standard named Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise as someone the new United hierarchy are interested in. Even though the 22-year-old only signed a new four-year contract at Selhurst Park back in August, it is believed to contain a release clause which kicks in this summer. The precise amount isn't known but it would likely be a considerable sum as Palace look to protect the value of one of their star players. Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise has emerged as a transfer target for Manchester United Erik ten Hag's (left) ailing side looks like it will need further reinforcement in the summer and Sir Jim Ratcliffe (right) could give the green light for Olise Your browser does not support iframes. It's not hard to understand why Olise, a right-sided winger, represents an attractive proposition. Having missed the opening weeks of the season with a hamstring injury, he has scored five goals and supplied one assist in nine matches since his return. Olise will be crucial in Palace's efforts to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle from their current position of 14th in the Premier League. One of the many problems United have encountered this season is a lack of end product from their wide attackers and a shortage of service for £72million centre forward Rasmus Hojlund. Their Brazilian winger Antony, an £85m signing demanded by manager Erik ten Hag in 2022, hasn't provided a single goal or assist in 21 outings this season. If United sign Olise, Antony's status as their first-choice right winger would be seriously threatened. A comparison of their output in Premier League matches this season, courtesy of FBref , confirms Olise offers far more than Antony. The Palace winger's xG [Expected Goals] is 3.0 and his expected xAG [Expected Assisted Goals] is 2.7 compared to Antony's 1.4 and 2.1 respectively. Olise trumps Antony in terms of average shots per 90 minutes [3.46 to 2.39] and shots on target per 90 [1.06 to 0.50]. He also creates more chances with 5.85 Shot-creating Actions per 90 minutes to Antony's 3.48. Olise's average passes completed figure per game is 36.8 as opposed to 30.7. Right-sided winger Olise is adept at taking on opponents and has a very good end product If United signed Olise, he would be a direct competitor for misfiring Brazilian winger Antony OLISE vs MAN UNITED WIDE ATTACKERS IN PREMIER LEAGUE 2023-24 Stat Olise Antony Rashford Garnacho Appearances 9 16 19 18 Goals scored 5 0 3 3 Assists 1 0 2 2 Expected goals 3.0 1.4 5.0 3.8 Expected assists 2.7 2.1 1.9 1.8 Shots per 90min 3.46 2.39 2.79 3.63 Shots on target per 90min 1.06 0.50 0.75 0.76 Shot creating actions per 90 5.85 3.48 3.40 3.63 Average passes completed 36.8 30.7 21.8 24.7 Take-on success rate % 60.0 32.6 42.6 36.1 Source: FBref One criticism often levelled at Antony is he doesn't perform well enough when taking on defenders and the stats bear this out. He is successful in 32.6 per cent of take-ons, compared to 60 per cent for Olise. So within the small sample size of Olise's nine games this season, he is outperforming Antony in almost every area of significance to their roles. Antony will need to produce far more during the second half of the season to convince United's hierarchy they don't need to sign a replacement on the right wing. As it happens, Olise is doing a bit better in several areas of his game than Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, United's other two frequently-used wide attackers. Both Rashford and Garnacho, who are typically stationed on the left flank, have three goals and two assists to their credit in Premier League action this season. Alejandro Garnacho has been one of United's better performing wingers without sparkling Marcus Rashford's form during the current campaign is a shadow of last season's brilliance IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!

It is available on MailOnline , Mail+ , YouTube , Apple Music and Spotify Your browser does not support iframes. Advertisement Rashford [5.0] and Garnacho [3.8] beat Olise [3.0] for xG, but the Palace winger trumps them when it comes to Expected Assisted Goals [2.7 compared to 1.9 for Rashford and 1.8 for Garnacho]. Olise's average shots on goal per game is higher than Rashford and only a shade lower than Garnacho, but he beats them both for getting efforts on target. His 60 per cent take-on success is also clearly better than 42.6 for Rashford and 36.1 for Garnacho, and actually from more attempts on average per game. But Olise hasn't played on the left-side since his Reading days, meaning he isn't in direct competition with Rashford or Garnacho. Olise has been in sizzling form since returning from a hamstring injury earlier in the campaign Based on the stats, however, he would walk into United's side on the right, ahead of Antony, plus Facundo Pellistri and Amad Diallo, who are rarely used. In fairness to Antony, his figures do stand up better when compared to Olise last season - the Brazilian produced more goals and assists, with his xG a healthy 6.9. Trouble is, his form has fallen off a cliff during his second season with United, his struggles representative of the side as a whole. As INEOS perform their review of United's playing side, there's no question Antony is a weak link at present and Olise could represent a good replacement if the price is right.

The Jamaican was among those Villa were willing to let go last summer but he has developed into a key player this term, scoring six goals and providing five assists to help Emery's men into second, three points behind leaders Liverpool . Bailey joined Villa in 2021 for about £25million with part of the proceeds from the £100m sale of Jack Grealish to Manchester City , and signed an initial four-year deal thought to include options for extension. But so impressive has Bailey been in the autumn and winter that Villa are keen to reward him with fresh terms and elevate him closer to Villa's top bracket of earners, which includes Emi Martinez, Tyrone Mings , Moussa Diaby and Ollie Watkins . Since Emery replaced Steven Gerrard in October 2022, Villa's wage bill has increased significantly, with Mings, Watkins, Martinez, John McGinn and Ezri Konsa among the players who have had big pay rises.

A £10 wager on our three-leg acca would pay out £40.30, while the same stake on our five-leg version offers a potential return of £117.17. Find the best football bookies to place your acca with: Two of the Premier League’s biggest clubs will lock horns at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, with one of Arsenal and Liverpool destined to be eliminated in the third round. Arsenal head into this fixture with their confidence dented after a surprise pair of defeats by West Ham United and Fulham. Those losses saw the Gunners drop down to fourth in the standings and Liverpool will see this as an opportunity to inflict more damage on their title rivals. The Reds will be without Mohamed Salah and Wataru Endo for this one after that pair jetted off to the Africa Cup of Nations and Asian Cup respectively. The loss of Salah in particular is a blow, but Liverpool will still feel they can cause Arsenal plenty of problems here. ⚽ Kick things off with a Liverpool win or draw at 8/11 with bet365 ⚽ The tie of the round pits arch-rivals Sunderland and Newcastle United against one another at the Stadium of Light. These fiercest of adversaries have not met since March 2016, when the pair drew 1-1. Each of the six previous head-to-head clashes ended in a Sunderland victory. Given they are now a Championship team and Newcastle have played Champions League football this season, it will be tougher for Sunderland to emerge triumphant this time. Do not write them off, though. Newcastle are in dismal form with just one win in their last eight outings in all competitions. They conceded a huge number of chances in a 4-2 defeat by Liverpool on Monday, so Sunderland will be confident of at least finding the back of the net. ⚽ Select both teams to score at 4/6 with bet365 ⚽ Chelsea will hope 2024 brings them more success than 2023, which will be remembered as one of their worst calendar years in recent history. The Blues showed the best and worst of themselves last weekend. After storming into a 3-0 lead over Luton Town, Chelsea conceded twice late on and had to cling on for all three points. Preston North End will see this as a free hit. No one expects them to get anything from their trip to London and a loss would be seen as par for the course. Conversely, a victory would make everyone sit up and take notice. Preston will therefore be incentivised to go on the attack, not least because of Chelsea’s defensive vulnerabilities. The Blues are at least looking much better going forward, so expect goals in this one. ⚽ Go for over 2.5 goals at Stamford Bridge with 2/5 with bet365 ⚽ Back our treble with bet365 to win £40.30 from a £10 bet Add the following two bets to make it a 5-fold acca. The FA Cup holders will begin the defence of their crown when Huddersfield Town head to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Manchester City are, unsurprisingly, the favourites to lift the trophy again this year, and anyone searching for a third-round giant-killing should probably look elsewhere. Huddersfield are somewhat preoccupied with their battle against relegation to League One, with just three points separating them from the drop zone at present. Even if Pep Guardiola uses this as an opportunity to shuffle his pack after a busy December, City should have too much quality for their second-flight opponents. Guardiola’s side are magnificent at home and this should be a relatively comfortable 90 minutes for them. ⚽ Tip Manchester City to win both halves at 4/7 with bet365 ⚽ Two Championship teams will do battle at The Den this weekend, as Millwall and Leicester City seek a place in the fourth round. The Foxes are flying high in the second tier and look dead certs for promotion. After 26 rounds of fixtures, they have a 10-point lead over Ipswich Town in second and a 13-point advantage over third-placed Southampton. That gives them a significant margin for error, which should result in Enzo Maresca taking the FA Cup more seriously than he would have done had Leicester been in the play-off places. Even Premier League teams would not relish facing Maresca’s men right now, and Millwall will be up against it this weekend. ⚽ Back Leicester City to beat Millwall at 17/20 with bet365 ⚽ Back our 5-fold acca with bet365 to win £117.17 from a £10 bet Greg Lea Greg Lea is a freelance football writer from London.

The French striker has been linked with a move to Anfield for years, with his future now being the topic of conversation once more. Mbappe is out of contract at the end of the season, while he is now free to talk to foreign clubs regarding a Bosman transfer. The striker has also said that he is yet to reach a decision on his future. While Liverpool remain linked, Klopp has already dismissed the chances of his side making a move for Mbappe. \"We laugh about it,\" Klopp told Sky Germany in August following yet more links. \"I can say that I think he's a really good player but the financial conditions don't suit us at all. I wouldn't like to ruin the story now... but as far as I know, there's nothing to it.

That would be the first time.\" While Liverpool do not appear likely to sign Mbappe any time soon, they have actually attempted to make a move for him in the past. Speaking in 2022, Mbappe admitted: “I talked to Liverpool because it’s the favourite club of my mum, my mum loves Liverpool. \"I don’t know why, you will have to ask her! It’s a good club and we met them five years ago. When I was in Monaco I met them. It’s a big club.” Kylian Mbappe's future is yet to be resolved amid links with Liverpool ( Image: Getty Images) Where do you think Mbappe will end up? Share your predictions in the comments below Mbappe is currently in the midst of another sensational season with PSG . He has 22 goals in 23 appearances for the French side, a record that includes a strike in their Trophee des Champions victory against Toulouse. With Klopp having seemingly ruled Liverpool out of the race, that could potentially open the door to Real Madrid . The Spanish giants almost signed Mbappe in the summer of 2022, only for the striker to sign a fresh deal in the French capital. That decision left Florentino Pérez furious , who hit out at the forward for his u-turn. Real’s interest remains though. However, Carlo Ancelotti has remained tight-lipped about a potential deal. Replying to reporters after being asked about Mbappe, the Italian said: “I don’t recognise you, you must be one of the new ones who doesn’t know that I won’t speak about that [Mbappe]. I won’t touch on that topic.” Join our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Now he is hoping to dislodge Andrew Wogan, 18, who finished last season as the Boynesiders’ no 1. Barr said: “I’ve been playing in Northern Ireland, but I know how tough the league is here. Drogheda came in for me, and I’m really excited to get going. “I made my debut in the South African league when I was seventeen. The league in South Africa is different compared to here. “Playing with Portadown, I think I’ve adjusted to the differences in the climate and weather as well. I’ve been patient, waiting until January to get a move and I’m really buzzing to be here at Drogheda now. “I played my first senior international games for South Africa this year which was a dream come true for me. “I was grateful the people back home took notice of how I was playing in Northern Ireland and gave me a chance. I think I did well, we didn’t lose any of the three games, so hopefully there are eyes back on me and I can kick on now. “I want to play as many games as possible. Andrew has done really well, we’ve seen it from up North, he’s put in some great performances. “Being the older goalkeeper in the team, I can always guide him and offer advice but I also want to push him for his spot, because I am here to compete for my place in the team.” Drogs boss Kevin Doherty is delighted with the capture of a player who had limited first-team experience with Bidvest Wits, Stellenbosch and Maritzburg United before joining Portadown in 2021 Doherty said: “There were a number of clubs looking at Jethren so it’s a great one for us to have. It’s not often you sign an international player either. “I had looked at a few different goalkeepers but when I saw Jethren, when you put together his experience and his age, it fit. “Then I spoke to him, and I was so impressed just by speaking to him - his attitude, his enthusiasm, how positive he was. “Everyone knows we have a really good goalkeeper here in Andy Wogan, so this is good competition now too. “His experience plays a big part, and it is a strange dynamic with goalkeepers at times because only one can play but I’m bringing Jethren in here to compete with Andy.”","pubDate":"2024-01-04 14:19:14","image_url":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270d.png","source_id":"thesun_ie","source_priority":45285,"country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"e1bcb0d0a498a7031a93be17a16facac","title":"Soccer-Ngamaleu returns for Cameroon as teams forced into Cup of Nations squad changes","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/football/2024/01/04/soccer-ngamaleu-returns-for-cameroon-as-teams-forced-into-cup-of-nations-squad-changes","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Winger Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu will make his return to the Cameroon selection after being named on Thursday as a late replacement in their Africa Cup of Nations squad headed to the Ivory Coast later this month.

The 29-year-old Ngamaleu was one of his country's key players when they hosted the finals two years ago but was omitted from the original squad for this tournament, which kicks off next Saturday. He also played at the 2022 World Cup finals. He comes in at the last moment to replace uncapped teenager Regis Mughe, who has elected to stay with his French club Olympique de Marseille rather than go with the Indomitable Lions. Cameroon are among several countries forced to make late changes as the deadline for the submission of squads passed on Wednesday. After losing forward Amine Gouiri, Algeria will now have to do without veteran goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi, who has also suffered an injury. The 37-year-old was approaching his 100th cap but is replaced by Saudi-based Mustafa Zaghba, the Algerian federation said. Egypt have lost uncapped Ahmed Nabil Kouka, who had been in top form for African champions Al Ahly and was an exciting call-up, to a foot injury suffered in training. He is replaced by Mohanad Lashin. Fullback Osama Galal, who suffered a knee injury, was replaced on Wednesday by Yasser Ibrahim, whose original omission from the squad had been widely criticised by pundits in Egypt. Tunisia have allowed Mortadha Ben Ouanes to withdraw for what the federation said were family reasons and replaced the Turkish-based striker with Seifeddine Jaziri. The 30-year-old Jaziri was Tunisia’s lead attacker at the last Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon two years ago. Mauritania goalkeeper Babacar Diop underwent surgery on Wednesday after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in training in Tunisia, where they are preparing for the tournament. A replacement has yet to be announced. The 24 participating countries had until Wednesday to name their squads, which can be a maximum of 27 players but also have until kickoff in their first game to replace injured players, but only after producing medical evidence.

Reports have linked Palace winger Olise with a summer move to Old Trafford Right-sided attacker would come into direct competition with misfiring Antony Mail Sport's Chief Football Reporter Sami Mokbel gives the transfer latest on Ivan Toney, Conor Gallagher and more on It's All Kicking Off By Adam Shergold for MailOnline Published: 14:30, 4 January 2024 | Updated: 14:34, 4 January 2024 e-mail View comments The January transfer window has only just opened but Manchester United 's new owners are already looking ahead to the summer. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are shortlisting transfer targets having completed their £1.3billion buy-in at Old Trafford. A report in the Evening Standard named Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise as someone the new United hierarchy are interested in. Even though the 22-year-old only signed a new four-year contract at Selhurst Park back in August, it is believed to contain a release clause which kicks in this summer. The precise amount isn't known but it would likely be a considerable sum as Palace look to protect the value of one of their star players. Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise has emerged as a transfer target for Manchester United Erik ten Hag's (left) ailing side looks like it will need further reinforcement in the summer and Sir Jim Ratcliffe (right) could give the green light for Olise Your browser does not support iframes. It's not hard to understand why Olise, a right-sided winger, represents an attractive proposition. Having missed the opening weeks of the season with a hamstring injury, he has scored five goals and supplied one assist in nine matches since his return. Olise will be crucial in Palace's efforts to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle from their current position of 14th in the Premier League. One of the many problems United have encountered this season is a lack of end product from their wide attackers and a shortage of service for £72million centre forward Rasmus Hojlund. Their Brazilian winger Antony, an £85m signing demanded by manager Erik ten Hag in 2022, hasn't provided a single goal or assist in 21 outings this season. If United sign Olise, Antony's status as their first-choice right winger would be seriously threatened. A comparison of their output in Premier League matches this season, courtesy of FBref , confirms Olise offers far more than Antony. The Palace winger's xG [Expected Goals] is 3.0 and his expected xAG [Expected Assisted Goals] is 2.7 compared to Antony's 1.4 and 2.1 respectively. Olise trumps Antony in terms of average shots per 90 minutes [3.46 to 2.39] and shots on target per 90 [1.06 to 0.50]. He also creates more chances with 5.85 Shot-creating Actions per 90 minutes to Antony's 3.48. Olise's average passes completed figure per game is 36.8 as opposed to 30.7. Right-sided winger Olise is adept at taking on opponents and has a very good end product If United signed Olise, he would be a direct competitor for misfiring Brazilian winger Antony OLISE vs MAN UNITED WIDE ATTACKERS IN PREMIER LEAGUE 2023-24 Stat Olise Antony Rashford Garnacho Appearances 9 16 19 18 Goals scored 5 0 3 3 Assists 1 0 2 2 Expected goals 3.0 1.4 5.0 3.8 Expected assists 2.7 2.1 1.9 1.8 Shots per 90min 3.46 2.39 2.79 3.63 Shots on target per 90min 1.06 0.50 0.75 0.76 Shot creating actions per 90 5.85 3.48 3.40 3.63 Average passes completed 36.8 30.7 21.8 24.7 Take-on success rate % 60.0 32.6 42.6 36.1 Source: FBref One criticism often levelled at Antony is he doesn't perform well enough when taking on defenders and the stats bear this out. He is successful in 32.6 per cent of take-ons, compared to 60 per cent for Olise. So within the small sample size of Olise's nine games this season, he is outperforming Antony in almost every area of significance to their roles. Antony will need to produce far more during the second half of the season to convince United's hierarchy they don't need to sign a replacement on the right wing. As it happens, Olise is doing a bit better in several areas of his game than Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, United's other two frequently-used wide attackers. Both Rashford and Garnacho, who are typically stationed on the left flank, have three goals and two assists to their credit in Premier League action this season. Alejandro Garnacho has been one of United's better performing wingers without sparkling Marcus Rashford's form during the current campaign is a shadow of last season's brilliance IT'S ALL KICKING OFF! It's All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football, launching with a preview show today and every week this season. It is available on MailOnline , Mail+ , YouTube , Apple Music and Spotify Your browser does not support iframes. Advertisement Rashford [5.0] and Garnacho [3.8] beat Olise [3.0] for xG, but the Palace winger trumps them when it comes to Expected Assisted Goals [2.7 compared to 1.9 for Rashford and 1.8 for Garnacho]. Olise's average shots on goal per game is higher than Rashford and only a shade lower than Garnacho, but he beats them both for getting efforts on target. His 60 per cent take-on success is also clearly better than 42.6 for Rashford and 36.1 for Garnacho, and actually from more attempts on average per game. But Olise hasn't played on the left-side since his Reading days, meaning he isn't in direct competition with Rashford or Garnacho. Olise has been in sizzling form since returning from a hamstring injury earlier in the campaign Based on the stats, however, he would walk into United's side on the right, ahead of Antony, plus Facundo Pellistri and Amad Diallo, who are rarely used. In fairness to Antony, his figures do stand up better when compared to Olise last season - the Brazilian produced more goals and assists, with his xG a healthy 6.9. Trouble is, his form has fallen off a cliff during his second season with United, his struggles representative of the side as a whole. As INEOS perform their review of United's playing side, there's no question Antony is a weak link at present and Olise could represent a good replacement if the price is right.

The Jamaican was among those Villa were willing to let go last summer but he has developed into a key player this term, scoring six goals and providing five assists to help Emery's men into second, three points behind leaders Liverpool . Bailey joined Villa in 2021 for about £25million with part of the proceeds from the £100m sale of Jack Grealish to Manchester City , and signed an initial four-year deal thought to include options for extension. But so impressive has Bailey been in the autumn and winter that Villa are keen to reward him with fresh terms and elevate him closer to Villa's top bracket of earners, which includes Emi Martinez, Tyrone Mings , Moussa Diaby and Ollie Watkins . Since Emery replaced Steven Gerrard in October 2022, Villa's wage bill has increased significantly, with Mings, Watkins, Martinez, John McGinn and Ezri Konsa among the players who have had big pay rises.

The midfielder will consequently miss the FA Cup game against the Toffees on Thursday night, and potentially the Premier League encounter with Arsenal later in the month. “As you probably saw in the game against Brentford, Michael Olise had to come off right at the end. He felt his hamstring with the last sprint he made of the game. Unfortunately for us, he won’t take part in this game,” Hodgson told the media ahead of the Everton clash. “We’ll have to nurse him through and hope he gets back as soon as possible. For how long is he out? I can’t answer that one I’m afraid. “[His character] is good. We’re hoping that this one is going to be nothing like the one that put him out of the game for nearly six months.

After his last two performances, which were so good, we were hoping he’d be stepping out tomorrow and treating us again to another great football exhibition. “He’s a bit upset that that can’t happen and as are we, but let’s not put too much of a dampener on what’s going to happen going forward.

There are multiple games taking place across Saturday and Sunday - here is our preview of five of them. A £10 wager on our three-leg acca would pay out £40.30, while the same stake on our five-leg version offers a potential return of £117.17. Find the best football bookies to place your acca with: Two of the Premier League’s biggest clubs will lock horns at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, with one of Arsenal and Liverpool destined to be eliminated in the third round. Arsenal head into this fixture with their confidence dented after a surprise pair of defeats by West Ham United and Fulham. Those losses saw the Gunners drop down to fourth in the standings and Liverpool will see this as an opportunity to inflict more damage on their title rivals. The Reds will be without Mohamed Salah and Wataru Endo for this one after that pair jetted off to the Africa Cup of Nations and Asian Cup respectively. The loss of Salah in particular is a blow, but Liverpool will still feel they can cause Arsenal plenty of problems here. ⚽ Kick things off with a Liverpool win or draw at 8/11 with bet365 ⚽ The tie of the round pits arch-rivals Sunderland and Newcastle United against one another at the Stadium of Light. These fiercest of adversaries have not met since March 2016, when the pair drew 1-1. Each of the six previous head-to-head clashes ended in a Sunderland victory. Given they are now a Championship team and Newcastle have played Champions League football this season, it will be tougher for Sunderland to emerge triumphant this time. Do not write them off, though. Newcastle are in dismal form with just one win in their last eight outings in all competitions. They conceded a huge number of chances in a 4-2 defeat by Liverpool on Monday, so Sunderland will be confident of at least finding the back of the net. ⚽ Select both teams to score at 4/6 with bet365 ⚽ Chelsea will hope 2024 brings them more success than 2023, which will be remembered as one of their worst calendar years in recent history. The Blues showed the best and worst of themselves last weekend. After storming into a 3-0 lead over Luton Town, Chelsea conceded twice late on and had to cling on for all three points. Preston North End will see this as a free hit. No one expects them to get anything from their trip to London and a loss would be seen as par for the course. Conversely, a victory would make everyone sit up and take notice. Preston will therefore be incentivised to go on the attack, not least because of Chelsea’s defensive vulnerabilities. The Blues are at least looking much better going forward, so expect goals in this one. ⚽ Go for over 2.5 goals at Stamford Bridge with 2/5 with bet365 ⚽ Back our treble with bet365 to win £40.30 from a £10 bet Add the following two bets to make it a 5-fold acca. The FA Cup holders will begin the defence of their crown when Huddersfield Town head to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Manchester City are, unsurprisingly, the favourites to lift the trophy again this year, and anyone searching for a third-round giant-killing should probably look elsewhere. Huddersfield are somewhat preoccupied with their battle against relegation to League One, with just three points separating them from the drop zone at present. Even if Pep Guardiola uses this as an opportunity to shuffle his pack after a busy December, City should have too much quality for their second-flight opponents. Guardiola’s side are magnificent at home and this should be a relatively comfortable 90 minutes for them. ⚽ Tip Manchester City to win both halves at 4/7 with bet365 ⚽ Two Championship teams will do battle at The Den this weekend, as Millwall and Leicester City seek a place in the fourth round. The Foxes are flying high in the second tier and look dead certs for promotion. After 26 rounds of fixtures, they have a 10-point lead over Ipswich Town in second and a 13-point advantage over third-placed Southampton. That gives them a significant margin for error, which should result in Enzo Maresca taking the FA Cup more seriously than he would have done had Leicester been in the play-off places. Even Premier League teams would not relish facing Maresca’s men right now, and Millwall will be up against it this weekend. ⚽ Back Leicester City to beat Millwall at 17/20 with bet365 ⚽ Back our 5-fold acca with bet365 to win £117.17 from a £10 bet Greg Lea Greg Lea is a freelance football writer from London.

The French striker has been linked with a move to Anfield for years, with his future now being the topic of conversation once more. Mbappe is out of contract at the end of the season, while he is now free to talk to foreign clubs regarding a Bosman transfer. The striker has also said that he is yet to reach a decision on his future. While Liverpool remain linked, Klopp has already dismissed the chances of his side making a move for Mbappe. \"We laugh about it,\" Klopp told Sky Germany in August following yet more links. \"I can say that I think he's a really good player but the financial conditions don't suit us at all. I wouldn't like to ruin the story now... but as far as I know, there's nothing to it.

That would be the first time.\" While Liverpool do not appear likely to sign Mbappe any time soon, they have actually attempted to make a move for him in the past. Speaking in 2022, Mbappe admitted: “I talked to Liverpool because it’s the favourite club of my mum, my mum loves Liverpool. \"I don’t know why, you will have to ask her! It’s a good club and we met them five years ago. When I was in Monaco I met them. It’s a big club.” Kylian Mbappe's future is yet to be resolved amid links with Liverpool ( Image: Getty Images) Where do you think Mbappe will end up? Share your predictions in the comments below Mbappe is currently in the midst of another sensational season with PSG . He has 22 goals in 23 appearances for the French side, a record that includes a strike in their Trophee des Champions victory against Toulouse. With Klopp having seemingly ruled Liverpool out of the race, that could potentially open the door to Real Madrid . The Spanish giants almost signed Mbappe in the summer of 2022, only for the striker to sign a fresh deal in the French capital. That decision left Florentino Pérez furious , who hit out at the forward for his u-turn. Real’s interest remains though. However, Carlo Ancelotti has remained tight-lipped about a potential deal. Replying to reporters after being asked about Mbappe, the Italian said: “I don’t recognise you, you must be one of the new ones who doesn’t know that I won’t speak about that [Mbappe]. I won’t touch on that topic.” Join our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Now he is hoping to dislodge Andrew Wogan, 18, who finished last season as the Boynesiders’ no 1. Barr said: “I’ve been playing in Northern Ireland, but I know how tough the league is here. Drogheda came in for me, and I’m really excited to get going. “I made my debut in the South African league when I was seventeen. The league in South Africa is different compared to here. “Playing with Portadown, I think I’ve adjusted to the differences in the climate and weather as well. I’ve been patient, waiting until January to get a move and I’m really buzzing to be here at Drogheda now. “I played my first senior international games for South Africa this year which was a dream come true for me. “I was grateful the people back home took notice of how I was playing in Northern Ireland and gave me a chance. I think I did well, we didn’t lose any of the three games, so hopefully there are eyes back on me and I can kick on now. “I want to play as many games as possible. Andrew has done really well, we’ve seen it from up North, he’s put in some great performances. “Being the older goalkeeper in the team, I can always guide him and offer advice but I also want to push him for his spot, because I am here to compete for my place in the team.” Drogs boss Kevin Doherty is delighted with the capture of a player who had limited first-team experience with Bidvest Wits, Stellenbosch and Maritzburg United before joining Portadown in 2021 Doherty said: “There were a number of clubs looking at Jethren so it’s a great one for us to have. It’s not often you sign an international player either. “I had looked at a few different goalkeepers but when I saw Jethren, when you put together his experience and his age, it fit. “Then I spoke to him, and I was so impressed just by speaking to him - his attitude, his enthusiasm, how positive he was. “Everyone knows we have a really good goalkeeper here in Andy Wogan, so this is good competition now too. “His experience plays a big part, and it is a strange dynamic with goalkeepers at times because only one can play but I’m bringing Jethren in here to compete with Andy.”","pubDate":"2024-01-04 14:19:14","image_url":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270d.png","source_id":"thesun_ie","source_priority":45285,"country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"e1bcb0d0a498a7031a93be17a16facac","title":"Soccer-Ngamaleu returns for Cameroon as teams forced into Cup of Nations squad changes","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/football/2024/01/04/soccer-ngamaleu-returns-for-cameroon-as-teams-forced-into-cup-of-nations-squad-changes","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Winger Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu will make his return to the Cameroon selection after being named on Thursday as a late replacement in their Africa Cup of Nations squad headed to the Ivory Coast later this month.

The 29-year-old Ngamaleu was one of his country's key players when they hosted the finals two years ago but was omitted from the original squad for this tournament, which kicks off next Saturday. He also played at the 2022 World Cup finals. He comes in at the last moment to replace uncapped teenager Regis Mughe, who has elected to stay with his French club Olympique de Marseille rather than go with the Indomitable Lions. Cameroon are among several countries forced to make late changes as the deadline for the submission of squads passed on Wednesday. After losing forward Amine Gouiri, Algeria will now have to do without veteran goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi, who has also suffered an injury. The 37-year-old was approaching his 100th cap but is replaced by Saudi-based Mustafa Zaghba, the Algerian federation said. Egypt have lost uncapped Ahmed Nabil Kouka, who had been in top form for African champions Al Ahly and was an exciting call-up, to a foot injury suffered in training. He is replaced by Mohanad Lashin. Fullback Osama Galal, who suffered a knee injury, was replaced on Wednesday by Yasser Ibrahim, whose original omission from the squad had been widely criticised by pundits in Egypt. Tunisia have allowed Mortadha Ben Ouanes to withdraw for what the federation said were family reasons and replaced the Turkish-based striker with Seifeddine Jaziri. The 30-year-old Jaziri was Tunisia’s lead attacker at the last Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon two years ago. Mauritania goalkeeper Babacar Diop underwent surgery on Wednesday after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in training in Tunisia, where they are preparing for the tournament. A replacement has yet to be announced. The 24 participating countries had until Wednesday to name their squads, which can be a maximum of 27 players but also have until kickoff in their first game to replace injured players, but only after producing medical evidence.
