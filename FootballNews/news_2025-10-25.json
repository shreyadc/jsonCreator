While he probably had the bank account to pick up just about any Blue Jays jersey past or present that he’d like, Drake opted to rep a Toronto high school — and a certain late mayor.Drake was wearing a Rob Ford-branded Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School jacket, the school that used to have one of the most notorious politicians in Canadian history as their head football coach even while he was in office.Many fans online have been noting that this World Series might be an extension of Drake’s long-running beef with Kendrick Lamar, who was born in Compton, California and frequently wears a Dodgers hat.DID DRAKE CURSE THE BLUE JAYS?For years, sports fans have been wondering if Drake’s cursed their teams, given his tendency to be a bit of a bandwagon fan.But at least in the immediate aftermath, the Blue Jays actually turned things around shortly after he was shown on screen. Trailing 2-0 before Drake was shown, Toronto tied things up the very next half-inning on a Daulton Varsho two-run homer that marked their first runs of the World Series.

While he probably had the bank account to pick up just about any Blue Jays jersey past or present that he’d like, Drake opted to rep a Toronto high school — and a certain late mayor.Drake was wearing a Rob Ford-branded Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School jacket, the school that used to have one of the most notorious politicians in Canadian history as their head football coach even while he was in office.Many fans online have been noting that this World Series might be an extension of Drake’s long-running beef with Kendrick Lamar, who was born in Compton, California and frequently wears a Dodgers hat.DID DRAKE CURSE THE BLUE JAYS?For years, sports fans have been wondering if Drake’s cursed their teams, given his tendency to be a bit of a bandwagon fan.But at least in the immediate aftermath, the Blue Jays actually turned things around shortly after he was shown on screen. Trailing 2-0 before Drake was shown, Toronto tied things up the very next half-inning on a Daulton Varsho two-run homer that marked their first runs of the World Series.
