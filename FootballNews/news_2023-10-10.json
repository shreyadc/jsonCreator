The 30-year-old became the first Scottish footballer to play in the Israeli top-flight when he made the move from Portsmouth to Ashdod in the summer. Robertson said the chance to play abroad was too good to turn down and arrived in Israel excited for a new chapter in his football career. But the defender, who made 68 appearances for Aberdeen before joining Blackpool in 2015, has managed to safely return to Britain after a 26-hour wait for a flight in Tel Aviv Airport. More than 900 people have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli military, since Saturday’s unprecedented attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas with dozens more taken hostage. Authorities in Gaza have said around 700 people have been killed in the territory and the West Bank. Speaking to Sky Sports, Robertson recounted his frantic journey back to Britain following the attacks on Saturday morning. He said: “I am just glad to be home, I guess. “The 48 hours since Saturday morning were hectic. “We were staying in the north of Israel for a game on Saturday evening and I was woken up by one of my teammates at 8am to say the game was off and that the country had been attacked. “At that moment we made the decision to get back on the bus and drive to Ashdod which is 20 minutes from Gaza. “It maybe wasn’t the safest thing to do but the club acted very professionally and quickly. “They told all of the foreign players to get their passport, pack a suitcase and get to an airport as soon as possible. “Thankfully they managed to book us all flights home. “I managed to spend 26 hours in Tel Aviv Airport and I had two cancelled flights before I finally managed to get a flight to Budapest on Sunday evening. “I stayed there on Sunday night and flew back from there.” Robertson was enjoying life in Israel and had scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 draw against Maccabi Petah Tikva last month. He has played in four of Ashdod’s five league fixtures so far. Robertson confirmed on social media on Monday that he had returned home. In a post containing a video of the aftermath of a rocket strike on a neighbourhood close to where he had been living, he wrote: “Madness seeing this. Thankfully back in the UK now safe and well.” Robertson is keeping in close contact with his teammates who are still in Israel. He said: “When I signed for Ashdod, it is something you never expect to happen. “There is always the worry that you might get a few rockets from Gaza into Israel which happens yearly, I think. “I never thought something like this would happen where it breaks out into a war. “It is a crazy situation and very tragic and sad what has happened. “I’m still in touch with my Israeli teammates who are there, living in Ashdod and a few who live closer to Gaza in a place called Ashkelon. “I saw on the news that there was a report for everyone in Ashkelon, where four of my teammates live, to get out of the city by 5pm. “They were going to head further north to Israel to hopefully get some safety there. “It is very worrying for them. “I just hope all my teammates and everyone is safe. “We have a team chat on Whatsapp and they have been sending lots of videos and messages to keep updated. “I think Ashdod got hit by a rocket yesterday which thankfully didn’t harm anyone. “It is a crazy situation and I don’t think any of the Israeli players have seen anything like this before. “There is a possibility that some of the younger players could get called up. “It is a very worrying time.” Playing abroad was long-term aim Robertson was only three months into his time in the country but was loving the experience of playing football outside of the United Kingdom for the first time in his career. He said: “I have always wanted to play abroad. “My agent got in touch in the summer saying a couple of teams in Israel were interested. “I did a lot of research and I have genuinely enjoyed my time in the three months there so far. “Israel is a special country and an amazing place. “The lifestyle is good and the standard of football is very good. “You never think something like this is going to happen. “I don’t think they have witnessed something like this for 50 years so for it to happen when I’m there is just a bit crazy.” Madness seeing this. 🇮🇱🙏🏻 Thankfully back in the UK now safe and well. — Clark Robertson (@robertson_3) Keen to return when safe to do so Robertson says he will return to the country to play for Ashdod when it is deemed safe to do so. The Aberdonian added: “I had someone from the club phone me this morning to ask how I was. “The main concern is that they are safe over there. “They were saying it could be a few weeks or it could be months – they just don’t know at this point. “When it is safe and everything calms down I am more than happy to return. “I had no problems during the three months I was there. “There was no trouble. “I think everyone was taken aback by how quickly everything escalated.”","pubDate":"2023-10-10 19:38:22","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/10764862-1_35623793-e1696965688229-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a8efe8d4bdaa87efa54a2760e863efcb","title":"Gosens packt Pakete für Obdachlose: \"Es trifft und berührt\"","link":"https://www.freiepresse.de/sport/gosens-packt-pakete-fuer-obdachlose-es-trifft-und-beruehrt-artikel13083117","keywords":["Fußball"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Noch vor dem ersten Training in den USA steht für Robin Gosens bei der Nationalmannschaft ein Termin abseits des Rasens an.

By Sam Brookes For Mailonline Published: 18:09 BST, 10 October 2023 | Updated: 19:20 BST, 10 October 2023 e-mail 7 shares 47 View comments Netherlands head coach Ronald Koeman has admitted he is still bitter about Ryan Gravenberch rejecting a national team call-up last month. The 21-year-old midfielder signed for Liverpool at the end of the summer transfer window in a £35million deal and opted to reject joining up with the Dutch Under-21 squad in September in order to focus on settling in at Anfield. Gravenberch's decision did not go down well with Koeman at the time, and his opinion on the situation hasn't changed in the subsequent weeks. Gravenberch has not been called up for international duty this week and Koeman has explained that his anger at last month's snub influenced his decision to omit the rising star, while he also referenced his lack of playing time since arriving on Merseyside. 'We do have a certain opinion about cancelling for the Dutch juniors or the Dutch national team,' Koeman said.

'But I don't think he has played much yet. Last Thursday there was a competition.' Despite being out of the picture for now, Koeman has offered Gravenberch hope that he can work his way back into the squad if he starts to impress at Liverpool. 'I still think he is a great talent. I hope he can develop at Liverpool and play more, because then he will always be a player for the Dutch national team,' Koeman added. Gravenberch has made four substitute appearances in the Premier League this term, but is yet to make a top flight start. He got his first goal for the Reds in the Europa League last week in a 2-0 win against Union Saint Gilloise, suggesting he is starting to find his feet in England. However, Netherlands will have to cope without him when they take on France and Greece in Euro 2024 qualifiers over the coming days. Koeman's men still have work to do to secure their place in next year's tournament in Germany. They currently sit second in Group B, six points behind France having played a game fewer.

Beuve was in goal for third-tier French side US Avranches when GOAL, who were leading 1-0, were awarded a penalty in injury-time. Florian Raspentino attempted the infamous Panenka spot-kick - a chip down the middle of the goal made famous by Antonin Panenka. However, Beuve stood firm and caught the weak attempt.

Spurs lead the Premier League on goal difference from north London rivals Arsenal going into the international break and are unbeaten in the league since the former Socceroos boss took charge. He is the first Australian to be appointed in England’s top flight and has caused a sensation in his home country by transforming the club’s playing style in just a few months. 26 mandem in London and ready to take on England and New Zealand! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 v 🇦🇺 – 14.10.23 – 5:45am AEDT🇦🇺 v 🇳🇿 – 18.10.23 – 5:45am AEDT📺📱💻 Channel 10, Paramount+, 10 Play — Subway Socceroos (@Socceroos) Luongo, who after helping Ipswich to second place in the Championship has been recalled to the national team for the first time since 2019 for Friday’s meeting with England at Wembley and next week’s game against New Zealand, was an unused member of Postecoglou’s squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He has featured in every one of his club’s league fixtures this campaign as Kieran McKenna’s side have won nine of their first 11 games to install themselves as early favourites to land consecutive promotions. It follows a period in the international wilderness during which he endured difficult spells at Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough, with injuries contributing to a lack of playing time and a “difficult time mentally”. His last call-up was in October 2019, but he has impressed enough at Portman Road to earn a recall from boss Graham Arnold. Australia reached the last 16 of the World Cup in Qatar under Arnold – their fifth consecutive finals – before being eliminated by eventual winners Argentina, their best performance at the tournament since 2006. And Luongo, who was long-listed for the Ballon d’Or in 2015 in part for his showing at the Socceroos’ victorious Asian Cup campaign, said that though there are comparisons to be made, the two coaches should be judged on their own merits. “They’re completely different, like most managers,” he said. “Ange has his ways, Arnie has his ways. (The 2014 World Cup) was definitely an enjoyable time. (Postecoglou) brought me from Swindon in League One and he gave me my chance. “What he’s doing now is incredible. Every Aussie is following him now, I think every Aussie is secretly a Tottenham supporter. It’s great to watch from afar. “Being in this country, I think he’s just a genuine person, you see that in his media interviews. He’s got so much passion for the game, he’s just hungry for success. And that’s what we have here (with Arnold).” Australia are ranked 27th in the world but were buoyed by their success in Qatar, knocking out Euro 2020 semi-finalists Denmark to progress from their group. They will be looking to replicate the result the last time they met England in London, running out 3-1 winners at West Ham’s Upton Park as Three Lions manager Sven-Goran Eriksson made 11 half-time substitutions. “England are one of the best in the world,” said Luongo. “But even at Ipswich we look at teams ahead of us who we want to replicate, (like) Man City, the best team in the world. “We’re alright, we’re doing well, we’re a good Australia team. People underestimate that. 📋 London calling for these boys 📞 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 v 🇦🇺 – 14.10.23 – 5:45am AEDT🇦🇺 v 🇳🇿 – 18.10.23 – 5:45am AEDT📱💻📺 Live on Channel 10, 10 Play — Subway Socceroos (@Socceroos) “No matter who you play I think Aussies have that DNA that you don’t just roll over and give up. That Argentina game (in Qatar), I watched it, if it goes on for another 30 minutes, we get an equaliser, easily an equaliser. It’s just the nature of football. When momentum is with you, you never know.” He added that there have been significant changes to the national team set-up since his last call-up. “(There are) a lot of young players,” he said. “The staff, there’s a lot more backing now. The set-up has (improved), there are no corners cut. Things you wouldn’t even think of are covered, more beds and physios, the food; everything. They’re trying to create an atmosphere that’s as top-level as you can get. “The expectation now is really high. The World Cup is a big evidence that we can beat top teams, especially European teams. “I think we’re definitely in a transition period of younger players coming through. At the moment you can’t really judge the team based on the first year of four years building up to a World Cup. “The manager’s got three more years to build a team and see where they get to. These games are a building process.

The 30-year-old became the first Scottish footballer to play in the Israeli top-flight when he made the move from Portsmouth to Ashdod in the summer. Robertson said the chance to play abroad was too good to turn down and arrived in Israel excited for a new chapter in his football career. But the defender, who made 68 appearances for Aberdeen before joining Blackpool in 2015, has managed to safely return to Britain after a 26-hour wait for a flight in Tel Aviv Airport. More than 900 people have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli military, since Saturday’s unprecedented attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas with dozens more taken hostage. Authorities in Gaza have said around 700 people have been killed in the territory and the West Bank. Speaking to Sky Sports, Robertson recounted his frantic journey back to Britain following the attacks on Saturday morning. He said: “I am just glad to be home, I guess. “The 48 hours since Saturday morning were hectic. “We were staying in the north of Israel for a game on Saturday evening and I was woken up by one of my teammates at 8am to say the game was off and that the country had been attacked. “At that moment we made the decision to get back on the bus and drive to Ashdod which is 20 minutes from Gaza. “It maybe wasn’t the safest thing to do but the club acted very professionally and quickly. “They told all of the foreign players to get their passport, pack a suitcase and get to an airport as soon as possible. “Thankfully they managed to book us all flights home. “I managed to spend 26 hours in Tel Aviv Airport and I had two cancelled flights before I finally managed to get a flight to Budapest on Sunday evening. “I stayed there on Sunday night and flew back from there.” Robertson was enjoying life in Israel and had scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 draw against Maccabi Petah Tikva last month. He has played in four of Ashdod’s five league fixtures so far. Robertson confirmed on social media on Monday that he had returned home. In a post containing a video of the aftermath of a rocket strike on a neighbourhood close to where he had been living, he wrote: “Madness seeing this. Thankfully back in the UK now safe and well.” Robertson is keeping in close contact with his teammates who are still in Israel. He said: “When I signed for Ashdod, it is something you never expect to happen. “There is always the worry that you might get a few rockets from Gaza into Israel which happens yearly, I think. “I never thought something like this would happen where it breaks out into a war. “It is a crazy situation and very tragic and sad what has happened. “I’m still in touch with my Israeli teammates who are there, living in Ashdod and a few who live closer to Gaza in a place called Ashkelon. “I saw on the news that there was a report for everyone in Ashkelon, where four of my teammates live, to get out of the city by 5pm. “They were going to head further north to Israel to hopefully get some safety there. “It is very worrying for them. “I just hope all my teammates and everyone is safe. “We have a team chat on Whatsapp and they have been sending lots of videos and messages to keep updated. “I think Ashdod got hit by a rocket yesterday which thankfully didn’t harm anyone. “It is a crazy situation and I don’t think any of the Israeli players have seen anything like this before. “There is a possibility that some of the younger players could get called up. “It is a very worrying time.” Playing abroad was long-term aim Robertson was only three months into his time in the country but was loving the experience of playing football outside of the United Kingdom for the first time in his career. He said: “I have always wanted to play abroad. “My agent got in touch in the summer saying a couple of teams in Israel were interested. “I did a lot of research and I have genuinely enjoyed my time in the three months there so far. “Israel is a special country and an amazing place. “The lifestyle is good and the standard of football is very good. “You never think something like this is going to happen. “I don’t think they have witnessed something like this for 50 years so for it to happen when I’m there is just a bit crazy.” Madness seeing this. 🇮🇱🙏🏻 Thankfully back in the UK now safe and well. — Clark Robertson (@robertson_3) Keen to return when safe to do so Robertson says he will return to the country to play for Ashdod when it is deemed safe to do so. The Aberdonian added: “I had someone from the club phone me this morning to ask how I was. “The main concern is that they are safe over there. “They were saying it could be a few weeks or it could be months – they just don’t know at this point. “When it is safe and everything calms down I am more than happy to return. “I had no problems during the three months I was there. “There was no trouble. “I think everyone was taken aback by how quickly everything escalated.”","pubDate":"2023-10-10 19:38:22","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/10764862-1_35623793-e1696965688229-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a8efe8d4bdaa87efa54a2760e863efcb","title":"Gosens packt Pakete für Obdachlose: \"Es trifft und berührt\"","link":"https://www.freiepresse.de/sport/gosens-packt-pakete-fuer-obdachlose-es-trifft-und-beruehrt-artikel13083117","keywords":["Fußball"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Noch vor dem ersten Training in den USA steht für Robin Gosens bei der Nationalmannschaft ein Termin abseits des Rasens an.

By Sam Brookes For Mailonline Published: 18:09 BST, 10 October 2023 | Updated: 19:20 BST, 10 October 2023 e-mail 7 shares 47 View comments Netherlands head coach Ronald Koeman has admitted he is still bitter about Ryan Gravenberch rejecting a national team call-up last month. The 21-year-old midfielder signed for Liverpool at the end of the summer transfer window in a £35million deal and opted to reject joining up with the Dutch Under-21 squad in September in order to focus on settling in at Anfield. Gravenberch's decision did not go down well with Koeman at the time, and his opinion on the situation hasn't changed in the subsequent weeks. Gravenberch has not been called up for international duty this week and Koeman has explained that his anger at last month's snub influenced his decision to omit the rising star, while he also referenced his lack of playing time since arriving on Merseyside. 'We do have a certain opinion about cancelling for the Dutch juniors or the Dutch national team,' Koeman said.

'But I don't think he has played much yet. Last Thursday there was a competition.' Despite being out of the picture for now, Koeman has offered Gravenberch hope that he can work his way back into the squad if he starts to impress at Liverpool. 'I still think he is a great talent. I hope he can develop at Liverpool and play more, because then he will always be a player for the Dutch national team,' Koeman added. Gravenberch has made four substitute appearances in the Premier League this term, but is yet to make a top flight start. He got his first goal for the Reds in the Europa League last week in a 2-0 win against Union Saint Gilloise, suggesting he is starting to find his feet in England. However, Netherlands will have to cope without him when they take on France and Greece in Euro 2024 qualifiers over the coming days. Koeman's men still have work to do to secure their place in next year's tournament in Germany. They currently sit second in Group B, six points behind France having played a game fewer.

Anthony Beuve was the unlikeliest of heroes for US Avranches when he equalised in the 95th minute against Grand Ouest Association Lyonnaise (GOAL) FC. Beuve was in goal for third-tier French side US Avranches when GOAL, who were leading 1-0, were awarded a penalty in injury-time. Florian Raspentino attempted the infamous Panenka spot-kick - a chip down the middle of the goal made famous by Antonin Panenka. However, Beuve stood firm and caught the weak attempt. And a few minutes later, Beuve ran up the other end after US Avranches were awarded a free kick.

The 30-year-old became the first Scottish footballer to play in the Israeli top-flight when he made the move from Portsmouth to Ashdod in the summer. Robertson said the chance to play abroad was too good to turn down and arrived in Israel excited for a new chapter in his football career. But the defender, who made 68 appearances for Aberdeen before joining Blackpool in 2015, has managed to safely return to Britain after a 26-hour wait for a flight in Tel Aviv Airport. More than 900 people have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli military, since Saturday’s unprecedented attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas with dozens more taken hostage. Authorities in Gaza have said around 700 people have been killed in the territory and the West Bank. Speaking to Sky Sports, Robertson recounted his frantic journey back to Britain following the attacks on Saturday morning. He said: “I am just glad to be home, I guess. “The 48 hours since Saturday morning were hectic. “We were staying in the north of Israel for a game on Saturday evening and I was woken up by one of my teammates at 8am to say the game was off and that the country had been attacked. “At that moment we made the decision to get back on the bus and drive to Ashdod which is 20 minutes from Gaza. “It maybe wasn’t the safest thing to do but the club acted very professionally and quickly. “They told all of the foreign players to get their passport, pack a suitcase and get to an airport as soon as possible. “Thankfully they managed to book us all flights home. “I managed to spend 26 hours in Tel Aviv Airport and I had two cancelled flights before I finally managed to get a flight to Budapest on Sunday evening. “I stayed there on Sunday night and flew back from there.” Robertson was enjoying life in Israel and had scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 draw against Maccabi Petah Tikva last month. He has played in four of Ashdod’s five league fixtures so far. Robertson confirmed on social media on Monday that he had returned home. In a post containing a video of the aftermath of a rocket strike on a neighbourhood close to where he had been living, he wrote: “Madness seeing this. Thankfully back in the UK now safe and well.” Robertson is keeping in close contact with his teammates who are still in Israel. He said: “When I signed for Ashdod, it is something you never expect to happen. “There is always the worry that you might get a few rockets from Gaza into Israel which happens yearly, I think. “I never thought something like this would happen where it breaks out into a war. “It is a crazy situation and very tragic and sad what has happened. “I’m still in touch with my Israeli teammates who are there, living in Ashdod and a few who live closer to Gaza in a place called Ashkelon. “I saw on the news that there was a report for everyone in Ashkelon, where four of my teammates live, to get out of the city by 5pm. “They were going to head further north to Israel to hopefully get some safety there. “It is very worrying for them. “I just hope all my teammates and everyone is safe. “We have a team chat on Whatsapp and they have been sending lots of videos and messages to keep updated. “I think Ashdod got hit by a rocket yesterday which thankfully didn’t harm anyone. “It is a crazy situation and I don’t think any of the Israeli players have seen anything like this before. “There is a possibility that some of the younger players could get called up. “It is a very worrying time.” Playing abroad was long-term aim Robertson was only three months into his time in the country but was loving the experience of playing football outside of the United Kingdom for the first time in his career. He said: “I have always wanted to play abroad. “My agent got in touch in the summer saying a couple of teams in Israel were interested. “I did a lot of research and I have genuinely enjoyed my time in the three months there so far. “Israel is a special country and an amazing place. “The lifestyle is good and the standard of football is very good. “You never think something like this is going to happen. “I don’t think they have witnessed something like this for 50 years so for it to happen when I’m there is just a bit crazy.” Madness seeing this. 🇮🇱🙏🏻 Thankfully back in the UK now safe and well. — Clark Robertson (@robertson_3) Keen to return when safe to do so Robertson says he will return to the country to play for Ashdod when it is deemed safe to do so. The Aberdonian added: “I had someone from the club phone me this morning to ask how I was. “The main concern is that they are safe over there. “They were saying it could be a few weeks or it could be months – they just don’t know at this point. “When it is safe and everything calms down I am more than happy to return. “I had no problems during the three months I was there. “There was no trouble. “I think everyone was taken aback by how quickly everything escalated.”","pubDate":"2023-10-10 19:38:22","image_url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/10764862-1_35623793-e1696965688229-140x84.jpg","source_id":"pressandjournal","source_priority":105351,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a8efe8d4bdaa87efa54a2760e863efcb","title":"Gosens packt Pakete für Obdachlose: \"Es trifft und berührt\"","link":"https://www.freiepresse.de/sport/gosens-packt-pakete-fuer-obdachlose-es-trifft-und-beruehrt-artikel13083117","keywords":["Fußball"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Noch vor dem ersten Training in den USA steht für Robin Gosens bei der Nationalmannschaft ein Termin abseits des Rasens an.

Gemeinsam mit Ex-Nationalspieler und NFL-Footballern nahm Gosens an einer Charity-Aktion der Stiftung Nationalmannschaft in Foxborough teil. \"Wir müssen uns alle immer wieder vor Augen führen, in welcher privilegierten Lage wir uns befinden.

Von den Teamärzten gab es vor der ersten Nacht in Foxborough auch für Bundestrainer Nagelsmann einen Rat. Rund 150 Menschen sind von der islamistischen Hamas als Geiseln genommen worden. Unter ihnen sind auch Amerikaner. Im ersten Kriegsherbst brachten Unternehmer in Annaberg friedlichen Protest gegen die hohen Energiepreise auf die Straße.

By Sam Brookes For Mailonline Published: 18:09 BST, 10 October 2023 | Updated: 19:20 BST, 10 October 2023 e-mail 7 shares 47 View comments Netherlands head coach Ronald Koeman has admitted he is still bitter about Ryan Gravenberch rejecting a national team call-up last month. The 21-year-old midfielder signed for Liverpool at the end of the summer transfer window in a £35million deal and opted to reject joining up with the Dutch Under-21 squad in September in order to focus on settling in at Anfield. Gravenberch's decision did not go down well with Koeman at the time, and his opinion on the situation hasn't changed in the subsequent weeks. Gravenberch has not been called up for international duty this week and Koeman has explained that his anger at last month's snub influenced his decision to omit the rising star, while he also referenced his lack of playing time since arriving on Merseyside. 'We do have a certain opinion about cancelling for the Dutch juniors or the Dutch national team,' Koeman said.

'But I don't think he has played much yet. Last Thursday there was a competition.' Despite being out of the picture for now, Koeman has offered Gravenberch hope that he can work his way back into the squad if he starts to impress at Liverpool. 'I still think he is a great talent. I hope he can develop at Liverpool and play more, because then he will always be a player for the Dutch national team,' Koeman added. Gravenberch has made four substitute appearances in the Premier League this term, but is yet to make a top flight start. He got his first goal for the Reds in the Europa League last week in a 2-0 win against Union Saint Gilloise, suggesting he is starting to find his feet in England. However, Netherlands will have to cope without him when they take on France and Greece in Euro 2024 qualifiers over the coming days. Koeman's men still have work to do to secure their place in next year's tournament in Germany. They currently sit second in Group B, six points behind France having played a game fewer.

Anthony Beuve was the unlikeliest of heroes for US Avranches when he equalised in the 95th minute against Grand Ouest Association Lyonnaise (GOAL) FC. Beuve was in goal for third-tier French side US Avranches when GOAL, who were leading 1-0, were awarded a penalty in injury-time. Florian Raspentino attempted the infamous Panenka spot-kick - a chip down the middle of the goal made famous by Antonin Panenka. However, Beuve stood firm and caught the weak attempt. And a few minutes later, Beuve ran up the other end after US Avranches were awarded a free kick.
