The new wife of the 30-year-old Crystal Palace legend posted black and white pictures from the wedding on Instagram, including photos of them cutting the cake, together outside the venue and during the celebrations. In attendance was said to be a host of former team mates as well as Zaha's new partner at Croydon Athletic, Stormzy . It is a huge summer in more ways than one for Zaha, who is currently a free agent after leaving Crystal Palace on a free. Across two spells with the Eagles, the Ivory Coast international made 458 appearances for the club, scoring 90 goals. Former Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha has married long term partner Paige Bannister His wife posted a series of black and white photographs from the wedding ceremony online Among the guests in attendance was rapper Stormzy, who is set to partner with Zaha as co-owners of ninth-tier side Croydon Athletic Despite uncertainty over where his future lies, Zaha has cut a relaxed figure this summer. Last month, he was pictured on a stag do with five friends, with each member of the party wearing custom t-shirts each labelled with 'Wilf's Stag'. Meanwhile, the former Manchester United man had to wear a beige top with the words 'game over' etched into it while also showing a groom with a ball and chain tied to his leg and a bride turned away. It was then reported last week that Zaha and Stormzy have teamed up to buy their childhood ninth-tier football team in Croydon - and plan to use their cash on an 'exciting' journey for the club. Subject to FA and league approval, the prospective new owners will operate and develop the team as part of a project that will see them return to their roots. A third member of the consortium, Danny Young, acted as the kit manager and head of player care at Palace before stepping down at the end of the season. Announcing the deal, AFC Croydon said: 'A three person consortium comprised of Wilfried Zaha, Stormzy and Danny Young has exchanged contracts with the existing ownership of AFC Croydon Athletic to acquire the assets of the club. 'The consortium will own, operate and develop their childhood hometown football club. Zaha's future remains uncertain after leaving Crystal Palace following the end of his contract 'Whilst completion is subject to legislative and governance procedures, the three consortium members are excited about developing a community asset in the borough that gave them their own opportunities. 'They hope to take the entire community on this exciting journey with them.' In terms of his playing career, Mail Sport reported last week that the Saudi Pro League are once again trying to tempt him. Zaha has a number of offers on the table, including one from the Eagles worth £200,000 a week plus a hefty signing on fee. Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lazio have all made a pitch to the Ivory Coast international while he initially rejected a proposal from Al-Nassr.

The 20-year-old is aware of the list of stars that have pulled on the famous white shirt over the years, previously citing Zinedine Zidane as a role model, but is targeting a long and successful career of his own. “That is the motivation for the move in the first place, I want to be at a club that is going to be competing for titles and I want to try and help the team and club be as brilliant as it has been for all of time really,” he told the PA news agency. “Now is my chance to be part of that history and that goes hand in hand because I know the club wants to win and I want to win so hopefully it will happen. “It grabs you on its own, the size of the club is already surreal when you think about it, but when you add into that the project they have got in place, it was really important I made this step because it is just the place to be for me.” For most, the prospect of joining Real Madrid in a big-money move at such a young age would be daunting, but Bellingham’s journey has stood him in good stead. Hola Madridistas!🤍It is the proudest day of my life to join the greatest club in the history of the game. I will give absolutely everything I have to help this team win. Thank you for the amazing welcome. HALA MADRID!!!🤍🤍🤍 — Jude Bellingham (@BellinghamJude) Having made his debut for Birmingham as a 16-year-old and then joining Dortmund one year later, he has done things differently. And that means the price tag certainly will not weigh heavy on him. “I have had a very different experience to most young players, especially young English players,” he said. “My journey has taken me to three different countries, without playing in the Premier League, so it is very different. “I am always reminded of it when I am away with the national team and see the journeys of the other players. “But it is something I am really proud of, the risks I have taken and long may it continue. I just try and take everything in my stride really. “Pressure has followed me everywhere to this point. I was 15 and 16 when I started playing with the first team at Birmingham and felt that like a pressure that could be matched by no other really, so at each stage of my life the pressure has increased. “Until now I have always proved I can handle it and if I was worried about it I probably wouldn’t have made the move. “Because I know I have the right people around me to support me through it I think it is a great fit.” Bellingham may now be one of the most recognisable names in the game, but it was not too long ago that he was playing on the parks of Stourbridge as a child. He is now an ambassador for McDonald’s Fun Football programme, the largest grassroots programme in the UK for 5-11 year olds, where 250,000 children have had access to free football in the last 12 months. We could tell you why is so special – or, we could ask our newest ambassador to do it for us 😆 Have a look at why he decided to join the family ⬇️ — McDonald’s Fun Football (@FunFootballUK) Bellingham added: “This is massively important, you look around and see the environment that McDonald’s has created, all these girls and boys, whatever ages, just coming together and playing football without pressure and with loads of smiles. It’s a great initiative and to celebrate 250,000 kids being given the opportunity to play football this season is just brilliant. We’ve had a great day. “I remember my mum and dad taking me to stuff like this all the time, where it is just about enjoyment. “These are the kind of days that properly get you into the game, I am not looking around thinking, ‘I wonder who is going to be the next superstar’ but you never know how it affects the mindset of one of these kids, in terms of chasing the dream of being a footballer.” ::Jude Bellingham was speaking at the largest ever McDonald’s Fun Football session to celebrate the landmark of over 250,000 children across the UK benefiting from access to free football this season.

Mohamed Toubache-Ter a laissé entendre que l’ailier droit du Stade Rennais, Benjamin Bourigeaud, allait prolonger son contrat avec le club Rouge et Noir. « Annonce imminente du côté des Bourigeaud », a fait savoir l’insider sur Twitter avant de préciser dans son tweet et en commentaire qu’il s’agissait d’une bonne nouvelle pour les Rennais. En septembre dernier, l’ancien Lensois avait déjà prolongé son contrat jusqu’en juin 2026 avec Rennes. OGC Nice : la première recrue estivale connue ? Alors qu’ils très pourraient prochainement formuler une offre de 5 millions d’euros à leurs homologues du FC Nantes pour recruter Moses Simon , les dirigeants de l’OGC Nice seraient tout proches de boucler l’arrivée du latéral droit de Twente, Joshua Brenet, puisque ça chaufferait pour son arrivée au Gym, toujours d’après Mohamed Toubache-Ter. RC Strasbourg : après Bakwa, le RCSA contrarie le RC Lens avec Koita Alors que le RC Strasbourg a officialisé ce dimanche soir la nomination de Patrick Vieira comme nouvel entraîneur , le club alsacien avancerait bien pour la signature de l'attaquant du RB Salzbourg, Sekou Koita, d'après L'Équipe. Après l'ailier gauche des Girondins de Bordeaux, Dilane Bakwa , c'est donc une deuxième cible que se batailleraient le RCSA et le RC Lens sur le marché des transferts cet été. Mais aussi... LOSC : coup dur pour Diakité Touché à l'épaule depuis ce samedi, le latéral droit du LOSC, Bafodé Diakité, a été contraint de déclarer forfait avec les Bleuets pour le quart de finale de l'Euro Espoirs 2023 contre l'Ukraine. Montpellier : un gardien en approche ! Si l'on en croit les informations du média bosnien Faktor, Montpellier, en quête d'un portier cet été pour combler les départs de Matis Carvalho et de Bingourou Kamara, serait proche de signer le gardien bosnien du FK Sarajevo, Belmin Dizdarevic. Lorient : un Camerounais va signer, Soumano a la cote Alors qu'ils poussent pour recruter définitivement Romain Faivre, prêté sans option d’achat lors de la deuxième partie de saison par l'OL, les dirigeants de Lorient devraient bientôt enregistrer l’arrivée du jeune milieu de terrain camerounais, Arthur Avom Ebong, selon les informations de Ouest-France. Le quotidien régional ajoute que plusieurs écuries de Ligue 2 ont manifesté un intérêt concret pour le jeune buteur Sambou Soumano : Rodez, Grenoble, Quevilly Rouen Métropole et l’US Concarneau, fraîchement promue dans l’antichambre de l’élite. Le FCL serait favorable à lui donner encore du temps de jeu à l’étage inférieur la saison prochaine. Régis Le Bris, lui, est absent à la reprise de l'entraînement ce jour ! Et enfin... RC Strasbourg : Vieira n’arrive pas seul Officialisé hier soir par le RC Strasbourg, Patrick Vieira sera présent au centre d’entraînement avec une partie d’un staff qui doit encore être complété. À son côté, son adjoint historique Kristian Wilson, qui le secondait déjà lors de sa première expérience sur un banc, au New York City FC (2016-2018) avant de le suivre à Nice et à Crystal Palace. D’après L’Équipe, deux arrivées supplémentaires sont attendues, dont celle d’un autre adjoint, pour venir travailler de concert avec les « historiques », le médecin Jean-Marc Kuentz, le coach des gardiens Stéphane Cassard et le préparateur physique Guillaume Jahier. « Aujourd’hui, un nouveau cycle commence pour le Racing et c’est excitant pour un entraîneur de pouvoir construire quelque chose tout en s’appuyant sur les valeurs qui font la force d’un club », a déclaré Vieira, qui sera présenté à la presse dans la journée. AS Monaco : Pléa valide l’arrivée d’Hütter Prochain entraîneur de l’AS Monaco, Adi Hütter reste peu connu en France. Alassane Pléa, qui l’a côtoyé du côté du Borussia Mönchengladbach, en dit plus sur son profil et ses intention de jeu. « C’est quelqu’un de très bien, de très cool avec ses joueurs. Il provoque toujours la discussion, il aime savoir ce qu’on ressent et ce qu’on veut, il parlait beaucoup avec nous durant les séances vidéo, explique l’attaquant international à L’Équipe. Il veut des milieux agressifs à la perte du ballon, avec une grande qualité de passe pour ouvrir sur les pistons. Il nous laissait beaucoup de liberté devant mais il voulait qu’on presse à la perte du ballon. Les séances étaient intenses et ludiques. Adi est un très bon coach et un bon gars, j’ai regretté son départ. » LOSC : David encore courtisé, Ngonge dans le viseur ? Alors que deux nouveaux prétendants sont arrivés pour Jonathn David (Juve en cas de départ de Vlahovic et West Ham), Ignazio Genuardi nous apprend que le LOSC serait sur Cyrile Ngonge. Âgé de 23 ans, l'ailier belge évolue à l'Hellas Vérone et a une valeur marchande de 2 millions d'euros. Auteur de cinq buts cette saison en Serie A, l'intéressé est courtisé par plusieurs clubs européens. Girondins de Bordeaux : Elis blessé de longue durée ? Comme craint après son match avec la sélection, Alberth Elis s’est fracturé le bras. Selon Girondinfos, l’attaquant des Girondins de Bordeaux a été opéré et sera indisponible entre 6 à 8 semaines !

Having signed his contract to take over the reigns at Stamford Bridge over a month ago, the former Tottenham manager will officially get to work this week as he tries to transform the club's fortunes after a poor campaign last year. In a video shared on social media captioned 'this is where it starts', Pochettino is seen arriving at the club as he gets out the back of a grey van. He hugs various members of staff and greets others before walking into the building at Cobham to start work. Pre-season gets underway for Chelsea this week in London before a trip to the US for more preparation for the new season, which starts on the weekend of August 13. Mauricio Pochettino has arrived at Chelsea to start work as the club's new manager The former Tottenham manager greeted staff in a social media video before stepping inside The club is looking to rebuild after a rocky first year under new owner Todd Boehly This is where it starts.  #WelcomePoch pic.twitter.com/scmF0ThuON — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 3, 2023 Despite the wealth of talent at Pochettino's disposal, it won't be plain sailing for the 51-year old with plenty still to change at the club before the new season gets underway. Having already offloaded several major stars such as N'Golo Kante and Kai Havertz, eight players are still set to leave the club before the new campaign. The club is still rebuilding off the field, too, having endured a difficult opening year to Todd Boehly's reign after taking over from Roman Abramovic. He entered the building at Cobham in what is the club's first day of pre-season Mason Mount is on the verge of completing a move to Premier League rivals Manchester United New players will arrive too, but the squad will change a lot in a bid to bounce back from the 12th-place Premier League finish last season. Homegrown star Mason Mount is on the verge of completing his move to Manchester United , having arrived at the club on Monday despite Pochettino's wishes to work with the midfielder. The likes of Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic may also move on, though the former failed a medical at Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr last week, putting his expected exit in doubt. Pochettino however will be eager to get to work on a testing project, and will have plenty to sort if he is going to help the club get somewhere close to where they once were as a team.

The 25-year-old, who doesn't have any Premier League experience, is set to find himself coming up against the likes of Harry Kane and Erling Haaland next season. Luton also recently secured the signing of former Rotherham winger Chiedozie Ogbene. Rob Edwards' side are looking to strengthen their squad so that they can compete in the Premier League. Luton manager Rob Edwards praised the new signing's determination following his arrival As confirmed on their official website , The Hatters have secured the signing of Mads Andersen from Barnsley for an undisclosed fee. Andersen has been at Barnsley for four years and, although he played in League One last campaign, the Danish centre-back spent the previous three seasons in the Championship. After starting out at Brondby, for whom he made one senior appearance, Andersen had a loan spell at Koge before making the switch to Horsens. Last season Andersen came close to earning promotion to the Championship with Barnsley but they suffered late frustration against Sheffield Wednesday in the League One play-off final. Luton Town have signed defender Mads Andersen following their promotion to the top flight After finalising his move to Luton, Andersen, who was captain at Barnsley, reflected upon achieving his dream of becoming a Premier League player. He said: 'It feels very, very good. I'm very happy and I'm really looking forward to this next chapter of my life at Luton Town. 'I'm so excited. It's a dream come true. When I made my move in Denmark from Brondby to a lower team in the same division, me and my dad spoke about it and I said 'In one and a half years, I'm going to go to the Championship', and that is exactly what happened. 'During that period I also wrote on a piece of paper, 'Premier League', and stuck it on the fridge. I completely forgot about it, until my family told me, 'You put that on the fridge!'. So it's a proud moment for them as well.' Luton manager Edwards says that Andersen will bring 'quality and competition' to the squad. Andersen is Luton's second major signing this summer after the arrival of Chiedozie Ogbene Edwards said: 'I'm really pleased to get Mads on board. He has been on our recruitment team's list for a long time now. We watched a lot of him last season and he's performed really well and consistently for a prolonged period in English football. 'He's someone who can play anywhere across that back three for us. He's a real good defender, someone who loves defending, and we like ours to be able to do that. But he can play, and there is room to grow, like with anyone we want to bring in and sign. 'He's going to bring real good quality and competition into that position, with us obviously losing Sonny Bradley this summer, but the position we see Amari'i Bell in now, Mads' arrival gives us real quality and competition in that area.' Edwards spoke highly about Andersen's determination being a key quality. He said: 'He's a really good person, when I spoke to him, it was clear that he's so ambitious to play in the Premier League and very driven and determined to get into his national team, but first and foremost, he's determined to get into our team, to play and be consistent. 'We've got high hopes for Mads and are really pleased to get the deal done.'

The England midfielder appeared at United's Carrington training facility with the Red Devils at last set to secure the Chelsea star's services. Erik ten Hag 's side were rebuffed several times in their approach for Mount this summer, but at last had a fee agreed at the fifth time of asking. The player and a few members of his entourage were spotted arriving at the facility in a Mercedes early on Monday morning, entering through the back gate. With an initial £55m figure, followed by £5m in add-ons, at last agreed between the rivals after weeks of negotiations and rejected advances, the player is due at United for a medical ahead of finalising terms on a move. A Mercedes van was spotted entering Carrington with Mason Mount on board on Monday Mount is set to undergo a medical ahead of finalising his move to Man United from Chelsea Erik ten Hag's side had numerous bids turned down before at last having a figure agreed The 24-year-old is believed to be set to put pen to paper over terms at Old Trafford, signing a five-contract worth £250,000-a-week with the option of another year. And he appears set to arrive at the perfect time for Ten Hag and Co, who are due to begin their pre-season training in earnest with a friendly against rivals Leeds next week. As such, Mount could make his debut for his new club, although he will be some way from the theatre of dreams, with the game in fact taking place in Oslo, Norway. The English star arrives at Unite don the back of a trying 2022-23 season with Chelsea, in which he struggled for both form and fitness. He made just 35 appearances in all competitions for the Blues, scoring three times and providing six assists as Chelsea fell short of expectations. In total he missed 13 games of the campaign as he struggled to overcome a pelvic issue that ruled him out of the end of the season under Frank Lampard. But despite his underwhelming displays last term, United were keen to land their target, and he looks set to replace Christian Eriksen in the side with his ability to play through the middle or even out wide. Mount will also bring energy and a deadly right foot from dead ball situations as Ten Hag's side look to improve on their third-place finish in the Premier League last season. The English midfielder spent his entire career at Chelsea, only spending two seasons on loan the 24-year-old could replace Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up The player spent his entire career on the books at Chelsea, spending time away on loan to Derby in 2018-19 and Vitesse Arnheim in 2017-18, and won the Premier League, Champions League and Club World Cup with the Blues. Mount will become the latest in a string of big name stars to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, once his move is finalised. Mateo Kovacic has joined Manchester City for £25m, while N'Golo Kante, Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly have all made the switch to the Saudi Pro League, joining Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli and Al-Hilal respectively. Kai Havertz has also departed, signing for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal for £65m, as the clear out in west London continues apace as Mauricio Pochettino takes charge of the club.

The Argentine forward turned 19 on Saturday and the youngster appeared to be enjoying himself in images that have been shared on social media. There was one particular photo that caught the eye of football fans though, as he posed with an Argentina themed football cake. Holding the cake in front of the youngster, was what some on social media dubbed as 'Mini Messi and Ronaldo'. The pair were dressed in Argentina and Portugal kits respectively, though the 'Mini Messi' had other fans suggesting he was actually at the party dressed as Garnacho's club and country team mate Lisandro Martinez. Alejandro Garnacho was pictured with a 'Mini Messi and Ronaldo' as he celebrated his 19th birthday United fans believe that Garnacho is hinting towards becoming the club's new No 7 The No 7 has been left without an owner since Cristiano Ronaldo's tumultuous exit last year United fans though spotted another feature from the photo which they believe is hinting at what shirt number he will wear next season. Garnacho, who wore the No 49 last season, had the No 19 at the top of his cake to mark his birthday, but it also had the No 7 on it. The youngster also hit seven million followers on Instagram on Sunday, marking the occasion with a photo which shows the No 7 on his back. The shirt number has remained vacant since Cristiano Ronaldo's tumultuous exit from the club last year. Garnacho wouldn't be the only player eyeing up the No 7 shirt, with Jadon Sancho - who donned the number for Borussia Dortmund previously - another player who could replace Ronaldo. Fans on social media though responded to Garnacho's photo suggesting that it was 'inevitable' that he gets the No 7. One person tweeted: 'It's obvious he is the new number 7. He can't even hide it.' Lee Chisholm commented: 'If he’s not no.7 why is he shouting about it so much?' Garnacho also posted this picture on his Instagram stories where he is seen with the No 7 on his back as he celebrated having seven million followers on the social media platform Garnacho enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season for the Reds Devils in the most recent campaign. He made 34 appearances across all competitions and netted five goals. The youngster will be hoping to take his game to another level, when United get their season underway next month.

The new wife of the 30-year-old Crystal Palace legend posted black and white pictures from the wedding on Instagram, including photos of them cutting the cake, together outside the venue and during the celebrations. In attendance was said to be a host of former team mates as well as Zaha's new partner at Croydon Athletic, Stormzy . It is a huge summer in more ways than one for Zaha, who is currently a free agent after leaving Crystal Palace on a free. Across two spells with the Eagles, the Ivory Coast international made 458 appearances for the club, scoring 90 goals. Former Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha has married long term partner Paige Bannister His wife posted a series of black and white photographs from the wedding ceremony online Among the guests in attendance was rapper Stormzy, who is set to partner with Zaha as co-owners of ninth-tier side Croydon Athletic Despite uncertainty over where his future lies, Zaha has cut a relaxed figure this summer. Last month, he was pictured on a stag do with five friends, with each member of the party wearing custom t-shirts each labelled with 'Wilf's Stag'. Meanwhile, the former Manchester United man had to wear a beige top with the words 'game over' etched into it while also showing a groom with a ball and chain tied to his leg and a bride turned away. It was then reported last week that Zaha and Stormzy have teamed up to buy their childhood ninth-tier football team in Croydon - and plan to use their cash on an 'exciting' journey for the club. Subject to FA and league approval, the prospective new owners will operate and develop the team as part of a project that will see them return to their roots. A third member of the consortium, Danny Young, acted as the kit manager and head of player care at Palace before stepping down at the end of the season. Announcing the deal, AFC Croydon said: 'A three person consortium comprised of Wilfried Zaha, Stormzy and Danny Young has exchanged contracts with the existing ownership of AFC Croydon Athletic to acquire the assets of the club. 'The consortium will own, operate and develop their childhood hometown football club. Zaha's future remains uncertain after leaving Crystal Palace following the end of his contract 'Whilst completion is subject to legislative and governance procedures, the three consortium members are excited about developing a community asset in the borough that gave them their own opportunities. 'They hope to take the entire community on this exciting journey with them.' In terms of his playing career, Mail Sport reported last week that the Saudi Pro League are once again trying to tempt him. Zaha has a number of offers on the table, including one from the Eagles worth £200,000 a week plus a hefty signing on fee. Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lazio have all made a pitch to the Ivory Coast international while he initially rejected a proposal from Al-Nassr.

The 20-year-old is aware of the list of stars that have pulled on the famous white shirt over the years, previously citing Zinedine Zidane as a role model, but is targeting a long and successful career of his own. “That is the motivation for the move in the first place, I want to be at a club that is going to be competing for titles and I want to try and help the team and club be as brilliant as it has been for all of time really,” he told the PA news agency. “Now is my chance to be part of that history and that goes hand in hand because I know the club wants to win and I want to win so hopefully it will happen. “It grabs you on its own, the size of the club is already surreal when you think about it, but when you add into that the project they have got in place, it was really important I made this step because it is just the place to be for me.” For most, the prospect of joining Real Madrid in a big-money move at such a young age would be daunting, but Bellingham’s journey has stood him in good stead. Hola Madridistas!🤍It is the proudest day of my life to join the greatest club in the history of the game. I will give absolutely everything I have to help this team win. Thank you for the amazing welcome. HALA MADRID!!!🤍🤍🤍 — Jude Bellingham (@BellinghamJude) Having made his debut for Birmingham as a 16-year-old and then joining Dortmund one year later, he has done things differently. And that means the price tag certainly will not weigh heavy on him. “I have had a very different experience to most young players, especially young English players,” he said. “My journey has taken me to three different countries, without playing in the Premier League, so it is very different. “I am always reminded of it when I am away with the national team and see the journeys of the other players. “But it is something I am really proud of, the risks I have taken and long may it continue. I just try and take everything in my stride really. “Pressure has followed me everywhere to this point. I was 15 and 16 when I started playing with the first team at Birmingham and felt that like a pressure that could be matched by no other really, so at each stage of my life the pressure has increased. “Until now I have always proved I can handle it and if I was worried about it I probably wouldn’t have made the move. “Because I know I have the right people around me to support me through it I think it is a great fit.” Bellingham may now be one of the most recognisable names in the game, but it was not too long ago that he was playing on the parks of Stourbridge as a child. He is now an ambassador for McDonald’s Fun Football programme, the largest grassroots programme in the UK for 5-11 year olds, where 250,000 children have had access to free football in the last 12 months. We could tell you why is so special – or, we could ask our newest ambassador to do it for us 😆 Have a look at why he decided to join the family ⬇️ — McDonald’s Fun Football (@FunFootballUK) Bellingham added: “This is massively important, you look around and see the environment that McDonald’s has created, all these girls and boys, whatever ages, just coming together and playing football without pressure and with loads of smiles. It’s a great initiative and to celebrate 250,000 kids being given the opportunity to play football this season is just brilliant. We’ve had a great day. “I remember my mum and dad taking me to stuff like this all the time, where it is just about enjoyment. “These are the kind of days that properly get you into the game, I am not looking around thinking, ‘I wonder who is going to be the next superstar’ but you never know how it affects the mindset of one of these kids, in terms of chasing the dream of being a footballer.” ::Jude Bellingham was speaking at the largest ever McDonald’s Fun Football session to celebrate the landmark of over 250,000 children across the UK benefiting from access to free football this season.

Mohamed Toubache-Ter a laissé entendre que l’ailier droit du Stade Rennais, Benjamin Bourigeaud, allait prolonger son contrat avec le club Rouge et Noir. « Annonce imminente du côté des Bourigeaud », a fait savoir l’insider sur Twitter avant de préciser dans son tweet et en commentaire qu’il s’agissait d’une bonne nouvelle pour les Rennais. En septembre dernier, l’ancien Lensois avait déjà prolongé son contrat jusqu’en juin 2026 avec Rennes. OGC Nice : la première recrue estivale connue ? Alors qu’ils très pourraient prochainement formuler une offre de 5 millions d’euros à leurs homologues du FC Nantes pour recruter Moses Simon , les dirigeants de l’OGC Nice seraient tout proches de boucler l’arrivée du latéral droit de Twente, Joshua Brenet, puisque ça chaufferait pour son arrivée au Gym, toujours d’après Mohamed Toubache-Ter. RC Strasbourg : après Bakwa, le RCSA contrarie le RC Lens avec Koita Alors que le RC Strasbourg a officialisé ce dimanche soir la nomination de Patrick Vieira comme nouvel entraîneur , le club alsacien avancerait bien pour la signature de l'attaquant du RB Salzbourg, Sekou Koita, d'après L'Équipe. Après l'ailier gauche des Girondins de Bordeaux, Dilane Bakwa , c'est donc une deuxième cible que se batailleraient le RCSA et le RC Lens sur le marché des transferts cet été. Mais aussi... LOSC : coup dur pour Diakité Touché à l'épaule depuis ce samedi, le latéral droit du LOSC, Bafodé Diakité, a été contraint de déclarer forfait avec les Bleuets pour le quart de finale de l'Euro Espoirs 2023 contre l'Ukraine. Montpellier : un gardien en approche ! Si l'on en croit les informations du média bosnien Faktor, Montpellier, en quête d'un portier cet été pour combler les départs de Matis Carvalho et de Bingourou Kamara, serait proche de signer le gardien bosnien du FK Sarajevo, Belmin Dizdarevic. Lorient : un Camerounais va signer, Soumano a la cote Alors qu'ils poussent pour recruter définitivement Romain Faivre, prêté sans option d’achat lors de la deuxième partie de saison par l'OL, les dirigeants de Lorient devraient bientôt enregistrer l’arrivée du jeune milieu de terrain camerounais, Arthur Avom Ebong, selon les informations de Ouest-France. Le quotidien régional ajoute que plusieurs écuries de Ligue 2 ont manifesté un intérêt concret pour le jeune buteur Sambou Soumano : Rodez, Grenoble, Quevilly Rouen Métropole et l’US Concarneau, fraîchement promue dans l’antichambre de l’élite. Le FCL serait favorable à lui donner encore du temps de jeu à l’étage inférieur la saison prochaine. Régis Le Bris, lui, est absent à la reprise de l'entraînement ce jour ! Et enfin... RC Strasbourg : Vieira n’arrive pas seul Officialisé hier soir par le RC Strasbourg, Patrick Vieira sera présent au centre d’entraînement avec une partie d’un staff qui doit encore être complété. À son côté, son adjoint historique Kristian Wilson, qui le secondait déjà lors de sa première expérience sur un banc, au New York City FC (2016-2018) avant de le suivre à Nice et à Crystal Palace. D’après L’Équipe, deux arrivées supplémentaires sont attendues, dont celle d’un autre adjoint, pour venir travailler de concert avec les « historiques », le médecin Jean-Marc Kuentz, le coach des gardiens Stéphane Cassard et le préparateur physique Guillaume Jahier. « Aujourd’hui, un nouveau cycle commence pour le Racing et c’est excitant pour un entraîneur de pouvoir construire quelque chose tout en s’appuyant sur les valeurs qui font la force d’un club », a déclaré Vieira, qui sera présenté à la presse dans la journée. AS Monaco : Pléa valide l’arrivée d’Hütter Prochain entraîneur de l’AS Monaco, Adi Hütter reste peu connu en France. Alassane Pléa, qui l’a côtoyé du côté du Borussia Mönchengladbach, en dit plus sur son profil et ses intention de jeu. « C’est quelqu’un de très bien, de très cool avec ses joueurs. Il provoque toujours la discussion, il aime savoir ce qu’on ressent et ce qu’on veut, il parlait beaucoup avec nous durant les séances vidéo, explique l’attaquant international à L’Équipe. Il veut des milieux agressifs à la perte du ballon, avec une grande qualité de passe pour ouvrir sur les pistons. Il nous laissait beaucoup de liberté devant mais il voulait qu’on presse à la perte du ballon. Les séances étaient intenses et ludiques. Adi est un très bon coach et un bon gars, j’ai regretté son départ. » LOSC : David encore courtisé, Ngonge dans le viseur ? Alors que deux nouveaux prétendants sont arrivés pour Jonathn David (Juve en cas de départ de Vlahovic et West Ham), Ignazio Genuardi nous apprend que le LOSC serait sur Cyrile Ngonge. Âgé de 23 ans, l'ailier belge évolue à l'Hellas Vérone et a une valeur marchande de 2 millions d'euros. Auteur de cinq buts cette saison en Serie A, l'intéressé est courtisé par plusieurs clubs européens. Girondins de Bordeaux : Elis blessé de longue durée ? Comme craint après son match avec la sélection, Alberth Elis s’est fracturé le bras. Selon Girondinfos, l’attaquant des Girondins de Bordeaux a été opéré et sera indisponible entre 6 à 8 semaines !

Having signed his contract to take over the reigns at Stamford Bridge over a month ago, the former Tottenham manager will officially get to work this week as he tries to transform the club's fortunes after a poor campaign last year. In a video shared on social media captioned 'this is where it starts', Pochettino is seen arriving at the club as he gets out the back of a grey van. He hugs various members of staff and greets others before walking into the building at Cobham to start work. Pre-season gets underway for Chelsea this week in London before a trip to the US for more preparation for the new season, which starts on the weekend of August 13. Mauricio Pochettino has arrived at Chelsea to start work as the club's new manager The former Tottenham manager greeted staff in a social media video before stepping inside The club is looking to rebuild after a rocky first year under new owner Todd Boehly This is where it starts.  #WelcomePoch pic.twitter.com/scmF0ThuON — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 3, 2023 Despite the wealth of talent at Pochettino's disposal, it won't be plain sailing for the 51-year old with plenty still to change at the club before the new season gets underway. Having already offloaded several major stars such as N'Golo Kante and Kai Havertz, eight players are still set to leave the club before the new campaign. The club is still rebuilding off the field, too, having endured a difficult opening year to Todd Boehly's reign after taking over from Roman Abramovic. He entered the building at Cobham in what is the club's first day of pre-season Mason Mount is on the verge of completing a move to Premier League rivals Manchester United New players will arrive too, but the squad will change a lot in a bid to bounce back from the 12th-place Premier League finish last season. Homegrown star Mason Mount is on the verge of completing his move to Manchester United , having arrived at the club on Monday despite Pochettino's wishes to work with the midfielder. The likes of Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic may also move on, though the former failed a medical at Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr last week, putting his expected exit in doubt. Pochettino however will be eager to get to work on a testing project, and will have plenty to sort if he is going to help the club get somewhere close to where they once were as a team.

The 25-year-old, who doesn't have any Premier League experience, is set to find himself coming up against the likes of Harry Kane and Erling Haaland next season. Luton also recently secured the signing of former Rotherham winger Chiedozie Ogbene. Rob Edwards' side are looking to strengthen their squad so that they can compete in the Premier League. Luton manager Rob Edwards praised the new signing's determination following his arrival As confirmed on their official website , The Hatters have secured the signing of Mads Andersen from Barnsley for an undisclosed fee. Andersen has been at Barnsley for four years and, although he played in League One last campaign, the Danish centre-back spent the previous three seasons in the Championship. After starting out at Brondby, for whom he made one senior appearance, Andersen had a loan spell at Koge before making the switch to Horsens. Last season Andersen came close to earning promotion to the Championship with Barnsley but they suffered late frustration against Sheffield Wednesday in the League One play-off final. Luton Town have signed defender Mads Andersen following their promotion to the top flight After finalising his move to Luton, Andersen, who was captain at Barnsley, reflected upon achieving his dream of becoming a Premier League player. He said: 'It feels very, very good. I'm very happy and I'm really looking forward to this next chapter of my life at Luton Town. 'I'm so excited. It's a dream come true. When I made my move in Denmark from Brondby to a lower team in the same division, me and my dad spoke about it and I said 'In one and a half years, I'm going to go to the Championship', and that is exactly what happened. 'During that period I also wrote on a piece of paper, 'Premier League', and stuck it on the fridge. I completely forgot about it, until my family told me, 'You put that on the fridge!'. So it's a proud moment for them as well.' Luton manager Edwards says that Andersen will bring 'quality and competition' to the squad. Andersen is Luton's second major signing this summer after the arrival of Chiedozie Ogbene Edwards said: 'I'm really pleased to get Mads on board. He has been on our recruitment team's list for a long time now. We watched a lot of him last season and he's performed really well and consistently for a prolonged period in English football. 'He's someone who can play anywhere across that back three for us. He's a real good defender, someone who loves defending, and we like ours to be able to do that. But he can play, and there is room to grow, like with anyone we want to bring in and sign. 'He's going to bring real good quality and competition into that position, with us obviously losing Sonny Bradley this summer, but the position we see Amari'i Bell in now, Mads' arrival gives us real quality and competition in that area.' Edwards spoke highly about Andersen's determination being a key quality. He said: 'He's a really good person, when I spoke to him, it was clear that he's so ambitious to play in the Premier League and very driven and determined to get into his national team, but first and foremost, he's determined to get into our team, to play and be consistent. 'We've got high hopes for Mads and are really pleased to get the deal done.'

The England midfielder appeared at United's Carrington training facility with the Red Devils at last set to secure the Chelsea star's services. Erik ten Hag 's side were rebuffed several times in their approach for Mount this summer, but at last had a fee agreed at the fifth time of asking. The player and a few members of his entourage were spotted arriving at the facility in a Mercedes early on Monday morning, entering through the back gate. With an initial £55m figure, followed by £5m in add-ons, at last agreed between the rivals after weeks of negotiations and rejected advances, the player is due at United for a medical ahead of finalising terms on a move. A Mercedes van was spotted entering Carrington with Mason Mount on board on Monday Mount is set to undergo a medical ahead of finalising his move to Man United from Chelsea Erik ten Hag's side had numerous bids turned down before at last having a figure agreed The 24-year-old is believed to be set to put pen to paper over terms at Old Trafford, signing a five-contract worth £250,000-a-week with the option of another year. And he appears set to arrive at the perfect time for Ten Hag and Co, who are due to begin their pre-season training in earnest with a friendly against rivals Leeds next week. As such, Mount could make his debut for his new club, although he will be some way from the theatre of dreams, with the game in fact taking place in Oslo, Norway. The English star arrives at Unite don the back of a trying 2022-23 season with Chelsea, in which he struggled for both form and fitness. He made just 35 appearances in all competitions for the Blues, scoring three times and providing six assists as Chelsea fell short of expectations. In total he missed 13 games of the campaign as he struggled to overcome a pelvic issue that ruled him out of the end of the season under Frank Lampard. But despite his underwhelming displays last term, United were keen to land their target, and he looks set to replace Christian Eriksen in the side with his ability to play through the middle or even out wide. Mount will also bring energy and a deadly right foot from dead ball situations as Ten Hag's side look to improve on their third-place finish in the Premier League last season. The English midfielder spent his entire career at Chelsea, only spending two seasons on loan the 24-year-old could replace Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up The player spent his entire career on the books at Chelsea, spending time away on loan to Derby in 2018-19 and Vitesse Arnheim in 2017-18, and won the Premier League, Champions League and Club World Cup with the Blues. Mount will become the latest in a string of big name stars to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, once his move is finalised. Mateo Kovacic has joined Manchester City for £25m, while N'Golo Kante, Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly have all made the switch to the Saudi Pro League, joining Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli and Al-Hilal respectively. Kai Havertz has also departed, signing for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal for £65m, as the clear out in west London continues apace as Mauricio Pochettino takes charge of the club.

The Argentine forward turned 19 on Saturday and the youngster appeared to be enjoying himself in images that have been shared on social media. There was one particular photo that caught the eye of football fans though, as he posed with an Argentina themed football cake. Holding the cake in front of the youngster, was what some on social media dubbed as 'Mini Messi and Ronaldo'. The pair were dressed in Argentina and Portugal kits respectively, though the 'Mini Messi' had other fans suggesting he was actually at the party dressed as Garnacho's club and country team mate Lisandro Martinez. Alejandro Garnacho was pictured with a 'Mini Messi and Ronaldo' as he celebrated his 19th birthday United fans believe that Garnacho is hinting towards becoming the club's new No 7 The No 7 has been left without an owner since Cristiano Ronaldo's tumultuous exit last year United fans though spotted another feature from the photo which they believe is hinting at what shirt number he will wear next season. Garnacho, who wore the No 49 last season, had the No 19 at the top of his cake to mark his birthday, but it also had the No 7 on it. The youngster also hit seven million followers on Instagram on Sunday, marking the occasion with a photo which shows the No 7 on his back. The shirt number has remained vacant since Cristiano Ronaldo's tumultuous exit from the club last year. Garnacho wouldn't be the only player eyeing up the No 7 shirt, with Jadon Sancho - who donned the number for Borussia Dortmund previously - another player who could replace Ronaldo. Fans on social media though responded to Garnacho's photo suggesting that it was 'inevitable' that he gets the No 7. One person tweeted: 'It's obvious he is the new number 7. He can't even hide it.' Lee Chisholm commented: 'If he’s not no.7 why is he shouting about it so much?' Garnacho also posted this picture on his Instagram stories where he is seen with the No 7 on his back as he celebrated having seven million followers on the social media platform Garnacho enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season for the Reds Devils in the most recent campaign. He made 34 appearances across all competitions and netted five goals. The youngster will be hoping to take his game to another level, when United get their season underway next month.

The new wife of the 30-year-old Crystal Palace legend posted black and white pictures from the wedding on Instagram, including photos of them cutting the cake, together outside the venue and during the celebrations. In attendance was said to be a host of former team mates as well as Zaha's new partner at Croydon Athletic, Stormzy . It is a huge summer in more ways than one for Zaha, who is currently a free agent after leaving Crystal Palace on a free. Across two spells with the Eagles, the Ivory Coast international made 458 appearances for the club, scoring 90 goals. Former Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha has married long term partner Paige Bannister His wife posted a series of black and white photographs from the wedding ceremony online Among the guests in attendance was rapper Stormzy, who is set to partner with Zaha as co-owners of ninth-tier side Croydon Athletic Despite uncertainty over where his future lies, Zaha has cut a relaxed figure this summer. Last month, he was pictured on a stag do with five friends, with each member of the party wearing custom t-shirts each labelled with 'Wilf's Stag'. Meanwhile, the former Manchester United man had to wear a beige top with the words 'game over' etched into it while also showing a groom with a ball and chain tied to his leg and a bride turned away. It was then reported last week that Zaha and Stormzy have teamed up to buy their childhood ninth-tier football team in Croydon - and plan to use their cash on an 'exciting' journey for the club. Subject to FA and league approval, the prospective new owners will operate and develop the team as part of a project that will see them return to their roots. A third member of the consortium, Danny Young, acted as the kit manager and head of player care at Palace before stepping down at the end of the season. Announcing the deal, AFC Croydon said: 'A three person consortium comprised of Wilfried Zaha, Stormzy and Danny Young has exchanged contracts with the existing ownership of AFC Croydon Athletic to acquire the assets of the club. 'The consortium will own, operate and develop their childhood hometown football club. Zaha's future remains uncertain after leaving Crystal Palace following the end of his contract 'Whilst completion is subject to legislative and governance procedures, the three consortium members are excited about developing a community asset in the borough that gave them their own opportunities. 'They hope to take the entire community on this exciting journey with them.' In terms of his playing career, Mail Sport reported last week that the Saudi Pro League are once again trying to tempt him. Zaha has a number of offers on the table, including one from the Eagles worth £200,000 a week plus a hefty signing on fee.

The 20-year-old is aware of the list of stars that have pulled on the famous white shirt over the years, previously citing Zinedine Zidane as a role model, but is targeting a long and successful career of his own. “That is the motivation for the move in the first place, I want to be at a club that is going to be competing for titles and I want to try and help the team and club be as brilliant as it has been for all of time really,” he told the PA news agency. “Now is my chance to be part of that history and that goes hand in hand because I know the club wants to win and I want to win so hopefully it will happen. “It grabs you on its own, the size of the club is already surreal when you think about it, but when you add into that the project they have got in place, it was really important I made this step because it is just the place to be for me.” For most, the prospect of joining Real Madrid in a big-money move at such a young age would be daunting, but Bellingham’s journey has stood him in good stead. Hola Madridistas!🤍It is the proudest day of my life to join the greatest club in the history of the game. I will give absolutely everything I have to help this team win. Thank you for the amazing welcome. HALA MADRID!!!🤍🤍🤍 — Jude Bellingham (@BellinghamJude) Having made his debut for Birmingham as a 16-year-old and then joining Dortmund one year later, he has done things differently. And that means the price tag certainly will not weigh heavy on him. “I have had a very different experience to most young players, especially young English players,” he said. “My journey has taken me to three different countries, without playing in the Premier League, so it is very different. “I am always reminded of it when I am away with the national team and see the journeys of the other players. “But it is something I am really proud of, the risks I have taken and long may it continue. I just try and take everything in my stride really. “Pressure has followed me everywhere to this point. I was 15 and 16 when I started playing with the first team at Birmingham and felt that like a pressure that could be matched by no other really, so at each stage of my life the pressure has increased. “Until now I have always proved I can handle it and if I was worried about it I probably wouldn’t have made the move. “Because I know I have the right people around me to support me through it I think it is a great fit.” Bellingham may now be one of the most recognisable names in the game, but it was not too long ago that he was playing on the parks of Stourbridge as a child. He is now an ambassador for McDonald’s Fun Football programme, the largest grassroots programme in the UK for 5-11 year olds, where 250,000 children have had access to free football in the last 12 months. We could tell you why is so special – or, we could ask our newest ambassador to do it for us 😆 Have a look at why he decided to join the family ⬇️ — McDonald’s Fun Football (@FunFootballUK) Bellingham added: “This is massively important, you look around and see the environment that McDonald’s has created, all these girls and boys, whatever ages, just coming together and playing football without pressure and with loads of smiles. It’s a great initiative and to celebrate 250,000 kids being given the opportunity to play football this season is just brilliant. We’ve had a great day. “I remember my mum and dad taking me to stuff like this all the time, where it is just about enjoyment. “These are the kind of days that properly get you into the game, I am not looking around thinking, ‘I wonder who is going to be the next superstar’ but you never know how it affects the mindset of one of these kids, in terms of chasing the dream of being a footballer.” ::Jude Bellingham was speaking at the largest ever McDonald’s Fun Football session to celebrate the landmark of over 250,000 children across the UK benefiting from access to free football this season.

Mohamed Toubache-Ter a laissé entendre que l’ailier droit du Stade Rennais, Benjamin Bourigeaud, allait prolonger son contrat avec le club Rouge et Noir. « Annonce imminente du côté des Bourigeaud », a fait savoir l’insider sur Twitter avant de préciser dans son tweet et en commentaire qu’il s’agissait d’une bonne nouvelle pour les Rennais. En septembre dernier, l’ancien Lensois avait déjà prolongé son contrat jusqu’en juin 2026 avec Rennes. OGC Nice : la première recrue estivale connue ? Alors qu’ils très pourraient prochainement formuler une offre de 5 millions d’euros à leurs homologues du FC Nantes pour recruter Moses Simon , les dirigeants de l’OGC Nice seraient tout proches de boucler l’arrivée du latéral droit de Twente, Joshua Brenet, puisque ça chaufferait pour son arrivée au Gym, toujours d’après Mohamed Toubache-Ter. RC Strasbourg : après Bakwa, le RCSA contrarie le RC Lens avec Koita Alors que le RC Strasbourg a officialisé ce dimanche soir la nomination de Patrick Vieira comme nouvel entraîneur , le club alsacien avancerait bien pour la signature de l'attaquant du RB Salzbourg, Sekou Koita, d'après L'Équipe. Après l'ailier gauche des Girondins de Bordeaux, Dilane Bakwa , c'est donc une deuxième cible que se batailleraient le RCSA et le RC Lens sur le marché des transferts cet été. Mais aussi... LOSC : coup dur pour Diakité Touché à l'épaule depuis ce samedi, le latéral droit du LOSC, Bafodé Diakité, a été contraint de déclarer forfait avec les Bleuets pour le quart de finale de l'Euro Espoirs 2023 contre l'Ukraine. Montpellier : un gardien en approche ! Si l'on en croit les informations du média bosnien Faktor, Montpellier, en quête d'un portier cet été pour combler les départs de Matis Carvalho et de Bingourou Kamara, serait proche de signer le gardien bosnien du FK Sarajevo, Belmin Dizdarevic. Lorient : un Camerounais va signer, Soumano a la cote Alors qu'ils poussent pour recruter définitivement Romain Faivre, prêté sans option d’achat lors de la deuxième partie de saison par l'OL, les dirigeants de Lorient devraient bientôt enregistrer l’arrivée du jeune milieu de terrain camerounais, Arthur Avom Ebong, selon les informations de Ouest-France. Le quotidien régional ajoute que plusieurs écuries de Ligue 2 ont manifesté un intérêt concret pour le jeune buteur Sambou Soumano : Rodez, Grenoble, Quevilly Rouen Métropole et l’US Concarneau, fraîchement promue dans l’antichambre de l’élite. Le FCL serait favorable à lui donner encore du temps de jeu à l’étage inférieur la saison prochaine. Régis Le Bris, lui, est absent à la reprise de l'entraînement ce jour ! Et enfin... RC Strasbourg : Vieira n’arrive pas seul Officialisé hier soir par le RC Strasbourg, Patrick Vieira sera présent au centre d’entraînement avec une partie d’un staff qui doit encore être complété. À son côté, son adjoint historique Kristian Wilson, qui le secondait déjà lors de sa première expérience sur un banc, au New York City FC (2016-2018) avant de le suivre à Nice et à Crystal Palace. D’après L’Équipe, deux arrivées supplémentaires sont attendues, dont celle d’un autre adjoint, pour venir travailler de concert avec les « historiques », le médecin Jean-Marc Kuentz, le coach des gardiens Stéphane Cassard et le préparateur physique Guillaume Jahier. « Aujourd’hui, un nouveau cycle commence pour le Racing et c’est excitant pour un entraîneur de pouvoir construire quelque chose tout en s’appuyant sur les valeurs qui font la force d’un club », a déclaré Vieira, qui sera présenté à la presse dans la journée. AS Monaco : Pléa valide l’arrivée d’Hütter Prochain entraîneur de l’AS Monaco, Adi Hütter reste peu connu en France. Alassane Pléa, qui l’a côtoyé du côté du Borussia Mönchengladbach, en dit plus sur son profil et ses intention de jeu. « C’est quelqu’un de très bien, de très cool avec ses joueurs. Il provoque toujours la discussion, il aime savoir ce qu’on ressent et ce qu’on veut, il parlait beaucoup avec nous durant les séances vidéo, explique l’attaquant international à L’Équipe. Il veut des milieux agressifs à la perte du ballon, avec une grande qualité de passe pour ouvrir sur les pistons. Il nous laissait beaucoup de liberté devant mais il voulait qu’on presse à la perte du ballon. Les séances étaient intenses et ludiques. Adi est un très bon coach et un bon gars, j’ai regretté son départ. » LOSC : David encore courtisé, Ngonge dans le viseur ? Alors que deux nouveaux prétendants sont arrivés pour Jonathn David (Juve en cas de départ de Vlahovic et West Ham), Ignazio Genuardi nous apprend que le LOSC serait sur Cyrile Ngonge. Âgé de 23 ans, l'ailier belge évolue à l'Hellas Vérone et a une valeur marchande de 2 millions d'euros. Auteur de cinq buts cette saison en Serie A, l'intéressé est courtisé par plusieurs clubs européens. Girondins de Bordeaux : Elis blessé de longue durée ? Comme craint après son match avec la sélection, Alberth Elis s’est fracturé le bras. Selon Girondinfos, l’attaquant des Girondins de Bordeaux a été opéré et sera indisponible entre 6 à 8 semaines !

Having signed his contract to take over the reigns at Stamford Bridge over a month ago, the former Tottenham manager will officially get to work this week as he tries to transform the club's fortunes after a poor campaign last year. In a video shared on social media captioned 'this is where it starts', Pochettino is seen arriving at the club as he gets out the back of a grey van. He hugs various members of staff and greets others before walking into the building at Cobham to start work. Pre-season gets underway for Chelsea this week in London before a trip to the US for more preparation for the new season, which starts on the weekend of August 13. Mauricio Pochettino has arrived at Chelsea to start work as the club's new manager The former Tottenham manager greeted staff in a social media video before stepping inside The club is looking to rebuild after a rocky first year under new owner Todd Boehly This is where it starts.  #WelcomePoch pic.twitter.com/scmF0ThuON — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 3, 2023 Despite the wealth of talent at Pochettino's disposal, it won't be plain sailing for the 51-year old with plenty still to change at the club before the new season gets underway. Having already offloaded several major stars such as N'Golo Kante and Kai Havertz, eight players are still set to leave the club before the new campaign. The club is still rebuilding off the field, too, having endured a difficult opening year to Todd Boehly's reign after taking over from Roman Abramovic. He entered the building at Cobham in what is the club's first day of pre-season Mason Mount is on the verge of completing a move to Premier League rivals Manchester United New players will arrive too, but the squad will change a lot in a bid to bounce back from the 12th-place Premier League finish last season. Homegrown star Mason Mount is on the verge of completing his move to Manchester United , having arrived at the club on Monday despite Pochettino's wishes to work with the midfielder. The likes of Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic may also move on, though the former failed a medical at Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr last week, putting his expected exit in doubt. Pochettino however will be eager to get to work on a testing project, and will have plenty to sort if he is going to help the club get somewhere close to where they once were as a team.

The 25-year-old, who doesn't have any Premier League experience, is set to find himself coming up against the likes of Harry Kane and Erling Haaland next season. Luton also recently secured the signing of former Rotherham winger Chiedozie Ogbene. Rob Edwards' side are looking to strengthen their squad so that they can compete in the Premier League. Luton manager Rob Edwards praised the new signing's determination following his arrival As confirmed on their official website , The Hatters have secured the signing of Mads Andersen from Barnsley for an undisclosed fee. Andersen has been at Barnsley for four years and, although he played in League One last campaign, the Danish centre-back spent the previous three seasons in the Championship. After starting out at Brondby, for whom he made one senior appearance, Andersen had a loan spell at Koge before making the switch to Horsens. Last season Andersen came close to earning promotion to the Championship with Barnsley but they suffered late frustration against Sheffield Wednesday in the League One play-off final. Luton Town have signed defender Mads Andersen following their promotion to the top flight After finalising his move to Luton, Andersen, who was captain at Barnsley, reflected upon achieving his dream of becoming a Premier League player. He said: 'It feels very, very good. I'm very happy and I'm really looking forward to this next chapter of my life at Luton Town. 'I'm so excited. It's a dream come true. When I made my move in Denmark from Brondby to a lower team in the same division, me and my dad spoke about it and I said 'In one and a half years, I'm going to go to the Championship', and that is exactly what happened. 'During that period I also wrote on a piece of paper, 'Premier League', and stuck it on the fridge. I completely forgot about it, until my family told me, 'You put that on the fridge!'. So it's a proud moment for them as well.' Luton manager Edwards says that Andersen will bring 'quality and competition' to the squad. Andersen is Luton's second major signing this summer after the arrival of Chiedozie Ogbene Edwards said: 'I'm really pleased to get Mads on board. He has been on our recruitment team's list for a long time now. We watched a lot of him last season and he's performed really well and consistently for a prolonged period in English football. 'He's someone who can play anywhere across that back three for us. He's a real good defender, someone who loves defending, and we like ours to be able to do that. But he can play, and there is room to grow, like with anyone we want to bring in and sign. 'He's going to bring real good quality and competition into that position, with us obviously losing Sonny Bradley this summer, but the position we see Amari'i Bell in now, Mads' arrival gives us real quality and competition in that area.' Edwards spoke highly about Andersen's determination being a key quality. He said: 'He's a really good person, when I spoke to him, it was clear that he's so ambitious to play in the Premier League and very driven and determined to get into his national team, but first and foremost, he's determined to get into our team, to play and be consistent. 'We've got high hopes for Mads and are really pleased to get the deal done.'

The England midfielder appeared at United's Carrington training facility with the Red Devils at last set to secure the Chelsea star's services. Erik ten Hag 's side were rebuffed several times in their approach for Mount this summer, but at last had a fee agreed at the fifth time of asking. The player and a few members of his entourage were spotted arriving at the facility in a Mercedes early on Monday morning, entering through the back gate. With an initial £55m figure, followed by £5m in add-ons, at last agreed between the rivals after weeks of negotiations and rejected advances, the player is due at United for a medical ahead of finalising terms on a move. A Mercedes van was spotted entering Carrington with Mason Mount on board on Monday Mount is set to undergo a medical ahead of finalising his move to Man United from Chelsea Erik ten Hag's side had numerous bids turned down before at last having a figure agreed The 24-year-old is believed to be set to put pen to paper over terms at Old Trafford, signing a five-contract worth £250,000-a-week with the option of another year. And he appears set to arrive at the perfect time for Ten Hag and Co, who are due to begin their pre-season training in earnest with a friendly against rivals Leeds next week. As such, Mount could make his debut for his new club, although he will be some way from the theatre of dreams, with the game in fact taking place in Oslo, Norway. The English star arrives at Unite don the back of a trying 2022-23 season with Chelsea, in which he struggled for both form and fitness. He made just 35 appearances in all competitions for the Blues, scoring three times and providing six assists as Chelsea fell short of expectations. In total he missed 13 games of the campaign as he struggled to overcome a pelvic issue that ruled him out of the end of the season under Frank Lampard. But despite his underwhelming displays last term, United were keen to land their target, and he looks set to replace Christian Eriksen in the side with his ability to play through the middle or even out wide. Mount will also bring energy and a deadly right foot from dead ball situations as Ten Hag's side look to improve on their third-place finish in the Premier League last season. The English midfielder spent his entire career at Chelsea, only spending two seasons on loan the 24-year-old could replace Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen in the starting line-up The player spent his entire career on the books at Chelsea, spending time away on loan to Derby in 2018-19 and Vitesse Arnheim in 2017-18, and won the Premier League, Champions League and Club World Cup with the Blues. Mount will become the latest in a string of big name stars to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, once his move is finalised. Mateo Kovacic has joined Manchester City for £25m, while N'Golo Kante, Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly have all made the switch to the Saudi Pro League, joining Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli and Al-Hilal respectively. Kai Havertz has also departed, signing for Mikel Arteta's Arsenal for £65m, as the clear out in west London continues apace as Mauricio Pochettino takes charge of the club.

The Argentine forward turned 19 on Saturday and the youngster appeared to be enjoying himself in images that have been shared on social media. There was one particular photo that caught the eye of football fans though, as he posed with an Argentina themed football cake. Holding the cake in front of the youngster, was what some on social media dubbed as 'Mini Messi and Ronaldo'. The pair were dressed in Argentina and Portugal kits respectively, though the 'Mini Messi' had other fans suggesting he was actually at the party dressed as Garnacho's club and country team mate Lisandro Martinez. Alejandro Garnacho was pictured with a 'Mini Messi and Ronaldo' as he celebrated his 19th birthday United fans believe that Garnacho is hinting towards becoming the club's new No 7 The No 7 has been left without an owner since Cristiano Ronaldo's tumultuous exit last year United fans though spotted another feature from the photo which they believe is hinting at what shirt number he will wear next season. Garnacho, who wore the No 49 last season, had the No 19 at the top of his cake to mark his birthday, but it also had the No 7 on it. The youngster also hit seven million followers on Instagram on Sunday, marking the occasion with a photo which shows the No 7 on his back. The shirt number has remained vacant since Cristiano Ronaldo's tumultuous exit from the club last year. Garnacho wouldn't be the only player eyeing up the No 7 shirt, with Jadon Sancho - who donned the number for Borussia Dortmund previously - another player who could replace Ronaldo. Fans on social media though responded to Garnacho's photo suggesting that it was 'inevitable' that he gets the No 7. One person tweeted: 'It's obvious he is the new number 7. He can't even hide it.' Lee Chisholm commented: 'If he’s not no.7 why is he shouting about it so much?' Garnacho also posted this picture on his Instagram stories where he is seen with the No 7 on his back as he celebrated having seven million followers on the social media platform Garnacho enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season for the Reds Devils in the most recent campaign. He made 34 appearances across all competitions and netted five goals. The youngster will be hoping to take his game to another level, when United get their season underway next month.
