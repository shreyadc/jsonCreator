As the two countries lined up and stood shoulder-to-shoulder for their national anthem at the Al Thumama Stadium in Doha before play started, fans were treated to a strange visual.FIFA World Cup: Fixtures | Results | Points Table | Squads | RecordsThe ‘La Furia Roja’ or ‘Red Fury’, as the Spanish football team is called, stood tall and swayed awkwardly without singing their national anthem. No, it wasn’t a form of protest — like the Iranians did in their match against England — but because the anthem, Marcha Real, has no words to it.Here is all you need to know about Spain’s national anthem and why the Spanish footballers don’t sing along.The Marcha RealThe Marcha Real is one of the few patriotic songs with no lyrics at all. With this, Spain enters the no-lyric national anthem club — joining only three other countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and San Marino.It has its origins in an 18th Century song known as the Marcha de Granaderos or March of the Grenadiers, which appeared for the first time in 1761, in a book of Military Marches of the Spanish Infantry written by Espinosa de los Monteros. The tune itself was a popular number among the Spanish people and it was eventually declared a March of Honor by Charles III in 1770.It was in 1874 during the reign of Isobel II that La Marcha Granadera (The Grenadier March) was adopted as the official Spanish national anthem for the first time.As time progressed, it became more popular and today’s version of the anthem — a sixteen-bar long phrase — was harmonised by Bartolomé Pérez Casas, head musician of the Royal Corps of Alabarderos Guards.There are six different official adaptations of the national anthem, for each arrangement and length. One is reserved for the King, the other is performed for the Government of Spain or sporting events such as FIFA World Cup and there are other arrangements for the military.Putting words to the songWhile the Marcha Real has no official lyrics, that’s not always been the case.Over the years, there have been a number of attempts to come up with words for the anthem. The first major attempt was in 1870, by General Juan Prim, the Spanish military leader and political figure who played an important role in the Revolution of 1868.At his prompting Spanish officials commissioned a contest for both musicians and poets to put lyrics to the hymn. However, the competition failed to produce a winner, with the judges failing to reach a consensus on any of the entries. The March of the Grenadiers was left without a set of lyrics.Later, another attempt was made during the reign of Alfonso XIII (1886-1931). A version created by Eduardo Marquina with three lyrics titled Flag of Spain, Spain Guiding, and Long live Spain! was used.During the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, the head of the Spanish government from 1939 to 1975, lyrics written by a poet, José María Pemán were employed. But once he was removed from power, the lyrics were taken out of the national anthem in 1978 because of their association with Franco and the extreme right-wing ideology that it reflected.In 2007, another attempt was made to add lyrics to the anthem. The Spanish Olympic Committee (COE) set up a competition to find a writer for a set of lyrics for the Spanish anthem. This time there was even a winner. Paulino Cubero, from Ciudad Real, was commissioned to write the text.The lyrics went something like this: “Long live Spain! Let’s all sing together with different voices and one heart. Long live Spain! From the green valleys to the immense sea, a hymn of brotherhood, Love the Homeland because it knows how to embrace, under its blue sky, all the peoples in freedom. Glory to the children who give justice and greatness to history, democracy and peace.”However, these lyrics were vociferously criticised and the words never came to life.Twitter erupts in angerInterestingly, this isn’t the first time that the matter of players not singing the anthem during the World Cup has been raised.When World Cup fever took over in the summer of 2018, a wildly amusing Twitterstorm broke out in the run-up to Spain’s game against Iran on 20 June. It seemed some netizens took offence at Spain’s players ‘refusing’ to sing along to the wordless anthem.#WorldCup Seriously can’t believe the Spain players, refusing to sing their national anthem for the second match in a row #ESP #IRNESP— Peter Wood (@gallowgate_pete) June 20, 2018So, keep an eye out for Spain’s next match, which is against Germany, and see the La Furia Roja humming to the anthem.With inputs from agenciesRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Rachit Kanaujia November 24th, 2022 11:48:29 IST India and New Zealand will play three ODIs. Image: Screenshot from BCCI video After clinching the T20 series in New Zealand, Team India now shift their focus on the three-match ODI series against the Kiwis starting Friday, which will also serve as an opportunity for the Men in Blue to test their bench strength ahead of the 2023 ODI World Cup, scheduled to take place in India. India will be well aware of the fact that over the past few years, every white-ball series has been viewed from the lens of the ICC global event that is next in line, and for the very same reason they will have to put their best foot forward when they take on Kane Williamson-led New Zealand in the ODI series. In the absence of senior players – Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and KL Rahul, who have been rested, the series will feature a lot of youngsters, who will be led by veteran opener Shikhar Dhawan, while wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant will be his deputy. pic.twitter.com/M7L6dxP46P — BCCI (@BCCI) November 23, 2022 Notably, Dhawan has led India to back-to-back series ODI series wins in West Indies and Zimbabwe and will look to continue the winning run. Chance for youngsters to put a strong case The absence of senior players means that some young guns have the opportunity to put a strong case ahead of the 2023 ODI World Cup and they will be eager to capitalise on every chance they get in the upcoming ODI series. Apart from the results, it will be about the process for youngsters, hence a lot will depend on how they approach and respond to in-game situations. High hopes from Shubman Gill In the batting department, all eyes will be on Shubman Gill, who won the ‘Player of the series’ award in the ODI series in Zimbabwe and West Indies earlier this year. It is no secret that Team India management is currently preparing Gill as an opener for the 2023 edition of the 50-over World Cup. The 23-year-old batter made his ODI debut back in 2019 during the New Zealand tour, but it was only earlier this year that he was able to make a name for himself. In seven of the nine innings Gill has played in the 50-over format this year, he has opened for India and has managed three fifties while scoring 367 runs. The Punjab batter notched up his maiden hundred in the recently concluded tour against Zimbabwe. Back again 💙🏟️ pic.twitter.com/ZBGOZ92hPr — Shubman Gill (@ShubmanGill) October 28, 2022 Gill has evolved into a reliable and stable top-order batter capable of toggling seamlessly between opening the batting and coming in at No.3, and considering the pace at which he is scoring runs, Shubman can definitely give senior openers like Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan, a run for their money apropos the place in the next ODI World Cup squad. Even former India batter, VVS Laxman, who is the stand-in head coach for the team in the ODI series against New Zealand, had earlier admitted that management will have a tough time picking their batters for the World Cup next year. “The talent in the batting department, we are spoilt for choices. The selectors are going to have a tough decision next year (for the ODI World Cup). It is an opportunity for the youngsters,” Laxman had said in October. Rishabh Pant needs to step-up India look set to stick with Rishabh Pant as the wicketkeeper, after his maiden ODI ton in series against England earlier this year. But, going by his recent performance in the T20I series against New Zealand which was not up to the mark, Pant will have to pull up his socks in order to prove that management can bet on him in the coming years. It’s high time that the 25-year-old play responsibly and spends more time on the crease. Pant needs to anchor the innings whenever the situation demands him to rather than throwing away his wicket in excitement or due to poor shot selection, which has been the case time and again. 🇮🇳🏆💪 #TeamIndia #RP17 pic.twitter.com/GORy0vgnh2 — Rishabh Pant (@RishabhPant17) November 22, 2022 Meanwhile, the series will be a testing one for Shreyas Iyer as well, who has struggled with the short ball in the T20I series against New Zealand. Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur have a point to prove The ODI series will mark the return of bowling all-rounder Deepak Chahar, who was out of the team since October due to a back problem. Chahar is among the regulars in the ODI set-up and so is Shardul Thakur, who is also a bowling all-rounder. Given that they have a similar role in the team, it’s highly likely that one of both players will make it to the ODI World Cup squad. Moreover, the rise of Arshdeep Singh is likely to see him make his ODI debut in New Zealand and challenge for a berth in Team India for the multi-nation tournament to be held next year. Curios case of Sanju Samson and Umran Malik Top-order batter Sanju Samson and fiery pacer Umran Malik didn’t get to play a single game in the recently concluded three-match T20I series and there’s no proper explanation provided by the management or coach or senior players for the same. Hence, it is to be seen if the duo get the chance to showcase their skills in the ODI series or if they will once again warm the bench. Dhawan asserts he has ‘matured’ as leader Notably, it is not the first time that Dhawan will take up a captain’s role as he has led a second-string Indian team in the past and ahead of the series against New Zealand, the Delhi batter has asserted that he has ‘matured’ as a leader and will focus on ‘maintaining balance’ in the team. ”As you play more, you get confident in the decisions you take. Earlier, there used to be instances where I would give an extra over to a bowler out of regard (for him). But now, as I have matured, even if someone is feeling bad, I will take a decision that will help the team,” Dhawan told ESPNCricinfo . “When you play music on a string instrument, if the string is too loose, it won’t sound right, or if it’s too tight, it will break. So it is a question of creating a balance. (As a captain) creating that balance is very important. You need to understand when to pull the string tight and when to leave it a bit loose. That is an art. It is a matter of timing. At this stage I also understand when to say things to the players and how much to say,” he added.

Sahil Malhotra November 24th, 2022 9:55:10 IST India are set to play two cricket World Cups in next two years. AP Heads were expected to roll after the conclusion of the 2022 T20 World Cup as India’s wait for an ICC Trophy stretched for another year and, expectedly, the selection panel headed by Chetan Sharma became the first casualty as the BCCI sacked the entire committee earlier this week and invited fresh applications. During Sharma’s tenure as the chairman, India had disappointing outings in two T20 World Cups and the period saw some debatable decisions. Not to forget how the entire Virat Kohli captaincy episode unfolded. The next two years are very important white-ball years for the Indian cricket team with the 50-over and T20 World Cups and a lot of changes are expected to happen to meet the demands of the two formats, especially T20. For years now, IPL has served as a feeder system to the Indian cricket team as the world’s premier T20 league not only allows the players to showcase their talent on the big stage – against and with top players from around the world – but also puts Indian youngsters in the spotlight. The tournament, however, follows a very different approach from the Indian cricket setup and the biggest difference is the way squads/teams are put together in the T20 league. Yes, there are auctions which take place, but the year-long activity of scouting and identifying the right people for the right job is something from the Indian cricket board that can draw some inspiration. It’s high time the T20 format is looked at from a different perspective, ditching the old-school approach, which frankly seems quite outdated. Chetan Sharma-led national selection committee was sacked after India failed to win 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups. Image: ANI State-fed model The Indian selectors mostly operate on the state-fed model where players are picked on the basis of their performances in the domestic competitions – Ranji Trophy, Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy. However, a good show in the domestic circuit doesn’t always guarantee a national call-up and the IPL show certainly adds a major catalyst. But on most occasions, it’s these competitions which are the reference point for national selectors and a solid IPL show can certainly fast-track the journey. Most on-site visits are around these games and various selectors are spotted in the stands when these fixtures are underway. IPL, however, is different IPL teams follow a much more comprehensive approach and player scouting is a year-long activity. After speaking to a lot of franchises, it’s clear that the scouts never rest. The senior age group is where the scouting begins and most IPL scouts could be found on the sidelines of these competitions. Mumbai Indians, for instance, have a network featuring plenty of former, and a lot of recently retired, cricketers, to spot the right people for the right job. Don’t be surprised if you see a John Wright baking under the sun during a Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy fixture or a Parthiv Patel making the trip to Jhajjhar to watch a Men’s U-25 fixture between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. For Mumbai, it’s being the quiet spectator at competitive games and then inviting the shortlisted players to their training facilities for a 7-10 day hit. MI were the first team to go scouting in the age-group fixtures and it helped them wider the search and player pool. Even the camps at their training facilities are not meant to be mere trials. They treat it as an opportunity for the franchise to work closely with the players they see potential in. And once they identify you, they groom you and back you. Academies and the X-factor While most teams are heavy on scouting, there are some like Delhi Capitals who are very academy driven. The franchise has tie-ups with a lot of clubs, in the capital city, and spot and nurture talent around the year. They even participate in pan-India tournaments, like the JP Atray Memorial, with their Development Squad and identify players who could take the next step in the scouting process. A team like Lucknow Supergiants, one of the two new teams to join the IPL this year, prefers to not keep a jumbo squad and for them, it’s more about finding the right people for the right job. Gautam Gambhir, just like he did with KKR, follows that X-factor approach and fills in the blanks when he spots the required skill set. View this post on Instagram A post shared by DC Academy (@dccricketacademy) “Gautam has a set of his people who he trusts with information regarding players. But then he would personally watch the player, without the player’s knowledge of course, and then come to a conclusion of whether to invite him to the camp or not. If he’s not convinced, he would give his comprehensive feedback,” a source close to the former Indian cricketer tells us. Gautam’s former IPL team KKR, however, follows a very scout-driven approach led by AR Srikkanth. Srikkanth also performs that role for other teams of the group, and foreign scouting falls in place with his involvement in different leagues. Plus, the advantage of Srikkanth’s previous stints with various teams and set-ups, only helps KKR create a strong database. At the local and domestic levels, it’s Abhishek Nayar’s inputs which come in handy for the team. Camps, simulations and trials Unlike the state association trials, which are mostly jumbo in nature, IPL teams prefer a very format-driven approach and the camps/trials are dominated by match simulations. An opening batsman, identified by the scouts, is given a certain target – say to score 50 in the first four overs with his partner. Similarly, a middle-order batsman’s ability to play against spin and rotate the strike comes into the picture. Again, the X-factor! For bowlers, it’s about the holding job, variations and nailing yorkers at the death and the ability to make inroads with the new ball. Even when the players bat in pairs, their individual contributions and the manner in which they sync with their partners come into play. It’s not always that a player is picked on basis of one camp. There are some who have had numerous camps with various teams and an opportunity sometimes comes with the team they haven’t attended trials for. That’s the beauty of IPL and auctions. Net bowlers and ready replacements The concept of net bowlers came into play with the bio-bubble restrictions and teams, both IPL and national teams, preferred to carry jumbo squads to have both replacements and quality net sessions in check. Earlier, it was either the local state associations or the visiting country which would provide bowlers for net sessions. COVID-19 changed the scenario here and both the franchises and the Indian cricket team wouldn’t complain. While the Dubai leg of IPL saw net bowlers getting picked midway through the tournament, even by the teams they weren’t travelling with, the Indian cricket team made use of this during the away Test series against Australia when ill-timed injuries made way for net bowlers in the Playing XI. Lessons from the IPL One thing is clear from the way franchises operate, it makes a lot of sense to treat the format like a different beast and very professionally. Unlike the fifty-over and Test format, T20 allows very little time to return in the game as momentum can swing in a space of few deliveries. So is the old-school selection approach featuring zonal selectors, with the criteria mentioned by the Indian cricket board, the way forward? Or can the board take cues from the way IPL machinery operates, independently, and put together a system in place which treats the form exclusively? Revisiting the TRDO? The last time the Indian cricket team took giant strides forward (winning the T20 World Cup and 50-over WC in space of four years and dominating Tests) and unearthed talent for the future was when the Indian cricket board initiated the TRDO (Talent Resource Development Officer’s) wing in the early 2000s. The system saw the likes of MS Dhoni, Ishant Sharma, Piyush Chawla and RP Singh arrive at the big stage and serve Indian cricket for a long time. The brainchild of talent spotter and writer Makarand Waigankar, the system saw immediate and long-term results. If in place, what should the TRDO wing for T20s look like? In a chat with Cricketnext.com, Waigankar listed a few points which must be followed to meet the demands of the format and the growing cricket ecosystem of India. “Look at the number of games being played right now. So many matches are being played right now, in the 1000s. It’s very important to first use technology and have a strong database in place,” says Waigankar. Will a T20-only TRDO help? “Yes, certainly,” says Waigankar. “Pick TRDOs from various zones and ensure a person from the zone is not operating in that. So the person from the North goes South, from the South, goes North and so on. Just get the bias out of the picture and then blood the talent when it’s ready. Do not waste crucial years of a player on the bench. I identified Sanju Samson for KKR when he was 14. Since then, how many games has he played for India? What’s the point then? Find the players, back them, and play them. Simple,” he adds. Getting rid of the traditional approach Selectors from each zone, one chairman and the same old drill are something which can be revisited to meet the demands of the T20 format especially. BCCI has invited applications for the new set of selectors and chairman and the criteria for applying are the same as the last time around. 1000s of applications are expected to reach the Indian cricket board’s inbox when the deadline ends on November 28. “What is this, a corporate job application? More than 2000 applications are expected to reach BCCI’s inbox. Who is going to go through those? What’s the point of such a tedious process? This is a mockery of the entire process and the setup. Not needed at all. Either has the criteria revisited. So many people are going to meet these criteria. Just like it makes sense to have the different white ball and red ball captains, it’s important to have different selectors for both red and white ball format,” says Waigankar. Mission 2024 Mission Melbourne was unaccomplished for Team India as their wait for an ICC trophy continued after the semi-final defeat in the 2022 edition. It remains to be seen what happens on the team and leadership front, but with selectors being the first set of changes, it’s important this crucial piece comes together before the blueprint for the 2024 edition is put in place. After winning the title in the inaugural edition, India have reached the final only once – in the 2014 edition – and India would want to change things around as they hit the road to the 2024 edition which will be jointly hosted by the United States and the West Indies.

General manager of football Tod Viney said Ratten was an excellent addition to the coaching staff. “Brett comes to the club as an experienced, knowledgeable football person and we are thrilled to welcome him to Arden St,” Viney said.“Brett is a highly regarded operator who has been part of premiership success during his time at Hawthorn. His vast coaching experience will be a huge asset for our club.”Collingwood great and former Hawthorn ruck coach Damien Monkhorst will also join the Kangaroos. Monkhorst will make his first appearance at the club on Friday after recent talks with Clarkson. Monkhorst had plans to go on a national motorbike ride but decided to join forces with Clarkson again after parting ways with the Hawks. Monkhorst will also work part-time with the Roos’ young talls including Tristan Xerri, Callum Coleman Jones and Jacob Edwards. The Roos have parted ways with development coach Anthony Rocca. Big-name Cat set to step into vacant CEO job- Glenn McFarlaneA final series of interviews and tests on Friday will determine North Melbourne’s new chief executive, with Geelong general manager of football Simon Lloyd firming to win the role.It is understood Lloyd will be among a very small group of remaining candidates who will meet with the Kangaroos this week as a decision closes in on Ben Amarfio’s replacement.Lloyd’s extensive record in a variety of roles at a number of AFL clubs has bolstered his chances, given the Kangaroos’ preference for a person with a deep understanding of football and club-land.The highly-regarded administrator has overseen Geelong’s football program since 2018, and played a critical off-field role in the Cats’ 2022 premiership triumph.Prior to that, he had been Geelong’s director of coaching, having also been an assistant coach under Ross Lyon when Fremantle made the 2013 Grand Final.He also worked at Collingwood and Hawthorn in various portfolios including psychologist, high-performance manager, development and specialist coach.Lloyd’s football nous and his extensive record inside a number of AFL clubs has long seen him considered a future club chief executive.Others who have been part of the interview process have included Melbourne Cricket Club general manager of commercial operations and partnership Jen Watt and NBL basketball commissioner Jeremy Loeliger.It is understood Loeliger has been informed he has missed out on the position. Amarfio resigned from the position in September but stayed on until last month, with the Kangaroos undertaking an extensive search for his replacement.This marks yet another change for the new-look Kangaroos who elevated Dr. Sonja Hood to the presidency in March, and in recent months appointed new coach Alastair Clarkson and football boss Todd Viney, who will lead the on-field program next season.Collingwood and Essendon have also been in the hunt for a new CEO following the departure of Mark Anderson and Xavier Campbell, with both clubs expected to fill those roles in the coming weeks.","pubDate":"2022-11-24 03:48:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket great Simon O’Donnell tells Justin

per cent audience share, after falling behind the ABC this year.Ten have never been further behind rivals Nine and Seven in the ratings three-horse race, losing audience share year on year at the same time Nine and Seven are growing their numbers.At a metro level, Ten fell -0.3 points behind the ABC this year to now rank as Australia’s fourth network when all are included, and should the trends continue, a previously inconceivable low point could occur in 2023 where Ten will fall below a 20 per cent share.The startling numbers paint an intriguing picture as Cricket Australia’s TV rights negotiations begin to heat up.News Corp has been told that cashed-up Ten and Paramount is the early leading bidder in the CA negotiations, with the process now up to second round bids.But Ten’s bumper offer only adds another layer to the reality that CA’s search for a free-to-air partner is highly complex.Complications and compromises exist with every option.Channel 7 is trying to terminate its current deal with Cricket Australia in the Federal Court and it would be a stunning turn of events for CA to choose to partner with the network again.SCBBL PROMOChannel 9 meanwhile, has already extended and upgraded its Australian Open Tennis rights, putting a strict limit on how much cricket it could actually broadcast, not to mention how much money they’d have left over to spend.If CA went with Nine for Test cricket it could also create a situation where tennis is being promoted during the coverage – the Australian Open being the direct rival of the Big Bash League.In Channel 10, the money is there, but the risk is partnering with a network with a reputation for being the place where sports fade away.Cricket Australia may take confidence from the success the Big Bash enjoyed on Ten and back the quality of Test cricket in particular to rise above the tide.But the declining year on year ratings of the Melbourne Cup on Ten as well as its overall metro and national share dropping to 22.1 per cent this year are alarm bells not easy to cast aside.","pubDate":"2022-11-24

under the spotlight following explosive remarks about his tenure as national coach.","content":"In a revealing and insightful interview with CODE Sports, Langer attacked anonymous “cowards” that leaked against him, taking aim at the Cricket Australia board for his unceremonious sacking.Watch Australia v West Indies. Every test match live and ad-break in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >The 52-year-old claimed Australian captains Pat Cummins and Aaron Finch failed to provide direct feedback about the playing group’s grievances with his intense coaching style.“I spoke to Pat Cummins. He said to me about five times, ‘This might be brutally honest.’ I said, ‘Pat, there is nothing brutal about your feedback. What is brutal is I’m hearing it behind my back through the media or through sources.’ No one’s telling me. Tell me,” Langer said.“Everyone was being nice to my face but I was reading about this stuff and half of it, I swear to God and on my kids’ lives, I could not believe that is what was making the papers.“A lot of journalists use the word ‘source’. I would say, change that word to ‘coward’. A coward says, not a source. Because what do you mean a source says? They’ve either got an axe to grind with someone and they won’t come and say it to your face, or they’re just leaking stuff for their own agenda. I hate that.”Langer’s remarks were rubbished by CA chief executive Nick Hockley on Wednesday, who claimed that “regular formal and informal opportunities to provide and receive feedback took place throughout his tenure”.According to The Age, Langer was handed extensive feedback following two separate independent reviews conducted by leadership expert Tim Ford.And the West Australian was seen struggling to accept feedback from Khawaja during popular docuseries The Test: A New Era for Australia’s Team.Following the 2018 Boxing Day Test against India at the MCG, a nervous Khawaja directly informed Langer that players were “intimidated” by him.“We can’t always control the result. You get better as individuals, players, staff, everyone, be in better control of that emotion, be more level-headed, without trying to make it too complicated,” Khawaja said.“I think that’s what the boys are trying to say. Does that makes sense?“The boys are intimidated by you, Alf. I think there’s a bit of the walking on eggshells sort of thing. I feel like I think the boys are afraid to say it.”Players were seemingly afraid to confront Langer — with the exception of Khawaja.The Queenslander was dropped from the Test side in 2019 following an underwhelming Ashes campaign, but the talented left-hander threw his support behind Langer after reports of player unrest emerged two years later.“How do you think JL feels? He probably feels like the guys in the team are stabbing him in the back, and that’s what it looks like,” Khawaja said on his YouTube channel last year.“That’s why it’s so disappointing. It’s actually a really bad look. This is something the group needs to sort out ASAP.”Last year, Hockley and then CA chair Earl Eddings were forced to call an emergency meeting with senior players to address issues within the changeroom, prompting Langer to take a step back and delegate more control to his support staff.The team’s performance improved after Langer handed responsibility over to assistant coaches Andrew McDonald and Michael Di Venuto, winning a maiden T20 World Cup title in the United Arab Emirates and retaining the Ashes undefeated on home soil.In February, Langer resigned as national coach after CA offered him a six-month contract extension.News Corp reporter Robert Craddocksuggests that Khawaja was the only player capable of short-circuiting the vicious feud between Langer and his team.Unfortunately, he wasn’t in the changeroom when Australia needed him.“I didn’t really know what was going on. I wasn’t part of the process. I just came back into the team a few months ago,” Khawaja said following Langer’s resignation.“I’ve been a little bit out of it.“I love him as a bloke, he’s a legend.“He brought humility back to the Australian team … I know what we played like before he was coach and I know what we played like when he was coach.”Nine months after Langer’s unceremonious resignation, tensions have reached breaking point.A war of words has erupted between CA and Langer one week out from the first Test of the home summer, an unnecessary distortion ahead of West Indies series.“We have not commented to date other than to correct inaccuracies, of which there are a number in Justin’s comments,” Hockley said in a statement.“I am disappointed by Justin’s comments unfairly criticising some of our players. The playing group are aware they have my full support.“After an excellent performance against England in the one-day international series, we are fully focused on an exciting Test series against the West Indies and South Africa.”","pubDate":"2022-11-23 23:29:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hussey opens up on Langer’s ‘coward’ comments","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/hussey-opens-up-on-langers-coward-comments/video/1b18e2377264305dd6247305fc21fb4a","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Former Australian star Mike Hussey has given his thoughts on Justin Langer's controversial comments following his axing from the position of Australian coach.","content":"Cricket: Former Australian star Mike Hussey has given his thoughts on Justin Langer's controversial comments following his axing from the position of Australian coach.","pubDate":"2022-11-23 23:27:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"20 wickets fall on a chaotic Day 2 between WA & NSW","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/20-wickets-fall-on-a-chaotic-day-2-between-wa-nsw/video/90c647f27a096b3dbfcf59c650ee368a","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: In a chaotic day at the SCG, 20 wickets have fallen on Day 2 of New South Wales'clash against Western Australia.","content":"Cricket: In a chaotic day at the SCG, 20 wickets have fallen on Day 2 of New South Wales'clash against Western Australia.","pubDate":"2022-11-23 23:09:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket fans stunned by 'woeful' scenes in Sheffield Shield carnage","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/cricket-fans-stunned-woeful-scenes-sheffield-shield-carnage-222737245.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-23 22:27:37","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9b2b3410-6b7c-11ed-b6bf-5c17795f616d","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket Australia boss fires back at Justin Langer in ugly war of words","link":"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/cricket-australia-boss-nick-hockley-fires-back-justin-langer-ugly-war-words-204708611.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-23 20:47:08","image_url":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/ca054bc0-6b6f-11ed-9f5b-2ca41b943bee","source_id":"yahoo","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everyone was being nice to my face: Langer slams ‘cowards’ in Australia team","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/24/everyone-was-being-nice-to-my-face-langer-slams-cowards-in-australia-team/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne: Former Australia coach Justin Langer has hit out at the “cowards” in the national team, saying he “hated” that some players were going behind his back and leaking details from inside the dressing room.

The 52-year-old, who guided Australia to a 4-0 series win in the Ashes at home and a maiden T20 World Cup title last year, stepped down as chief coach in February after he was not offered a long-term contract extension by Cricket Australia. Langer had faced complaints about his “rigid” coaching style from senior players such as Aaron Finch, Pat Cummins and former Test captain Tim Paine. “Everyone was being nice to my face, but I was reading about this stuff and half of it, I swear to God and on my kids’ lives, I could not believe that is what was making the papers. A lot of journalists use the word ‘source’. I would say, change that word to ‘coward’,” Langer was quoted as saying by News Corp media. “Because what do you mean ‘a source says’? They’ve either got an axe to grind with someone and they won’t come and say it to your face, or they’re just leaking stuff for their own agenda. I hate that.” There have been numerous media reports in the run-up to the T20 World Cup about alleged discontent in the dressing room due to Langer’s coaching style. Langer, who had taken charge after Darren Lehmann quit following the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa, said it was difficult to resign as he was enjoying his job. “We were number one in the world. I’ve never enjoyed coaching more and I’ve still got sacked. That’s the hardest thing,” Langer said. —PTI Everyone was being nice to my face: Langer slams ‘cowards’ in Australia team added by KR Desk on 12:11 am November 24, 2022 View all posts by KR Desk → KR Desk Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-23 18:41:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T-20 Martyrs Police Premier Cricket League concludes","link":"https://thenorthlines.com/t-20-martyrs-police-premier-cricket-league-concludes/","keywords":["Jammu Kashmir","Kashmir","Sports"],"creator":["Northlines"],"video_url":null,"description":"NL Correspondent Ganderbal Nov 23: The valedictory function of ‘T20 Martyrs Police Premier Cricket League Tournament’ was held at Qamariya Ground Ganderbal.

FP Trending November 23rd, 2022 23:37:32 IST Dinesh Karthik might not be seen in Indian colours again. Sportzpics The T20 World Cup in Australia was a bittersweet moment for Dinesh Karthik. The wicketkeeper-batter, who made a spectacular comeback into the Indian side this year, was included in the T20 World Cup squad after a long time. But Karthik failed to make his mark in the high-stakes tournament . India endured a crushing defeat against England in the semi-finals, ending their dreams of lifting the trophy for a second time. Now, Dinesh Karthik, who is presently being rested by the selectors, has put up a cryptic post, prompting speculations about his retirement. “Worked hard towards the goal of playing the T20 World Cup for India and it was such a proud feeling to do so… we did fall short of the ultimate motive, but it did fill my life with many memories to cherish. Thank you to all my fellow players, coaches, friends, and most importantly the fans for the undying support,” wrote Dinesh Karthik. He ended his post with the hashtag – ‘dreams do come true’. A video shared by Karthik also features a montage of moments from the tournament. In the clip, Karthik can be seen hanging out with his family and his kids. The video also featured him enjoying some light moments with Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Ravichandran Ashwin.

Another remarked, “Pls DK we beg you not to retire from any format, come back again even stronger”.

For team India, Karthik had to compete with Rishabh Pant for the wicketkeeper’s role. In the World Cup, Karthik failed to score big. In the four games he played, he managed to score only 14 runs.

Sahil Malhotra November 23rd, 2022 23:20:02 IST Jofra Archer/ Twitter In the February mega auction ahead of the 2022 edition of the Indian Premier League, it was player No. 171 who caught the attention of everyone. England speedster Jofra Archer had registered himself for the auction but was only available for the 2023 and 2024 seasons due to an injury. The 27-year-old, who last played international cricket in the away series against India, underwent elbow surgery before a stress fracture on return to the County circuit ruled him out for the remainder of the English season back then. All this, however, didn’t affect Mumbai Indians’ plans one bit as the franchise went hard for the speedster at the mega auctions. MI owner Akash Ambani didn’t put the pedal down and the war between Rajasthan Royals and MI took the bidding to Rs 4.6 crores in a few minutes. Both RR and MI had acquired 12 players each till then but Mumbai’s superior purse – Rs 23.70 crores – allowed them to go all out for the seamer. SRH joined the party briefly towards the fag end before MI sealed the deal at Rs 8 crores. There were a lot of riders at that signing, but Mumbai were clear with its plans. The franchise put to work a long-term vision with a potentially explosive pairing of Jasprit Bumrah and Archer. Against popular perception, MI didn’t look to beef up their wallets ahead of the mini-auctions too as they retained the English seamer. Jofra Archer bowling in England whites, to Zak Crawley pic.twitter.com/Z8Z8appECw — Will Macpherson (@willis_macp) November 23, 2022 After a long absence , Archer is back in the middle and was seen in action during the fixture between England and England Lions in Abu Dhabi. According to a Telegraph report, Archer troubled England opener Zak Crawley and even hit him on the helmet. MI’s pace battery Still early days, but Archer’s return to competitive cricket will trigger a sigh of relief in the Mumbai Indians camp. The five-time IPL winners had also acquired Australia seamer Jason Behrendorff in a trade with RCB earlier this month and with Archer and Bumrah, the trio are set to make a very potent seam-bowling attack. While many termed the Archer bid a gamble from Mumbai Indians, the franchise seemed clear with its thought process. And an injury was certainly not going to change their thought process. “If someone would have told me that we would be walking back with Ishan Kishan and Jofra Archer, I wouldn’t have believed them,” Akash Ambani had said after the mega auction. The focus could be on spin at mini-auction and Indian seamers Archer’s return could also help MI get some answers and help them get a lot of clarity ahead of mini-auctions. A quick look at the retained players list is enough to understand what’s missing. The team could now well look to add some Indian seamers to the mix and look for quality spin options – something which was missing in the previous editions. MI released Mayank Markande, Murugan Ashwin, and Sanjay Yadav and with only Hrithik Shokeen and Kumar Kartikeya in the ranks, the team is likely to go big on a spin in the upcoming auctions.

This bloke is batting on a different planet.’ Look at everyone else’s scores and look at this bloke that’s 111 off 50 (51),” Maxwell said on the Grade Cricketer Podcast.“So the next day, I watched the full replay on Kayo, watched the full innings. The embarrassing thing is he is so much better than everyone else. It’s actually hard to watch, it’s like ohh God, no one we have got is close to that.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Grade Cricketer (@thegradecricketer) Suryakumar has developed a reputation as a 360-degree player because of the shots he has been playing around the field. Maxwell believes that it is ridiculous and bizarre since he makes it look casual.“Suryakumar Yadav is doing in such a bizarre ungainly way where he’s hitting the middle of the bat by just like stepping across to someone who is bowling 145 from off the wicket on the other side and then just put his head down, walking down, chewing some gum, glove tap, bat tap, then off he goes and does it again.“He’s playing some of the most ridiculous shots I’ve ever seen and he’s doing it stupidly consistently.
