Wobei, so brutal wie in Kapfenberg und Simmering geht es im Derby della Madonnina wohl auch nicht zu, steht doch das Spiel zwischen den beiden Stadtklubs im Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seit jeher unter der Schirmherrschaft der Gottesmutter. Laut Volksmund wacht sie als goldene Statue auf einer Spitze des Mailänder Doms darüber, dass sich Spieler und Fans benehmen. Aber vielleicht sind sich Rossoneri und Nerazzurri gerade deshalb so spinnefeind, weil sie Zwillinge sind? Beide Vereine gingen aus demselben Klub hervor - dem 1899 gegründeten Milan Cricket and Football Club. Das lief einige Zeit gut, bis sich 1908 mehrere Mitglieder abspalteten und ihren eigenen Fußballverein - den Football Club Internazionale Milano - gründeten. Sie waren darüber verärgert, dass beim nationalistisch ausgerichteten Milan CFC nur Italiener spielen durften. Mit dem Zusatz Internazionale wollte man die Offenheit des Vereins für ausländische Spieler betonen. Real Madrid - Manchester City AC Milan - Inter Mailand Mi., 21 Uhr/Servus-TV Rückspiele am 16./17. Mai Heute freilich gehören Legionäre auf beiden Seiten zur Normalität. Das erste Duell zwischen Inter und Milan war im Übrigen eine der wenigen Partien, die nicht in Mailand stattfanden. Am 8. Oktober 1908 trafen die frisch getrennten Geschwister beim Freundschaftsturniers Coppa Chiasso im Schweizer Chiasso aufeinander. Die Derby-Premiere entschied der Associazione Calcio Milan mit 2:1 für sich. Das erste Match in Mailand stieg am 10. Jänner 1909. Das Stadion Giuseppe Meazza, das die Fans aber lieber nach dem Stadtteil San Siro nennen, wurde 1926 errichtet und dient seither dem Derby della Madonnina als Spielstätte. Sie trägt den Namen eines der populärsten und erfolgreichsten Stürmer der nationalen Fußballgeschichte. Mit 284 Treffern ist Meazza Rekordtorschütze seines langjährigen Vereins Inter Mailand und liegt in der ewigen Bestenliste der Torschützen der Serie A mit 216 Toren neben José Altafini auf dem vierten Platz. Die Arena, die seit 1978 Meazzas Namen trägt, steht im Übrigen im Eigentum der beiden rivalisierenden Klubs, die es im Unterschied zu 1860 München und dem FC Bayern geschafft haben, ihr Haus gemeinsam zu bestellen. Aktuell fasst das Stadion San Siro rund 76.000 Zuschauer, und auch beim Derby della Madonnina am Mittwochabend (21 Uhr/ Servus-TV) wird das Oval bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt sein. Für die Stadtrivalen Inter und Milan geht es um nicht viel weniger als den Einzug ins Finale der Königsklasse. Und das will was heißen, wartet doch die italienische Fußballnation seit Inters Triumph im Jahr 2010 auf einen Champions-League-Sieg. Vor 13 Jahren setzten sich die Nerazzurri unter Jose Mourinho in ihrer Triple-Saison die europäische Krone auf. Marko Arnautovic konnte in seinem Jahr in Mailand zumindest eine knappe Stunde in der Liga mitwirken, in der Champions League kam der damals 21-Jährige nie zum Zug. Milan wartet noch länger auf eine Teilnahme in einem Champions-League-Finale. 2007 holten sich die Rossoneri letztmals den Titel. \"Wir werden alles rundherum genießen bis Mittwoch 20.59 Uhr, und dann müssen wir bereit sein. Wir müssen dieses Prickeln fühlen\", sagte Milans Trainer Stefano Pioli über die Stimmung in der Metropole. Das Euroderby wurde ausgerufen. \"Es ist nicht nur ein Derby, es ist DAS Derby\", hielt Inters Coach Simone Inzaghi fest. Er warnte vor zu viel Übermut: \"Was das Herz angeht, habe ich keine Zweifel. Was den Kopf angeht, wäre es gut, wenn wir ihn benutzen und uns erinnern, dass über 180 Minuten auf uns warten.\" Es ist das 236. Duell, in der Bilanz die Nase vorne hat derzeit Inter. Das Rückspiel steigt am 16. Mai erneut im San Siro. Schon jetzt ist fix, dass sich Italiens Fußball nach Jahren mit ausbleibenden Erfolgen wieder über einen Champions-League-Finalisten freuen darf. Juventus stand 2015 und 2017 im Endspiel, verlor gegen den FC Barcelona beziehungsweise Real Madrid aber beide. Eine Favoritenrolle lässt sich wiederum noch nicht ausmachen. In der Serie A ist Inter Vierter, AC Milan Fünfter und damit außerhalb der Startplätze für die kommende Champions League. Zwei Zähler trennen die beiden Nachbarn. Dreimal trafen die Klubs in dieser Saison aufeinander. Im Supercup siegte Inter in Saudi-Arabien mit 3:0, in der Liga gab es jeweils einen Erfolg von Milan sowie von Inter. Pioli und Inzaghi gaben jedenfalls an, sich nicht als Favorit zu fühlen. Das Mailänder Duell um das Finalticket der Königsklasse gab es bereits vor 20 Jahren. 2003 spielten Andrij Schewtschenko, Paolo Maldini oder Filippo Inzaghi für Milan, Inter bot Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti und Hernan Crespo auf. 0:0 und 1:1 endeten die Partien. Milan stieg dank Schewtschenkos Auswärtstor auf und holte im rein-italienischen Endspiel gegen Juventus im Elfmeterschießen den Titel. Zu einer inneritalienischen Angelegenheit wird das große Finale am 10. Juni in Istanbul nicht werden. Das zweite Finalticket matchen sich Real und Manchester City aus (nach Redaktionsschluss).","pubDate":"2023-05-09 15:28:34","image_url":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_cache/image/1xURJYMHxM6mbj4AbNIfUbRBez3yhI7mQgbAGMdMiT8lMpvXX9H8KQL-2RcfG6X9jn5xldgk87rhv6Yme4GxPfzB0506QqqzkCKIOdjLvXOpCzWHKWAeR0tj6IYA66RSbBrO1Y2LcACF1i9KJ3W_fGmzigPXGRqwvzy0sE_kv_L3SGtQqn57H0RwRZgZY_fdgaxGLhVJB7A6_kyN8ZdlEOH8--kVLxQB2D/230509_1733_948_0900_434789_italy_feature_heritage_achitecture.jpg","source_id":"wienerzeitung","category":["sports"],"country":["austria"],"language":"german"},{"title":"Lionel Messi Playing Club Football In Saudi Arabia Is Soon To Become Reality: Reports","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/lionel-messi-playing-club-football-in-saudi-arabia-is-soon-to-become-reality-reports/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Lionel Messi Playing Club Football In Saudi Arabia Is Soon To Become Reality: Reports Lionel Messi is currently employed with Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain and will leave the club at the end of the season.

Messi is currently under two-week suspension by his current club Paris Saint-Germain for an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia last week. “Messi is a done deal. He will play in Saudi Arabia next season,” AFP quoted a source saying. “The contract is exceptional. It’s huge. We are just finalising some small details,” the source further added. Ever since his trip to the middle-east country was exposed, there have several rumours about the PSG forward shifting his base to the Asian country. Interestingly, Messi’s greatest rival Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr last year. For the unknown, Messi is the tourism ambassador of Saudi Arabia and visited the middle-east country with his family. However, following his suspension, the Argentine World Cup winner apologized to his club and teammates in a video.

The City coach said his team would try and capitalise on an “opportunity” instead of aiming to make Carlo Ancelotti’s reigning champions pay for eliminating them at the same stage last season. Follow the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in our LIVE BLOG below! The former Barcelona player and manager was at odds with City’s defensive midfielder Rodri, who said the team were hungry for revenge against the record 14-time winners on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu. “It will be a huge mistake, we’re not here for revenge, just an opportunity,” Guardiola told a news conference. “Last season we did everything, more than everything to reach the final, but (in) football … it’s not enough.” MATCH CENTRE: Scores, stats and more! City have never lifted the trophy but Madrid have triumphed five times in the last nine seasons. Guardiola’s side beat Madrid 4-3 in the first leg last season and led by a goal in the return, until two late Rodrygo Goes strikes forced extra-time. Karim Benzema scored a penalty in the additional period to send Madrid through to the Paris final, where they beat Liverpool. Watch the world’s best footballers every week with beIN SPORTS on Kayo.

We’ve learnt from the past but I don’t like to talk about the past. “We’ve learnt a lot, it’s another year, another goal, with the hunger of having revenge.” Guardiola did agree with Rodri that City played well over both ties last season, despite their eventual elimination. “We had an exceptional first game in Manchester, we did a really good game here,” said Guardiola. “All we can do is congratulate them and move forward. One year later, we are here.” The coach said he thought his side would one day triumph in Europe, after disappointment in the 2021 final, where they were beaten by Chelsea. Guardiola praised his club’s stability, in contrast to other sides who triumph but then fall away in subsequent years. City have reached at least the last eight in each of the past six seasons. “One day we will reach the final and we will win it,” said Guardiola. “I wouldn’t like to win the Champions League and then go down and down and down. “Being stable is the most important things as a club, Madrid are an example.” Follow the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in our LIVE BLOG below!

On the contrary, Lionel Messi’s football career witnessed an abrupt end in Europe as he was suspended by PSG last week for his unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. He scored 31 goals in 71 appearances for the French champions and is expected to secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title later this month, however, he has failed in his mission to take PSG to a first Champions League win, facing back-to-back last-16 defeats. Barcelona had been eyeing to take the 35-year-old back to Camp Nou, where he won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League titles before an emotional departure in 2021. Though Saudi Arabia is alleged of diverting attention from its human rights record using sports, Riyadh will be able to boast of having arguably the two best football players of the modern era in their unheralded domestic league. Ronaldo is playing for Al Nassr, while a source close to the negotiations who told AFP that Messi’s move to Saudi Arabia was a “done deal”, stopped short of saying which club the Argentine will join. World Cup mission accomplished The absence of a World Cup winner’s medal had long been Exhibit A in the debate about why Messi was unable to go above Pele and Diego Maradona in football. But with Argentina’s triumph over France in last year’s nail-biting World Cup in Doha, the case surely reached its end. In his three decades football career, Messi won 37 club trophies, seven Ballon d’Or awards, and six European Golden Boots.

But his career at the highest level in Europe appears to have finished on a low note. Messi was suspended by PSG last week for making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia.

In a glittering career that has spanned three decades, Messi has won 37 club trophies, seven Ballon d’Or awards and six European Golden Boots.

While Pele’s three World Cup triumphs remain unrivalled, the Brazilian icon’s club career pales in comparison to Messi’s. In his peak years with Barcelona, the Argentinian regularly scaled the pinnacle of European club football in the Champions League – arguably a technically superior arena than international football. Maradona meanwhile won only one World Cup, and never lifted a European Cup during a club career in Europe remembered mostly for spells with Barcelona and Napoli. The counter-argument of course is that Pele and Maradona played in an era where players were offered far less protection than the likes of Messi and Ronaldo. Pele hobbled out of the 1966 World Cup after taking one brutal tackle too many; Maradona was also subjected to roughhouse treatment throughout his career. Maradona’s former international team-mate Jorge Burruchaga is reluctant to compare players across generations. Burruchaga, scorer of the winning goal – set up by Maradona – in the 1986 World Cup final victory over West Germany has said simply that Messi is the greatest player of his era. “Win or lose, Messi is not more or less than Maradona,” Burruchaga told AFP during the World Cup. “Messi is going to be in history whatever happens. “There are five players in the past 70 years who can be considered the best in the world – (Alfredo) Di Stefano, Johan Cruyff, Pele, Maradona and Messi.” The last name on that list is potentially leaving the European elite for good, but Messi is yet to end an international career that has already produced 102 goals in 174 matches. The Copa America in the United States next year could still provide a fitting swansong.","content":"For his legions of admirers, the debate about Messi’s right to be regarded as the greatest footballer in history was officially put to bed when he led Argentina to the title in Qatar in December.

Burruchaga, scorer of the winning goal – set up by Maradona – in the 1986 World Cup final victory over West Germany has said simply that Messi is the greatest player of his era. “Win or lose, Messi is not more or less than Maradona,” Burruchaga told AFP during the World Cup. “Messi is going to be in history whatever happens. “There are five players in the past 70 years who can be considered the best in the world – (Alfredo) Di Stefano, Johan Cruyff, Pele, Maradona and Messi.” The last name on that list is potentially leaving the European elite for good, but Messi is yet to end an international career that has already produced 102 goals in 174 matches. The Copa America in the United States next year could still provide a fitting swansong.","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:35:37","image_url":"https://i.samaaenglish.tv/large/2023/05/0917352400b5b23.webp?r=173537","source_id":"samaaenglish","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ahead Of Mega Tournament India U17 Men","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/ahead-of-mega-tournament-india-u17-men/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports AFC U-17 Asian Cup: Ahead Of Mega Tournament India U17 Men’s Football Team Gear Up For Getafe FC Clash India U-17 men’s team is all set to face Getafe CF U-18 on Wednesday in Otero de Herreros, Segovia, in their fifth practice game in Spain.

After a string of fine performances, in which they played Atletico de Madrid U-17s (4-1), CD Leganes U-18s (0-2), Atletico de Madrid U-16s (2-1), and Real Madrid U-17s (3-3), the boys will now focus on the last two matches in Spain before heading to Germany for two more weeks. Head coach Bibiano Fernandes said, “The boys are motivated to work harder after the last few matches, especially after the result against Real Madrid, which has been very positive. However, the India U-17 head coach was quick to steer his boys away from any possible Icarus paradox. “The results in the last few matches have been quite promising, but we are also aware of the complacency which is the natural tendency of human behavior. We are playing all these matches to prepare for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup, which is our ultimate goal. “Of course, these matches have been great, but they can be a double-edged sword in that they could make the players complacent. The coaching staff has been working hard to condition the players mentally so that they maintain this consistency through to the Asian Cup,” said Fernandes. India’s game against Getafe U-18s will be a challenging one for the boys, especially in the physical aspect. “Of course, no game is easy at this level, and Getafe U-18s are a very good side. They are technically sound, and I believe they are also physically more imposing than us. But we also have our strong points, and will play accordingly,” he said. “We’ve got two more matches to go in Spain, and then we move on to Germany. The boys are progressing well, and hopefully, they will be at the proper level ahead of the Asian Cup,” he said. The Blue Colts have been training in Spain over the last few weeks as part of their preparation for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup, which is set to take place in Thailand next month. India, who have been placed in Group D of the Asian Cup, will face Vietnam (June 17), Uzbekistan (June 20), and Japan (June 23) in Pathum Thani and Bangkok. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:16:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Messi, Fraser-Pryce win top Laureus global sports awards","link":"https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/297405-messi-fraser-pryce-win-top-laureus-global-sports-awards","keywords":null,"creator":["Naharnet Newsdesk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi has won a top accolade as world Sportsman of the Year and picked up another award as a member of the team of the year following Argentina's World Cup soccer victory in 2022.

Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce finally broke through to win the Sportswoman of the Year award on her sixth nomination. Fraser-Pryce's 2022 exploits included winning the 100-meter gold at the World Athletics Championships for the fifth time. The Laureus Sports Awards honoring eight winners were held live in Paris on Monday night for the first time since 2020. It was Messi's second individual title after sharing that honor with Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton in 2020. Fraser-Pryce, who has won three Olympic and 10 world championship gold medals, called her award \"one of the greatest honors of my career.\" \"When athletes have the spotlight, it's important the example we set is the best it can be . . . we have a responsibility to influence the next generation in a positive way,\" she said. Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz's victory at the 2022 U.S. Open and his rise to the No. 1 ranking saw him take the Breakthrough of the Year award. Alcaraz, who celebrated his 20th birthday last week, won Sunday's final of the Madrid Open. Christian Eriksen was the recipient of the Comeback of the Year award after recovering from a cardiac arrest to return to Premier League football with Brentford and then Manchester United. The world Action Sportsperson of the Year went to American-born Chinese freestyler skier Eileen Gu, who was 18 during the Winter Olympics in Beijing. She became the first athlete to win three medals in freestyle skiing at a single Olympics — gold in both the halfpipe and big air events, and silver in slopestyle. Nominees for the Laureus awards are determined by international media and the winners are voted on by the 71 members of the Laureus World Sports Academy – athletes from the past 50 years.","pubDate":"2023-05-09 11:46:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"naharnet","category":["sports"],"country":["lebanon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Madonnina wacht wieder","link":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/sport/fussball/2188059-Madonnina-wacht-wieder.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Inter Mailand gegen AC Milan, das ist Brutalität, möchte man in Abwandlung eines bekannten Qualtinger-Zitats meinen.

Wobei, so brutal wie in Kapfenberg und Simmering geht es im Derby della Madonnina wohl auch nicht zu, steht doch das Spiel zwischen den beiden Stadtklubs im Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seit jeher unter der Schirmherrschaft der Gottesmutter. Laut Volksmund wacht sie als goldene Statue auf einer Spitze des Mailänder Doms darüber, dass sich Spieler und Fans benehmen. Aber vielleicht sind sich Rossoneri und Nerazzurri gerade deshalb so spinnefeind, weil sie Zwillinge sind? Beide Vereine gingen aus demselben Klub hervor - dem 1899 gegründeten Milan Cricket and Football Club. Das lief einige Zeit gut, bis sich 1908 mehrere Mitglieder abspalteten und ihren eigenen Fußballverein - den Football Club Internazionale Milano - gründeten. Sie waren darüber verärgert, dass beim nationalistisch ausgerichteten Milan CFC nur Italiener spielen durften. Mit dem Zusatz Internazionale wollte man die Offenheit des Vereins für ausländische Spieler betonen. Real Madrid - Manchester City AC Milan - Inter Mailand Mi., 21 Uhr/Servus-TV Rückspiele am 16./17. Mai Heute freilich gehören Legionäre auf beiden Seiten zur Normalität. Das erste Duell zwischen Inter und Milan war im Übrigen eine der wenigen Partien, die nicht in Mailand stattfanden. Am 8. Oktober 1908 trafen die frisch getrennten Geschwister beim Freundschaftsturniers Coppa Chiasso im Schweizer Chiasso aufeinander. Die Derby-Premiere entschied der Associazione Calcio Milan mit 2:1 für sich. Das erste Match in Mailand stieg am 10. Jänner 1909. Das Stadion Giuseppe Meazza, das die Fans aber lieber nach dem Stadtteil San Siro nennen, wurde 1926 errichtet und dient seither dem Derby della Madonnina als Spielstätte. Sie trägt den Namen eines der populärsten und erfolgreichsten Stürmer der nationalen Fußballgeschichte. Mit 284 Treffern ist Meazza Rekordtorschütze seines langjährigen Vereins Inter Mailand und liegt in der ewigen Bestenliste der Torschützen der Serie A mit 216 Toren neben José Altafini auf dem vierten Platz. Die Arena, die seit 1978 Meazzas Namen trägt, steht im Übrigen im Eigentum der beiden rivalisierenden Klubs, die es im Unterschied zu 1860 München und dem FC Bayern geschafft haben, ihr Haus gemeinsam zu bestellen. Aktuell fasst das Stadion San Siro rund 76.000 Zuschauer, und auch beim Derby della Madonnina am Mittwochabend (21 Uhr/ Servus-TV) wird das Oval bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt sein. Für die Stadtrivalen Inter und Milan geht es um nicht viel weniger als den Einzug ins Finale der Königsklasse. Und das will was heißen, wartet doch die italienische Fußballnation seit Inters Triumph im Jahr 2010 auf einen Champions-League-Sieg. Vor 13 Jahren setzten sich die Nerazzurri unter Jose Mourinho in ihrer Triple-Saison die europäische Krone auf. Marko Arnautovic konnte in seinem Jahr in Mailand zumindest eine knappe Stunde in der Liga mitwirken, in der Champions League kam der damals 21-Jährige nie zum Zug. Milan wartet noch länger auf eine Teilnahme in einem Champions-League-Finale. 2007 holten sich die Rossoneri letztmals den Titel. \"Wir werden alles rundherum genießen bis Mittwoch 20.59 Uhr, und dann müssen wir bereit sein. Wir müssen dieses Prickeln fühlen\", sagte Milans Trainer Stefano Pioli über die Stimmung in der Metropole. Das Euroderby wurde ausgerufen. \"Es ist nicht nur ein Derby, es ist DAS Derby\", hielt Inters Coach Simone Inzaghi fest. Er warnte vor zu viel Übermut: \"Was das Herz angeht, habe ich keine Zweifel. Was den Kopf angeht, wäre es gut, wenn wir ihn benutzen und uns erinnern, dass über 180 Minuten auf uns warten.\" Es ist das 236. Duell, in der Bilanz die Nase vorne hat derzeit Inter. Das Rückspiel steigt am 16. Mai erneut im San Siro. Schon jetzt ist fix, dass sich Italiens Fußball nach Jahren mit ausbleibenden Erfolgen wieder über einen Champions-League-Finalisten freuen darf. Juventus stand 2015 und 2017 im Endspiel, verlor gegen den FC Barcelona beziehungsweise Real Madrid aber beide. Eine Favoritenrolle lässt sich wiederum noch nicht ausmachen. In der Serie A ist Inter Vierter, AC Milan Fünfter und damit außerhalb der Startplätze für die kommende Champions League. Zwei Zähler trennen die beiden Nachbarn. Dreimal trafen die Klubs in dieser Saison aufeinander. Im Supercup siegte Inter in Saudi-Arabien mit 3:0, in der Liga gab es jeweils einen Erfolg von Milan sowie von Inter. Pioli und Inzaghi gaben jedenfalls an, sich nicht als Favorit zu fühlen. Das Mailänder Duell um das Finalticket der Königsklasse gab es bereits vor 20 Jahren. 2003 spielten Andrij Schewtschenko, Paolo Maldini oder Filippo Inzaghi für Milan, Inter bot Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti und Hernan Crespo auf. 0:0 und 1:1 endeten die Partien. Milan stieg dank Schewtschenkos Auswärtstor auf und holte im rein-italienischen Endspiel gegen Juventus im Elfmeterschießen den Titel. Zu einer inneritalienischen Angelegenheit wird das große Finale am 10. Juni in Istanbul nicht werden. Das zweite Finalticket matchen sich Real und Manchester City aus (nach Redaktionsschluss).","pubDate":"2023-05-09 15:28:34","image_url":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_cache/image/1xURJYMHxM6mbj4AbNIfUbRBez3yhI7mQgbAGMdMiT8lMpvXX9H8KQL-2RcfG6X9jn5xldgk87rhv6Yme4GxPfzB0506QqqzkCKIOdjLvXOpCzWHKWAeR0tj6IYA66RSbBrO1Y2LcACF1i9KJ3W_fGmzigPXGRqwvzy0sE_kv_L3SGtQqn57H0RwRZgZY_fdgaxGLhVJB7A6_kyN8ZdlEOH8--kVLxQB2D/230509_1733_948_0900_434789_italy_feature_heritage_achitecture.jpg","source_id":"wienerzeitung","category":["sports"],"country":["austria"],"language":"german"},{"title":"Lionel Messi Playing Club Football In Saudi Arabia Is Soon To Become Reality: Reports","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/lionel-messi-playing-club-football-in-saudi-arabia-is-soon-to-become-reality-reports/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Lionel Messi Playing Club Football In Saudi Arabia Is Soon To Become Reality: Reports Lionel Messi is currently employed with Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain and will leave the club at the end of the season.

Ever since his trip to the middle-east country was exposed, there have several rumours about the PSG forward shifting his base to the Asian country. Interestingly, Messi’s greatest rival Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr last year. For the unknown, Messi is the tourism ambassador of Saudi Arabia and visited the middle-east country with his family. However, following his suspension, the Argentine World Cup winner apologized to his club and teammates in a video.

Follow the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in our LIVE BLOG below! The former Barcelona player and manager was at odds with City’s defensive midfielder Rodri, who said the team were hungry for revenge against the record 14-time winners on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu. “It will be a huge mistake, we’re not here for revenge, just an opportunity,” Guardiola told a news conference. “Last season we did everything, more than everything to reach the final, but (in) football … it’s not enough.” MATCH CENTRE: Scores, stats and more! City have never lifted the trophy but Madrid have triumphed five times in the last nine seasons. Guardiola’s side beat Madrid 4-3 in the first leg last season and led by a goal in the return, until two late Rodrygo Goes strikes forced extra-time.

We’ve learnt from the past but I don’t like to talk about the past. “We’ve learnt a lot, it’s another year, another goal, with the hunger of having revenge.” Guardiola did agree with Rodri that City played well over both ties last season, despite their eventual elimination. “We had an exceptional first game in Manchester, we did a really good game here,” said Guardiola. “All we can do is congratulate them and move forward. One year later, we are here.” The coach said he thought his side would one day triumph in Europe, after disappointment in the 2021 final, where they were beaten by Chelsea. Guardiola praised his club’s stability, in contrast to other sides who triumph but then fall away in subsequent years. City have reached at least the last eight in each of the past six seasons. “One day we will reach the final and we will win it,” said Guardiola. “I wouldn’t like to win the Champions League and then go down and down and down. “Being stable is the most important things as a club, Madrid are an example.” Follow the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in our LIVE BLOG below!

On the contrary, Lionel Messi’s football career witnessed an abrupt end in Europe as he was suspended by PSG last week for his unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. He scored 31 goals in 71 appearances for the French champions and is expected to secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title later this month, however, he has failed in his mission to take PSG to a first Champions League win, facing back-to-back last-16 defeats. Barcelona had been eyeing to take the 35-year-old back to Camp Nou, where he won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League titles before an emotional departure in 2021. Though Saudi Arabia is alleged of diverting attention from its human rights record using sports, Riyadh will be able to boast of having arguably the two best football players of the modern era in their unheralded domestic league. Ronaldo is playing for Al Nassr, while a source close to the negotiations who told AFP that Messi’s move to Saudi Arabia was a “done deal”, stopped short of saying which club the Argentine will join. World Cup mission accomplished The absence of a World Cup winner’s medal had long been Exhibit A in the debate about why Messi was unable to go above Pele and Diego Maradona in football. But with Argentina’s triumph over France in last year’s nail-biting World Cup in Doha, the case surely reached its end. In his three decades football career, Messi won 37 club trophies, seven Ballon d’Or awards, and six European Golden Boots. There has been a Copa America title, an Olympic gold medal, and a list of scoring and statistical records that may never be beaten. In the Argentine forward’s World Cup appearance, he scored twice as Argentina battled to a 3-3 draw in extra time before taking a lead on penalties. Not even French forward Kylian Mbappe’s hat trick could upset Messi’s appointment with destiny on a night that seemed pre-ordained. Whether Messi really is the “greatest ever” is a question, of course, that is as futile as the answer is subjective.","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:10:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Not Virat Kohli, Sunny Leone Picks Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings As Favourites","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/not-virat-kohli-sunny-leone-picks-mahendra-singh-dhoni-chennai-super-kings-as-favourites/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Not Virat Kohli!

For his legions of admirers, the debate about Messi’s right to be regarded as the greatest footballer in history was officially put to bed when he led Argentina to the title in Qatar in December. But his career at the highest level in Europe appears to have finished on a low note. Messi was suspended by PSG last week for making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. He has scored 31 goals in 71 appearances for the French champions and is likely to win a second consecutive Ligue 1 title later this month, but failed in his mission to help PSG to a maiden Champions League triumph, suffering back-to-back last-16 defeats. Barcelona had been hopeful of bringing the 35-year-old back to the Camp Nou, where he won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns before a tearful departure in 2021. Instead though, Saudi Arabia, regularly accused of sportswashing, or hosting the biggest names in sport to deflect attention from its human rights record, will be able to boast having arguably the two greatest players of the modern era in their unheralded domestic league. Ronaldo is playing for Al Nassr, while a source close to the negotiations who told AFP that Messi’s move to Saudi Arabia was a “done deal”, stopped short of saying which club the Argentine will join. The absence of a World Cup winners’ medal had long been Exhibit A in the argument about why Messi did not rank above Pele and Diego Maradona in football’s pantheon. But with Argentina’s victory over France in last year’s jaw-dropping World Cup final in Doha, the case was surely closed. In a glittering career that has spanned three decades, Messi has won 37 club trophies, seven Ballon d’Or awards and six European Golden Boots. There has been a Copa America title, an Olympic gold medal and a list of scoring and statistical records that may never be beaten. In his final World Cup appearance, Messi scored twice as Argentina battled to a 3-3 draw in extra time before prevailing on penalties. Not even Kylian Mbappe’s hat-trick for France could upset Messi’s appointment with destiny on a night that seemed pre-ordained. Whether Messi really is the ‘greatest ever’ is a question, of course, that is as futile as the answer is subjective. What is undeniable though is that by sheer volume and range of silverware, Messi has won more than the other serious rivals to his “G.O.A.T” status: Pele and Maradona. While Pele’s three World Cup triumphs remain unrivalled, the Brazilian icon’s club career pales in comparison to Messi’s. In his peak years with Barcelona, the Argentinian regularly scaled the pinnacle of European club football in the Champions League – arguably a technically superior arena than international football. Maradona meanwhile won only one World Cup, and never lifted a European Cup during a club career in Europe remembered mostly for spells with Barcelona and Napoli. The counter-argument of course is that Pele and Maradona played in an era where players were offered far less protection than the likes of Messi and Ronaldo. Pele hobbled out of the 1966 World Cup after taking one brutal tackle too many; Maradona was also subjected to roughhouse treatment throughout his career. Maradona’s former international team-mate Jorge Burruchaga is reluctant to compare players across generations. Burruchaga, scorer of the winning goal – set up by Maradona – in the 1986 World Cup final victory over West Germany has said simply that Messi is the greatest player of his era. “Win or lose, Messi is not more or less than Maradona,” Burruchaga told AFP during the World Cup. “Messi is going to be in history whatever happens. “There are five players in the past 70 years who can be considered the best in the world – (Alfredo) Di Stefano, Johan Cruyff, Pele, Maradona and Messi.” The last name on that list is potentially leaving the European elite for good, but Messi is yet to end an international career that has already produced 102 goals in 174 matches. The Copa America in the United States next year could still provide a fitting swansong.","content":"For his legions of admirers, the debate about Messi’s right to be regarded as the greatest footballer in history was officially put to bed when he led Argentina to the title in Qatar in December.

After a string of fine performances, in which they played Atletico de Madrid U-17s (4-1), CD Leganes U-18s (0-2), Atletico de Madrid U-16s (2-1), and Real Madrid U-17s (3-3), the boys will now focus on the last two matches in Spain before heading to Germany for two more weeks. Head coach Bibiano Fernandes said, “The boys are motivated to work harder after the last few matches, especially after the result against Real Madrid, which has been very positive. However, the India U-17 head coach was quick to steer his boys away from any possible Icarus paradox. “The results in the last few matches have been quite promising, but we are also aware of the complacency which is the natural tendency of human behavior. We are playing all these matches to prepare for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup, which is our ultimate goal. “Of course, these matches have been great, but they can be a double-edged sword in that they could make the players complacent. The coaching staff has been working hard to condition the players mentally so that they maintain this consistency through to the Asian Cup,” said Fernandes. India’s game against Getafe U-18s will be a challenging one for the boys, especially in the physical aspect. “Of course, no game is easy at this level, and Getafe U-18s are a very good side. They are technically sound, and I believe they are also physically more imposing than us. But we also have our strong points, and will play accordingly,” he said. “We’ve got two more matches to go in Spain, and then we move on to Germany. The boys are progressing well, and hopefully, they will be at the proper level ahead of the Asian Cup,” he said. The Blue Colts have been training in Spain over the last few weeks as part of their preparation for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup, which is set to take place in Thailand next month. India, who have been placed in Group D of the Asian Cup, will face Vietnam (June 17), Uzbekistan (June 20), and Japan (June 23) in Pathum Thani and Bangkok. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:16:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Messi, Fraser-Pryce win top Laureus global sports awards","link":"https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/297405-messi-fraser-pryce-win-top-laureus-global-sports-awards","keywords":null,"creator":["Naharnet Newsdesk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi has won a top accolade as world Sportsman of the Year and picked up another award as a member of the team of the year following Argentina's World Cup soccer victory in 2022.

Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce finally broke through to win the Sportswoman of the Year award on her sixth nomination. Fraser-Pryce's 2022 exploits included winning the 100-meter gold at the World Athletics Championships for the fifth time. The Laureus Sports Awards honoring eight winners were held live in Paris on Monday night for the first time since 2020. It was Messi's second individual title after sharing that honor with Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton in 2020. Fraser-Pryce, who has won three Olympic and 10 world championship gold medals, called her award \"one of the greatest honors of my career.\" \"When athletes have the spotlight, it's important the example we set is the best it can be . . . we have a responsibility to influence the next generation in a positive way,\" she said. Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz's victory at the 2022 U.S. Open and his rise to the No. 1 ranking saw him take the Breakthrough of the Year award. Alcaraz, who celebrated his 20th birthday last week, won Sunday's final of the Madrid Open. Christian Eriksen was the recipient of the Comeback of the Year award after recovering from a cardiac arrest to return to Premier League football with Brentford and then Manchester United. The world Action Sportsperson of the Year went to American-born Chinese freestyler skier Eileen Gu, who was 18 during the Winter Olympics in Beijing. She became the first athlete to win three medals in freestyle skiing at a single Olympics — gold in both the halfpipe and big air events, and silver in slopestyle. Nominees for the Laureus awards are determined by international media and the winners are voted on by the 71 members of the Laureus World Sports Academy – athletes from the past 50 years.","pubDate":"2023-05-09 11:46:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"naharnet","category":["sports"],"country":["lebanon"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Madonnina wacht wieder","link":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/sport/fussball/2188059-Madonnina-wacht-wieder.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Inter Mailand gegen AC Milan, das ist Brutalität, möchte man in Abwandlung eines bekannten Qualtinger-Zitats meinen.

Wobei, so brutal wie in Kapfenberg und Simmering geht es im Derby della Madonnina wohl auch nicht zu, steht doch das Spiel zwischen den beiden Stadtklubs im Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seit jeher unter der Schirmherrschaft der Gottesmutter. Laut Volksmund wacht sie als goldene Statue auf einer Spitze des Mailänder Doms darüber, dass sich Spieler und Fans benehmen. Aber vielleicht sind sich Rossoneri und Nerazzurri gerade deshalb so spinnefeind, weil sie Zwillinge sind? Beide Vereine gingen aus demselben Klub hervor - dem 1899 gegründeten Milan Cricket and Football Club. Das lief einige Zeit gut, bis sich 1908 mehrere Mitglieder abspalteten und ihren eigenen Fußballverein - den Football Club Internazionale Milano - gründeten. Sie waren darüber verärgert, dass beim nationalistisch ausgerichteten Milan CFC nur Italiener spielen durften. Mit dem Zusatz Internazionale wollte man die Offenheit des Vereins für ausländische Spieler betonen. Real Madrid - Manchester City AC Milan - Inter Mailand Mi., 21 Uhr/Servus-TV Rückspiele am 16./17. Mai Heute freilich gehören Legionäre auf beiden Seiten zur Normalität. Das erste Duell zwischen Inter und Milan war im Übrigen eine der wenigen Partien, die nicht in Mailand stattfanden. Am 8. Oktober 1908 trafen die frisch getrennten Geschwister beim Freundschaftsturniers Coppa Chiasso im Schweizer Chiasso aufeinander. Die Derby-Premiere entschied der Associazione Calcio Milan mit 2:1 für sich. Das erste Match in Mailand stieg am 10. Jänner 1909. Das Stadion Giuseppe Meazza, das die Fans aber lieber nach dem Stadtteil San Siro nennen, wurde 1926 errichtet und dient seither dem Derby della Madonnina als Spielstätte. Sie trägt den Namen eines der populärsten und erfolgreichsten Stürmer der nationalen Fußballgeschichte. Mit 284 Treffern ist Meazza Rekordtorschütze seines langjährigen Vereins Inter Mailand und liegt in der ewigen Bestenliste der Torschützen der Serie A mit 216 Toren neben José Altafini auf dem vierten Platz. Die Arena, die seit 1978 Meazzas Namen trägt, steht im Übrigen im Eigentum der beiden rivalisierenden Klubs, die es im Unterschied zu 1860 München und dem FC Bayern geschafft haben, ihr Haus gemeinsam zu bestellen. Aktuell fasst das Stadion San Siro rund 76.000 Zuschauer, und auch beim Derby della Madonnina am Mittwochabend (21 Uhr/ Servus-TV) wird das Oval bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt sein. Für die Stadtrivalen Inter und Milan geht es um nicht viel weniger als den Einzug ins Finale der Königsklasse. Und das will was heißen, wartet doch die italienische Fußballnation seit Inters Triumph im Jahr 2010 auf einen Champions-League-Sieg. Vor 13 Jahren setzten sich die Nerazzurri unter Jose Mourinho in ihrer Triple-Saison die europäische Krone auf. Marko Arnautovic konnte in seinem Jahr in Mailand zumindest eine knappe Stunde in der Liga mitwirken, in der Champions League kam der damals 21-Jährige nie zum Zug. Milan wartet noch länger auf eine Teilnahme in einem Champions-League-Finale. 2007 holten sich die Rossoneri letztmals den Titel. \"Wir werden alles rundherum genießen bis Mittwoch 20.59 Uhr, und dann müssen wir bereit sein. Wir müssen dieses Prickeln fühlen\", sagte Milans Trainer Stefano Pioli über die Stimmung in der Metropole. Das Euroderby wurde ausgerufen. \"Es ist nicht nur ein Derby, es ist DAS Derby\", hielt Inters Coach Simone Inzaghi fest. Er warnte vor zu viel Übermut: \"Was das Herz angeht, habe ich keine Zweifel. Was den Kopf angeht, wäre es gut, wenn wir ihn benutzen und uns erinnern, dass über 180 Minuten auf uns warten.\" Es ist das 236. Duell, in der Bilanz die Nase vorne hat derzeit Inter. Das Rückspiel steigt am 16. Mai erneut im San Siro. Schon jetzt ist fix, dass sich Italiens Fußball nach Jahren mit ausbleibenden Erfolgen wieder über einen Champions-League-Finalisten freuen darf. Juventus stand 2015 und 2017 im Endspiel, verlor gegen den FC Barcelona beziehungsweise Real Madrid aber beide. Eine Favoritenrolle lässt sich wiederum noch nicht ausmachen. In der Serie A ist Inter Vierter, AC Milan Fünfter und damit außerhalb der Startplätze für die kommende Champions League. Zwei Zähler trennen die beiden Nachbarn. Dreimal trafen die Klubs in dieser Saison aufeinander. Im Supercup siegte Inter in Saudi-Arabien mit 3:0, in der Liga gab es jeweils einen Erfolg von Milan sowie von Inter. Pioli und Inzaghi gaben jedenfalls an, sich nicht als Favorit zu fühlen. Das Mailänder Duell um das Finalticket der Königsklasse gab es bereits vor 20 Jahren. 2003 spielten Andrij Schewtschenko, Paolo Maldini oder Filippo Inzaghi für Milan, Inter bot Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti und Hernan Crespo auf. 0:0 und 1:1 endeten die Partien. Milan stieg dank Schewtschenkos Auswärtstor auf und holte im rein-italienischen Endspiel gegen Juventus im Elfmeterschießen den Titel. Zu einer inneritalienischen Angelegenheit wird das große Finale am 10. Juni in Istanbul nicht werden. Das zweite Finalticket matchen sich Real und Manchester City aus (nach Redaktionsschluss).","pubDate":"2023-05-09 15:28:34","image_url":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_cache/image/1xURJYMHxM6mbj4AbNIfUbRBez3yhI7mQgbAGMdMiT8lMpvXX9H8KQL-2RcfG6X9jn5xldgk87rhv6Yme4GxPfzB0506QqqzkCKIOdjLvXOpCzWHKWAeR0tj6IYA66RSbBrO1Y2LcACF1i9KJ3W_fGmzigPXGRqwvzy0sE_kv_L3SGtQqn57H0RwRZgZY_fdgaxGLhVJB7A6_kyN8ZdlEOH8--kVLxQB2D/230509_1733_948_0900_434789_italy_feature_heritage_achitecture.jpg","source_id":"wienerzeitung","category":["sports"],"country":["austria"],"language":"german"},{"title":"Lionel Messi Playing Club Football In Saudi Arabia Is Soon To Become Reality: Reports","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/lionel-messi-playing-club-football-in-saudi-arabia-is-soon-to-become-reality-reports/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Lionel Messi Playing Club Football In Saudi Arabia Is Soon To Become Reality: Reports Lionel Messi is currently employed with Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain and will leave the club at the end of the season.

Ever since his trip to the middle-east country was exposed, there have several rumours about the PSG forward shifting his base to the Asian country. Interestingly, Messi’s greatest rival Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr last year. For the unknown, Messi is the tourism ambassador of Saudi Arabia and visited the middle-east country with his family. However, following his suspension, the Argentine World Cup winner apologized to his club and teammates in a video.

Follow the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in our LIVE BLOG below! The former Barcelona player and manager was at odds with City’s defensive midfielder Rodri, who said the team were hungry for revenge against the record 14-time winners on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu. “It will be a huge mistake, we’re not here for revenge, just an opportunity,” Guardiola told a news conference. “Last season we did everything, more than everything to reach the final, but (in) football … it’s not enough.” MATCH CENTRE: Scores, stats and more! City have never lifted the trophy but Madrid have triumphed five times in the last nine seasons. Guardiola’s side beat Madrid 4-3 in the first leg last season and led by a goal in the return, until two late Rodrygo Goes strikes forced extra-time.

We’ve learnt from the past but I don’t like to talk about the past. “We’ve learnt a lot, it’s another year, another goal, with the hunger of having revenge.” Guardiola did agree with Rodri that City played well over both ties last season, despite their eventual elimination. “We had an exceptional first game in Manchester, we did a really good game here,” said Guardiola. “All we can do is congratulate them and move forward. One year later, we are here.” The coach said he thought his side would one day triumph in Europe, after disappointment in the 2021 final, where they were beaten by Chelsea. Guardiola praised his club’s stability, in contrast to other sides who triumph but then fall away in subsequent years. City have reached at least the last eight in each of the past six seasons. “One day we will reach the final and we will win it,” said Guardiola. “I wouldn’t like to win the Champions League and then go down and down and down. “Being stable is the most important things as a club, Madrid are an example.” Follow the first leg of Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in our LIVE BLOG below!

He scored 31 goals in 71 appearances for the French champions and is expected to secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title later this month, however, he has failed in his mission to take PSG to a first Champions League win, facing back-to-back last-16 defeats. Barcelona had been eyeing to take the 35-year-old back to Camp Nou, where he won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League titles before an emotional departure in 2021. Though Saudi Arabia is alleged of diverting attention from its human rights record using sports, Riyadh will be able to boast of having arguably the two best football players of the modern era in their unheralded domestic league. Ronaldo is playing for Al Nassr, while a source close to the negotiations who told AFP that Messi’s move to Saudi Arabia was a “done deal”, stopped short of saying which club the Argentine will join. World Cup mission accomplished The absence of a World Cup winner’s medal had long been Exhibit A in the debate about why Messi was unable to go above Pele and Diego Maradona in football. But with Argentina’s triumph over France in last year’s nail-biting World Cup in Doha, the case surely reached its end. In his three decades football career, Messi won 37 club trophies, seven Ballon d’Or awards, and six European Golden Boots. There has been a Copa America title, an Olympic gold medal, and a list of scoring and statistical records that may never be beaten. In the Argentine forward’s World Cup appearance, he scored twice as Argentina battled to a 3-3 draw in extra time before taking a lead on penalties. Not even French forward Kylian Mbappe’s hat trick could upset Messi’s appointment with destiny on a night that seemed pre-ordained. Whether Messi really is the “greatest ever” is a question, of course, that is as futile as the answer is subjective.","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:10:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Not Virat Kohli, Sunny Leone Picks Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings As Favourites","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/not-virat-kohli-sunny-leone-picks-mahendra-singh-dhoni-chennai-super-kings-as-favourites/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Not Virat Kohli!

For his legions of admirers, the debate about Messi’s right to be regarded as the greatest footballer in history was officially put to bed when he led Argentina to the title in Qatar in December. But his career at the highest level in Europe appears to have finished on a low note. Messi was suspended by PSG last week for making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. He has scored 31 goals in 71 appearances for the French champions and is likely to win a second consecutive Ligue 1 title later this month, but failed in his mission to help PSG to a maiden Champions League triumph, suffering back-to-back last-16 defeats. Barcelona had been hopeful of bringing the 35-year-old back to the Camp Nou, where he won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns before a tearful departure in 2021. Instead though, Saudi Arabia, regularly accused of sportswashing, or hosting the biggest names in sport to deflect attention from its human rights record, will be able to boast having arguably the two greatest players of the modern era in their unheralded domestic league. Ronaldo is playing for Al Nassr, while a source close to the negotiations who told AFP that Messi’s move to Saudi Arabia was a “done deal”, stopped short of saying which club the Argentine will join. The absence of a World Cup winners’ medal had long been Exhibit A in the argument about why Messi did not rank above Pele and Diego Maradona in football’s pantheon. But with Argentina’s victory over France in last year’s jaw-dropping World Cup final in Doha, the case was surely closed. In a glittering career that has spanned three decades, Messi has won 37 club trophies, seven Ballon d’Or awards and six European Golden Boots. There has been a Copa America title, an Olympic gold medal and a list of scoring and statistical records that may never be beaten. In his final World Cup appearance, Messi scored twice as Argentina battled to a 3-3 draw in extra time before prevailing on penalties. Not even Kylian Mbappe’s hat-trick for France could upset Messi’s appointment with destiny on a night that seemed pre-ordained. Whether Messi really is the ‘greatest ever’ is a question, of course, that is as futile as the answer is subjective. What is undeniable though is that by sheer volume and range of silverware, Messi has won more than the other serious rivals to his “G.O.A.T” status: Pele and Maradona. While Pele’s three World Cup triumphs remain unrivalled, the Brazilian icon’s club career pales in comparison to Messi’s. In his peak years with Barcelona, the Argentinian regularly scaled the pinnacle of European club football in the Champions League – arguably a technically superior arena than international football. Maradona meanwhile won only one World Cup, and never lifted a European Cup during a club career in Europe remembered mostly for spells with Barcelona and Napoli. The counter-argument of course is that Pele and Maradona played in an era where players were offered far less protection than the likes of Messi and Ronaldo. Pele hobbled out of the 1966 World Cup after taking one brutal tackle too many; Maradona was also subjected to roughhouse treatment throughout his career. Maradona’s former international team-mate Jorge Burruchaga is reluctant to compare players across generations. Burruchaga, scorer of the winning goal – set up by Maradona – in the 1986 World Cup final victory over West Germany has said simply that Messi is the greatest player of his era. “Win or lose, Messi is not more or less than Maradona,” Burruchaga told AFP during the World Cup. “Messi is going to be in history whatever happens. “There are five players in the past 70 years who can be considered the best in the world – (Alfredo) Di Stefano, Johan Cruyff, Pele, Maradona and Messi.” The last name on that list is potentially leaving the European elite for good, but Messi is yet to end an international career that has already produced 102 goals in 174 matches. The Copa America in the United States next year could still provide a fitting swansong.","content":"For his legions of admirers, the debate about Messi’s right to be regarded as the greatest footballer in history was officially put to bed when he led Argentina to the title in Qatar in December.

After a string of fine performances, in which they played Atletico de Madrid U-17s (4-1), CD Leganes U-18s (0-2), Atletico de Madrid U-16s (2-1), and Real Madrid U-17s (3-3), the boys will now focus on the last two matches in Spain before heading to Germany for two more weeks. Head coach Bibiano Fernandes said, “The boys are motivated to work harder after the last few matches, especially after the result against Real Madrid, which has been very positive. However, the India U-17 head coach was quick to steer his boys away from any possible Icarus paradox. “The results in the last few matches have been quite promising, but we are also aware of the complacency which is the natural tendency of human behavior. We are playing all these matches to prepare for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup, which is our ultimate goal. “Of course, these matches have been great, but they can be a double-edged sword in that they could make the players complacent. The coaching staff has been working hard to condition the players mentally so that they maintain this consistency through to the Asian Cup,” said Fernandes. India’s game against Getafe U-18s will be a challenging one for the boys, especially in the physical aspect. “Of course, no game is easy at this level, and Getafe U-18s are a very good side. They are technically sound, and I believe they are also physically more imposing than us. But we also have our strong points, and will play accordingly,” he said. “We’ve got two more matches to go in Spain, and then we move on to Germany. The boys are progressing well, and hopefully, they will be at the proper level ahead of the Asian Cup,” he said. The Blue Colts have been training in Spain over the last few weeks as part of their preparation for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup, which is set to take place in Thailand next month. India, who have been placed in Group D of the Asian Cup, will face Vietnam (June 17), Uzbekistan (June 20), and Japan (June 23) in Pathum Thani and Bangkok. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:16:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Messi, Fraser-Pryce win top Laureus global sports awards","link":"https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/297405-messi-fraser-pryce-win-top-laureus-global-sports-awards","keywords":null,"creator":["Naharnet Newsdesk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi has won a top accolade as world Sportsman of the Year and picked up another award as a member of the team of the year following Argentina's World Cup soccer victory in 2022.

Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce finally broke through to win the Sportswoman of the Year award on her sixth nomination. Fraser-Pryce's 2022 exploits included winning the 100-meter gold at the World Athletics Championships for the fifth time. The Laureus Sports Awards honoring eight winners were held live in Paris on Monday night for the first time since 2020. It was Messi's second individual title after sharing that honor with Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton in 2020. Fraser-Pryce, who has won three Olympic and 10 world championship gold medals, called her award \"one of the greatest honors of my career.\" \"When athletes have the spotlight, it's important the example we set is the best it can be . . . we have a responsibility to influence the next generation in a positive way,\" she said. Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz's victory at the 2022 U.S. Open and his rise to the No. 1 ranking saw him take the Breakthrough of the Year award. Alcaraz, who celebrated his 20th birthday last week, won Sunday's final of the Madrid Open. Christian Eriksen was the recipient of the Comeback of the Year award after recovering from a cardiac arrest to return to Premier League football with Brentford and then Manchester United. The world Action Sportsperson of the Year went to American-born Chinese freestyler skier Eileen Gu, who was 18 during the Winter Olympics in Beijing. She became the first athlete to win three medals in freestyle skiing at a single Olympics — gold in both the halfpipe and big air events, and silver in slopestyle. Nominees for the Laureus awards are determined by international media and the winners are voted on by the 71 members of the Laureus World Sports Academy – athletes from the past 50 years.","pubDate":"2023-05-09 11:46:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"naharnet","category":["sports"],"country":["lebanon"],"language":"english"}]}
