The 51-year-old will send his team into Euro 2024 qualifier battle with European minnows Gibraltar in the Algarve on Monday evening knowing their automatic qualification hopes are already over, and that even the chance of a wild card via the play-offs may be out of their grasp. Just how different things could have been had his last visit to the Estadio Algarve, for a World Cup qualifier against Portugal in September 2021, not ended with a last-gasp Cristiano Ronaldo double which transformed a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 victory for the hosts ‚Äì and established Ronaldo as international football‚Äôs leading scorer ‚Äì is something upon which Kenny admits he has reflected since. Kenny said: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt dwell on things, but have I reflected on it? Of course. ‚ÄúWe were 1-0 ahead after 89 minutes and the game should be finished out. Cristiano Ronaldo has other ideas and the world record was on the line that night, so he was hugely motivated to break that. ‚ÄúIt was a very good performance that night. VAR intervened for an absolute cast-iron penalty to go 2-0 up in the second half, nailed-on penalty. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it goes. What ifs‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no point in complaining. You move on and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù Ireland ultimately did not make it to last year‚Äôs World Cup finals, and neither will they be in Germany next summer unless their fortunes change markedly and they manage to secure a play-off spot and make it count. There is even a complicated scenario in which they might be better off losing their final qualifier in the Netherlands next month depending on results elsewhere, although Kenny insists he is not even contemplating that. He said: ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs really entered our heads. It‚Äôs not something that really we‚Äôd focus on. If we were to play any game, we‚Äôd play to win, any international game. ‚ÄúWe would just focus on Gibraltar tomorrow. It‚Äôs an international game that we want to win. We have to get a win under our belt tomorrow and I‚Äôm not really fixated on that scenario.‚Äù Kenny, who confirmed that his contract would cover any play-off, has found himself in the firing line since Friday night‚Äôs 2-0 home defeat by Greece, although with World Cup finalists France and the Dutch also in Group B, the alarm bells starting ringing after their 2-1 reverse in Athens in June. However, asked if he would resign should things go from bad to worse in Faro, he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not considering resigning. My contact is to the end of the campaign and I will finish it. ‚ÄúWe want to finish the campaign strongly and we are very determined to do that. After that, it‚Äôs completely out of my control.

Harry Wilson, winning his 50th cap, scored twice as Wales climbed above the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists in to second place in Group D. The two teams are tied on 10 points, six behind group leaders Turkey who secured qualification by beating Latvia 4-0 on Sunday. Wales are second by virtue of having a better head-to-head record against Croatia after also drawing 1-1 with them in Split in March. Wales‚Äô win over Croatia, ranked sixth in the world and 27 places above the Dragons, came after pre-match reports that manager Page‚Äôs job could be in jeopardy. Football Association of Wales chief executive Noel Mooney had said earlier in the week that a ‚Äúserious review‚Äù would take place on Page‚Äôs position following the final group games against Armenia and Turkey next month.

The 51-year-old will send his team into Euro 2024 qualifier battle with European minnows Gibraltar in the Algarve on Monday evening knowing their automatic qualification hopes are already over, and that even the chance of a wild card via the play-offs may be out of their grasp. Just how different things could have been had his last visit to the Estadio Algarve, for a World Cup qualifier against Portugal in September 2021, not ended with a last-gasp Cristiano Ronaldo double which transformed a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 victory for the hosts ‚Äì and established Ronaldo as international football‚Äôs leading scorer ‚Äì is something upon which Kenny admits he has reflected since. Kenny said: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt dwell on things, but have I reflected on it? Of course. ‚ÄúWe were 1-0 ahead after 89 minutes and the game should be finished out. Cristiano Ronaldo has other ideas and the world record was on the line that night, so he was hugely motivated to break that. ‚ÄúIt was a very good performance that night. VAR intervened for an absolute cast-iron penalty to go 2-0 up in the second half, nailed-on penalty. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it goes. What ifs‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no point in complaining. You move on and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù Ireland ultimately did not make it to last year‚Äôs World Cup finals, and neither will they be in Germany next summer unless their fortunes change markedly and they manage to secure a play-off spot and make it count. There is even a complicated scenario in which they might be better off losing their final qualifier in the Netherlands next month depending on results elsewhere, although Kenny insists he is not even contemplating that. He said: ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs really entered our heads. It‚Äôs not something that really we‚Äôd focus on. If we were to play any game, we‚Äôd play to win, any international game. ‚ÄúWe would just focus on Gibraltar tomorrow. It‚Äôs an international game that we want to win. We have to get a win under our belt tomorrow and I‚Äôm not really fixated on that scenario.‚Äù Kenny, who confirmed that his contract would cover any play-off, has found himself in the firing line since Friday night‚Äôs 2-0 home defeat by Greece, although with World Cup finalists France and the Dutch also in Group B, the alarm bells starting ringing after their 2-1 reverse in Athens in June. However, asked if he would resign should things go from bad to worse in Faro, he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not considering resigning. My contact is to the end of the campaign and I will finish it. ‚ÄúWe want to finish the campaign strongly and we are very determined to do that. After that, it‚Äôs completely out of my control.
