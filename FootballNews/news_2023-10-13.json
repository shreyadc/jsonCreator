Vilda led Spain to Women's glory with an upset victory over England in the final before during the fallout of the Luis Rubiales scandal in which the former Royal Spanish Football Federation president on the lips. Vilda has been appointed manager of Morocco women after they reached the round of 16 at the summer tournament, replacing Reynald Pedros. The Moroccan football federation said in a statement while thanking his predecessor: \"The Royal Moroccan Football Federation contracted the Spanish coach Mr Vilda to coach the women's national football team in the next stage.\" Vilda spent five years working with Spain women's youth sides before stepping into the senior role back in 2015 - lasting eight years in the role. The playing squad had insisted that they wouldn't play until his colleague Rubiales was removed from his position, with boss Xavi and the men's team captain Alvaro Morata both condemning his actions. Vilda was at the centre of a dispute with Spanish players back in 2022 as 15 players boycotted the national side. They expressed concerns at his coaching style following a poor Euro 2022, as well as his treatment of players. Only three of those players returned to the fold before the World Cup, with the federation removing him from his post while seeking a fresh start. Former Barcelona midfielder and assistant coach Montse Tome has since been given the senior role, having worked with Vilda since 2018. The federation said: \"Those actions do not reflect at all the values of the whole Spanish society, its institutions, its representatives, its athletes and the leaders of Spanish sport. Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C £22 a month \"The RFEF wants to convey to the whole of society and to the whole of world football its deepest regret for what has happened, which has tarnished our national team, our football and our society.\" It added: \"We are sorry that this incident has disrupted what should have been an ongoing celebration of football both for our national team and that of England's Lionesses, who were a truly remarkable rival in a thrilling final.\" Attention for Vilda will turn to the 2024 Olympic Games as well as the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations, which will again be hosted by Morocco as it was in 2022.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:54:41","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31178389.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_Spain-v-Sweden-Semi-Final-FIFA-Womens-World-Cup-Australia-New-Zealand-2023.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3684e25ee32272a996731eb70a0cc008","title":"FA criticised over decision not to light up Wembley arch in Israel flag colours","link":"https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/sport/national/23852935.fa-criticised-decision-not-light-wembley-arch-israel-flag-colours/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The British Government had written to UK sports bodies encouraging them to mark events in Israel appropriately.","content":"The Football Association has been criticised for the “extremely disappointing” and “mind-blowing” decision not to light up the Wembley arch in the colours of the Israeli flag before Friday’s friendly between England and Australia.

The Exiles currently have three members of their squad that earned a shot in the Football League thanks to their exploits in the Welsh game – forward Will Evans and midfielders James Waite and Nathan Wood. Versatile former Cardiff Met and Bala man Evans is League Two’s joint top scorer after having a stunning start to his second season at Rodney Parade. Waite, who came through Cardiff City’s academy, earned a shot at County thanks to his performances with Penybont and has made 71 appearances for the club since signing in January, 2022. Wood was released by County as a youngster but also shone with Penybont to get an opportunity with the Exiles and scored his first goal for the club on his first start in the 2-0 EFL Trophy win at Cheltenham on Tuesday. County also had success with ex-Connahs Quay central defender Priestley Farquharson, who is now with League Two rivals Walsall, and are looking for future Cymru Premier prospects. “Normally when you come across the lads who have had a setback and are going again they have that hunger and desire,” said manager Graham Coughlan. “The Cymru Premier is an important league and scouting tool for us; we do get out and watch games, and it has proved to be very important for us. “We can’t compete on an even playing field with a lot of other clubs [in the Football League] so we have to think outside the box. “The Welsh market is right on our doorstep so naturally we are going to explore that and we have boots on the ground to attend games and we get a lot of feedback. “The pre-season games and the one we had at Merthyr build relationships and having players in to have a look at over the course of the season is important as well. “It’s a great market and a really competitive league that I enjoy going to watch.” County have also sent young defender Harrison Bright out to get game time with Barry Town United in the Cymru Premier.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:05:07","image_url":"https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/17327521/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesargus","source_priority":284631,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7955571028118b199dff06bd3d98a2ad","title":"Visa Signs With CAF As Official Payment Partner For AFCON Tournaments Until 2026","link":"https://www.completesports.com/visa-signs-with-caf-as-official-payment-partner-for-afcon-tournaments-until-2026/","keywords":["World Football","2023 AFCON","CAF","Côte d’Ivoire","Patrice Motsepe","Visa"],"creator":["James Agberebi"],"video_url":null,"description":"Visa has announced the renewal of its partnership with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) until 2026, which establishes Visa as the exclusive digital payment provider for the upcoming 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament in Cote d’Ivoire.

England and Australia players will wear black armbands during their friendly match on Friday night, with a moment of silence also observed before kick-off. In a statement, the FA said it will \"remember the innocent victims of the devastating events in Israel and Palestine\". \"Our thoughts are with them, and their families and friends in England and Australia and with all the communities who are affected by this ongoing conflict. \"We stand for humanity and an end to the death, violence, fear and suffering.\" However, the decision has been questioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the largest and second oldest Jewish communal organisation in the UK. In a statement, the organisation, also known as the Board of Deputies, made reference to the Bataclan massacre, when 90 people were murdered at a nightclub during the Paris attacks in November 2015. In response, the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, was played at every Premier League stadium the following weekend. The Jewish organisation said on Thursday: \"When hundreds of innocent Israelis were murdered, raped and kidnapped in a coordinated terrorist campaign, unequalled since 9/11, the FA's response is 'to remember the victims of the conflicts in Israel and Palestine' and the Wembley arches will not be illuminated in blue and white. \"This weak response brings no credit to the FA.\" The Chelsea Jewish Supporters' Group described the response as \"spineless\" in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said she was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision and added she had \"made my views clear to the FA\". \"It is especially disappointing in light of the FA's bold stance on other terrorist attacks in the recent past,\" she wrote on X. \"Words and actions matter. The government is clear: we stand with Israel.\" The FA said it will only allow flags and kits of competing nations inside Wembley during England's game against Australia on Friday, and the Three Lions' European Qualifier against Italy on Tuesday. It will also promote a Red Cross emergency appeal to support people affected by the humanitarian crisis in the region in the stadium. Over the years, the Wembley arch has been illuminated in the colours of the flags of countries, including France, Turkey and Ukraine, within days of attacks. There are clear sensitivities - with some wanting Palestinian deaths acknowledged. The president of the FA - Prince William - has commented on the situation in a joint statement with his wife through a Kensington Palace spokesperson. \"As Israel exercises its right to self-defence, all Israelis and Palestinians will be continued to be stalked by grief, fear and anger in the time to come,\" it said. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had earlier joined calls for the Wembley arch to be lit up in blue and white on Friday, telling Sky News \"we should make clear our strong support for Israel\". \"We stand with Israel, and I think we've seen that with parliament, we've seen it with Number 10,\" he said. \"I think it would be fitting to show that with Wembley as well.\" Asked what sympathy he has with the people of Gaza, he said the UK \"does have sympathy\" and contributes \"about 10%\" of the aid distributed in the region through the United Nations. \"It's why the foreign secretary was in Israel yesterday talking to counterparts about the importance of minimising civilian casualties,\" he added. Latest figures from the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) show at least 1,300 Israelis have died and more than 2,700 injured since Hamas's surprise attack on Saturday. The Gaza Health Ministry, meanwhile, reports at least 1,354 Palestinians have died and 6,049 injured in Israeli strikes. England boss Gareth Southgate has backed the FA's stance, saying at his press conference ahead of the Three Lions' clash with Australia on Friday: \"Firstly, it's incredibly harrowing pictures. My thoughts and feelings are with everyone who has suffered, lost relatives and friends in these attacks. \"It's incredibly disturbing to see. On a broader scale, in my lifetime, it's one of the most complex situations in the world and everyone is grappling with how best to deal with that. \"I don't know how to walk in the shoes of those on either side of that conflict. The FA have tried to deal with it, I've not been involved in those discussions. They've decided to take the stance they have, and I'm happy to go along with that.\" Premier League players, managers and match officials will wear black armbands and observe a moment's silence at the fixtures taking place on the weekend of October 21-23, and so will clubs at EFL fixtures this weekend. Tottenham also tweeted: \"The club and our footballing family is shocked and saddened by the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza, and strongly condemns the horrific and brutal acts of violence against innocent civilians. \"Our heartfelt sympathies are with the victims, their families and the communities impacted. We shall join our fellow clubs in wearing black armbands and observing a minute's silence during our next Premier League fixture with Fulham as a mark of respect.

England have repeatedly been second best to the Aussies in and , but football was supposed to be the banker, the guarantee, the sport where yellow and green will never stand above the crisp white shirts of the Three Lions. Unfortunately, goals from Tony Popovic and Harry Kewell saw the Aussies take a shock 2-0 lead before half-time. Eriksson hauled the entire starting XI off and sent on a new team of England players, featuring a debuting , to clean up the mess overseen by the previous cohort - then a bouldering naked man appeared. A beaming streaker burst onto the pitch, slalomed through security guards and officials and charged towards the England players whose sense of humour was not at its highest. It was a cold, damp and foggy day, yet the naked gentleman was not phased by the bone-chilling elements. Commentator at the time Gary Bloom said: “Just out of your picture, a rather foolish man has run onto the pitch; with absolutely no clothes on at all.” Fortunately for all those in East London, he was wearing some tiny England budgie-smugglers As well as the Champions League, TNT Sports will also be offering sports fans access to games across the Premier League, Europa League, Serie A and much more.

His canter on the Upton Park turf was soon ended when stewards eventually got a hold of him. They combined forces to carry the hefty nude man off the side of the pitch. Streaking, particularly with “absolutely no clothes on” should never be condoned. However, considering the derelict performance on display, there was an argument to suggest he was the most mobile Englishman on the pitch. If heatmaps were around in 2003, fans would have been eager to have seen the distance he covered. Things did not get any better for England as Aussie star Brett Emerton ended any hopes of a comeback by scoring Australia’s third in the 84th minute. The streaker may have been the naked man on the field, but it was the Three Lions who were greatly exposed by the Australians. Gareth Southgate will be hoping for a well-executed and well-clothed performance from his players and spectators when England host Australia at Wembley Stadium.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31161477.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_A-naked-England-fan-gets-carried-off-of-the-pitch.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4d17cb91e32ff56b62b6fd9502653e06","title":"Spain Women's controversial World Cup-winning manager gets new job in football","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/spain-women-manager-jorge-vilda-31178414","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Controversial coach Jorge Vilda is back in management having been sacked by Spain less than a month after leading them to Women's World Cup glory","content":"Controversial coach Jorge Vilda is back in a job - as manager of Spain's rivals Morocco.

Vilda has been appointed manager of Morocco women after they reached the round of 16 at the summer tournament, replacing Reynald Pedros. The Moroccan football federation said in a statement while thanking his predecessor: \"The Royal Moroccan Football Federation contracted the Spanish coach Mr Vilda to coach the women's national football team in the next stage.\" Vilda spent five years working with Spain women's youth sides before stepping into the senior role back in 2015 - lasting eight years in the role. The playing squad had insisted that they wouldn't play until his colleague Rubiales was removed from his position, with boss Xavi and the men's team captain Alvaro Morata both condemning his actions. Vilda was at the centre of a dispute with Spanish players back in 2022 as 15 players boycotted the national side. They expressed concerns at his coaching style following a poor Euro 2022, as well as his treatment of players. Only three of those players returned to the fold before the World Cup, with the federation removing him from his post while seeking a fresh start. Former Barcelona midfielder and assistant coach Montse Tome has since been given the senior role, having worked with Vilda since 2018.

Moeen then put up a new post, without the flag but containing the same Malcolm X quote: “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” The International Olympic Committee said its executive board members had “expressed their very strong feelings over these tragic events in the recent days” at the start of Thursday’s meeting in Mumbai and “express their deepest sympathy with the innocent victims of this terrible violence”.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:35:49","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/16598689/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bcf060200f8953e2262698bdd6df4a27","title":"Fußball-WM 2026 in USA, Mexiko und Kanada: alle Stadien und Austragungsorte","link":"https://www.haz.de/sport/fussball-wm-2026-in-usa-mexiko-und-kanada-alle-stadien-und-austragungsorte-7Y4XGIAOIFDWDEL25ES2DBN4CE.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Sportredaktion RND"],"video_url":null,"description":"Die deutsche Nationalmannschaft reist derzeit durch die USA und spielt gegen zwei der drei Gastgeber der WM 2026, die in den USA, Mexiko und Kanada stattfinden wird.

The Exiles currently have three members of their squad that earned a shot in the Football League thanks to their exploits in the Welsh game – forward Will Evans and midfielders James Waite and Nathan Wood. Versatile former Cardiff Met and Bala man Evans is League Two’s joint top scorer after having a stunning start to his second season at Rodney Parade. Waite, who came through Cardiff City’s academy, earned a shot at County thanks to his performances with Penybont and has made 71 appearances for the club since signing in January, 2022. Wood was released by County as a youngster but also shone with Penybont to get an opportunity with the Exiles and scored his first goal for the club on his first start in the 2-0 EFL Trophy win at Cheltenham on Tuesday. County also had success with ex-Connahs Quay central defender Priestley Farquharson, who is now with League Two rivals Walsall, and are looking for future Cymru Premier prospects. “Normally when you come across the lads who have had a setback and are going again they have that hunger and desire,” said manager Graham Coughlan. “The Cymru Premier is an important league and scouting tool for us; we do get out and watch games, and it has proved to be very important for us. “We can’t compete on an even playing field with a lot of other clubs [in the Football League] so we have to think outside the box. “The Welsh market is right on our doorstep so naturally we are going to explore that and we have boots on the ground to attend games and we get a lot of feedback. “The pre-season games and the one we had at Merthyr build relationships and having players in to have a look at over the course of the season is important as well. “It’s a great market and a really competitive league that I enjoy going to watch.” County have also sent young defender Harrison Bright out to get game time with Barry Town United in the Cymru Premier.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:05:07","image_url":"https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/17327521/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesargus","source_priority":284631,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7955571028118b199dff06bd3d98a2ad","title":"Visa Signs With CAF As Official Payment Partner For AFCON Tournaments Until 2026","link":"https://www.completesports.com/visa-signs-with-caf-as-official-payment-partner-for-afcon-tournaments-until-2026/","keywords":["World Football","2023 AFCON","CAF","Côte d’Ivoire","Patrice Motsepe","Visa"],"creator":["James Agberebi"],"video_url":null,"description":"Visa has announced the renewal of its partnership with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) until 2026, which establishes Visa as the exclusive digital payment provider for the upcoming 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament in Cote d’Ivoire.

England and Australia players will wear black armbands during their friendly match on Friday night, with a moment of silence also observed before kick-off. In a statement, the FA said it will \"remember the innocent victims of the devastating events in Israel and Palestine\". \"Our thoughts are with them, and their families and friends in England and Australia and with all the communities who are affected by this ongoing conflict. \"We stand for humanity and an end to the death, violence, fear and suffering.\" However, the decision has been questioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the largest and second oldest Jewish communal organisation in the UK. In a statement, the organisation, also known as the Board of Deputies, made reference to the Bataclan massacre, when 90 people were murdered at a nightclub during the Paris attacks in November 2015. In response, the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, was played at every Premier League stadium the following weekend. The Jewish organisation said on Thursday: \"When hundreds of innocent Israelis were murdered, raped and kidnapped in a coordinated terrorist campaign, unequalled since 9/11, the FA's response is 'to remember the victims of the conflicts in Israel and Palestine' and the Wembley arches will not be illuminated in blue and white. \"This weak response brings no credit to the FA.\" The Chelsea Jewish Supporters' Group described the response as \"spineless\" in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said she was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision and added she had \"made my views clear to the FA\". \"It is especially disappointing in light of the FA's bold stance on other terrorist attacks in the recent past,\" she wrote on X. \"Words and actions matter. The government is clear: we stand with Israel.\" The FA said it will only allow flags and kits of competing nations inside Wembley during England's game against Australia on Friday, and the Three Lions' European Qualifier against Italy on Tuesday. It will also promote a Red Cross emergency appeal to support people affected by the humanitarian crisis in the region in the stadium. Over the years, the Wembley arch has been illuminated in the colours of the flags of countries, including France, Turkey and Ukraine, within days of attacks. There are clear sensitivities - with some wanting Palestinian deaths acknowledged. The president of the FA - Prince William - has commented on the situation in a joint statement with his wife through a Kensington Palace spokesperson. \"As Israel exercises its right to self-defence, all Israelis and Palestinians will be continued to be stalked by grief, fear and anger in the time to come,\" it said. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had earlier joined calls for the Wembley arch to be lit up in blue and white on Friday, telling Sky News \"we should make clear our strong support for Israel\". \"We stand with Israel, and I think we've seen that with parliament, we've seen it with Number 10,\" he said. \"I think it would be fitting to show that with Wembley as well.\" Asked what sympathy he has with the people of Gaza, he said the UK \"does have sympathy\" and contributes \"about 10%\" of the aid distributed in the region through the United Nations. \"It's why the foreign secretary was in Israel yesterday talking to counterparts about the importance of minimising civilian casualties,\" he added. Latest figures from the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) show at least 1,300 Israelis have died and more than 2,700 injured since Hamas's surprise attack on Saturday. The Gaza Health Ministry, meanwhile, reports at least 1,354 Palestinians have died and 6,049 injured in Israeli strikes. England boss Gareth Southgate has backed the FA's stance, saying at his press conference ahead of the Three Lions' clash with Australia on Friday: \"Firstly, it's incredibly harrowing pictures. My thoughts and feelings are with everyone who has suffered, lost relatives and friends in these attacks. \"It's incredibly disturbing to see. On a broader scale, in my lifetime, it's one of the most complex situations in the world and everyone is grappling with how best to deal with that. \"I don't know how to walk in the shoes of those on either side of that conflict. The FA have tried to deal with it, I've not been involved in those discussions. They've decided to take the stance they have, and I'm happy to go along with that.\" Premier League players, managers and match officials will wear black armbands and observe a moment's silence at the fixtures taking place on the weekend of October 21-23, and so will clubs at EFL fixtures this weekend. Tottenham also tweeted: \"The club and our footballing family is shocked and saddened by the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza, and strongly condemns the horrific and brutal acts of violence against innocent civilians. \"Our heartfelt sympathies are with the victims, their families and the communities impacted. We shall join our fellow clubs in wearing black armbands and observing a minute's silence during our next Premier League fixture with Fulham as a mark of respect.

England have repeatedly been second best to the Aussies in and , but football was supposed to be the banker, the guarantee, the sport where yellow and green will never stand above the crisp white shirts of the Three Lions. Unfortunately, goals from Tony Popovic and Harry Kewell saw the Aussies take a shock 2-0 lead before half-time. Eriksson hauled the entire starting XI off and sent on a new team of England players, featuring a debuting , to clean up the mess overseen by the previous cohort - then a bouldering naked man appeared. A beaming streaker burst onto the pitch, slalomed through security guards and officials and charged towards the England players whose sense of humour was not at its highest. It was a cold, damp and foggy day, yet the naked gentleman was not phased by the bone-chilling elements. Commentator at the time Gary Bloom said: “Just out of your picture, a rather foolish man has run onto the pitch; with absolutely no clothes on at all.” Fortunately for all those in East London, he was wearing some tiny England budgie-smugglers As well as the Champions League, TNT Sports will also be offering sports fans access to games across the Premier League, Europa League, Serie A and much more.

His canter on the Upton Park turf was soon ended when stewards eventually got a hold of him. They combined forces to carry the hefty nude man off the side of the pitch. Streaking, particularly with “absolutely no clothes on” should never be condoned. However, considering the derelict performance on display, there was an argument to suggest he was the most mobile Englishman on the pitch. If heatmaps were around in 2003, fans would have been eager to have seen the distance he covered. Things did not get any better for England as Aussie star Brett Emerton ended any hopes of a comeback by scoring Australia’s third in the 84th minute. The streaker may have been the naked man on the field, but it was the Three Lions who were greatly exposed by the Australians.

Vilda has been appointed manager of Morocco women after they reached the round of 16 at the summer tournament, replacing Reynald Pedros. The Moroccan football federation said in a statement while thanking his predecessor: \"The Royal Moroccan Football Federation contracted the Spanish coach Mr Vilda to coach the women's national football team in the next stage.\" Vilda spent five years working with Spain women's youth sides before stepping into the senior role back in 2015 - lasting eight years in the role. The playing squad had insisted that they wouldn't play until his colleague Rubiales was removed from his position, with boss Xavi and the men's team captain Alvaro Morata both condemning his actions. Vilda was at the centre of a dispute with Spanish players back in 2022 as 15 players boycotted the national side. They expressed concerns at his coaching style following a poor Euro 2022, as well as his treatment of players. Only three of those players returned to the fold before the World Cup, with the federation removing him from his post while seeking a fresh start.

Following attacks by Hamas militants on the country’s territory last weekend, the British Government had written to UK sports bodies encouraging them to mark events in Israel appropriately. The Hamas attacks have led to the Israeli government responding with airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, with a ground invasion also reported to be a possibility. I am extremely disappointed by the FA’s decision not to light up the Wembley Stadium arch following last weekend’s horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, and have made my views clear to the FA. — Lucy Frazer (@lucyfrazermp) Ahead of Friday’s friendly between England and Australia at Wembley, the FA announced players would wear black armbands and that a period of silence would be observed to remember the victims of the conflict. The FA also confirmed flags, replica kits and other representations of nationality beyond those related to England or Australia would not be allowed inside Wembley. Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer criticised the decision not to light up the Wembley arch in the colours of the Israeli flag. The arch had previously been lit in yellow and blue in an expression of solidarity with Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. The Culture Secretary posted on social media: “I am extremely disappointed by the FA’s decision not to light up the Wembley Stadium arch following last weekend’s horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, and have made my views clear to the FA. “It is especially disappointing in light of the FA’s bold stance on other terrorist attacks in the recent past. Words and actions matter. The Government is clear: we stand with Israel.” The Board of Deputies of British Jews criticised the FA statement – pointing out that it made “no mention of the mass terrorist murders of hundreds of innocent Israelis last Saturday”, while the Government’s antisemitism adviser, Lord John Mann, also made his feelings clear. He told LBC on Friday morning: “I made it easy for them (the FA).

The Exiles currently have three members of their squad that earned a shot in the Football League thanks to their exploits in the Welsh game – forward Will Evans and midfielders James Waite and Nathan Wood. Versatile former Cardiff Met and Bala man Evans is League Two’s joint top scorer after having a stunning start to his second season at Rodney Parade. Waite, who came through Cardiff City’s academy, earned a shot at County thanks to his performances with Penybont and has made 71 appearances for the club since signing in January, 2022. Wood was released by County as a youngster but also shone with Penybont to get an opportunity with the Exiles and scored his first goal for the club on his first start in the 2-0 EFL Trophy win at Cheltenham on Tuesday. County also had success with ex-Connahs Quay central defender Priestley Farquharson, who is now with League Two rivals Walsall, and are looking for future Cymru Premier prospects. “Normally when you come across the lads who have had a setback and are going again they have that hunger and desire,” said manager Graham Coughlan. “The Cymru Premier is an important league and scouting tool for us; we do get out and watch games, and it has proved to be very important for us. “We can’t compete on an even playing field with a lot of other clubs [in the Football League] so we have to think outside the box. “The Welsh market is right on our doorstep so naturally we are going to explore that and we have boots on the ground to attend games and we get a lot of feedback. “The pre-season games and the one we had at Merthyr build relationships and having players in to have a look at over the course of the season is important as well. “It’s a great market and a really competitive league that I enjoy going to watch.” County have also sent young defender Harrison Bright out to get game time with Barry Town United in the Cymru Premier.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:05:07","image_url":"https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/17327521/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesargus","source_priority":284631,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7955571028118b199dff06bd3d98a2ad","title":"Visa Signs With CAF As Official Payment Partner For AFCON Tournaments Until 2026","link":"https://www.completesports.com/visa-signs-with-caf-as-official-payment-partner-for-afcon-tournaments-until-2026/","keywords":["World Football","2023 AFCON","CAF","Côte d’Ivoire","Patrice Motsepe","Visa"],"creator":["James Agberebi"],"video_url":null,"description":"Visa has announced the renewal of its partnership with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) until 2026, which establishes Visa as the exclusive digital payment provider for the upcoming 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament in Cote d’Ivoire.

England and Australia players will wear black armbands during their friendly match on Friday night, with a moment of silence also observed before kick-off. In a statement, the FA said it will \"remember the innocent victims of the devastating events in Israel and Palestine\". \"Our thoughts are with them, and their families and friends in England and Australia and with all the communities who are affected by this ongoing conflict. \"We stand for humanity and an end to the death, violence, fear and suffering.\" However, the decision has been questioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the largest and second oldest Jewish communal organisation in the UK. In a statement, the organisation, also known as the Board of Deputies, made reference to the Bataclan massacre, when 90 people were murdered at a nightclub during the Paris attacks in November 2015. In response, the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, was played at every Premier League stadium the following weekend. The Jewish organisation said on Thursday: \"When hundreds of innocent Israelis were murdered, raped and kidnapped in a coordinated terrorist campaign, unequalled since 9/11, the FA's response is 'to remember the victims of the conflicts in Israel and Palestine' and the Wembley arches will not be illuminated in blue and white. \"This weak response brings no credit to the FA.\" The Chelsea Jewish Supporters' Group described the response as \"spineless\" in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said she was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision and added she had \"made my views clear to the FA\". \"It is especially disappointing in light of the FA's bold stance on other terrorist attacks in the recent past,\" she wrote on X. \"Words and actions matter. The government is clear: we stand with Israel.\" The FA said it will only allow flags and kits of competing nations inside Wembley during England's game against Australia on Friday, and the Three Lions' European Qualifier against Italy on Tuesday. It will also promote a Red Cross emergency appeal to support people affected by the humanitarian crisis in the region in the stadium. Over the years, the Wembley arch has been illuminated in the colours of the flags of countries, including France, Turkey and Ukraine, within days of attacks. There are clear sensitivities - with some wanting Palestinian deaths acknowledged. The president of the FA - Prince William - has commented on the situation in a joint statement with his wife through a Kensington Palace spokesperson. \"As Israel exercises its right to self-defence, all Israelis and Palestinians will be continued to be stalked by grief, fear and anger in the time to come,\" it said. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had earlier joined calls for the Wembley arch to be lit up in blue and white on Friday, telling Sky News \"we should make clear our strong support for Israel\". \"We stand with Israel, and I think we've seen that with parliament, we've seen it with Number 10,\" he said. \"I think it would be fitting to show that with Wembley as well.\" Asked what sympathy he has with the people of Gaza, he said the UK \"does have sympathy\" and contributes \"about 10%\" of the aid distributed in the region through the United Nations. \"It's why the foreign secretary was in Israel yesterday talking to counterparts about the importance of minimising civilian casualties,\" he added. Latest figures from the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) show at least 1,300 Israelis have died and more than 2,700 injured since Hamas's surprise attack on Saturday. The Gaza Health Ministry, meanwhile, reports at least 1,354 Palestinians have died and 6,049 injured in Israeli strikes. England boss Gareth Southgate has backed the FA's stance, saying at his press conference ahead of the Three Lions' clash with Australia on Friday: \"Firstly, it's incredibly harrowing pictures. My thoughts and feelings are with everyone who has suffered, lost relatives and friends in these attacks. \"It's incredibly disturbing to see. On a broader scale, in my lifetime, it's one of the most complex situations in the world and everyone is grappling with how best to deal with that. \"I don't know how to walk in the shoes of those on either side of that conflict. The FA have tried to deal with it, I've not been involved in those discussions. They've decided to take the stance they have, and I'm happy to go along with that.\" Premier League players, managers and match officials will wear black armbands and observe a moment's silence at the fixtures taking place on the weekend of October 21-23, and so will clubs at EFL fixtures this weekend. Tottenham also tweeted: \"The club and our footballing family is shocked and saddened by the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza, and strongly condemns the horrific and brutal acts of violence against innocent civilians. \"Our heartfelt sympathies are with the victims, their families and the communities impacted. We shall join our fellow clubs in wearing black armbands and observing a minute's silence during our next Premier League fixture with Fulham as a mark of respect. We hope and stand for peace.\"","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:00:00","image_url":"https://e1.365dm.com/23/10/1920x1080/skysports-wembley-arch-wembley_6319151.jpg?20231012122021","source_id":"skysports","source_priority":831,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"28409132ea866d909538127fa11011d2","title":"England's loss to Australia saw streaker 'with absolutely no clothes on' run onto pitch","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/england-loss-australia-nude-streaker-31161871","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"When you are losing 2-0 at home to your fierce rivals and your own fans are booing you, the last thing anybody wants to see is a naked man running towards them","content":"It was the last thing any player wanted to see. In 2003, side had their heads handed to them by one of the country’s fiercest sporting rivals… . England have repeatedly been second best to the Aussies in and , but football was supposed to be the banker, the guarantee, the sport where yellow and green will never stand above the crisp white shirts of the Three Lions. Unfortunately, goals from Tony Popovic and Harry Kewell saw the Aussies take a shock 2-0 lead before half-time. Eriksson hauled the entire starting XI off and sent on a new team of England players, featuring a debuting , to clean up the mess overseen by the previous cohort - then a bouldering naked man appeared. A beaming streaker burst onto the pitch, slalomed through security guards and officials and charged towards the England players whose sense of humour was not at its highest. It was a cold, damp and foggy day, yet the naked gentleman was not phased by the bone-chilling elements. Commentator at the time Gary Bloom said: “Just out of your picture, a rather foolish man has run onto the pitch; with absolutely no clothes on at all.” Fortunately for all those in East London, he was wearing some tiny England budgie-smugglers As well as the Champions League, TNT Sports will also be offering sports fans access to games across the Premier League, Europa League, Serie A and much more.

His canter on the Upton Park turf was soon ended when stewards eventually got a hold of him. They combined forces to carry the hefty nude man off the side of the pitch. Streaking, particularly with “absolutely no clothes on” should never be condoned. However, considering the derelict performance on display, there was an argument to suggest he was the most mobile Englishman on the pitch. If heatmaps were around in 2003, fans would have been eager to have seen the distance he covered. Things did not get any better for England as Aussie star Brett Emerton ended any hopes of a comeback by scoring Australia’s third in the 84th minute. The streaker may have been the naked man on the field, but it was the Three Lions who were greatly exposed by the Australians. Gareth Southgate will be hoping for a well-executed and well-clothed performance from his players and spectators when England host Australia at Wembley Stadium.","pubDate":"2023-10-13 08:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31161477.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/1_A-naked-England-fan-gets-carried-off-of-the-pitch.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
