Had it all not happened in the blink of an eye, Pope probably would have known that was not the best decision to make despite Mohamed Salah being in a position to score for Liverpool. The red card resulted in a suspension with Newcastle’s next match coming on Sunday, in the final of the Carabao Cup. It is probably the worst possible match to miss and Pope is arguably the one player Eddie Howe probably would have wanted to be available. Second-choice ‘keeper Martin Dubravka is cup-tied for the match at Wembley having already played for… Manchester United. This means that Howe will have to call upon Mark Gillespie or Loris Karius for Newcastle’s first cup final since 1999. The latter is expected to be the man in the sticks. The last match Karius played for an English side was the 2018 Champions League final for Liverpool against Real Madrid, and everyone knows how that went. The German joined the Geordies as a free agent last September and is yet to make an appearance for the club. The last competitive game he played came for Union Berlin in February 2021. Given Newcastle’s goalkeeper situation, Neville has backed the Red Devils to come out victorious at Wembley. “Obviously having to bring a goalkeeper in, I think the toughest position on a football pitch is a goalkeeper,” he said on the latest Gary Neville Podcast . “As much as I’m critical of them at times, I respect that position enormously.

Here’s why… Rachel Daly’s prowess in front of goal has long been the best-kept secret in the England squad. Her ten goals in 13 matches since joining Aston Villa in the summer make her the Women’s Super League joint-top scorer but before Sunday she had had few chances to show what she can do in attack for her country given she was the side’s left-back during last year’s Euros triumph. But with Ellen White retired and Alessia Russo rested against Italy, Daly’s headed double proved the difference in the Arnold Clark Cup match. The 31-year-old’s striking threat is no surprise to those in the game, however. Having scored 37 goals during her time in America with Houston Dash, Daly is up to 13 goals in a Lionesses shirt. Sarina Wiegman now has real competition for places up front. Since signing for Chelsea , and joining brother Reece at Stamford Bridge in the summer, Lauren James has gone from strength to strength and is beginning to showcase her considerable talents on the international stage. Incredibly, the forward, 21, only made her full England debut in September but netted her first goal against South Korea last Thursday and impressed as a substitute against Italy. Women’s football is still not without its challenges in this country despite England’s Euro 2022 triumph. The ball appeared to cross the byline before Sofia Cantore equalised for Italy in Coventry but without goalline technology, the effort stood. Surely goalline tech is the minimum requirement at elite level in 2023, for all matches. Erik ten Hag singles out THREE Man Utd stars after 'rubbish' first half against Leicester Cesar Azpilicueta sends message to Chelsea fans from hospital after horror injury Glazer family offered financial backing to remain Man Utd owners The Lionesses should wrap up a clean sweep of Arnold Clark Cup victories tomorrow against a Belgium team ranked 20th in the world but it will be games against the likes of South American champions Brazil at a packed Wembley in April which should prove more enlightening ahead of this summer’s shot at World Cup glory.

Henry's Fenway Sports Group (FSG) said in November it would \"consider new shareholders if it was in the best interests of Liverpool as a club.\" That sparked speculation that the 19-time English champions were on the market alongside rivals Manchester United. \"I know there has been a lot of conversation and quotes about LFC (Liverpool Football Club), but I keep to the facts,\" Werner told the Boston Sports Journal. \"We merely formalized an ongoing process. Will we be in England forever? No. Are we selling LFC? No. Are we talking with investors about LFC? Yes. \"Will something happen there? I believe so, but it won't be a sale. Have we sold anything in the past 20-plus years?\" FSG paid 300 million ($361 million) for Liverpool 13 years ago after fellow Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett left the club on the brink of administration. Under their ownership, Liverpool have been restored to the top of the English and European game - winning the 2019 Champions League and lifting the club's first Premier League crown for 30 years in 2020. However, FSG have been criticised by fans for a lack of investment in new players this season. Liverpool sit eighth in the Premier League, 19 points adrift of leaders Arsenal, and are already out of both domestic cup competitions. Manchester United are expected to fetch a world record price for a football club should a sale of the Red Devils be completed in the coming months. British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe and Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani have publicly revealed their interest in United with bids expected to reach around $6 billion.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 18:54:29","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Khune: Don’t Judge Us On Arrows Result!","link":"https://www.snl24.com/soccerladuma/Local/Premiership/Kaizer-Chiefs/captain-khune-jumps-to-chiefs-teammates-defence-20230220","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kaizer Chiefs captain Itumeleng Khune has come out in defence of his teammates following their defeat to Golden Arrows on Sunday.","content":"Kaizer Chiefs captain Itumeleng Khune has come out in defence of his teammates following their defeat to Golden Arrows on Sunday. Chiefs took the lead on two occasions at the Peter Mokaba Stadium, their alternate home venue for three matches this season, and looked full value to walk away with three points. However, Abafana Be’sthende managed to snatch a come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Amakhosi. Despite suffering their eighth defeat of the season that sees them remain in fifth position on the DStv Premiership, Chiefs’ skipper Khune has come out in defence of his teammates, revealing that they were on a good run of form prior to the Arrows loss. “I think people are judging us based on yesterday’s result, and since coming from our three losses, we played very well and this season we have a new squad, we have a new head coach, and we haven’t done that badly. I think we need to be given credit and the new players have managed to fit in and now, we’ve gone three games with three clean sheets. We won against Royal AM, we drew against TS Galaxy and we won against Maritzburg,” he told the media at the Soweto Derby Press Conference at Vodaworld in Midrand on Monday. “So, yesterday’s results cannot make us a bad team in one day. We are a great team, we believe in ourselves, we believe in everyone in our team, and we just urge the supporters to rally behind the team and things will go back to normal because we’ve been given nicknames before, saying we are playing helicopter football, but this season things have changed. And we are happy that these players managed to change that mindset, and no one is talking about that anymore. “Everyone is talking about us playing a good brand of football, the Kaizer Chiefs way. We will continue doing that, we wont let anything outside come and destabilize us as a team,” he continued.

Many have complimented his physical condition given his grand age of 38, but this is nothing new as the player has always had a reputation for being a dedicated trainer and strict about what he puts into his body, and his commitment to this appears to have rubbed off on his new teammates. Al Nassr nutritionist Jose Blesa has now revealed the raft of changes he has seen at the club as a result of Ronaldo's strict diet and fitness regimen. Blesa also said he was curious to see what it would be like to work with a player of Ronaldo's calibre, and has been left amazed by the Real Madrid legend's professionalism. “He is the best footballer in history or one of the two best. I was uncertain, like everyone else, about what it was going to be like to work with him and if the club was going to change a lot, but I haven't found a more professional footballer than him,\" the nutritionist continued. \"Every conversation with him is a learning. We met and talked about his diet, about how he understands the importance of this and rest for performance. \"He wears two rest meters: the ring and the bracelet.\" The ring device mentioned is said to be designed to keep track of the striker's sleep and physical activities, and can track various things such as movement, heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature. \"Cristiano helps me a lot, because we can no longer teach him anything, but he creates a school around him,\" Blesa added. \"The rest of the players do what he does because everything he does is wonderful to improve his performance. \"Since he has been here, all the players have trained more intensely and followed a stricter diet. \"He is the first to arrive at training and the last to leave.

Al Nassr nutritionist Jose Blesa has now revealed the raft of changes he has seen at the club as a result of Ronaldo's strict diet and fitness regimen. Blesa also said he was curious to see what it would be like to work with a player of Ronaldo's calibre, and has been left amazed by the Real Madrid legend's professionalism. “He is the best footballer in history or one of the two best. I was uncertain, like everyone else, about what it was going to be like to work with him and if the club was going to change a lot, but I haven't found a more professional footballer than him,\" the nutritionist continued. \"Every conversation with him is a learning. We met and talked about his diet, about how he understands the importance of this and rest for performance. \"He wears two rest meters: the ring and the bracelet.\" The ring device mentioned is said to be designed to keep track of the striker's sleep and physical activities, and can track various things such as movement, heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature. \"Cristiano helps me a lot, because we can no longer teach him anything, but he creates a school around him,\" Blesa added. \"The rest of the players do what he does because everything he does is wonderful to improve his performance. \"Since he has been here, all the players have trained more intensely and followed a stricter diet. \"He is the first to arrive at training and the last to leave.

Dortmund managing director Carsten Cramer has now admitted, however, that signing Ronaldo would not have been in line with the club's aspirations. \"Basically, the value of Borussia Dortmund does not depend on social media followers,\" he told “We are a football club, that's the key. We can have the best ideas in marketing, but if we lose 3-0 at home to Freiburg, it doesn't work. \"Even with the best brand presentation, the be-all and end-all is the product.\" The 38-year-old marksman is the most followed individual on Instagram with 549 million followers.

Pope was given a straight red card in the Magpies’ 2-0 loss at home to Liverpool on Saturday. After failing to deal with a long kick from Reds goalkeeper Alisson, the England international grabbed the ball while around 20 yards outside his box. Had it all not happened in the blink of an eye, Pope probably would have known that was not the best decision to make despite Mohamed Salah being in a position to score for Liverpool. The red card resulted in a suspension with Newcastle’s next match coming on Sunday, in the final of the Carabao Cup. It is probably the worst possible match to miss and Pope is arguably the one player Eddie Howe probably would have wanted to be available. Second-choice ‘keeper Martin Dubravka is cup-tied for the match at Wembley having already played for… Manchester United. This means that Howe will have to call upon Mark Gillespie or Loris Karius for Newcastle’s first cup final since 1999. The latter is expected to be the man in the sticks. The last match Karius played for an English side was the 2018 Champions League final for Liverpool against Real Madrid, and everyone knows how that went. The German joined the Geordies as a free agent last September and is yet to make an appearance for the club. The last competitive game he played came for Union Berlin in February 2021. Given Newcastle’s goalkeeper situation, Neville has backed the Red Devils to come out victorious at Wembley. “Obviously having to bring a goalkeeper in, I think the toughest position on a football pitch is a goalkeeper,” he said on the latest Gary Neville Podcast . “As much as I’m critical of them at times, I respect that position enormously. It’s a tough position and the other position I feel is the toughest to play is actually up front on your own. “Newcastle not having Pope is a blow to them but it’s a cup final. Newcastle will be desperate to win, just as Man United will be. It has to be an advantage to Manchester United for Newcastle to lose such an important player. “United play on Thursday night against Barcelona on what is a monumental second-leg of a brilliant game, the return leg from the Nou Camp, so that might equalise it a little bit as well, that Manchester United have other thoughts this week. “Maybe there’s a little bit there. It’s going to be a really interesting game, I’m going to be there and I can’t wait for it because I think it’s an intriguing story that both these clubs are desperate for a trophy.” Before the showpiece final on Sunday, Manchester United host Barcelona in the Europa League. Erik ten Hag’s side drew 2-2 in the first leg of their play-off match last week.

Me la tengo per le mie riflessioni in campagna con i miei cani”.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 17:34:51","image_url":"https://tmw-storage.tcccdn.com/storage/tuttomercatoweb.com/img_notizie/thumb3/2a/2a2b8e809d8c7ebe9e3a59c9e15f03f5-00383-oooz0000.jpeg","source_id":"tuttomercatoweb","category":["sports"],"country":["italy"],"language":"italian"},{"title":"Il Barcellona piomba su Rodri per la mediana che verrà: pronti 90 milioni per il Manchester City","link":"https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/calcio-estero/il-barcellona-piomba-su-rodri-per-la-mediana-che-verra-pronti-90-milioni-per-il-manchester-city-1794776","keywords":["Calcio estero"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Il Barcellona cerca un centrocampista di livello per sostituire il partente Sergio Busquets nel 2023-24.","content":"Il Barcellona cerca un centrocampista di livello per sostituire il partente Sergio Busquets nel 2023-24.

Many have complimented his physical condition given his grand age of 38, but this is nothing new as the player has always had a reputation for being a dedicated trainer and strict about what he puts into his body, and his commitment to this appears to have rubbed off on his new teammates. Al Nassr nutritionist Jose Blesa has now revealed the raft of changes he has seen at the club as a result of Ronaldo's strict diet and fitness regimen. Blesa also said he was curious to see what it would be like to work with a player of Ronaldo's calibre, and has been left amazed by the Real Madrid legend's professionalism. “He is the best footballer in history or one of the two best. I was uncertain, like everyone else, about what it was going to be like to work with him and if the club was going to change a lot, but I haven't found a more professional footballer than him,\" the nutritionist continued. \"Every conversation with him is a learning. We met and talked about his diet, about how he understands the importance of this and rest for performance. \"He wears two rest meters: the ring and the bracelet.\" The ring device mentioned is said to be designed to keep track of the striker's sleep and physical activities, and can track various things such as movement, heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature. \"Cristiano helps me a lot, because we can no longer teach him anything, but he creates a school around him,\" Blesa added. \"The rest of the players do what he does because everything he does is wonderful to improve his performance. \"Since he has been here, all the players have trained more intensely and followed a stricter diet. \"He is the first to arrive at training and the last to leave. Dealing with him is wonderful.\" You must be to read and post comments.","pubDate":"2023-02-20 17:22:47","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/kickoff24.png","source_id":"snl24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Snl24.com | Story Behind My Nickname - 'See me now, see me no more'","link":"https://www.snl24.com/KickOff/SANews/Premiership/Swallows-FC/story-behind-my-nickname-see-me-now-see-me-no-more-20230220","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In this edition of Story Behind My Nickname former Moroka Swallows star Samuel Ngobeni give details of his unusual name 'See'.","content":"Ngobeni was a dribbling wizard and a fan-favourite at Swallows.
