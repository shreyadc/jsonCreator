Arsenal 's new signing Declan Rice , Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber all started but were unable to make a real impact as Man City came away victorious. Havertz tested Stefan Ortega twice in the first half but was unable to convert either of his chances. The breakthrough came after Pep Guardiola made several changes, with De Bruyne and Palmer coming on and the pair linked up to secure the win for Man City as Palmer converted in the 77th minute for the Citizens. However, there was drama at the very end, with Leandro Trossard netting an equaliser in the 11th-minute of stoppage time. Cole Palmer netted the opening goal of the match for Manchester City at Wembley Leandro Trossard scored in the 11th-minute of added time as he took the game to penalties Kevin de Bruyne smashed the crossbar with his penalty after coming off the bench With the clash heading straight to a penalty shoot-out, it was De Bruyne up first for City, following Martin Odegaard's conversion - and the Belgian smashed his effort against the crossbar. Goalscorer Trossard followed next and sent Ortega the wrong way to convert his spot-kick before Bernardo Silva followed and did the same. Bukayo Saka scored his effort calmly as Arsneal were in control. Rodri was up next for City but saw his effort saved by Aaron Ramsdale before Fabio Vieira hit his strike into the top corner to give Arteta's side the victory. More to follow...

Kane put the uncertainty over his future to at least one aspect to supply a basic show of predatory ending in what might show to be his ultimate look in Spurs’ colors. Bayern are reported to have lodged their newest provide for Kane on Friday and an obvious self-imposed deadline of midnight was set by the German membership, however there was no additional information on the result of that bid and Kane grabbed a hat-trick in 55 minutes of a 5-1 pleasant win over Shakhtar. Kane added one other purpose within the 79th-minute earlier than he left the pitch a minute later to a standing ovation following extra chants of ‘he’s certainly one of our personal’ and on the conclusion of the conflict the membership’s report goal-scorer walked across the pitch to clap all 4 corners of the bottom in what felt a major second. “We know there’s one deadline and that’s the end of the transfer window,” Postecoglou identified. “Beyond that, I’m in open dialogue with Harry and with the club on a regular basis. I’ve said to them that if the status quo changes then inform me. “I don’t need to know about the comings and goings in between. I just want to deal with what’s in front of me because, irrespective of the outcome of that, I’m building a team here. I can’t wait (around) for a decision either way to get going. “We don’t have the time or the luxury to do that. I’m working with what’s in front of me. You saw today that Harry certainly is invested in what we’re doing and we’ll keep on doing that unless something changes.” Bayern have been public about their want to signal Kane all summer season, with their honorary president Uli Hoeness and president Herbert Hainer speaking brazenly within the media final month about attempting to signal the England captain. We know there’s one deadline and that is the tip of the switch window Postecoglou added: “That’s up to Bayern to decide. If that’s the way they want to conduct things, it’s not up to me to judge that. “It doesn’t affect me. I don’t sit there on a daily basis and worry about what other clubs are doing. “I think what is factual right now is that he is a contracted player of our football club. “I certainly wouldn’t talk about contracted players at other football clubs but I’m not at Bayern mate so they can go the way they want.” While lots of the concentrate on Sunday was on Kane, amongst the spectators at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was Wolfsburg centre-back Micky van de Ven. Netherlands defender Van de Ven is scheduled to have a medical at Spurs’ coaching floor on Monday. But requested about Van de Ven, Postecoglou replied: “It hasn’t been done yet, so it’s not right for me to talk about but there’s no doubt we need some bolstering in that central defensive area. “Hopefully we’ll get one or two done in the next couple of days to bolster us in that area.” While Van de Ven’s future appears to be like sure to be at Tottenham, Kane’s membership for this marketing campaign stays up within the air. Postecoglou refused to be drawn into the importance of Kane strolling alone to applaud all 4 corners of the stadium at full-time. “You are reading something into it, aren’t you,” he added. “I don’t even know what’s in Harry’s mind, let alone anyone else’s. I think all these things will obviously play out over the next period, we’ll deal with what happens from there. “From my perspective, I’ve got a team to build here. Today showed me that we’ve made some progress but there’s still a lot of work to do. “There were areas today I wasn’t delighted with, so we need to make sure we focus on getting this team right. We’ll see what happens after that. “He’s a fantastic striker, one of the world’s best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that.” Biden comforts USA ladies’s soccer group after heartbreaking World Cup defeat","pubDate":"2023-08-06 17:15:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"businesslend","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Newcastle's £52million star Sandro Tonali has demonstrated his vision and precision in abundance during pre-season, but the Italian has hard work ahead of him","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12378399/Newcastles-52million-star-Sandro-Tonali-demonstrated-vision-precision-abundance-pre-season-Italian-hard-work-ahead-him.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CRAIG HOPE: Sandro Tonali has shown what he can do for Newcastle - the class and vision are glaring - but this summer has also shown what he needs to do.","content":"Newcastle's £52m star Sandro Tonali has demonstrated his vision and precision in pre-season, but the Italian has hard work ahead of him as Eddie Howe moulds him for the intensity of Premier League life By Craig Hope Updated: 13:00 EDT, 6 August 2023 e-mail 2 View comments Sandro Tonali has shown what he can do for Newcastle - the class and vision are glaring - but this summer has also shown what he needs to do. Eddie Howe ’s midfielders run in all directions, and they run hard. They track runners and, at the other end, give their opponents a runner to track. On his debut, against an average Rangers side last month, the £52million arrival from Milan was the best player on the park. When the team flew to the United States from Glasgow the following morning , staff were eulogising over his qualities - he saw things a second quicker than everyone else and his precision was close to perfect. But then, against Premier League opposition in the States and with players such as Aston Villa’s John McGinn and Emiliano Buendia biting at his heels, those skills were muzzled. Sandro Tonali joined Newcastle for a fee of £52million from Serie A side AC Milan this summer History shows that Italians don't fare well in the Premier League, so he'll need time to adapt Newcastle celebrated a 2-1 victory over Scottish team Rangers, as well as beating Fiorentina 2-0 in a later pre-season friendly thanks to goals from Miguel Almiron and Alexander Isak This was a different game now. Backroom staff in the US noted how Tonali would need time to make the transition from Serie A. One week on from the excitement of Ibrox, there was now caution. On Saturday, against Fiorentina - a team he knows well - Tonali looked more like the version he presented at Rangers. The problem is, Newcastle don’t play teams from Italy and Scotland every week. It was, then, telling when Howe later said: ‘Out of possession, it was a step up on his recent performances, which was good to see.’ The longer Tonali is exposed to Howe, the better it will make him. That improvement, coupled with acclimatisation, should see a top player emerge, the one who those behind the scenes are convinced was the best of their midfield targets this close-season. There is risk, though. History tells us that Italians have not fared well in the Premier League. And, on the evidence of recent weeks, Tonali has work to do, a fact acknowledged by Howe. ‘We are working on every aspect of his game,’ he said. ‘For Sandro, the Premier League is different. 'He would have found that in the few games he played in America, where there was a step up - just the speed, sharpness, where opponents place themselves. The Newcastle boss added, 'we have to be solid defensively if we are to have success. Tonali struggled to show his impressive skills against Premier League opposition Aston Villa in the States, with players such as John McGinn and Emiliano Buendia biting at his heels ‘We are working on every aspect of his game,’ Howe said. ‘The Premier League is different' ‌’He’s a combiner, he’s going to need relationships to show his best qualities. In time, those will grow and we will see the player I know he is going to be. 'He was very good (against Fiorentina). I was pleased with Sandro, he played as an 8 and a 6 and was composed in possession. With Tonali, composed in possession is a given. Dogged and diligent when out of it is the challenge.

The Manchester City striker and Arsenal midfielder were booked for kicking the ball away while Arteta was shown a yellow for dissent, all in the first half of the Community Shield clash. Arsenal's manager had demanded a booking for Rodri after his tackle on Kai Havertz , brandishing his own imaginary card, but found himself reprimanded by referee Stuart Attwell. Harsh crackdowns on time-wasting and abuse are central to new refereeing guidelines, with stoppage time added set to run into double digits. The new measures will apply across the Premier League and EFL. Mikel Arteta was booked for dissent in the first half of the Community Shield final Thomas Partey and Julian Alvarez were also put on the naughty step after kicking the ball away One official told Sky Sports News that most matches will last longer than 100 minutes. Similar to what was seen in the World Cup, officials will add on a more realistic reflection of time lost due to conniving measures. It comes after the International Football Association Board (IFAB) met in March and decided referees should follow the style of officiating seen in Qatar . Last season, the ball was in play in Premier League matches for the lowest amount of time per match in 12 years , with live play only taking place for 54 minutes and 53 seconds. While some lost time is natural, time-wasting also contributes to the dearth of action, particularly in the latter stages of matches when teams try to defend leads at all costs.

The Round of 16 clash saw World Cup favourites USA knocked out by Sweden after the matche ended 0-0 after 90 minutes and extra-time. Heading to penalties, nobody could have predicted the drama to follow as Lina Huryig stepped up for her strike. The Sweden star saw her penalty saved by Alyssa Naeher but the 35-year-old goalkeeper could only spill the ball onto the line. Reacting quickly, Naeher palmed the ball off the goal line but VAR showed that the ball had crossed the line by millimeters.

With the USA out, England have been handed a huge boost in their search of World Cup glory but know they must progress past a tough Nigeria side tomorrow morning. Sarina Wiegman's side are one of the favourites for the competition but will be keen to avoid a slip up like the USA had against Sweden. A less dramatic victory tomorrow will see England progress into the quarter-final stages as they look to bring the trophy home. It's back to the drawing board for the USWNT, who failed to score past Sweden despite creating several chances in the match.

The England forward put up a captain's performance today, scoring four times to help his side defeat Shakhtar 5-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday. It comes as Daniel Levy had this week ignored Bayern Munich's deadline on an £86million offer to sign the club's all-time leading goal-scorer, with Mail Sport revealing he could stay at the club this summer. Kane is now coming into the final year of his contract at Tottenham and depending on whether he stays or leaves, it seems Spurs will continue to stock up on new talent, with Ange Postecoglou 's side now on the cusp of signing Alejo Veliz in a £12m deal from Rosario Central . As the London side continue to build their squad ahead of the new Premier League season, with defender Micky van de Ven also due in London this week for a medical, they certainly look to be firing pretty well considering today's resounding victory against Shakhtar. Harry Kane (pictured) scored a quartet of goals as Tottenham defeated Shakhtar 5-1 in a pre-season friendly on Sunday Kane scored a penalty in the first half to give his side the lead, but the visitors soon equalised before the break His impressive performance comes amid much uncertainty on his future at the London club, with Bayern Munich continuing their attempts to sign him But they were made to work for the win in the first 45 minutes. Their first goal came on the 38th minute after James Maddison was brought down inside the penalty area. Kane stepped up to score his fifth goal of their summer warm up games, and his first of the match, placing his ball into the bottom right corner of the goal, narrowly evading Shakhtar goalkeeper Dmytro Riznyk, who had come on to replace Andrij Pyatov. Pyatov, 39, was playing in the final game of his career today and the long-time club captain was given a guard of honour by his team-mates after he was substituted in the 17th minute. Despite Tottenham looking more in control, Shakhtar struck back just before the break, with Kevin Kelsy scoring a very well taken header, connecting with a fast cross into the penalty area from Danylo Sikan. Nothing could separate the teams at half-time, but Tottenham would come out of the blocks looking sharper, with Kane netting his second and third goals in quick succession. Ange Postecoglou's (pictured) side looked dangerous today, but are likely to be bringing in some more new faces this week, including Alejo Veliz and Micky van de Ven Kevin Kelsy (front middle) scored a fantastic header just before the break for the away side, capitalising on a fast cross to level the scores heading into the break Kane (middle) came back soon after, scoring a quick fire brace of goals to secure his hat-trick But he wasn't done there with the England striker scoring his fourth goal, gambling at the far post to knock in a rebound He would be replaced by 19-year-old Dane Scarlett (right) who finished off the scoring with a thumping effort Spurs will now take on Barcelona in a mid-week pre-season friendly before they travel to play Brentford next week MATCH FACTS TOTTENHAM: (4-2-3-1) Vicario; Udogie, Davies, Romero, Emerson Royal; Hojberg, Sarr (Skipp 87'); Son (Solomon 78'), Maddison (Lo Celso 77'), Kulusevski; Kane (Scarlett 80').

Five minutes later, the 30-year-old would then find himself one-on-one with the keeper, latching onto a lovely through-ball from Dejan Kulusevski, to net his hat-trick. He wasn't done there though, gambling at the far post to tap in a rebound and put his side 4-1 up on the 79th minute. Dane Scarlett, who came on to replace the forward in the 80th minute, completed the quartet of goals, with the 19-year-old solidifying the win with a powerful effort into the bottom-right corner of the goal. Tottenham have one final pre-season game away to Barcelona this week, before they take on Brentford next Sunday in their first game of the new Premier League season.

Plumptre, who three weeks in the past left Leicester after making 79 appearances for the Women’s Super League facet, grew up with a half-Nigerian dad whose personal father was born in Lagos. The defender stated: “For me, it wasn’t difficult because I knew exactly what I wanted from football and I think that just came down from understanding who I am. On my journey, I’ve learned more about myself and I know what I want from football. “And I always say, ‘for me, it’s more than just playing.’ It sounds really weird but I always say I’m not obsessed with football, specifically, I’m obsessed with what I can learn about myself from playing. “And that’s why playing for Nigeria would probably be the most fulfilling thing I could do. “Not to say that my experiences were ever bad with England, they never were, but it was just more that my life went on a different course. “And I’m like, hmm, this is important for me, for my sister, for my family and for the young people who identify as being mixed heritage.” In an interview for the Nigerian Football Federation, Plumptre describes her youthful half-sister Bayleigh Bisi as having a darker pores and skin tone and completely different hair texture, which initially led to her extra strongly resonating with their Nigerian heritage. Plumptre feels her personal journey is entwined together with her sibling’s – going as far as to say that the street to this World Cup, which noticed world quantity 40 Nigeria oust Olympic champions Canada en path to the knockouts, is one shared by them each. She added: “I feel like people have different reasons for wanting to play for a different country. “For me, obviously, I grew up playing for England and I enjoyed my time with them but I always say it was always more of a life decision than a football decision. “I felt like I had a responsibility to try and play for Nigeria, if I could. “And that just came from experiences within family. I’ve got my younger sister, I used to coach an under-12s team with girls with mixed heritage girls, and I feel like I have a responsibility to learn about my heritage and I have the privilege of being able to play football and use that to be able to learn, so it came about like that for me.” Nigeria have contested all 9 World Cups, reaching the quarter-finals in 1999. Should they want to equal or higher that feat they must discover their well beyond European champions England. Plumptre is ready to face the Lionesses, a facet which incorporates a number of former team-mates. She stated: “I was like, ‘it’s gonna end up that way’.

ALSO READ: How Khune’s height hindered overseas move The game took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, with the stands nearly packed, and provided the supporters with some nervous moments before the final whistle sealed the sharing of points. On the other side, Chiefs coach, Molefi Ntseki, might not be as jubilant, as his team showed glimpses of potential but lacked creativity in the attacking third. This can however be attributed to it being their first game of the season and the presence of several new players in the squad. Out of the eight new signings, Ntseki opted to start with four: Given Msimango, Thatayaone Dithlokwe, Edson Castillo, and Ranga Chivaviro. During the first half, both teams managed to create a few chances, but poor decision-making and some rustiness led to wasted opportunities. The defenders and goalkeepers stood strong, ensuring that no goals were conceded by halftime, despite the promising build-up play. The second half saw an increase in excitement, with both sides displaying adventurous football in their quest for a victorious start to the season. Chippa, however, made more meaningful entries into the box, putting pressure on Chiefs’ debutant defender, Given Msimango, who had to work diligently to prevent his team from conceding. Changes bring some positive moves for Chiefs With a little over 20 minutes remaining on the clock, Ntseki decided to make a double substitution, introducing Mduduzi Mdantsane in place of Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Tebogo Potsane to replace Ranga Chivaviro. This tactical move seemed to work in Chiefs’ favour, as they started executing some excellent passes and creating dangerous situations.

The title-holders dominated the opening 90 minutes but a breakthrough proved elusive with Swedish goalkeeper Zecira Musovic making some startling saves to keep her side alive. With the 0-0 deadlock remaining after extra-time it went to penalties in Melbourne — and the tension went up another notch. Sweden’s Nathalie Bjorn was the first to miss, skying high, only for Megan Rapinoe to do the same. Rebecka Blomqvist’s effort was saved, again putting the USA in the driving seat, only for Sophia Smith to blast wide. When Kelley O’Hara hit the post, it was all down to Sweden’s Lina Hurtig, who made sure — but only after VAR ruled her kick had crossed the line. For the Americans, who just never really got going at this tournament, it ended their dreams of a third World Cup title in a row in the most painful fashion. It was also an inglorious end for Rapinoe, the Golden Boot winner at the 2019 tournament. She will retire at the end of the season. “This is like a sick joke. For me personally, I’m just like, this is dark comedy. I missed a penalty,” Rapinoe told Fox Sports. “I think it can be cruel and just not our day.” She added: “I thought we played really well. I’m so happy for us that we went out like that, playing the way that we did.” Expectations were high coming into the tournament for the four-time champions, who had made at least the semi-finals at every World Cup. But they never looked up to the task in the group stage, with just one win, against Vietnam. The dramatic conclusion leaves the tournament without the two top-ranked sides after Germany’s group-stage departure. This devastating early exit will be seen as a major underachievement for the Americans, who have been the superpower of international women’s football for so long. Vlatko Andonovski made two changes from the US team that drew 0-0 against Portugal, with Emily Sonnett in for suspended midfielder Rose Lavelle and Trinity Rodman preferred up front to Lynn Williams. Sweden rested nine players in their last group game, but reverted to their strongest XI with strikers Fridolina Rolfo and Stina Blackstenius returning and Musovic getting the nod as goalkeeper ahead of Jennifer Falk. After both sides sized each other up, the USA worked the first clear chance on six minutes, but Andi Sullivan’s drive from the edge of the box skewered wide. A patient Sweden created space early on, particularly on the flanks, and sent in a series of teasing crosses to use their height advantage, to no avail. As the game wore on the US assumed midfield control and a livewire Rodman went close to the opener after 18 minutes, letting fly from distance with Musovic palming away. She was forced into a similar stop minutes later, again from Rodman, but could only watch as a towering Lindsey Horan header rattled the crossbar in the best opportunity of a lively half the US dominated. The title-holders carried the momentum into the second stanza and only a world-class reflex save from Musovic kept Sweden on level terms, turning a vicious strike from Horan around the post at full stretch. It was all the United States and a goal seemed inevitable, but Musovic again kept Sweden in the game with another cracking save in the 88th minute, this time from Alex Morgan. She pulled off two more brilliant saves in extra-time to take the match to penalties.","pubDate":"2023-08-06 15:10:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsenal 1-1 Man City (4-1 on pens): Gunners start the season with a trophy as Aaron Ramsdale's shootout save seals Community Shield win over title rivals at Wembley after 101st-minute leveller","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12378545/Man-City-1-1-Arsenal-Arsenal-win-4-1-penalties-Kevin-Bruyne-Rodri-MISS-penalties-Gunners-win-Community-Sheild-Leandro-Trossard-equalised-11TH-MINUTE-stoppage-time-following-Cole-Palmers-opener.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal have won the Community Shield on penalties after Kevin de Bruyne and Rodri missed from the spot in a shoot-out following a dramatic end to the match.","content":"Arsenal 1-1 Man City (4-1 on pens): Gunners start the season with a trophy as Aaron Ramsdale's shootout save seals Community Shield win over title rivals at Wembley after 101st-minute leveller Palmer opened the scoring off the bench, combining with Kevin de Bruyne Trossard netted a dramatic late equaliser in the 11th-minute of stoppage time De Bruyne hit the crossbar with his penalty as Aaron Ramsdale saved Rodri's By Nick Emms For Mailonline Updated: 18:34 BST, 6 August 2023 e-mail 5 shares 25 View comments Arsenal have won the Community Shield on penalties after Kevin de Bruyne and Rodri missed from the spot in a shoot-out. Arsenal 's new signing Declan Rice , Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber all started but were unable to make a real impact as Man City came away victorious. Havertz tested Stefan Ortega twice in the first half but was unable to convert either of his chances. The breakthrough came after Pep Guardiola made several changes, with De Bruyne and Palmer coming on and the pair linked up to secure the win for Man City as Palmer converted in the 77th minute for the Citizens. However, there was drama at the very end, with Leandro Trossard netting an equaliser in the 11th-minute of stoppage time. Cole Palmer netted the opening goal of the match for Manchester City at Wembley Leandro Trossard scored in the 11th-minute of added time as he took the game to penalties Kevin de Bruyne smashed the crossbar with his penalty after coming off the bench With the clash heading straight to a penalty shoot-out, it was De Bruyne up first for City, following Martin Odegaard's conversion - and the Belgian smashed his effort against the crossbar. Goalscorer Trossard followed next and sent Ortega the wrong way to convert his spot-kick before Bernardo Silva followed and did the same. Bukayo Saka scored his effort calmly as Arsneal were in control. Rodri was up next for City but saw his effort saved by Aaron Ramsdale before Fabio Vieira hit his strike into the top corner to give Arteta's side the victory. More to follow...

Kane put the uncertainty over his future to at least one aspect to supply a basic show of predatory ending in what might show to be his ultimate look in Spurs’ colors. Bayern are reported to have lodged their newest provide for Kane on Friday and an obvious self-imposed deadline of midnight was set by the German membership, however there was no additional information on the result of that bid and Kane grabbed a hat-trick in 55 minutes of a 5-1 pleasant win over Shakhtar. Kane added one other purpose within the 79th-minute earlier than he left the pitch a minute later to a standing ovation following extra chants of ‘he’s certainly one of our personal’ and on the conclusion of the conflict the membership’s report goal-scorer walked across the pitch to clap all 4 corners of the bottom in what felt a major second. “We know there’s one deadline and that’s the end of the transfer window,” Postecoglou identified. “Beyond that, I’m in open dialogue with Harry and with the club on a regular basis. I’ve said to them that if the status quo changes then inform me. “I don’t need to know about the comings and goings in between. I just want to deal with what’s in front of me because, irrespective of the outcome of that, I’m building a team here. I can’t wait (around) for a decision either way to get going. “We don’t have the time or the luxury to do that. I’m working with what’s in front of me. You saw today that Harry certainly is invested in what we’re doing and we’ll keep on doing that unless something changes.” Bayern have been public about their want to signal Kane all summer season, with their honorary president Uli Hoeness and president Herbert Hainer speaking brazenly within the media final month about attempting to signal the England captain. We know there’s one deadline and that is the tip of the switch window Postecoglou added: “That’s up to Bayern to decide. If that’s the way they want to conduct things, it’s not up to me to judge that. “It doesn’t affect me. I don’t sit there on a daily basis and worry about what other clubs are doing. “I think what is factual right now is that he is a contracted player of our football club. “I certainly wouldn’t talk about contracted players at other football clubs but I’m not at Bayern mate so they can go the way they want.” While lots of the concentrate on Sunday was on Kane, amongst the spectators at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was Wolfsburg centre-back Micky van de Ven. Netherlands defender Van de Ven is scheduled to have a medical at Spurs’ coaching floor on Monday. But requested about Van de Ven, Postecoglou replied: “It hasn’t been done yet, so it’s not right for me to talk about but there’s no doubt we need some bolstering in that central defensive area. “Hopefully we’ll get one or two done in the next couple of days to bolster us in that area.” While Van de Ven’s future appears to be like sure to be at Tottenham, Kane’s membership for this marketing campaign stays up within the air. Postecoglou refused to be drawn into the importance of Kane strolling alone to applaud all 4 corners of the stadium at full-time. “You are reading something into it, aren’t you,” he added. “I don’t even know what’s in Harry’s mind, let alone anyone else’s. I think all these things will obviously play out over the next period, we’ll deal with what happens from there. “From my perspective, I’ve got a team to build here. Today showed me that we’ve made some progress but there’s still a lot of work to do. “There were areas today I wasn’t delighted with, so we need to make sure we focus on getting this team right. We’ll see what happens after that. “He’s a fantastic striker, one of the world’s best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that.” Biden comforts USA ladies’s soccer group after heartbreaking World Cup defeat","pubDate":"2023-08-06 17:15:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"businesslend","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Newcastle's £52million star Sandro Tonali has demonstrated his vision and precision in abundance during pre-season, but the Italian has hard work ahead of him","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12378399/Newcastles-52million-star-Sandro-Tonali-demonstrated-vision-precision-abundance-pre-season-Italian-hard-work-ahead-him.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CRAIG HOPE: Sandro Tonali has shown what he can do for Newcastle - the class and vision are glaring - but this summer has also shown what he needs to do.","content":"Newcastle's £52m star Sandro Tonali has demonstrated his vision and precision in pre-season, but the Italian has hard work ahead of him as Eddie Howe moulds him for the intensity of Premier League life By Craig Hope Updated: 13:00 EDT, 6 August 2023 e-mail 2 View comments Sandro Tonali has shown what he can do for Newcastle - the class and vision are glaring - but this summer has also shown what he needs to do. Eddie Howe ’s midfielders run in all directions, and they run hard. They track runners and, at the other end, give their opponents a runner to track. On his debut, against an average Rangers side last month, the £52million arrival from Milan was the best player on the park. When the team flew to the United States from Glasgow the following morning , staff were eulogising over his qualities - he saw things a second quicker than everyone else and his precision was close to perfect. But then, against Premier League opposition in the States and with players such as Aston Villa’s John McGinn and Emiliano Buendia biting at his heels, those skills were muzzled. Sandro Tonali joined Newcastle for a fee of £52million from Serie A side AC Milan this summer History shows that Italians don't fare well in the Premier League, so he'll need time to adapt Newcastle celebrated a 2-1 victory over Scottish team Rangers, as well as beating Fiorentina 2-0 in a later pre-season friendly thanks to goals from Miguel Almiron and Alexander Isak This was a different game now. Backroom staff in the US noted how Tonali would need time to make the transition from Serie A. One week on from the excitement of Ibrox, there was now caution. On Saturday, against Fiorentina - a team he knows well - Tonali looked more like the version he presented at Rangers. The problem is, Newcastle don’t play teams from Italy and Scotland every week. It was, then, telling when Howe later said: ‘Out of possession, it was a step up on his recent performances, which was good to see.’ The longer Tonali is exposed to Howe, the better it will make him. That improvement, coupled with acclimatisation, should see a top player emerge, the one who those behind the scenes are convinced was the best of their midfield targets this close-season. There is risk, though. History tells us that Italians have not fared well in the Premier League. And, on the evidence of recent weeks, Tonali has work to do, a fact acknowledged by Howe. ‘We are working on every aspect of his game,’ he said. ‘For Sandro, the Premier League is different. 'He would have found that in the few games he played in America, where there was a step up - just the speed, sharpness, where opponents place themselves. The Newcastle boss added, 'we have to be solid defensively if we are to have success. Tonali struggled to show his impressive skills against Premier League opposition Aston Villa in the States, with players such as John McGinn and Emiliano Buendia biting at his heels ‘We are working on every aspect of his game,’ Howe said. ‘The Premier League is different' ‌’He’s a combiner, he’s going to need relationships to show his best qualities. In time, those will grow and we will see the player I know he is going to be. 'He was very good (against Fiorentina). I was pleased with Sandro, he played as an 8 and a 6 and was composed in possession. With Tonali, composed in possession is a given. Dogged and diligent when out of it is the challenge.

The Manchester City striker and Arsenal midfielder were booked for kicking the ball away while Arteta was shown a yellow for dissent, all in the first half of the Community Shield clash. Arsenal's manager had demanded a booking for Rodri after his tackle on Kai Havertz , brandishing his own imaginary card, but found himself reprimanded by referee Stuart Attwell. Harsh crackdowns on time-wasting and abuse are central to new refereeing guidelines, with stoppage time added set to run into double digits. The new measures will apply across the Premier League and EFL. Mikel Arteta was booked for dissent in the first half of the Community Shield final Thomas Partey and Julian Alvarez were also put on the naughty step after kicking the ball away One official told Sky Sports News that most matches will last longer than 100 minutes. Similar to what was seen in the World Cup, officials will add on a more realistic reflection of time lost due to conniving measures. It comes after the International Football Association Board (IFAB) met in March and decided referees should follow the style of officiating seen in Qatar . Last season, the ball was in play in Premier League matches for the lowest amount of time per match in 12 years , with live play only taking place for 54 minutes and 53 seconds. While some lost time is natural, time-wasting also contributes to the dearth of action, particularly in the latter stages of matches when teams try to defend leads at all costs.

The Round of 16 clash saw World Cup favourites USA knocked out by Sweden after the matche ended 0-0 after 90 minutes and extra-time. Heading to penalties, nobody could have predicted the drama to follow as Lina Huryig stepped up for her strike. The Sweden star saw her penalty saved by Alyssa Naeher but the 35-year-old goalkeeper could only spill the ball onto the line. Reacting quickly, Naeher palmed the ball off the goal line but VAR showed that the ball had crossed the line by millimeters.

With the USA out, England have been handed a huge boost in their search of World Cup glory but know they must progress past a tough Nigeria side tomorrow morning. Sarina Wiegman's side are one of the favourites for the competition but will be keen to avoid a slip up like the USA had against Sweden. A less dramatic victory tomorrow will see England progress into the quarter-final stages as they look to bring the trophy home. It's back to the drawing board for the USWNT, who failed to score past Sweden despite creating several chances in the match.

The England forward put up a captain's performance today, scoring four times to help his side defeat Shakhtar 5-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday. It comes as Daniel Levy had this week ignored Bayern Munich's deadline on an £86million offer to sign the club's all-time leading goal-scorer, with Mail Sport revealing he could stay at the club this summer. Kane is now coming into the final year of his contract at Tottenham and depending on whether he stays or leaves, it seems Spurs will continue to stock up on new talent, with Ange Postecoglou 's side now on the cusp of signing Alejo Veliz in a £12m deal from Rosario Central . As the London side continue to build their squad ahead of the new Premier League season, with defender Micky van de Ven also due in London this week for a medical, they certainly look to be firing pretty well considering today's resounding victory against Shakhtar. Harry Kane (pictured) scored a quartet of goals as Tottenham defeated Shakhtar 5-1 in a pre-season friendly on Sunday Kane scored a penalty in the first half to give his side the lead, but the visitors soon equalised before the break His impressive performance comes amid much uncertainty on his future at the London club, with Bayern Munich continuing their attempts to sign him But they were made to work for the win in the first 45 minutes. Their first goal came on the 38th minute after James Maddison was brought down inside the penalty area. Kane stepped up to score his fifth goal of their summer warm up games, and his first of the match, placing his ball into the bottom right corner of the goal, narrowly evading Shakhtar goalkeeper Dmytro Riznyk, who had come on to replace Andrij Pyatov. Pyatov, 39, was playing in the final game of his career today and the long-time club captain was given a guard of honour by his team-mates after he was substituted in the 17th minute. Despite Tottenham looking more in control, Shakhtar struck back just before the break, with Kevin Kelsy scoring a very well taken header, connecting with a fast cross into the penalty area from Danylo Sikan. Nothing could separate the teams at half-time, but Tottenham would come out of the blocks looking sharper, with Kane netting his second and third goals in quick succession. Ange Postecoglou's (pictured) side looked dangerous today, but are likely to be bringing in some more new faces this week, including Alejo Veliz and Micky van de Ven Kevin Kelsy (front middle) scored a fantastic header just before the break for the away side, capitalising on a fast cross to level the scores heading into the break Kane (middle) came back soon after, scoring a quick fire brace of goals to secure his hat-trick But he wasn't done there with the England striker scoring his fourth goal, gambling at the far post to knock in a rebound He would be replaced by 19-year-old Dane Scarlett (right) who finished off the scoring with a thumping effort Spurs will now take on Barcelona in a mid-week pre-season friendly before they travel to play Brentford next week MATCH FACTS TOTTENHAM: (4-2-3-1) Vicario; Udogie, Davies, Romero, Emerson Royal; Hojberg, Sarr (Skipp 87'); Son (Solomon 78'), Maddison (Lo Celso 77'), Kulusevski; Kane (Scarlett 80').

Five minutes later, the 30-year-old would then find himself one-on-one with the keeper, latching onto a lovely through-ball from Dejan Kulusevski, to net his hat-trick. He wasn't done there though, gambling at the far post to tap in a rebound and put his side 4-1 up on the 79th minute. Dane Scarlett, who came on to replace the forward in the 80th minute, completed the quartet of goals, with the 19-year-old solidifying the win with a powerful effort into the bottom-right corner of the goal. Tottenham have one final pre-season game away to Barcelona this week, before they take on Brentford next Sunday in their first game of the new Premier League season.

Plumptre, who three weeks in the past left Leicester after making 79 appearances for the Women’s Super League facet, grew up with a half-Nigerian dad whose personal father was born in Lagos. The defender stated: “For me, it wasn’t difficult because I knew exactly what I wanted from football and I think that just came down from understanding who I am. On my journey, I’ve learned more about myself and I know what I want from football. “And I always say, ‘for me, it’s more than just playing.’ It sounds really weird but I always say I’m not obsessed with football, specifically, I’m obsessed with what I can learn about myself from playing. “And that’s why playing for Nigeria would probably be the most fulfilling thing I could do. “Not to say that my experiences were ever bad with England, they never were, but it was just more that my life went on a different course. “And I’m like, hmm, this is important for me, for my sister, for my family and for the young people who identify as being mixed heritage.” In an interview for the Nigerian Football Federation, Plumptre describes her youthful half-sister Bayleigh Bisi as having a darker pores and skin tone and completely different hair texture, which initially led to her extra strongly resonating with their Nigerian heritage. Plumptre feels her personal journey is entwined together with her sibling’s – going as far as to say that the street to this World Cup, which noticed world quantity 40 Nigeria oust Olympic champions Canada en path to the knockouts, is one shared by them each. She added: “I feel like people have different reasons for wanting to play for a different country. “For me, obviously, I grew up playing for England and I enjoyed my time with them but I always say it was always more of a life decision than a football decision. “I felt like I had a responsibility to try and play for Nigeria, if I could. “And that just came from experiences within family. I’ve got my younger sister, I used to coach an under-12s team with girls with mixed heritage girls, and I feel like I have a responsibility to learn about my heritage and I have the privilege of being able to play football and use that to be able to learn, so it came about like that for me.” Nigeria have contested all 9 World Cups, reaching the quarter-finals in 1999. Should they want to equal or higher that feat they must discover their well beyond European champions England. Plumptre is ready to face the Lionesses, a facet which incorporates a number of former team-mates. She stated: “I was like, ‘it’s gonna end up that way’. I know a lot of the players, I grew up playing with a lot of them, play against them. So I would completely relish that opportunity.

ALSO READ: How Khune’s height hindered overseas move The game took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, with the stands nearly packed, and provided the supporters with some nervous moments before the final whistle sealed the sharing of points. On the other side, Chiefs coach, Molefi Ntseki, might not be as jubilant, as his team showed glimpses of potential but lacked creativity in the attacking third. This can however be attributed to it being their first game of the season and the presence of several new players in the squad. Out of the eight new signings, Ntseki opted to start with four: Given Msimango, Thatayaone Dithlokwe, Edson Castillo, and Ranga Chivaviro. During the first half, both teams managed to create a few chances, but poor decision-making and some rustiness led to wasted opportunities. The defenders and goalkeepers stood strong, ensuring that no goals were conceded by halftime, despite the promising build-up play. The second half saw an increase in excitement, with both sides displaying adventurous football in their quest for a victorious start to the season. Chippa, however, made more meaningful entries into the box, putting pressure on Chiefs’ debutant defender, Given Msimango, who had to work diligently to prevent his team from conceding. Changes bring some positive moves for Chiefs With a little over 20 minutes remaining on the clock, Ntseki decided to make a double substitution, introducing Mduduzi Mdantsane in place of Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Tebogo Potsane to replace Ranga Chivaviro. This tactical move seemed to work in Chiefs’ favour, as they started executing some excellent passes and creating dangerous situations.

The title-holders dominated the opening 90 minutes but a breakthrough proved elusive with Swedish goalkeeper Zecira Musovic making some startling saves to keep her side alive. With the 0-0 deadlock remaining after extra-time it went to penalties in Melbourne — and the tension went up another notch. Sweden’s Nathalie Bjorn was the first to miss, skying high, only for Megan Rapinoe to do the same. Rebecka Blomqvist’s effort was saved, again putting the USA in the driving seat, only for Sophia Smith to blast wide. When Kelley O’Hara hit the post, it was all down to Sweden’s Lina Hurtig, who made sure — but only after VAR ruled her kick had crossed the line. For the Americans, who just never really got going at this tournament, it ended their dreams of a third World Cup title in a row in the most painful fashion. It was also an inglorious end for Rapinoe, the Golden Boot winner at the 2019 tournament. She will retire at the end of the season. “This is like a sick joke. For me personally, I’m just like, this is dark comedy. I missed a penalty,” Rapinoe told Fox Sports. “I think it can be cruel and just not our day.” She added: “I thought we played really well. I’m so happy for us that we went out like that, playing the way that we did.” Expectations were high coming into the tournament for the four-time champions, who had made at least the semi-finals at every World Cup. But they never looked up to the task in the group stage, with just one win, against Vietnam. The dramatic conclusion leaves the tournament without the two top-ranked sides after Germany’s group-stage departure. This devastating early exit will be seen as a major underachievement for the Americans, who have been the superpower of international women’s football for so long. Vlatko Andonovski made two changes from the US team that drew 0-0 against Portugal, with Emily Sonnett in for suspended midfielder Rose Lavelle and Trinity Rodman preferred up front to Lynn Williams. Sweden rested nine players in their last group game, but reverted to their strongest XI with strikers Fridolina Rolfo and Stina Blackstenius returning and Musovic getting the nod as goalkeeper ahead of Jennifer Falk. After both sides sized each other up, the USA worked the first clear chance on six minutes, but Andi Sullivan’s drive from the edge of the box skewered wide. A patient Sweden created space early on, particularly on the flanks, and sent in a series of teasing crosses to use their height advantage, to no avail. As the game wore on the US assumed midfield control and a livewire Rodman went close to the opener after 18 minutes, letting fly from distance with Musovic palming away. She was forced into a similar stop minutes later, again from Rodman, but could only watch as a towering Lindsey Horan header rattled the crossbar in the best opportunity of a lively half the US dominated. The title-holders carried the momentum into the second stanza and only a world-class reflex save from Musovic kept Sweden on level terms, turning a vicious strike from Horan around the post at full stretch. It was all the United States and a goal seemed inevitable, but Musovic again kept Sweden in the game with another cracking save in the 88th minute, this time from Alex Morgan. She pulled off two more brilliant saves in extra-time to take the match to penalties.","pubDate":"2023-08-06 15:10:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsenal 1-1 Man City (4-1 on pens): Gunners start the season with a trophy as Aaron Ramsdale's shootout save seals Community Shield win over title rivals at Wembley after 101st-minute leveller","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12378545/Man-City-1-1-Arsenal-Arsenal-win-4-1-penalties-Kevin-Bruyne-Rodri-MISS-penalties-Gunners-win-Community-Sheild-Leandro-Trossard-equalised-11TH-MINUTE-stoppage-time-following-Cole-Palmers-opener.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal have won the Community Shield on penalties after Kevin de Bruyne and Rodri missed from the spot in a shoot-out following a dramatic end to the match.","content":"Arsenal 1-1 Man City (4-1 on pens): Gunners start the season with a trophy as Aaron Ramsdale's shootout save seals Community Shield win over title rivals at Wembley after 101st-minute leveller Palmer opened the scoring off the bench, combining with Kevin de Bruyne Trossard netted a dramatic late equaliser in the 11th-minute of stoppage time De Bruyne hit the crossbar with his penalty as Aaron Ramsdale saved Rodri's By Nick Emms For Mailonline Updated: 18:34 BST, 6 August 2023 e-mail 5 shares 25 View comments Arsenal have won the Community Shield on penalties after Kevin de Bruyne and Rodri missed from the spot in a shoot-out. Arsenal 's new signing Declan Rice , Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber all started but were unable to make a real impact as Man City came away victorious. Havertz tested Stefan Ortega twice in the first half but was unable to convert either of his chances. The breakthrough came after Pep Guardiola made several changes, with De Bruyne and Palmer coming on and the pair linked up to secure the win for Man City as Palmer converted in the 77th minute for the Citizens. However, there was drama at the very end, with Leandro Trossard netting an equaliser in the 11th-minute of stoppage time. Cole Palmer netted the opening goal of the match for Manchester City at Wembley Leandro Trossard scored in the 11th-minute of added time as he took the game to penalties Kevin de Bruyne smashed the crossbar with his penalty after coming off the bench With the clash heading straight to a penalty shoot-out, it was De Bruyne up first for City, following Martin Odegaard's conversion - and the Belgian smashed his effort against the crossbar. Goalscorer Trossard followed next and sent Ortega the wrong way to convert his spot-kick before Bernardo Silva followed and did the same. Bukayo Saka scored his effort calmly as Arsneal were in control. Rodri was up next for City but saw his effort saved by Aaron Ramsdale before Fabio Vieira hit his strike into the top corner to give Arteta's side the victory. More to follow...

Kane put the uncertainty over his future to at least one aspect to supply a basic show of predatory ending in what might show to be his ultimate look in Spurs’ colors. Bayern are reported to have lodged their newest provide for Kane on Friday and an obvious self-imposed deadline of midnight was set by the German membership, however there was no additional information on the result of that bid and Kane grabbed a hat-trick in 55 minutes of a 5-1 pleasant win over Shakhtar. Kane added one other purpose within the 79th-minute earlier than he left the pitch a minute later to a standing ovation following extra chants of ‘he’s certainly one of our personal’ and on the conclusion of the conflict the membership’s report goal-scorer walked across the pitch to clap all 4 corners of the bottom in what felt a major second. “We know there’s one deadline and that’s the end of the transfer window,” Postecoglou identified. “Beyond that, I’m in open dialogue with Harry and with the club on a regular basis. I’ve said to them that if the status quo changes then inform me. “I don’t need to know about the comings and goings in between. I just want to deal with what’s in front of me because, irrespective of the outcome of that, I’m building a team here. I can’t wait (around) for a decision either way to get going. “We don’t have the time or the luxury to do that. I’m working with what’s in front of me. You saw today that Harry certainly is invested in what we’re doing and we’ll keep on doing that unless something changes.” Bayern have been public about their want to signal Kane all summer season, with their honorary president Uli Hoeness and president Herbert Hainer speaking brazenly within the media final month about attempting to signal the England captain. We know there’s one deadline and that is the tip of the switch window Postecoglou added: “That’s up to Bayern to decide. If that’s the way they want to conduct things, it’s not up to me to judge that. “It doesn’t affect me. I don’t sit there on a daily basis and worry about what other clubs are doing. “I think what is factual right now is that he is a contracted player of our football club. “I certainly wouldn’t talk about contracted players at other football clubs but I’m not at Bayern mate so they can go the way they want.” While lots of the concentrate on Sunday was on Kane, amongst the spectators at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was Wolfsburg centre-back Micky van de Ven. Netherlands defender Van de Ven is scheduled to have a medical at Spurs’ coaching floor on Monday. But requested about Van de Ven, Postecoglou replied: “It hasn’t been done yet, so it’s not right for me to talk about but there’s no doubt we need some bolstering in that central defensive area. “Hopefully we’ll get one or two done in the next couple of days to bolster us in that area.” While Van de Ven’s future appears to be like sure to be at Tottenham, Kane’s membership for this marketing campaign stays up within the air. Postecoglou refused to be drawn into the importance of Kane strolling alone to applaud all 4 corners of the stadium at full-time. “You are reading something into it, aren’t you,” he added. “I don’t even know what’s in Harry’s mind, let alone anyone else’s. I think all these things will obviously play out over the next period, we’ll deal with what happens from there. “From my perspective, I’ve got a team to build here. Today showed me that we’ve made some progress but there’s still a lot of work to do. “There were areas today I wasn’t delighted with, so we need to make sure we focus on getting this team right. We’ll see what happens after that. “He’s a fantastic striker, one of the world’s best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that.” Biden comforts USA ladies’s soccer group after heartbreaking World Cup defeat","pubDate":"2023-08-06 17:15:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"businesslend","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Newcastle's £52million star Sandro Tonali has demonstrated his vision and precision in abundance during pre-season, but the Italian has hard work ahead of him","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12378399/Newcastles-52million-star-Sandro-Tonali-demonstrated-vision-precision-abundance-pre-season-Italian-hard-work-ahead-him.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CRAIG HOPE: Sandro Tonali has shown what he can do for Newcastle - the class and vision are glaring - but this summer has also shown what he needs to do.","content":"Newcastle's £52m star Sandro Tonali has demonstrated his vision and precision in pre-season, but the Italian has hard work ahead of him as Eddie Howe moulds him for the intensity of Premier League life By Craig Hope Updated: 13:00 EDT, 6 August 2023 e-mail 2 View comments Sandro Tonali has shown what he can do for Newcastle - the class and vision are glaring - but this summer has also shown what he needs to do. Eddie Howe ’s midfielders run in all directions, and they run hard. They track runners and, at the other end, give their opponents a runner to track. On his debut, against an average Rangers side last month, the £52million arrival from Milan was the best player on the park. When the team flew to the United States from Glasgow the following morning , staff were eulogising over his qualities - he saw things a second quicker than everyone else and his precision was close to perfect. But then, against Premier League opposition in the States and with players such as Aston Villa’s John McGinn and Emiliano Buendia biting at his heels, those skills were muzzled. Sandro Tonali joined Newcastle for a fee of £52million from Serie A side AC Milan this summer History shows that Italians don't fare well in the Premier League, so he'll need time to adapt Newcastle celebrated a 2-1 victory over Scottish team Rangers, as well as beating Fiorentina 2-0 in a later pre-season friendly thanks to goals from Miguel Almiron and Alexander Isak This was a different game now. Backroom staff in the US noted how Tonali would need time to make the transition from Serie A. One week on from the excitement of Ibrox, there was now caution. On Saturday, against Fiorentina - a team he knows well - Tonali looked more like the version he presented at Rangers. The problem is, Newcastle don’t play teams from Italy and Scotland every week. It was, then, telling when Howe later said: ‘Out of possession, it was a step up on his recent performances, which was good to see.’ The longer Tonali is exposed to Howe, the better it will make him. That improvement, coupled with acclimatisation, should see a top player emerge, the one who those behind the scenes are convinced was the best of their midfield targets this close-season. There is risk, though. History tells us that Italians have not fared well in the Premier League. And, on the evidence of recent weeks, Tonali has work to do, a fact acknowledged by Howe. ‘We are working on every aspect of his game,’ he said. ‘For Sandro, the Premier League is different. 'He would have found that in the few games he played in America, where there was a step up - just the speed, sharpness, where opponents place themselves. The Newcastle boss added, 'we have to be solid defensively if we are to have success. Tonali struggled to show his impressive skills against Premier League opposition Aston Villa in the States, with players such as John McGinn and Emiliano Buendia biting at his heels ‘We are working on every aspect of his game,’ Howe said. ‘The Premier League is different' ‌’He’s a combiner, he’s going to need relationships to show his best qualities. In time, those will grow and we will see the player I know he is going to be. 'He was very good (against Fiorentina). I was pleased with Sandro, he played as an 8 and a 6 and was composed in possession. With Tonali, composed in possession is a given. Dogged and diligent when out of it is the challenge.

The Manchester City striker and Arsenal midfielder were booked for kicking the ball away while Arteta was shown a yellow for dissent, all in the first half of the Community Shield clash. Arsenal's manager had demanded a booking for Rodri after his tackle on Kai Havertz , brandishing his own imaginary card, but found himself reprimanded by referee Stuart Attwell. Harsh crackdowns on time-wasting and abuse are central to new refereeing guidelines, with stoppage time added set to run into double digits. The new measures will apply across the Premier League and EFL. Mikel Arteta was booked for dissent in the first half of the Community Shield final Thomas Partey and Julian Alvarez were also put on the naughty step after kicking the ball away One official told Sky Sports News that most matches will last longer than 100 minutes. Similar to what was seen in the World Cup, officials will add on a more realistic reflection of time lost due to conniving measures. It comes after the International Football Association Board (IFAB) met in March and decided referees should follow the style of officiating seen in Qatar . Last season, the ball was in play in Premier League matches for the lowest amount of time per match in 12 years , with live play only taking place for 54 minutes and 53 seconds. While some lost time is natural, time-wasting also contributes to the dearth of action, particularly in the latter stages of matches when teams try to defend leads at all costs.

The Round of 16 clash saw World Cup favourites USA knocked out by Sweden after the matche ended 0-0 after 90 minutes and extra-time. Heading to penalties, nobody could have predicted the drama to follow as Lina Huryig stepped up for her strike. The Sweden star saw her penalty saved by Alyssa Naeher but the 35-year-old goalkeeper could only spill the ball onto the line. Reacting quickly, Naeher palmed the ball off the goal line but VAR showed that the ball had crossed the line by millimeters.

With the USA out, England have been handed a huge boost in their search of World Cup glory but know they must progress past a tough Nigeria side tomorrow morning. Sarina Wiegman's side are one of the favourites for the competition but will be keen to avoid a slip up like the USA had against Sweden. A less dramatic victory tomorrow will see England progress into the quarter-final stages as they look to bring the trophy home. It's back to the drawing board for the USWNT, who failed to score past Sweden despite creating several chances in the match.

The England forward put up a captain's performance today, scoring four times to help his side defeat Shakhtar 5-1 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday. It comes as Daniel Levy had this week ignored Bayern Munich's deadline on an £86million offer to sign the club's all-time leading goal-scorer, with Mail Sport revealing he could stay at the club this summer. Kane is now coming into the final year of his contract at Tottenham and depending on whether he stays or leaves, it seems Spurs will continue to stock up on new talent, with Ange Postecoglou 's side now on the cusp of signing Alejo Veliz in a £12m deal from Rosario Central . As the London side continue to build their squad ahead of the new Premier League season, with defender Micky van de Ven also due in London this week for a medical, they certainly look to be firing pretty well considering today's resounding victory against Shakhtar. Harry Kane (pictured) scored a quartet of goals as Tottenham defeated Shakhtar 5-1 in a pre-season friendly on Sunday Kane scored a penalty in the first half to give his side the lead, but the visitors soon equalised before the break His impressive performance comes amid much uncertainty on his future at the London club, with Bayern Munich continuing their attempts to sign him But they were made to work for the win in the first 45 minutes. Their first goal came on the 38th minute after James Maddison was brought down inside the penalty area. Kane stepped up to score his fifth goal of their summer warm up games, and his first of the match, placing his ball into the bottom right corner of the goal, narrowly evading Shakhtar goalkeeper Dmytro Riznyk, who had come on to replace Andrij Pyatov. Pyatov, 39, was playing in the final game of his career today and the long-time club captain was given a guard of honour by his team-mates after he was substituted in the 17th minute. Despite Tottenham looking more in control, Shakhtar struck back just before the break, with Kevin Kelsy scoring a very well taken header, connecting with a fast cross into the penalty area from Danylo Sikan. Nothing could separate the teams at half-time, but Tottenham would come out of the blocks looking sharper, with Kane netting his second and third goals in quick succession. Ange Postecoglou's (pictured) side looked dangerous today, but are likely to be bringing in some more new faces this week, including Alejo Veliz and Micky van de Ven Kevin Kelsy (front middle) scored a fantastic header just before the break for the away side, capitalising on a fast cross to level the scores heading into the break Kane (middle) came back soon after, scoring a quick fire brace of goals to secure his hat-trick But he wasn't done there with the England striker scoring his fourth goal, gambling at the far post to knock in a rebound He would be replaced by 19-year-old Dane Scarlett (right) who finished off the scoring with a thumping effort Spurs will now take on Barcelona in a mid-week pre-season friendly before they travel to play Brentford next week MATCH FACTS TOTTENHAM: (4-2-3-1) Vicario; Udogie, Davies, Romero, Emerson Royal; Hojberg, Sarr (Skipp 87'); Son (Solomon 78'), Maddison (Lo Celso 77'), Kulusevski; Kane (Scarlett 80').

Five minutes later, the 30-year-old would then find himself one-on-one with the keeper, latching onto a lovely through-ball from Dejan Kulusevski, to net his hat-trick. He wasn't done there though, gambling at the far post to tap in a rebound and put his side 4-1 up on the 79th minute. Dane Scarlett, who came on to replace the forward in the 80th minute, completed the quartet of goals, with the 19-year-old solidifying the win with a powerful effort into the bottom-right corner of the goal. Tottenham have one final pre-season game away to Barcelona this week, before they take on Brentford next Sunday in their first game of the new Premier League season.

ALSO READ: How Khune’s height hindered overseas move The game took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, with the stands nearly packed, and provided the supporters with some nervous moments before the final whistle sealed the sharing of points. On the other side, Chiefs coach, Molefi Ntseki, might not be as jubilant, as his team showed glimpses of potential but lacked creativity in the attacking third. This can however be attributed to it being their first game of the season and the presence of several new players in the squad. Out of the eight new signings, Ntseki opted to start with four: Given Msimango, Thatayaone Dithlokwe, Edson Castillo, and Ranga Chivaviro. During the first half, both teams managed to create a few chances, but poor decision-making and some rustiness led to wasted opportunities. The defenders and goalkeepers stood strong, ensuring that no goals were conceded by halftime, despite the promising build-up play. The second half saw an increase in excitement, with both sides displaying adventurous football in their quest for a victorious start to the season. Chippa, however, made more meaningful entries into the box, putting pressure on Chiefs’ debutant defender, Given Msimango, who had to work diligently to prevent his team from conceding. Changes bring some positive moves for Chiefs With a little over 20 minutes remaining on the clock, Ntseki decided to make a double substitution, introducing Mduduzi Mdantsane in place of Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Tebogo Potsane to replace Ranga Chivaviro. This tactical move seemed to work in Chiefs’ favour, as they started executing some excellent passes and creating dangerous situations.

They later reverted to long balls into the box, looking for Christian Saile and Ashely Du Preez. Overall, the game showcased both teams’ potential and areas that require improvement as they embark on the new season’s journey. For now, the coaches will assess the performances and work towards strengthening their teams for the upcoming matches.

The title-holders dominated the opening 90 minutes but a breakthrough proved elusive with Swedish goalkeeper Zecira Musovic making some startling saves to keep her side alive. With the 0-0 deadlock remaining after extra-time it went to penalties in Melbourne — and the tension went up another notch. Sweden’s Nathalie Bjorn was the first to miss, skying high, only for Megan Rapinoe to do the same. Rebecka Blomqvist’s effort was saved, again putting the USA in the driving seat, only for Sophia Smith to blast wide. When Kelley O’Hara hit the post, it was all down to Sweden’s Lina Hurtig, who made sure — but only after VAR ruled her kick had crossed the line. For the Americans, who just never really got going at this tournament, it ended their dreams of a third World Cup title in a row in the most painful fashion. It was also an inglorious end for Rapinoe, the Golden Boot winner at the 2019 tournament. She will retire at the end of the season. “This is like a sick joke. For me personally, I’m just like, this is dark comedy. I missed a penalty,” Rapinoe told Fox Sports. “I think it can be cruel and just not our day.” She added: “I thought we played really well. I’m so happy for us that we went out like that, playing the way that we did.” Expectations were high coming into the tournament for the four-time champions, who had made at least the semi-finals at every World Cup. But they never looked up to the task in the group stage, with just one win, against Vietnam. The dramatic conclusion leaves the tournament without the two top-ranked sides after Germany’s group-stage departure. This devastating early exit will be seen as a major underachievement for the Americans, who have been the superpower of international women’s football for so long. Vlatko Andonovski made two changes from the US team that drew 0-0 against Portugal, with Emily Sonnett in for suspended midfielder Rose Lavelle and Trinity Rodman preferred up front to Lynn Williams. Sweden rested nine players in their last group game, but reverted to their strongest XI with strikers Fridolina Rolfo and Stina Blackstenius returning and Musovic getting the nod as goalkeeper ahead of Jennifer Falk. After both sides sized each other up, the USA worked the first clear chance on six minutes, but Andi Sullivan’s drive from the edge of the box skewered wide. A patient Sweden created space early on, particularly on the flanks, and sent in a series of teasing crosses to use their height advantage, to no avail. As the game wore on the US assumed midfield control and a livewire Rodman went close to the opener after 18 minutes, letting fly from distance with Musovic palming away. She was forced into a similar stop minutes later, again from Rodman, but could only watch as a towering Lindsey Horan header rattled the crossbar in the best opportunity of a lively half the US dominated. The title-holders carried the momentum into the second stanza and only a world-class reflex save from Musovic kept Sweden on level terms, turning a vicious strike from Horan around the post at full stretch. It was all the United States and a goal seemed inevitable, but Musovic again kept Sweden in the game with another cracking save in the 88th minute, this time from Alex Morgan. She pulled off two more brilliant saves in extra-time to take the match to penalties.","pubDate":"2023-08-06 15:10:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"}]}
