In fact, last season, he bagged 10 goals and seven assists in the league and was one of the Hornets‚Äô star players. He‚Äôll obviously want to leave for a top-flight side and there are no surprises that he‚Äôs open to moving to Marseille. However, should Everton come knocking at his door, there‚Äôs a very good case to be made for the 25-year-old to move to Goodison Park. Sean Dyche will absolutely love him as he can play on either flank, down the middle and even as a number 10. In fact, in the four games he played in that shadow striker role last season, he scored one and provided two assists so that could be a role he could thrive in playing behind the striker in a 4-2-3-1 system.","pubDate":"2023-07-22 20:54:45","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2022/08/resized-image-Promo-1-1-1024x703.jpeg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How to Watch Arsenal vs Manchester United Live Streaming Online?

Ed Carruthers Host commentator 21:57 Is now the time to deliver for Mikel Arteta Tonight‚Äôs match will present a very big measuring stick for Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side to see where they are. With new faces in the squad the Arsenal manager has put up a strong side to take on Erik ten Hag‚Äôs team. But after the disappointment of last season with Arsenal falling short of the Premier League title, the club have been spending in the transfer window and have brought in some very exciting talents. Jurrien Timber, Declan Rice and Kai Havertz will all start tonight and it is an interesting night for the Gunners fans out there to see how they get on tonight. Havertz is perhaps. The most interesting of the three, having scored in his last outing for the Gunners in their 5-0 win against the MLS All Stars. If he gets back to his form of old he could be a pivotal player for Arteta this season. It will also be very interesting to see how Declan Rice fits in alongside Martin Odegaard and Jorginho tonight, after the former West Ham captain made his debut for the club last week. Arsenal's ¬£200m spending spree means Mikel Arteta MUST now deliver ISAAN KHAN IN NEW JERSEY: Arteta knows he must go one step further after being handed the tools he requested. There is a strength in depth to this squad that has not been there in recent years. Mail Online 21:43 Takeover talk: Avram Glazer turns up at United's US training camp Interestingly, Avram Glazer turned up at United's training camp and met with Erik ten Hag earlier this week. United are still in the midst of a takeover, and the Dutch manager told the media that he would be happy to give his 'advice and recommendations' to the owners over the takeover saga. More below... Man United owner Avram Glazer turns up at club's US training camp CHRIS WHEELER IN NEW JERSEY: Glazer has been the most visible member of the family, turning up at the finals of the FA Cup and Carabao Cup last season as well as the Women's FA Cup final. Mail Online 21:40 A busy week for Erik ten Hag Erik ten Hag has certainly had plenty to think about this week. The Man United boss ticked off another box bringing Andre Onana into his squad following David de Gea's departure. He also stripped Harry Maguire of the captains arm band and gave the leadership duties to Bruno Fernandes. But the Dutch manager is still hoping to make a few more signings before the end of the transfer window with United hoping to bring in a new striker following the departure of Wout Weghorst last season. Weghorst failed to score goals up top and the Red Devils are eyeing up Rasmus Hojlund as a replacement. In fact, the Dutch manager yesterday vowed that he would be signing a striker this summer despite the club being frustrated by Atalanta's ¬£86million price tag. ‚ÄòWe will do everything that's in our power to get the right man in,‚Äô said Ten Hag. ‚ÄòYou never know in the transfer market, but we know our targets and we‚Äôll do everything we can. We put every effort in to get this done because it's an area where we need improvement. ‚ÄòWe proved also last season we can be very successful even though we didn't have too many strikers. I expect more from the front players, a high level. They have to raise the bar and we expect more goals.‚Äô Erik ten Hag vows Man United 'will do everything' to sign a striker CHRIS WHEELER: United have acquired midfielder Mason Mount and goalkeeper Andre Onana in this transfer window, but Ten Hag has made signing a new centre-forward a priority.

The shot-stopper jetted into New Jersey on Friday after completing his ¬£47million move from Inter Milan.

It is a strong midfield trio from Arteta, but he‚Äôs also named Jurrien Timber at right-back, following his impressive game against the MLS All Stars. One of his greatest attributes is his passing ability and it could be a sign to come from Mikel Arteta, with Timber‚Äôs versatility giving him another option in defence alongside William Sailba, Gabriel and Takehiro Tomiyasu.

An eighth-minute goal from Yira Sor and a late hit from Tolu Arokodare saw the Belgians over the line on a frustrating evening for Vincent Kompany . James Trafford made his debut between the sticks for the Lancashire outfit after signing for ¬£19m from Manchester City but could not carry his clean sheets record from the U21s Euros into this game. Striker Zeki Amdouni, who recently signed from Basel after 22 goals there last season , came on as a substitute, while Andros Townsend featured as a trialist. It was a nightmare start for the Clarets when Sor converted just eight minutes after kick-off, following up after Angelo Preciado's effort was blocked. James Trafford, pictured after winning the U21s Euros with England, debuted as Burnley lost Vincent Kompany's side are preparing for their first season back in the Premier League after winning the Championship Josh Brownhill looked to get his side back in it around 16 minutes in but saw his attempted denied by a defender's legs. Scott Twine was a lively presence for Burnley and could have scored in either half. He rapped a half-volley wide of the mark early into the second half. The hosts almost added a second when new signing Christopher Bonsu Baah smacked a long-range attempt, but it went wide. But Genk got their reward for persistence in the closing minutes as Arokodare found the net for the home side in their last pre-season friendly.

Tottenham striker's wife, Kate, has been 'looking at properties in Munich' as Bayern edge closer to signing England star Harry Kane's wife, Kate, has reportedly been looking at properties in Munich It comes as the Tottenham star is edging closer to an exit from the London club Bayern Munich are leading the race and are set to table a third offer this week By Ed Carruthers For Mailonline Updated: 21:07 BST, 22 July 2023 e-mail 5 shares 13 View comments Harry Kane's wife, Kate, has sensationally been reported to be 'looking at properties in Munich' as the Tottenham star edges closer to a move to Bayern Munich. The German club are currently leading the race to sign him after Daniel Levy slapped a ¬£100million valuation on the England captain, deterring many other clubs including Manchester United off from signing him . But that valuation has not stopped the German champions from tabling bids for Kane, with Thomas Tuchel's side set to make their third offer for him this week , after having their previous bids of ¬£60m and an improved price of ¬£70m rejected . The striker, who turns 30 this week, travelled with Ange Postecoglou's side to Asia and could feature in Sunday's pre-season friendly against Leicester in Thailand. The Australian manager on Saturday admitted in a press conference that he expects the club's all-time top scorer to stay despite interest from Bayern and is planning for next season with Kane in his squad. Harry Kane (pictured) is edging closer to a move to Bayern Munich with the German champions set to make their third bid to sign him But a report from German outlet Bild has claimed that his wife, Kate (right), has been looking at properties in Munich Thomas Tuchel's (pictured) side have already offered ¬£70million to sign Kane but are set to improve that bid and submit a third offer this week But in a sensational report from Bild , Kane's wife has been reportedly 'looking at properties in Munich and the district of Grunwald in Bavaria.' The German news outlet are also claiming that other members of Kane's family have been in the German city 'in the past few days to look at international schools and properties'. Kane and his partner married in 2019 and are known childhood sweethearts. The pair have three children together and have recently announced that they are expecting a fourth . Questions have been mounting over whether the 29-year-old should move to Germany , with the Spurs striker still able to break Alan Shearer's record of being the Premier League's all-time leading goal scorer. Kane (pictured) travelled with Tottenham's pre-season training squad to Asia and could feature in tomorrow's friendly against Leicester But the German side seems to be Kane's preferred option after Mail Sport reported this week that he would not be keen on a move to Paris Saint Germain . In any event, while Spurs are hopeful he will stay, they are making contingency plans for life without the England captain. Levy is reportedly stepping up plans to bring in Fiorentina's Arthur Cabral , a robust forward who scored 19 goals in 64 appearances since moving to Italy in January 2022. Kane's contract will expire in 2024 with Tottenham having already tabled a very lucrative deal to try and keep him at the club.

Cook, who was released by the Vikings in the spring, also asked his former partner to deny the abuse accusation with a sworn affidavit and that she send league officials a letter clearing his name of any wrongdoing in exchange for the six-figure cash offer. Tremble alleges that Cook abused her, caused a brain injury, and held her hostage at his home in a suburb of Minneapolis in November 2020. She claims that she flew into Minnesota's capital to break up with the football player and to collect her belongings. Free agent running back Dalvin Cook is facing domestic violence claims from a 2020 lawsuit Gracelyn Trimble - Cook's ex - claims she was offered $800k than $1M to stay quiet by Cook Trimble also alleges that she was physically and mentally abused several times by the NFL star Instead, Cook 'grabbed her by her arm and slung her whole body over the couch, slamming her face into the coffee table and causing her lower forehead and the bridge of her nose to bust open,' according to legal papers recently filed in Dakota-County District Court, first obtained by The Minneapolis Star-Tribune . Details of the filing are sealed. DailyMail.com has contacted both parties' attorneys for immediate comment. Timber also alleges that Cook followed her upstairs when she went to clean off the blood, throwing her down and pinning her to the ground before punching and choking her. He then allegedly grabbed his rifle and yelled death threats while holding her at gunpoint, according to the filing. What's more is that Timber claims that Cook beat her with a broomstick, threw her against a wall and kicked her in the hips and ribs while she laid on the ground before she ran out of his home in search of help. He later got her back into the house and confiscated her phone, the filing reports. Police were not called to the scene, a the time of the incident.

Cook, who is seeking $10M as a free agent this offseason, countersued for fraud and defamation. A police report was only filed in May of last year after the pair broke up 'for good,' according to The New York Post . Cook was involved in all of the Vikings' 17 NFL games last season, rushing for 1,173 yards. His agent, Zac Hiller, flirted with the Jets in a recent podcast interview, saying the franchise has 'a great thing going' after trading for Aaron Rodgers. But, for Cook to join New York, he would have to decrease his salary demands. The Jets have Michael Carter and Breece Hall as their only two running backs for this upcoming season.

Young, who played alongside Sean Dyche when he began his career at Watford two decades ago, describe his decision to join Everton as a 'no-brainer' after being released by Aston Villa . And despite the cynics claiming the move only highlighted Everton's financial predicament, the former Manchester United , Inter Milan and England star enjoyed a fantastic debut yesterday as a winger, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win at Wigan. Tougher challenges like ahead for sure. Everton have been perilously close to relegation in each of the last two seasons and they need to survive on a relative shoestring for one more season in order to move into their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in August 2024 as a Premier League club. The club haven't paid a transfer fee for a permanent signing in the last two transfer windows and are in special measures having reported heavy financial losses over three years. Ashley Young joined Everton for free this summer after being released by Aston Villa The 38-year-old is adamant former team-mate Sean Dyche can help turn the Toffees' fortunes But Young is adamant having agreed his move to Merseyside that the Everton glass should remain half-full because of Dyche being at the helm. After all, he's a manager used to punching above his weight at Burnley and three of his squad at Turf Moore ‚Äì Dwight McNeil, James Tarkowski and Michael Keane ‚Äì are now at Goodison. 'When I played alongside Sean, I could tell he would go into management. He has that winning mentality, that spark when he walks into a dressing-room, you're aware of that presence,' he explains. 'Him and Everton is a good match and from what I've seen so far, all the players are willing to buy into it 'I knew he wanted me at Burnley before I went to Aston Villa so it was extra pull to join Everton besides the fans, players and size of the club. 'Obviously the last two seasons haven't gone as well as they should but he has the mentality to take the club higher up the table where they should be. 'The last couple of years wasn't going to put me off joining. When you put a challenge in front of me, I go full throttle. Monaco-based Farhad Moshiri (pictured) has been an absentee owner in recent years Dyche wanted watched the U21s team play on Saturday to see what he's got coming through 'They've not had a settled manager but what Sean gives, I'm feeling positive.' Certainly, Everton need some of that positivity from Young. They've become a selling club over recent times and Monaco-based Farhad Moshiri an absentee owner. He's had to take on loans to secure the building of the stadium which has impacted on the playing squad. Fans were so discontented, directors didn't go to Goodison for the second part of last season. They played well at Wigan on Saturday but it was significant assistant Ian Woan took charge because Dyche wanted to see the under-21s team play instead to see what he's got coming through. The absences of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Amadou Onana with injuries will also be concerning given the Premier League begins in three weeks. Demarai Gray has been given time off after playing for Jamaica in the Gold Cup and he may or may not return given there is interest from other clubs. Luckily for Everton, Young is Mr Versatility and having spent his latter years as a wing-back, he looked good as a left-sided attacker, even breaking into the box to hit the winner after 63 minutes before gaining a standing ovation from hundreds of Evertonians when he was substituted later on. 'It is fluid where I'll be used. As a player you have to be ready to play in different positions,' said Young. Young (centre) insists he can't wait to play in front of the Goodison crowd next season 'I am one of those players who gives 100 per cent whatever position the manager wants. I can't wait to get to Goodison and play for the badge. I know the home fans are loud and noisy and will give everything back to you. When you get a chance to play for a big club like Everton it was a no-brainer.' One of Young's happiest Goodison memories was scoring the winner for Villa which prompted Martin O'Neill to label him a 'genius'. Everton will need a few of those this season though fans should also remember the third line of their club song which begins 'And If you know your history' The last time things looked this bleak, in 2004 when they finished 17th and then sold Wayne Rooney, David Moyes battened down the hatches the following season and Everton surprised everyone to finish in the top four!

The party line from those within the club highlighted how much of an achievement it was for Arsenal to push Manchester City right to the wire. Besides, the north London club had finished fifth the season before ‚Äì they had last finished runners-up in 2015-16 under Arsene Wenger. This was a stark improvement. But, in reality, Arteta and Co knew they had scuppered a golden chance. It was in their hands ‚Äî until they secured three consecutive draws and a humiliation to City in April . They had choked. The following month, Arteta told Spanish newspaper Marca : ‚ÄòTo this day, it still hurts me deeply not having won the Premier League after spending 10 months fighting City. ‚ÄòThere were three or four injuries to important players and from there, everything got complicated. Mikel Arteta knows Arsenal must make another title tilt after receiving financial backing Stan Kroenke expects results after investing. His Denver Nuggets won the NBA Finals in June Arsenal won 5-0 against the MLS All-Stars team thanks to a strong first-team performance ‚ÄòWhen we had the full team, we were consistent. As soon as problems came, we couldn‚Äôt be consistent.‚Äô The message was clear: a Premier League title can only be won with a bigger, stronger squad. That warning has been more than heeded by owner Stan Kroenke , who has since splurged over ¬£200million in the past month. The signings of Kai Havertz , Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice were decisively made at the start of the window, allowing the players time to bed into the manager‚Äôs demands and plot how they can wrestle back the league this time around. It has translated into a sheer sense of optimism surrounding this club. During training near Washington DC, smiles and team bonding were commonplace. Rice, for instance, has shown signs of leadership both on and off the pitch on this US tour, and is already clearly respected among this group. Following the 5-0 thrashing of the MLS All-Stars in Washington, D.C., Arteta was beaming as he said: ‚ÄòThe idea is to be more unpredictable every year and more difficult for the opponents to stop us. We have, especially in the back and midfield, many more options than we had last season.‚Äô Though beneath the sheen of optimism, the amount of pressure, which was already heightened, is now further ramped up. When Kroenke invests heavily, he expects results. He also has had the recent taste of winning big in many sports, bar football. You only have to look at the trajectory of the other teams he owns in various league across the US. In the past 17 months, three of his clubs have won major championships. The Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Rams and Colorado Avalanche have won an NBA Championship , the Super Bowl, and the Stanley Cup respectively. Arteta knows he must go one step further this season, especially after being handed the tools he requested. Though it is a challenge he will relish, and one which so far does not appear unfathomable. Declan Rice is the marquee signing of the summer and is already a leader in the Arsenal squad Jurrien Timber signed a five-year deal in his ¬£40.5million move from Dutch giants Ajax New man Kai Havertz was on the scoresheet against the MLS All-Stars and adds forward depth There is a sheen of optimism at Arsenal but this season they must deliver after huge spending The All-Stars match saw the manager give 21 players a chance across the 90 minutes. The performance levels did not dip, and nor was there a feeling of multiple second-string players coming on to fill the gaps. There really is a strength in depth to this squad that has not been there in recent years, and which will be noticed by their league rivals ‚Äî including Pep Guardiola‚Äôs City. The new signings also showed in glimpses why they were so sought after by the Gunners. Timber utilised unorthodox positions across the backline, Rice marshalled his team-mates into the correct positions, and Havertz put his volley challenge nightmare from the day before behind him to put in a composed display . The signs look bright indeed, but the required goal is unquestionable. Share or comment on this article: Arsenal's ¬£200m spending spree this summer means Mikel Arteta MUST now deliver...

The Man United boss ticked off another box bringing Andre Onana into his squad following David de Gea's departure. He also stripped Harry Maguire of the captains arm band and gave the leadership duties to Bruno Fernandes. But the Dutch manager is still hoping to make a few more signings before the end of the transfer window with United hoping to bring in a new striker following the departure of Wout Weghorst last season. Weghorst failed to score goals up top and the Red Devils are eyeing up Rasmus Hojlund as a replacement. In fact, the Dutch manager yesterday vowed that he would be signing a striker this summer despite the club being frustrated by Atalanta's ¬£86million price tag. ‚ÄòWe will do everything that's in our power to get the right man in,‚Äô said Ten Hag. ‚ÄòYou never know in the transfer market, but we know our targets and we‚Äôll do everything we can. We put every effort in to get this done because it's an area where we need improvement. ‚ÄòWe proved also last season we can be very successful even though we didn't have too many strikers. I expect more from the front players, a high level. They have to raise the bar and we expect more goals.‚Äô Erik ten Hag vows Man United 'will do everything' to sign a striker CHRIS WHEELER: United have acquired midfielder Mason Mount and goalkeeper Andre Onana in this transfer window, but Ten Hag has made signing a new centre-forward a priority.

The shot-stopper jetted into New Jersey on Friday after completing his ¬£47million move from Inter Milan. Interestingly, the Serie A outfit are currently interested in signing David de Gea, who made way for the Cameroonian following what was an unceremonious departure from Old Trafford earlier this summer.

It will be interesting tonight to how he combines with Martin Odegaard and Jorginho in the midfield tonight. It is a strong midfield trio from Arteta, but he‚Äôs also named Jurrien Timber at right-back, following his impressive game against the MLS All Stars. One of his greatest attributes is his passing ability and it could be a sign to come from Mikel Arteta, with Timber‚Äôs versatility giving him another option in defence alongside William Sailba, Gabriel and Takehiro Tomiyasu.

An eighth-minute goal from Yira Sor and a late hit from Tolu Arokodare saw the Belgians over the line on a frustrating evening for Vincent Kompany . James Trafford made his debut between the sticks for the Lancashire outfit after signing for ¬£19m from Manchester City but could not carry his clean sheets record from the U21s Euros into this game. Striker Zeki Amdouni, who recently signed from Basel after 22 goals there last season , came on as a substitute, while Andros Townsend featured as a trialist. It was a nightmare start for the Clarets when Sor converted just eight minutes after kick-off, following up after Angelo Preciado's effort was blocked. James Trafford, pictured after winning the U21s Euros with England, debuted as Burnley lost Vincent Kompany's side are preparing for their first season back in the Premier League after winning the Championship Josh Brownhill looked to get his side back in it around 16 minutes in but saw his attempted denied by a defender's legs. Scott Twine was a lively presence for Burnley and could have scored in either half. He rapped a half-volley wide of the mark early into the second half. The hosts almost added a second when new signing Christopher Bonsu Baah smacked a long-range attempt, but it went wide. But Genk got their reward for persistence in the closing minutes as Arokodare found the net for the home side in their last pre-season friendly.

Tottenham striker's wife, Kate, has been 'looking at properties in Munich' as Bayern edge closer to signing England star Harry Kane's wife, Kate, has reportedly been looking at properties in Munich It comes as the Tottenham star is edging closer to an exit from the London club Bayern Munich are leading the race and are set to table a third offer this week By Ed Carruthers For Mailonline Updated: 21:07 BST, 22 July 2023 e-mail 5 shares 13 View comments Harry Kane's wife, Kate, has sensationally been reported to be 'looking at properties in Munich' as the Tottenham star edges closer to a move to Bayern Munich. The German club are currently leading the race to sign him after Daniel Levy slapped a ¬£100million valuation on the England captain, deterring many other clubs including Manchester United off from signing him . But that valuation has not stopped the German champions from tabling bids for Kane, with Thomas Tuchel's side set to make their third offer for him this week , after having their previous bids of ¬£60m and an improved price of ¬£70m rejected . The striker, who turns 30 this week, travelled with Ange Postecoglou's side to Asia and could feature in Sunday's pre-season friendly against Leicester in Thailand. The Australian manager on Saturday admitted in a press conference that he expects the club's all-time top scorer to stay despite interest from Bayern and is planning for next season with Kane in his squad. Harry Kane (pictured) is edging closer to a move to Bayern Munich with the German champions set to make their third bid to sign him But a report from German outlet Bild has claimed that his wife, Kate (right), has been looking at properties in Munich Thomas Tuchel's (pictured) side have already offered ¬£70million to sign Kane but are set to improve that bid and submit a third offer this week But in a sensational report from Bild , Kane's wife has been reportedly 'looking at properties in Munich and the district of Grunwald in Bavaria.' The German news outlet are also claiming that other members of Kane's family have been in the German city 'in the past few days to look at international schools and properties'. Kane and his partner married in 2019 and are known childhood sweethearts. The pair have three children together and have recently announced that they are expecting a fourth . Questions have been mounting over whether the 29-year-old should move to Germany , with the Spurs striker still able to break Alan Shearer's record of being the Premier League's all-time leading goal scorer. Kane (pictured) travelled with Tottenham's pre-season training squad to Asia and could feature in tomorrow's friendly against Leicester But the German side seems to be Kane's preferred option after Mail Sport reported this week that he would not be keen on a move to Paris Saint Germain . In any event, while Spurs are hopeful he will stay, they are making contingency plans for life without the England captain. Levy is reportedly stepping up plans to bring in Fiorentina's Arthur Cabral , a robust forward who scored 19 goals in 64 appearances since moving to Italy in January 2022. Kane's contract will expire in 2024 with Tottenham having already tabled a very lucrative deal to try and keep him at the club.

The 27-year-old running back made two settlement offers of $800,000, then $1M to his accuser, Gracelyn Trimble - a former US Army sergeant - hoping that she would refrain from testifying against him, per a recent filing from the accuser's lawyer. Cook, who was released by the Vikings in the spring, also asked his former partner to deny the abuse accusation with a sworn affidavit and that she send league officials a letter clearing his name of any wrongdoing in exchange for the six-figure cash offer. Tremble alleges that Cook abused her, caused a brain injury, and held her hostage at his home in a suburb of Minneapolis in November 2020. She claims that she flew into Minnesota's capital to break up with the football player and to collect her belongings. Free agent running back Dalvin Cook is facing domestic violence claims from a 2020 lawsuit Gracelyn Trimble - Cook's ex - claims she was offered $800k than $1M to stay quiet by Cook Trimble also alleges that she was physically and mentally abused several times by the NFL star Instead, Cook 'grabbed her by her arm and slung her whole body over the couch, slamming her face into the coffee table and causing her lower forehead and the bridge of her nose to bust open,' according to legal papers recently filed in Dakota-County District Court, first obtained by The Minneapolis Star-Tribune . Details of the filing are sealed. DailyMail.com has contacted both parties' attorneys for immediate comment. Timber also alleges that Cook followed her upstairs when she went to clean off the blood, throwing her down and pinning her to the ground before punching and choking her. He then allegedly grabbed his rifle and yelled death threats while holding her at gunpoint, according to the filing. What's more is that Timber claims that Cook beat her with a broomstick, threw her against a wall and kicked her in the hips and ribs while she laid on the ground before she ran out of his home in search of help. He later got her back into the house and confiscated her phone, the filing reports. Police were not called to the scene, a the time of the incident. This photograph from Trimble's filing shows a cut to the back of her head she blames on Cook Trimble also included several online exchanges with Cook in a sealed filing made by her lawyer Trimble did not call police to report the incident at the time and is a former US Army sergeant Trimble, pictured in her Army uniform, and Cook broke up 'for good' in May of last year A private message sent by Cook on Instagram that was included in the filing reads: 'I know what I did can be rewind...if you wanna go to the police I'll respect that I'll take my punishment for what I did! Cook, who is seeking $10M as a free agent this offseason, countersued for fraud and defamation. A police report was only filed in May of last year after the pair broke up 'for good,' according to The New York Post . Cook was involved in all of the Vikings' 17 NFL games last season, rushing for 1,173 yards. His agent, Zac Hiller, flirted with the Jets in a recent podcast interview, saying the franchise has 'a great thing going' after trading for Aaron Rodgers. But, for Cook to join New York, he would have to decrease his salary demands. The Jets have Michael Carter and Breece Hall as their only two running backs for this upcoming season.

Young, who played alongside Sean Dyche when he began his career at Watford two decades ago, describe his decision to join Everton as a 'no-brainer' after being released by Aston Villa . And despite the cynics claiming the move only highlighted Everton's financial predicament, the former Manchester United , Inter Milan and England star enjoyed a fantastic debut yesterday as a winger, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win at Wigan. Tougher challenges like ahead for sure. Everton have been perilously close to relegation in each of the last two seasons and they need to survive on a relative shoestring for one more season in order to move into their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in August 2024 as a Premier League club. The club haven't paid a transfer fee for a permanent signing in the last two transfer windows and are in special measures having reported heavy financial losses over three years. Ashley Young joined Everton for free this summer after being released by Aston Villa The 38-year-old is adamant former team-mate Sean Dyche can help turn the Toffees' fortunes But Young is adamant having agreed his move to Merseyside that the Everton glass should remain half-full because of Dyche being at the helm. After all, he's a manager used to punching above his weight at Burnley and three of his squad at Turf Moore ‚Äì Dwight McNeil, James Tarkowski and Michael Keane ‚Äì are now at Goodison. 'When I played alongside Sean, I could tell he would go into management. He has that winning mentality, that spark when he walks into a dressing-room, you're aware of that presence,' he explains. 'Him and Everton is a good match and from what I've seen so far, all the players are willing to buy into it 'I knew he wanted me at Burnley before I went to Aston Villa so it was extra pull to join Everton besides the fans, players and size of the club. 'Obviously the last two seasons haven't gone as well as they should but he has the mentality to take the club higher up the table where they should be. 'The last couple of years wasn't going to put me off joining. When you put a challenge in front of me, I go full throttle. Monaco-based Farhad Moshiri (pictured) has been an absentee owner in recent years Dyche wanted watched the U21s team play on Saturday to see what he's got coming through 'They've not had a settled manager but what Sean gives, I'm feeling positive.' Certainly, Everton need some of that positivity from Young. They've become a selling club over recent times and Monaco-based Farhad Moshiri an absentee owner. He's had to take on loans to secure the building of the stadium which has impacted on the playing squad. Fans were so discontented, directors didn't go to Goodison for the second part of last season. They played well at Wigan on Saturday but it was significant assistant Ian Woan took charge because Dyche wanted to see the under-21s team play instead to see what he's got coming through. The absences of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Amadou Onana with injuries will also be concerning given the Premier League begins in three weeks. Demarai Gray has been given time off after playing for Jamaica in the Gold Cup and he may or may not return given there is interest from other clubs. Luckily for Everton, Young is Mr Versatility and having spent his latter years as a wing-back, he looked good as a left-sided attacker, even breaking into the box to hit the winner after 63 minutes before gaining a standing ovation from hundreds of Evertonians when he was substituted later on. 'It is fluid where I'll be used. As a player you have to be ready to play in different positions,' said Young. Young (centre) insists he can't wait to play in front of the Goodison crowd next season 'I am one of those players who gives 100 per cent whatever position the manager wants. I can't wait to get to Goodison and play for the badge. I know the home fans are loud and noisy and will give everything back to you. When you get a chance to play for a big club like Everton it was a no-brainer.' One of Young's happiest Goodison memories was scoring the winner for Villa which prompted Martin O'Neill to label him a 'genius'. Everton will need a few of those this season though fans should also remember the third line of their club song which begins 'And If you know your history' The last time things looked this bleak, in 2004 when they finished 17th and then sold Wayne Rooney, David Moyes battened down the hatches the following season and Everton surprised everyone to finish in the top four!

The party line from those within the club highlighted how much of an achievement it was for Arsenal to push Manchester City right to the wire. Besides, the north London club had finished fifth the season before ‚Äì they had last finished runners-up in 2015-16 under Arsene Wenger. This was a stark improvement. But, in reality, Arteta and Co knew they had scuppered a golden chance. It was in their hands ‚Äî until they secured three consecutive draws and a humiliation to City in April . They had choked. The following month, Arteta told Spanish newspaper Marca : ‚ÄòTo this day, it still hurts me deeply not having won the Premier League after spending 10 months fighting City. ‚ÄòThere were three or four injuries to important players and from there, everything got complicated. Mikel Arteta knows Arsenal must make another title tilt after receiving financial backing Stan Kroenke expects results after investing. His Denver Nuggets won the NBA Finals in June Arsenal won 5-0 against the MLS All-Stars team thanks to a strong first-team performance ‚ÄòWhen we had the full team, we were consistent. As soon as problems came, we couldn‚Äôt be consistent.‚Äô The message was clear: a Premier League title can only be won with a bigger, stronger squad. That warning has been more than heeded by owner Stan Kroenke , who has since splurged over ¬£200million in the past month. The signings of Kai Havertz , Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice were decisively made at the start of the window, allowing the players time to bed into the manager‚Äôs demands and plot how they can wrestle back the league this time around. It has translated into a sheer sense of optimism surrounding this club. During training near Washington DC, smiles and team bonding were commonplace. Rice, for instance, has shown signs of leadership both on and off the pitch on this US tour, and is already clearly respected among this group. Following the 5-0 thrashing of the MLS All-Stars in Washington, D.C., Arteta was beaming as he said: ‚ÄòThe idea is to be more unpredictable every year and more difficult for the opponents to stop us. We have, especially in the back and midfield, many more options than we had last season.‚Äô Though beneath the sheen of optimism, the amount of pressure, which was already heightened, is now further ramped up. When Kroenke invests heavily, he expects results. He also has had the recent taste of winning big in many sports, bar football. You only have to look at the trajectory of the other teams he owns in various league across the US. In the past 17 months, three of his clubs have won major championships. The Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Rams and Colorado Avalanche have won an NBA Championship , the Super Bowl, and the Stanley Cup respectively. Arteta knows he must go one step further this season, especially after being handed the tools he requested. Though it is a challenge he will relish, and one which so far does not appear unfathomable. Declan Rice is the marquee signing of the summer and is already a leader in the Arsenal squad Jurrien Timber signed a five-year deal in his ¬£40.5million move from Dutch giants Ajax New man Kai Havertz was on the scoresheet against the MLS All-Stars and adds forward depth There is a sheen of optimism at Arsenal but this season they must deliver after huge spending The All-Stars match saw the manager give 21 players a chance across the 90 minutes. The performance levels did not dip, and nor was there a feeling of multiple second-string players coming on to fill the gaps. There really is a strength in depth to this squad that has not been there in recent years, and which will be noticed by their league rivals ‚Äî including Pep Guardiola‚Äôs City. The new signings also showed in glimpses why they were so sought after by the Gunners. Timber utilised unorthodox positions across the backline, Rice marshalled his team-mates into the correct positions, and Havertz put his volley challenge nightmare from the day before behind him to put in a composed display . The signs look bright indeed, but the required goal is unquestionable. Share or comment on this article: Arsenal's ¬£200m spending spree this summer means Mikel Arteta MUST now deliver...

It is a strong midfield trio from Arteta, but he‚Äôs also named Jurrien Timber at right-back, following his impressive game against the MLS All Stars.

An eighth-minute goal from Yira Sor and a late hit from Tolu Arokodare saw the Belgians over the line on a frustrating evening for Vincent Kompany . James Trafford made his debut between the sticks for the Lancashire outfit after signing for ¬£19m from Manchester City but could not carry his clean sheets record from the U21s Euros into this game. Striker Zeki Amdouni, who recently signed from Basel after 22 goals there last season , came on as a substitute, while Andros Townsend featured as a trialist. It was a nightmare start for the Clarets when Sor converted just eight minutes after kick-off, following up after Angelo Preciado's effort was blocked. James Trafford, pictured after winning the U21s Euros with England, debuted as Burnley lost Vincent Kompany's side are preparing for their first season back in the Premier League after winning the Championship Josh Brownhill looked to get his side back in it around 16 minutes in but saw his attempted denied by a defender's legs. Scott Twine was a lively presence for Burnley and could have scored in either half. He rapped a half-volley wide of the mark early into the second half. The hosts almost added a second when new signing Christopher Bonsu Baah smacked a long-range attempt, but it went wide. But Genk got their reward for persistence in the closing minutes as Arokodare found the net for the home side in their last pre-season friendly.

Tottenham striker's wife, Kate, has been 'looking at properties in Munich' as Bayern edge closer to signing England star Harry Kane's wife, Kate, has reportedly been looking at properties in Munich It comes as the Tottenham star is edging closer to an exit from the London club Bayern Munich are leading the race and are set to table a third offer this week By Ed Carruthers For Mailonline Updated: 21:07 BST, 22 July 2023 e-mail 5 shares 13 View comments Harry Kane's wife, Kate, has sensationally been reported to be 'looking at properties in Munich' as the Tottenham star edges closer to a move to Bayern Munich. The German club are currently leading the race to sign him after Daniel Levy slapped a ¬£100million valuation on the England captain, deterring many other clubs including Manchester United off from signing him . But that valuation has not stopped the German champions from tabling bids for Kane, with Thomas Tuchel's side set to make their third offer for him this week , after having their previous bids of ¬£60m and an improved price of ¬£70m rejected . The striker, who turns 30 this week, travelled with Ange Postecoglou's side to Asia and could feature in Sunday's pre-season friendly against Leicester in Thailand. The Australian manager on Saturday admitted in a press conference that he expects the club's all-time top scorer to stay despite interest from Bayern and is planning for next season with Kane in his squad. Harry Kane (pictured) is edging closer to a move to Bayern Munich with the German champions set to make their third bid to sign him But a report from German outlet Bild has claimed that his wife, Kate (right), has been looking at properties in Munich Thomas Tuchel's (pictured) side have already offered ¬£70million to sign Kane but are set to improve that bid and submit a third offer this week But in a sensational report from Bild , Kane's wife has been reportedly 'looking at properties in Munich and the district of Grunwald in Bavaria.' The German news outlet are also claiming that other members of Kane's family have been in the German city 'in the past few days to look at international schools and properties'. Kane and his partner married in 2019 and are known childhood sweethearts. The pair have three children together and have recently announced that they are expecting a fourth . Questions have been mounting over whether the 29-year-old should move to Germany , with the Spurs striker still able to break Alan Shearer's record of being the Premier League's all-time leading goal scorer. Kane (pictured) travelled with Tottenham's pre-season training squad to Asia and could feature in tomorrow's friendly against Leicester But the German side seems to be Kane's preferred option after Mail Sport reported this week that he would not be keen on a move to Paris Saint Germain . In any event, while Spurs are hopeful he will stay, they are making contingency plans for life without the England captain. Levy is reportedly stepping up plans to bring in Fiorentina's Arthur Cabral , a robust forward who scored 19 goals in 64 appearances since moving to Italy in January 2022. Kane's contract will expire in 2024 with Tottenham having already tabled a very lucrative deal to try and keep him at the club.

The 27-year-old running back made two settlement offers of $800,000, then $1M to his accuser, Gracelyn Trimble - a former US Army sergeant - hoping that she would refrain from testifying against him, per a recent filing from the accuser's lawyer. Cook, who was released by the Vikings in the spring, also asked his former partner to deny the abuse accusation with a sworn affidavit and that she send league officials a letter clearing his name of any wrongdoing in exchange for the six-figure cash offer. Tremble alleges that Cook abused her, caused a brain injury, and held her hostage at his home in a suburb of Minneapolis in November 2020. She claims that she flew into Minnesota's capital to break up with the football player and to collect her belongings. Free agent running back Dalvin Cook is facing domestic violence claims from a 2020 lawsuit Gracelyn Trimble - Cook's ex - claims she was offered $800k than $1M to stay quiet by Cook Trimble also alleges that she was physically and mentally abused several times by the NFL star Instead, Cook 'grabbed her by her arm and slung her whole body over the couch, slamming her face into the coffee table and causing her lower forehead and the bridge of her nose to bust open,' according to legal papers recently filed in Dakota-County District Court, first obtained by The Minneapolis Star-Tribune . Details of the filing are sealed. DailyMail.com has contacted both parties' attorneys for immediate comment. Timber also alleges that Cook followed her upstairs when she went to clean off the blood, throwing her down and pinning her to the ground before punching and choking her. He then allegedly grabbed his rifle and yelled death threats while holding her at gunpoint, according to the filing. What's more is that Timber claims that Cook beat her with a broomstick, threw her against a wall and kicked her in the hips and ribs while she laid on the ground before she ran out of his home in search of help. He later got her back into the house and confiscated her phone, the filing reports. Police were not called to the scene, a the time of the incident. This photograph from Trimble's filing shows a cut to the back of her head she blames on Cook Trimble also included several online exchanges with Cook in a sealed filing made by her lawyer Trimble did not call police to report the incident at the time and is a former US Army sergeant Trimble, pictured in her Army uniform, and Cook broke up 'for good' in May of last year A private message sent by Cook on Instagram that was included in the filing reads: 'I know what I did can be rewind...if you wanna go to the police I'll respect that I'll take my punishment for what I did! Cook, who is seeking $10M as a free agent this offseason, countersued for fraud and defamation. A police report was only filed in May of last year after the pair broke up 'for good,' according to The New York Post . Cook was involved in all of the Vikings' 17 NFL games last season, rushing for 1,173 yards. His agent, Zac Hiller, flirted with the Jets in a recent podcast interview, saying the franchise has 'a great thing going' after trading for Aaron Rodgers. But, for Cook to join New York, he would have to decrease his salary demands. The Jets have Michael Carter and Breece Hall as their only two running backs for this upcoming season.

Young, who played alongside Sean Dyche when he began his career at Watford two decades ago, describe his decision to join Everton as a 'no-brainer' after being released by Aston Villa . And despite the cynics claiming the move only highlighted Everton's financial predicament, the former Manchester United , Inter Milan and England star enjoyed a fantastic debut yesterday as a winger, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win at Wigan. Tougher challenges like ahead for sure. Everton have been perilously close to relegation in each of the last two seasons and they need to survive on a relative shoestring for one more season in order to move into their new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in August 2024 as a Premier League club. The club haven't paid a transfer fee for a permanent signing in the last two transfer windows and are in special measures having reported heavy financial losses over three years. Ashley Young joined Everton for free this summer after being released by Aston Villa The 38-year-old is adamant former team-mate Sean Dyche can help turn the Toffees' fortunes But Young is adamant having agreed his move to Merseyside that the Everton glass should remain half-full because of Dyche being at the helm. After all, he's a manager used to punching above his weight at Burnley and three of his squad at Turf Moore ‚Äì Dwight McNeil, James Tarkowski and Michael Keane ‚Äì are now at Goodison. 'When I played alongside Sean, I could tell he would go into management. He has that winning mentality, that spark when he walks into a dressing-room, you're aware of that presence,' he explains. 'Him and Everton is a good match and from what I've seen so far, all the players are willing to buy into it 'I knew he wanted me at Burnley before I went to Aston Villa so it was extra pull to join Everton besides the fans, players and size of the club. 'Obviously the last two seasons haven't gone as well as they should but he has the mentality to take the club higher up the table where they should be. 'The last couple of years wasn't going to put me off joining. When you put a challenge in front of me, I go full throttle. Monaco-based Farhad Moshiri (pictured) has been an absentee owner in recent years Dyche wanted watched the U21s team play on Saturday to see what he's got coming through 'They've not had a settled manager but what Sean gives, I'm feeling positive.' Certainly, Everton need some of that positivity from Young. They've become a selling club over recent times and Monaco-based Farhad Moshiri an absentee owner. He's had to take on loans to secure the building of the stadium which has impacted on the playing squad. Fans were so discontented, directors didn't go to Goodison for the second part of last season. They played well at Wigan on Saturday but it was significant assistant Ian Woan took charge because Dyche wanted to see the under-21s team play instead to see what he's got coming through. The absences of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Amadou Onana with injuries will also be concerning given the Premier League begins in three weeks. Demarai Gray has been given time off after playing for Jamaica in the Gold Cup and he may or may not return given there is interest from other clubs. Luckily for Everton, Young is Mr Versatility and having spent his latter years as a wing-back, he looked good as a left-sided attacker, even breaking into the box to hit the winner after 63 minutes before gaining a standing ovation from hundreds of Evertonians when he was substituted later on. 'It is fluid where I'll be used. As a player you have to be ready to play in different positions,' said Young. Young (centre) insists he can't wait to play in front of the Goodison crowd next season 'I am one of those players who gives 100 per cent whatever position the manager wants. I can't wait to get to Goodison and play for the badge. I know the home fans are loud and noisy and will give everything back to you. When you get a chance to play for a big club like Everton it was a no-brainer.' One of Young's happiest Goodison memories was scoring the winner for Villa which prompted Martin O'Neill to label him a 'genius'. Everton will need a few of those this season though fans should also remember the third line of their club song which begins 'And If you know your history' The last time things looked this bleak, in 2004 when they finished 17th and then sold Wayne Rooney, David Moyes battened down the hatches the following season and Everton surprised everyone to finish in the top four!

Man City and other rivals will take notice but new signings mean the future looks bright Mikel Arteta knows he must deliver this year after a ¬£200million summer splurge The signings of Rice, Timber, and Havertz mean they have a new-found depth Stan Kroenke's American sports teams have thrived after investment recently By Isaan Khan For Mailonline Updated: 19:59 BST, 22 July 2023 e-mail 20 shares 10 View comments It was a couple of words in the lengthy dissections over what went wrong that gave away what was on the mind of Mikel Arteta in May. The party line from those within the club highlighted how much of an achievement it was for Arsenal to push Manchester City right to the wire. Besides, the north London club had finished fifth the season before ‚Äì they had last finished runners-up in 2015-16 under Arsene Wenger. This was a stark improvement. But, in reality, Arteta and Co knew they had scuppered a golden chance. It was in their hands ‚Äî until they secured three consecutive draws and a humiliation to City in April . They had choked. The following month, Arteta told Spanish newspaper Marca : ‚ÄòTo this day, it still hurts me deeply not having won the Premier League after spending 10 months fighting City. ‚ÄòThere were three or four injuries to important players and from there, everything got complicated. Mikel Arteta knows Arsenal must make another title tilt after receiving financial backing Stan Kroenke expects results after investing. His Denver Nuggets won the NBA Finals in June Arsenal won 5-0 against the MLS All-Stars team thanks to a strong first-team performance ‚ÄòWhen we had the full team, we were consistent. As soon as problems came, we couldn‚Äôt be consistent.‚Äô The message was clear: a Premier League title can only be won with a bigger, stronger squad. That warning has been more than heeded by owner Stan Kroenke , who has since splurged over ¬£200million in the past month. The signings of Kai Havertz , Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice were decisively made at the start of the window, allowing the players time to bed into the manager‚Äôs demands and plot how they can wrestle back the league this time around. It has translated into a sheer sense of optimism surrounding this club. During training near Washington DC, smiles and team bonding were commonplace. Rice, for instance, has shown signs of leadership both on and off the pitch on this US tour, and is already clearly respected among this group. Following the 5-0 thrashing of the MLS All-Stars in Washington, D.C., Arteta was beaming as he said: ‚ÄòThe idea is to be more unpredictable every year and more difficult for the opponents to stop us. We have, especially in the back and midfield, many more options than we had last season.‚Äô Though beneath the sheen of optimism, the amount of pressure, which was already heightened, is now further ramped up. When Kroenke invests heavily, he expects results. He also has had the recent taste of winning big in many sports, bar football. You only have to look at the trajectory of the other teams he owns in various league across the US. In the past 17 months, three of his clubs have won major championships. The Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Rams and Colorado Avalanche have won an NBA Championship , the Super Bowl, and the Stanley Cup respectively. Arteta knows he must go one step further this season, especially after being handed the tools he requested. Though it is a challenge he will relish, and one which so far does not appear unfathomable. Declan Rice is the marquee signing of the summer and is already a leader in the Arsenal squad Jurrien Timber signed a five-year deal in his ¬£40.5million move from Dutch giants Ajax New man Kai Havertz was on the scoresheet against the MLS All-Stars and adds forward depth There is a sheen of optimism at Arsenal but this season they must deliver after huge spending The All-Stars match saw the manager give 21 players a chance across the 90 minutes. The performance levels did not dip, and nor was there a feeling of multiple second-string players coming on to fill the gaps. There really is a strength in depth to this squad that has not been there in recent years, and which will be noticed by their league rivals ‚Äî including Pep Guardiola‚Äôs City. The new signings also showed in glimpses why they were so sought after by the Gunners. Timber utilised unorthodox positions across the backline, Rice marshalled his team-mates into the correct positions, and Havertz put his volley challenge nightmare from the day before behind him to put in a composed display . The signs look bright indeed, but the required goal is unquestionable. Share or comment on this article: Arsenal's ¬£200m spending spree this summer means Mikel Arteta MUST now deliver...
