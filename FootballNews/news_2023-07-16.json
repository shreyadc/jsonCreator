Following weeks of speculation, the former West Ham captain's move to the Emirates was finally confirmed on Saturday, with the £105m fee eclipsing the £100m Man City paid for Jack Grealish to make Rice the most expensive British footballer ever. After coming agonisingly close to a first Premier League title in nearly two decades last season, Mikel Arteta has been afforded a sizeable war chest to continue his side's progress in 2023-24. Along with the capture Rice, Arsenal have also signed Kai Havertz from Chelsea for £65m and Jurrien Timber from Ajax for £40m, with further additions expected before the end of the transfer window. Building a squad with a focus on youth was a hallmark of Wenger's 22-year stint at the Gunners, and he hailed the arrival of Rice at the club as a continuation of that philosophy. Arsene Wenger hailed Arsenal's club-record £105m signing of Declan Rice from West Ham The legendary Gunners boss called the move a 'good investment' and tipped the squad to win the Premier League 'I think it is a good investment,' Wenger told Eurosport . 'Overall, personally I think they have made good buys as they are players who are now mature, 23,24, and still young so can stay together for a few years. 'They will be under more pressure after last year, but they have learned a lot and they can show they can deal with that pressure now.' The signings of Rice, Timber and Havertz already rank among the ten highest transfer fees paid in the club's history, with a further four players on the list having signed with the club in the five years since Wegner's departure in 2018. Reflecting on the funds available to him towards the end of his time in charge, the 73-year-old admitted that he was forced to develop his squad utilising a different approach. Arsenal's last Premier League win came nearly two decades ago with Wenger at the helm 'I had to cope with no money at all, so you have to find a different way. 'Arsenal is now in a good financial situation and bought what they think will win the championship.' Arsenal's last Premier League triumph came during Wenger's tenure at the club and the Frenchman backed his former side to finally reclaim the title next season. 'I believe we will win the championship, it is as simple as that.'

Lorient, who tried to sign attacking midfielder Adam in January, Lille and Club Brugge are all keen on signing the 19 year-old this summer. Scotland under-21 international Adam joined City from Celtic three years ago and is tipped for a bright future for club and country after impressing across Europe at youth level. However, with a congested pathway to first-team football at City Adam could move on in search of more opportunities. City’s youth team products have become an increasingly lucrative revenue stream for the club in more recent years. Man City midfielder Josh Adam is attracting interest from clubs in Belgium and France Last summer Gavin Bazunu, Aro Muric, Juan Larios, Romeo Lavia, Darko Gyabi and Sam Edozie all left City for a combined sum in excess of £50m. This week Southampton sealed the £15m signing of City midfield prospect Shea Charles, and goalkeeper James Trafford is set to join Burnley in a £19m deal after inspiring England’s under-21s to Euros glory. Pep Guardiola's side have also strengthened their side this summer, with Mateo Kovacic arriving from Chelsea for £25 million. They have lost Ilkay Gundogan to Barcelona on a free transfer, though, and doubts remain over Riyad Mahrez's future amid links with Saudi Arabia. City's title defence will get underway in just under a month's time, when they face club legend Vincent Kompany's Burnley side in August 11.

The 25-year-old was joined by teammate Tyrell Malacia in his brand new £700,000 Rolls-Royce for a 20-minute private shopping trip, for which the shutters remained down. Rashford, who wore a green tracksuit with white trainers, was also seen signing autographs for fans. One young supporter was even wearing a number 10 Man United shirt with the England striker's name on the back, and received a signature from his hero. It came after United's international players were pictured back in training for the first time, as they gear up for a pre-season tour of America. Marcus Rashford parked on double yellow lines in Cheshire on Saturday as he visited a jewellers He was joined by Man United teammate Tyrell Malacia in his £700,000 Rolls-Royce The 25-year-old striker signed an autograph for a young fan donning a Man United shirt The likes of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Rashford were all pictured heading into Carrington on Saturday, and the squad seemed in a buoyant mood as they began to dust off the cobwebs ahead of next season. Those who did not take part in the post-season internationals have been back in training for over a week now, with their first game held last week as they beat Leeds 2-0 in Norway in their opening game of the summer. Non-internationals such as Mason Mount , Raphael Varane and Tom Heaton played in the game which saw youngsters Noam Emeran and Joe Hugill net in the second half to give Erik ten Hag's side the win. They will continue their campaign against Lyon on Wednesday before heading to the United States for games against Arsenal, Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Rashford's last football came just over a month ago, when he played half an hour in England's 4-0 win over Malta and just under an hour of the 7-0 victory over North Macedonia, scoring on the stroke of half time. The England forward was seen smiling jubilantly on his return to training with fellow Red Devils attacker Anthony Elanga, who will be hoping to kick on next season and earn more first team opportunities. Rashford enjoyed the best goal soring season of his career in 2022-23, bagging 30 across all competitions as United came third in the league and one the League Cup. It came after Rashford returned to Carrington on Saturday as Manchester United geared up for the new season The striker painted a happy figure as he linked back up with the United squad Rashford was a key player for Erik ten Hag's side last season, scoring 30 goals as they won the League Cup and came third in the league He excelled on the left wing, but Erik ten Hag's failure to bring in a new striker could force him back into the middle again next season. The Red Devils were keen on Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund but have been stunned by his £68 million price tag , while fellow targets Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen would have been even more expensive. If he does want to keen Rashford on the left, Ten Hag's only obvious option through the middle is the injury-prone Anthony Martial, although he did experiment with Jadon Sancho as a false nine in a recent friendly. United will still be hoping to find a new striker before their first Premier League game of the season against Wolves n August 14.

Onana is set to sign a five-year contract after receiving assurances from Ten Hag that the deal was on track to being completed. It is believed a deal close to €50million (£43m), which includes around £5m in add-ons, is set to be agreed. The Dutch boss had always prioritised the signing of a new number one at Old Trafford this summer and the confirmation that David de Gea has left the club ensures that for the first time in 12 years, United will be lining up with a new first-choice goalkeeper next month. Erik ten Hag handed goalkeeper dilemma as Man Utd warned club \"cannot wait forever\" Harry Kane's Man Utd preference, secret transfer meeting and PSG hijack attempt Onana has already explained the specifics of his style of play that will benefit United, which will allow United to play with a higher back-line and to dominate more territory, while their possession should also increase as the Cameroonian is comfortable with playing out from the back. Sport Witness have cited reports in the Italian press from Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport claiming that Onana was given reassurances from Ten Hag that a deal was on track with the two clubs continuing to negotiate the finer details to clinch the move. It adds that the former Ajax star is planning to travel to Manchester on Sunday or Monday to undergo medical tests and seal the move. That would allow him to fly out with United on their pre-season tour, which starts next week. Ten Hag and Onana worked together for five years at Ajax ( Image: ISABELLA BONOTTO/AFP via Getty Images) Have Your Say! Will Onana prove to be a transformative signing for Man Utd ? Tell us what you think here. Negotiations had dragged on with the two clubs thought to be moderate valuations apart in the move, with both now set to cede some ground in order to process the deal. Inter are equally keen to complete the deal promptly to allow them to invest in other targets. Ten Hag has driven United’s transfer pursuit of Onana, over that of Porto shot-stopper Diogo Costa or David Raya of Brentford. He is aware of his strengths and weaknesses but is convinced the Inter goalkeeper is his man at Old Trafford. United completing the signing of Onana will allow them to move onto other targets, most notably Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund. It will also speed up the expected departure of Dean Henderson, who Nottingham Forest want to sign on a permanent deal with a possible fee of £30million.","pubDate":"2023-07-16 12:10:16","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30478442.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1496988068.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Tiger in town for Open as Christensen qualifies in Woods’ absence","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23658671.new-tiger-town-open-christensen-qualifies-woods-absence/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Christensen was the only amateur to make it through final qualifying across four venues.","content":"Tiger Christensen came through final qualifying at West Lancashire Golf Club in Crosby, near Liverpool, earlier this month to book his major debut.

To me he’s the greatest of all time,” said the Arizona University student “I think it’s really special what he’s done for the game, changed the entire game and made it more popular, and his achievements are just unbelievable. “It’s something you could look up to.” Referring to how he got his name he added: “It’s not only named after Tiger Woods – my dad has a very good friend who’s a retired boxer and his ring name was Tiger so it’s 50/50.” “For me it’s never been (a burden) because it’s just my birth name. I’m glad to be called Tiger. “I understand everything I’m ever going to do they are going to compare me to him straightaway but at the end of the day it’s a different time, I don’t have any connection to him. It’s just a name.” “I played a lot of football when I was younger and I always wanted to be a football pro until I was about 10 and then I started playing US kids tournaments and that is when I transitioned to wanting to become a golf professional,” added the Hamburg-born golfer, whose world ranking is above 3,700. Christensen was the only amateur to make it through final qualifying across four venues, only three days after almost securing a place via the European Amateur Championship in Estonia. A month earlier the teenager made his DP World Tour debut with an appearance in the Porsche European Open held in the city of his birth, although rounds of 80 and 79 saw him miss the cut by some distance on 13 over. “I cope with pressure pretty good, although at the DP World Tour event there was a new pressure I hadn’t had in playing with spectators,” he said of his imminent Open appearance. “Usually in amateur events only the final couple of groups, if you are playing well, get spectators but I think the DP World Tour event really helped me going into the Open.

L’adversaire du jour a pu commenter son nouveau style de jeu imposé par le coach espagnol. Après la rencontre, Frédéric Bompard, anciennement adjoint à l’OM et aujourd’hui coach à Nîmes s’est entretenu avec La Provence pour parler de la mise en place de Marcelino. « Le jeu est différent de celui de la saison dernière. L'an dernier, ça pressait très haut. Même s'ils sont quand même allés nous chercher, ils sont venus nous presser. Certains joueurs ont encore ce genre d'automatismes », a d’abord commenté l’entraîneur de l’équipe de National. « Il y a peut-être un peu moins de jeu vers l'avant, beaucoup plus de jeu entre les lignes. On est plus dans le “tiki taka“ que ça ne l'était la saison dernière. Avec Tudor, c'était beaucoup plus du jeu vers l'avant à la récupération, du football direct. C'est ce qui change un peu. Après, ça reste qu'un match, il va falloir attendre encore un peu », a-t-il reconnu pour le quotidien régional. Frédéric Bompard a ensuite été interrogé sur le système utilisé par Marcelino. « Ce n’est n'est pas le même. L'année dernière, ça jouait à trois, là c'est à quatre. Hier, ils ont joué en 4-2-3-1, ils ont changé les joueurs à la mi-temps, comme nous d'ailleurs. Ce ne sera pas du tout le même OM que celui de la saison dernière, ça c'est sûr.

Kane “has clearly signalled in all conversations that his decision (to join Bayern this summer) has been taken and if he sticks to that, then we’ll get him because Tottenham will have to give way”, Hoeness said. It has been reported that Bayern has agreed on personal terms with Kane, but an initial 70-million-euro ($76-million) bid was rejected by Spurs who are said to be demanding at least 100 million euros to part with their talismanic striker who has been included in the London club’s squad for their pre-season Asia-Pacific tour. The German champion is said to be intent on securing the signing of England’s record scorer, whose contract with Spurs runs out in 2024. Kane’s camp is believed to have approved the move, but Bayern needs an agreement on a transfer fee with Tottenham to seal the transfer. Hoeness said Kane “wants to play in an international competition and Tottenham are not qualified next season” for Europe “unlike our club”. The striker “now has the chance to come play for one of the best clubs in Europe”, added Hoeness, a member of a Bayern committee overseeing this summer’s recruitment alongside Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Jan-Christian Dreesen and coach Thomas Tuchel. Hoeness admitted that negotiating with Spurs president Daniel Levy was not easy. Levy, he said, is “intelligent and we first have to get him to a stage where he will figure out an amount” for the transfer. “He is trying to buy time, he is a seasoned professional, I appreciate him a lot.

Following weeks of speculation, the former West Ham captain's move to the Emirates was finally confirmed on Saturday, with the £105m fee eclipsing the £100m Man City paid for Jack Grealish to make Rice the most expensive British footballer ever. After coming agonisingly close to a first Premier League title in nearly two decades last season, Mikel Arteta has been afforded a sizeable war chest to continue his side's progress in 2023-24. Along with the capture Rice, Arsenal have also signed Kai Havertz from Chelsea for £65m and Jurrien Timber from Ajax for £40m, with further additions expected before the end of the transfer window. Building a squad with a focus on youth was a hallmark of Wenger's 22-year stint at the Gunners, and he hailed the arrival of Rice at the club as a continuation of that philosophy. Arsene Wenger hailed Arsenal's club-record £105m signing of Declan Rice from West Ham The legendary Gunners boss called the move a 'good investment' and tipped the squad to win the Premier League 'I think it is a good investment,' Wenger told Eurosport . 'Overall, personally I think they have made good buys as they are players who are now mature, 23,24, and still young so can stay together for a few years. 'They will be under more pressure after last year, but they have learned a lot and they can show they can deal with that pressure now.' The signings of Rice, Timber and Havertz already rank among the ten highest transfer fees paid in the club's history, with a further four players on the list having signed with the club in the five years since Wegner's departure in 2018. Reflecting on the funds available to him towards the end of his time in charge, the 73-year-old admitted that he was forced to develop his squad utilising a different approach. Arsenal's last Premier League win came nearly two decades ago with Wenger at the helm 'I had to cope with no money at all, so you have to find a different way. 'Arsenal is now in a good financial situation and bought what they think will win the championship.' Arsenal's last Premier League triumph came during Wenger's tenure at the club and the Frenchman backed his former side to finally reclaim the title next season. 'I believe we will win the championship, it is as simple as that.'

Lorient, who tried to sign attacking midfielder Adam in January, Lille and Club Brugge are all keen on signing the 19 year-old this summer. Scotland under-21 international Adam joined City from Celtic three years ago and is tipped for a bright future for club and country after impressing across Europe at youth level. However, with a congested pathway to first-team football at City Adam could move on in search of more opportunities. City’s youth team products have become an increasingly lucrative revenue stream for the club in more recent years. Man City midfielder Josh Adam is attracting interest from clubs in Belgium and France Last summer Gavin Bazunu, Aro Muric, Juan Larios, Romeo Lavia, Darko Gyabi and Sam Edozie all left City for a combined sum in excess of £50m. This week Southampton sealed the £15m signing of City midfield prospect Shea Charles, and goalkeeper James Trafford is set to join Burnley in a £19m deal after inspiring England’s under-21s to Euros glory. Pep Guardiola's side have also strengthened their side this summer, with Mateo Kovacic arriving from Chelsea for £25 million. They have lost Ilkay Gundogan to Barcelona on a free transfer, though, and doubts remain over Riyad Mahrez's future amid links with Saudi Arabia. City's title defence will get underway in just under a month's time, when they face club legend Vincent Kompany's Burnley side in August 11.

The 25-year-old was joined by teammate Tyrell Malacia in his brand new £700,000 Rolls-Royce for a 20-minute private shopping trip, for which the shutters remained down. Rashford, who wore a green tracksuit with white trainers, was also seen signing autographs for fans. One young supporter was even wearing a number 10 Man United shirt with the England striker's name on the back, and received a signature from his hero. It came after United's international players were pictured back in training for the first time, as they gear up for a pre-season tour of America. Marcus Rashford parked on double yellow lines in Cheshire on Saturday as he visited a jewellers He was joined by Man United teammate Tyrell Malacia in his £700,000 Rolls-Royce The 25-year-old striker signed an autograph for a young fan donning a Man United shirt The likes of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Rashford were all pictured heading into Carrington on Saturday, and the squad seemed in a buoyant mood as they began to dust off the cobwebs ahead of next season. Those who did not take part in the post-season internationals have been back in training for over a week now, with their first game held last week as they beat Leeds 2-0 in Norway in their opening game of the summer. Non-internationals such as Mason Mount , Raphael Varane and Tom Heaton played in the game which saw youngsters Noam Emeran and Joe Hugill net in the second half to give Erik ten Hag's side the win. They will continue their campaign against Lyon on Wednesday before heading to the United States for games against Arsenal, Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Rashford's last football came just over a month ago, when he played half an hour in England's 4-0 win over Malta and just under an hour of the 7-0 victory over North Macedonia, scoring on the stroke of half time. The England forward was seen smiling jubilantly on his return to training with fellow Red Devils attacker Anthony Elanga, who will be hoping to kick on next season and earn more first team opportunities. Rashford enjoyed the best goal soring season of his career in 2022-23, bagging 30 across all competitions as United came third in the league and one the League Cup. It came after Rashford returned to Carrington on Saturday as Manchester United geared up for the new season The striker painted a happy figure as he linked back up with the United squad Rashford was a key player for Erik ten Hag's side last season, scoring 30 goals as they won the League Cup and came third in the league He excelled on the left wing, but Erik ten Hag's failure to bring in a new striker could force him back into the middle again next season. The Red Devils were keen on Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund but have been stunned by his £68 million price tag , while fellow targets Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen would have been even more expensive. If he does want to keen Rashford on the left, Ten Hag's only obvious option through the middle is the injury-prone Anthony Martial, although he did experiment with Jadon Sancho as a false nine in a recent friendly. United will still be hoping to find a new striker before their first Premier League game of the season against Wolves n August 14.

On Saturday, Arsenal finally confirmed the signing of Declan Rice from West Ham for a new club record £105million fee. That followed c ompleting a deal for Ajax defender Jurrien Timber for £38.5 million, with Mikel Arteta's summer spending now beyond £200million. Manchester United are still pushing to sign Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana, and are also chasing Japanese stopper Zion Suzuki following the departure of David de Gea. Their search for a striker is proving tough however, with Atalanta's valuation of Rasmus Hojlund. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson is still weighing up his future amid a huge offer to join the Saudi Pro League, with Fabinho also on the brink of a move to the Middle East.

And the Blades are exploring the ex-England international’s availability as they look to strengthen their squad following their return to the Premier League. Boss Paul Heckingbottom is working to a tight budget and Shelvey would not break the bank. But he also has vast experience of the top flight and would undoubtedly strengthen the Brammall Lane squad.

Rice completed a £105million transfer to the Gunners on Saturday, bringing an end to a long-running saga. At one point in the summer, it looked as if Manchester City had pulled into pole position in the race to sign the England international. But Arsenal were able to fight off that interest from their Premier League title rivals and secure Mikel Arteta's top target.

Onana is set to sign a five-year contract after receiving assurances from Ten Hag that the deal was on track to being completed. It is believed a deal close to €50million (£43m), which includes around £5m in add-ons, is set to be agreed. The Dutch boss had always prioritised the signing of a new number one at Old Trafford this summer and the confirmation that David de Gea has left the club ensures that for the first time in 12 years, United will be lining up with a new first-choice goalkeeper next month. Erik ten Hag handed goalkeeper dilemma as Man Utd warned club \"cannot wait forever\" Harry Kane's Man Utd preference, secret transfer meeting and PSG hijack attempt Onana has already explained the specifics of his style of play that will benefit United, which will allow United to play with a higher back-line and to dominate more territory, while their possession should also increase as the Cameroonian is comfortable with playing out from the back. Sport Witness have cited reports in the Italian press from Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport claiming that Onana was given reassurances from Ten Hag that a deal was on track with the two clubs continuing to negotiate the finer details to clinch the move. It adds that the former Ajax star is planning to travel to Manchester on Sunday or Monday to undergo medical tests and seal the move. That would allow him to fly out with United on their pre-season tour, which starts next week.

Tell us what you think here. Negotiations had dragged on with the two clubs thought to be moderate valuations apart in the move, with both now set to cede some ground in order to process the deal. Inter are equally keen to complete the deal promptly to allow them to invest in other targets. Ten Hag has driven United’s transfer pursuit of Onana, over that of Porto shot-stopper Diogo Costa or David Raya of Brentford. He is aware of his strengths and weaknesses but is convinced the Inter goalkeeper is his man at Old Trafford. United completing the signing of Onana will allow them to move onto other targets, most notably Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund. It will also speed up the expected departure of Dean Henderson, who Nottingham Forest want to sign on a permanent deal with a possible fee of £30million.","pubDate":"2023-07-16 12:10:16","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30478442.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1496988068.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Tiger in town for Open as Christensen qualifies in Woods’ absence","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23658671.new-tiger-town-open-christensen-qualifies-woods-absence/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Christensen was the only amateur to make it through final qualifying across four venues.","content":"Tiger Christensen came through final qualifying at West Lancashire Golf Club in Crosby, near Liverpool, earlier this month to book his major debut.

To me he’s the greatest of all time,” said the Arizona University student “I think it’s really special what he’s done for the game, changed the entire game and made it more popular, and his achievements are just unbelievable. “It’s something you could look up to.” Referring to how he got his name he added: “It’s not only named after Tiger Woods – my dad has a very good friend who’s a retired boxer and his ring name was Tiger so it’s 50/50.” “For me it’s never been (a burden) because it’s just my birth name. I’m glad to be called Tiger. “I understand everything I’m ever going to do they are going to compare me to him straightaway but at the end of the day it’s a different time, I don’t have any connection to him. It’s just a name.” “I played a lot of football when I was younger and I always wanted to be a football pro until I was about 10 and then I started playing US kids tournaments and that is when I transitioned to wanting to become a golf professional,” added the Hamburg-born golfer, whose world ranking is above 3,700. Christensen was the only amateur to make it through final qualifying across four venues, only three days after almost securing a place via the European Amateur Championship in Estonia. A month earlier the teenager made his DP World Tour debut with an appearance in the Porsche European Open held in the city of his birth, although rounds of 80 and 79 saw him miss the cut by some distance on 13 over. “I cope with pressure pretty good, although at the DP World Tour event there was a new pressure I hadn’t had in playing with spectators,” he said of his imminent Open appearance. “Usually in amateur events only the final couple of groups, if you are playing well, get spectators but I think the DP World Tour event really helped me going into the Open.

Kane “has clearly signalled in all conversations that his decision (to join Bayern this summer) has been taken and if he sticks to that, then we’ll get him because Tottenham will have to give way”, Hoeness said. It has been reported that Bayern has agreed on personal terms with Kane, but an initial 70-million-euro ($76-million) bid was rejected by Spurs who are said to be demanding at least 100 million euros to part with their talismanic striker who has been included in the London club’s squad for their pre-season Asia-Pacific tour. The German champion is said to be intent on securing the signing of England’s record scorer, whose contract with Spurs runs out in 2024. Kane’s camp is believed to have approved the move, but Bayern needs an agreement on a transfer fee with Tottenham to seal the transfer. Hoeness said Kane “wants to play in an international competition and Tottenham are not qualified next season” for Europe “unlike our club”. The striker “now has the chance to come play for one of the best clubs in Europe”, added Hoeness, a member of a Bayern committee overseeing this summer’s recruitment alongside Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Jan-Christian Dreesen and coach Thomas Tuchel. Hoeness admitted that negotiating with Spurs president Daniel Levy was not easy. Levy, he said, is “intelligent and we first have to get him to a stage where he will figure out an amount” for the transfer. “He is trying to buy time, he is a seasoned professional, I appreciate him a lot. But on the other hand, we weren’t born yesterday.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2023-07-16 11:44:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal's £105m outlay on Declan Rice is a 'good investment'","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12304113/Arsene-Wenger-insists-Arsenals-105m-outlay-Declan-Rice-good-investment.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Building a squad with a focus on youth was a hallmark of Wenger's 22-year stint at the Gunners, and he hailed the arrival of Rice at the club as a continuation of that philosophy.","content":"Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal's £105m outlay on Declan Rice is a 'good investment' as the Gunners legend laments that he 'had to cope with no money at all' during his time in charge Arsenal legend Arsene Wenger hailed the club's signing of Declan Rice Former West Ham star was unveiled as the club's record signing on Saturday Wenger reflected such funds were not available towards the end of his tenure By Adrian Bishop For Mailonline Updated: 14:08, 16 July 2023 e-mail View comments Arsene Wenger has revealed that he sees Arsenal 's club-record signing of Declan Rice as a good investment in the squads future. Following weeks of speculation, the former West Ham captain's move to the Emirates was finally confirmed on Saturday, with the £105m fee eclipsing the £100m Man City paid for Jack Grealish to make Rice the most expensive British footballer ever. After coming agonisingly close to a first Premier League title in nearly two decades last season, Mikel Arteta has been afforded a sizeable war chest to continue his side's progress in 2023-24. Along with the capture Rice, Arsenal have also signed Kai Havertz from Chelsea for £65m and Jurrien Timber from Ajax for £40m, with further additions expected before the end of the transfer window. Building a squad with a focus on youth was a hallmark of Wenger's 22-year stint at the Gunners, and he hailed the arrival of Rice at the club as a continuation of that philosophy. Arsene Wenger hailed Arsenal's club-record £105m signing of Declan Rice from West Ham The legendary Gunners boss called the move a 'good investment' and tipped the squad to win the Premier League 'I think it is a good investment,' Wenger told Eurosport . 'Overall, personally I think they have made good buys as they are players who are now mature, 23,24, and still young so can stay together for a few years. 'They will be under more pressure after last year, but they have learned a lot and they can show they can deal with that pressure now.' The signings of Rice, Timber and Havertz already rank among the ten highest transfer fees paid in the club's history, with a further four players on the list having signed with the club in the five years since Wegner's departure in 2018. Reflecting on the funds available to him towards the end of his time in charge, the 73-year-old admitted that he was forced to develop his squad utilising a different approach. Arsenal's last Premier League win came nearly two decades ago with Wenger at the helm 'I had to cope with no money at all, so you have to find a different way. 'Arsenal is now in a good financial situation and bought what they think will win the championship.' Arsenal's last Premier League triumph came during Wenger's tenure at the club and the Frenchman backed his former side to finally reclaim the title next season. 'I believe we will win the championship, it is as simple as that.'

Lorient, who tried to sign attacking midfielder Adam in January, Lille and Club Brugge are all keen on signing the 19 year-old this summer. Scotland under-21 international Adam joined City from Celtic three years ago and is tipped for a bright future for club and country after impressing across Europe at youth level. However, with a congested pathway to first-team football at City Adam could move on in search of more opportunities. City’s youth team products have become an increasingly lucrative revenue stream for the club in more recent years. Man City midfielder Josh Adam is attracting interest from clubs in Belgium and France Last summer Gavin Bazunu, Aro Muric, Juan Larios, Romeo Lavia, Darko Gyabi and Sam Edozie all left City for a combined sum in excess of £50m. This week Southampton sealed the £15m signing of City midfield prospect Shea Charles, and goalkeeper James Trafford is set to join Burnley in a £19m deal after inspiring England’s under-21s to Euros glory. Pep Guardiola's side have also strengthened their side this summer, with Mateo Kovacic arriving from Chelsea for £25 million. They have lost Ilkay Gundogan to Barcelona on a free transfer, though, and doubts remain over Riyad Mahrez's future amid links with Saudi Arabia. City's title defence will get underway in just under a month's time, when they face club legend Vincent Kompany's Burnley side in August 11.

The 25-year-old was joined by teammate Tyrell Malacia in his brand new £700,000 Rolls-Royce for a 20-minute private shopping trip, for which the shutters remained down. Rashford, who wore a green tracksuit with white trainers, was also seen signing autographs for fans. One young supporter was even wearing a number 10 Man United shirt with the England striker's name on the back, and received a signature from his hero. It came after United's international players were pictured back in training for the first time, as they gear up for a pre-season tour of America. Marcus Rashford parked on double yellow lines in Cheshire on Saturday as he visited a jewellers He was joined by Man United teammate Tyrell Malacia in his £700,000 Rolls-Royce The 25-year-old striker signed an autograph for a young fan donning a Man United shirt The likes of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Rashford were all pictured heading into Carrington on Saturday, and the squad seemed in a buoyant mood as they began to dust off the cobwebs ahead of next season. Those who did not take part in the post-season internationals have been back in training for over a week now, with their first game held last week as they beat Leeds 2-0 in Norway in their opening game of the summer. Non-internationals such as Mason Mount , Raphael Varane and Tom Heaton played in the game which saw youngsters Noam Emeran and Joe Hugill net in the second half to give Erik ten Hag's side the win. They will continue their campaign against Lyon on Wednesday before heading to the United States for games against Arsenal, Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Rashford's last football came just over a month ago, when he played half an hour in England's 4-0 win over Malta and just under an hour of the 7-0 victory over North Macedonia, scoring on the stroke of half time. The England forward was seen smiling jubilantly on his return to training with fellow Red Devils attacker Anthony Elanga, who will be hoping to kick on next season and earn more first team opportunities. Rashford enjoyed the best goal soring season of his career in 2022-23, bagging 30 across all competitions as United came third in the league and one the League Cup. It came after Rashford returned to Carrington on Saturday as Manchester United geared up for the new season The striker painted a happy figure as he linked back up with the United squad Rashford was a key player for Erik ten Hag's side last season, scoring 30 goals as they won the League Cup and came third in the league He excelled on the left wing, but Erik ten Hag's failure to bring in a new striker could force him back into the middle again next season. The Red Devils were keen on Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund but have been stunned by his £68 million price tag , while fellow targets Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen would have been even more expensive. If he does want to keen Rashford on the left, Ten Hag's only obvious option through the middle is the injury-prone Anthony Martial, although he did experiment with Jadon Sancho as a false nine in a recent friendly. United will still be hoping to find a new striker before their first Premier League game of the season against Wolves n August 14.

But the United States-based 19-year-old accepts the similarities end with sharing the same name, country of residence and preference for an orange-and-black striped animal driver headcover. 🇩🇪Tiger Christensen (5/5) — The Open (@TheOpen) “He’s a pretty big inspiration. To me he’s the greatest of all time,” said the Arizona University student “I think it’s really special what he’s done for the game, changed the entire game and made it more popular, and his achievements are just unbelievable. “It’s something you could look up to.” Referring to how he got his name he added: “It’s not only named after Tiger Woods – my dad has a very good friend who’s a retired boxer and his ring name was Tiger so it’s 50/50.” “For me it’s never been (a burden) because it’s just my birth name. I’m glad to be called Tiger. “I understand everything I’m ever going to do they are going to compare me to him straightaway but at the end of the day it’s a different time, I don’t have any connection to him. It’s just a name.” “I played a lot of football when I was younger and I always wanted to be a football pro until I was about 10 and then I started playing US kids tournaments and that is when I transitioned to wanting to become a golf professional,” added the Hamburg-born golfer, whose world ranking is above 3,700. Christensen was the only amateur to make it through final qualifying across four venues, only three days after almost securing a place via the European Amateur Championship in Estonia. A month earlier the teenager made his DP World Tour debut with an appearance in the Porsche European Open held in the city of his birth, although rounds of 80 and 79 saw him miss the cut by some distance on 13 over. “I cope with pressure pretty good, although at the DP World Tour event there was a new pressure I hadn’t had in playing with spectators,” he said of his imminent Open appearance. “Usually in amateur events only the final couple of groups, if you are playing well, get spectators but I think the DP World Tour event really helped me going into the Open.

I played the US Open qualifying and fell just short. I felt it wasn’t far away. “It’s going to be a great experience. I’m going to go with zero expectations and take it all in. “But my final goal, which is supported by smaller goals, is to win as many majors as I can.”","pubDate":"2023-07-16 12:02:10","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17005382/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"OM : la patte Marcelino jugée par les Nîmois","link":"https://www.onzemondial.com/ligue-1/om-la-patte-marcelino-jugee-par-les-nimois-841817","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"L'entraîneur de Nîmes, Frédéric Bompard, est revenu sur le match face à l’OM. Il a décrit son adversaire du jour, Marcelino.","content":"Hier soir, l’OM s’est imposé face au Nîmes Olympique grâce à un doublé de Vitinha pour le premier match de la pré-saison. La première de Marcelino en tant qu’entraîneur olympien est réussite et beaucoup de Marseillais ont eu du temps de jeu. L’adversaire du jour a pu commenter son nouveau style de jeu imposé par le coach espagnol. Après la rencontre, Frédéric Bompard, anciennement adjoint à l’OM et aujourd’hui coach à Nîmes s’est entretenu avec La Provence pour parler de la mise en place de Marcelino. « Le jeu est différent de celui de la saison dernière. L'an dernier, ça pressait très haut. Même s'ils sont quand même allés nous chercher, ils sont venus nous presser. Certains joueurs ont encore ce genre d'automatismes », a d’abord commenté l’entraîneur de l’équipe de National. « Il y a peut-être un peu moins de jeu vers l'avant, beaucoup plus de jeu entre les lignes. On est plus dans le “tiki taka“ que ça ne l'était la saison dernière. Avec Tudor, c'était beaucoup plus du jeu vers l'avant à la récupération, du football direct. C'est ce qui change un peu. Après, ça reste qu'un match, il va falloir attendre encore un peu », a-t-il reconnu pour le quotidien régional. Frédéric Bompard a ensuite été interrogé sur le système utilisé par Marcelino. « Ce n’est n'est pas le même. L'année dernière, ça jouait à trois, là c'est à quatre. Hier, ils ont joué en 4-2-3-1, ils ont changé les joueurs à la mi-temps, comme nous d'ailleurs. Ce ne sera pas du tout le même OM que celui de la saison dernière, ça c'est sûr. J'ai bien aimé mon échange avec Marcelino, j'aime bien le personnage, le fait de discuter comme ça, ça m'a bien plu », a conclu l’entraîneur des crocos.

Kane “has clearly signalled in all conversations that his decision (to join Bayern this summer) has been taken and if he sticks to that, then we’ll get him because Tottenham will have to give way”, Hoeness said. It has been reported that Bayern has agreed on personal terms with Kane, but an initial 70-million-euro ($76-million) bid was rejected by Spurs who are said to be demanding at least 100 million euros to part with their talismanic striker who has been included in the London club’s squad for their pre-season Asia-Pacific tour. The German champion is said to be intent on securing the signing of England’s record scorer, whose contract with Spurs runs out in 2024. Kane’s camp is believed to have approved the move, but Bayern needs an agreement on a transfer fee with Tottenham to seal the transfer. Hoeness said Kane “wants to play in an international competition and Tottenham are not qualified next season” for Europe “unlike our club”. The striker “now has the chance to come play for one of the best clubs in Europe”, added Hoeness, a member of a Bayern committee overseeing this summer’s recruitment alongside Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Jan-Christian Dreesen and coach Thomas Tuchel. Hoeness admitted that negotiating with Spurs president Daniel Levy was not easy. Levy, he said, is “intelligent and we first have to get him to a stage where he will figure out an amount” for the transfer. “He is trying to buy time, he is a seasoned professional, I appreciate him a lot. But on the other hand, we weren’t born yesterday.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2023-07-16 11:44:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"}]}
