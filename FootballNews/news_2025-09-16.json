I gave EVERYTHING with passion and I regret NOTHING,\" Umtiti, whose career had been plagued by injury, said in a post on Instagram.Born in Cameroon, Umtiti moved to France as a child living with his family in Lyon where he began his professional career.Umtiti moved to Barcelona in 2016 winning two La Liga titles and three Copa del Rey trophies during his seven years in Spain.The centre-back was one of the architects of France's 2018 World Cup title, scoring the only goal in the semi-final against Belgium. He becomes the fifth World Cup winner in Russia to retire, after Raphael Varane, Blaise Matuidi, Adil Rami, and Steve Mandanda. Umtiti signed for Lille in January 2024 after a loan spell in Italy with Lecce but played very few matches due to repeated injuries and knee surgery.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID
