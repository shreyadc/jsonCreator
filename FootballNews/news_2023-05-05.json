Napoli secured the one point they needed for the Serie A crown with a 1-1 draw against Udinese at Dacia Arena in Udine, Italy, on Thursday. By improving to 80 points on 25 wins, five draws and three losses, Napoli extended their lead over second-place Lazio to 16 points and clinched the top spot in the Italian competition with five matches to spare. Kim, a rock of a center back, played a major role in Napoli's championship run in his first season in Italy. He is the third South Korean player to win a top-division title in one of the five major European leagues -- England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France -- after former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung, who won four Premier League titles, and former Bayern Munich attacker Jeong Woo-yeong, the 2018-2019 Bundesliga champion. Kim has started in 32 of Napoli's 33 matches so far. And he hit the ground running in the new league, after Napoli acquired him to fill a huge hole on their backline after the departure of star center back Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea. Kim earned the Serie A Player of the Month award for September. He was the first Asian player to be so honored in the Italian league. Then for October, Kim was named the Player of the Month by the Italian Footballers' Association. With Kim manning the defense, Napoli have so far conceded the fewest goals in the league with 23. A successful first season in Serie A has generated a ton of transfer speculation around Kim, who has been linked to everyone from Manchester United to Paris Saint-Germain to Tottenham Hotspur, which feature fellow South Korean star Son Heung-min. This is Napoli's third Serie A title and first since 1990, with the late legend Diego Maradona in the fold. Napoli had won their first title three years earlier. But following those glory years, Napoli suffered through financial trouble and even got relegated to the third division as recently as 2006. Victor Osimhen scored the equalizer for Napoli in the 52nd, after Udinese had opened the scoring in the 13th minute courtesy of Sandi Lovric.

I’m really happy and proud,” Haaland told Sky Sports. The 22-year-old has another five games to add to his tally. Haaland’s 35th top-flight goal of the season came via a deft finish in the second half of a 3-0 win against the Hammers that sent City back to the top of the league. He was given a guard of honour by his team-mates, boss Pep Guardiola and the club’s backroom staff after the final whistle at Etihad Stadium. “I’ve not seen it before either,” Haaland added. “It was a nice feeling scoring that goal, it always is. “It was painful when everyone hit me on the back in the guard of honour.” Cole’s 34 goals for Newcastle in 1993-94 were matched by Shearer as he fired Blackburn to the title the following year but there were 22 teams in the top flight in both seasons, giving them an extra four matches to play – Shearer started all 42 in his record season, while Cole missed two in his.Haaland, in his debut season in English football, has set the new marker in just his 31st game of the year. His 35 goals are also the most by a player in a single campaign in the English top division since Ron Davies scored 37 for Southampton in 1966-67. Dixie Dean holds the record with 60 in 39 games for Everton in 1927-28. (BBC Sports) Published on By Published on By Kolkata Knight Riders held their nerve at a critical stage in the game to secure a thrilling come-from-behind win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, on Thursday – their fourth win of the season. Different players played their parts at different times to hand SRH their sixth loss of the season, in Hyderabad. Kolkata Knight Riders 171/9 in 20 overs (Rinku Singh 46, Nitish Rana 42; Marco Jansen 2-24, T Natarajan 2-30) Sunrisers Hyderabad 166/8 in 20 overs (Aiden Markram 41, Heinrich Klaasen 36; Shardul Thakur 2-23, Vaibhav Arora 2-32) by 5 runs Published on By A solid batting show led by Imam-ul-Haq and a steely bowling performance enabled Pakistan to register a series-clinching 26-run win against New Zealand in the third ODI at National Stadium, Karachi on Wednesday. Put into bat as per the trends of the series, Pakistan ended up with a competitive even if not daunting total of 287 on what was a typically slow Karachi surface. All the home batters got starts but only Imam managed to convert it into a substantial knock of 90. Skipper Babar Azam looked fluent for his 54 but fell soon after he got to the milestone. The century stand between Imam and Babar put Pakistan on track for a big score even as stroke-making became evidently tougher against the older ball. New Zealand hung in there with regular strikes to ensure that Pakistan weren’t running away with the game. In fact, it took a neat cameo from Shadab Khan to push the hosts past the 280-run mark. Barring Henry Shipley, all the New Zealand bowlers managed to keep things reasonably tight with Adam Milne and Matt Henry being the most successful bowlers. In reply, New Zealand openers got them off to a solid start and although the scoring rate wasn’t rapid, it was steady enough to put Pakistan under pressure. Unlike the Rawalpindi leg where dew was a massive factor in the second innings, Karachi saw dry conditions which enabled the side bowling second to stake their claims. Pakistan’s bowlers put on a show of efficient defensive bowling to keep a lid on the scoring rate while also chipping away at the wickets. Tom Blundell produced an impressive fifty while skipper Tom Latham got another start but the latter wasn’t able to bat deep into the innings. New Zealand struggled considerably to up the ante at the back end of the innings and it took a fabulous 45-ball 64 from Cole McConchie to reduce the margin of defeat, as the chase never really got close, particularly in the last 20 overs of the innings. Pakistan’s spinners were tidy and ensured that the New Zealand batters weren’t given freebies to release the pressure while their pacers were accurate upfront as well as at the death. With the surface slowing down throughout the contest, run-scoring wasn’t as straightforward as it was in Rawalpindi. Pakistan 287/6 in 50 overs (Imam-ul-Haq 90, Babar Azam 54; Matt Henry 3-54) beat New Zealand 261 all out in 49.1 overs (Tom Blundell 65, Cole McConchie 64*; Naseem Shah 2-42) by 26 runs","pubDate":"2023-05-04 23:40:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Борнмут - Челсі: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч 35 туру АПЛ 06.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/05/928492/bornmut-chelsi-de-dyvytysya-match-apl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 35-го туру АПЛ Челсі Михайла Мудрика на виїзді зіграє з Борнмутом Іллі Забарного.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у суботу, 6 травня.

The game got off to an extraordinary start, with Jhon Lucumi scoring an own goal in the opening 36 seconds. Bologna fought back, with two goals disallowed after VAR reviews. The visitors were also plagued by injuries, with Adama Soumaoro limping off the field. Despite being in a training retreat following their third consecutive defeat, Empoli showed determination and resilience. Razvan Marin’s free kick led to Jean-Daniel Akpa Akpro getting a glancing header for their second goal, and Nicolò Cambiaghi scored on the counter-attack for their third. Riccardo Orsolini did score a goal for Bologna from a penalty late in the game, but it was not enough to change the outcome.

Kun Bokator: Believed to date back more than 1,000 years to the armies of the Khmer empire, which spread across much of Southeast Asia, Kun Bokator is perhaps the most quintessentially Cambodian martial art. The graceful style, incorporating elbow blows, shin strikes, locks and grapples, makes its SEA Games debut just a year after being inscribed on Unesco’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and so finds itself in rude health only decades after nearly being erased. It barely survived the Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s, but Kun Bokator has since won new followers among Cambodians keen to preserve their culture — Unesco called it “an embodiment of Cambodia’s social, cultural and religious values.” Cambodia will have an obvious advantage in Kun Bokator. Teqball: In contrast to the ancient, locally rooted Kun Bokator, Teqball was invented as recently as 2012, in Hungary, played on a specially curved table, it is a mash-up of football and table tennis, requiring agility, stamina and acrobatic overhead kicks. Top international football teams including Spain and Portugal bond over games of Teqball during downtime at training, and legends such as Ronaldinho have become ambassadors for the game. It will be a demonstration sport at the SEA Games, as it seeks medal recognition at other sports events around the world.

In case you haven’t been paying attention, Sam Allardyce is the Leeds manager now, and his first game in charge comes at the Etihad. Allardyce might well believe that if his surname were Allardici , he would be in the Manchester City dugout instead, but fate is yet to intervene on that front. Instead the former one-game England manager has only four matches to save Leeds from dropping into the Championship. Usually, you would like to set the bar in the opening match after riling up your new charges. Against Manchester City, however, Allardyce faces a tough decision: whether to set a style for the remainder of the season or desperately hope to earn a surprising point against the champions by sticking 11 men behind the ball. After two years away from management, Allardyce will be eager to pit his wits against Pep Guardiola but he might need to accept damage limitation to build on for the final push.

Julen Lopetegui held his hands up for Wolves’s performance at the Amex Stadium – his team trailed 6-0 inside 66 minutes – but there is an argument to say that profuse apologies should probably suffice. Tottenham’s players acknowledged their poor showing at St James’ Park by refunding more than 3,000 fans the cost of their tickets, about £80,000 in total. Supporters are not held to ransom – well, they are in many ways – but it is the fans’ choice to follow their team up and down the country. Either way, Wolves are unlikely to get the benefit of the doubt if they put in another abject display at home to Aston Villa this weekend. Ben Fisher Wolves v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm 4) Spurs must end first-half horror shows “How shit must you be, it’s only 2-0,” sang the travelling Tottenham support at Anfield last Sunday. Perhaps Liverpool were slighted because they quickly made it 3-0 in the 15th minute, seemingly ending the contest. Spurs fought back, equalising in stoppage-time before throwing it away at the end, but their dreadful start confirmed the re-emergence of a theme of their season. Previously, they had trailed 2-0 and 5-0 at half-time to Manchester United and Newcastle United respectively and, although they salvaged a point against the former, they have regularly played with fire by running on auto-pilot in the first half of matches, sometimes crashing. In their last 33 games in all competitions, Spurs have scored 12 first-half goals, which have been good for an interval lead on five occasions. Thirteen times during the sequence, they have been behind at the break. David Hytner Tottenham v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm 5) Dyche needs to use bench options Sean Dyche is not a man for dynamic substitutions. At Burnley, his changes were generally pretty choreographed – they would see the two strikers changed between 60 and 70 minutes and a fresh winger sent on before the final whistle. At Everton the idea is to keep the starting XI on the pitch for the full match if they are not losing. In the draw against Leicester the only change came before half-time because of an injury to Séamus Coleman. At Crystal Palace, Mason Holgate’s red card in the 81st minute forced Dyche’s hand, before Neal Maupay was brought on in injury time. Amadou Onana and Demarai Gray were unused at the King Power Stadium, where a win would have taken Everton out of the relegation zone. Dyche has a decent squad at his disposal and needs to rethink how he uses it to get them out of trouble. WU Brighton v Everton , Monday 5.30pm Everton’s Demarai Gray (left) will be hoping for some game time against the Seagulls. Photograph: Simon Dael/Shutterstock 6) Cornet deserves bigger West Ham role West Ham’s failure to strengthen on the left flank is baffling. It was clear that they needed an alternative to Aaron Cresswell at left-back last summer. David Moyes went for Emerson Palmieri, but the former Chelsea defender has not shown that he can play in a back four. Emerson was given a chasing by Crystal Palace last week and looks more comfortable as a wing-back. Yet West Ham lack attacking impetus when they switch to a back three. Moyes has a lot of attackers capable of playing on the left wing, but few have produced this season. Pablo Fornals has struggled, while four of Saïd Benrahma’s five goals have been penalties. It is not enough given that the Algerian has started 20 games, but Moyes has not managed to replace him. A lot of money was wasted on Nikola Vlasic – the Croatian is now on loan at Torino – and Maxwel Cornet has barely featured since recovering from a long-term injury. Cornet came on in the 89th minute at Palace and was an unused substitute against Manchester City on Wednesday. He surely deserves more minutes against Manchester United.

Jürgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah have already shown the way. The pair sat down to discuss penalty-taking duties after Salah had missed his second in succession during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on 9 April, the last time Liverpool failed to win a game. Cool heads prevailed and Salah has converted two penalties in the past week, helping Liverpool establish their best winning streak of the campaign and moving to 29 goals for the season in all competitions. One more will take him to the 30-goal mark for the fourth time in seven seasons at Anfield. “We had a conversation and he wanted to stay the penalty-taker,” Klopp revealed. “I said: ‘OK, you are.’ He didn’t feel great in that moment because the pressure increases with the penalties you miss. He could have given the ball to Fab or Trent, but he smashed them and turned it around. He enjoys these situations.” Andy Hunter Liverpool v Brentford, Saturday 5.30pm Mohamed Salah smashes in a penalty against Fulham at Anfield. Photograph: Jon Super/AP 8) Yates could step in with Danilo out It does not get much bigger than this for Nottingham Forest. With the calamity around them in the battle for survival, a single victory could be enough to save them. The roof was lifted off the City Ground by beating Brighton in their most recent home game and considering their sole away victory this season came against Southampton, Steve Cooper will be targeting another three points. Like most weeks, Forest have an injury to contend with: Danilo will miss the next two matches after suffering a muscle problem at Brentford. The 22-year-old has been one of the more promising acquisitions from a chaotic January and was starting to settle in midfield. Ryan Yates looks to be the likely candidate rather than Cheikhou Kouyaté, Remo Freuler or the unpopular Jonjo Shelvey. The homegrown midfielder’s return to the starting lineup would provide an added boost to the Forest faithful for a crucial 90 minutes. WU Nottingham Forest v Southampton, Monday 8pm 9) Lampard to give youth a chance? The main thing to look out for is whether Chelsea lose again. Frank Lampard’s record at Chelsea reads: six matches, six defeats. Within those fixtures, they have looked like relegation candidates with their lack of desire, inability to create chances and dreadful defending. What can poor old Frank do to change things? Resigning would be the most sensible idea, but he is no quitter. His brief success during a first Chelsea managerial spell was down to bringing through young players because of a transfer embargo and, after watching six pitiful losses this time, he might as well do likewise. Noni Madueke was one bright spot at Arsenal in his first start under Lampard. Carney Chukwuemeka, Lewis Hall and Omari Hutchinson have all shown promise this season but cannot make a match-day squad, leaving it up to the tried and tested players to fail. There is nothing to lose for Lampard now – he might as well help his replacement out. WU Bournemouth v Chelsea , Saturday 3pm 01:33 'We were nice to play against': Lampard and Arteta on Arsenal's easy 3-1 victory – video 10) Time for the Foxes to bare teeth It is not Dean Smith’s fault that Jonny Evans has been injured for much of the season and Wesley Fofana was so determined to join Chelsea last summer. Still, Smith has no time for excuses as he battles to keep Leicester up. The main focus for the manager must be on getting more from the centre-backs at his disposal. Clean sheets are precious in a relegation battle and the worry for Smith is that Leicester remain too open. They have shipped seven goals in his first four games and were lucky to concede only twice in Monday’s draw with Everton. Daniel Iversen had to make too many saves and it must have worried Smith to see his defence struggle to deal with Everton’s physical approach. Admittedly they will face a different test at Fulham, who cannot be as direct without the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic leading the line, but Leicester have to be harder to beat, starting in central defence.

Some teams have 10 games left, others have 11, or 12. Brighton even have 13. The international break has provided the perfect moment to reset. It’s also provided the opportunity for predictions and to consider, just for a second, the boldest things that could happen before we see the trophy lifted aloft. I apologise to anybody who believes in football jinxes for writing the above. Even thinking it could make a lot of Arsenal supporters nervous. The big goal is to win the Premier League, obviously. But with the way Arsenal are playing… is it out of the realm of possibility to suggest they could do so without losing another game? Mikel Arteta has 10 games left to navigate, with an eight-point lead over Manchester City, who can cut it to five if they win their game in hand. As harsh as it may sound, anything other than a title win now would be a huge disappointment for a brilliant young squad who have played the most thrilling and cutting football in the division this season. You’d expect Arsenal to walk through home fixtures against Leeds, Southampton and Wolves. You’d also expect them to top Brighton and Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. Away trips to West Ham and Nottingham Forest? They’re huge favourites. The big three tests that remain are journeys to Newcastle, Manchester City and Liverpool. This Arsenal team are resilient. They work harder than we’ve seen any Arsenal side do in recent years, digging in when matches are tough to get a result. Arteta has built a togetherness and understanding that means even if an important player is missing, Arsenal still manage to largely play the same way. It’s a bold prediction, but Arsenal getting the job done in the dullest way possible by not suffering defeat feels like the climax their season deserves. Liverpool’s exit from the Champions League actually frees them up to concentrate on the most important aspect of their season: qualifying for next season’s Champions League. Yes, Reds fans would have wanted to remain in Europe’s elite competition, but after a terrible season, the outside shot Jurgen Klopp’s side have at finishing in the top four is the most vital thing to latch on to. Liverpool’s results continue to be all over the place. After the 7-0 destruction of Manchester United, you’d have put your house on them to push on and clinch fourth. They followed this with defeat to Bournemouth, though, then a second loss in as many matches to Real Madrid. Klopp faces a defining run to the end of the campaign with his team in sixth, seven points behind Spurs, who have played two games more and will be expecting a new lease of life now that Antonio Conte has gone. Newcastle could prove to be the real danger, though, and currently sit five points ahead of Liverpool on equal games played. The biggest hurdle is immediately on the horizon. In the next three games, Liverpool face Man City and Chelsea away before inviting league-leaders Arsenal to Anfield. Spurs travel to Merseyside on April 30th for a match that is likely to highlight or scribble out whether or not this prediction is still on. Perhaps it’s just the club’s incredible consistency and competitiveness in recent years, or perhaps it’s naivety. I just expect leadership figures like Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk and Andrew Robertson to drag this club through to the end. Liverpool look great when things click. They are thrust forwards with the exuberance of Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nuñez, two players who will elevate the team’s overall output if they can find consistency. It’s still an experienced squad, one that is used to achieving great things, hunting down teams that do not have that level of experience. It’s going to be tight, but it’s not over yet for the Reds. Erling Haaland to Score 40 Goals Honestly, you could probably make this section “Erling Haaland to Score 50 Goals” and you’d still have people arguing it’s not that bold. The Man City striker has 28 goals with 27 games played, meaning he needs a measly 12 in the remaining 11. It’s ridiculous this even seems possible. At this point, the difficulty of City’s fixtures don’t really seem to matter for Haaland. He is a constant threat against anyone when his teammates open up their passing range and look for his runs, rather than constantly recycling for the perfect opportunity. City need to maintain pace with Arsenal for this to come to fruition. If the Gunners wrap things up early and City are still in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola’s attention is likely to turn to winning the trophy that still eludes him away from Barcelona. Haaland’s game time may suffer as a result. Haaland faces Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on April 26th. Should City come through that within touching distance, the Norwegian phenom should be in place to become the first man in history to hit 40 Premier League goals in one season. The fact it just seems inevitable he will break the current record of 34 is hilarious and an indictment of a man whose stunning debut season won’t be topped for a long, long time. West Ham to Escape Relegation on Goal Difference After meticulously going through each of the relegation candidates’ remaining fixtures, I have come up with a bold prediction that feels like it would win you a tidy sum if you bet on it right now: West Ham to remain in the Premier League by goal difference, the finest of margins. My extremely scientific method of “doing predictions on gut feeling” has Southampton accumulating seven more points, leaving them bottom on 30 points. I predict Bournemouth and West Ham will get nine more points each, moving them both to 33. The magic ball also says Leicester City will pull themselves clear with 15 more points, while Nottingham Forest only get seven more, putting them on the same total as Bournemouth and the Hammers. This is where it gets dramatic. West Ham may currently reside below Forest, but they are 17 goals clear on minus 10. While I don’t expect them to do well by any means, Forest are in trouble of doing slightly worse, putting them down to the Championship in the process. Points to be equal, but GD to be heavily lopsided in favour of David Moyes’ men, leaving them clutching onto their place in the top flight. Expect the relegation battle to go right down to the final match, and indeed, the final goal","pubDate":"2023-05-04 22:56:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessweeklyzw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ланс - Марсель: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч 34 туру Ліги 1 06.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/05/928496/lans-marsel-de-dyvytysya-match-lihy-1","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 34 туру французької Ліги 1 Марсель Руслана Маліновського на виїзді зіграє з Лансом.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у суботу, 6 травня.

Napoli secured the one point they needed for the Serie A crown with a 1-1 draw against Udinese at Dacia Arena in Udine, Italy, on Thursday. By improving to 80 points on 25 wins, five draws and three losses, Napoli extended their lead over second-place Lazio to 16 points and clinched the top spot in the Italian competition with five matches to spare. Kim, a rock of a center back, played a major role in Napoli's championship run in his first season in Italy. He is the third South Korean player to win a top-division title in one of the five major European leagues -- England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France -- after former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung, who won four Premier League titles, and former Bayern Munich attacker Jeong Woo-yeong, the 2018-2019 Bundesliga champion. Kim has started in 32 of Napoli's 33 matches so far. And he hit the ground running in the new league, after Napoli acquired him to fill a huge hole on their backline after the departure of star center back Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea. Kim earned the Serie A Player of the Month award for September. He was the first Asian player to be so honored in the Italian league. Then for October, Kim was named the Player of the Month by the Italian Footballers' Association. With Kim manning the defense, Napoli have so far conceded the fewest goals in the league with 23. A successful first season in Serie A has generated a ton of transfer speculation around Kim, who has been linked to everyone from Manchester United to Paris Saint-Germain to Tottenham Hotspur, which feature fellow South Korean star Son Heung-min. This is Napoli's third Serie A title and first since 1990, with the late legend Diego Maradona in the fold. Napoli had won their first title three years earlier. But following those glory years, Napoli suffered through financial trouble and even got relegated to the third division as recently as 2006. Victor Osimhen scored the equalizer for Napoli in the 52nd, after Udinese had opened the scoring in the 13th minute courtesy of Sandi Lovric.

I’m really happy and proud,” Haaland told Sky Sports. The 22-year-old has another five games to add to his tally. Haaland’s 35th top-flight goal of the season came via a deft finish in the second half of a 3-0 win against the Hammers that sent City back to the top of the league. He was given a guard of honour by his team-mates, boss Pep Guardiola and the club’s backroom staff after the final whistle at Etihad Stadium. “I’ve not seen it before either,” Haaland added. “It was a nice feeling scoring that goal, it always is. “It was painful when everyone hit me on the back in the guard of honour.” Cole’s 34 goals for Newcastle in 1993-94 were matched by Shearer as he fired Blackburn to the title the following year but there were 22 teams in the top flight in both seasons, giving them an extra four matches to play – Shearer started all 42 in his record season, while Cole missed two in his.Haaland, in his debut season in English football, has set the new marker in just his 31st game of the year. His 35 goals are also the most by a player in a single campaign in the English top division since Ron Davies scored 37 for Southampton in 1966-67. Dixie Dean holds the record with 60 in 39 games for Everton in 1927-28. (BBC Sports) Published on By Published on By Kolkata Knight Riders held their nerve at a critical stage in the game to secure a thrilling come-from-behind win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, on Thursday – their fourth win of the season. Different players played their parts at different times to hand SRH their sixth loss of the season, in Hyderabad. Kolkata Knight Riders 171/9 in 20 overs (Rinku Singh 46, Nitish Rana 42; Marco Jansen 2-24, T Natarajan 2-30) Sunrisers Hyderabad 166/8 in 20 overs (Aiden Markram 41, Heinrich Klaasen 36; Shardul Thakur 2-23, Vaibhav Arora 2-32) by 5 runs Published on By A solid batting show led by Imam-ul-Haq and a steely bowling performance enabled Pakistan to register a series-clinching 26-run win against New Zealand in the third ODI at National Stadium, Karachi on Wednesday. Put into bat as per the trends of the series, Pakistan ended up with a competitive even if not daunting total of 287 on what was a typically slow Karachi surface. All the home batters got starts but only Imam managed to convert it into a substantial knock of 90. Skipper Babar Azam looked fluent for his 54 but fell soon after he got to the milestone. The century stand between Imam and Babar put Pakistan on track for a big score even as stroke-making became evidently tougher against the older ball. New Zealand hung in there with regular strikes to ensure that Pakistan weren’t running away with the game. In fact, it took a neat cameo from Shadab Khan to push the hosts past the 280-run mark. Barring Henry Shipley, all the New Zealand bowlers managed to keep things reasonably tight with Adam Milne and Matt Henry being the most successful bowlers. In reply, New Zealand openers got them off to a solid start and although the scoring rate wasn’t rapid, it was steady enough to put Pakistan under pressure. Unlike the Rawalpindi leg where dew was a massive factor in the second innings, Karachi saw dry conditions which enabled the side bowling second to stake their claims. Pakistan’s bowlers put on a show of efficient defensive bowling to keep a lid on the scoring rate while also chipping away at the wickets. Tom Blundell produced an impressive fifty while skipper Tom Latham got another start but the latter wasn’t able to bat deep into the innings. New Zealand struggled considerably to up the ante at the back end of the innings and it took a fabulous 45-ball 64 from Cole McConchie to reduce the margin of defeat, as the chase never really got close, particularly in the last 20 overs of the innings. Pakistan’s spinners were tidy and ensured that the New Zealand batters weren’t given freebies to release the pressure while their pacers were accurate upfront as well as at the death. With the surface slowing down throughout the contest, run-scoring wasn’t as straightforward as it was in Rawalpindi. Pakistan 287/6 in 50 overs (Imam-ul-Haq 90, Babar Azam 54; Matt Henry 3-54) beat New Zealand 261 all out in 49.1 overs (Tom Blundell 65, Cole McConchie 64*; Naseem Shah 2-42) by 26 runs","pubDate":"2023-05-04 23:40:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Борнмут - Челсі: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч 35 туру АПЛ 06.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/05/928492/bornmut-chelsi-de-dyvytysya-match-apl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 35-го туру АПЛ Челсі Михайла Мудрика на виїзді зіграє з Борнмутом Іллі Забарного.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у суботу, 6 травня.

Kun Bokator: Believed to date back more than 1,000 years to the armies of the Khmer empire, which spread across much of Southeast Asia, Kun Bokator is perhaps the most quintessentially Cambodian martial art. The graceful style, incorporating elbow blows, shin strikes, locks and grapples, makes its SEA Games debut just a year after being inscribed on Unesco’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and so finds itself in rude health only decades after nearly being erased. It barely survived the Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s, but Kun Bokator has since won new followers among Cambodians keen to preserve their culture — Unesco called it “an embodiment of Cambodia’s social, cultural and religious values.” Cambodia will have an obvious advantage in Kun Bokator. Teqball: In contrast to the ancient, locally rooted Kun Bokator, Teqball was invented as recently as 2012, in Hungary, played on a specially curved table, it is a mash-up of football and table tennis, requiring agility, stamina and acrobatic overhead kicks. Top international football teams including Spain and Portugal bond over games of Teqball during downtime at training, and legends such as Ronaldinho have become ambassadors for the game. It will be a demonstration sport at the SEA Games, as it seeks medal recognition at other sports events around the world.

In case you haven’t been paying attention, Sam Allardyce is the Leeds manager now, and his first game in charge comes at the Etihad. Allardyce might well believe that if his surname were Allardici , he would be in the Manchester City dugout instead, but fate is yet to intervene on that front. Instead the former one-game England manager has only four matches to save Leeds from dropping into the Championship. Usually, you would like to set the bar in the opening match after riling up your new charges. Against Manchester City, however, Allardyce faces a tough decision: whether to set a style for the remainder of the season or desperately hope to earn a surprising point against the champions by sticking 11 men behind the ball. After two years away from management, Allardyce will be eager to pit his wits against Pep Guardiola but he might need to accept damage limitation to build on for the final push.

Julen Lopetegui held his hands up for Wolves’s performance at the Amex Stadium – his team trailed 6-0 inside 66 minutes – but there is an argument to say that profuse apologies should probably suffice. Tottenham’s players acknowledged their poor showing at St James’ Park by refunding more than 3,000 fans the cost of their tickets, about £80,000 in total. Supporters are not held to ransom – well, they are in many ways – but it is the fans’ choice to follow their team up and down the country. Either way, Wolves are unlikely to get the benefit of the doubt if they put in another abject display at home to Aston Villa this weekend. Ben Fisher Wolves v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm 4) Spurs must end first-half horror shows “How shit must you be, it’s only 2-0,” sang the travelling Tottenham support at Anfield last Sunday. Perhaps Liverpool were slighted because they quickly made it 3-0 in the 15th minute, seemingly ending the contest. Spurs fought back, equalising in stoppage-time before throwing it away at the end, but their dreadful start confirmed the re-emergence of a theme of their season. Previously, they had trailed 2-0 and 5-0 at half-time to Manchester United and Newcastle United respectively and, although they salvaged a point against the former, they have regularly played with fire by running on auto-pilot in the first half of matches, sometimes crashing. In their last 33 games in all competitions, Spurs have scored 12 first-half goals, which have been good for an interval lead on five occasions. Thirteen times during the sequence, they have been behind at the break. David Hytner Tottenham v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm 5) Dyche needs to use bench options Sean Dyche is not a man for dynamic substitutions. At Burnley, his changes were generally pretty choreographed – they would see the two strikers changed between 60 and 70 minutes and a fresh winger sent on before the final whistle. At Everton the idea is to keep the starting XI on the pitch for the full match if they are not losing. In the draw against Leicester the only change came before half-time because of an injury to Séamus Coleman. At Crystal Palace, Mason Holgate’s red card in the 81st minute forced Dyche’s hand, before Neal Maupay was brought on in injury time. Amadou Onana and Demarai Gray were unused at the King Power Stadium, where a win would have taken Everton out of the relegation zone. Dyche has a decent squad at his disposal and needs to rethink how he uses it to get them out of trouble.

It was clear that they needed an alternative to Aaron Cresswell at left-back last summer. David Moyes went for Emerson Palmieri, but the former Chelsea defender has not shown that he can play in a back four. Emerson was given a chasing by Crystal Palace last week and looks more comfortable as a wing-back. Yet West Ham lack attacking impetus when they switch to a back three. Moyes has a lot of attackers capable of playing on the left wing, but few have produced this season. Pablo Fornals has struggled, while four of Saïd Benrahma’s five goals have been penalties. It is not enough given that the Algerian has started 20 games, but Moyes has not managed to replace him. A lot of money was wasted on Nikola Vlasic – the Croatian is now on loan at Torino – and Maxwel Cornet has barely featured since recovering from a long-term injury. Cornet came on in the 89th minute at Palace and was an unused substitute against Manchester City on Wednesday. He surely deserves more minutes against Manchester United.

Jürgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah have already shown the way. The pair sat down to discuss penalty-taking duties after Salah had missed his second in succession during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on 9 April, the last time Liverpool failed to win a game. Cool heads prevailed and Salah has converted two penalties in the past week, helping Liverpool establish their best winning streak of the campaign and moving to 29 goals for the season in all competitions. One more will take him to the 30-goal mark for the fourth time in seven seasons at Anfield. “We had a conversation and he wanted to stay the penalty-taker,” Klopp revealed. “I said: ‘OK, you are.’ He didn’t feel great in that moment because the pressure increases with the penalties you miss. He could have given the ball to Fab or Trent, but he smashed them and turned it around. He enjoys these situations.” Andy Hunter Liverpool v Brentford, Saturday 5.30pm Mohamed Salah smashes in a penalty against Fulham at Anfield. Photograph: Jon Super/AP 8) Yates could step in with Danilo out It does not get much bigger than this for Nottingham Forest. With the calamity around them in the battle for survival, a single victory could be enough to save them. The roof was lifted off the City Ground by beating Brighton in their most recent home game and considering their sole away victory this season came against Southampton, Steve Cooper will be targeting another three points. Like most weeks, Forest have an injury to contend with: Danilo will miss the next two matches after suffering a muscle problem at Brentford. The 22-year-old has been one of the more promising acquisitions from a chaotic January and was starting to settle in midfield. Ryan Yates looks to be the likely candidate rather than Cheikhou Kouyaté, Remo Freuler or the unpopular Jonjo Shelvey. The homegrown midfielder’s return to the starting lineup would provide an added boost to the Forest faithful for a crucial 90 minutes. WU Nottingham Forest v Southampton, Monday 8pm 9) Lampard to give youth a chance? The main thing to look out for is whether Chelsea lose again. Frank Lampard’s record at Chelsea reads: six matches, six defeats. Within those fixtures, they have looked like relegation candidates with their lack of desire, inability to create chances and dreadful defending. What can poor old Frank do to change things? Resigning would be the most sensible idea, but he is no quitter. His brief success during a first Chelsea managerial spell was down to bringing through young players because of a transfer embargo and, after watching six pitiful losses this time, he might as well do likewise. Noni Madueke was one bright spot at Arsenal in his first start under Lampard. Carney Chukwuemeka, Lewis Hall and Omari Hutchinson have all shown promise this season but cannot make a match-day squad, leaving it up to the tried and tested players to fail. There is nothing to lose for Lampard now – he might as well help his replacement out. WU Bournemouth v Chelsea , Saturday 3pm 01:33 'We were nice to play against': Lampard and Arteta on Arsenal's easy 3-1 victory – video 10) Time for the Foxes to bare teeth It is not Dean Smith’s fault that Jonny Evans has been injured for much of the season and Wesley Fofana was so determined to join Chelsea last summer. Still, Smith has no time for excuses as he battles to keep Leicester up. The main focus for the manager must be on getting more from the centre-backs at his disposal. Clean sheets are precious in a relegation battle and the worry for Smith is that Leicester remain too open. They have shipped seven goals in his first four games and were lucky to concede only twice in Monday’s draw with Everton. Daniel Iversen had to make too many saves and it must have worried Smith to see his defence struggle to deal with Everton’s physical approach. Admittedly they will face a different test at Fulham, who cannot be as direct without the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic leading the line, but Leicester have to be harder to beat, starting in central defence.

Some teams have 10 games left, others have 11, or 12. Brighton even have 13. The international break has provided the perfect moment to reset. It’s also provided the opportunity for predictions and to consider, just for a second, the boldest things that could happen before we see the trophy lifted aloft. I apologise to anybody who believes in football jinxes for writing the above. Even thinking it could make a lot of Arsenal supporters nervous. The big goal is to win the Premier League, obviously. But with the way Arsenal are playing… is it out of the realm of possibility to suggest they could do so without losing another game? Mikel Arteta has 10 games left to navigate, with an eight-point lead over Manchester City, who can cut it to five if they win their game in hand. As harsh as it may sound, anything other than a title win now would be a huge disappointment for a brilliant young squad who have played the most thrilling and cutting football in the division this season. You’d expect Arsenal to walk through home fixtures against Leeds, Southampton and Wolves. You’d also expect them to top Brighton and Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. Away trips to West Ham and Nottingham Forest? They’re huge favourites. The big three tests that remain are journeys to Newcastle, Manchester City and Liverpool. This Arsenal team are resilient. They work harder than we’ve seen any Arsenal side do in recent years, digging in when matches are tough to get a result. Arteta has built a togetherness and understanding that means even if an important player is missing, Arsenal still manage to largely play the same way. It’s a bold prediction, but Arsenal getting the job done in the dullest way possible by not suffering defeat feels like the climax their season deserves. Liverpool’s exit from the Champions League actually frees them up to concentrate on the most important aspect of their season: qualifying for next season’s Champions League. Yes, Reds fans would have wanted to remain in Europe’s elite competition, but after a terrible season, the outside shot Jurgen Klopp’s side have at finishing in the top four is the most vital thing to latch on to. Liverpool’s results continue to be all over the place. After the 7-0 destruction of Manchester United, you’d have put your house on them to push on and clinch fourth. They followed this with defeat to Bournemouth, though, then a second loss in as many matches to Real Madrid. Klopp faces a defining run to the end of the campaign with his team in sixth, seven points behind Spurs, who have played two games more and will be expecting a new lease of life now that Antonio Conte has gone. Newcastle could prove to be the real danger, though, and currently sit five points ahead of Liverpool on equal games played. The biggest hurdle is immediately on the horizon. In the next three games, Liverpool face Man City and Chelsea away before inviting league-leaders Arsenal to Anfield. Spurs travel to Merseyside on April 30th for a match that is likely to highlight or scribble out whether or not this prediction is still on. Perhaps it’s just the club’s incredible consistency and competitiveness in recent years, or perhaps it’s naivety. I just expect leadership figures like Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk and Andrew Robertson to drag this club through to the end. Liverpool look great when things click. They are thrust forwards with the exuberance of Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nuñez, two players who will elevate the team’s overall output if they can find consistency. It’s still an experienced squad, one that is used to achieving great things, hunting down teams that do not have that level of experience. It’s going to be tight, but it’s not over yet for the Reds. Erling Haaland to Score 40 Goals Honestly, you could probably make this section “Erling Haaland to Score 50 Goals” and you’d still have people arguing it’s not that bold. The Man City striker has 28 goals with 27 games played, meaning he needs a measly 12 in the remaining 11. It’s ridiculous this even seems possible. At this point, the difficulty of City’s fixtures don’t really seem to matter for Haaland. He is a constant threat against anyone when his teammates open up their passing range and look for his runs, rather than constantly recycling for the perfect opportunity. City need to maintain pace with Arsenal for this to come to fruition. If the Gunners wrap things up early and City are still in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola’s attention is likely to turn to winning the trophy that still eludes him away from Barcelona. Haaland’s game time may suffer as a result. Haaland faces Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on April 26th. Should City come through that within touching distance, the Norwegian phenom should be in place to become the first man in history to hit 40 Premier League goals in one season. The fact it just seems inevitable he will break the current record of 34 is hilarious and an indictment of a man whose stunning debut season won’t be topped for a long, long time. West Ham to Escape Relegation on Goal Difference After meticulously going through each of the relegation candidates’ remaining fixtures, I have come up with a bold prediction that feels like it would win you a tidy sum if you bet on it right now: West Ham to remain in the Premier League by goal difference, the finest of margins. My extremely scientific method of “doing predictions on gut feeling” has Southampton accumulating seven more points, leaving them bottom on 30 points. I predict Bournemouth and West Ham will get nine more points each, moving them both to 33. The magic ball also says Leicester City will pull themselves clear with 15 more points, while Nottingham Forest only get seven more, putting them on the same total as Bournemouth and the Hammers. This is where it gets dramatic. West Ham may currently reside below Forest, but they are 17 goals clear on minus 10. While I don’t expect them to do well by any means, Forest are in trouble of doing slightly worse, putting them down to the Championship in the process. Points to be equal, but GD to be heavily lopsided in favour of David Moyes’ men, leaving them clutching onto their place in the top flight. Expect the relegation battle to go right down to the final match, and indeed, the final goal","pubDate":"2023-05-04 22:56:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessweeklyzw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ланс - Марсель: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч 34 туру Ліги 1 06.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/05/928496/lans-marsel-de-dyvytysya-match-lihy-1","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 34 туру французької Ліги 1 Марсель Руслана Маліновського на виїзді зіграє з Лансом.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у суботу, 6 травня.

Napoli secured the one point they needed for the Serie A crown with a 1-1 draw against Udinese at Dacia Arena in Udine, Italy, on Thursday. By improving to 80 points on 25 wins, five draws and three losses, Napoli extended their lead over second-place Lazio to 16 points and clinched the top spot in the Italian competition with five matches to spare. Kim, a rock of a center back, played a major role in Napoli's championship run in his first season in Italy. He is the third South Korean player to win a top-division title in one of the five major European leagues -- England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France -- after former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung, who won four Premier League titles, and former Bayern Munich attacker Jeong Woo-yeong, the 2018-2019 Bundesliga champion. Kim has started in 32 of Napoli's 33 matches so far. And he hit the ground running in the new league, after Napoli acquired him to fill a huge hole on their backline after the departure of star center back Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea. Kim earned the Serie A Player of the Month award for September. He was the first Asian player to be so honored in the Italian league. Then for October, Kim was named the Player of the Month by the Italian Footballers' Association. With Kim manning the defense, Napoli have so far conceded the fewest goals in the league with 23. A successful first season in Serie A has generated a ton of transfer speculation around Kim, who has been linked to everyone from Manchester United to Paris Saint-Germain to Tottenham Hotspur, which feature fellow South Korean star Son Heung-min. This is Napoli's third Serie A title and first since 1990, with the late legend Diego Maradona in the fold. Napoli had won their first title three years earlier. But following those glory years, Napoli suffered through financial trouble and even got relegated to the third division as recently as 2006. Victor Osimhen scored the equalizer for Napoli in the 52nd, after Udinese had opened the scoring in the 13th minute courtesy of Sandi Lovric.

I’m really happy and proud,” Haaland told Sky Sports. The 22-year-old has another five games to add to his tally. Haaland’s 35th top-flight goal of the season came via a deft finish in the second half of a 3-0 win against the Hammers that sent City back to the top of the league. He was given a guard of honour by his team-mates, boss Pep Guardiola and the club’s backroom staff after the final whistle at Etihad Stadium. “I’ve not seen it before either,” Haaland added. “It was a nice feeling scoring that goal, it always is. “It was painful when everyone hit me on the back in the guard of honour.” Cole’s 34 goals for Newcastle in 1993-94 were matched by Shearer as he fired Blackburn to the title the following year but there were 22 teams in the top flight in both seasons, giving them an extra four matches to play – Shearer started all 42 in his record season, while Cole missed two in his.Haaland, in his debut season in English football, has set the new marker in just his 31st game of the year. His 35 goals are also the most by a player in a single campaign in the English top division since Ron Davies scored 37 for Southampton in 1966-67. Dixie Dean holds the record with 60 in 39 games for Everton in 1927-28. (BBC Sports) Published on By Published on By Kolkata Knight Riders held their nerve at a critical stage in the game to secure a thrilling come-from-behind win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, on Thursday – their fourth win of the season. Different players played their parts at different times to hand SRH their sixth loss of the season, in Hyderabad. Kolkata Knight Riders 171/9 in 20 overs (Rinku Singh 46, Nitish Rana 42; Marco Jansen 2-24, T Natarajan 2-30) Sunrisers Hyderabad 166/8 in 20 overs (Aiden Markram 41, Heinrich Klaasen 36; Shardul Thakur 2-23, Vaibhav Arora 2-32) by 5 runs Published on By A solid batting show led by Imam-ul-Haq and a steely bowling performance enabled Pakistan to register a series-clinching 26-run win against New Zealand in the third ODI at National Stadium, Karachi on Wednesday. Put into bat as per the trends of the series, Pakistan ended up with a competitive even if not daunting total of 287 on what was a typically slow Karachi surface. All the home batters got starts but only Imam managed to convert it into a substantial knock of 90. Skipper Babar Azam looked fluent for his 54 but fell soon after he got to the milestone. The century stand between Imam and Babar put Pakistan on track for a big score even as stroke-making became evidently tougher against the older ball. New Zealand hung in there with regular strikes to ensure that Pakistan weren’t running away with the game. In fact, it took a neat cameo from Shadab Khan to push the hosts past the 280-run mark. Barring Henry Shipley, all the New Zealand bowlers managed to keep things reasonably tight with Adam Milne and Matt Henry being the most successful bowlers. In reply, New Zealand openers got them off to a solid start and although the scoring rate wasn’t rapid, it was steady enough to put Pakistan under pressure. Unlike the Rawalpindi leg where dew was a massive factor in the second innings, Karachi saw dry conditions which enabled the side bowling second to stake their claims. Pakistan’s bowlers put on a show of efficient defensive bowling to keep a lid on the scoring rate while also chipping away at the wickets. Tom Blundell produced an impressive fifty while skipper Tom Latham got another start but the latter wasn’t able to bat deep into the innings. New Zealand struggled considerably to up the ante at the back end of the innings and it took a fabulous 45-ball 64 from Cole McConchie to reduce the margin of defeat, as the chase never really got close, particularly in the last 20 overs of the innings. Pakistan’s spinners were tidy and ensured that the New Zealand batters weren’t given freebies to release the pressure while their pacers were accurate upfront as well as at the death. With the surface slowing down throughout the contest, run-scoring wasn’t as straightforward as it was in Rawalpindi. Pakistan 287/6 in 50 overs (Imam-ul-Haq 90, Babar Azam 54; Matt Henry 3-54) beat New Zealand 261 all out in 49.1 overs (Tom Blundell 65, Cole McConchie 64*; Naseem Shah 2-42) by 26 runs","pubDate":"2023-05-04 23:40:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Борнмут - Челсі: де і коли дивитися онлайн матч 35 туру АПЛ 06.05.2023","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/05/05/928492/bornmut-chelsi-de-dyvytysya-match-apl","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"У матчі 35-го туру АПЛ Челсі Михайла Мудрика на виїзді зіграє з Борнмутом Іллі Забарного.Підключитися до МегогоМатч відбудеться у суботу, 6 травня.

The game got off to an extraordinary start, with Jhon Lucumi scoring an own goal in the opening 36 seconds. Bologna fought back, with two goals disallowed after VAR reviews. The visitors were also plagued by injuries, with Adama Soumaoro limping off the field. Despite being in a training retreat following their third consecutive defeat, Empoli showed determination and resilience. Razvan Marin’s free kick led to Jean-Daniel Akpa Akpro getting a glancing header for their second goal, and Nicolò Cambiaghi scored on the counter-attack for their third. Riccardo Orsolini did score a goal for Bologna from a penalty late in the game, but it was not enough to change the outcome. Empoli’s victory will give them a much-needed boost as they face Salernitana on Monday. Meanwhile, Bologna will need to recover quickly before facing Sassuolo on the same day. The game demonstrated the fine margins that can make all the difference in football, as Bologna were left rueing their bad luck.","pubDate":"2023-05-04 23:26:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"thewillnigeria","category":["sports"],"country":["nigeria"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kun Bokator to Teqball: New SEA Games sports additions","link":"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501285044/kun-bokator-to-teqball-new-sea-games-sports-additions/","keywords":["2023 SEA Games","Sports","Kun Bokator"],"creator":["Pengly Horng"],"video_url":null,"description":"Southeast Asian athletes will vie for dominance in more than 30 sports in Phnom Penh from May 5 to 17, in everything from athletics and football to jet ski and obstacle race, the SEA Games has a flexible program which includes sports in the hosts' favor and also allows for regional and newer disciplines.

Kun Bokator: Believed to date back more than 1,000 years to the armies of the Khmer empire, which spread across much of Southeast Asia, Kun Bokator is perhaps the most quintessentially Cambodian martial art. The graceful style, incorporating elbow blows, shin strikes, locks and grapples, makes its SEA Games debut just a year after being inscribed on Unesco’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and so finds itself in rude health only decades after nearly being erased. It barely survived the Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s, but Kun Bokator has since won new followers among Cambodians keen to preserve their culture — Unesco called it “an embodiment of Cambodia’s social, cultural and religious values.” Cambodia will have an obvious advantage in Kun Bokator. Teqball: In contrast to the ancient, locally rooted Kun Bokator, Teqball was invented as recently as 2012, in Hungary, played on a specially curved table, it is a mash-up of football and table tennis, requiring agility, stamina and acrobatic overhead kicks. Top international football teams including Spain and Portugal bond over games of Teqball during downtime at training, and legends such as Ronaldinho have become ambassadors for the game. It will be a demonstration sport at the SEA Games, as it seeks medal recognition at other sports events around the world.

In case you haven’t been paying attention, Sam Allardyce is the Leeds manager now, and his first game in charge comes at the Etihad. Allardyce might well believe that if his surname were Allardici , he would be in the Manchester City dugout instead, but fate is yet to intervene on that front. Instead the former one-game England manager has only four matches to save Leeds from dropping into the Championship. Usually, you would like to set the bar in the opening match after riling up your new charges. Against Manchester City, however, Allardyce faces a tough decision: whether to set a style for the remainder of the season or desperately hope to earn a surprising point against the champions by sticking 11 men behind the ball. After two years away from management, Allardyce will be eager to pit his wits against Pep Guardiola but he might need to accept damage limitation to build on for the final push.

Julen Lopetegui held his hands up for Wolves’s performance at the Amex Stadium – his team trailed 6-0 inside 66 minutes – but there is an argument to say that profuse apologies should probably suffice. Tottenham’s players acknowledged their poor showing at St James’ Park by refunding more than 3,000 fans the cost of their tickets, about £80,000 in total. Supporters are not held to ransom – well, they are in many ways – but it is the fans’ choice to follow their team up and down the country. Either way, Wolves are unlikely to get the benefit of the doubt if they put in another abject display at home to Aston Villa this weekend. Ben Fisher Wolves v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm 4) Spurs must end first-half horror shows “How shit must you be, it’s only 2-0,” sang the travelling Tottenham support at Anfield last Sunday. Perhaps Liverpool were slighted because they quickly made it 3-0 in the 15th minute, seemingly ending the contest. Spurs fought back, equalising in stoppage-time before throwing it away at the end, but their dreadful start confirmed the re-emergence of a theme of their season. Previously, they had trailed 2-0 and 5-0 at half-time to Manchester United and Newcastle United respectively and, although they salvaged a point against the former, they have regularly played with fire by running on auto-pilot in the first half of matches, sometimes crashing. In their last 33 games in all competitions, Spurs have scored 12 first-half goals, which have been good for an interval lead on five occasions. Thirteen times during the sequence, they have been behind at the break. David Hytner Tottenham v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm 5) Dyche needs to use bench options Sean Dyche is not a man for dynamic substitutions. At Burnley, his changes were generally pretty choreographed – they would see the two strikers changed between 60 and 70 minutes and a fresh winger sent on before the final whistle. At Everton the idea is to keep the starting XI on the pitch for the full match if they are not losing. In the draw against Leicester the only change came before half-time because of an injury to Séamus Coleman. At Crystal Palace, Mason Holgate’s red card in the 81st minute forced Dyche’s hand, before Neal Maupay was brought on in injury time. Amadou Onana and Demarai Gray were unused at the King Power Stadium, where a win would have taken Everton out of the relegation zone. Dyche has a decent squad at his disposal and needs to rethink how he uses it to get them out of trouble.

It was clear that they needed an alternative to Aaron Cresswell at left-back last summer. David Moyes went for Emerson Palmieri, but the former Chelsea defender has not shown that he can play in a back four. Emerson was given a chasing by Crystal Palace last week and looks more comfortable as a wing-back. Yet West Ham lack attacking impetus when they switch to a back three. Moyes has a lot of attackers capable of playing on the left wing, but few have produced this season. Pablo Fornals has struggled, while four of Saïd Benrahma’s five goals have been penalties. It is not enough given that the Algerian has started 20 games, but Moyes has not managed to replace him. A lot of money was wasted on Nikola Vlasic – the Croatian is now on loan at Torino – and Maxwel Cornet has barely featured since recovering from a long-term injury. Cornet came on in the 89th minute at Palace and was an unused substitute against Manchester City on Wednesday. He surely deserves more minutes against Manchester United.

Jürgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah have already shown the way. The pair sat down to discuss penalty-taking duties after Salah had missed his second in succession during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on 9 April, the last time Liverpool failed to win a game. Cool heads prevailed and Salah has converted two penalties in the past week, helping Liverpool establish their best winning streak of the campaign and moving to 29 goals for the season in all competitions. One more will take him to the 30-goal mark for the fourth time in seven seasons at Anfield. “We had a conversation and he wanted to stay the penalty-taker,” Klopp revealed. “I said: ‘OK, you are.’ He didn’t feel great in that moment because the pressure increases with the penalties you miss. He could have given the ball to Fab or Trent, but he smashed them and turned it around. He enjoys these situations.” Andy Hunter Liverpool v Brentford, Saturday 5.30pm Mohamed Salah smashes in a penalty against Fulham at Anfield. Photograph: Jon Super/AP 8) Yates could step in with Danilo out It does not get much bigger than this for Nottingham Forest. With the calamity around them in the battle for survival, a single victory could be enough to save them. The roof was lifted off the City Ground by beating Brighton in their most recent home game and considering their sole away victory this season came against Southampton, Steve Cooper will be targeting another three points. Like most weeks, Forest have an injury to contend with: Danilo will miss the next two matches after suffering a muscle problem at Brentford. The 22-year-old has been one of the more promising acquisitions from a chaotic January and was starting to settle in midfield. Ryan Yates looks to be the likely candidate rather than Cheikhou Kouyaté, Remo Freuler or the unpopular Jonjo Shelvey. The homegrown midfielder’s return to the starting lineup would provide an added boost to the Forest faithful for a crucial 90 minutes. WU Nottingham Forest v Southampton, Monday 8pm 9) Lampard to give youth a chance? The main thing to look out for is whether Chelsea lose again. Frank Lampard’s record at Chelsea reads: six matches, six defeats. Within those fixtures, they have looked like relegation candidates with their lack of desire, inability to create chances and dreadful defending. What can poor old Frank do to change things? Resigning would be the most sensible idea, but he is no quitter. His brief success during a first Chelsea managerial spell was down to bringing through young players because of a transfer embargo and, after watching six pitiful losses this time, he might as well do likewise. Noni Madueke was one bright spot at Arsenal in his first start under Lampard. Carney Chukwuemeka, Lewis Hall and Omari Hutchinson have all shown promise this season but cannot make a match-day squad, leaving it up to the tried and tested players to fail. There is nothing to lose for Lampard now – he might as well help his replacement out. WU Bournemouth v Chelsea , Saturday 3pm 01:33 'We were nice to play against': Lampard and Arteta on Arsenal's easy 3-1 victory – video 10) Time for the Foxes to bare teeth It is not Dean Smith’s fault that Jonny Evans has been injured for much of the season and Wesley Fofana was so determined to join Chelsea last summer. Still, Smith has no time for excuses as he battles to keep Leicester up. The main focus for the manager must be on getting more from the centre-backs at his disposal. Clean sheets are precious in a relegation battle and the worry for Smith is that Leicester remain too open. They have shipped seven goals in his first four games and were lucky to concede only twice in Monday’s draw with Everton. Daniel Iversen had to make too many saves and it must have worried Smith to see his defence struggle to deal with Everton’s physical approach. Admittedly they will face a different test at Fulham, who cannot be as direct without the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic leading the line, but Leicester have to be harder to beat, starting in central defence.

Some teams have 10 games left, others have 11, or 12. Brighton even have 13. The international break has provided the perfect moment to reset. It’s also provided the opportunity for predictions and to consider, just for a second, the boldest things that could happen before we see the trophy lifted aloft. I apologise to anybody who believes in football jinxes for writing the above. Even thinking it could make a lot of Arsenal supporters nervous. The big goal is to win the Premier League, obviously. But with the way Arsenal are playing… is it out of the realm of possibility to suggest they could do so without losing another game? Mikel Arteta has 10 games left to navigate, with an eight-point lead over Manchester City, who can cut it to five if they win their game in hand. As harsh as it may sound, anything other than a title win now would be a huge disappointment for a brilliant young squad who have played the most thrilling and cutting football in the division this season. You’d expect Arsenal to walk through home fixtures against Leeds, Southampton and Wolves. You’d also expect them to top Brighton and Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. Away trips to West Ham and Nottingham Forest? They’re huge favourites. The big three tests that remain are journeys to Newcastle, Manchester City and Liverpool. This Arsenal team are resilient. They work harder than we’ve seen any Arsenal side do in recent years, digging in when matches are tough to get a result. Arteta has built a togetherness and understanding that means even if an important player is missing, Arsenal still manage to largely play the same way. It’s a bold prediction, but Arsenal getting the job done in the dullest way possible by not suffering defeat feels like the climax their season deserves. Liverpool’s exit from the Champions League actually frees them up to concentrate on the most important aspect of their season: qualifying for next season’s Champions League. Yes, Reds fans would have wanted to remain in Europe’s elite competition, but after a terrible season, the outside shot Jurgen Klopp’s side have at finishing in the top four is the most vital thing to latch on to. Liverpool’s results continue to be all over the place. After the 7-0 destruction of Manchester United, you’d have put your house on them to push on and clinch fourth. They followed this with defeat to Bournemouth, though, then a second loss in as many matches to Real Madrid. Klopp faces a defining run to the end of the campaign with his team in sixth, seven points behind Spurs, who have played two games more and will be expecting a new lease of life now that Antonio Conte has gone. Newcastle could prove to be the real danger, though, and currently sit five points ahead of Liverpool on equal games played. The biggest hurdle is immediately on the horizon. In the next three games, Liverpool face Man City and Chelsea away before inviting league-leaders Arsenal to Anfield. Spurs travel to Merseyside on April 30th for a match that is likely to highlight or scribble out whether or not this prediction is still on. Perhaps it’s just the club’s incredible consistency and competitiveness in recent years, or perhaps it’s naivety. I just expect leadership figures like Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk and Andrew Robertson to drag this club through to the end. Liverpool look great when things click. They are thrust forwards with the exuberance of Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nuñez, two players who will elevate the team’s overall output if they can find consistency. It’s still an experienced squad, one that is used to achieving great things, hunting down teams that do not have that level of experience. It’s going to be tight, but it’s not over yet for the Reds. Erling Haaland to Score 40 Goals Honestly, you could probably make this section “Erling Haaland to Score 50 Goals” and you’d still have people arguing it’s not that bold. The Man City striker has 28 goals with 27 games played, meaning he needs a measly 12 in the remaining 11. It’s ridiculous this even seems possible. At this point, the difficulty of City’s fixtures don’t really seem to matter for Haaland. He is a constant threat against anyone when his teammates open up their passing range and look for his runs, rather than constantly recycling for the perfect opportunity. City need to maintain pace with Arsenal for this to come to fruition. If the Gunners wrap things up early and City are still in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola’s attention is likely to turn to winning the trophy that still eludes him away from Barcelona. Haaland’s game time may suffer as a result. Haaland faces Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on April 26th. Should City come through that within touching distance, the Norwegian phenom should be in place to become the first man in history to hit 40 Premier League goals in one season. The fact it just seems inevitable he will break the current record of 34 is hilarious and an indictment of a man whose stunning debut season won’t be topped for a long, long time. West Ham to Escape Relegation on Goal Difference After meticulously going through each of the relegation candidates’ remaining fixtures, I have come up with a bold prediction that feels like it would win you a tidy sum if you bet on it right now: West Ham to remain in the Premier League by goal difference, the finest of margins. My extremely scientific method of “doing predictions on gut feeling” has Southampton accumulating seven more points, leaving them bottom on 30 points. I predict Bournemouth and West Ham will get nine more points each, moving them both to 33. The magic ball also says Leicester City will pull themselves clear with 15 more points, while Nottingham Forest only get seven more, putting them on the same total as Bournemouth and the Hammers. This is where it gets dramatic. West Ham may currently reside below Forest, but they are 17 goals clear on minus 10. While I don’t expect them to do well by any means, Forest are in trouble of doing slightly worse, putting them down to the Championship in the process. Points to be equal, but GD to be heavily lopsided in favour of David Moyes’ men, leaving them clutching onto their place in the top flight.
