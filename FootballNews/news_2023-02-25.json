Arsenal forward Mead , 27, is currently on the sidelines after suffering a ruptured ACL in a WSL game at home to Man Utd back in November, although she did also state that her rehabilitation was progressing \"ahead of schedule.\" As a result, she missed the most-recent international break, which saw England retain the Arnold Clark Cup after three wins over South Korea, Italy and Belgium, with the Lionesses extending their unbeaten run under manager Sarina Wiegman. Mead is motivated to return for the 2023 World Cup finals, with the Lionesses' opening game on July 22, but revealed that the excellent form of other players in her position will give her an extra push to return an even better player. Speaking to Mirror Football as a McDonald's Fun Football ambassador, the England star added that the teams' recent form highlights the incredible depth within the squad. England stars hail \"unsung hero\" who has helped make Lionesses back four untouchable Lionesses lift another trophy as Chloe Kelly claims Golden Boot - 5 talking points \"We're (England) in an amazing place,\" said Mead. \"Sarina has done an amazing job both on and off the pitch, in terms of culture. Credit to the girls, they played some really great football over the last three games. \"It is amazing the depth we do have in the squad. When we're missing players who started during the Euros, the girls are still putting in great performances. That competitiveness and healthy competition for places I think is what drives us to be better than the rest. \"I've got to kickstart myself going again when I get back. In my position you have Chloe Kelly who is on fire , Lauren James is on fire and Lauren Hemp is unbelievable. They are pushing me to become better as well and I'd like to think I did that with them, with how I played during the Euros. Beth Mead was hosting a Fun Football session with a focus on encouraging kids to read ahead of World Book Day on March 2 \"We're all making each other better. But I think I'm the OAP in those wide forward areas!\" Mead has endured an extremely difficult few months in her personal life with the sad passing of mother June from ovarian cancer. On a professional level she is having to battle back from an injury that can be potentially career-threatening. But despite suffering a huge injury, she remains positive and isn't yet ruling out a return to fitness for the World Cup in the summer. \"I'm progressing really well three months in, but this injury is a slow burner,\" Mead explained. \"You've got to hit different goals at different stages. First it is running, then changing direction, then getting involved with the ball for example. Sarina Wiegman's three England selection dilemmas ahead of Arnold Clark Cup decider Sarina Wiegman warns Lauren James can still improve ahead of Women's World Cup \"There are a lot of ups and downs that come through this injury, but at the moment I am ahead of schedule which is really nice. \"I'll just try and continue to be positive, but I'm taking one step at a time. My motivation is the World Cup but if it is not meant to be, it is not meant to be. \"Sarina is amazing at making you feel a valued member of the team regardless if you are there or not. She has rang me, text me and kept up to date. She is always asking if there is anything they can do. \"At some point we'll sit down and have a conversation at some point and see which direction things are going to go in.\" Arsenal's Vivianne Miedema gives scathing verdict on Saudi Women's World Cup sponsorship France captain Wendie Renard withdraws from 2023 World Cup to \"preserve mental health\" In a cruel twist, Mead's partner and teammate Viv Miedema also suffered an ACL injury at the Emirates less than a month after she was sidelined. And the England forward said although it wasn't an ideal situation, both were keeping spirits high and had a new found appreciation for playing the game. \"I managed to get about three weeks of sympathy before she ( Miedema ) did the same,\" joked Mead. \"So that wasn't ideal. A couple of the girls have been great and came round to babysit us when we were both on crutches. \"I ended up being the more mobile one very quickly. It is difficult, on one side you both understand what the other person is going through, but on the other we've not got that football fix to break away from. \"We'd both be doing anything to be back on the pitch with the girls, helping the team and doing all we can. I think it has given us a new found appreciation of enjoying football while we're there. So we're doing ok.\" Lionesses lift another trophy as Chloe Kelly claims Golden Boot - 5 talking points Gabby George opens up on Everton form, England snub and cousin Jesse Lingard's advice Mead was speaking after hosting a Fun Football session, a McDonalds programme which aims to inspire children to take part in grassroots football and enjoy an active lifestyle, with an additional aim of encouraging kids to read ahead of World Book Day next week. And she is optimistic that grassroots participation for girls in particular will continue to grow in the coming years. \"We want to inspire kids both on and off the pitch,\" Mead added. \"My mum took me to my first (football) session which was a boys session. I loved every minute, but that was the only thing that was available at the time. \"This Fun Football programme is for both girls and boys of any ages and to have things like this available, you can understand why we have more amazing footballers than ever before coming through the youth system. \"Doing what we did in the Euros has helped bring new people to the game and we want to keep that increase and not let it drop off. Hopefully that means we can take the women's game to new heights over the next few years.\"","pubDate":"2023-02-25 12:03:19","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29310866.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_England-Women-Training-Session-Press-Conference.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man Utd takeover: US hedge fund make eye-catching £2bn Old Trafford promise","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manutd-takeover-elliott-old-trafford-29310800","keywords":["Football"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Felix Keith)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Elliott Investment Management, who used to own AC Milan, have marked themselves out from the competition by including a pledge about Old Trafford in their bid to buy Manchester United","content":"Elliott Investment Management are willing to fund a £2billion redevelopment of Old Trafford – even if they are unsuccessful in buying Manchester United from the Glazers. The American hedge fund is one of the three bidders to have been made public since the passing of the Glazers’ soft deadline last Friday. They are up against INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani . Elliott manages assets worth a whopping $56billion (£46bn) and has previous involvement in football, having owned AC Milan between July 2018 and June 2022. There has been little detail revealed on the hedge fund’s offer since their bid was reported last week. Gary Neville warns fans to \"ignore Premier League spin\" as government plans unveiled Debunking Man Utd fans' arguments in favour of Qatar ownership after Sheikh Jassim bid The Daily Mail now says the bid, which was submitted to Raine Group last week, contains a few different proposals. While they are interested in a full buy-out of the Glazers, Elliott has also offered to finance a redevelopment of Old Trafford if they choose to sell to a different party, or retain control themselves. Architects Populous, who designed the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, have already submitted plans to United which range from a £1bn redevelopment of the current structure, or a £2bn complete new-build stadium. Previous reports have suggested that, unlike both Ratcliffe and the Qatari bids, Elliott would be open to the Glazers retaining control of United. The Glazers’ original statement in November said they would “consider all strategic alternatives, including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions”. Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management ( Image: Bloomberg via Getty Images) HAVE YOUR SAY! What do you make of Elliott Management's plans? Comment below . That means they could sell a portion of the club to Elliott Management, or use the hedge fund’s money to finance a redevelopment of Old Trafford, rather than sell the entirety of the club. The Glazers are understood to be seeking between £5bn and £6bn for United – a huge amount. NFL franchise Denver Broncos were sold for $4.65bn (£3.89bn) in August – the most ever paid for a club at present. Raine oversaw the sale of Chelsea to a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly in May last year, but the headline £4.25bn figure was made up of a fee of £2.5bn and included a commitment of £1.75bn to Stamford Bridge, the women’s team and the club’s charitable foundation. Man Utd share price plummets amid fears Glazers are making U-turn on takeover Man Utd takeover: Joel Glazer concerns confirm Gary Neville's biggest fears about sale In the statement about the sale, the Glazers said: “This will include an assessment of several initiatives to strengthen the club, including stadium and infrastructure redevelopment, and expansion of the club’s commercial operations on a global scale, each in the context of enhancing the long-term success of the club’s men’s, women’s and academy teams, and bringing benefits to fans and other stakeholders.” That statement appears to align with Elliott Management’s offer. The hedge fund took control of AC Milan in 2018 after the Italian club’s owner Li Yonghong defaulted on a debt. They sold the club to RedBird Capital last summer for €1.2bn (£1bn).

The Portuguese playmaker signed for the Gunners last summer in a £34m move from Porto as Arteta attempted to bolster his midfield options. The 22-year-old has seen his game time limited since then though. Of the 23 appearances he has made for the current Premier League leaders, just 10 have been starts, whilst Vieira was last named in the starting XI for a league match back in November in a 2-0 victory over Wolves. Brendan Rodgers sends Arsenal title warning as he recalls Liverpool near miss Mikel Arteta talks sacrificing Europa League amid Arsenal's Premier League title charge Amid somewhat of an injury crisis this season - Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny both being struck down with problems - Vieira was anticipated to receive more game time. That has not quite materialised with Arsenal instead electing to sign Jorginho from Chelsea . Arteta remains convinced by Vieira though and has admitted that attempting to find him more game time has been a tricky problem to solve. Asked how close he was to starting ahead of Saturday’s clash with Leicester , the Spaniard replied: “Very close. He is starting to give me big headaches because I see every single day what he is capable of doing. A tremendous player. “He now understands exactly what we want and physically he is a condition to compete at the right level in this league. He brings qualities that we don’t have in the squad. Very eager to give him more [game time].” Fabio Vieira has started just ten games for Arsenal since his £34m move ( Image: Getty Images) What side do you think Mikel Arteta should select vs Leicester? Share your thoughts in the comments below Whilst Vieira has yet to show Gunners supporters exactly what he can offer, Arteta is under no illusions that the 22-year-old’s attacking instincts could prove particularly handy. The midfielder has two goals and five assists to his name in all competitions despite his limited game time so far. “If he needs to compete for 30 balls in the air against certain players in this league, I think he is going to lose 28,” Arteta added. “But if we give him the ball in the right spaces, and if we ask him to do some defensive work he can do… “If we put him in front of goal the amount of times that we want to do, I think he will do really well in this league. But if we do the opposite I don’t think he is going to do well.” Mikel Arteta tells Bukayo Saka to protect himself as referees leave Arsenal ace in peril Arsenal and Man City punished by FA over disorder in heated Premier League clash Vieira enjoyed what was a standout season ahead of his switch to the Emirates from Porto. His seven goals and 16 assists in all competitions helped his former side to the Portuguese title last term. It remains to be seen if Vieira is handed a start against Leicester or Arteta remains with the midfield trio that he fielded in the win over Aston Villa . Granit Xhaka started alongside captain Martin Odegaard and Jorginho. The Italian was the only one to end the game and played a key role as his thunderous shot found the net via Emi Martinez.

The Blues have won just two of their past 15 games in all competitions. They sit 10th in the Premier League table, 11 points adrift of the top four, ahead of their crucial clash with Tottenham on Sunday afternoon. Potter has been under mounting pressure , with his side booed off the pitch by their own fans following a dire 1-0 defeat by bottom side Southampton last weekend.

We’re going through an energy crisis, a cost of living crisis, and people are striking every other week. Things are difficult so nobody wants to hear about the poor old Premier League manager,” he said. \"Nevertheless, when you ask me questions: ‘Is it hard? Is it tough? Is it nice to hear?', as much as I’ve had support, I’ve had some not particularly nice emails come through that want me to die, want my kids to die.

Arsenal forward Mead , 27, is currently on the sidelines after suffering a ruptured ACL in a WSL game at home to Man Utd back in November, although she did also state that her rehabilitation was progressing \"ahead of schedule.\" As a result, she missed the most-recent international break, which saw England retain the Arnold Clark Cup after three wins over South Korea, Italy and Belgium, with the Lionesses extending their unbeaten run under manager Sarina Wiegman. Mead is motivated to return for the 2023 World Cup finals, with the Lionesses' opening game on July 22, but revealed that the excellent form of other players in her position will give her an extra push to return an even better player. Speaking to Mirror Football as a McDonald's Fun Football ambassador, the England star added that the teams' recent form highlights the incredible depth within the squad. England stars hail \"unsung hero\" who has helped make Lionesses back four untouchable Lionesses lift another trophy as Chloe Kelly claims Golden Boot - 5 talking points \"We're (England) in an amazing place,\" said Mead. \"Sarina has done an amazing job both on and off the pitch, in terms of culture. Credit to the girls, they played some really great football over the last three games. \"It is amazing the depth we do have in the squad. When we're missing players who started during the Euros, the girls are still putting in great performances. That competitiveness and healthy competition for places I think is what drives us to be better than the rest. \"I've got to kickstart myself going again when I get back. In my position you have Chloe Kelly who is on fire , Lauren James is on fire and Lauren Hemp is unbelievable. They are pushing me to become better as well and I'd like to think I did that with them, with how I played during the Euros. Beth Mead was hosting a Fun Football session with a focus on encouraging kids to read ahead of World Book Day on March 2 \"We're all making each other better. But I think I'm the OAP in those wide forward areas!\" Mead has endured an extremely difficult few months in her personal life with the sad passing of mother June from ovarian cancer. On a professional level she is having to battle back from an injury that can be potentially career-threatening. But despite suffering a huge injury, she remains positive and isn't yet ruling out a return to fitness for the World Cup in the summer. \"I'm progressing really well three months in, but this injury is a slow burner,\" Mead explained. \"You've got to hit different goals at different stages. First it is running, then changing direction, then getting involved with the ball for example. Sarina Wiegman's three England selection dilemmas ahead of Arnold Clark Cup decider Sarina Wiegman warns Lauren James can still improve ahead of Women's World Cup \"There are a lot of ups and downs that come through this injury, but at the moment I am ahead of schedule which is really nice. \"I'll just try and continue to be positive, but I'm taking one step at a time. My motivation is the World Cup but if it is not meant to be, it is not meant to be. \"Sarina is amazing at making you feel a valued member of the team regardless if you are there or not. She has rang me, text me and kept up to date. She is always asking if there is anything they can do. \"At some point we'll sit down and have a conversation at some point and see which direction things are going to go in.\" Arsenal's Vivianne Miedema gives scathing verdict on Saudi Women's World Cup sponsorship France captain Wendie Renard withdraws from 2023 World Cup to \"preserve mental health\" In a cruel twist, Mead's partner and teammate Viv Miedema also suffered an ACL injury at the Emirates less than a month after she was sidelined. And the England forward said although it wasn't an ideal situation, both were keeping spirits high and had a new found appreciation for playing the game. \"I managed to get about three weeks of sympathy before she ( Miedema ) did the same,\" joked Mead. \"So that wasn't ideal. A couple of the girls have been great and came round to babysit us when we were both on crutches. \"I ended up being the more mobile one very quickly. It is difficult, on one side you both understand what the other person is going through, but on the other we've not got that football fix to break away from. \"We'd both be doing anything to be back on the pitch with the girls, helping the team and doing all we can. I think it has given us a new found appreciation of enjoying football while we're there. So we're doing ok.\" Lionesses lift another trophy as Chloe Kelly claims Golden Boot - 5 talking points Gabby George opens up on Everton form, England snub and cousin Jesse Lingard's advice Mead was speaking after hosting a Fun Football session, a McDonalds programme which aims to inspire children to take part in grassroots football and enjoy an active lifestyle, with an additional aim of encouraging kids to read ahead of World Book Day next week. And she is optimistic that grassroots participation for girls in particular will continue to grow in the coming years. \"We want to inspire kids both on and off the pitch,\" Mead added. \"My mum took me to my first (football) session which was a boys session. I loved every minute, but that was the only thing that was available at the time. \"This Fun Football programme is for both girls and boys of any ages and to have things like this available, you can understand why we have more amazing footballers than ever before coming through the youth system. \"Doing what we did in the Euros has helped bring new people to the game and we want to keep that increase and not let it drop off.

The American hedge fund is one of the three bidders to have been made public since the passing of the Glazers’ soft deadline last Friday. They are up against INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani . Elliott manages assets worth a whopping $56billion (£46bn) and has previous involvement in football, having owned AC Milan between July 2018 and June 2022. There has been little detail revealed on the hedge fund’s offer since their bid was reported last week. Gary Neville warns fans to \"ignore Premier League spin\" as government plans unveiled Debunking Man Utd fans' arguments in favour of Qatar ownership after Sheikh Jassim bid The Daily Mail now says the bid, which was submitted to Raine Group last week, contains a few different proposals. While they are interested in a full buy-out of the Glazers, Elliott has also offered to finance a redevelopment of Old Trafford if they choose to sell to a different party, or retain control themselves. Architects Populous, who designed the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, have already submitted plans to United which range from a £1bn redevelopment of the current structure, or a £2bn complete new-build stadium. Previous reports have suggested that, unlike both Ratcliffe and the Qatari bids, Elliott would be open to the Glazers retaining control of United. The Glazers’ original statement in November said they would “consider all strategic alternatives, including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions”. Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management ( Image: Bloomberg via Getty Images) HAVE YOUR SAY! What do you make of Elliott Management's plans? Comment below . That means they could sell a portion of the club to Elliott Management, or use the hedge fund’s money to finance a redevelopment of Old Trafford, rather than sell the entirety of the club. The Glazers are understood to be seeking between £5bn and £6bn for United – a huge amount. NFL franchise Denver Broncos were sold for $4.65bn (£3.89bn) in August – the most ever paid for a club at present. Raine oversaw the sale of Chelsea to a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly in May last year, but the headline £4.25bn figure was made up of a fee of £2.5bn and included a commitment of £1.75bn to Stamford Bridge, the women’s team and the club’s charitable foundation. Man Utd share price plummets amid fears Glazers are making U-turn on takeover Man Utd takeover: Joel Glazer concerns confirm Gary Neville's biggest fears about sale In the statement about the sale, the Glazers said: “This will include an assessment of several initiatives to strengthen the club, including stadium and infrastructure redevelopment, and expansion of the club’s commercial operations on a global scale, each in the context of enhancing the long-term success of the club’s men’s, women’s and academy teams, and bringing benefits to fans and other stakeholders.” That statement appears to align with Elliott Management’s offer. The hedge fund took control of AC Milan in 2018 after the Italian club’s owner Li Yonghong defaulted on a debt. They sold the club to RedBird Capital last summer for €1.2bn (£1bn).

The Portuguese playmaker signed for the Gunners last summer in a £34m move from Porto as Arteta attempted to bolster his midfield options. The 22-year-old has seen his game time limited since then though. Of the 23 appearances he has made for the current Premier League leaders, just 10 have been starts, whilst Vieira was last named in the starting XI for a league match back in November in a 2-0 victory over Wolves.

That has not quite materialised with Arsenal instead electing to sign Jorginho from Chelsea . Arteta remains convinced by Vieira though and has admitted that attempting to find him more game time has been a tricky problem to solve. Asked how close he was to starting ahead of Saturday’s clash with Leicester , the Spaniard replied: “Very close. He is starting to give me big headaches because I see every single day what he is capable of doing. A tremendous player. “He now understands exactly what we want and physically he is a condition to compete at the right level in this league. He brings qualities that we don’t have in the squad.

Share your thoughts in the comments below Whilst Vieira has yet to show Gunners supporters exactly what he can offer, Arteta is under no illusions that the 22-year-old’s attacking instincts could prove particularly handy. The midfielder has two goals and five assists to his name in all competitions despite his limited game time so far. “If he needs to compete for 30 balls in the air against certain players in this league, I think he is going to lose 28,” Arteta added. “But if we give him the ball in the right spaces, and if we ask him to do some defensive work he can do… “If we put him in front of goal the amount of times that we want to do, I think he will do really well in this league.

His seven goals and 16 assists in all competitions helped his former side to the Portuguese title last term. It remains to be seen if Vieira is handed a start against Leicester or Arteta remains with the midfield trio that he fielded in the win over Aston Villa . Granit Xhaka started alongside captain Martin Odegaard and Jorginho. The Italian was the only one to end the game and played a key role as his thunderous shot found the net via Emi Martinez.

The Blues have won just two of their past 15 games in all competitions. They sit 10th in the Premier League table, 11 points adrift of the top four, ahead of their crucial clash with Tottenham on Sunday afternoon.

We’re going through an energy crisis, a cost of living crisis, and people are striking every other week. Things are difficult so nobody wants to hear about the poor old Premier League manager,” he said. \"Nevertheless, when you ask me questions: ‘Is it hard? Is it tough? Is it nice to hear?', as much as I’ve had support, I’ve had some not particularly nice emails come through that want me to die, want my kids to die.

Arsenal forward Mead , 27, is currently on the sidelines after suffering a ruptured ACL in a WSL game at home to Man Utd back in November, although she did also state that her rehabilitation was progressing \"ahead of schedule.\" As a result, she missed the most-recent international break, which saw England retain the Arnold Clark Cup after three wins over South Korea, Italy and Belgium, with the Lionesses extending their unbeaten run under manager Sarina Wiegman. Mead is motivated to return for the 2023 World Cup finals, with the Lionesses' opening game on July 22, but revealed that the excellent form of other players in her position will give her an extra push to return an even better player. Speaking to Mirror Football as a McDonald's Fun Football ambassador, the England star added that the teams' recent form highlights the incredible depth within the squad. England stars hail \"unsung hero\" who has helped make Lionesses back four untouchable Lionesses lift another trophy as Chloe Kelly claims Golden Boot - 5 talking points \"We're (England) in an amazing place,\" said Mead. \"Sarina has done an amazing job both on and off the pitch, in terms of culture. Credit to the girls, they played some really great football over the last three games. \"It is amazing the depth we do have in the squad. When we're missing players who started during the Euros, the girls are still putting in great performances. That competitiveness and healthy competition for places I think is what drives us to be better than the rest. \"I've got to kickstart myself going again when I get back. In my position you have Chloe Kelly who is on fire , Lauren James is on fire and Lauren Hemp is unbelievable. They are pushing me to become better as well and I'd like to think I did that with them, with how I played during the Euros. Beth Mead was hosting a Fun Football session with a focus on encouraging kids to read ahead of World Book Day on March 2 \"We're all making each other better. But I think I'm the OAP in those wide forward areas!\" Mead has endured an extremely difficult few months in her personal life with the sad passing of mother June from ovarian cancer. On a professional level she is having to battle back from an injury that can be potentially career-threatening. But despite suffering a huge injury, she remains positive and isn't yet ruling out a return to fitness for the World Cup in the summer. \"I'm progressing really well three months in, but this injury is a slow burner,\" Mead explained. \"You've got to hit different goals at different stages. First it is running, then changing direction, then getting involved with the ball for example. Sarina Wiegman's three England selection dilemmas ahead of Arnold Clark Cup decider Sarina Wiegman warns Lauren James can still improve ahead of Women's World Cup \"There are a lot of ups and downs that come through this injury, but at the moment I am ahead of schedule which is really nice. \"I'll just try and continue to be positive, but I'm taking one step at a time. My motivation is the World Cup but if it is not meant to be, it is not meant to be. \"Sarina is amazing at making you feel a valued member of the team regardless if you are there or not. She has rang me, text me and kept up to date. She is always asking if there is anything they can do. \"At some point we'll sit down and have a conversation at some point and see which direction things are going to go in.\" Arsenal's Vivianne Miedema gives scathing verdict on Saudi Women's World Cup sponsorship France captain Wendie Renard withdraws from 2023 World Cup to \"preserve mental health\" In a cruel twist, Mead's partner and teammate Viv Miedema also suffered an ACL injury at the Emirates less than a month after she was sidelined. And the England forward said although it wasn't an ideal situation, both were keeping spirits high and had a new found appreciation for playing the game. \"I managed to get about three weeks of sympathy before she ( Miedema ) did the same,\" joked Mead. \"So that wasn't ideal. A couple of the girls have been great and came round to babysit us when we were both on crutches. \"I ended up being the more mobile one very quickly. It is difficult, on one side you both understand what the other person is going through, but on the other we've not got that football fix to break away from. \"We'd both be doing anything to be back on the pitch with the girls, helping the team and doing all we can. I think it has given us a new found appreciation of enjoying football while we're there. So we're doing ok.\" Lionesses lift another trophy as Chloe Kelly claims Golden Boot - 5 talking points Gabby George opens up on Everton form, England snub and cousin Jesse Lingard's advice Mead was speaking after hosting a Fun Football session, a McDonalds programme which aims to inspire children to take part in grassroots football and enjoy an active lifestyle, with an additional aim of encouraging kids to read ahead of World Book Day next week. And she is optimistic that grassroots participation for girls in particular will continue to grow in the coming years. \"We want to inspire kids both on and off the pitch,\" Mead added. \"My mum took me to my first (football) session which was a boys session. I loved every minute, but that was the only thing that was available at the time. \"This Fun Football programme is for both girls and boys of any ages and to have things like this available, you can understand why we have more amazing footballers than ever before coming through the youth system. \"Doing what we did in the Euros has helped bring new people to the game and we want to keep that increase and not let it drop off.

The American hedge fund is one of the three bidders to have been made public since the passing of the Glazers’ soft deadline last Friday. They are up against INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani . Elliott manages assets worth a whopping $56billion (£46bn) and has previous involvement in football, having owned AC Milan between July 2018 and June 2022. There has been little detail revealed on the hedge fund’s offer since their bid was reported last week. Gary Neville warns fans to \"ignore Premier League spin\" as government plans unveiled Debunking Man Utd fans' arguments in favour of Qatar ownership after Sheikh Jassim bid The Daily Mail now says the bid, which was submitted to Raine Group last week, contains a few different proposals. While they are interested in a full buy-out of the Glazers, Elliott has also offered to finance a redevelopment of Old Trafford if they choose to sell to a different party, or retain control themselves. Architects Populous, who designed the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, have already submitted plans to United which range from a £1bn redevelopment of the current structure, or a £2bn complete new-build stadium. Previous reports have suggested that, unlike both Ratcliffe and the Qatari bids, Elliott would be open to the Glazers retaining control of United. The Glazers’ original statement in November said they would “consider all strategic alternatives, including new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions”. Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management ( Image: Bloomberg via Getty Images) HAVE YOUR SAY! What do you make of Elliott Management's plans? Comment below . That means they could sell a portion of the club to Elliott Management, or use the hedge fund’s money to finance a redevelopment of Old Trafford, rather than sell the entirety of the club. The Glazers are understood to be seeking between £5bn and £6bn for United – a huge amount. NFL franchise Denver Broncos were sold for $4.65bn (£3.89bn) in August – the most ever paid for a club at present. Raine oversaw the sale of Chelsea to a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly in May last year, but the headline £4.25bn figure was made up of a fee of £2.5bn and included a commitment of £1.75bn to Stamford Bridge, the women’s team and the club’s charitable foundation. Man Utd share price plummets amid fears Glazers are making U-turn on takeover Man Utd takeover: Joel Glazer concerns confirm Gary Neville's biggest fears about sale In the statement about the sale, the Glazers said: “This will include an assessment of several initiatives to strengthen the club, including stadium and infrastructure redevelopment, and expansion of the club’s commercial operations on a global scale, each in the context of enhancing the long-term success of the club’s men’s, women’s and academy teams, and bringing benefits to fans and other stakeholders.” That statement appears to align with Elliott Management’s offer. The hedge fund took control of AC Milan in 2018 after the Italian club’s owner Li Yonghong defaulted on a debt. They sold the club to RedBird Capital last summer for €1.2bn (£1bn).

The Portuguese playmaker signed for the Gunners last summer in a £34m move from Porto as Arteta attempted to bolster his midfield options. The 22-year-old has seen his game time limited since then though. Of the 23 appearances he has made for the current Premier League leaders, just 10 have been starts, whilst Vieira was last named in the starting XI for a league match back in November in a 2-0 victory over Wolves.

That has not quite materialised with Arsenal instead electing to sign Jorginho from Chelsea . Arteta remains convinced by Vieira though and has admitted that attempting to find him more game time has been a tricky problem to solve. Asked how close he was to starting ahead of Saturday’s clash with Leicester , the Spaniard replied: “Very close. He is starting to give me big headaches because I see every single day what he is capable of doing. A tremendous player. “He now understands exactly what we want and physically he is a condition to compete at the right level in this league. He brings qualities that we don’t have in the squad.

Share your thoughts in the comments below Whilst Vieira has yet to show Gunners supporters exactly what he can offer, Arteta is under no illusions that the 22-year-old’s attacking instincts could prove particularly handy. The midfielder has two goals and five assists to his name in all competitions despite his limited game time so far. “If he needs to compete for 30 balls in the air against certain players in this league, I think he is going to lose 28,” Arteta added. “But if we give him the ball in the right spaces, and if we ask him to do some defensive work he can do… “If we put him in front of goal the amount of times that we want to do, I think he will do really well in this league. But if we do the opposite I don’t think he is going to do well.” Mikel Arteta tells Bukayo Saka to protect himself as referees leave Arsenal ace in peril Arsenal and Man City punished by FA over disorder in heated Premier League clash Vieira enjoyed what was a standout season ahead of his switch to the Emirates from Porto. His seven goals and 16 assists in all competitions helped his former side to the Portuguese title last term. It remains to be seen if Vieira is handed a start against Leicester or Arteta remains with the midfield trio that he fielded in the win over Aston Villa . Granit Xhaka started alongside captain Martin Odegaard and Jorginho. The Italian was the only one to end the game and played a key role as his thunderous shot found the net via Emi Martinez.

Sunday’s trip to north London to play Tottenham could be a crucial one for Potter, who also has the second leg of Chelsea’s Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Dortmund on the horizon on March 7. Chelsea lost 1-0 at home to Southampton last time out ( Image: Stephanie Meek - CameraSport via Getty Images) Potter remains convinced of his own ability – but the constant external noise has become wearing. \"It's a challenge,\" he said. \"If you go to work and somebody is swearing abuse at you, it’s not going to be pleasant – or if you’re referred to as the worst person in the history of the club. You can say, ‘oh I don’t care’ but you know I’m lying because everyone does care what people think because we are hard-wired to be socially connected. “I want to succeed here. It's nonsense the notion I don’t care. People have a perception that I don’t care and my response is what is that based on? How do you know? I would ask you to ask my family how life has been for me and for them. It has not been pleasant at all.\" FREE £2 shop bet in WIlliam Hill shops with Saturday's Daily Mirror , valid on the Manchester United v Newcastle game.

It doesn't get any easier this week as the come up against a familiar foe in Sundowns, who are looking to make it three straight wins in the group. The Brazilians did the double over Al Ahly in the group stages last season, but Koller feels home turf will be key on the night. \"We have a difficult match ahead of us tomorrow against a strong team, which is Sundowns of South Africa,\" Koller said, as per the club's official website. \"We have the advantage that the match is at home and we seek to win.\" Koller did add that experience in these sort of matches doesn't always guarantee victory on the day. \"Sundowns has played two matches in the group league so far, and has great experience through its previous participation in the African Champions League, and the club has maintained the basic strength of the team for some time,\" he added. “The element of experience may make a difference in the events of the matches, but it does not always favor the team.\" You must be to read and post comments.","pubDate":"2023-02-25 10:44:06","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/kickoff24.png","source_id":"snl24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Snl24.com | AL AHLY vs SUNDOWNS: Downs target 15 in a row","link":"https://www.snl24.com/KickOff/SANews/CAF-Champions-League/al-ahly-vs-sundowns-downs-target-15-in-a-row-20230225","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rulani Mokwena believes they have done enough of their homework on Al Ahly ahead of the much-anticipated tie against the record CAF Champions League winners.","content":"Sundowns have won 14 in a row and come up against Al Ahly keen to maintain that record and open a gap at the top of Group B which also features Al Hilal who have now won two in a row. The Egyptians will be desperate for all three points after suffering defeat in their opening match away at Al Hilal. \"We have done our homework,\" says Mokwena while looking ahead to the contest at the Al Salam Stadium (21h00). \"I watch and analyse what I can see and prove. \"From a personal perspective not much has changed from last season (about Al Ahly). \"They are still very strong with a goalkeeper like (Mohamed) El Shenawy who still gives good possibilities, assists with build ups and gives good control in the box which is important for a big team. \"They have three options with centre backs. \"The midfield is also quite strong and upfront they have a lot of options as well including Percy Tau and these are very good players who can change the game at any moment. \"I can speak about the players and what I see about what has changed from when Pitso Mosimane was in charge with a front three that was very narrow. \"With (Marcel) Koller there is a double wide with the fullbacks being assisted by the winger to establish the play. \"So, they are a well-coached team with lots of details and we have to work very hard to win the football match. \"We are looking forward to the game against a very good side, very consistent in the league with 12 wins in 16 games and three wins out of the last five. \"Looking at the performances at the Club World Cup they were good including against Real Madrid. \"From a performance perspective we are up against a strong team with a good coach. \"We are trying to do better than we did last season and come out of a group with four good teams so when we sit here and say Al Ahly is well coached with good players it is the same for Sundowns. \"We have to do our best and suffer in moments when we have to suffer and be brave and dominant when we can be in trying to win the match,\" says Mokwena.
