Dybala has become an incredibly attractive option for clubs to sign in the January transfer window as his bargain £11million release clause in his contract became active. The clause can’t be triggered by clubs in Serie A, but does expire on Januar 15. The 30-year-old’s future hangs in the balance as foreign clubs could pull off a bargain move for the versatile forward who has registered 11 goal involvements in 13 Serie A games so far this season. Dybala’s current contract expires in 18 months and as of yet, Roma haven’t offered him a new deal. According to Italian outlet Corriere Della Sera, Newcastle are the most interested party in triggering his cut-price release clause. However, it’s said the Magpies are restricted by FFP this month and will likely have to sell before they can buy. Dybala’s current £183,000-a-week wages in the Italian capital could also pose a problem for Newcastle, as the prospect of a bumper deal would ultimately add to their losses, which currently stand at £73.4m in 2022-23, but could also disrupt the club’s wage structure. The Magpies’ chief executive some of Eddie Howe’s star players as they look to keep in line with the profitability and sustainability rules. But the report claims that Dybala’s bargain availability could see Newcastle make a swoop for him. Dybala joined Roma on a free transfer in 2022 after leaving Juventus following 293 appearances for the Old Lady that saw him lift five Scudettos and seven domestic cups in Turin. Despite his release clause, the winner hasn’t yet signalled any intention to leave this month.","pubDate":"2024-01-13 17:18:25","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31784405.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_FBL-EUR-C3-AS-ROME-FEYENOORD.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"63e46cd92f4482730ef04207a9a30430","title":"Serie A: Late Rrahmani goal snatches win for Napoli over Salernitana","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/amir-rrahmani-goal-napoli-beats-salernitana-serie-a-result-report-news/article67738828.ece","keywords":["football"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Serie A: Napoli moved up to sixth in the standings with 31 points and Salernitana stayed bottom on 12 points.","content":"Amir Rrahmani scored deep in extra time as Napoli snatched a 2-1 win at home to bottom-of-table Salernitana in Serie A on Saturday to ease the pressure on the under-fire defending champions. Napoli moved up to sixth in the standings with 31 points and Salernitana stayed bottom on 12 points. Napoli came into the match without a win in their last three league games, and the fans in the sun-soaked Stadio Diego Armando Maradona made their feelings known before the action began. “Those who don’t feel up to it should leave with dignity, we only want those who have pride, ambition and respect for the city,” read one banner unfurled by the Napoli ultras. Antonio Candreva scored a stunning goal to give Salernitana the lead in the 29th minute, taking one touch to beat Matteo Politano before curling his shot into the far top corner from well outside the area for his fifth goal this season. It looked like the visitors would take their lead into the break, but in added time Napoli was awarded a penalty for a foul by Federico Fazio on Giovanni Simeone and Politano put his spot kick into the bottom corner beyond Guillermo Ochoa. Napoli emerged for the second half with a different attitude, and Jens Cajuste had two chances at goal in the first four minutes, the second a shot from outside the area that curled just wide of the far post. That early promise soon petered out though, and again Salernitana created plenty of danger, Napoli keeper Pierluigi Gollini pushing away a cross from Loum Tchaouna with Simeon Nwankwo waiting to pounce in front of the goal. Napoli poured forward in desperation towards the end, with the crowd at their back, and in the 96th minute a free kick into the box saw keeper Ochoa collide with his teammate and when the ball fell to Rrahmani he turned and fired in from close range. The atmosphere inside the ground went from frustration to euphoria, and the result, if not the performance, may take some pressure off manager Walter Mazzarri. For Salernitana, it was heartbreak for the second weekend in a row having also lost 2-1 to an added-time goal against Juventus in their last game.

The West Ham United player is anxious to make his Africa Cup of Nations debut in Cote D'Ivoire after missing the last edition in Cameroon two years ago. The former Ajax Amsterdam man has been working hard in training to shrug off an injury that kept him on the sidelines for two weeks. In an interview with ghanafa.org, Kudus who is one of the key players for Chris Hughton at the Africa Cup of Nations Cote D'Ivoire 2023 underscores the significance of playing for the national team. ''As a professional player you going to change clubs, it’s very likely that you going to play for a lot of teams but your country and your national team remain the same . So for me to be part of the squad in a country of 30 million is a huge privilege that comes with a lot of responsibilities so I don’t joke with national team football'' Kudus said.

Albion, like against Aldershot Town in the FA Cup, effectively earned victory in the first half hour through Tom Fellows, Brandon Thomas-Asante and with the help of a Dom Hyam own goal. In the second half, Jake Garrett did offer a stylish reply for Rovers when he bent an impressive effort around Alex Palmer, but any hopes of an unlikely comeback instantly dissipated as the fabulous Thomas-Asante bagged his second of the day. On a weekend where Hull City were beaten, this was a timely victory for Albion, who put their Swansea City disappointment behind them. Albion took charge immediately. They bore too much physicality and possessed too much nous for their youthful opponents and they put those traits to good use to benefit a youngster of their own. Darnell Furlong's long throw in caused all sorts of bother in the Rovers six yard box, with Kyle Bartley and Cedric Kipre acting as awkward customers before Fellows nodded in at the back post from a yard or so out. Blackburn have been struggling lately as it is, and without crucial figure and Championship top scorer Sammie Szmodics to lead the line, they looked an outfit bereft of confidence. The manner of the second goal was a culmination of errors, which Thomas-Asante took full advantage of. Bringing the ball down, he rifled a low and powerful shot into the bottom corner. Within a couple of minutes, Albion had a third. This was a little messier, but every goal is worth the same after all. Alex Mowatt dropped short to collect a corner, and while most of The Hawthorns expected him to shape to shoot, he instead curled a dangerous delivery which Rovers keeper Leopold Wahlstedt spilled. Thomas-Asante in that moment claimed the goal from a yard or so out, but replays showed the final touch came from Dom Hyam. Albion could've gone in four or five up, in truth. Fellows enjoyed himself against make-shift left-back Callum Brittain, and he fired over when well placed. Fellows also caused problems in the area when he caught Scott Wharton off guard in possession and forced a corner kick. John Swift, back in the starting XI, would've delivered the goal of the season had his over-the-shoulder volley from Alex Mowatt's brilliant pick out found the net, and not the Smethwick End. Every fanbase will have those glass-half-empty types who won't be able to relax until their side are completely out of sight - at least four goals to the good - and Albion, historically, have been a club who have proven to be vulnerable with such a score-line, so when Garrett danced his way through striped shirts before beautifully curling into the far corner, there was a little unrest. Thomas-Asante, though, immediately killed those nerves. When the excellent Furlong nodded down Mowatt's deep delivery in the penalty area, Thomas-Asante produced a real striker's finish to turn the ball over the stretched arms of the hapless Wahlsted and secure the points. Albion might've netted more before the end, through substitutes Daryl Dike and Pipa, but this was an eye-catching win and ruthless performance. West Brom player ratings Palmer 7 Truly very little to do in the first half, bar come to claim a couple of routine crosses or gather up shots which had deflected into his vicinity. Didn't have a whole lot to do throughout, in truth, although he made one excellent save to deny Tronstad before being well beaten by Garrett's consolation. Furlong 9 Albion's long throw-in specialist was up to his usual tricks ten minutes in. Constantly made runs forward as Blackburn invited Albion onto them and combined with Fellows throughout. Immense in the second half, claiming an assist for Thomas-Asante's second goal and then almost setting up Fellows and Dike. Fantastic. Bartley 8 Commanding. Made a nuisance of himself in the build up to Fellows' opener. Whether it was young Leonard or the wily Gallagher, Bartley was in charge - the only blot on the copybook being Garrett's admittedly excellent solo goal. Kipre 8 How far has Kipre come since the opening day against this opponent? A menacing presence in the first half which snuffed out any Blackburn probes, although did find his way into the book for a risky challenge in which he got man and ball. Townsend 7 Sturdy performance from Townsend, who had an old face ahead of him on the left wing. One misplaced pass when Reach might've been away but otherwise Townsend was attentive, cut out attacks in the air and progressed forwards throughout. Yokuslu 8 From the off he set the tone by haring across the turf to close down ball-playing Blackburn opponents. Ticked over in midfield but he produced a couple of timely blocks on the edge of his own box. Dropped deep and then was confident in looking to beat the press. Mowatt 9 What a season Mowatt is having. At times here he did some wonderful things. It's not just passes - the one for Swift's volley and the danger zone delivery for the third goal - but it's his body-on-the-line approach, too, with some big blocks at critical times. One slip in his own box was the only taint. Immense. Swift 6 As electric as he was here against Norwich on Boxing Day, it was quite a disjointed start made by Swift, who misplaced a couple of passes and his corner kick radar was a little wayward. Would've scored the goal of the season had his volley found the net. Made some important contributions between the lines though. Good to see him back playing, ultimately. Reach 6 For a chap who hasn't started a match, of any kind, since April of last year, this was a very diligent showing nine and a half months down the line by Reach. Corberan described the option he provides after marking his return recently as 'useful' and, on days like this, he certainly proved to be. A good hour under his belt. Fellows 7 What a start - what a fortnight he's had. Fellows still shows signs of being a little green at this level but that's perfectly understandable. The goal set him on his way and he enjoyed himself against Brittain at left-back. Final pass or shot can continue to improve. His influence on matters waned a little in the second half but this is another big step in the right direction. Thomas-Asante 9* Fabulous striker's goal to plunder the Baggies' second, latching onto an error and properly punishing Blackburn with a wicked finish. Unfortunate not to have Albion's to his name but it was a predatory finish to kill the game. Dropped deep, knitted moves together, so positive on the ball. Substitutes Pipa (for Reach 59) 7 Because of injuries and the like, Pipa has fast become Corberan's utility man who has been able to fill in wherever he's been asked to. Came in on the left hand side here and enjoyed himself going forwards. Almost added a memorable fifth and there was still time at the end for a cheeky nutmeg. Chalobah (for Swift 59) 6 Earnest from Chalobah, who got stuck into the midfield battle right away. Cutely slipped in Dike for his decent chance. Took a whack and needed treatment but continued to break up the play and drive forward.

The Swede revealed this week that he has pancreatic cancer and the \"best case\" is that he has one year left to live, adding that one of his regrets was that he never managed his boyhood club, Liverpool. Eriksson was in charge of the Three Lions for five years between 2001 and 2006, where he managed Liverpool icons such as . The 75-year-old also enjoyed spells in the with Manchester City and Leicester City. He predominantly had success with IFK Goteborg, Benfica and in Serie A with Roma, Sampdoria and Lazio. Speaking to this week, Eriksson spoke about how his dad supported Liverpool and how that love for the club passed to down to him - following the Reds all his life. \"My father is still a Liverpool supporter and I am a Liverpool supporter too, always have been,\" he said. \"So I always wished to be the manager of Liverpool and that will not happen, but I'm still a Liverpool fan.\" Despite never managing in the home dugout on Merseyside, Eriksson has previously been an opposition manager at Anfield twice. His last encounter with the Reds was a 1-0 defeat in 2008, which came during his time with Manchester City, and before that in 1984 when his Benfica side were edged out by Joe Fagan's Liverpool. Supporters have called on the club to act and make Eriksson the manager for the upcoming Legends match against Ajax in March. Typically, Sir Kenny Dalglish takes up the position in the dugout alongside Ian Rush. but following the news of his terminal illness, fans have made a special request. Liverpool fan Douglas Horne, who runs the YouTube account 'The Doug-Out', made the suggestion on X, writing: \"Let's get Sven to manage the Liverpool legends v Ajax one last dream for him.\" \"I think people would think it a lovely thing,\" The Anfield Wrap's John Gibbons told Sky News. \"He's a popular person, but knowing that he's got this dream of being a Liverpool manager all this time just kind of hit home for those Liverpool fans even more really. We've got a legends game coming up in March, so a lot of Liverpool legends come back every year. \"It raises a lot of money for the fantastic LFC Foundation and there's maybe a role there to manage that team. It might be a legends game but it's always close to a full house at Anfield. \"A lot of great players, ex-players you know, play and it's a wonderful occasion. I'm sure as he's leading the teams out, you know this is Anfield, they will play You'll Never Walk Alone it'll feel like the closest thing. \"I've seen quite a few Liverpool fans mention that and I think it's a fantastic idea. It's not my idea, but it's one I've seen and I think it would be absolutely brilliant. Kenny Dalglish normally does it and he's done it loads of times, so I'm sure he'd be quite happy to pass it on to Sven because he's such a fantastic popular football man throughout the country. \"I'm sure everyone would love to see him do it.\"","pubDate":"2024-01-13 17:11:30","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article28441993.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1092760078.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","source_priority":3400,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"6271445f02b8a6a59a86ae15465243b3","title":"Mercato - ASSE : Le coach annonce deux départs en direct","link":"https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/mercato-asse-le-coach-annonce-deux-departs-en-direct-679537","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Le mercato de l'ASSE est très animé en ce mois de janvier 2024.

Dybala has become an incredibly attractive option for clubs to sign in the January transfer window as his bargain £11million release clause in his contract became active. The clause can’t be triggered by clubs in Serie A, but does expire on Januar 15. The 30-year-old’s future hangs in the balance as foreign clubs could pull off a bargain move for the versatile forward who has registered 11 goal involvements in 13 Serie A games so far this season. Dybala’s current contract expires in 18 months and as of yet, Roma haven’t offered him a new deal. According to Italian outlet Corriere Della Sera, Newcastle are the most interested party in triggering his cut-price release clause. However, it’s said the Magpies are restricted by FFP this month and will likely have to sell before they can buy. Dybala’s current £183,000-a-week wages in the Italian capital could also pose a problem for Newcastle, as the prospect of a bumper deal would ultimately add to their losses, which currently stand at £73.4m in 2022-23, but could also disrupt the club’s wage structure. The Magpies’ chief executive some of Eddie Howe’s star players as they look to keep in line with the profitability and sustainability rules. But the report claims that Dybala’s bargain availability could see Newcastle make a swoop for him. Dybala joined Roma on a free transfer in 2022 after leaving Juventus following 293 appearances for the Old Lady that saw him lift five Scudettos and seven domestic cups in Turin. Despite his release clause, the winner hasn’t yet signalled any intention to leave this month.","pubDate":"2024-01-13 17:18:25","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31784405.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_FBL-EUR-C3-AS-ROME-FEYENOORD.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"63e46cd92f4482730ef04207a9a30430","title":"Serie A: Late Rrahmani goal snatches win for Napoli over Salernitana","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/amir-rrahmani-goal-napoli-beats-salernitana-serie-a-result-report-news/article67738828.ece","keywords":["football"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Serie A: Napoli moved up to sixth in the standings with 31 points and Salernitana stayed bottom on 12 points.","content":"Amir Rrahmani scored deep in extra time as Napoli snatched a 2-1 win at home to bottom-of-table Salernitana in Serie A on Saturday to ease the pressure on the under-fire defending champions. Napoli moved up to sixth in the standings with 31 points and Salernitana stayed bottom on 12 points. Napoli came into the match without a win in their last three league games, and the fans in the sun-soaked Stadio Diego Armando Maradona made their feelings known before the action began. “Those who don’t feel up to it should leave with dignity, we only want those who have pride, ambition and respect for the city,” read one banner unfurled by the Napoli ultras. Antonio Candreva scored a stunning goal to give Salernitana the lead in the 29th minute, taking one touch to beat Matteo Politano before curling his shot into the far top corner from well outside the area for his fifth goal this season. It looked like the visitors would take their lead into the break, but in added time Napoli was awarded a penalty for a foul by Federico Fazio on Giovanni Simeone and Politano put his spot kick into the bottom corner beyond Guillermo Ochoa. Napoli emerged for the second half with a different attitude, and Jens Cajuste had two chances at goal in the first four minutes, the second a shot from outside the area that curled just wide of the far post. That early promise soon petered out though, and again Salernitana created plenty of danger, Napoli keeper Pierluigi Gollini pushing away a cross from Loum Tchaouna with Simeon Nwankwo waiting to pounce in front of the goal. Napoli poured forward in desperation towards the end, with the crowd at their back, and in the 96th minute a free kick into the box saw keeper Ochoa collide with his teammate and when the ball fell to Rrahmani he turned and fired in from close range. The atmosphere inside the ground went from frustration to euphoria, and the result, if not the performance, may take some pressure off manager Walter Mazzarri. For Salernitana, it was heartbreak for the second weekend in a row having also lost 2-1 to an added-time goal against Juventus in their last game.

The West Ham United player is anxious to make his Africa Cup of Nations debut in Cote D'Ivoire after missing the last edition in Cameroon two years ago.

In an interview with ghanafa.org, Kudus who is one of the key players for Chris Hughton at the Africa Cup of Nations Cote D'Ivoire 2023 underscores the significance of playing for the national team. ''As a professional player you going to change clubs, it’s very likely that you going to play for a lot of teams but your country and your national team remain the same .

Albion, like against Aldershot Town in the FA Cup, effectively earned victory in the first half hour through Tom Fellows, Brandon Thomas-Asante and with the help of a Dom Hyam own goal. In the second half, Jake Garrett did offer a stylish reply for Rovers when he bent an impressive effort around Alex Palmer, but any hopes of an unlikely comeback instantly dissipated as the fabulous Thomas-Asante bagged his second of the day. On a weekend where Hull City were beaten, this was a timely victory for Albion, who put their Swansea City disappointment behind them. Albion took charge immediately. They bore too much physicality and possessed too much nous for their youthful opponents and they put those traits to good use to benefit a youngster of their own. Darnell Furlong's long throw in caused all sorts of bother in the Rovers six yard box, with Kyle Bartley and Cedric Kipre acting as awkward customers before Fellows nodded in at the back post from a yard or so out. Blackburn have been struggling lately as it is, and without crucial figure and Championship top scorer Sammie Szmodics to lead the line, they looked an outfit bereft of confidence. The manner of the second goal was a culmination of errors, which Thomas-Asante took full advantage of. Bringing the ball down, he rifled a low and powerful shot into the bottom corner. Within a couple of minutes, Albion had a third. This was a little messier, but every goal is worth the same after all. Alex Mowatt dropped short to collect a corner, and while most of The Hawthorns expected him to shape to shoot, he instead curled a dangerous delivery which Rovers keeper Leopold Wahlstedt spilled. Thomas-Asante in that moment claimed the goal from a yard or so out, but replays showed the final touch came from Dom Hyam. Albion could've gone in four or five up, in truth. Fellows enjoyed himself against make-shift left-back Callum Brittain, and he fired over when well placed. Fellows also caused problems in the area when he caught Scott Wharton off guard in possession and forced a corner kick. John Swift, back in the starting XI, would've delivered the goal of the season had his over-the-shoulder volley from Alex Mowatt's brilliant pick out found the net, and not the Smethwick End. Every fanbase will have those glass-half-empty types who won't be able to relax until their side are completely out of sight - at least four goals to the good - and Albion, historically, have been a club who have proven to be vulnerable with such a score-line, so when Garrett danced his way through striped shirts before beautifully curling into the far corner, there was a little unrest. Thomas-Asante, though, immediately killed those nerves. When the excellent Furlong nodded down Mowatt's deep delivery in the penalty area, Thomas-Asante produced a real striker's finish to turn the ball over the stretched arms of the hapless Wahlsted and secure the points. Albion might've netted more before the end, through substitutes Daryl Dike and Pipa, but this was an eye-catching win and ruthless performance. West Brom player ratings Palmer 7 Truly very little to do in the first half, bar come to claim a couple of routine crosses or gather up shots which had deflected into his vicinity. Didn't have a whole lot to do throughout, in truth, although he made one excellent save to deny Tronstad before being well beaten by Garrett's consolation. Furlong 9 Albion's long throw-in specialist was up to his usual tricks ten minutes in. Constantly made runs forward as Blackburn invited Albion onto them and combined with Fellows throughout. Immense in the second half, claiming an assist for Thomas-Asante's second goal and then almost setting up Fellows and Dike. Fantastic. Bartley 8 Commanding. Made a nuisance of himself in the build up to Fellows' opener. Whether it was young Leonard or the wily Gallagher, Bartley was in charge - the only blot on the copybook being Garrett's admittedly excellent solo goal. Kipre 8 How far has Kipre come since the opening day against this opponent? A menacing presence in the first half which snuffed out any Blackburn probes, although did find his way into the book for a risky challenge in which he got man and ball. Townsend 7 Sturdy performance from Townsend, who had an old face ahead of him on the left wing. One misplaced pass when Reach might've been away but otherwise Townsend was attentive, cut out attacks in the air and progressed forwards throughout. Yokuslu 8 From the off he set the tone by haring across the turf to close down ball-playing Blackburn opponents. Ticked over in midfield but he produced a couple of timely blocks on the edge of his own box. Dropped deep and then was confident in looking to beat the press. Mowatt 9 What a season Mowatt is having. At times here he did some wonderful things. It's not just passes - the one for Swift's volley and the danger zone delivery for the third goal - but it's his body-on-the-line approach, too, with some big blocks at critical times. One slip in his own box was the only taint. Immense. Swift 6 As electric as he was here against Norwich on Boxing Day, it was quite a disjointed start made by Swift, who misplaced a couple of passes and his corner kick radar was a little wayward. Would've scored the goal of the season had his volley found the net. Made some important contributions between the lines though. Good to see him back playing, ultimately. Reach 6 For a chap who hasn't started a match, of any kind, since April of last year, this was a very diligent showing nine and a half months down the line by Reach. Corberan described the option he provides after marking his return recently as 'useful' and, on days like this, he certainly proved to be. A good hour under his belt. Fellows 7 What a start - what a fortnight he's had. Fellows still shows signs of being a little green at this level but that's perfectly understandable. The goal set him on his way and he enjoyed himself against Brittain at left-back. Final pass or shot can continue to improve. His influence on matters waned a little in the second half but this is another big step in the right direction. Thomas-Asante 9* Fabulous striker's goal to plunder the Baggies' second, latching onto an error and properly punishing Blackburn with a wicked finish. Unfortunate not to have Albion's to his name but it was a predatory finish to kill the game. Dropped deep, knitted moves together, so positive on the ball. Substitutes Pipa (for Reach 59) 7 Because of injuries and the like, Pipa has fast become Corberan's utility man who has been able to fill in wherever he's been asked to. Came in on the left hand side here and enjoyed himself going forwards. Almost added a memorable fifth and there was still time at the end for a cheeky nutmeg. Chalobah (for Swift 59) 6 Earnest from Chalobah, who got stuck into the midfield battle right away. Cutely slipped in Dike for his decent chance. Took a whack and needed treatment but continued to break up the play and drive forward.

The Swede revealed this week that he has pancreatic cancer and the \"best case\" is that he has one year left to live, adding that one of his regrets was that he never managed his boyhood club, Liverpool. Eriksson was in charge of the Three Lions for five years between 2001 and 2006, where he managed Liverpool icons such as . The 75-year-old also enjoyed spells in the with Manchester City and Leicester City. He predominantly had success with IFK Goteborg, Benfica and in Serie A with Roma, Sampdoria and Lazio. Speaking to this week, Eriksson spoke about how his dad supported Liverpool and how that love for the club passed to down to him - following the Reds all his life. \"My father is still a Liverpool supporter and I am a Liverpool supporter too, always have been,\" he said. \"So I always wished to be the manager of Liverpool and that will not happen, but I'm still a Liverpool fan.\" Despite never managing in the home dugout on Merseyside, Eriksson has previously been an opposition manager at Anfield twice. His last encounter with the Reds was a 1-0 defeat in 2008, which came during his time with Manchester City, and before that in 1984 when his Benfica side were edged out by Joe Fagan's Liverpool. Supporters have called on the club to act and make Eriksson the manager for the upcoming Legends match against Ajax in March. Typically, Sir Kenny Dalglish takes up the position in the dugout alongside Ian Rush. but following the news of his terminal illness, fans have made a special request. Liverpool fan Douglas Horne, who runs the YouTube account 'The Doug-Out', made the suggestion on X, writing: \"Let's get Sven to manage the Liverpool legends v Ajax one last dream for him.\" \"I think people would think it a lovely thing,\" The Anfield Wrap's John Gibbons told Sky News. \"He's a popular person, but knowing that he's got this dream of being a Liverpool manager all this time just kind of hit home for those Liverpool fans even more really. We've got a legends game coming up in March, so a lot of Liverpool legends come back every year. \"It raises a lot of money for the fantastic LFC Foundation and there's maybe a role there to manage that team. It might be a legends game but it's always close to a full house at Anfield. \"A lot of great players, ex-players you know, play and it's a wonderful occasion. I'm sure as he's leading the teams out, you know this is Anfield, they will play You'll Never Walk Alone it'll feel like the closest thing. \"I've seen quite a few Liverpool fans mention that and I think it's a fantastic idea. It's not my idea, but it's one I've seen and I think it would be absolutely brilliant. Kenny Dalglish normally does it and he's done it loads of times, so I'm sure he'd be quite happy to pass it on to Sven because he's such a fantastic popular football man throughout the country. \"I'm sure everyone would love to see him do it.\"","pubDate":"2024-01-13 17:11:30","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article28441993.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1092760078.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","source_priority":3400,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"6271445f02b8a6a59a86ae15465243b3","title":"Mercato - ASSE : Le coach annonce deux départs en direct","link":"https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/mercato-asse-le-coach-annonce-deux-departs-en-direct-679537","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Le mercato de l'ASSE est très animé en ce mois de janvier 2024.

Dybala has become an incredibly attractive option for clubs to sign in the January transfer window as his bargain £11million release clause in his contract became active. The clause can’t be triggered by clubs in Serie A, but does expire on Januar 15. The 30-year-old’s future hangs in the balance as foreign clubs could pull off a bargain move for the versatile forward who has registered 11 goal involvements in 13 Serie A games so far this season. Dybala’s current contract expires in 18 months and as of yet, Roma haven’t offered him a new deal. According to Italian outlet Corriere Della Sera, Newcastle are the most interested party in triggering his cut-price release clause. However, it’s said the Magpies are restricted by FFP this month and will likely have to sell before they can buy. Dybala’s current £183,000-a-week wages in the Italian capital could also pose a problem for Newcastle, as the prospect of a bumper deal would ultimately add to their losses, which currently stand at £73.4m in 2022-23, but could also disrupt the club’s wage structure. The Magpies’ chief executive some of Eddie Howe’s star players as they look to keep in line with the profitability and sustainability rules. But the report claims that Dybala’s bargain availability could see Newcastle make a swoop for him. Dybala joined Roma on a free transfer in 2022 after leaving Juventus following 293 appearances for the Old Lady that saw him lift five Scudettos and seven domestic cups in Turin. Despite his release clause, the winner hasn’t yet signalled any intention to leave this month.","pubDate":"2024-01-13 17:18:25","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31784405.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_FBL-EUR-C3-AS-ROME-FEYENOORD.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"63e46cd92f4482730ef04207a9a30430","title":"Serie A: Late Rrahmani goal snatches win for Napoli over Salernitana","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/amir-rrahmani-goal-napoli-beats-salernitana-serie-a-result-report-news/article67738828.ece","keywords":["football"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Serie A: Napoli moved up to sixth in the standings with 31 points and Salernitana stayed bottom on 12 points.","content":"Amir Rrahmani scored deep in extra time as Napoli snatched a 2-1 win at home to bottom-of-table Salernitana in Serie A on Saturday to ease the pressure on the under-fire defending champions. Napoli moved up to sixth in the standings with 31 points and Salernitana stayed bottom on 12 points. Napoli came into the match without a win in their last three league games, and the fans in the sun-soaked Stadio Diego Armando Maradona made their feelings known before the action began. “Those who don’t feel up to it should leave with dignity, we only want those who have pride, ambition and respect for the city,” read one banner unfurled by the Napoli ultras. Antonio Candreva scored a stunning goal to give Salernitana the lead in the 29th minute, taking one touch to beat Matteo Politano before curling his shot into the far top corner from well outside the area for his fifth goal this season. It looked like the visitors would take their lead into the break, but in added time Napoli was awarded a penalty for a foul by Federico Fazio on Giovanni Simeone and Politano put his spot kick into the bottom corner beyond Guillermo Ochoa. Napoli emerged for the second half with a different attitude, and Jens Cajuste had two chances at goal in the first four minutes, the second a shot from outside the area that curled just wide of the far post. That early promise soon petered out though, and again Salernitana created plenty of danger, Napoli keeper Pierluigi Gollini pushing away a cross from Loum Tchaouna with Simeon Nwankwo waiting to pounce in front of the goal. Napoli poured forward in desperation towards the end, with the crowd at their back, and in the 96th minute a free kick into the box saw keeper Ochoa collide with his teammate and when the ball fell to Rrahmani he turned and fired in from close range. The atmosphere inside the ground went from frustration to euphoria, and the result, if not the performance, may take some pressure off manager Walter Mazzarri. For Salernitana, it was heartbreak for the second weekend in a row having also lost 2-1 to an added-time goal against Juventus in their last game.

Albion, like against Aldershot Town in the FA Cup, effectively earned victory in the first half hour through Tom Fellows, Brandon Thomas-Asante and with the help of a Dom Hyam own goal. In the second half, Jake Garrett did offer a stylish reply for Rovers when he bent an impressive effort around Alex Palmer, but any hopes of an unlikely comeback instantly dissipated as the fabulous Thomas-Asante bagged his second of the day. On a weekend where Hull City were beaten, this was a timely victory for Albion, who put their Swansea City disappointment behind them. Albion took charge immediately. They bore too much physicality and possessed too much nous for their youthful opponents and they put those traits to good use to benefit a youngster of their own. Darnell Furlong's long throw in caused all sorts of bother in the Rovers six yard box, with Kyle Bartley and Cedric Kipre acting as awkward customers before Fellows nodded in at the back post from a yard or so out. Blackburn have been struggling lately as it is, and without crucial figure and Championship top scorer Sammie Szmodics to lead the line, they looked an outfit bereft of confidence. The manner of the second goal was a culmination of errors, which Thomas-Asante took full advantage of. Bringing the ball down, he rifled a low and powerful shot into the bottom corner. Within a couple of minutes, Albion had a third. This was a little messier, but every goal is worth the same after all. Alex Mowatt dropped short to collect a corner, and while most of The Hawthorns expected him to shape to shoot, he instead curled a dangerous delivery which Rovers keeper Leopold Wahlstedt spilled. Thomas-Asante in that moment claimed the goal from a yard or so out, but replays showed the final touch came from Dom Hyam. Albion could've gone in four or five up, in truth. Fellows enjoyed himself against make-shift left-back Callum Brittain, and he fired over when well placed. Fellows also caused problems in the area when he caught Scott Wharton off guard in possession and forced a corner kick. John Swift, back in the starting XI, would've delivered the goal of the season had his over-the-shoulder volley from Alex Mowatt's brilliant pick out found the net, and not the Smethwick End. Every fanbase will have those glass-half-empty types who won't be able to relax until their side are completely out of sight - at least four goals to the good - and Albion, historically, have been a club who have proven to be vulnerable with such a score-line, so when Garrett danced his way through striped shirts before beautifully curling into the far corner, there was a little unrest. Thomas-Asante, though, immediately killed those nerves. When the excellent Furlong nodded down Mowatt's deep delivery in the penalty area, Thomas-Asante produced a real striker's finish to turn the ball over the stretched arms of the hapless Wahlsted and secure the points. Albion might've netted more before the end, through substitutes Daryl Dike and Pipa, but this was an eye-catching win and ruthless performance. West Brom player ratings Palmer 7 Truly very little to do in the first half, bar come to claim a couple of routine crosses or gather up shots which had deflected into his vicinity. Didn't have a whole lot to do throughout, in truth, although he made one excellent save to deny Tronstad before being well beaten by Garrett's consolation. Furlong 9 Albion's long throw-in specialist was up to his usual tricks ten minutes in. Constantly made runs forward as Blackburn invited Albion onto them and combined with Fellows throughout. Immense in the second half, claiming an assist for Thomas-Asante's second goal and then almost setting up Fellows and Dike. Fantastic. Bartley 8 Commanding. Made a nuisance of himself in the build up to Fellows' opener. Whether it was young Leonard or the wily Gallagher, Bartley was in charge - the only blot on the copybook being Garrett's admittedly excellent solo goal. Kipre 8 How far has Kipre come since the opening day against this opponent? A menacing presence in the first half which snuffed out any Blackburn probes, although did find his way into the book for a risky challenge in which he got man and ball. Townsend 7 Sturdy performance from Townsend, who had an old face ahead of him on the left wing. One misplaced pass when Reach might've been away but otherwise Townsend was attentive, cut out attacks in the air and progressed forwards throughout. Yokuslu 8 From the off he set the tone by haring across the turf to close down ball-playing Blackburn opponents. Ticked over in midfield but he produced a couple of timely blocks on the edge of his own box. Dropped deep and then was confident in looking to beat the press. Mowatt 9 What a season Mowatt is having. At times here he did some wonderful things. It's not just passes - the one for Swift's volley and the danger zone delivery for the third goal - but it's his body-on-the-line approach, too, with some big blocks at critical times. One slip in his own box was the only taint. Immense. Swift 6 As electric as he was here against Norwich on Boxing Day, it was quite a disjointed start made by Swift, who misplaced a couple of passes and his corner kick radar was a little wayward. Would've scored the goal of the season had his volley found the net. Made some important contributions between the lines though. Good to see him back playing, ultimately. Reach 6 For a chap who hasn't started a match, of any kind, since April of last year, this was a very diligent showing nine and a half months down the line by Reach. Corberan described the option he provides after marking his return recently as 'useful' and, on days like this, he certainly proved to be. A good hour under his belt. Fellows 7 What a start - what a fortnight he's had. Fellows still shows signs of being a little green at this level but that's perfectly understandable. The goal set him on his way and he enjoyed himself against Brittain at left-back. Final pass or shot can continue to improve. His influence on matters waned a little in the second half but this is another big step in the right direction. Thomas-Asante 9* Fabulous striker's goal to plunder the Baggies' second, latching onto an error and properly punishing Blackburn with a wicked finish. Unfortunate not to have Albion's to his name but it was a predatory finish to kill the game. Dropped deep, knitted moves together, so positive on the ball. Substitutes Pipa (for Reach 59) 7 Because of injuries and the like, Pipa has fast become Corberan's utility man who has been able to fill in wherever he's been asked to. Came in on the left hand side here and enjoyed himself going forwards. Almost added a memorable fifth and there was still time at the end for a cheeky nutmeg. Chalobah (for Swift 59) 6 Earnest from Chalobah, who got stuck into the midfield battle right away. Cutely slipped in Dike for his decent chance. Took a whack and needed treatment but continued to break up the play and drive forward.

The Swede revealed this week that he has pancreatic cancer and the \"best case\" is that he has one year left to live, adding that one of his regrets was that he never managed his boyhood club, Liverpool. Eriksson was in charge of the Three Lions for five years between 2001 and 2006, where he managed Liverpool icons such as . The 75-year-old also enjoyed spells in the with Manchester City and Leicester City. He predominantly had success with IFK Goteborg, Benfica and in Serie A with Roma, Sampdoria and Lazio. Speaking to this week, Eriksson spoke about how his dad supported Liverpool and how that love for the club passed to down to him - following the Reds all his life. \"My father is still a Liverpool supporter and I am a Liverpool supporter too, always have been,\" he said. \"So I always wished to be the manager of Liverpool and that will not happen, but I'm still a Liverpool fan.\" Despite never managing in the home dugout on Merseyside, Eriksson has previously been an opposition manager at Anfield twice. His last encounter with the Reds was a 1-0 defeat in 2008, which came during his time with Manchester City, and before that in 1984 when his Benfica side were edged out by Joe Fagan's Liverpool. Supporters have called on the club to act and make Eriksson the manager for the upcoming Legends match against Ajax in March. Typically, Sir Kenny Dalglish takes up the position in the dugout alongside Ian Rush. but following the news of his terminal illness, fans have made a special request. Liverpool fan Douglas Horne, who runs the YouTube account 'The Doug-Out', made the suggestion on X, writing: \"Let's get Sven to manage the Liverpool legends v Ajax one last dream for him.\" \"I think people would think it a lovely thing,\" The Anfield Wrap's John Gibbons told Sky News. \"He's a popular person, but knowing that he's got this dream of being a Liverpool manager all this time just kind of hit home for those Liverpool fans even more really. We've got a legends game coming up in March, so a lot of Liverpool legends come back every year. \"It raises a lot of money for the fantastic LFC Foundation and there's maybe a role there to manage that team. It might be a legends game but it's always close to a full house at Anfield. \"A lot of great players, ex-players you know, play and it's a wonderful occasion.

Irvin Cardona est arrivé au club la semaine dernière et du côté des départs, deux milieux de terrains pourraient rapidement quitter le club du Forez. Thomas Monconduit et Julien Lobry n'étaient pas sur la feuille de match lors du match face à Laval et Olivier Dall'Oglio, le nouvel entraîneur des Verts, a annoncé que ces deux joueurs pourraient partir rapidement. L'AS Saint-Étienne avait très bien débuté le championnat de France de Ligue 2 avant de commencer à patauger et glisser dans le ventre mou du championnat. Face au troisième, Laval, l'ASSE a concédé le match nul (0-0) et se maintient à la septième place. Le mercato sera utile pour les Verts . Ce samedi après-midi, l'ASSE affrontait Laval. Mal en point depuis plusieurs matchs, les Verts n'ont pas réussi à faire mieux qu'un match nul à domicile (0-0) et restent bloqués à la septième place de Ligue 2 . En avant-match, Olivier Dall'Oglio, l'entraîneur des Verts, a évoqué plusieurs dossiers chauds du mercato au micro de BeIn Sports , notamment le possible départ de deux milieux de terrain : « Thomas Monconduit ? On a anticipé son départ. Aujourd'hui, il n'est pas dans le groupe, on verra par la suite. C'est juste une question de choix dans un premier temps. Ce sont des décisions de club. On a des bons jeunes aussi. On veut aussi faire apparaître ces jeunes à un moment donné. » Mercato - ASSE : Un joli transfert tombe à l'eau ! https://t.co/9YHtHNOrix pic.twitter.com/7uHoUpp1q7 « Victor Lobry, c'est pareil , poursuit l'ancien entraîneur de Dijon. Ce sont des garçons qui ont un état d'esprit excellent, qui ont fait un très bon travail aussi. Maintenant, on est dans cette période un peu compliquée de mercato. Des joueurs qui peuvent être sollicités ne sont parfois peut-être pas toujours à 100% sur un match. C'est pour ça que nous avons pris ces décisions au dernier moment. »","pubDate":"2024-01-13 17:10:00","image_url":"https://le10static.com/img/cache/article/288x162/0000/0023/233601.jpeg","source_id":"le10sport","source_priority":1001293,"country":["france"],"category":["sports"],"language":"french","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"dcbdcb23c80ece5ad2a02b5927c26f2d","title":"Cryptic Pochettino reveals mystery incident that ‘impacted the team’ before Chelsea’s win over Fulham","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/11789838/mauricio-pochettino-chelsea-incident-fulham/","keywords":["football","sport"],"creator":["Henry Tomlinson"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"MAURICIO POCHETTINO has revealed that a mystery incident \"impacted\" Chelsea before facing Fulham.

Pochettino's side struggled to create much in the first half until Issa Diop 's clumsy challenge handed them a penalty. Palmer dispatched the spot-kick to take his tally to nine goals in 17 league games this season. Pochettino has admitted that the team were affected during the match as \"something happened\" before kick-off. He said: \"The first half wasn't the first half we expected. \"Something happened before the game that I can't explain, but it impacted the team. \"It's nothing big. \"Small details that sometimes affect the team.
