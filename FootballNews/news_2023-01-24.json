Bullets Reserves registered a 3-0 home victory in the return leg at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre on Sunday. They won the first-leg 1-0 away at Mulanje Stadium on Thursday. SRFA vice-general secretary Kingsley Simbeye yesterday said Reserves will face Bangwe All Stars in the final this Saturday at the Kamuzu Stadium. The winner will earn promotion to the TNM Super League. On Sunday, goals from Franklin Titani, Emmanuel Saviel and Chikumbutso Salima ensured that Reserves’ maintained their unbeaten run in the second-tier league. Said Reserves coach Enos Chatama: “We are happy with this victory and we cannot wait for the final. Although we missed a lot of scoring opportunities, we are satisfied with the result.” But Fomo assistant coach John Majiga attributed their defeat to “poor” officiation and his charges’ struggles to play on the artificial turf. “The referees were biased towards Reserves. Their first goal was scored from an off-side position, but they let it stand. Moreover, this was the first time we were playing on the artificial turf and it was quite a challenge for most of our players,” he said. Reserves, powered by quick transition and some crispy passes, dominated the action right from the start, but they only got their opener in the 31st minute through Titani, who lurched onto Salima’s through ball before rounding off Fomo goalkeeper Sunganani Mponda to slot the ball home. They doubled the lead two minutes before the break through Saviel who connected home Salima’s diagonal pass in the box to take his tally to 23 goals. Salima finally transformed from being an assist specialist into a goal scorer eight minutes into the second half. A miscalculated back-pass by Fomo defender Oscar Manswaya landed perfectly in the path of Salima, who effortlessly slotted into the far corner. Reserves could have scored more had they not missed a number of chances. Fomo had at least four chances the best of which striker Hassan Luwembe missed. His thunderous effort in the first half squirmed just a few inches away from goal.","pubDate":"2023-01-24 05:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mwnation","category":["sports"],"country":["malawi"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gareth Bale to make his PGA Tour debut","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/gareth-bale-to-make-his-pga-tour-debut-8400537/","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:47:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lampard sacked as boss of troubled Everton","link":"https://www.thephuketnews.com/lampard-sacked-as-boss-of-troubled-everton-86951.php","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"FOOTBALL: Frank Lampard was sacked as Everton manager yesterday (Jan 23) after less than a year in charge at the struggling Premier League club.","content":"Lampard was hired by Everton to replace Rafael Benitez in January 2022, but the former Chelsea boss leaves with the team languishing 19 th in the table. Everton fell to a damaging 2-0 defeat at relegation rivals West Ham on Saturday - a ninth loss in their past 12 Premier League matches which left them level on points with bottom club Southampton. Everton owner Farhad Moshiri had previously offered public backing for Lampard. But the tame surrender at West Ham proved the final straw for Moshiri, who was at the game to watch Everton for the first time in 14 months. After several hours of reports that Lampard had been sacked, Everton finally confirmed the 44-year-old’s departure last night. “Everton Football Club can confirm that Frank Lampard has left his post as senior men’s first team manager today,” a club statement said. “Everyone at Everton would like to thank Frank and his coaching staff for their service during what has been a challenging 12 months. “Frank and his team’s commitment and dedication have been exemplary throughout their time at the club, but recent results and the current league position meant this difficult decision had to be taken. “We wish Frank and all his backroom team well for their future in the game. “The club has started the process to secure a new manager and will provide updates on the appointment in due course.” Paul Tait and Leighton Baines will take training until a new manager is appointed, with Everton’s next game against Premier League leaders Arsenal on Feb 4. Everton felt compelled to act over Lampard’s future as they fight to avoid playing outside the top flight for the first time since 1954. Lampard arrived at Everton 12 months ago with the team languishing in 16 th place and the former Chelsea and England midfielder initially looked a shrewd appointment, helping the Merseyside club avoid relegation. Fan fury Fuelled by fervent backing from their fans at Goodison Park, the Toffees beat the drop by winning three of their last six league matches, including a dramatic 3-2 success against Crystal Palace that preserved their top-tier status. But Everton are now looking for their eighth permanent manager in less than seven years after Lampard failed to build on the momentum from that successful end to last term. In a sign of the turmoil enveloping Everton, club directors were earlier this month ordered to stay away from Goodison Park due to perceived security risks. Lampard won only 12 of his 44 matches in charge of Everton in all competitions. Former Burnley boss Sean Dyche, ex-Leeds coach Marcelo Bielsa and West Ham’s former Everton manager David Moyes are among the potential candidates to replace Lampard, according to bookmakers. Al-Ittihad boss Nuno Espirito Santo, formerly of Wolves, and ex-Everton striker Wayne Rooney, now in charge of MLS side DC United, have also been mooted as possible contenders. Hampered by the sale of Brazil forward Richarlison to Tottenham in the close season, Everton managed only three wins in 20 league games this term against a backdrop of mounting fan fury. There have been widespread protests against the board and Lampard at recent games. Supporters staged a sit-in demonstration after the recent loss to Southampton, with Everton defender Yerry Mina and team-mate Anthony Gordon confronted by fans when they left Goodison Park in their cars. Responding to Lampard’s sacking, Everton fans’ group ‘NSNOW’ called for Moshiri to “stop the rot”. “Nothing tells the story of Everton’s mismanagement under the current owner and board more than the fact we now need to appoint our eighth ‘permanent’ manager since 2016,” the statement said. “The chaos and dysfunction within Everton’s leadership has got us into this position. The owner needs to take urgent and radical steps to stop the rot. Or sell to someone who will.”","pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:25:00","image_url":" \n\t\t","source_id":"thephuketnews","category":["sports"],"country":["thailand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"While You Were Asleep: Mbappe scores five, Kane wins it for Tottenham, Empoli stun Inter Milan","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/while-you-were-asleep-mbappe-scores-five-kane-wins-it-for-tottenham-empoli-stun-inter-milan-8400464/","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:19:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Poland to appoint former Portugal manager Fernando Santos as coach, says FA","link":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2023/01/24/soccer/santos-poland-coach/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["No Author"],"video_url":null,"description":"Santos and the Portuguese Football Federation agreed to terminate his contract as Portugal coach in December, after their World Cup quarter-final exit to Morocco.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:04:16","image_url":"https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/np_file_206532.jpeg","source_id":"japantimes","category":["sports"],"country":["japan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Newcomers Madagascar hammer Sudan to reach CHAN last 8","link":"https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2023/01/24/newcomers-madagascar-hammer-sudan-to-reach-chan-last-8/","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":["AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE"],"video_url":null,"description":"ALGIERS, Algeria, Jan 24 – Debutants Madagascar swept into the African Nations Championship (CHAN) quarter-finals on Monday with a 3-0 drubbing of Sudan in Algeria.

Ghana progressed as runners-up and will face the Group E winners — Cameroon or Niger — in another fixture on Saturday.

Solomampionona Razafindranaivo doubled the lead on the half-hour with the goal of the match — a superb lofted shot with the side of his foot over Mustafa. Lalaina Rafanomezantsoa completed the rout three minutes later with a simple tap-in off a low cross after Mustafa had been rounded. This is the second time Madagascar have made an instant impact in a CAF tournament after debuting in the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) four years ago and reaching the quarter-finals in Egypt. The CAN is open to home and foreign-based players while the CHAN is confined to footballers with clubs in their country of birth. But despite the restrictions, CHAN matches are classified as full internationals with results counting toward the FIFA world rankings.

Bullets Reserves registered a 3-0 home victory in the return leg at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre on Sunday. They won the first-leg 1-0 away at Mulanje Stadium on Thursday. SRFA vice-general secretary Kingsley Simbeye yesterday said Reserves will face Bangwe All Stars in the final this Saturday at the Kamuzu Stadium. The winner will earn promotion to the TNM Super League. On Sunday, goals from Franklin Titani, Emmanuel Saviel and Chikumbutso Salima ensured that Reserves’ maintained their unbeaten run in the second-tier league. Said Reserves coach Enos Chatama: “We are happy with this victory and we cannot wait for the final. Although we missed a lot of scoring opportunities, we are satisfied with the result.” But Fomo assistant coach John Majiga attributed their defeat to “poor” officiation and his charges’ struggles to play on the artificial turf. “The referees were biased towards Reserves. Their first goal was scored from an off-side position, but they let it stand. Moreover, this was the first time we were playing on the artificial turf and it was quite a challenge for most of our players,” he said. Reserves, powered by quick transition and some crispy passes, dominated the action right from the start, but they only got their opener in the 31st minute through Titani, who lurched onto Salima’s through ball before rounding off Fomo goalkeeper Sunganani Mponda to slot the ball home. They doubled the lead two minutes before the break through Saviel who connected home Salima’s diagonal pass in the box to take his tally to 23 goals. Salima finally transformed from being an assist specialist into a goal scorer eight minutes into the second half. A miscalculated back-pass by Fomo defender Oscar Manswaya landed perfectly in the path of Salima, who effortlessly slotted into the far corner. Reserves could have scored more had they not missed a number of chances. Fomo had at least four chances the best of which striker Hassan Luwembe missed. His thunderous effort in the first half squirmed just a few inches away from goal.","pubDate":"2023-01-24 05:40:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mwnation","category":["sports"],"country":["malawi"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gareth Bale to make his PGA Tour debut","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/gareth-bale-to-make-his-pga-tour-debut-8400537/","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:47:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lampard sacked as boss of troubled Everton","link":"https://www.thephuketnews.com/lampard-sacked-as-boss-of-troubled-everton-86951.php","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"FOOTBALL: Frank Lampard was sacked as Everton manager yesterday (Jan 23) after less than a year in charge at the struggling Premier League club.","content":"Lampard was hired by Everton to replace Rafael Benitez in January 2022, but the former Chelsea boss leaves with the team languishing 19 th in the table.

Everton owner Farhad Moshiri had previously offered public backing for Lampard. But the tame surrender at West Ham proved the final straw for Moshiri, who was at the game to watch Everton for the first time in 14 months. After several hours of reports that Lampard had been sacked, Everton finally confirmed the 44-year-old’s departure last night. “Everton Football Club can confirm that Frank Lampard has left his post as senior men’s first team manager today,” a club statement said. “Everyone at Everton would like to thank Frank and his coaching staff for their service during what has been a challenging 12 months. “Frank and his team’s commitment and dedication have been exemplary throughout their time at the club, but recent results and the current league position meant this difficult decision had to be taken. “We wish Frank and all his backroom team well for their future in the game. “The club has started the process to secure a new manager and will provide updates on the appointment in due course.” Paul Tait and Leighton Baines will take training until a new manager is appointed, with Everton’s next game against Premier League leaders Arsenal on Feb 4.

Ghana progressed as runners-up and will face the Group E winners — Cameroon or Niger — in another fixture on Saturday. Tokinantenaina Randriatsiferana put Madagascar 1-0 up after 13 minutes on a chilly night in the eastern city of Constantine, beating goalkeeper Mohamed Mustafa at his near post with a low shot. Solomampionona Razafindranaivo doubled the lead on the half-hour with the goal of the match — a superb lofted shot with the side of his foot over Mustafa. Lalaina Rafanomezantsoa completed the rout three minutes later with a simple tap-in off a low cross after Mustafa had been rounded. This is the second time Madagascar have made an instant impact in a CAF tournament after debuting in the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) four years ago and reaching the quarter-finals in Egypt. The CAN is open to home and foreign-based players while the CHAN is confined to footballers with clubs in their country of birth. But despite the restrictions, CHAN matches are classified as full internationals with results counting toward the FIFA world rankings.

The decorated star has now revealed that he will once again be competing in California, but this time on a golf course rather than a football pitch. \"But who knows, he could surprise everybody and just do it!\" The former forward's passion for golf is widely known to football supporters, especially those in Madrid. He had a huge fallout with Los Blancos supporters during his spell at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he was accused of lacking commitment due to his liking for golf, with some fans believing it was an unnecessary distraction. This was made worse when he celebrated the Dragons' 2020 UEFA European Championship qualification by holding up a flag that read: \"Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.\" The 111-capped Wales international responded to claims that golf was a distraction in 2020, stating: \"Football is my No. 1 sport. I'm paid to do it and I always give my best. Golf is a hobby like anyone else would have a hobby. \"There is nothing wrong with having a round. People make a lot of it, but a lot of footballers play and it's one thing I really enjoy.\" The Welshmen is considered among the greatest British footballers of all time following a trophy-laden career, epitomised by five UEFA Champions League titles, the joint-most by any player.

Or sell to someone who will.”","pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:25:00","image_url":" \n\t\t","source_id":"thephuketnews","category":["sports"],"country":["thailand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"While You Were Asleep: Mbappe scores five, Kane wins it for Tottenham, Empoli stun Inter Milan","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/while-you-were-asleep-mbappe-scores-five-kane-wins-it-for-tottenham-empoli-stun-inter-milan-8400464/","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:19:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Poland to appoint former Portugal manager Fernando Santos as coach, says FA","link":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2023/01/24/soccer/santos-poland-coach/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["No Author"],"video_url":null,"description":"Santos and the Portuguese Football Federation agreed to terminate his contract as Portugal coach in December, after their World Cup quarter-final exit to Morocco.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:04:16","image_url":"https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/np_file_206532.jpeg","source_id":"japantimes","category":["sports"],"country":["japan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Newcomers Madagascar hammer Sudan to reach CHAN last 8","link":"https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2023/01/24/newcomers-madagascar-hammer-sudan-to-reach-chan-last-8/","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":["AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE"],"video_url":null,"description":"ALGIERS, Algeria, Jan 24 – Debutants Madagascar swept into the African Nations Championship (CHAN) quarter-finals on Monday with a 3-0 drubbing of Sudan in Algeria.

Ghana progressed as runners-up and will face the Group E winners — Cameroon or Niger — in another fixture on Saturday. Tokinantenaina Randriatsiferana put Madagascar 1-0 up after 13 minutes on a chilly night in the eastern city of Constantine, beating goalkeeper Mohamed Mustafa at his near post with a low shot. Solomampionona Razafindranaivo doubled the lead on the half-hour with the goal of the match — a superb lofted shot with the side of his foot over Mustafa. Lalaina Rafanomezantsoa completed the rout three minutes later with a simple tap-in off a low cross after Mustafa had been rounded. This is the second time Madagascar have made an instant impact in a CAF tournament after debuting in the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) four years ago and reaching the quarter-finals in Egypt. The CAN is open to home and foreign-based players while the CHAN is confined to footballers with clubs in their country of birth. But despite the restrictions, CHAN matches are classified as full internationals with results counting toward the FIFA world rankings. On Tuesday, the last two quarter-finals places will be filled after an Oran double-header in which Mali face Mauritania in Group D and Cameroon meet Niger in Group E.","pubDate":"2023-01-24 02:01:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"capitalfm","category":["sports"],"country":["kenya"],"language":"english"}]}
