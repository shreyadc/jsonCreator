Especially after a 6-0 loss to Germany in the opener. But a 1-0 victory over Colombia on Thursday propelled Morocco beyond the group stage ‚Äî a first for an Arab or North African nation. The team‚Äôs success is being talked about in the bustling cafes and restaurants of Rabat, where news of the victory was spreading. Hicham El Haddaoui, a waiter at Abtal Al Cham restaurant, spoke about his newfound appreciation for women‚Äôs soccer. ‚ÄúI was not used to watching Moroccan women‚Äôs football,‚Äù he said. However, the World Cup games have changed his perspective. News of the accomplishment went viral on social media, though word spread later in the day because many people were still at work ‚Äî if not on vacation. So there were no immediate widespread street celebrations or car honking taking place. Still, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. ‚ÄúThis achievement truly exemplifies the hard work and determination demonstrated by the Moroccan women‚Äôs team,‚Äù said Ibrahim Barakat, a 25-year-old student in Rabat. ‚ÄúDespite suffering a loss in the opening game, they showed their true character by not only taking part but also qualifying (for the next round).‚Äù While men‚Äôs soccer has long been the dominant sport in Morocco, reactions to the women‚Äôs team‚Äôs success have shown a remarkable shift. Even as the time difference has affected spectator interaction, the women‚Äôs team‚Äôs performance has sparked a surge of national pride and interest in women‚Äôs soccer. Thursdays Keep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter. This is not to say that the accomplishment has been universally celebrated. In some parts of the Arab world, the historical bias against women‚Äôs soccer remains prevalent, as evidenced by the limited media coverage and attention given to the team‚Äôs performance. Nonetheless, the team‚Äôs historic run has created interest and brought visibility to the women‚Äôs game in the country. This shift, although not seismic, marks a significant step forward for the sport in a region where it has traditionally been overshadowed by the men‚Äôs game. At the cafe in Sale, a suburb of the Moroccan capital of Rabat, Alaoui said the team‚Äôs resiliency has convinced her that they‚Äôre capable of ‚Äúeven more impressive feats in the matches to come.‚Äù ___ AP Women‚Äôs World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-08-03 17:22:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man United starlet Amad Diallo will NOT leave Old Trafford on loan - with suitors Leicester and Burnley no longer interested in the winger after he picked up an injury against Arsenal","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12370167/Amad-Diallo-MISS-start-Manchester-Uniteds-season-suffering-knee-injury-friendly-victory-Arsenal-blow-manager-Erik-ten-Hag.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Amad picked up the injury in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal in a pre-season friendly on July 23.

The Red Devils have confirmed that the winger will miss the start of the new Premier League campaign, which begins with a clash against Wolves at Old Trafford on August 14. Diallo, who prospered on loan at Sunderland last season, was set to undergo another loan spell this term, but interested clubs have now been put off a deal as a result of the injury. After revealing on Thursday that the 21-year-old starlet would not be fit for the 'first part' of the campaign, suitors Leicester, Burnley and Sheffield United are believed to have lost interest. United's statement read: 'Unfortunately, he (Amad) has been ruled out of the first part of the 2023-24 campaign, and we await further details on his estimated recovery date, with the home league clash against Wolverhampton Wanderers up first for Erik ten Hag's Reds on Monday 14 August.' Man United have confirmed Amad Diallo will miss the start of the new season through injury The 21-year-old winger picked up the injury in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal on July 23 ‚ÑπÔ∏è The young Red will be ruled out for the start of the new season. Wishing you a speedy recovery, @AmadDiallo_19 ! üôè #MUFC ‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) August 3, 2023 Amad picked up the injury during United's 2-0 victory over Arsenal on July 23 and will therefore miss this weekend's double-header against Lens and Athletic Club. Diallo was substituted off just 13 minutes after coming on, clutching his ankle in some pain. Under the escort of medics, he hobbled off the pitch before being substituted four minutes later. The sight of Diallo leaving on crutches undoubtedly marked a sour point for United, despite their triumphant 2-0 win. Facundo Pellistri was brought on for the former Black Cats star in front of a 82,262 crowd in New Jersey. The Ivorian (L) was tripped up by Gabriel Martinelli (R) during his 13-minute stint on the pitch In videos posted to social media, Diallo was seen to be transported elsewhere via a golf buggy. Leicester initially faced competition from Burnley and Sheffield United as well as other Premier League outfits. However, it now seems Diallo will begin the new campaign at Old Trafford - and will have to win Ten Hag's favour by breaking his way into the first team squad. Diallo flourished on loan at Sunderland last term, scoring 14 goals as the Black Cats made it to the Championship play-offs.

We were praying while we were watching the game,‚Äù said midfielder Anissa Lahmari, who scored Morocco‚Äôs winning goal in first-half stoppage time on Thursday. ‚ÄúAfterwards it was just a complete explosion of joy.‚Äù Cue celebrations, both in Morocco and other parts of the Arab world. In one of the most unexpected outcomes in the last days of the group stage, Morocco advanced to the knockout round in second place behind Colombia while No. 2-ranked Germany failed to advance for the first time at the tournament. Morocco is the first Arab or North African nation to qualify for the Women‚Äôs World Cup and now the first to advance beyond the group stage. That‚Äôs something none of the other seven tournament newcomers managed to do. And it all started with a thumping 6-0 loss to Germany. While the Moroccans recovered to win their next two games, Germany lost 2-1 to Colombia and then was held 1-1 by South Korea when it needed a win in Brisbane to avoid elimination. ‚ÄúWhen we had won the match, the most stressful thing was the other match,‚Äù Morocco coach Reynald Pedros said. The last two group games started at the same time on opposite sides of the Australian continent but stoppage time in Brisbane lasted longer. ‚ÄúWe waited, and then the good news arrived. It was incredible,‚Äù Pedros said. If Morocco‚Äôs qualification for the Women‚Äôs World Cup inspired a generation, this run to the knockout stage will cement a legacy for the Atlas Lionesses. The win over South Korea last weekend was historic for the team, for Ibtissam Jra√Ødi scoring the Morocco‚Äôs first World Cup goal, and for another significant milestone ‚Äî defender Nouhaila Benzina became the first player to wear a Hijab in a World Cup game at the senior level. ‚ÄúAfter the first match of the tournament, I think 98% of people thought it was over, apart from us,‚Äù Pedros said. ‚ÄúWe thought we could do something, because football is magic. ‚ÄúWe know that emotions and hard work can lead to good things. If we are at the next stage, it‚Äôs because we deserve it, for all the hard work.‚Äù The game against Colombia was an even contest right through the first half until Jraidi was fouled in the penalty area in the dying seconds before the break. Ghizlane Chebbak‚Äôs penalty attempt was saved, but Lahmari swooped on the rebound to put her team ahead of Colombia ‚Äî and, just as importantly, ahead of Germany in the standings. Colombia had its best scoring chance in the 59th minute, when 18-year-old Linda Caicedo served a ball to the far post, which Daniela Montoya one-timed to the left of goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi. The Moroccan ‚Äòkeeper made a reflex kick save, blocking the ball with just the front edge of her right cleat. In the 69th, Caicedo, after a long run, stopped and leaned on the field barrier, reaching down to her left ankle and foot. She appeared hobbled for several minutes but stayed in the match. WHY IT MATTERS Moroccan soccer fans have had plenty of celebrate with their national teams at the most recent World Cups. The Atlas Lionesses created history just by qualifying, and then just by scoring their first win. Beating Colombia to knock Germany out of the tournament was another level. Morocco‚Äôs men‚Äôs team also made World Cup history last year. In the 2022 men‚Äôs World Cup, the Atlas Lions advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1986 and became the first African or Arab nation to reach a World Cup semifinal. Colombia wins its group for the first time in team history and is in the knockout rounds for the first time since 2015. IN THEIR OWN WORDS Morocco‚Äôs fans ‚Äúare going to support us one more time. We love them, we cherish them, we feel they‚Äôre behind us. It gives us strength. Well done to all the girls and we‚Äôre continuing on our merry way.‚Äù ‚Äî Reynald Pedros, Morocco coach. ‚ÄúIt was an intense game and a very strategic game. We lost because of a mistake we made in the goal area, with the penalty.‚Äù ‚Äî Nelson Abad√≠a, Colombia coach. WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT Morocco, as the Group H runner-up, will play Group F winner France in Adelaide on Tuesday. Colombia will play Group F runner-up Jamaica the same day in Melbourne. ___ Anna Ruth Riggins contributed to this report from Sydney.

The 34-year-old, formerly of Chelsea and Arsenal , penned a new one-year contract on July 17, ending speculation over his future. Mail Sport reported how, after his initial deal ran down , Willian held talks with Forest over a potential move and even visited their training ground. He ultimately snubbed the offer from Steve Cooper's side and decided to stay in west London after an impressive debut season at the club which saw him score five goals and register six assists in 27 Premier League appearances. However, according to The Telegraph , Willian is now being targeted by Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Shabab. Fulham winger Willian is wanted by Saudi Arabian side Al Shabab despite signing a new deal It provides a headache for Cottagers boss Marco Silva who has faced a summer of disruption The report states the suitors are planning to double his current salary, although no official offer has so far been forthcoming for the Brazilian winger. Fulham - who are hoping to build on last season's 10th place finish - would expect a transfer fee to be paid for Willian if he does depart Marco Silva's side. When he signed his new deal, Willian had outlined his delight at extending his stay for another season. He said: 'I am completely happy. Happy to sign one more year with Fulham. 'Happy to continue the work that I did last season with all my team-mates and the whole club. 'I think it‚Äôs a club that can do even better this season, so I‚Äôm happy to continue this amazing adventure.' The rise to prominence of the Saudi Pro League continues to provide a headache for Fulham with Silva rejecting a ¬£40m offer to take over at Al-Ahli this summer. Al-Shabab would double the Brazilian's wages, although Fulham are yet to receive an offer Aleksandar Mitrovic is also attracting interest from Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal keen on him Meanwhile, Al-Hilal - who Silva also rejected an offer from - are in for star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, but the Cottagers have already turned down several bids having slapped a ¬£52m price tag on his head. However, Mitrovic is desperate to make the move and did not feature in any of Fulham's pre-season games on their US tour. The club are keen to bring in further reinforcements this summer having only added Calvin Bassey from Ajax and Raul Jimenez from Wolves so far. Chelsea 's Callum Hudson-Odoi and Demarai Gray of Everton are among their targets ahead of starting the season away at the Toffees on August 12.

Germany‚Äôs 1-1 draw with the Koreans coupled with Morocco‚Äôs surprise 1-0 victory over Colombia saw the European side suffer their earliest exit in Women‚Äôs World Cup history. The two-time former champions and one of the pre-tournament favorites follow Brazil, Italy and Olympic champions Canada out of the competition in double-quick time. Colombia topped Group H despite losing and will face Jamaica in the last 16. Morocco progressed into the knockouts on their World Cup debut also with two wins and a defeat, and meet France next. Germany were third and condemned to an early flight home. ‚ÄúTo be honest, it‚Äôs still hard to understand,‚Äù skipper Alexandra Popp, who scored the German goal and was their chief threat throughout, told German TV network ZDF. ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt quite understand what happened here.‚Äù Coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg said that there was ‚Äúa lot of uncertainty today‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn the end you have to say that our performance was not enough.‚Äù The 2003 and 2007 winners Germany came into the game in front of just under 39,000 in Brisbane knowing that a win over South Korea would put them in the last 16. But they started badly, conceding to a smart Cho So-hyun finish after just six minutes and looking shaky at the back early on. Colin Bell‚Äôs South Korea looked nothing like the team that lost 2-0 to Colombia and 1-0 to Morocco. Germany equalized just before half-time with a Popp header but for all their possession, last year‚Äôs European finalists failed to get the second goal they desperately needed. Popp thought she had won it in the second half with another fierce header, but it was ruled out by VAR for off-side. Sydney Lohmann‚Äôs effort went just over deep in stoppage time and Germany now needed a favor from Colombia. A draw would have been enough for Germany had Morocco not sprung a surprise of their own in Perth. Anissa Lahmari‚Äôs goal in first-half stoppage time, after captain Ghizlane Chebbak‚Äôs penalty kick was spectacularly saved, won it for Morocco. With the Morocco game ending slightly before events in Brisbane, the Atlas Lionesses faced an anxious wait. When Germany‚Äôs fate was sealed the Moroccan players went wild on the pitch. The Koreans finished bottom of the group with one point but at least salvaged some pride. England now favorites? The United States are into the knockout rounds and a date with third-ranked Sweden on Sunday, but the Americans have looked nothing like a team capable of winning a third World Cup in a row. They scraped through with a 0-0 draw against tournament debutants Portugal, the Portuguese striking the post in injury time ‚Äì a goal would have sent the US home. European champions England now look the team to beat. They were touted before the tournament as the biggest threat to the United States and after an indifferent start, they thrashed China 6-1 to progress in style. Sarina Wiegman‚Äôs side face Nigeria, who along with South Africa, Jamaica and Morocco confounded expectations by getting out of the group stage. South Africa scored an injury-time winner to send Italy out on Wednesday, then that same evening Jamaica strangled Brazil 0-0 to end the South Americans‚Äô hopes.

The Turin club have been working on a deal for Romelu Lukaku and had re-opened talks with Chelsea over a ¬£38.5m transfer that could see Dusan Vlahovic move in the opposite direction. But according to Calciomercato.com , although the Belgian remains the priority target for the Old Lady, Morata - who played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and then from 2020 to 2022 - has been identified as a viable alternative. Better still, Juventus have reportedly already obtained a 'yes' from the Atletico Madrid striker for another reunion. Morata has scored more goals for Juve than any other, netting 59 times in 185 appearances across two spells. The 30-year-old star claimed two Serie A titles during his first stint and was part of the squad, led by Massimiliano Allegri, that reached the final of the Champions League in 2015. Alvaro Morata has reportedly been identified as an alternative attacking recruit this summer Morata gave Juventus parity in the 2015 Champions League final before Barcelona won 3-1 Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri has managed the Spaniard for three seasons across two spells In Morata, Allegri knows he has a striker who can perform in his system, even if he is some years removed from his prime. Last season, the Spanish international could only manage 15 goals from 45 appearances for Atletico, who finished 11 points behind eventual La Liga winners Barcelona. Meanwhile, Juventus moving on to Morata would put Chelsea back at square one in terms of seeking an exit for Lukaku. The front man appears to have spurned the affection of fans and colleagues at Inter Milan on account of the transfer links to Juventus, and his parent-club have no interest in seeing him return. Mauricio Pochettino may be forced to try and re-integrate the 30-year-old into the fold if the Blues' attacking issues of last season persist into the new campaign.

Especially after a 6-0 loss to Germany in the opener. But a 1-0 victory over Colombia on Thursday propelled Morocco beyond the group stage ‚Äî a first for an Arab or North African nation. The team‚Äôs success is being talked about in the bustling cafes and restaurants of Rabat, where news of the victory was spreading. Hicham El Haddaoui, a waiter at Abtal Al Cham restaurant, spoke about his newfound appreciation for women‚Äôs soccer. ‚ÄúI was not used to watching Moroccan women‚Äôs football,‚Äù he said. However, the World Cup games have changed his perspective. News of the accomplishment went viral on social media, though word spread later in the day because many people were still at work ‚Äî if not on vacation. So there were no immediate widespread street celebrations or car honking taking place. Still, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. ‚ÄúThis achievement truly exemplifies the hard work and determination demonstrated by the Moroccan women‚Äôs team,‚Äù said Ibrahim Barakat, a 25-year-old student in Rabat. ‚ÄúDespite suffering a loss in the opening game, they showed their true character by not only taking part but also qualifying (for the next round).‚Äù While men‚Äôs soccer has long been the dominant sport in Morocco, reactions to the women‚Äôs team‚Äôs success have shown a remarkable shift. Even as the time difference has affected spectator interaction, the women‚Äôs team‚Äôs performance has sparked a surge of national pride and interest in women‚Äôs soccer. Thursdays Keep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter. This is not to say that the accomplishment has been universally celebrated. In some parts of the Arab world, the historical bias against women‚Äôs soccer remains prevalent, as evidenced by the limited media coverage and attention given to the team‚Äôs performance. Nonetheless, the team‚Äôs historic run has created interest and brought visibility to the women‚Äôs game in the country. This shift, although not seismic, marks a significant step forward for the sport in a region where it has traditionally been overshadowed by the men‚Äôs game. At the cafe in Sale, a suburb of the Moroccan capital of Rabat, Alaoui said the team‚Äôs resiliency has convinced her that they‚Äôre capable of ‚Äúeven more impressive feats in the matches to come.‚Äù ___ AP Women‚Äôs World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-08-03 17:22:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man United starlet Amad Diallo will NOT leave Old Trafford on loan - with suitors Leicester and Burnley no longer interested in the winger after he picked up an injury against Arsenal","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12370167/Amad-Diallo-MISS-start-Manchester-Uniteds-season-suffering-knee-injury-friendly-victory-Arsenal-blow-manager-Erik-ten-Hag.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Amad picked up the injury in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal in a pre-season friendly on July 23.

The Red Devils have confirmed that the winger will miss the start of the new Premier League campaign, which begins with a clash against Wolves at Old Trafford on August 14. Diallo, who prospered on loan at Sunderland last season, was set to undergo another loan spell this term, but interested clubs have now been put off a deal as a result of the injury. After revealing on Thursday that the 21-year-old starlet would not be fit for the 'first part' of the campaign, suitors Leicester, Burnley and Sheffield United are believed to have lost interest. United's statement read: 'Unfortunately, he (Amad) has been ruled out of the first part of the 2023-24 campaign, and we await further details on his estimated recovery date, with the home league clash against Wolverhampton Wanderers up first for Erik ten Hag's Reds on Monday 14 August.' Man United have confirmed Amad Diallo will miss the start of the new season through injury The 21-year-old winger picked up the injury in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal on July 23 ‚ÑπÔ∏è The young Red will be ruled out for the start of the new season. Wishing you a speedy recovery, @AmadDiallo_19 ! üôè #MUFC ‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) August 3, 2023 Amad picked up the injury during United's 2-0 victory over Arsenal on July 23 and will therefore miss this weekend's double-header against Lens and Athletic Club. Diallo was substituted off just 13 minutes after coming on, clutching his ankle in some pain. Under the escort of medics, he hobbled off the pitch before being substituted four minutes later. The sight of Diallo leaving on crutches undoubtedly marked a sour point for United, despite their triumphant 2-0 win. Facundo Pellistri was brought on for the former Black Cats star in front of a 82,262 crowd in New Jersey. The Ivorian (L) was tripped up by Gabriel Martinelli (R) during his 13-minute stint on the pitch In videos posted to social media, Diallo was seen to be transported elsewhere via a golf buggy. Leicester initially faced competition from Burnley and Sheffield United as well as other Premier League outfits. However, it now seems Diallo will begin the new campaign at Old Trafford - and will have to win Ten Hag's favour by breaking his way into the first team squad. Diallo flourished on loan at Sunderland last term, scoring 14 goals as the Black Cats made it to the Championship play-offs.

We were praying while we were watching the game,‚Äù said midfielder Anissa Lahmari, who scored Morocco‚Äôs winning goal in first-half stoppage time on Thursday. ‚ÄúAfterwards it was just a complete explosion of joy.‚Äù Cue celebrations, both in Morocco and other parts of the Arab world. In one of the most unexpected outcomes in the last days of the group stage, Morocco advanced to the knockout round in second place behind Colombia while No. 2-ranked Germany failed to advance for the first time at the tournament. Morocco is the first Arab or North African nation to qualify for the Women‚Äôs World Cup and now the first to advance beyond the group stage. That‚Äôs something none of the other seven tournament newcomers managed to do. And it all started with a thumping 6-0 loss to Germany. While the Moroccans recovered to win their next two games, Germany lost 2-1 to Colombia and then was held 1-1 by South Korea when it needed a win in Brisbane to avoid elimination. ‚ÄúWhen we had won the match, the most stressful thing was the other match,‚Äù Morocco coach Reynald Pedros said. The last two group games started at the same time on opposite sides of the Australian continent but stoppage time in Brisbane lasted longer. ‚ÄúWe waited, and then the good news arrived. It was incredible,‚Äù Pedros said. If Morocco‚Äôs qualification for the Women‚Äôs World Cup inspired a generation, this run to the knockout stage will cement a legacy for the Atlas Lionesses. The win over South Korea last weekend was historic for the team, for Ibtissam Jra√Ødi scoring the Morocco‚Äôs first World Cup goal, and for another significant milestone ‚Äî defender Nouhaila Benzina became the first player to wear a Hijab in a World Cup game at the senior level. ‚ÄúAfter the first match of the tournament, I think 98% of people thought it was over, apart from us,‚Äù Pedros said. ‚ÄúWe thought we could do something, because football is magic. ‚ÄúWe know that emotions and hard work can lead to good things. If we are at the next stage, it‚Äôs because we deserve it, for all the hard work.‚Äù The game against Colombia was an even contest right through the first half until Jraidi was fouled in the penalty area in the dying seconds before the break. Ghizlane Chebbak‚Äôs penalty attempt was saved, but Lahmari swooped on the rebound to put her team ahead of Colombia ‚Äî and, just as importantly, ahead of Germany in the standings. Colombia had its best scoring chance in the 59th minute, when 18-year-old Linda Caicedo served a ball to the far post, which Daniela Montoya one-timed to the left of goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi. The Moroccan ‚Äòkeeper made a reflex kick save, blocking the ball with just the front edge of her right cleat. In the 69th, Caicedo, after a long run, stopped and leaned on the field barrier, reaching down to her left ankle and foot. She appeared hobbled for several minutes but stayed in the match. WHY IT MATTERS Moroccan soccer fans have had plenty of celebrate with their national teams at the most recent World Cups. The Atlas Lionesses created history just by qualifying, and then just by scoring their first win. Beating Colombia to knock Germany out of the tournament was another level. Morocco‚Äôs men‚Äôs team also made World Cup history last year. In the 2022 men‚Äôs World Cup, the Atlas Lions advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1986 and became the first African or Arab nation to reach a World Cup semifinal. Colombia wins its group for the first time in team history and is in the knockout rounds for the first time since 2015. IN THEIR OWN WORDS Morocco‚Äôs fans ‚Äúare going to support us one more time. We love them, we cherish them, we feel they‚Äôre behind us. It gives us strength. Well done to all the girls and we‚Äôre continuing on our merry way.‚Äù ‚Äî Reynald Pedros, Morocco coach. ‚ÄúIt was an intense game and a very strategic game. We lost because of a mistake we made in the goal area, with the penalty.‚Äù ‚Äî Nelson Abad√≠a, Colombia coach.

The 34-year-old, formerly of Chelsea and Arsenal , penned a new one-year contract on July 17, ending speculation over his future. Mail Sport reported how, after his initial deal ran down , Willian held talks with Forest over a potential move and even visited their training ground. He ultimately snubbed the offer from Steve Cooper's side and decided to stay in west London after an impressive debut season at the club which saw him score five goals and register six assists in 27 Premier League appearances. However, according to The Telegraph , Willian is now being targeted by Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Shabab. Fulham winger Willian is wanted by Saudi Arabian side Al Shabab despite signing a new deal It provides a headache for Cottagers boss Marco Silva who has faced a summer of disruption The report states the suitors are planning to double his current salary, although no official offer has so far been forthcoming for the Brazilian winger. Fulham - who are hoping to build on last season's 10th place finish - would expect a transfer fee to be paid for Willian if he does depart Marco Silva's side. When he signed his new deal, Willian had outlined his delight at extending his stay for another season. He said: 'I am completely happy. Happy to sign one more year with Fulham. 'Happy to continue the work that I did last season with all my team-mates and the whole club. 'I think it‚Äôs a club that can do even better this season, so I‚Äôm happy to continue this amazing adventure.' The rise to prominence of the Saudi Pro League continues to provide a headache for Fulham with Silva rejecting a ¬£40m offer to take over at Al-Ahli this summer. Al-Shabab would double the Brazilian's wages, although Fulham are yet to receive an offer Aleksandar Mitrovic is also attracting interest from Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal keen on him Meanwhile, Al-Hilal - who Silva also rejected an offer from - are in for star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, but the Cottagers have already turned down several bids having slapped a ¬£52m price tag on his head. However, Mitrovic is desperate to make the move and did not feature in any of Fulham's pre-season games on their US tour. The club are keen to bring in further reinforcements this summer having only added Calvin Bassey from Ajax and Raul Jimenez from Wolves so far. Chelsea 's Callum Hudson-Odoi and Demarai Gray of Everton are among their targets ahead of starting the season away at the Toffees on August 12.

Germany‚Äôs 1-1 draw with the Koreans coupled with Morocco‚Äôs surprise 1-0 victory over Colombia saw the European side suffer their earliest exit in Women‚Äôs World Cup history. The two-time former champions and one of the pre-tournament favorites follow Brazil, Italy and Olympic champions Canada out of the competition in double-quick time. Colombia topped Group H despite losing and will face Jamaica in the last 16. Morocco progressed into the knockouts on their World Cup debut also with two wins and a defeat, and meet France next. Germany were third and condemned to an early flight home. ‚ÄúTo be honest, it‚Äôs still hard to understand,‚Äù skipper Alexandra Popp, who scored the German goal and was their chief threat throughout, told German TV network ZDF. ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt quite understand what happened here.‚Äù Coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg said that there was ‚Äúa lot of uncertainty today‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn the end you have to say that our performance was not enough.‚Äù The 2003 and 2007 winners Germany came into the game in front of just under 39,000 in Brisbane knowing that a win over South Korea would put them in the last 16. But they started badly, conceding to a smart Cho So-hyun finish after just six minutes and looking shaky at the back early on. Colin Bell‚Äôs South Korea looked nothing like the team that lost 2-0 to Colombia and 1-0 to Morocco. Germany equalized just before half-time with a Popp header but for all their possession, last year‚Äôs European finalists failed to get the second goal they desperately needed. Popp thought she had won it in the second half with another fierce header, but it was ruled out by VAR for off-side. Sydney Lohmann‚Äôs effort went just over deep in stoppage time and Germany now needed a favor from Colombia. A draw would have been enough for Germany had Morocco not sprung a surprise of their own in Perth. Anissa Lahmari‚Äôs goal in first-half stoppage time, after captain Ghizlane Chebbak‚Äôs penalty kick was spectacularly saved, won it for Morocco. With the Morocco game ending slightly before events in Brisbane, the Atlas Lionesses faced an anxious wait. When Germany‚Äôs fate was sealed the Moroccan players went wild on the pitch. The Koreans finished bottom of the group with one point but at least salvaged some pride. England now favorites? The United States are into the knockout rounds and a date with third-ranked Sweden on Sunday, but the Americans have looked nothing like a team capable of winning a third World Cup in a row. They scraped through with a 0-0 draw against tournament debutants Portugal, the Portuguese striking the post in injury time ‚Äì a goal would have sent the US home. European champions England now look the team to beat. They were touted before the tournament as the biggest threat to the United States and after an indifferent start, they thrashed China 6-1 to progress in style. Sarina Wiegman‚Äôs side face Nigeria, who along with South Africa, Jamaica and Morocco confounded expectations by getting out of the group stage. South Africa scored an injury-time winner to send Italy out on Wednesday, then that same evening Jamaica strangled Brazil 0-0 to end the South Americans‚Äô hopes. The knockout rounds begin on Saturday when an impressive Japan face Norway and Spain ‚Äì thrashed 4-0 by Japan last time out ‚Äì play Switzerland. ‚Äì AFP","pubDate":"2023-08-03 16:26:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","category":["sports"],"country":["kuwait"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Juventus 'identify Alvaro Morata as an alternative to Romelu Lukaku' - as Atletico Madrid striker 'gives green light to THIRD spell with Serie A giants'","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12369923/Juventus-identify-Alvaro-Morata-alternative-Romelu-Lukaku-Atletico-Madrid-striker-gives-green-light-spell-Serie-giants.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Romelu Lukaku remains the No 1 target for the Old Lady, Morata - who played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and then from 2020 to 2022 - has been identified as a viable alternative.","content":"Juventus 'identify Alvaro Morata as an alternative to Romelu Lukaku' - as Atletico Madrid striker 'gives green light to THIRD spell with Serie A giants' Alvaro Morata has reportedly emerged as an alternative target for Juventus The 30-year-old played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and from 2020 to 2022 Juventus had re-opened talks with Chelsea over a permanent transfer for Lukaku By Tum Balogun For Mailonline Updated: 17:16, 3 August 2023 e-mail View comments Alvaro Morata could be set for a third spell with Serie A giants Juventus after giving the green light to a move, according to reports in Italy. The Turin club have been working on a deal for Romelu Lukaku and had re-opened talks with Chelsea over a ¬£38.5m transfer that could see Dusan Vlahovic move in the opposite direction. But according to Calciomercato.com , although the Belgian remains the priority target for the Old Lady, Morata - who played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and then from 2020 to 2022 - has been identified as a viable alternative. Better still, Juventus have reportedly already obtained a 'yes' from the Atletico Madrid striker for another reunion. Morata has scored more goals for Juve than any other, netting 59 times in 185 appearances across two spells. The 30-year-old star claimed two Serie A titles during his first stint and was part of the squad, led by Massimiliano Allegri, that reached the final of the Champions League in 2015. Alvaro Morata has reportedly been identified as an alternative attacking recruit this summer Morata gave Juventus parity in the 2015 Champions League final before Barcelona won 3-1 Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri has managed the Spaniard for three seasons across two spells In Morata, Allegri knows he has a striker who can perform in his system, even if he is some years removed from his prime. Last season, the Spanish international could only manage 15 goals from 45 appearances for Atletico, who finished 11 points behind eventual La Liga winners Barcelona. Meanwhile, Juventus moving on to Morata would put Chelsea back at square one in terms of seeking an exit for Lukaku. The front man appears to have spurned the affection of fans and colleagues at Inter Milan on account of the transfer links to Juventus, and his parent-club have no interest in seeing him return. Mauricio Pochettino may be forced to try and re-integrate the 30-year-old into the fold if the Blues' attacking issues of last season persist into the new campaign.

Especially after a 6-0 loss to Germany in the opener. But a 1-0 victory over Colombia on Thursday propelled Morocco beyond the group stage ‚Äî a first for an Arab or North African nation. The team‚Äôs success is being talked about in the bustling cafes and restaurants of Rabat, where news of the victory was spreading. Hicham El Haddaoui, a waiter at Abtal Al Cham restaurant, spoke about his newfound appreciation for women‚Äôs soccer. ‚ÄúI was not used to watching Moroccan women‚Äôs football,‚Äù he said. However, the World Cup games have changed his perspective. News of the accomplishment went viral on social media, though word spread later in the day because many people were still at work ‚Äî if not on vacation. So there were no immediate widespread street celebrations or car honking taking place. Still, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. ‚ÄúThis achievement truly exemplifies the hard work and determination demonstrated by the Moroccan women‚Äôs team,‚Äù said Ibrahim Barakat, a 25-year-old student in Rabat. ‚ÄúDespite suffering a loss in the opening game, they showed their true character by not only taking part but also qualifying (for the next round).‚Äù While men‚Äôs soccer has long been the dominant sport in Morocco, reactions to the women‚Äôs team‚Äôs success have shown a remarkable shift. Even as the time difference has affected spectator interaction, the women‚Äôs team‚Äôs performance has sparked a surge of national pride and interest in women‚Äôs soccer. Thursdays Keep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter. This is not to say that the accomplishment has been universally celebrated. In some parts of the Arab world, the historical bias against women‚Äôs soccer remains prevalent, as evidenced by the limited media coverage and attention given to the team‚Äôs performance. Nonetheless, the team‚Äôs historic run has created interest and brought visibility to the women‚Äôs game in the country. This shift, although not seismic, marks a significant step forward for the sport in a region where it has traditionally been overshadowed by the men‚Äôs game. At the cafe in Sale, a suburb of the Moroccan capital of Rabat, Alaoui said the team‚Äôs resiliency has convinced her that they‚Äôre capable of ‚Äúeven more impressive feats in the matches to come.‚Äù ___ AP Women‚Äôs World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-08-03 17:22:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","category":["sports"],"country":["canada"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man United starlet Amad Diallo will NOT leave Old Trafford on loan - with suitors Leicester and Burnley no longer interested in the winger after he picked up an injury against Arsenal","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12370167/Amad-Diallo-MISS-start-Manchester-Uniteds-season-suffering-knee-injury-friendly-victory-Arsenal-blow-manager-Erik-ten-Hag.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Amad picked up the injury in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal in a pre-season friendly on July 23.

The Red Devils have confirmed that the winger will miss the start of the new Premier League campaign, which begins with a clash against Wolves at Old Trafford on August 14. Diallo, who prospered on loan at Sunderland last season, was set to undergo another loan spell this term, but interested clubs have now been put off a deal as a result of the injury. After revealing on Thursday that the 21-year-old starlet would not be fit for the 'first part' of the campaign, suitors Leicester, Burnley and Sheffield United are believed to have lost interest. United's statement read: 'Unfortunately, he (Amad) has been ruled out of the first part of the 2023-24 campaign, and we await further details on his estimated recovery date, with the home league clash against Wolverhampton Wanderers up first for Erik ten Hag's Reds on Monday 14 August.' Man United have confirmed Amad Diallo will miss the start of the new season through injury The 21-year-old winger picked up the injury in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal on July 23 ‚ÑπÔ∏è The young Red will be ruled out for the start of the new season. Wishing you a speedy recovery, @AmadDiallo_19 ! üôè #MUFC ‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) August 3, 2023 Amad picked up the injury during United's 2-0 victory over Arsenal on July 23 and will therefore miss this weekend's double-header against Lens and Athletic Club. Diallo was substituted off just 13 minutes after coming on, clutching his ankle in some pain. Under the escort of medics, he hobbled off the pitch before being substituted four minutes later. The sight of Diallo leaving on crutches undoubtedly marked a sour point for United, despite their triumphant 2-0 win. Facundo Pellistri was brought on for the former Black Cats star in front of a 82,262 crowd in New Jersey. The Ivorian (L) was tripped up by Gabriel Martinelli (R) during his 13-minute stint on the pitch In videos posted to social media, Diallo was seen to be transported elsewhere via a golf buggy. Leicester initially faced competition from Burnley and Sheffield United as well as other Premier League outfits. However, it now seems Diallo will begin the new campaign at Old Trafford - and will have to win Ten Hag's favour by breaking his way into the first team squad. Diallo flourished on loan at Sunderland last term, scoring 14 goals as the Black Cats made it to the Championship play-offs.

We were praying while we were watching the game,‚Äù said midfielder Anissa Lahmari, who scored Morocco‚Äôs winning goal in first-half stoppage time on Thursday. ‚ÄúAfterwards it was just a complete explosion of joy.‚Äù Cue celebrations, both in Morocco and other parts of the Arab world. In one of the most unexpected outcomes in the last days of the group stage, Morocco advanced to the knockout round in second place behind Colombia while No. 2-ranked Germany failed to advance for the first time at the tournament. Morocco is the first Arab or North African nation to qualify for the Women‚Äôs World Cup and now the first to advance beyond the group stage. That‚Äôs something none of the other seven tournament newcomers managed to do. And it all started with a thumping 6-0 loss to Germany. While the Moroccans recovered to win their next two games, Germany lost 2-1 to Colombia and then was held 1-1 by South Korea when it needed a win in Brisbane to avoid elimination. ‚ÄúWhen we had won the match, the most stressful thing was the other match,‚Äù Morocco coach Reynald Pedros said. The last two group games started at the same time on opposite sides of the Australian continent but stoppage time in Brisbane lasted longer. ‚ÄúWe waited, and then the good news arrived. It was incredible,‚Äù Pedros said. If Morocco‚Äôs qualification for the Women‚Äôs World Cup inspired a generation, this run to the knockout stage will cement a legacy for the Atlas Lionesses. The win over South Korea last weekend was historic for the team, for Ibtissam Jra√Ødi scoring the Morocco‚Äôs first World Cup goal, and for another significant milestone ‚Äî defender Nouhaila Benzina became the first player to wear a Hijab in a World Cup game at the senior level. ‚ÄúAfter the first match of the tournament, I think 98% of people thought it was over, apart from us,‚Äù Pedros said. ‚ÄúWe thought we could do something, because football is magic. ‚ÄúWe know that emotions and hard work can lead to good things. If we are at the next stage, it‚Äôs because we deserve it, for all the hard work.‚Äù The game against Colombia was an even contest right through the first half until Jraidi was fouled in the penalty area in the dying seconds before the break. Ghizlane Chebbak‚Äôs penalty attempt was saved, but Lahmari swooped on the rebound to put her team ahead of Colombia ‚Äî and, just as importantly, ahead of Germany in the standings. Colombia had its best scoring chance in the 59th minute, when 18-year-old Linda Caicedo served a ball to the far post, which Daniela Montoya one-timed to the left of goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi. The Moroccan ‚Äòkeeper made a reflex kick save, blocking the ball with just the front edge of her right cleat. In the 69th, Caicedo, after a long run, stopped and leaned on the field barrier, reaching down to her left ankle and foot. She appeared hobbled for several minutes but stayed in the match. WHY IT MATTERS Moroccan soccer fans have had plenty of celebrate with their national teams at the most recent World Cups. The Atlas Lionesses created history just by qualifying, and then just by scoring their first win. Beating Colombia to knock Germany out of the tournament was another level. Morocco‚Äôs men‚Äôs team also made World Cup history last year. In the 2022 men‚Äôs World Cup, the Atlas Lions advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1986 and became the first African or Arab nation to reach a World Cup semifinal. Colombia wins its group for the first time in team history and is in the knockout rounds for the first time since 2015. IN THEIR OWN WORDS Morocco‚Äôs fans ‚Äúare going to support us one more time. We love them, we cherish them, we feel they‚Äôre behind us. It gives us strength. Well done to all the girls and we‚Äôre continuing on our merry way.‚Äù ‚Äî Reynald Pedros, Morocco coach. ‚ÄúIt was an intense game and a very strategic game. We lost because of a mistake we made in the goal area, with the penalty.‚Äù ‚Äî Nelson Abad√≠a, Colombia coach. WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT Morocco, as the Group H runner-up, will play Group F winner France in Adelaide on Tuesday. Colombia will play Group F runner-up Jamaica the same day in Melbourne. ___ Anna Ruth Riggins contributed to this report from Sydney.

The 34-year-old, formerly of Chelsea and Arsenal , penned a new one-year contract on July 17, ending speculation over his future. Mail Sport reported how, after his initial deal ran down , Willian held talks with Forest over a potential move and even visited their training ground. He ultimately snubbed the offer from Steve Cooper's side and decided to stay in west London after an impressive debut season at the club which saw him score five goals and register six assists in 27 Premier League appearances. However, according to The Telegraph , Willian is now being targeted by Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Shabab. Fulham winger Willian is wanted by Saudi Arabian side Al Shabab despite signing a new deal It provides a headache for Cottagers boss Marco Silva who has faced a summer of disruption The report states the suitors are planning to double his current salary, although no official offer has so far been forthcoming for the Brazilian winger. Fulham - who are hoping to build on last season's 10th place finish - would expect a transfer fee to be paid for Willian if he does depart Marco Silva's side. When he signed his new deal, Willian had outlined his delight at extending his stay for another season. He said: 'I am completely happy. Happy to sign one more year with Fulham. 'Happy to continue the work that I did last season with all my team-mates and the whole club. 'I think it‚Äôs a club that can do even better this season, so I‚Äôm happy to continue this amazing adventure.' The rise to prominence of the Saudi Pro League continues to provide a headache for Fulham with Silva rejecting a ¬£40m offer to take over at Al-Ahli this summer. Al-Shabab would double the Brazilian's wages, although Fulham are yet to receive an offer Aleksandar Mitrovic is also attracting interest from Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal keen on him Meanwhile, Al-Hilal - who Silva also rejected an offer from - are in for star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, but the Cottagers have already turned down several bids having slapped a ¬£52m price tag on his head. However, Mitrovic is desperate to make the move and did not feature in any of Fulham's pre-season games on their US tour. The club are keen to bring in further reinforcements this summer having only added Calvin Bassey from Ajax and Raul Jimenez from Wolves so far. Chelsea 's Callum Hudson-Odoi and Demarai Gray of Everton are among their targets ahead of starting the season away at the Toffees on August 12.

Hosting the championship would bring economic benefits to Winnipeg, Manitoba Premier Heather Stefanson said Thursday. \"We know that this championship, as I understand, will attract more than 1,300 visitors to Manitoba with more than 10,000 spectators,\" Stefanson said at centre court of Canada Life Centre.

Germany‚Äôs 1-1 draw with the Koreans coupled with Morocco‚Äôs surprise 1-0 victory over Colombia saw the European side suffer their earliest exit in Women‚Äôs World Cup history. The two-time former champions and one of the pre-tournament favorites follow Brazil, Italy and Olympic champions Canada out of the competition in double-quick time. Colombia topped Group H despite losing and will face Jamaica in the last 16. Morocco progressed into the knockouts on their World Cup debut also with two wins and a defeat, and meet France next. Germany were third and condemned to an early flight home. ‚ÄúTo be honest, it‚Äôs still hard to understand,‚Äù skipper Alexandra Popp, who scored the German goal and was their chief threat throughout, told German TV network ZDF. ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt quite understand what happened here.‚Äù Coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg said that there was ‚Äúa lot of uncertainty today‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn the end you have to say that our performance was not enough.‚Äù The 2003 and 2007 winners Germany came into the game in front of just under 39,000 in Brisbane knowing that a win over South Korea would put them in the last 16. But they started badly, conceding to a smart Cho So-hyun finish after just six minutes and looking shaky at the back early on. Colin Bell‚Äôs South Korea looked nothing like the team that lost 2-0 to Colombia and 1-0 to Morocco. Germany equalized just before half-time with a Popp header but for all their possession, last year‚Äôs European finalists failed to get the second goal they desperately needed. Popp thought she had won it in the second half with another fierce header, but it was ruled out by VAR for off-side. Sydney Lohmann‚Äôs effort went just over deep in stoppage time and Germany now needed a favor from Colombia. A draw would have been enough for Germany had Morocco not sprung a surprise of their own in Perth. Anissa Lahmari‚Äôs goal in first-half stoppage time, after captain Ghizlane Chebbak‚Äôs penalty kick was spectacularly saved, won it for Morocco. With the Morocco game ending slightly before events in Brisbane, the Atlas Lionesses faced an anxious wait. When Germany‚Äôs fate was sealed the Moroccan players went wild on the pitch. The Koreans finished bottom of the group with one point but at least salvaged some pride. England now favorites? The United States are into the knockout rounds and a date with third-ranked Sweden on Sunday, but the Americans have looked nothing like a team capable of winning a third World Cup in a row. They scraped through with a 0-0 draw against tournament debutants Portugal, the Portuguese striking the post in injury time ‚Äì a goal would have sent the US home. European champions England now look the team to beat. They were touted before the tournament as the biggest threat to the United States and after an indifferent start, they thrashed China 6-1 to progress in style. Sarina Wiegman‚Äôs side face Nigeria, who along with South Africa, Jamaica and Morocco confounded expectations by getting out of the group stage. South Africa scored an injury-time winner to send Italy out on Wednesday, then that same evening Jamaica strangled Brazil 0-0 to end the South Americans‚Äô hopes. The knockout rounds begin on Saturday when an impressive Japan face Norway and Spain ‚Äì thrashed 4-0 by Japan last time out ‚Äì play Switzerland. ‚Äì AFP","pubDate":"2023-08-03 16:26:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","category":["sports"],"country":["kuwait"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Juventus 'identify Alvaro Morata as an alternative to Romelu Lukaku' - as Atletico Madrid striker 'gives green light to THIRD spell with Serie A giants'","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12369923/Juventus-identify-Alvaro-Morata-alternative-Romelu-Lukaku-Atletico-Madrid-striker-gives-green-light-spell-Serie-giants.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Romelu Lukaku remains the No 1 target for the Old Lady, Morata - who played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and then from 2020 to 2022 - has been identified as a viable alternative.","content":"Juventus 'identify Alvaro Morata as an alternative to Romelu Lukaku' - as Atletico Madrid striker 'gives green light to THIRD spell with Serie A giants' Alvaro Morata has reportedly emerged as an alternative target for Juventus The 30-year-old played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and from 2020 to 2022 Juventus had re-opened talks with Chelsea over a permanent transfer for Lukaku By Tum Balogun For Mailonline Updated: 17:16, 3 August 2023 e-mail View comments Alvaro Morata could be set for a third spell with Serie A giants Juventus after giving the green light to a move, according to reports in Italy. The Turin club have been working on a deal for Romelu Lukaku and had re-opened talks with Chelsea over a ¬£38.5m transfer that could see Dusan Vlahovic move in the opposite direction. But according to Calciomercato.com , although the Belgian remains the priority target for the Old Lady, Morata - who played for the club from 2014 to 2016 and then from 2020 to 2022 - has been identified as a viable alternative. Better still, Juventus have reportedly already obtained a 'yes' from the Atletico Madrid striker for another reunion. Morata has scored more goals for Juve than any other, netting 59 times in 185 appearances across two spells. The 30-year-old star claimed two Serie A titles during his first stint and was part of the squad, led by Massimiliano Allegri, that reached the final of the Champions League in 2015. Alvaro Morata has reportedly been identified as an alternative attacking recruit this summer Morata gave Juventus parity in the 2015 Champions League final before Barcelona won 3-1 Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri has managed the Spaniard for three seasons across two spells In Morata, Allegri knows he has a striker who can perform in his system, even if he is some years removed from his prime. Last season, the Spanish international could only manage 15 goals from 45 appearances for Atletico, who finished 11 points behind eventual La Liga winners Barcelona. Meanwhile, Juventus moving on to Morata would put Chelsea back at square one in terms of seeking an exit for Lukaku. The front man appears to have spurned the affection of fans and colleagues at Inter Milan on account of the transfer links to Juventus, and his parent-club have no interest in seeing him return. Mauricio Pochettino may be forced to try and re-integrate the 30-year-old into the fold if the Blues' attacking issues of last season persist into the new campaign.
