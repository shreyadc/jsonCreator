Furthermore, Laporte is believed to be open to the idea of moving to the Middle East, indicating that a deal is viable. Al-Nassr's move for Laporte is likely to have significant ramifications for Bailly, who had been touted as a potential signing for the club who acquired Cristiano Ronaldo back in December.

Furthermore, Laporte is believed to be open to the idea of moving to the Middle East, indicating that a deal is viable. Al-Nassr's move for Laporte is likely to have significant ramifications for Bailly, who had been touted as a potential signing for the club who acquired Cristiano Ronaldo back in December.

Greenwood, 21, hasn't played for United since he was arrested in January 2022. Charges of attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in February. United started conducting an internal investigation into the incident after Greenwood's criminal charges were dropped but are yet to make a decision on his future. The England forward still has two years left on his contract, with a club option of a further 12 months. United were initially expected to announce a decision on Greenwood's future ahead of the new Premier League season, but that has been delayed. The club's chief executive officer Richard Arnold will make the call, but he will still need co-chair Joel Glazer to sign it off.

And now we just need to make the decision. That decision is firmly a decision that's on us.\" United's head of fan engagement Rick McGagh added: \"It's not accurate to say we've had full consultation with the fan advisory board on what decision we're making. This is not a consultation.\" Greenwood hasn't played professional football for 20 months ( Image: Getty Images) Many fans don't want to see Greenwood represent their club due to the severity of the allegations. A protest against his return was staged outside of Old Trafford ahead of United's 1-0 Premier League victory against Wolves on Monday night. United's fan advisory board and women's team have been consulted, but the decision rests with Arnold. Several members of the women's team have been targeted on social media after reports of their involvement in the decision emerged. Reporters asked Erik ten Hag for his opinion on the matter during United's pre-season tour of the United States. The Dutchman said: \"Of course, I have said my ideas and opinions but it's a club decision. We all have to accept that.

Bailly, 29, is surplus to requirements at Manchester United and spent the whole of the 2022/23 campaign on loan in France with Marseille, but he failed to do enough to persuade the Ligue 1 outfit to make the move permanent. The Ivory Coast international is free to leave Old Trafford for good this summer and was seemingly lined up to be the next high-profile star to join the Saudi Pro League - but that move has now been scuppered by Al-Nassr's interest in Laporte.

Furthermore, Laporte is believed to be open to the idea of moving to the Middle East, indicating that a deal is viable. Al-Nassr's move for Laporte is likely to have significant ramifications for Bailly, who had been touted as a potential signing for the club who acquired Cristiano Ronaldo back in December. Sky Sports have since claimed that the defender will now consider his options after declining the opportunity to discuss a move to Besiktas, who had shown an interest in acquiring him.

Bailly spent last season on loan at Marseille and is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford ( Image: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images) The defender was not a part of the Manchester United squad which travelled to the United States on their pre-season tour after his season-long stint at Marseille was wrecked by injuries. Bailly managed just 17 appearances for the French giants and struggled to show the sort of form which convinced United to shell out a whopping £30million for his services back in 2016 during the early days of Jose Mourinho's Old Trafford reign. Bailly's current plight was met with sympathy by his old international manager, Patrick Beaumelle - but the former Ivory Coast boss admitted that the defender's career was effectively in tatters.
