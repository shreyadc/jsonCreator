Kulusevski, on loan at Tottenham from Juventus, made the comments about Republic of Ireland international right-back Doherty after the Premier League match against Liverpool at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium at the weekend. Both Kulusevski and Doherty – who cost Tottenham £14.7 million (The Guardian) when they signed him from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 – came on as substitutes in the second half in North London. Tottenham were 2-0 down to Liverpool in the first half. Egypt international forward Mohamed Salah scored both the goals for Liverpool. Harry Kane pulled one back for Tottenham after the break. Antonio Conte’s Tottenham played better in the second half and could have picked up a point from the encounter with the late chanced they had. Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images After the match, Kulusevski, who has established himself as one of the best and most important players at Tottenham, spoke highly of Doherty and underlined why he enjoys playing with the former Wolverhampton Wanderers star, who is operating as a right-back at Spurs. Dejan Kulusevski on Tottenham Hotspur teammate Matt Doherty Kulusevski said about Doherty: “It’s very easy to play with him. Also last year I played a lot with him and he’s a fantastic player, especially going forward. “We have fun, we enjoy and we will play in the future. I’m looking forward to playing with everybody. “It’s no training. It’s just sometimes you just feel good with some players, and I feel good with everybody. “I have to watch what they are good on and Matt likes to do small passes and do small movements, so I try to give him the ball and help him on the overlap.” The post ‘We have fun’: Kulusevski says he absolutely loves playing with £15m Tottenham player appeared first on HITC.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 08:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"hitc","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rugby-Hodgson to join England as defence coach, Seibold returning to NRL","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/rugby/2022/11/08/rugby-hodgson-to-join-england-as-defence-coach-seibold-returning-to-nrl","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - England have appointed Brett Hodgson as defence coach with the Australian set to start his new assignment following the ongoing Autumn Nations Series, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) announced on Tuesday.

Wubben-Moy said she would support the England men’s team in the tournament, which begins in less than two weeks’ time, but will keep her television turned off amid the controversy surrounding Qatar’s staging of the showpiece event. ‘It’s tough,’ the 23-year-old said. “As an England team we all have strong values. And a lot of those values aren’t reflected in the way that we see it in Qatar. I think it’s a tough conversation to have and there’s a lot of dialogue around it. ‘I personally will be supporting the men’s team, but I won’t be watching. I think it’s hard to talk about. But at the end of the day, we’re one team here at England and we know that they have an opportunity to play at a World Cup. It’s hard to look beyond that really.’ Last week, FIFA reportedly wrote to participating nations urging them to ‘focus on the football’ but the Football Association joined nine other national governing bodies from across Europe in responding over the weekend by saying they would advocate for human rights. And Wubben-Moy believes it is right that sport and politics are not separated. ‘Sport is a very strong vehicle for change,” she said. “To underestimate that would be naive, I think. I’ve seen a lot of the players have strong viewpoints and I salute them and I wish them the best in looking to express that throughout this World Cup.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4, the 27-year-old said: ‘It’s not something I will be backing or promoting. ‘It’s disappointing in the sense there’s no respect on a lot of levels, even though it’s a game of football.’ Qatar, which follows strict Muslim laws, has been criticised about its stance on same-sex relationships and human rights issues.’ Mead, player of the tournament and Golden Boot winner when England won the Euros this summer, added: ‘Although I’m cheering for the boys who are going to play football there, from the minute it was announced I thought it wasn’t the best idea.’ MORE : Brazil boss Tite explains Gabriel Martinelli World Cup call-up as Arsenal fans notice Neymar reaction MORE : Arsenal star Gabriel Magalhaes reacts to missing out on World Cup after Brazil snub For more stories like this, check our sport page.

The title-winner with Blackburn Rovers pointed out that Eddie Howe’s side aren’t in Europe and the big pockets of Newcastle also have the January transfer window to play with. Heading into the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where domestic football will take a break, Newcastle need to win their weekend game against Chelsea and they will be sitting third at Christmas. Photo by Serena Taylor/Newcastle United via Getty Images That’s some turnaround for the Magpies, who only 12 months ago, were sitting in the relegation zone and struggling to win a game of football, never mind challenge near the top. But that’s what happens when you have a change of ownership, manager and a wad of cash thrown at the squad, which has transformed the football club. Well, things can be taken a few more steps further forward during the winter transfer window, as Sherwood spoke about Newcastle’s title chances, as he told Premier League Productions (07/11/22 at 2:35 pm). “If it’s not Arsenal have we not got a title race,” asked Sherwood. “If it’s not Arsenal, who is it going to be?  “Because I think Newcastle would be the bigger shout. The reason why I say that, is not because they are in third position, of course, they are in third. “But there is no Champions League. No Europa League. They are going to strengthen. If they win this weekend, then they will be, at least third, going into Christmas. It’s an opportunity.” Photo by Chloe Knott – Danehouse/Getty Images HOW FAR SHOULD NEWCASTLE PIUSH IN JANUARY? On one hand, Arsenal have a team firing and producing the goods, from top to bottom, so how much of that do they need to disrupt? In truth, there aren’t many weak points, if any, of the team, so if anybody does come in, then they will be an initial back-up player. One area that could be improved is the bench, but once again, how much does a team need to spend during a January window to improve their bench? Either way, if the Magpies want to go crazy, then they know they can do it, but, like they have been doing, if they remain calculated, measured and calm, then perhaps it will suit them best.

The Red Devis are believed to be in the market for a striker with Cristiano Ronaldo possibly set to leave in January. United were linked with a transfer move for Choupo-Moting last week following his impressive form in Bundesliga. And now Sky Sports Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg claims United have submitted an inquiry for the forward. But the journalist adds that the former Stoke player will stay at Bayern and the German champions will open up contract talks with the striker after the World Cup. German outlet Bild report Choupo-Moting wants to pen one last lucrative contract while he remains at his peak. United will likely continue to monitor his situation with Choupo-Moting out of contract at the end of the season. Bayern are set to open talks over a new deal as the Cameroon international has hit terrific form this season. The 33-year-old has ten goals in 14 appearances in all competitions. And his five goals in eight league games means he averages a goal every 75 minutes in league competition.

Juventus were as low as eighth in Serie A midway through the weekend and United are monitoring Vlahovic in case he becomes available next summer if his side fail to qualify for European football. United were reported to be monitoring Vlahovic 12 months ago, The Mail reported. He was also a player the paper reported that Ralf Rangnick recommended to Manchester United last January. The club refused to sanction any incoming deals last January with an interim boss in charge – now United could get a second chance. There is good reason for United to be paying serious attention to Dusan Vlahovic, he’s a tremendous prospect who could be phenomenal under Erik ten Hag. Vlahovic is a powerhouse of a striker who embarrassed Axel Tuanzebe in the Coppa Italia last season, and has scored consistently whichever club he is at. He scored 21 goals for Fiorentina in 2020/21, and then struck 20 before moving to Juventus mid-season. This calendar year he has scored 16 times for his new club. This season he can boast six in 10 Serie A games. Vlahovic got the better of Cristiano Ronaldo in World Cup qualifiers between Serbia and Portugal, he has eight goals in 16 games for his country. At only 22-years-old, Vlahovic is an excellent prospect, a creditable alternative to Erling Haaland, who United could build their attack around. Erik ten Hag showed at Ajax that he likes his strikers to have a physical presence, with both Sebastien Haller and Brian Brobbey leading the line. Vlahovic has the same strength to his game, and a ruthless edge in front of goal. Juventus teammate Filip Kostic told Calciomercato earlier this summer, “He is the strongest striker in the league. I’m fortunate to be able to play alongside him.” United’s next move up front is a crucial one, with Cristiano Ronaldo 37 and out of contract next year, and injury prone Anthony Martial unreliable. Vlahovic is a player who really shouldn’t be available if Juventus are doing well. But if they continue to struggle, and United can pull off a swoop, then he would be a monstrous signing in this Red Devils team, surrounding pace and trickery in forward areas.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 07:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"unitedinfocus","country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsenal news LIVE: Arteta ‘wants’ Tielemans, Gunners to ‘battle’ Spurs for David, Martinelli and Jesus make Brazil squad","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20331408/arsenal-news-live-arteta-tielemans-spurs-david-martinelli-jesus-world-cup/","keywords":["Football","Premier League","Sport","Sport Live Blogs"],"creator":["Kealan Hughes"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"ARSENAL boss Mikel Arteta has reportedly revived his interest in Belgian ace Youri Tielemans.

It has also been suggested that Arsenal want to sign Lille striker Jonathan David but they face a fight against bitter rivals Tottenham for his services. And the Gunners' attacking duo Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus have both been called up to the Brazilian national squad for the World Cup. But their defensive teammate Gabriel Magalhaes will sit this one out with Tite opting to go with a more experienced back-line instead. HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL Follow ALL of the latest updates below... Two Gunners stars have been given the nod for Brazil’s World Cup squad. But there was heartache as a third Emirates Samba star was brutally axed. Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli are both on their way to Qatar 2022 this month. However, Gabriel Magalhaes misses out despite being a rock at the back this season. Meanwhile, Oleksandr Zinchenko admits everyone at Arsenal is dreaming of a first title since the Invincibles in 2004. He said: “There is always some space to improve but we are in the right way as a team, as a family. “It starts in the dressing room and it’s on the pitch as well. “We are trying to push each other, we are trying to help each other. This is the right way to do it. “Still we have a dream, we believe that we can achieve something this season.” Finally, Arsenal fans had little time for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the weekend. That’s after singing a very rude song at their former captain. The now-Chelsea striker had a day to forget as his side suffered a 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. And after Auba’s fight with Mikel Arteta last year, Arsenal fans yelled: “Mikel Arteta, he thinks that you’re sh*t!” Arsenal are keen on signing Lille star Jonathan David. But they face a fight against rivals Spurs for the striker. GiveMeSport claims the duo are eager to bring David to England. But any interested parties must bid £40million before opening talks with the player. Mikel Arteta has reportedly told Arsenal chiefs to sign Youri Tielemans in January. The Leicester star is out of contract next summer. And Arteta believes he can play a key role for Arsenal in their bid for top spot. But it's reckoned another English club are also in for Tielemans, as well as two Italians sides. Oleksandr Zinchenko admits everyone at Arsenal is dreaming of a first title since the Invincibles in 2004. He said: “There is always some space to improve but we are in the right way as a team, as a family. “It starts in the dressing room and it’s on the pitch as well. “We are trying to push each other, we are trying to help each other. This is the right way to do it. “Still we have a dream, we believe that we can achieve something this season.” Emmanuel Petit has warned Arsenal they will finish second to Man City in the title race. He told Lord Ping : “Chelsea need a reaction, they have to get points if they want to finish in the top four. “The competition will be fierce and Chelsea are far away. It doesn’t matter how they win points, they just need to win. “For me, Man City will win the Premier League title, Arsenal will finish second, Liverpool will finish third and I think Newcastle will beat Tottenham, Chelsea and Man United to the fourth spot.” Arsenal need to UPGRADE on Gabriel Jesus as he’s not a match winner - according to ex-Gooner Emmanuel Petit. He told Lord Ping : “ I’ve been very pleased with the way that Arsenal have been playing since the beginning of the season. “They deserved to win against Chelsea but I still believe there's a gap between them and Man City because of two things; the depth of the squad, you can't compare the quality of the bench between either side. “Secondly, Man City signed Erling Haaland to fill a void and if you compare him with Gabriel Jesus, I really like Jesus but he's not a match-winner and Haaland is. “You can see that when he came off the bench against Fulham, he made a big difference in the game and that's the difference. “No one knows what Arsenal are going to do in the next transfer window, but they need to add quality players to the squad.” Arsenal fans had little time for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the weekend. That's by singing a very rude song at their former captain. The now-Chelsea striker had a day to forget as his side suffered a 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. And after Auba's fight with Mikel Arteta last year, Arsenal fans yelled: \"Mikel Arteta, he thinks that you’re sh*t!\" Man Utd legend Gary Neville insists he still has doubts over Arsenal’s title credentials. He said: \"We have to question them… because they haven't proven it yet. It's like a boxer that hasn't won a world title, or a national title. \"We've seen over the last few years - this Arsenal group of players have found it more difficult in the last part of season. “It's not overly negative. Let's see what happens in 20 games' time.” Gabriel Magalhas has been axed from Brazil’s squad for Qatar 2022. But teammate Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus have been summoned for this month’s tournament. Elsewhere, Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino has also been left out. But numerous other Prem stars like Man Utd’s Casemiro and Chelsea’s Thiago Silva have made the cut.

He has all the qualities to do the same as John Terry. \"He's very mature, came back to Arsenal with a lot of motivation and he's improved a lot as a human being as well as a footballer. \"Saliba was a rock against Chelsea, I wouldn't like to be a striker playing against him because he's tough and his confidence is really entering his game.\" Arsenal will hold a warm weather camp in Dubai next month. The Athletic claims Mikel Arteta will whisk stars away to the Middle East next month after going top of the Premier League. Several players will not be featuring at the World Cup. And Arsenal will also organise several friendlies to keep fitness levels going. Former Arsenal goalie Petr Cech has signed for ice hockey side Chelmsford Chieftains.

SEE ARSENAL TV INFO HERE Ex-Arsenal wonderkid Omari Hutchinson could be set for his Chelsea debut on Wednesday after being told not to report for international duty with Jamaica. The 19-year-old forward is very highly rated and has even been compared to Raheem Sterling. He hit the headlines last month after scoring a brilliant solo goal to help the Under-21s beat Leyton Orient 3-2. Now Chelsea supporters could get a chance to see him in first-team action in the Carabao Cup clash with Manchester City on November 9. Arsenal could sit back and relax as Man Utd drew a nightmare tie against Barcelona in the Europa League round of 32 play-off. Based on this draw Arsenal would have played against Sevilla due to PSV - the runners-up in the Gunners group - drawing them. You can see the full draw below. Arsenal stars Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Magalhaes are set to miss the cut for Brazil's World Cup squad. Journalist has reported Bruno Andrade has reported the full list of names who will be involved, and missed out the two Arsenal stars. However, Arsenal ace Gabriel Jesus has reportedly made the cut. See full list below Arsenal's rivals have been waiting to find out who they will face the in Champions League round of 16, and there have been some tasty ties cooked up. Here are who the English teams have been drawn against: RB Leipzig v Man City Liverpool v Real Madrid AC Milan v Tottenham Borussia Dortmund v Chelsea Other draws: Club Brugge v Benfica Frankfurt v Napoli Inter Milan v FC Porto PSG v Bayern Munich Full draw here Gary Neville has admitted that he would have played for arch-rivals Arsenal if Manchester United decided to sell him. The former defender, 47, spent his entire career at Old Trafford after coming through the academy as part of the Class of ’92 before making 602 first-team appearances. Speaking to Sky Sports’ Off Script, the pundit revealed there were four teams he willingly could have joined should he have been let go – and three he would never, ever have signed for. He said: I’d made the decision quite early in my 30s that if Sir Alex had come and told me my time was up, I wouldn’t have played for anyone else. I was fortunate in that sense. “However, if he’d (Sir Alex Ferguson) come to me at say the age of 28, and told me my time was up, of course I would have played for another Premier League club. “Who would I have played for? You can rule out three: I’d have never have played for [Man] City, Liverpool or Leeds. Not in a million years. “If you’d said to me, in a perfect world, in my years of playing, which clubs in the Premier League have the tradition, a proper club? Arsenal would be No 1. “The tradition of Highbury, I felt they did things the right way. Also in the Premier League, I like Aston Villa and Newcastle. “In Europe I admired Juventus and Bayern Munich. I respected them as football clubs. Bayern were meticulous in their preparation, so internationally, it would be them.” Tottenham are rivalling Arsenal in the transfer chase for Canada forward Jonathan David. According to GiveMeSport , David is in line for a move away from Ligue 1 outfit Lille having been linked to the likes of Everton and Manchester United on top of the North London pair. But any fee for him will see the buying club need to cough up at least £40million. Arsenal will find who their rivals will face in the Europa League last-16 later today. The Gunners progressed through their group with flying colours to avoid the dreaded round of 32 play-off against the third-place teams from the Champions League. And now they will find out the fate of their rivals when the draw kicks off at 12pm. You will be able to follow the draw live on SunSport here . Arsenal's draw for the round of 16 does not take place until late February. However, this will come after the Champions League draw commences an hour earlier. Match-winner Gabriel brutally trolled former captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after Arsenal's 1-0 win against Chelsea. Prior to his reunion against Arsenal Aubameyang had declared : \"Arsenal, nothing personal. I’m back. I’m blue. I’m ready. Let's go.\" But after celebrating his goal right in front of his former team-mate, Gabriel wrote on Twitter: \"NOTHING PERSONAL .. LONDON IS RED.\" Gabriel Magalhaes is set to suffer World Cup heartbreak for Brazil after a number of reports in his homeland claimed that the uncapped Arsenal star will be left disappointed. Samba Boys boss Tite is due to name his selection for the tournament later today. But Gabriel is “practically out of the equation” and will not be part of Brazil’s 26-man World Cup squad, according to journalist @brunoandrd. The news will come as a bitter blow for Gabriel, who has been capped at U20 and U23 level for his nation and is in great form for his club. Arsenal fans revelled in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's misery after the striker had a shocker against the Gunners. The former Arsenal captain turned Chelsea star managed just EIGHT touches of the ball before he was hooked in Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Mikel Arteta's side. Aubameyang was then spotted sitting on the bench looking miserable. And Arsenal fans were quick to throw the comment back in Aubameyang's face following the full-time whistle. One wrote on Twitter: \"@Auba it's football, nothing personal...\" Another said: \"Nothing personal. Still top of the league!\" And a third chimed: \"Nothing personal indeed @Auba.\" Arsenal are set to announce the dates for a pair of friendly games they will play during the World Cup. With a big gap between competitive fixtures due to the World Cup, Arsenal have been making plans to fill the void with productive means. And according to The Athletic's David Ornstein, they are set to announce friendlies against Lyon and AC Milan. The report indicates the game against Lyon will take place on December 8 while the Milan match will occur five days later. Mikel Arteta and his remaining stars will travel to Dubai for a warm-weather training camp on December 4. Arsenal remain interested in Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhaylo Mudryk, according to Fabrizio Romano. In his column for CaughtOffside, Romano said: “For sure Arsenal remain interested, they are following him for a long time but there’s still nothing decided.” “Shakhtar Donetsk want more than €60-65million (£53m-57m) to sell him now and it’s not easy. The race is open, if Arsenal really want him they have to move fast.”","pubDate":"2022-11-08 07:28:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CIES: Najdrożsi piłkarze spoza topowych lig","link":"https://transfery.info/aktualnosci/cies-najdrozsi-pilkarze-spoza-topowych-lig/175404","keywords":null,"creator":["Norbert Bożejewicz"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Enzo Fernández z Benfiki znalazł się na czele zestawienia CIES Football Observatory odnośnie najbardziej wartościowych graczy spoza topowych lig.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 07:20:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"transfery","country":["poland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"polish"},{"title":"Kalvin Phillips tells Gareth Southgate he is FULLY FIT and ready for World Cup with Man City star to return vs Chelsea","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/9694096/phillips-southgate-world-cup-man-city/","keywords":["Football","Sport","World Cup 2022","Premier League"],"creator":["Will Pugh"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"KALVIN PHILLIPS told Gareth Southgate he is fully fit and desperate to make England’s World Cup squad.

Speaking to the press via Football London during a press conference to confirm Japan’s squad for Qatar, the 54-year-old coach announced that Tomiyasu will recover in time to feature for the Asian powerhouses at the World Cup, with Tomiyasu expected to miss Arsenal’s last two games before the winter break. The 23-year-old fullback came off last week in Arsenal’s 1-0 win against FC Zurich in the UEFA Europa League after feeling something shortly after coming on as a substitute. However, Tomiyasu is on course to be fit for Japan for the World Cup following this latest injury update from Moriyasu. The Japan manager said when asked about Tomiyasu’s latest fitness concerns ahead of the World Cup: “I’ve been told that he can return to work before the start of the World Cup, that he will recover without giving up & face it in good condition.” Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images Signed from Bologna last year for nearly £20m, Tomiyasu has been one of Arsenal’s most important players over the last 12 months with the Japanese international thriving at both right-back and left-back for the Gunners, with the defender proving to be one of Mikel Arteta’s most versatile players in the entire squad. Whilst injury problems have been a concern for the 23-year-old, Tomiyasu’s performances have made the defender a favourite at the Emirates Stadium. And for Japan, having the former Serie A star fully fit for the World Cup is a huge boost for the Samuari’s bid to make history out on Qatar. Tomiyasu injury update is massive for Japan and Arsenal Photo by Koji Watanabe/Getty Images Japan head to Qatar as one of the underdogs of the competition, with Moriyasu’s side hopeful of a World Cup-best finish with arguably one of their strongest sides in recent memory. And Tomiyasu being fit for the competition is huge for the Asian nation and Arsenal. After all, Tomiyasu is expected to be a regular for a Japan side looking to progress past the group stages, and for the Gunners, the defender having a strong and healthy competition will be ideal as Arsenal look to have all their players match fit ahead of the Boxing Day Premier League return against West Ham.

The midfielder has scored some spectacular goals this season and tried to add another wondergoal to his showreel at the Estadio de Vallecas. A Real Madrid corner was flicked on and began to bounce away from goal when Valverde unleashed a wicked strike on the run. But he put way too much power into his out-of-control effort and the ball looped miles over the bar. And since there is only a block of flats behind the goal rather than a stand, the ball ended up on a fans' balcony, sparking huge cheers and laughter from the home fans. The three spectators watching on got a bit of a surprise and one supporter could be seen holding the ball. But rather than try to return to ball to the ground the group of fans decided to keep it as a memento. Valverde's 90th-minute strike summed up Real's performance as Carlo Ancelotti's side suffered their first league defeat of the season. Los Blancos responded to an early Vallecano opener to lead 2-1 but were pegged back on the stroke of half-time. Oscar Trejo put his side 3-2 up midway through the second half and left Real looking for a moment of magic from one of their star players.

The result means Real lose ground in the title race to rivals Barcelona , who now lead LaLiga with a two-point advantage.","pubDate":"2022-11-08 06:43:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cancer stricken boxing legend's devastating update","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/combat-sports/boxing-news-2022-billy-dib-diagnosed-with-rare-cancer-set-for-chemotherapy/a09beb4d-be2a-4ce7-b68b-3cce1cc14d53","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"F﻿ormer IBF and IBO super featherweight champion Billy Dib is preparing for the most important fight of his life.","content":"A﻿ustralian boxing legend Billy Dib has opened up on his ongoing cancer battle, calling it \"the hardest opponent I've faced\".
