Benitez has managed the likes of CR7, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos at Real Madrid while also coaching Samuel Eto'o at Inter Milan and Eden Hazard at Chelsea, but another was dubbed the best. The Spaniard did not think about his answer, immediately replying with Steven Gerrard's name. Benitez managed the Liverpool legend during his six-year stay at Anfield. The club won the Champions League in 2005 and the FA Cup in 2006 while the duo were working together. Gerrard played 292 times under Benitez, scoring 104 goals for Liverpool. Speaking last year, Benitez again named the midfielder ahead of other stars that were his favourites. He said: \"Gerrard was the best player I ever coached. \"He was a great, great player, fantastic player and he's a young manager now. BETTING SPECIAL - BEST FOOTBALL BETTING SITES IN THE UK \"What I would say to him now is to listen and try to learn from anyone.\" Gerrard, like Benitez, is currently out of management after his sacking from Aston Villa .

Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg on Thursday at the Santiago Bernabeu, but were criticised for only having 34 percent possession. Xavi said the demands on his team to play good football as well as winning games and lifting trophies meant his job was trickier than any other in the game. ‚ÄúYou beat Real Madrid 1-0 and it seems that it‚Äôs not convincing enough, whereas if it was the reverse there would be a national party,‚Äù Xavi told reporters. ‚ÄúSo it is the hardest club in the world. Now you believe me? I said it last year and got bashed for it. ‚ÄúAt Barcelona, you have to win and convince, to have 70 per cent of possession and create 16 chances while the opponent makes three. ‚ÄúThat is the objective, and that is our objective, but you have to understand that there is an opponent who is the reigning La Liga and European champions, and we‚Äôre competing with them.‚Äù Xavi said it was ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù to criticise Barcelona for not keeping the ball when they faced a Madrid side pressing them high up the pitch.

Arjan de Zeeuw, 43, has settled down in his native Netherlands after a successful playing career and taken on a new role as a detective specialising in forensics. The ex-footie star ran out for teams including Wigan Athletic and Portsmouth in his day, but has gone from chasing down breakaway strikers to pursuing criminals as the long arm of the law. He made over 500 appearances for five different English clubs across his stellar 17-year career from 1995 to 2008. He retired in 2009 after a season playing for Dutch side ADO'20. However, before starting his playing career, he completed a degree in medical science, which he is known putting to use in his investigative work. In 2014, he told BBC Sport : \"I was looking at something else other than football. \"I've been in football that long and I thought I just need to look at the world a bit more. \"So I tried to get back into my medical studies and I bumped into a friend of mine who was a detective in Alkmaar, where we are now.\" On his decision to enter the police force, he added: \"I liked the idea of justice and trying to make the world a better place for everybody, a fairer place. \"I'm going to specialise a bit more into forensics. More than likely it will be bigger investigations.\" He then recalled his training, including learning how to fire a gun and interrogate people. Arjan continued: \"It's challenging. The good thing is it's like football, it's still very much a team effort. \"You'll hardly ever solve a crime on your own.\" However, despite leaving the beautiful game behind as a career, he's still joined up with the force's team, who he generously described as \"energetic\". He joked: \"You have to be careful for your legs with these.\" On top of that, he plays for the police's national team, who qualified for the European final that year. Discussing how his footie skills have kept up, he chuckled: \"I'm lacking a bit of speed and a little bit of touch, but the competitive edge is still there.\" It's possible he was just being modest though as he recalled how his training came in handy when chasing down a suspect, as he outlasted him for stamina and made the arrest. He laughed: \"I had enough pace to keep up.\"","pubDate":"2023-03-04 13:45:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How many games do players miss for red card in Premier League and Champions League?","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/963754/red-card-how-many-games-premier-league-champions/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Explainers","Sport Evergreen"],"creator":["sunsportonline"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"EVERYBODY knows when a player receives a red card, they will need to serve a suspension. However, some people aren't too clued up on how many games the player will miss - especially with so many different competitions around these days. Here's all you need to know about suspension rules... If a player is sent off for a professional foul (eg holding an opponent back when they're through on goal) or a second bookable offence they will be handed a one-match ban. Straight red cards for dissent will result in a two-match ban, while dangerous tackles or violent conduct will result in a three-match ban which can be raised to four or more games in extreme cases. Incidents of racism will almost certainly result in a ban longer than three games while a red card for spitting triggers an automatic six-match ban. Players who have been sent off will also be banned for a further match if they refuse to leave the pitch within a reasonable time period after receiving a red card. In the Champions League and Europa League, players will miss one match if they are sent off. Players will receive a one-match ban if they receive five yellow cards in domestic competitions. A player who receives ten yellow cards will get a two-match ban and a player with 15 yellow cards will get a three-match ban. In the unlikely event that a player receives 20 yellow cards, they will suffer the humiliation of being forced to attend a special hearing at the FA to discuss their conduct. In the Champions League and Europa League players will be banned for receiving three yellow cards. Premier League yellow cards are wiped on December 31, while the EFL wipes yellow cards on November 30. That means any player who receives five yellow cards will not be banned. However, cards aren't wiped entirely as any player who obtains ten yellow cards after New Year will still get a two-match ban. In European and international competitions, yellow cards are wiped after the quarter-finals. Premier League top scorers 2022/23 : Who is leading the Golden Boot race?

A straight red card can be overturned if an appeal is lodged with the FA and a panel decides the referee got the decision wrong. In the event of a successful appeal, the suspension will be cancelled. But if the FA rule a club has lodged a 'frivolous' appeal, a three-game ban can be increased to four. Appeals can't be lodged in the event of a second yellow card, apart from in cases of mistaken identity. Club red cards are completely separate from international red cards. No cards received at club level will result in an international ban and vice-versa. However, Fifa does have the power to enforce a global ban.

Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg on Thursday at the Santiago Bernabeu, but were criticised for only having 34 percent possession. Xavi said the demands on his team to play good football as well as winning games and lifting trophies meant his job was trickier than any other in the game. ‚ÄúYou beat Real Madrid 1-0 and it seems that it‚Äôs not convincing enough, whereas if it was the reverse there would be a national party,‚Äù Xavi told reporters. ‚ÄúSo it is the hardest club in the world. Now you believe me? I said it last year and got bashed for it. ‚ÄúAt Barcelona, you have to win and convince, to have 70 per cent of possession and create 16 chances while the opponent makes three. ‚ÄúThat is the objective, and that is our objective, but you have to understand that there is an opponent who is the reigning La Liga and European champions, and we‚Äôre competing with them.‚Äù Xavi said it was ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù to criticise Barcelona for not keeping the ball when they faced a Madrid side pressing them high up the pitch.

Arjan de Zeeuw, 43, has settled down in his native Netherlands after a successful playing career and taken on a new role as a detective specialising in forensics. The ex-footie star ran out for teams including Wigan Athletic and Portsmouth in his day, but has gone from chasing down breakaway strikers to pursuing criminals as the long arm of the law. He made over 500 appearances for five different English clubs across his stellar 17-year career from 1995 to 2008. He retired in 2009 after a season playing for Dutch side ADO'20. However, before starting his playing career, he completed a degree in medical science, which he is known putting to use in his investigative work. In 2014, he told BBC Sport : \"I was looking at something else other than football. \"I've been in football that long and I thought I just need to look at the world a bit more. \"So I tried to get back into my medical studies and I bumped into a friend of mine who was a detective in Alkmaar, where we are now.\" On his decision to enter the police force, he added: \"I liked the idea of justice and trying to make the world a better place for everybody, a fairer place. \"I'm going to specialise a bit more into forensics. More than likely it will be bigger investigations.\" He then recalled his training, including learning how to fire a gun and interrogate people. Arjan continued: \"It's challenging. The good thing is it's like football, it's still very much a team effort. \"You'll hardly ever solve a crime on your own.\" However, despite leaving the beautiful game behind as a career, he's still joined up with the force's team, who he generously described as \"energetic\". He joked: \"You have to be careful for your legs with these.\" On top of that, he plays for the police's national team, who qualified for the European final that year. Discussing how his footie skills have kept up, he chuckled: \"I'm lacking a bit of speed and a little bit of touch, but the competitive edge is still there.\" It's possible he was just being modest though as he recalled how his training came in handy when chasing down a suspect, as he outlasted him for stamina and made the arrest.

However, some people aren't too clued up on how many games the player will miss - especially with so many different competitions around these days. Here's all you need to know about suspension rules... If a player is sent off for a professional foul (eg holding an opponent back when they're through on goal) or a second bookable offence they will be handed a one-match ban. Straight red cards for dissent will result in a two-match ban, while dangerous tackles or violent conduct will result in a three-match ban which can be raised to four or more games in extreme cases. Incidents of racism will almost certainly result in a ban longer than three games while a red card for spitting triggers an automatic six-match ban. Players who have been sent off will also be banned for a further match if they refuse to leave the pitch within a reasonable time period after receiving a red card. In the Champions League and Europa League, players will miss one match if they are sent off. Players will receive a one-match ban if they receive five yellow cards in domestic competitions. A player who receives ten yellow cards will get a two-match ban and a player with 15 yellow cards will get a three-match ban. In the unlikely event that a player receives 20 yellow cards, they will suffer the humiliation of being forced to attend a special hearing at the FA to discuss their conduct. In the Champions League and Europa League players will be banned for receiving three yellow cards. Premier League yellow cards are wiped on December 31, while the EFL wipes yellow cards on November 30. That means any player who receives five yellow cards will not be banned. However, cards aren't wiped entirely as any player who obtains ten yellow cards after New Year will still get a two-match ban. In European and international competitions, yellow cards are wiped after the quarter-finals. Premier League top scorers 2022/23 : Who is leading the Golden Boot race? Premier League owners - Who are the richest? What is the TV football blackout law in the UK? Premier League prize money : How much can each term earn? What happens if a manager gets booked or sent off ? How much do Premier League referees get paid ? How many substitutions can Premier League teams make this season and how do the intervals work? What is the offside rule in football, and how to explain it? How will VAR work in the Premier League this season? Why aren‚Äôt Premier League players taking the knee every weekend? A straight red card can be overturned if an appeal is lodged with the FA and a panel decides the referee got the decision wrong. In the event of a successful appeal, the suspension will be cancelled. But if the FA rule a club has lodged a 'frivolous' appeal, a three-game ban can be increased to four. Appeals can't be lodged in the event of a second yellow card, apart from in cases of mistaken identity. Club red cards are completely separate from international red cards. No cards received at club level will result in an international ban and vice-versa. However, Fifa does have the power to enforce a global ban.

Xavi said the demands on his team to play good football as well as winning games and lifting trophies meant his job was trickier than any other in the game. ‚ÄúYou beat Real Madrid 1-0 and it seems that it‚Äôs not convincing enough, whereas if it was the reverse there would be a national party,‚Äù Xavi told reporters. ‚ÄúSo it is the hardest club in the world. Now you believe me? I said it last year and got bashed for it. ‚ÄúAt Barcelona, you have to win and convince, to have 70 per cent of possession and create 16 chances while the opponent makes three. ‚ÄúThat is the objective, and that is our objective, but you have to understand that there is an opponent who is the reigning La Liga and European champions, and we‚Äôre competing with them.‚Äù Xavi said it was ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù to criticise Barcelona for not keeping the ball when they faced a Madrid side pressing them high up the pitch.

On Sunday Barcelona face Valencia in La Liga, where they have the chance to move 10 points clear before Real Madrid face Real Betis. Last weekend Barcelona missed a chance to extend their advantage as they lost 1-0 at Almeria. Valencia, 18th, recently appointed Ruben Baraja as coach and they beat Real Sociedad 1-0 last weekend to bolster their bid to escape relegation. ‚ÄúThey defend well with Baraja, they are more aggressive, generous in their defensive work, very fast,‚Äù said Xavi. ‚ÄúWe come from the Almeria defeat, we have to change the mindset from the cup. We want three points but the opponent arrives in need too, they have a lot on the line.‚Äù AFP","pubDate":"2023-03-04 14:00:21","image_url":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/29145416/Xavi-Hernandez.jpg","source_id":"punchng","category":["sports"],"country":["nigeria"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I‚Äôm a former Premier League defender but now I‚Äôm a COP ‚Äì I spend my days solving crimes & catching crooks","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/10326279/former-premier-league-defender-cop/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Premier League"],"creator":["Jacob Jaffa"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"A FORMER Premier League defender has revealed that he is spending his days solving crimes and catching crooks in his new job as a cop. Arjan de Zeeuw, 43, has settled down in his native Netherlands after a successful playing career and taken on a new role as a detective specialising in forensics. The ex-footie star ran out for teams including Wigan Athletic and Portsmouth in his day, but has gone from chasing down breakaway strikers to pursuing criminals as the long arm of the law. He made over 500 appearances for five different English clubs across his stellar 17-year career from 1995 to 2008. He retired in 2009 after a season playing for Dutch side ADO'20. However, before starting his playing career, he completed a degree in medical science, which he is known putting to use in his investigative work. In 2014, he told BBC Sport : \"I was looking at something else other than football. \"I've been in football that long and I thought I just need to look at the world a bit more. \"So I tried to get back into my medical studies and I bumped into a friend of mine who was a detective in Alkmaar, where we are now.\" On his decision to enter the police force, he added: \"I liked the idea of justice and trying to make the world a better place for everybody, a fairer place. \"I'm going to specialise a bit more into forensics. More than likely it will be bigger investigations.\" He then recalled his training, including learning how to fire a gun and interrogate people. Arjan continued: \"It's challenging. The good thing is it's like football, it's still very much a team effort. \"You'll hardly ever solve a crime on your own.\" However, despite leaving the beautiful game behind as a career, he's still joined up with the force's team, who he generously described as \"energetic\". He joked: \"You have to be careful for your legs with these.\" On top of that, he plays for the police's national team, who qualified for the European final that year. Discussing how his footie skills have kept up, he chuckled: \"I'm lacking a bit of speed and a little bit of touch, but the competitive edge is still there.\" It's possible he was just being modest though as he recalled how his training came in handy when chasing down a suspect, as he outlasted him for stamina and made the arrest. He laughed: \"I had enough pace to keep up.\"","pubDate":"2023-03-04 13:45:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How many games do players miss for red card in Premier League and Champions League?","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/963754/red-card-how-many-games-premier-league-champions/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Explainers","Sport Evergreen"],"creator":["sunsportonline"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"EVERYBODY knows when a player receives a red card, they will need to serve a suspension. However, some people aren't too clued up on how many games the player will miss - especially with so many different competitions around these days. Here's all you need to know about suspension rules... If a player is sent off for a professional foul (eg holding an opponent back when they're through on goal) or a second bookable offence they will be handed a one-match ban. Straight red cards for dissent will result in a two-match ban, while dangerous tackles or violent conduct will result in a three-match ban which can be raised to four or more games in extreme cases. Incidents of racism will almost certainly result in a ban longer than three games while a red card for spitting triggers an automatic six-match ban. Players who have been sent off will also be banned for a further match if they refuse to leave the pitch within a reasonable time period after receiving a red card. In the Champions League and Europa League, players will miss one match if they are sent off. Players will receive a one-match ban if they receive five yellow cards in domestic competitions. A player who receives ten yellow cards will get a two-match ban and a player with 15 yellow cards will get a three-match ban. In the unlikely event that a player receives 20 yellow cards, they will suffer the humiliation of being forced to attend a special hearing at the FA to discuss their conduct. In the Champions League and Europa League players will be banned for receiving three yellow cards. Premier League yellow cards are wiped on December 31, while the EFL wipes yellow cards on November 30. That means any player who receives five yellow cards will not be banned. However, cards aren't wiped entirely as any player who obtains ten yellow cards after New Year will still get a two-match ban. In European and international competitions, yellow cards are wiped after the quarter-finals. Premier League top scorers 2022/23 : Who is leading the Golden Boot race?

A straight red card can be overturned if an appeal is lodged with the FA and a panel decides the referee got the decision wrong. In the event of a successful appeal, the suspension will be cancelled. But if the FA rule a club has lodged a 'frivolous' appeal, a three-game ban can be increased to four. Appeals can't be lodged in the event of a second yellow card, apart from in cases of mistaken identity. Club red cards are completely separate from international red cards. No cards received at club level will result in an international ban and vice-versa. However, Fifa does have the power to enforce a global ban. After biting Giorgio Chiellini in the 2014 World Cup, Luis Suarez was banned from all football for four months.","pubDate":"2023-03-04 13:40:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","category":["sports"],"country":["ireland"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football team make brilliantly cheeky social media post after opponents accused unnamed club of SPYING","link":"https://www.thesun.ie/sport/football/10326239/football-team-spying-incredible-social-media-post/","keywords":["Football","Sport"],"creator":["Joshua Mbu"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"GALWAY UNITED have poked fun at Waterford after their Irish rivals accused an unnamed club of SPYING on their training session.
