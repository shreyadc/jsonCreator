The partnership, initially signed back in 2020, was due to expire this summer but UK-based firm has opted to extend its deal with the Reds in what is a boost for the club’s commercial efforts and another sign of commercial partners being pleased with their activations with the Reds, following on from extended deals with , Expedia and EA Sports over the past 12 months. The renewed partnership will remain focused on growing the Liverpool FC Works Programme over the coming years of the extension, with the hope of helping even more young people from the Liverpool City Region to prepare for the world of work. Cadbury are also focusing on providing ‘bigger and better’ experiences for fans ahead of the firm’s 200th birthday celebrations next year. At the start of the original partnership Cadbury created a limited-edition Liverpool FC Champions Dairy Milk bar, which was available to purchase through official club stores. Proceeds from the sale of these bars were donated to the Liverpool FC Virtual Employability Programme, providing £25,000 to launch the initiative. In addition to the money raised, Cadbury employees have been volunteering as mentors on the Programme, providing real-world business knowledge and advice to participants. Ben Latty, commercial director at , said: “I am delighted to announce the extension of our partnership with Cadbury. Cadbury has shown its commitment to providing for our local community, working closely with the LFC Foundation on the LFC Works Programme. “We look forward to continuing to work together and strengthening our meaningful partnership further over the next three years.” The extension of another partnership for the Reds is telling from a business perspective, with the club having been focused on attracting and retaining major blue-chip brands as sponsors and continuing to grow not only the value of those deals cycle after cycle but also offering these companies the kind of engagement that they seek aside from simply selling ad space on pitch hoardings, on shirts and training wear or on the club website. Daniel Haddad, head of commercial strategy at global sports firm Octagon, recently: “A lot of people from outside the industry may always be looking at the size of the newest deal and getting new partners on board, but we are seeing with a couple of clubs that if your big, long-term premium sponsors don’t want to renew their deals then going back out to market to find a replacement can be very difficult because it is a highly competitive market. “If you are a club selling your major assets such as shirt sponsorship, sleeve and training kit etc, then at any one time there is going to be some of your competitors selling similar assets. You have got Formula One that is becoming more global and doing really well (commercially) at the moment, and you have got UEFA and the Champions League. “On some of those bigger partnerships what you want to do is grow them organically over time through extension and expansion rather than finding new partners. What Liverpool have done very well is servicing partners once they are on board and it does speak to the power of the global Liverpool fan-base that once a brand has decided to invest in Liverpool and after spending a few years and activating the partnership, it really does suggest that they buy into what Liverpool say about themselves. That really is the cornerstone of any successful sponsorship model. “There will always be partners and brands that just come and go. Global economic conditions and things that happen within businesses that are unpredictable, but if you can retain 60-70 per cent of your sponsors when the contracts come up for renewal then you are looking at consistent organic growth over time.”","pubDate":"2023-06-20 10:28:31","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26766032.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1465626100.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsenal ahead of Man Utd & Chelsea as they advance in transfer that could be club’s record sale","link":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/2023/06/20/romeo-lavia-to-arsenal-transfer-talks-advancing-romano/","keywords":["Arsenal FC","Championship","Chelsea FC","Extra Time","Features - NewsNow","Football and Soccer","Manchester United FC","Mobile App Stories","Premier League","Southampton FC","Transfer News","Fabrizio Romano","Romeo Lavia"],"creator":["Mark Brus"],"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal are reportedly advancing in their efforts to clinch the transfer of Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia this summer.The highly-rated young Belgium international just had a hugely impressive season in the Premier League in the campaign just gone, even if his displays weren’t quite enough to help the Saints survive relegation.With Southampton’s drop to the Championship, […] The post Arsenal ahead of Man Utd & Chelsea as they advance in transfer that could be club’s record sale appeared first on CaughtOffside.","content":"The highly-rated young Belgium international just had a hugely impressive season in the Premier League in the campaign just gone, even if his displays weren’t quite enough to help the Saints survive relegation.

The forward only has 12 months left on his current three-year City deal and has been linked with a move away from the Coventry Building Society Arena. The Sky Blues' failure to return to the now appears to have cost them. Gyokeres joined the club from Brighton in January 2021, initially on loan, after spending the first half of the season on loan at Swansea. The Swedish international went on to score 21 times and claim 12 assists last season. That impressive form has led to Gyokeres being linked with a host of clubs, including . The that strengthening attack is one of the club’s main priorities this summer. \"The reality is that it's early in the window,\" King told . \"There is quite a lot of interest in Viktor. He's clearly made his comments to the press, and we'll see how it unfolds.\" He then added: \"I'm feeling quite calm, and Viktor is still contracted to Coventry City.\" The Coventry chief also revealed that Sporting CP have made an approach to his club about a deal for the forward. King’s admission comes just over a week after Gyokeres made it clear that he would like to leave this summer. He said: \"Sporting Lisbon have been all over the pages. They have been in touch with the club. But it isn't up to Viktor Gyokeres to tell the club he's going somewhere for 50p. That is not how it works and won't happen in this situation. \"When a player moves, they have to agree their terms with a different club, and the selling club have to agree a compensation package. If both of those don't work, then nothing will happen.\" Asked if he was disappointed by the comments Gyokeres made, King replied: \"To some degree. Obviously, he's been on social media and made his comments clear. \"He's had a great season and is now playing international football. We bought the player, he's had two good seasons with us, we're still in the championship, and, from my perspective, he's on another year. \"If Coventry City want to decide to have him on that other year as it's more important for us to try and get in the Premier League, then that is something that he has to get into his mind. \"Obviously, then he would become a free agent, and everybody would say that's a bit mad.

Last season was a tense one for Everton, with Sean Dyche's side just about securing Premier League safety with a 1-0 win on the final day of the campaign. The Toffees finished just two points away from the relegation zone, and they will be hoping for better fortune in the 2023/24 campaign. Everton face just one of the so-called 'big six' teams in their opening eight league games before visiting Anfield in the first Merseyside derby of the season on October 21. The toughest period for Dyche's side appears to be between November and December on paper, facing Man United, Newcastle, Chelsea, Tottenham and Man City all in the space of seven games. So, how could Everton perform in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign? Let's take a look. To set up this simulation, we used the Football Manager 2023 editor to update the Premier League with the latest teams, transfers and of course, the confirmed fixtures. Using FM23 to run the simulation, we then simulated the entire 2023/24 season to see how the Toffees got on. Everton got off to the perfect start in the 2023/24 season, picking up three points and a clean sheet against Fulham. Dominic Calvert-Lewin bagged a brace to secure a 2-0 win over the Cottagers, with Jordan Pickford having a great game in goal. February was the best month of the season for the Toffees, with Dyche picking up manager of the month as Everton won three and drew one, including their biggest victory of the campaign. James Tarkowski, Calvert-Lewin, Dwight McNeil and Alex Iwobi all got on the scoresheet to secure a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace in the simulation. After picking up a shock point away to Man City last season, Everton managed one better in the simulation, beating the Premier League champions 2-1 at the Etihad. After going behind early on, Iwobi and Ellis Simms both scored to claim the three points. The Toffees managed to pick up one point out of six against Merseyside rivals Liverpool in the simulation, with the Reds proving the dominant force at Anfield. Demari Gray cancelled out Mohamed Salah's opener to draw 1-1 at Goodison Park, but Everton were unable to get anything from the reverse fixture, losing 2-0 at Anfield. It was a disappointing end to the season for Everton, with Dyche's side falling to a heavy defeat away to Arsenal. An awful first-half showing saw the Gunners go 4-0 up, and it remained that way until the full-time whistle. Everton ended the Premier League campaign very poorly, winning just two of their final 12 games of the season. But, a strong run of results in the middle of the season saw Dyche's side pick up enough points to claim Premier League safety, finishing 13th in the table. All three promoted teams were relegated, with Burnley picking up 30 points in 18th, 13 points fewer than Everton managed. 12 wins, seven draws and 19 defeats saw Dyche's side earn 43 points, with the Toffees securing safety with a few games remaining. Overall, according to Football Manager 2023's Premier League simulation for the 2023/24 campaign, Everton could improve on last season, managing seven more points and securing Premier League safety in a much calmer manner. The Toffees struggled with the fixtures at the end of the season, but Dyche's side found their best form around Christmas time.","pubDate":"2023-06-20 09:40:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27152262.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1494344236.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"«Челси» купил Нкунку у «Лейпцига» за 60+ млн евро.

That’s according to , who are reporting that Kalidou Koulibaly, Hakim Ziyech and Edouard Mendy are among the players in talks to move to the Kingdom on lucrative deals. The report goes on to say that Romelu Lukaku and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are both subjects of strong interest from Saudi Arabia.

I like it . @danielgallan hello to the Dan-ster! Equally fascinating will be the response to the days events. E.g. Stokes' declaration will either be a \"statement of intent\" or \"foolhardy hubris\" depending on whether England wins or loses. The narrative seems massive — notjarvis (@notjarvis) June 20, 2023 5m ago 10.48 BST Loads of chat about YJB and Foakes: Timothy Sanders from Leeds: “I think Barney is right, that ‘it would be progressive, not regressive, to bring Foakes into this team’, in line with England’s philosophy of how to play Test cricket. If it’s about having fun, taking twenty wickets, and showing the paying public your very best skills, then surely the practical application of Bazball means picking your very best wicketkeeper? I say go with Foakes as the way for this team to live its values. Then they just have to decide on the best 5 from the 6 batters!” Stephen Brown who has offered ‘Big Dan’ as a nickname: “For me, Foakes should be in the team. Having a very good wicket keeper vs a good wicket keeper can be worth having another batter who averages 40-50 in the team. And who wouldn’t want to add that? So the question becomes, who do you leave out? Weirdly, I’d say the person underperforming their playing role in the team the most over the last year might actually be Stokes. But we can’t exactly drop him and let him captain from the touchlines. Which means the solution is probably to let Bairstow open. Ducket has more runs as an opener under Stokes than Crawly despite playing half the games, so he should probably be given the first shot of opening alongside Bairstow.” Joe Roberts: “If it is true that Bairstow must be in the side due to last year’s heroics, it is also true that Crawley has done very little to justify his place in this side, having contributed very little to the success over the last 12 months. Not to mention that Foakes has been a vital part of that success, not just with the gloves, but with the bat as well, and surely warrants the same treatment as Bairstow.” Tom Nolan: “ Crawley out for Foakes with YJB opening? Won‘t happen after Crawley‘s first innings knock here but seems a logical way to get Foakes and Bairstow into the same side.” Geoff Wignall with a another whacky idea: “My new solution would be someone with sound defensive technique yet capable of serious aggression who isn’t scoring many in his current slot: one Ben Stokes.” 12m ago 10.40 BST Foakes for Brook? To be honest, I hadn’t considered that. But Richard O’Hagan makes an intersting point that has got me thinking: “I know that this will be controversial, but I think you have to choose between Bairstow and Brook. Brook came into the side as the replacement for the injured Bairstow and from a batting perspective they are probably on a par with one another, save that YJB is vastly more experienced. But at the same time the runs that England have conceded as a result of Bairstow’s rustiness with the gloves could well be the difference between winning and losing this Test, as they pretty much negate his contribution with the bat. For my money Foakes has to play and one of those two has to stand down if England are to have any chance of winning this series.” Let’s not forget that Foakes is still a brilliant batter. Sure he doesn’t have the firepower of Brook or Bairstow, but it’s not like he’s a mug with the willow. And if Ali plays (finger blister permitting) they still have the punch in the lower order. 16m ago 10.37 BST Email gremlins fixed: I wasn’t aware that the link to my email was broken. Should be sorted now. If you’ve been trying to get in touch but haven’t done so, please try again. 18m ago 10.35 BST This is a really, really long email from Simon in Cornwall . But with nothing going on, I’ll share it in it’s entirety with my two cents between each paragraph (yes, paragraph, strap in): “I have a question about the reverse ramp. How does the batter decide that that is the shot they are going to play? It seems that they get into position for the shot so early that it can’t be based on the trajectory of the ball - does the batter decide before the ball is bowled that they are going to play that shot, and just commit? I get that you wouldn’t play it against an unpredictable spinner, and that you need some kind of predictability in the bowlers style - is there maybe some subtle thing in finger position or wrist action that makes the batter know it is a good shot selection? Or is it just hit and hope?” It has to be premeditated . Bowlers like Boland who put it on the same spot over and over again are particularly susceptible to being ramped. A lot of hit and hope for sure. “I’d also like to say something about Bazball. I think something that hasn’t been mentioned much is Ben Stokes’ struggles with mental health, and the fact that it seems to me that Bazball is an attempt by Stokes to take the parts of the game that may cause a player to struggle, and just…..remove them. Many elite sportspeople have suffered badly in this arena, and not just cricketers - see ‘The Edge’, about the 09-13 England team, but also Nick Kyrgios, Mark Selby, Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, and god knows how many others from years gone by.” Oh, Bazball is therapy. Or so said Barney Ronay in this wonderful piece . “The reason I have so much respect for this style of play is that it seems to me that after taking brave decisions to protect his own wellbeing over the years, Stokes has developed a style that extends this protection to his whole team. Stokes has a greater understanding of his teammates, and of the nature of leadership and sporting ambition than any leader I can think of, and this goes far beyond ‘finding a way to win’. Stokes has taken bold, innovative steps to protect, nurture and develop the whole person, not just their skills and sporting qualities, knowing full well that, coincidentally, this is how you get the best out of them.” Bold, innovative, daring, carefree . That’s why it' has captured so many people, win or lose. “Its interesting that the list of athletes I mention who have publicly struggled with their mental health are all proponents of individual sports (tennis, snooker, gymnastics, swimming), and this is the first example I know of where the thinking has been extended to a team sport. I see Gareth Southgate doing something similar, but in a gentler and less bold way, and the results there are fairly clear too. As someone who has had some pretty loopy mental health over the years, I can not tell you how much I respect what Stokes (and BmcC) is doing.” Mate, thank you for opening up. I reckon a lot of people reading this right now will relate. “The way England are playing will ripple outwards and change the way test cricket is played, and more importantly how it is perceived that it SHOULD be played, maybe even save the format from a spiral of stagnation and diminishing gate receipts as everyone rushes to whizzier formats, leaving a trail of broken and forgotten players who gave their all but failed in some way that comes to define them forever. I adore the man, and in true Bazball style, wish with all my heart that he stays true to his new methods through the whole series, even if it means we lose every test. It feels more important than that, to me.” Even football is hooked! “I understand that this isn’t how a lot of fans feel - the ‘win at all costs’ mentality is irresistible to a sports fan, even if that cost is the health and wellbeing of the very players they revere. Bazball reminds us all that athletes are people, and that people do their best work when they love what they are doing, are given freedom to express themselves and are respected for doing so. Bazball, to me, isn’t just a cricketing ideology, it’s not a cricketing tactic, and its certainly not the new-age, man-feeling, bro-vibes rubbish it can so easily be dismissed as. Its an affirmation of the humanity at the heart of cricket, of sport, and of competition, and I hope it lasts forever. Or at least til the end of the fifth test. ” And let’s not forget that England were rubbish before Bazball . This is not simply the unshackling of players but also a cohesive strategy to get the best out of a talented group. It’s daring and brave, but also calculated (even if it doesn’t always seem that way). Thank you for a brilliant mail. I really enjoyed that. 25m ago 10.27 BST “Hi Dan. Looking forward to a cracking day’s play!” Me too, Damian Johnson , let’s hope we get enough of it. “Regards Bairstow/Foakes, YJB is allowed one bad game I would say, and horses for courses, Foakes stays in contention for tours in Asia or the driest of dry wickets. “If he were to come in, any of the top 3 should be under pressure and this includes Pope who never seems to be mentioned despite a highly mediocre record, especially against the big boys. Don’t get me wrong, cracking looking batter but he never seems to be under any pressure - is this a Surrey thing!?” Hmmm. I’m not sure it’s a Surrey thing. If that was the case then Foakes would be playing. Pope is class. No doubt about that. I saw him score a coming of age ton against South Africa in Gqeberha. He’ll be alright in the long run. But you’re right. A few more failures and some serious questions will need to be asked. Updated at 10.51 BST 30m ago 10.22 BST YummyBear has become our official weather correspondent .

But if we do get play it'll be to England's advantage as Australia can't win it in a couple of hours but they might lose it. — Will Southworth (@willsouthworth) June 20, 2023 Updated at 10.28 BST 42m ago 10.11 BST I loved this piece by Barney from last night. And would love to know what you think about the Bairstow-Foakes debate. For my money, Young JB has to play. He’s just so destructive with the bat. But there’s no question Foakes is the outstanding keeper in the country. Does that mean Duckett drops out? But then who opens? Should Pope make way? Ludicrous! There are no easy answers in the epoch of Baz.

At the risk of heaping more hyperbole on top of a narrative oozing with the stuff, this has already been an almighty contest that has packed more action than most series. It began on a road and saw Joe Root unfurl a sumptuous century before the bucket-hatted Ben Stokes declared on the first day. Then Usman Khawaja batted and batted and batted until he was given a sweary send-off by Ollie Robinson . Did it cross the line? Have these lines ever existed? Are the Aussies now the meek ones in this ancient relationship? Root attempted a reverse scoop from the first ball of day three . Pat Cummins was outstanding. Nathan Lyon picked up a four-for. Moeen Ali’s finger fell apart. Stuart Broad did Stuart Broad things and now, as we begin this final day of an epic battle, Australia need 174 runs and England need seven wickets. There are echoes of 2005 and the narrow two run win for England that helped ignite the greatest Ashes in living memory. If the past four days are anything to go by, we might have a contender to that particular title. My name is Daniel, but in this Bazball age you can call me Dan, Danny Boy or frankly any other whacky nickname you like (please don’t make me regret that). There’s rain about in Birmingham but all the journos on the ground reckon we’ll have play after a slight delay. Don’t worry. We’re getting a result. Of that I’m certain. If you fancy dropping a line please do. Email or Twitter. You know the drill. Strap in folks. This is going to be a good ’un.

The two countries rarely play home matches against each other in any sport due to long-running political tensions. The participation of Pakistan in the Bengaluru event has raised hopes Islamabad will take part in the ICC World Cup cricket tournament hosted by India later this year, having earlier threatened to boycott the event. “As devoted sportsmen, we understand the power of sports in transcending political boundaries and fostering strong relationships between nations,” Pakistan captain Yousaf Butt told AFP. He was speaking from Mauritius, where Pakistan has taken part in a four-nation event. “We will put in a worthy performance despite zero sleep and jetlag — and off the field will try to win hearts to ease the tension.” The 32-strong touring party only received their visas late Monday. The last time Pakistan played football in India was in 2014, when they drew a two-match series, but they also faced off in the SAFF Championship in Bangladesh in 2018, with India winning 3-1. Football is popular in both nations but dwarfed by cricket. Despite the millions in revenue bilateral cricket matches would earn, the last time they played on home soil was when Pakistan toured India for five limited-overs matches in 2012. The eight-nation SAFF Championship kicks off Wednesday, with Pakistan in Group A alongside India, Kuwait, and Nepal, and Group B featuring Lebanon, Maldives, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.

Ryan believes Manaccan, who will be ridden by fellow Gooner Frankie Dettori , is the best horse he has ever trained. And he is hoping it brings a much-needed trophy for a team of Tottenham Hotspur supporters who make up the Ossie Ardiles syndicate that owns Manaccan. Argentinian World Cup winner Ardiles, who played for and managed Spurs, is also planning to be at the track to see the race. 'Although not quite on a par with the thrill of winning a World Cup it has been a terrific ride in the syndicate,' said Ardiles. 'Manaccan is a star and we believe he can do us all proud at the world's greatest horse race meeting. To make the winner's enclosure would certainly be a close third to winning the World Cup in 1978 and the FA Cup in 1981.' Gooners Frankie Dettori and John Ryan are trying to win a trophy for Spurs icon Ossie Ardiles Veteran jockey Frankie Dettori is set to ride Ryan-trained Manaccan at Royal Ascot on Tuesday Ardiles claims winning the King's Stand would be third only behind the World Cup and FA Cup Ryan added: 'Manaccan is as well as I have had him. He looks a picture and a little bit of luck on the day would not go astray. There will be a few faces in the paddock with the football crew and it is lovely to be associated with them. It is great to be able to find them a horse good enough to take them to a place like Royal Ascot.' Winning the King's Stand would be a fairy tale for the 20-strong Ossie Ardiles Syndicate, formed of friends who share a Spurs corporate hospitality box. The group's newly recruited racing followers are professionals with legal, media, medical and shipping backgrounds. The syndicate, which started in November 2021, was the idea of lifelong Spurs fan Graham Smith-Bernal who owns the renowned Newsells Park Stud in Royston. Smith-Bernal persuaded his fellow Spurs fans in the box to diversify their sporting interests by getting into horse racing, partly on the premise that they might have a better chance of winning something. Membership of the stud's syndicates are by invitation, with Newsells retaining at least 25 per cent of the shares in each syndicate, thereby maintaining an alignment of interests between Newsells and the syndicate members. Manaccan is one of six horses racing for the syndicate, with the membership including the local Newsells Park vicar to add her prayers to the dreams of glory. Smith-Bernal said: 'Nothing fazes Manaccan. He saves all his energy for his racing. He is the most chilled horse I have owned. He's incredibly honest and will leave nothing in the locker.' Dettori, 52 and riding his last Royal Ascot, has been keen to maintain his partnership with Manaccan after he finished third on the colt on unsuitably soft ground at Newmarket last month. The 5-1 third favourite made significant progress through the ranks last season when he won the Listed Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster as well as the Listed Rous Stakes at Ascot, one of two wins at the course from only three starts there. Ryan, who is hoping the thunderstorms that could hit Ascot fail to materialise, said: 'Manaccan is the best I have had by far. I have been lucky to have a couple of Group-winning sprinters but nothing anything in his league. 'Ryan Moore has won on him but he has commitments to other people which is why we booked Frankie to ride him in last month's Palace House Stakes so that he could stay with him at Royal Ascot.'

The partnership, initially signed back in 2020, was due to expire this summer but UK-based firm has opted to extend its deal with the Reds in what is a boost for the club’s commercial efforts and another sign of commercial partners being pleased with their activations with the Reds, following on from extended deals with , Expedia and EA Sports over the past 12 months. The renewed partnership will remain focused on growing the Liverpool FC Works Programme over the coming years of the extension, with the hope of helping even more young people from the Liverpool City Region to prepare for the world of work. Cadbury are also focusing on providing ‘bigger and better’ experiences for fans ahead of the firm’s 200th birthday celebrations next year. At the start of the original partnership Cadbury created a limited-edition Liverpool FC Champions Dairy Milk bar, which was available to purchase through official club stores. Proceeds from the sale of these bars were donated to the Liverpool FC Virtual Employability Programme, providing £25,000 to launch the initiative. In addition to the money raised, Cadbury employees have been volunteering as mentors on the Programme, providing real-world business knowledge and advice to participants. Ben Latty, commercial director at , said: “I am delighted to announce the extension of our partnership with Cadbury. Cadbury has shown its commitment to providing for our local community, working closely with the LFC Foundation on the LFC Works Programme. “We look forward to continuing to work together and strengthening our meaningful partnership further over the next three years.” The extension of another partnership for the Reds is telling from a business perspective, with the club having been focused on attracting and retaining major blue-chip brands as sponsors and continuing to grow not only the value of those deals cycle after cycle but also offering these companies the kind of engagement that they seek aside from simply selling ad space on pitch hoardings, on shirts and training wear or on the club website. Daniel Haddad, head of commercial strategy at global sports firm Octagon, recently: “A lot of people from outside the industry may always be looking at the size of the newest deal and getting new partners on board, but we are seeing with a couple of clubs that if your big, long-term premium sponsors don’t want to renew their deals then going back out to market to find a replacement can be very difficult because it is a highly competitive market. “If you are a club selling your major assets such as shirt sponsorship, sleeve and training kit etc, then at any one time there is going to be some of your competitors selling similar assets. You have got Formula One that is becoming more global and doing really well (commercially) at the moment, and you have got UEFA and the Champions League. “On some of those bigger partnerships what you want to do is grow them organically over time through extension and expansion rather than finding new partners. What Liverpool have done very well is servicing partners once they are on board and it does speak to the power of the global Liverpool fan-base that once a brand has decided to invest in Liverpool and after spending a few years and activating the partnership, it really does suggest that they buy into what Liverpool say about themselves. That really is the cornerstone of any successful sponsorship model. “There will always be partners and brands that just come and go. Global economic conditions and things that happen within businesses that are unpredictable, but if you can retain 60-70 per cent of your sponsors when the contracts come up for renewal then you are looking at consistent organic growth over time.”","pubDate":"2023-06-20 10:28:31","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26766032.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1465626100.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsenal ahead of Man Utd & Chelsea as they advance in transfer that could be club’s record sale","link":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/2023/06/20/romeo-lavia-to-arsenal-transfer-talks-advancing-romano/","keywords":["Arsenal FC","Championship","Chelsea FC","Extra Time","Features - NewsNow","Football and Soccer","Manchester United FC","Mobile App Stories","Premier League","Southampton FC","Transfer News","Fabrizio Romano","Romeo Lavia"],"creator":["Mark Brus"],"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal are reportedly advancing in their efforts to clinch the transfer of Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia this summer.The highly-rated young Belgium international just had a hugely impressive season in the Premier League in the campaign just gone, even if his displays weren’t quite enough to help the Saints survive relegation.With Southampton’s drop to the Championship, […] The post Arsenal ahead of Man Utd & Chelsea as they advance in transfer that could be club’s record sale appeared first on CaughtOffside.","content":"The highly-rated young Belgium international just had a hugely impressive season in the Premier League in the campaign just gone, even if his displays weren’t quite enough to help the Saints survive relegation.

The forward only has 12 months left on his current three-year City deal and has been linked with a move away from the Coventry Building Society Arena. The Sky Blues' failure to return to the now appears to have cost them. Gyokeres joined the club from Brighton in January 2021, initially on loan, after spending the first half of the season on loan at Swansea. The Swedish international went on to score 21 times and claim 12 assists last season. That impressive form has led to Gyokeres being linked with a host of clubs, including . The that strengthening attack is one of the club’s main priorities this summer. \"The reality is that it's early in the window,\" King told . \"There is quite a lot of interest in Viktor. He's clearly made his comments to the press, and we'll see how it unfolds.\" He then added: \"I'm feeling quite calm, and Viktor is still contracted to Coventry City.\" The Coventry chief also revealed that Sporting CP have made an approach to his club about a deal for the forward. King’s admission comes just over a week after Gyokeres made it clear that he would like to leave this summer. He said: \"Sporting Lisbon have been all over the pages. They have been in touch with the club. But it isn't up to Viktor Gyokeres to tell the club he's going somewhere for 50p. That is not how it works and won't happen in this situation. \"When a player moves, they have to agree their terms with a different club, and the selling club have to agree a compensation package. If both of those don't work, then nothing will happen.\" Asked if he was disappointed by the comments Gyokeres made, King replied: \"To some degree. Obviously, he's been on social media and made his comments clear. \"He's had a great season and is now playing international football. We bought the player, he's had two good seasons with us, we're still in the championship, and, from my perspective, he's on another year. \"If Coventry City want to decide to have him on that other year as it's more important for us to try and get in the Premier League, then that is something that he has to get into his mind. \"Obviously, then he would become a free agent, and everybody would say that's a bit mad.

Last season was a tense one for Everton, with Sean Dyche's side just about securing Premier League safety with a 1-0 win on the final day of the campaign. The Toffees finished just two points away from the relegation zone, and they will be hoping for better fortune in the 2023/24 campaign. Everton face just one of the so-called 'big six' teams in their opening eight league games before visiting Anfield in the first Merseyside derby of the season on October 21. The toughest period for Dyche's side appears to be between November and December on paper, facing Man United, Newcastle, Chelsea, Tottenham and Man City all in the space of seven games. So, how could Everton perform in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign? Let's take a look. To set up this simulation, we used the Football Manager 2023 editor to update the Premier League with the latest teams, transfers and of course, the confirmed fixtures. Using FM23 to run the simulation, we then simulated the entire 2023/24 season to see how the Toffees got on. Everton got off to the perfect start in the 2023/24 season, picking up three points and a clean sheet against Fulham. Dominic Calvert-Lewin bagged a brace to secure a 2-0 win over the Cottagers, with Jordan Pickford having a great game in goal. February was the best month of the season for the Toffees, with Dyche picking up manager of the month as Everton won three and drew one, including their biggest victory of the campaign. James Tarkowski, Calvert-Lewin, Dwight McNeil and Alex Iwobi all got on the scoresheet to secure a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace in the simulation. After picking up a shock point away to Man City last season, Everton managed one better in the simulation, beating the Premier League champions 2-1 at the Etihad. After going behind early on, Iwobi and Ellis Simms both scored to claim the three points. The Toffees managed to pick up one point out of six against Merseyside rivals Liverpool in the simulation, with the Reds proving the dominant force at Anfield. Demari Gray cancelled out Mohamed Salah's opener to draw 1-1 at Goodison Park, but Everton were unable to get anything from the reverse fixture, losing 2-0 at Anfield. It was a disappointing end to the season for Everton, with Dyche's side falling to a heavy defeat away to Arsenal. An awful first-half showing saw the Gunners go 4-0 up, and it remained that way until the full-time whistle. Everton ended the Premier League campaign very poorly, winning just two of their final 12 games of the season. But, a strong run of results in the middle of the season saw Dyche's side pick up enough points to claim Premier League safety, finishing 13th in the table. All three promoted teams were relegated, with Burnley picking up 30 points in 18th, 13 points fewer than Everton managed. 12 wins, seven draws and 19 defeats saw Dyche's side earn 43 points, with the Toffees securing safety with a few games remaining. Overall, according to Football Manager 2023's Premier League simulation for the 2023/24 campaign, Everton could improve on last season, managing seven more points and securing Premier League safety in a much calmer manner. The Toffees struggled with the fixtures at the end of the season, but Dyche's side found their best form around Christmas time.","pubDate":"2023-06-20 09:40:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27152262.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1494344236.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"«Челси» купил Нкунку у «Лейпцига» за 60+ млн евро.

I like it . @danielgallan hello to the Dan-ster! Equally fascinating will be the response to the days events. E.g. Stokes' declaration will either be a \"statement of intent\" or \"foolhardy hubris\" depending on whether England wins or loses. The narrative seems massive — notjarvis (@notjarvis) June 20, 2023 5m ago 10.48 BST Loads of chat about YJB and Foakes: Timothy Sanders from Leeds: “I think Barney is right, that ‘it would be progressive, not regressive, to bring Foakes into this team’, in line with England’s philosophy of how to play Test cricket. If it’s about having fun, taking twenty wickets, and showing the paying public your very best skills, then surely the practical application of Bazball means picking your very best wicketkeeper? I say go with Foakes as the way for this team to live its values. Then they just have to decide on the best 5 from the 6 batters!” Stephen Brown who has offered ‘Big Dan’ as a nickname: “For me, Foakes should be in the team. Having a very good wicket keeper vs a good wicket keeper can be worth having another batter who averages 40-50 in the team. And who wouldn’t want to add that? So the question becomes, who do you leave out? Weirdly, I’d say the person underperforming their playing role in the team the most over the last year might actually be Stokes. But we can’t exactly drop him and let him captain from the touchlines. Which means the solution is probably to let Bairstow open. Ducket has more runs as an opener under Stokes than Crawly despite playing half the games, so he should probably be given the first shot of opening alongside Bairstow.” Joe Roberts: “If it is true that Bairstow must be in the side due to last year’s heroics, it is also true that Crawley has done very little to justify his place in this side, having contributed very little to the success over the last 12 months. Not to mention that Foakes has been a vital part of that success, not just with the gloves, but with the bat as well, and surely warrants the same treatment as Bairstow.” Tom Nolan: “ Crawley out for Foakes with YJB opening? Won‘t happen after Crawley‘s first innings knock here but seems a logical way to get Foakes and Bairstow into the same side.” Geoff Wignall with a another whacky idea: “My new solution would be someone with sound defensive technique yet capable of serious aggression who isn’t scoring many in his current slot: one Ben Stokes.” 12m ago 10.40 BST Foakes for Brook? To be honest, I hadn’t considered that. But Richard O’Hagan makes an intersting point that has got me thinking: “I know that this will be controversial, but I think you have to choose between Bairstow and Brook. Brook came into the side as the replacement for the injured Bairstow and from a batting perspective they are probably on a par with one another, save that YJB is vastly more experienced. But at the same time the runs that England have conceded as a result of Bairstow’s rustiness with the gloves could well be the difference between winning and losing this Test, as they pretty much negate his contribution with the bat. For my money Foakes has to play and one of those two has to stand down if England are to have any chance of winning this series.” Let’s not forget that Foakes is still a brilliant batter. Sure he doesn’t have the firepower of Brook or Bairstow, but it’s not like he’s a mug with the willow. And if Ali plays (finger blister permitting) they still have the punch in the lower order. 16m ago 10.37 BST Email gremlins fixed: I wasn’t aware that the link to my email was broken. Should be sorted now. If you’ve been trying to get in touch but haven’t done so, please try again. 18m ago 10.35 BST This is a really, really long email from Simon in Cornwall . But with nothing going on, I’ll share it in it’s entirety with my two cents between each paragraph (yes, paragraph, strap in): “I have a question about the reverse ramp. How does the batter decide that that is the shot they are going to play? It seems that they get into position for the shot so early that it can’t be based on the trajectory of the ball - does the batter decide before the ball is bowled that they are going to play that shot, and just commit? I get that you wouldn’t play it against an unpredictable spinner, and that you need some kind of predictability in the bowlers style - is there maybe some subtle thing in finger position or wrist action that makes the batter know it is a good shot selection? Or is it just hit and hope?” It has to be premeditated . Bowlers like Boland who put it on the same spot over and over again are particularly susceptible to being ramped. A lot of hit and hope for sure. “I’d also like to say something about Bazball. I think something that hasn’t been mentioned much is Ben Stokes’ struggles with mental health, and the fact that it seems to me that Bazball is an attempt by Stokes to take the parts of the game that may cause a player to struggle, and just…..remove them. Many elite sportspeople have suffered badly in this arena, and not just cricketers - see ‘The Edge’, about the 09-13 England team, but also Nick Kyrgios, Mark Selby, Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, and god knows how many others from years gone by.” Oh, Bazball is therapy. Or so said Barney Ronay in this wonderful piece . “The reason I have so much respect for this style of play is that it seems to me that after taking brave decisions to protect his own wellbeing over the years, Stokes has developed a style that extends this protection to his whole team. Stokes has a greater understanding of his teammates, and of the nature of leadership and sporting ambition than any leader I can think of, and this goes far beyond ‘finding a way to win’. Stokes has taken bold, innovative steps to protect, nurture and develop the whole person, not just their skills and sporting qualities, knowing full well that, coincidentally, this is how you get the best out of them.” Bold, innovative, daring, carefree . That’s why it' has captured so many people, win or lose. “Its interesting that the list of athletes I mention who have publicly struggled with their mental health are all proponents of individual sports (tennis, snooker, gymnastics, swimming), and this is the first example I know of where the thinking has been extended to a team sport. I see Gareth Southgate doing something similar, but in a gentler and less bold way, and the results there are fairly clear too. As someone who has had some pretty loopy mental health over the years, I can not tell you how much I respect what Stokes (and BmcC) is doing.” Mate, thank you for opening up. I reckon a lot of people reading this right now will relate. “The way England are playing will ripple outwards and change the way test cricket is played, and more importantly how it is perceived that it SHOULD be played, maybe even save the format from a spiral of stagnation and diminishing gate receipts as everyone rushes to whizzier formats, leaving a trail of broken and forgotten players who gave their all but failed in some way that comes to define them forever. I adore the man, and in true Bazball style, wish with all my heart that he stays true to his new methods through the whole series, even if it means we lose every test. It feels more important than that, to me.” Even football is hooked! “I understand that this isn’t how a lot of fans feel - the ‘win at all costs’ mentality is irresistible to a sports fan, even if that cost is the health and wellbeing of the very players they revere. Bazball reminds us all that athletes are people, and that people do their best work when they love what they are doing, are given freedom to express themselves and are respected for doing so. Bazball, to me, isn’t just a cricketing ideology, it’s not a cricketing tactic, and its certainly not the new-age, man-feeling, bro-vibes rubbish it can so easily be dismissed as. Its an affirmation of the humanity at the heart of cricket, of sport, and of competition, and I hope it lasts forever. Or at least til the end of the fifth test. ” And let’s not forget that England were rubbish before Bazball . This is not simply the unshackling of players but also a cohesive strategy to get the best out of a talented group. It’s daring and brave, but also calculated (even if it doesn’t always seem that way). Thank you for a brilliant mail. I really enjoyed that. 25m ago 10.27 BST “Hi Dan. Looking forward to a cracking day’s play!” Me too, Damian Johnson , let’s hope we get enough of it. “Regards Bairstow/Foakes, YJB is allowed one bad game I would say, and horses for courses, Foakes stays in contention for tours in Asia or the driest of dry wickets. “If he were to come in, any of the top 3 should be under pressure and this includes Pope who never seems to be mentioned despite a highly mediocre record, especially against the big boys. Don’t get me wrong, cracking looking batter but he never seems to be under any pressure - is this a Surrey thing!?” Hmmm. I’m not sure it’s a Surrey thing. If that was the case then Foakes would be playing. Pope is class. No doubt about that. I saw him score a coming of age ton against South Africa in Gqeberha. He’ll be alright in the long run. But you’re right. A few more failures and some serious questions will need to be asked. Updated at 10.51 BST 30m ago 10.22 BST YummyBear has become our official weather correspondent .

And would love to know what you think about the Bairstow-Foakes debate. For my money, Young JB has to play. He’s just so destructive with the bat. But there’s no question Foakes is the outstanding keeper in the country. Does that mean Duckett drops out? But then who opens? Should Pope make way? Ludicrous! There are no easy answers in the epoch of Baz.

At the risk of heaping more hyperbole on top of a narrative oozing with the stuff, this has already been an almighty contest that has packed more action than most series. It began on a road and saw Joe Root unfurl a sumptuous century before the bucket-hatted Ben Stokes declared on the first day. Then Usman Khawaja batted and batted and batted until he was given a sweary send-off by Ollie Robinson . Did it cross the line? Have these lines ever existed? Are the Aussies now the meek ones in this ancient relationship? Root attempted a reverse scoop from the first ball of day three . Pat Cummins was outstanding. Nathan Lyon picked up a four-for. Moeen Ali’s finger fell apart. Stuart Broad did Stuart Broad things and now, as we begin this final day of an epic battle, Australia need 174 runs and England need seven wickets. There are echoes of 2005 and the narrow two run win for England that helped ignite the greatest Ashes in living memory. If the past four days are anything to go by, we might have a contender to that particular title. My name is Daniel, but in this Bazball age you can call me Dan, Danny Boy or frankly any other whacky nickname you like (please don’t make me regret that). There’s rain about in Birmingham but all the journos on the ground reckon we’ll have play after a slight delay. Don’t worry. We’re getting a result. Of that I’m certain.

Ryan believes Manaccan, who will be ridden by fellow Gooner Frankie Dettori , is the best horse he has ever trained. And he is hoping it brings a much-needed trophy for a team of Tottenham Hotspur supporters who make up the Ossie Ardiles syndicate that owns Manaccan. Argentinian World Cup winner Ardiles, who played for and managed Spurs, is also planning to be at the track to see the race. 'Although not quite on a par with the thrill of winning a World Cup it has been a terrific ride in the syndicate,' said Ardiles. 'Manaccan is a star and we believe he can do us all proud at the world's greatest horse race meeting. To make the winner's enclosure would certainly be a close third to winning the World Cup in 1978 and the FA Cup in 1981.' Gooners Frankie Dettori and John Ryan are trying to win a trophy for Spurs icon Ossie Ardiles Veteran jockey Frankie Dettori is set to ride Ryan-trained Manaccan at Royal Ascot on Tuesday Ardiles claims winning the King's Stand would be third only behind the World Cup and FA Cup Ryan added: 'Manaccan is as well as I have had him. He looks a picture and a little bit of luck on the day would not go astray. There will be a few faces in the paddock with the football crew and it is lovely to be associated with them. It is great to be able to find them a horse good enough to take them to a place like Royal Ascot.' Winning the King's Stand would be a fairy tale for the 20-strong Ossie Ardiles Syndicate, formed of friends who share a Spurs corporate hospitality box. The group's newly recruited racing followers are professionals with legal, media, medical and shipping backgrounds. The syndicate, which started in November 2021, was the idea of lifelong Spurs fan Graham Smith-Bernal who owns the renowned Newsells Park Stud in Royston. Smith-Bernal persuaded his fellow Spurs fans in the box to diversify their sporting interests by getting into horse racing, partly on the premise that they might have a better chance of winning something. Membership of the stud's syndicates are by invitation, with Newsells retaining at least 25 per cent of the shares in each syndicate, thereby maintaining an alignment of interests between Newsells and the syndicate members. Manaccan is one of six horses racing for the syndicate, with the membership including the local Newsells Park vicar to add her prayers to the dreams of glory. Smith-Bernal said: 'Nothing fazes Manaccan. He saves all his energy for his racing. He is the most chilled horse I have owned. He's incredibly honest and will leave nothing in the locker.' Dettori, 52 and riding his last Royal Ascot, has been keen to maintain his partnership with Manaccan after he finished third on the colt on unsuitably soft ground at Newmarket last month. The 5-1 third favourite made significant progress through the ranks last season when he won the Listed Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster as well as the Listed Rous Stakes at Ascot, one of two wins at the course from only three starts there. Ryan, who is hoping the thunderstorms that could hit Ascot fail to materialise, said: 'Manaccan is the best I have had by far. I have been lucky to have a couple of Group-winning sprinters but nothing anything in his league. 'Ryan Moore has won on him but he has commitments to other people which is why we booked Frankie to ride him in last month's Palace House Stakes so that he could stay with him at Royal Ascot.'

The partnership, initially signed back in 2020, was due to expire this summer but UK-based firm has opted to extend its deal with the Reds in what is a boost for the club’s commercial efforts and another sign of commercial partners being pleased with their activations with the Reds, following on from extended deals with , Expedia and EA Sports over the past 12 months. The renewed partnership will remain focused on growing the Liverpool FC Works Programme over the coming years of the extension, with the hope of helping even more young people from the Liverpool City Region to prepare for the world of work. Cadbury are also focusing on providing ‘bigger and better’ experiences for fans ahead of the firm’s 200th birthday celebrations next year. At the start of the original partnership Cadbury created a limited-edition Liverpool FC Champions Dairy Milk bar, which was available to purchase through official club stores. Proceeds from the sale of these bars were donated to the Liverpool FC Virtual Employability Programme, providing £25,000 to launch the initiative. In addition to the money raised, Cadbury employees have been volunteering as mentors on the Programme, providing real-world business knowledge and advice to participants. Ben Latty, commercial director at , said: “I am delighted to announce the extension of our partnership with Cadbury. Cadbury has shown its commitment to providing for our local community, working closely with the LFC Foundation on the LFC Works Programme. “We look forward to continuing to work together and strengthening our meaningful partnership further over the next three years.” The extension of another partnership for the Reds is telling from a business perspective, with the club having been focused on attracting and retaining major blue-chip brands as sponsors and continuing to grow not only the value of those deals cycle after cycle but also offering these companies the kind of engagement that they seek aside from simply selling ad space on pitch hoardings, on shirts and training wear or on the club website. Daniel Haddad, head of commercial strategy at global sports firm Octagon, recently: “A lot of people from outside the industry may always be looking at the size of the newest deal and getting new partners on board, but we are seeing with a couple of clubs that if your big, long-term premium sponsors don’t want to renew their deals then going back out to market to find a replacement can be very difficult because it is a highly competitive market. “If you are a club selling your major assets such as shirt sponsorship, sleeve and training kit etc, then at any one time there is going to be some of your competitors selling similar assets. You have got Formula One that is becoming more global and doing really well (commercially) at the moment, and you have got UEFA and the Champions League. “On some of those bigger partnerships what you want to do is grow them organically over time through extension and expansion rather than finding new partners. What Liverpool have done very well is servicing partners once they are on board and it does speak to the power of the global Liverpool fan-base that once a brand has decided to invest in Liverpool and after spending a few years and activating the partnership, it really does suggest that they buy into what Liverpool say about themselves. That really is the cornerstone of any successful sponsorship model. “There will always be partners and brands that just come and go. Global economic conditions and things that happen within businesses that are unpredictable, but if you can retain 60-70 per cent of your sponsors when the contracts come up for renewal then you are looking at consistent organic growth over time.”","pubDate":"2023-06-20 10:28:31","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26766032.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1465626100.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Arsenal ahead of Man Utd & Chelsea as they advance in transfer that could be club’s record sale","link":"https://www.caughtoffside.com/2023/06/20/romeo-lavia-to-arsenal-transfer-talks-advancing-romano/","keywords":["Arsenal FC","Championship","Chelsea FC","Extra Time","Features - NewsNow","Football and Soccer","Manchester United FC","Mobile App Stories","Premier League","Southampton FC","Transfer News","Fabrizio Romano","Romeo Lavia"],"creator":["Mark Brus"],"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal are reportedly advancing in their efforts to clinch the transfer of Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia this summer.The highly-rated young Belgium international just had a hugely impressive season in the Premier League in the campaign just gone, even if his displays weren’t quite enough to help the Saints survive relegation.With Southampton’s drop to the Championship, […] The post Arsenal ahead of Man Utd & Chelsea as they advance in transfer that could be club’s record sale appeared first on CaughtOffside.","content":"The highly-rated young Belgium international just had a hugely impressive season in the Premier League in the campaign just gone, even if his displays weren’t quite enough to help the Saints survive relegation.

Gyokeres joined the club from Brighton in January 2021, initially on loan, after spending the first half of the season on loan at Swansea.

That is not how it works and won't happen in this situation. \"When a player moves, they have to agree their terms with a different club, and the selling club have to agree a compensation package. If both of those don't work, then nothing will happen.\" Asked if he was disappointed by the comments Gyokeres made, King replied: \"To some degree. Obviously, he's been on social media and made his comments clear. \"He's had a great season and is now playing international football. We bought the player, he's had two good seasons with us, we're still in the championship, and, from my perspective, he's on another year. \"If Coventry City want to decide to have him on that other year as it's more important for us to try and get in the Premier League, then that is something that he has to get into his mind. \"Obviously, then he would become a free agent, and everybody would say that's a bit mad. But the reality is that isn't all one sided. \"We'll see how that plays out. I don't like these things being worked around into the press.

Last season was a tense one for Everton, with Sean Dyche's side just about securing Premier League safety with a 1-0 win on the final day of the campaign. The Toffees finished just two points away from the relegation zone, and they will be hoping for better fortune in the 2023/24 campaign. Everton face just one of the so-called 'big six' teams in their opening eight league games before visiting Anfield in the first Merseyside derby of the season on October 21. The toughest period for Dyche's side appears to be between November and December on paper, facing Man United, Newcastle, Chelsea, Tottenham and Man City all in the space of seven games. So, how could Everton perform in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign? Let's take a look. To set up this simulation, we used the Football Manager 2023 editor to update the Premier League with the latest teams, transfers and of course, the confirmed fixtures. Using FM23 to run the simulation, we then simulated the entire 2023/24 season to see how the Toffees got on. Everton got off to the perfect start in the 2023/24 season, picking up three points and a clean sheet against Fulham. Dominic Calvert-Lewin bagged a brace to secure a 2-0 win over the Cottagers, with Jordan Pickford having a great game in goal. February was the best month of the season for the Toffees, with Dyche picking up manager of the month as Everton won three and drew one, including their biggest victory of the campaign. James Tarkowski, Calvert-Lewin, Dwight McNeil and Alex Iwobi all got on the scoresheet to secure a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace in the simulation. After picking up a shock point away to Man City last season, Everton managed one better in the simulation, beating the Premier League champions 2-1 at the Etihad. After going behind early on, Iwobi and Ellis Simms both scored to claim the three points. The Toffees managed to pick up one point out of six against Merseyside rivals Liverpool in the simulation, with the Reds proving the dominant force at Anfield. Demari Gray cancelled out Mohamed Salah's opener to draw 1-1 at Goodison Park, but Everton were unable to get anything from the reverse fixture, losing 2-0 at Anfield. It was a disappointing end to the season for Everton, with Dyche's side falling to a heavy defeat away to Arsenal. An awful first-half showing saw the Gunners go 4-0 up, and it remained that way until the full-time whistle. Everton ended the Premier League campaign very poorly, winning just two of their final 12 games of the season. But, a strong run of results in the middle of the season saw Dyche's side pick up enough points to claim Premier League safety, finishing 13th in the table. All three promoted teams were relegated, with Burnley picking up 30 points in 18th, 13 points fewer than Everton managed. 12 wins, seven draws and 19 defeats saw Dyche's side earn 43 points, with the Toffees securing safety with a few games remaining. Overall, according to Football Manager 2023's Premier League simulation for the 2023/24 campaign, Everton could improve on last season, managing seven more points and securing Premier League safety in a much calmer manner. The Toffees struggled with the fixtures at the end of the season, but Dyche's side found their best form around Christmas time.","pubDate":"2023-06-20 09:40:50","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27152262.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_GettyImages-1494344236.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"«Челси» купил Нкунку у «Лейпцига» за 60+ млн евро.

That’s according to , who is reporting that the new package offered by the Gunners is worth a guaranteed £55m plus an extra £5m in bonuses. The offer comes after Arsenal saw a bid of £50m rejected by Chelsea last week.

According to , Al-Khelaifi is personally keen to sign Kane this summer regardless of who succeeds Christophe Galtier as manager. The 29-year-old is entering the final year of his current Tottenham deal and has been the subject of interest from clubs across Europe. The report from Le Parisien goes on to claim that PSG are also targeting a big-money move for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, but the former Lille man isn't keen on a return to Ligue 1. have also been linked with a move for the England international. Chelsea’s financial fair play problems are reportedly set to be eased by the significant investment of Saudi Arabia, in a warning for Liverpool and other rivals. That’s according to , who are reporting that Kalidou Koulibaly, Hakim Ziyech and Edouard Mendy are among the players in talks to move to the Kingdom on lucrative deals. The report goes on to say that Romelu Lukaku and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are both subjects of strong interest from Saudi Arabia.

I like it . @danielgallan hello to the Dan-ster! Equally fascinating will be the response to the days events. E.g. Stokes' declaration will either be a \"statement of intent\" or \"foolhardy hubris\" depending on whether England wins or loses. The narrative seems massive — notjarvis (@notjarvis) June 20, 2023 5m ago 10.48 BST Loads of chat about YJB and Foakes: Timothy Sanders from Leeds: “I think Barney is right, that ‘it would be progressive, not regressive, to bring Foakes into this team’, in line with England’s philosophy of how to play Test cricket. If it’s about having fun, taking twenty wickets, and showing the paying public your very best skills, then surely the practical application of Bazball means picking your very best wicketkeeper? I say go with Foakes as the way for this team to live its values. Then they just have to decide on the best 5 from the 6 batters!” Stephen Brown who has offered ‘Big Dan’ as a nickname: “For me, Foakes should be in the team. Having a very good wicket keeper vs a good wicket keeper can be worth having another batter who averages 40-50 in the team. And who wouldn’t want to add that? So the question becomes, who do you leave out? Weirdly, I’d say the person underperforming their playing role in the team the most over the last year might actually be Stokes. But we can’t exactly drop him and let him captain from the touchlines. Which means the solution is probably to let Bairstow open. Ducket has more runs as an opener under Stokes than Crawly despite playing half the games, so he should probably be given the first shot of opening alongside Bairstow.” Joe Roberts: “If it is true that Bairstow must be in the side due to last year’s heroics, it is also true that Crawley has done very little to justify his place in this side, having contributed very little to the success over the last 12 months. Not to mention that Foakes has been a vital part of that success, not just with the gloves, but with the bat as well, and surely warrants the same treatment as Bairstow.” Tom Nolan: “ Crawley out for Foakes with YJB opening? Won‘t happen after Crawley‘s first innings knock here but seems a logical way to get Foakes and Bairstow into the same side.” Geoff Wignall with a another whacky idea: “My new solution would be someone with sound defensive technique yet capable of serious aggression who isn’t scoring many in his current slot: one Ben Stokes.” 12m ago 10.40 BST Foakes for Brook? To be honest, I hadn’t considered that. But Richard O’Hagan makes an intersting point that has got me thinking: “I know that this will be controversial, but I think you have to choose between Bairstow and Brook. Brook came into the side as the replacement for the injured Bairstow and from a batting perspective they are probably on a par with one another, save that YJB is vastly more experienced. But at the same time the runs that England have conceded as a result of Bairstow’s rustiness with the gloves could well be the difference between winning and losing this Test, as they pretty much negate his contribution with the bat. For my money Foakes has to play and one of those two has to stand down if England are to have any chance of winning this series.” Let’s not forget that Foakes is still a brilliant batter. Sure he doesn’t have the firepower of Brook or Bairstow, but it’s not like he’s a mug with the willow. And if Ali plays (finger blister permitting) they still have the punch in the lower order. 16m ago 10.37 BST Email gremlins fixed: I wasn’t aware that the link to my email was broken. Should be sorted now. If you’ve been trying to get in touch but haven’t done so, please try again. 18m ago 10.35 BST This is a really, really long email from Simon in Cornwall . But with nothing going on, I’ll share it in it’s entirety with my two cents between each paragraph (yes, paragraph, strap in): “I have a question about the reverse ramp. How does the batter decide that that is the shot they are going to play? It seems that they get into position for the shot so early that it can’t be based on the trajectory of the ball - does the batter decide before the ball is bowled that they are going to play that shot, and just commit? I get that you wouldn’t play it against an unpredictable spinner, and that you need some kind of predictability in the bowlers style - is there maybe some subtle thing in finger position or wrist action that makes the batter know it is a good shot selection? Or is it just hit and hope?” It has to be premeditated . Bowlers like Boland who put it on the same spot over and over again are particularly susceptible to being ramped. A lot of hit and hope for sure. “I’d also like to say something about Bazball. I think something that hasn’t been mentioned much is Ben Stokes’ struggles with mental health, and the fact that it seems to me that Bazball is an attempt by Stokes to take the parts of the game that may cause a player to struggle, and just…..remove them. Many elite sportspeople have suffered badly in this arena, and not just cricketers - see ‘The Edge’, about the 09-13 England team, but also Nick Kyrgios, Mark Selby, Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, and god knows how many others from years gone by.” Oh, Bazball is therapy. Or so said Barney Ronay in this wonderful piece . “The reason I have so much respect for this style of play is that it seems to me that after taking brave decisions to protect his own wellbeing over the years, Stokes has developed a style that extends this protection to his whole team. Stokes has a greater understanding of his teammates, and of the nature of leadership and sporting ambition than any leader I can think of, and this goes far beyond ‘finding a way to win’. Stokes has taken bold, innovative steps to protect, nurture and develop the whole person, not just their skills and sporting qualities, knowing full well that, coincidentally, this is how you get the best out of them.” Bold, innovative, daring, carefree . That’s why it' has captured so many people, win or lose. “Its interesting that the list of athletes I mention who have publicly struggled with their mental health are all proponents of individual sports (tennis, snooker, gymnastics, swimming), and this is the first example I know of where the thinking has been extended to a team sport. I see Gareth Southgate doing something similar, but in a gentler and less bold way, and the results there are fairly clear too. As someone who has had some pretty loopy mental health over the years, I can not tell you how much I respect what Stokes (and BmcC) is doing.” Mate, thank you for opening up. I reckon a lot of people reading this right now will relate. “The way England are playing will ripple outwards and change the way test cricket is played, and more importantly how it is perceived that it SHOULD be played, maybe even save the format from a spiral of stagnation and diminishing gate receipts as everyone rushes to whizzier formats, leaving a trail of broken and forgotten players who gave their all but failed in some way that comes to define them forever. I adore the man, and in true Bazball style, wish with all my heart that he stays true to his new methods through the whole series, even if it means we lose every test. It feels more important than that, to me.” Even football is hooked! “I understand that this isn’t how a lot of fans feel - the ‘win at all costs’ mentality is irresistible to a sports fan, even if that cost is the health and wellbeing of the very players they revere. Bazball reminds us all that athletes are people, and that people do their best work when they love what they are doing, are given freedom to express themselves and are respected for doing so. Bazball, to me, isn’t just a cricketing ideology, it’s not a cricketing tactic, and its certainly not the new-age, man-feeling, bro-vibes rubbish it can so easily be dismissed as. Its an affirmation of the humanity at the heart of cricket, of sport, and of competition, and I hope it lasts forever. Or at least til the end of the fifth test. ” And let’s not forget that England were rubbish before Bazball . This is not simply the unshackling of players but also a cohesive strategy to get the best out of a talented group. It’s daring and brave, but also calculated (even if it doesn’t always seem that way). Thank you for a brilliant mail. I really enjoyed that. 25m ago 10.27 BST “Hi Dan. Looking forward to a cracking day’s play!” Me too, Damian Johnson , let’s hope we get enough of it. “Regards Bairstow/Foakes, YJB is allowed one bad game I would say, and horses for courses, Foakes stays in contention for tours in Asia or the driest of dry wickets. “If he were to come in, any of the top 3 should be under pressure and this includes Pope who never seems to be mentioned despite a highly mediocre record, especially against the big boys. Don’t get me wrong, cracking looking batter but he never seems to be under any pressure - is this a Surrey thing!?” Hmmm. I’m not sure it’s a Surrey thing. If that was the case then Foakes would be playing. Pope is class. No doubt about that. I saw him score a coming of age ton against South Africa in Gqeberha. He’ll be alright in the long run.

And would love to know what you think about the Bairstow-Foakes debate. For my money, Young JB has to play. He’s just so destructive with the bat. But there’s no question Foakes is the outstanding keeper in the country. Does that mean Duckett drops out? But then who opens? Should Pope make way? Ludicrous!

It began on a road and saw Joe Root unfurl a sumptuous century before the bucket-hatted Ben Stokes declared on the first day. Then Usman Khawaja batted and batted and batted until he was given a sweary send-off by Ollie Robinson . Did it cross the line? Have these lines ever existed? Are the Aussies now the meek ones in this ancient relationship? Root attempted a reverse scoop from the first ball of day three . Pat Cummins was outstanding. Nathan Lyon picked up a four-for. Moeen Ali’s finger fell apart. Stuart Broad did Stuart Broad things and now, as we begin this final day of an epic battle, Australia need 174 runs and England need seven wickets. There are echoes of 2005 and the narrow two run win for England that helped ignite the greatest Ashes in living memory. If the past four days are anything to go by, we might have a contender to that particular title. My name is Daniel, but in this Bazball age you can call me Dan, Danny Boy or frankly any other whacky nickname you like (please don’t make me regret that). There’s rain about in Birmingham but all the journos on the ground reckon we’ll have play after a slight delay. Don’t worry. We’re getting a result. Of that I’m certain.

'Manaccan is a star and we believe he can do us all proud at the world's greatest horse race meeting. To make the winner's enclosure would certainly be a close third to winning the World Cup in 1978 and the FA Cup in 1981.' Gooners Frankie Dettori and John Ryan are trying to win a trophy for Spurs icon Ossie Ardiles Veteran jockey Frankie Dettori is set to ride Ryan-trained Manaccan at Royal Ascot on Tuesday Ardiles claims winning the King's Stand would be third only behind the World Cup and FA Cup Ryan added: 'Manaccan is as well as I have had him. He looks a picture and a little bit of luck on the day would not go astray. There will be a few faces in the paddock with the football crew and it is lovely to be associated with them. It is great to be able to find them a horse good enough to take them to a place like Royal Ascot.' Winning the King's Stand would be a fairy tale for the 20-strong Ossie Ardiles Syndicate, formed of friends who share a Spurs corporate hospitality box. The group's newly recruited racing followers are professionals with legal, media, medical and shipping backgrounds. The syndicate, which started in November 2021, was the idea of lifelong Spurs fan Graham Smith-Bernal who owns the renowned Newsells Park Stud in Royston. Smith-Bernal persuaded his fellow Spurs fans in the box to diversify their sporting interests by getting into horse racing, partly on the premise that they might have a better chance of winning something. Membership of the stud's syndicates are by invitation, with Newsells retaining at least 25 per cent of the shares in each syndicate, thereby maintaining an alignment of interests between Newsells and the syndicate members. Manaccan is one of six horses racing for the syndicate, with the membership including the local Newsells Park vicar to add her prayers to the dreams of glory. Smith-Bernal said: 'Nothing fazes Manaccan. He saves all his energy for his racing. He is the most chilled horse I have owned. He's incredibly honest and will leave nothing in the locker.' Dettori, 52 and riding his last Royal Ascot, has been keen to maintain his partnership with Manaccan after he finished third on the colt on unsuitably soft ground at Newmarket last month. The 5-1 third favourite made significant progress through the ranks last season when he won the Listed Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster as well as the Listed Rous Stakes at Ascot, one of two wins at the course from only three starts there. Ryan, who is hoping the thunderstorms that could hit Ascot fail to materialise, said: 'Manaccan is the best I have had by far. I have been lucky to have a couple of Group-winning sprinters but nothing anything in his league. 'Ryan Moore has won on him but he has commitments to other people which is why we booked Frankie to ride him in last month's Palace House Stakes so that he could stay with him at Royal Ascot.'
