The England international team-mates both extended a hand but barely looked at each other before attentions turned to the . Arms were at full extension between the defender and playmaker - and fans noticed. Following the 1-0 win thanks to Gabriel Martinelli, an Arsenal fan posted with a clip of White vs Foden: \"Foden and Ben White having a frosty handshake at the end. Definitely don’t like each other.\" The incident came after a much nastier clash between pair last season, with Foden shoving the former Brighton man with two arms before being split up. On that occasion Haaland charged towards the 26-year-old to have his say, as he did to assist Walker on Sunday. The disagreement reportedly began when Arsenal set-piece coach Nicolas Jover tried to shake the hand of City skipper Walker. Jover, who used to work at City, was reportedly not keen to do the same after Arsenal lost the crunch fixture towards the end of last season. Keeping quiet after the match, Pep Guardiola declined to tell the media of the details - but amiddted that he did know them. He said: \"I know what happened, but I don't want to say anything.\" Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C £22 a month The three points put Arsenal level on points with rivals at the top of the table going into the international break. City sit two points behind following consecutive defeats including a shock loss at Wolves last weekend. Although Foden, 23, has been named in the England squad, White missed out after being sent home from the back in December.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 20:12:06","image_url":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31147481.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_Reason-behind-Erling-Haaland-and-Kyle-Walkers-furious-bust-up-after-Man-City-lost-at-Arsenal.jpg","source_id":"dailystar","source_priority":3076,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"021ddcb0ce24e2cc47b49f54d8e12fae","title":"Mute response to war exposes football’s complex relationship with geopolitics | Barney Ronay","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/09/israel-hamas-war-premier-league-football-geopolitics-saudi-arabia","keywords":["Premier League","David Beckham","Football","Hamas","Israel","Qatar","Sport","Football politics"],"creator":["Barney Ronay"],"video_url":null,"description":"The game is now tangled up in tides of mutual enmity and alliance – this is what sportswashing looks like, it turns outDavid Beckham is clearly a very complex man, or at least a very complex set of overlapping brand identities.

A few months back Beckham addressed a rapt audience at a St John’s Wood synagogue about the foundational importance of Judaism in his life. “I am part of the Jewish community,” Beckham announced, going on to talk about eating chicken soup and wearing a kippah at family functions. Every aspect of Beckham’s public image is minutely managed. Identity is very important to public figures. This part of him seems to be something he wants to project to the world. With this in mind, and in view of the horrendous events of the past week , Beckham will perhaps feel some kind of logical contradiction in the fact he, like Hamas, is the beneficiary of Qatari money. No need for conspiracies, World Cup 2030 and 2034 are a plot in plain sight | Barney Ronay Read more Beckham was paid a reported £125m by the state of Qatar to act as a PR agent for its operations in the foreign policy area of football . Hamas is, according to some detailed reporting, in receipt of hundreds of millions of pounds of Qatari money that is, it is said, directed to administrative support, aid and resources for impoverished families. Safe to say, concern for the Jewish community is not a key part of the Hamas operation. No doubt some will see a contradiction in this. Here we have a serial borrower of other people’s causes. See for example Beckham’s disposable allyship with LGBTQ+ people, another deep personal conviction discarded like an oversized 1990s leather jacket in the face of cold hard cash from a state where homosexuality is criminalised. The more sympathetic view is that this is a deeply compromised area for all sport, and for football in particular. Certainly the Premier League faces a high-jeopardy straddling of the political and cultural divide it has opened up in pursuit of its rapacious commercial aims. There was no moment of solidarity before Premier League matches at the weekend towards the victims of the sudden escalation of violence in Gaza and Israel . Five Sunday fixtures were played out a day after the first rocket barrage, without a moment of silence or a message on a placard. Understandably so, in practical terms. It takes time to agree such things. Premier League owners are not, in fact, engaged in a constant speed-dial Zoom call to debate issues of political messaging. As things stand, the Premier League has no plans to make any statement of support or to offer any visible sign of sympathy. Some would suggest there is very little actual substance to such messaging in any case. Recent times have brought matchday recognition of events as diverse as the tragic earthquakes in Morocco, the floods in Libya, the war in Ukraine, a train crash in Greece and the death of John Motson. There is a danger of entering a multi-event grief Olympics here, with ever decreasing effects each time. But the thing is, once you start doing this, or indeed refrain from doing it, that choice becomes significant too. A flag expressing support for Ukraine displayed at the Emirates Stadium in August. Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty Images This is not the place to even begin trying to resolve the cause and effect of historical blame. Safe to say events this weekend are the latest chapter in a horror story, with an entire history of Palestinian blood being shed. But the current escalation has killed more than a thousand civilians in three days, with talk of kidnap, babies taken from their mothers, of more than 200 slaughtered while attending a music festival. Many British citizens are directly affected. This is not the death of a football commentator. Football, meanwhile, is the world’s messaging system. It does take sides and offer solace. The Premier League had a view straight away on Ukraine and Russia, under instruction from the British government. The response here will be silence. At which point devastatingly complex tides of ownership and influence begin to crowd in at the edge of the picture. In recent years football has simply rolled over and invited ambitious state-backed actors to divvy up its internal organs in return for yet another revenue stream. So we end up with the current situation. A day after the surge in violence began the biggest game in the world that weekend was played out at the Emirates Stadium without mention or sympathy, at a time when mention and sympathy are undeniably the fashion. As for the optics, well, the optics are frankly bizarre. Arsenal’s home stadium is literally called the Emirates, which has its own neighbourly connection to the regional strife involving Israel and Palestine. The game was broadcast on the Qatari state TV channel BeIN Sports, a key Premier League rights holder. Manchester City are owned by Abu Dhabi, an emirate with its own complex relationship with Israel, most recently the thawing relations that have drawn a separate hostility from Iran. Any discussion of how to mark the outbreak of a new and brutal war will also involve input from the sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia – one of 20 board members in the English top tier as owners of Newcastle United – which has its own complex intersection with all parties. Premier League clubs ask government to block nation-state ownership Read more Saudi has been trying to normalise its relations with Israel, which is seen as a potential background element in the sudden escalation. Saudi is also one of three regional powers, along with Qatar and Iran, to publicly lay the blame for the violence at Israel’s door. Is a statement of support for murdered civilians ever going to be possible in this scenario given the political pressures, given the fact Saudi will in effect be putting its name to such a message? There are endlessly tangled tides of enmity and alliance here. Manchester United are in negotiations to be bought outright by a Qatari. Saudi’s fund also has a hand in the consortium that owns Chelsea (although, we are assured, with zero overlap). The Premier League has willingly thrown its doors open to this tornado of political influence, where such interests are now not just inside the building but sitting at the top table. This is what sportswashing looks like, it turns out. Not just influence and visibility, but an arm of bloody international relations right on your doorstep, dressed in your colours, still couched, dimly, behind the idea – laughter in the dark here – of sport as a force for good.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 20:00:19","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6ee1b3df0fbc66fe346014a9384a5acb6afee9/0_408_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b10a30ee893403dddc7f1620c7fa3ad7","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c5a5ee214fa0ec45806119080174056f","title":"Football Fans Suffer from Annoying 'Sun Outages' During Weekend Games","link":"https://www.westernjournal.com/football-fans-suffer-annoying-sun-outages-weekend-games/","keywords":["Commentary","Sports","Colleges and universities","ESPN","Oklahoma Sooners","sports","Texas Longhorns","U.S. News"],"creator":["Johnathan Jones"],"video_url":null,"description":"College football fans who experienced signal disruptions during ABC’s coverage of the annual Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas — and other events — now have an explanation for […] The post Football Fans Suffer from Annoying 'Sun Outages' During Weekend Games appeared first on The Western Journal.","content":"College football fans who experienced signal disruptions during ABC’s coverage of the annual Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas — and other events — now have an explanation for the network’s technical issues. The problem is due to the time of year and the placement of relative to their location to the sun. The phenomenon is blamed on something called a “sun outage.” I experienced the issue firsthand during the first and second quarters of the annual rivalry game, which was broadcast from the Cotton Bowl in from the Texas State Fair. My Oklahoma Sooners were up 7-0 with 11:58 on the game clock in the opening quarter when Texas lined up to punt deep in its own territory. There was one issue for fans of both teams, as well as casual viewers: The Longhorns faked the punt and converted it for a huge gain as the signal cut out. The Oklahoma-Texas ESPN on ABC broadcast has been full of technical difficulties, including right in the middle of this fake punt from the Longhorns. 🏈📺😵‍💫 — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) Moments later, another signal disruption had me screaming, “SOMEONE KEEPS UNPLUGGING SOMETHING!” At the time, officials were trying to determine if tight end Gunnar Helm had fumbled following a dime of a pass from quarterback Quinn Ewers. Texas kept the ball but Ewers quickly threw his second interception of the first quarter a few plays later. I would be committing the crime of omission if I didn’t mention the fact that Texas blocked an OU punt in the end zone for an easy special teams touchdown moments later. But what about those annoying signal issues? Chris Fowler finally explained to viewers that no rogue employee was behind the issue, nor was anyone in the broadcast booth playing with any equipment. “We apologize. We’re dealing with some serious technical issues,” the ESPN commentator said. Fowler added, “It’s a power issue. Our crew is as good as any trying to get things in terms of the cameras and microphones back up and running.” “We apologize; we’re dealing with some serious technical issues (on this Oklahoma-Texas ESPN on ABC broadcast)… It’s a power issue. Our crew is as good as any trying to get things in terms of the cameras and microphones back up and running.”- Chris Fowler — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) The problems for didn’t end there. At one point later in the game, the signal was so porous that my TV was showing the game cut in half with what was supposed to be the bottom of the feed at the top and vice versa. It really added an unnecessary layer to the drama of the game — which is one of the best rivalries in that this year happened to match up two of the best teams in the country. Front Office Sports explained the reason for the broadcast problems. “Your TV isn’t broken,” the account posted. “For the next few days, the Earth and Disney satellite are in direct line with the sun — causing a ‘sun outage’ and brief interruptions on ESPN.” Your TV isn’t broken. For the next few days, the Earth and Disney satellite are in direct line with the sun — causing a “sun outage” and brief interruptions on ESPN: — Front Office Sports (@FOS) previously explained a bit more about sun outages and when they were expected to occur this year: “Sun outages occur every year, in Fall and Spring, and last approximately about a week each time. This Fall, sun outages are expected between October 4th and October 14th, 2023. “The exact time and duration will vary from channel to channel. This is due to channels being received off different satellites in the arc. Each satellite is affected at a different time as the sun moves across the satellite arc. The approximate times for signal loss will be between 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM ET and will last for approximately five to fifteen minutes depending on the size of the dish.” That certainly explains why and Texas had so many technical issues, given the game kicked off at 12 p.m. ET. In the end, Oklahoma after a last-minute touchdown drive led by quarterback Dillon Gabriel. But it was anyone’s game, even with two seconds left. Texas and Oklahoma could meet in Dallas again in December for the Big 12 Championship. That is if both teams win the remainder of their games before they head off for the Southeastern Conference together next year. A potential rematch would bring plenty of big plays, controversial calls and overall drama. But it looks like the signal issues wouldn’t be a problem.

Ο Ουρουγουανός τόνισε πως επικεντρώνεται σε όσους είναι στην ομάδα και όχι σε αυτούς που λείπουν, επισήμανε πως περιμένει από τους παίκτες του να παλέψουν και στα δύο ματς ενώ δεν έκρυψε πως περιμένει κι ένα… δώρο από τη Γαλλία. «Νομίζω πως είναι ξεκάθαρο. Ξέρουμε τι πρέπει να περιμένουμε και θα πρέπει να προετοιμαστούμε από σήμερα σε συγκεκριμένα πράγματα. Είναι ένα πολύ σημαντικό παιχνίδι. Ελπίζω πως θα είμαστε σε μια καλή κατάσταση για να φέρουμε ένα επιθυμητό αποτέλεσμα. Παράλληλα να κοιτάμε και τι γίνεται και στο άλλο παιχνίδι, ώστε να έρθει η Δευτέρα και να μιλάμε για έναν τελικό κόντρα στην Ολλανδία». «Όπως έχει πει από την αρχή είναι αλήθεια. Η πόρτα της Εθνικής είναι ανοικτή για όλους τους ποδοσφαιριστές. Εξαρτάται από το χρόνο, τη στιγμή, τους τραυματισμούς που έχουμε, αλλά και το τι χρειάζεται η Εθνική σε κάποια παιχνίδια. Προσπαθούμε να έχουμε παίκτες που θα μας βοηθήσουν. Είμαι χαρούμενος που επέστρεψε ο Διούδης, αλλά και για τους Σάλιακα και Γαλανόπουλο που έρχονται για πρώτη φορά με εμένα. Δίνουν στην ομάδα διαφορετική ποιότητα και θα προσπαθήσω να τους χρησιμοποιήσω. Ελπίζω ότι τον Μάρτιο όταν θα έχουν ολοκληρωθεί τα προκριματικά και με την ελπίδα ότι η Εθνική μας θα είναι στο Euro, θα είμαστε σε θέση να επιλέξουμε τους 23/25 παίκτες γι’ αυτό το τουρνουά». «Ναι ξέρουμε πως ειδικά τα πρώτα 20 λεπτά θα είναι πάρα πολύ έντονα. Πρέπει να παίξουμε έξυπνα. Εφόσον το παιχνίδι μετά ηρεμήσει, θα πρέπει να κάνουμε το παιχνίδι μας». «Όχι, κανείς δεν ασχολείται με την Ολλανδία, κανείς. Επικεντρωνόμαστε στο παιχνίδι με την Ιρλανδία. Να έχουμε την καλύτερη δυνατή ομάδα που θα παίξει. Θα πρέπει εμείς να πάρουμε τη νίκη και αν η Γαλλία μας δώσει ένα χέρι βοηθείας, τότε είναι ευπρόσδεκτο». «Δεν νομίζω ότι χρειάζεται να πάρουμε μεγαλύτερο ρίσκο. Από τα 16 παιχνίδια με εμένα, επίσημα και φιλικά, έχουμε κερδίσει τα εννιά και από τα 11 επίσημα παιχνίδια έχουμε κερδίσει τα οκτώ. Αυτό θέλω να κρατήσουμε. Πρέπει να είμαστε θετικοί και ρεαλιστές. Τη στιγμή στην οποία είμαστε τώρα σε σχέση με το που ήμασταν πριν. Να κρατήσουμε αυτό στο μυαλό μας και να σκεφτόμαστε θετικά και με το καλό μόλις βρεθούμε στο Euro, να συνεχίσουμε από εκεί για το τι μπορούμε να κάνουμε στο μέλλον. Μπορεί να κερδίσουμε τα τρία επόμενα ματς και να είμαστε με 18 βαθμούς και αντίστοιχα να βρεθούμε εκτός, λόγω της ήττας στον πρώτο αγώνα με την Ολλανδία που επίσης μπορεί να έχει 18 βαθμούς. Αυτό θα ήταν φοβερό. Θέλουμε λίγη βοήθεια αλλά η πρώτη μας δουλειά είναι να πάρουμε τους τρεις βαθμούς με την Ιρλανδία». «Ξέραμε για τον κίνδυνο με τα στημένα. Φάγαμε γκολ στα πρώτα δευτερόλεπτα μετά από κόρνερ. Αυτό είναι ένα καλό μάθημα. Οπότε είναι καλό όταν έχεις ένα παιχνίδι και ξέρεις τι να περιμένεις και τι θα συμβεί, γίνεται αυτό και καταφέρνεις να βγεις νικητής απ’ αυτό». «Προσπαθώ να σκέφτομαι θετικά. Έχουμε πολλά ζητήματα. Να ξεκινήσω με τον Βλαχοδήμο που είναι το «νούμερο ένα» για εμάς και δεν παίζει. Αν ήταν έτοιμος θα έπαιζε ο Μπάλντοκ που δεν είναι εδώ. Ο Μαυροπάνος δεν παίζει σε κάθε ματς. Ο Τσιμίκας δεν παίζει σε κάθε ματς. Είμαστε εμείς, αυτοί είμαστε. Όλα τα παιδιά είναι ικανοποιημένα που βρίσκονται εδώ, χαίρονται που είναι εδώ. Πρέπει να παλέψουμε και να εκπροσωπήσουμε τη χώρα μας. Εξαρτάται από εμάς, δεν τους νοιάζει τι κάνουν στις ομάδες τους εδώ είναι η Εθνική ομάδα». «Πολύ καλή ερώτηση. Έχω απάντηση σε δύο μέρη. Πρώτα απ’ όλα κοιτάμε παντού και τους πάντες. Δεν μπορείτε να φανταστείτε. Ακόμα και έναν παίκτη που είναι 19 ετών, ο οποίος δεν έχει την ελληνική υπηκοότητα και προσπαθούμε να τον πείσουμε να παίξει για την Εθνική. Και δεύτερον χαίρομαι που δεν ρωτήσατε για αυτούς που δεν είναι εδώ. Μπορείτε να ρωτάτε αν θέλετε, αλλά εγώ θα επικεντρώνομαι από εδώ και στο εξής για όσους όσους είναι εδώ. Μπορεί να είναι περίεργο. Να με ρωτάτε και να λέω κανένα σχόλιο. Όταν είμαι σε ένα κλαμπ επικεντρώνομαι στους παίκτες που είναι στην ομάδα και διαθέσιμοι και όχι στους τραυματίες, δεν παραπονιέμαι για αυτούς. Σπαταλώ την ενέργεια μου σε όσους είναι διαθέσιμοι για να παίξουν». «Πρώτα απ’ όλα για όσους ξέρουν το να είμαι προπονητής της Εθνικής Ελλάδας μου δίνει τη δυνατότητα να αναλύσω πολλά. Εκτός από την προετοιμασία που έκανα τους δύο τελευταίους μήνες για τα ματς με Ιρλανδία και Ολλανδία. Είδα αρκετά πως παίζουν και οι τρεις και ειδικότερα πως παίζουν οι ομάδες τους. Και να δω αν μπορούν να βοηθήσουν με συγκεκριμένο τρόπο. Οπότε το σκεφτόμαστε. Δεν είναι εύκολη απόφαση για μένα αλλά το έχουμε στο μυαλό μας». «Θα το απολαύσω. Γνωρίζω αυτές τις χώρες. Που έχουμε ξαναπάει και έχω ζήσει σαν ποδοσφαιριστής. Έχω μια ιδιαίτερη σχέση, αρκετούς πρώην παίκτες εκεί, και θα το απολαύσω ιδιαίτερα αν κερδίσουμε».

De Zerbi, who saw his side come back to draw for the second time in three days after Thursday’s Europa League meeting with Marseille, said that whilst he felt his team were hard done by over the decision, he believed the foul by Trent Alexander-Arnold on Solly March from which Brighton later equalised through Lewis Dunk should not have been a free-kick. “I love Klopp,” he said. “He can do what he wants because I have a big respect and I consider him one of the best coaches in the world. I like his behaviour, and when he says something, 99 per cent I agree with him. “In that situation, I think there was a clear penalty and I told the referee, I think in a good way, what I thought in the moment. “I think there was a penalty, but there wasn’t a foul when we scored the second goal. I’m honest, and I told Jurgen my opinion.” Brighton are sixth going into the international break having won five of their first eight Premier League games. De Zerbi has made an average of seven changes between matches this season as he seeks to navigate the demands made by a first season in Europe for the club. Stand Or Fall. 💙🤍 — Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) Despite recording a fourth winless game in a row in all competitions the manager praised his players’ character, particularly in the context of bouncing back from the 6-1 defeat against Aston Villa to register two comeback draws. “The most important thing for me has been the reaction after Villa Park,” he said. “We started the game in Marseille, one of the best stadiums in Europe, and we started losing 2-0. After that moment, there was only one team on the pitch – Brighton. “To do it, you have to show character, to show the right attitude, the right behaviour and passion. The most important thing in my idea of football is passion, is the character. “After that we can speak about tactical disposition, the quality of the players, recruitment. But without that part of football, in my opinion, you can’t play or work in football.”","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:19:45","image_url":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/resources/images/17314548/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"northwaleschronicle","source_priority":2822327,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a440ebb6293cb13e6dc07f49a4273e72","title":"Laura Woods' new Love Island boyfriend confirms romance with cosy Instagram snap","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/laura-woods-adam-collard-loveisland-31147231","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Laura Woods and Adam Collard have confirmed their relationship with an intimate social media snap after a romantic weekend away in Cornwall","content":"Laura Woods has confirmed her relationship with star Adam Collard by posing for a cosy Instagram snap.

Let’s face it, it did not take Poirot – or Wagatha Christie, if you prefer – to uncover Birmingham’s desire to bring in Rooney. Wayne Rooney set to take charge at Birmingham after Eustace is sacked Read more There has been a clamour at board level to make a big-name appointment since the US-based Shelby Companies Limited (SCL), fronted by the hedge fund manager Tom Wagner, completed the welcome purchase of the long-distressed club in July. Garry Cook, the Birmingham chief executive who was connected to Chris Kirchner’s failed takeover at Derby, Rooney’s last club on these shores, is driving the appointment process. Cook has close ties with Rooney’s longtime agent, Paul Stretford, and both were involved with Kirchner’s attempt to buy Derby. Birmingham made headlines in August when Tom Brady, the seven‑time Super Bowl champion, was announced as a minority owner and chairman of a new advisory board. At the time Birmingham trumpeted how the NFL superstar planned to make the club “a respected leader in nutrition, health, wellness and recovery” in world football and, before long, Brady was mingling with supporters at the Roost, a pub round the corner from the stadium. Investor Tom Brady watched Birmingham play Leeds at St Andrew’s in August. Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock Behind the scenes it has long felt a matter of when and not if Birmingham would make another high-profile addition, though Eustace taking 10 points from a possible 12 and going the first six weeks of the season unbeaten must have given the club hierarchy a headache. Nor was a 3-1 comeback home win against their city rivals West Brom last Friday the ideal platform for them to then pull the rug from Eustace. Birmingham, of course, have been here before. Midway through the 2016‑17 season they sacked Gary Rowett, with the club on the edge of the Championship playoffs, in favour of appointing Gianfranco Zola. It proved a disastrous call by then owners Trillion Trophy Asia, the former Chelsea striker lasting barely five months and plunging the club into relegation trouble. Zola, who has not managed since, was replaced by Harry Redknapp and Birmingham finished 19th, avoiding the drop on the final day. What is the old saying? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it? It is a turn of phrase Birmingham supporters will doubtless utter over the course of the coming days, the timeframe in which the club hierarchy say they will appoint a manager “responsible for creating an identity and clear ‘no fear’ playing style”, whatever that means. Birmingham certainly did not seem to be holding back as they scored seven goals across their past two games. Since Rowett’s sacking the club has had eight permanent managers in seven years. Eustace helped to provide Birmingham with an overdue sense of stability and unity, which, to the credit of Birmingham’s owners, was enhanced by SCL’s takeover. But Eustace should take most credit for overachieving on modest resources and simultaneously developing youngsters, evolving the team and restoring supporters’ faith in the club. It is not so long ago that protests by disillusioned fans dominated the discourse. Eustace, who spent time in Birmingham’s academy before leaving for Coventry at 16, helped to ensure they were being taken seriously again. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock At Birmingham’s St Andrew’s stadium, where a US flag now flies on top of the main stand, there have been plenty of false dawns, with Garry Monk, Pep Clotet and Aitor Karanka among those who tried and failed to restore the club to the top flight. It ended in tears for Lee Bowyer, another former player, too. Perhaps it is a good thing, then, that Rooney is familiar with choppy waters. He initially took interim charge at Derby as a player-manager in November 2020, then led the club admirably amid administration and the threat of liquidation, though his former assistant Liam Rosenior, now in charge of Championship rivals Hull City, took the majority of training sessions. If Rooney takes charge as expected, his first game will be at Middlesbrough, setting up a touchline duel with Michael Carrick, a former Manchester United and England teammate. All of this guarantees Rooney, universally recognised as one of the game’s greatest, will walk into a strange atmosphere. Rooney undoubtedly galvanised Derby throughout one of the most turbulent periods in their history but, to many, he will pitch up at Birmingham as something of an unwanted VIP guest.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:00:18","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71be60ed64888299a8879d0347de83e8610d5070/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ec1b30bda69da131ee0fcff7ddcbf0f","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d3891a206d4efe896b6145da9479e061","title":"Jude Bellingham’s artistry can take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/09/jude-bellingham-england-gareth-southgate-real-madrid","keywords":["England","Jude Bellingham","Gareth Southgate","Real Madrid","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Real Madrid midfielder is lighting up La Liga but must be given the freedom to inject some life into the national teamFirst you need the vision. “Around the pitch I want to be an artist,” Jude Bellingham says, which is the sort of quote that makes you double-take, because what footballer even talks about making art these days?

Well Geoff, at the end of the day it’s all about engaging in a search for deeper meaning, washing away from the soul the dust of everyday life, creating a new kind of sense where none previously existed.

When he’s trapped by the touchline and plotting his escape route. Or the shuffle that shifts the ball out of his feet and opens up whole new dimensions of possibility. You don’t know how this ends, because nor does he. Last week, the Spanish newspaper Marca published an entire article about Bellingham’s tongue. The gist was this: Bellingham’s tongue hangs out when he runs. Michael Jordan also stuck his tongue out. So did Einstein. So did the Rolling Stones logo. Conclusion: Bellingham = genius. And perhaps this is the sort of thing that happens when an athlete begins to inhabit a plane where people simply want to consume them, absorb them, plug them into their day like a glow lamp. Pastor Postecoglou shows importance of journey even if you never reach heaven | Jonathan Liew Read more Certainly there is a strange and devotional purity to the way Real Madrid fans have taken to Bellingham since his move this summer. It can’t just be the goals, because scoring goals isn’t really his job, and it can’t simply be the talent, because never in nine years at Madrid was Gareth Bale as adored. Perhaps it chimes with this idea of football as expression, football as a vehicle of joy, football as a journey without maps or endings. I don’t know if Bellingham is the best player in the world right now. But he’s undeniably the most evocative and joyful. At which point, with sighs, Bellingham must now peel off his superhero suit, slip on a blue training top and start playing sideways passes to Harry Maguire. And if Bellingham at Madrid is a love story in its first bloom, then Bellingham with England is a slightly more complex and awkward prospect. Here the window of possibility feels narrower, the demands sharper and more urgent. Inspire us. Transform us. Win us something. Take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better. Partly this is simply the nature of international football, a world defined by its abrupt endings and screeching climaxes, where absolutely nobody is trying to create art. But partly, too, it is the natural dissonance between a man so clearly at the start of his England journey and a man so clearly near the end of his. A man trying to create art, and a man trying to squeeze the last drops out of a job from which he already seems to be plotting his exit. In short: what happens when the most exuberant and exciting force in English football collides head-on with its least? ‘I want to be an artist on the pitch’: Jude Bellingham has already made a big impact at Real Madrid. Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images We caught a glimpse of this at Southgate’s squad announcement last week, when the England manager was asked about Bellingham’s recent displays for Madrid. “He’s been defending on the left wing in a couple of games,” Southgate said. “I can just imagine the reaction from all and sundry if I asked him to do that.” A joke, but a bitter joke, a telling and weirdly uncharitable joke, borne largely of ennui and resentment. And this appears to be the default Southgate tune these days, whether complaining about VAR or wincing in the face of questions about Saudi Arabia and LGBT rights: less the figurehead of a national team in the national sport, more a middle-ranking bank employee carefully explaining the pros and cons of an offset mortgage. And really this is not so much an issue of strategy as tone. Declan Rice will never be Luka Modric and Kalvin Phillips will never be Eduardo Camavinga, but the win over Scotland – albeit against weaker opposition in a friendly – was a good example of how to set Bellingham’s attacking threat loose without sacrificing cover. The wider problem here is the sense of sourness and indifference that began to set into Southgate’s England around the second half of 2021: a narrowing of horizons, a retreat from the expression and purpose that briefly made them one of the most thrilling England teams of my lifetime. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not really qualified to tell Southgate what formation to use or who he should deploy at midfield pivot. Handbrake on, handbrake off; whatever. But I do know that not long ago this was an England team that used to make you feel things, led by a man who seemed to embody the best of us. Somewhere along the line, ridiculously, a team containing Bellingham and Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish lost its ability to convey joy. And it probably happened when its coach, burned by one too many stinging criticisms, started fixating on endings. Fortunately, Southgate has a guy who gets it. Who wants to win as much as everyone, but wants to sweep people off their feet as he does it. Who understands how to connect with people, who wants to inspire and create. And perhaps ultimately Southgate’s legacy will be defined by the extent to which he can lean into the joy of Jude, to channel this generational talent and its world without limits. Because if Bellingham teaches us anything, it is that the best way of scripting the perfect ending is to play like there are no endings at all.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:00:18","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c30d0ce5a6b0000bf4c5837546f27172402b96/0_339_6079_3649/master/6079.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40c5614e9dbc85aec993078638a37b5c","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b509b9c6d691eea6538b5144ca37a10a","title":"Ben White centre of frosty incident moments before Haaland bust-up at Arsenal vs City","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/ben-white-arsenal-phil-foden-31147496","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal and Manchester City's late bust-up was preceded by an awkward moment between Ben White and Phil Foden with a less than friendly greeting","content":"Ben White shared an awkward moment with Phil Foden before and stars clashed at full-time.

A few months back Beckham addressed a rapt audience at a St John’s Wood synagogue about the foundational importance of Judaism in his life. “I am part of the Jewish community,” Beckham announced, going on to talk about eating chicken soup and wearing a kippah at family functions. Every aspect of Beckham’s public image is minutely managed. Identity is very important to public figures. This part of him seems to be something he wants to project to the world. With this in mind, and in view of the horrendous events of the past week , Beckham will perhaps feel some kind of logical contradiction in the fact he, like Hamas, is the beneficiary of Qatari money. No need for conspiracies, World Cup 2030 and 2034 are a plot in plain sight | Barney Ronay Read more Beckham was paid a reported £125m by the state of Qatar to act as a PR agent for its operations in the foreign policy area of football . Hamas is, according to some detailed reporting, in receipt of hundreds of millions of pounds of Qatari money that is, it is said, directed to administrative support, aid and resources for impoverished families. Safe to say, concern for the Jewish community is not a key part of the Hamas operation. No doubt some will see a contradiction in this. Here we have a serial borrower of other people’s causes. See for example Beckham’s disposable allyship with LGBTQ+ people, another deep personal conviction discarded like an oversized 1990s leather jacket in the face of cold hard cash from a state where homosexuality is criminalised. The more sympathetic view is that this is a deeply compromised area for all sport, and for football in particular. Certainly the Premier League faces a high-jeopardy straddling of the political and cultural divide it has opened up in pursuit of its rapacious commercial aims. There was no moment of solidarity before Premier League matches at the weekend towards the victims of the sudden escalation of violence in Gaza and Israel . Five Sunday fixtures were played out a day after the first rocket barrage, without a moment of silence or a message on a placard. Understandably so, in practical terms. It takes time to agree such things. Premier League owners are not, in fact, engaged in a constant speed-dial Zoom call to debate issues of political messaging. As things stand, the Premier League has no plans to make any statement of support or to offer any visible sign of sympathy. Some would suggest there is very little actual substance to such messaging in any case. Recent times have brought matchday recognition of events as diverse as the tragic earthquakes in Morocco, the floods in Libya, the war in Ukraine, a train crash in Greece and the death of John Motson. There is a danger of entering a multi-event grief Olympics here, with ever decreasing effects each time. But the thing is, once you start doing this, or indeed refrain from doing it, that choice becomes significant too. A flag expressing support for Ukraine displayed at the Emirates Stadium in August. Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty Images This is not the place to even begin trying to resolve the cause and effect of historical blame. Safe to say events this weekend are the latest chapter in a horror story, with an entire history of Palestinian blood being shed. But the current escalation has killed more than a thousand civilians in three days, with talk of kidnap, babies taken from their mothers, of more than 200 slaughtered while attending a music festival. Many British citizens are directly affected. This is not the death of a football commentator. Football, meanwhile, is the world’s messaging system. It does take sides and offer solace. The Premier League had a view straight away on Ukraine and Russia, under instruction from the British government. The response here will be silence. At which point devastatingly complex tides of ownership and influence begin to crowd in at the edge of the picture. In recent years football has simply rolled over and invited ambitious state-backed actors to divvy up its internal organs in return for yet another revenue stream. So we end up with the current situation. A day after the surge in violence began the biggest game in the world that weekend was played out at the Emirates Stadium without mention or sympathy, at a time when mention and sympathy are undeniably the fashion. As for the optics, well, the optics are frankly bizarre. Arsenal’s home stadium is literally called the Emirates, which has its own neighbourly connection to the regional strife involving Israel and Palestine. The game was broadcast on the Qatari state TV channel BeIN Sports, a key Premier League rights holder. Manchester City are owned by Abu Dhabi, an emirate with its own complex relationship with Israel, most recently the thawing relations that have drawn a separate hostility from Iran. Any discussion of how to mark the outbreak of a new and brutal war will also involve input from the sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia – one of 20 board members in the English top tier as owners of Newcastle United – which has its own complex intersection with all parties. Premier League clubs ask government to block nation-state ownership Read more Saudi has been trying to normalise its relations with Israel, which is seen as a potential background element in the sudden escalation. Saudi is also one of three regional powers, along with Qatar and Iran, to publicly lay the blame for the violence at Israel’s door. Is a statement of support for murdered civilians ever going to be possible in this scenario given the political pressures, given the fact Saudi will in effect be putting its name to such a message? There are endlessly tangled tides of enmity and alliance here. Manchester United are in negotiations to be bought outright by a Qatari. Saudi’s fund also has a hand in the consortium that owns Chelsea (although, we are assured, with zero overlap). The Premier League has willingly thrown its doors open to this tornado of political influence, where such interests are now not just inside the building but sitting at the top table. This is what sportswashing looks like, it turns out. Not just influence and visibility, but an arm of bloody international relations right on your doorstep, dressed in your colours, still couched, dimly, behind the idea – laughter in the dark here – of sport as a force for good.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 20:00:19","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6ee1b3df0fbc66fe346014a9384a5acb6afee9/0_408_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b10a30ee893403dddc7f1620c7fa3ad7","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c5a5ee214fa0ec45806119080174056f","title":"Football Fans Suffer from Annoying 'Sun Outages' During Weekend Games","link":"https://www.westernjournal.com/football-fans-suffer-annoying-sun-outages-weekend-games/","keywords":["Commentary","Sports","Colleges and universities","ESPN","Oklahoma Sooners","sports","Texas Longhorns","U.S. News"],"creator":["Johnathan Jones"],"video_url":null,"description":"College football fans who experienced signal disruptions during ABC’s coverage of the annual Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas — and other events — now have an explanation for […] The post Football Fans Suffer from Annoying 'Sun Outages' During Weekend Games appeared first on The Western Journal.","content":"College football fans who experienced signal disruptions during ABC’s coverage of the annual Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas — and other events — now have an explanation for the network’s technical issues.

The Oklahoma-Texas ESPN on ABC broadcast has been full of technical difficulties, including right in the middle of this fake punt from the Longhorns. 🏈📺😵‍💫 — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) Moments later, another signal disruption had me screaming, “SOMEONE KEEPS UNPLUGGING SOMETHING!” At the time, officials were trying to determine if tight end Gunnar Helm had fumbled following a dime of a pass from quarterback Quinn Ewers. Texas kept the ball but Ewers quickly threw his second interception of the first quarter a few plays later. I would be committing the crime of omission if I didn’t mention the fact that Texas blocked an OU punt in the end zone for an easy special teams touchdown moments later. But what about those annoying signal issues? Chris Fowler finally explained to viewers that no rogue employee was behind the issue, nor was anyone in the broadcast booth playing with any equipment. “We apologize. We’re dealing with some serious technical issues,” the ESPN commentator said. Fowler added, “It’s a power issue. Our crew is as good as any trying to get things in terms of the cameras and microphones back up and running.” “We apologize; we’re dealing with some serious technical issues (on this Oklahoma-Texas ESPN on ABC broadcast)… It’s a power issue. Our crew is as good as any trying to get things in terms of the cameras and microphones back up and running.”- Chris Fowler — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) The problems for didn’t end there. At one point later in the game, the signal was so porous that my TV was showing the game cut in half with what was supposed to be the bottom of the feed at the top and vice versa. It really added an unnecessary layer to the drama of the game — which is one of the best rivalries in that this year happened to match up two of the best teams in the country. Front Office Sports explained the reason for the broadcast problems. “Your TV isn’t broken,” the account posted. “For the next few days, the Earth and Disney satellite are in direct line with the sun — causing a ‘sun outage’ and brief interruptions on ESPN.” Your TV isn’t broken. For the next few days, the Earth and Disney satellite are in direct line with the sun — causing a “sun outage” and brief interruptions on ESPN: — Front Office Sports (@FOS) previously explained a bit more about sun outages and when they were expected to occur this year: “Sun outages occur every year, in Fall and Spring, and last approximately about a week each time. This Fall, sun outages are expected between October 4th and October 14th, 2023. “The exact time and duration will vary from channel to channel. This is due to channels being received off different satellites in the arc. Each satellite is affected at a different time as the sun moves across the satellite arc. The approximate times for signal loss will be between 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM ET and will last for approximately five to fifteen minutes depending on the size of the dish.” That certainly explains why and Texas had so many technical issues, given the game kicked off at 12 p.m. ET. In the end, Oklahoma after a last-minute touchdown drive led by quarterback Dillon Gabriel. But it was anyone’s game, even with two seconds left. Texas and Oklahoma could meet in Dallas again in December for the Big 12 Championship. That is if both teams win the remainder of their games before they head off for the Southeastern Conference together next year. A potential rematch would bring plenty of big plays, controversial calls and overall drama. But it looks like the signal issues wouldn’t be a problem.

Ο Ουρουγουανός τόνισε πως επικεντρώνεται σε όσους είναι στην ομάδα και όχι σε αυτούς που λείπουν, επισήμανε πως περιμένει από τους παίκτες του να παλέψουν και στα δύο ματς ενώ δεν έκρυψε πως περιμένει κι ένα… δώρο από τη Γαλλία. «Νομίζω πως είναι ξεκάθαρο. Ξέρουμε τι πρέπει να περιμένουμε και θα πρέπει να προετοιμαστούμε από σήμερα σε συγκεκριμένα πράγματα. Είναι ένα πολύ σημαντικό παιχνίδι. Ελπίζω πως θα είμαστε σε μια καλή κατάσταση για να φέρουμε ένα επιθυμητό αποτέλεσμα. Παράλληλα να κοιτάμε και τι γίνεται και στο άλλο παιχνίδι, ώστε να έρθει η Δευτέρα και να μιλάμε για έναν τελικό κόντρα στην Ολλανδία». «Όπως έχει πει από την αρχή είναι αλήθεια. Η πόρτα της Εθνικής είναι ανοικτή για όλους τους ποδοσφαιριστές. Εξαρτάται από το χρόνο, τη στιγμή, τους τραυματισμούς που έχουμε, αλλά και το τι χρειάζεται η Εθνική σε κάποια παιχνίδια. Προσπαθούμε να έχουμε παίκτες που θα μας βοηθήσουν. Είμαι χαρούμενος που επέστρεψε ο Διούδης, αλλά και για τους Σάλιακα και Γαλανόπουλο που έρχονται για πρώτη φορά με εμένα. Δίνουν στην ομάδα διαφορετική ποιότητα και θα προσπαθήσω να τους χρησιμοποιήσω. Ελπίζω ότι τον Μάρτιο όταν θα έχουν ολοκληρωθεί τα προκριματικά και με την ελπίδα ότι η Εθνική μας θα είναι στο Euro, θα είμαστε σε θέση να επιλέξουμε τους 23/25 παίκτες γι’ αυτό το τουρνουά». «Ναι ξέρουμε πως ειδικά τα πρώτα 20 λεπτά θα είναι πάρα πολύ έντονα. Πρέπει να παίξουμε έξυπνα. Εφόσον το παιχνίδι μετά ηρεμήσει, θα πρέπει να κάνουμε το παιχνίδι μας». «Όχι, κανείς δεν ασχολείται με την Ολλανδία, κανείς. Επικεντρωνόμαστε στο παιχνίδι με την Ιρλανδία. Να έχουμε την καλύτερη δυνατή ομάδα που θα παίξει. Θα πρέπει εμείς να πάρουμε τη νίκη και αν η Γαλλία μας δώσει ένα χέρι βοηθείας, τότε είναι ευπρόσδεκτο». «Δεν νομίζω ότι χρειάζεται να πάρουμε μεγαλύτερο ρίσκο. Από τα 16 παιχνίδια με εμένα, επίσημα και φιλικά, έχουμε κερδίσει τα εννιά και από τα 11 επίσημα παιχνίδια έχουμε κερδίσει τα οκτώ. Αυτό θέλω να κρατήσουμε. Πρέπει να είμαστε θετικοί και ρεαλιστές. Τη στιγμή στην οποία είμαστε τώρα σε σχέση με το που ήμασταν πριν. Να κρατήσουμε αυτό στο μυαλό μας και να σκεφτόμαστε θετικά και με το καλό μόλις βρεθούμε στο Euro, να συνεχίσουμε από εκεί για το τι μπορούμε να κάνουμε στο μέλλον. Μπορεί να κερδίσουμε τα τρία επόμενα ματς και να είμαστε με 18 βαθμούς και αντίστοιχα να βρεθούμε εκτός, λόγω της ήττας στον πρώτο αγώνα με την Ολλανδία που επίσης μπορεί να έχει 18 βαθμούς. Αυτό θα ήταν φοβερό. Θέλουμε λίγη βοήθεια αλλά η πρώτη μας δουλειά είναι να πάρουμε τους τρεις βαθμούς με την Ιρλανδία». «Ξέραμε για τον κίνδυνο με τα στημένα. Φάγαμε γκολ στα πρώτα δευτερόλεπτα μετά από κόρνερ. Αυτό είναι ένα καλό μάθημα. Οπότε είναι καλό όταν έχεις ένα παιχνίδι και ξέρεις τι να περιμένεις και τι θα συμβεί, γίνεται αυτό και καταφέρνεις να βγεις νικητής απ’ αυτό». «Προσπαθώ να σκέφτομαι θετικά. Έχουμε πολλά ζητήματα. Να ξεκινήσω με τον Βλαχοδήμο που είναι το «νούμερο ένα» για εμάς και δεν παίζει. Αν ήταν έτοιμος θα έπαιζε ο Μπάλντοκ που δεν είναι εδώ. Ο Μαυροπάνος δεν παίζει σε κάθε ματς. Ο Τσιμίκας δεν παίζει σε κάθε ματς. Είμαστε εμείς, αυτοί είμαστε. Όλα τα παιδιά είναι ικανοποιημένα που βρίσκονται εδώ, χαίρονται που είναι εδώ. Πρέπει να παλέψουμε και να εκπροσωπήσουμε τη χώρα μας. Εξαρτάται από εμάς, δεν τους νοιάζει τι κάνουν στις ομάδες τους εδώ είναι η Εθνική ομάδα». «Πολύ καλή ερώτηση. Έχω απάντηση σε δύο μέρη. Πρώτα απ’ όλα κοιτάμε παντού και τους πάντες. Δεν μπορείτε να φανταστείτε. Ακόμα και έναν παίκτη που είναι 19 ετών, ο οποίος δεν έχει την ελληνική υπηκοότητα και προσπαθούμε να τον πείσουμε να παίξει για την Εθνική. Και δεύτερον χαίρομαι που δεν ρωτήσατε για αυτούς που δεν είναι εδώ. Μπορείτε να ρωτάτε αν θέλετε, αλλά εγώ θα επικεντρώνομαι από εδώ και στο εξής για όσους όσους είναι εδώ. Μπορεί να είναι περίεργο. Να με ρωτάτε και να λέω κανένα σχόλιο. Όταν είμαι σε ένα κλαμπ επικεντρώνομαι στους παίκτες που είναι στην ομάδα και διαθέσιμοι και όχι στους τραυματίες, δεν παραπονιέμαι για αυτούς. Σπαταλώ την ενέργεια μου σε όσους είναι διαθέσιμοι για να παίξουν». «Πρώτα απ’ όλα για όσους ξέρουν το να είμαι προπονητής της Εθνικής Ελλάδας μου δίνει τη δυνατότητα να αναλύσω πολλά. Εκτός από την προετοιμασία που έκανα τους δύο τελευταίους μήνες για τα ματς με Ιρλανδία και Ολλανδία. Είδα αρκετά πως παίζουν και οι τρεις και ειδικότερα πως παίζουν οι ομάδες τους. Και να δω αν μπορούν να βοηθήσουν με συγκεκριμένο τρόπο. Οπότε το σκεφτόμαστε. Δεν είναι εύκολη απόφαση για μένα αλλά το έχουμε στο μυαλό μας». «Θα το απολαύσω. Γνωρίζω αυτές τις χώρες. Που έχουμε ξαναπάει και έχω ζήσει σαν ποδοσφαιριστής. Έχω μια ιδιαίτερη σχέση, αρκετούς πρώην παίκτες εκεί, και θα το απολαύσω ιδιαίτερα αν κερδίσουμε».

It would be a bizarre rabbit hole to burrow at the best of times but all makes sense given Rooney is primed to take charge at the Championship club, succeeding John Eustace, who was sacked with the team nestled in the playoff spots. A fine reward for a promising start to the season? Birmingham, a club that had until recently lurched from one crisis to another, have not finished above 17th in the division for seven years. At this point, and in an ideal world it would not need saying, it is important to decry abusive messages reportedly sent towards Rooney’s eldest as a result of his social-media spree for what they are: deplorable behaviour. Let’s face it, it did not take Poirot – or Wagatha Christie, if you prefer – to uncover Birmingham’s desire to bring in Rooney. Wayne Rooney set to take charge at Birmingham after Eustace is sacked Read more There has been a clamour at board level to make a big-name appointment since the US-based Shelby Companies Limited (SCL), fronted by the hedge fund manager Tom Wagner, completed the welcome purchase of the long-distressed club in July. Garry Cook, the Birmingham chief executive who was connected to Chris Kirchner’s failed takeover at Derby, Rooney’s last club on these shores, is driving the appointment process. Cook has close ties with Rooney’s longtime agent, Paul Stretford, and both were involved with Kirchner’s attempt to buy Derby. Birmingham made headlines in August when Tom Brady, the seven‑time Super Bowl champion, was announced as a minority owner and chairman of a new advisory board. At the time Birmingham trumpeted how the NFL superstar planned to make the club “a respected leader in nutrition, health, wellness and recovery” in world football and, before long, Brady was mingling with supporters at the Roost, a pub round the corner from the stadium. Investor Tom Brady watched Birmingham play Leeds at St Andrew’s in August. Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock Behind the scenes it has long felt a matter of when and not if Birmingham would make another high-profile addition, though Eustace taking 10 points from a possible 12 and going the first six weeks of the season unbeaten must have given the club hierarchy a headache. Nor was a 3-1 comeback home win against their city rivals West Brom last Friday the ideal platform for them to then pull the rug from Eustace. Birmingham, of course, have been here before. Midway through the 2016‑17 season they sacked Gary Rowett, with the club on the edge of the Championship playoffs, in favour of appointing Gianfranco Zola. It proved a disastrous call by then owners Trillion Trophy Asia, the former Chelsea striker lasting barely five months and plunging the club into relegation trouble. Zola, who has not managed since, was replaced by Harry Redknapp and Birmingham finished 19th, avoiding the drop on the final day. What is the old saying? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it? It is a turn of phrase Birmingham supporters will doubtless utter over the course of the coming days, the timeframe in which the club hierarchy say they will appoint a manager “responsible for creating an identity and clear ‘no fear’ playing style”, whatever that means. Birmingham certainly did not seem to be holding back as they scored seven goals across their past two games. Since Rowett’s sacking the club has had eight permanent managers in seven years. Eustace helped to provide Birmingham with an overdue sense of stability and unity, which, to the credit of Birmingham’s owners, was enhanced by SCL’s takeover. But Eustace should take most credit for overachieving on modest resources and simultaneously developing youngsters, evolving the team and restoring supporters’ faith in the club. It is not so long ago that protests by disillusioned fans dominated the discourse. Eustace, who spent time in Birmingham’s academy before leaving for Coventry at 16, helped to ensure they were being taken seriously again. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock At Birmingham’s St Andrew’s stadium, where a US flag now flies on top of the main stand, there have been plenty of false dawns, with Garry Monk, Pep Clotet and Aitor Karanka among those who tried and failed to restore the club to the top flight. It ended in tears for Lee Bowyer, another former player, too. Perhaps it is a good thing, then, that Rooney is familiar with choppy waters. He initially took interim charge at Derby as a player-manager in November 2020, then led the club admirably amid administration and the threat of liquidation, though his former assistant Liam Rosenior, now in charge of Championship rivals Hull City, took the majority of training sessions. If Rooney takes charge as expected, his first game will be at Middlesbrough, setting up a touchline duel with Michael Carrick, a former Manchester United and England teammate. All of this guarantees Rooney, universally recognised as one of the game’s greatest, will walk into a strange atmosphere. Rooney undoubtedly galvanised Derby throughout one of the most turbulent periods in their history but, to many, he will pitch up at Birmingham as something of an unwanted VIP guest.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:00:18","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71be60ed64888299a8879d0347de83e8610d5070/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ec1b30bda69da131ee0fcff7ddcbf0f","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d3891a206d4efe896b6145da9479e061","title":"Jude Bellingham’s artistry can take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/09/jude-bellingham-england-gareth-southgate-real-madrid","keywords":["England","Jude Bellingham","Gareth Southgate","Real Madrid","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Real Madrid midfielder is lighting up La Liga but must be given the freedom to inject some life into the national teamFirst you need the vision. “Around the pitch I want to be an artist,” Jude Bellingham says, which is the sort of quote that makes you double-take, because what footballer even talks about making art these days?

Well Geoff, at the end of the day it’s all about engaging in a search for deeper meaning, washing away from the soul the dust of everyday life, creating a new kind of sense where none previously existed. Fortunately, on this occasion, the big man’s got his head on it. And perhaps the most thrilling thing about watching Bellingham at the moment is not the goals (11 in all competitions) or the assists (four) or the celebrations (broad, open-armed, inviting us to embrace him), but that little gap between the moment of creation and the moment of realisation. When he’s trapped by the touchline and plotting his escape route. Or the shuffle that shifts the ball out of his feet and opens up whole new dimensions of possibility. You don’t know how this ends, because nor does he. Last week, the Spanish newspaper Marca published an entire article about Bellingham’s tongue. The gist was this: Bellingham’s tongue hangs out when he runs. Michael Jordan also stuck his tongue out. So did Einstein. So did the Rolling Stones logo. Conclusion: Bellingham = genius. And perhaps this is the sort of thing that happens when an athlete begins to inhabit a plane where people simply want to consume them, absorb them, plug them into their day like a glow lamp. Pastor Postecoglou shows importance of journey even if you never reach heaven | Jonathan Liew Read more Certainly there is a strange and devotional purity to the way Real Madrid fans have taken to Bellingham since his move this summer. It can’t just be the goals, because scoring goals isn’t really his job, and it can’t simply be the talent, because never in nine years at Madrid was Gareth Bale as adored. Perhaps it chimes with this idea of football as expression, football as a vehicle of joy, football as a journey without maps or endings. I don’t know if Bellingham is the best player in the world right now. But he’s undeniably the most evocative and joyful. At which point, with sighs, Bellingham must now peel off his superhero suit, slip on a blue training top and start playing sideways passes to Harry Maguire. And if Bellingham at Madrid is a love story in its first bloom, then Bellingham with England is a slightly more complex and awkward prospect. Here the window of possibility feels narrower, the demands sharper and more urgent. Inspire us. Transform us. Win us something. Take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better. Partly this is simply the nature of international football, a world defined by its abrupt endings and screeching climaxes, where absolutely nobody is trying to create art. But partly, too, it is the natural dissonance between a man so clearly at the start of his England journey and a man so clearly near the end of his. A man trying to create art, and a man trying to squeeze the last drops out of a job from which he already seems to be plotting his exit. In short: what happens when the most exuberant and exciting force in English football collides head-on with its least? ‘I want to be an artist on the pitch’: Jude Bellingham has already made a big impact at Real Madrid. Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images We caught a glimpse of this at Southgate’s squad announcement last week, when the England manager was asked about Bellingham’s recent displays for Madrid. “He’s been defending on the left wing in a couple of games,” Southgate said. “I can just imagine the reaction from all and sundry if I asked him to do that.” A joke, but a bitter joke, a telling and weirdly uncharitable joke, borne largely of ennui and resentment. And this appears to be the default Southgate tune these days, whether complaining about VAR or wincing in the face of questions about Saudi Arabia and LGBT rights: less the figurehead of a national team in the national sport, more a middle-ranking bank employee carefully explaining the pros and cons of an offset mortgage. And really this is not so much an issue of strategy as tone. Declan Rice will never be Luka Modric and Kalvin Phillips will never be Eduardo Camavinga, but the win over Scotland – albeit against weaker opposition in a friendly – was a good example of how to set Bellingham’s attacking threat loose without sacrificing cover. The wider problem here is the sense of sourness and indifference that began to set into Southgate’s England around the second half of 2021: a narrowing of horizons, a retreat from the expression and purpose that briefly made them one of the most thrilling England teams of my lifetime. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not really qualified to tell Southgate what formation to use or who he should deploy at midfield pivot. Handbrake on, handbrake off; whatever. But I do know that not long ago this was an England team that used to make you feel things, led by a man who seemed to embody the best of us. Somewhere along the line, ridiculously, a team containing Bellingham and Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish lost its ability to convey joy. And it probably happened when its coach, burned by one too many stinging criticisms, started fixating on endings. Fortunately, Southgate has a guy who gets it. Who wants to win as much as everyone, but wants to sweep people off their feet as he does it. Who understands how to connect with people, who wants to inspire and create. And perhaps ultimately Southgate’s legacy will be defined by the extent to which he can lean into the joy of Jude, to channel this generational talent and its world without limits. Because if Bellingham teaches us anything, it is that the best way of scripting the perfect ending is to play like there are no endings at all.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:00:18","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c30d0ce5a6b0000bf4c5837546f27172402b96/0_339_6079_3649/master/6079.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40c5614e9dbc85aec993078638a37b5c","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b509b9c6d691eea6538b5144ca37a10a","title":"Ben White centre of frosty incident moments before Haaland bust-up at Arsenal vs City","link":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/ben-white-arsenal-phil-foden-31147496","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Arsenal and Manchester City's late bust-up was preceded by an awkward moment between Ben White and Phil Foden with a less than friendly greeting","content":"Ben White shared an awkward moment with Phil Foden before and stars clashed at full-time.

The disagreement reportedly began when Arsenal set-piece coach Nicolas Jover tried to shake the hand of City skipper Walker. Jover, who used to work at City, was reportedly not keen to do the same after Arsenal lost the crunch fixture towards the end of last season.

A few months back Beckham addressed a rapt audience at a St John’s Wood synagogue about the foundational importance of Judaism in his life. “I am part of the Jewish community,” Beckham announced, going on to talk about eating chicken soup and wearing a kippah at family functions. Every aspect of Beckham’s public image is minutely managed. Identity is very important to public figures. This part of him seems to be something he wants to project to the world. With this in mind, and in view of the horrendous events of the past week , Beckham will perhaps feel some kind of logical contradiction in the fact he, like Hamas, is the beneficiary of Qatari money. No need for conspiracies, World Cup 2030 and 2034 are a plot in plain sight | Barney Ronay Read more Beckham was paid a reported £125m by the state of Qatar to act as a PR agent for its operations in the foreign policy area of football . Hamas is, according to some detailed reporting, in receipt of hundreds of millions of pounds of Qatari money that is, it is said, directed to administrative support, aid and resources for impoverished families. Safe to say, concern for the Jewish community is not a key part of the Hamas operation. No doubt some will see a contradiction in this. Here we have a serial borrower of other people’s causes. See for example Beckham’s disposable allyship with LGBTQ+ people, another deep personal conviction discarded like an oversized 1990s leather jacket in the face of cold hard cash from a state where homosexuality is criminalised. The more sympathetic view is that this is a deeply compromised area for all sport, and for football in particular. Certainly the Premier League faces a high-jeopardy straddling of the political and cultural divide it has opened up in pursuit of its rapacious commercial aims. There was no moment of solidarity before Premier League matches at the weekend towards the victims of the sudden escalation of violence in Gaza and Israel . Five Sunday fixtures were played out a day after the first rocket barrage, without a moment of silence or a message on a placard. Understandably so, in practical terms. It takes time to agree such things. Premier League owners are not, in fact, engaged in a constant speed-dial Zoom call to debate issues of political messaging. As things stand, the Premier League has no plans to make any statement of support or to offer any visible sign of sympathy. Some would suggest there is very little actual substance to such messaging in any case. Recent times have brought matchday recognition of events as diverse as the tragic earthquakes in Morocco, the floods in Libya, the war in Ukraine, a train crash in Greece and the death of John Motson. There is a danger of entering a multi-event grief Olympics here, with ever decreasing effects each time. But the thing is, once you start doing this, or indeed refrain from doing it, that choice becomes significant too. A flag expressing support for Ukraine displayed at the Emirates Stadium in August. Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty Images This is not the place to even begin trying to resolve the cause and effect of historical blame. Safe to say events this weekend are the latest chapter in a horror story, with an entire history of Palestinian blood being shed. But the current escalation has killed more than a thousand civilians in three days, with talk of kidnap, babies taken from their mothers, of more than 200 slaughtered while attending a music festival. Many British citizens are directly affected. This is not the death of a football commentator. Football, meanwhile, is the world’s messaging system. It does take sides and offer solace. The Premier League had a view straight away on Ukraine and Russia, under instruction from the British government. The response here will be silence. At which point devastatingly complex tides of ownership and influence begin to crowd in at the edge of the picture. In recent years football has simply rolled over and invited ambitious state-backed actors to divvy up its internal organs in return for yet another revenue stream. So we end up with the current situation. A day after the surge in violence began the biggest game in the world that weekend was played out at the Emirates Stadium without mention or sympathy, at a time when mention and sympathy are undeniably the fashion. As for the optics, well, the optics are frankly bizarre. Arsenal’s home stadium is literally called the Emirates, which has its own neighbourly connection to the regional strife involving Israel and Palestine. The game was broadcast on the Qatari state TV channel BeIN Sports, a key Premier League rights holder. Manchester City are owned by Abu Dhabi, an emirate with its own complex relationship with Israel, most recently the thawing relations that have drawn a separate hostility from Iran. Any discussion of how to mark the outbreak of a new and brutal war will also involve input from the sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia – one of 20 board members in the English top tier as owners of Newcastle United – which has its own complex intersection with all parties. Premier League clubs ask government to block nation-state ownership Read more Saudi has been trying to normalise its relations with Israel, which is seen as a potential background element in the sudden escalation. Saudi is also one of three regional powers, along with Qatar and Iran, to publicly lay the blame for the violence at Israel’s door. Is a statement of support for murdered civilians ever going to be possible in this scenario given the political pressures, given the fact Saudi will in effect be putting its name to such a message? There are endlessly tangled tides of enmity and alliance here. Manchester United are in negotiations to be bought outright by a Qatari. Saudi’s fund also has a hand in the consortium that owns Chelsea (although, we are assured, with zero overlap). The Premier League has willingly thrown its doors open to this tornado of political influence, where such interests are now not just inside the building but sitting at the top table. This is what sportswashing looks like, it turns out. Not just influence and visibility, but an arm of bloody international relations right on your doorstep, dressed in your colours, still couched, dimly, behind the idea – laughter in the dark here – of sport as a force for good.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 20:00:19","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6ee1b3df0fbc66fe346014a9384a5acb6afee9/0_408_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b10a30ee893403dddc7f1620c7fa3ad7","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c5a5ee214fa0ec45806119080174056f","title":"Football Fans Suffer from Annoying 'Sun Outages' During Weekend Games","link":"https://www.westernjournal.com/football-fans-suffer-annoying-sun-outages-weekend-games/","keywords":["Commentary","Sports","Colleges and universities","ESPN","Oklahoma Sooners","sports","Texas Longhorns","U.S. News"],"creator":["Johnathan Jones"],"video_url":null,"description":"College football fans who experienced signal disruptions during ABC’s coverage of the annual Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas — and other events — now have an explanation for […] The post Football Fans Suffer from Annoying 'Sun Outages' During Weekend Games appeared first on The Western Journal.","content":"College football fans who experienced signal disruptions during ABC’s coverage of the annual Red River Shootout between Oklahoma and Texas — and other events — now have an explanation for the network’s technical issues. The problem is due to the time of year and the placement of relative to their location to the sun. The phenomenon is blamed on something called a “sun outage.” I experienced the issue firsthand during the first and second quarters of the annual rivalry game, which was broadcast from the Cotton Bowl in from the Texas State Fair. My Oklahoma Sooners were up 7-0 with 11:58 on the game clock in the opening quarter when Texas lined up to punt deep in its own territory. There was one issue for fans of both teams, as well as casual viewers: The Longhorns faked the punt and converted it for a huge gain as the signal cut out. The Oklahoma-Texas ESPN on ABC broadcast has been full of technical difficulties, including right in the middle of this fake punt from the Longhorns. 🏈📺😵‍💫 — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) Moments later, another signal disruption had me screaming, “SOMEONE KEEPS UNPLUGGING SOMETHING!” At the time, officials were trying to determine if tight end Gunnar Helm had fumbled following a dime of a pass from quarterback Quinn Ewers. Texas kept the ball but Ewers quickly threw his second interception of the first quarter a few plays later. I would be committing the crime of omission if I didn’t mention the fact that Texas blocked an OU punt in the end zone for an easy special teams touchdown moments later. But what about those annoying signal issues? Chris Fowler finally explained to viewers that no rogue employee was behind the issue, nor was anyone in the broadcast booth playing with any equipment. “We apologize. We’re dealing with some serious technical issues,” the ESPN commentator said. Fowler added, “It’s a power issue. Our crew is as good as any trying to get things in terms of the cameras and microphones back up and running.” “We apologize; we’re dealing with some serious technical issues (on this Oklahoma-Texas ESPN on ABC broadcast)… It’s a power issue. Our crew is as good as any trying to get things in terms of the cameras and microphones back up and running.”- Chris Fowler — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) The problems for didn’t end there. At one point later in the game, the signal was so porous that my TV was showing the game cut in half with what was supposed to be the bottom of the feed at the top and vice versa. It really added an unnecessary layer to the drama of the game — which is one of the best rivalries in that this year happened to match up two of the best teams in the country. Front Office Sports explained the reason for the broadcast problems. “Your TV isn’t broken,” the account posted. “For the next few days, the Earth and Disney satellite are in direct line with the sun — causing a ‘sun outage’ and brief interruptions on ESPN.” Your TV isn’t broken. For the next few days, the Earth and Disney satellite are in direct line with the sun — causing a “sun outage” and brief interruptions on ESPN: — Front Office Sports (@FOS) previously explained a bit more about sun outages and when they were expected to occur this year: “Sun outages occur every year, in Fall and Spring, and last approximately about a week each time. This Fall, sun outages are expected between October 4th and October 14th, 2023. “The exact time and duration will vary from channel to channel. This is due to channels being received off different satellites in the arc. Each satellite is affected at a different time as the sun moves across the satellite arc. The approximate times for signal loss will be between 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM ET and will last for approximately five to fifteen minutes depending on the size of the dish.” That certainly explains why and Texas had so many technical issues, given the game kicked off at 12 p.m. ET. In the end, Oklahoma after a last-minute touchdown drive led by quarterback Dillon Gabriel. But it was anyone’s game, even with two seconds left. Texas and Oklahoma could meet in Dallas again in December for the Big 12 Championship. That is if both teams win the remainder of their games before they head off for the Southeastern Conference together next year. A potential rematch would bring plenty of big plays, controversial calls and overall drama. But it looks like the signal issues wouldn’t be a problem.

Ο Ουρουγουανός τόνισε πως επικεντρώνεται σε όσους είναι στην ομάδα και όχι σε αυτούς που λείπουν, επισήμανε πως περιμένει από τους παίκτες του να παλέψουν και στα δύο ματς ενώ δεν έκρυψε πως περιμένει κι ένα… δώρο από τη Γαλλία. «Νομίζω πως είναι ξεκάθαρο. Ξέρουμε τι πρέπει να περιμένουμε και θα πρέπει να προετοιμαστούμε από σήμερα σε συγκεκριμένα πράγματα. Είναι ένα πολύ σημαντικό παιχνίδι. Ελπίζω πως θα είμαστε σε μια καλή κατάσταση για να φέρουμε ένα επιθυμητό αποτέλεσμα. Παράλληλα να κοιτάμε και τι γίνεται και στο άλλο παιχνίδι, ώστε να έρθει η Δευτέρα και να μιλάμε για έναν τελικό κόντρα στην Ολλανδία». «Όπως έχει πει από την αρχή είναι αλήθεια. Η πόρτα της Εθνικής είναι ανοικτή για όλους τους ποδοσφαιριστές. Εξαρτάται από το χρόνο, τη στιγμή, τους τραυματισμούς που έχουμε, αλλά και το τι χρειάζεται η Εθνική σε κάποια παιχνίδια. Προσπαθούμε να έχουμε παίκτες που θα μας βοηθήσουν. Είμαι χαρούμενος που επέστρεψε ο Διούδης, αλλά και για τους Σάλιακα και Γαλανόπουλο που έρχονται για πρώτη φορά με εμένα. Δίνουν στην ομάδα διαφορετική ποιότητα και θα προσπαθήσω να τους χρησιμοποιήσω. Ελπίζω ότι τον Μάρτιο όταν θα έχουν ολοκληρωθεί τα προκριματικά και με την ελπίδα ότι η Εθνική μας θα είναι στο Euro, θα είμαστε σε θέση να επιλέξουμε τους 23/25 παίκτες γι’ αυτό το τουρνουά». «Ναι ξέρουμε πως ειδικά τα πρώτα 20 λεπτά θα είναι πάρα πολύ έντονα. Πρέπει να παίξουμε έξυπνα. Εφόσον το παιχνίδι μετά ηρεμήσει, θα πρέπει να κάνουμε το παιχνίδι μας». «Όχι, κανείς δεν ασχολείται με την Ολλανδία, κανείς. Επικεντρωνόμαστε στο παιχνίδι με την Ιρλανδία. Να έχουμε την καλύτερη δυνατή ομάδα που θα παίξει. Θα πρέπει εμείς να πάρουμε τη νίκη και αν η Γαλλία μας δώσει ένα χέρι βοηθείας, τότε είναι ευπρόσδεκτο». «Δεν νομίζω ότι χρειάζεται να πάρουμε μεγαλύτερο ρίσκο. Από τα 16 παιχνίδια με εμένα, επίσημα και φιλικά, έχουμε κερδίσει τα εννιά και από τα 11 επίσημα παιχνίδια έχουμε κερδίσει τα οκτώ. Αυτό θέλω να κρατήσουμε. Πρέπει να είμαστε θετικοί και ρεαλιστές. Τη στιγμή στην οποία είμαστε τώρα σε σχέση με το που ήμασταν πριν. Να κρατήσουμε αυτό στο μυαλό μας και να σκεφτόμαστε θετικά και με το καλό μόλις βρεθούμε στο Euro, να συνεχίσουμε από εκεί για το τι μπορούμε να κάνουμε στο μέλλον. Μπορεί να κερδίσουμε τα τρία επόμενα ματς και να είμαστε με 18 βαθμούς και αντίστοιχα να βρεθούμε εκτός, λόγω της ήττας στον πρώτο αγώνα με την Ολλανδία που επίσης μπορεί να έχει 18 βαθμούς. Αυτό θα ήταν φοβερό. Θέλουμε λίγη βοήθεια αλλά η πρώτη μας δουλειά είναι να πάρουμε τους τρεις βαθμούς με την Ιρλανδία». «Ξέραμε για τον κίνδυνο με τα στημένα. Φάγαμε γκολ στα πρώτα δευτερόλεπτα μετά από κόρνερ. Αυτό είναι ένα καλό μάθημα. Οπότε είναι καλό όταν έχεις ένα παιχνίδι και ξέρεις τι να περιμένεις και τι θα συμβεί, γίνεται αυτό και καταφέρνεις να βγεις νικητής απ’ αυτό». «Προσπαθώ να σκέφτομαι θετικά. Έχουμε πολλά ζητήματα. Να ξεκινήσω με τον Βλαχοδήμο που είναι το «νούμερο ένα» για εμάς και δεν παίζει. Αν ήταν έτοιμος θα έπαιζε ο Μπάλντοκ που δεν είναι εδώ. Ο Μαυροπάνος δεν παίζει σε κάθε ματς. Ο Τσιμίκας δεν παίζει σε κάθε ματς. Είμαστε εμείς, αυτοί είμαστε. Όλα τα παιδιά είναι ικανοποιημένα που βρίσκονται εδώ, χαίρονται που είναι εδώ. Πρέπει να παλέψουμε και να εκπροσωπήσουμε τη χώρα μας. Εξαρτάται από εμάς, δεν τους νοιάζει τι κάνουν στις ομάδες τους εδώ είναι η Εθνική ομάδα». «Πολύ καλή ερώτηση. Έχω απάντηση σε δύο μέρη. Πρώτα απ’ όλα κοιτάμε παντού και τους πάντες. Δεν μπορείτε να φανταστείτε. Ακόμα και έναν παίκτη που είναι 19 ετών, ο οποίος δεν έχει την ελληνική υπηκοότητα και προσπαθούμε να τον πείσουμε να παίξει για την Εθνική. Και δεύτερον χαίρομαι που δεν ρωτήσατε για αυτούς που δεν είναι εδώ. Μπορείτε να ρωτάτε αν θέλετε, αλλά εγώ θα επικεντρώνομαι από εδώ και στο εξής για όσους όσους είναι εδώ. Μπορεί να είναι περίεργο. Να με ρωτάτε και να λέω κανένα σχόλιο. Όταν είμαι σε ένα κλαμπ επικεντρώνομαι στους παίκτες που είναι στην ομάδα και διαθέσιμοι και όχι στους τραυματίες, δεν παραπονιέμαι για αυτούς.

Let’s face it, it did not take Poirot – or Wagatha Christie, if you prefer – to uncover Birmingham’s desire to bring in Rooney. Wayne Rooney set to take charge at Birmingham after Eustace is sacked Read more There has been a clamour at board level to make a big-name appointment since the US-based Shelby Companies Limited (SCL), fronted by the hedge fund manager Tom Wagner, completed the welcome purchase of the long-distressed club in July. Garry Cook, the Birmingham chief executive who was connected to Chris Kirchner’s failed takeover at Derby, Rooney’s last club on these shores, is driving the appointment process. Cook has close ties with Rooney’s longtime agent, Paul Stretford, and both were involved with Kirchner’s attempt to buy Derby. Birmingham made headlines in August when Tom Brady, the seven‑time Super Bowl champion, was announced as a minority owner and chairman of a new advisory board. At the time Birmingham trumpeted how the NFL superstar planned to make the club “a respected leader in nutrition, health, wellness and recovery” in world football and, before long, Brady was mingling with supporters at the Roost, a pub round the corner from the stadium. Investor Tom Brady watched Birmingham play Leeds at St Andrew’s in August. Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock Behind the scenes it has long felt a matter of when and not if Birmingham would make another high-profile addition, though Eustace taking 10 points from a possible 12 and going the first six weeks of the season unbeaten must have given the club hierarchy a headache. Nor was a 3-1 comeback home win against their city rivals West Brom last Friday the ideal platform for them to then pull the rug from Eustace. Birmingham, of course, have been here before. Midway through the 2016‑17 season they sacked Gary Rowett, with the club on the edge of the Championship playoffs, in favour of appointing Gianfranco Zola. It proved a disastrous call by then owners Trillion Trophy Asia, the former Chelsea striker lasting barely five months and plunging the club into relegation trouble. Zola, who has not managed since, was replaced by Harry Redknapp and Birmingham finished 19th, avoiding the drop on the final day. What is the old saying? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it? It is a turn of phrase Birmingham supporters will doubtless utter over the course of the coming days, the timeframe in which the club hierarchy say they will appoint a manager “responsible for creating an identity and clear ‘no fear’ playing style”, whatever that means. Birmingham certainly did not seem to be holding back as they scored seven goals across their past two games. Since Rowett’s sacking the club has had eight permanent managers in seven years. Eustace helped to provide Birmingham with an overdue sense of stability and unity, which, to the credit of Birmingham’s owners, was enhanced by SCL’s takeover. But Eustace should take most credit for overachieving on modest resources and simultaneously developing youngsters, evolving the team and restoring supporters’ faith in the club. It is not so long ago that protests by disillusioned fans dominated the discourse. Eustace, who spent time in Birmingham’s academy before leaving for Coventry at 16, helped to ensure they were being taken seriously again. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock At Birmingham’s St Andrew’s stadium, where a US flag now flies on top of the main stand, there have been plenty of false dawns, with Garry Monk, Pep Clotet and Aitor Karanka among those who tried and failed to restore the club to the top flight. It ended in tears for Lee Bowyer, another former player, too. Perhaps it is a good thing, then, that Rooney is familiar with choppy waters. He initially took interim charge at Derby as a player-manager in November 2020, then led the club admirably amid administration and the threat of liquidation, though his former assistant Liam Rosenior, now in charge of Championship rivals Hull City, took the majority of training sessions. If Rooney takes charge as expected, his first game will be at Middlesbrough, setting up a touchline duel with Michael Carrick, a former Manchester United and England teammate. All of this guarantees Rooney, universally recognised as one of the game’s greatest, will walk into a strange atmosphere. Rooney undoubtedly galvanised Derby throughout one of the most turbulent periods in their history but, to many, he will pitch up at Birmingham as something of an unwanted VIP guest.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:00:18","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71be60ed64888299a8879d0347de83e8610d5070/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ec1b30bda69da131ee0fcff7ddcbf0f","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"d3891a206d4efe896b6145da9479e061","title":"Jude Bellingham’s artistry can take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/09/jude-bellingham-england-gareth-southgate-real-madrid","keywords":["England","Jude Bellingham","Gareth Southgate","Real Madrid","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Real Madrid midfielder is lighting up La Liga but must be given the freedom to inject some life into the national teamFirst you need the vision. “Around the pitch I want to be an artist,” Jude Bellingham says, which is the sort of quote that makes you double-take, because what footballer even talks about making art these days?

When he’s trapped by the touchline and plotting his escape route. Or the shuffle that shifts the ball out of his feet and opens up whole new dimensions of possibility. You don’t know how this ends, because nor does he. Last week, the Spanish newspaper Marca published an entire article about Bellingham’s tongue. The gist was this: Bellingham’s tongue hangs out when he runs. Michael Jordan also stuck his tongue out. So did Einstein. So did the Rolling Stones logo. Conclusion: Bellingham = genius. And perhaps this is the sort of thing that happens when an athlete begins to inhabit a plane where people simply want to consume them, absorb them, plug them into their day like a glow lamp. Pastor Postecoglou shows importance of journey even if you never reach heaven | Jonathan Liew Read more Certainly there is a strange and devotional purity to the way Real Madrid fans have taken to Bellingham since his move this summer. It can’t just be the goals, because scoring goals isn’t really his job, and it can’t simply be the talent, because never in nine years at Madrid was Gareth Bale as adored. Perhaps it chimes with this idea of football as expression, football as a vehicle of joy, football as a journey without maps or endings. I don’t know if Bellingham is the best player in the world right now. But he’s undeniably the most evocative and joyful. At which point, with sighs, Bellingham must now peel off his superhero suit, slip on a blue training top and start playing sideways passes to Harry Maguire. And if Bellingham at Madrid is a love story in its first bloom, then Bellingham with England is a slightly more complex and awkward prospect. Here the window of possibility feels narrower, the demands sharper and more urgent. Inspire us. Transform us. Win us something. Take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better. Partly this is simply the nature of international football, a world defined by its abrupt endings and screeching climaxes, where absolutely nobody is trying to create art. But partly, too, it is the natural dissonance between a man so clearly at the start of his England journey and a man so clearly near the end of his. A man trying to create art, and a man trying to squeeze the last drops out of a job from which he already seems to be plotting his exit. In short: what happens when the most exuberant and exciting force in English football collides head-on with its least? ‘I want to be an artist on the pitch’: Jude Bellingham has already made a big impact at Real Madrid. Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images We caught a glimpse of this at Southgate’s squad announcement last week, when the England manager was asked about Bellingham’s recent displays for Madrid. “He’s been defending on the left wing in a couple of games,” Southgate said. “I can just imagine the reaction from all and sundry if I asked him to do that.” A joke, but a bitter joke, a telling and weirdly uncharitable joke, borne largely of ennui and resentment. And this appears to be the default Southgate tune these days, whether complaining about VAR or wincing in the face of questions about Saudi Arabia and LGBT rights: less the figurehead of a national team in the national sport, more a middle-ranking bank employee carefully explaining the pros and cons of an offset mortgage. And really this is not so much an issue of strategy as tone. Declan Rice will never be Luka Modric and Kalvin Phillips will never be Eduardo Camavinga, but the win over Scotland – albeit against weaker opposition in a friendly – was a good example of how to set Bellingham’s attacking threat loose without sacrificing cover. The wider problem here is the sense of sourness and indifference that began to set into Southgate’s England around the second half of 2021: a narrowing of horizons, a retreat from the expression and purpose that briefly made them one of the most thrilling England teams of my lifetime. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not really qualified to tell Southgate what formation to use or who he should deploy at midfield pivot. Handbrake on, handbrake off; whatever. But I do know that not long ago this was an England team that used to make you feel things, led by a man who seemed to embody the best of us. Somewhere along the line, ridiculously, a team containing Bellingham and Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish lost its ability to convey joy. And it probably happened when its coach, burned by one too many stinging criticisms, started fixating on endings. Fortunately, Southgate has a guy who gets it. Who wants to win as much as everyone, but wants to sweep people off their feet as he does it. Who understands how to connect with people, who wants to inspire and create. And perhaps ultimately Southgate’s legacy will be defined by the extent to which he can lean into the joy of Jude, to channel this generational talent and its world without limits. Because if Bellingham teaches us anything, it is that the best way of scripting the perfect ending is to play like there are no endings at all.","pubDate":"2023-10-09 19:00:18","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c30d0ce5a6b0000bf4c5837546f27172402b96/0_339_6079_3649/master/6079.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40c5614e9dbc85aec993078638a37b5c","source_id":"theguardian","source_priority":106,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
