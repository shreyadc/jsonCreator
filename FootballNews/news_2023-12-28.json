The World Cup winner has enjoyed a sensational start to life at his new club after leaving Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. Messi has scored 11 goals in 14 appearances and inspired their Leagues Cup triumph, the club's first ever trophy win. Results in the MLS weren't as positive though as they finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, as their season finished in October. Speculation over a potential loan for Messi to maintain his fitness arose at the end of the campaign, although this was played down . The 36-year-old has remained at the club ahead of the new campaign and has clearly been putting in the work whilst away from the pitch. Taking to Instagram, he posted what appeared to be a post-workout gym picture on his story. Standing alongside his wife Antonela, Messi looked ripped and in great condition as he approaches a return to action. Inter Miami have a series of friendly matches scheduled ahead of the 2024 MLS season, with the squad first travelling to Saudi Arabia. They will face Al Hilal at the end of February before playing Al Nassr, with Messi set to play against fellow legend Cristiano Ronaldo again. A match away at Japanese side Vissel Kobe is then followed by a home fixture versus Newell’s Old Boys, Messi's childhood club . Inter Miami's first match back in the MLS sees them host Western Conference side Real Salt Lake on February 21. Messi will be hoping he can replicate this year's efforts in the new season as the Floridian side eye a better campaign than the last. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner still possesses an abundance of quality as the legend plays in the twilight years of his amazing career.","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:31:03","image_url":"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/10/lionel-messi-10-inter-miami-833425147.jpg?strip=all&w=960","source_id":"talksport","source_priority":4624,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"c37d2a75c0d8a22db5d4bc7ed81e07e1","title":"Who is TV presenter James Richardson?","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/11714689/james-richardson-who-net-worth/","keywords":["sport","celebrity relationships and break ups","channel 5","evg","explainers","net worths"],"creator":["Laura Stewart-Liberty"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"JAMES RICHARDSON is a familiar face on our screens, best known for presenting shows on everything from Football to strongmen. But who is he? Here’s all you need to know about the legendary sports commentator. 1 James Richardson presents the World's Strongest Man competition on Channel 5. Who is James Richardson? James Richardson is a sports television presenter and journalist born in Bristol on May 29, 1966. Richardson has been on our screens since 1992, starting with a ten-year run as the presenter of Channel 4’s Football Italia programme , which was cult viewing for football fans until 2002. Football Italia centred on live coverage of Serie A, Italy’s top football division. Richardson won fans and supporters thanks to his original reporting style, and sense of humour. A multilinguist — Richardson speaks Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese — Richardson was well positioned for the presenting role. The show was filmed in Italy and often featured Richardson simply sitting in a cafe with a coffee and a brioche, taking viewers through the Italian newspaper sports pages. Richardson is also known to be a fan of the Italian team A.S. Roma . In 2002, Football Italia’s viewing figures dropped, and it moved from Channel 4 to other channels — Richardson went with it, but ultimately left the show altogether in 2006.

After leaving Football Italia, Richardson soon moved to The Guardian Football Weekly podcast, where he stayed until 2017. Leaving The Guardian, Richardson set up podcasts from The Athletic, The Totally Football Show, and Golazzo: The Totally Italian Football Show. Richardson also hosts TNT Sport’s The UEFA Champions League Goals Show, alongside James Horncastle, Raphael Honigstein, and Julien Laurens. He presents Channel 5’s World Strongest Man programme and has worked with the Premier League presenting their Fantasy Premier League content. Does James Richardson present World's Strongest Man? Richardson has presented the World’s Strongest Man competition, broadcast on Channel Five, since 2011. He presents the show, alongside Michelle Ackerley , and 2017 winner Eddie Hall . The World’s Strongest Man has been a festive television fixture since 1977. The World’s Strongest Man competition is broadcast throughout December, and the final is on January 1, 2024 at 7 pm. In 2021, Tom Stoltman became the first Scot to win the competition, before winning again in 2022. What is James Richardson's net worth? Richardson’s net worth is estimated to be between £100,000 and £1 million. But details on his sports presenting salary and official net worth have yet to be confirmed. Thanks to his successful presenting career, Richardson has had the opportunity to travel widely — but details on his lifestyle are also kept private. Is he married? Richardson keeps his private light private and tends to keep out of the public eye. As a result, very little is known about his relationship status, or whether he is married. He is active on Twitter but sticks to posting almost exclusively sports and work updates. On Instagram Richardson has a little over 5,000 followers, and sometimes posts snaps from his travels.

That will need to happen between the first day of the waiver period (right after the Super Bowl) and the fifth day of the league year, which begins on March 13. The transaction will result in $89 million in cap charges, arising from money already paid and his 2024 fully-guaranteed compensation of $39 million. The Broncos can either take the entire hit in 2024, or they can designate Wilson as a post-June 1 release and limit the cap charge to $35.4 million in 2024 and $53.6 million in 2025. The Broncos eventually would get a credit for Wilson’s earnings elsewhere in 2024. If he takes the one-year veteran minimum of $1.21 million from his next team, that’s all the Broncos will get by way of credit. It’s still better than the cap consequences of keeping him. His cap number for 2024 would be $35.4 million under his current deal, along with $55.4 million in 2025. That’s $90.8 million. Also, cutting him saves $37 million in cash. Will this hurt Denver’s ability to field the most competitive team possible in 2024? Sure. But it won’t be impossible. The Buccaneers are closing in on a division championship despite carrying more than , with $35 million of it coming from Tom Brady. Also, with the cap going up and up and up, the relative impact of seemingly staggering cap charges continues to drop as the cap continues to rise.","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:23:09","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9381b29/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3616x2034+0+189/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F50%2F1a%2F7e034df14288a5c7d422ee1eab83%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D22078867","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"7bccc5808f8662f8ebe749e7bd9155a7","title":"Cameron Norrie raring to go for new season and to put poor form behind him","link":"https://news.stv.tv/sport/cameron-norrie-raring-to-go-for-new-season-and-to-put-poor-form-behind-him","keywords":["football","sport"],"creator":["Andy Coyle"],"video_url":null,"description":"The British number one will begin the new season playing for Great Britain at the United Cup.","content":"Cameron Norrie is raring to go for the new season as he looks to put burn-out and a disappointing run of form behind him. The British number one slipped from eighth in the rankings last October to 18th at the end of the 2023 season, losing nine of his last 11 matches. Norrie started the year in fine fashion, beating Rafael Nadal, Taylor Fritz and Alex De Minaur at the United Cup before winning his fifth ATP Tour title in Rio, defeating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. But that good form tailed off dramatically, and Norrie told the PA news agency: “It was still a great year but I was disappointed with the end of it. “I played well in South America then I lost a lot of close matches towards the end of the year and the confidence dropped a little bit. I think that’s tennis. You drop slightly and that’s the difference between being ranked eight and being ranked 18. But I can’t wait for next season. “I was winning every big match at the beginning of the year – every three-setter, every tough moment I was coming through and I was doing the right thing. It’s a good lesson there to hold onto that confidence and don’t take it for granted.” Norrie, who is an ambassador for Lexus, is justifiably proud of the work ethic and dedication that has been a huge part of his rise to the top of the game. But he also acknowledges that his efforts took their toll at the end of the season, with the 28-year-old taking two weeks off after a second-round defeat to Alexander Zverev in Vienna in October before returning for the Davis Cup Finals last month. Norrie’s loss to Novak Djokovic ended Great Britain’s campaign in the quarter-finals but it was a performance that offered him encouragement for 2024. “Next year for sure I’m going to look at the schedule and maybe take one or two weeks to really give myself another week’s rest or another week’s preparation to play well at the biggest tournaments,” said Norrie, who has added Australian Stephen Huss to his coaching team. “It’s a tough one because you never know when you’re going to be burned out, what you can take. We played quite a lot but I was ready for every single week. I think I played more matches than anyone else in the last three years on tour. “That can add up but I was feeling pretty good throughout the whole year and just a little bit towards the end when I was in Asia I think it just caught up with me a little bit and I just needed a small break. I took two weeks off and I came back and I was so pumped to hit the ball, so clear what to do.” Norrie has been training at his home in Monte-Carlo, including trekking into the mountains with fitness trainer Vasek Jursik, and will begin his 2024 season on Friday when he teams up with Katie Boulter at the United Cup in Perth, where Britain will take on hosts Australia and the USA. Team GB fans – Let’s get it GOING! 🇬🇧 Reaching the top 10 may already have exceeded most people’s expectations for him but Norrie certainly does not believe he has peaked yet and, with Novak Djokovic turning 37 in May, he hopes he can be one of the players to take advantage of a forthcoming new era in the sport. He said: “I want to win big tournaments. I just need to look at how to prepare for those, and I need to be playing my best for those. “I need to stay very patient with myself. My team’s been excellent, I’ve got all the tools, so it’s just about preparing as well as I can and be ready to play well in the weeks where I have opportunities. “There’s always going to be guys dominating, maybe (Carlos) Alcaraz, possibly (Jannik) Sinner, so there’s always going to be those top guys to beat, but it’s definitely an exciting time in the history of tennis and nice for me to be playing in it. “I don’t see any reason why (I can’t be a contender). I’ve had wins over Alcaraz and some other top players. Everyone’s improving so it just gets tougher but I’m feeling good.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:22:42","image_url":"https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/9a99eeb7b4700ad6383c73bb06256ddc-1703762316-1277x720.jpg","source_id":"stv_tv","source_priority":56826,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"550bfb129611dd5f90c1866b5d52ed32","title":"Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков","link":"https://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/news/gogniev-rasskazal-o-vazhnosti-zrelischnogo-futbola-dlya-bolelschikov-2162582/","keywords":["футбол - рпл"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Бывший главный тренер «Химок» Спартак Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков.","content":"Бывший главный тренер «Химок» Спартак Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков. «Я ни в коем случае не упрекаю людей, которые играют от обороны, потому что они приходят и видят, какая у них команда, и это их дело — как играть.

Ratcliffe has reached an agreement to buy a 25 per cent stake in the club for £1.3bn, which will become 29 per cent when his £250m investment into the infrastructure at United in converted into more shares. It will now take an estimated six to eight weeks for the Premier League to approve Ratcliffe’s investment, and if the Glazers decide to pull the plug on the deal in the meantime they will have to pay Ratcliffe $48m plus an amount not to exceed $18m to cover his expenses within three business days as a termination fee. Ratcliffe also has the first option to buy if the Glazers, whose stake will be reduced to 49 per cent of the club, are selling more of their shares within a year. But if the Glazers conclude a full sale of the club in 18 months time, the Ineos boss would be obliged to sell his shares for $33 each, the price he paid for them, in what is known as a ‘drag-along’. The Telegraph revealed on Wednesday that Man Utd ‘could not sack Erik ten Hag or make a significant signing without consulting Ineos’ . The 71-year-old United fan will receive two seats on the board of the club, which he will delegate to former Juventus CEO Jean-Claude Blanc and the cycling boss Sir Dave Brailsford, and two on the board of the PLC, which will go to Ineos chief financial officer John Reece and Rob Nevin, the chairman of Ineos Sport. Football Insider claim that Ratcliffe is currently considering whether to expand Old Trafford to hold 90,000 fans or build an entirely new venue, with senior figures believing the process will take up to eight years. Neither option has been ruled out by Ineos, who have predicted that a brand new stadium would cost around £2bn. That would mean United could remain at their current home rather than being re-based for two years or more, which would be the case if they opted for the expansion of Old Trafford.

The World Cup winner has enjoyed a sensational start to life at his new club after leaving Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. Messi has scored 11 goals in 14 appearances and inspired their Leagues Cup triumph, the club's first ever trophy win. Results in the MLS weren't as positive though as they finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, as their season finished in October. Speculation over a potential loan for Messi to maintain his fitness arose at the end of the campaign, although this was played down . The 36-year-old has remained at the club ahead of the new campaign and has clearly been putting in the work whilst away from the pitch. Taking to Instagram, he posted what appeared to be a post-workout gym picture on his story. Standing alongside his wife Antonela, Messi looked ripped and in great condition as he approaches a return to action. Inter Miami have a series of friendly matches scheduled ahead of the 2024 MLS season, with the squad first travelling to Saudi Arabia. They will face Al Hilal at the end of February before playing Al Nassr, with Messi set to play against fellow legend Cristiano Ronaldo again. A match away at Japanese side Vissel Kobe is then followed by a home fixture versus Newell’s Old Boys, Messi's childhood club . Inter Miami's first match back in the MLS sees them host Western Conference side Real Salt Lake on February 21. Messi will be hoping he can replicate this year's efforts in the new season as the Floridian side eye a better campaign than the last. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner still possesses an abundance of quality as the legend plays in the twilight years of his amazing career.","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:31:03","image_url":"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/10/lionel-messi-10-inter-miami-833425147.jpg?strip=all&w=960","source_id":"talksport","source_priority":4624,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"c37d2a75c0d8a22db5d4bc7ed81e07e1","title":"Who is TV presenter James Richardson?","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/11714689/james-richardson-who-net-worth/","keywords":["sport","celebrity relationships and break ups","channel 5","evg","explainers","net worths"],"creator":["Laura Stewart-Liberty"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"JAMES RICHARDSON is a familiar face on our screens, best known for presenting shows on everything from Football to strongmen. But who is he? Here’s all you need to know about the legendary sports commentator. 1 James Richardson presents the World's Strongest Man competition on Channel 5. Who is James Richardson? James Richardson is a sports television presenter and journalist born in Bristol on May 29, 1966. Richardson has been on our screens since 1992, starting with a ten-year run as the presenter of Channel 4’s Football Italia programme , which was cult viewing for football fans until 2002. Football Italia centred on live coverage of Serie A, Italy’s top football division. Richardson won fans and supporters thanks to his original reporting style, and sense of humour. A multilinguist — Richardson speaks Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese — Richardson was well positioned for the presenting role. The show was filmed in Italy and often featured Richardson simply sitting in a cafe with a coffee and a brioche, taking viewers through the Italian newspaper sports pages. Richardson is also known to be a fan of the Italian team A.S. Roma . In 2002, Football Italia’s viewing figures dropped, and it moved from Channel 4 to other channels — Richardson went with it, but ultimately left the show altogether in 2006.

After leaving Football Italia, Richardson soon moved to The Guardian Football Weekly podcast, where he stayed until 2017. Leaving The Guardian, Richardson set up podcasts from The Athletic, The Totally Football Show, and Golazzo: The Totally Italian Football Show. Richardson also hosts TNT Sport’s The UEFA Champions League Goals Show, alongside James Horncastle, Raphael Honigstein, and Julien Laurens. He presents Channel 5’s World Strongest Man programme and has worked with the Premier League presenting their Fantasy Premier League content. Does James Richardson present World's Strongest Man? Richardson has presented the World’s Strongest Man competition, broadcast on Channel Five, since 2011. He presents the show, alongside Michelle Ackerley , and 2017 winner Eddie Hall . The World’s Strongest Man has been a festive television fixture since 1977. The World’s Strongest Man competition is broadcast throughout December, and the final is on January 1, 2024 at 7 pm. In 2021, Tom Stoltman became the first Scot to win the competition, before winning again in 2022. What is James Richardson's net worth? Richardson’s net worth is estimated to be between £100,000 and £1 million. But details on his sports presenting salary and official net worth have yet to be confirmed. Thanks to his successful presenting career, Richardson has had the opportunity to travel widely — but details on his lifestyle are also kept private. Is he married? Richardson keeps his private light private and tends to keep out of the public eye. As a result, very little is known about his relationship status, or whether he is married. He is active on Twitter but sticks to posting almost exclusively sports and work updates. On Instagram Richardson has a little over 5,000 followers, and sometimes posts snaps from his travels.

That will need to happen between the first day of the waiver period (right after the Super Bowl) and the fifth day of the league year, which begins on March 13. The transaction will result in $89 million in cap charges, arising from money already paid and his 2024 fully-guaranteed compensation of $39 million. The Broncos can either take the entire hit in 2024, or they can designate Wilson as a post-June 1 release and limit the cap charge to $35.4 million in 2024 and $53.6 million in 2025. The Broncos eventually would get a credit for Wilson’s earnings elsewhere in 2024. If he takes the one-year veteran minimum of $1.21 million from his next team, that’s all the Broncos will get by way of credit. It’s still better than the cap consequences of keeping him. His cap number for 2024 would be $35.4 million under his current deal, along with $55.4 million in 2025. That’s $90.8 million. Also, cutting him saves $37 million in cash. Will this hurt Denver’s ability to field the most competitive team possible in 2024? Sure. But it won’t be impossible. The Buccaneers are closing in on a division championship despite carrying more than , with $35 million of it coming from Tom Brady. Also, with the cap going up and up and up, the relative impact of seemingly staggering cap charges continues to drop as the cap continues to rise.","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:23:09","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9381b29/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3616x2034+0+189/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F50%2F1a%2F7e034df14288a5c7d422ee1eab83%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D22078867","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"7bccc5808f8662f8ebe749e7bd9155a7","title":"Cameron Norrie raring to go for new season and to put poor form behind him","link":"https://news.stv.tv/sport/cameron-norrie-raring-to-go-for-new-season-and-to-put-poor-form-behind-him","keywords":["football","sport"],"creator":["Andy Coyle"],"video_url":null,"description":"The British number one will begin the new season playing for Great Britain at the United Cup.","content":"Cameron Norrie is raring to go for the new season as he looks to put burn-out and a disappointing run of form behind him. The British number one slipped from eighth in the rankings last October to 18th at the end of the 2023 season, losing nine of his last 11 matches. Norrie started the year in fine fashion, beating Rafael Nadal, Taylor Fritz and Alex De Minaur at the United Cup before winning his fifth ATP Tour title in Rio, defeating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. But that good form tailed off dramatically, and Norrie told the PA news agency: “It was still a great year but I was disappointed with the end of it. “I played well in South America then I lost a lot of close matches towards the end of the year and the confidence dropped a little bit. I think that’s tennis. You drop slightly and that’s the difference between being ranked eight and being ranked 18. But I can’t wait for next season. “I was winning every big match at the beginning of the year – every three-setter, every tough moment I was coming through and I was doing the right thing. It’s a good lesson there to hold onto that confidence and don’t take it for granted.” Norrie, who is an ambassador for Lexus, is justifiably proud of the work ethic and dedication that has been a huge part of his rise to the top of the game. But he also acknowledges that his efforts took their toll at the end of the season, with the 28-year-old taking two weeks off after a second-round defeat to Alexander Zverev in Vienna in October before returning for the Davis Cup Finals last month. Norrie’s loss to Novak Djokovic ended Great Britain’s campaign in the quarter-finals but it was a performance that offered him encouragement for 2024. “Next year for sure I’m going to look at the schedule and maybe take one or two weeks to really give myself another week’s rest or another week’s preparation to play well at the biggest tournaments,” said Norrie, who has added Australian Stephen Huss to his coaching team. “It’s a tough one because you never know when you’re going to be burned out, what you can take. We played quite a lot but I was ready for every single week. I think I played more matches than anyone else in the last three years on tour. “That can add up but I was feeling pretty good throughout the whole year and just a little bit towards the end when I was in Asia I think it just caught up with me a little bit and I just needed a small break. I took two weeks off and I came back and I was so pumped to hit the ball, so clear what to do.” Norrie has been training at his home in Monte-Carlo, including trekking into the mountains with fitness trainer Vasek Jursik, and will begin his 2024 season on Friday when he teams up with Katie Boulter at the United Cup in Perth, where Britain will take on hosts Australia and the USA. Team GB fans – Let’s get it GOING! 🇬🇧 Reaching the top 10 may already have exceeded most people’s expectations for him but Norrie certainly does not believe he has peaked yet and, with Novak Djokovic turning 37 in May, he hopes he can be one of the players to take advantage of a forthcoming new era in the sport. He said: “I want to win big tournaments. I just need to look at how to prepare for those, and I need to be playing my best for those. “I need to stay very patient with myself. My team’s been excellent, I’ve got all the tools, so it’s just about preparing as well as I can and be ready to play well in the weeks where I have opportunities. “There’s always going to be guys dominating, maybe (Carlos) Alcaraz, possibly (Jannik) Sinner, so there’s always going to be those top guys to beat, but it’s definitely an exciting time in the history of tennis and nice for me to be playing in it. “I don’t see any reason why (I can’t be a contender). I’ve had wins over Alcaraz and some other top players. Everyone’s improving so it just gets tougher but I’m feeling good.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:22:42","image_url":"https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/9a99eeb7b4700ad6383c73bb06256ddc-1703762316-1277x720.jpg","source_id":"stv_tv","source_priority":56826,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"550bfb129611dd5f90c1866b5d52ed32","title":"Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков","link":"https://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/news/gogniev-rasskazal-o-vazhnosti-zrelischnogo-futbola-dlya-bolelschikov-2162582/","keywords":["футбол - рпл"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Бывший главный тренер «Химок» Спартак Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков.","content":"Бывший главный тренер «Химок» Спартак Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков. «Я ни в коем случае не упрекаю людей, которые играют от обороны, потому что они приходят и видят, какая у них команда, и это их дело — как играть.

Ratcliffe has reached an agreement to buy a 25 per cent stake in the club for £1.3bn, which will become 29 per cent when his £250m investment into the infrastructure at United in converted into more shares. It will now take an estimated six to eight weeks for the Premier League to approve Ratcliffe’s investment, and if the Glazers decide to pull the plug on the deal in the meantime they will have to pay Ratcliffe $48m plus an amount not to exceed $18m to cover his expenses within three business days as a termination fee. Ratcliffe also has the first option to buy if the Glazers, whose stake will be reduced to 49 per cent of the club, are selling more of their shares within a year. But if the Glazers conclude a full sale of the club in 18 months time, the Ineos boss would be obliged to sell his shares for $33 each, the price he paid for them, in what is known as a ‘drag-along’. The Telegraph revealed on Wednesday that Man Utd ‘could not sack Erik ten Hag or make a significant signing without consulting Ineos’ . The 71-year-old United fan will receive two seats on the board of the club, which he will delegate to former Juventus CEO Jean-Claude Blanc and the cycling boss Sir Dave Brailsford, and two on the board of the PLC, which will go to Ineos chief financial officer John Reece and Rob Nevin, the chairman of Ineos Sport. Football Insider claim that Ratcliffe is currently considering whether to expand Old Trafford to hold 90,000 fans or build an entirely new venue, with senior figures believing the process will take up to eight years. Neither option has been ruled out by Ineos, who have predicted that a brand new stadium would cost around £2bn.

The World Cup winner has enjoyed a sensational start to life at his new club after leaving Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. Messi has scored 11 goals in 14 appearances and inspired their Leagues Cup triumph, the club's first ever trophy win. Results in the MLS weren't as positive though as they finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, as their season finished in October. Speculation over a potential loan for Messi to maintain his fitness arose at the end of the campaign, although this was played down . The 36-year-old has remained at the club ahead of the new campaign and has clearly been putting in the work whilst away from the pitch. Taking to Instagram, he posted what appeared to be a post-workout gym picture on his story. Standing alongside his wife Antonela, Messi looked ripped and in great condition as he approaches a return to action. Inter Miami have a series of friendly matches scheduled ahead of the 2024 MLS season, with the squad first travelling to Saudi Arabia. They will face Al Hilal at the end of February before playing Al Nassr, with Messi set to play against fellow legend Cristiano Ronaldo again. A match away at Japanese side Vissel Kobe is then followed by a home fixture versus Newell’s Old Boys, Messi's childhood club . Inter Miami's first match back in the MLS sees them host Western Conference side Real Salt Lake on February 21. Messi will be hoping he can replicate this year's efforts in the new season as the Floridian side eye a better campaign than the last.

But who is he? Here’s all you need to know about the legendary sports commentator. 1 James Richardson presents the World's Strongest Man competition on Channel 5. Who is James Richardson? James Richardson is a sports television presenter and journalist born in Bristol on May 29, 1966. Richardson has been on our screens since 1992, starting with a ten-year run as the presenter of Channel 4’s Football Italia programme , which was cult viewing for football fans until 2002. Football Italia centred on live coverage of Serie A, Italy’s top football division. Richardson won fans and supporters thanks to his original reporting style, and sense of humour. A multilinguist — Richardson speaks Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese — Richardson was well positioned for the presenting role. The show was filmed in Italy and often featured Richardson simply sitting in a cafe with a coffee and a brioche, taking viewers through the Italian newspaper sports pages. Richardson is also known to be a fan of the Italian team A.S. Roma . In 2002, Football Italia’s viewing figures dropped, and it moved from Channel 4 to other channels — Richardson went with it, but ultimately left the show altogether in 2006.

After leaving Football Italia, Richardson soon moved to The Guardian Football Weekly podcast, where he stayed until 2017. Leaving The Guardian, Richardson set up podcasts from The Athletic, The Totally Football Show, and Golazzo: The Totally Italian Football Show. Richardson also hosts TNT Sport’s The UEFA Champions League Goals Show, alongside James Horncastle, Raphael Honigstein, and Julien Laurens. He presents Channel 5’s World Strongest Man programme and has worked with the Premier League presenting their Fantasy Premier League content. Does James Richardson present World's Strongest Man? Richardson has presented the World’s Strongest Man competition, broadcast on Channel Five, since 2011. He presents the show, alongside Michelle Ackerley , and 2017 winner Eddie Hall . The World’s Strongest Man has been a festive television fixture since 1977. The World’s Strongest Man competition is broadcast throughout December, and the final is on January 1, 2024 at 7 pm. In 2021, Tom Stoltman became the first Scot to win the competition, before winning again in 2022. What is James Richardson's net worth? Richardson’s net worth is estimated to be between £100,000 and £1 million. But details on his sports presenting salary and official net worth have yet to be confirmed. Thanks to his successful presenting career, Richardson has had the opportunity to travel widely — but details on his lifestyle are also kept private. Is he married? Richardson keeps his private light private and tends to keep out of the public eye. As a result, very little is known about his relationship status, or whether he is married. He is active on Twitter but sticks to posting almost exclusively sports and work updates. On Instagram Richardson has a little over 5,000 followers, and sometimes posts snaps from his travels.

That will need to happen between the first day of the waiver period (right after the Super Bowl) and the fifth day of the league year, which begins on March 13. The transaction will result in $89 million in cap charges, arising from money already paid and his 2024 fully-guaranteed compensation of $39 million. The Broncos can either take the entire hit in 2024, or they can designate Wilson as a post-June 1 release and limit the cap charge to $35.4 million in 2024 and $53.6 million in 2025. The Broncos eventually would get a credit for Wilson’s earnings elsewhere in 2024. If he takes the one-year veteran minimum of $1.21 million from his next team, that’s all the Broncos will get by way of credit. It’s still better than the cap consequences of keeping him. His cap number for 2024 would be $35.4 million under his current deal, along with $55.4 million in 2025. That’s $90.8 million. Also, cutting him saves $37 million in cash. Will this hurt Denver’s ability to field the most competitive team possible in 2024? Sure. But it won’t be impossible. The Buccaneers are closing in on a division championship despite carrying more than , with $35 million of it coming from Tom Brady. Also, with the cap going up and up and up, the relative impact of seemingly staggering cap charges continues to drop as the cap continues to rise.","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:23:09","image_url":"https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9381b29/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3616x2034+0+189/resize/1920x1080!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F50%2F1a%2F7e034df14288a5c7d422ee1eab83%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D22078867","source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"7bccc5808f8662f8ebe749e7bd9155a7","title":"Cameron Norrie raring to go for new season and to put poor form behind him","link":"https://news.stv.tv/sport/cameron-norrie-raring-to-go-for-new-season-and-to-put-poor-form-behind-him","keywords":["football","sport"],"creator":["Andy Coyle"],"video_url":null,"description":"The British number one will begin the new season playing for Great Britain at the United Cup.","content":"Cameron Norrie is raring to go for the new season as he looks to put burn-out and a disappointing run of form behind him. The British number one slipped from eighth in the rankings last October to 18th at the end of the 2023 season, losing nine of his last 11 matches. Norrie started the year in fine fashion, beating Rafael Nadal, Taylor Fritz and Alex De Minaur at the United Cup before winning his fifth ATP Tour title in Rio, defeating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. But that good form tailed off dramatically, and Norrie told the PA news agency: “It was still a great year but I was disappointed with the end of it. “I played well in South America then I lost a lot of close matches towards the end of the year and the confidence dropped a little bit. I think that’s tennis. You drop slightly and that’s the difference between being ranked eight and being ranked 18. But I can’t wait for next season. “I was winning every big match at the beginning of the year – every three-setter, every tough moment I was coming through and I was doing the right thing. It’s a good lesson there to hold onto that confidence and don’t take it for granted.” Norrie, who is an ambassador for Lexus, is justifiably proud of the work ethic and dedication that has been a huge part of his rise to the top of the game. But he also acknowledges that his efforts took their toll at the end of the season, with the 28-year-old taking two weeks off after a second-round defeat to Alexander Zverev in Vienna in October before returning for the Davis Cup Finals last month. Norrie’s loss to Novak Djokovic ended Great Britain’s campaign in the quarter-finals but it was a performance that offered him encouragement for 2024. “Next year for sure I’m going to look at the schedule and maybe take one or two weeks to really give myself another week’s rest or another week’s preparation to play well at the biggest tournaments,” said Norrie, who has added Australian Stephen Huss to his coaching team. “It’s a tough one because you never know when you’re going to be burned out, what you can take. We played quite a lot but I was ready for every single week. I think I played more matches than anyone else in the last three years on tour. “That can add up but I was feeling pretty good throughout the whole year and just a little bit towards the end when I was in Asia I think it just caught up with me a little bit and I just needed a small break. I took two weeks off and I came back and I was so pumped to hit the ball, so clear what to do.” Norrie has been training at his home in Monte-Carlo, including trekking into the mountains with fitness trainer Vasek Jursik, and will begin his 2024 season on Friday when he teams up with Katie Boulter at the United Cup in Perth, where Britain will take on hosts Australia and the USA. Team GB fans – Let’s get it GOING! 🇬🇧 Reaching the top 10 may already have exceeded most people’s expectations for him but Norrie certainly does not believe he has peaked yet and, with Novak Djokovic turning 37 in May, he hopes he can be one of the players to take advantage of a forthcoming new era in the sport. He said: “I want to win big tournaments. I just need to look at how to prepare for those, and I need to be playing my best for those. “I need to stay very patient with myself. My team’s been excellent, I’ve got all the tools, so it’s just about preparing as well as I can and be ready to play well in the weeks where I have opportunities. “There’s always going to be guys dominating, maybe (Carlos) Alcaraz, possibly (Jannik) Sinner, so there’s always going to be those top guys to beat, but it’s definitely an exciting time in the history of tennis and nice for me to be playing in it. “I don’t see any reason why (I can’t be a contender). I’ve had wins over Alcaraz and some other top players. Everyone’s improving so it just gets tougher but I’m feeling good.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country","pubDate":"2023-12-28 11:22:42","image_url":"https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/9a99eeb7b4700ad6383c73bb06256ddc-1703762316-1277x720.jpg","source_id":"stv_tv","source_priority":56826,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"550bfb129611dd5f90c1866b5d52ed32","title":"Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков","link":"https://www.sport-express.ru/football/rfpl/news/gogniev-rasskazal-o-vazhnosti-zrelischnogo-futbola-dlya-bolelschikov-2162582/","keywords":["футбол - рпл"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Бывший главный тренер «Химок» Спартак Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков.","content":"Бывший главный тренер «Химок» Спартак Гогниев рассказал о важности зрелищного футбола для болельщиков. «Я ни в коем случае не упрекаю людей, которые играют от обороны, потому что они приходят и видят, какая у них команда, и это их дело — как играть.

The Telegraph revealed on Wednesday that Man Utd ‘could not sack Erik ten Hag or make a significant signing without consulting Ineos’ . The 71-year-old United fan will receive two seats on the board of the club, which he will delegate to former Juventus CEO Jean-Claude Blanc and the cycling boss Sir Dave Brailsford, and two on the board of the PLC, which will go to Ineos chief financial officer John Reece and Rob Nevin, the chairman of Ineos Sport. Football Insider claim that Ratcliffe is currently considering whether to expand Old Trafford to hold 90,000 fans or build an entirely new venue, with senior figures believing the process will take up to eight years. Neither option has been ruled out by Ineos, who have predicted that a brand new stadium would cost around £2bn. That would mean United could remain at their current home rather than being re-based for two years or more, which would be the case if they opted for the expansion of Old Trafford.
