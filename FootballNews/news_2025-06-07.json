Both teams are on six points from two wins while BVI lost both games played and have been eliminated from advancing to the next round.It will be only the second time the countries will meet at this level and the first in 31 years since the 1994 Caribbean Football Union Caribbean Cup.Despite the BVI losing 3-0 to Dominica on Wednesday, McClaren said they are not taking them lightly.“They have got players who can play football and they can score, especially on set pieces and we have to be very aware,” he said. “We have to be focused, ruthless and make sure that we get the three points.”The Reggae Boyz had preparation for the games from their participation in the Unity Cup in London last week where they beat Trinidad and Tobago 3-2 in the semi-final, before losing to Nigeria on penalties in the final after coming from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw in regulation time.McClaren has also added new players to the squad that will go almost immediately into the Concacaf Gold Cup and said in yesterday’s pre-game press conference that being able to watch BVI against Dominica a few days before their game was a good advantage.“I think, certainly, with the new coach they’ve got [David Asensio], they are trying to play football, trying to do it the right way, and I commend them for that.”It is uncertain whether McClaren would stick to his Unity Cup line-up despite the return of a number of regulars to the squad.Goalkeeper and captain Andre Blake, wing-back Greg Leigh, centre-back Damion Lowe, as well as attacking players Demarai Gray and Leon Bailey are eligible for selection but Renaldo Cephas, who was involved in four of the five goals scored last week, as well as local-based defender Richard King could have pencilled their names in on the start sheet.Asked on Friday whether the players had enough time to form a cohesive unit in such a short time, McClaren said it was a familiar situation.“I think we had the same situation in London,” he said. “We had 17 players who didn’t know each other, and we had to jam them together very quickly for the training that came.“We grew as the week went on. Got more players and the spirit was good. We have to continue that spirit with about eight players coming in. So, you know, we start again with preparation for this game and Guatemala — two huge games for us.“The goal is, one, to win the game, and two, would be nice to have the 1,000 Jamaicans living on this island all of them turn up and watch the Reggae Boyz.”McClaren said there was no time to make excuses.“This is what Concacaf and Caribbean World Cup qualifying football is about,” he said. “Its all about adversity, travel, getting there late and only having one day to prepare. You know, we’ve had that the last two weeks, so it’s good for the players, great experience, stop moaning, just get over the game, do your job and win.”McClaren was more concerned with the earlier-than-usual start time.“There are many milestones to get through, one at a time,” he said. “We are focused on BVI. It’s not going to be easy. A 3:00 pm kick-off, the heat, and we have to make sure that we are right mentally and physically to win a game.”","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-07 05:10:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/028d5f49d56ad75ce6322f6303c28cc4-1024x716.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicaobserver","source_name":"Jamaica Observer","source_priority":14529,"source_url":"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/jamaicaobserver.png","language":"english","country":["jamaica"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"4b843c5c4538c68f9eeb46cad8928418","title":"Бразилецът Рилдо пристига на „Герена“ до часове (снимка)","link":"https://gong.bg/bg-football/efbet-liga/multimedia/video/brazilecyt-rildo-pristiga-na-gerena-do-chasove-snimka-845622","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"description":"Бразилският офанзивен футболист Рилдо е на път да се присъедини към Левски.

Both teams are on six points from two wins while BVI lost both games played and have been eliminated from advancing to the next round.It will be only the second time the countries will meet at this level and the first in 31 years since the 1994 Caribbean Football Union Caribbean Cup.Despite the BVI losing 3-0 to Dominica on Wednesday, McClaren said they are not taking them lightly.“They have got players who can play football and they can score, especially on set pieces and we have to be very aware,” he said. “We have to be focused, ruthless and make sure that we get the three points.”The Reggae Boyz had preparation for the games from their participation in the Unity Cup in London last week where they beat Trinidad and Tobago 3-2 in the semi-final, before losing to Nigeria on penalties in the final after coming from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw in regulation time.McClaren has also added new players to the squad that will go almost immediately into the Concacaf Gold Cup and said in yesterday’s pre-game press conference that being able to watch BVI against Dominica a few days before their game was a good advantage.“I think, certainly, with the new coach they’ve got [David Asensio], they are trying to play football, trying to do it the right way, and I commend them for that.”It is uncertain whether McClaren would stick to his Unity Cup line-up despite the return of a number of regulars to the squad.Goalkeeper and captain Andre Blake, wing-back Greg Leigh, centre-back Damion Lowe, as well as attacking players Demarai Gray and Leon Bailey are eligible for selection but Renaldo Cephas, who was involved in four of the five goals scored last week, as well as local-based defender Richard King could have pencilled their names in on the start sheet.Asked on Friday whether the players had enough time to form a cohesive unit in such a short time, McClaren said it was a familiar situation.“I think we had the same situation in London,” he said. “We had 17 players who didn’t know each other, and we had to jam them together very quickly for the training that came.“We grew as the week went on. Got more players and the spirit was good. We have to continue that spirit with about eight players coming in. So, you know, we start again with preparation for this game and Guatemala — two huge games for us.“The goal is, one, to win the game, and two, would be nice to have the 1,000 Jamaicans living on this island all of them turn up and watch the Reggae Boyz.”McClaren said there was no time to make excuses.“This is what Concacaf and Caribbean World Cup qualifying football is about,” he said. “Its all about adversity, travel, getting there late and only having one day to prepare. You know, we’ve had that the last two weeks, so it’s good for the players, great experience, stop moaning, just get over the game, do your job and win.”McClaren was more concerned with the earlier-than-usual start time.“There are many milestones to get through, one at a time,” he said. “We are focused on BVI. It’s not going to be easy. A 3:00 pm kick-off, the heat, and we have to make sure that we are right mentally and physically to win a game.”","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-06-07 05:10:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/028d5f49d56ad75ce6322f6303c28cc4-1024x716.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"jamaicaobserver","source_name":"Jamaica Observer","source_priority":14529,"source_url":"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/jamaicaobserver.png","language":"english","country":["jamaica"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"4b843c5c4538c68f9eeb46cad8928418","title":"Бразилецът Рилдо пристига на „Герена“ до часове (снимка)","link":"https://gong.bg/bg-football/efbet-liga/multimedia/video/brazilecyt-rildo-pristiga-na-gerena-do-chasove-snimka-845622","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"description":"Бразилският офанзивен футболист Рилдо е на път да се присъедини към Левски.
