Recall that the Reds were thought to be close to appointing Ruben Amorim earlier this month. However, they have now turned to Feyenoord boss Slot, with Amorim linked to West Ham United.

I've spoken to him a few times and I think what he does and what he sees is very strong. He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent. I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent. He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level. He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club. \"He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money. He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football. \"You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach. I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster.
