The Blues lost 4-1 away at Newcastle last weekend but could be boosted by the returns of both Nkunku and Romeo Lavia , who have yet to debut since their summer transfers. Nkunku and Lavia have trained ahead of Brighton but will have to pass late fitness tests before they are included. \"We need to assess tomorrow and then decide, they are close and tomorrow we will make a decision,\" Pochettino said. \"Lavia is maybe more difficult, but we need to assess Christopher Nkunku tomorrow.\" The Argentine described the defeat last week as his \"worst of the season\" and branded his players \"soft\". He admits Chelsea risk falling behind in the race for the Champions League if that manner of performance continues but he's urged the club to keep faith, and added: \"If it is mathematically [possible], we need to believe it is realistic. \"It is another thing that will be tough to achieve, [qualifying] for European competition, but it is still there. \"Now, the most important thing is not to see the end of the season but to see the process and improve every day. That's the most difficult thing in this process; it is to be focused on today and not tomorrow. That's one aspect we were working on this week.\" Pochettino explained that Chelsea's inconsistency is partly down to his team's tendency to implode. He said: \"It was a tough week for everyone but I am very happy because I think they reacted very well.

Make life easier with these tips \"After you watch the game, it was worse than my feelings after the game. I was tough with them inside and outside [in the media]. \"But that was my feelings with them, because I think our approach was wrong so we take responsibility too. We are our own worst enemies and need to focus on ourselves. Mauricio Pochettino \"It was a good week to realise what we need to improve, to be more consistent and mature. We didn't do things we cannot afford not to do in this process. I am very, very happy so far, even if it was tough in training and our meetings. \"But sometimes these situations help you improve. It's not the opponent, we can see it against Tottenham, Manchester City and Newcastle. \"You could easily say the one we were most likely to take points against was Newcastle because they had to play Paris Saint-Germain three days later, which could have been a distraction. \"Okay, we beat Tottenham and we lost against Newcastle. We are our own worst enemies and need to focus on us. If we are in a good place, we will compete in a good way and Brighton will not be a problem.\" MORE ABOUT Have your say... 22,244 18,529 10,227 7,806 6,482","pubDate":"2023-12-01 14:48:49","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/12/01/14/39/Chelsea%20Training%20Session-k9gkyzei.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","source_priority":2356,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"cbc7956c69ed0435c27271e74b2f1e23","title":"Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou in brutal sin bin verdict","link":"https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/sport/23962455.spurs-boss-ange-postecoglou-brutal-sin-bin-verdict/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ange Postecoglou blasts plans to introduce sin bins into football.","content":"Ange Postecoglou has dismissed and blasted plans to bring in sin bins to football as well as plans for VAR being deployed more widely. Temporary dismissals of players for offences such as dissent and specific tactical fouls were backed by the International Football Association Board at its annual business meeting this week. It was also reported that IFAB has been discussing if VAR could extend its remit to verifying free-kicks, checking second yellow cards that lead to red cards, and for corners, although football‚Äôs lawmakers insist no changes will be made to VAR that would cause more delays in matches. Postecoglou has never been the biggest fan of video technology, but he feels plans for VAR to intervene further would completely ruin the game. He said: ‚ÄúIf I hear one more person say it doesn't re-referee a game, I will explode mate! ‚ÄúThat is exactly what it is doing. It was brought in for clear and obvious errors. A clear and obvious error for me would be if all of us in this room saw something and thought that is definitely wrong. ‚ÄúI think at the moment it is going with the majority of the room saying it is wrong. ‚ÄúJust leave it for what it is there for. If people look at things from seven different angles and slow it down to the minute, that is not a clear and obvious error.‚Äù On potential plans for sin bins, Postecoglou added: ‚ÄúBin it mate. Just bin the whole idea. Just forget about it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why and I think I have already said where I stand on this. I don‚Äôt know why they keep interjecting themselves in the game, there is not that much wrong with the game.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-12-01 14:48:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"glasgowtimes","source_priority":117895,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"93992a46efb63deb6df4b83209aa6ae8","title":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –º–∏—Å–ª–∏ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å –≥—Ä—ä–º–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/transferi/multimedia/video/niukasyl-ne-misli-da-spira-s-grymkite-transferi-766103","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –≤—ä–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä—è–≤–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±–æ–º–±–∏ –∏ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—ä—Ç —Ü–µ–ª—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –µ –æ—â–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∞. \"–°–≤—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ\" —â–µ —Å–µ –æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –≤—ä—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç –†–æ–º–µ–ª—É –õ—É–∫–∞–∫—É –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏—Å—à–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—á–µ –ø—Ä–æ—É—á–≤–∞—Ç —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞. –ë–µ–ª–≥–∏–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ß–µ–ª—Å–∏, –Ω–æ –≤ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –µ –ø–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–µ–º –≤ –†–æ–º–∞. –ï–¥–∏ –•–∞—É —Ä–∞–∑–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞ —Å...","content":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –≤—ä–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä—è–≤–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±–æ–º–±–∏ –∏ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—ä—Ç —Ü–µ–ª—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –µ –æ—â–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∞. \"–°–≤—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ\" —â–µ —Å–µ –æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –≤—ä—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç –†–æ–º–µ–ª—É –õ—É–∫–∞–∫—É –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏—Å—à–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—á–µ –ø—Ä–æ—É—á–≤–∞—Ç —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞. –ë–µ–ª–≥–∏–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ß–µ–ª—Å–∏, –Ω–æ –≤ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –µ –ø–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–µ–º –≤ –†–æ–º–∞. –ï–¥–∏ –•–∞—É —Ä–∞–∑–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞ —Å –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä –ò—Å–∞–∫ –∏ –ö–∞–ª—É–º –£–∏–ª—Å–æ–Ω, –Ω–æ –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –æ—â–µ –µ–¥–∏–Ω –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω –≥–æ–ª–º–∞–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ä —â–µ –¥–æ–Ω–µ—Å–µ –æ—â–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ –∫–ª–∞—Å–∞ –≤ —Å—ä—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞. üö® Newcastle are eyeing a surprise move for former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku.

However, Napoli is at risk of losing the Nigerian player in January or later, as his current contract with the reigning Serie A champions is set to expire in 2025. Osimhen has returned to Napoli‚Äôs squad after recovering from an injury he sustained during Nigeria‚Äôs match against Saudi Arabia in October.

Champions City are second in the Premier League, a point behind Arsenal, with Spurs fifth and three points adrift of their weekend opponents after losing their last three matches and dropping off the top. The trip north will be Tottenham's toughest test yet under their new manager and Guardiola said he was sure there would be plenty of entertainment. \"I met (him) just once in three or four pre-seasons ago when we played in Japan against Yokohama,\" recalled the Spaniard of their only previous encounter. \"Ange was the manager and I saw some clips before. It was the second pre-season game and I said 'wow, there are things that I like'. \"I said to the players (then) I know we are not ready but we will face a good team in challenges, intense in buildup and use the keeper to make the process.\" City won that game but Guardiola said it made him take notice and he had followed Postecoglou's progress at Celtic and now Tottenham. \"I think he makes football a better place, people like Ange,\" he added. \"I‚Äôve said many times that I am a manager but at the same time a spectator, and I enjoy a lot the way they (Spurs) play, the approach they have.\" Postecoglou repaid the compliment in his separate press conference, saying he relished the chance of playing against Guardiola. \"That's the kind of arena you want to be in, measuring yourself against the very best,\" he said. Guardiola said he did not expect Tottenham to change their style, despite defeats and key absences due to injury, and dismissed as a joke a comment from Postecoglou that he was 'copying Pep'. \"Ask him if he's going to change the way they play against us?

The Blues lost 4-1 away at Newcastle last weekend but could be boosted by the returns of both Nkunku and Romeo Lavia , who have yet to debut since their summer transfers. Nkunku and Lavia have trained ahead of Brighton but will have to pass late fitness tests before they are included. \"We need to assess tomorrow and then decide, they are close and tomorrow we will make a decision,\" Pochettino said. \"Lavia is maybe more difficult, but we need to assess Christopher Nkunku tomorrow.\" The Argentine described the defeat last week as his \"worst of the season\" and branded his players \"soft\". He admits Chelsea risk falling behind in the race for the Champions League if that manner of performance continues but he's urged the club to keep faith, and added: \"If it is mathematically [possible], we need to believe it is realistic. \"It is another thing that will be tough to achieve, [qualifying] for European competition, but it is still there. \"Now, the most important thing is not to see the end of the season but to see the process and improve every day. That's the most difficult thing in this process; it is to be focused on today and not tomorrow. That's one aspect we were working on this week.\" Pochettino explained that Chelsea's inconsistency is partly down to his team's tendency to implode. He said: \"It was a tough week for everyone but I am very happy because I think they reacted very well. Dusan Vlahovic addresses Arsenal transfer rumours amid fresh ¬£86m claims Chelsea deliver Nkunku injury latest for possible debut vs Brighton Chelsea need Caicedo back to brilliant Brighton best in Europe hunt Hosting a dinner party?

I was tough with them inside and outside [in the media]. \"But that was my feelings with them, because I think our approach was wrong so we take responsibility too. We are our own worst enemies and need to focus on ourselves. Mauricio Pochettino \"It was a good week to realise what we need to improve, to be more consistent and mature. We didn't do things we cannot afford not to do in this process. I am very, very happy so far, even if it was tough in training and our meetings. \"But sometimes these situations help you improve. It's not the opponent, we can see it against Tottenham, Manchester City and Newcastle. \"You could easily say the one we were most likely to take points against was Newcastle because they had to play Paris Saint-Germain three days later, which could have been a distraction. \"Okay, we beat Tottenham and we lost against Newcastle. We are our own worst enemies and need to focus on us.

Temporary dismissals of players for offences such as dissent and specific tactical fouls were backed by the International Football Association Board at its annual business meeting this week. It was also reported that IFAB has been discussing if VAR could extend its remit to verifying free-kicks, checking second yellow cards that lead to red cards, and for corners, although football‚Äôs lawmakers insist no changes will be made to VAR that would cause more delays in matches. Postecoglou has never been the biggest fan of video technology, but he feels plans for VAR to intervene further would completely ruin the game. He said: ‚ÄúIf I hear one more person say it doesn't re-referee a game, I will explode mate! ‚ÄúThat is exactly what it is doing. It was brought in for clear and obvious errors. A clear and obvious error for me would be if all of us in this room saw something and thought that is definitely wrong. ‚ÄúI think at the moment it is going with the majority of the room saying it is wrong. ‚ÄúJust leave it for what it is there for. If people look at things from seven different angles and slow it down to the minute, that is not a clear and obvious error.‚Äù On potential plans for sin bins, Postecoglou added: ‚ÄúBin it mate. Just bin the whole idea. Just forget about it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why and I think I have already said where I stand on this. I don‚Äôt know why they keep interjecting themselves in the game, there is not that much wrong with the game.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-12-01 14:48:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"glasgowtimes","source_priority":117895,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"93992a46efb63deb6df4b83209aa6ae8","title":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –º–∏—Å–ª–∏ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å –≥—Ä—ä–º–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/transferi/multimedia/video/niukasyl-ne-misli-da-spira-s-grymkite-transferi-766103","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –≤—ä–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä—è–≤–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±–æ–º–±–∏ –∏ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—ä—Ç —Ü–µ–ª—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –µ –æ—â–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∞. \"–°–≤—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ\" —â–µ —Å–µ –æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –≤—ä—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç –†–æ–º–µ–ª—É –õ—É–∫–∞–∫—É –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏—Å—à–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—á–µ –ø—Ä–æ—É—á–≤–∞—Ç —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞. –ë–µ–ª–≥–∏–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ß–µ–ª—Å–∏, –Ω–æ –≤ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –µ –ø–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–µ–º –≤ –†–æ–º–∞. –ï–¥–∏ –•–∞—É —Ä–∞–∑–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞ —Å...","content":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –≤—ä–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä—è–≤–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±–æ–º–±–∏ –∏ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—ä—Ç —Ü–µ–ª—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –µ –æ—â–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∞. \"–°–≤—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ\" —â–µ —Å–µ –æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –≤—ä—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç –†–æ–º–µ–ª—É –õ—É–∫–∞–∫—É –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏—Å—à–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—á–µ –ø—Ä–æ—É—á–≤–∞—Ç —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞. –ë–µ–ª–≥–∏–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ß–µ–ª—Å–∏, –Ω–æ –≤ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –µ –ø–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–µ–º –≤ –†–æ–º–∞. –ï–¥–∏ –•–∞—É —Ä–∞–∑–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞ —Å –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä –ò—Å–∞–∫ –∏ –ö–∞–ª—É–º –£–∏–ª—Å–æ–Ω, –Ω–æ –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –æ—â–µ –µ–¥–∏–Ω –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω –≥–æ–ª–º–∞–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ä —â–µ –¥–æ–Ω–µ—Å–µ –æ—â–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ –∫–ª–∞—Å–∞ –≤ —Å—ä—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞. üö® Newcastle are eyeing a surprise move for former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku.

Osimhen has been linked to several European clubs especially English Premier League‚Äôs Chelsea and Arsenal who are said to be ready to battle for the 24-year-old striker from January next year. Osimhen failed to leave for another club during last summer‚Äôs transfer window because Aurelio De Laurentiis, the President of Napoli, repeatedly declared that the club‚Äôs most valuable asset would not be sold, even if their ‚Ç¨200 million valuation was met. However, Napoli is at risk of losing the Nigerian player in January or later, as his current contract with the reigning Serie A champions is set to expire in 2025. Osimhen has returned to Napoli‚Äôs squad after recovering from an injury he sustained during Nigeria‚Äôs match against Saudi Arabia in October.

The Gunners hammered Lens 6-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday and Mikel Arteta will be able to name the same starting XI this weekend if he wishes. Ben White is pushing to come back into the team at right-back after being on the bench in midweek, while Leandro Trossard is another who could come in. Takehiro Tomiyasu has excelled recently in defence , but Arsenal travel to Luton on Tuesday next week so he could be rotated. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the beauty of it though,‚Äù said Arteta, when asked about the busy schedule at this time of year. ‚ÄúWe wanted to be in that position and we are playing big games every three days and the squad is ready. ‚ÄúPlayers are hungry to play every game, they are disappointed when we have to rest them to manage minutes. That‚Äôs a really good sign.‚Äù Arsenal impressed against Lens and for the first time this season Arteta fielded an exciting front six that had a midfield of Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz - and a front three of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli.

Champions City are second in the Premier League, a point behind Arsenal, with Spurs fifth and three points adrift of their weekend opponents after losing their last three matches and dropping off the top. The trip north will be Tottenham's toughest test yet under their new manager and Guardiola said he was sure there would be plenty of entertainment. \"I met (him) just once in three or four pre-seasons ago when we played in Japan against Yokohama,\" recalled the Spaniard of their only previous encounter. \"Ange was the manager and I saw some clips before. It was the second pre-season game and I said 'wow, there are things that I like'. \"I said to the players (then) I know we are not ready but we will face a good team in challenges, intense in buildup and use the keeper to make the process.\" City won that game but Guardiola said it made him take notice and he had followed Postecoglou's progress at Celtic and now Tottenham. \"I think he makes football a better place, people like Ange,\" he added. \"I‚Äôve said many times that I am a manager but at the same time a spectator, and I enjoy a lot the way they (Spurs) play, the approach they have.\" Postecoglou repaid the compliment in his separate press conference, saying he relished the chance of playing against Guardiola. \"That's the kind of arena you want to be in, measuring yourself against the very best,\" he said. Guardiola said he did not expect Tottenham to change their style, despite defeats and key absences due to injury, and dismissed as a joke a comment from Postecoglou that he was 'copying Pep'. \"Ask him if he's going to change the way they play against us? Absolutely not. This is not going to happen, it would be a surprise,\" he added. Guardiola said England defender John Stones could feature after being on the bench for the last two games while Mateo Kovacic had returned to training earlier in the week and Matheus Nunes was still a way off being fit.","pubDate":"2023-12-01 14:41:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"channelnewsasia","source_priority":37829,"country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0f2e002f46991f9f485301a12acdd496","title":"DIRECT.

The Blues lost 4-1 away at Newcastle last weekend but could be boosted by the returns of both Nkunku and Romeo Lavia , who have yet to debut since their summer transfers. Nkunku and Lavia have trained ahead of Brighton but will have to pass late fitness tests before they are included. \"We need to assess tomorrow and then decide, they are close and tomorrow we will make a decision,\" Pochettino said. \"Lavia is maybe more difficult, but we need to assess Christopher Nkunku tomorrow.\" The Argentine described the defeat last week as his \"worst of the season\" and branded his players \"soft\". He admits Chelsea risk falling behind in the race for the Champions League if that manner of performance continues but he's urged the club to keep faith, and added: \"If it is mathematically [possible], we need to believe it is realistic. \"It is another thing that will be tough to achieve, [qualifying] for European competition, but it is still there. \"Now, the most important thing is not to see the end of the season but to see the process and improve every day. That's the most difficult thing in this process; it is to be focused on today and not tomorrow. That's one aspect we were working on this week.\" Pochettino explained that Chelsea's inconsistency is partly down to his team's tendency to implode. He said: \"It was a tough week for everyone but I am very happy because I think they reacted very well. Dusan Vlahovic addresses Arsenal transfer rumours amid fresh ¬£86m claims Chelsea deliver Nkunku injury latest for possible debut vs Brighton Chelsea need Caicedo back to brilliant Brighton best in Europe hunt Hosting a dinner party?

I was tough with them inside and outside [in the media]. \"But that was my feelings with them, because I think our approach was wrong so we take responsibility too. We are our own worst enemies and need to focus on ourselves. Mauricio Pochettino \"It was a good week to realise what we need to improve, to be more consistent and mature. We didn't do things we cannot afford not to do in this process. I am very, very happy so far, even if it was tough in training and our meetings. \"But sometimes these situations help you improve. It's not the opponent, we can see it against Tottenham, Manchester City and Newcastle. \"You could easily say the one we were most likely to take points against was Newcastle because they had to play Paris Saint-Germain three days later, which could have been a distraction. \"Okay, we beat Tottenham and we lost against Newcastle. We are our own worst enemies and need to focus on us.

Temporary dismissals of players for offences such as dissent and specific tactical fouls were backed by the International Football Association Board at its annual business meeting this week. It was also reported that IFAB has been discussing if VAR could extend its remit to verifying free-kicks, checking second yellow cards that lead to red cards, and for corners, although football‚Äôs lawmakers insist no changes will be made to VAR that would cause more delays in matches. Postecoglou has never been the biggest fan of video technology, but he feels plans for VAR to intervene further would completely ruin the game. He said: ‚ÄúIf I hear one more person say it doesn't re-referee a game, I will explode mate! ‚ÄúThat is exactly what it is doing. It was brought in for clear and obvious errors. A clear and obvious error for me would be if all of us in this room saw something and thought that is definitely wrong. ‚ÄúI think at the moment it is going with the majority of the room saying it is wrong. ‚ÄúJust leave it for what it is there for. If people look at things from seven different angles and slow it down to the minute, that is not a clear and obvious error.‚Äù On potential plans for sin bins, Postecoglou added: ‚ÄúBin it mate. Just bin the whole idea. Just forget about it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why and I think I have already said where I stand on this. I don‚Äôt know why they keep interjecting themselves in the game, there is not that much wrong with the game.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-12-01 14:48:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"glasgowtimes","source_priority":117895,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"93992a46efb63deb6df4b83209aa6ae8","title":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –º–∏—Å–ª–∏ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å –≥—Ä—ä–º–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏","link":"https://gong.bg/football-sviat/transferi/multimedia/video/niukasyl-ne-misli-da-spira-s-grymkite-transferi-766103","keywords":["no"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –≤—ä–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä—è–≤–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±–æ–º–±–∏ –∏ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—ä—Ç —Ü–µ–ª—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –µ –æ—â–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∞. \"–°–≤—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ\" —â–µ —Å–µ –æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –≤—ä—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç –†–æ–º–µ–ª—É –õ—É–∫–∞–∫—É –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏—Å—à–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—á–µ –ø—Ä–æ—É—á–≤–∞—Ç —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞. –ë–µ–ª–≥–∏–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ß–µ–ª—Å–∏, –Ω–æ –≤ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –µ –ø–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–µ–º –≤ –†–æ–º–∞. –ï–¥–∏ –•–∞—É —Ä–∞–∑–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞ —Å...","content":"–ù—é–∫–∞—Å—ä–ª –Ω–µ –≤—ä–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ—Ä—è–≤–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞ —Å —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±–æ–º–±–∏ –∏ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—ä—Ç —Ü–µ–ª—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ä–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –µ –æ—â–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞—Ç–∞. \"–°–≤—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ\" —â–µ —Å–µ –æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –≤—ä—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç –†–æ–º–µ–ª—É –õ—É–∫–∞–∫—É –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏—Å—à–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏–≥–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—á–µ –ø—Ä–æ—É—á–≤–∞—Ç —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞. –ë–µ–ª–≥–∏–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –Ω–∞ –ß–µ–ª—Å–∏, –Ω–æ –≤ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –µ –ø–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–µ–º –≤ –†–æ–º–∞. –ï–¥–∏ –•–∞—É —Ä–∞–∑–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞ —Å –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä –ò—Å–∞–∫ –∏ –ö–∞–ª—É–º –£–∏–ª—Å–æ–Ω, –Ω–æ –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –æ—â–µ –µ–¥–∏–Ω –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω –≥–æ–ª–º–∞–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ä —â–µ –¥–æ–Ω–µ—Å–µ –æ—â–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—á–µ –∫–ª–∞—Å–∞ –≤ —Å—ä—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞. üö® Newcastle are eyeing a surprise move for former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku.

Osimhen has been linked to several European clubs especially English Premier League‚Äôs Chelsea and Arsenal who are said to be ready to battle for the 24-year-old striker from January next year. Osimhen failed to leave for another club during last summer‚Äôs transfer window because Aurelio De Laurentiis, the President of Napoli, repeatedly declared that the club‚Äôs most valuable asset would not be sold, even if their ‚Ç¨200 million valuation was met. However, Napoli is at risk of losing the Nigerian player in January or later, as his current contract with the reigning Serie A champions is set to expire in 2025. Osimhen has returned to Napoli‚Äôs squad after recovering from an injury he sustained during Nigeria‚Äôs match against Saudi Arabia in October.

The Gunners hammered Lens 6-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday and Mikel Arteta will be able to name the same starting XI this weekend if he wishes. Ben White is pushing to come back into the team at right-back after being on the bench in midweek, while Leandro Trossard is another who could come in. Takehiro Tomiyasu has excelled recently in defence , but Arsenal travel to Luton on Tuesday next week so he could be rotated. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the beauty of it though,‚Äù said Arteta, when asked about the busy schedule at this time of year. ‚ÄúWe wanted to be in that position and we are playing big games every three days and the squad is ready. ‚ÄúPlayers are hungry to play every game, they are disappointed when we have to rest them to manage minutes. That‚Äôs a really good sign.‚Äù Arsenal impressed against Lens and for the first time this season Arteta fielded an exciting front six that had a midfield of Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz - and a front three of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli. The Gunners remain without Thomas Partey, Emile Smith Rowe, Fabio Vieira and Jurrien Timber for the visit of Wolves.

Champions City are second in the Premier League, a point behind Arsenal, with Spurs fifth and three points adrift of their weekend opponents after losing their last three matches and dropping off the top. The trip north will be Tottenham's toughest test yet under their new manager and Guardiola said he was sure there would be plenty of entertainment. \"I met (him) just once in three or four pre-seasons ago when we played in Japan against Yokohama,\" recalled the Spaniard of their only previous encounter. \"Ange was the manager and I saw some clips before. It was the second pre-season game and I said 'wow, there are things that I like'. \"I said to the players (then) I know we are not ready but we will face a good team in challenges, intense in buildup and use the keeper to make the process.\" City won that game but Guardiola said it made him take notice and he had followed Postecoglou's progress at Celtic and now Tottenham. \"I think he makes football a better place, people like Ange,\" he added. \"I‚Äôve said many times that I am a manager but at the same time a spectator, and I enjoy a lot the way they (Spurs) play, the approach they have.\" Postecoglou repaid the compliment in his separate press conference, saying he relished the chance of playing against Guardiola. \"That's the kind of arena you want to be in, measuring yourself against the very best,\" he said. Guardiola said he did not expect Tottenham to change their style, despite defeats and key absences due to injury, and dismissed as a joke a comment from Postecoglou that he was 'copying Pep'. \"Ask him if he's going to change the way they play against us? Absolutely not. This is not going to happen, it would be a surprise,\" he added. Guardiola said England defender John Stones could feature after being on the bench for the last two games while Mateo Kovacic had returned to training earlier in the week and Matheus Nunes was still a way off being fit.","pubDate":"2023-12-01 14:41:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"channelnewsasia","source_priority":37829,"country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0f2e002f46991f9f485301a12acdd496","title":"DIRECT.
