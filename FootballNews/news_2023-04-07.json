Similarly, tennis players like Khawaja Iftikhar, Haroon Rahim, Haq brothers, Rashid Malik, Aqeel Khan and Aisam ul Haq have performed well in Davis Cup and other international events. However, since decades Pakistan tennis is roaming around two players i.e. Aisam ul Haq and Aqeel Khan, who are now in their 40s and lost their prime. Resultantly, Pakistan has suffered recently miserable defeats at the hands of Austria and Lithuania.Presently, we have talented potential, supporting parents, experienced coaches and much improved facilities, then why is this standstill. In my opinion it’s due to mishandling of game by some PTF officials who instead of promoting game are promoting nepotism and joyriding, thus destroying game. Due to their negative policies, they have wasted highly talented Abid Ali Akbar, Samir Iftikhar, Muzamal Murtaza and so many others. Now they are all out to waste women talent as well. Recently, the PTF conducted trials for Billie Jean cup and Asian Games to be held in June and September respectively giving exemption to two over 30 players Ushna Suhail and Sara Mahboob. Ushna is daughter of PTF SVP Kh Suhail Iftikhar, married and settled in UK. She has not played any tournament since long, who knows if she is practicing tennis or not. Instead, they have decided not to give a chance to the 21-year-old highly talented Mahin, who is attending tennis academy in Barcelona and had beaten Ushna and Sarah Mehboob on numerous occasions in the past. The trials were also fixed to intrude few other favorites. Why was PTF in a hurry to select such a weak women’s team, that too six months in advance for Asian Games and not bothering to hold trials for the men’s team? The Pakistan Football Federation announced women team on 1st April for 5th April Olympic qualifying match, PCB announced Pakistan team on 4th April for 14th April New Zealand match, then why PTF announced women team six months in advance just to induct favorites. President PTF Mr. Salim Saifullah Khan, who has worked day and night for the betterment of Pakistan tennis, is requested to seriously look into high handedness of evils sheltering in the PTF, who are not only spoiling tennis, wasting his own good work done for tennis promotion and also hell-bent on wasting our young national talent.

Alexander Mandinyenya scored the only goal of the match to end Ndiraya’s winless run. Ndiraya lost against reigning champions FC Platinum 2-1 in the season opener and went on to suffer a 1-0 defeat away to Chicken Inn before holding his former paymasters Dynamos to a 1-1 draw at the National Sports Stadium last week. But despite the win, at the end of the day, the former Warriors assistant coach was not a happy man following a poor display and an unimpressive type of play put up by his team. “Honestly I’m happy with the result but not too happy with the performance. We didn’t play football today and the attitude was not correct and I thought Yadah dominated the entire match,” Ndiraya told journalists. “However in those bad moments I’m happy about how we defended our lead. The play is totally different to our performance against Dynamos. “Maybe it was psychological to play a big team (Dynamos) and get to play a small then you get this performance, it’s not a good show. “We played seasoned contenders , a team with lots of movements and the mobility was just too hot for us to handle but I’m happy that we kept our shape at the end and defended our lead,” he added. Moreover, he expressed his happiness after his first win of the season. “It’s exciting to get the first win of the league, we had a difficult three weeks but I’m happy the win will take a bit of pressure from us and the win will give us confidence as we go into the next match.” His counterpart Expense Chitukutuku was disappointed with the result after his team performed better but couldn’t find the net. Striker Junior Zindoga was wasteful in front of goal. Chitukuku said: “Unfortunately we should have buried this game in the second half with Junior (Zindoga) but they defended very well.” Yadah play Cranborne Bullets in their next match while Simba Bhora face Hwange.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:14:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"nehandaradio","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"We want to keep our heads cool: Bosso defender","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/we-want-to-keep-our-heads-cool-bosso-defender/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS players have agreed to forget about last Sunday’s 2-1 win over FC Platinum as they focus on their next assignment against Chicken Inn this afternoon.

Bosso face their city rivals in what is expected to be an exciting encounter at Barbourfields Stadium. Highlanders have all the momentum going into the game as they are undefeated in three games with two wins and a draw. The Gamecocks on the other hand have won once and drawn twice. Ahead of the meeting between the two sides, Highlanders defender Andrew Mbeba has emphasised on the need to keep cool heads going into the derby. “I think for this Chicken Inn game, we go with the same character of wanting to win but keeping cool heads after the FC Platinum win. We are telling ourselves beating FC Platinum is not winning the league. This is just the start of the season and we have to keep cool heads to ensure we focus on the upcoming games,” said Mbeba. The defender, who is naturally a centre back, has been deployed in the right back position where he has done fairly well. “For me it’s all about maintaining the form that I am in and giving more while making sure that I don’t lose my place in the starting line-up,” said Mbeba. The defender had become a regular on the call-up list of the senior national team before the country was suspended from international football. He has four appearances for the Warriors. Mbeba, the 2019 Premier Soccer League Rookie of the Year, led the Young Warriors to the final of the Cosafa Championship that was held in Zambia in 2018. When he first stepped into the field, playing for the Bosso senior team, he was aged 18. – @innocentskizoe.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CAPS United, Bosso gun for control of PSL race","link":"https://www.herald.co.zw/caps-united-bosso-gun-for-control-of-psl-race/","keywords":["Football","Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League giants CAPS United and Highlanders have the chance to shoot to the top of the table, at least for 72 hours, depending on how they would have fared in their respective matches this afternoon.","content":"CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League giants CAPS United and Highlanders have the chance to shoot to the top of the table, at least for 72 hours, depending on how they would have fared in their respective matches this afternoon. Both the Green Machine and Bosso have seven points to their names, just like leaders Dynamos but they find themselves second and third respectively due to an inferior goal difference. But they have a chance to overtake the Glamour Boys if they win or draw in their respective games this afternoon as Dynamos will not be in action until Monday when they play Cranborne Bullets. Makepekepe and Bosso should however be at their best as they face tricky opponents. CAPS United face Black Rhinos in a Harare derby at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon while Bosso have a date with Chicken Inn in another derby in Bulawayo. With both giants enjoying their game, having won twice and drawn once in their opening three games, they will be looking to continue with their fine form this afternoon. But CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe knows it’s still early days to start talking about topping the log. “We were on top of the log after Match Day One fixtures and it was a good feeling. “But we are currently second and I have been in these trenches for long enough to know it’s still too early in the race,” said Chitembwe. “It is always good to be topping the table or be in that mix. “We are taking each game as it comes. “Black Rhinos are always tough opponents and we ought to take our A-Game with us to stand a good chance against them. “As CAPS United, we are happy with how we have started the season but there is a lot of work that we should also throw into the team. “While we are improving every day, we have to make sure we correct our flaws defensively and offensively. “Improvement is not an overnight process. We have to continue working on areas that we feel we haven’t been good enough. “As a team, we are happy with how we have fared so far in the season. “We are getting into those areas that we always want to be and the passing game is also improving. “We hope to continue on that trajectory. We know Black Rhinos are never easy opponents. They have a very good team and we should play well to stand a chance of collecting the maximum points which is always the aim.” Black Rhinos, on the other hand, know losing to Makepekepe will leave them in a desperate position. The army side had a promising start to the season after beating fellow military outfit Cranborne Bullets on the opening weekend. But a 1-0 defeat to Highlanders and a goalless draw at Bulawayo Chiefs last week left them three points off the pace. And coach Stanford “Stix” Mutizwa believes his team is good enough to collect the maximum against Makepekepe. “Obviously the aim is to win the game. We know what CAPS United is capable of doing. They are a big team and they have started the season on a high,” said Mutizwa. “But we don’t look at how they have played. We haven’t played them this season and everything is completely new. “We have a young, competitive team which is just gelling. We are ready for CAPS United. “I have a number of impressive youngsters who have done very well this season. “So I am not worried by the stature of CAPS United. I am confident my players will come to the party and win this match against Makepekepe.” Black Rhinos will not be having one of their key players Kudakwashe Nyakudanga, who faces a lengthy period on the sidelines after he suffered a nasty leg injury in their match against Bulawayo Chiefs last weekend. While Makepekepe and Bosso will be looking to overtake Dynamos, Ngezi Platinum and Herentals are looking to take off their season when they square off against each other at Baobab this afternoon. Ngezi Platinum have drawn in all the opening three games and Herentals have drawn twice and lost once. Both of them will be looking to pick their first set of three points in a match expected to be explosive. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva said his team is going all out for the three points. “We have started the season slowly. We need to start picking the maximum points,” said Mutiwekuziva. “We all know Ngezi Platinum are difficult to play against when they are at Baobab but we are going all out for a win to get our season underway. “The last time we played Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab, we beat them 2-1 although it was a different competition but that result should motivate us going into this match.” LONDON. — Liverpool have been charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players during Saturday’s 4-1 defeat at Manchester City. Several Liverpool players crowded around referee Simon Hooper as they pleaded for him to show City midfielder Rodri a second yellow card for a challenge on Cody Gakpo. THE wounds from the defeat to giants Highlanders in their last game are still fresh. LONDON. — Frank Lampard has returned to Chelsea as caretaker manager until the end of the season following the sacking of Graham Potter, the Premier League club confirmed on Thursday.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"herald_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CAPS DEFENCE HOLDING FIRM","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/caps-defence-holding-firm/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"THERE have been numerous changes in CAPS United camp this season but if there is a section which has promised a lot, then it is their defence.","content":"H-Metro Bruce Chikuni THERE have been numerous changes in CAPS United camp this season but if there is a section which has promised a lot, then it is their defence. Makepekepe will take on Black Rhinos in a Castle Lager Premiership fixture today at the National Sports Stadium. The Green Machine boss, Lloyd Chitembwe, started four of his newly-signed defenders on their 1-0 win over battling ZPC Kariba at the same venue. It worked out well with the quartet putting on a good show. These four players are Kelvin Madzongwe, Godknows Murirwa, Innocent Zambezi and Hastings Chapusha. Ben Musaka is the only player who was at the club last seen to have been deployed in the team’s defensive unit this season. Chitembwe’s men are yet to concede a goal. The 27-year-old Zambezi joined Makepekepe from the relegated Harare City. “These results are a good sign of the work that we are putting in at training. “Everyone is fighting to achieve the same goal, which is to win as many games as possible. “I think it’s good that we are not conceding and it also helps to work on other areas but everyone deserves credit,” said Zambezi. He added. “In football you can never really say you have settled because I feel like I’m still working on a lot of things. “The coach has shown trust in me and it means I should do extra work to remain consistent. “CAPS United is a big club and you’re expected to deliver your best in every fixture. “I wouldn’t want to end my career at this club but I want to use this team as a stepping stone, just like what other players who have come before me.” Last season’s Castle Lager Premiership Golden Boot Winner, William Manondo, is still yet to register a goal for Makepekepe. CAPS United are tied on seven points at the summit of the standings with Dynamos but they sit second due to goal difference.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"hmetro_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PSL should expedite pre-sale of tickets","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/psl-should-expedite-pre-sale-of-tickets/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ricky Zililo, Opinion IF last Sunday’s chaos at Barbourfields Stadium turnstiles where Highlanders Football Club played host to FC Platinum is anything to go by, then more commotion should be expected at every Bosso’s home match.

There was a lot of pushing and shoving at the gates as fans who came with less than 30 minutes to kick-off tried to squeeze their way into the stadium for the epic match. Bulawayo soccer giants Highlanders went on to win the encounter 2-1, breaking a nine-year winless jinx against the champions in a match watched by a paying crowd of 11 046. Some of the fans missed Highlanders’ two goals, scored by Stanley Ngala in the 27th minute and the 34th minute header by Peter Muduhwa as they were still by the gates. With Highlanders seemingly playing well and drawing lots of fans, it is highly likely that chaos at the gates will continue. Next weekend, Highlanders take on table toppers Dynamos in the country’s biggest match at Barbourfields Stadium, and this got me thinking that maybe it’s time that the Premier Soccer League expedited the process of electronic ticketing system. In February, the PSL invited tenders for the provision of an electronic ticketing system for the 2023 season. The PSL has been seized with the e-ticketing matter and with the league already underway, maybe they need to rush the process and go digital. Since 2014, the PSL has been trying to have the system in place and there was even a trial run in 2019 where tickets for some games were sold online. At that time, the PSL had a plan to gradually introduce the ticketing system. The next two years saw no football owing to Covid-19. The introduction of pre-sold tickets will grant fans access to tickets way before the match from selected outlets such as leading supermarkets and other relevant outlets. Pre-sale of tickets will improve passage of fans into stadiums to watch football as it would be easier to access the facility through designated entry points. Presently, with a lot of pushing and shoving when people jostle for tickets at entry points with others ending up losing valuables to thieves, the pre-sale will reduce congestion, save time and will improve transparency as it will give out the actual number of fans that would have paid to watch the match. There was an outcry from certain sections that the number of fans who watched the Highlanders-FC Platinum game was more than 11 000. As much as the PSL tries to plug loopholes at the gates, the only way to address this is through pre-sale of tickets. Clubs, through their governors can push for the PSL to speed up the e-ticketing process instead of crying foul that they are not responsible for what happens at the gates. Yes, according to Order 23 of the PSL rules and regulations, the league is obligated to ensure adequate officials manning the gates and ensuring that all admission fees are properly collected and accounted for, clubs can engage their fans and ask them to come early for the games. With football meant to be a family event, the shoving and delays at the gates discourages women and young children to attend high profile games. If not properly addressed, disaster might strike soon resulting in stampedes as agitated fans try to make their way into the stadium. The fans also have a responsibility to play in addressing congestion at the gates, maybe coming early could be key. There’s a tendency of people getting to the stadium late, having been killing time at braai centres or imbibing in their favourite drinks. Now that the league has given the green light for the sale of alcohol inside the stadium, maybe “rush hour” fans will start coming early. Stadium owners also need to play ball, invest in back up power to provide uninterrupted electricity supply to keep the network required to scan tickets. Also, the e-ticketing system will work well if there are bucket seats, meaning that a person buying a ticket will know before the game his or her seat number. However, lack of bucket seats shouldn’t stop the sale of pre-tickets as still the number of spectators can be limited by issuing the exact capacity tickets. Through the e-ticketing, it will also be easy to cordon off areas leading into the stadium, with only ticket holders allowed to pass the security check points. So, as the league games continue and fans’ interest shoots up, the PSL should strongly consider moving from the archaic stadium sale of tickets. – @ZililoR.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"HOW DID YADAH LOSE?","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/how-did-yadah-lose/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"Simba Bhora...................................................(1) 1","content":"H-Metro Bruce Chikuni Simba Bhora……………………………………………(1) 1 Yadah Stars………………………………………………..0 YADAH played all the football but still, somehow, came out empty handed in this Castle Lager Premiership match.

It is a match that promises to be a thriller as FC Platinum whose 23-league match unbeaten run came to a halt last Sunday when they lost 2-1 away to Highlanders, will be aiming at bouncing back to winning ways to keep up with the leading pack. The defeat to Highlanders left FC Platinum fifth on the log, a point behind leaders Dynamos. Bulawayo Chiefs are on position 13 with two points and as such are searching for their first win of the season. It will not be an easy encounter for Bulawayo Chiefs who lost the season’s opener — Castle Challenge Cup — 2-0 to FC Platinum last month. Bulawayo Chiefs coach Lizwe Sweswe declared his charges ready for the duel, adding that it will be a “coach versus coach” affair as he faces his former boss. Sweswe led FC Platinum to their third Castle Lager Premier Soccer League championship in 2019. “I know the challenge that lies ahead. We respect FC Platinum, they’re the champions, they’ve been together for years and with the team (Bulawayo Chiefs squad) that we have now, they’re ready for the game. “I’m not reading much about their defeat to Highlanders. We can’t count on that. Analysing the game you could tell the important moments when they have the ball, when they don’t have the ball, their entry into the box, they’re a complete team. However, we’ve to prepare and try to get a good result at Mandava. “I might have been there but what’s important is that the arsenal we have in my team understands football in terms of strategies and game plan. The match against FC Platinum is a great game, probably coach versus coach,” said Sweswe. Utility player William Stima is likely to partner captain Malvin Mkolo at central defence with Felix Moyo playing on the right side of the rearguard now that Nyahunzwi is out. Veteran midfielder Danny Phiri is expected to maintain the team’s shape and provide cover for the defence, giving Mthokozisi Msebe, Nkosi Ncube and Billy Veremu freedom to initiate moves from the centre of the park while Obriel Chirinda and either Farau Matare or Nixon Gama lead the attack. The platinum miner will bank on midfield duo of Juan Mutudza and Brian Banda to break as well as initiate moves from the midfield. Soccer Star of the Year Walter Musona, scorer of the consolation goal against Highlanders, striker Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya, skipper Gift Mbweti, new signings winger Jarrison Selemani and defender. Misheck Ngwenya, Panashe Mutimbanyoka as well as central defender Lawrence Mhlanga are some of the players expected to carry the day for FC Platinum. Meanwhile, Hwange will play host to Sheasham at Luveve Stadium tomorrow.

Alexander Mandinyenya scored the only goal of the match to end Ndiraya’s winless run. Ndiraya lost against reigning champions FC Platinum 2-1 in the season opener and went on to suffer a 1-0 defeat away to Chicken Inn before holding his former paymasters Dynamos to a 1-1 draw at the National Sports Stadium last week. But despite the win, at the end of the day, the former Warriors assistant coach was not a happy man following a poor display and an unimpressive type of play put up by his team. “Honestly I’m happy with the result but not too happy with the performance. We didn’t play football today and the attitude was not correct and I thought Yadah dominated the entire match,” Ndiraya told journalists. “However in those bad moments I’m happy about how we defended our lead. The play is totally different to our performance against Dynamos. “Maybe it was psychological to play a big team (Dynamos) and get to play a small then you get this performance, it’s not a good show. “We played seasoned contenders , a team with lots of movements and the mobility was just too hot for us to handle but I’m happy that we kept our shape at the end and defended our lead,” he added. Moreover, he expressed his happiness after his first win of the season. “It’s exciting to get the first win of the league, we had a difficult three weeks but I’m happy the win will take a bit of pressure from us and the win will give us confidence as we go into the next match.” His counterpart Expense Chitukutuku was disappointed with the result after his team performed better but couldn’t find the net. Striker Junior Zindoga was wasteful in front of goal. Chitukuku said: “Unfortunately we should have buried this game in the second half with Junior (Zindoga) but they defended very well.” Yadah play Cranborne Bullets in their next match while Simba Bhora face Hwange.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:14:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"nehandaradio","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"We want to keep our heads cool: Bosso defender","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/we-want-to-keep-our-heads-cool-bosso-defender/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS players have agreed to forget about last Sunday’s 2-1 win over FC Platinum as they focus on their next assignment against Chicken Inn this afternoon.

Bosso face their city rivals in what is expected to be an exciting encounter at Barbourfields Stadium. Highlanders have all the momentum going into the game as they are undefeated in three games with two wins and a draw. The Gamecocks on the other hand have won once and drawn twice. Ahead of the meeting between the two sides, Highlanders defender Andrew Mbeba has emphasised on the need to keep cool heads going into the derby. “I think for this Chicken Inn game, we go with the same character of wanting to win but keeping cool heads after the FC Platinum win. We are telling ourselves beating FC Platinum is not winning the league. This is just the start of the season and we have to keep cool heads to ensure we focus on the upcoming games,” said Mbeba. The defender, who is naturally a centre back, has been deployed in the right back position where he has done fairly well. “For me it’s all about maintaining the form that I am in and giving more while making sure that I don’t lose my place in the starting line-up,” said Mbeba. The defender had become a regular on the call-up list of the senior national team before the country was suspended from international football. He has four appearances for the Warriors. Mbeba, the 2019 Premier Soccer League Rookie of the Year, led the Young Warriors to the final of the Cosafa Championship that was held in Zambia in 2018. When he first stepped into the field, playing for the Bosso senior team, he was aged 18. – @innocentskizoe.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CAPS United, Bosso gun for control of PSL race","link":"https://www.herald.co.zw/caps-united-bosso-gun-for-control-of-psl-race/","keywords":["Football","Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League giants CAPS United and Highlanders have the chance to shoot to the top of the table, at least for 72 hours, depending on how they would have fared in their respective matches this afternoon.","content":"CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League giants CAPS United and Highlanders have the chance to shoot to the top of the table, at least for 72 hours, depending on how they would have fared in their respective matches this afternoon. Both the Green Machine and Bosso have seven points to their names, just like leaders Dynamos but they find themselves second and third respectively due to an inferior goal difference. But they have a chance to overtake the Glamour Boys if they win or draw in their respective games this afternoon as Dynamos will not be in action until Monday when they play Cranborne Bullets. Makepekepe and Bosso should however be at their best as they face tricky opponents. CAPS United face Black Rhinos in a Harare derby at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon while Bosso have a date with Chicken Inn in another derby in Bulawayo. With both giants enjoying their game, having won twice and drawn once in their opening three games, they will be looking to continue with their fine form this afternoon. But CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe knows it’s still early days to start talking about topping the log. “We were on top of the log after Match Day One fixtures and it was a good feeling. “But we are currently second and I have been in these trenches for long enough to know it’s still too early in the race,” said Chitembwe. “It is always good to be topping the table or be in that mix. “We are taking each game as it comes. “Black Rhinos are always tough opponents and we ought to take our A-Game with us to stand a good chance against them. “As CAPS United, we are happy with how we have started the season but there is a lot of work that we should also throw into the team. “While we are improving every day, we have to make sure we correct our flaws defensively and offensively. “Improvement is not an overnight process. We have to continue working on areas that we feel we haven’t been good enough. “As a team, we are happy with how we have fared so far in the season. “We are getting into those areas that we always want to be and the passing game is also improving. “We hope to continue on that trajectory. We know Black Rhinos are never easy opponents. They have a very good team and we should play well to stand a chance of collecting the maximum points which is always the aim.” Black Rhinos, on the other hand, know losing to Makepekepe will leave them in a desperate position. The army side had a promising start to the season after beating fellow military outfit Cranborne Bullets on the opening weekend. But a 1-0 defeat to Highlanders and a goalless draw at Bulawayo Chiefs last week left them three points off the pace. And coach Stanford “Stix” Mutizwa believes his team is good enough to collect the maximum against Makepekepe. “Obviously the aim is to win the game. We know what CAPS United is capable of doing. They are a big team and they have started the season on a high,” said Mutizwa. “But we don’t look at how they have played. We haven’t played them this season and everything is completely new. “We have a young, competitive team which is just gelling. We are ready for CAPS United. “I have a number of impressive youngsters who have done very well this season. “So I am not worried by the stature of CAPS United. I am confident my players will come to the party and win this match against Makepekepe.” Black Rhinos will not be having one of their key players Kudakwashe Nyakudanga, who faces a lengthy period on the sidelines after he suffered a nasty leg injury in their match against Bulawayo Chiefs last weekend. While Makepekepe and Bosso will be looking to overtake Dynamos, Ngezi Platinum and Herentals are looking to take off their season when they square off against each other at Baobab this afternoon. Ngezi Platinum have drawn in all the opening three games and Herentals have drawn twice and lost once. Both of them will be looking to pick their first set of three points in a match expected to be explosive. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva said his team is going all out for the three points. “We have started the season slowly. We need to start picking the maximum points,” said Mutiwekuziva. “We all know Ngezi Platinum are difficult to play against when they are at Baobab but we are going all out for a win to get our season underway. “The last time we played Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab, we beat them 2-1 although it was a different competition but that result should motivate us going into this match.” LONDON. — Liverpool have been charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players during Saturday’s 4-1 defeat at Manchester City. Several Liverpool players crowded around referee Simon Hooper as they pleaded for him to show City midfielder Rodri a second yellow card for a challenge on Cody Gakpo. THE wounds from the defeat to giants Highlanders in their last game are still fresh.

It worked out well with the quartet putting on a good show. These four players are Kelvin Madzongwe, Godknows Murirwa, Innocent Zambezi and Hastings Chapusha. Ben Musaka is the only player who was at the club last seen to have been deployed in the team’s defensive unit this season. Chitembwe’s men are yet to concede a goal. The 27-year-old Zambezi joined Makepekepe from the relegated Harare City. “These results are a good sign of the work that we are putting in at training. “Everyone is fighting to achieve the same goal, which is to win as many games as possible. “I think it’s good that we are not conceding and it also helps to work on other areas but everyone deserves credit,” said Zambezi. He added. “In football you can never really say you have settled because I feel like I’m still working on a lot of things. “The coach has shown trust in me and it means I should do extra work to remain consistent. “CAPS United is a big club and you’re expected to deliver your best in every fixture. “I wouldn’t want to end my career at this club but I want to use this team as a stepping stone, just like what other players who have come before me.” Last season’s Castle Lager Premiership Golden Boot Winner, William Manondo, is still yet to register a goal for Makepekepe.

There was a lot of pushing and shoving at the gates as fans who came with less than 30 minutes to kick-off tried to squeeze their way into the stadium for the epic match. Bulawayo soccer giants Highlanders went on to win the encounter 2-1, breaking a nine-year winless jinx against the champions in a match watched by a paying crowd of 11 046. Some of the fans missed Highlanders’ two goals, scored by Stanley Ngala in the 27th minute and the 34th minute header by Peter Muduhwa as they were still by the gates. With Highlanders seemingly playing well and drawing lots of fans, it is highly likely that chaos at the gates will continue. Next weekend, Highlanders take on table toppers Dynamos in the country’s biggest match at Barbourfields Stadium, and this got me thinking that maybe it’s time that the Premier Soccer League expedited the process of electronic ticketing system. In February, the PSL invited tenders for the provision of an electronic ticketing system for the 2023 season. The PSL has been seized with the e-ticketing matter and with the league already underway, maybe they need to rush the process and go digital. Since 2014, the PSL has been trying to have the system in place and there was even a trial run in 2019 where tickets for some games were sold online. At that time, the PSL had a plan to gradually introduce the ticketing system. The next two years saw no football owing to Covid-19. The introduction of pre-sold tickets will grant fans access to tickets way before the match from selected outlets such as leading supermarkets and other relevant outlets. Pre-sale of tickets will improve passage of fans into stadiums to watch football as it would be easier to access the facility through designated entry points. Presently, with a lot of pushing and shoving when people jostle for tickets at entry points with others ending up losing valuables to thieves, the pre-sale will reduce congestion, save time and will improve transparency as it will give out the actual number of fans that would have paid to watch the match. There was an outcry from certain sections that the number of fans who watched the Highlanders-FC Platinum game was more than 11 000. As much as the PSL tries to plug loopholes at the gates, the only way to address this is through pre-sale of tickets. Clubs, through their governors can push for the PSL to speed up the e-ticketing process instead of crying foul that they are not responsible for what happens at the gates. Yes, according to Order 23 of the PSL rules and regulations, the league is obligated to ensure adequate officials manning the gates and ensuring that all admission fees are properly collected and accounted for, clubs can engage their fans and ask them to come early for the games. With football meant to be a family event, the shoving and delays at the gates discourages women and young children to attend high profile games. If not properly addressed, disaster might strike soon resulting in stampedes as agitated fans try to make their way into the stadium. The fans also have a responsibility to play in addressing congestion at the gates, maybe coming early could be key. There’s a tendency of people getting to the stadium late, having been killing time at braai centres or imbibing in their favourite drinks. Now that the league has given the green light for the sale of alcohol inside the stadium, maybe “rush hour” fans will start coming early. Stadium owners also need to play ball, invest in back up power to provide uninterrupted electricity supply to keep the network required to scan tickets. Also, the e-ticketing system will work well if there are bucket seats, meaning that a person buying a ticket will know before the game his or her seat number. However, lack of bucket seats shouldn’t stop the sale of pre-tickets as still the number of spectators can be limited by issuing the exact capacity tickets. Through the e-ticketing, it will also be easy to cordon off areas leading into the stadium, with only ticket holders allowed to pass the security check points. So, as the league games continue and fans’ interest shoots up, the PSL should strongly consider moving from the archaic stadium sale of tickets. – @ZililoR.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"HOW DID YADAH LOSE?","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/how-did-yadah-lose/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"Simba Bhora...................................................(1) 1","content":"H-Metro Bruce Chikuni Simba Bhora……………………………………………(1) 1 Yadah Stars………………………………………………..0 YADAH played all the football but still, somehow, came out empty handed in this Castle Lager Premiership match.

It is a match that promises to be a thriller as FC Platinum whose 23-league match unbeaten run came to a halt last Sunday when they lost 2-1 away to Highlanders, will be aiming at bouncing back to winning ways to keep up with the leading pack. The defeat to Highlanders left FC Platinum fifth on the log, a point behind leaders Dynamos. Bulawayo Chiefs are on position 13 with two points and as such are searching for their first win of the season. It will not be an easy encounter for Bulawayo Chiefs who lost the season’s opener — Castle Challenge Cup — 2-0 to FC Platinum last month. Bulawayo Chiefs coach Lizwe Sweswe declared his charges ready for the duel, adding that it will be a “coach versus coach” affair as he faces his former boss. Sweswe led FC Platinum to their third Castle Lager Premier Soccer League championship in 2019. “I know the challenge that lies ahead. We respect FC Platinum, they’re the champions, they’ve been together for years and with the team (Bulawayo Chiefs squad) that we have now, they’re ready for the game. “I’m not reading much about their defeat to Highlanders. We can’t count on that. Analysing the game you could tell the important moments when they have the ball, when they don’t have the ball, their entry into the box, they’re a complete team. However, we’ve to prepare and try to get a good result at Mandava. “I might have been there but what’s important is that the arsenal we have in my team understands football in terms of strategies and game plan. The match against FC Platinum is a great game, probably coach versus coach,” said Sweswe. Utility player William Stima is likely to partner captain Malvin Mkolo at central defence with Felix Moyo playing on the right side of the rearguard now that Nyahunzwi is out. Veteran midfielder Danny Phiri is expected to maintain the team’s shape and provide cover for the defence, giving Mthokozisi Msebe, Nkosi Ncube and Billy Veremu freedom to initiate moves from the centre of the park while Obriel Chirinda and either Farau Matare or Nixon Gama lead the attack. The platinum miner will bank on midfield duo of Juan Mutudza and Brian Banda to break as well as initiate moves from the midfield. Soccer Star of the Year Walter Musona, scorer of the consolation goal against Highlanders, striker Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya, skipper Gift Mbweti, new signings winger Jarrison Selemani and defender. Misheck Ngwenya, Panashe Mutimbanyoka as well as central defender Lawrence Mhlanga are some of the players expected to carry the day for FC Platinum. Meanwhile, Hwange will play host to Sheasham at Luveve Stadium tomorrow.

Similarly, tennis players like Khawaja Iftikhar, Haroon Rahim, Haq brothers, Rashid Malik, Aqeel Khan and Aisam ul Haq have performed well in Davis Cup and other international events. However, since decades Pakistan tennis is roaming around two players i.e. Aisam ul Haq and Aqeel Khan, who are now in their 40s and lost their prime. Resultantly, Pakistan has suffered recently miserable defeats at the hands of Austria and Lithuania.Presently, we have talented potential, supporting parents, experienced coaches and much improved facilities, then why is this standstill. In my opinion it’s due to mishandling of game by some PTF officials who instead of promoting game are promoting nepotism and joyriding, thus destroying game. Due to their negative policies, they have wasted highly talented Abid Ali Akbar, Samir Iftikhar, Muzamal Murtaza and so many others. Now they are all out to waste women talent as well. Recently, the PTF conducted trials for Billie Jean cup and Asian Games to be held in June and September respectively giving exemption to two over 30 players Ushna Suhail and Sara Mahboob. Ushna is daughter of PTF SVP Kh Suhail Iftikhar, married and settled in UK. She has not played any tournament since long, who knows if she is practicing tennis or not. Instead, they have decided not to give a chance to the 21-year-old highly talented Mahin, who is attending tennis academy in Barcelona and had beaten Ushna and Sarah Mehboob on numerous occasions in the past. The trials were also fixed to intrude few other favorites. Why was PTF in a hurry to select such a weak women’s team, that too six months in advance for Asian Games and not bothering to hold trials for the men’s team? The Pakistan Football Federation announced women team on 1st April for 5th April Olympic qualifying match, PCB announced Pakistan team on 4th April for 14th April New Zealand match, then why PTF announced women team six months in advance just to induct favorites. President PTF Mr. Salim Saifullah Khan, who has worked day and night for the betterment of Pakistan tennis, is requested to seriously look into high handedness of evils sheltering in the PTF, who are not only spoiling tennis, wasting his own good work done for tennis promotion and also hell-bent on wasting our young national talent.

Moreover, he expressed his happiness after his first win of the season. “It’s exciting to get the first win of the league, we had a difficult three weeks but I’m happy the win will take a bit of pressure from us and the win will give us confidence as we go into the next match.” His counterpart Expense Chitukutuku was disappointed with the result after his team performed better but couldn’t find the net. Striker Junior Zindoga was wasteful in front of goal. Chitukuku said: “Unfortunately we should have buried this game in the second half with Junior (Zindoga) but they defended very well.” Yadah play Cranborne Bullets in their next match while Simba Bhora face Hwange.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:14:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"nehandaradio","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"We want to keep our heads cool: Bosso defender","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/we-want-to-keep-our-heads-cool-bosso-defender/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS players have agreed to forget about last Sunday’s 2-1 win over FC Platinum as they focus on their next assignment against Chicken Inn this afternoon.

Bosso face their city rivals in what is expected to be an exciting encounter at Barbourfields Stadium. Highlanders have all the momentum going into the game as they are undefeated in three games with two wins and a draw. The Gamecocks on the other hand have won once and drawn twice. Ahead of the meeting between the two sides, Highlanders defender Andrew Mbeba has emphasised on the need to keep cool heads going into the derby. “I think for this Chicken Inn game, we go with the same character of wanting to win but keeping cool heads after the FC Platinum win. We are telling ourselves beating FC Platinum is not winning the league. This is just the start of the season and we have to keep cool heads to ensure we focus on the upcoming games,” said Mbeba. The defender, who is naturally a centre back, has been deployed in the right back position where he has done fairly well. “For me it’s all about maintaining the form that I am in and giving more while making sure that I don’t lose my place in the starting line-up,” said Mbeba. The defender had become a regular on the call-up list of the senior national team before the country was suspended from international football. He has four appearances for the Warriors. Mbeba, the 2019 Premier Soccer League Rookie of the Year, led the Young Warriors to the final of the Cosafa Championship that was held in Zambia in 2018. When he first stepped into the field, playing for the Bosso senior team, he was aged 18. – @innocentskizoe.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CAPS United, Bosso gun for control of PSL race","link":"https://www.herald.co.zw/caps-united-bosso-gun-for-control-of-psl-race/","keywords":["Football","Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League giants CAPS United and Highlanders have the chance to shoot to the top of the table, at least for 72 hours, depending on how they would have fared in their respective matches this afternoon.","content":"CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League giants CAPS United and Highlanders have the chance to shoot to the top of the table, at least for 72 hours, depending on how they would have fared in their respective matches this afternoon. Both the Green Machine and Bosso have seven points to their names, just like leaders Dynamos but they find themselves second and third respectively due to an inferior goal difference. But they have a chance to overtake the Glamour Boys if they win or draw in their respective games this afternoon as Dynamos will not be in action until Monday when they play Cranborne Bullets. Makepekepe and Bosso should however be at their best as they face tricky opponents. CAPS United face Black Rhinos in a Harare derby at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon while Bosso have a date with Chicken Inn in another derby in Bulawayo. With both giants enjoying their game, having won twice and drawn once in their opening three games, they will be looking to continue with their fine form this afternoon. But CAPS United coach Lloyd Chitembwe knows it’s still early days to start talking about topping the log. “We were on top of the log after Match Day One fixtures and it was a good feeling. “But we are currently second and I have been in these trenches for long enough to know it’s still too early in the race,” said Chitembwe. “It is always good to be topping the table or be in that mix. “We are taking each game as it comes. “Black Rhinos are always tough opponents and we ought to take our A-Game with us to stand a good chance against them. “As CAPS United, we are happy with how we have started the season but there is a lot of work that we should also throw into the team. “While we are improving every day, we have to make sure we correct our flaws defensively and offensively. “Improvement is not an overnight process. We have to continue working on areas that we feel we haven’t been good enough. “As a team, we are happy with how we have fared so far in the season. “We are getting into those areas that we always want to be and the passing game is also improving. “We hope to continue on that trajectory. We know Black Rhinos are never easy opponents. They have a very good team and we should play well to stand a chance of collecting the maximum points which is always the aim.” Black Rhinos, on the other hand, know losing to Makepekepe will leave them in a desperate position. The army side had a promising start to the season after beating fellow military outfit Cranborne Bullets on the opening weekend. But a 1-0 defeat to Highlanders and a goalless draw at Bulawayo Chiefs last week left them three points off the pace. And coach Stanford “Stix” Mutizwa believes his team is good enough to collect the maximum against Makepekepe. “Obviously the aim is to win the game. We know what CAPS United is capable of doing. They are a big team and they have started the season on a high,” said Mutizwa. “But we don’t look at how they have played. We haven’t played them this season and everything is completely new. “We have a young, competitive team which is just gelling. We are ready for CAPS United. “I have a number of impressive youngsters who have done very well this season. “So I am not worried by the stature of CAPS United. I am confident my players will come to the party and win this match against Makepekepe.” Black Rhinos will not be having one of their key players Kudakwashe Nyakudanga, who faces a lengthy period on the sidelines after he suffered a nasty leg injury in their match against Bulawayo Chiefs last weekend. While Makepekepe and Bosso will be looking to overtake Dynamos, Ngezi Platinum and Herentals are looking to take off their season when they square off against each other at Baobab this afternoon. Ngezi Platinum have drawn in all the opening three games and Herentals have drawn twice and lost once. Both of them will be looking to pick their first set of three points in a match expected to be explosive. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva said his team is going all out for the three points. “We have started the season slowly. We need to start picking the maximum points,” said Mutiwekuziva. “We all know Ngezi Platinum are difficult to play against when they are at Baobab but we are going all out for a win to get our season underway. “The last time we played Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab, we beat them 2-1 although it was a different competition but that result should motivate us going into this match.” LONDON. — Liverpool have been charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players during Saturday’s 4-1 defeat at Manchester City. Several Liverpool players crowded around referee Simon Hooper as they pleaded for him to show City midfielder Rodri a second yellow card for a challenge on Cody Gakpo. THE wounds from the defeat to giants Highlanders in their last game are still fresh.

Makepekepe will take on Black Rhinos in a Castle Lager Premiership fixture today at the National Sports Stadium. The Green Machine boss, Lloyd Chitembwe, started four of his newly-signed defenders on their 1-0 win over battling ZPC Kariba at the same venue. It worked out well with the quartet putting on a good show. These four players are Kelvin Madzongwe, Godknows Murirwa, Innocent Zambezi and Hastings Chapusha. Ben Musaka is the only player who was at the club last seen to have been deployed in the team’s defensive unit this season. Chitembwe’s men are yet to concede a goal. The 27-year-old Zambezi joined Makepekepe from the relegated Harare City. “These results are a good sign of the work that we are putting in at training. “Everyone is fighting to achieve the same goal, which is to win as many games as possible. “I think it’s good that we are not conceding and it also helps to work on other areas but everyone deserves credit,” said Zambezi. He added. “In football you can never really say you have settled because I feel like I’m still working on a lot of things. “The coach has shown trust in me and it means I should do extra work to remain consistent. “CAPS United is a big club and you’re expected to deliver your best in every fixture. “I wouldn’t want to end my career at this club but I want to use this team as a stepping stone, just like what other players who have come before me.” Last season’s Castle Lager Premiership Golden Boot Winner, William Manondo, is still yet to register a goal for Makepekepe. CAPS United are tied on seven points at the summit of the standings with Dynamos but they sit second due to goal difference.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"hmetro_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PSL should expedite pre-sale of tickets","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/psl-should-expedite-pre-sale-of-tickets/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ricky Zililo, Opinion IF last Sunday’s chaos at Barbourfields Stadium turnstiles where Highlanders Football Club played host to FC Platinum is anything to go by, then more commotion should be expected at every Bosso’s home match.

There was a lot of pushing and shoving at the gates as fans who came with less than 30 minutes to kick-off tried to squeeze their way into the stadium for the epic match. Bulawayo soccer giants Highlanders went on to win the encounter 2-1, breaking a nine-year winless jinx against the champions in a match watched by a paying crowd of 11 046. Some of the fans missed Highlanders’ two goals, scored by Stanley Ngala in the 27th minute and the 34th minute header by Peter Muduhwa as they were still by the gates. With Highlanders seemingly playing well and drawing lots of fans, it is highly likely that chaos at the gates will continue. Next weekend, Highlanders take on table toppers Dynamos in the country’s biggest match at Barbourfields Stadium, and this got me thinking that maybe it’s time that the Premier Soccer League expedited the process of electronic ticketing system. In February, the PSL invited tenders for the provision of an electronic ticketing system for the 2023 season. The PSL has been seized with the e-ticketing matter and with the league already underway, maybe they need to rush the process and go digital. Since 2014, the PSL has been trying to have the system in place and there was even a trial run in 2019 where tickets for some games were sold online. At that time, the PSL had a plan to gradually introduce the ticketing system. The next two years saw no football owing to Covid-19. The introduction of pre-sold tickets will grant fans access to tickets way before the match from selected outlets such as leading supermarkets and other relevant outlets. Pre-sale of tickets will improve passage of fans into stadiums to watch football as it would be easier to access the facility through designated entry points. Presently, with a lot of pushing and shoving when people jostle for tickets at entry points with others ending up losing valuables to thieves, the pre-sale will reduce congestion, save time and will improve transparency as it will give out the actual number of fans that would have paid to watch the match. There was an outcry from certain sections that the number of fans who watched the Highlanders-FC Platinum game was more than 11 000. As much as the PSL tries to plug loopholes at the gates, the only way to address this is through pre-sale of tickets. Clubs, through their governors can push for the PSL to speed up the e-ticketing process instead of crying foul that they are not responsible for what happens at the gates. Yes, according to Order 23 of the PSL rules and regulations, the league is obligated to ensure adequate officials manning the gates and ensuring that all admission fees are properly collected and accounted for, clubs can engage their fans and ask them to come early for the games. With football meant to be a family event, the shoving and delays at the gates discourages women and young children to attend high profile games. If not properly addressed, disaster might strike soon resulting in stampedes as agitated fans try to make their way into the stadium. The fans also have a responsibility to play in addressing congestion at the gates, maybe coming early could be key. There’s a tendency of people getting to the stadium late, having been killing time at braai centres or imbibing in their favourite drinks. Now that the league has given the green light for the sale of alcohol inside the stadium, maybe “rush hour” fans will start coming early. Stadium owners also need to play ball, invest in back up power to provide uninterrupted electricity supply to keep the network required to scan tickets. Also, the e-ticketing system will work well if there are bucket seats, meaning that a person buying a ticket will know before the game his or her seat number. However, lack of bucket seats shouldn’t stop the sale of pre-tickets as still the number of spectators can be limited by issuing the exact capacity tickets. Through the e-ticketing, it will also be easy to cordon off areas leading into the stadium, with only ticket holders allowed to pass the security check points. So, as the league games continue and fans’ interest shoots up, the PSL should strongly consider moving from the archaic stadium sale of tickets. – @ZililoR.","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:05:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"HOW DID YADAH LOSE?","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/how-did-yadah-lose/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"Simba Bhora...................................................(1) 1","content":"H-Metro Bruce Chikuni Simba Bhora……………………………………………(1) 1 Yadah Stars………………………………………………..0 YADAH played all the football but still, somehow, came out empty handed in this Castle Lager Premiership match.

It is a match that promises to be a thriller as FC Platinum whose 23-league match unbeaten run came to a halt last Sunday when they lost 2-1 away to Highlanders, will be aiming at bouncing back to winning ways to keep up with the leading pack. The defeat to Highlanders left FC Platinum fifth on the log, a point behind leaders Dynamos. Bulawayo Chiefs are on position 13 with two points and as such are searching for their first win of the season. It will not be an easy encounter for Bulawayo Chiefs who lost the season’s opener — Castle Challenge Cup — 2-0 to FC Platinum last month. Bulawayo Chiefs coach Lizwe Sweswe declared his charges ready for the duel, adding that it will be a “coach versus coach” affair as he faces his former boss. Sweswe led FC Platinum to their third Castle Lager Premier Soccer League championship in 2019. “I know the challenge that lies ahead. We respect FC Platinum, they’re the champions, they’ve been together for years and with the team (Bulawayo Chiefs squad) that we have now, they’re ready for the game. “I’m not reading much about their defeat to Highlanders. We can’t count on that. Analysing the game you could tell the important moments when they have the ball, when they don’t have the ball, their entry into the box, they’re a complete team. However, we’ve to prepare and try to get a good result at Mandava. “I might have been there but what’s important is that the arsenal we have in my team understands football in terms of strategies and game plan. The match against FC Platinum is a great game, probably coach versus coach,” said Sweswe. Utility player William Stima is likely to partner captain Malvin Mkolo at central defence with Felix Moyo playing on the right side of the rearguard now that Nyahunzwi is out. Veteran midfielder Danny Phiri is expected to maintain the team’s shape and provide cover for the defence, giving Mthokozisi Msebe, Nkosi Ncube and Billy Veremu freedom to initiate moves from the centre of the park while Obriel Chirinda and either Farau Matare or Nixon Gama lead the attack. The platinum miner will bank on midfield duo of Juan Mutudza and Brian Banda to break as well as initiate moves from the midfield. Soccer Star of the Year Walter Musona, scorer of the consolation goal against Highlanders, striker Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya, skipper Gift Mbweti, new signings winger Jarrison Selemani and defender. Misheck Ngwenya, Panashe Mutimbanyoka as well as central defender Lawrence Mhlanga are some of the players expected to carry the day for FC Platinum. Meanwhile, Hwange will play host to Sheasham at Luveve Stadium tomorrow. Chipangano have recovered from the opening day loss to Dynamos to record wins against Yadah and Green Fuel. – @ZililoR","pubDate":"2023-04-06 22:03:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"chronicle_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"}]}
