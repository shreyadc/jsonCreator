However, the IU alum is rooting for his squad to finish out on top.“We got to tighten up Hoosiers, man,” Coleman said about his school that sits in 9th place so far. “We got to win this blood drive and get that million (dollars).”Whether it is in the donation booths or on the field, Indiana (9-0) is having a steller season, one Coleman would say is “unheard of.”“Coach Cig (Curt Cignetti) is changing that whole university around, charnging that whole program around, man, and it’s exciting to see.”Cignetti, whom IU hired from James Madison last November, has become the only head coach in school history to win his first nine games. The Hoosiers have a challenging upcoming schedule, facing opponents Michigan (5-4) and Ohio State (7-1).“I think they definitely gonna beat Michigan for sure... but the real tough game is definitely gonna be Ohio State, because Ohio State every year, man, their players, they got some amazing players, some amazing skillset players that’s hard to bring down and hard to scout,” Coleman said.
