The Eagles and Cowboys play at least twice a season as division rivals.However, as pointed out by NBC Sports Philadelphia’s Dave Zangaro: “This is the first time the Eagles and Cowboys have faced off in Week 1 since the 2000 season in North Texas. You probably remember that game. Using pickle juice for fuel, Andy Reid’s Eagles used a surprise onside kick to help them get an early lead in what ended up being a 41-14 win to jumpstart a new era of Eagles football.”This game will give the Cowboys the chance to see a banner raised. The Eagles have won two Super Bowls in the past decade, while the Cowboys have gone nearly 30 years without a Lombardi Trophy win.This story uses functionality that may not work in our app. Click here to open the story in your web browser.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-05-12 06:42:51","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/05/250512-hurts-parsons-getty.jpg?fit=1906%2C1073&quality=85&strip=all","video_url":null,"source_id":"nbcbayarea","source_name":"Nbc Bay Area","source_priority":13912,"source_url":"https://www.nbcbayarea.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/nbcbayarea.png","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"e1c5602d4aef3305aae699c876896852","title":"Evangelos Marinakis ‘proud’ of Forest manager Nuno despite pitch confrontation","link":"https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/evangelos-marinakis-proud-of-forest-manager-nuno-despite-pitch-confrontation-1761902.html","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["BreakingNews.ie"],"description":"Marinakis was seen emotionally remonstrating with Nuno on the pitch at the end of the 2-2 draw with Leicester.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-05-12 06:42:29","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjVcXFwvMDVcXFwvMTIwNzQwNDVcXFwvMi44MDA3NjM1NC1lMTc0NzAzMjEwMzQ2NC5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTAyNCxcImhlaWdodFwiOm51bGwsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI2NDFjNDkwYmI3YmM0NjY3MWViZjJjMWNkYmQxZGM0NGE0NGE3NjkzIn0=/2-80076354-e1747032103464.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"breakingnews_ie","source_name":"Breakingnews","source_priority":109727,"source_url":"https://www.breakingnews.ie","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/breakingnews_ie.png","language":"english","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"0860f7cb747b8813db2751a2a2e44d11","title":"Monday's papers focus on Amorim's threat to walk away","link":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2kq0z503yeo?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["BBC"],"description":"The league table does not lie and with just two Premier League games left to play this season, Manchester United are 16th, having endured a record-breaking season for all the wrong reasons.

Eagles. Sept. 4. @NBC and @peacock. pic.twitter.com/LXjpEAfDHm— Sunday Night Football on NBC (@SNFonNBC) May 12, 2025 The game will be broadcast on NBC as the start of the network’s Sunday Night Football slate.This storied rivalry has gone the Cowboys’ way over the years as they lead the Birds 74-58 overall. The Eagles and Cowboys play at least twice a season as division rivals.However, as pointed out by NBC Sports Philadelphia’s Dave Zangaro: “This is the first time the Eagles and Cowboys have faced off in Week 1 since the 2000 season in North Texas. You probably remember that game. Using pickle juice for fuel, Andy Reid’s Eagles used a surprise onside kick to help them get an early lead in what ended up being a 41-14 win to jumpstart a new era of Eagles football.”This game will give the Cowboys the chance to see a banner raised. The Eagles have won two Super Bowls in the past decade, while the Cowboys have gone nearly 30 years without a Lombardi Trophy win.This story uses functionality that may not work in our app. Click here to open the story in your web browser.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-05-12 06:42:51","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/05/250512-hurts-parsons-getty.jpg?fit=1906%2C1073&quality=85&strip=all","video_url":null,"source_id":"nbcbayarea","source_name":"Nbc Bay Area","source_priority":13912,"source_url":"https://www.nbcbayarea.com","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/nbcbayarea.png","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"e1c5602d4aef3305aae699c876896852","title":"Evangelos Marinakis ‘proud’ of Forest manager Nuno despite pitch confrontation","link":"https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/evangelos-marinakis-proud-of-forest-manager-nuno-despite-pitch-confrontation-1761902.html","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["BreakingNews.ie"],"description":"Marinakis was seen emotionally remonstrating with Nuno on the pitch at the end of the 2-2 draw with Leicester.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-05-12 06:42:29","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjVcXFwvMDVcXFwvMTIwNzQwNDVcXFwvMi44MDA3NjM1NC1lMTc0NzAzMjEwMzQ2NC5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTAyNCxcImhlaWdodFwiOm51bGwsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI2NDFjNDkwYmI3YmM0NjY3MWViZjJjMWNkYmQxZGM0NGE0NGE3NjkzIn0=/2-80076354-e1747032103464.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"breakingnews_ie","source_name":"Breakingnews","source_priority":109727,"source_url":"https://www.breakingnews.ie","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/breakingnews_ie.png","language":"english","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"0860f7cb747b8813db2751a2a2e44d11","title":"Monday's papers focus on Amorim's threat to walk away","link":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2kq0z503yeo?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["BBC"],"description":"The league table does not lie and with just two Premier League games left to play this season, Manchester United are 16th, having endured a record-breaking season for all the wrong reasons.
