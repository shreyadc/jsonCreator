La ceremonia, que será el próximo lunes 30 de octubre en el Théâtre du Châtelet de París, aún no tiene confirmado el horario oficial, pero se especula que iniciará a las 15 hora argentina. La gala promete ser un evento especial para Lionel Messi , quien persigue su octavo Balón de Oro. En esta 67ª edición, el astro argentino asistirá a la ceremonia con un impresionante récord, ya que es el ganador más condecorado de este galardón individual, habiendo obtenido siete en su carrera, en los años 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019 y 2021. Messi competirá con otros 29 destacados futbolistas de todo el mundo , entre los que se encuentran tres integrantes de la selección argentina, que lograron la hazaña de ganar la Copa del Mundo: Emiliano \"Dibu\" Martínez, Lautaro Martínez y Julián Álvarez. A pesar de la fuerte competencia de jugadores de élite como Erling Haaland o Kevin de Bruyne , Messi llega como favorito, tras cosechar reconocimientos continentales en 2022, lo que podría darle ventaja para alzarse con un octavo Balón de Oro. Los criterios de adjudicación cambiaron para esta última edición. Ahora, las “actuaciones individuales” y el “carácter decisivo e impactante de los contendientes” ocuparán el primer lugar en importancia, superando al “aspecto colectivo y los trofeos ganados” y a la “clase del jugador y su sentido del juego limpio”. Además, el jurado se redujo de 170 votantes a 100 votantes , con periodistas de las 100 naciones líderes en la clasificación de la FIFA proporcionando sus tres mejores jugadores de la temporada. Los fanáticos del fútbol de todo el mundo esperan ansiosos esta emocionante gala que determinará al próximo galardonado con este prestigioso premio individual. El Balón de Oro, que en el año 2022 recayó en manos de Karim Benzema , podrá ser seguido el lunes 30 de octubre, en vivo y en directo, a través de ESPN y STAR Plus.","pubDate":"2023-10-25 00:01:45","image_url":"https://images.pagina12.com.ar/styles/width960/public/2023-10/782249-messi-20con-20el-20balon.jpg?itok=te3UbKgp","source_id":"pagina12","source_priority":56124,"country":["argentina"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"article_id":"7e3afeb5a1cd57fb60ace47c3d72308f","title":"Exploring Traditional Nigerian Football Rituals: A Cultural Perspective","link":"https://www.ghanamma.com/2023/10/24/exploring-traditional-nigerian-football-rituals-a-cultural-perspective/","keywords":["Juice","Sports"],"creator":["Ghana News"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dive into the vibrant tapestry of Nigerian football culture with a focus on pre-match rituals, chants, and traditional celebrations.

The hosts turned in another performance of the highest quality, picking up a comfortable 3-0 win over Heerenveen in the Eredivisie on Saturday. Pascal Jansen’s side have won their last four games across competitions, scoring 10 goals and keeping three clean sheets. AZ now turn their attention to the Conference League. They kicked off their campaign with a 4-3 loss against Zrinjski Mostar on September 21 before a hard-fought 1-0 win over Legia Warsaw. After two games, the Dutch outfit are second in Group E, level on three points with the three other sides in the group. Meanwhile, Aston Villa continued their fine run of results in the Premier League, as they stormed to a 4-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday. Unai Emery’s side have gone four games without defeat, winning three, including a 1-0 win over Zrinjski in the Conference League on October 5. However, Aston Villa have struggled on the road recently, losing twice and winning once in four games since September. Fresh off a superb team performance against West Ham, Aston Villa will journey to the AFAS Stadion with sky-high confidence as they look to rise from the bottom of the table. However, AZ have been near impenetrable at home this season and should hold out for a share of the spoils in a high-scoring draw. Prediction : Alkmaar 2-2 Aston Villa Tip 1: Draw Tip 2: Over 2.5 goals - Yes (There have been at least three goals scored in five of AZ’s last seven games.)

The Gunners will lock horns with the 2022-23 UEFA Europa League winners at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan later today (October 24). They will be aiming to bounce back in the UCL after suffering a shock 2-1 away loss against Lens in their last fixture. David Raya starts in goal for Arsenal. Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, and Takehiro Tomiyasu make up the defense. The midfield consists of Jorginho, Declan Rice, and Martin Odegaard. Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, and Gabriel Jesus start in attack to complete Mikel Arteta's starting XI. Thomas Partey misses the clash against Sevilla due to a muscle injury. The 30-year-old midfielder has only made five appearances across all competitions after picking up a serious groin injury in August that kept him sidelined for six games. Many Arsenal fans have lost patience with the midfielder though and want him sold in the upcoming transfer window. One fan posted on X (formerly Twitter): Another fan posted: Here are some more reactions from fans on X: Mikel Arteta and Co. are currently second in Group B of the Champions League with three points from two games, one point behind Lens. Arsenal icon Ian Wright believes Oleksandr Zinchenko has struggled for form this season due to Granit Xhaka's exit from the Emirates during the summer transfer window. Xhaka played an integral role in Arsenal challenging Manchester City for the Premier League title last season, scoring nine goals and providing seven assists in 47 appearances across all competitions. But he made the surprising decision to leave the club to join Bayer Leverkusen over the summer. Zinchenko lost the great connection he had with Xhaka down the left flank, which Wright has noticed this season. He said (via Football London ): Zinchenko has made 11 appearances in total this season but is yet to register a goal contribution.

The Exiles’ miserable run of form continued at Meadow Lane where the Magpies showed their promotion credentials in a one-sided encounter. Notts County hit the front through Dan Crowley and then Macauley Langstaff scored goals either side of half-time. Newport County sit 19th in the table, five points above the relegation zone, after only Colchester won of the division’s strugglers. However, the Exiles have taken just six points from 10 games since an encouraging August and they continue to leak goals. 📈 How’s that table looking? | “They have quality players and they are up that end of the table for a reason, we are down our end for a reason,” said Coughlan. “It’s our inability to stay in games or keep clean sheets is hurting us and we need to correct it. “I could bemoan our injuries and not being able to get a settled back four but it doesn’t matter who goes into the team because it’s just basics. “It’s frightening when you see professional footballers and they are not able to do the basics. \"It’s really annoying as a former centre-half. If the players continue to make mistakes then we will continue to lose games.” The Magpies’ first came after Bryn Morris was dispossessed in midfield, the second came when Langstaff was unmarked in the middle of the goal and the third when he got the run on Ryan Delaney to slot from close range. “You cannot have two centre-halves outside the front post and the lad Longstaff in the middle of the goal – he’s got a big number 9 on his back, so that would tell you something,” said Coughlan, referring to the goal that made it 2-0. “They played with one striker up there and we had two centre-halves who couldn’t look after him. “It’s annoying when you can’t get the basics of the game right and I suppose that maybe they are lacking a little bit of confidence and self-belief, but this can’t continue.” County suffered another dose of injury misfortune when 19-year-old Josh Seberry was stretchered off shortly after the opening goal. The Irish novice received lengthy treatment, had his right lower leg put in a protective boot and was given gas before being taken to hospital. “It’s a bad one. He is currently in the hospital and we will have to see what the medics want to do,” said Coughlan immediately after the game. “We are still awaiting news of the exact injury but we feel for him, he’s such a young kid and it was a bad one. “We have to get around him and await the decisions. Injuries are part and parcel of football but you never like to see players stretchered off with gas and air, as soon as that comes out you know it is serious.” County are also without defenders James Clarke (groin), Kyle Jameson (hip) and Adam Lewis (quad), midfielder Harry Charsley (ankle) and forwards Offrande Zanzala (knee) and Seb Palmer-Houlden (hamstring). They travel to Gillingham on Saturday with their hosts sitting seventh after a 1-0 win at Swindon.","pubDate":"2023-10-24 23:19:29","image_url":"https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/17367977/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesargus","source_priority":284631,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4e1865592896a7e1f3aa14309cfeb413","title":"Erik ten Hag heaps praise on United goalkeeper Andre Onana after penalty heroics","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23877476.erik-ten-hag-heaps-praise-united-goalkeeper-andre-onana-penalty-heroics/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Onana saved Jordan Larsson’s stoppage-time penalty to earn his side a 1-0 win against Copenhagen.","content":"Having kicked off Group A with defeats to Bayern Munich and Galatasaray, the Red Devils could ill-afford any slip-up against the Danish champions in Tuesday’s Old Trafford encounter.

And Ten Hag joined the TNT Sports crew after the crucial win. At the end of the interview, he shook the hands of ex-Man Utd stars Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes . But in doing so, presenter Woods was ignored by the Dutchman. It led to an awkward moment as Woods comically held out her hand while Ten Hag faced Ferdinand and Scholes. He then made up for it by shaking Woods' hand before he walked off. But Woods then said she was 'double embarrassed' after the Man United gaffer stole her microphone to interview HIMSELF during the post-match analysis.

La gala promete ser un evento especial para Lionel Messi , quien persigue su octavo Balón de Oro. En esta 67ª edición, el astro argentino asistirá a la ceremonia con un impresionante récord, ya que es el ganador más condecorado de este galardón individual, habiendo obtenido siete en su carrera, en los años 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019 y 2021.

Los criterios de adjudicación cambiaron para esta última edición. Ahora, las “actuaciones individuales” y el “carácter decisivo e impactante de los contendientes” ocuparán el primer lugar en importancia, superando al “aspecto colectivo y los trofeos ganados” y a la “clase del jugador y su sentido del juego limpio”.

The hosts turned in another performance of the highest quality, picking up a comfortable 3-0 win over Heerenveen in the Eredivisie on Saturday. Pascal Jansen’s side have won their last four games across competitions, scoring 10 goals and keeping three clean sheets. AZ now turn their attention to the Conference League. They kicked off their campaign with a 4-3 loss against Zrinjski Mostar on September 21 before a hard-fought 1-0 win over Legia Warsaw. After two games, the Dutch outfit are second in Group E, level on three points with the three other sides in the group. Meanwhile, Aston Villa continued their fine run of results in the Premier League, as they stormed to a 4-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday. Unai Emery’s side have gone four games without defeat, winning three, including a 1-0 win over Zrinjski in the Conference League on October 5. However, Aston Villa have struggled on the road recently, losing twice and winning once in four games since September. Fresh off a superb team performance against West Ham, Aston Villa will journey to the AFAS Stadion with sky-high confidence as they look to rise from the bottom of the table. However, AZ have been near impenetrable at home this season and should hold out for a share of the spoils in a high-scoring draw.

The Gunners will lock horns with the 2022-23 UEFA Europa League winners at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan later today (October 24). They will be aiming to bounce back in the UCL after suffering a shock 2-1 away loss against Lens in their last fixture. David Raya starts in goal for Arsenal. Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, and Takehiro Tomiyasu make up the defense. The midfield consists of Jorginho, Declan Rice, and Martin Odegaard. Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, and Gabriel Jesus start in attack to complete Mikel Arteta's starting XI. Thomas Partey misses the clash against Sevilla due to a muscle injury. The 30-year-old midfielder has only made five appearances across all competitions after picking up a serious groin injury in August that kept him sidelined for six games. Many Arsenal fans have lost patience with the midfielder though and want him sold in the upcoming transfer window. One fan posted on X (formerly Twitter): Another fan posted: Here are some more reactions from fans on X: Mikel Arteta and Co. are currently second in Group B of the Champions League with three points from two games, one point behind Lens. Arsenal icon Ian Wright believes Oleksandr Zinchenko has struggled for form this season due to Granit Xhaka's exit from the Emirates during the summer transfer window. Xhaka played an integral role in Arsenal challenging Manchester City for the Premier League title last season, scoring nine goals and providing seven assists in 47 appearances across all competitions. But he made the surprising decision to leave the club to join Bayer Leverkusen over the summer. Zinchenko lost the great connection he had with Xhaka down the left flank, which Wright has noticed this season. He said (via Football London ): Zinchenko has made 11 appearances in total this season but is yet to register a goal contribution.

The Exiles’ miserable run of form continued at Meadow Lane where the Magpies showed their promotion credentials in a one-sided encounter. Notts County hit the front through Dan Crowley and then Macauley Langstaff scored goals either side of half-time. Newport County sit 19th in the table, five points above the relegation zone, after only Colchester won of the division’s strugglers. However, the Exiles have taken just six points from 10 games since an encouraging August and they continue to leak goals. 📈 How’s that table looking? | “They have quality players and they are up that end of the table for a reason, we are down our end for a reason,” said Coughlan. “It’s our inability to stay in games or keep clean sheets is hurting us and we need to correct it. “I could bemoan our injuries and not being able to get a settled back four but it doesn’t matter who goes into the team because it’s just basics. “It’s frightening when you see professional footballers and they are not able to do the basics. \"It’s really annoying as a former centre-half. If the players continue to make mistakes then we will continue to lose games.” The Magpies’ first came after Bryn Morris was dispossessed in midfield, the second came when Langstaff was unmarked in the middle of the goal and the third when he got the run on Ryan Delaney to slot from close range. “You cannot have two centre-halves outside the front post and the lad Longstaff in the middle of the goal – he’s got a big number 9 on his back, so that would tell you something,” said Coughlan, referring to the goal that made it 2-0. “They played with one striker up there and we had two centre-halves who couldn’t look after him. “It’s annoying when you can’t get the basics of the game right and I suppose that maybe they are lacking a little bit of confidence and self-belief, but this can’t continue.” County suffered another dose of injury misfortune when 19-year-old Josh Seberry was stretchered off shortly after the opening goal. The Irish novice received lengthy treatment, had his right lower leg put in a protective boot and was given gas before being taken to hospital. “It’s a bad one. He is currently in the hospital and we will have to see what the medics want to do,” said Coughlan immediately after the game. “We are still awaiting news of the exact injury but we feel for him, he’s such a young kid and it was a bad one. “We have to get around him and await the decisions. Injuries are part and parcel of football but you never like to see players stretchered off with gas and air, as soon as that comes out you know it is serious.” County are also without defenders James Clarke (groin), Kyle Jameson (hip) and Adam Lewis (quad), midfielder Harry Charsley (ankle) and forwards Offrande Zanzala (knee) and Seb Palmer-Houlden (hamstring). They travel to Gillingham on Saturday with their hosts sitting seventh after a 1-0 win at Swindon.","pubDate":"2023-10-24 23:19:29","image_url":"https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/17367977/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesargus","source_priority":284631,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4e1865592896a7e1f3aa14309cfeb413","title":"Erik ten Hag heaps praise on United goalkeeper Andre Onana after penalty heroics","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23877476.erik-ten-hag-heaps-praise-united-goalkeeper-andre-onana-penalty-heroics/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Onana saved Jordan Larsson’s stoppage-time penalty to earn his side a 1-0 win against Copenhagen.","content":"Having kicked off Group A with defeats to Bayern Munich and Galatasaray, the Red Devils could ill-afford any slip-up against the Danish champions in Tuesday’s Old Trafford encounter.

Having kicked off Group A with defeats to Bayern Munich and Galatasaray, the Red Devils could ill-afford any slip-up against the Danish champions in Tuesday’s Old Trafford encounter.

Stepped up when it mattered. 🧤 || — Manchester United (@ManUtd) The United keeper saved Jordan Larsson’s stoppage-time penalty with what proved to be the last touch of the match, ensuring Harry Maguire’s second-half header sealed a crucial 1-0 win. “He showed personality and he knows that before was not the levels what his skills are,” manager Ten Hag said of the summer signing from Inter Milan. “He didn’t match his skills and he could do better. “I think Saturday (against Sheffield United) was a very good performance and today as well. “Also, don’t forget that brilliant save just after half-time in the counter-attack. “But, of course, that is one of his skills, he is a very good penalty saver.” Onana’s save sparked wild celebrations at a rocking Old Trafford, where he was mobbed by team-mates before United’s substitutes poured onto the pitch. “You see there is a very good spirit in the dressing room,” said Ten Hag, who claimed not to have seen Alejandro Garnacho scuffing the penalty spot. “They are together, they fight together and they celebrate together. “If we have setbacks, they support each other. I think that spirit is always needed to be a successful team.” United have won three straight matches in all competitions despite some unconvincing performances and improvements are needed against reigning Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. “First half no good, difficult,” Ten Hag said. “They were well organised, Copenhagen. “It was difficult to create chances.

The defender’s future appeared elsewhere having been stripped of the captaincy during a summer of speculation, but he has now made three straight starts and scored the key goal on Tuesday. “He is playing much more proactive in possession, stepping in, passing vertical,” the Dutchman said. “Defending also on the front foot, also stepping in, defending forward.

En esta 67ª edición, el astro argentino asistirá a la ceremonia con un impresionante récord, ya que es el ganador más condecorado de este galardón individual, habiendo obtenido siete en su carrera, en los años 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019 y 2021.

The hosts turned in another performance of the highest quality, picking up a comfortable 3-0 win over Heerenveen in the Eredivisie on Saturday. Pascal Jansen’s side have won their last four games across competitions, scoring 10 goals and keeping three clean sheets. AZ now turn their attention to the Conference League. They kicked off their campaign with a 4-3 loss against Zrinjski Mostar on September 21 before a hard-fought 1-0 win over Legia Warsaw. After two games, the Dutch outfit are second in Group E, level on three points with the three other sides in the group. Meanwhile, Aston Villa continued their fine run of results in the Premier League, as they stormed to a 4-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday. Unai Emery’s side have gone four games without defeat, winning three, including a 1-0 win over Zrinjski in the Conference League on October 5. However, Aston Villa have struggled on the road recently, losing twice and winning once in four games since September. Fresh off a superb team performance against West Ham, Aston Villa will journey to the AFAS Stadion with sky-high confidence as they look to rise from the bottom of the table. However, AZ have been near impenetrable at home this season and should hold out for a share of the spoils in a high-scoring draw.

The Gunners will lock horns with the 2022-23 UEFA Europa League winners at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan later today (October 24). They will be aiming to bounce back in the UCL after suffering a shock 2-1 away loss against Lens in their last fixture. David Raya starts in goal for Arsenal. Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, and Takehiro Tomiyasu make up the defense. The midfield consists of Jorginho, Declan Rice, and Martin Odegaard. Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, and Gabriel Jesus start in attack to complete Mikel Arteta's starting XI. Thomas Partey misses the clash against Sevilla due to a muscle injury. The 30-year-old midfielder has only made five appearances across all competitions after picking up a serious groin injury in August that kept him sidelined for six games. Many Arsenal fans have lost patience with the midfielder though and want him sold in the upcoming transfer window. One fan posted on X (formerly Twitter): Another fan posted: Here are some more reactions from fans on X: Mikel Arteta and Co. are currently second in Group B of the Champions League with three points from two games, one point behind Lens. Arsenal icon Ian Wright believes Oleksandr Zinchenko has struggled for form this season due to Granit Xhaka's exit from the Emirates during the summer transfer window. Xhaka played an integral role in Arsenal challenging Manchester City for the Premier League title last season, scoring nine goals and providing seven assists in 47 appearances across all competitions. But he made the surprising decision to leave the club to join Bayer Leverkusen over the summer. Zinchenko lost the great connection he had with Xhaka down the left flank, which Wright has noticed this season. He said (via Football London ): Zinchenko has made 11 appearances in total this season but is yet to register a goal contribution.

The Exiles’ miserable run of form continued at Meadow Lane where the Magpies showed their promotion credentials in a one-sided encounter. Notts County hit the front through Dan Crowley and then Macauley Langstaff scored goals either side of half-time. Newport County sit 19th in the table, five points above the relegation zone, after only Colchester won of the division’s strugglers. However, the Exiles have taken just six points from 10 games since an encouraging August and they continue to leak goals. 📈 How’s that table looking? | “They have quality players and they are up that end of the table for a reason, we are down our end for a reason,” said Coughlan. “It’s our inability to stay in games or keep clean sheets is hurting us and we need to correct it. “I could bemoan our injuries and not being able to get a settled back four but it doesn’t matter who goes into the team because it’s just basics. “It’s frightening when you see professional footballers and they are not able to do the basics. \"It’s really annoying as a former centre-half. If the players continue to make mistakes then we will continue to lose games.” The Magpies’ first came after Bryn Morris was dispossessed in midfield, the second came when Langstaff was unmarked in the middle of the goal and the third when he got the run on Ryan Delaney to slot from close range. “You cannot have two centre-halves outside the front post and the lad Longstaff in the middle of the goal – he’s got a big number 9 on his back, so that would tell you something,” said Coughlan, referring to the goal that made it 2-0. “They played with one striker up there and we had two centre-halves who couldn’t look after him. “It’s annoying when you can’t get the basics of the game right and I suppose that maybe they are lacking a little bit of confidence and self-belief, but this can’t continue.” County suffered another dose of injury misfortune when 19-year-old Josh Seberry was stretchered off shortly after the opening goal. The Irish novice received lengthy treatment, had his right lower leg put in a protective boot and was given gas before being taken to hospital. “It’s a bad one. He is currently in the hospital and we will have to see what the medics want to do,” said Coughlan immediately after the game. “We are still awaiting news of the exact injury but we feel for him, he’s such a young kid and it was a bad one. “We have to get around him and await the decisions. Injuries are part and parcel of football but you never like to see players stretchered off with gas and air, as soon as that comes out you know it is serious.” County are also without defenders James Clarke (groin), Kyle Jameson (hip) and Adam Lewis (quad), midfielder Harry Charsley (ankle) and forwards Offrande Zanzala (knee) and Seb Palmer-Houlden (hamstring). They travel to Gillingham on Saturday with their hosts sitting seventh after a 1-0 win at Swindon.","pubDate":"2023-10-24 23:19:29","image_url":"https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/17367977/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesargus","source_priority":284631,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4e1865592896a7e1f3aa14309cfeb413","title":"Erik ten Hag heaps praise on United goalkeeper Andre Onana after penalty heroics","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23877476.erik-ten-hag-heaps-praise-united-goalkeeper-andre-onana-penalty-heroics/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Onana saved Jordan Larsson’s stoppage-time penalty to earn his side a 1-0 win against Copenhagen.","content":"Having kicked off Group A with defeats to Bayern Munich and Galatasaray, the Red Devils could ill-afford any slip-up against the Danish champions in Tuesday’s Old Trafford encounter.

Stepped up when it mattered. 🧤 || — Manchester United (@ManUtd) The United keeper saved Jordan Larsson’s stoppage-time penalty with what proved to be the last touch of the match, ensuring Harry Maguire’s second-half header sealed a crucial 1-0 win. “He showed personality and he knows that before was not the levels what his skills are,” manager Ten Hag said of the summer signing from Inter Milan. “He didn’t match his skills and he could do better. “I think Saturday (against Sheffield United) was a very good performance and today as well. “Also, don’t forget that brilliant save just after half-time in the counter-attack. “But, of course, that is one of his skills, he is a very good penalty saver.” Onana’s save sparked wild celebrations at a rocking Old Trafford, where he was mobbed by team-mates before United’s substitutes poured onto the pitch. “You see there is a very good spirit in the dressing room,” said Ten Hag, who claimed not to have seen Alejandro Garnacho scuffing the penalty spot. “They are together, they fight together and they celebrate together. “If we have setbacks, they support each other. I think that spirit is always needed to be a successful team.” United have won three straight matches in all competitions despite some unconvincing performances and improvements are needed against reigning Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. “First half no good, difficult,” Ten Hag said. “They were well organised, Copenhagen. “It was difficult to create chances. We didn’t get the right build-up, so we didn’t get the tempo in the game. For all Mancunians, for us, for Sir Bobby Charlton ❤️ We are UNITED — Andre Onana (@AndreyOnana) “The second half I think was better. In the first half, we got some press on but not in many occasions or in a long period. “In the second half, both things were better and the build-up was better “The construction was better, more switches and also we created more chances. I think finally the win was justified but it was a narrow escape.” This was certainly a let-off for a United side who had the frequently-criticised Maguire to thank as well as Onana. The defender’s future appeared elsewhere having been stripped of the captaincy during a summer of speculation, but he has now made three straight starts and scored the key goal on Tuesday. “He is playing much more proactive in possession, stepping in, passing vertical,” the Dutchman said. “Defending also on the front foot, also stepping in, defending forward. Feels good 👊 || — Manchester United (@ManUtd) “Very confident in the duels. I think he is dominating, in the right moment putting in the aggression and dominating his opponents. “Then you see you also get rewarded, of course it’s a very good skill from him his heading, but I have to say great pass from Christian (Eriksen) as well but a very good finish.” These sides now return to domestic matters before resuming battle in Denmark in the reverse fixture on November 8. Copenhagen head coach Jacob Neestrup said: “We all know that we played a match where we allowed ourselves to get at least one point. “We had a big chance to score in the closing seconds, so that hurts. It really hurts. “I don’t believe in bad luck in football. Football is decided by important saves or goals, and in terms of that, we have been unable to tip it in our favour in the first three matches, which have led to one point. Those are the hard facts.”","pubDate":"2023-10-24 23:01:49","image_url":"https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/resources/images/17367972/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"northwalespioneer","source_priority":1008924,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ec85a7b178e393e0dbcff0ec993da130","title":"Erik ten Hag heaps praise on United goalkeeper Andre Onana after penalty heroics","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23877476.erik-ten-hag-heaps-praise-united-goalkeeper-andre-onana-penalty-heroics/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Onana saved Jordan Larsson’s stoppage-time penalty to earn his side a 1-0 win against Copenhagen.","content":"Erik ten Hag praised goalkeeper Andre Onana for putting a difficult start to life at Manchester United behind him and saving the day in a narrow Champions League escape against Copenhagen.
