Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is now said to have made contact with Neymar, amid reports Paris Saint-Germain are keen to offload the Brazilian star.","content":"It is believed the Brazilian is currently being courted by a range of top clubs, with the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, and Newcastle said to be interested in securing his signature ahead of next season. His future at the Parc des Princes looks more uncertain than ever before after PSG fans staged a protest outside the player's home, demanding that he leaves the club as soon as possible. The No. 10 has been a divisive figure in Paris ever since his world-record €222 million (R4.6 billion) transfer from FC Barcelona in 2017, with many supporters feeling he has not really lived up to his unprecedented price tag given that he is yet to help guide the team to UEFA Champions League glory in six seasons. Despite having a deal at the Ligue 1 club until 2027, Neymar could now seemingly be caught in a tug-of-war in Manchester, with the two town rivals believed to be interested in his services. According to , Guardiola reached out to Neymar via a phone call just a week after the player reportedly opened talks with the Red Devils. It is claimed the City boss wanted to find out what the 31-year-old's intentions are going forward and what his state of mind is amid his seemingly deteriorating relationship with PSG. It also stated, though, that it is unlikely the Citizens will sign the Selecao talisman, with his massive wages and poor injury record potentially stumbling blocks to a deal, but the transfer has not yet been ruled out completely. However, Brazil legend Rivaldo has revealed he would like to see Neymar go to Old Trafford. \"I am in favour of Neymar transferring to Manchester United,\" Rivaldo told . \"In recent days there has been talk that Neymar might sign for the Premier League giants at the end of the season and, unlike when he left Barcelona for PSG, this time I am in favour of this move. \"In 2017, I didn't think it was beneficial for Neymar to leave for France, although I understood his reasons. But now I am convinced that playing in the Premier League with Manchester United would be an excellent step in his career. \"Playing in the best league in the world in the shirt of a legendary club is something that suits very well a great player like Neymar who needs a new challenge. Moreover, United are going through a recovery phase under coach Erik ten Hag. \"The team will secure Champions League qualification, have already won the League Cup and can still win the FA Cup, so I see Neymar arriving at a more structured club now and one that is ready to welcome a football superstar who will surely give a lot to them.\" You must be to read and post comments.","pubDate":"2023-05-30 16:45:15","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/kickoff24.png","source_id":"snl24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Swansea City transfer news as John Eustace gatecrashes Swans job race and striker says move 'too good to turn down'","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-transfer-news-john-27021242","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Tom Coleman)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The latest news from the Swansea.com Stadium","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-30 15:00:57","image_url":"https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article26862188.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Millwall-v-Birmingham-City-Sky-Bet-Championship-The-Den.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney donate thousands to Welsh children's hospital ward","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-donate-27021632","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Katie Sands)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Hollywood duo ensured a local fundraising target was reached","content":"Wrexham AFC co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have donated £5,000 towards the children's ward at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The Hollywood stars made the donation via a JustGiving page set up to raise funds through a charity football match between Wrexham Police FC and FC United of Wrexham. The actors simply wrote \"Up The Town\" alongside Welsh, Canadian and US flags in their message, and signed it from RR McReynolds. The generous financial gift, made on Sunday, means the initial fundraising target of £5,000 was reached quickly, and now the target has been doubled to £10,000. Wrexham Police FC, a group of off-duty officers who play football against community groups and raise money for local causes and charities, said on Twitter : \"Wow. Thank you so very much for your generous donation towards our charity match in aid of Wrexham Maelor Children’s Ward. It’ll make a positive difference to the lives of many children from across the area, diolch\". The two sides will face off on Saturday, July 1, at Bronwen's Green, Wrexham (10.30am kick-off). A statement on the online crowdfunding page says: \"After hitting out initial target of £5,000 we’re now aiming to raise £10,000 as every donation, big or small will make a huge difference to the ward, the patients and families they support. The children's ward looks after children and young people from birth to 18 years from a variety of specialties including high dependency, oncology and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, etc. Their service users come from all across Wrexham and Flintshire as well as parts of Shropshire, Powys and Gwynedd . Your support helps fund some of the added extras - big and small - that go above and beyond what the NHS is able to provide, making a real difference for local patients and their families when they need it the most.\" You can view the JustGiving page and donate here. Reynolds and McElhenney, both 46, completed a £2million deal to buy Wrexham in February 2021 and have since been regulars at the Racecourse Ground, also immersing themselves into the wider community. This season, they oversaw a double promotion - the men's side secured a return to the EFL for the first time in 15 years, while the women's side were promoted to the top tier of Welsh women's domestic football, the Adran Premier.

Legenda Timnas Prancis dan Barcelona Eric Abidal melaksanakan salat magrib berjamaah bersama pemain Timnas U-16. Abidal hadir di Jakarta atas undangan Ketua Umum PSSI, Erick Thohir.

Mendapat saf paling belakang, Abidal khusyuk menunaikan salat wajib tiga rakaat dalam rukun Islam. Usai salat, Abidal melanjutkannya dengan doa. Abidal besar di lingkungan keluarga Katolik. Pria kelahiran Saint-Genis-Laval, Prancis, 11 September 1979, itu mengenal islam sekitar tahun 2000an dan sudah menjadi mualaf saat menikahi wanita asli Aljazair, Hayet Kebir pada 2003. Abidal tidak memungkiri bahwa Hayet membantunya untuk mengenal Islam lebih dekat. Tapi dia membantah jika keputusannya memeluk islam karena Hayet Kebir. “Semua prosesnya natural (menjadi mualaf). Memilih pindah ke Islam bukan karena istri saya, tapi hadiah yang tiba-tiba muncul,” jelas Abidal kepada France Football, April 2023 lalu.

Jota had double the cause for celebration after his former team clinched the Portuguese Primeira Liga title yesterday as Celtic simultaneously commemorated winning the Scottish Premiership . The 24-year-old congratulated his former side on their victory, but team mate Alistair Johnston decided to sit the celebrations out after previously teasing his pal over his history at the Portuguese side. Jota celebrated the Lisbon side’s success by sharing an image to Instagram. Credit: Instagram The pair had left fans in stitches following an interview earlier this month which saw them quizzed on each other alongside defender Carl Starfelt. When Johnston was asked where the Hoops had signed Jota, he replied “Bench-fica” leaving fans wondering whether he was teasing his mate’s accent or the lack of Jota’s playing time at his former club. The Parkhead winger took to Instagram last night to congratulate Benfica’s Primeira Liga win with the caption: “Habemus Benfica.” The Portuguese accompanied the caption – which translates to “We are Benfica” – with a black and white picture of himself sporting his trademark mullet and clad in a retro Benfica shirt. His post received more than 56,000 likes and over 600 comments from fans. Canadian team-mate Johnston wasted little time in quickly getting his jibe in, joking: “No comment.” Fans were quick to praise Johnston for his sense of humour whilst Benfica fans ordered him to respect the “best club in the world”. One said: “Underrated patter.” Another added: “Benchfica.” A third replied: “Benfica is the greatest club on earth.” Another remarked: “[Benfica] is really better, respect the best club in the world.” Jota himself commented under the right-back’s message, writing: “You’re always welcome mate.” The pair will put their banter to one side as they look to guide Celtic to a treble this Saturday against Inverness Caledonian Thistle at Hampden Park. A win would see Celtic secure a record eighth treble and their fifth in the last seven seasons.

Katie Richards’ grandad Paul McGuire sadly passed away on Friday night having gone into hospital for a heart bypass operation – but left the family with a final promise. The 73-year-old’s touching final conversation with Katie’s dad before his operation saw him pledge that The Hatters would win in their promotion play-off match against Coventry City on Saturday. Despite the heartbreaking circumstances Katie, 21, and her family were left overjoyed when their grandad’s prediction rang true and Luton clawed their way into the Premier League. Video shows Katie at home with her partner and father as they watch Luton secure Premier League status for the first time in their history with a dramatic penalty shootout. The family watch on as the final whistle sounds after Luton’s 6-5 victory on penalties, with the trio exploding into celebrations. The on-screen text reads: “POV: Your grandad died three days ago and before he died he promised my dad he’d be watching and they’d win.” Katie’s dad jumps up and down whilst clenching his fists as he falls to the ground overjoyed with emotion as he slaps the carpet shouting: “F***ing hell yes! Yes, yes yes!” He then crawls and hugs his daughter whilst watching the euphoric scenes play out in their living room. The three then hug each other whilst saying: “We’re in the Premier League!” Katie uploaded the video to social media on Sunday with the caption: “He was deffo there in spirit.” The clip has since received over 80,000 likes and more than 660 comments from users left touched by the family’s explosion of emotion. One user wrote: “What a proud moment for you all…so emotional.” Another commented: “We’re in the Prem baby. I’m so sorry about your grandad, my mum died two months ago and she was defo with us at Wembley?.” A third replied: “As a Coventry fan, this makes me smile, congratulations!” Another user said: “Congratulations, I’m sure it meant everything to you all and your grandad. Truly wholesome.” Celebrations from the garden. Credits: Katie Richards. Speaking today Katie said: “It’s been such an awful time for us as a family but we got a bit of joy on Saturday after Luton winning. “My grandad died pretty suddenly on Friday, he went for a heart bypass operation on Sunday 21. “The operation itself went okay, the bypass was perfect however my grandad didn’t make it out, his organs failed him and he couldn’t wake back up. “Before he went under for the operation, my mum and dad took him to the hospital and my dad had a chat about the football with him as my dad is Luton Town born and bred, and has been a season ticket holder for 35 years. “He said he’d be sitting up in his chair recovering watching it and he had a real good feeling they’d win, unfortunately he never got to watch the game. “Me and my dad were meant to go and watch the game at Wembley, however being with family at this time was way more important. “Going to a football match when you have to face people and explain is very hard. “So many people knew my grandad and he will be missed so much but I have a real good feeling he was up there cheering them on. “My family’s relationship with Luton Town is crazy. We’ve been supporters since forever and my dad’s been to basically every single game. “We were so heartbroken by the shocking news and having to say bye to grandad when he was in ICU. “Through the whole game dad couldn’t get it out of his head that one of his last conversations with grandad was about the game, we prayed and prayed for them to give us a win. “Luton deserves this, they’ve played well all season, we’ve never seen them get into the Premier League and when I tell you my dads life is Luton Town. “He adores them, this means everything for them. Even if we don’t stay up, we need the money as a club, we need a new stadium which we’ve been waiting for, for a long time. “There’s just so many good opportunities to go to different stadiums and Premier League stadiums we’ve never been to or played at. “We called the universe for some good luck and feel grandad gave us that on the day.” The post Heartwarming video shows family brought to tears as Luton Town gain promotion just a day after footie-mad grandad passed away appeared first on Deadline News.","pubDate":"2023-05-30 14:32:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"deadlinenews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Foot – Ligue 1 (8e J) : les arbitres des matches en retard","link":"https://africanmanager.com/foot-ligue-1-8e-j-les-arbitres-des-matches-en-retard/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["African Manager"],"video_url":null,"description":"Désignation des arbitres qui dirigeront les matches en retard de la 8e journée play-off de la Ligue 1 du football professionnel, prévues mercredi et jeudi :Mercredi 1er juinA Béja (16h00) :O.

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is now said to have made contact with Neymar, amid reports Paris Saint-Germain are keen to offload the Brazilian star.","content":"It is believed the Brazilian is currently being courted by a range of top clubs, with the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, and Newcastle said to be interested in securing his signature ahead of next season. His future at the Parc des Princes looks more uncertain than ever before after PSG fans staged a protest outside the player's home, demanding that he leaves the club as soon as possible. The No. 10 has been a divisive figure in Paris ever since his world-record €222 million (R4.6 billion) transfer from FC Barcelona in 2017, with many supporters feeling he has not really lived up to his unprecedented price tag given that he is yet to help guide the team to UEFA Champions League glory in six seasons. Despite having a deal at the Ligue 1 club until 2027, Neymar could now seemingly be caught in a tug-of-war in Manchester, with the two town rivals believed to be interested in his services. According to , Guardiola reached out to Neymar via a phone call just a week after the player reportedly opened talks with the Red Devils. It is claimed the City boss wanted to find out what the 31-year-old's intentions are going forward and what his state of mind is amid his seemingly deteriorating relationship with PSG. It also stated, though, that it is unlikely the Citizens will sign the Selecao talisman, with his massive wages and poor injury record potentially stumbling blocks to a deal, but the transfer has not yet been ruled out completely. However, Brazil legend Rivaldo has revealed he would like to see Neymar go to Old Trafford. \"I am in favour of Neymar transferring to Manchester United,\" Rivaldo told . \"In recent days there has been talk that Neymar might sign for the Premier League giants at the end of the season and, unlike when he left Barcelona for PSG, this time I am in favour of this move. \"In 2017, I didn't think it was beneficial for Neymar to leave for France, although I understood his reasons. But now I am convinced that playing in the Premier League with Manchester United would be an excellent step in his career. \"Playing in the best league in the world in the shirt of a legendary club is something that suits very well a great player like Neymar who needs a new challenge. Moreover, United are going through a recovery phase under coach Erik ten Hag. \"The team will secure Champions League qualification, have already won the League Cup and can still win the FA Cup, so I see Neymar arriving at a more structured club now and one that is ready to welcome a football superstar who will surely give a lot to them.\" You must be to read and post comments.","pubDate":"2023-05-30 16:45:15","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/kickoff24.png","source_id":"snl24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Swansea City transfer news as John Eustace gatecrashes Swans job race and striker says move 'too good to turn down'","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-transfer-news-john-27021242","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Tom Coleman)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The latest news from the Swansea.com Stadium","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-30 15:00:57","image_url":"https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article26862188.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Millwall-v-Birmingham-City-Sky-Bet-Championship-The-Den.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney donate thousands to Welsh children's hospital ward","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-donate-27021632","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Katie Sands)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Hollywood duo ensured a local fundraising target was reached","content":"Wrexham AFC co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have donated £5,000 towards the children's ward at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The Hollywood stars made the donation via a JustGiving page set up to raise funds through a charity football match between Wrexham Police FC and FC United of Wrexham. The actors simply wrote \"Up The Town\" alongside Welsh, Canadian and US flags in their message, and signed it from RR McReynolds. The generous financial gift, made on Sunday, means the initial fundraising target of £5,000 was reached quickly, and now the target has been doubled to £10,000. Wrexham Police FC, a group of off-duty officers who play football against community groups and raise money for local causes and charities, said on Twitter : \"Wow. Thank you so very much for your generous donation towards our charity match in aid of Wrexham Maelor Children’s Ward. It’ll make a positive difference to the lives of many children from across the area, diolch\". The two sides will face off on Saturday, July 1, at Bronwen's Green, Wrexham (10.30am kick-off). A statement on the online crowdfunding page says: \"After hitting out initial target of £5,000 we’re now aiming to raise £10,000 as every donation, big or small will make a huge difference to the ward, the patients and families they support. The children's ward looks after children and young people from birth to 18 years from a variety of specialties including high dependency, oncology and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, etc. Their service users come from all across Wrexham and Flintshire as well as parts of Shropshire, Powys and Gwynedd . Your support helps fund some of the added extras - big and small - that go above and beyond what the NHS is able to provide, making a real difference for local patients and their families when they need it the most.\" You can view the JustGiving page and donate here. Reynolds and McElhenney, both 46, completed a £2million deal to buy Wrexham in February 2021 and have since been regulars at the Racecourse Ground, also immersing themselves into the wider community. This season, they oversaw a double promotion - the men's side secured a return to the EFL for the first time in 15 years, while the women's side were promoted to the top tier of Welsh women's domestic football, the Adran Premier.

Mendapat saf paling belakang, Abidal khusyuk menunaikan salat wajib tiga rakaat dalam rukun Islam. Usai salat, Abidal melanjutkannya dengan doa. Abidal besar di lingkungan keluarga Katolik. Pria kelahiran Saint-Genis-Laval, Prancis, 11 September 1979, itu mengenal islam sekitar tahun 2000an dan sudah menjadi mualaf saat menikahi wanita asli Aljazair, Hayet Kebir pada 2003. Abidal tidak memungkiri bahwa Hayet membantunya untuk mengenal Islam lebih dekat. Tapi dia membantah jika keputusannya memeluk islam karena Hayet Kebir. “Semua prosesnya natural (menjadi mualaf). Memilih pindah ke Islam bukan karena istri saya, tapi hadiah yang tiba-tiba muncul,” jelas Abidal kepada France Football, April 2023 lalu.

Jota had double the cause for celebration after his former team clinched the Portuguese Primeira Liga title yesterday as Celtic simultaneously commemorated winning the Scottish Premiership . The 24-year-old congratulated his former side on their victory, but team mate Alistair Johnston decided to sit the celebrations out after previously teasing his pal over his history at the Portuguese side. Jota celebrated the Lisbon side’s success by sharing an image to Instagram. Credit: Instagram The pair had left fans in stitches following an interview earlier this month which saw them quizzed on each other alongside defender Carl Starfelt. When Johnston was asked where the Hoops had signed Jota, he replied “Bench-fica” leaving fans wondering whether he was teasing his mate’s accent or the lack of Jota’s playing time at his former club. The Parkhead winger took to Instagram last night to congratulate Benfica’s Primeira Liga win with the caption: “Habemus Benfica.” The Portuguese accompanied the caption – which translates to “We are Benfica” – with a black and white picture of himself sporting his trademark mullet and clad in a retro Benfica shirt. His post received more than 56,000 likes and over 600 comments from fans. Canadian team-mate Johnston wasted little time in quickly getting his jibe in, joking: “No comment.” Fans were quick to praise Johnston for his sense of humour whilst Benfica fans ordered him to respect the “best club in the world”. One said: “Underrated patter.” Another added: “Benchfica.” A third replied: “Benfica is the greatest club on earth.” Another remarked: “[Benfica] is really better, respect the best club in the world.” Jota himself commented under the right-back’s message, writing: “You’re always welcome mate.” The pair will put their banter to one side as they look to guide Celtic to a treble this Saturday against Inverness Caledonian Thistle at Hampden Park. A win would see Celtic secure a record eighth treble and their fifth in the last seven seasons.

Katie Richards’ grandad Paul McGuire sadly passed away on Friday night having gone into hospital for a heart bypass operation – but left the family with a final promise. The 73-year-old’s touching final conversation with Katie’s dad before his operation saw him pledge that The Hatters would win in their promotion play-off match against Coventry City on Saturday. Despite the heartbreaking circumstances Katie, 21, and her family were left overjoyed when their grandad’s prediction rang true and Luton clawed their way into the Premier League. Video shows Katie at home with her partner and father as they watch Luton secure Premier League status for the first time in their history with a dramatic penalty shootout. The family watch on as the final whistle sounds after Luton’s 6-5 victory on penalties, with the trio exploding into celebrations. The on-screen text reads: “POV: Your grandad died three days ago and before he died he promised my dad he’d be watching and they’d win.” Katie’s dad jumps up and down whilst clenching his fists as he falls to the ground overjoyed with emotion as he slaps the carpet shouting: “F***ing hell yes! Yes, yes yes!” He then crawls and hugs his daughter whilst watching the euphoric scenes play out in their living room. The three then hug each other whilst saying: “We’re in the Premier League!” Katie uploaded the video to social media on Sunday with the caption: “He was deffo there in spirit.” The clip has since received over 80,000 likes and more than 660 comments from users left touched by the family’s explosion of emotion. One user wrote: “What a proud moment for you all…so emotional.” Another commented: “We’re in the Prem baby. I’m so sorry about your grandad, my mum died two months ago and she was defo with us at Wembley?.” A third replied: “As a Coventry fan, this makes me smile, congratulations!” Another user said: “Congratulations, I’m sure it meant everything to you all and your grandad. Truly wholesome.” Celebrations from the garden. Credits: Katie Richards. Speaking today Katie said: “It’s been such an awful time for us as a family but we got a bit of joy on Saturday after Luton winning. “My grandad died pretty suddenly on Friday, he went for a heart bypass operation on Sunday 21. “The operation itself went okay, the bypass was perfect however my grandad didn’t make it out, his organs failed him and he couldn’t wake back up. “Before he went under for the operation, my mum and dad took him to the hospital and my dad had a chat about the football with him as my dad is Luton Town born and bred, and has been a season ticket holder for 35 years. “He said he’d be sitting up in his chair recovering watching it and he had a real good feeling they’d win, unfortunately he never got to watch the game. “Me and my dad were meant to go and watch the game at Wembley, however being with family at this time was way more important. “Going to a football match when you have to face people and explain is very hard. “So many people knew my grandad and he will be missed so much but I have a real good feeling he was up there cheering them on. “My family’s relationship with Luton Town is crazy. We’ve been supporters since forever and my dad’s been to basically every single game. “We were so heartbroken by the shocking news and having to say bye to grandad when he was in ICU. “Through the whole game dad couldn’t get it out of his head that one of his last conversations with grandad was about the game, we prayed and prayed for them to give us a win. “Luton deserves this, they’ve played well all season, we’ve never seen them get into the Premier League and when I tell you my dads life is Luton Town. “He adores them, this means everything for them. Even if we don’t stay up, we need the money as a club, we need a new stadium which we’ve been waiting for, for a long time. “There’s just so many good opportunities to go to different stadiums and Premier League stadiums we’ve never been to or played at. “We called the universe for some good luck and feel grandad gave us that on the day.” The post Heartwarming video shows family brought to tears as Luton Town gain promotion just a day after footie-mad grandad passed away appeared first on Deadline News.","pubDate":"2023-05-30 14:32:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"deadlinenews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Foot – Ligue 1 (8e J) : les arbitres des matches en retard","link":"https://africanmanager.com/foot-ligue-1-8e-j-les-arbitres-des-matches-en-retard/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["African Manager"],"video_url":null,"description":"Désignation des arbitres qui dirigeront les matches en retard de la 8e journée play-off de la Ligue 1 du football professionnel, prévues mercredi et jeudi :Mercredi 1er juinA Béja (16h00) :O.

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is now said to have made contact with Neymar, amid reports Paris Saint-Germain are keen to offload the Brazilian star.","content":"It is believed the Brazilian is currently being courted by a range of top clubs, with the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, and Newcastle said to be interested in securing his signature ahead of next season. His future at the Parc des Princes looks more uncertain than ever before after PSG fans staged a protest outside the player's home, demanding that he leaves the club as soon as possible. The No. 10 has been a divisive figure in Paris ever since his world-record €222 million (R4.6 billion) transfer from FC Barcelona in 2017, with many supporters feeling he has not really lived up to his unprecedented price tag given that he is yet to help guide the team to UEFA Champions League glory in six seasons. Despite having a deal at the Ligue 1 club until 2027, Neymar could now seemingly be caught in a tug-of-war in Manchester, with the two town rivals believed to be interested in his services. According to , Guardiola reached out to Neymar via a phone call just a week after the player reportedly opened talks with the Red Devils. It is claimed the City boss wanted to find out what the 31-year-old's intentions are going forward and what his state of mind is amid his seemingly deteriorating relationship with PSG. It also stated, though, that it is unlikely the Citizens will sign the Selecao talisman, with his massive wages and poor injury record potentially stumbling blocks to a deal, but the transfer has not yet been ruled out completely. However, Brazil legend Rivaldo has revealed he would like to see Neymar go to Old Trafford. \"I am in favour of Neymar transferring to Manchester United,\" Rivaldo told . \"In recent days there has been talk that Neymar might sign for the Premier League giants at the end of the season and, unlike when he left Barcelona for PSG, this time I am in favour of this move. \"In 2017, I didn't think it was beneficial for Neymar to leave for France, although I understood his reasons. But now I am convinced that playing in the Premier League with Manchester United would be an excellent step in his career. \"Playing in the best league in the world in the shirt of a legendary club is something that suits very well a great player like Neymar who needs a new challenge. Moreover, United are going through a recovery phase under coach Erik ten Hag. \"The team will secure Champions League qualification, have already won the League Cup and can still win the FA Cup, so I see Neymar arriving at a more structured club now and one that is ready to welcome a football superstar who will surely give a lot to them.\" You must be to read and post comments.","pubDate":"2023-05-30 16:45:15","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/kickoff24.png","source_id":"snl24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Swansea City transfer news as John Eustace gatecrashes Swans job race and striker says move 'too good to turn down'","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/swansea-city-transfer-news-john-27021242","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Tom Coleman)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The latest news from the Swansea.com Stadium","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-30 15:00:57","image_url":"https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article26862188.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Millwall-v-Birmingham-City-Sky-Bet-Championship-The-Den.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney donate thousands to Welsh children's hospital ward","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-donate-27021632","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (Katie Sands)"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Hollywood duo ensured a local fundraising target was reached","content":"Wrexham AFC co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have donated £5,000 towards the children's ward at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The Hollywood stars made the donation via a JustGiving page set up to raise funds through a charity football match between Wrexham Police FC and FC United of Wrexham. The actors simply wrote \"Up The Town\" alongside Welsh, Canadian and US flags in their message, and signed it from RR McReynolds. The generous financial gift, made on Sunday, means the initial fundraising target of £5,000 was reached quickly, and now the target has been doubled to £10,000. Wrexham Police FC, a group of off-duty officers who play football against community groups and raise money for local causes and charities, said on Twitter : \"Wow. Thank you so very much for your generous donation towards our charity match in aid of Wrexham Maelor Children’s Ward. It’ll make a positive difference to the lives of many children from across the area, diolch\". The two sides will face off on Saturday, July 1, at Bronwen's Green, Wrexham (10.30am kick-off). A statement on the online crowdfunding page says: \"After hitting out initial target of £5,000 we’re now aiming to raise £10,000 as every donation, big or small will make a huge difference to the ward, the patients and families they support. The children's ward looks after children and young people from birth to 18 years from a variety of specialties including high dependency, oncology and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, etc. Their service users come from all across Wrexham and Flintshire as well as parts of Shropshire, Powys and Gwynedd . Your support helps fund some of the added extras - big and small - that go above and beyond what the NHS is able to provide, making a real difference for local patients and their families when they need it the most.\" You can view the JustGiving page and donate here. Reynolds and McElhenney, both 46, completed a £2million deal to buy Wrexham in February 2021 and have since been regulars at the Racecourse Ground, also immersing themselves into the wider community. This season, they oversaw a double promotion - the men's side secured a return to the EFL for the first time in 15 years, while the women's side were promoted to the top tier of Welsh women's domestic football, the Adran Premier.

Mendapat saf paling belakang, Abidal khusyuk menunaikan salat wajib tiga rakaat dalam rukun Islam. Usai salat, Abidal melanjutkannya dengan doa. Abidal besar di lingkungan keluarga Katolik. Pria kelahiran Saint-Genis-Laval, Prancis, 11 September 1979, itu mengenal islam sekitar tahun 2000an dan sudah menjadi mualaf saat menikahi wanita asli Aljazair, Hayet Kebir pada 2003. Abidal tidak memungkiri bahwa Hayet membantunya untuk mengenal Islam lebih dekat. Tapi dia membantah jika keputusannya memeluk islam karena Hayet Kebir. “Semua prosesnya natural (menjadi mualaf). Memilih pindah ke Islam bukan karena istri saya, tapi hadiah yang tiba-tiba muncul,” jelas Abidal kepada France Football, April 2023 lalu.

Jota had double the cause for celebration after his former team clinched the Portuguese Primeira Liga title yesterday as Celtic simultaneously commemorated winning the Scottish Premiership . The 24-year-old congratulated his former side on their victory, but team mate Alistair Johnston decided to sit the celebrations out after previously teasing his pal over his history at the Portuguese side. Jota celebrated the Lisbon side’s success by sharing an image to Instagram. Credit: Instagram The pair had left fans in stitches following an interview earlier this month which saw them quizzed on each other alongside defender Carl Starfelt. When Johnston was asked where the Hoops had signed Jota, he replied “Bench-fica” leaving fans wondering whether he was teasing his mate’s accent or the lack of Jota’s playing time at his former club. The Parkhead winger took to Instagram last night to congratulate Benfica’s Primeira Liga win with the caption: “Habemus Benfica.” The Portuguese accompanied the caption – which translates to “We are Benfica” – with a black and white picture of himself sporting his trademark mullet and clad in a retro Benfica shirt. His post received more than 56,000 likes and over 600 comments from fans. Canadian team-mate Johnston wasted little time in quickly getting his jibe in, joking: “No comment.” Fans were quick to praise Johnston for his sense of humour whilst Benfica fans ordered him to respect the “best club in the world”. One said: “Underrated patter.” Another added: “Benchfica.” A third replied: “Benfica is the greatest club on earth.” Another remarked: “[Benfica] is really better, respect the best club in the world.” Jota himself commented under the right-back’s message, writing: “You’re always welcome mate.” The pair will put their banter to one side as they look to guide Celtic to a treble this Saturday against Inverness Caledonian Thistle at Hampden Park. A win would see Celtic secure a record eighth treble and their fifth in the last seven seasons.

Katie Richards’ grandad Paul McGuire sadly passed away on Friday night having gone into hospital for a heart bypass operation – but left the family with a final promise. The 73-year-old’s touching final conversation with Katie’s dad before his operation saw him pledge that The Hatters would win in their promotion play-off match against Coventry City on Saturday. Despite the heartbreaking circumstances Katie, 21, and her family were left overjoyed when their grandad’s prediction rang true and Luton clawed their way into the Premier League. Video shows Katie at home with her partner and father as they watch Luton secure Premier League status for the first time in their history with a dramatic penalty shootout. The family watch on as the final whistle sounds after Luton’s 6-5 victory on penalties, with the trio exploding into celebrations. The on-screen text reads: “POV: Your grandad died three days ago and before he died he promised my dad he’d be watching and they’d win.” Katie’s dad jumps up and down whilst clenching his fists as he falls to the ground overjoyed with emotion as he slaps the carpet shouting: “F***ing hell yes! Yes, yes yes!” He then crawls and hugs his daughter whilst watching the euphoric scenes play out in their living room. The three then hug each other whilst saying: “We’re in the Premier League!” Katie uploaded the video to social media on Sunday with the caption: “He was deffo there in spirit.” The clip has since received over 80,000 likes and more than 660 comments from users left touched by the family’s explosion of emotion. One user wrote: “What a proud moment for you all…so emotional.” Another commented: “We’re in the Prem baby. I’m so sorry about your grandad, my mum died two months ago and she was defo with us at Wembley?.” A third replied: “As a Coventry fan, this makes me smile, congratulations!” Another user said: “Congratulations, I’m sure it meant everything to you all and your grandad. Truly wholesome.” Celebrations from the garden. Credits: Katie Richards. Speaking today Katie said: “It’s been such an awful time for us as a family but we got a bit of joy on Saturday after Luton winning. “My grandad died pretty suddenly on Friday, he went for a heart bypass operation on Sunday 21. “The operation itself went okay, the bypass was perfect however my grandad didn’t make it out, his organs failed him and he couldn’t wake back up. “Before he went under for the operation, my mum and dad took him to the hospital and my dad had a chat about the football with him as my dad is Luton Town born and bred, and has been a season ticket holder for 35 years. “He said he’d be sitting up in his chair recovering watching it and he had a real good feeling they’d win, unfortunately he never got to watch the game. “Me and my dad were meant to go and watch the game at Wembley, however being with family at this time was way more important. “Going to a football match when you have to face people and explain is very hard. “So many people knew my grandad and he will be missed so much but I have a real good feeling he was up there cheering them on. “My family’s relationship with Luton Town is crazy. We’ve been supporters since forever and my dad’s been to basically every single game. “We were so heartbroken by the shocking news and having to say bye to grandad when he was in ICU. “Through the whole game dad couldn’t get it out of his head that one of his last conversations with grandad was about the game, we prayed and prayed for them to give us a win. “Luton deserves this, they’ve played well all season, we’ve never seen them get into the Premier League and when I tell you my dads life is Luton Town. “He adores them, this means everything for them. Even if we don’t stay up, we need the money as a club, we need a new stadium which we’ve been waiting for, for a long time. “There’s just so many good opportunities to go to different stadiums and Premier League stadiums we’ve never been to or played at. “We called the universe for some good luck and feel grandad gave us that on the day.” The post Heartwarming video shows family brought to tears as Luton Town gain promotion just a day after footie-mad grandad passed away appeared first on Deadline News.","pubDate":"2023-05-30 14:32:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"deadlinenews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Foot – Ligue 1 (8e J) : les arbitres des matches en retard","link":"https://africanmanager.com/foot-ligue-1-8e-j-les-arbitres-des-matches-en-retard/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["African Manager"],"video_url":null,"description":"Désignation des arbitres qui dirigeront les matches en retard de la 8e journée play-off de la Ligue 1 du football professionnel, prévues mercredi et jeudi :Mercredi 1er juinA Béja (16h00) :O.
