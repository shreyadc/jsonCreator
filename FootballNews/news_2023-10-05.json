Michigan State fired Tucker last month after an investigation into sexual harassment allegations involving a sexual assault awareness speaker, Brenda Tracy. Attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal sent the letter to the university's interim president, Dr. Teresa Woodruff, and the board of trustees just before an administrative hearing into the misconduct allegations against Tucker began on Thursday morning. The letter claims that Tucker's accuser \"appears to have made a career out of misleading and manipulating people.\" It also says Tracy \"manipulated a key witness\" and \"deleted key evidence\" when she filed her formal complaint against Tucker in December 2022. Tracy's attorney did not respond to a request for comment from ESPN. Tucker, 51, did not attend Thursday's hearing due to an undisclosed medical condition, according to his representatives. At stake for Tucker is the $79 million he had remaining on his contract when the school fired him on Sept. 27. The university said Tucker violated his contract's moral turpitude clause and brought ridicule upon the school with his actions, including what Tracy said was an unwanted phone sex encounter. Tucker was hired in February 2020. The Spartans (2-3, 0-2 Big Ten) have lost all three games since elevating defensive backs coach Harlon Barnett to interim head coach. --Field Level Media","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:27:49","image_url":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/b4/3b4fc70f-78a4-5daf-bf7e-bf7af480f1c3/651ef648be900.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200","source_id":"postguam","source_priority":93374,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"de2522e6a82d281f9c081133393c0dac","title":"–¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä: –ú—ñ–π —Å–∏–Ω —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏–π—Ç–∏ –∑ –ø—ñ–¥—Ç—Ä–∏–±—É–Ω–∫–∏ –∑ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, –∞ –Ω–µ –º–Ω–æ—é","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/10/05/940355/trippyer-miy-syn-khotiv-vyyty-z-pidtrybunky-z-mbappe-a-ne-mnoyu","keywords":["–§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–°–∏–Ω –∫–∞–ø—ñ—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª–∞ –ö—ñ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä–∞ –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± - –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∞–Ω–∞—Ç –ö—ñ–ª—ñ–∞–Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ.–ü—Ä–æ —Ü–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª—ñ—î—Ü—å —Ä–æ–∑–ø–æ–≤—ñ–≤ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª—É Sky Sports Premier League.\"–í—ñ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Å—Ö–∏–±–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, –ø–æ—Å—Ç—ñ–π–Ω–æ –¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –≤—ñ–¥–µ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—ñ–∑–∫–∏ –π–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –Ω–∞ —é—Ç—É–±—ñ. –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏–π—Ç–∏ –∑ –Ω–∏–º...","content":"#–ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥ , #–¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä –î–∂–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ - –ß–µ–º–ø—ñ–æ–Ω . –°–∏–Ω –∫–∞–ø—ñ—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª–∞ –ö—ñ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä–∞ –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± - –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∞–Ω–∞—Ç –ö—ñ–ª—ñ–∞–Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ. –ü—Ä–æ —Ü–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª—ñ—î—Ü—å —Ä–æ–∑–ø–æ–≤—ñ–≤ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª—É Sky Sports Premier League. \"–í—ñ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Å—Ö–∏–±–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, –ø–æ—Å—Ç—ñ–π–Ω–æ –¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –≤—ñ–¥–µ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—ñ–∑–∫–∏ –π–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –Ω–∞ —é—Ç—É–±—ñ. –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏–π—Ç–∏ –∑ –Ω–∏–º, –∞ –Ω–µ –º–Ω–æ—é! –Ø —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤ —Å–∏–Ω–æ–≤—ñ: \"–Ø–∫—â–æ –≤–∏–π–¥–µ—à –∑ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, —Ç–æ –Ω–∞–≤—ñ—Ç—å –Ω–µ –¥–∏–≤–∏—Å—è –Ω–∞ –º–µ–Ω–µ –≤ –ø—ñ–¥—Ç—Ä–∏–±—É–Ω—Ü—ñ\". –ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª - –ü–°–ñ 4:1: –æ–≥–ª—è–¥ –º–∞—Ç—á—É –Ø –≤–∂–µ –≥—Ä–∞–≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –ö—ñ–ª—ñ–∞–Ω–∞ - —Ç–æ –±—É–≤ –π–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–±—é—Ç–Ω–∏–π –º–∞—Ç—á –∑–∞ –ú–æ–Ω–∞–∫–æ, –∫–æ–ª–∏ —è –≤–∏—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–≤ –∑–∞ –¢–æ—Ç—Ç–µ–Ω–≥–µ–º. –¢–∞–∫–æ–∂ —è –≥—Ä–∞–≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω—å–æ–≥–æ —É —Å–≤–æ—î–º—É –¥–µ–±—é—Ç–Ω–æ–º—É –º–∞—Ç—á—ñ –∑–∞ –∑–±—ñ—Ä–Ω—É –ê–Ω–≥–ª—ñ—ó\", - —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤ –¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä. \"I said to him if you get to walk out with him, don't look at me in the tunnel!\" üò§ Not Kieran Trippier's son wanting to switch sides and walk out with Kylian Mbappe instead of his dad üòÇ pic.twitter.com/CWbhd3dkVA ‚Äî Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) October 4, 2023 ‚úÖ –ü—ñ–¥–ø–∏—Å—É–π—Ç–µ—Å—å –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—à —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≥—Ä–∞–º-–∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª, —â–æ–± –∑–∞–≤–∂–¥–∏ –±—É—Ç–∏ –≤ –∫—É—Ä—Å—ñ –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –ø–æ–¥—ñ–π –∑—ñ —Å–≤—ñ—Ç—É —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç—É!","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:17:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"champion","source_priority":1419575,"country":["ukraine"],"category":["sports"],"language":"ukrainian"},{"article_id":"b7131556494b384c52b457e8ed4a8341","title":"COLLEGE FOOTBALL FRENZY: If we had a 12-team NCAA playoff this year, who makes it?","link":"https://calgarysun.com/sports/football/if-we-had-a-12-team-ncaa-playoff-this-year-who-makes-it","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":["Todd Saelhof"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Let‚Äôs pretend it‚Äôs next year in the NCAA football world. That makes it the first year of the 12-team playoff ‚Äî quite the brave new NCAA football world. And where would we all be if we used this year‚Äôs first five weeks to fill out this new landscape? Let‚Äôs pretend we know. Call this 2023 pick ‚Äôem a trial run for breaking out the 2024 bracket. The first few for our dynamite dozen seem to be no-brainers although, if you‚Äôre like us, you‚Äôre waiting for the Texas two-step to kick in. The No. 3 Texas Longhorns (5-0) are due to lose, right? They‚Äôll drop some game, some time soon. Perhaps that comes as early as this Saturday, when the Red River Rivalry/Showdown/Shootout takes to the streets of Big D. That‚Äôs Texas versus the No. 12 Oklahoma Sooners (5-0) in Week 6 early action at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas (noon ET, ABC). Even if it isn‚Äôt this week, we like the Longhorns to boot one ‚Äî at least one at some point ‚Äî and fumble away an unbeaten season and a likely a top-four finish to catch the coveted bye in the first round of the make-believe 12-team College Football Playoff. Our feeling is the reigning two-time national champs ‚Äî the No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs (5-0) will go unbeaten again to reach the top four. The same goes for one of the two Big Ten giants ‚Äî the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines (5-0) or the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (4-0). You know we‚Äôre leaning Michigan to make that happen, mainly because Ohio State is Ohio State. Joining Georgia and Michigan in the top four, though? If the No. 10 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (5-1) run the gauntlet ‚Äî a massive challenge given they visit the No. 24 Louisville Cardinals (5-0) late Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC) and host the No. 9 USC Trojans (5-0) next week ‚Äî they deserve a top-four slot. And the other comes ‚Äî fittingly ‚Äî from the Pac-12 in its final version of itself. So much to choose from, but it comes down to the USC/No. 7 Washington Huskies (5-0) tilt in early November in SoCal. The winner ‚Äî we‚Äôll say USC with the Lincoln Riley factor ‚Äî would get our vote, unbeaten or not by season‚Äôs end. So with Georgia, Michigan, Notre Dame and USC getting the first-round byes in the 12-team playoff, how do the next eight greats shake out for our bracket? ‚Ä¢ Big 12 ‚Äî Texas and Oklahoma ‚Ä¢ ACC ‚Äî No. 5 Florida State Seminoles (5-0) ‚Ä¢ Big Ten ‚Äî Ohio State ‚Ä¢ Pac-12 ‚Äî Washington, No. 8 Oregon Ducks (5-0) ‚Ä¢ SEC ‚Äî No. 11 Alabama Crimson Tide (4-1) ‚Ä¢ Group of Five ‚Äî No. 24 Fresno State Bulldogs (5-0) Let‚Äôs give QB Drew Allar another year to push No. 6 Penn State (5-0) into the playoff. Plus, if the Big Ten‚Äôs proposed dissolution of divisions takes effect in 2024, PSU gets out from behind both Michigan and Ohio State to make hay ‚Ä¶ That Group of Five top-12 spot is interesting. Marshall (4-0) has a tough, but doable schedule to make noise, although hosting James Madison (5-0) ‚Äî the other Sun Belt unbeaten ‚Äî later this month will decide a lot. Air Force (5-0) has a flightpath to be in our make-shift 12-team bracket, too, although Mountain West rival Fresno State already has the better resum√©. Liberty (4-0) is the only other unbeaten Group of Fiver and Tulane (4-1) tops the one-loss GOF contenders ‚Ä¶ The other Power Five unbeatens? No. 14 North Carolina (4-0), No. 17 Miami (4-0), No. 20 Kentucky (5-0), No. 21 Missouri (5-0) and unranked Maryland (5-0), which could give Ohio State trouble early Saturday at The Horseshoe (noon ET, FOX). After all, QB Taulia Tagovailoa is a gamer for Maryland, with nearly 1,500 yards and 13 passing TDs to put him among the nation‚Äôs elite pivots ‚Ä¶ At the other end of the standings, the winless FBS teams ‚Äî only four ‚Äî are Virginia (0-5), UConn (0-5), Nevada (0-5) and newcomer Sam Houston (0-4). It‚Äôs only the third time in 22 editions of Red River Rivalry/Showdown/Shootout that both Texas and Oklahoma are 5-0 heading into the tilt. Should be a good one, but anything would be after last year‚Äôs 49-0 beatdown by Texas ‚Ä¶ A two-loss No. 23 LSU (3-2) does not belong in the AP Top 25. Not with 22 unbeaten teams out here and a handful of them lower than No. 25 in the rankings. Think Kentucky (5-0), which hosts No. 1 Georgia (5-0) late Saturday (7 p.m. ET) ‚Ä¶ No. 11 Alabama (4-1) best be careful against host Texas A&M (4-1) in its matinee (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS), since A&M always plays its powerhouse rival well under embattled coach Jimbo Fisher and ‚ÄôBama QB Jalen Milroe might be dealing with a hamstring injury ‚Ä¶ Is it just us or is Nebraska (2-3), which visits Illinois (2-3) on Friday (8 p.m. ET), getting further away from returning to legitimacy? Didn‚Äôt think it was just us. How about adding injury to insult where deflated No. 19 Duke (4-1) is concerned? In an effort to lead his team back late in that emotional Week 5 loss to Notre Dame, QB Riley Leonard ‚Äî a legit Heisman Trophy contender ‚Äî suffered a high-ankle sprain and is out for a few weeks ‚Ä¶ Iowa (4-1), hosting Purdue (2-3) on Saturday afternoon (3:30 p.m. ET), has suffered a big hit to its barely functioning offence with QB Cade McNamara taking a knee for the rest of the season. The transfer from Michigan is gone with a torn ACL ‚Ä¶ Colorado (3-2), which heads to Arizona State (1-4) on Saturday (6:30 p.m. ET), is without two-way star Travis Hunter for at least two more weeks with a lacerated liver. Ouch! ‚Ä¶ Disgraced coach Mel Tucker and his lawyers are still putting up a fight against Sparty, having filed a letter alleging new evidence in his case with Michigan State in the days after his dismissal by the school ‚Ä¶ One of the best additions to ESPN College GameDay is Pat McAfee‚Äôs field-goal kicking contest, as the fantastic analyst proves it‚Äôs no easy feat ‚Äî or is that feet? ‚Äî to boot a three-pointer. Plus it‚Äôs a ton of fun to watch college fans try to win thousands of dollars while taking pointers ‚Äî and getting ridiculed ‚Äî by the GameDay team. Entertaining stuff.

The boat will float less than 1,000 feet from the Eiserner Steg (Iron Footbridge) on the Main River before the Chiefs-Dolphins game at Deutsche Bank Park on November 5. All three of the Chiefs' Super Bowl titles will also be on board the vessel, which will be open to the public on Friday, November 3 and Saturday, November 4, according to Fox 4 Kansas City . Tickets will be on sale starting on Tuesday, October 17 at 7 a.m. Fans can look forward to several events on board Kansas City's yacht, including 'Their Draft Moment', which consists of holding up a Chiefs jersey like they had just made the team's roster after coming through the ranks of college football. A yacht in honor of the Chiefs called 'ChampionSHIP' will be in Frankfurt, Germany, next month Fans will get a chance to lift the Vince Lombardi Trophy given to players during Super Bowl LVII Another fun activity on the ship is called 'The Catch', which involves having your photo taken as if you're catching a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes. 'Locker Room Ready' will see fans have their own replica lockers like the players have at Arrowhead Stadium. 'Postgame Press Conference': Step up to the podium and say 'Time's yours', like Andy Reid. Frankfurt will be the third German City to host an NFL game next month after Munich & Berlin Deutsche Bank Park - home of Eintracht Frankfurt - will host Chiefs-Dolphins on November 5 Fans will also get a shot to be snapped with the Super Bowl LVII trophy that players lifted in Arizona this past February. They will get a chance to pose for pictures in front of Frankfurt's skyline too. Chiefs Hall of Fame members Christian Okoye and and Dante Hall will be on board the vessel in Hesse to hold meet-and-greet sessions with fans. Germany is the latest country to host an NFL game abroad in recent years. Previous destinations include London, Mexico City, Monterrey and Tokyo. Regular season games were held in Munich and Berlin last year.

ESPN and NBC agreed to fulfill the league's request by showing promos for Swift's movie before the start of their pregame shows this past Sunday and Monday. ESPN also played content related to Swift's movie during 'Sunday NFL Countdown' and 'Monday NFL Countdown'. NBC's free promo came on TV during its pregame show, 'Football Night in America', before cameras focused on Swift, who attended Chiefs-Jets to watch her new beau, Travis Kelce . Another Swift commercial was aired during Sunday night's game on NBC. The NFL asked TV networks to air ads for Taylor Swift‚Äôs 'Eras' Tour movie ahead of its release An ad for Swift's 'Eras' Tour movie shown on TV during the Chiefs-Jets broadcast on NBC Sources told The Post that costs for ad time was all taken care of. These 30-second commercial slots tend to come with a six-figure price tag for 'Sunday Night Football' games. Swift was spotted at MetLife Stadium with pals Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, Sunday. Shots of all four celebs were regularly shown on NBC's coverage of the game. Fox nor CBS displayed promos for Swift's movie last week. The Chiefs-Jets game wasn't aired on either channel. CBS will show Chiefs-Vikings at 4.25 p.m. on Sunday. Amazon, which has a relationship with Swift through Amazon Music, will show the Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos on the next edition of its 'Thursday Night Football' show on October 12. A day later, the 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert movie will be out in theaters. However, many TV executives are starting to wonder what is the end goal with pushing Swift-related content during football games. She is one of the biggest pop stars worldwide and is having a huge impact on TV ratings. Close to 27million viewers turned it to watch Chief-Jets on NBC, with the channel showing Swift at the game at least 17 times. Even Kelce said it was too much after the game. Even Swift's new beau, Travis Kelce, said the NFL airing the singer's content was too much The 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert movie will be out in theaters this month on October 13 The NFL's female teen audience increased by 40,000 from the previous week's Steelers-Raiders game on Sunday, September 24. TV execs are questioning if the NFL's goal with Swift is to have her perform on the Super Bowl halftime show, but Usher has already been chosen as the event's main act. Sponsorship may be another reason why the league didn't go after Swift for arguably its biggest game of each season. Swift has a deal in place with Diet Coke while the Super Bowl halftime show is mainly sponsored by Pepsi. The singer and the event do share Apple Music as a common sponsor, however. The NFL has also been heavily promoting Swift-related content to attract her fans to games. The 'You Belong With Me' hitmaker featured on the league's social handles, noting in its bios the Chiefs are '2-0 as swifties' and writing, 'NFL (Taylor Version).

Michigan State fired Tucker last month after an investigation into sexual harassment allegations involving a sexual assault awareness speaker, Brenda Tracy. Attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal sent the letter to the university's interim president, Dr. Teresa Woodruff, and the board of trustees just before an administrative hearing into the misconduct allegations against Tucker began on Thursday morning. The letter claims that Tucker's accuser \"appears to have made a career out of misleading and manipulating people.\" It also says Tracy \"manipulated a key witness\" and \"deleted key evidence\" when she filed her formal complaint against Tucker in December 2022. Tracy's attorney did not respond to a request for comment from ESPN. Tucker, 51, did not attend Thursday's hearing due to an undisclosed medical condition, according to his representatives. At stake for Tucker is the $79 million he had remaining on his contract when the school fired him on Sept. 27. The university said Tucker violated his contract's moral turpitude clause and brought ridicule upon the school with his actions, including what Tracy said was an unwanted phone sex encounter. Tucker was hired in February 2020. The Spartans (2-3, 0-2 Big Ten) have lost all three games since elevating defensive backs coach Harlon Barnett to interim head coach. --Field Level Media","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:27:49","image_url":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/b4/3b4fc70f-78a4-5daf-bf7e-bf7af480f1c3/651ef648be900.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200","source_id":"postguam","source_priority":93374,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"de2522e6a82d281f9c081133393c0dac","title":"–¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä: –ú—ñ–π —Å–∏–Ω —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏–π—Ç–∏ –∑ –ø—ñ–¥—Ç—Ä–∏–±—É–Ω–∫–∏ –∑ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, –∞ –Ω–µ –º–Ω–æ—é","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/10/05/940355/trippyer-miy-syn-khotiv-vyyty-z-pidtrybunky-z-mbappe-a-ne-mnoyu","keywords":["–§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–°–∏–Ω –∫–∞–ø—ñ—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª–∞ –ö—ñ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä–∞ –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± - –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∞–Ω–∞—Ç –ö—ñ–ª—ñ–∞–Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ.–ü—Ä–æ —Ü–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª—ñ—î—Ü—å —Ä–æ–∑–ø–æ–≤—ñ–≤ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª—É Sky Sports Premier League.\"–í—ñ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Å—Ö–∏–±–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, –ø–æ—Å—Ç—ñ–π–Ω–æ –¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –≤—ñ–¥–µ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—ñ–∑–∫–∏ –π–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –Ω–∞ —é—Ç—É–±—ñ. –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏–π—Ç–∏ –∑ –Ω–∏–º...","content":"#–ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª –Æ–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ–¥ , #–¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä –î–∂–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ - –ß–µ–º–ø—ñ–æ–Ω . –°–∏–Ω –∫–∞–ø—ñ—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ –ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª–∞ –ö—ñ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä–∞ –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± - –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∞–Ω–∞—Ç –ö—ñ–ª—ñ–∞–Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ. –ü—Ä–æ —Ü–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª—ñ—î—Ü—å —Ä–æ–∑–ø–æ–≤—ñ–≤ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª—É Sky Sports Premier League. \"–í—ñ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Å—Ö–∏–±–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, –ø–æ—Å—Ç—ñ–π–Ω–æ –¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –≤—ñ–¥–µ–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—ñ–∑–∫–∏ –π–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –Ω–∞ —é—Ç—É–±—ñ. –î–∂–µ–π–∫–æ–± —Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏–π—Ç–∏ –∑ –Ω–∏–º, –∞ –Ω–µ –º–Ω–æ—é! –Ø —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤ —Å–∏–Ω–æ–≤—ñ: \"–Ø–∫—â–æ –≤–∏–π–¥–µ—à –∑ –ú–±–∞–ø–ø–µ, —Ç–æ –Ω–∞–≤—ñ—Ç—å –Ω–µ –¥–∏–≤–∏—Å—è –Ω–∞ –º–µ–Ω–µ –≤ –ø—ñ–¥—Ç—Ä–∏–±—É–Ω—Ü—ñ\". –ù—å—é–∫–∞—Å–ª - –ü–°–ñ 4:1: –æ–≥–ª—è–¥ –º–∞—Ç—á—É –Ø –≤–∂–µ –≥—Ä–∞–≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –ö—ñ–ª—ñ–∞–Ω–∞ - —Ç–æ –±—É–≤ –π–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–±—é—Ç–Ω–∏–π –º–∞—Ç—á –∑–∞ –ú–æ–Ω–∞–∫–æ, –∫–æ–ª–∏ —è –≤–∏—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–≤ –∑–∞ –¢–æ—Ç—Ç–µ–Ω–≥–µ–º. –¢–∞–∫–æ–∂ —è –≥—Ä–∞–≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω—å–æ–≥–æ —É —Å–≤–æ—î–º—É –¥–µ–±—é—Ç–Ω–æ–º—É –º–∞—Ç—á—ñ –∑–∞ –∑–±—ñ—Ä–Ω—É –ê–Ω–≥–ª—ñ—ó\", - —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤ –¢—Ä—ñ–ø–ø'—î—Ä. \"I said to him if you get to walk out with him, don't look at me in the tunnel!\" üò§ Not Kieran Trippier's son wanting to switch sides and walk out with Kylian Mbappe instead of his dad üòÇ pic.twitter.com/CWbhd3dkVA ‚Äî Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) October 4, 2023 ‚úÖ –ü—ñ–¥–ø–∏—Å—É–π—Ç–µ—Å—å –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—à —Ç–µ–ª–µ–≥—Ä–∞–º-–∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª, —â–æ–± –∑–∞–≤–∂–¥–∏ –±—É—Ç–∏ –≤ –∫—É—Ä—Å—ñ –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏—Ö –ø–æ–¥—ñ–π –∑—ñ —Å–≤—ñ—Ç—É —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç—É!","pubDate":"2023-10-05 17:17:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"champion","source_priority":1419575,"country":["ukraine"],"category":["sports"],"language":"ukrainian"},{"article_id":"b7131556494b384c52b457e8ed4a8341","title":"COLLEGE FOOTBALL FRENZY: If we had a 12-team NCAA playoff this year, who makes it?","link":"https://calgarysun.com/sports/football/if-we-had-a-12-team-ncaa-playoff-this-year-who-makes-it","keywords":["Football","Sports"],"creator":["Todd Saelhof"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Let‚Äôs pretend it‚Äôs next year in the NCAA football world. That makes it the first year of the 12-team playoff ‚Äî quite the brave new NCAA football world. And where would we all be if we used this year‚Äôs first five weeks to fill out this new landscape? Let‚Äôs pretend we know. Call this 2023 pick ‚Äôem a trial run for breaking out the 2024 bracket. The first few for our dynamite dozen seem to be no-brainers although, if you‚Äôre like us, you‚Äôre waiting for the Texas two-step to kick in. The No. 3 Texas Longhorns (5-0) are due to lose, right? They‚Äôll drop some game, some time soon. Perhaps that comes as early as this Saturday, when the Red River Rivalry/Showdown/Shootout takes to the streets of Big D. That‚Äôs Texas versus the No. 12 Oklahoma Sooners (5-0) in Week 6 early action at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas (noon ET, ABC). Even if it isn‚Äôt this week, we like the Longhorns to boot one ‚Äî at least one at some point ‚Äî and fumble away an unbeaten season and a likely a top-four finish to catch the coveted bye in the first round of the make-believe 12-team College Football Playoff. Our feeling is the reigning two-time national champs ‚Äî the No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs (5-0) will go unbeaten again to reach the top four. The same goes for one of the two Big Ten giants ‚Äî the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines (5-0) or the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (4-0). You know we‚Äôre leaning Michigan to make that happen, mainly because Ohio State is Ohio State. Joining Georgia and Michigan in the top four, though? If the No. 10 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (5-1) run the gauntlet ‚Äî a massive challenge given they visit the No. 24 Louisville Cardinals (5-0) late Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC) and host the No. 9 USC Trojans (5-0) next week ‚Äî they deserve a top-four slot. And the other comes ‚Äî fittingly ‚Äî from the Pac-12 in its final version of itself. So much to choose from, but it comes down to the USC/No. 7 Washington Huskies (5-0) tilt in early November in SoCal. The winner ‚Äî we‚Äôll say USC with the Lincoln Riley factor ‚Äî would get our vote, unbeaten or not by season‚Äôs end. So with Georgia, Michigan, Notre Dame and USC getting the first-round byes in the 12-team playoff, how do the next eight greats shake out for our bracket? ‚Ä¢ Big 12 ‚Äî Texas and Oklahoma ‚Ä¢ ACC ‚Äî No. 5 Florida State Seminoles (5-0) ‚Ä¢ Big Ten ‚Äî Ohio State ‚Ä¢ Pac-12 ‚Äî Washington, No. 8 Oregon Ducks (5-0) ‚Ä¢ SEC ‚Äî No. 11 Alabama Crimson Tide (4-1) ‚Ä¢ Group of Five ‚Äî No. 24 Fresno State Bulldogs (5-0) Let‚Äôs give QB Drew Allar another year to push No. 6 Penn State (5-0) into the playoff. Plus, if the Big Ten‚Äôs proposed dissolution of divisions takes effect in 2024, PSU gets out from behind both Michigan and Ohio State to make hay ‚Ä¶ That Group of Five top-12 spot is interesting. Marshall (4-0) has a tough, but doable schedule to make noise, although hosting James Madison (5-0) ‚Äî the other Sun Belt unbeaten ‚Äî later this month will decide a lot. Air Force (5-0) has a flightpath to be in our make-shift 12-team bracket, too, although Mountain West rival Fresno State already has the better resum√©. Liberty (4-0) is the only other unbeaten Group of Fiver and Tulane (4-1) tops the one-loss GOF contenders ‚Ä¶ The other Power Five unbeatens? No. 14 North Carolina (4-0), No. 17 Miami (4-0), No. 20 Kentucky (5-0), No. 21 Missouri (5-0) and unranked Maryland (5-0), which could give Ohio State trouble early Saturday at The Horseshoe (noon ET, FOX). After all, QB Taulia Tagovailoa is a gamer for Maryland, with nearly 1,500 yards and 13 passing TDs to put him among the nation‚Äôs elite pivots ‚Ä¶ At the other end of the standings, the winless FBS teams ‚Äî only four ‚Äî are Virginia (0-5), UConn (0-5), Nevada (0-5) and newcomer Sam Houston (0-4). It‚Äôs only the third time in 22 editions of Red River Rivalry/Showdown/Shootout that both Texas and Oklahoma are 5-0 heading into the tilt. Should be a good one, but anything would be after last year‚Äôs 49-0 beatdown by Texas ‚Ä¶ A two-loss No. 23 LSU (3-2) does not belong in the AP Top 25. Not with 22 unbeaten teams out here and a handful of them lower than No. 25 in the rankings. Think Kentucky (5-0), which hosts No. 1 Georgia (5-0) late Saturday (7 p.m. ET) ‚Ä¶ No. 11 Alabama (4-1) best be careful against host Texas A&M (4-1) in its matinee (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS), since A&M always plays its powerhouse rival well under embattled coach Jimbo Fisher and ‚ÄôBama QB Jalen Milroe might be dealing with a hamstring injury ‚Ä¶ Is it just us or is Nebraska (2-3), which visits Illinois (2-3) on Friday (8 p.m. ET), getting further away from returning to legitimacy? Didn‚Äôt think it was just us. How about adding injury to insult where deflated No. 19 Duke (4-1) is concerned? In an effort to lead his team back late in that emotional Week 5 loss to Notre Dame, QB Riley Leonard ‚Äî a legit Heisman Trophy contender ‚Äî suffered a high-ankle sprain and is out for a few weeks ‚Ä¶ Iowa (4-1), hosting Purdue (2-3) on Saturday afternoon (3:30 p.m. ET), has suffered a big hit to its barely functioning offence with QB Cade McNamara taking a knee for the rest of the season. The transfer from Michigan is gone with a torn ACL ‚Ä¶ Colorado (3-2), which heads to Arizona State (1-4) on Saturday (6:30 p.m. ET), is without two-way star Travis Hunter for at least two more weeks with a lacerated liver. Ouch! ‚Ä¶ Disgraced coach Mel Tucker and his lawyers are still putting up a fight against Sparty, having filed a letter alleging new evidence in his case with Michigan State in the days after his dismissal by the school ‚Ä¶ One of the best additions to ESPN College GameDay is Pat McAfee‚Äôs field-goal kicking contest, as the fantastic analyst proves it‚Äôs no easy feat ‚Äî or is that feet? ‚Äî to boot a three-pointer. Plus it‚Äôs a ton of fun to watch college fans try to win thousands of dollars while taking pointers ‚Äî and getting ridiculed ‚Äî by the GameDay team. Entertaining stuff.

ESPN and NBC agreed to fulfill the league's request by showing promos for Swift's movie before the start of their pregame shows this past Sunday and Monday. ESPN also played content related to Swift's movie during 'Sunday NFL Countdown' and 'Monday NFL Countdown'. NBC's free promo came on TV during its pregame show, 'Football Night in America', before cameras focused on Swift, who attended Chiefs-Jets to watch her new beau, Travis Kelce . Another Swift commercial was aired during Sunday night's game on NBC. The NFL asked TV networks to air ads for Taylor Swift‚Äôs 'Eras' Tour movie ahead of its release An ad for Swift's 'Eras' Tour movie shown on TV during the Chiefs-Jets broadcast on NBC Sources told The Post that costs for ad time was all taken care of. These 30-second commercial slots tend to come with a six-figure price tag for 'Sunday Night Football' games. Swift was spotted at MetLife Stadium with pals Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, Sunday. Shots of all four celebs were regularly shown on NBC's coverage of the game. Fox nor CBS displayed promos for Swift's movie last week. The Chiefs-Jets game wasn't aired on either channel. CBS will show Chiefs-Vikings at 4.25 p.m. on Sunday. Amazon, which has a relationship with Swift through Amazon Music, will show the Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos on the next edition of its 'Thursday Night Football' show on October 12. A day later, the 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert movie will be out in theaters. However, many TV executives are starting to wonder what is the end goal with pushing Swift-related content during football games. She is one of the biggest pop stars worldwide and is having a huge impact on TV ratings. Close to 27million viewers turned it to watch Chief-Jets on NBC, with the channel showing Swift at the game at least 17 times. Even Kelce said it was too much after the game. Even Swift's new beau, Travis Kelce, said the NFL airing the singer's content was too much The 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert movie will be out in theaters this month on October 13 The NFL's female teen audience increased by 40,000 from the previous week's Steelers-Raiders game on Sunday, September 24. TV execs are questioning if the NFL's goal with Swift is to have her perform on the Super Bowl halftime show, but Usher has already been chosen as the event's main act. Sponsorship may be another reason why the league didn't go after Swift for arguably its biggest game of each season. Swift has a deal in place with Diet Coke while the Super Bowl halftime show is mainly sponsored by Pepsi. The singer and the event do share Apple Music as a common sponsor, however. The NFL has also been heavily promoting Swift-related content to attract her fans to games. The 'You Belong With Me' hitmaker featured on the league's social handles, noting in its bios the Chiefs are '2-0 as swifties' and writing, 'NFL (Taylor Version).

Michigan State fired Tucker last month after an investigation into sexual harassment allegations involving a sexual assault awareness speaker, Brenda Tracy. Attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal sent the letter to the university's interim president, Dr. Teresa Woodruff, and the board of trustees just before an administrative hearing into the misconduct allegations against Tucker began on Thursday morning. The letter claims that Tucker's accuser \"appears to have made a career out of misleading and manipulating people.\" It also says Tracy \"manipulated a key witness\" and \"deleted key evidence\" when she filed her formal complaint against Tucker in December 2022. Tracy's attorney did not respond to a request for comment from ESPN. Tucker, 51, did not attend Thursday's hearing due to an undisclosed medical condition, according to his representatives. At stake for Tucker is the $79 million he had remaining on his contract when the school fired him on Sept. 27. The university said Tucker violated his contract's moral turpitude clause and brought ridicule upon the school with his actions, including what Tracy said was an unwanted phone sex encounter. Tucker was hired in February 2020.

That makes it the first year of the 12-team playoff ‚Äî quite the brave new NCAA football world. And where would we all be if we used this year‚Äôs first five weeks to fill out this new landscape? Let‚Äôs pretend we know. Call this 2023 pick ‚Äôem a trial run for breaking out the 2024 bracket. The first few for our dynamite dozen seem to be no-brainers although, if you‚Äôre like us, you‚Äôre waiting for the Texas two-step to kick in. The No. 3 Texas Longhorns (5-0) are due to lose, right? They‚Äôll drop some game, some time soon. Perhaps that comes as early as this Saturday, when the Red River Rivalry/Showdown/Shootout takes to the streets of Big D. That‚Äôs Texas versus the No. 12 Oklahoma Sooners (5-0) in Week 6 early action at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas (noon ET, ABC). Even if it isn‚Äôt this week, we like the Longhorns to boot one ‚Äî at least one at some point ‚Äî and fumble away an unbeaten season and a likely a top-four finish to catch the coveted bye in the first round of the make-believe 12-team College Football Playoff. Our feeling is the reigning two-time national champs ‚Äî the No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs (5-0) will go unbeaten again to reach the top four. The same goes for one of the two Big Ten giants ‚Äî the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines (5-0) or the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (4-0). You know we‚Äôre leaning Michigan to make that happen, mainly because Ohio State is Ohio State. Joining Georgia and Michigan in the top four, though? If the No. 10 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (5-1) run the gauntlet ‚Äî a massive challenge given they visit the No. 24 Louisville Cardinals (5-0) late Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC) and host the No. 9 USC Trojans (5-0) next week ‚Äî they deserve a top-four slot. And the other comes ‚Äî fittingly ‚Äî from the Pac-12 in its final version of itself. So much to choose from, but it comes down to the USC/No. 7 Washington Huskies (5-0) tilt in early November in SoCal. The winner ‚Äî we‚Äôll say USC with the Lincoln Riley factor ‚Äî would get our vote, unbeaten or not by season‚Äôs end. So with Georgia, Michigan, Notre Dame and USC getting the first-round byes in the 12-team playoff, how do the next eight greats shake out for our bracket? ‚Ä¢ Big 12 ‚Äî Texas and Oklahoma ‚Ä¢ ACC ‚Äî No. 5 Florida State Seminoles (5-0) ‚Ä¢ Big Ten ‚Äî Ohio State ‚Ä¢ Pac-12 ‚Äî Washington, No. 8 Oregon Ducks (5-0) ‚Ä¢ SEC ‚Äî No. 11 Alabama Crimson Tide (4-1) ‚Ä¢ Group of Five ‚Äî No. 24 Fresno State Bulldogs (5-0) Let‚Äôs give QB Drew Allar another year to push No. 6 Penn State (5-0) into the playoff. Plus, if the Big Ten‚Äôs proposed dissolution of divisions takes effect in 2024, PSU gets out from behind both Michigan and Ohio State to make hay ‚Ä¶ That Group of Five top-12 spot is interesting. Marshall (4-0) has a tough, but doable schedule to make noise, although hosting James Madison (5-0) ‚Äî the other Sun Belt unbeaten ‚Äî later this month will decide a lot. Air Force (5-0) has a flightpath to be in our make-shift 12-team bracket, too, although Mountain West rival Fresno State already has the better resum√©. Liberty (4-0) is the only other unbeaten Group of Fiver and Tulane (4-1) tops the one-loss GOF contenders ‚Ä¶ The other Power Five unbeatens? No. 14 North Carolina (4-0), No. 17 Miami (4-0), No. 20 Kentucky (5-0), No. 21 Missouri (5-0) and unranked Maryland (5-0), which could give Ohio State trouble early Saturday at The Horseshoe (noon ET, FOX). After all, QB Taulia Tagovailoa is a gamer for Maryland, with nearly 1,500 yards and 13 passing TDs to put him among the nation‚Äôs elite pivots ‚Ä¶ At the other end of the standings, the winless FBS teams ‚Äî only four ‚Äî are Virginia (0-5), UConn (0-5), Nevada (0-5) and newcomer Sam Houston (0-4). It‚Äôs only the third time in 22 editions of Red River Rivalry/Showdown/Shootout that both Texas and Oklahoma are 5-0 heading into the tilt. Should be a good one, but anything would be after last year‚Äôs 49-0 beatdown by Texas ‚Ä¶ A two-loss No. 23 LSU (3-2) does not belong in the AP Top 25. Not with 22 unbeaten teams out here and a handful of them lower than No. 25 in the rankings. Think Kentucky (5-0), which hosts No. 1 Georgia (5-0) late Saturday (7 p.m. ET) ‚Ä¶ No. 11 Alabama (4-1) best be careful against host Texas A&M (4-1) in its matinee (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS), since A&M always plays its powerhouse rival well under embattled coach Jimbo Fisher and ‚ÄôBama QB Jalen Milroe might be dealing with a hamstring injury ‚Ä¶ Is it just us or is Nebraska (2-3), which visits Illinois (2-3) on Friday (8 p.m. ET), getting further away from returning to legitimacy? Didn‚Äôt think it was just us. How about adding injury to insult where deflated No. 19 Duke (4-1) is concerned? In an effort to lead his team back late in that emotional Week 5 loss to Notre Dame, QB Riley Leonard ‚Äî a legit Heisman Trophy contender ‚Äî suffered a high-ankle sprain and is out for a few weeks ‚Ä¶ Iowa (4-1), hosting Purdue (2-3) on Saturday afternoon (3:30 p.m. ET), has suffered a big hit to its barely functioning offence with QB Cade McNamara taking a knee for the rest of the season. The transfer from Michigan is gone with a torn ACL ‚Ä¶ Colorado (3-2), which heads to Arizona State (1-4) on Saturday (6:30 p.m. ET), is without two-way star Travis Hunter for at least two more weeks with a lacerated liver. Ouch! ‚Ä¶ Disgraced coach Mel Tucker and his lawyers are still putting up a fight against Sparty, having filed a letter alleging new evidence in his case with Michigan State in the days after his dismissal by the school ‚Ä¶ One of the best additions to ESPN College GameDay is Pat McAfee‚Äôs field-goal kicking contest, as the fantastic analyst proves it‚Äôs no easy feat ‚Äî or is that feet? ‚Äî to boot a three-pointer. Plus it‚Äôs a ton of fun to watch college fans try to win thousands of dollars while taking pointers ‚Äî and getting ridiculed ‚Äî by the GameDay team. Entertaining stuff.

The boat will float less than 1,000 feet from the Eiserner Steg (Iron Footbridge) on the Main River before the Chiefs-Dolphins game at Deutsche Bank Park on November 5. All three of the Chiefs' Super Bowl titles will also be on board the vessel, which will be open to the public on Friday, November 3 and Saturday, November 4, according to Fox 4 Kansas City . Tickets will be on sale starting on Tuesday, October 17 at 7 a.m. Fans can look forward to several events on board Kansas City's yacht, including 'Their Draft Moment', which consists of holding up a Chiefs jersey like they had just made the team's roster after coming through the ranks of college football. A yacht in honor of the Chiefs called 'ChampionSHIP' will be in Frankfurt, Germany, next month Fans will get a chance to lift the Vince Lombardi Trophy given to players during Super Bowl LVII Another fun activity on the ship is called 'The Catch', which involves having your photo taken as if you're catching a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes. 'Locker Room Ready' will see fans have their own replica lockers like the players have at Arrowhead Stadium. 'Postgame Press Conference': Step up to the podium and say 'Time's yours', like Andy Reid. Frankfurt will be the third German City to host an NFL game next month after Munich & Berlin Deutsche Bank Park - home of Eintracht Frankfurt - will host Chiefs-Dolphins on November 5 Fans will also get a shot to be snapped with the Super Bowl LVII trophy that players lifted in Arizona this past February.

ESPN and NBC agreed to fulfill the league's request by showing promos for Swift's movie before the start of their pregame shows this past Sunday and Monday. ESPN also played content related to Swift's movie during 'Sunday NFL Countdown' and 'Monday NFL Countdown'. NBC's free promo came on TV during its pregame show, 'Football Night in America', before cameras focused on Swift, who attended Chiefs-Jets to watch her new beau, Travis Kelce . Another Swift commercial was aired during Sunday night's game on NBC. The NFL asked TV networks to air ads for Taylor Swift‚Äôs 'Eras' Tour movie ahead of its release An ad for Swift's 'Eras' Tour movie shown on TV during the Chiefs-Jets broadcast on NBC Sources told The Post that costs for ad time was all taken care of. These 30-second commercial slots tend to come with a six-figure price tag for 'Sunday Night Football' games. Swift was spotted at MetLife Stadium with pals Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, Sunday. Shots of all four celebs were regularly shown on NBC's coverage of the game. Fox nor CBS displayed promos for Swift's movie last week. The Chiefs-Jets game wasn't aired on either channel. CBS will show Chiefs-Vikings at 4.25 p.m. on Sunday. Amazon, which has a relationship with Swift through Amazon Music, will show the Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos on the next edition of its 'Thursday Night Football' show on October 12. A day later, the 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert movie will be out in theaters. However, many TV executives are starting to wonder what is the end goal with pushing Swift-related content during football games. She is one of the biggest pop stars worldwide and is having a huge impact on TV ratings. Close to 27million viewers turned it to watch Chief-Jets on NBC, with the channel showing Swift at the game at least 17 times. Even Kelce said it was too much after the game. Even Swift's new beau, Travis Kelce, said the NFL airing the singer's content was too much The 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert movie will be out in theaters this month on October 13 The NFL's female teen audience increased by 40,000 from the previous week's Steelers-Raiders game on Sunday, September 24. TV execs are questioning if the NFL's goal with Swift is to have her perform on the Super Bowl halftime show, but Usher has already been chosen as the event's main act. Sponsorship may be another reason why the league didn't go after Swift for arguably its biggest game of each season.
