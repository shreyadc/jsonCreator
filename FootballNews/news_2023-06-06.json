Зазначається, що Асенсіо вже підписав із парижанами контракт до 2027 року. Причому дістанеться він новому клубу абсолютно безкоштовно, оскільки діючий контракт футболіста з Реалом закінчується влітку цього року. Зазначимо, що у минулому сезоні півзахисник провів за Реал 31 матч у чемпіонаті Іспанії, в яких забив 9 голів. Раніше повідомлялося, що батько Мессі розповів, де хоче продовжити кар'єру Лео.

He will also arrive amid plenty of trepidation from even some of the more optimistic supporters given he is a relative unknown quantity when it comes to the league. Stream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > How Ange will perform for 'biggest test' | 07:17 Sound familiar? The former Socceroos coach has all but officially been announced as Tottenham Hotspur’s new boss and he enters a situation eerily similar to the one he found when he arrived at Celtic. Postecoglou, who was with Yokohama F. Marinos at the time, was announced as the Scottish giants’ new boss in July 2021 to little acclaim. After all, Celtic had pinned their hopes on former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe to take over from Neil Lennon, only for the former to turn down the gig and leave the Hoops in a state of flux. Once news broke of Postecoglou’s imminent arrival, it sparked a wave of confusion from pundits with no reaction more infamous than that of 13-time Scotland international Alan Brazil. The Scot quipped on talkSPORT at the time: “Celtic have applied for exemption with UEFA for Yokohama Marinos boss, what is it, Postecooglou? (sic), to manage in Europe. “He does not hold the required licence – oh, this has got to be a wind-up.” Asked how he’d fare, Brazil sarcastically replied: “Oh, he’d be a great manager. Where do they come up with these guys from?” A domestic treble in the 2022/23 season, five trophies and a return to the Champions League proved Brazil and all of the other doubters so very, very wrong. Now, Postecoglou must do all of that again: galvanise the fractured fan base, rebuild the squad and deliver success to a club which pays its cleaners overtime to hide the dust on its trophy cabinet. But this time, it’s not in the small pond that is the Scottish Premiership, it’s in the Pacific Ocean that is the Premier League. Ange & Fozzie bury the hatchet | 01:01 MORE COVERAGE UK View: ‘Top class’ Ange ‘not just an Australian Ted Lasso’ but ‘shark-infested waters’ loom Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as massive player clean-out plan revealed Rumour Mill: Euro giants lead Kane chase; Man Utd eye ‘next Haaland’ as $81m plan B RUTHLESS TWO-YEAR GLASWEGIAN CULL PROVIDES BIG ANGE CLUE Where Postecoglou goes, a swashbuckling and fast-paced brand of attacking football follows. But to implement his trademark style of play, it requires a certain type of player. When it came to the summer window in 2021, Postecoglou wasted little time in bringing through his transfer targets but, like his own appointment, they arrived with scepticism. After all, what would Kyogo Furuhashi, who arrived from Vissel Kobe in the J1 League, offer that Celtic couldn’t find elsewhere in Europe? Yet Furuhashi and almost all of Postecoglou’s other signings proved the doubters wrong as they endeared themselves to the Celtic faithful with endless running and passionate displays. To highlight Postecoglou’s eye for a deal and how big of a squad overhaul he enacted, he spent just $AUD42 million ( per Transfermarkt ) on signings throughout the 2021/22 season across 17 players. But his spending was aided by selling three key assets in Odsonne Edouard, Kristoffer Ajer and Ryan Christie as Celtic recouped $60 million in outgoing transfer fees, representing an $18 million profit. Postecoglou again dipped into the transfer market ahead of the 2022/23 season where he turned Jota and Cameron Carter-Vickers, who were on loan in Postecoglou’s first Celtic campaign, into permanent signings. What's Ange's Tottenham to-do list? | 05:26 So too was all-action winger Daizen Maeda, who joined from Yokohama F. Marinos while Socceroos star Aaron Mooy was snapped up on a free deal. With a Champions League campaign on the horizon, there wasn’t a great need for a Celtic clear-out in Postecoglou’s second season with the main exits coming via Josip Juranovic and Georgios Giakoumakis, who both arrived only a season earlier. Although Celtic made a net loss of $27 million, the money made from playing Champions League football softened the financial blow and kept the club in a healthy state. In Postecoglou’s final game as Celtic boss, the starting lineup had just two players who were at the club prior to his arrival: captain Callum McGregor and left-back Greg Taylor. Even for the Hoops’ first Champions League match against Real Madrid this season, McGregor and Taylor were the only ones from the pre-Postecoglou era who started. What that proves is Postecoglou is ruthless when it comes to overhauling teams to fit his mould, but there is also a place for those willing to learn and adapt under his tutelage. It’s a skill he will undoubtedly need to call on once the moment he gets his feet under the desk at Tottenham. Spurs reach 'verbal agreement' with Ange | 01:23 THE SILVER LININGS IN SPURS’ $863M MESS As it stands, Tottenham have one of the older squads in the Premier League, especially when it came to last season’s starting lineup. Hugo Lloris, the club’s captain and first-choice goalkeeper, is 36. Backup goalkeeper Fraser Foster is 35. Ivan Perisic is 34, Heung-Min Son and Ben Davies are 30 while Eric Dier and Harry Kane are both 29. Worryingly, all of these players — especially Kane — were relied on far too heavily throughout the season. As for Tottenham’s record in the transfer market over recent years, it has been patchy at best. Since the summer of 2019, the London club has spent a staggering $863 million on new players. French midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, a $100m arrival in that first window, was the most expensive of the lot with Richarlison’s $93 million transfer in July last year not far behind. But Ndombele has only showed glimpses of his ability since his record-breaking move while Richarlison received more yellow cards for celebrating his goals than he actually scored in the Premier League. In that same time span, the club has brought in $150 million in transfer and loan fees. Granted, that is not necessarily down to the manager and perhaps speaks more to chairman Daniel Levy’s inability to move on players deemed as surplus to requirements. But some players who have joined the club in that time have had minuscule impact, underpinning the club’s poor transfer dealings. Richarlison has struggled to justify his price tag. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Bryan Gil, signed in 2021, has more chance of being in a Beatles tribute band than playing for Spurs again after being farmed out on loan twice since his arrival. The Telegraph claims Postecoglou will be given the freedom to conduct a clear-out of his own, with as many as seven first-team players set to be kicked out the exit door. The report claims Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon should seek pastures new, while the club could be open to bids for defensive duo Ben Davies and Eric Dier. Harry Winks, Sergio Reguilon and Giovani Lo Celso, who all spent last season out on loan at different clubs, could also be shafted to help Postecoglou trim the fat from the squad. Lloris has also gone on the record stating he isn’t quite sure what the future holds as he reportedly has a tempting offer on the table from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club. There’s also the curious case of what to do with record signing Ndombele. The French midfielder made 30 appearances for Napoli as they went on to win Serie A this season, but 22 of those came from the bench. Whether Postecoglou views him as a diamond which needs refining or damaged goods remains to be seen, but if he is to be sold, his value has certainly decreased since his record-breaking arrival. Safe to say the former Socceroos boss will have his hands full when it comes to culling players. But there’s still one very important piece to the puzzle in North London that Postecoglou might not even have a say on. Spurs fans have suffered in recent years. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images THE BIG KANE CONUNDRUM THAT COULD SHAPE ANGE’S SEASON He’s the club’s all-time top goalscorer. He’s their attacking talisman who bagged 30 goals in a season where Tottenham secured their lowest finish in 14 years. He is, quite essentially, Tottenham Hotspur. And he could become the club’s biggest problem this summer. Harry Kane has spent virtually his entire career at Tottenham and become one of the most lethal strikers in world football. But for all of the goals he’s scored in the famous white shirt — 280 goals to be exact — he has no team silverware to show for it. Kane will turn 30 on July 28 and although players are able to prolong their careers more than ever thanks to modern science, he isn’t getting any younger. So, why is Kane such a hot topic for Spurs? Well, he has just one year remaining on his current deal. It presents Levy with an almighty conundrum: does he decide to cash in on his most prized asset now, or does he hold on to him for one more season but run the risk of letting him walk for free this time next year? Kane won’t be short on potential suitors, with Manchester United a team constantly linked with the England skipper. There’s also heavy interest from Real Madrid, who are in the hunt for a superstar striker after Karim Benzema departed the club and have the funds to pull off such a deal. Transfermarkt values Kane at $145 million , but Levy will no doubt look to squeeze more from interested parties if the need arises. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is deeply unpopular with fans. (Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP) Source: AFP Levy is known in football circles as a tough negotiator at the best of times, but what about at his worst? Allow legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to indulge, as he dealt with Levy in an ultimately successful pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov in 2008. “That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement,” Ferguson famously quipped. There’s no doubt the question would have been one of many Postecoglou asked Levy before taking on the role and the soon-to-be former Hoops boss will have prepared for either scenario. If Kane stays, Postecoglou will have the chance to work with one of the best strikers in world football for at least one season. Who knows, perhaps the 29-year-old could become so enamoured with Postecoglou’s style of play he decides to hang around in North London a little while longer, pending Spurs’ success under the Aussie boss. But if Kane is moved on, it would give Postecoglou significant funds to work with as he plots a rebuild of the club. In some respects, it might even buy him more patience from the club’s powerbrokers and fans knowing they no longer have their record goalscorer in their ranks. Either way, Postecoglou will be prepared. Kane’s future is going to be a topic of hot discussion throughout the summer. (Photo by Oli SCARFF / AFP) Source: AFP After a spectacularly poor season in which they had three different faces in the dugout and missed out on European football for the first time in 13 years, things can’t get much worse at Tottenham. Add in the pressing need for a squad refresh and the prospect of losing Kane, it’s not quite a free hit for Postecoglou but it’s a golden chance to prove the football world wrong. Just like he has done at every stage of his career from Brisbane all the way to Glasgow. Of course, expectations will be high at Tottenham. They have a world-class stadium and a squad that, albeit its many flaws, is one many teams in Europe would crave. If Postecoglou starts slowly, you best believe the claws of the ruthless English media will sharpen by the minute and fans will make their feelings heard in the stadium, pubs and social media. But that’s just the perfect storm for Postecoglou to thrive in, just like it was in Glasgow two years ago.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 06:41:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ten-year-old schoolgirl scores incredible 143 goals for her football team in a single season","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ten-year-old-schoolgirl-scores-27052519","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (John Jones)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Amelia Morris is a talented football player but is also a four-time gold medallist in another sport","content":"A 10-year-old schoolgirl has put the likes of Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Paul Mullin to shame with an astonishing goal-scoring record that has seen her net 143 times in a single season. Amelia Morris unsurprisingly finished as top scorer for her team, Gurnos FC in Merthyr Tydfil, this season and even had to be taken off midway through most games she played to give other teams a chance, such was her prowess in front of goal. Incredibly, her sporting talents don't stop there, as she is also a four-time gold medallist in kickboxing, having started out at the age of five before going on to represent Wales at the World Championships. READ MORE: Being Rocco, Wales' smallest superfan whose adorable videos made him an overnight celebrity According to her proud dad (and coach) Jamie, Amelia started kickboxing when she was just five years old before taking up football a few years later. \"Ever since she was born she's always had a ball in her hand or kicking it,\" he said. \"But on the Gurnos we didn't have any football teams for girls of that age, so she was about eight when she started. \"Amelia's been playing for the under-10s this season. We've played all over south Wales and beaten pretty much every team and she's just been incredible. At the start, she was averaging about 10 goals every weekend, but we had to bring her off halfway through the games because it was too easy for us. \"At that age you want everyone to be having fun more than anything and it's not that fun if you're getting beaten by a lot - so we had to go easy on them by giving her a bit of a break! If we hadn't taken her off she would have been on even more goals by the end of the season.\" Amelia only took up football a few years ago but is already an accomplished goal scorer (Image: Jamie Morris) Amelia after scoring her 100th goal of the season (Image: Jamie Morris) She also won four gold medals at the World Kickboxing Championships in Cardiff last year (Image: Jamie Morris) Amelia's fine form in front of goal has already been rewarded with a place in the South Wales Development Squad, who she played for last season, while she has now been invited to go on trial for Caerphilly Schools later this month. And the multi-talented youngster - who idolises Welsh boxer and former Wales footballer Lauren Price - is just as prolific when it comes to kickboxing, having won four gold medals at last year's World Kickboxing and Karate Union (WKU) World Championships, which were held in Cardiff for the first time. \"Amelia had her first fight in a ring about two years ago,\" said Jamie. \"And then her coach put her forward for the World Championships, as Wales wanted to have a big squad as the home nation. She was fighting at under-25kg but the nearest competition class to that in Wales is under-40kg, so she was smaller than everyone but it didn't faze her and she went in there and did really, really well.\" \"We're all so proud of her,\" he added. \"She's only young but is doing so well. The Gurnos doesn't get the best publicity so it's great for Amelia to get the recognition she has got for her achievements and hopefully she will inspire other kids from around here too.\" READ NEXT: The inside story of Cardiff City's manager hunt and why they went for Erol Bulut Meet the 90-year-old oldest goalkeeper in the world with a pacemaker and hip replacements The Turkish view of what to expect from Cardiff City's Erol Bulut Ben Foster estimates how much Wrexham's lavish Vegas bash cost Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney Historic Welsh club and neighbours of boom side Wrexham in turmoil as entire playing squad walk out","pubDate":"2023-06-06 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27062295.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Screenshot_20230601-173700_WhatsApp.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ex-India Star's Son 'Super Happy' After Meeting Dhoni.

Trong vai trò Giám đốc Kỹ thuật, Maldini cùng Giám đốc Thể thao Massara được đánh giá cao khi mua về nhiều cầu thủ trẻ chất lượng cao với giá rẻ, rồi tăng đáng kể giá trị sau một thời gian cống hiến CLB. Số này gồm thủ môn Maignan (được mua về với giá 14,5 triệu USD - hiện được định giá 65 triệu), trung vệ Tomori (31 triệu - 53 triệu), tiền vệ Tonali (18 triệu - 53 triệu), hậu vệ Theo Hernandez (22 triệu - 76 triệu), tiền đạo Leao (28 triệu - 100 triệu), tiền vệ Bennacer (18 triệu - 53 triệu). Các cựu binh giá rẻ mà Maldini - Massara đưa về như trung vệ Simon Kjaer hay tiền đạo Olivier Giroud cũng đều đóng góp lớn cho đội bóng. Những cầu thủ này đều là trụ cột của Milan vô địch Serie A 2021-2022 và vào đến bán kết Champions League mùa vừa qua. Theo Football Italy , Igli Tare - người vừa thông báo không gia hạn hợp đồng làm Giám đốc Thể thao Lazio - là ứng viên thay Maldini. Nhưng không loại trừ khả năng Giám đốc điều hành Furlani sẽ đảm nhận thêm vai trò của Maldini để kiểm soát thêm hướng đi cho tương lai của CLB, còn trưởng bộ phận tuyển trạch Geoffrey Moncada được thăng chức lên Giám đốc Thể thao thay Massara. Mùa này, Milan bị loại từ vòng 1/8 Cup Italy, thua CLB cùng thành phố Inter tại bán kết Champions League và trận tranh Siêu Cup Italy. Đoàn quân dưới trướng Stefano Pioli may mắn cán đích trong top 4 Serie A nhờ việc Juventus bị trừ 10 điểm.

It represents a whirlwind few weeks from when the news of Tottenham’s strong interest in Postecoglou was initially revealed to now where it is all but official. The Spurs job cast a large shadow over Celtic’s preparations for the Scottish Cup final against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, which the Hoops would win 3-1 to complete the treble. But now that the job is his, a raft of ex-players and football pundits in the United Kingdom have shared their thoughts on how Postecoglou’s Spurs tenure will play out. Liverpool legend Michael Owen tweeted: “If @SpursOfficial secure Postecoglou it will be the first time they’ve secured a manager that fits their famed style of play in years. I think he’s top class and it’ll be a bitter blow for @CelticFC to lose him.” How Ange will perform for 'biggest test' | 07:17 MORE COVERAGE Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as massive player clean-out plan revealed Rumour Mill: Euro giants lead Kane chase; Man Utd eye ‘next Haaland’ as $81m plan B Ange ‘reaches agreement’ to manage Spurs, deal details revealed with one last step left Former Spurs defender Ramon Vega issued a rallying cry to the Tottenham faithful to get behind their new man in charge. “Well, Spurs fans there is no question about it, if he comes we have to back him fully,” Vega wrote on Twitter. “You back him as a fan he will sort it out but I hope the board will help him and learn from their past mistakes. “Great man, great coach! It’s a shame if he leaves Celtic his (sic) done a brilliant job there.” BBC Scotland’s chief sports writer Tom English drew a parallel between Postecoglou and a certain fictional football coach due to their remarkable ability to inspire their troops. “He understands what makes players tick, he commands respect, he has a presence, he’s a motivator and he’s got a good record in the transfer market,” English said on BBC Radio 5 Live . “His manta is ‘we never stop’. He likes to play his fast, dynamic and energetic football. I think he deserves a crack at [the Premier League]. “He’s a tough cookie, he’s not some kind of Australian Ted Lasso here, but he has an inspirational quality — he gets people and I think it will be fascinating to see how he does at Spurs.” Ange on verge of coaching Tottenham | 02:01 Former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp is also a big fan of the 57-year-old’s work and revealed it was an encounter with Tim Cahill when the former was manager of Jordan that woke him up to Postecoglou’s brilliance. “I’ve said before I met him out in Australia, when I went out and managed the Jordan national team, he managed the Australian team,” Redknapp said on talkSPORT . “Tim Cahill played for the Australian team and I was just chatting to him before the game and he said, ‘Our manager’s fantastic.’ “I said, ‘Really,’ he said, ‘Harry, he is top drawer,’ and that was it. I’d never heard of him at that time … Timmy Cahill said he was brilliant and that’s stuck with me. “Then I’ve watched how he’s done at Celtic and he’s been brilliant, I love him. “There’s no fannying [around] with him, he says it as it is, I like him. He don’t care, if a player misses a goal he’s not afraid to say, ‘My old woman could’ve scored that.’” Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan believes Postecoglou could have a galvanising impact on Spurs’ squad and indeed the club as a whole in a similar fashion to a certain German in Liverpool. “He might win a cup like (Antonio) Conte should have done,” Jordan said on talkSPORT . Postecoglou earned plenty of admirers during his two-year stint at Celtic. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images “I think it’s great for him. He’s got the character to galvanise and bring the fan base with him. It’s somewhat similar to the way Klopp did with Liverpool. “He’s an inclusive manager, he doesn’t seek to alienate or make little islands people sit on. “He will need to have the intrinsic value of everyone being together and get them going.” Although there may be some similarities Postecoglou shares with his predecessor Conte, namely their habit for picking up trophies wherever they go with the exception of Spurs for the latter, The Guardian’s David Hytner points out there are some stark differences. “Postecoglou is the counterpoint to Conte in several areas,” Hytner wrote. “He has a reputation to make and is willing to be patient, to rebuild with the staff and budgets he is given. “It is inescapable that Levy’s appointments of Conte and Mourinho, win-at-all-cost A-listers, with the emphasis on cost, blew up before they worked out.” However, it’s not all smiles and positivity from some surrounding Postecoglou’s looming appointment. The Telegraph’s Thom Gibbs pointed out success in Scotland “has rarely translated to glory in England” for those who make the immediate jump from the Scottish top flight to the Premier League since 2000. Former Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers was one relative exception as he guided Leicester to back-to-back fifth-place finishes and an FA Cup in 2021 but had the Foxes on a one-way ticket to the Championship this year.

Postecoglou helped Celtic complete the treble on Sunday. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images It’s why Gibbs holds fears for Postecoglou as he begins “adjusting from a small pond to shark-infested waters.” Despite Postecoglou arriving in London with a reputation for winning silverware — something Tottenham famously does not — Arsenal legend Martin Keown feels the Australian won’t be able to fill Spurs’ empty trophy cabinet. “I want to have respect for all managers, but I thought Conte was an outstanding manager,” Keown told talkSPORT . “That was my biggest fear actually [that Spurs would win trophies], because he was capable of doing special things. “Daniel Levy in 2021 was talking about a brand of football that he was looking for, whether or not this appointment is about that, whether or not he wants to see attractive football. “Of course he wants to see a trophy being won, but it [Postecoglou’s appointment] doesn’t really strike any fear into me no, not as Conte did.” Time will tell whether certain pundits are forced to eat their words in a similar vein to when Postecoglou silenced the doubters in his first season at Celtic. But the former Socceroos boss is going to become the name hot on everyone’s lips as he gears up for his first crack at a Premier League job.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 01:23:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as details over massive player clean-out revealed","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/premier-league-2023-football-news-epl-ange-postecoglou-nears-tottenham-deal-spurs-transfers-loom-harry-kane-celtic/news-story/4a58c9690f4128653ae50f95458829b2","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s Ange Postecoglou could be confirmed as Tottenham’s new manager within hours after the Premier League club agreed compensation with Celtic.","content":"Australia’s Ange Postecoglou could be confirmed as Tottenham’s new manager within hours after the Premier League club agreed compensation with Celtic.

Daily Mirror reports that Brentford keeper David Raya is on the wishlist with veteran captain Hugo Lloris widely expected to leave this summer. Postecoglou’s attacking style demands a keeper who can play out from the back, and Raya is noted as a skilled ball-player who could fit the bill.

Spurs reach 'verbal agreement' with Ange | 01:23 Meanwhile, valued at the same price of £40 million is another Spurs target in Leicester midfielder James Maddison. The Daily Mirror reports that Spurs would be willing to match a rival bid from Newcastle, which is also said to be eager to sign the 26-year-old. Wolves defender Max Kilman was a third target named in the Mirror report with Postecoglou potentially clearing house at Spurs — Eric Dier and Davinson Sanchez are defenders potentially being forced out the door. While it’s unclear how much Kilman would cost, his market value is considered to be in the region of £20-25 million (A$37.6m - A$47m).

Stream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > How Ange will perform for 'biggest test' | 07:17 Sound familiar? The former Socceroos coach has all but officially been announced as Tottenham Hotspur’s new boss and he enters a situation eerily similar to the one he found when he arrived at Celtic. Postecoglou, who was with Yokohama F. Marinos at the time, was announced as the Scottish giants’ new boss in July 2021 to little acclaim. After all, Celtic had pinned their hopes on former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe to take over from Neil Lennon, only for the former to turn down the gig and leave the Hoops in a state of flux. Once news broke of Postecoglou’s imminent arrival, it sparked a wave of confusion from pundits with no reaction more infamous than that of 13-time Scotland international Alan Brazil. The Scot quipped on talkSPORT at the time: “Celtic have applied for exemption with UEFA for Yokohama Marinos boss, what is it, Postecooglou? (sic), to manage in Europe. “He does not hold the required licence – oh, this has got to be a wind-up.” Asked how he’d fare, Brazil sarcastically replied: “Oh, he’d be a great manager. Where do they come up with these guys from?” A domestic treble in the 2022/23 season, five trophies and a return to the Champions League proved Brazil and all of the other doubters so very, very wrong. Now, Postecoglou must do all of that again: galvanise the fractured fan base, rebuild the squad and deliver success to a club which pays its cleaners overtime to hide the dust on its trophy cabinet. But this time, it’s not in the small pond that is the Scottish Premiership, it’s in the Pacific Ocean that is the Premier League. Ange & Fozzie bury the hatchet | 01:01 MORE COVERAGE UK View: ‘Top class’ Ange ‘not just an Australian Ted Lasso’ but ‘shark-infested waters’ loom Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as massive player clean-out plan revealed Rumour Mill: Euro giants lead Kane chase; Man Utd eye ‘next Haaland’ as $81m plan B RUTHLESS TWO-YEAR GLASWEGIAN CULL PROVIDES BIG ANGE CLUE Where Postecoglou goes, a swashbuckling and fast-paced brand of attacking football follows. But to implement his trademark style of play, it requires a certain type of player. When it came to the summer window in 2021, Postecoglou wasted little time in bringing through his transfer targets but, like his own appointment, they arrived with scepticism. After all, what would Kyogo Furuhashi, who arrived from Vissel Kobe in the J1 League, offer that Celtic couldn’t find elsewhere in Europe? Yet Furuhashi and almost all of Postecoglou’s other signings proved the doubters wrong as they endeared themselves to the Celtic faithful with endless running and passionate displays. To highlight Postecoglou’s eye for a deal and how big of a squad overhaul he enacted, he spent just $AUD42 million ( per Transfermarkt ) on signings throughout the 2021/22 season across 17 players. But his spending was aided by selling three key assets in Odsonne Edouard, Kristoffer Ajer and Ryan Christie as Celtic recouped $60 million in outgoing transfer fees, representing an $18 million profit. Postecoglou again dipped into the transfer market ahead of the 2022/23 season where he turned Jota and Cameron Carter-Vickers, who were on loan in Postecoglou’s first Celtic campaign, into permanent signings. What's Ange's Tottenham to-do list? | 05:26 So too was all-action winger Daizen Maeda, who joined from Yokohama F. Marinos while Socceroos star Aaron Mooy was snapped up on a free deal. With a Champions League campaign on the horizon, there wasn’t a great need for a Celtic clear-out in Postecoglou’s second season with the main exits coming via Josip Juranovic and Georgios Giakoumakis, who both arrived only a season earlier. Although Celtic made a net loss of $27 million, the money made from playing Champions League football softened the financial blow and kept the club in a healthy state. In Postecoglou’s final game as Celtic boss, the starting lineup had just two players who were at the club prior to his arrival: captain Callum McGregor and left-back Greg Taylor. Even for the Hoops’ first Champions League match against Real Madrid this season, McGregor and Taylor were the only ones from the pre-Postecoglou era who started. What that proves is Postecoglou is ruthless when it comes to overhauling teams to fit his mould, but there is also a place for those willing to learn and adapt under his tutelage. It’s a skill he will undoubtedly need to call on once the moment he gets his feet under the desk at Tottenham. Spurs reach 'verbal agreement' with Ange | 01:23 THE SILVER LININGS IN SPURS’ $863M MESS As it stands, Tottenham have one of the older squads in the Premier League, especially when it came to last season’s starting lineup. Hugo Lloris, the club’s captain and first-choice goalkeeper, is 36. Backup goalkeeper Fraser Foster is 35. Ivan Perisic is 34, Heung-Min Son and Ben Davies are 30 while Eric Dier and Harry Kane are both 29. Worryingly, all of these players — especially Kane — were relied on far too heavily throughout the season. As for Tottenham’s record in the transfer market over recent years, it has been patchy at best. Since the summer of 2019, the London club has spent a staggering $863 million on new players. French midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, a $100m arrival in that first window, was the most expensive of the lot with Richarlison’s $93 million transfer in July last year not far behind. But Ndombele has only showed glimpses of his ability since his record-breaking move while Richarlison received more yellow cards for celebrating his goals than he actually scored in the Premier League. In that same time span, the club has brought in $150 million in transfer and loan fees. Granted, that is not necessarily down to the manager and perhaps speaks more to chairman Daniel Levy’s inability to move on players deemed as surplus to requirements. But some players who have joined the club in that time have had minuscule impact, underpinning the club’s poor transfer dealings. Richarlison has struggled to justify his price tag. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Bryan Gil, signed in 2021, has more chance of being in a Beatles tribute band than playing for Spurs again after being farmed out on loan twice since his arrival. The Telegraph claims Postecoglou will be given the freedom to conduct a clear-out of his own, with as many as seven first-team players set to be kicked out the exit door. The report claims Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon should seek pastures new, while the club could be open to bids for defensive duo Ben Davies and Eric Dier. Harry Winks, Sergio Reguilon and Giovani Lo Celso, who all spent last season out on loan at different clubs, could also be shafted to help Postecoglou trim the fat from the squad. Lloris has also gone on the record stating he isn’t quite sure what the future holds as he reportedly has a tempting offer on the table from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club. There’s also the curious case of what to do with record signing Ndombele. The French midfielder made 30 appearances for Napoli as they went on to win Serie A this season, but 22 of those came from the bench. Whether Postecoglou views him as a diamond which needs refining or damaged goods remains to be seen, but if he is to be sold, his value has certainly decreased since his record-breaking arrival. Safe to say the former Socceroos boss will have his hands full when it comes to culling players. But there’s still one very important piece to the puzzle in North London that Postecoglou might not even have a say on. Spurs fans have suffered in recent years. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images THE BIG KANE CONUNDRUM THAT COULD SHAPE ANGE’S SEASON He’s the club’s all-time top goalscorer. He’s their attacking talisman who bagged 30 goals in a season where Tottenham secured their lowest finish in 14 years. He is, quite essentially, Tottenham Hotspur. And he could become the club’s biggest problem this summer. Harry Kane has spent virtually his entire career at Tottenham and become one of the most lethal strikers in world football. But for all of the goals he’s scored in the famous white shirt — 280 goals to be exact — he has no team silverware to show for it. Kane will turn 30 on July 28 and although players are able to prolong their careers more than ever thanks to modern science, he isn’t getting any younger. So, why is Kane such a hot topic for Spurs? Well, he has just one year remaining on his current deal. It presents Levy with an almighty conundrum: does he decide to cash in on his most prized asset now, or does he hold on to him for one more season but run the risk of letting him walk for free this time next year? Kane won’t be short on potential suitors, with Manchester United a team constantly linked with the England skipper. There’s also heavy interest from Real Madrid, who are in the hunt for a superstar striker after Karim Benzema departed the club and have the funds to pull off such a deal. Transfermarkt values Kane at $145 million , but Levy will no doubt look to squeeze more from interested parties if the need arises. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is deeply unpopular with fans. (Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP) Source: AFP Levy is known in football circles as a tough negotiator at the best of times, but what about at his worst? Allow legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to indulge, as he dealt with Levy in an ultimately successful pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov in 2008. “That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement,” Ferguson famously quipped. There’s no doubt the question would have been one of many Postecoglou asked Levy before taking on the role and the soon-to-be former Hoops boss will have prepared for either scenario. If Kane stays, Postecoglou will have the chance to work with one of the best strikers in world football for at least one season. Who knows, perhaps the 29-year-old could become so enamoured with Postecoglou’s style of play he decides to hang around in North London a little while longer, pending Spurs’ success under the Aussie boss. But if Kane is moved on, it would give Postecoglou significant funds to work with as he plots a rebuild of the club. In some respects, it might even buy him more patience from the club’s powerbrokers and fans knowing they no longer have their record goalscorer in their ranks. Either way, Postecoglou will be prepared. Kane’s future is going to be a topic of hot discussion throughout the summer. (Photo by Oli SCARFF / AFP) Source: AFP After a spectacularly poor season in which they had three different faces in the dugout and missed out on European football for the first time in 13 years, things can’t get much worse at Tottenham. Add in the pressing need for a squad refresh and the prospect of losing Kane, it’s not quite a free hit for Postecoglou but it’s a golden chance to prove the football world wrong. Just like he has done at every stage of his career from Brisbane all the way to Glasgow. Of course, expectations will be high at Tottenham. They have a world-class stadium and a squad that, albeit its many flaws, is one many teams in Europe would crave. If Postecoglou starts slowly, you best believe the claws of the ruthless English media will sharpen by the minute and fans will make their feelings heard in the stadium, pubs and social media. But that’s just the perfect storm for Postecoglou to thrive in, just like it was in Glasgow two years ago.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 06:41:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ten-year-old schoolgirl scores incredible 143 goals for her football team in a single season","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ten-year-old-schoolgirl-scores-27052519","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (John Jones)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Amelia Morris is a talented football player but is also a four-time gold medallist in another sport","content":"A 10-year-old schoolgirl has put the likes of Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Paul Mullin to shame with an astonishing goal-scoring record that has seen her net 143 times in a single season. Amelia Morris unsurprisingly finished as top scorer for her team, Gurnos FC in Merthyr Tydfil, this season and even had to be taken off midway through most games she played to give other teams a chance, such was her prowess in front of goal. Incredibly, her sporting talents don't stop there, as she is also a four-time gold medallist in kickboxing, having started out at the age of five before going on to represent Wales at the World Championships. READ MORE: Being Rocco, Wales' smallest superfan whose adorable videos made him an overnight celebrity According to her proud dad (and coach) Jamie, Amelia started kickboxing when she was just five years old before taking up football a few years later. \"Ever since she was born she's always had a ball in her hand or kicking it,\" he said. \"But on the Gurnos we didn't have any football teams for girls of that age, so she was about eight when she started. \"Amelia's been playing for the under-10s this season. We've played all over south Wales and beaten pretty much every team and she's just been incredible. At the start, she was averaging about 10 goals every weekend, but we had to bring her off halfway through the games because it was too easy for us. \"At that age you want everyone to be having fun more than anything and it's not that fun if you're getting beaten by a lot - so we had to go easy on them by giving her a bit of a break! If we hadn't taken her off she would have been on even more goals by the end of the season.\" Amelia only took up football a few years ago but is already an accomplished goal scorer (Image: Jamie Morris) Amelia after scoring her 100th goal of the season (Image: Jamie Morris) She also won four gold medals at the World Kickboxing Championships in Cardiff last year (Image: Jamie Morris) Amelia's fine form in front of goal has already been rewarded with a place in the South Wales Development Squad, who she played for last season, while she has now been invited to go on trial for Caerphilly Schools later this month. And the multi-talented youngster - who idolises Welsh boxer and former Wales footballer Lauren Price - is just as prolific when it comes to kickboxing, having won four gold medals at last year's World Kickboxing and Karate Union (WKU) World Championships, which were held in Cardiff for the first time. \"Amelia had her first fight in a ring about two years ago,\" said Jamie. \"And then her coach put her forward for the World Championships, as Wales wanted to have a big squad as the home nation. She was fighting at under-25kg but the nearest competition class to that in Wales is under-40kg, so she was smaller than everyone but it didn't faze her and she went in there and did really, really well.\" \"We're all so proud of her,\" he added. \"She's only young but is doing so well. The Gurnos doesn't get the best publicity so it's great for Amelia to get the recognition she has got for her achievements and hopefully she will inspire other kids from around here too.\" READ NEXT: The inside story of Cardiff City's manager hunt and why they went for Erol Bulut Meet the 90-year-old oldest goalkeeper in the world with a pacemaker and hip replacements The Turkish view of what to expect from Cardiff City's Erol Bulut Ben Foster estimates how much Wrexham's lavish Vegas bash cost Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney Historic Welsh club and neighbours of boom side Wrexham in turmoil as entire playing squad walk out","pubDate":"2023-06-06 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27062295.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Screenshot_20230601-173700_WhatsApp.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ex-India Star's Son 'Super Happy' After Meeting Dhoni.

Cardinale từ Mỹ sang Italy giai đoạn cuối mùa giải và họp trực tiếp với Maldini ngày 5/6, một ngày sau trận thắng Hellas Verona 3-1 ở vòng hạ màn Serie A. Nhưng diễn biến cuộc họp chỉ đào sâu thêm khác biệt quan điểm giữa hai bên. Cardinale (trái) và Maldini mâu thuẫn sâu sắc về đường hướng phát triển AC Milan từ đầu năm 2023. Ảnh: AFP Tại đây, Maldini yêu cầu có thêm quyền tự chủ và được cấp thêm ngân sách để tăng cường lực lượng trong hè 2023. Tuy nhiên, Cardinale - giám đốc của Red Bird, chủ sở hữu CLB, và Giám đốc điều hành Giorgio Furlani lại mong muốn giảm chi phí và tiếp tục phát triển theo mô hình hiện tại. Cardinale và Furlani còn chỉ ra rằng Maldini được cấp ngân sách để chi tiêu, nhưng phần lớn số tiền trong đó được đầu tư cho thương vụ trị giá hơn 40 triệu USD Charles De Ketelaere. Và tiền vệ trẻ người Bỉ gây thất vọng khi không ghi bàn qua 40 trận trên mọi đấu trường mùa này. Theo Calciomercato , Maldini và Massara đã bị Cardinale sa thải, thay vì những thông tin ban đầu rằng bộ đôi này từ chức. Sky Sport Italy và chuyên gia săn tin chuyển nhượng Fabrizio Romano cũng xác nhận thông tin. Quyết định này sẽ làm thay đổi hoàn toàn cấu trúc ở thượng tầng Milan , bởi Maldini và Massara từng phụ trách khâu chuyển nhượng, đàm phán hợp đồng. Theo La Repubblica , nhiều cầu thủ Milan đều bị sốc và tức giận trước diễn biến mới nhất nơi thượng tầng. Sandro Tonali và Theo Hernandez xem vai trò của Maldini không chỉ là Giám đốc Kỹ thuật, mà còn đại diện cho lịch sử CLB. Rafael Leao, người ngồi giữa Maldini và Massara để ký gia hạn hợp đồng đến năm 2028 chỉ vài ngày trước, đăng trên Twitter dòng trạng thái với biểu tượng cảm xúc đang suy nghĩ. Maldini (trái) và Massara trong lễ ký gia hạn hợp đồng giữa Milan với Rafael Leao ngày 3/6. Ảnh: AC Milan Maldini giành trọn sự nghiệp chơi cho Milan, giai đoạn 1984-2009. Ông giữ kỷ lục chơi 902 trận cho Milan. Từ 2018, cựu hậu vệ trái lừng danh này làm Giám đốc phụ trách chiến lược và phát triển thể thao. Từ thán 6/2019, ông được bổ nhiệm vào ghế Giám đốc Kỹ thuật. Trong vai trò Giám đốc Kỹ thuật, Maldini cùng Giám đốc Thể thao Massara được đánh giá cao khi mua về nhiều cầu thủ trẻ chất lượng cao với giá rẻ, rồi tăng đáng kể giá trị sau một thời gian cống hiến CLB. Số này gồm thủ môn Maignan (được mua về với giá 14,5 triệu USD - hiện được định giá 65 triệu), trung vệ Tomori (31 triệu - 53 triệu), tiền vệ Tonali (18 triệu - 53 triệu), hậu vệ Theo Hernandez (22 triệu - 76 triệu), tiền đạo Leao (28 triệu - 100 triệu), tiền vệ Bennacer (18 triệu - 53 triệu). Các cựu binh giá rẻ mà Maldini - Massara đưa về như trung vệ Simon Kjaer hay tiền đạo Olivier Giroud cũng đều đóng góp lớn cho đội bóng. Những cầu thủ này đều là trụ cột của Milan vô địch Serie A 2021-2022 và vào đến bán kết Champions League mùa vừa qua. Theo Football Italy , Igli Tare - người vừa thông báo không gia hạn hợp đồng làm Giám đốc Thể thao Lazio - là ứng viên thay Maldini. Nhưng không loại trừ khả năng Giám đốc điều hành Furlani sẽ đảm nhận thêm vai trò của Maldini để kiểm soát thêm hướng đi cho tương lai của CLB, còn trưởng bộ phận tuyển trạch Geoffrey Moncada được thăng chức lên Giám đốc Thể thao thay Massara. Mùa này, Milan bị loại từ vòng 1/8 Cup Italy, thua CLB cùng thành phố Inter tại bán kết Champions League và trận tranh Siêu Cup Italy.

It represents a whirlwind few weeks from when the news of Tottenham’s strong interest in Postecoglou was initially revealed to now where it is all but official. The Spurs job cast a large shadow over Celtic’s preparations for the Scottish Cup final against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, which the Hoops would win 3-1 to complete the treble. But now that the job is his, a raft of ex-players and football pundits in the United Kingdom have shared their thoughts on how Postecoglou’s Spurs tenure will play out. Liverpool legend Michael Owen tweeted: “If @SpursOfficial secure Postecoglou it will be the first time they’ve secured a manager that fits their famed style of play in years. I think he’s top class and it’ll be a bitter blow for @CelticFC to lose him.” How Ange will perform for 'biggest test' | 07:17 MORE COVERAGE Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as massive player clean-out plan revealed Rumour Mill: Euro giants lead Kane chase; Man Utd eye ‘next Haaland’ as $81m plan B Ange ‘reaches agreement’ to manage Spurs, deal details revealed with one last step left Former Spurs defender Ramon Vega issued a rallying cry to the Tottenham faithful to get behind their new man in charge. “Well, Spurs fans there is no question about it, if he comes we have to back him fully,” Vega wrote on Twitter. “You back him as a fan he will sort it out but I hope the board will help him and learn from their past mistakes. “Great man, great coach! It’s a shame if he leaves Celtic his (sic) done a brilliant job there.” BBC Scotland’s chief sports writer Tom English drew a parallel between Postecoglou and a certain fictional football coach due to their remarkable ability to inspire their troops. “He understands what makes players tick, he commands respect, he has a presence, he’s a motivator and he’s got a good record in the transfer market,” English said on BBC Radio 5 Live . “His manta is ‘we never stop’. He likes to play his fast, dynamic and energetic football. I think he deserves a crack at [the Premier League]. “He’s a tough cookie, he’s not some kind of Australian Ted Lasso here, but he has an inspirational quality — he gets people and I think it will be fascinating to see how he does at Spurs.” Ange on verge of coaching Tottenham | 02:01 Former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp is also a big fan of the 57-year-old’s work and revealed it was an encounter with Tim Cahill when the former was manager of Jordan that woke him up to Postecoglou’s brilliance. “I’ve said before I met him out in Australia, when I went out and managed the Jordan national team, he managed the Australian team,” Redknapp said on talkSPORT . “Tim Cahill played for the Australian team and I was just chatting to him before the game and he said, ‘Our manager’s fantastic.’ “I said, ‘Really,’ he said, ‘Harry, he is top drawer,’ and that was it. I’d never heard of him at that time … Timmy Cahill said he was brilliant and that’s stuck with me. “Then I’ve watched how he’s done at Celtic and he’s been brilliant, I love him. “There’s no fannying [around] with him, he says it as it is, I like him. He don’t care, if a player misses a goal he’s not afraid to say, ‘My old woman could’ve scored that.’” Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan believes Postecoglou could have a galvanising impact on Spurs’ squad and indeed the club as a whole in a similar fashion to a certain German in Liverpool. “He might win a cup like (Antonio) Conte should have done,” Jordan said on talkSPORT . Postecoglou earned plenty of admirers during his two-year stint at Celtic. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images “I think it’s great for him. He’s got the character to galvanise and bring the fan base with him. It’s somewhat similar to the way Klopp did with Liverpool. “He’s an inclusive manager, he doesn’t seek to alienate or make little islands people sit on. “He will need to have the intrinsic value of everyone being together and get them going.” Although there may be some similarities Postecoglou shares with his predecessor Conte, namely their habit for picking up trophies wherever they go with the exception of Spurs for the latter, The Guardian’s David Hytner points out there are some stark differences. “Postecoglou is the counterpoint to Conte in several areas,” Hytner wrote. “He has a reputation to make and is willing to be patient, to rebuild with the staff and budgets he is given. “It is inescapable that Levy’s appointments of Conte and Mourinho, win-at-all-cost A-listers, with the emphasis on cost, blew up before they worked out.” However, it’s not all smiles and positivity from some surrounding Postecoglou’s looming appointment. The Telegraph’s Thom Gibbs pointed out success in Scotland “has rarely translated to glory in England” for those who make the immediate jump from the Scottish top flight to the Premier League since 2000. Former Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers was one relative exception as he guided Leicester to back-to-back fifth-place finishes and an FA Cup in 2021 but had the Foxes on a one-way ticket to the Championship this year. Steven Gerrard, who moved from Rangers to Aston Villa in 2021, failed spectacularly and was sacked less than a year into his tenure at Villa Park. Postecoglou helped Celtic complete the treble on Sunday. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images It’s why Gibbs holds fears for Postecoglou as he begins “adjusting from a small pond to shark-infested waters.” Despite Postecoglou arriving in London with a reputation for winning silverware — something Tottenham famously does not — Arsenal legend Martin Keown feels the Australian won’t be able to fill Spurs’ empty trophy cabinet. “I want to have respect for all managers, but I thought Conte was an outstanding manager,” Keown told talkSPORT . “That was my biggest fear actually [that Spurs would win trophies], because he was capable of doing special things. “Daniel Levy in 2021 was talking about a brand of football that he was looking for, whether or not this appointment is about that, whether or not he wants to see attractive football. “Of course he wants to see a trophy being won, but it [Postecoglou’s appointment] doesn’t really strike any fear into me no, not as Conte did.” Time will tell whether certain pundits are forced to eat their words in a similar vein to when Postecoglou silenced the doubters in his first season at Celtic. But the former Socceroos boss is going to become the name hot on everyone’s lips as he gears up for his first crack at a Premier League job.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 01:23:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as details over massive player clean-out revealed","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/premier-league-2023-football-news-epl-ange-postecoglou-nears-tottenham-deal-spurs-transfers-loom-harry-kane-celtic/news-story/4a58c9690f4128653ae50f95458829b2","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s Ange Postecoglou could be confirmed as Tottenham’s new manager within hours after the Premier League club agreed compensation with Celtic.","content":"Australia’s Ange Postecoglou could be confirmed as Tottenham’s new manager within hours after the Premier League club agreed compensation with Celtic.

Daily Mirror reports that Brentford keeper David Raya is on the wishlist with veteran captain Hugo Lloris widely expected to leave this summer. Postecoglou’s attacking style demands a keeper who can play out from the back, and Raya is noted as a skilled ball-player who could fit the bill.

Spurs reach 'verbal agreement' with Ange | 01:23 Meanwhile, valued at the same price of £40 million is another Spurs target in Leicester midfielder James Maddison. The Daily Mirror reports that Spurs would be willing to match a rival bid from Newcastle, which is also said to be eager to sign the 26-year-old. Wolves defender Max Kilman was a third target named in the Mirror report with Postecoglou potentially clearing house at Spurs — Eric Dier and Davinson Sanchez are defenders potentially being forced out the door. While it’s unclear how much Kilman would cost, his market value is considered to be in the region of £20-25 million (A$37.6m - A$47m). The Telegraph also reports that Postecoglou’s arrival is expected to trigger a player clear-out with up to seven first-team players on the chopping block. Among them include Lloris, as well as full back Ivan Perisic and Ryan Sessegnon. Transfer bids for Ben Davies could also be entertained, while Arnaut Danjuma and Clement Lenglet were also named by the Telegraph report. Benzema calls time on 14yr Madrid career | 01:05 And the clear-out may not stop there with Giovani Lo Celso, Sergio Reguilon and Harry Winks also potentially heading towards the exit. The biggest transfer issue facing Postecoglou on arrival, however, is star striker Kane and whether he will be leaving. Kane is entering the final year of his contract and Spurs will need to sell him now, otherwise it runs the risk of losing him for free at season’s end. Manchester United led the race to sign Kane, but Real Madrid has since emerged as the front runner as the Spanish giants seek a replacement for Karim Benzema. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy values Kane at over £100 million.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 00:46:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ПСЖ підписав контракт з футболістом Реалу","link":"https://ua.korrespondent.net/sport/football/4595758-pszh-pidpysav-kontrakt-z-futbolistom-realu","keywords":["Новини футболу"],"creator":["1"],"video_url":null,"description":"Півзахисник Марко Асенсіо переїде із столиці Іспанії до столиці Франції на правах вільного агента.","content":"Марко Асенсіо не залишиться у мадридському Реалі, а продовжить кар'єру в ПСЖ.

He will also arrive amid plenty of trepidation from even some of the more optimistic supporters given he is a relative unknown quantity when it comes to the league. Stream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > How Ange will perform for 'biggest test' | 07:17 Sound familiar? The former Socceroos coach has all but officially been announced as Tottenham Hotspur’s new boss and he enters a situation eerily similar to the one he found when he arrived at Celtic. Postecoglou, who was with Yokohama F. Marinos at the time, was announced as the Scottish giants’ new boss in July 2021 to little acclaim. After all, Celtic had pinned their hopes on former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe to take over from Neil Lennon, only for the former to turn down the gig and leave the Hoops in a state of flux. Once news broke of Postecoglou’s imminent arrival, it sparked a wave of confusion from pundits with no reaction more infamous than that of 13-time Scotland international Alan Brazil. The Scot quipped on talkSPORT at the time: “Celtic have applied for exemption with UEFA for Yokohama Marinos boss, what is it, Postecooglou? (sic), to manage in Europe. “He does not hold the required licence – oh, this has got to be a wind-up.” Asked how he’d fare, Brazil sarcastically replied: “Oh, he’d be a great manager. Where do they come up with these guys from?” A domestic treble in the 2022/23 season, five trophies and a return to the Champions League proved Brazil and all of the other doubters so very, very wrong. Now, Postecoglou must do all of that again: galvanise the fractured fan base, rebuild the squad and deliver success to a club which pays its cleaners overtime to hide the dust on its trophy cabinet. But this time, it’s not in the small pond that is the Scottish Premiership, it’s in the Pacific Ocean that is the Premier League. Ange & Fozzie bury the hatchet | 01:01 MORE COVERAGE UK View: ‘Top class’ Ange ‘not just an Australian Ted Lasso’ but ‘shark-infested waters’ loom Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as massive player clean-out plan revealed Rumour Mill: Euro giants lead Kane chase; Man Utd eye ‘next Haaland’ as $81m plan B RUTHLESS TWO-YEAR GLASWEGIAN CULL PROVIDES BIG ANGE CLUE Where Postecoglou goes, a swashbuckling and fast-paced brand of attacking football follows. But to implement his trademark style of play, it requires a certain type of player. When it came to the summer window in 2021, Postecoglou wasted little time in bringing through his transfer targets but, like his own appointment, they arrived with scepticism. After all, what would Kyogo Furuhashi, who arrived from Vissel Kobe in the J1 League, offer that Celtic couldn’t find elsewhere in Europe? Yet Furuhashi and almost all of Postecoglou’s other signings proved the doubters wrong as they endeared themselves to the Celtic faithful with endless running and passionate displays. To highlight Postecoglou’s eye for a deal and how big of a squad overhaul he enacted, he spent just $AUD42 million ( per Transfermarkt ) on signings throughout the 2021/22 season across 17 players. But his spending was aided by selling three key assets in Odsonne Edouard, Kristoffer Ajer and Ryan Christie as Celtic recouped $60 million in outgoing transfer fees, representing an $18 million profit. Postecoglou again dipped into the transfer market ahead of the 2022/23 season where he turned Jota and Cameron Carter-Vickers, who were on loan in Postecoglou’s first Celtic campaign, into permanent signings. What's Ange's Tottenham to-do list? | 05:26 So too was all-action winger Daizen Maeda, who joined from Yokohama F. Marinos while Socceroos star Aaron Mooy was snapped up on a free deal. With a Champions League campaign on the horizon, there wasn’t a great need for a Celtic clear-out in Postecoglou’s second season with the main exits coming via Josip Juranovic and Georgios Giakoumakis, who both arrived only a season earlier. Although Celtic made a net loss of $27 million, the money made from playing Champions League football softened the financial blow and kept the club in a healthy state. In Postecoglou’s final game as Celtic boss, the starting lineup had just two players who were at the club prior to his arrival: captain Callum McGregor and left-back Greg Taylor. Even for the Hoops’ first Champions League match against Real Madrid this season, McGregor and Taylor were the only ones from the pre-Postecoglou era who started. What that proves is Postecoglou is ruthless when it comes to overhauling teams to fit his mould, but there is also a place for those willing to learn and adapt under his tutelage. It’s a skill he will undoubtedly need to call on once the moment he gets his feet under the desk at Tottenham. Spurs reach 'verbal agreement' with Ange | 01:23 THE SILVER LININGS IN SPURS’ $863M MESS As it stands, Tottenham have one of the older squads in the Premier League, especially when it came to last season’s starting lineup. Hugo Lloris, the club’s captain and first-choice goalkeeper, is 36. Backup goalkeeper Fraser Foster is 35. Ivan Perisic is 34, Heung-Min Son and Ben Davies are 30 while Eric Dier and Harry Kane are both 29. Worryingly, all of these players — especially Kane — were relied on far too heavily throughout the season. As for Tottenham’s record in the transfer market over recent years, it has been patchy at best. Since the summer of 2019, the London club has spent a staggering $863 million on new players. French midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, a $100m arrival in that first window, was the most expensive of the lot with Richarlison’s $93 million transfer in July last year not far behind. But Ndombele has only showed glimpses of his ability since his record-breaking move while Richarlison received more yellow cards for celebrating his goals than he actually scored in the Premier League. In that same time span, the club has brought in $150 million in transfer and loan fees. Granted, that is not necessarily down to the manager and perhaps speaks more to chairman Daniel Levy’s inability to move on players deemed as surplus to requirements. But some players who have joined the club in that time have had minuscule impact, underpinning the club’s poor transfer dealings. Richarlison has struggled to justify his price tag. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Bryan Gil, signed in 2021, has more chance of being in a Beatles tribute band than playing for Spurs again after being farmed out on loan twice since his arrival. The Telegraph claims Postecoglou will be given the freedom to conduct a clear-out of his own, with as many as seven first-team players set to be kicked out the exit door. The report claims Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon should seek pastures new, while the club could be open to bids for defensive duo Ben Davies and Eric Dier. Harry Winks, Sergio Reguilon and Giovani Lo Celso, who all spent last season out on loan at different clubs, could also be shafted to help Postecoglou trim the fat from the squad. Lloris has also gone on the record stating he isn’t quite sure what the future holds as he reportedly has a tempting offer on the table from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club. There’s also the curious case of what to do with record signing Ndombele. The French midfielder made 30 appearances for Napoli as they went on to win Serie A this season, but 22 of those came from the bench. Whether Postecoglou views him as a diamond which needs refining or damaged goods remains to be seen, but if he is to be sold, his value has certainly decreased since his record-breaking arrival. Safe to say the former Socceroos boss will have his hands full when it comes to culling players. But there’s still one very important piece to the puzzle in North London that Postecoglou might not even have a say on. Spurs fans have suffered in recent years. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images THE BIG KANE CONUNDRUM THAT COULD SHAPE ANGE’S SEASON He’s the club’s all-time top goalscorer. He’s their attacking talisman who bagged 30 goals in a season where Tottenham secured their lowest finish in 14 years. He is, quite essentially, Tottenham Hotspur. And he could become the club’s biggest problem this summer. Harry Kane has spent virtually his entire career at Tottenham and become one of the most lethal strikers in world football. But for all of the goals he’s scored in the famous white shirt — 280 goals to be exact — he has no team silverware to show for it. Kane will turn 30 on July 28 and although players are able to prolong their careers more than ever thanks to modern science, he isn’t getting any younger. So, why is Kane such a hot topic for Spurs? Well, he has just one year remaining on his current deal. It presents Levy with an almighty conundrum: does he decide to cash in on his most prized asset now, or does he hold on to him for one more season but run the risk of letting him walk for free this time next year? Kane won’t be short on potential suitors, with Manchester United a team constantly linked with the England skipper. There’s also heavy interest from Real Madrid, who are in the hunt for a superstar striker after Karim Benzema departed the club and have the funds to pull off such a deal. Transfermarkt values Kane at $145 million , but Levy will no doubt look to squeeze more from interested parties if the need arises. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is deeply unpopular with fans. (Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP) Source: AFP Levy is known in football circles as a tough negotiator at the best of times, but what about at his worst? Allow legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson to indulge, as he dealt with Levy in an ultimately successful pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov in 2008. “That whole experience was more painful than my hip replacement,” Ferguson famously quipped. There’s no doubt the question would have been one of many Postecoglou asked Levy before taking on the role and the soon-to-be former Hoops boss will have prepared for either scenario. If Kane stays, Postecoglou will have the chance to work with one of the best strikers in world football for at least one season. Who knows, perhaps the 29-year-old could become so enamoured with Postecoglou’s style of play he decides to hang around in North London a little while longer, pending Spurs’ success under the Aussie boss. But if Kane is moved on, it would give Postecoglou significant funds to work with as he plots a rebuild of the club. In some respects, it might even buy him more patience from the club’s powerbrokers and fans knowing they no longer have their record goalscorer in their ranks. Either way, Postecoglou will be prepared. Kane’s future is going to be a topic of hot discussion throughout the summer. (Photo by Oli SCARFF / AFP) Source: AFP After a spectacularly poor season in which they had three different faces in the dugout and missed out on European football for the first time in 13 years, things can’t get much worse at Tottenham. Add in the pressing need for a squad refresh and the prospect of losing Kane, it’s not quite a free hit for Postecoglou but it’s a golden chance to prove the football world wrong. Just like he has done at every stage of his career from Brisbane all the way to Glasgow. Of course, expectations will be high at Tottenham. They have a world-class stadium and a squad that, albeit its many flaws, is one many teams in Europe would crave. If Postecoglou starts slowly, you best believe the claws of the ruthless English media will sharpen by the minute and fans will make their feelings heard in the stadium, pubs and social media. But that’s just the perfect storm for Postecoglou to thrive in, just like it was in Glasgow two years ago.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 06:41:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ten-year-old schoolgirl scores incredible 143 goals for her football team in a single season","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ten-year-old-schoolgirl-scores-27052519","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["newsdesk@walesonline.co.uk (John Jones)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Amelia Morris is a talented football player but is also a four-time gold medallist in another sport","content":"A 10-year-old schoolgirl has put the likes of Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Paul Mullin to shame with an astonishing goal-scoring record that has seen her net 143 times in a single season. Amelia Morris unsurprisingly finished as top scorer for her team, Gurnos FC in Merthyr Tydfil, this season and even had to be taken off midway through most games she played to give other teams a chance, such was her prowess in front of goal. Incredibly, her sporting talents don't stop there, as she is also a four-time gold medallist in kickboxing, having started out at the age of five before going on to represent Wales at the World Championships. READ MORE: Being Rocco, Wales' smallest superfan whose adorable videos made him an overnight celebrity According to her proud dad (and coach) Jamie, Amelia started kickboxing when she was just five years old before taking up football a few years later. \"Ever since she was born she's always had a ball in her hand or kicking it,\" he said. \"But on the Gurnos we didn't have any football teams for girls of that age, so she was about eight when she started. \"Amelia's been playing for the under-10s this season. We've played all over south Wales and beaten pretty much every team and she's just been incredible. At the start, she was averaging about 10 goals every weekend, but we had to bring her off halfway through the games because it was too easy for us. \"At that age you want everyone to be having fun more than anything and it's not that fun if you're getting beaten by a lot - so we had to go easy on them by giving her a bit of a break! If we hadn't taken her off she would have been on even more goals by the end of the season.\" Amelia only took up football a few years ago but is already an accomplished goal scorer (Image: Jamie Morris) Amelia after scoring her 100th goal of the season (Image: Jamie Morris) She also won four gold medals at the World Kickboxing Championships in Cardiff last year (Image: Jamie Morris) Amelia's fine form in front of goal has already been rewarded with a place in the South Wales Development Squad, who she played for last season, while she has now been invited to go on trial for Caerphilly Schools later this month. And the multi-talented youngster - who idolises Welsh boxer and former Wales footballer Lauren Price - is just as prolific when it comes to kickboxing, having won four gold medals at last year's World Kickboxing and Karate Union (WKU) World Championships, which were held in Cardiff for the first time. \"Amelia had her first fight in a ring about two years ago,\" said Jamie. \"And then her coach put her forward for the World Championships, as Wales wanted to have a big squad as the home nation. She was fighting at under-25kg but the nearest competition class to that in Wales is under-40kg, so she was smaller than everyone but it didn't faze her and she went in there and did really, really well.\" \"We're all so proud of her,\" he added. \"She's only young but is doing so well. The Gurnos doesn't get the best publicity so it's great for Amelia to get the recognition she has got for her achievements and hopefully she will inspire other kids from around here too.\" READ NEXT: The inside story of Cardiff City's manager hunt and why they went for Erol Bulut Meet the 90-year-old oldest goalkeeper in the world with a pacemaker and hip replacements The Turkish view of what to expect from Cardiff City's Erol Bulut Ben Foster estimates how much Wrexham's lavish Vegas bash cost Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney Historic Welsh club and neighbours of boom side Wrexham in turmoil as entire playing squad walk out","pubDate":"2023-06-06 04:00:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article27062295.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Screenshot_20230601-173700_WhatsApp.jpg","source_id":"walesonline","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ex-India Star's Son 'Super Happy' After Meeting Dhoni.

Và tiền vệ trẻ người Bỉ gây thất vọng khi không ghi bàn qua 40 trận trên mọi đấu trường mùa này. Theo Calciomercato , Maldini và Massara đã bị Cardinale sa thải, thay vì những thông tin ban đầu rằng bộ đôi này từ chức. Sky Sport Italy và chuyên gia săn tin chuyển nhượng Fabrizio Romano cũng xác nhận thông tin. Quyết định này sẽ làm thay đổi hoàn toàn cấu trúc ở thượng tầng Milan , bởi Maldini và Massara từng phụ trách khâu chuyển nhượng, đàm phán hợp đồng. Theo La Repubblica , nhiều cầu thủ Milan đều bị sốc và tức giận trước diễn biến mới nhất nơi thượng tầng. Sandro Tonali và Theo Hernandez xem vai trò của Maldini không chỉ là Giám đốc Kỹ thuật, mà còn đại diện cho lịch sử CLB. Rafael Leao, người ngồi giữa Maldini và Massara để ký gia hạn hợp đồng đến năm 2028 chỉ vài ngày trước, đăng trên Twitter dòng trạng thái với biểu tượng cảm xúc đang suy nghĩ.

Ông giữ kỷ lục chơi 902 trận cho Milan. Từ 2018, cựu hậu vệ trái lừng danh này làm Giám đốc phụ trách chiến lược và phát triển thể thao. Từ thán 6/2019, ông được bổ nhiệm vào ghế Giám đốc Kỹ thuật. Trong vai trò Giám đốc Kỹ thuật, Maldini cùng Giám đốc Thể thao Massara được đánh giá cao khi mua về nhiều cầu thủ trẻ chất lượng cao với giá rẻ, rồi tăng đáng kể giá trị sau một thời gian cống hiến CLB. Số này gồm thủ môn Maignan (được mua về với giá 14,5 triệu USD - hiện được định giá 65 triệu), trung vệ Tomori (31 triệu - 53 triệu), tiền vệ Tonali (18 triệu - 53 triệu), hậu vệ Theo Hernandez (22 triệu - 76 triệu), tiền đạo Leao (28 triệu - 100 triệu), tiền vệ Bennacer (18 triệu - 53 triệu). Các cựu binh giá rẻ mà Maldini - Massara đưa về như trung vệ Simon Kjaer hay tiền đạo Olivier Giroud cũng đều đóng góp lớn cho đội bóng. Những cầu thủ này đều là trụ cột của Milan vô địch Serie A 2021-2022 và vào đến bán kết Champions League mùa vừa qua. Theo Football Italy , Igli Tare - người vừa thông báo không gia hạn hợp đồng làm Giám đốc Thể thao Lazio - là ứng viên thay Maldini. Nhưng không loại trừ khả năng Giám đốc điều hành Furlani sẽ đảm nhận thêm vai trò của Maldini để kiểm soát thêm hướng đi cho tương lai của CLB, còn trưởng bộ phận tuyển trạch Geoffrey Moncada được thăng chức lên Giám đốc Thể thao thay Massara. Mùa này, Milan bị loại từ vòng 1/8 Cup Italy, thua CLB cùng thành phố Inter tại bán kết Champions League và trận tranh Siêu Cup Italy. Đoàn quân dưới trướng Stefano Pioli may mắn cán đích trong top 4 Serie A nhờ việc Juventus bị trừ 10 điểm.

It represents a whirlwind few weeks from when the news of Tottenham’s strong interest in Postecoglou was initially revealed to now where it is all but official. The Spurs job cast a large shadow over Celtic’s preparations for the Scottish Cup final against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, which the Hoops would win 3-1 to complete the treble. But now that the job is his, a raft of ex-players and football pundits in the United Kingdom have shared their thoughts on how Postecoglou’s Spurs tenure will play out. Liverpool legend Michael Owen tweeted: “If @SpursOfficial secure Postecoglou it will be the first time they’ve secured a manager that fits their famed style of play in years. I think he’s top class and it’ll be a bitter blow for @CelticFC to lose him.” How Ange will perform for 'biggest test' | 07:17 MORE COVERAGE Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as massive player clean-out plan revealed Rumour Mill: Euro giants lead Kane chase; Man Utd eye ‘next Haaland’ as $81m plan B Ange ‘reaches agreement’ to manage Spurs, deal details revealed with one last step left Former Spurs defender Ramon Vega issued a rallying cry to the Tottenham faithful to get behind their new man in charge. “Well, Spurs fans there is no question about it, if he comes we have to back him fully,” Vega wrote on Twitter. “You back him as a fan he will sort it out but I hope the board will help him and learn from their past mistakes. “Great man, great coach! It’s a shame if he leaves Celtic his (sic) done a brilliant job there.” BBC Scotland’s chief sports writer Tom English drew a parallel between Postecoglou and a certain fictional football coach due to their remarkable ability to inspire their troops. “He understands what makes players tick, he commands respect, he has a presence, he’s a motivator and he’s got a good record in the transfer market,” English said on BBC Radio 5 Live . “His manta is ‘we never stop’. He likes to play his fast, dynamic and energetic football. I think he deserves a crack at [the Premier League]. “He’s a tough cookie, he’s not some kind of Australian Ted Lasso here, but he has an inspirational quality — he gets people and I think it will be fascinating to see how he does at Spurs.” Ange on verge of coaching Tottenham | 02:01 Former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp is also a big fan of the 57-year-old’s work and revealed it was an encounter with Tim Cahill when the former was manager of Jordan that woke him up to Postecoglou’s brilliance. “I’ve said before I met him out in Australia, when I went out and managed the Jordan national team, he managed the Australian team,” Redknapp said on talkSPORT . “Tim Cahill played for the Australian team and I was just chatting to him before the game and he said, ‘Our manager’s fantastic.’ “I said, ‘Really,’ he said, ‘Harry, he is top drawer,’ and that was it. I’d never heard of him at that time … Timmy Cahill said he was brilliant and that’s stuck with me. “Then I’ve watched how he’s done at Celtic and he’s been brilliant, I love him. “There’s no fannying [around] with him, he says it as it is, I like him. He don’t care, if a player misses a goal he’s not afraid to say, ‘My old woman could’ve scored that.’” Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan believes Postecoglou could have a galvanising impact on Spurs’ squad and indeed the club as a whole in a similar fashion to a certain German in Liverpool. “He might win a cup like (Antonio) Conte should have done,” Jordan said on talkSPORT . Postecoglou earned plenty of admirers during his two-year stint at Celtic. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images “I think it’s great for him. He’s got the character to galvanise and bring the fan base with him. It’s somewhat similar to the way Klopp did with Liverpool. “He’s an inclusive manager, he doesn’t seek to alienate or make little islands people sit on. “He will need to have the intrinsic value of everyone being together and get them going.” Although there may be some similarities Postecoglou shares with his predecessor Conte, namely their habit for picking up trophies wherever they go with the exception of Spurs for the latter, The Guardian’s David Hytner points out there are some stark differences. “Postecoglou is the counterpoint to Conte in several areas,” Hytner wrote. “He has a reputation to make and is willing to be patient, to rebuild with the staff and budgets he is given. “It is inescapable that Levy’s appointments of Conte and Mourinho, win-at-all-cost A-listers, with the emphasis on cost, blew up before they worked out.” However, it’s not all smiles and positivity from some surrounding Postecoglou’s looming appointment. The Telegraph’s Thom Gibbs pointed out success in Scotland “has rarely translated to glory in England” for those who make the immediate jump from the Scottish top flight to the Premier League since 2000. Former Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers was one relative exception as he guided Leicester to back-to-back fifth-place finishes and an FA Cup in 2021 but had the Foxes on a one-way ticket to the Championship this year.

Postecoglou helped Celtic complete the treble on Sunday. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images It’s why Gibbs holds fears for Postecoglou as he begins “adjusting from a small pond to shark-infested waters.” Despite Postecoglou arriving in London with a reputation for winning silverware — something Tottenham famously does not — Arsenal legend Martin Keown feels the Australian won’t be able to fill Spurs’ empty trophy cabinet. “I want to have respect for all managers, but I thought Conte was an outstanding manager,” Keown told talkSPORT . “That was my biggest fear actually [that Spurs would win trophies], because he was capable of doing special things. “Daniel Levy in 2021 was talking about a brand of football that he was looking for, whether or not this appointment is about that, whether or not he wants to see attractive football. “Of course he wants to see a trophy being won, but it [Postecoglou’s appointment] doesn’t really strike any fear into me no, not as Conte did.” Time will tell whether certain pundits are forced to eat their words in a similar vein to when Postecoglou silenced the doubters in his first season at Celtic. But the former Socceroos boss is going to become the name hot on everyone’s lips as he gears up for his first crack at a Premier League job.","pubDate":"2023-06-06 01:23:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Final step in Ange’s Spurs deal cleared as details over massive player clean-out revealed","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/premier-league/premier-league-2023-football-news-epl-ange-postecoglou-nears-tottenham-deal-spurs-transfers-loom-harry-kane-celtic/news-story/4a58c9690f4128653ae50f95458829b2","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s Ange Postecoglou could be confirmed as Tottenham’s new manager within hours after the Premier League club agreed compensation with Celtic.","content":"Australia’s Ange Postecoglou could be confirmed as Tottenham’s new manager within hours after the Premier League club agreed compensation with Celtic.

Daily Mirror reports that Brentford keeper David Raya is on the wishlist with veteran captain Hugo Lloris widely expected to leave this summer. Postecoglou’s attacking style demands a keeper who can play out from the back, and Raya is noted as a skilled ball-player who could fit the bill. Striking a deal could be tricky, however, with Brentford’s asking price reported by The Sun as £40 million ($75m), whereas Spurs only want to pay £20 (A$37.5m). Spurs reach 'verbal agreement' with Ange | 01:23 Meanwhile, valued at the same price of £40 million is another Spurs target in Leicester midfielder James Maddison. The Daily Mirror reports that Spurs would be willing to match a rival bid from Newcastle, which is also said to be eager to sign the 26-year-old. Wolves defender Max Kilman was a third target named in the Mirror report with Postecoglou potentially clearing house at Spurs — Eric Dier and Davinson Sanchez are defenders potentially being forced out the door. While it’s unclear how much Kilman would cost, his market value is considered to be in the region of £20-25 million (A$37.6m - A$47m).
