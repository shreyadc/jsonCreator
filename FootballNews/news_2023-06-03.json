That was the case for lifelong AFC Wimbledon supporters David Kenwery and Liam Nolan when property adjoining the club’s brand new stadium became available. Blocks of flats adjoin the AFC Wimbledon stadium in south west London Credit: Rex The development was supposed to provide ‘affordable’ homes for people struggling to get on the housing ladder – with the added perk that some flats overlook a football pitch Credit: Olivia West The friends bought a fourth floor two-bedroom, two-bathroom flat off-plan built within the grounds of the Cherry Red Records Stadium on Plough Lane – despite the fact neither of them live anywhere near it. Offshore wind farm site manager David is based in Hull, while IT consultant Liam, who grew up in the area, now works in Adelaide, Australia. But both men regularly make the trip to south west London to watch the EFL League Two team they have supported for 40 years. Flats like David and Liam’s now go for a hefty £570,000 – however David, 60, tells The Sun: “For a football fan, homes built into a ground is about as good as it gets. “How could I resist having a home next to the ground for match days?” But living above AFC Wimbledon’s pitch can come with some strange quirks – including one particular rule. On a residents forum for the flats, tenants claim they’re forbidden from hanging washing out on their balconies. Some of the flats offer a fantastic view of the pitch Credit: Getty Residents of the flashy Stadia apartments say the ground rent has rocketed Credit: Cascade News And when we visit, some tell us their ground rent – a maintenance fee for house buyers – has DOUBLED since they moved in, making their monthly costs now the same as a typical mortgage. Some tenants living in the flashy Stadia apartments run by Galliard Homes claim that as well as coughing up £500 a month in fees, they are being asked to pay a whopping £25,000 to use one of the spaces in the underground car park. Meanwhile people living nearby the new stadium claim their weekends can be fraught with hassle, with regular traffic jams and fans blocking drives and using their front gardens as a toilet. One young couple said they had paid £750,000 for a three-bedroom flat in the new development, where the shared ownership deals on offer meant some buyers only had to pay a portion of their home’s full value. The woman, 27, who declined to give her name, said: “Moving here allowed us to buy our first home so we were happy and grateful for that. “But they doubled the ground rent after we moved in, from £350 to £700, which was not what we were expecting. “We complained and it has now come down to about £500. But that’s still the same amount that some people will spend on their entire mortgage!” Like David and Liam’s, the couple’s apartment has a direct view of AFC Wimbledon’s pitch, which means they get a free view of the team’s games when they play – but they “don’t see it as a perk”. Some flat owners have moaned they can’t hang washing on their balconies Credit: Olivia West Traffic can be grid-locked on match days Credit: Olivia West The woman’s partner, also in his 20s, adds: “We can see the pitch from our window but – let’s be honest – they’re not the best football team. “Another issue is that they’re demanding £25,000 to buy a parking space in the flats, which is completely unaffordable. “And it seems that no-one here wants to pay that as the car park is always empty. It’s ridiculous.” Before they were unveiled a few years ago, developers Galliard Homes boasted that around a third of the 604 homes would be available through shared ownership, which would provide “luxury living to all levels of buyers”. The fact that a number of the apartments overlooked the football ground was also a key selling point – with AFC Wimbledon fans in particular keen to snap up the homes. Emotional return The Plough Lane stadium’s completion marked an emotional return for a football club that had been torn away from its natural home since 2002. That was the year the Football Association agreed the old Wimbledon F.C. could relocate 60 miles north to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire to prevent it from going bankrupt. The players were dubbed the ‘crazy gang’ in the 1980s because of their FA Cup winning heroics – upsetting Liverpool in the 1988 final – and the antics of club heroes like midfield hardman Vinnie Jones. So morphing into a new team called the MK Dons was never going to be accepted by the majority of supporters. Those that boycotted the move created AFC Wimbledon in its place and a window of opportunity emerged when Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium closed in 2017. The new AFC Wimbledon stadium is built on the site of an old dog track Credit: Olivia West Planning permission was won for a stadium to be built on the 12-acre site just 250 yards from the club’s original ground that closed down 30 years ago. Galliard Homes agreed to stump up £14million for the new 9,300 capacity ground on the proviso that a number of apartment buildings would be erected alongside it. The company claimed that with one-bedroom flats on offer from £425,000, it would be affordable for both first time buyers and local parents looking for buy-to-let opportunities. But the romantic vision of a small club finally finding a home isn’t shared by some who live in the area. Adam Pfeiffer, 52, lives on a small private road opposite the new ground and reminisces about the peaceful weekends he used to enjoy before the club returned. Mechanic Adam says: “It’s a nightmare living here now and I don’t even like football. “The fans take the p***. They park wherever they want and litter all over the street. I regularly spot people using my front garden as a toilet on weekends.” On ‘event days’ you have to pay £3.20 for one hour Credit: Olivia West Business owners like Andrew Yeates are getting cheesed off with the new stadium Credit: Olivia West Kris McKnight runs BB Plumbers close to the stadium. He says: “The dogs stadium was falling to bits so I guess they needed to do something, but it’s a shame that they got rid of it. “It was the last dog track in England and it was a great night out when you won.” Business owners are also getting cheesed off with the new stadium because they are now being made to pay £3.20 an hour for parking on match days. Andrew Yeates – director of the local Balloon and Kite Company – says: “The only real impact is the parking restrictions. “On ‘event days’ you have to pay and display for one hour and that makes parking more difficult. “We have to pay for the hour when we are working and then move it around, or we have to park a long way away. “The biggest complaint I have is that you don’t always know when it’s an event day so you can get caught out. If you don’t know, you get a ticket, it’s that simple.” ‘Traffic is gridlocked’ Roldan Aquino says the new development is a nightmare for traffic in the area, which was already congested Credit: Olivia West Roldan Aquino, 50, helps run a food truck opposite the stadium where gourmet burgers cost £9. He says traffic is frequently gridlocked around the new stadium. “It can be a nightmare some days,” he says. “When there are temporary traffic lights here for whatever reason, it completely kills the business – people can’t get through and a 10 minute drive takes about three hours.” But not every business owner is downcast about the new development. Ania Ridley, 40, is landlady at the The Corner Pin pub where a pint of lager costs £5.10. She says: “I’ve worked here for 21 years and when the stadium was first built, I was worried because we all know what football fans can be like. “But the ones that come here are really nice and polite – they even apologise if they spill their drinks. “And the development has brought in new people and younger people into the area, which is great for the pub. “It used to be mainly old people popping in for a drink but we have a younger crowd now and they are more likely to spend money. “I think the new flats have given the whole area a boost.” The landlady of The Corner Pin pub, Ania Ridley, has welcomed the new development Credit: Olivia West A spokesperson for Galliard Homes said: “The Wimbledon Grounds development has been a resounding success, offering significant benefits to the local community. “One of the notable achievements of this project was the successful return of AFC Wimbledon to Plough Lane, made possible through our financial support and the generous gifting of land to the football club. “The Wimbledon Grounds development was undertaken as a joint venture partnership with The Peabody Trust, previously known as Catalyst Housing Association. Due to this partnership, we were able to achieve a significant increase in the number of affordable housing units, rising from an initial 60 to an impressive 181. These units were subsequently transferred to Catalyst Housing Association, who oversaw the sales and management of them as shared equity properties. “Parking was offered as an additional cost, due to the limited number of parking spaces available for the private units. Most spaces were held by Catalyst Housing Association for use of the affordable units. “The ground rents for the properties were determined in the traditional manner, based on the size of each flat. The initial rate was set at 0.1% of the property price, followed by a nominal peppercorn amount in subsequent years.” Publisher","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:39:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"insidexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"USMA : Zemmaouche le survivant de 2015","link":"https://www.dzfoot.com/football-en-algerie/usma-zemmaouche-le-survivant-de-2015-242982.html?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=unknown","keywords":["Football en Algérie","Coupes"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"De la première finale africaine de l'USM Alger en 2015, il ne subsiste qu'un seul joueur, le gardien Mohamed Lamine Zemmaouche qui à 38 ans entame une pré-retraite reste toujours proche du terrain.

En 2013 il est dans les buts quand l'USMA gagne la Coupe Arabe face à Al Arabi, en 2015 il est le gardien malheureux en finale face au TP Mazembe en finale de Ligue des Champions à Bologhine. C'était encore lui le gardien en 2017 quand l'USM Alger est sortie cette fois en demi-finale de C1 par le Wydad Casablanca. Il est encore de la dernière grande déception usmiste en 2018 avec une défaire en 1/4 de finale de la Coupe de la CAF 1-0 contre Al Masry à Sétif.

He blocked for John Elway in a pro career that stretched well over a decade. Since retiring with two Super Bowl rings on his fingers, he has worked for ESPN as a broadcaster and helped coach in the NFL. Now, Diaz-Infante is coming home. And to hear him tell it, he couldn’t be happier about moving from Arizona to take over as the football coach of his high school alma mater, Bellarmine College Prep. “No one has what Bellarmine has,” Diaz-Infante, 59, told the Bay Area News Group. “That’s the history and tradition of one of the oldest high schools in the state of California and with a rich and incredible tradition of football and doing great things.” Diaz-Infante’s buddies from back when he was a team captain at the San Jose Jesuit school in the early 1980s nudged him toward adding his name to the list of candidates when Jalal Beauchman in late March. Friday, Bellarmine announced that . “It’s been an interesting journey in itself, much like my journey,” Diaz-Infante said with a laugh. At first, Diaz-Infante wasn’t sure he wanted to leave his home of 15 years in Arizona, his family’s bubble of friends and interests. But the more calls he received about the Bellarmine opening, the more sense it made to apply. Diaz-Infante played on the school’s first Central Coast Section championship team in 1981. “This is the way I can have an impact on some young men like Bellarmine had an impact on me,” Diaz-Infante said. “I’ve been blessed to be around a lot of good coaches and teachers of the game. The game has been good to me, and I think I have been good to the game.” Diaz-Infante called his time with Denver in the late-1990s the highlight of his playing career, which included stops in the World League of American Football and the Canadian Football League. With Denver, Diaz-Infante said he made his living as a sixth man on the line. “I always tell people, ‘Look, I was a good player. I was not a great player. But I learned what it meant to be a great teammate,” Diaz-Infante said. “That’s what it takes to win it all. It was really special to be a part of those teams. “Our offensive line probably epitomized that more than anything, of what it takes to win and the work you have to put in and the dedication and the unselfishness.” No doubt, those are intangibles that Diaz-Infante will try to instill in his new team. The coach spent 20 minutes on Friday in a phone interview with the Bay Area News Group. Here is what he said (edited for clarity and brevity): What is your plan of attack, given that it’s early June and the season is just a few months away? “I am in discussions with people right now (for the staff). I have some people that have been around the game for a long time that have expressed interest in working with me and we’re working on some of those details right now. Guys that have a lot more experience than me. … We’re going to have some great coaches and some great teachers and that’ll help the program all the way through. Guys with experience and guys that love the game and share the same values. I am so excited about that because I don’t know it all. But I made a living being coachable, and I’ll remain coachable. I’ve been around some great coaches and I’ve always taken note of how they do things and why they do them. I’ve been around them when they work and when they don’t work.” Ideally, when would you want to meet with your team? “I plan on getting back early next week and stopping by myself. Introduce myself to the team.” The West Catholic Athletic League has changed quite a bit since you were playing for the Bells. As you look at the landscape of the league, what do you see? “Like it always has been, I see one of the best leagues there is. There is probably more parity today than ever with the addition of Valley Christian (in the early 2000s) and I know Serra is a very good football team and St. Francis and Mitty. Shoot, everybody is good — SI, Riordan and Sacred Heart. The league is as tough as it’s ever been. There are some great coaches.” Not a lot of people go from Arizona to San Jose these days. (Diaz-Infante will also have a staff position with Bellarmine’s Office of Advancement, according to the school.) (Laughs). “The more me and my wife talked and my kids — they’re grown but we always make decisions as a family — they said, ‘You’ve got to do it.’ I’m really humbled by the opportunity, that people thought that highly of me to really put the full-court press on me. And I’ll be home. I used to always tell people, I’ll always be a Bell and San Jose will always be my home. And, obviously, I enjoyed a great deal of success at San Jose State as well. It’s very near and dear to my heart. I still have a lot of incredible friends and family (in the area).” Mark Schlereth (now a broadcaster) was on those Denver offensive lines. What does he think about your new job? “He’s one of my best friends. I am going to see him tomorrow. He’ll be down to visit I am sure when I am coaching there. He was as excited as I was, I think. That’s the kind of relationship we have. I would practice for him when his body was too beat up. We’ve remained close over the years because of those things.”","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:30:58","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BNG-L-BELLARMINE-1203-6.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bob Raissman: Be a shock if Tom Brady bailed on Fox TV gig to return to the field","link":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/06/03/bob-raissman-be-a-shock-if-tom-brady-bailed-on-fox-tv-gig-to-return-to-the-field/","keywords":["NFL","Sports"],"creator":["Tribune News Service"],"video_url":null,"description":"When May turned into June, Aaron Rodgers had company when it came to generating NFL buzz.

There was Patrick Mahomes and questions about whether he is capable of building a dynasty in Kansas City. Then there was the man who supposedly won’t set foot on the field again — the budding TV star, Tom Brady. Suddenly, after he purchased a stake in the team, and because of , speculation bubbled about Brady ending up quarterbacking the Las Vegas Raiders. On Thursday, even after Brady told Sports Illustrated’s Robin Lundberg: it didn’t deter some of the football cognoscenti from speculating that once training camp rolls around, Brady could get the itch to return to the field. Brady wants to shut the spec down, but the hubbub is terrific for his nascent TV career at Fox Sports, where he’s currently the number-one-game-analyst-in waiting, scheduled to enter the booth in the 2024 season and replace Greg Olsen. Brady’s ability to sustain buzz and generate attention is just one reason Fox suits signed him to . That he’s taking a year off before starting the gig signifies his commitment to TV. With Brady taking the 2023 season “off,” Fox has an unprecedented opportunity to tutor Brady. He will have the freedom to do “practice” games from an auxiliary booth in stadiums during live action. He also can get a feel of what his routine will be like during the season. Fox execs will also have the time to start “horse trading” for marquee matchup games for Brady to work in 2024. There are other valid reasons why Brady’s playing days should be over. 1) The Fox contract. Just over $37 million per to work basically once a week for five months a year is incentive enough. 2) More importantly: Brady’s made a career of hard work, preparation, determination, dedication and proving people wrong. That’s his motivation. It will be no different in TV, especially when other networks, Valley of the Stupid Gasbags, and broadcasting agents start sniping at him and nitpicking his performance in the booth. Finally, never once in his storied career has Brady backed down from a challenge, which TV — initially — will be. Those who say Brady has changed his mind before are correct. Yet this is a different time in his life. To see him bail on Fox would be a shocker. If anyone thinks Brady being a part owner of the Raiders will be seen by the NFL as a conflict of interest, or short-circuit his Fox gig, keeping him out of the network’s NFL booth, think again. TV executives and leagues have already set precedent in that regard. Earvin (Magic) Johnson was a panelist on ESPN/ABC’s “NBA Countdown” when he owned an undisclosed stake in the Lakers. If the NFL was concerned with conflicts they could “remind” Fox that Brady should not work any Raiders games. Or just spin it, saying Brady has the chops to be impartial. And he doesn’t believe in passing info from coach to coach. Pat McAfee, and his viewers/listeners have been fretting over whether his show, with its cast of thousands, will change when it moves to ESPN. An inordinate amount of time has been used to ponder this life-or-death question. Moses, er, McAfee has already come down from the mountaintop to deliver his I-got-to-be-me sermon to a few different outlets. Another question worth squeezing in is: Will the coming of McAfee’s show change the way other ESPN programs do business? After all, ESPN boss Jimmy Pitaro has described how McAfee, and his show, generates “audience expansion.” So, ESPN producers know, even if just in the back of their mind, “what Jimmy wants.” Nonetheless, for the past couple of years, ESPN has spent time emphasizing the benefits of hard news (”Get Up,” “This Just In”) and a more measured approach. The rationale is, for example, when hard news breaks on “First Take,” it will dominate the show, no matter what the plan is. Same holds true on “NFL Live” and “NBA Today.” McAfee’s soiree is more free-form. The show can get into personal issues as well as dissecting games and newsy/noisy interviews, like . ESPN is betting $85 million over five years that McAfee’s show will attract new eyeballs to ESPN. If it does, will other ESPN offerings mimic it? For the old adage in sports TV is this: Stealing is believing. Michael Kay did an admirable job of shielding the Yankees from criticism about their streaming situation, until his shell game became apparent. Yankee games streaming on Peacock and Apple+? “The Yankees had nothing to do with games on Apple and Peacock. That’s the greed of Major League Baseball…,” Kay said on his ESPN-98.7 show. Well, what is MLB? It’s actually a company operated and owned by the baseball owners, including Yankee boss Hal Steinbrenner. He has to sign off on these TV deals so you CAN blame the Yankees for Apple+ and Peacock. And the 20 games the Yankees stream on Amazon Prime Video used to be on “free” TV Ch.11 where a subscription fee was not necessary. The Knicks parted ways with GM Scott Perry and team prez Leon (Sphinx) Rose was nowhere to be found to explain why. How shocking! … Talk about an unprecedented NFL season. While remote, there is actually a possibility in December out of those windows (TNF, SNF, and MNF) and three more attractive games to be flexed in. That’s 12 teams out of 32 in the league in the entire league being impacted by Roger Goodell’s determination to boost viewership numbers, which in many cases are already spectacular. … Peter Rosenberg (ESPN-98.7) recently made plenty of sense when he pointed out the ridiculous nature of trying to micro-analyze Mets and Yankees games, the day after on a daily basis, during what is the longest season. He didn’t come out and say the day-after analysis makes for boring, repetitive, radio, but came awfully close. Bravo! … Don La Greca, on 98.7, neatly straddled the line between lunacy and passion last Wednesday when he defended the “sanctity” of the Yankees jersey, railing against those who would allow any sort of advertising on the uniform top. Ironically Michael Kay didn’t have a problem with an ad patch. Remember? This is the guy who, when describing the back of the Yankee jersey during radiocasts, coined the phrase, “no name….of course” and made it famous. * * * For his creativity and consistency. The veteran producer (27 years) of TNT’s critically acclaimed “Inside the NBA,” retired following the Eastern Conference Finals. Kiely did so knowing he ushered in and developed a studio show that maintained its quality, energy and quirkiness. For hyping a CBS Mornings’ “interview” with Alex Rodriguez as “exclusive.” The spot was basically an infomercial where A-Rod “revealed” he had recently been diagnosed with gum disease and has partnered with a health company to help raise “awareness” about the ailment. What said: “I’m certain I’m not playing again, so I’ve tried to make that clear, and I hate to continue to profess that….” What meant to say: “At least for today, I’m certain I’m not playing again.” ()","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:14:36","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306030814TMS_____MNGTRPUB_SPORTS-BOB-RAISSMAN-BE-SHOCK-IF-TOM-1-NY5.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Реал підтвердив відхід Асенсіо","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/06/03/930895/real-pidtverdyv-vidkhid-asensio","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Півзахисник Реала Марко Асенсіо залишить клуб влітку.Про це повідомляє пресслужба мадридського клубу.Гравець піде з команди після закінчення сезону.

That was the case for lifelong AFC Wimbledon supporters David Kenwery and Liam Nolan when property adjoining the club’s brand new stadium became available. Blocks of flats adjoin the AFC Wimbledon stadium in south west London Credit: Rex The development was supposed to provide ‘affordable’ homes for people struggling to get on the housing ladder – with the added perk that some flats overlook a football pitch Credit: Olivia West The friends bought a fourth floor two-bedroom, two-bathroom flat off-plan built within the grounds of the Cherry Red Records Stadium on Plough Lane – despite the fact neither of them live anywhere near it. Offshore wind farm site manager David is based in Hull, while IT consultant Liam, who grew up in the area, now works in Adelaide, Australia. But both men regularly make the trip to south west London to watch the EFL League Two team they have supported for 40 years. Flats like David and Liam’s now go for a hefty £570,000 – however David, 60, tells The Sun: “For a football fan, homes built into a ground is about as good as it gets. “How could I resist having a home next to the ground for match days?” But living above AFC Wimbledon’s pitch can come with some strange quirks – including one particular rule. On a residents forum for the flats, tenants claim they’re forbidden from hanging washing out on their balconies. Some of the flats offer a fantastic view of the pitch Credit: Getty Residents of the flashy Stadia apartments say the ground rent has rocketed Credit: Cascade News And when we visit, some tell us their ground rent – a maintenance fee for house buyers – has DOUBLED since they moved in, making their monthly costs now the same as a typical mortgage. Some tenants living in the flashy Stadia apartments run by Galliard Homes claim that as well as coughing up £500 a month in fees, they are being asked to pay a whopping £25,000 to use one of the spaces in the underground car park. Meanwhile people living nearby the new stadium claim their weekends can be fraught with hassle, with regular traffic jams and fans blocking drives and using their front gardens as a toilet. One young couple said they had paid £750,000 for a three-bedroom flat in the new development, where the shared ownership deals on offer meant some buyers only had to pay a portion of their home’s full value. The woman, 27, who declined to give her name, said: “Moving here allowed us to buy our first home so we were happy and grateful for that. “But they doubled the ground rent after we moved in, from £350 to £700, which was not what we were expecting. “We complained and it has now come down to about £500. But that’s still the same amount that some people will spend on their entire mortgage!” Like David and Liam’s, the couple’s apartment has a direct view of AFC Wimbledon’s pitch, which means they get a free view of the team’s games when they play – but they “don’t see it as a perk”. Some flat owners have moaned they can’t hang washing on their balconies Credit: Olivia West Traffic can be grid-locked on match days Credit: Olivia West The woman’s partner, also in his 20s, adds: “We can see the pitch from our window but – let’s be honest – they’re not the best football team. “Another issue is that they’re demanding £25,000 to buy a parking space in the flats, which is completely unaffordable. “And it seems that no-one here wants to pay that as the car park is always empty. It’s ridiculous.” Before they were unveiled a few years ago, developers Galliard Homes boasted that around a third of the 604 homes would be available through shared ownership, which would provide “luxury living to all levels of buyers”. The fact that a number of the apartments overlooked the football ground was also a key selling point – with AFC Wimbledon fans in particular keen to snap up the homes. Emotional return The Plough Lane stadium’s completion marked an emotional return for a football club that had been torn away from its natural home since 2002. That was the year the Football Association agreed the old Wimbledon F.C. could relocate 60 miles north to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire to prevent it from going bankrupt. The players were dubbed the ‘crazy gang’ in the 1980s because of their FA Cup winning heroics – upsetting Liverpool in the 1988 final – and the antics of club heroes like midfield hardman Vinnie Jones. So morphing into a new team called the MK Dons was never going to be accepted by the majority of supporters. Those that boycotted the move created AFC Wimbledon in its place and a window of opportunity emerged when Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium closed in 2017. The new AFC Wimbledon stadium is built on the site of an old dog track Credit: Olivia West Planning permission was won for a stadium to be built on the 12-acre site just 250 yards from the club’s original ground that closed down 30 years ago. Galliard Homes agreed to stump up £14million for the new 9,300 capacity ground on the proviso that a number of apartment buildings would be erected alongside it. The company claimed that with one-bedroom flats on offer from £425,000, it would be affordable for both first time buyers and local parents looking for buy-to-let opportunities. But the romantic vision of a small club finally finding a home isn’t shared by some who live in the area. Adam Pfeiffer, 52, lives on a small private road opposite the new ground and reminisces about the peaceful weekends he used to enjoy before the club returned. Mechanic Adam says: “It’s a nightmare living here now and I don’t even like football. “The fans take the p***. They park wherever they want and litter all over the street. I regularly spot people using my front garden as a toilet on weekends.” On ‘event days’ you have to pay £3.20 for one hour Credit: Olivia West Business owners like Andrew Yeates are getting cheesed off with the new stadium Credit: Olivia West Kris McKnight runs BB Plumbers close to the stadium. He says: “The dogs stadium was falling to bits so I guess they needed to do something, but it’s a shame that they got rid of it. “It was the last dog track in England and it was a great night out when you won.” Business owners are also getting cheesed off with the new stadium because they are now being made to pay £3.20 an hour for parking on match days. Andrew Yeates – director of the local Balloon and Kite Company – says: “The only real impact is the parking restrictions. “On ‘event days’ you have to pay and display for one hour and that makes parking more difficult. “We have to pay for the hour when we are working and then move it around, or we have to park a long way away. “The biggest complaint I have is that you don’t always know when it’s an event day so you can get caught out. If you don’t know, you get a ticket, it’s that simple.” ‘Traffic is gridlocked’ Roldan Aquino says the new development is a nightmare for traffic in the area, which was already congested Credit: Olivia West Roldan Aquino, 50, helps run a food truck opposite the stadium where gourmet burgers cost £9. He says traffic is frequently gridlocked around the new stadium. “It can be a nightmare some days,” he says. “When there are temporary traffic lights here for whatever reason, it completely kills the business – people can’t get through and a 10 minute drive takes about three hours.” But not every business owner is downcast about the new development. Ania Ridley, 40, is landlady at the The Corner Pin pub where a pint of lager costs £5.10. She says: “I’ve worked here for 21 years and when the stadium was first built, I was worried because we all know what football fans can be like. “But the ones that come here are really nice and polite – they even apologise if they spill their drinks. “And the development has brought in new people and younger people into the area, which is great for the pub. “It used to be mainly old people popping in for a drink but we have a younger crowd now and they are more likely to spend money. “I think the new flats have given the whole area a boost.” The landlady of The Corner Pin pub, Ania Ridley, has welcomed the new development Credit: Olivia West A spokesperson for Galliard Homes said: “The Wimbledon Grounds development has been a resounding success, offering significant benefits to the local community. “One of the notable achievements of this project was the successful return of AFC Wimbledon to Plough Lane, made possible through our financial support and the generous gifting of land to the football club. “The Wimbledon Grounds development was undertaken as a joint venture partnership with The Peabody Trust, previously known as Catalyst Housing Association. Due to this partnership, we were able to achieve a significant increase in the number of affordable housing units, rising from an initial 60 to an impressive 181. These units were subsequently transferred to Catalyst Housing Association, who oversaw the sales and management of them as shared equity properties. “Parking was offered as an additional cost, due to the limited number of parking spaces available for the private units. Most spaces were held by Catalyst Housing Association for use of the affordable units. “The ground rents for the properties were determined in the traditional manner, based on the size of each flat. The initial rate was set at 0.1% of the property price, followed by a nominal peppercorn amount in subsequent years.” Publisher","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:39:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"insidexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"USMA : Zemmaouche le survivant de 2015","link":"https://www.dzfoot.com/football-en-algerie/usma-zemmaouche-le-survivant-de-2015-242982.html?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=unknown","keywords":["Football en Algérie","Coupes"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"De la première finale africaine de l'USM Alger en 2015, il ne subsiste qu'un seul joueur, le gardien Mohamed Lamine Zemmaouche qui à 38 ans entame une pré-retraite reste toujours proche du terrain.

He blocked for John Elway in a pro career that stretched well over a decade. Since retiring with two Super Bowl rings on his fingers, he has worked for ESPN as a broadcaster and helped coach in the NFL. Now, Diaz-Infante is coming home. And to hear him tell it, he couldn’t be happier about moving from Arizona to take over as the football coach of his high school alma mater, Bellarmine College Prep. “No one has what Bellarmine has,” Diaz-Infante, 59, told the Bay Area News Group. “That’s the history and tradition of one of the oldest high schools in the state of California and with a rich and incredible tradition of football and doing great things.” Diaz-Infante’s buddies from back when he was a team captain at the San Jose Jesuit school in the early 1980s nudged him toward adding his name to the list of candidates when Jalal Beauchman in late March. Friday, Bellarmine announced that . “It’s been an interesting journey in itself, much like my journey,” Diaz-Infante said with a laugh. At first, Diaz-Infante wasn’t sure he wanted to leave his home of 15 years in Arizona, his family’s bubble of friends and interests. But the more calls he received about the Bellarmine opening, the more sense it made to apply. Diaz-Infante played on the school’s first Central Coast Section championship team in 1981. “This is the way I can have an impact on some young men like Bellarmine had an impact on me,” Diaz-Infante said. “I’ve been blessed to be around a lot of good coaches and teachers of the game. The game has been good to me, and I think I have been good to the game.” Diaz-Infante called his time with Denver in the late-1990s the highlight of his playing career, which included stops in the World League of American Football and the Canadian Football League. With Denver, Diaz-Infante said he made his living as a sixth man on the line. “I always tell people, ‘Look, I was a good player. I was not a great player. But I learned what it meant to be a great teammate,” Diaz-Infante said. “That’s what it takes to win it all. It was really special to be a part of those teams. “Our offensive line probably epitomized that more than anything, of what it takes to win and the work you have to put in and the dedication and the unselfishness.” No doubt, those are intangibles that Diaz-Infante will try to instill in his new team. The coach spent 20 minutes on Friday in a phone interview with the Bay Area News Group. Here is what he said (edited for clarity and brevity): What is your plan of attack, given that it’s early June and the season is just a few months away? “I am in discussions with people right now (for the staff). I have some people that have been around the game for a long time that have expressed interest in working with me and we’re working on some of those details right now. Guys that have a lot more experience than me. … We’re going to have some great coaches and some great teachers and that’ll help the program all the way through. Guys with experience and guys that love the game and share the same values. I am so excited about that because I don’t know it all. But I made a living being coachable, and I’ll remain coachable. I’ve been around some great coaches and I’ve always taken note of how they do things and why they do them. I’ve been around them when they work and when they don’t work.” Ideally, when would you want to meet with your team? “I plan on getting back early next week and stopping by myself. Introduce myself to the team.” The West Catholic Athletic League has changed quite a bit since you were playing for the Bells. As you look at the landscape of the league, what do you see? “Like it always has been, I see one of the best leagues there is. There is probably more parity today than ever with the addition of Valley Christian (in the early 2000s) and I know Serra is a very good football team and St. Francis and Mitty. Shoot, everybody is good — SI, Riordan and Sacred Heart. The league is as tough as it’s ever been. There are some great coaches.” Not a lot of people go from Arizona to San Jose these days. (Diaz-Infante will also have a staff position with Bellarmine’s Office of Advancement, according to the school.) (Laughs). “The more me and my wife talked and my kids — they’re grown but we always make decisions as a family — they said, ‘You’ve got to do it.’ I’m really humbled by the opportunity, that people thought that highly of me to really put the full-court press on me. And I’ll be home. I used to always tell people, I’ll always be a Bell and San Jose will always be my home. And, obviously, I enjoyed a great deal of success at San Jose State as well. It’s very near and dear to my heart. I still have a lot of incredible friends and family (in the area).” Mark Schlereth (now a broadcaster) was on those Denver offensive lines. What does he think about your new job? “He’s one of my best friends. I am going to see him tomorrow. He’ll be down to visit I am sure when I am coaching there. He was as excited as I was, I think. That’s the kind of relationship we have. I would practice for him when his body was too beat up. We’ve remained close over the years because of those things.”","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:30:58","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BNG-L-BELLARMINE-1203-6.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bob Raissman: Be a shock if Tom Brady bailed on Fox TV gig to return to the field","link":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/06/03/bob-raissman-be-a-shock-if-tom-brady-bailed-on-fox-tv-gig-to-return-to-the-field/","keywords":["NFL","Sports"],"creator":["Tribune News Service"],"video_url":null,"description":"When May turned into June, Aaron Rodgers had company when it came to generating NFL buzz.

There was Patrick Mahomes and questions about whether he is capable of building a dynasty in Kansas City. Then there was the man who supposedly won’t set foot on the field again — the budding TV star, Tom Brady. Suddenly, after he purchased a stake in the team, and because of , speculation bubbled about Brady ending up quarterbacking the Las Vegas Raiders. On Thursday, even after Brady told Sports Illustrated’s Robin Lundberg: it didn’t deter some of the football cognoscenti from speculating that once training camp rolls around, Brady could get the itch to return to the field. Brady wants to shut the spec down, but the hubbub is terrific for his nascent TV career at Fox Sports, where he’s currently the number-one-game-analyst-in waiting, scheduled to enter the booth in the 2024 season and replace Greg Olsen. Brady’s ability to sustain buzz and generate attention is just one reason Fox suits signed him to . That he’s taking a year off before starting the gig signifies his commitment to TV. With Brady taking the 2023 season “off,” Fox has an unprecedented opportunity to tutor Brady. He will have the freedom to do “practice” games from an auxiliary booth in stadiums during live action. He also can get a feel of what his routine will be like during the season. Fox execs will also have the time to start “horse trading” for marquee matchup games for Brady to work in 2024. There are other valid reasons why Brady’s playing days should be over. 1) The Fox contract. Just over $37 million per to work basically once a week for five months a year is incentive enough. 2) More importantly: Brady’s made a career of hard work, preparation, determination, dedication and proving people wrong. That’s his motivation. It will be no different in TV, especially when other networks, Valley of the Stupid Gasbags, and broadcasting agents start sniping at him and nitpicking his performance in the booth. Finally, never once in his storied career has Brady backed down from a challenge, which TV — initially — will be. Those who say Brady has changed his mind before are correct. Yet this is a different time in his life. To see him bail on Fox would be a shocker. If anyone thinks Brady being a part owner of the Raiders will be seen by the NFL as a conflict of interest, or short-circuit his Fox gig, keeping him out of the network’s NFL booth, think again. TV executives and leagues have already set precedent in that regard. Earvin (Magic) Johnson was a panelist on ESPN/ABC’s “NBA Countdown” when he owned an undisclosed stake in the Lakers. If the NFL was concerned with conflicts they could “remind” Fox that Brady should not work any Raiders games. Or just spin it, saying Brady has the chops to be impartial. And he doesn’t believe in passing info from coach to coach. Pat McAfee, and his viewers/listeners have been fretting over whether his show, with its cast of thousands, will change when it moves to ESPN. An inordinate amount of time has been used to ponder this life-or-death question. Moses, er, McAfee has already come down from the mountaintop to deliver his I-got-to-be-me sermon to a few different outlets. Another question worth squeezing in is: Will the coming of McAfee’s show change the way other ESPN programs do business? After all, ESPN boss Jimmy Pitaro has described how McAfee, and his show, generates “audience expansion.” So, ESPN producers know, even if just in the back of their mind, “what Jimmy wants.” Nonetheless, for the past couple of years, ESPN has spent time emphasizing the benefits of hard news (”Get Up,” “This Just In”) and a more measured approach. The rationale is, for example, when hard news breaks on “First Take,” it will dominate the show, no matter what the plan is. Same holds true on “NFL Live” and “NBA Today.” McAfee’s soiree is more free-form. The show can get into personal issues as well as dissecting games and newsy/noisy interviews, like . ESPN is betting $85 million over five years that McAfee’s show will attract new eyeballs to ESPN. If it does, will other ESPN offerings mimic it? For the old adage in sports TV is this: Stealing is believing. Michael Kay did an admirable job of shielding the Yankees from criticism about their streaming situation, until his shell game became apparent. Yankee games streaming on Peacock and Apple+? “The Yankees had nothing to do with games on Apple and Peacock. That’s the greed of Major League Baseball…,” Kay said on his ESPN-98.7 show. Well, what is MLB? It’s actually a company operated and owned by the baseball owners, including Yankee boss Hal Steinbrenner. He has to sign off on these TV deals so you CAN blame the Yankees for Apple+ and Peacock. And the 20 games the Yankees stream on Amazon Prime Video used to be on “free” TV Ch.11 where a subscription fee was not necessary. The Knicks parted ways with GM Scott Perry and team prez Leon (Sphinx) Rose was nowhere to be found to explain why. How shocking! … Talk about an unprecedented NFL season. While remote, there is actually a possibility in December out of those windows (TNF, SNF, and MNF) and three more attractive games to be flexed in. That’s 12 teams out of 32 in the league in the entire league being impacted by Roger Goodell’s determination to boost viewership numbers, which in many cases are already spectacular. … Peter Rosenberg (ESPN-98.7) recently made plenty of sense when he pointed out the ridiculous nature of trying to micro-analyze Mets and Yankees games, the day after on a daily basis, during what is the longest season. He didn’t come out and say the day-after analysis makes for boring, repetitive, radio, but came awfully close. Bravo! … Don La Greca, on 98.7, neatly straddled the line between lunacy and passion last Wednesday when he defended the “sanctity” of the Yankees jersey, railing against those who would allow any sort of advertising on the uniform top. Ironically Michael Kay didn’t have a problem with an ad patch. Remember? This is the guy who, when describing the back of the Yankee jersey during radiocasts, coined the phrase, “no name….of course” and made it famous. * * * For his creativity and consistency. The veteran producer (27 years) of TNT’s critically acclaimed “Inside the NBA,” retired following the Eastern Conference Finals. Kiely did so knowing he ushered in and developed a studio show that maintained its quality, energy and quirkiness. For hyping a CBS Mornings’ “interview” with Alex Rodriguez as “exclusive.” The spot was basically an infomercial where A-Rod “revealed” he had recently been diagnosed with gum disease and has partnered with a health company to help raise “awareness” about the ailment. What said: “I’m certain I’m not playing again, so I’ve tried to make that clear, and I hate to continue to profess that….” What meant to say: “At least for today, I’m certain I’m not playing again.” ()","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:14:36","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306030814TMS_____MNGTRPUB_SPORTS-BOB-RAISSMAN-BE-SHOCK-IF-TOM-1-NY5.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Реал підтвердив відхід Асенсіо","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/06/03/930895/real-pidtverdyv-vidkhid-asensio","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Півзахисник Реала Марко Асенсіо залишить клуб влітку.Про це повідомляє пресслужба мадридського клубу.Гравець піде з команди після закінчення сезону.

That was the case for lifelong AFC Wimbledon supporters David Kenwery and Liam Nolan when property adjoining the club’s brand new stadium became available. Blocks of flats adjoin the AFC Wimbledon stadium in south west London Credit: Rex The development was supposed to provide ‘affordable’ homes for people struggling to get on the housing ladder – with the added perk that some flats overlook a football pitch Credit: Olivia West The friends bought a fourth floor two-bedroom, two-bathroom flat off-plan built within the grounds of the Cherry Red Records Stadium on Plough Lane – despite the fact neither of them live anywhere near it. Offshore wind farm site manager David is based in Hull, while IT consultant Liam, who grew up in the area, now works in Adelaide, Australia. But both men regularly make the trip to south west London to watch the EFL League Two team they have supported for 40 years. Flats like David and Liam’s now go for a hefty £570,000 – however David, 60, tells The Sun: “For a football fan, homes built into a ground is about as good as it gets. “How could I resist having a home next to the ground for match days?” But living above AFC Wimbledon’s pitch can come with some strange quirks – including one particular rule. On a residents forum for the flats, tenants claim they’re forbidden from hanging washing out on their balconies. Some of the flats offer a fantastic view of the pitch Credit: Getty Residents of the flashy Stadia apartments say the ground rent has rocketed Credit: Cascade News And when we visit, some tell us their ground rent – a maintenance fee for house buyers – has DOUBLED since they moved in, making their monthly costs now the same as a typical mortgage. Some tenants living in the flashy Stadia apartments run by Galliard Homes claim that as well as coughing up £500 a month in fees, they are being asked to pay a whopping £25,000 to use one of the spaces in the underground car park. Meanwhile people living nearby the new stadium claim their weekends can be fraught with hassle, with regular traffic jams and fans blocking drives and using their front gardens as a toilet. One young couple said they had paid £750,000 for a three-bedroom flat in the new development, where the shared ownership deals on offer meant some buyers only had to pay a portion of their home’s full value. The woman, 27, who declined to give her name, said: “Moving here allowed us to buy our first home so we were happy and grateful for that. “But they doubled the ground rent after we moved in, from £350 to £700, which was not what we were expecting. “We complained and it has now come down to about £500. But that’s still the same amount that some people will spend on their entire mortgage!” Like David and Liam’s, the couple’s apartment has a direct view of AFC Wimbledon’s pitch, which means they get a free view of the team’s games when they play – but they “don’t see it as a perk”. Some flat owners have moaned they can’t hang washing on their balconies Credit: Olivia West Traffic can be grid-locked on match days Credit: Olivia West The woman’s partner, also in his 20s, adds: “We can see the pitch from our window but – let’s be honest – they’re not the best football team. “Another issue is that they’re demanding £25,000 to buy a parking space in the flats, which is completely unaffordable. “And it seems that no-one here wants to pay that as the car park is always empty. It’s ridiculous.” Before they were unveiled a few years ago, developers Galliard Homes boasted that around a third of the 604 homes would be available through shared ownership, which would provide “luxury living to all levels of buyers”. The fact that a number of the apartments overlooked the football ground was also a key selling point – with AFC Wimbledon fans in particular keen to snap up the homes. Emotional return The Plough Lane stadium’s completion marked an emotional return for a football club that had been torn away from its natural home since 2002. That was the year the Football Association agreed the old Wimbledon F.C. could relocate 60 miles north to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire to prevent it from going bankrupt. The players were dubbed the ‘crazy gang’ in the 1980s because of their FA Cup winning heroics – upsetting Liverpool in the 1988 final – and the antics of club heroes like midfield hardman Vinnie Jones. So morphing into a new team called the MK Dons was never going to be accepted by the majority of supporters. Those that boycotted the move created AFC Wimbledon in its place and a window of opportunity emerged when Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium closed in 2017. The new AFC Wimbledon stadium is built on the site of an old dog track Credit: Olivia West Planning permission was won for a stadium to be built on the 12-acre site just 250 yards from the club’s original ground that closed down 30 years ago. Galliard Homes agreed to stump up £14million for the new 9,300 capacity ground on the proviso that a number of apartment buildings would be erected alongside it. The company claimed that with one-bedroom flats on offer from £425,000, it would be affordable for both first time buyers and local parents looking for buy-to-let opportunities. But the romantic vision of a small club finally finding a home isn’t shared by some who live in the area. Adam Pfeiffer, 52, lives on a small private road opposite the new ground and reminisces about the peaceful weekends he used to enjoy before the club returned. Mechanic Adam says: “It’s a nightmare living here now and I don’t even like football. “The fans take the p***. They park wherever they want and litter all over the street. I regularly spot people using my front garden as a toilet on weekends.” On ‘event days’ you have to pay £3.20 for one hour Credit: Olivia West Business owners like Andrew Yeates are getting cheesed off with the new stadium Credit: Olivia West Kris McKnight runs BB Plumbers close to the stadium. He says: “The dogs stadium was falling to bits so I guess they needed to do something, but it’s a shame that they got rid of it. “It was the last dog track in England and it was a great night out when you won.” Business owners are also getting cheesed off with the new stadium because they are now being made to pay £3.20 an hour for parking on match days. Andrew Yeates – director of the local Balloon and Kite Company – says: “The only real impact is the parking restrictions. “On ‘event days’ you have to pay and display for one hour and that makes parking more difficult. “We have to pay for the hour when we are working and then move it around, or we have to park a long way away. “The biggest complaint I have is that you don’t always know when it’s an event day so you can get caught out. If you don’t know, you get a ticket, it’s that simple.” ‘Traffic is gridlocked’ Roldan Aquino says the new development is a nightmare for traffic in the area, which was already congested Credit: Olivia West Roldan Aquino, 50, helps run a food truck opposite the stadium where gourmet burgers cost £9. He says traffic is frequently gridlocked around the new stadium. “It can be a nightmare some days,” he says. “When there are temporary traffic lights here for whatever reason, it completely kills the business – people can’t get through and a 10 minute drive takes about three hours.” But not every business owner is downcast about the new development. Ania Ridley, 40, is landlady at the The Corner Pin pub where a pint of lager costs £5.10. She says: “I’ve worked here for 21 years and when the stadium was first built, I was worried because we all know what football fans can be like. “But the ones that come here are really nice and polite – they even apologise if they spill their drinks. “And the development has brought in new people and younger people into the area, which is great for the pub. “It used to be mainly old people popping in for a drink but we have a younger crowd now and they are more likely to spend money. “I think the new flats have given the whole area a boost.” The landlady of The Corner Pin pub, Ania Ridley, has welcomed the new development Credit: Olivia West A spokesperson for Galliard Homes said: “The Wimbledon Grounds development has been a resounding success, offering significant benefits to the local community. “One of the notable achievements of this project was the successful return of AFC Wimbledon to Plough Lane, made possible through our financial support and the generous gifting of land to the football club. “The Wimbledon Grounds development was undertaken as a joint venture partnership with The Peabody Trust, previously known as Catalyst Housing Association. Due to this partnership, we were able to achieve a significant increase in the number of affordable housing units, rising from an initial 60 to an impressive 181. These units were subsequently transferred to Catalyst Housing Association, who oversaw the sales and management of them as shared equity properties. “Parking was offered as an additional cost, due to the limited number of parking spaces available for the private units. Most spaces were held by Catalyst Housing Association for use of the affordable units. “The ground rents for the properties were determined in the traditional manner, based on the size of each flat. The initial rate was set at 0.1% of the property price, followed by a nominal peppercorn amount in subsequent years.” Publisher","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:39:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"insidexpress","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"USMA : Zemmaouche le survivant de 2015","link":"https://www.dzfoot.com/football-en-algerie/usma-zemmaouche-le-survivant-de-2015-242982.html?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=unknown","keywords":["Football en Algérie","Coupes"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"De la première finale africaine de l'USM Alger en 2015, il ne subsiste qu'un seul joueur, le gardien Mohamed Lamine Zemmaouche qui à 38 ans entame une pré-retraite reste toujours proche du terrain.

He blocked for John Elway in a pro career that stretched well over a decade. Since retiring with two Super Bowl rings on his fingers, he has worked for ESPN as a broadcaster and helped coach in the NFL. Now, Diaz-Infante is coming home. And to hear him tell it, he couldn’t be happier about moving from Arizona to take over as the football coach of his high school alma mater, Bellarmine College Prep. “No one has what Bellarmine has,” Diaz-Infante, 59, told the Bay Area News Group. “That’s the history and tradition of one of the oldest high schools in the state of California and with a rich and incredible tradition of football and doing great things.” Diaz-Infante’s buddies from back when he was a team captain at the San Jose Jesuit school in the early 1980s nudged him toward adding his name to the list of candidates when Jalal Beauchman in late March. Friday, Bellarmine announced that . “It’s been an interesting journey in itself, much like my journey,” Diaz-Infante said with a laugh. At first, Diaz-Infante wasn’t sure he wanted to leave his home of 15 years in Arizona, his family’s bubble of friends and interests. But the more calls he received about the Bellarmine opening, the more sense it made to apply. Diaz-Infante played on the school’s first Central Coast Section championship team in 1981. “This is the way I can have an impact on some young men like Bellarmine had an impact on me,” Diaz-Infante said. “I’ve been blessed to be around a lot of good coaches and teachers of the game. The game has been good to me, and I think I have been good to the game.” Diaz-Infante called his time with Denver in the late-1990s the highlight of his playing career, which included stops in the World League of American Football and the Canadian Football League. With Denver, Diaz-Infante said he made his living as a sixth man on the line. “I always tell people, ‘Look, I was a good player. I was not a great player. But I learned what it meant to be a great teammate,” Diaz-Infante said. “That’s what it takes to win it all. It was really special to be a part of those teams. “Our offensive line probably epitomized that more than anything, of what it takes to win and the work you have to put in and the dedication and the unselfishness.” No doubt, those are intangibles that Diaz-Infante will try to instill in his new team. The coach spent 20 minutes on Friday in a phone interview with the Bay Area News Group. Here is what he said (edited for clarity and brevity): What is your plan of attack, given that it’s early June and the season is just a few months away? “I am in discussions with people right now (for the staff). I have some people that have been around the game for a long time that have expressed interest in working with me and we’re working on some of those details right now. Guys that have a lot more experience than me. … We’re going to have some great coaches and some great teachers and that’ll help the program all the way through. Guys with experience and guys that love the game and share the same values. I am so excited about that because I don’t know it all. But I made a living being coachable, and I’ll remain coachable. I’ve been around some great coaches and I’ve always taken note of how they do things and why they do them. I’ve been around them when they work and when they don’t work.” Ideally, when would you want to meet with your team? “I plan on getting back early next week and stopping by myself. Introduce myself to the team.” The West Catholic Athletic League has changed quite a bit since you were playing for the Bells. As you look at the landscape of the league, what do you see? “Like it always has been, I see one of the best leagues there is. There is probably more parity today than ever with the addition of Valley Christian (in the early 2000s) and I know Serra is a very good football team and St. Francis and Mitty. Shoot, everybody is good — SI, Riordan and Sacred Heart. The league is as tough as it’s ever been. There are some great coaches.” Not a lot of people go from Arizona to San Jose these days. (Diaz-Infante will also have a staff position with Bellarmine’s Office of Advancement, according to the school.) (Laughs). “The more me and my wife talked and my kids — they’re grown but we always make decisions as a family — they said, ‘You’ve got to do it.’ I’m really humbled by the opportunity, that people thought that highly of me to really put the full-court press on me. And I’ll be home. I used to always tell people, I’ll always be a Bell and San Jose will always be my home. And, obviously, I enjoyed a great deal of success at San Jose State as well. It’s very near and dear to my heart. I still have a lot of incredible friends and family (in the area).” Mark Schlereth (now a broadcaster) was on those Denver offensive lines. What does he think about your new job? “He’s one of my best friends. I am going to see him tomorrow. He’ll be down to visit I am sure when I am coaching there. He was as excited as I was, I think. That’s the kind of relationship we have. I would practice for him when his body was too beat up. We’ve remained close over the years because of those things.”","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:30:58","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BNG-L-BELLARMINE-1203-6.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bob Raissman: Be a shock if Tom Brady bailed on Fox TV gig to return to the field","link":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/06/03/bob-raissman-be-a-shock-if-tom-brady-bailed-on-fox-tv-gig-to-return-to-the-field/","keywords":["NFL","Sports"],"creator":["Tribune News Service"],"video_url":null,"description":"When May turned into June, Aaron Rodgers had company when it came to generating NFL buzz.

There was Patrick Mahomes and questions about whether he is capable of building a dynasty in Kansas City. Then there was the man who supposedly won’t set foot on the field again — the budding TV star, Tom Brady. Suddenly, after he purchased a stake in the team, and because of , speculation bubbled about Brady ending up quarterbacking the Las Vegas Raiders. On Thursday, even after Brady told Sports Illustrated’s Robin Lundberg: it didn’t deter some of the football cognoscenti from speculating that once training camp rolls around, Brady could get the itch to return to the field. Brady wants to shut the spec down, but the hubbub is terrific for his nascent TV career at Fox Sports, where he’s currently the number-one-game-analyst-in waiting, scheduled to enter the booth in the 2024 season and replace Greg Olsen. Brady’s ability to sustain buzz and generate attention is just one reason Fox suits signed him to . That he’s taking a year off before starting the gig signifies his commitment to TV. With Brady taking the 2023 season “off,” Fox has an unprecedented opportunity to tutor Brady. He will have the freedom to do “practice” games from an auxiliary booth in stadiums during live action. He also can get a feel of what his routine will be like during the season. Fox execs will also have the time to start “horse trading” for marquee matchup games for Brady to work in 2024. There are other valid reasons why Brady’s playing days should be over. 1) The Fox contract. Just over $37 million per to work basically once a week for five months a year is incentive enough. 2) More importantly: Brady’s made a career of hard work, preparation, determination, dedication and proving people wrong. That’s his motivation. It will be no different in TV, especially when other networks, Valley of the Stupid Gasbags, and broadcasting agents start sniping at him and nitpicking his performance in the booth. Finally, never once in his storied career has Brady backed down from a challenge, which TV — initially — will be. Those who say Brady has changed his mind before are correct. Yet this is a different time in his life. To see him bail on Fox would be a shocker. If anyone thinks Brady being a part owner of the Raiders will be seen by the NFL as a conflict of interest, or short-circuit his Fox gig, keeping him out of the network’s NFL booth, think again. TV executives and leagues have already set precedent in that regard. Earvin (Magic) Johnson was a panelist on ESPN/ABC’s “NBA Countdown” when he owned an undisclosed stake in the Lakers. If the NFL was concerned with conflicts they could “remind” Fox that Brady should not work any Raiders games. Or just spin it, saying Brady has the chops to be impartial. And he doesn’t believe in passing info from coach to coach. Pat McAfee, and his viewers/listeners have been fretting over whether his show, with its cast of thousands, will change when it moves to ESPN. An inordinate amount of time has been used to ponder this life-or-death question. Moses, er, McAfee has already come down from the mountaintop to deliver his I-got-to-be-me sermon to a few different outlets. Another question worth squeezing in is: Will the coming of McAfee’s show change the way other ESPN programs do business? After all, ESPN boss Jimmy Pitaro has described how McAfee, and his show, generates “audience expansion.” So, ESPN producers know, even if just in the back of their mind, “what Jimmy wants.” Nonetheless, for the past couple of years, ESPN has spent time emphasizing the benefits of hard news (”Get Up,” “This Just In”) and a more measured approach. The rationale is, for example, when hard news breaks on “First Take,” it will dominate the show, no matter what the plan is. Same holds true on “NFL Live” and “NBA Today.” McAfee’s soiree is more free-form. The show can get into personal issues as well as dissecting games and newsy/noisy interviews, like . ESPN is betting $85 million over five years that McAfee’s show will attract new eyeballs to ESPN. If it does, will other ESPN offerings mimic it? For the old adage in sports TV is this: Stealing is believing. Michael Kay did an admirable job of shielding the Yankees from criticism about their streaming situation, until his shell game became apparent. Yankee games streaming on Peacock and Apple+? “The Yankees had nothing to do with games on Apple and Peacock. That’s the greed of Major League Baseball…,” Kay said on his ESPN-98.7 show. Well, what is MLB? It’s actually a company operated and owned by the baseball owners, including Yankee boss Hal Steinbrenner. He has to sign off on these TV deals so you CAN blame the Yankees for Apple+ and Peacock. And the 20 games the Yankees stream on Amazon Prime Video used to be on “free” TV Ch.11 where a subscription fee was not necessary. The Knicks parted ways with GM Scott Perry and team prez Leon (Sphinx) Rose was nowhere to be found to explain why. How shocking! … Talk about an unprecedented NFL season. While remote, there is actually a possibility in December out of those windows (TNF, SNF, and MNF) and three more attractive games to be flexed in. That’s 12 teams out of 32 in the league in the entire league being impacted by Roger Goodell’s determination to boost viewership numbers, which in many cases are already spectacular. … Peter Rosenberg (ESPN-98.7) recently made plenty of sense when he pointed out the ridiculous nature of trying to micro-analyze Mets and Yankees games, the day after on a daily basis, during what is the longest season. He didn’t come out and say the day-after analysis makes for boring, repetitive, radio, but came awfully close. Bravo! … Don La Greca, on 98.7, neatly straddled the line between lunacy and passion last Wednesday when he defended the “sanctity” of the Yankees jersey, railing against those who would allow any sort of advertising on the uniform top. Ironically Michael Kay didn’t have a problem with an ad patch. Remember? This is the guy who, when describing the back of the Yankee jersey during radiocasts, coined the phrase, “no name….of course” and made it famous. * * * For his creativity and consistency. The veteran producer (27 years) of TNT’s critically acclaimed “Inside the NBA,” retired following the Eastern Conference Finals. Kiely did so knowing he ushered in and developed a studio show that maintained its quality, energy and quirkiness. For hyping a CBS Mornings’ “interview” with Alex Rodriguez as “exclusive.” The spot was basically an infomercial where A-Rod “revealed” he had recently been diagnosed with gum disease and has partnered with a health company to help raise “awareness” about the ailment. What said: “I’m certain I’m not playing again, so I’ve tried to make that clear, and I hate to continue to profess that….” What meant to say: “At least for today, I’m certain I’m not playing again.” ()","pubDate":"2023-06-03 12:14:36","image_url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/202306030814TMS_____MNGTRPUB_SPORTS-BOB-RAISSMAN-BE-SHOCK-IF-TOM-1-NY5.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all","source_id":"mercurynews","category":["sports"],"country":["united states of america"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Реал підтвердив відхід Асенсіо","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/06/03/930895/real-pidtverdyv-vidkhid-asensio","keywords":["Футбол"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Півзахисник Реала Марко Асенсіо залишить клуб влітку.Про це повідомляє пресслужба мадридського клубу.Гравець піде з команди після закінчення сезону.
