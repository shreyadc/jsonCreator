The refereeing body tried to distance itself from the relationship between Barcelona and former referee Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, who was a part of the Spanish football federation's refereeing committee from 1994-2018. Local media reports say Barcelona's payments to Enriquez reached 7 million euros ($7.5 million) between 2001 and 2018 when they stopped. While not confirming the exact figures, Barcelona has acknowledged the regular payment to Enriquez during those years. The club has hired an independent firm to carry out its investigation and is expected to give a more detailed account of the relationship with Enriquez once that is concluded. There have been no reports from officials or in the media of the payments being linked to favoritism toward Barcelona by referees. Many former referees who were active at the time Enriquez was their vice president have said they never received any pressure from him or other officials. They also said that his role was to inform referees what competition they had been designated each season, but not which games. Spanish soccer federation secretary general Andreu Camps, second to president Luis Rubiales, said at the event that his organization has complied with requests for information from Spain's tax office and prosecutors and kept UEFA informed.","pubDate":"2023-03-02 18:26:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cristiano Ronaldo Cheated On Georgina Rodriguez?

Sometimes he has to roll up his sleeves and do some manual labour around the building. Marco said: \"It's just like running a big family. The hardest thing is you've got to be flexible. \"We get up really early in the morning and you can still be waiting for people to check in at 11pm at night. \"You always have to have your shoes on, you always have to smart.

He said: \"For us it is great, we're both people who like to get things off our chests. \"I was a bit like that in the dressing room too. It's better not to keep grudges, tell someone what you think. \"So, if I make a mistake or error, she'll tell me and vice versa.\" The guest house itself has 11 big letting rooms, blending a mix of modern and classic in their decor. Marco said: \"The scale of the house allows us to have spacious rooms, our bigger rooms are 22 feet square. \"They've all got sofas in them, so we're going more high-end. \"When there's race meets, and during the summer, our bigger rooms can be from £140-£170 a night at the weekend. \"But midweek, we are flexible, and it's always best to book with us directly because we can do a better deal.\" TripAdvisor can make-or-break any business, and with the bed and breakfast industry being so competitive in York, Gabbiadini keeps an eye on what's said about Bishops online.

The hardest thing is you've got to be flexible. \"We get up really early in the morning and you can still be waiting for people to check in at 11pm at night. \"You always have to have your shoes on, you always have to smart.

It's better not to keep grudges, tell someone what you think. \"So, if I make a mistake or error, she'll tell me and vice versa.\" The guest house itself has 11 big letting rooms, blending a mix of modern and classic in their decor. Marco said: \"The scale of the house allows us to have spacious rooms, our bigger rooms are 22 feet square. \"They've all got sofas in them, so we're going more high-end. \"When there's race meets, and during the summer, our bigger rooms can be from £140-£170 a night at the weekend. \"But midweek, we are flexible, and it's always best to book with us directly because we can do a better deal.\" TripAdvisor can make-or-break any business, and with the bed and breakfast industry being so competitive in York, Gabbiadini keeps an eye on what's said about Bishops online.

I didn't think that, in that situation, there would be sex. The fact is, it happened. It was consented on my part, but despite that I felt manipulated, by the fame and power of Cristiano Ronaldo,\" she wrote on Instagram, as per The Sun. Ronaldo is currently living in Saudi Arabia with his partner Georgina Rodriguez and family. He is a father of five and he recently came out denying the allegations of sexual relations with the Influencer. The model claimed that the incident took place on March 25 in 2022.

The report adds talks may have already begun between representatives of both sides. However, this deal is of a far lower value than what Al-Nassr currently pay Ronaldo. The 38-year-old joined the club in December after his contract at Manchester United was ripped up following a bombshell interview with Piers Morgan. And he was offered an eye-watering £173m-a-year deal to leave European football behind. Messi has a contract at Paris Saint-Germain worth £25m a year net according to The Athletic - though the deal had huge sign-on and additional bonuses. PSG want him to sign a new deal and continue his blossoming partnership with Kylian Mbappe.

Sometimes he has to roll up his sleeves and do some manual labour around the building. Marco said: \"It's just like running a big family. The hardest thing is you've got to be flexible. \"We get up really early in the morning and you can still be waiting for people to check in at 11pm at night. \"You always have to have your shoes on, you always have to smart. We do have staff, but we live on site. \"And you have to always be prepared for anything. You can come into a room one day and someone's had an accident and spilled coffee on the mattress. \"Then, you have to quickly go to a shop, find a replacement mattress because the next person's checking in that afternoon. \"I cook breakfast some days and I'll do some of the handyman stuff, like bleeding radiators or fixing toilets. \"I can do most things - plumbing, painting and decorating, but we will also get the professionals in too. \"We've had family that have grown up in it, and now they're older they can run it when we go away.\" Marco added that he and his wife Deborah are brutally honest with each other during the working day. He said: \"For us it is great, we're both people who like to get things off our chests. \"I was a bit like that in the dressing room too. It's better not to keep grudges, tell someone what you think. \"So, if I make a mistake or error, she'll tell me and vice versa.\" The guest house itself has 11 big letting rooms, blending a mix of modern and classic in their decor. Marco said: \"The scale of the house allows us to have spacious rooms, our bigger rooms are 22 feet square. \"They've all got sofas in them, so we're going more high-end. \"When there's race meets, and during the summer, our bigger rooms can be from £140-£170 a night at the weekend. \"But midweek, we are flexible, and it's always best to book with us directly because we can do a better deal.\" TripAdvisor can make-or-break any business, and with the bed and breakfast industry being so competitive in York, Gabbiadini keeps an eye on what's said about Bishops online.

Marco said: \"We've entered the York Tourism Awards 'Guest House of the Year' competition four times and won it three, which is pretty good going. \"You always going to get people that are going to be unhappy. But if you've got 600 or 700 reviews saying you're doing the right thing, then that's good too. \"It a British guest house is such a traditional thing. I think a really comfortable bed and good breakfast is the key to being successful. \"It's that simple really, but it's what's the most important.\" As a player, Gabbiadini didn't win too many awards himself.
