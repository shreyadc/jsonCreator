Maddinson tried to play a pull shot and had his front foot going back toward the stumps in the process. The players, including the batter, and commentators thought of it to be a hit wicket and Maddinson started walking back to the dugout.However, the replays suggested that he did not hit the stumps. The bail had fallen due to wind and he was not even close to the stumps.Watch the video:What on earth???Looks like the wind‚Äôs knocked the bail off!

Slowly, but surely, the borders have reopened and tourism activities have returned to full swing.Sports continues to play a major role in driving tourism back to Australia. Melbourne, Victoria in particular. A well-contested T20 World Cup, featuring the blockbuster India-Pakistan clash at the MCG, has played its part and now it‚Äôs over to the upcoming Australian Open and the Australian Grand Prix to sustain the momentum.In an exclusive chat with Firstpost.com, Visit Victoria‚Äôs CEO Brendan McClements talks about the challenge of bringing people back to Melbourne and Victoria and the road ahead. Excerpts:How difficult was it getting people back to Australia?We obviously went through challenging time but this whole year we have been giving people reasons to come back to Melbourne and Victoria. Cricket World Cup was there, we had tennis at start of the year. So we have given people reasons to drop that reluctance. I think aviation capacity is the biggest challenge for now. Flights are full and it‚Äôs difficult to get flights to Australia. The big challenge right now is not people wanting to come here, it‚Äôs about people not being able to get on a plane to get here.Once you are here, you obviously have enough reasons to be interested.Oh yeah. What we have seen there is a great appetite among people to travel. As soon as they travel, they want to travel again. We are confident that if we can deal with those capacity issues, we will see a fantastic future.Cricket World Cup couldn‚Äôt have been timed better for revival of tourism in Australia, right?Cricket World Cup came at a perfect time for us to showcase Melbourne and Victoria to the world, to India in particular. And we have seen a fantastic response. Tens of thousands of Indians have travelled for the World Cup, so as the world comes back to us, India is very important part of our relationship. And this was an ideal starting point for us to reintroduce Melbourne and Victoria to the market of people.There is a lot of cultural diversity on display in Melbourne. You think that could help play a part when you look at reviving tourism in the country overall?We are proud of the multicultural nature of Melbourne. More than 200,000 Indians chose to make Melbourne their home. Really strong connections people to people here. So many students prefer to study here, so I think it‚Äôs a really embracing place. So there can be no place better than Melbourne to start your journey in Australia.And there‚Äôs more to see in Melbourne than just the rich sporting culture.Absolutely yes. We are proud of our sporting culture but we also have a wonderful food culture, art culture and we are close to natural wildlife. So If you want to come to a place which has great urban experience and also experience Australian kangaroos, which is not far away, then Melbourne is the place for you. For Indian tourists, it‚Äôs the perfect location. So come to Melbourne is my message for everyone out there.(The writer was in Melbourne on invite of Visit Victoria)Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Siraj struck on the very first ball when he induced an edge off lefthander Najmul Hossain Shanto with an away-going delivery. Leading the pace department in absence of Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, Yadav then reduced Bangladesh to 5 for 2 inside the fourth over after inducing an inside edge off Yasir Ali, who was playing away from his body. But thereafter Litton Das calmed things down with his fluent drives and remained unbeaten on 24 off 26 balls. At the break, Das and Zakir Hasan (9) were in the middle with Bangladesh trailing India by 367 runs with eight wickets in hand. The opening session was all about Ravichandran Ashwin (58 off 113 balls, 2√ó4, 2√ó6) and Kuldeep Yadav, who made a perfect case for him as an allrounder in absence of Ravindra Jadeja, with a career-best 40 (114b; 5√ó4). Playing his first Test after more than 22 months, Kuldeep extended splendid support to Ashwin as the duo frustrated Bangladesh with an 87-run partnership for the eighth wicket. The 28-year-old Kuldeep, who has a century and six fifties averaging 22-plus in first-class cricket, got off the mark after 18 balls as he looked solid with his defence. His slog sweep and reverse sweep shots also caught the attention. Ashwin, who has five Test centuries including four against the West Indies, showed a lot of composure and maturity en route to his 13th Test half-century. The duo hardly took a foot wrong pushing India past the 400-mark after the visitors resumed the day at 278 for 6 and lost overnight batter Shreyas Iyer (86) with the addition of just four runs to his total. Having batted India out of a tricky spot on an opening day, Iyer once again failed to get to a well-deserved hundred and got out with an addition of just four runs to his overnight total. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan mostly employed his star spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz to go in tandem with pacer Khaled Ahmed but Ashwin hardly looked in any trouble. He made his intentions clear stepping down to Mehidy for a six. Luck also favoured Ashwin when he survived an ‚Äòumpire‚Äôs call‚Äô after left-arm spinner Taijul Islam had him trapped in front of the leg stump when he was on 34. That pace spearhead Ebadot Hossain was taken out of the attack after his impressive spell of 4-1-7-1 in the morning also helped the Indian cause. Kuldeep also oozed confidence as Ashwin was happy to take singles and give him the strike.

FP Trending December 15th, 2022 14:38:55 IST Naseem Shah shared his debut struggle during the Pakistan vs England Test series. AP Pakistan pacer Naseem Shah has been one the best finds for their team in recent years. He made his international debut at the age of 16 and has been one of the main bowlers for the Men in Green since then. But it has not been an easy ride for the young pacer. Naseem Shah has gone through some tough times, with the hardest being his mother‚Äôs demise just one day before his international debut. Recently, Naseem Shah opened up about the incident during a chat with Nasser Hussain for Sky Sports Cricket . Naseem stated that while he was ‚Äútoo attached‚Äù to his mother, he had moved to Lahore to pursue his dream of playing cricket. A day before his maiden appearance for the Men in Green in Australia, he talked to his mother and asked her to ‚Äúwatch the game tomorrow‚Äù because he would be playing. Naseem‚Äôs mother was overjoyed and said she would come to Lahore and watch him play. But tragedy struck. When Naseem woke up, the management informed the pacer that his mother had passed away. Despite his loss, the youngster soon made his debut Test appearance against Australia in Brisbane and picked up David Warner‚Äôs wicket. Naseem also broke his silence about the struggles he endured after he started his career. ‚ÄúFor the next six-to-eight months, I struggled so much. No one thinks about what‚Äôs going on inside you. I used to have a lot of medicines, I saw my mom everywhere. I used to think about her a lot,‚Äù Naseem said. He also spoke about the expectations he had to live up to. ‚ÄúWhenever you play for Pakistan, everyone expects performances from you. I had a lot of injuries during that time as well, so it was a tough time. I learned from it, though. I‚Äôm stronger now. My debut was the toughest day of my life. I can manage when I‚Äôm not performing well now, because I know how tough it was,‚Äù he added. The Rawalpindi Test between Pakistan and England was another opportunity for the speedster to showcase his talent and Naseem did not disappoint his fans. He took 5 wickets in the fixture, with Liam Livingstone, Harry Brooks, and English skipper Ben Stokes among his victims. The pacer has been ruled out of the third and final England-Pakistan Test . Naseem has been ruled out of the second game at Multan after a shoulder injury and has not yet fully recovered. The 19-year-old will undergo further assessment at Lahore‚Äôs National High-Performance Centre, before beginning his recovery process, according to a press release by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

But it seems like the fixture between the sides is also an opportunity for reconciliation. Bangladesh bowling coach Allan Donald has issued a public apology to India head coach Rahul Dravid for sledging him during an India vs South Africa ODI in 1997. Speaking to Sony Sports Network about the ongoing Test, Allan Donald recalled the sledging incident and admitted that he had ‚Äúoverstepped the mark a little bit‚Äù that day. He also invited Dravid for dinner. When the hosts asked Allan Donald about the 1997 sledging incident, the former pacer admitted that he had gone too far that day. Donald, who was famous for his comments to opposition batters, called the incident ‚Äúugly‚Äù and said he did not wish to discuss it. ‚ÄúHe (Rahul Dravid) and Sachin were smoking us to all parts. I overstepped the mark a little bit. I just got nothing but massive respect for Rahul. I would like to go out and sit with Rahul and say sorry to him again about what happened back then. I just had to do something silly, that brought his wicket actually. But I still apologise for what I said that day‚Äù, Donald said. Calling the former India skipper ‚Äúa great bloke‚Äù Donald said he would love to have a night out with Dravid. Separately, Dravid was also shown Donald‚Äôs apology and asked about it.

That clash is scheduled for Wednesday but the league is closely monitoring the unfolding situation.","pubDate":"2022-12-15 06:44:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Bangladesh LIVE Score, 1st Test Match, Day 2: Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav Keep India In The Driver's Seat vs Bangladesh - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXZzLWluZGlhLTIwMjItMjMvaW5kaWEtdnMtYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC0xc3QtdGVzdC1tYXRjaC1pbmQtdnMtYmFuLWRheS0yLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0zNjA2Nzgx0gGIAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2JhbmdsYWRlc2gtdnMtaW5kaWEtMjAyMi0yMy9pbmRpYS12cy1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLTFzdC10ZXN0LW1hdGNoLWluZC12cy1iYW4tZGF5LTItbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTM2MDY3ODEvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Bangladesh LIVE Score, 1st Test Match, Day 2: Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav Keep India In The Driver's Seat vs Bangladesh¬†¬†NDTV SportsIndia vs Bangladesh 1st Test, Chattogram, Stumps Day 2 LIVE Score: Ashwin, Kuldeep Put IND In Command Before¬†¬†Cricket Country NewsIND: 375-7 (127) | IND VS BAN Day 2, 1st Test LIVE Score and Updates: Kuldeep Yadav posts his highes¬†¬†Zee News\"India Cannot Play Bazball Kind Of Cricket\": Veteran Star Disagrees With KL Rahul¬†¬†NDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - Bangladesh vs India, 1st Test, Day 1, Chattogram | Cricbuzz.com¬†¬†CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-15 06:43:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cheteshwar Pujara, Shreyas Iyer carry India to 278/6 in First Test","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/cheteshwar-pujara-shreyas-iyer-carry-india-to-2786-in-first-test-628094","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"In the first session, Bangladesh had taken out Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli to reduce India to 48/3 in 19.3 overs.","content":"CHATTOGRAM: Cheteshwar Pujara and Shreyas Iyer smashed half-centuries to lead India's recovery from 48/3 to 278/6 at stumps on day one of first Test against Bangladesh at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, here on Wednesday.In the first session, Bangladesh had taken out Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, and Virat Kohli to reduce India to 48/3 in 19.3 overs. Pujara and Rishabh Pant (46) led the initial recovery for India through a counter-attacking 64-run stand. But once Pant fell in the second session, Pujara joined hands with Iyer to lead another rescue act for India through a solid 149-run stand for the fifth wicket. While Pujara was firm as a rock, Iyer was aggressive after a tentative start and had plenty of luck on his side. Though Pujara would fall ten runs short of his century as left-arm spinner Taijul Islam took him out to complete his three-wicket haul after beating him several times in the day, Iyer remained unbeaten on 82 off 169 balls on an absorbing day of Test cricket. Bangladesh, despite getting six wickets and Taijul being their standout bowler, would be wondering how the day would have been if they hadn't dropped Pujara and Iyer on 12 and 67 respectively. As Pant walked in to bat after being promoted to number five to counter Taijul, India were in trouble at 48/3 in 19.3 overs.

It‚Äôs why Friday‚Äôs MCG clash against the Sydney Thunder, the first BBL game in front of the Shane Warne stand since the cricket legend‚Äôs tragic passing, looms as an emotional for everyone who will put on a green shirt. Warne played 15 games for the Stars in the first two seasons of the BBL, after coming out of retirement to help kickstart the competition as its marquee man. Stars players will all wear Warne‚Äôs No.23 on their playing shirts, before it‚Äôs retired for good, which Maxwell said was the ultimate tribute to the club‚Äôs inaugural captain, who brought his significant ‚Äúgifts‚Äù not just to the Melbourne team, but to a fledgling competition which he made everyone take notice of. ‚ÄúIn the first year of the BBL we needed the king and the BBL certainly needed him as well,‚Äù Maxwell said on Thursday. Warne‚Äôs BBL stint was littered with magic and memorable moments including the night he talked through taking the wicket of New Zealand star Brendon McCullum, which Maxwell said showed the ‚Äúgenius‚Äù he possessed. ‚ÄúNothing probably sort of show showcases the ability and skill and superstar power that he had like that moment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt just showed the genius of what he could do and to be able to take down the opposition‚Äòs best player and talk you through it and take the fans to it, and be subject to ridicule if it doesn‚Äôt go right. as well. ‚ÄúI think he had an incredible ability to bring life to any contest. And he did that in certainly different ways ... and he certainly paved the way for the rest of us to, I suppose have the things that we do now.‚ÄùHussey was a foundation Stars player with Warne and said his capacity to take the entire game on his shoulders, to carry the burden of pressure, and thrive with a smile on his face, was significant to the emergence of the competition, and deserving of a tribute match. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to put into words because he was the star. The whole competition needed a star and we needed a leader and he came in and was both,‚Äù Hussey said. ‚ÄúWhat he did provide for us kids at the time is he took all the pressure of us and just told us pretty much how to play the game with no pressure on us which it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do with our boys now.‚ÄúWhen you play on the biggest stage in front of a big crowd at the MCG you‚Äôre trying to take all the pressure off all the players so that‚Äôs what he provided for us and it‚Äôs gonna be a nice fitting farewell just to celebrate his legacy.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-12-15 06:11:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Narrative spins in David Warner‚Äôs favour but that is to forget the reasons behind his ban | Geoff Lemon","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/15/narrative-spins-in-david-warners-favour-but-that-is-to-forget-the-reasons-behind-leadership-ban","keywords":["David Warner","Australia cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport","Cricket Australia"],"creator":["Geoff Lemon"],"video_url":null,"description":"The opener did what he did.

The raucous presence known as The Bull who was suspended from the 2013 Ashes gave way to the contemplative Reverend by 2015, schooling teammates on the power of positive thinking, before returning to his most confrontational mode before the Ashes in 2017. The instigator of the sandpaper ball-tampering plot in 2018 served a year‚Äôs playing ban, ran the well-worn path of public redemption via on-field success, and has since presented himself as an elder statesman with an accordingly impeccable disciplinary record.The way he is perceived has also shifted, in cricket media at least, but no shifts have been bigger than the last few weeks as his campaign to have his leadership ban overturned ran into a brick wall. Where his co-accused Steve Smith was banned from captaincy for two years, and Cameron Bancroft not at all, Warner was for life.

But it won‚Äôt be wrong to say that the value of this silver is perhaps bigger than her 2017 triumph and may as well dwarf her Tokyo success too.Extremely humbled and grateful for this victory.

From each nation there were two participants, especially China got their two best lifters too. That‚Äôs why winning this medal was never going to be easy.‚ÄùTaking a look at the 49kg field on the global stage, Mirabai and the two Chinese are locked in a battle for supremacy with the Indian holding the clean and jerk‚Äôs world record of 119kg. Zhihui (96kg; world record) and Huihua (94kg), on the other hand, are much stronger in the snatch category and have a better all-around game to often pip the Indian to the top.Aware of her rival‚Äôs strength, Mirabai knew she couldn‚Äôt afford a slip-up in Bogota but resurfacing of her wrist injury tested her might further as she risked competing.‚ÄúI was worried because my wrist pain was back while training in the USA (in St Louis, where she trained with national coach Vijay Sharma for two weeks to acclimatise to the local conditions) and that‚Äôs why in Colombia I was aiming not to pick more than 87kg in snatch,‚Äù she explained.However, a ‚Äòno lift‚Äô of her second attempt of 87kg forced Mirabai to re-attempt the lift and the Tokyo silver medallist stunned the crowd by salvaging a rare lift from a squat position.Shedding more light on her injury, coach Sharma said the injury resurfaced while training in the USA and upon consulting, their trusted strength and conditioning coach Dr. Aaron Horschig suggested that the elite athlete could compete without stretching herself.‚ÄúAfter she complained of pain in her wrist it made me think we can‚Äôt go to Bogota anymore,‚Äù said Sharma. ‚ÄúConsulting with Dr. Horschig revealed that small muscles in Mira‚Äôs wrist are weak and it often gets injured but could compete if she doesn‚Äôt push too hard.‚ÄùTrouble was waiting for Mirabai post her Colombia show as it was revealed that a lower back pain will keep her away from hard training for a month. Mirabai currently is back in her hometown in Manipur but will be soon at the national camp in Patiala with no time to waste.‚ÄúI will be undergoing recovery from injury in Patiala and have not much time to waste as we have to start preparing for Asian Championships in May (an Olympic ranking tournament). I am not certain yet if I will go to the USA or other foreign camp for training,‚Äù said Mirabai before concluding.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Be it age-group or senior cricket. The best he had managed, with the bat, was a 91 against Uttar Pradesh in a U-19 Cooch Behar Trophy fixture for Mumbai in the 2018-19 season. The 23-year-old finally got his moment under the sun when he scored his maiden First Class hundred against Rajasthan in the ongoing Ranji Trophy fixture in Porvorim.EXCLUSIVE | ‚ÄòThe knock has come against a good team‚Äô: Coach Subroto BanerjeeIn no time, he was all over social media and ‚Äúlike father, like son‚Äù was the theme of most congratulatory posts. Just like the great Sachin Tendulkar, Arjun found his name in elite company when he completed the hundred on FC debut for Goa.¬†View this post on Instagram¬†A post shared by Mumbai Indians (@mumbaiindians)The southpaw, moments after the day‚Äôs play got over, posted a video of his hundred celebration on Instagram with the caption ‚ÄúBUMPY ROADS HAVE THE BEST DESTINATIONS. MAIDEN 1st CLASS 100. #HARDWORKPAYS‚Äù. Sister Sara congratulated Arjun in a series of posts appreciating her brother‚Äôs efforts in the middle.It wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing for Arjun as he walked out to bat in a difficult situation. The first job at hand was to see off the remaining overs of the day‚Äôs play and ‚Äúprotect‚Äù a well-set Suyash Prabhudesai who was battling well past fifty at that stage. The left-hander performed the night-watchman‚Äôs role to perfection and ensured there were no more casualties when stumps were called on the opening day.‚ÄúWhen I first walked out to bat I had to face most of the balls because Suyash was batting on 80 so it was my job to protect him and play most of the balls,‚Äù Arjun told reporters after play ended on Day 2.The opening session of the second day was all about ‚Äúgiving the first hour to the bowlers‚Äù.‚ÄúAs of the approach today, it was more about the basics. Just give first hour to the bowlers. After we grit the initial phase out, it‚Äôs time to capitalise. And time to get runs. As I said, it was the new ball and the new ball would do something. I honestly don‚Äôt care how I look, I gritted the first difficult phase out and then I cashed in,‚Äù said Arjun.¬†View this post on Instagram¬†A post shared by Arjun Tendulkar (@arjuntendulkar24)Was he aware about his father also scoring a hundred on First Class debut? ‚ÄúNo I wasn‚Äôt aware,‚Äù came the quick reply.For years now, Arjun ‚Äî the bowler ‚Äî has hogged most of the limelight and his skills with the bat have rather gone unnoticed. But for the left-hander, he always had belief in his batting abilities and informs that the hundreds have been scored in trial matches for the Mumbai Cricket Association during age-group days.‚ÄúI always had belief in my ability and wanted to just get set, and once I am set it‚Äôs about cashing in and getting the big runs. As I said, just play the first hour out and capitalise,‚Äù said Arjun.Arjun is off to a fine start in the First Class circuit but the youngster is not keen to look too far ahead and wants to focus on staying in the present and winning the ongoing match against Rajasthan.‚ÄúJust play each game and each ball on the merit. For now, just try winning this game,‚Äù said Arjun.With Prabhudesai, who scored 212, Arjun put on a brilliant partnership and the left-right combination clearly frustrated a very potent Rajasthan attack on the second day. The duo put on 221 runs and more importantly were out in the middle for over 60 overs. The solid stand ended when Kamlesh Nagarkoti dismissed Arjun for 120. At the end of day‚Äôs play, Arjun spoke about the partnership and lavished praise on Prabhudesai.‚ÄúIt was great help (batting with Prabhudesai). He was batting well and showing good character. Had tightened his defence and was leaving the ball well. I kept talking to him and it was great help in the middle,‚Äù said Arjun.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Tim Southee has been named the replacement in their WTC title defence. Williamson will continue to lead the side in the white-ball format with focus on the ODI World Cup in 2023 and T20 World Cup in 2024. Tom Latham has been appointed their vice-captain. ‚ÄúCaptaining the Black Caps in Test cricket has been an incredibly special honour,‚Äù said Williamson, who took over the role in 2016 from Brendon McCullum. ‚ÄúFor me, Test cricket is the pinnacle of the game and I‚Äôve enjoyed the challenges of leading the side in the format.‚Äù Statistically, Williamson is the best Test captain in New Zealand‚Äôs history, winning 22 of 40 matches at the helm, as well as eight draws and just 10 defeats. Under his leadership, New Zealand reached the top of the Test rankings before emerging as winners of the ICC Test Championship, beating India in the final in June last year. On his decision, Williamson said: ‚ÄúCaptaincy comes with an increased workload on and off the field and at this stage of my career I feel the time is right for this decision. ‚ÄúAfter discussions with NZC, we felt that continuing to captain the white-ball formats was preferable with two World Cups in the next two years.‚Äù Williamson said Southee and Latham will have him as a source of help throughout his tenure. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to support Tim as captain and Tom as vice-captain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHaving played with both of them for most of my career, I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll do a great job.‚Äù Southee, who has 346 internationals to his name and has led the T20 side on 22 occasions, will become New Zealand‚Äôs 31st Test captain when he leads the team during this month‚Äôs Test tour to Pakistan. The first Test begins on Boxing Day in Karachi. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a surreal few days and it‚Äôs just a massive honour to be appointed as Test captain,‚Äù Southee said. ‚ÄúI love Test cricket, it‚Äôs the ultimate challenge and I‚Äôm really excited by the opportunity to lead the team in this format. ‚ÄúKane‚Äôs been an outstanding Test captain and I‚Äôm looking forward to working with Gary on how we can build on that,‚Äù he added. Paying his tribute to Williamson, New Zealand coach Gary Stead said: ‚ÄúKane‚Äôs guided the Test team through an immensely successful period which is a testament to his ability to bring people together and work towards a common goal. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs certainly led from the front with his own performances and that was very much the case during our push to win the World Test Championship. ‚ÄúThe Test team has continued to evolve and develop during his time and the fact we‚Äôve been able to introduce new players and see them thrive almost instantly is a credit to Kane and his leadership. ‚ÄúWe hope by lessening his workload we can continue to see the best of Kane Williamson for longer on the international stage, and we know he will remain a key leader in this group.‚Äù Sead said the decision to appoint Southee as captain came down to the direction in which the Test team wanted to head. ‚ÄúTim‚Äôs a quality leader with a good cricket brain,‚Äù Stead said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen his captaincy skills on display with the T20 side and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll continue to bring an aggressive style, whilst still maintaining the core fundamentals of how this Blackcaps team operates in the Test arena. ‚ÄúHe will also come from a slightly different perspective in being a bowler which I‚Äôm sure will also bring with it new ideas and fresh thinking.‚Äù Tags: kane williamson Tim Southee World Test Championship Share Tweet Send Share Suggest A Correction Enter your email to get our daily news in your inbox.

Learning to let things go,‚Äù said Starc.‚ÄúThe disappointing part or the sad part is that we never got to have that conversation. I guess we‚Äôll never know (whether it was personal).‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know ‚Äì I never got a phone call to take up that offer (of a beer).‚ÄúHindsight is a wonderful thing.‚ÄùIt was at the Gabba in 2014 when Warne first caused a stir when he described Starc‚Äôs body language as ‚Äúsoft‚Äù on a sweltering hot day in Brisbane when conditions were oppressive for fast bowlers.Starc‚Äôs camp felt Warne unfairly targeted the quick from that moment on, and even on the eve of last summer, the spin king boldly declared on Fox Cricket Australia should drop the left-armer for the first Ashes Test.Warne‚Äôs manager James Erskine revealed on Fox Cricket the day of Warne‚Äôs death that the cricketing legend had privately acknowledged that he was wrong in his harsh assessment of Starc last summer, after the fast bowling ace dominated England in the first three Tests, including a wicket from the first ball of the series.In an interview with News Corp before his death, Warne insisted he would have happily sat down for a ‚Äúbeer‚Äù with Starc, and hoped that his at times stinging commentary had served as some motivation, even if the big quick didn‚Äôt appreciate what was being said.‚ÄúI have no issue whatsoever. It‚Äôs not personal. If Mitchell Starc wants to talk about anything I‚Äôm happy to talk to him too. If he wants to have a beer and have a chat about stuff, I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄòMitch, mate, happy to chat,‚Äô‚Äù Warne told News Corp in an unpublished interview from last summer.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing personal. I‚Äôm there to judge what I see ‚Ä¶ It devalues the public out there (if you don‚Äôt give) your opinion. It looks like you‚Äôre having favourites.‚ÄúUnfortunately, I‚Äôve got an opinion and I think it‚Äôs important that us commentators, or people in the game, yourself (journalists) included, you‚Äôve got to be honest with your opinions and some people aren‚Äôt going to like it, which is fine.‚ÄúBut maybe they might respect it, or maybe it might even inspire them. Who knows?‚ÄúThey might say; ‚ÄòI‚Äôll show you.‚Äô That‚Äôs good too.‚ÄùFor years, that was Starc‚Äôs attitude. But eventually he realised it was wearing him down carrying a chip on his shoulder, and over the past four years he has adopted a different, more mellow approach which has coincided with him finding the best form of his career as he prepares to reach a 300-milestone that history says is the most accurate marker for what constitutes a bowling great.‚ÄúI did (use criticism as motivation) with everything. I was someone who listened to and read everything,‚Äù Starc said.‚ÄúAnd then that year (2018-19) we had multiple broadcasters start, everyone coming in with radio and whatever, that‚Äôs when it really doubled down on the noise and it really got away from (me).‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I learnt best to let things go and only worry about the groups that mattered most to me and those closest to me. That‚Äôs all I need to feel comfortable in myself. That was a point where it changed a fair bit for me, where I chose not to read things and it‚Äôs continued on where it doesn‚Äôt matter.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt pay attention to a lot of stuff which has made a huge difference.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of cricket. You‚Äôre going to have your critics and everyone is entitled to have an opinion. I‚Äôll just keep going about my cricket.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-12-15 05:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ranji Trophy Live Updates, Day 3: Jagadeesan falls, Sudharsan nears ton; Tamil Nadu in command vs Hyderabad","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ranji-trophy-live-score-updates-day-3-scorecard-streaming-info-dec-15-results-highlights/article66265694.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Team Sportstar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Ranji Trophy Live Score Updates: Get the live cricket score, updates, commentary and highlights from day 3 matches of the Ranji Trophy matches.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-15 04:58:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"AUS vs SA Test Series: Australia Brace For South African Pace In 1st Match","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/aus-vs-sa-test-series-australia-brace-for-south-african-pace-in-first-match-3608292","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia will face one of cricket's most hostile pace attacks when they play South Africa at Test level from Saturday for the first time since the infamous \"Sandpaper-gate\" series.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-12-15 04:55:49","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/5kh3af28_mitchell-starc-and-pat-cummins-afp_625x300_23_March_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kane Williamson steps down as captain of New Zealand Test team","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/kane-williamson-steps-down-as-captain-of-new-zealand-test-team/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","game","Kane Williamson","New Zealand"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wellington: Kane Williamson has stepped down as the captain of the New Zealand Test cricket team.
