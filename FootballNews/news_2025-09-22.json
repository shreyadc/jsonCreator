charge of Burnley between June and August this year.Liverpool announced the immediate postponement of their Sunday WSL fixture against Aston Villa following the devastating news.The club described Beard as an extremely committed and successful manager who possessed genuine integrity and warmth.“Matt was not only an extremely committed and successful manager, he was also a person of real integrity and warmth,“ Liverpool stated.Chelsea highlighted Beard’s significant contribution to shaping their women’s team during his three-year tenure from 2009 to 2012.The London club acknowledged he laid important foundations before Emma Hayes’ arrival and was integral to the growth of women’s football in England.Beard began his managerial career at Millwall before joining Chelsea in 2009.The
