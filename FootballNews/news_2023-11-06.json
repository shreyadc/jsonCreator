Lions booking their ticket to IG Field after defeating the Calgary Stampeders in the division’s semi-final Saturday evening. It’s the second straight year the first-place Bombers will meet the second-place Lions for a chance to play in the Grey Cup. Winnipeg earned that honour last year with a 28-20 victory before falling to the Toronto Argonauts by a point in the championship game. While it’s the second time the Bombers will play B.C. in as many years, it’s the fourth consecutive Western final they’ll be a part of. It’s a streak that first began with a win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2019, with the Bombers going on to defeat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at home to snap their Grey Cup drought after 29 years.

(Darryl Dyck / The Canadian Press files) In fact, dating back to the 1958 season, the first official CFL season, the Bombers have played in 30 division finals – split between the West and East – and earned 16 wins, resulting in 12 Grey Cups. The Bombers are hoping to add a 13th league title in 2023, a victory that would cement this era’s team as a CFL dynasty. But rather than look too far ahead, let’s take a glance back at some of the more memorable Finals the Bombers have been a part of. There were plenty of options, but we’ve narrowed it down to the top-5. This isn’t recency bias. The 2019 West Final was not only among the most entertaining and nail-biting affairs ever to be played, the fact in came after a dominating road win in Calgary against the Stampeders in the semi-final the week before made the victory all the more impressive. Playing in front of a sold-out crowd as Mosaic Stadium, the Bombers led right down to the wire, before narrowly escaping with the win after a late surge from the Riders. “It was like watching a thriller movie and the suspenseful part lasts six minutes and you just want to see what happens,” Bombers receiver Drew Wolitarksy said at the time. “It’s a crazy feeling and I don’t know any other thing I’ve ever done that I could use to express it.” “I think my heart stopped and went again like three or four times,” added receiver Nic Demski. “I was just kind of playing peek-a-boo with myself, covering one eye and seeing what was going on out there.” A Bombers game-sealing interception was called back. Then a missed interception led to a Riders completed pass and a new set of downs with seconds remaining on the clock, the home side trailing by just a TD. But despite three attempts at finding the end zone, the Bombers defence proved to be too much to handle. The game ultimately ended with then-Saskatchewan QB Cody Fajardo connecting with the crossbar of the uprights, immediately making it a dead play. The Bombers would go on to beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, in Calgary, to snap their Grey Cup drought of nearly 30 years. This was another victory for the Bombers in enemy territory, with BC Place packed to the back rows, just hundreds short of 60,000. The Lions finished two points ahead of the Bombers in the West standings, with the season-series split one game apiece. The Bombers were riding high off a 55-20 victory over Edmonton in the semi-final a week earlier, and they managed to carry that momentum into their tilt with the Lions. The Bombers, who were led by a three-touchdown performance from QB Tom Clements, led 17-7 at halftime before allowing just seven points to the Lions in the final 30 minutes, including none in the fourth quarter. The win was significant for many reasons, but none greater than the fact it had been 19 years since the Bombers had punched their ticket to the Grey Cup, last playing in the championship game in 1965, in what’s widely known as the “Wind Bowl.” To show their appreciation, fans showed up to the Winnipeg airport to welcome the boys home, with police estimating between 2,500-3,500 people. “We lost about a dozen ceiling tiles because a few of the fans were throwing around a football and volleyball,” then-terminal manager George Elliott told the Free Press at the time. “We lost four benches and the base of an advertising sign was broken, but really, nothing expensive was lost.” The Bombers capped the season off with a dominating 47-17 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Grey Cup, giving Winnipeg its first championship since 1962. This was during the era where the winner of the West final was determined over a best-of-three series, with the first game played in Calgary before moving to Winnipeg for the final two. It’s important to note that all three games were played over a single week, between Nov. 17-24. Calgary took the first game, followed by a Winnipeg victory in the second tilt, setting up an exciting winner-takes-all Game 3 in the River City. In what has a serious have-to-see-it-to-believe-it feel, the Bombers won the game on the final play, when, following a missed field, Harvey Wylie’s attempt to punt the ball out of the end zone – a move that would have preserved a one-point victory – instead resulted in a game-clinching touchdown for Winnipeg. Calgary safety Farrell Funston was so distraught after the loss, he refused to board the plane back to Calgary, resurfacing in Toronto a couple days later. The lede for the game story by Winnipeg Free Press reporter Hal Sigurdson went as follows: “Harvey Wylie is intelligent, talented, forthright, imaginative and courteous. Today he probably wishes he were dead.” The Bombers would go on to beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 28-27, in the Grey Cup. This year marked the first official CFL season following the merger between the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union. After each team earned identical 30-7 victories while playing on the road, Winnipeg claimed the best-of-three series with a 23-7 win at home. The victory is widely known as the end of Edmonton’s dominance in the three-down game at the time. Edmonton finished atop the Western Division standings for five straight years, between 1953 and 1957, winning the Grey Cup three times over that stretch. But in ‘58, the Elks finished second and would finish second for four straight years, unable to win another Grey Cup until the 1975 season. As for the Bombers, it was the beginning of the dominating Bud Grant era, with Winnipeg winning the Grey Cup four times in five years, between 1958 and 1962. This one breaks from the West theme, moving over to the East, a division the Bombers have competed in for several years over the club’s history. What stood out most from this game was how heavily favoured the Argonauts were, having finished the ‘88 season a CFL-best 14-4, while the Bombers finished second in the East at 9-9. In what was the final game played at Exhibition Stadium, the Bombers weren’t just good, they were dominant for much of the 60 minutes. There were plenty of standout performances on the day, including a solid effort from QB Sean Salisbury, but few had as big an impact as cornerback Rod Hill, who finished with a tackle, a blocked punt, a fumble recovery, a touchdown, a knock down and an interception. “Just another day at the office for Rod,” a grinning head coach Mike Riley told the Free Press after the game. “I’m not surprised, though, he’s been doing it all season.” What made it particularly sweet for the Blue and Gold was that it avenged the year before, where the Bombers hosted the Argos in the East final and lost. Winnipeg completed the run with a Grey Cup victory, narrowly edging the 10-8 B.C. Lions by the slimmest of margins, 22-21, in Ottawa.

The Eagles are the only 8-1 team in the NFL. The Eagles did all they could on Dallas’ final drive to cough up the game. Dak Prescott needed to move the Cowboys 86 yards in 46 seconds for the potential winning score — and promptly got 56 yards of Eagles’ penalties to reach the 6-yard-line. On the cusp of a stunning comeback, Prescott instead was sacked by Josh Sweat for an 11-yard loss. After a penalty on the Cowboys moved them to the 27, Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for 22 yards, but the wideout was tackled by Darius Slay at the 5 to end the game. Prescott threw for 374 yards and three scores. Lamb had 11 catches for 191 yards. The NFC champion Eagles are playing like a team capable of another deep postseason run — the kind that could easily become derailed with a significant injury to Hurts. Hurts has downplayed the severity of the condition of his knee and scoffed at all questions — including when exactly he was hurt. He’s yet to even show up on the injury report.

Maxx Crosby had three of the Raiders’ eight sacks. Las Vegas held the Giants to 275 yards in the Raiders’ largest margin of victory since beating the Denver Broncos 37-12 on Nov. 15, 2020. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones left one play into the second quarter with a right knee injury. Tommy DeVito played the rest of the game and passed for 175 yards and a touchdown. Saquon Barkley rushed for 90 yards on 16 carries. This was the Raiders’ first game since coach Josh McDaniels, offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi and general manager Dave Ziegler were fired early in the week and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was benched. The result couldn’t have gone much better for the Raiders, who led 24-0 by halftime, which tied for their sixth-largest advantage when not allowing a point. The team played tight under McDaniels’ rigid control, but there was a noticeable ease in the locker room this week under Pierce, the former Giants linebacker. The question was whether that would translate on the field. It did, and from the beginning when Las Vegas went down the field and scored on a 17-yard jet sweep by wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. By halftime, the Raiders (4-5) already had scored a season high in points and Jacobs had already rushed for a season-best 86 yards. Las Vegas’ previous high was 21 points three weeks ago against the New England Patriots, with the final two coming on a safety. The Raiders’ offense ended a nine-game skid without scoring at least 20 points. Jacobs, who last season led the NFL in rushing, nearly ended a 13-game streak without a 100-yard performance. He was at 101 yards before losing 3 yards on his final carry. O’Connell was given the start this week over the ineffective Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer, and Pierce said it would be his job going forward. The QB commonly referred to as AOC completed 16 of 25 passes. For the Giants, the game couldn’t have gone much worse. They entered last in the league in total, scoring and passing offense. New York’s offense still hasn’t scored a touchdown in the first quarter, and it didn’t reach the end zone in this game until early in the fourth quarter and then after trailing 27-0. At 2-7, the Giants already have as many losses as all of last season when they went 9-7-1 and made the playoffs. Interceptions by Amik Robertson and Nate Hobbs led to the final 10 points of the half for the Raiders to all but end any doubt about the outcome. Las Vegas outgained New York 240-108 in the opening 30 minutes. INJURIES Raiders RT Thayer Munford (neck) and LBs Divine Deablo (ankle) and Luke Masterson (concussion) did not play. … Las Vegas CB Marcus Peters left with a knee injury. … Giants OTs Andrew Thomas (hamstring) and Evan Neal (ankle) returned after missing time.

To continue reading, please subscribe: * HOUSTON (AP) — When running back Dare Ogunbowale was thrust into action as Houston’s emergency kicker Sunday against Tampa Bay he was ready for whatever he might be asked to do. He handled the opening kickoff of the second half with kicker Kaʻimi Fairbairn out with a quadriceps injury and figured he’d soon be called on to kick an extra point. But his mindset changed after the Texans attempted 2-point conversions on three consecutive touchdowns. “Once they started doing the 2-point, I figured I was off it,” he said. “But I was staying ready for it.” And with the game tied in the fourth quarter, the Texans called on him to attempt his first field goal since high school. His 29-yard kick sailed straight through the uprights to put the Texans on top 33-30 with nine minutes to go. They went on to a 39-37 victory on a late TD pass by C.J. Stroud. “To win games in the league you never know what’s going to happen,” Ogunbowale said. “That game as you saw came down to the wire. A lot of guys had to step up. I’m just glad I was one of the guys that was able to step up and help the team win.” Coach DeMeco Ryans raved about his contributions Sunday. “Dare, he’s truly the player of the game,” Ryans said. “For him stepping up the way he did for us was outstanding by him.” Ogunbowale is the first non-kicker or punter to make a field goal since Wes Welker did it on Oct. 10, 2004, for the Dolphins against New England. When told of that stat, Ogunbowale joked that he might need to ship his cleats to the Hall of Fame. “I did not know that,” he said. “That’s pretty cool, I’m going to have to get these shoes to Canton. I don’t know how that works.” Although Ogunbowale said he had kicked field goals in high school, he added that he was never “on the depth chart” as a kicker. He didn’t even play football until his junior year and spent most of his childhood playing soccer. The 29-year-old said that he’s been Houston’s emergency kicker since last season when he showed special teams coordinator Frank Ross his special skill. “Last year we went through the whole emergency kicker thing, and I told him I could do it,” he said. “I did it in practice. I was always just kind of the unwritten emergency kicker, but nothing ever came up that I needed to be out there kicking.” He added that he could have hit an even longer field goal than the one he made Sunday. “We had a kicking competition in college, and I kicked a 45-yarder,” he said. “I’ve got some power in the leg if I need to.” Though most of the attention was on his field goal, Ogunbowale said he was much more nervous on the kickoffs.

Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. “Because you’ve got a lot of time to think,” he said. “The field goal, you run out there… (you) didn’t even have time to get nervous versus the kickoff. You just stand back there waiting for the ref to blow the whistle, so you do a lot more thinking. But the field goal, I was pretty poised.” Despite his success on Sunday, Ogunbowale has no designs on trying to steal Fairbairn’s position. “His job is safe,” he said with a laugh. “I want no part of that. He’s all good.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-06 00:33:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"07b64d61b9391fb4feec9253b04d0e60","title":"Kenny Moore’s two pick-6s help Colts snap 3-game skid with 27-13 victory over Panthers","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/football/nfl/2023/11/05/kenny-moores-two-pick-6s-help-colts-snap-3-game-skid-with-27-13-victory-over-panthers","keywords":["NFL"],"creator":["Steve Reed, The Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP) — Kenny Moore returned two Bryce Young interceptions for touchdowns, Jonathan Taylor caught a touchdown pass from Gardner Minshew and the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Carolina Panthers 27-13 on Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak. Indianapolis’ much-maligned defense had allowed at least 37 points in each of its past three games and had allowed more points than any team in the league, but had no problem slowing down the No. 1 overall pick and a mostly listless Panthers offense. Moore became the first Colts player in history with two pick-6s in a game and the first NFL player to accomplish the feat since Tampa Bay’s Mike Edwards did it against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2 of the 2021 season. Young finished 24 of 39 for 173 yards with three interceptions to fall to 1-6 as an NFL starter. Minshew threw for 127 yards and Taylor ran for 47 yards for the Colts (4-5). Adam Thielen, in the midst of a career season, was limited to 29 yards on five receptions for the Panthers (1-7), who matched their worst start in franchise history. The Colts dominated the Panthers in the first half and took a 20-3 lead into the locker room after Moore stepped in front of Young’s pass in the flat and took it 49 yards for a score. Carolina appeared to have regained momentum after cutting the Colts lead to 10 in the third quarter before Young overshot Miles Sanders and Moore grabbed it and raced 66 yards to end zone to give the Colts a 27-10 lead early in the fourth quarter. Indianapolis sacked Young four times and limited the Panthers to 62 total yards in the first half to take control. Young has now been sacked 26 in his seven NFL starts. It was a mistake-filled first half for the Panthers. It started when recently signed Eku Leota lined up offside on a Colts punt on fourth-and-1 from deep in their end of the field. That mental error gifted the Colts with a first down and led to a 15-play drive that resulted in a 26-yard field goal by Matt Gay. The Colts made it 10-0 after Panthers safety Xavier Woods was called for hitting Michael Pittman, considered a defenseless receiver, on a crossing route setting up Taylor’s 10-yard TD reception. After Gay’s 57-yard field goal made it 13-3, Young threw a pass in the flat toward Chuba Hubbard that Moore easily made a break on and took to the end zone. The Panthers showed some life in the third quarter behind Miles Sanders, who has seen his playing time limited of late because of fumbles and ineffectiveness. Sanders made four big plays leading to Young’s 5-yard TD pass to DJ Chark, cutting the Colts lead to 20-10. But Moore’s second pick-6 all but sealed the win as Panthers coach Frank Reich failed to beat the Colts, who fired him last season. INJURIES Colts: CB Tony Brown (concussion), WR Josh Downs (knee) and TE Drew Ogletree (foot) all left the game with injuries and did not return. Panthers: OLB Brian Burns (concussion), CB C.J.

Then, suddenly, they couldn’t cross the 50-yard-line. Bagent, who threw two of his three interceptions and lost a fumble on a sack in a nine-minute span of the fourth quarter, blamed himself for the Bears’ offensive implosion in a 24-17 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. Chicago, which lost the turnover battle 5-0, never got past its own 35-yard line in five series after tying it at 17 on Cairo Santos’ 31-yard field goal with 3:27 left in the third quarter. “It all comes to me in that last quarter being able to do a better job of taking care of the ball,” Bagent said. Coach Matt Eberflus “talks about how important it is every single day,” Bagent added. “It was basically just me (making mistakes) there in that last quarter.” Making his third straight start in place of an injured Justin Fields, Bagent was 15 of 19 for 201 yards with two touchdowns through three quarters. He went 3 of 11 for 19 yards with the three turnovers from there. Two plays after the Saints went ahead 24-17, safety Marcus Maye made a diving interception of a pass Bagent said he threw late over the middle. After Chicago stopped Derek Carr on a fourth-down sneak at their 17, Bagent was picked off by cornerback Paulson Adebo. “It was good on their part and bad on my part,” Bagent said. “Tight coverage, and they made a couple of really good plays. Hats off to them, but I have to probably go somewhere else with the ball.” Chicago’s defense kept giving the offense more chances, but it could not take advantage. The Bears failed to pick up a first down after the Saints downed a punt at the 2, and they turned the ball over following a missed 47-yard field by Blake Grupe with 2:27 left that kept them in the game. The Saints then ran out the clock in a bizarre fourth quarter in which all 34 plays run by both teams started in Bears’ territory. “We came kind of to a screaming halt there,” said tight end Cole Kmet, who had touchdown catches on two of Chicago’s first three possessions. “I don’t know if it ever happened before where they are on our side of the 50 for the entire fourth quarter. I’ve never seen that in my life.” Kmet capped the Bears’ opening drive by outfighting safety Tyrann Mathieu in the end zone for an 18-yard grab. Bagent hit Kmet again for a 9-yard score in the second quarter for a 14-7 lead. Bagent scrambled eight times for 70 yards, running back D’Onta Foreman gained 82 yards on 18 carries through three quarters and the Bears had outgained the Saints 348-171 at one point. “It’s frustrating because there were some opportunities to really extend the lead,” Kmet said. “I really think Tyson played great, and I think the film will show that. We can do better as a skill group for Tyson in terms of being more friendly with the routes and making more plays for him.” The Bears lost by only one touchdown despite their five turnovers and getting penalized eight times for 71 yards to the Saints’ one flag for 5 yards. Those negative numbers prompted some positivity from Eberflus, who also lauded the addition of defensive end Montez Sweat. Sweat, acquired in a trade with Washington this week and signed to a long-term contract extension Saturday, had two tackles and broke up a pass in his first game. He has 35 1/2 sacks in 4 1/2 seasons.

Fields, who practiced on a limited basis Friday, might be activated Thursday when Chicago hosts Carolina.

Berry Ladies showed their supremacy in just two minutes after kick off when Fakiha Alhassan broke the deadlock with a sublime finish. In a fierce battle between the two teams with Sea Lions eager to equalise and make the game even, Berry Ladies had other plans as the first half ended 1-0 in favor of Berry Ladies. Sea Lions looked more composed and hungry in the early stages of the second half. Their tenacity and persistence didn't fail them as they were awarded a penalty which was calmly converted by Hannah Donkor inside 49 minutes. The visitors couldn't keep up the pressure from the host after scoring from the leveler. Berry Ladies doubled their lead through Elizabeth Adjoa Boateng in the 51st minute. Without leaving a glimpse of hope for the visitors, Janet Korkor Osei scored her first goal of the day and Berry Ladies third in the 77th minute.

After seeing Heinicke come up short in a 31-28 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, he still has not locked himself into a long-time starter at quarterback. Smith liked some of what he saw of the veteran, who finished 21 for 38 for 268 yards with one touchdown and one interception, but he was not ready after the loss to declare him the full-time starter. “He did turn the ball over, but I thought he operated on third down pretty well,” Smith said. “We’ll huddle up and evaluate. I thought he gave us some chances.” Trailing 24-21 with 9:06 to play, Heinicke drove the Falcons 79 yards for a touchdown that gave Atlanta the lead back with 2:08 to play. The drive included a critical 13-yard scramble by Heinicke on third-and-9 that kept the drive alive. Heinicke finished with 20 rushing yards on three carries and was sacked once. Heinicke said he was pleased about his game, but wishes he had a few plays back, including a third-quarter interception that led to the Vikings taking the lead. “I don’t think that was a relationship-type of deal (with the receivers),” Heinicke said. “That was just a bad throw.” Ridder started the first eight games of the season for the Falcons, but was replaced at halftime last week in a 28-23 loss to the Titans. The Falcons scored 20 points in the second half against the Titans with Heinicke leading the offense. Smith would not commit to a quarterback beyond having Heinicke start against the Vikings, and Heinicke said he isn’t focused on who will start next week when the Falcons go to Arizona to face the Cardinals. “I’m not really thinking about that right now. I’m still (upset) about the loss,” Heinicke said. “We will come in tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday and see what happens, but just still thinking about the game right now.” Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions.

And the late touchdown drive put the Falcons in position to get over the .500 mark. The Falcons had to settle for field goals on their first two trips to the red zone, including one drive that started at the Vikings 1-yard-line following Joshua Dobbs’ fumble. A penalty and a few failed run plays led to a 23-yard field goal. “You can’t sugarcoat it or make excuses,” Smith said. “We had our chances and didn’t get it done.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-05 23:49:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"21c45b0874b4b5d5d691b5f4b3a01b17","title":"Late interception dooms Patriots in 20-17 loss to Commanders.

(AP) — Mac Jones appeared to have put his earlier struggles behind when he moved the Patriots into Washington territory with under 2 minutes to play. A game-tying field goal was in sight and the go-ahead touchdown remained a possibility, too. On second-and-8 from the Commanders 41, Jones dropped back in the pocket and threw down the middle to JuJu Smith-Schuster. The ball bounced off the receiver’s hands and into the arms of Jartavius Martin, sealing Washington’s 20-17 victory. “I feel like I’ve been saying it every week,” Patriots tight end Hunter Henry said. “We’ve had too many of those this year, and another one today.” The Patriots fell to 2-7 for the first time since Bill Belichick’s first season as their head coach and lost to the Commanders (4-5) at home for the first time since 1996. Belichick remains 17 victories short of breaking Don Shula’s all-time wins record, and now there is reason to doubt he will last long enough in New England to do it. Sunday’s loss came at the hands of a team that had already given up on this season, trading away its two top pass rushers last week. The rest of the season is a referendum on quarterback Sam Howell, a fifth-round pick in 2022; coach Ron Rivera is not expected to return. Asked if this loss stung more because the other team was “tanking,” Patriots center David Andrews said, “It stings because it’s a loss.” “It’s not going to break my spirit,” he said. “It’s not going to break our spirit.” Such turmoil may be expected in Washington, a franchise that has gone through eight coaches and three nicknames since it last won a game in New England. But Belichick’s lack of success since Tom Brady left in 2020 has Patriots fans wondering if he will last the season. And after Jones showed promise in his rookie year, the next two have not shown the progress that would give the team faith he is the answer. “I think the biggest thing … is remaining confident in yourself,” Jones said. “When you do everything you can every day, you should have no regrets. I have no regrets. I do need to do things better, but I’m always going to work hard and put in the hours. That’s all I can do, right? ” Belichick didn’t even try to answer questions about the team’s struggles after the game, mumbling the same platitudes about how “all three units” need improvement. Every decision he made was because he thought it gave them the best chance to win. “We had our chances. You know, had a chance there at the end,” he said. “Couldn’t make enough plays.” Defensive lineman Deatrich Wise Jr. conceded that the routine is getting repetitive. “We continue to say the same things,” he said. “Our spirits aren’t broken just because we have a loss.” Jones completed 24 of 44 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown, a well-thrown 14-yarder to Henry that gave the Patriots a 14-10 lead in the second quarter. Rhamondre Stevenson broke free for a 64-yard touchdown run that was the longest Patriots play from scrimmage this season.

Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. But New England also hurt itself with mental mistakes, most notably defensive lineman Mack Wilson lining up offside on a punt by Washington. The penalty gave the Commanders the ball back; although they didn’t advance, they forced New England to burn off its last two timeouts before getting the ball back with 2:07 to play. Jones seemed to be moving the Patriots into position for at least a tying score, advancing to the Washington 43-yard line. Instead, the interception sealed the loss. “It’s all on me,” Smith-Schuster said. “He put the ball in a good position. I’ve just got to make the catch, secure it. Now, we’re in field goal range. Obviously, I didn’t do that. Fell short.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-05 23:31:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7de298fbf7d3f1c7374d3fd8a68f4694","title":"Big Blue brace for Leos","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2023/11/05/big-blue-brace-for-leos","keywords":["Bomber Report","CFL","Sports","Top News"],"creator":["Jeff Hamilton"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have found their date for the Western Final, with the B.C.

Lions booking their ticket to IG Field after defeating the Calgary Stampeders in the division’s semi-final Saturday evening. It’s the second straight year the first-place Bombers will meet the second-place Lions for a chance to play in the Grey Cup. Winnipeg earned that honour last year with a 28-20 victory before falling to the Toronto Argonauts by a point in the championship game. While it’s the second time the Bombers will play B.C. in as many years, it’s the fourth consecutive Western final they’ll be a part of. It’s a streak that first began with a win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2019, with the Bombers going on to defeat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at home to snap their Grey Cup drought after 29 years. Winnipeg Blue Bombers’ Brady Oliveira (20) scores a touchdown as B.C. Lions’ Ben Hladik, right, watches during overtime CFL football action, in Vancouver last month. (Darryl Dyck / The Canadian Press files) In fact, dating back to the 1958 season, the first official CFL season, the Bombers have played in 30 division finals – split between the West and East – and earned 16 wins, resulting in 12 Grey Cups. The Bombers are hoping to add a 13th league title in 2023, a victory that would cement this era’s team as a CFL dynasty. But rather than look too far ahead, let’s take a glance back at some of the more memorable Finals the Bombers have been a part of. There were plenty of options, but we’ve narrowed it down to the top-5. This isn’t recency bias. The 2019 West Final was not only among the most entertaining and nail-biting affairs ever to be played, the fact in came after a dominating road win in Calgary against the Stampeders in the semi-final the week before made the victory all the more impressive. Playing in front of a sold-out crowd as Mosaic Stadium, the Bombers led right down to the wire, before narrowly escaping with the win after a late surge from the Riders. “It was like watching a thriller movie and the suspenseful part lasts six minutes and you just want to see what happens,” Bombers receiver Drew Wolitarksy said at the time. “It’s a crazy feeling and I don’t know any other thing I’ve ever done that I could use to express it.” “I think my heart stopped and went again like three or four times,” added receiver Nic Demski. “I was just kind of playing peek-a-boo with myself, covering one eye and seeing what was going on out there.” A Bombers game-sealing interception was called back. Then a missed interception led to a Riders completed pass and a new set of downs with seconds remaining on the clock, the home side trailing by just a TD. But despite three attempts at finding the end zone, the Bombers defence proved to be too much to handle. The game ultimately ended with then-Saskatchewan QB Cody Fajardo connecting with the crossbar of the uprights, immediately making it a dead play. The Bombers would go on to beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, in Calgary, to snap their Grey Cup drought of nearly 30 years. This was another victory for the Bombers in enemy territory, with BC Place packed to the back rows, just hundreds short of 60,000. The Lions finished two points ahead of the Bombers in the West standings, with the season-series split one game apiece. The Bombers were riding high off a 55-20 victory over Edmonton in the semi-final a week earlier, and they managed to carry that momentum into their tilt with the Lions. The Bombers, who were led by a three-touchdown performance from QB Tom Clements, led 17-7 at halftime before allowing just seven points to the Lions in the final 30 minutes, including none in the fourth quarter. The win was significant for many reasons, but none greater than the fact it had been 19 years since the Bombers had punched their ticket to the Grey Cup, last playing in the championship game in 1965, in what’s widely known as the “Wind Bowl.” To show their appreciation, fans showed up to the Winnipeg airport to welcome the boys home, with police estimating between 2,500-3,500 people. “We lost about a dozen ceiling tiles because a few of the fans were throwing around a football and volleyball,” then-terminal manager George Elliott told the Free Press at the time. “We lost four benches and the base of an advertising sign was broken, but really, nothing expensive was lost.” The Bombers capped the season off with a dominating 47-17 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Grey Cup, giving Winnipeg its first championship since 1962. This was during the era where the winner of the West final was determined over a best-of-three series, with the first game played in Calgary before moving to Winnipeg for the final two. It’s important to note that all three games were played over a single week, between Nov. 17-24. Calgary took the first game, followed by a Winnipeg victory in the second tilt, setting up an exciting winner-takes-all Game 3 in the River City. In what has a serious have-to-see-it-to-believe-it feel, the Bombers won the game on the final play, when, following a missed field, Harvey Wylie’s attempt to punt the ball out of the end zone – a move that would have preserved a one-point victory – instead resulted in a game-clinching touchdown for Winnipeg. Calgary safety Farrell Funston was so distraught after the loss, he refused to board the plane back to Calgary, resurfacing in Toronto a couple days later. The lede for the game story by Winnipeg Free Press reporter Hal Sigurdson went as follows: “Harvey Wylie is intelligent, talented, forthright, imaginative and courteous. Today he probably wishes he were dead.” The Bombers would go on to beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 28-27, in the Grey Cup. This year marked the first official CFL season following the merger between the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union. After each team earned identical 30-7 victories while playing on the road, Winnipeg claimed the best-of-three series with a 23-7 win at home. The victory is widely known as the end of Edmonton’s dominance in the three-down game at the time. Edmonton finished atop the Western Division standings for five straight years, between 1953 and 1957, winning the Grey Cup three times over that stretch. But in ‘58, the Elks finished second and would finish second for four straight years, unable to win another Grey Cup until the 1975 season. As for the Bombers, it was the beginning of the dominating Bud Grant era, with Winnipeg winning the Grey Cup four times in five years, between 1958 and 1962. This one breaks from the West theme, moving over to the East, a division the Bombers have competed in for several years over the club’s history. What stood out most from this game was how heavily favoured the Argonauts were, having finished the ‘88 season a CFL-best 14-4, while the Bombers finished second in the East at 9-9. In what was the final game played at Exhibition Stadium, the Bombers weren’t just good, they were dominant for much of the 60 minutes. There were plenty of standout performances on the day, including a solid effort from QB Sean Salisbury, but few had as big an impact as cornerback Rod Hill, who finished with a tackle, a blocked punt, a fumble recovery, a touchdown, a knock down and an interception. “Just another day at the office for Rod,” a grinning head coach Mike Riley told the Free Press after the game. “I’m not surprised, though, he’s been doing it all season.” What made it particularly sweet for the Blue and Gold was that it avenged the year before, where the Bombers hosted the Argos in the East final and lost. Winnipeg completed the run with a Grey Cup victory, narrowly edging the 10-8 B.C. Lions by the slimmest of margins, 22-21, in Ottawa.

The Eagles are the only 8-1 team in the NFL. The Eagles did all they could on Dallas’ final drive to cough up the game. Dak Prescott needed to move the Cowboys 86 yards in 46 seconds for the potential winning score — and promptly got 56 yards of Eagles’ penalties to reach the 6-yard-line. On the cusp of a stunning comeback, Prescott instead was sacked by Josh Sweat for an 11-yard loss. After a penalty on the Cowboys moved them to the 27, Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for 22 yards, but the wideout was tackled by Darius Slay at the 5 to end the game. Prescott threw for 374 yards and three scores. Lamb had 11 catches for 191 yards. The NFC champion Eagles are playing like a team capable of another deep postseason run — the kind that could easily become derailed with a significant injury to Hurts. Hurts has downplayed the severity of the condition of his knee and scoffed at all questions — including when exactly he was hurt. He’s yet to even show up on the injury report.

Maxx Crosby had three of the Raiders’ eight sacks. Las Vegas held the Giants to 275 yards in the Raiders’ largest margin of victory since beating the Denver Broncos 37-12 on Nov. 15, 2020. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones left one play into the second quarter with a right knee injury. Tommy DeVito played the rest of the game and passed for 175 yards and a touchdown. Saquon Barkley rushed for 90 yards on 16 carries. This was the Raiders’ first game since coach Josh McDaniels, offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi and general manager Dave Ziegler were fired early in the week and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was benched. The result couldn’t have gone much better for the Raiders, who led 24-0 by halftime, which tied for their sixth-largest advantage when not allowing a point. The team played tight under McDaniels’ rigid control, but there was a noticeable ease in the locker room this week under Pierce, the former Giants linebacker. The question was whether that would translate on the field. It did, and from the beginning when Las Vegas went down the field and scored on a 17-yard jet sweep by wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. By halftime, the Raiders (4-5) already had scored a season high in points and Jacobs had already rushed for a season-best 86 yards. Las Vegas’ previous high was 21 points three weeks ago against the New England Patriots, with the final two coming on a safety. The Raiders’ offense ended a nine-game skid without scoring at least 20 points. Jacobs, who last season led the NFL in rushing, nearly ended a 13-game streak without a 100-yard performance. He was at 101 yards before losing 3 yards on his final carry. O’Connell was given the start this week over the ineffective Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer, and Pierce said it would be his job going forward. The QB commonly referred to as AOC completed 16 of 25 passes. For the Giants, the game couldn’t have gone much worse. They entered last in the league in total, scoring and passing offense. New York’s offense still hasn’t scored a touchdown in the first quarter, and it didn’t reach the end zone in this game until early in the fourth quarter and then after trailing 27-0. At 2-7, the Giants already have as many losses as all of last season when they went 9-7-1 and made the playoffs. Interceptions by Amik Robertson and Nate Hobbs led to the final 10 points of the half for the Raiders to all but end any doubt about the outcome. Las Vegas outgained New York 240-108 in the opening 30 minutes. INJURIES Raiders RT Thayer Munford (neck) and LBs Divine Deablo (ankle) and Luke Masterson (concussion) did not play. … Las Vegas CB Marcus Peters left with a knee injury. … Giants OTs Andrew Thomas (hamstring) and Evan Neal (ankle) returned after missing time. Thomas hadn’t played since the season opener, and Neal missed the previous two games.

He handled the opening kickoff of the second half with kicker Kaʻimi Fairbairn out with a quadriceps injury and figured he’d soon be called on to kick an extra point. But his mindset changed after the Texans attempted 2-point conversions on three consecutive touchdowns. “Once they started doing the 2-point, I figured I was off it,” he said. “But I was staying ready for it.” And with the game tied in the fourth quarter, the Texans called on him to attempt his first field goal since high school. His 29-yard kick sailed straight through the uprights to put the Texans on top 33-30 with nine minutes to go. They went on to a 39-37 victory on a late TD pass by C.J. Stroud. “To win games in the league you never know what’s going to happen,” Ogunbowale said. “That game as you saw came down to the wire. A lot of guys had to step up. I’m just glad I was one of the guys that was able to step up and help the team win.” Coach DeMeco Ryans raved about his contributions Sunday. “Dare, he’s truly the player of the game,” Ryans said. “For him stepping up the way he did for us was outstanding by him.” Ogunbowale is the first non-kicker or punter to make a field goal since Wes Welker did it on Oct. 10, 2004, for the Dolphins against New England. When told of that stat, Ogunbowale joked that he might need to ship his cleats to the Hall of Fame. “I did not know that,” he said. “That’s pretty cool, I’m going to have to get these shoes to Canton. I don’t know how that works.” Although Ogunbowale said he had kicked field goals in high school, he added that he was never “on the depth chart” as a kicker. He didn’t even play football until his junior year and spent most of his childhood playing soccer. The 29-year-old said that he’s been Houston’s emergency kicker since last season when he showed special teams coordinator Frank Ross his special skill. “Last year we went through the whole emergency kicker thing, and I told him I could do it,” he said. “I did it in practice. I was always just kind of the unwritten emergency kicker, but nothing ever came up that I needed to be out there kicking.” He added that he could have hit an even longer field goal than the one he made Sunday. “We had a kicking competition in college, and I kicked a 45-yarder,” he said. “I’ve got some power in the leg if I need to.” Though most of the attention was on his field goal, Ogunbowale said he was much more nervous on the kickoffs.

Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. “Because you’ve got a lot of time to think,” he said. “The field goal, you run out there… (you) didn’t even have time to get nervous versus the kickoff. You just stand back there waiting for the ref to blow the whistle, so you do a lot more thinking. But the field goal, I was pretty poised.” Despite his success on Sunday, Ogunbowale has no designs on trying to steal Fairbairn’s position. “His job is safe,” he said with a laugh. “I want no part of that. He’s all good.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-06 00:33:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"07b64d61b9391fb4feec9253b04d0e60","title":"Kenny Moore’s two pick-6s help Colts snap 3-game skid with 27-13 victory over Panthers","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/football/nfl/2023/11/05/kenny-moores-two-pick-6s-help-colts-snap-3-game-skid-with-27-13-victory-over-panthers","keywords":["NFL"],"creator":["Steve Reed, The Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP) — Kenny Moore returned two Bryce Young interceptions for touchdowns, Jonathan Taylor caught a touchdown pass from Gardner Minshew and the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Carolina Panthers 27-13 on Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak. Indianapolis’ much-maligned defense had allowed at least 37 points in each of its past three games and had allowed more points than any team in the league, but had no problem slowing down the No. 1 overall pick and a mostly listless Panthers offense. Moore became the first Colts player in history with two pick-6s in a game and the first NFL player to accomplish the feat since Tampa Bay’s Mike Edwards did it against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2 of the 2021 season. Young finished 24 of 39 for 173 yards with three interceptions to fall to 1-6 as an NFL starter. Minshew threw for 127 yards and Taylor ran for 47 yards for the Colts (4-5). Adam Thielen, in the midst of a career season, was limited to 29 yards on five receptions for the Panthers (1-7), who matched their worst start in franchise history. The Colts dominated the Panthers in the first half and took a 20-3 lead into the locker room after Moore stepped in front of Young’s pass in the flat and took it 49 yards for a score. Carolina appeared to have regained momentum after cutting the Colts lead to 10 in the third quarter before Young overshot Miles Sanders and Moore grabbed it and raced 66 yards to end zone to give the Colts a 27-10 lead early in the fourth quarter. Indianapolis sacked Young four times and limited the Panthers to 62 total yards in the first half to take control. Young has now been sacked 26 in his seven NFL starts. It was a mistake-filled first half for the Panthers. It started when recently signed Eku Leota lined up offside on a Colts punt on fourth-and-1 from deep in their end of the field. That mental error gifted the Colts with a first down and led to a 15-play drive that resulted in a 26-yard field goal by Matt Gay. The Colts made it 10-0 after Panthers safety Xavier Woods was called for hitting Michael Pittman, considered a defenseless receiver, on a crossing route setting up Taylor’s 10-yard TD reception. After Gay’s 57-yard field goal made it 13-3, Young threw a pass in the flat toward Chuba Hubbard that Moore easily made a break on and took to the end zone. The Panthers showed some life in the third quarter behind Miles Sanders, who has seen his playing time limited of late because of fumbles and ineffectiveness. Sanders made four big plays leading to Young’s 5-yard TD pass to DJ Chark, cutting the Colts lead to 20-10. But Moore’s second pick-6 all but sealed the win as Panthers coach Frank Reich failed to beat the Colts, who fired him last season. INJURIES Colts: CB Tony Brown (concussion), WR Josh Downs (knee) and TE Drew Ogletree (foot) all left the game with injuries and did not return. Panthers: OLB Brian Burns (concussion), CB C.J. Henderson (concussion), S Xavier Woods (thigh) and TE Stephen Sullivan (shoulder) left the game with injuries and did not return.

To continue reading, please subscribe: * NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Undrafted rookie quarterback Tyson Bagent and the Chicago Bears had their way with one of the top-rated defenses in the NFL for nearly three quarters. Then, suddenly, they couldn’t cross the 50-yard-line. Bagent, who threw two of his three interceptions and lost a fumble on a sack in a nine-minute span of the fourth quarter, blamed himself for the Bears’ offensive implosion in a 24-17 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. Chicago, which lost the turnover battle 5-0, never got past its own 35-yard line in five series after tying it at 17 on Cairo Santos’ 31-yard field goal with 3:27 left in the third quarter. “It all comes to me in that last quarter being able to do a better job of taking care of the ball,” Bagent said. Coach Matt Eberflus “talks about how important it is every single day,” Bagent added. “It was basically just me (making mistakes) there in that last quarter.” Making his third straight start in place of an injured Justin Fields, Bagent was 15 of 19 for 201 yards with two touchdowns through three quarters. He went 3 of 11 for 19 yards with the three turnovers from there. Two plays after the Saints went ahead 24-17, safety Marcus Maye made a diving interception of a pass Bagent said he threw late over the middle. After Chicago stopped Derek Carr on a fourth-down sneak at their 17, Bagent was picked off by cornerback Paulson Adebo. “It was good on their part and bad on my part,” Bagent said. “Tight coverage, and they made a couple of really good plays. Hats off to them, but I have to probably go somewhere else with the ball.” Chicago’s defense kept giving the offense more chances, but it could not take advantage. The Bears failed to pick up a first down after the Saints downed a punt at the 2, and they turned the ball over following a missed 47-yard field by Blake Grupe with 2:27 left that kept them in the game. The Saints then ran out the clock in a bizarre fourth quarter in which all 34 plays run by both teams started in Bears’ territory. “We came kind of to a screaming halt there,” said tight end Cole Kmet, who had touchdown catches on two of Chicago’s first three possessions. “I don’t know if it ever happened before where they are on our side of the 50 for the entire fourth quarter. I’ve never seen that in my life.” Kmet capped the Bears’ opening drive by outfighting safety Tyrann Mathieu in the end zone for an 18-yard grab. Bagent hit Kmet again for a 9-yard score in the second quarter for a 14-7 lead. Bagent scrambled eight times for 70 yards, running back D’Onta Foreman gained 82 yards on 18 carries through three quarters and the Bears had outgained the Saints 348-171 at one point. “It’s frustrating because there were some opportunities to really extend the lead,” Kmet said. “I really think Tyson played great, and I think the film will show that. We can do better as a skill group for Tyson in terms of being more friendly with the routes and making more plays for him.” The Bears lost by only one touchdown despite their five turnovers and getting penalized eight times for 71 yards to the Saints’ one flag for 5 yards. Those negative numbers prompted some positivity from Eberflus, who also lauded the addition of defensive end Montez Sweat. Sweat, acquired in a trade with Washington this week and signed to a long-term contract extension Saturday, had two tackles and broke up a pass in his first game. He has 35 1/2 sacks in 4 1/2 seasons.

Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. “We’re all excited,” Eberflus said. “You add a pass rusher to your defense, that’s a big deal for us going into our future.” The immediate future may not include Bagent, who is 1-2 in three starts a year after playing for Division II Shepherd College. Fields, who practiced on a limited basis Friday, might be activated Thursday when Chicago hosts Carolina. Bagent “had really good moments in the starts that he’s had, and he’s got to build off of that,” Eberflus said. “The most important thing Tyson can do now is learn and get better.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-06 00:14:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e1defbf2c3c7dde49ef42a6cb63266e6","title":"Pearlpia Ladies winless run continue in Dreamz Ladies draw - Northern Zone results","link":"https://www.ghanafa.org/pearlpia-ladies-winless-run-continue-in-dreamz-ladies-draw-northern-zone-results","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pearlpia.Ladies winless run continue as Dreamz Ladies snatched a point in Tamale on Friday. &amp;nbsp; The Tamale side failed to make good use of their home fans as they played out a 1-1 draw wi...","content":"Pearlpia.Ladies winless run continue as Dreamz Ladies snatched a point in Tamale on Friday.

After seeing Heinicke come up short in a 31-28 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, he still has not locked himself into a long-time starter at quarterback. Smith liked some of what he saw of the veteran, who finished 21 for 38 for 268 yards with one touchdown and one interception, but he was not ready after the loss to declare him the full-time starter. “He did turn the ball over, but I thought he operated on third down pretty well,” Smith said. “We’ll huddle up and evaluate. I thought he gave us some chances.” Trailing 24-21 with 9:06 to play, Heinicke drove the Falcons 79 yards for a touchdown that gave Atlanta the lead back with 2:08 to play. The drive included a critical 13-yard scramble by Heinicke on third-and-9 that kept the drive alive. Heinicke finished with 20 rushing yards on three carries and was sacked once. Heinicke said he was pleased about his game, but wishes he had a few plays back, including a third-quarter interception that led to the Vikings taking the lead. “I don’t think that was a relationship-type of deal (with the receivers),” Heinicke said. “That was just a bad throw.” Ridder started the first eight games of the season for the Falcons, but was replaced at halftime last week in a 28-23 loss to the Titans. The Falcons scored 20 points in the second half against the Titans with Heinicke leading the offense. Smith would not commit to a quarterback beyond having Heinicke start against the Vikings, and Heinicke said he isn’t focused on who will start next week when the Falcons go to Arizona to face the Cardinals. “I’m not really thinking about that right now. I’m still (upset) about the loss,” Heinicke said. “We will come in tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday and see what happens, but just still thinking about the game right now.” Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions.

And the late touchdown drive put the Falcons in position to get over the .500 mark. The Falcons had to settle for field goals on their first two trips to the red zone, including one drive that started at the Vikings 1-yard-line following Joshua Dobbs’ fumble. A penalty and a few failed run plays led to a 23-yard field goal. “You can’t sugarcoat it or make excuses,” Smith said. “We had our chances and didn’t get it done.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-05 23:49:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"21c45b0874b4b5d5d691b5f4b3a01b17","title":"Late interception dooms Patriots in 20-17 loss to Commanders.

(AP) — Mac Jones appeared to have put his earlier struggles behind when he moved the Patriots into Washington territory with under 2 minutes to play. A game-tying field goal was in sight and the go-ahead touchdown remained a possibility, too. On second-and-8 from the Commanders 41, Jones dropped back in the pocket and threw down the middle to JuJu Smith-Schuster. The ball bounced off the receiver’s hands and into the arms of Jartavius Martin, sealing Washington’s 20-17 victory. “I feel like I’ve been saying it every week,” Patriots tight end Hunter Henry said. “We’ve had too many of those this year, and another one today.” The Patriots fell to 2-7 for the first time since Bill Belichick’s first season as their head coach and lost to the Commanders (4-5) at home for the first time since 1996. Belichick remains 17 victories short of breaking Don Shula’s all-time wins record, and now there is reason to doubt he will last long enough in New England to do it. Sunday’s loss came at the hands of a team that had already given up on this season, trading away its two top pass rushers last week. The rest of the season is a referendum on quarterback Sam Howell, a fifth-round pick in 2022; coach Ron Rivera is not expected to return. Asked if this loss stung more because the other team was “tanking,” Patriots center David Andrews said, “It stings because it’s a loss.” “It’s not going to break my spirit,” he said. “It’s not going to break our spirit.” Such turmoil may be expected in Washington, a franchise that has gone through eight coaches and three nicknames since it last won a game in New England. But Belichick’s lack of success since Tom Brady left in 2020 has Patriots fans wondering if he will last the season. And after Jones showed promise in his rookie year, the next two have not shown the progress that would give the team faith he is the answer. “I think the biggest thing … is remaining confident in yourself,” Jones said. “When you do everything you can every day, you should have no regrets. I have no regrets. I do need to do things better, but I’m always going to work hard and put in the hours. That’s all I can do, right? ” Belichick didn’t even try to answer questions about the team’s struggles after the game, mumbling the same platitudes about how “all three units” need improvement. Every decision he made was because he thought it gave them the best chance to win. “We had our chances. You know, had a chance there at the end,” he said. “Couldn’t make enough plays.” Defensive lineman Deatrich Wise Jr. conceded that the routine is getting repetitive. “We continue to say the same things,” he said. “Our spirits aren’t broken just because we have a loss.” Jones completed 24 of 44 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown, a well-thrown 14-yarder to Henry that gave the Patriots a 14-10 lead in the second quarter. Rhamondre Stevenson broke free for a 64-yard touchdown run that was the longest Patriots play from scrimmage this season.

Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. But New England also hurt itself with mental mistakes, most notably defensive lineman Mack Wilson lining up offside on a punt by Washington. The penalty gave the Commanders the ball back; although they didn’t advance, they forced New England to burn off its last two timeouts before getting the ball back with 2:07 to play. Jones seemed to be moving the Patriots into position for at least a tying score, advancing to the Washington 43-yard line. Instead, the interception sealed the loss. “It’s all on me,” Smith-Schuster said. “He put the ball in a good position. I’ve just got to make the catch, secure it. Now, we’re in field goal range. Obviously, I didn’t do that. Fell short.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-05 23:31:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7de298fbf7d3f1c7374d3fd8a68f4694","title":"Big Blue brace for Leos","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2023/11/05/big-blue-brace-for-leos","keywords":["Bomber Report","CFL","Sports","Top News"],"creator":["Jeff Hamilton"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have found their date for the Western Final, with the B.C.

Lions booking their ticket to IG Field after defeating the Calgary Stampeders in the division’s semi-final Saturday evening. It’s the second straight year the first-place Bombers will meet the second-place Lions for a chance to play in the Grey Cup. Winnipeg earned that honour last year with a 28-20 victory before falling to the Toronto Argonauts by a point in the championship game. While it’s the second time the Bombers will play B.C. in as many years, it’s the fourth consecutive Western final they’ll be a part of. It’s a streak that first began with a win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2019, with the Bombers going on to defeat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at home to snap their Grey Cup drought after 29 years. Winnipeg Blue Bombers’ Brady Oliveira (20) scores a touchdown as B.C. Lions’ Ben Hladik, right, watches during overtime CFL football action, in Vancouver last month. (Darryl Dyck / The Canadian Press files) In fact, dating back to the 1958 season, the first official CFL season, the Bombers have played in 30 division finals – split between the West and East – and earned 16 wins, resulting in 12 Grey Cups. The Bombers are hoping to add a 13th league title in 2023, a victory that would cement this era’s team as a CFL dynasty. But rather than look too far ahead, let’s take a glance back at some of the more memorable Finals the Bombers have been a part of. There were plenty of options, but we’ve narrowed it down to the top-5. This isn’t recency bias. The 2019 West Final was not only among the most entertaining and nail-biting affairs ever to be played, the fact in came after a dominating road win in Calgary against the Stampeders in the semi-final the week before made the victory all the more impressive. Playing in front of a sold-out crowd as Mosaic Stadium, the Bombers led right down to the wire, before narrowly escaping with the win after a late surge from the Riders. “It was like watching a thriller movie and the suspenseful part lasts six minutes and you just want to see what happens,” Bombers receiver Drew Wolitarksy said at the time. “It’s a crazy feeling and I don’t know any other thing I’ve ever done that I could use to express it.” “I think my heart stopped and went again like three or four times,” added receiver Nic Demski. “I was just kind of playing peek-a-boo with myself, covering one eye and seeing what was going on out there.” A Bombers game-sealing interception was called back. Then a missed interception led to a Riders completed pass and a new set of downs with seconds remaining on the clock, the home side trailing by just a TD. But despite three attempts at finding the end zone, the Bombers defence proved to be too much to handle. The game ultimately ended with then-Saskatchewan QB Cody Fajardo connecting with the crossbar of the uprights, immediately making it a dead play. The Bombers would go on to beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, in Calgary, to snap their Grey Cup drought of nearly 30 years. This was another victory for the Bombers in enemy territory, with BC Place packed to the back rows, just hundreds short of 60,000. The Lions finished two points ahead of the Bombers in the West standings, with the season-series split one game apiece. The Bombers were riding high off a 55-20 victory over Edmonton in the semi-final a week earlier, and they managed to carry that momentum into their tilt with the Lions. The Bombers, who were led by a three-touchdown performance from QB Tom Clements, led 17-7 at halftime before allowing just seven points to the Lions in the final 30 minutes, including none in the fourth quarter. The win was significant for many reasons, but none greater than the fact it had been 19 years since the Bombers had punched their ticket to the Grey Cup, last playing in the championship game in 1965, in what’s widely known as the “Wind Bowl.” To show their appreciation, fans showed up to the Winnipeg airport to welcome the boys home, with police estimating between 2,500-3,500 people. “We lost about a dozen ceiling tiles because a few of the fans were throwing around a football and volleyball,” then-terminal manager George Elliott told the Free Press at the time. “We lost four benches and the base of an advertising sign was broken, but really, nothing expensive was lost.” The Bombers capped the season off with a dominating 47-17 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Grey Cup, giving Winnipeg its first championship since 1962. This was during the era where the winner of the West final was determined over a best-of-three series, with the first game played in Calgary before moving to Winnipeg for the final two. It’s important to note that all three games were played over a single week, between Nov. 17-24. Calgary took the first game, followed by a Winnipeg victory in the second tilt, setting up an exciting winner-takes-all Game 3 in the River City. In what has a serious have-to-see-it-to-believe-it feel, the Bombers won the game on the final play, when, following a missed field, Harvey Wylie’s attempt to punt the ball out of the end zone – a move that would have preserved a one-point victory – instead resulted in a game-clinching touchdown for Winnipeg. Calgary safety Farrell Funston was so distraught after the loss, he refused to board the plane back to Calgary, resurfacing in Toronto a couple days later. The lede for the game story by Winnipeg Free Press reporter Hal Sigurdson went as follows: “Harvey Wylie is intelligent, talented, forthright, imaginative and courteous. Today he probably wishes he were dead.” The Bombers would go on to beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 28-27, in the Grey Cup. This year marked the first official CFL season following the merger between the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union. After each team earned identical 30-7 victories while playing on the road, Winnipeg claimed the best-of-three series with a 23-7 win at home. The victory is widely known as the end of Edmonton’s dominance in the three-down game at the time. Edmonton finished atop the Western Division standings for five straight years, between 1953 and 1957, winning the Grey Cup three times over that stretch. But in ‘58, the Elks finished second and would finish second for four straight years, unable to win another Grey Cup until the 1975 season. As for the Bombers, it was the beginning of the dominating Bud Grant era, with Winnipeg winning the Grey Cup four times in five years, between 1958 and 1962. This one breaks from the West theme, moving over to the East, a division the Bombers have competed in for several years over the club’s history. What stood out most from this game was how heavily favoured the Argonauts were, having finished the ‘88 season a CFL-best 14-4, while the Bombers finished second in the East at 9-9. In what was the final game played at Exhibition Stadium, the Bombers weren’t just good, they were dominant for much of the 60 minutes. There were plenty of standout performances on the day, including a solid effort from QB Sean Salisbury, but few had as big an impact as cornerback Rod Hill, who finished with a tackle, a blocked punt, a fumble recovery, a touchdown, a knock down and an interception. “Just another day at the office for Rod,” a grinning head coach Mike Riley told the Free Press after the game. “I’m not surprised, though, he’s been doing it all season.” What made it particularly sweet for the Blue and Gold was that it avenged the year before, where the Bombers hosted the Argos in the East final and lost. Winnipeg completed the run with a Grey Cup victory, narrowly edging the 10-8 B.C. Lions by the slimmest of margins, 22-21, in Ottawa.

The Eagles are the only 8-1 team in the NFL. The Eagles did all they could on Dallas’ final drive to cough up the game. Dak Prescott needed to move the Cowboys 86 yards in 46 seconds for the potential winning score — and promptly got 56 yards of Eagles’ penalties to reach the 6-yard-line. On the cusp of a stunning comeback, Prescott instead was sacked by Josh Sweat for an 11-yard loss. After a penalty on the Cowboys moved them to the 27, Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for 22 yards, but the wideout was tackled by Darius Slay at the 5 to end the game. Prescott threw for 374 yards and three scores. Lamb had 11 catches for 191 yards. The NFC champion Eagles are playing like a team capable of another deep postseason run — the kind that could easily become derailed with a significant injury to Hurts. Hurts has downplayed the severity of the condition of his knee and scoffed at all questions — including when exactly he was hurt. He’s yet to even show up on the injury report.

Maxx Crosby had three of the Raiders’ eight sacks. Las Vegas held the Giants to 275 yards in the Raiders’ largest margin of victory since beating the Denver Broncos 37-12 on Nov. 15, 2020. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones left one play into the second quarter with a right knee injury. Tommy DeVito played the rest of the game and passed for 175 yards and a touchdown. Saquon Barkley rushed for 90 yards on 16 carries. This was the Raiders’ first game since coach Josh McDaniels, offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi and general manager Dave Ziegler were fired early in the week and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was benched. The result couldn’t have gone much better for the Raiders, who led 24-0 by halftime, which tied for their sixth-largest advantage when not allowing a point. The team played tight under McDaniels’ rigid control, but there was a noticeable ease in the locker room this week under Pierce, the former Giants linebacker. The question was whether that would translate on the field. It did, and from the beginning when Las Vegas went down the field and scored on a 17-yard jet sweep by wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. By halftime, the Raiders (4-5) already had scored a season high in points and Jacobs had already rushed for a season-best 86 yards. Las Vegas’ previous high was 21 points three weeks ago against the New England Patriots, with the final two coming on a safety. The Raiders’ offense ended a nine-game skid without scoring at least 20 points. Jacobs, who last season led the NFL in rushing, nearly ended a 13-game streak without a 100-yard performance. He was at 101 yards before losing 3 yards on his final carry. O’Connell was given the start this week over the ineffective Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer, and Pierce said it would be his job going forward. The QB commonly referred to as AOC completed 16 of 25 passes. For the Giants, the game couldn’t have gone much worse. They entered last in the league in total, scoring and passing offense. New York’s offense still hasn’t scored a touchdown in the first quarter, and it didn’t reach the end zone in this game until early in the fourth quarter and then after trailing 27-0. At 2-7, the Giants already have as many losses as all of last season when they went 9-7-1 and made the playoffs. Interceptions by Amik Robertson and Nate Hobbs led to the final 10 points of the half for the Raiders to all but end any doubt about the outcome. Las Vegas outgained New York 240-108 in the opening 30 minutes. INJURIES Raiders RT Thayer Munford (neck) and LBs Divine Deablo (ankle) and Luke Masterson (concussion) did not play. … Las Vegas CB Marcus Peters left with a knee injury. … Giants OTs Andrew Thomas (hamstring) and Evan Neal (ankle) returned after missing time.

To continue reading, please subscribe: * HOUSTON (AP) — When running back Dare Ogunbowale was thrust into action as Houston’s emergency kicker Sunday against Tampa Bay he was ready for whatever he might be asked to do. He handled the opening kickoff of the second half with kicker Kaʻimi Fairbairn out with a quadriceps injury and figured he’d soon be called on to kick an extra point. But his mindset changed after the Texans attempted 2-point conversions on three consecutive touchdowns. “Once they started doing the 2-point, I figured I was off it,” he said. “But I was staying ready for it.” And with the game tied in the fourth quarter, the Texans called on him to attempt his first field goal since high school. His 29-yard kick sailed straight through the uprights to put the Texans on top 33-30 with nine minutes to go. They went on to a 39-37 victory on a late TD pass by C.J. Stroud. “To win games in the league you never know what’s going to happen,” Ogunbowale said. “That game as you saw came down to the wire. A lot of guys had to step up. I’m just glad I was one of the guys that was able to step up and help the team win.” Coach DeMeco Ryans raved about his contributions Sunday. “Dare, he’s truly the player of the game,” Ryans said. “For him stepping up the way he did for us was outstanding by him.” Ogunbowale is the first non-kicker or punter to make a field goal since Wes Welker did it on Oct. 10, 2004, for the Dolphins against New England. When told of that stat, Ogunbowale joked that he might need to ship his cleats to the Hall of Fame. “I did not know that,” he said. “That’s pretty cool, I’m going to have to get these shoes to Canton. I don’t know how that works.” Although Ogunbowale said he had kicked field goals in high school, he added that he was never “on the depth chart” as a kicker. He didn’t even play football until his junior year and spent most of his childhood playing soccer. The 29-year-old said that he’s been Houston’s emergency kicker since last season when he showed special teams coordinator Frank Ross his special skill. “Last year we went through the whole emergency kicker thing, and I told him I could do it,” he said. “I did it in practice. I was always just kind of the unwritten emergency kicker, but nothing ever came up that I needed to be out there kicking.” He added that he could have hit an even longer field goal than the one he made Sunday. “We had a kicking competition in college, and I kicked a 45-yarder,” he said. “I’ve got some power in the leg if I need to.” Though most of the attention was on his field goal, Ogunbowale said he was much more nervous on the kickoffs.

You just stand back there waiting for the ref to blow the whistle, so you do a lot more thinking. But the field goal, I was pretty poised.” Despite his success on Sunday, Ogunbowale has no designs on trying to steal Fairbairn’s position. “His job is safe,” he said with a laugh. “I want no part of that. He’s all good.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-06 00:33:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"07b64d61b9391fb4feec9253b04d0e60","title":"Kenny Moore’s two pick-6s help Colts snap 3-game skid with 27-13 victory over Panthers","link":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/football/nfl/2023/11/05/kenny-moores-two-pick-6s-help-colts-snap-3-game-skid-with-27-13-victory-over-panthers","keywords":["NFL"],"creator":["Steve Reed, The Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP) — Kenny Moore returned two Bryce Young interceptions for touchdowns, Jonathan Taylor caught a touchdown pass from Gardner Minshew and the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Carolina Panthers 27-13 on Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak. Indianapolis’ much-maligned defense had allowed at least 37 points in each of its past three games and had allowed more points than any team in the league, but had no problem slowing down the No. 1 overall pick and a mostly listless Panthers offense. Moore became the first Colts player in history with two pick-6s in a game and the first NFL player to accomplish the feat since Tampa Bay’s Mike Edwards did it against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2 of the 2021 season. Young finished 24 of 39 for 173 yards with three interceptions to fall to 1-6 as an NFL starter. Minshew threw for 127 yards and Taylor ran for 47 yards for the Colts (4-5). Adam Thielen, in the midst of a career season, was limited to 29 yards on five receptions for the Panthers (1-7), who matched their worst start in franchise history. The Colts dominated the Panthers in the first half and took a 20-3 lead into the locker room after Moore stepped in front of Young’s pass in the flat and took it 49 yards for a score. Carolina appeared to have regained momentum after cutting the Colts lead to 10 in the third quarter before Young overshot Miles Sanders and Moore grabbed it and raced 66 yards to end zone to give the Colts a 27-10 lead early in the fourth quarter. Indianapolis sacked Young four times and limited the Panthers to 62 total yards in the first half to take control. Young has now been sacked 26 in his seven NFL starts. It was a mistake-filled first half for the Panthers. It started when recently signed Eku Leota lined up offside on a Colts punt on fourth-and-1 from deep in their end of the field. That mental error gifted the Colts with a first down and led to a 15-play drive that resulted in a 26-yard field goal by Matt Gay. The Colts made it 10-0 after Panthers safety Xavier Woods was called for hitting Michael Pittman, considered a defenseless receiver, on a crossing route setting up Taylor’s 10-yard TD reception. After Gay’s 57-yard field goal made it 13-3, Young threw a pass in the flat toward Chuba Hubbard that Moore easily made a break on and took to the end zone. The Panthers showed some life in the third quarter behind Miles Sanders, who has seen his playing time limited of late because of fumbles and ineffectiveness. Sanders made four big plays leading to Young’s 5-yard TD pass to DJ Chark, cutting the Colts lead to 20-10. But Moore’s second pick-6 all but sealed the win as Panthers coach Frank Reich failed to beat the Colts, who fired him last season. INJURIES Colts: CB Tony Brown (concussion), WR Josh Downs (knee) and TE Drew Ogletree (foot) all left the game with injuries and did not return. Panthers: OLB Brian Burns (concussion), CB C.J.

Then, suddenly, they couldn’t cross the 50-yard-line. Bagent, who threw two of his three interceptions and lost a fumble on a sack in a nine-minute span of the fourth quarter, blamed himself for the Bears’ offensive implosion in a 24-17 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. Chicago, which lost the turnover battle 5-0, never got past its own 35-yard line in five series after tying it at 17 on Cairo Santos’ 31-yard field goal with 3:27 left in the third quarter. “It all comes to me in that last quarter being able to do a better job of taking care of the ball,” Bagent said. Coach Matt Eberflus “talks about how important it is every single day,” Bagent added. “It was basically just me (making mistakes) there in that last quarter.” Making his third straight start in place of an injured Justin Fields, Bagent was 15 of 19 for 201 yards with two touchdowns through three quarters. He went 3 of 11 for 19 yards with the three turnovers from there. Two plays after the Saints went ahead 24-17, safety Marcus Maye made a diving interception of a pass Bagent said he threw late over the middle. After Chicago stopped Derek Carr on a fourth-down sneak at their 17, Bagent was picked off by cornerback Paulson Adebo. “It was good on their part and bad on my part,” Bagent said. “Tight coverage, and they made a couple of really good plays. Hats off to them, but I have to probably go somewhere else with the ball.” Chicago’s defense kept giving the offense more chances, but it could not take advantage. The Bears failed to pick up a first down after the Saints downed a punt at the 2, and they turned the ball over following a missed 47-yard field by Blake Grupe with 2:27 left that kept them in the game. The Saints then ran out the clock in a bizarre fourth quarter in which all 34 plays run by both teams started in Bears’ territory. “We came kind of to a screaming halt there,” said tight end Cole Kmet, who had touchdown catches on two of Chicago’s first three possessions. “I don’t know if it ever happened before where they are on our side of the 50 for the entire fourth quarter. I’ve never seen that in my life.” Kmet capped the Bears’ opening drive by outfighting safety Tyrann Mathieu in the end zone for an 18-yard grab. Bagent hit Kmet again for a 9-yard score in the second quarter for a 14-7 lead. Bagent scrambled eight times for 70 yards, running back D’Onta Foreman gained 82 yards on 18 carries through three quarters and the Bears had outgained the Saints 348-171 at one point. “It’s frustrating because there were some opportunities to really extend the lead,” Kmet said. “I really think Tyson played great, and I think the film will show that. We can do better as a skill group for Tyson in terms of being more friendly with the routes and making more plays for him.” The Bears lost by only one touchdown despite their five turnovers and getting penalized eight times for 71 yards to the Saints’ one flag for 5 yards. Those negative numbers prompted some positivity from Eberflus, who also lauded the addition of defensive end Montez Sweat. Sweat, acquired in a trade with Washington this week and signed to a long-term contract extension Saturday, had two tackles and broke up a pass in his first game. He has 35 1/2 sacks in 4 1/2 seasons.

Fields, who practiced on a limited basis Friday, might be activated Thursday when Chicago hosts Carolina. Bagent “had really good moments in the starts that he’s had, and he’s got to build off of that,” Eberflus said. “The most important thing Tyson can do now is learn and get better.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-06 00:14:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e1defbf2c3c7dde49ef42a6cb63266e6","title":"Pearlpia Ladies winless run continue in Dreamz Ladies draw - Northern Zone results","link":"https://www.ghanafa.org/pearlpia-ladies-winless-run-continue-in-dreamz-ladies-draw-northern-zone-results","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pearlpia.Ladies winless run continue as Dreamz Ladies snatched a point in Tamale on Friday. &amp;nbsp; The Tamale side failed to make good use of their home fans as they played out a 1-1 draw wi...","content":"Pearlpia.Ladies winless run continue as Dreamz Ladies snatched a point in Tamale on Friday.

Their tenacity and persistence didn't fail them as they were awarded a penalty which was calmly converted by Hannah Donkor inside 49 minutes. The visitors couldn't keep up the pressure from the host after scoring from the leveler. Berry Ladies doubled their lead through Elizabeth Adjoa Boateng in the 51st minute. Without leaving a glimpse of hope for the visitors, Janet Korkor Osei scored her first goal of the day and Berry Ladies third in the 77th minute. At Ajumako - Victoria Williams Teye's 5th minute strike made the difference as Police Ladies pip Soccer Intellectuals at Aduyaw Assasan Park. The visitors made early incursions into their opponents vital area and Victoria strucked from the edge of the box which beat goalkeeper Grace Andoh for the opener. Police continued their dominance by pinning the host in their own half but the defence of Intellectuals stood firm to avoid any embarrassment as the game ended 1-0 in favor of Police Ladies.

After seeing Heinicke come up short in a 31-28 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, he still has not locked himself into a long-time starter at quarterback. Smith liked some of what he saw of the veteran, who finished 21 for 38 for 268 yards with one touchdown and one interception, but he was not ready after the loss to declare him the full-time starter. “He did turn the ball over, but I thought he operated on third down pretty well,” Smith said. “We’ll huddle up and evaluate. I thought he gave us some chances.” Trailing 24-21 with 9:06 to play, Heinicke drove the Falcons 79 yards for a touchdown that gave Atlanta the lead back with 2:08 to play. The drive included a critical 13-yard scramble by Heinicke on third-and-9 that kept the drive alive. Heinicke finished with 20 rushing yards on three carries and was sacked once. Heinicke said he was pleased about his game, but wishes he had a few plays back, including a third-quarter interception that led to the Vikings taking the lead. “I don’t think that was a relationship-type of deal (with the receivers),” Heinicke said. “That was just a bad throw.” Ridder started the first eight games of the season for the Falcons, but was replaced at halftime last week in a 28-23 loss to the Titans. The Falcons scored 20 points in the second half against the Titans with Heinicke leading the offense. Smith would not commit to a quarterback beyond having Heinicke start against the Vikings, and Heinicke said he isn’t focused on who will start next week when the Falcons go to Arizona to face the Cardinals. “I’m not really thinking about that right now. I’m still (upset) about the loss,” Heinicke said. “We will come in tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday and see what happens, but just still thinking about the game right now.” Winnipeg Jets Game Days On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions.

And the late touchdown drive put the Falcons in position to get over the .500 mark. The Falcons had to settle for field goals on their first two trips to the red zone, including one drive that started at the Vikings 1-yard-line following Joshua Dobbs’ fumble. A penalty and a few failed run plays led to a 23-yard field goal. “You can’t sugarcoat it or make excuses,” Smith said. “We had our chances and didn’t get it done.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-05 23:49:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"21c45b0874b4b5d5d691b5f4b3a01b17","title":"Late interception dooms Patriots in 20-17 loss to Commanders.

(AP) — Mac Jones appeared to have put his earlier struggles behind when he moved the Patriots into Washington territory with under 2 minutes to play. A game-tying field goal was in sight and the go-ahead touchdown remained a possibility, too. On second-and-8 from the Commanders 41, Jones dropped back in the pocket and threw down the middle to JuJu Smith-Schuster. The ball bounced off the receiver’s hands and into the arms of Jartavius Martin, sealing Washington’s 20-17 victory. “I feel like I’ve been saying it every week,” Patriots tight end Hunter Henry said. “We’ve had too many of those this year, and another one today.” The Patriots fell to 2-7 for the first time since Bill Belichick’s first season as their head coach and lost to the Commanders (4-5) at home for the first time since 1996. Belichick remains 17 victories short of breaking Don Shula’s all-time wins record, and now there is reason to doubt he will last long enough in New England to do it. Sunday’s loss came at the hands of a team that had already given up on this season, trading away its two top pass rushers last week. The rest of the season is a referendum on quarterback Sam Howell, a fifth-round pick in 2022; coach Ron Rivera is not expected to return. Asked if this loss stung more because the other team was “tanking,” Patriots center David Andrews said, “It stings because it’s a loss.” “It’s not going to break my spirit,” he said. “It’s not going to break our spirit.” Such turmoil may be expected in Washington, a franchise that has gone through eight coaches and three nicknames since it last won a game in New England. But Belichick’s lack of success since Tom Brady left in 2020 has Patriots fans wondering if he will last the season. And after Jones showed promise in his rookie year, the next two have not shown the progress that would give the team faith he is the answer. “I think the biggest thing … is remaining confident in yourself,” Jones said. “When you do everything you can every day, you should have no regrets. I have no regrets. I do need to do things better, but I’m always going to work hard and put in the hours. That’s all I can do, right? ” Belichick didn’t even try to answer questions about the team’s struggles after the game, mumbling the same platitudes about how “all three units” need improvement. Every decision he made was because he thought it gave them the best chance to win. “We had our chances. You know, had a chance there at the end,” he said. “Couldn’t make enough plays.” Defensive lineman Deatrich Wise Jr. conceded that the routine is getting repetitive. “We continue to say the same things,” he said. “Our spirits aren’t broken just because we have a loss.” Jones completed 24 of 44 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown, a well-thrown 14-yarder to Henry that gave the Patriots a 14-10 lead in the second quarter. Rhamondre Stevenson broke free for a 64-yard touchdown run that was the longest Patriots play from scrimmage this season.

Arrives a few hours prior to puck drop. But New England also hurt itself with mental mistakes, most notably defensive lineman Mack Wilson lining up offside on a punt by Washington. The penalty gave the Commanders the ball back; although they didn’t advance, they forced New England to burn off its last two timeouts before getting the ball back with 2:07 to play. Jones seemed to be moving the Patriots into position for at least a tying score, advancing to the Washington 43-yard line. Instead, the interception sealed the loss. “It’s all on me,” Smith-Schuster said. “He put the ball in a good position. I’ve just got to make the catch, secure it. Now, we’re in field goal range. Obviously, I didn’t do that. Fell short.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL Advertisement Advertisement","pubDate":"2023-11-05 23:31:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"winnipegfreepress","source_priority":101538,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
