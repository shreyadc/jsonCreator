Spurs moved five points clear at the summit after they recovered from a sluggish first half at Selhurst Park to score twice in 13 second-half minutes. An own-goal from Joel Ward broke the deadlock in the 53rd minute when he deflected James Maddison’s cross beyond Palace goalkeeper Sam Johnstone and it was 2-0 soon after when Tottenham captain Son Heung-min steered home after Brennan Johnson’s assist. Team spirit 🤍 — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) Jordan Ayew reduced the deficit for Palace in the fourth minute of stoppage-time, but Spurs held on to extend their unbeaten top-flight run to 10 matches and move five clear of Manchester City and Arsenal, who play Manchester United and Sheffield United respectively across the weekend. “Let them dream. That’s what being a football supporter is all about. It’s fair to say this lot have suffered a fair bit, so I’m certainly not going to dampen that,” Postecoglou said. “Top of the table is great and the results are great but it’s more in the manner we’re doing it. Pretty much from the first game we’ve had all sorts of different challenges we’ve had to overcome. “Every time there has been a real focus and clear-headedness about the group collectively to deal with that. “That has been a really pleasing thing and because they’re getting rewards from that, then that gives us the opportunity to accelerate the growth of giving them more tools out there to help them for whatever we need to overcome. “I thought tonight was going to be a real difficult game for us. Coming here, Palace’s result last week, it’s a tight ground, they’d only conceded three goals in the four games so far and how were the lads going to cope with the fact we weren’t going to create as many chances as we had been? “I really liked the way we worked through that as a group.” After returning to the Premier League summit with a 2-0 win over Fulham on Monday, Spurs struggled in the first half at Selhurst Park and were indebted to fine early saves from Guglielmo Vicario to deny Ayew and Odsonne Edouard. 🎯 x 📸 — Premier League (@premierleague) Postecoglou, who had lambasted his side for their second-half showing earlier in the week, introduced Emerson Royal for Ben Davies at the break and watched Ward put into his own net from Maddison’s cross to open the scoring. It was 2-0 when Son fired home for his eighth goal of the campaign following Johnson’s smart pass, his first assist since a £45million deadline-day transfer from Nottingham Forest. While Ayew managed to reduce the deficit – in the fourth minute of stoppage time after a lengthy VAR check – Tottenham stood firm to claim a fourth-straight win and show another side with a dogged defensively display, despite enjoying more than 70 per cent possession. Postecoglou added: “I have always felt that matchdays are about the players. What we try to do on a daily basis is give them the tools to find the solutions. “We prep them for their exam at the weekend, but we don’t know what the questions are going to be. They’ve got to work them out themselves. “In an exam you are not asking anybody for help. You have to work it out yourself and hopefully what we’ve given them is the tools.” Palace boss Roy Hodgson was disappointed to suffer a second-consecutive defeat and admitted his substitutes weakened his team. “I thought it was an aggressive and quite-controlled first half from our side, but of course the first goal then produces a second,” he said. “That is when we start putting players on the field, players who have not really played with the first team, Jes (Rak-Sakyi), (Naouirou) Ahamada, (Matheus) Franca and we lost the intensity we were able to do in the first half. “In the end it became easy for them (Tottenham) to see the game through.”","pubDate":"2023-10-27 22:53:03","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17380229/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"038a69021a9affd774602030113e6171","title":"Ange Postecoglou pleased Premier League leaders Tottenham pass latest exam","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23885522.ange-postecoglou-pleased-premier-league-leaders-tottenham-pass-latest-exam/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Joel Ward’s own-goal and Son Heung-min’s eighth goal of the campaign sent Spurs five points clear.","content":"Ange Postecoglou was pleased Premier League leaders Tottenham passed their latest exam with a hard-fought 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and was in no mood to stop fans dreaming of a title challenge.

Only time will tell - but the Gypsy King is so laidback, he's horizontal on the eye of the 'Battle of the Baddest' Fury and Ngannou will face off in the crossover clash in Riyadh on Saturday WEIGH-IN RECAP: Fury nine pounds heavier for his fight with Ngannou LISTEN: Exclusive Tyson Fury interview on THE HOOK - our new boxing podcast By Jeff Powell for the Daily Mail Published: 23:39, 27 October 2023 | Updated: 00:05, 28 October 2023 e-mail View comments Tyson Fury called his entire football squad of an entourage into the ring to pose with him for photos full of laughter and rejoicing. The Gypsy King directed them all into their positions like a conductor composing his orchestra and then lay down on the canvas in front of them, head propped up by one hand as if lounging on a sofa while watching a televised repeat of his latest triumph. A battery of media cameramen joined in the jollity, promising to send them all copies of their snaps. The only disconcerting note was that the fight had yet to take place. The one against UFC legend Francis Ngannou here on Saturday night. Now, Fury is a shorter favourite to win this than Donald Trump to win the US presidential election even if he has to set up office in jail rather than the White House . Still, fighters are notoriously superstitious. They may boast about how great they are and issue dire warnings about the punishment they intend to inflict on opponents but never do they actually celebrate victory before the fight. That would be too dangerous a temptation of fate. Yet here was Fury dancing with that devil at the end of his last workout before the event. Yes, he is the most unpredictable of characters, the most irrepressible flouter of convention, the most entertaining rebel without a pause. Yes, the circus is coming to town. But doesn’t it bring with it the outside chance of the unexpected which always accompanies fighters into the ring? Most of all the heavyweights, between whom one punch can famously turn a pre-eminent champion upside down. Tyson Fury may be the heavy favourite for Saturday night's clash, but fighters are superstitious The Gypsy King is preparing to go toe-to-toe with MMA champion Francis Ngannou Spotify Privacy Policy Fury, the undefeated and by his own estimation never to be defeated world heavyweight champion, scoffs at the question. He rolls his eyes in mock agreement — ‘oooh, you never know’ — but then says: ‘There is no one who can beat the Gypsy King. I’m the biggest but also the fastest. The fattest but also the strongest. As big a puncher as any of these dossers but the only one who can get up from a real knock-down. The way I did all those times against Deontay Wilder — once when I was still unconscious and everything was in slow motion and the referee looked like an alien as he asked me if I could carry on. ‘It takes will-power out of this world to keep getting up. Some of the others can do it once but get knocked out by the next big hit that follows. To rise again and again takes an absolute refusal to lose. A gritting of the teeth and the mind which I have. By comparison with me all the others are ordinary.’ That includes not only Ngannou but also Oleksandr Usyk who he is scheduled to meet in less than two months in the first fight for the undisputed world heavyweight championship in more than a decade. ‘Small and not so special,’ says Fury of the Ukrainian hero. ‘Can’t hurt me but I sure can hurt him.’ The contract for that fight is signed and sealed but can only be delivered back here on December 23 if Fury comes through unbeaten and unscathed here and now. Those who scoff about the WBC world champion making hay against a cage-man in is his first boxing match protest that this cross-over bout is all about money and nothing to do with real sport. Do they have a point? The £50million Fury is projected to pocket in the Boulevard Hall, an arena so new that the paint is still drying on the walls and the rubble still being cleared from the floors, is very welcome, thank you. There are astoundingly richer pickings to come. Upwards of $100m for his Christmas present and double that in the spring for a Usyk rematch. Apparently the Saudis are ready to cough up again — and again. Fury says: ‘I think the rest of my fights will be here. I’ve paid my dues back home with those recent fights in Britain and these good people look after me very nicely. And they are turning this Saturday night into a huge and spectacular event.’ A curiosity, an artifice, a stain on the Noble Art. Call this what you will but Ngannou has nothing to lose as he picks up the first eight-figure purse in his life and insists he can pull off one of the greatest upsets in sporting history. He is reputed to be the biggest puncher in UFC history and has been given a few tips by Mike Tyson, although there were no indications during his workout on the pads that he has acquired the boxing know-how required to land a moon-shot on Fury, whose ring-craftsmanship is as towering as his 6ft 9in physique. Ngannou has little to lose in the contest as he picks up his first eight-figure purse in his life The pair will be contesting the first-ever Riyadh Season belt during their big money clash Fury is nonplussed about any delay to his banner match-up with Oleksandr Usyk in December There is many a slip between cut and lip in heavyweight boxing but Fury says it won’t matter to him if an injury forces a Usyk postponement because the schedule will simply shift from Christmas into the new year. Neverthless, there are many millions of reasons for Fury to refrain from carrying Ngannou too long for the sake of appearances in what everyone involved here denies will be just an exhibition match. Since it is only scheduled for 10 rounds, expect Fury to call time after a couple in which to size up the most effective way of so doing and then two or three more enjoying himself. As he says: ‘Retirement? I might have another 10 fights because this is what I love doing and it’s what I’m good at.’ Exceptionally good, as the amiable Ngannou should be about to discover. Equally as interesting, since there are as yet few sightings of British boxing fans in the capital of Saudi Arabia, will be how many locals turn up and whether this does big business on pay-per-view television. On this one element, that of being the greatest salesman in the whole world of sport, the Gypsy King’s reputation does depend.

Hill currently leads the NFL with 902 receiving yards this season, which means if he has 98 yards against the Patriots on Sunday, he’ll have 1,000 for the season. In Week Eight. It’s been a long time since anyone has done that. The last player to hit the 1,000-yard mark in receiving by his team’s eighth game of the season was Charlie Hennigan of the 1961 Houston Oilers in the American Football League. The only other players to reach 1,000 yards by Week Eight were Elroy “Crazy Legs” Hirsch in 1951 and Don Hutson in 1942. Hill also has four different games this season with at least 150 receiving yards and a touchdown — something no one has ever done five times in a season. Before the season, Hill made noise about reaching an unprecedented 2,000 receiving yards in 2023. He has a great chance to be more than halfway there, less than halfway through the season.","pubDate":"2023-10-27 22:25:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b6a4f4c01d56b4e90386a14f02d42937","title":"Papers: Neto tells Wolves he won't push for transfer in January","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12994436/pedro-neto-tells-wolves-he-will-not-push-for-transfer-away-in-january-window-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...

The league confirmed on Thursday that the fixture, which has been pushed back 24 hours to accommodate TV coverage, will be the first played on December 24 since Manchester United played Leeds in 1995, a move that has drawn a backlash from fans. Scheduled for a 1pm kick-off, it could leave supporters struggling to make travel arrangements with train timetables typically amended or curtailed the day before Christmas, while there are also concerns it will impact time supporters traditionally spend with family. A team news update ahead of tomorrow lunchtime. ⤵️ — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) Pochettino is set to be doubly affected by the move, as not only is it Argentinian custom to begin Christmas celebrations late on December 24, the previous day also marks his and his wife’s 31st wedding anniversary – which he will now spend travelling to Wolverhampton. Despite not being consulted by the league he conceded that the club has little choice but to go along, but backed objections by supporters who have spoken out. “It’s a little bit strange but we need to accept the rules of the Premier League, that we need to go there and to play,” said Pochettino. “(In Argentina) we celebrate on the night of the 24th. At 12 o’clock on the night we start to celebrate Christmas. More than the 25th because you’re asleep nearly all day. Here it’s different because you celebrate on the 25th with the family. “I need to see things in a different way. For sure our fans are not happy but we need to accept this new era in football. “(The Premier League) didn’t ask us. They wanted some meeting with me and all the coaches one week before the season. I said I’m more than happy to share time with you, but it’s better if you prepare the meeting before the end of the season to prepare the next season. “If they ask me I will give my opinion, but at the moment we are not involved in the decisions.” He added: “I don’t know what to do (with my wife). I need to find some ideas to compensate. (Search online for) ‘unhappy wife’.” The Wolves game is the first of three in seven days for Chelsea over the Christmas period, with Crystal Palace due at Stamford Bridge on the evening of December 27 before visiting Luton on December 30. The Palace game has been moved from Boxing Day in order to accommodate the controversial Christmas Eve fixture. Pochettino reiterated that supporters’ concerns must be paramount in scheduling decisions. “We play and we work and all that we are doing is for our fans,” he said. “Without fans, football (is nothing). We need to protect, and to care, and to look after our fans. “Of course I agree with them, that I am not happy if they are not happy. It’s common sense. I can understand. “I don’t know what is behind it. I don’t know why. No one explained. I cannot tell. I hope it’s one time and never again, but we’ll see what happens. “People love football in England and they are going to be there. Our fans are going to be there supporting the team. But I don’t know if it’s going to be a regular situation.” Asked whether the club would offer a new contract to Conor Gallagher – who has captained the side in the absence of injured pair Reece James and Ben Chilwell – Pochettino likened the situation to the balancing act he now faces on the home front. “It’s like how we were talking about my wife,” he said. “It’s about to match and to feel good being together. It’s like a marriage with the club. They both need to feel good, then you can drive at a good deal. “He is a player that is doing fantastic. He’s an amazing player and we’re so happy with the way he is doing things.”","pubDate":"2023-10-27 21:31:59","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17380204/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1bff36e77afbf1aa1b95ec189e157d9f","title":"Wolves v Chelsea on Christmas Eve means ‘unhappy wife’ for Mauricio Pochettino","link":"https://www.northwalespioneer.co.uk/sport/national/23885508.wolves-v-chelsea-christmas-eve-means-unhappy-wife-mauricio-pochettino/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The fixture will be the first played on December 24 since Manchester United played Leeds in 1995.","content":"Mauricio Pochettino empathises with supporters angry about the Premier League’s decision to move Chelsea’s trip to Wolves to Christmas Eve, admitting it has thrown his festive plans and anniversary celebrations with his wife into chaos.

The league confirmed on Thursday that the fixture, which has been pushed back 24 hours to accommodate TV coverage, will be the first played on December 24 since Manchester United played Leeds in 1995, a move that has drawn a backlash from fans. Scheduled for a 1pm kick-off, it could leave supporters struggling to make travel arrangements with train timetables typically amended or curtailed the day before Christmas, while there are also concerns it will impact time supporters traditionally spend with family. A team news update ahead of tomorrow lunchtime. ⤵️ — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) Pochettino is set to be doubly affected by the move, as not only is it Argentinian custom to begin Christmas celebrations late on December 24, the previous day also marks his and his wife’s 31st wedding anniversary – which he will now spend travelling to Wolverhampton. Despite not being consulted by the league he conceded that the club has little choice but to go along, but backed objections by supporters who have spoken out. “It’s a little bit strange but we need to accept the rules of the Premier League, that we need to go there and to play,” said Pochettino. “(In Argentina) we celebrate on the night of the 24th.

Spurs moved five points clear at the summit after they recovered from a sluggish first half at Selhurst Park to score twice in 13 second-half minutes. An own-goal from Joel Ward broke the deadlock in the 53rd minute when he deflected James Maddison’s cross beyond Palace goalkeeper Sam Johnstone and it was 2-0 soon after when Tottenham captain Son Heung-min steered home after Brennan Johnson’s assist.

While Ayew managed to reduce the deficit – in the fourth minute of stoppage time after a lengthy VAR check – Tottenham stood firm to claim a fourth-straight win and show another side with a dogged defensively display, despite enjoying more than 70 per cent possession. Postecoglou added: “I have always felt that matchdays are about the players.

The Gypsy King directed them all into their positions like a conductor composing his orchestra and then lay down on the canvas in front of them, head propped up by one hand as if lounging on a sofa while watching a televised repeat of his latest triumph. A battery of media cameramen joined in the jollity, promising to send them all copies of their snaps. The only disconcerting note was that the fight had yet to take place. The one against UFC legend Francis Ngannou here on Saturday night. Now, Fury is a shorter favourite to win this than Donald Trump to win the US presidential election even if he has to set up office in jail rather than the White House . Still, fighters are notoriously superstitious. They may boast about how great they are and issue dire warnings about the punishment they intend to inflict on opponents but never do they actually celebrate victory before the fight. That would be too dangerous a temptation of fate. Yet here was Fury dancing with that devil at the end of his last workout before the event. Yes, he is the most unpredictable of characters, the most irrepressible flouter of convention, the most entertaining rebel without a pause. Yes, the circus is coming to town. But doesn’t it bring with it the outside chance of the unexpected which always accompanies fighters into the ring? Most of all the heavyweights, between whom one punch can famously turn a pre-eminent champion upside down. Tyson Fury may be the heavy favourite for Saturday night's clash, but fighters are superstitious The Gypsy King is preparing to go toe-to-toe with MMA champion Francis Ngannou Spotify Privacy Policy Fury, the undefeated and by his own estimation never to be defeated world heavyweight champion, scoffs at the question. He rolls his eyes in mock agreement — ‘oooh, you never know’ — but then says: ‘There is no one who can beat the Gypsy King. I’m the biggest but also the fastest. The fattest but also the strongest. As big a puncher as any of these dossers but the only one who can get up from a real knock-down. The way I did all those times against Deontay Wilder — once when I was still unconscious and everything was in slow motion and the referee looked like an alien as he asked me if I could carry on. ‘It takes will-power out of this world to keep getting up. Some of the others can do it once but get knocked out by the next big hit that follows. To rise again and again takes an absolute refusal to lose. A gritting of the teeth and the mind which I have. By comparison with me all the others are ordinary.’ That includes not only Ngannou but also Oleksandr Usyk who he is scheduled to meet in less than two months in the first fight for the undisputed world heavyweight championship in more than a decade. ‘Small and not so special,’ says Fury of the Ukrainian hero. ‘Can’t hurt me but I sure can hurt him.’ The contract for that fight is signed and sealed but can only be delivered back here on December 23 if Fury comes through unbeaten and unscathed here and now. Those who scoff about the WBC world champion making hay against a cage-man in is his first boxing match protest that this cross-over bout is all about money and nothing to do with real sport. Do they have a point? The £50million Fury is projected to pocket in the Boulevard Hall, an arena so new that the paint is still drying on the walls and the rubble still being cleared from the floors, is very welcome, thank you. There are astoundingly richer pickings to come. Upwards of $100m for his Christmas present and double that in the spring for a Usyk rematch. Apparently the Saudis are ready to cough up again — and again. Fury says: ‘I think the rest of my fights will be here. I’ve paid my dues back home with those recent fights in Britain and these good people look after me very nicely. And they are turning this Saturday night into a huge and spectacular event.’ A curiosity, an artifice, a stain on the Noble Art. Call this what you will but Ngannou has nothing to lose as he picks up the first eight-figure purse in his life and insists he can pull off one of the greatest upsets in sporting history. He is reputed to be the biggest puncher in UFC history and has been given a few tips by Mike Tyson, although there were no indications during his workout on the pads that he has acquired the boxing know-how required to land a moon-shot on Fury, whose ring-craftsmanship is as towering as his 6ft 9in physique. Ngannou has little to lose in the contest as he picks up his first eight-figure purse in his life The pair will be contesting the first-ever Riyadh Season belt during their big money clash Fury is nonplussed about any delay to his banner match-up with Oleksandr Usyk in December There is many a slip between cut and lip in heavyweight boxing but Fury says it won’t matter to him if an injury forces a Usyk postponement because the schedule will simply shift from Christmas into the new year. Neverthless, there are many millions of reasons for Fury to refrain from carrying Ngannou too long for the sake of appearances in what everyone involved here denies will be just an exhibition match. Since it is only scheduled for 10 rounds, expect Fury to call time after a couple in which to size up the most effective way of so doing and then two or three more enjoying himself. As he says: ‘Retirement? I might have another 10 fights because this is what I love doing and it’s what I’m good at.’ Exceptionally good, as the amiable Ngannou should be about to discover. Equally as interesting, since there are as yet few sightings of British boxing fans in the capital of Saudi Arabia, will be how many locals turn up and whether this does big business on pay-per-view television. On this one element, that of being the greatest salesman in the whole world of sport, the Gypsy King’s reputation does depend.

Hill currently leads the NFL with 902 receiving yards this season, which means if he has 98 yards against the Patriots on Sunday, he’ll have 1,000 for the season. In Week Eight. It’s been a long time since anyone has done that. The last player to hit the 1,000-yard mark in receiving by his team’s eighth game of the season was Charlie Hennigan of the 1961 Houston Oilers in the American Football League. The only other players to reach 1,000 yards by Week Eight were Elroy “Crazy Legs” Hirsch in 1951 and Don Hutson in 1942. Hill also has four different games this season with at least 150 receiving yards and a touchdown — something no one has ever done five times in a season. Before the season, Hill made noise about reaching an unprecedented 2,000 receiving yards in 2023. He has a great chance to be more than halfway there, less than halfway through the season.","pubDate":"2023-10-27 22:25:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b6a4f4c01d56b4e90386a14f02d42937","title":"Papers: Neto tells Wolves he won't push for transfer in January","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12994436/pedro-neto-tells-wolves-he-will-not-push-for-transfer-away-in-january-window-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...

The league confirmed on Thursday that the fixture, which has been pushed back 24 hours to accommodate TV coverage, will be the first played on December 24 since Manchester United played Leeds in 1995, a move that has drawn a backlash from fans. Scheduled for a 1pm kick-off, it could leave supporters struggling to make travel arrangements with train timetables typically amended or curtailed the day before Christmas, while there are also concerns it will impact time supporters traditionally spend with family. A team news update ahead of tomorrow lunchtime. ⤵️ — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) Pochettino is set to be doubly affected by the move, as not only is it Argentinian custom to begin Christmas celebrations late on December 24, the previous day also marks his and his wife’s 31st wedding anniversary – which he will now spend travelling to Wolverhampton. Despite not being consulted by the league he conceded that the club has little choice but to go along, but backed objections by supporters who have spoken out. “It’s a little bit strange but we need to accept the rules of the Premier League, that we need to go there and to play,” said Pochettino. “(In Argentina) we celebrate on the night of the 24th. At 12 o’clock on the night we start to celebrate Christmas. More than the 25th because you’re asleep nearly all day. Here it’s different because you celebrate on the 25th with the family. “I need to see things in a different way. For sure our fans are not happy but we need to accept this new era in football. “(The Premier League) didn’t ask us. They wanted some meeting with me and all the coaches one week before the season. I said I’m more than happy to share time with you, but it’s better if you prepare the meeting before the end of the season to prepare the next season. “If they ask me I will give my opinion, but at the moment we are not involved in the decisions.” He added: “I don’t know what to do (with my wife). I need to find some ideas to compensate. (Search online for) ‘unhappy wife’.” The Wolves game is the first of three in seven days for Chelsea over the Christmas period, with Crystal Palace due at Stamford Bridge on the evening of December 27 before visiting Luton on December 30. The Palace game has been moved from Boxing Day in order to accommodate the controversial Christmas Eve fixture. Pochettino reiterated that supporters’ concerns must be paramount in scheduling decisions. “We play and we work and all that we are doing is for our fans,” he said. “Without fans, football (is nothing). We need to protect, and to care, and to look after our fans. “Of course I agree with them, that I am not happy if they are not happy. It’s common sense. I can understand. “I don’t know what is behind it. I don’t know why. No one explained. I cannot tell. I hope it’s one time and never again, but we’ll see what happens. “People love football in England and they are going to be there. Our fans are going to be there supporting the team. But I don’t know if it’s going to be a regular situation.” Asked whether the club would offer a new contract to Conor Gallagher – who has captained the side in the absence of injured pair Reece James and Ben Chilwell – Pochettino likened the situation to the balancing act he now faces on the home front. “It’s like how we were talking about my wife,” he said. “It’s about to match and to feel good being together.

Spurs moved five points clear at the summit after they recovered from a sluggish first half at Selhurst Park to score twice in 13 second-half minutes. An own-goal from Joel Ward broke the deadlock in the 53rd minute when he deflected James Maddison’s cross beyond Palace goalkeeper Sam Johnstone and it was 2-0 soon after when Tottenham captain Son Heung-min steered home after Brennan Johnson’s assist. Team spirit 🤍 — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) Jordan Ayew reduced the deficit for Palace in the fourth minute of stoppage-time, but Spurs held on to extend their unbeaten top-flight run to 10 matches and move five clear of Manchester City and Arsenal, who play Manchester United and Sheffield United respectively across the weekend. “Let them dream. That’s what being a football supporter is all about. It’s fair to say this lot have suffered a fair bit, so I’m certainly not going to dampen that,” Postecoglou said. “Top of the table is great and the results are great but it’s more in the manner we’re doing it. Pretty much from the first game we’ve had all sorts of different challenges we’ve had to overcome. “Every time there has been a real focus and clear-headedness about the group collectively to deal with that. “That has been a really pleasing thing and because they’re getting rewards from that, then that gives us the opportunity to accelerate the growth of giving them more tools out there to help them for whatever we need to overcome. “I thought tonight was going to be a real difficult game for us.

It was 2-0 when Son fired home for his eighth goal of the campaign following Johnson’s smart pass, his first assist since a £45million deadline-day transfer from Nottingham Forest. While Ayew managed to reduce the deficit – in the fourth minute of stoppage time after a lengthy VAR check – Tottenham stood firm to claim a fourth-straight win and show another side with a dogged defensively display, despite enjoying more than 70 per cent possession. Postecoglou added: “I have always felt that matchdays are about the players. What we try to do on a daily basis is give them the tools to find the solutions. “We prep them for their exam at the weekend, but we don’t know what the questions are going to be. They’ve got to work them out themselves. “In an exam you are not asking anybody for help. You have to work it out yourself and hopefully what we’ve given them is the tools.” Palace boss Roy Hodgson was disappointed to suffer a second-consecutive defeat and admitted his substitutes weakened his team. “I thought it was an aggressive and quite-controlled first half from our side, but of course the first goal then produces a second,” he said. “That is when we start putting players on the field, players who have not really played with the first team, Jes (Rak-Sakyi), (Naouirou) Ahamada, (Matheus) Franca and we lost the intensity we were able to do in the first half. “In the end it became easy for them (Tottenham) to see the game through.”","pubDate":"2023-10-27 22:53:03","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17380229/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"038a69021a9affd774602030113e6171","title":"Ange Postecoglou pleased Premier League leaders Tottenham pass latest exam","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23885522.ange-postecoglou-pleased-premier-league-leaders-tottenham-pass-latest-exam/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Joel Ward’s own-goal and Son Heung-min’s eighth goal of the campaign sent Spurs five points clear.","content":"Ange Postecoglou was pleased Premier League leaders Tottenham passed their latest exam with a hard-fought 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and was in no mood to stop fans dreaming of a title challenge.

Only time will tell - but the Gypsy King is so laidback, he's horizontal on the eye of the 'Battle of the Baddest' Fury and Ngannou will face off in the crossover clash in Riyadh on Saturday WEIGH-IN RECAP: Fury nine pounds heavier for his fight with Ngannou LISTEN: Exclusive Tyson Fury interview on THE HOOK - our new boxing podcast By Jeff Powell for the Daily Mail Published: 23:39, 27 October 2023 | Updated: 00:05, 28 October 2023 e-mail View comments Tyson Fury called his entire football squad of an entourage into the ring to pose with him for photos full of laughter and rejoicing. The Gypsy King directed them all into their positions like a conductor composing his orchestra and then lay down on the canvas in front of them, head propped up by one hand as if lounging on a sofa while watching a televised repeat of his latest triumph. A battery of media cameramen joined in the jollity, promising to send them all copies of their snaps. The only disconcerting note was that the fight had yet to take place. The one against UFC legend Francis Ngannou here on Saturday night. Now, Fury is a shorter favourite to win this than Donald Trump to win the US presidential election even if he has to set up office in jail rather than the White House . Still, fighters are notoriously superstitious. They may boast about how great they are and issue dire warnings about the punishment they intend to inflict on opponents but never do they actually celebrate victory before the fight. That would be too dangerous a temptation of fate. Yet here was Fury dancing with that devil at the end of his last workout before the event. Yes, he is the most unpredictable of characters, the most irrepressible flouter of convention, the most entertaining rebel without a pause. Yes, the circus is coming to town. But doesn’t it bring with it the outside chance of the unexpected which always accompanies fighters into the ring? Most of all the heavyweights, between whom one punch can famously turn a pre-eminent champion upside down. Tyson Fury may be the heavy favourite for Saturday night's clash, but fighters are superstitious The Gypsy King is preparing to go toe-to-toe with MMA champion Francis Ngannou Spotify Privacy Policy Fury, the undefeated and by his own estimation never to be defeated world heavyweight champion, scoffs at the question. He rolls his eyes in mock agreement — ‘oooh, you never know’ — but then says: ‘There is no one who can beat the Gypsy King. I’m the biggest but also the fastest. The fattest but also the strongest. As big a puncher as any of these dossers but the only one who can get up from a real knock-down. The way I did all those times against Deontay Wilder — once when I was still unconscious and everything was in slow motion and the referee looked like an alien as he asked me if I could carry on. ‘It takes will-power out of this world to keep getting up. Some of the others can do it once but get knocked out by the next big hit that follows. To rise again and again takes an absolute refusal to lose. A gritting of the teeth and the mind which I have. By comparison with me all the others are ordinary.’ That includes not only Ngannou but also Oleksandr Usyk who he is scheduled to meet in less than two months in the first fight for the undisputed world heavyweight championship in more than a decade. ‘Small and not so special,’ says Fury of the Ukrainian hero. ‘Can’t hurt me but I sure can hurt him.’ The contract for that fight is signed and sealed but can only be delivered back here on December 23 if Fury comes through unbeaten and unscathed here and now. Those who scoff about the WBC world champion making hay against a cage-man in is his first boxing match protest that this cross-over bout is all about money and nothing to do with real sport. Do they have a point? The £50million Fury is projected to pocket in the Boulevard Hall, an arena so new that the paint is still drying on the walls and the rubble still being cleared from the floors, is very welcome, thank you. There are astoundingly richer pickings to come. Upwards of $100m for his Christmas present and double that in the spring for a Usyk rematch. Apparently the Saudis are ready to cough up again — and again. Fury says: ‘I think the rest of my fights will be here. I’ve paid my dues back home with those recent fights in Britain and these good people look after me very nicely. And they are turning this Saturday night into a huge and spectacular event.’ A curiosity, an artifice, a stain on the Noble Art. Call this what you will but Ngannou has nothing to lose as he picks up the first eight-figure purse in his life and insists he can pull off one of the greatest upsets in sporting history. He is reputed to be the biggest puncher in UFC history and has been given a few tips by Mike Tyson, although there were no indications during his workout on the pads that he has acquired the boxing know-how required to land a moon-shot on Fury, whose ring-craftsmanship is as towering as his 6ft 9in physique. Ngannou has little to lose in the contest as he picks up his first eight-figure purse in his life The pair will be contesting the first-ever Riyadh Season belt during their big money clash Fury is nonplussed about any delay to his banner match-up with Oleksandr Usyk in December There is many a slip between cut and lip in heavyweight boxing but Fury says it won’t matter to him if an injury forces a Usyk postponement because the schedule will simply shift from Christmas into the new year. Neverthless, there are many millions of reasons for Fury to refrain from carrying Ngannou too long for the sake of appearances in what everyone involved here denies will be just an exhibition match. Since it is only scheduled for 10 rounds, expect Fury to call time after a couple in which to size up the most effective way of so doing and then two or three more enjoying himself. As he says: ‘Retirement? I might have another 10 fights because this is what I love doing and it’s what I’m good at.’ Exceptionally good, as the amiable Ngannou should be about to discover. Equally as interesting, since there are as yet few sightings of British boxing fans in the capital of Saudi Arabia, will be how many locals turn up and whether this does big business on pay-per-view television. On this one element, that of being the greatest salesman in the whole world of sport, the Gypsy King’s reputation does depend.

Hill currently leads the NFL with 902 receiving yards this season, which means if he has 98 yards against the Patriots on Sunday, he’ll have 1,000 for the season. In Week Eight. It’s been a long time since anyone has done that. The last player to hit the 1,000-yard mark in receiving by his team’s eighth game of the season was Charlie Hennigan of the 1961 Houston Oilers in the American Football League. The only other players to reach 1,000 yards by Week Eight were Elroy “Crazy Legs” Hirsch in 1951 and Don Hutson in 1942. Hill also has four different games this season with at least 150 receiving yards and a touchdown — something no one has ever done five times in a season. Before the season, Hill made noise about reaching an unprecedented 2,000 receiving yards in 2023. He has a great chance to be more than halfway there, less than halfway through the season.","pubDate":"2023-10-27 22:25:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"profootballtalk","source_priority":267,"country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b6a4f4c01d56b4e90386a14f02d42937","title":"Papers: Neto tells Wolves he won't push for transfer in January","link":"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/20876/12994436/pedro-neto-tells-wolves-he-will-not-push-for-transfer-away-in-january-window-paper-talk","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...","content":"All the top stories and transfer rumours from Saturday's newspapers...

Scheduled for a 1pm kick-off, it could leave supporters struggling to make travel arrangements with train timetables typically amended or curtailed the day before Christmas, while there are also concerns it will impact time supporters traditionally spend with family. A team news update ahead of tomorrow lunchtime. ⤵️ — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) Pochettino is set to be doubly affected by the move, as not only is it Argentinian custom to begin Christmas celebrations late on December 24, the previous day also marks his and his wife’s 31st wedding anniversary – which he will now spend travelling to Wolverhampton. Despite not being consulted by the league he conceded that the club has little choice but to go along, but backed objections by supporters who have spoken out. “It’s a little bit strange but we need to accept the rules of the Premier League, that we need to go there and to play,” said Pochettino. “(In Argentina) we celebrate on the night of the 24th. At 12 o’clock on the night we start to celebrate Christmas. More than the 25th because you’re asleep nearly all day. Here it’s different because you celebrate on the 25th with the family. “I need to see things in a different way. For sure our fans are not happy but we need to accept this new era in football. “(The Premier League) didn’t ask us. They wanted some meeting with me and all the coaches one week before the season. I said I’m more than happy to share time with you, but it’s better if you prepare the meeting before the end of the season to prepare the next season. “If they ask me I will give my opinion, but at the moment we are not involved in the decisions.” He added: “I don’t know what to do (with my wife). I need to find some ideas to compensate. (Search online for) ‘unhappy wife’.” The Wolves game is the first of three in seven days for Chelsea over the Christmas period, with Crystal Palace due at Stamford Bridge on the evening of December 27 before visiting Luton on December 30. The Palace game has been moved from Boxing Day in order to accommodate the controversial Christmas Eve fixture. Pochettino reiterated that supporters’ concerns must be paramount in scheduling decisions. “We play and we work and all that we are doing is for our fans,” he said. “Without fans, football (is nothing). We need to protect, and to care, and to look after our fans. “Of course I agree with them, that I am not happy if they are not happy. It’s common sense. I can understand. “I don’t know what is behind it. I don’t know why. No one explained. I cannot tell.

Pochettino is set to be doubly affected by the move, as not only is it Argentinian custom to begin Christmas celebrations late on December 24, the previous day also marks his and his wife’s 31st wedding anniversary – which he will now spend travelling to Wolverhampton. Despite not being consulted by the league he conceded that the club has little choice but to go along, but backed objections by supporters who have spoken out. “It’s a little bit strange but we need to accept the rules of the Premier League, that we need to go there and to play,” said Pochettino. “(In Argentina) we celebrate on the night of the 24th. At 12 o’clock on the night we start to celebrate Christmas. More than the 25th because you’re asleep nearly all day. Here it’s different because you celebrate on the 25th with the family. “I need to see things in a different way. For sure our fans are not happy but we need to accept this new era in football. “(The Premier League) didn’t ask us. They wanted some meeting with me and all the coaches one week before the season. I said I’m more than happy to share time with you, but it’s better if you prepare the meeting before the end of the season to prepare the next season. “If they ask me I will give my opinion, but at the moment we are not involved in the decisions.” He added: “I don’t know what to do (with my wife). I need to find some ideas to compensate. (Search online for) ‘unhappy wife’.” The Wolves game is the first of three in seven days for Chelsea over the Christmas period, with Crystal Palace due at Stamford Bridge on the evening of December 27 before visiting Luton on December 30. The Palace game has been moved from Boxing Day in order to accommodate the controversial Christmas Eve fixture. Pochettino reiterated that supporters’ concerns must be paramount in scheduling decisions. “We play and we work and all that we are doing is for our fans,” he said. “Without fans, football (is nothing). We need to protect, and to care, and to look after our fans. “Of course I agree with them, that I am not happy if they are not happy. It’s common sense. I can understand. “I don’t know what is behind it. I don’t know why. No one explained. I cannot tell. I hope it’s one time and never again, but we’ll see what happens. “People love football in England and they are going to be there. Our fans are going to be there supporting the team. But I don’t know if it’s going to be a regular situation.” Asked whether the club would offer a new contract to Conor Gallagher – who has captained the side in the absence of injured pair Reece James and Ben Chilwell – Pochettino likened the situation to the balancing act he now faces on the home front. “It’s like how we were talking about my wife,” he said. “It’s about to match and to feel good being together. It’s like a marriage with the club. They both need to feel good, then you can drive at a good deal. “He is a player that is doing fantastic. He’s an amazing player and we’re so happy with the way he is doing things.”","pubDate":"2023-10-27 21:31:59","image_url":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/resources/images/17380204/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"time_series","source_priority":668753,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
