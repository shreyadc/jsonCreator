The report was submitted to the Paris public prosecutor following testimony from Sonia Souid, an agent for several French internationals, during an audit of the French Football Federation (FFF). Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said she had been informed by the head of the auditing body that a report had been made in accordance with the criminal code. Le Graet, 81, was forced to step down last week until the completion of the audit. In a statement to AFP on Saturday, he said he was stunned by leaks to the media. “I have just read with astonishment an article in Le Monde reporting leaks in the provisional audit report being prepared,” he said in a statement. “At this stage I know neither the facts of which I am accused nor the people who are behind them. “More generally, I am surprised that information can be disclosed even though the interim report has not yet been sent to me and I have not been able to submit my observations.” During interviews with sports daily L’Equipe and broadcaster RMC, Souid accused Le Graet of unwanted sexual advances, claiming she felt “the only thing that interested him, and I apologise for speaking vulgarly, are my breasts and my ass”. In French law, “sexist outrage” refers to a statement or behaviour with a sexual or sexist connotation which undermines a person’s dignity or exposes him or her to a distressing situation. The offence can be punished with a fine of up to 750 euros. Le Graet, in charge of the FFF since 2011 and with a mandate due to run until 2024, had faced calls to resign after what he admitted were “clumsy remarks” about Zinedine Zidane’s potential interest in coaching the French national team. He had said “wouldn’t even have taken his call” when asked whether Zidane, a World Cup winner as a player and an all-time France great, had rung him to express an interest in taking over as coach from Didier Deschamps. Deschamps, who led France to World Cup glory in 2018 and oversaw their run to last month’s final which they lost on penalties to Argentina, last week signed a new contract to stay as France coach until 2026.

Comparing two of the game’s creative sparks William Hill: Bet £10 Get £40 – CLAIM HERE* Chelsea vs Crystal Palace preview The pressure on Graham Potter intensified in midweek with the Blues losing the first of two London derbies this week – only this time at closest rivals Fulham. It’s now just one win in ten for Potter’s side in the league, which is form that has left them down in tenth spot. They’re now ten points off a top four spot and interestingly just ten clear of the relegation spots. The home form has desperately let them down so far, with just 14 points from right games at Stamford Bridge. New signing Joao Felix was thrust straight into the action in midweek – just 30 hours after signing – and was sent off in the second half, adding to the already desperate list of absentees in the attacking areas. For Palace, they’ve not quite got going yet since the return to action following the World Cup. A win at Bournemouth the only win since the restart, with home defeats to Fulham, Spurs and Southampton – the latest in the FA Cup.

Chelsea have won the last ELEVEN meetings between the pair, with their last defeat to Palace back in October 2017. The Blues have their measure, with Palace scoring just twice in the past six encounters. Earlier this season, Odsonne Edouard gave the Eagles an early lead, before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s equaliser. Ex-loanee Conor Gallagher then netted a 90th minute winner at Selhurst Park…sickener. Betfair: Bet £10 Get £30 in free bets – CLAIM HERE* Team News Chelsea The Blues will be without superstar signing Joao Felix after his red card in midweek. And with Raheem Sterling, Christian Pulisic and Armando Broja already out, attacking reinforcements are limited. Denis Zakaria limped off on Thursday night and looks set to face a spell out. Edouard Mendy, Reece James, Ben Chilwell, Wesley Fofana, N’Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are all missing. Predicted Chelsea side Crystal Palace Sam Johnston, Nathan Ferguson and James McArthur all missed their FA Cup defeat to Southampton due to fitness issues. The trio could all be absent again. But Tyrick Mitchell returns from suspension and will likely return at left-back for the visitors.

SunSport tips Kai Havertz to score first @ 6/1 with Paddy Power – CLAIM HERE Yes, he hasn’t scored in the past four games. But much of that is down to who Kai Havertz is playing alongside, particularly with the chopping and changing due to injury. Chelsea have had the measure of Palace recently and that could continue here. With Chelsea desperately needing a result, we expect them to come out all guns blazing from kick off and could grab an early goal here. Jorginho 3+ fouls @ 9/2 with Sky Bet – CLAIM HERE He’s fallen out of favour slightly in the Blues midfield but Jorginho will likely come back in for this one. Denis Zakaria’s injury piled more pressure on the midfield and he’s the man who replaced the crocked man on Thursday. Palace could do what they did at Anfield earlier this season and play on the break. Jorginho’s sitting role means he could be the first point of contact, and with that comes the chance of missed tackles. Stopping the Palace front four’s counter is a daunting task for a fragile Blues side and Jorginho could find himself taking one (or three….) for the team. Crystal Palace players are fouled over 13 times per game on average Chelsea vs Crystal Palace – What the managers have said Graham Potter will inevitably face questions on his future. We’ll have the best of what he and Patrick Vieira have to say when we hear from them. BETTING SPECIAL – BEST FOOTBALL BETTING SITES IN THE UK *Betfair: Get £30 in FREE BETS when you stake £10.

William Hill: Bet £10 Get £40 – CLAIM HERE* Spurs vs Arsenal preview It remains one of the marquee fixtures in English football and this meeting between Spurs and Arsenal looks one of the biggest in recent years. The Gunners go into the weekend with a five-point lead at the top of the table after dropping two points at home to Newcastle last time out. That was the first dropped points at home and only the third time they’ve dropped points in total this season, after a defeat at Old Trafford and draw at Southampton earlier in the campaign. How Arsenal have fared so far this season They bounced back with a convincing win at Oxford United to progress in the FA Cup. Mikel Arteta’s men now make the short trip across North London to face a Spurs side in an indifferent spell of form. They returned from the break with a draw at Brentford and defeat at home to Aston Villa before a thumping 4-0 win at Crystal Palace. It was a strong team put out against League One Portsmouth in the FA Cup, where they secured their passage to the fourth round with a slender 1-0 win.

Incredibly, the home side has won each of the last seven North London derbies. Arsenal won the encounter earlier this season with a 3-1 win – the exact same scoreline when they won this fixture last season at home too. Spurs scored three of their own when they last hosted the Gunners, winning 3-0 in May last year thanks to a Harry Kane double and Son Heung-min goal. Betfair: Bet £10 Get £30 in free bets – CLAIM HERE* Team News Spurs Antonio Conte looks set to be handed a triple injury boost ahead of Sunday. Yves Bissouma, Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski are all in line to return to the Premier League matchday squad in time for this one. Bissouma injured himself in the warm-up ahead of the Portsmouth game last week, while Kulusevski and Bentancur have been absent since the return of the domestic games following the World Cup. Predicted Spurs team Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as CASH if it loses – CLAIM HERE* Arsenal Mikel Arteta has no fresh injury concerns despite Bukayo Saka’s suspected knock earlier this week. The Englishman appeared to have an issue with his knee when going off with 15 minutes to go at Oxford. Arteta has since revealed the winger is “fine” and that the rest of his squad are OK. The Spaniard continued to bemoan the lack of options at centre forward in Gabriel Jesus’ absence, with Eddie Nketiah doing a good job while deputising.

SunSport tips Spurs 2 Arsenal 2 @ 11/1 with Betfair – CLAIM HERE Despite that incredible run for home sides, this fixture comes at these teams in a different way to previous meetings. Arsenal appear set to take the game to Spurs given the way both sides set up. Both sides have goals in them, with Arsenal second and Spurs third in the ‘goals for’ stats. And as much as neither will admit it, both sides would likely be relatively content taking a point at this stage. Harry Kane 1st goalscorer @ 5/1 with Paddy Power – CLAIM HERE He’s the main man for Spurs and continually proves it – no more so than in this fixture. There was a genuine concern as to how Harry Kane would react when coming back from World Cup penalty disappointment – yet he’s bagged four goals in the four games since the restart. He’s bagged three goals against Arsenal in the past two North London derbies – including the opener two meetings ago. In any other season, he’d be lauded for his scoring exploits with 15 goals in 16 games. He’s unfortunate that Erling Haaland joined this year. Spurs vs Arsenal – What the managers have said We’ll hear from both managers later this week when they preview this crunch encounter.

Balague said this while providing an update on Messi’s future with PSG amid reports linking the Argentina captain with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal this summer. Messi is in the final year of his PSG contract in Paris but is yet to sign a new deal with the French Ligue 1 champions. The former Barcelona captain has been in exceptional form for both club and country so far this season, as he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar last year. “There has not been an offer (from Al-Hilal). PSG and Messi are organising a meeting in the next few weeks to finalise the deal that will keep him in Paris,” Balague said, as quoted by PSG Talk. “Right now, his motivation is to stay in Europe. He is the favourite to win the Ballon d’Or; he is still in the Champions League; he has big targets after winning the World Cup. Not only does it make no sense to approach him with that offer, it has not existed.” Ballon d’Or 2023: Favourite player to win award named","pubDate":"2023-01-15 09:47:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailypost","country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Napoli’s title dream fuelled by ‘goal twins’ Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football-napoli-s-title-dream-fuelled-by-goal-twins-osimhen-and-kvaratskhelia","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 15, 2023 5:07 PMMILAN – Dazzling duo Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia have Napoli dreaming after starring in a five-goal massacre of Juventus which made them clear favourites to claim a first Serie A title in over three decades.","content":"MILAN – Dazzling duo Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia have Napoli dreaming after starring in a five-goal massacre of Juventus which made them clear favourites to claim a first Serie A title in over three decades. Luciano Spalletti’s team have bewitched much of Europe with their all-action football this season and the way his two star attackers combined to destroy Juve on Friday night and secure a nine-point lead on champions AC Milan suggests that this time southern Italy’s biggest club are the real deal. Osimhen took his league tally to 12 with a brace, while Kvaratskhelia netted his ninth of the season in all competitions and had a hand in all the others as Juve and their eight-match winning streak were blown away in Naples. The pair set up each other’s goals with the crowning moment Kvaratskhelia’s inch-perfect cross which allowed Osimhen to head in Napoli’s fourth midway through the second half at a packed, and delirious Stadio Maradona. On Sunday, daily La Repubblica crowned them “the goal twins”, the same nickname given to Roberto Mancini and recently deceased Gianluca Vialli who shot Sampdoria to their only league title in 1991. Napoli last won the Scudetto the previous season, at the tail end of Diego Maradona’s reign in Naples before he was chased out of Italy in disgrace. Kvaratskhelia is the closest Napoli have come to replicating the Maradona magic, his seven league goals matched with as many assists and an air of attacking menace which has taken his team to another level. “He’s an extraordinary player, the best of the lot, the most complete,” said Spalletti on Friday. “In some situations he’s simply devastating and he’s got the courage to try things out.” Meanwhile the astonishing form of Nigeria striker Osimhen has made him look like the club’s best centre-forward since Edinson Cavani. The 24-year-old has scored 11 times in as many games in all competitions since returning from a thigh injury in mid-October, and Spalletti thinks there is even more to come. “Osimhen is such a great striker. The potential he has is scary, I’m excited to see what he can do in future,” Spalletti said. “He still has a remarkable amount of room for improvement.” The one negative note for Napoli is that they will not have their hardcore fans following them away from home after they were barred from travelling for two months on Saturday. The ban was put in place after serious clashes between Napoli’s ultras and their Roma counterparts last weekend, a mass brawl at a service station which temporarily shut down one of Italy’s most important motorways. However, apart from April’s trip to Juve, Napoli’s remaining clashes with Italy’s big boys all come at home, where supporters are packing out the stands and making a terrific noise in the hope of history. If Napoli win the title, it would also be a huge personal victory for Spalletti, a respected coach and colourful character who however has the reputation of not being able to get his teams over the line when the pressure is on. Last season Napoli were in the mix until April when a run of awful results led to the title race becoming an all-Milan affair in the final weeks. That collapse, and the departure of a host of fan favourites in the summer, including Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea, led to a rebellion in which supporters pleaded owner Aurelio de Laurentiis to sell the club. Instead on Friday, de Laurentiis was seen bouncing in the stands along with the joyous fans who have in Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia two lethal weapons ready to fire Napoli to glory.

Several of the club’s key strategists, including chief footballing operations officer Omar Berrada, are involved and some of the data tools that the club uses can be seen. First there is a transaction tracker shown on screen, looking at the global spend during last summer’s window. The analyst speaking, who is not named, tells the meeting that the market is bouncing back towards what would have been seen pre-pandemic. By the end of it, Premier League clubs alone had spent more than £2bn. A chart detailing the City Football Group’s club-by-club spend at that stage of the window is displayed as another voice, who is unnamed and not shown on screen, provides context around the umbrella of clubs’ overall strategy. “I get the impression our clubs are getting better at squad planning, understanding who their targets are ahead of the window and beating their competitors to the punch,” he says. This meeting happens at an undefined point in a window when Erling Haaland arrives from Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth £51.2m, though the overall financial outlay is much higher because the Norway striker is on a salary eclipsed only by PSG’s Kylian Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr. Berrada then sets out how City, aside from acknowledging the importance of the striker’s father having played for the club between 2000 and 2003, won the race to bring him to East Manchester. POLL “A player like Haaland really could have chosen any top team in Europe. Almost all the top teams were interested in his signature,” he says to camera. “For us it was about understanding what motivates him. When you boil it down to its essence, he wanted a football project. We spent a lot of time explaining the football project. “He’s a strong character and the decision was taken by him but clearly the fact that his father had played for Man City, there was an affinity.” The documentary, from the makers of the All or Nothing: Juventus series, spreads its wings far beyond the Premier League. Japhet Tanganga’s will-he-won’t-he leave Tottenham for Serie A is detailed but so is Fabian Ruiz’s refusal to sign a new contract at Napoli as he aims to secure a move away before ending up at Paris Saint-Germain. Junior Adamu, the Red Bull Salzburg forward, gets as much screen time in the opening episode as Steve Parish, the Crystal Palace chairman who reflects on the need to look at the human side of a deal, and West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan as he explains why his club “sometimes has the money, sometimes doesn’t have the money” to sign players. Interspersed with clips from Sky Sports News’ reporting of transfers, there are also some interesting glimpses into how agents interact with their players. Family members, such as Tanganga’s father and Ruiz’s mother, pop up as they discuss what is best for their son’s futures with representatives. It is unlikely to make any supporter think very differently about how the transfer window works and the focus, for obvious reasons, is on the big names but there is more than enough from the glimpses behind the curtain to understand how precarious the whole market can be, why moves sometimes break down amid reminders of the obscene amount of money being spent. “The transfer market has almost become a competition in itself,” Berrada says. “What you don’t realise is the sheer amount of pressure you deal with. Yes, there’s an element of the transaction – the salary, the fee, the commission. “But you’re dealing with people, people who have dreams, fears and who may have influences within their own entourage. You have to really try and understand who you are speaking to. When you understand that you have a better sense of how to negotiate.”","pubDate":"2023-01-15 08:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"independentng","country":["nigeria"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CHAN-Algérie 2022 : Jonathan Ikangalobo élu l’homme du match RDC – Ouganda","link":"https://acturdc.com/chan-algerie-2022-jonathan-ikangalobo-elu-lhomme-du-match-rdc-ouganda/","keywords":["Sport","CHAN-Algérie 2022"],"creator":["Junior Lwamba"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jonathan Ikangalobo a été élu l’homme du match RDC -Ouganda ce samedi 14 janvier, à l’issue du match nul (0-0) entre les deux nations comptant pour la première journée du groupe B. « Je suis heureux d’être élu l’homme du match.

The way it played out was fitting.After the field goal went through, after the idea of the third-largest comeback in postseason history became real, Trevor Lawrence wheeled around in circles with his head leaned forward, running toward his Jaguars teammates like a child who finally got clearance to join friends at recess. This moment of celebration, this expression, this aura, this vibe, this smile, would have seemed notable had it not been plastered across his face for almost the entirety of the night. Sure, Lawrence seemed displeased with each of the four interceptions he threw in the first half. He would pucker up his lips into that strange, Peyton Manning–like smile-frown that we all do after polishing off a bag of Sour Patch Kids. After the third one, he looked at the video board as if it might contain some sort of basics-of-quarterbacking PowerPoint he could utilize for the second half. But, he also kept walking back to the sideline like he owned the place, like having to slog through quarterbacking hell and spot one of the best opposing quarterbacks, best pass-rushing tandems and most expensive secondaries in the league 27 points was all part of the plan. And, amid a season where players seemed to be better than ever at sniffing out sham confidence, sham personality and sham talent in their own quarterbacks, no one seemed to blink. His teammates trusted him. Plenty of fans didn’t turn off their televisions. Somehow, everyone knew this was at least possible. Somehow, Lawrence had everyone roped in together. Lawrence is here to stay, marking a quick turnaround from a disastrous rookie season under Urban Meyer.Nathan Ray Seebeck/USA TODAY Sports We can call Saturday, and Jacksonville’s 31–30 wild-card win over the Chargers, the night Lawrence arrived in the NFL. And, like the self-help guru says, it necessitated a trip through the worst of it all. Take your pick of the platitudes. It’s always darkest before dawn or, like John Wooden said, things work out best for those who make the best out of the way things work out. Lawrence became the first player in modern NFL playoff history to throw three picks in one quarter. He was the first to throw four in a playoff half since Brett Favre in 2001. He was also damn near perfect in the second half. The Jaguars became the first team in NFL history to win a playoff game in which they were minus-five in turnover margin and just the 29th team to do it … ever. The comeback—from down 27–0 in the first half, and down 30–14 late in the third quarter and still down 10 points when taking over the ball with 8:47 to play—says a lot about Lawrence but it also says a lot about a franchise that was similarly, collectively, backed into the worst possible situation merely a little more than a year ago. Had it not been for their owner mercifully willing to do what billionaires almost never do—admitting a mistake, admitting, in some indirect way, that he was conned, duped, deceived, lied to and, in that process, setting a promising young franchise on a voyage bound for the nearest iceberg—we may currently be talking about what the Jaguars would do with the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft. We may be talking about needing to airlift into Duval and rescue Lawrence ourselves. We may be talking about Urban Meyer kicking multiple players (gasp). It’s strange to think—to know—that this quarterback, this team, this kind of promise and this (statistically) improbable run of six straight wins, and seven of eight, that began with a 10-point loss to the Chiefs in Week 10 existed somewhere in the DNA of a team that went 3–14 a year ago.It’s even stranger that the Jaguars managed to artfully limit their time in the post-Meyer football abyss. From coaching dunce to swaggering genius. From wasted talent to limitless potential. Jacksonville’s second half was a kind of artful interpretation of that. The Jaguars’ season will come full circle in a lot of ways next weekend in Arrowhead (should the heavily favored Bills and Bengals both win) where, in the same locker room before Thanksgiving, coach Doug Pederson predicted all of this would happen. But it really doesn’t matter. The Jaguars could get waxed by Patrick Mahomes again but they still fulfilled their contribution to the football zeitgeist in 2022. They showed us the power of admitting our biggest mistakes. They showed us how valuable it is to keep swinging (or, in Lawrence’s case, more of a stabbing, especially on the critical two-point conversion try in the fourth quarter). They showed us what happens when you let football players be young and fun, whipping out the damn T-formation on a critical fourth-and-1 as if the Jaguars were facing off against Air Force; as if the Jaguars were in a backyard somewhere and not about to make NFL history. For the franchise, this moment was as massive and important as breaking ground in Northern Florida in the first place. A ho-hum 24–13 victory over the Chargers wouldn’t have fit the bill. Some defensive trudge, like the game last Saturday night against the Titans that lifted them into the playoffs to begin with, wouldn’t have carried the proper symbolism. Several times in their mostly unsuccessful run as a franchise, the Jaguars have sprung to life before flatlining again. But 2021 was the worst of it. The year that preceded this one should have cemented them as a laughingstock football outpost for a decade. And instead, through it all, Lawrence came out smiling. There is nothing more valuable. ","pubDate":"2023-01-15 07:40:47","image_url":"http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk1MTczMDMxODMwNjI4MDY2/trevor-lawrence-comeback.jpg","source_id":"si","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Departing coach Park focused on Vietnam's push for victory","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-departing-coach-park-focused-on-vietnams-push-for-victory","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 15, 2023 2:15 PMHANOI – Monday marks the end of an era for Vietnamese football as Park Hang-seo leads the national team for the last time, with the much-loved South Korean coach looking to sign off in style by bringing the country a third Asean Football Federation (AFF) Championship title.","content":"HANOI – Monday marks the end of an era for Vietnamese football as Park Hang-seo leads the national team for the last time, with the much-loved South Korean coach looking to sign off in style by bringing the country a third Asean Football Federation (AFF) Championship title. Vietnam meet defending champions Thailand in the second leg of the final at Thammasat Stadium outside Bangkok, with the Thais in the driving seat after a 2-2 draw in Hanoi last Friday, the 65-year-old Park’s last game at the My Dinh Stadium. “We need only one goal (more than Thailand) to become champions,” he said ahead of Monday’s vital clash. “Of course, 2-2 is not a good score for Vietnam ahead of the second leg in Thailand, because of the away-goal rule. “Thailand have the advantage, but that doesn’t mean we give up. We will try to win in Thailand.” Park, an assistant to Guus Hiddink when South Korea reached the 2002 World Cup semi-finals, has overseen an upsurge in the national team’s fortunes during his five years in charge. But while the end of his tenure is just around the corner, he is focused only on getting the right result for his team. “From the beginning of my contract till now, my players and I have always tried our best in each competition and each match,” he said earlier in the competition. “There is no change even though I am stepping down after the tournament. “We focus on the next match and not think about what is the last match (for me).” After taking over in September 2017, Park led Vietnam to the semi-finals of the 2018 Asian Games and winning the Asean Championship later the same year. In 2019, Park’s team progressed to the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup, losing 1-0 to four-time champions Japan. They also reached the final phase of Asia’s World Cup preliminaries for the first time during qualifying for Qatar 2022. Park’s impact has seen him lauded at home, with South Korea President Yoon Suk-yeol awarding him the Heungin Medal for promoting friendship between the countries. In Vietnam, a documentary was shown to sell-out crowds in cinemas across the country. Having previously said he plans to open an academy in Vietnam once his tenure ends, Park looks set to continue helping the country in its pursuit of a first World Cup Finals berth. With Asia’s guaranteed quota increasing to eight spots for the 2026 World Cup, that goal appears closer than ever.

He isn’t fuelled by a burning desire to prove everyone else wrong, and he said as much in a pre-draft interview with Sports Illustrated in the spring of 2021. But, come on. What he did Saturday night had to feel pretty darn gratifying. Making his postseason debut, the second-year quarterback had as ugly of a first half as one could imagine — going 10-for-24 with four interceptions — while the Jaguars drowned in a 27-0 deficit. Then he flipped the script, leading the charge in the largest comebacks in NFL postseason history. .acf-block-preview .instagram-twitter-container { width: 340px; margin: 0 auto; } Fortunately for Lawrence, his first impression in postseason play wasn’t a lasting one. The Jaguars scored on all four of their second-half possessions — including three touchdown passes from Lawrence — clawing their way to a sixth-consecutive victory. Lawrence had almost as many first-half interceptions (four) as he had second-half incompletions (five). Saturday’s epic finish in Duval County got us off to a great start to the Wild Card weekend. Here are the rest of your takeaways from the two-game slate: Bosa’s blunders When a team blows a 27-point lead, there are plenty of directions in which to point a finger of blame. On an individual level, though, no one is more deserving of some judgemental side-eye than Joey Bosa. A quick box score scan would only tell you that Bosa logged a single tackle against the Jaguars. But the story of his night came with a pair of bone-headed blunders when the ball wasn’t in play. Midway through the third quarter, the Chargers sacked Lawrence on a third and seven to force a field goal attempt. Er, that’s what would’ve happened had Bosa not lined up offside. With new life, the Jaguars scored a touchdown four plays later. Fast forward to the final five-and-a-half minutes of the game, when Lawrence connected with Christian Kirk for a touchdown. Afterward, Bosa appeared to be upset about a potential false start that wasn’t called on a Jaguars lineman, and he two-hand slammed his helmet in rage. .acf-block-preview .instagram-twitter-container { width: 340px; margin: 0 auto; } Bosa was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, which allowed Jacksonville to move the ball to the one-yard line for a two-point try — giving Lawrence the appropriate proximity to reach the ball across for a conversion. Again, the Chargers’ collapse was not short on screwups (including Cameron Dicker’s 40-yard missed field goal). But Bosa deserves a “C’Mon, Man!” segment all to himself. Deebo the dominator So, that ankle seems to be holding up OK, eh? Deebo Samuel, who missed Weeks 15-17 with a sprained ankle, was back in wrecking ball mode for San Francisco on Saturday. He gobbled up 165 scrimmage yards, including a 74-yard house call that put the game away. var adServerUrl = \"\"; var $el = $( \"#video_container-401669\" ); var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink'); /* if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) { var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}}; adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&cust_params=domain%3Dsportsnet.ca&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=6318697134112&cmsid=384', so, permalink); } else { adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&cust_params=domain%3Dsportsnet.ca&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=6318697134112&cmsid=384\"; } */ adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&cust_params=domain%3Dsportsnet.ca&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=6318697134112&cmsid=384\"; var adServerUrl_result = adServerUrl.includes(\"cust_params\"); var queryString=''; if(adServerUrl_result){ var gettheDUFI = localStorage.getItem(\"theRED_loc\") if(gettheDUFI){ queryString += \"dufiid=\" + gettheDUFI + '&'; queryString += \"ppid=\" + gettheDUFI + '&'; var ppid = \"ppid=\" + gettheDUFI + '&'; } var DUFI_IP = sessionStorage.getItem(\"DUFI_IP\") if(DUFI_IP){ queryString += \"dufiip=\" + DUFI_IP + '&'; } adServerUrl = adServerUrl.replace(/cust_params=/, ppid + 'cust_params=' + encodeURIComponent(queryString) ); } $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ?

Once the end zone was in sight, he activated his afterburners. He wasn’t just running fast, though. He was running angry. Earlier in the game, Seattle safety Jonathan Abram decided to test Samuel’s ankle by giving it a late twist after making a tackle. Samuel was slow to get up, later saying that he “almost lost (his) temper” and needed a beat to stay composed. Then he dished his payback by finding paydirt. The return of a full-bore Samuel is huge, and it aligns with San Francisco’s theme as a squad peaking at the right time. According to Fox, the 49ers are the 13th team in the Super Bowl era to enter the playoffs on a winning streak of 10-plus games, and they’ll try to be the fourth team to ride that wave to a Super Bowl win (the most example is the 2003 Patriots). Samuel, who now has 685 scrimmage yards in seven career playoff games, certainly helps in that quest. Seattle’s swift spiral Everything was going swimmingly for the Seahawks — until it wasn’t. Walking to the locker room at halftime, Seattle had committed neither a penalty nor a turnover. Geno Smith was pitching a near-perfect game, completing nine of 10 passes and staking his team to an unexpected lead. Stitching together 30 minutes of good football is nice. But sometimes it only takes 30 seconds for the seams to burst. In its first possession of the second half, Seattle chipped and chunked its way into the red zone. Then a destructive four-play sequence unfolded: one-yard rush attempt, penalty, incomplete pass … sack fumble. var adServerUrl = \"\"; var $el = $( \"#video_container-743274\" ); var permalink = $el.closest('.snet-single-article').data('permalink'); /* if ( \"1\" == true && 'undefined' !== typeof window.getIndexAds ) { var so = {preroll:{1:{1:{siteID:191888},2:{siteID:191889}}}}; adServerUrl = window.getIndexAds( 'http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&cust_params=domain%3Dsportsnet.ca&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=6318696532112&cmsid=384', so, permalink); } else { adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&cust_params=domain%3Dsportsnet.ca&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=6318696532112&cmsid=384\"; } */ adServerUrl = \"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&cust_params=domain%3Dsportsnet.ca&iu=%2F7326%2Fen.sportsnet.web%2FVideo&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&ad_rule=1&vid=6318696532112&cmsid=384\"; var adServerUrl_result = adServerUrl.includes(\"cust_params\"); var queryString=''; if(adServerUrl_result){ var gettheDUFI = localStorage.getItem(\"theRED_loc\") if(gettheDUFI){ queryString += \"dufiid=\" + gettheDUFI + '&'; queryString += \"ppid=\" + gettheDUFI + '&'; var ppid = \"ppid=\" + gettheDUFI + '&'; } var DUFI_IP = sessionStorage.getItem(\"DUFI_IP\") if(DUFI_IP){ queryString += \"dufiip=\" + DUFI_IP + '&'; } adServerUrl = adServerUrl.replace(/cust_params=/, ppid + 'cust_params=' + encodeURIComponent(queryString) ); } $el.after( unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\\\"\" + (document.location.protocol == \"https:\" ?

The Seahawks had a three-and-out and an interception on their two ensuing possessions, while San Fran scored on three in a row. The talent gap between these teams should’ve been obvious from the start. Seattle could stay in the game if it stayed mistake-free, but the first real slip-up put the team in a spiral. On a brighter note, do you know who’s trending up? That journeyman quarterback that many expected to hold a clipboard for Drew Lock this year. Smith, a free agent who picked a great time to have a 30-touchdown season, is reportedly expected to return to Seattle on either the franchise tag or a new deal. For a guy who’s made roughly $17.5M in a 10-year career, his next signature will be a pricey one. Between Smith’s resurgence and Seattle’s ownership of the fifth-overall draft pick (thanks, Russell Wilson), there are reasons to have your chin up if you reside in the Pacific Northwest.

The 19-year-old suffered fatal injuries after being hit by a taxi at around 2.40am on Tuesday, December 27 while making his way home from a Sunderland game. He was walking along the A689 in the Toronto area when he was struck by a Peugeot, which was heading towards Bishop Auckland. Paramedics attended, but the teenager was pronounced dead at the scene.

In a fresh sight of the turmoil enveloping the Toffees, the club’s board of directors were ordered to stay away from Goodison Park last weekend due to perceived security risks. The move came after offensive messages, including death threats to chairman Bill Kenwright, were made to specific individuals during the week. “It was a tense game. Frustrated to lose, frustrated for everyone,” Lampard said. “It’s clear in football that sometimes if you aren’t winning games it can become contagious in terms of confidence and we know we are in that spot. “It feels like a casual statement, that we have ‘forgot how to win’ but I understand the point, we are in a period of games where we are not winning. “It’s a difficult time. I understand the situation we are in here, I hear the noise but I have to keep working. “We need to just work in our own way to do the best and my own way is to wake up tomorrow morning and go: ‘OK, let’s go again’.” Everton officials called it a “profoundly sad day” because of the threats and matters were no better on the pitch as Lampard’s men squandered the lead given to them by Amadou Onana’s first goal for the Toffees. James Ward-Prowse scored twice as Southampton moved level on 15 points with Everton, who are only off the bottom of the table on goal difference. Everton, who have lost their fourth successive home league game in a row, have managed just one win in 11 league matches and have their joint lowest tally at the halfway stage of a Premier League campaign. That wretched performance added extra numbers to the planned sit-in protest after the final whistle as fans called for owner Farhad Moshiri to sell up, with some also demanding Lampard’s sacking. The last time the Merseysiders had 15 points at this time of the season they were relegated in 1951, but Lampard is determined to keep fighting to save Everton, who narrowly avoided the drop under his leadership last term. He also said that he expects his ailing side to bounce back when they travel to 18th-placed West Ham United this weekend. “The only thing that is important is the reaction,” he said. “The effort of the players, the desire of the players (against Southampton) was big. “But, in terms of the performance, we know that’s not enough and I’ll be the first to take responsibility for that.” AFP, REUTERS","pubDate":"2023-01-15 05:44:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"straitstimes","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: Former France federation boss Le Graet faces 'sexist outrage' claim","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-former-france-federation-boss-le-graet-faces-sexist-outrage-claim","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 15, 2023 1:00 PMPARIS – Former French football chief Noel Le Graet could face criminal proceedings after a claim of a “sexist outrage” was made against him, Le Monde reported on Saturday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-15 05:00:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"straitstimes","country":["singapore"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Daily Schmankerl: FC Barcelona, Real Madrid battling over Bayern Munich’s Benjamin Pavard?; RB Leipzig outdueling Bayern, Liverpool, Chelsea, PSG for star midfielder?; Inter Miami, Barca hold out hope for Leo Messi; Bayern rejects GK; and MORE!","link":"https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2023/1/15/23553346/fc-barcelona-real-madrid-bayern-munich-pavard-rb-leipzig-liverpool-chelsea-psg-inter-miami-messi-tel","keywords":null,"creator":["CSmith1919"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Photo by Christina Pahnke - sampics/Getty Images Time is ticking on Bayern Munich’s hopes for a new goalkeeper. Madrid, Barca battle over Bayern’s Pavard (Madrid Universal) It seems that Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard has both FC Barcelona and Real Madrid eyeing him up. The report below states that Real Madrid has interest in Pavard, but might be at least a little wary that he wants to play exclusively as a center-back. At this stage, Real Madrid wants a right-back and there is no word on whether or not the Frenchman would ink a deal to play that position: A lot has been said about David Alaba’s reluctance to play at left-back this season. The Austrian International was initially signed for his dynamic profile and ability to play both in central and the left side of defence, but the plan did not pan out as expected for Real Madrid. If reports from Sky Sport Germany (h/t Madrid Xtra) are to be believed, the Merengues dodged a similar bullet with Benjamin Pavard. Reports had recently suggested that Real Madrid had shown an interest in signing in the French international, who is set to leave the club at the end of the season. The 26-year-old has 18 months left on his contract at Bayern Munich but is unlikely to renew and the German champions are said to be open to his departure this summer, following a few disciplinary issues. Real Madrid are among a host of clubs to have been linked with Pavard, with arch-rivals Barcelona also being credited with an interest. The report from Sky Germany mentions that Los Blancos enquired about the player’s availability with Bayern Munich recently as a possible reinforcement for the right-back position. Meanwhile, Barca Universal captured a report that states the Catalans are actually pole position to land Pavard: According to German publication BILD (h/t MARCA), Barcelona are in pole position to secure the signing of Bayern Munich right-back Benjamin Pavard. The 26-year-old Frenchman is also on the radars of Real Madrid. Pavard has had somewhat of a falling out with Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann. And with his contract expiring in 18 months, rumours of a summer exit have been doing the rounds for a while now. Leipzig to snatch Koné? RB Leipzig might out-duel Bayern Munich, Liverpool FC, Chelsea FC, and Paris Saint-Germain for Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Manu Koné: It would be typical of RB Leipzig to turn an outgoing transfer into a net win. This week Leipzig has been heavily linked with Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Manu Koné. A transfer, however, is not shoo-in as the 21-year-old is also desired by the likes of Bayern Munich, Liverpool, PSG, and Chelsea. Although an up-and-coming club, Leipzig is not yet on the level with some of the teams mentioned. But Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl has the ultimate card up his sleeve. The 49-year-old knows all the details of the Koné contract as he signed the Frenchman while he was the sporting director in Gladbach. Bavarian Podcast Works — Weekend Warm-up Podcast: Season 2, Episode 27 (Bavarian Football Works) Bayern Munich is nearing its return to real action (non-friendlies) and there is plenty to yack about after the team broke its training camp in Doha.

However, the agent was told that Bayern are not interested. Franjo Vranjkovic, agent of goalkeeper Vladan Kovačević, offers him to Bayern again: “An English club is willing to buy him now and loan him out to one of the top 10 leagues for 6 months, only to a club playing for something. That would be a great situation for Bayern”.” Vranjkovic: “Everyone would be happy with that: Rakow would have a great transfer, the English club would get their ideal goalkeeper, Bayern would be guaranteed clean sheets and Kovačević would be one step closer to having a great career.”","pubDate":"2023-01-15 05:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"bavarianfootballworks","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Football: PSG threaten to quit Parc des Princes after city refuses to sell","link":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-psg-threaten-to-quit-parc-des-princes-after-city-refuses-to-sell","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"January 15, 2023 12:28 PMPARIS – Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday threatened to quit the Parc des Princes ground, which has been their home for almost 50 years, after city officials refused to sell the stadium to them.","content":"PARIS – Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday threatened to quit the Parc des Princes ground, which has been their home for almost 50 years, after city officials refused to sell the stadium to them. City mayor Anne Hidalgo said in an interview published in Saturday’s Parisien newspaper that the stadium is “not for sale” and will not be sold to Qatari-owned PSG. However, a spokesman for the club said he was “disappointed and surprised” that the city wanted to “turn Paris Saint-Germain and their supporters out of the Parc des Princes”. “The mayor is forcing PSG to leave its home,” he said. “It is surprising and disappointing to hear that the mayor of Paris is taking a position which, effectively, will force PSG from the Parc des Princes while also adding tens of millions of euros to the taxpayer burden to maintain the structure of the building.” He added: “Everyone loses in the position taken by the mayor. PSG is now forced to find alternative options to relocate the club. “This is not the outcome the club, nor its supporters, were hoping for.” PSG have made acquisition of the ground in the city’s leafy western suburbs a condition for carrying out modernisation and expansion works to the tune of €500 million (S$714.3 million). In November, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told Spanish sports daily Marca that PSG were “no longer welcome” at the Parc des Princes, adding that they were looking at other alternatives. “They are pressuring us to leave,” he said, insisting that the Qataris had invested €80 million – before Euro 2016 – in a stadium “which is not ours”. The club has already put in one offer to buy the ground but according to Hidalgo’s deputy Emmanuel Gregoire, it amounted to only €40 million. “It’s cheaper than Paredes,” he joked in reference to the Argentinian midfielder Leandro Paredes, who cost PSG €47 million when he joined in 2019. Inaugurated in 1897 then remodelled in 1972, the former velodrome, with its 48,000 capacity, has been home to the Parisian club since 1974. The current 30-year lease kicked in in 2014. “It is a firm and definitive position,” added Hidalgo on the city’s stance. “It is an exceptional piece of heritage for Parisians.” But her team have said they are ready to discuss the ground issue, even if the sale is not her “priority option”. “We must support PSG in its desire and its need for renovation, for increasing capacity, for modernising the Parc,” she said, adding that “part of the stadium is on the ring road so we cannot dig”. PSG have been the most successful club in France since Qatar Sports Investments took over in 2011, winning the league eight times. They have also had success in France’s domestic Cup competitions, but have yet to win the Champions League.

With just 12 minutes left at Old Trafford, United were trailing to Jack Grealish’s 60 th minute header in the season’s second Manchester derby. But City’s title defence suffered a damaging blow as Portugal midfielder Fernandes equalised in hugely debatable fashion before Marcus Rashford bagged United’s 82 nd minute winner. Fernandes’ goal was the turning point and City boss Pep Guardiola and his players were seething after the flag went up for offside when Rashford ran on to Casemiro’s pass. Rashford did not touch the ball and was deemed by VAR not to have interfered with play, but City were adamant the England forward clearly distracted the defenders and goalkeeper Ederson. “The first goal is a joke that it can be allowed,” City defender Manuel Akanji told BBC Sport. “He runs for 30 metres, he’s chasing the ball. In the situation, I played him (Rashford) offside. I understand he doesn’t touch the ball, but for me it is clearly offside.” Guardiola insisted there was no doubt Rashford’s run impacted the reactions of Akanji and Ederson. “The decision is the referee’s, the VAR, but our defenders make a line for Rashford,” he said. “If we know it’s Fernandes we don’t make the line, we follow the action, and after the action the interference for Ederson.” Third placed United are now just one point behind second placed City, who are in danger of losing substantial ground in the title race this week. A win for leaders Arsenal at north London rivals Tottenham on Sunday would put the Gunners eight points clear. While City splutter, United are in fine form following their ninth successive victory in all competitions. Asked if they are in the title race, boss Erik ten Hag said: “The fans may dream but we are not. We have improved, that is obvious. There is still a long way to go.” Dismal Liverpool Liverpool’s hopes of salvaging a top four finish from a difficult campaign suffered a major hit as Brighton swept to victory on the south-coast. After dominating the first half without making the breakthrough, Brighton deservedly took the lead in the 47 th minute. Joel Matip carelessly surrendered possession to Alexis Mac Allister and he found Kaoru Mitoma, whose cross was perfectly weighted for the unmarked Solly March to tap in. Liverpool were in disarray and six minutes later, March crashed a fine finish into the far corner from just inside the area. Danny Welbeck wrapped up the victory, flicking March’s pass over Joe Gomez and volleying home. Beaten at Brentford in their previous league game, Liverpool are languishing in ninth place, seven points adrift of the top four, and look a shadow of the team that nearly won the quadruple last term. “Bad. Really bad. I can’t remember a worse game. It was a very organised team against a not very organised team,” Klopp said. Liverpool’s Merseyside rivals Everton are in even more dire straits after Southampton’s 2-1 win at Goodison Park. Everton’s board of directors did not attend the game because of a “real and credible threat to their safety”. Everton have won only one of their last 13 matches in all competitions and banners calling for owner Farhad Moshiri to sell up were unfurled before kick-off. Amadou Onana gave Lampard’s men the lead, but James Ward-Prowse struck twice for Southampton and thousands of Everton fans staged a sit-in protest after the final whistle. Southampton remain bottom of the table but they are now behind second bottom Everton only on goal difference. “It’s clear in football that sometimes if you aren’t winning games it can become contagious in terms of confidence and we know we are in that spot,” Lampard said. West Ham fill the final place in the bottom three after a 1-0 defeat at Wolves that saw the hosts move above the hapless Hammers. Nottingham Forest beat Leicester 2-0, while Brentford defeated fourth bottom Bournemouth 2-0.","pubDate":"2023-01-15 03:16:00","image_url":" \n\t\t","source_id":"thephuketnews","country":["thailand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The rules must be amended before cynical fouling and fear of failure rob football of its soul for good","link":"https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/the-rules-must-be-amended-before-cynical-fouling-and-fear-of-failure-rob-football-of-its-soul-for-good-42287426.html","keywords":["Gaelic Football"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Welcome to the Gaelic football factory, where every team looks the same, sounds the same and plays the same.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-15 02:30:00","image_url":"https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/40411/42287424.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/Sports2408247%202","source_id":"independent","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"As Lee Keegan steps aside, the curtain falls on Mayo’s glorious generation","link":"https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/as-lee-keegan-steps-aside-the-curtain-falls-on-mayos-glorious-generation-42287428.html","keywords":["Gaelic Football"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lee Keegan isn’t the best player never to win an All-Ireland.

We need him to play big in the second half. That’s when it counts. It’s going to be tough all the way through, but how are you going to perform in the tough moments? We just gotta keep supporting him.”When pressed by Wyche to elaborate on the claim that Purdy could be the reason that the team could win a Super Bowl, Warner continued to heap praise on the rookie quarterback.“As a rookie you can’t talk enough about the way he’s come in and played. I’ve never seen it before in my whole life. I don’t know if anybody’s played like this. Coming in, late in the season and I think he’s the one people should be talking about. Forget everything else. He’s the guy right now. We just need to take it one at a time like we always do and play team football.”Purdy finished 18-of-30 passing for 332 yards and three touchdowns, and added a one-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. While the San Francisco offense had played well most of the season with Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback, the unit has raised their game to another level with Purdy in the lineup.","pubDate":"2023-01-15 02:03:27","image_url":"http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk1MTY5MjM1ODg0ODQ0Nzcw/brock-purdy-1.jpg","source_id":"si","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ronaldo n’est qu’un début, l’Arabie saoudite veut piller l’Europe","link":"https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/ronaldo-nest-quun-debut-larabie-saoudite-veut-piller-leurope-629373","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lionel Messi pourrait-il finir par rejoindre Cristiano Ronaldo en Arabie saoudite ?
