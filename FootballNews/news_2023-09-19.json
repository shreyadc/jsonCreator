United‚Äôs 3-1 meek home loss to Brighton is hardly the best preparation to face Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Wednesday, nor are the injury problems that continue to pile up. The Red Devils have lost Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire since the weekend, joining the likes of Raphael Varane, Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia on the sidelines. ‚ÄúYes, of course it‚Äôs a concern,‚Äù Ten Hag said of the spate of injuries that leaves him with a 21-man squad in Germany featuring four goalkeepers. ‚ÄúBut we knew that before and that‚Äôs why we constructed the squad with depth, so we can deal with it, the squad can deal with it.‚Äù Asked whether he can speak to the medical staff about the injury situation, the United boss said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we have to go to the doctors or physios because they are dealing with the problems. ‚ÄúFirst of all, injuries always come in top football because we‚Äôre living on the edge. ‚ÄúOf course we analyse why things happen, but we also have to deal with the facts and it‚Äôs always about the players available. Testing out the new ball üëå ‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a strong side we can line up and we have to get the best out of it and we‚Äôre focusing on that. ‚ÄúTo bring up tomorrow again, a good team, make the next step, integrate Rasmus Hojlund, (Sergio) Reguilon), two new players and we are here to get a result.‚Äù Sofyan Amrabat, Kobbie Mainoo and Amad Diallo are others out of the Group A opener through injury, while Donny van de Beek is unavailable having been left out of United‚Äôs Champions League squad. Beyond that, Jadon Sancho remains absent ‚Äúpending resolution of a squad discipline issue‚Äù and Antony has been given a leave of absence following assault allegations against him. ‚ÄúOne thing is true, I think from the start last season I think I almost never started with the best starting XI ‚Äì there was always something like injury,‚Äù Ten Hag said. ‚ÄúBut you have to deal with it and I think we always got the results in apart from the period where we are in now. ‚ÄúThat is football and I have the experience in the past, I managed it in the past. It‚Äôs not always going up and you have to deal with it. ‚ÄúI like these situations because now we have to handle it and we have to manage this. You have to know what to do and that is focusing on the process.‚Äù Ten Hag‚Äôs belief about their path is why he is not getting thrown off kilter by the negativity heading into United‚Äôs first Champions League match in 18 months. ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt feel that we need a reset,‚Äù the former Bayern Munich reserve boss said. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. ‚ÄúWe are in a process and what you see is that in parts of games we play very good but then also in parts of games we played below our levels. ‚ÄúWhat we have to demand is be consistent, so we have to step up in certain levels all the time for 90-plus minutes. That is the demand on us.‚Äù Wednesday certainly looks a tough ask for United, who will face England captain Harry Kane after he joined Bayern following a summer of speculation. Champions League‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs go! ‚Äî Harry Kane (@HKane) United were strongly linked with the 30-year-old but plumped for promise rather than a proven goalscorer by signing Hojlund, 10 years his junior, from Atalanta. ‚ÄúI think we discussed (Kane and Hojlund during pre-season), so I don‚Äôt think we have to repeat this debate,‚Äù Ten Hag said. ‚ÄúWe are happy with Rasmus. Obviously first games he was injured, he played now Arsenal, he‚Äôs now started. ‚ÄúNow of course we have to integrate him in a team but you can see he‚Äôs a big talent and he will contribute to our game. We are quite confident of that.‚Äù Asked if he had regrets about not signing Kane, Ten Hag simply responded: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-09-19 19:42:32","image_url":"https://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/17244978/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"echo_uk","source_priority":159993,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"80dd81d4e189d1b3b006d6af73298ff9","title":"–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–∞—Ü—Ü–æ–ª—ñ –≤—á–µ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä—Ç–µ –æ—á–æ–ª–∏–≤ –ï–º–ø–æ–ª—ñ","link":"https://champion.com.ua/football/2023/09/19/939166/andreatstsoli-vchetverte-ocholyv-empoli","keywords":["–§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"–ö–µ—Ä—ñ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤–æ –ï–º–ø–æ–ª—ñ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–ª–æ –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏–º —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–æ–º –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏ –ê—É—Ä–µ–ª—ñ–æ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–∞—Ü—Ü–æ–ª—ñ.–ü—Ä–æ —Ü–µ –ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥–æ–º–ª—è—î –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–ª—É–∂–±–∞ –∫–ª—É–±—É.–ö–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç –∑ 69-—Ä—ñ—á–Ω–∏–º —ñ—Ç–∞–ª—ñ–π—Ü–µ–º —Ä–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ —Ä—ñ–∫ –∑ –º–æ–∂–ª–∏–≤—ñ—Å—Ç—é –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è —â–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω.–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –í—ñ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –ö–æ–≤–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∫–∞ –≤–∂–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∞ –ø–µ—Ä—à–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω—É–≤–∞...","content":"#–ï–º–ø–æ–ª—ñ –î–∂–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ - Tribuna.com . –ö–µ—Ä—ñ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤–æ –ï–º–ø–æ–ª—ñ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–ª–æ –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∏–º —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–æ–º –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏ –ê—É—Ä–µ–ª—ñ–æ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–∞—Ü—Ü–æ–ª—ñ. –ü—Ä–æ —Ü–µ –ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥–æ–º–ª—è—î –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–ª—É–∂–±–∞ –∫–ª—É–±—É. –ö–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç –∑ 69-—Ä—ñ—á–Ω–∏–º —ñ—Ç–∞–ª—ñ–π—Ü–µ–º —Ä–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ —Ä—ñ–∫ –∑ –º–æ–∂–ª–∏–≤—ñ—Å—Ç—é –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è —â–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω. –ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –í—ñ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –ö–æ–≤–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∫–∞ –≤–∂–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–ª–∞ –ø–µ—Ä—à–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è –ø—ñ–¥ –∫–µ—Ä—ñ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤–æ–º –Ω–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—É—á–∞. –î–ª—è –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–∞—Ü—Ü–æ–ª—ñ —Ü–µ 4-–π –µ—Ç–∞–ø –≤ –ï–º–ø–æ–ª—ñ. –ü–µ—Ä—à–∏–π –±—É–≤ –∑ –≥—Ä—É–¥–Ω—è 2017-–≥–æ –ø–æ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–æ–ø–∞–¥ 2018-–≥–æ, –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–π - –∑ –±–µ—Ä–µ–∑–Ω—è 2019-–≥–æ –ø–æ —á–µ—Ä–≤–µ–Ω—å 2019-–≥–æ, —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—ñ–π - –∑ —á–µ—Ä–≤–Ω—è 2021-–≥–æ –ø–æ —á–µ—Ä–≤–µ–Ω—å 2022-–≥–æ. –û—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ñ–º –∫–ª—É–±–æ–º —ñ—Ç–∞–ª—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–∞—Ö—ñ–≤—Ü—è –±—É–ª–∞ –¢–µ—Ä–Ω–∞–Ω–∞ –∑ –°–µ—Ä—ñ—ó –ë. –†–∞–Ω—ñ—à–µ –ï–º–ø–æ–ª—ñ –∑–≤—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∏–≤ –ü–∞–æ–ª–æ –î–∑–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—Ç—ñ , –Ω–∞ —á–æ–ª—ñ –∑ —è–∫–∏–º –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–ª–∞ 4 —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–≤—ñ —Ç—É—Ä–∏ –°–µ—Ä—ñ—ó –ê –∑ –∑–∞–≥–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–º —Ä–∞—Ö—É–Ω–∫–æ–º 0:12 —Ç–∞ –π–¥–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—å–æ—é —É —Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ñ—Ä–Ω—ñ–π —Ç–∞–±–ª–∏—Ü—ñ.","pubDate":"2023-09-19 19:25:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"champion","source_priority":1419575,"country":["ukraine"],"category":["sports"],"language":"ukrainian"},{"article_id":"e056c30490a2a7a95fb6d3019ea8e9ec","title":"Rafael Leao guilty of bad miss as Newcastle earn point in UCL opener at AC Milan","link":"https://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/national/23800644.rafael-leao-guilty-bad-miss-newcastle-earn-point-ucl-opener-ac-milan/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Keeper Nick Pope had to be at his best to keep the Rossoneri at bay before the break.","content":"The Portugal international, who was Newcastle star Sandro Tonali‚Äôs team-mate at San Siro until his ¬£53million summer switch to Tyneside, completely fluffed his lines with only goalkeeper Nick Pope to beat after attempting an audacious flick at the end of a stunning 34th-minute run and only succeeded in tripping himself.

Milan sit top of a tough group before Paris Saint-Germain host Borussia Dortmund at the Parc des Princes later on Tuesday, level with their Premier League opposition. Newcastle did little in their first match in Europe‚Äôs top club competition since 2003, the Saudi Arabia-backed team barely creating a chance and lucky to escape with a draw on the balance of play. Tonali‚Äôs father was at the San Siro and saw much more football played by the hosts than by his son, back in the Newcastle starting line-up after missing international duty with injury. The Italy midfielder was loudly cheered by home supporters who don‚Äôt resent his mega-money move to England before kick-off. But home fans, who watched their team be thumped 5-1 by local rivals Inter Milan on Saturday, were left frustrated by their team‚Äôs poor finishing and Newcastle‚Äôs dogged defending which left the match goalless.

United‚Äôs 3-1 meek home loss to Brighton is hardly the best preparation to face Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Wednesday, nor are the injury problems that continue to pile up. The Red Devils have lost Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire since the weekend, joining the likes of Raphael Varane, Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia on the sidelines. ‚ÄúYes, of course it‚Äôs a concern,‚Äù Ten Hag said of the spate of injuries that leaves him with a 21-man squad in Germany featuring four goalkeepers. ‚ÄúBut we knew that before and that‚Äôs why we constructed the squad with depth, so we can deal with it, the squad can deal with it.‚Äù Asked whether he can speak to the medical staff about the injury situation, the United boss said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we have to go to the doctors or physios because they are dealing with the problems. ‚ÄúFirst of all, injuries always come in top football because we‚Äôre living on the edge. ‚ÄúOf course we analyse why things happen, but we also have to deal with the facts and it‚Äôs always about the players available. Testing out the new ball üëå ‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a strong side we can line up and we have to get the best out of it and we‚Äôre focusing on that. ‚ÄúTo bring up tomorrow again, a good team, make the next step, integrate Rasmus Hojlund, (Sergio) Reguilon), two new players and we are here to get a result.‚Äù Sofyan Amrabat, Kobbie Mainoo and Amad Diallo are others out of the Group A opener through injury, while Donny van de Beek is unavailable having been left out of United‚Äôs Champions League squad. Beyond that, Jadon Sancho remains absent ‚Äúpending resolution of a squad discipline issue‚Äù and Antony has been given a leave of absence following assault allegations against him. ‚ÄúOne thing is true, I think from the start last season I think I almost never started with the best starting XI ‚Äì there was always something like injury,‚Äù Ten Hag said. ‚ÄúBut you have to deal with it and I think we always got the results in apart from the period where we are in now. ‚ÄúThat is football and I have the experience in the past, I managed it in the past. It‚Äôs not always going up and you have to deal with it. ‚ÄúI like these situations because now we have to handle it and we have to manage this. You have to know what to do and that is focusing on the process.‚Äù Ten Hag‚Äôs belief about their path is why he is not getting thrown off kilter by the negativity heading into United‚Äôs first Champions League match in 18 months. ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt feel that we need a reset,‚Äù the former Bayern Munich reserve boss said. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. ‚ÄúWe are in a process and what you see is that in parts of games we play very good but then also in parts of games we played below our levels. ‚ÄúWhat we have to demand is be consistent, so we have to step up in certain levels all the time for 90-plus minutes. That is the demand on us.‚Äù Wednesday certainly looks a tough ask for United, who will face England captain Harry Kane after he joined Bayern following a summer of speculation.

Eddie Howe‚Äôs Newcastle will be the happier of the two sides to earn a point from the Group F clash at the San Siro after being on the back foot for the vast majority of the match. Milan should have won after wasting a string of chances, particularly in the first half, and dominating the play on Sandro Tonali‚Äôs return to his old stomping ground after being sold to Newcastle in July. Milan sit top of a tough group before Paris Saint-Germain host Borussia Dortmund at the Parc des Princes later on Tuesday, level with their Premier League opposition. Newcastle did little in their first match in Europe‚Äôs top club competition since 2003, the Saudi Arabia-backed team barely creating a chance and lucky to escape with a draw on the balance of play. Tonali‚Äôs father was at the San Siro and saw much more football played by the hosts than by his son, back in the Newcastle starting line-up after missing international duty with injury. The Italy midfielder was loudly cheered by home supporters who don‚Äôt resent his mega-money move to England before kick-off. But home fans, who watched their team be thumped 5-1 by local rivals Inter Milan on Saturday, were left frustrated by their team‚Äôs poor finishing and Newcastle‚Äôs dogged defending which left the match goalless.

United‚Äôs 3-1 meek home loss to Brighton is hardly the best preparation to face Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Wednesday, nor are the injury problems that continue to pile up. The Red Devils have lost Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire since the weekend, joining the likes of Raphael Varane, Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia on the sidelines. ‚ÄúYes, of course it‚Äôs a concern,‚Äù Ten Hag said of the spate of injuries that leaves him with a 21-man squad in Germany featuring four goalkeepers. ‚ÄúBut we knew that before and that‚Äôs why we constructed the squad with depth, so we can deal with it, the squad can deal with it.‚Äù Asked whether he can speak to the medical staff about the injury situation, the United boss said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if we have to go to the doctors or physios because they are dealing with the problems. ‚ÄúFirst of all, injuries always come in top football because we‚Äôre living on the edge. ‚ÄúOf course we analyse why things happen, but we also have to deal with the facts and it‚Äôs always about the players available. Testing out the new ball üëå ‚Äî Manchester United (@ManUtd) ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a strong side we can line up and we have to get the best out of it and we‚Äôre focusing on that. ‚ÄúTo bring up tomorrow again, a good team, make the next step, integrate Rasmus Hojlund, (Sergio) Reguilon), two new players and we are here to get a result.‚Äù Sofyan Amrabat, Kobbie Mainoo and Amad Diallo are others out of the Group A opener through injury, while Donny van de Beek is unavailable having been left out of United‚Äôs Champions League squad. Beyond that, Jadon Sancho remains absent ‚Äúpending resolution of a squad discipline issue‚Äù and Antony has been given a leave of absence following assault allegations against him. ‚ÄúOne thing is true, I think from the start last season I think I almost never started with the best starting XI ‚Äì there was always something like injury,‚Äù Ten Hag said. ‚ÄúBut you have to deal with it and I think we always got the results in apart from the period where we are in now. ‚ÄúThat is football and I have the experience in the past, I managed it in the past. It‚Äôs not always going up and you have to deal with it. ‚ÄúI like these situations because now we have to handle it and we have to manage this. You have to know what to do and that is focusing on the process.‚Äù Ten Hag‚Äôs belief about their path is why he is not getting thrown off kilter by the negativity heading into United‚Äôs first Champions League match in 18 months. ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt feel that we need a reset,‚Äù the former Bayern Munich reserve boss said. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. ‚ÄúWe are in a process and what you see is that in parts of games we play very good but then also in parts of games we played below our levels. ‚ÄúWhat we have to demand is be consistent, so we have to step up in certain levels all the time for 90-plus minutes. That is the demand on us.‚Äù Wednesday certainly looks a tough ask for United, who will face England captain Harry Kane after he joined Bayern following a summer of speculation.

Eddie Howe‚Äôs Newcastle will be the happier of the two sides to earn a point from the Group F clash at the San Siro after being on the back foot for the vast majority of the match. Milan should have won after wasting a string of chances, particularly in the first half, and dominating the play on Sandro Tonali‚Äôs return to his old stomping ground after being sold to Newcastle in July. Milan sit top of a tough group before Paris Saint-Germain host Borussia Dortmund at the Parc des Princes later on Tuesday, level with their Premier League opposition. Newcastle did little in their first match in Europe‚Äôs top club competition since 2003, the Saudi Arabia-backed team barely creating a chance and lucky to escape with a draw on the balance of play. Tonali‚Äôs father was at the San Siro and saw much more football played by the hosts than by his son, back in the Newcastle starting line-up after missing international duty with injury. The Italy midfielder was loudly cheered by home supporters who don‚Äôt resent his mega-money move to England before kick-off. But home fans, who watched their team be thumped 5-1 by local rivals Inter Milan on Saturday, were left frustrated by their team‚Äôs poor finishing and Newcastle‚Äôs dogged defending which left the match goalless.
