In front of an announced attendance of 27,579 at Mosaic Stadium, the Riders lost their fifth straight game and didn’t put up much of a fight, getting beat 38-13 in Week 18 of the CFL season. The loss drops Saskatchewan to 6-10 in the CFL’s West Division, while the Ti-Cats improve to 8-8. “Very disappointed,” said Dickenson, head coach of the Riders, after the game. “I’m embarrassed. I feel like that’s embarrassing when you lose like that, at home, when you’ve got so much to play for. “I didn’t say a lot to (the team), but I did tell them we’re going to come back and go to work because that’s what we do.” On a night that the Roughriders honoured legendary running back George Reed , recognized the Plaza of Honour Class of 2023 including builder Wendy Kelly and the 2013 Grey Cup championship team , plus all that is at stake with the current West Division playoff race, Dickenson expected a much better effort from his team. “I did not see that coming at all,” said Dickenson. “I told the team in there, I said ‘I don’t have a lot of words for you because never in a million years did I think we’d go out there with all the things that we have to play for — playoffs, honouring George Reed and his family, the ‘13 team and just the intrinsic motivation of going out there and doing what we love to do — I just did not see that coming.’ “Tough loss; probably the low point in my time here. I’m shocked by it and I don’t have a lot of things to say other than we’re just going to roll up our sleeves and try to get back to work and find a way to try and win one game against Calgary.” Saskatchewan, who still occupies the third place in the West Division, will now get set for a pivotal matchup on Oct. 13 against the 4-11 Calgary Stampeders. The Riders enter the game four points up on Calgary for the final playoff spot, with the game also deciding the season series — and ultimately standings tiebreaker — between the two teams. “We’ve lost our confidence and we’ve lost a little bit of our mojo,” said Dickenson. “(But) I don’t think it’s too late. Fortunately, we still have a chance, but if we don’t play better than that, we’ll be one-and-done even if you get in (to the playoffs). “We’re not physical enough, that’s for sure … And I know they’re putting their bodies on the line and they’re giving it their best, but our best is not good enough right now.” In the first half alone on Saturday, the visiting Ti-Cats put up 346 yards of net offence, leading 25-9 lead through 30 minutes. Hamilton ended up with 546 net yards to 307 by Saskatchewan Bo Levi Mitchell started at quarterback for Hamilton in his first game action since a leg injury on July 28. And the veteran pivot picked apart the Riders defence in the first quarter, connecting on an 88-yard pass to Tim White before finding Omar Bayless for a 10-yard touchdown as Hamilton led 7-0 early. After the Ti-Cats gave up a safety to make it 7-2, the Riders proceeded to get into field goal range, before an unsuccessful third-down gamble resulted in a turnover on downs. With Hamilton taking Mitchell out of the game, due to workload management after the QB completed 4-of-6 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown, second-string QB Matthew Shiltz entered the game and wasted no time scoring. Shiltz — who finished the night 16-of-19 for 271 yards and two touchdowns — threw his first TD to Bayless to make it 14-2. On his next drive, Shiltz connected with Sean Thomas Erlington for another major to make it 22-2. After Hamilton added a field goal, the Riders’ offence scored their first points of the night as running back Jamal Morrow scampered into the end zone from 32 yards out to make it 25-9 at the the half. In the third quarter, the teams traded field goals to make it 28-13. Hamilton then added another field goal to go up 31-13 early in the fourth quarter. After Dolegala fumbled the ball on Saskatchewan’s ninth drive of the game, backup quarterback Mason Fine entered the game for the Riders with nine minutes to go in the game. However, Fine was ineffective as well, turning it over on downs on his first drive and throwing an interception on his second. Hamilton added a late touchdown to make it a 38-13 final. “Wasn’t good enough across the board,” said Dolegala, who went 16-of-25 for 154 yards. “Just couldn’t really do anything. “It was not a good showing whatsoever.” The Riders will now need a much better effort next week in Calgary, as a win would drastically increase their chances at a playoff berth. “We’ve got to play better, there’s no other way around it,” said defensive lineman Pete Robertson. “The biggest thing is guys have got to come out and play with heart. “We’ve got to go out and legitimately make a statement. I think we know as a team that we haven’t played our best ball and we can look at each other in the eyes and we can tell we’re not playing our best ball and we’ve got to pull it together.” tshire@postmedia.com Share this Story : ‘Probably the low point in my time here’: Roughriders lose 38-13 to Tiger-Cats for fifth straight defeat Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr","pubDate":"2023-10-08 03:36:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"leaderpost","source_priority":72082,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4c8a8bdf053cb8e9750b1c93c2160466","title":"Korea beats Japan to win Asian Games soccer gold once again","link":"https://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/10/829_360666.html?utm_source=fl","keywords":null,"creator":["webmaster@koreatimes.co.kr(KoreaTimes)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Korea defeated Japan 2-1 to win gold at the Asian Games, Saturday, a third straight triumph in the men’s tournament.

Yonhap By John Duerden Korea defeated Japan 2-1 to win gold at the Asian Games, Saturday, a third straight triumph in the men’s tournament. It wasn’t smooth sailing but the young Taeguk Warriors have won all seven matches in Hangzhou and the celebrations at the final whistle were heartfelt and very much deserved. As everyone knows, this U-23 tournament in which teams are also allowed to select three players of any age, is not just about the medal but what it means. The South Korean government grants all male athletes who win gold at the Asian Games ? any medal at the Olympics will do ? exemption from the 18 to 21 months of military service that they must start by the age of 28. It means that the likes of Lee Kang-in, a talented midfielder who signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, does not need to cut short his European career and return home in a few years time for military service. Just look at what happened in the past with Son Heung-min and Kim Min-jae. They won gold in 2018 and are now playing at Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich respectively. The next generation of stars in the country are now free to go wherever they want. Lee is just 22 and has a very bright future at the top levels of European soccer and now, he has a decade or more to look forward to, should he desire it. PSG midfielder Lee Kang-in among prominent athletes to receive military service exemption 2023-10-08 08:20 | Hangzhou Asian Games That was looking uncertain after 90 seconds in China as Kotaro Uchino put Japan ahead with a shot high into the net from close range within the first 90 seconds. It was a surprise. While Korea uses the best players it possibly can as the only thing that matters is winning gold, Japan is able to treat the Asian Games as purely a developmental event, giving talented youngsters a chance to experience a competitive tournament. Jeong Woo-yeong of South Korea scores a header against Japan during the Asian Games men's football gold medal match at the Huanglong Sports Centre Stadium in Hangzhou, China, Oct. 7. Yonhap Not so for Korea. The equalizing goal came just before the half-hour and it was scored by Jeong Woo-yeong, the top scorer of the tournament. The Stuttgart midfielder netted his eighth with a perfect header that flew into the top corner of the Japanese net. The second came early in the second half. The ball fell to Cho Young-wook inside the area and he kept his cool to slot it home. Hwang Sun-hong’s men pushed for a third, something to give them a cushion as the game entered its final stages. It didn’t come but Korea always looked the more likely to score. In the end, the extra goal was not needed. Few would argue that Korea is not a deserved winner. The team has scored 27 goals throughout and conceded just three. While everything is done to field the best team possible, the pressure that the players are under is quite something. Now they are free to enjoy the achievement, enjoy the feeling of a gold medal around their necks and enjoy the feeling that anything can happen in the next few years.

Yonhap For Korean male athletes, winning an Asian Games gold medal comes with an added bonus: an exemption from mandatory military service. It's often a touchy and divisive issue in Korea, and prominent professional athletes receive the bulk of the spotlight, for one reason or another. For the Korean men's Asiad football team, which beat Japan 2-1 for the gold medal in China on Saturday night, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) midfielder Lee Kang-in is easily the biggest name among those getting an exemption. It comes at an opportune time in Lee's career, too. The 22-year-old signed a lucrative deal with the French champions this summer, and the military service exemption will set him on a path to an uninterrupted career in France or perhaps elsewhere in Europe down the road. Korea beats Japan to win Asian Games soccer gold once again 2023-10-08 00:05 | Hangzhou Asian Games This was the gamble that PSG were willing to take. Because the Asian Games aren't part of the FIFA international calendar, clubs are under no obligation to release their players. However, Lee convinced PSG to let him play for the country in the middle of their club season and even put that into his contract. PSG only let him leave after he played in a UEFA Champions League group stage match soon after the Asian Games tournament kicked off, and Lee didn't join Korea until the third and final group stage match. And he never once played a full 90 minutes. Lee, who missed some time from late August to early September with a left quadriceps injury, wasn't close to being Korea's best player on their run to the gold medal. That distinction belongs to Jeong Woo-yeong, midfielder for the Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart who led the Asian Games tournament with eight goals in seven matches. Jeong scored a brace in the semifinals against Uzbekistan and netted the equalizer against Japan to key Korea's rally. Though not nearly as beloved as Lee by Korean fans, Jeong, 24, is another talented young attacking player who will now be able to enjoy a potentially long club career. Before Lee and Jeong came the likes of Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min and Bayern Munich defender Kim Min-jae, who earned their military service exemptions with their 2018 Asian Games gold medals. Both players have established themselves as among the best in Europe, something Lee and Jeong will now try to do as they enter their prime years. Korea head coach Hwang Sun-hong said the gold medal would have a positive impact on Lee's career in the long run. \"He's playing for a great club, and I think he has to keep improving,\" Hwang said. \"And this exemption will help him continue on that career path. And I also think he has to keep playing hard for the country. It's important for him to play his best when wearing the national flag on his chest. And since he's playing well for a big club, I expect him to have a major influence on the development of Korean football.\" (Yonhap)","pubDate":"2023-10-08 03:35:05","image_url":"http://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/b8c745c5f61845348a8b9797a71656e4.jpg","source_id":"koreatimes","source_priority":35310,"country":["south korea"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1bfa745d8c7343f44dc19b0408e0dcc8","title":"Okocha, Maicon, Mboma, 147 other legends to feature in inaugural Veterans World Cup","link":"https://guardian.ng/sport/okocha-maicon-mboma-147-other-legends-to-feature-in-inaugural-veterans-world-cup/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha","Douglas Maicon","Patrice Mboma","Veterans World Cup"],"creator":["Guardian Nigeria"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Super Eagles Captain, Austin Jay Jay Okocha, Brazil legend, Douglas Maicon and retired Cameroun great, Patrice Mboma, are among former stars from across the world billed to feature in the inaugural Veteran Clubs World Cup (VCWC) slated to hold in Kigali, Rwanda, next year.

According to the organisers of the competition, the maiden VCWC will feature players from all the regions of the world, including women legends, who will take part in the football competition and also economic forums. Some of the players already listed for the competition, the organisers said, are Charmaine Hooper, Robert Pires, Gaizka Mendieta, Wael Gomaa, Jimmy Gatete, Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, Anthony Baffoe, Roger Milla and Laura Georges. Others are Lilian Thuram, Sonny Anderson, Louis Saha and Khalilou Fadiga. Teams at the championship will represent East and South Europe, North Africa and Middle East, North and West Europe, West and Central Africa, North and Central America, East and South Africa, South America, as well as Asia and Oceania. Speaking at the media presentation of the championship in Lagos on Friday, Jesse Happy Ndongo of Easy Group, one of the competition’s partners, said the participants at the VCWC would also be part of business expos to hold side by side with the championship. Ndongo said: “The championship will hold at the Amahoro Stadium and two other venues in Kigali. The teams are regional selections that will consider the popularity of the legends and the stories they have to tell, as well as those veterans that have invested in their communities’ development. “The first three editions will hold in Rwanda, but it could move to other zones with time. It is a yearly event that will continually incorporate new legends as they retire from the game.” Apart from football, the other activities to be held at the event, Ndongo said, are a youth expo, multisport competition, which will include tennis challenges and an amateur competition featuring youths from various communities. “The competition will have about 32 women legends because each team is expected to register at least two retired female legends in their squad,” he said.

After signing off with a 2-0 victory over New York City on Saturday night, Rooney told reporters he will not be renewing his contract in the US capital. Talking about his decision to leave, the Manchester United and England legend said: 'It's the right time. I've done everything I can to get this club into the playoffs. It's not a single thing that's happened. It's about timing.' Rooney's DC side is still mathematically in with a chance of reaching the MLS playoffs after the victory over New York City. As things stand, DC is currently holding the final playoff spot in ninth place on 40 points. Chicago currently trails Charlotte 2-0 in one of Saturday night's later fixtures, leaving Frank Klopas's team down in 11th place on goal difference. Wayne Rooney has announced he is leaving DC United upon the expiry of his contract D.C. United and Head Coach Wayne Rooney have mutually agreed to part ways. https://t.co/ykE3Qp2FDb — D.C. United (@dcunited) October 8, 2023 However, both Chicago and New York Red Bulls - in 10th place on 40 points - has one more game to play. Charlotte, projected to close out the evening on 39 points, also has two games-in-hand still to play. New York City, on 38 points in 13th, could also still leapfrog them up into the playoff positions. It means Rooney and DC need all four of their playoff rivals to fail to pick up victories in their final games of the season. DC later released a club statement announcing that Rooney is set to depart via mutual consent. 'We have spoken with Wayne and agreed it is best for us to part ways at this time,' said CEO and co-chairman Jason Levein. 'This decision creates the avenue for our next General Manager to have the full opportunity to impart a new philosophy and structure onto our sporting operations, which begins with the critical identification of a Head Coach who will best align with this. 'We are grateful to Wayne Rooney for all he has done for our club and for soccer in the Nation’s Capital, first as a D.C. United player and captain and most recently as our coach. 'He remains an important part of the D.C. United family and a valued and cherished friend.'

Messi, who was a doubt for this weekend's match in South Florida , entered Saturday night's game in the 55' minute for defender Tomas Aviles in an offensive substitution, with the score still 0-0 at the time. But, roughly 23 minutes later, and Bareal scored off a fine save made by Inter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callendar to gift all three points to Cincinnati - the No. 1 seed of MLS' Eastern Conference. Inter Miami (9-17-6, 33 points) were eliminated from playoff contention due to their loss combined with CF Montreal 's win over the Portland Timbers. Messi, 36, played on Saturday evening for the first time since September 20, after missing two weeks with a reaggravated scar tissue injury in his leg. He could not capitalize on a few chances in Cincinnati's end when came in on as a substitute in the second half.

Up until Saturday night's game, the team had avoided defeat in all 12 of his appearances, only coming unstuck when he was unavailable. FC Cincinnati (20-5-8, 68 points) continued the best season in their young franchise history. They had already clinched the Supporters' Shield for the league's best record in the regular season. Roman Celentano made two saves for Cincinnati. Callender had five saves for Miami. Inter Miami had possession for 61.6 percent of the game, but just two of their 16 shot attempts were on target. Inter Miami controlled play in the first half and hit the woodwork on three separate occasions. Aviles hit the crossbar head-on from the center of the box, Josef Martinez pinged the far post with a shot and Benjamin Cremaschi's close-range shot went off the crossbar before the end of the scoreless first half. When Messi came on, 10 minutes after halftime, he quickly won a free kick in scoring range in the 59th minute, but he sent his attempt well over the crossbar.

Yuya Kubo moved in and fired on Callender, who parried it to his right. But Barreal was charging in on that side and easily deposited it in the net for his fifth goal of the season. In the 87th minute, Messi got a left-footed shot through some traffic, but it dribbled past the net and out of play. Messi drew two late fouls near the box, one in the 90th minute and one in stoppage time. On the first free kick, Messi tried to cross the ball in to a teammate and Cincinnati cleared it, setting up a fruitless Miami corner kick. On the latter, Messi's shot at goal went over the bar again. Miami ends it season as champions of the League Cup, runners-up of the U.S. Open Cup and in 14th place out of 15 in the MLS' Eastern Conference. Only Toronto (4-10-19, 22 points) trail the Herons in the league. Since Messi's July debut, Inter Miami only won one of the six games he missed and only lost one of the 13 he's played in.

The hosts cruised to victory at Audi Field on Saturday night as goals from Mateusz Klich and Chris Durkin either side of halftime were enough to see off the threat of New York. It means that, as things stand, DC is currently holding the final playoff spot in ninth place on 40 points. Chicago currently trails Charlotte 1-0 in one of Saturday night's later fixtures, meaning Frank Klopas's team is currently down in 11th place on goal difference. However, both Chicago and New York Red Bulls - in 10th place on 40 points - has one more game to play. Charlotte, projected to close out the evening on 39 points, also has two games-in-hand still to play. Wayne Rooney potentially bowed out as DC United manager with a 2-0 win over New York City Chris Durkin was on the scoresheet as DC United kept their faint MLS playoff hopes alive With their playoff chances unlikely, Rooney confirmed after the game that he will be leaving DC United once his contract comes to an end. 'It's the right time,' he told reporters. 'I've done everything I can to get this club into the playoffs. It's not a single thing that's happened. It's about timing.' Rooney is potentially waving goodbye to the club on a bittersweet note given it is still not entirely out of the question that his team makes it into the playoffs. Nevertheless, his future as manager was up in the air prior to Saturday's game with the guaranteed portion of his contract in the United States capital set to expire at the end of the season. There is a mutual option to renew until 2024, however the Manchester United and England legend missed training on Friday to all but confirm his time in DC is at an end.

In front of an announced attendance of 27,579 at Mosaic Stadium, the Riders lost their fifth straight game and didn’t put up much of a fight, getting beat 38-13 in Week 18 of the CFL season. The loss drops Saskatchewan to 6-10 in the CFL’s West Division, while the Ti-Cats improve to 8-8. “Very disappointed,” said Dickenson, head coach of the Riders, after the game. “I’m embarrassed. I feel like that’s embarrassing when you lose like that, at home, when you’ve got so much to play for. “I didn’t say a lot to (the team), but I did tell them we’re going to come back and go to work because that’s what we do.” On a night that the Roughriders honoured legendary running back George Reed , recognized the Plaza of Honour Class of 2023 including builder Wendy Kelly and the 2013 Grey Cup championship team , plus all that is at stake with the current West Division playoff race, Dickenson expected a much better effort from his team. “I did not see that coming at all,” said Dickenson. “I told the team in there, I said ‘I don’t have a lot of words for you because never in a million years did I think we’d go out there with all the things that we have to play for — playoffs, honouring George Reed and his family, the ‘13 team and just the intrinsic motivation of going out there and doing what we love to do — I just did not see that coming.’ “Tough loss; probably the low point in my time here. I’m shocked by it and I don’t have a lot of things to say other than we’re just going to roll up our sleeves and try to get back to work and find a way to try and win one game against Calgary.” Saskatchewan, who still occupies the third place in the West Division, will now get set for a pivotal matchup on Oct. 13 against the 4-11 Calgary Stampeders. The Riders enter the game four points up on Calgary for the final playoff spot, with the game also deciding the season series — and ultimately standings tiebreaker — between the two teams. “We’ve lost our confidence and we’ve lost a little bit of our mojo,” said Dickenson. “(But) I don’t think it’s too late. Fortunately, we still have a chance, but if we don’t play better than that, we’ll be one-and-done even if you get in (to the playoffs). “We’re not physical enough, that’s for sure … And I know they’re putting their bodies on the line and they’re giving it their best, but our best is not good enough right now.” In the first half alone on Saturday, the visiting Ti-Cats put up 346 yards of net offence, leading 25-9 lead through 30 minutes. Hamilton ended up with 546 net yards to 307 by Saskatchewan Bo Levi Mitchell started at quarterback for Hamilton in his first game action since a leg injury on July 28. And the veteran pivot picked apart the Riders defence in the first quarter, connecting on an 88-yard pass to Tim White before finding Omar Bayless for a 10-yard touchdown as Hamilton led 7-0 early. After the Ti-Cats gave up a safety to make it 7-2, the Riders proceeded to get into field goal range, before an unsuccessful third-down gamble resulted in a turnover on downs. With Hamilton taking Mitchell out of the game, due to workload management after the QB completed 4-of-6 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown, second-string QB Matthew Shiltz entered the game and wasted no time scoring. Shiltz — who finished the night 16-of-19 for 271 yards and two touchdowns — threw his first TD to Bayless to make it 14-2. On his next drive, Shiltz connected with Sean Thomas Erlington for another major to make it 22-2. After Hamilton added a field goal, the Riders’ offence scored their first points of the night as running back Jamal Morrow scampered into the end zone from 32 yards out to make it 25-9 at the the half. In the third quarter, the teams traded field goals to make it 28-13. Hamilton then added another field goal to go up 31-13 early in the fourth quarter. After Dolegala fumbled the ball on Saskatchewan’s ninth drive of the game, backup quarterback Mason Fine entered the game for the Riders with nine minutes to go in the game. However, Fine was ineffective as well, turning it over on downs on his first drive and throwing an interception on his second. Hamilton added a late touchdown to make it a 38-13 final. “Wasn’t good enough across the board,” said Dolegala, who went 16-of-25 for 154 yards. “Just couldn’t really do anything. “It was not a good showing whatsoever.” The Riders will now need a much better effort next week in Calgary, as a win would drastically increase their chances at a playoff berth. “We’ve got to play better, there’s no other way around it,” said defensive lineman Pete Robertson. “The biggest thing is guys have got to come out and play with heart. “We’ve got to go out and legitimately make a statement. I think we know as a team that we haven’t played our best ball and we can look at each other in the eyes and we can tell we’re not playing our best ball and we’ve got to pull it together.” tshire@postmedia.com Share this Story : ‘Probably the low point in my time here’: Roughriders lose 38-13 to Tiger-Cats for fifth straight defeat Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr","pubDate":"2023-10-08 03:36:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"leaderpost","source_priority":72082,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4c8a8bdf053cb8e9750b1c93c2160466","title":"Korea beats Japan to win Asian Games soccer gold once again","link":"https://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/10/829_360666.html?utm_source=fl","keywords":null,"creator":["webmaster@koreatimes.co.kr(KoreaTimes)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Korea defeated Japan 2-1 to win gold at the Asian Games, Saturday, a third straight triumph in the men’s tournament.

Yonhap By John Duerden Korea defeated Japan 2-1 to win gold at the Asian Games, Saturday, a third straight triumph in the men’s tournament. It wasn’t smooth sailing but the young Taeguk Warriors have won all seven matches in Hangzhou and the celebrations at the final whistle were heartfelt and very much deserved. As everyone knows, this U-23 tournament in which teams are also allowed to select three players of any age, is not just about the medal but what it means. The South Korean government grants all male athletes who win gold at the Asian Games ? any medal at the Olympics will do ? exemption from the 18 to 21 months of military service that they must start by the age of 28. It means that the likes of Lee Kang-in, a talented midfielder who signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, does not need to cut short his European career and return home in a few years time for military service. Just look at what happened in the past with Son Heung-min and Kim Min-jae. They won gold in 2018 and are now playing at Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich respectively. The next generation of stars in the country are now free to go wherever they want. Lee is just 22 and has a very bright future at the top levels of European soccer and now, he has a decade or more to look forward to, should he desire it. PSG midfielder Lee Kang-in among prominent athletes to receive military service exemption 2023-10-08 08:20 | Hangzhou Asian Games That was looking uncertain after 90 seconds in China as Kotaro Uchino put Japan ahead with a shot high into the net from close range within the first 90 seconds. It was a surprise. While Korea uses the best players it possibly can as the only thing that matters is winning gold, Japan is able to treat the Asian Games as purely a developmental event, giving talented youngsters a chance to experience a competitive tournament. Jeong Woo-yeong of South Korea scores a header against Japan during the Asian Games men's football gold medal match at the Huanglong Sports Centre Stadium in Hangzhou, China, Oct. 7. Yonhap Not so for Korea. The equalizing goal came just before the half-hour and it was scored by Jeong Woo-yeong, the top scorer of the tournament. The Stuttgart midfielder netted his eighth with a perfect header that flew into the top corner of the Japanese net. The second came early in the second half. The ball fell to Cho Young-wook inside the area and he kept his cool to slot it home. Hwang Sun-hong’s men pushed for a third, something to give them a cushion as the game entered its final stages. It didn’t come but Korea always looked the more likely to score. In the end, the extra goal was not needed. Few would argue that Korea is not a deserved winner. The team has scored 27 goals throughout and conceded just three. While everything is done to field the best team possible, the pressure that the players are under is quite something. Now they are free to enjoy the achievement, enjoy the feeling of a gold medal around their necks and enjoy the feeling that anything can happen in the next few years.

Yonhap For Korean male athletes, winning an Asian Games gold medal comes with an added bonus: an exemption from mandatory military service. It's often a touchy and divisive issue in Korea, and prominent professional athletes receive the bulk of the spotlight, for one reason or another. For the Korean men's Asiad football team, which beat Japan 2-1 for the gold medal in China on Saturday night, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) midfielder Lee Kang-in is easily the biggest name among those getting an exemption. It comes at an opportune time in Lee's career, too. The 22-year-old signed a lucrative deal with the French champions this summer, and the military service exemption will set him on a path to an uninterrupted career in France or perhaps elsewhere in Europe down the road. Korea beats Japan to win Asian Games soccer gold once again 2023-10-08 00:05 | Hangzhou Asian Games This was the gamble that PSG were willing to take. Because the Asian Games aren't part of the FIFA international calendar, clubs are under no obligation to release their players. However, Lee convinced PSG to let him play for the country in the middle of their club season and even put that into his contract. PSG only let him leave after he played in a UEFA Champions League group stage match soon after the Asian Games tournament kicked off, and Lee didn't join Korea until the third and final group stage match. And he never once played a full 90 minutes. Lee, who missed some time from late August to early September with a left quadriceps injury, wasn't close to being Korea's best player on their run to the gold medal. That distinction belongs to Jeong Woo-yeong, midfielder for the Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart who led the Asian Games tournament with eight goals in seven matches. Jeong scored a brace in the semifinals against Uzbekistan and netted the equalizer against Japan to key Korea's rally. Though not nearly as beloved as Lee by Korean fans, Jeong, 24, is another talented young attacking player who will now be able to enjoy a potentially long club career. Before Lee and Jeong came the likes of Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min and Bayern Munich defender Kim Min-jae, who earned their military service exemptions with their 2018 Asian Games gold medals. Both players have established themselves as among the best in Europe, something Lee and Jeong will now try to do as they enter their prime years. Korea head coach Hwang Sun-hong said the gold medal would have a positive impact on Lee's career in the long run. \"He's playing for a great club, and I think he has to keep improving,\" Hwang said. \"And this exemption will help him continue on that career path. And I also think he has to keep playing hard for the country. It's important for him to play his best when wearing the national flag on his chest. And since he's playing well for a big club, I expect him to have a major influence on the development of Korean football.\" (Yonhap)","pubDate":"2023-10-08 03:35:05","image_url":"http://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/b8c745c5f61845348a8b9797a71656e4.jpg","source_id":"koreatimes","source_priority":35310,"country":["south korea"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1bfa745d8c7343f44dc19b0408e0dcc8","title":"Okocha, Maicon, Mboma, 147 other legends to feature in inaugural Veterans World Cup","link":"https://guardian.ng/sport/okocha-maicon-mboma-147-other-legends-to-feature-in-inaugural-veterans-world-cup/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha","Douglas Maicon","Patrice Mboma","Veterans World Cup"],"creator":["Guardian Nigeria"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Super Eagles Captain, Austin Jay Jay Okocha, Brazil legend, Douglas Maicon and retired Cameroun great, Patrice Mboma, are among former stars from across the world billed to feature in the inaugural Veteran Clubs World Cup (VCWC) slated to hold in Kigali, Rwanda, next year.

According to the organisers of the competition, the maiden VCWC will feature players from all the regions of the world, including women legends, who will take part in the football competition and also economic forums. Some of the players already listed for the competition, the organisers said, are Charmaine Hooper, Robert Pires, Gaizka Mendieta, Wael Gomaa, Jimmy Gatete, Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, Anthony Baffoe, Roger Milla and Laura Georges. Others are Lilian Thuram, Sonny Anderson, Louis Saha and Khalilou Fadiga. Teams at the championship will represent East and South Europe, North Africa and Middle East, North and West Europe, West and Central Africa, North and Central America, East and South Africa, South America, as well as Asia and Oceania. Speaking at the media presentation of the championship in Lagos on Friday, Jesse Happy Ndongo of Easy Group, one of the competition’s partners, said the participants at the VCWC would also be part of business expos to hold side by side with the championship. Ndongo said: “The championship will hold at the Amahoro Stadium and two other venues in Kigali. The teams are regional selections that will consider the popularity of the legends and the stories they have to tell, as well as those veterans that have invested in their communities’ development. “The first three editions will hold in Rwanda, but it could move to other zones with time. It is a yearly event that will continually incorporate new legends as they retire from the game.” Apart from football, the other activities to be held at the event, Ndongo said, are a youth expo, multisport competition, which will include tennis challenges and an amateur competition featuring youths from various communities. “The competition will have about 32 women legends because each team is expected to register at least two retired female legends in their squad,” he said.

After signing off with a 2-0 victory over New York City on Saturday night, Rooney told reporters he will not be renewing his contract in the US capital. Talking about his decision to leave, the Manchester United and England legend said: 'It's the right time. I've done everything I can to get this club into the playoffs. It's not a single thing that's happened. It's about timing.' Rooney's DC side is still mathematically in with a chance of reaching the MLS playoffs after the victory over New York City. As things stand, DC is currently holding the final playoff spot in ninth place on 40 points. Chicago currently trails Charlotte 2-0 in one of Saturday night's later fixtures, leaving Frank Klopas's team down in 11th place on goal difference.

Charlotte, projected to close out the evening on 39 points, also has two games-in-hand still to play. New York City, on 38 points in 13th, could also still leapfrog them up into the playoff positions. It means Rooney and DC need all four of their playoff rivals to fail to pick up victories in their final games of the season. DC later released a club statement announcing that Rooney is set to depart via mutual consent. 'We have spoken with Wayne and agreed it is best for us to part ways at this time,' said CEO and co-chairman Jason Levein. 'This decision creates the avenue for our next General Manager to have the full opportunity to impart a new philosophy and structure onto our sporting operations, which begins with the critical identification of a Head Coach who will best align with this. 'We are grateful to Wayne Rooney for all he has done for our club and for soccer in the Nation’s Capital, first as a D.C. United player and captain and most recently as our coach. 'He remains an important part of the D.C. United family and a valued and cherished friend.'

Messi, who was a doubt for this weekend's match in South Florida , entered Saturday night's game in the 55' minute for defender Tomas Aviles in an offensive substitution, with the score still 0-0 at the time. But, roughly 23 minutes later, and Bareal scored off a fine save made by Inter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callendar to gift all three points to Cincinnati - the No. 1 seed of MLS' Eastern Conference. Inter Miami (9-17-6, 33 points) were eliminated from playoff contention due to their loss combined with CF Montreal 's win over the Portland Timbers. Messi, 36, played on Saturday evening for the first time since September 20, after missing two weeks with a reaggravated scar tissue injury in his leg. He could not capitalize on a few chances in Cincinnati's end when came in on as a substitute in the second half.

Up until Saturday night's game, the team had avoided defeat in all 12 of his appearances, only coming unstuck when he was unavailable. FC Cincinnati (20-5-8, 68 points) continued the best season in their young franchise history. They had already clinched the Supporters' Shield for the league's best record in the regular season. Roman Celentano made two saves for Cincinnati. Callender had five saves for Miami. Inter Miami had possession for 61.6 percent of the game, but just two of their 16 shot attempts were on target. Inter Miami controlled play in the first half and hit the woodwork on three separate occasions. Aviles hit the crossbar head-on from the center of the box, Josef Martinez pinged the far post with a shot and Benjamin Cremaschi's close-range shot went off the crossbar before the end of the scoreless first half. When Messi came on, 10 minutes after halftime, he quickly won a free kick in scoring range in the 59th minute, but he sent his attempt well over the crossbar.

Yuya Kubo moved in and fired on Callender, who parried it to his right. But Barreal was charging in on that side and easily deposited it in the net for his fifth goal of the season. In the 87th minute, Messi got a left-footed shot through some traffic, but it dribbled past the net and out of play. Messi drew two late fouls near the box, one in the 90th minute and one in stoppage time. On the first free kick, Messi tried to cross the ball in to a teammate and Cincinnati cleared it, setting up a fruitless Miami corner kick. On the latter, Messi's shot at goal went over the bar again. Miami ends it season as champions of the League Cup, runners-up of the U.S. Open Cup and in 14th place out of 15 in the MLS' Eastern Conference. Only Toronto (4-10-19, 22 points) trail the Herons in the league. Since Messi's July debut, Inter Miami only won one of the six games he missed and only lost one of the 13 he's played in.

The hosts cruised to victory at Audi Field on Saturday night as goals from Mateusz Klich and Chris Durkin either side of halftime were enough to see off the threat of New York. It means that, as things stand, DC is currently holding the final playoff spot in ninth place on 40 points. Chicago currently trails Charlotte 1-0 in one of Saturday night's later fixtures, meaning Frank Klopas's team is currently down in 11th place on goal difference.

Wayne Rooney potentially bowed out as DC United manager with a 2-0 win over New York City Chris Durkin was on the scoresheet as DC United kept their faint MLS playoff hopes alive With their playoff chances unlikely, Rooney confirmed after the game that he will be leaving DC United once his contract comes to an end. 'It's the right time,' he told reporters. 'I've done everything I can to get this club into the playoffs. It's not a single thing that's happened. It's about timing.' Rooney is potentially waving goodbye to the club on a bittersweet note given it is still not entirely out of the question that his team makes it into the playoffs. Nevertheless, his future as manager was up in the air prior to Saturday's game with the guaranteed portion of his contract in the United States capital set to expire at the end of the season. There is a mutual option to renew until 2024, however the Manchester United and England legend missed training on Friday to all but confirm his time in DC is at an end.

In front of an announced attendance of 27,579 at Mosaic Stadium, the Riders lost their fifth straight game and didn’t put up much of a fight, getting beat 38-13 in Week 18 of the CFL season. The loss drops Saskatchewan to 6-10 in the CFL’s West Division, while the Ti-Cats improve to 8-8. “Very disappointed,” said Dickenson, head coach of the Riders, after the game. “I’m embarrassed. I feel like that’s embarrassing when you lose like that, at home, when you’ve got so much to play for. “I didn’t say a lot to (the team), but I did tell them we’re going to come back and go to work because that’s what we do.” On a night that the Roughriders honoured legendary running back George Reed , recognized the Plaza of Honour Class of 2023 including builder Wendy Kelly and the 2013 Grey Cup championship team , plus all that is at stake with the current West Division playoff race, Dickenson expected a much better effort from his team. “I did not see that coming at all,” said Dickenson. “I told the team in there, I said ‘I don’t have a lot of words for you because never in a million years did I think we’d go out there with all the things that we have to play for — playoffs, honouring George Reed and his family, the ‘13 team and just the intrinsic motivation of going out there and doing what we love to do — I just did not see that coming.’ “Tough loss; probably the low point in my time here. I’m shocked by it and I don’t have a lot of things to say other than we’re just going to roll up our sleeves and try to get back to work and find a way to try and win one game against Calgary.” Saskatchewan, who still occupies the third place in the West Division, will now get set for a pivotal matchup on Oct. 13 against the 4-11 Calgary Stampeders. The Riders enter the game four points up on Calgary for the final playoff spot, with the game also deciding the season series — and ultimately standings tiebreaker — between the two teams. “We’ve lost our confidence and we’ve lost a little bit of our mojo,” said Dickenson. “(But) I don’t think it’s too late. Fortunately, we still have a chance, but if we don’t play better than that, we’ll be one-and-done even if you get in (to the playoffs). “We’re not physical enough, that’s for sure … And I know they’re putting their bodies on the line and they’re giving it their best, but our best is not good enough right now.” In the first half alone on Saturday, the visiting Ti-Cats put up 346 yards of net offence, leading 25-9 lead through 30 minutes. Hamilton ended up with 546 net yards to 307 by Saskatchewan Bo Levi Mitchell started at quarterback for Hamilton in his first game action since a leg injury on July 28. And the veteran pivot picked apart the Riders defence in the first quarter, connecting on an 88-yard pass to Tim White before finding Omar Bayless for a 10-yard touchdown as Hamilton led 7-0 early. After the Ti-Cats gave up a safety to make it 7-2, the Riders proceeded to get into field goal range, before an unsuccessful third-down gamble resulted in a turnover on downs. With Hamilton taking Mitchell out of the game, due to workload management after the QB completed 4-of-6 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown, second-string QB Matthew Shiltz entered the game and wasted no time scoring. Shiltz — who finished the night 16-of-19 for 271 yards and two touchdowns — threw his first TD to Bayless to make it 14-2. On his next drive, Shiltz connected with Sean Thomas Erlington for another major to make it 22-2. After Hamilton added a field goal, the Riders’ offence scored their first points of the night as running back Jamal Morrow scampered into the end zone from 32 yards out to make it 25-9 at the the half. In the third quarter, the teams traded field goals to make it 28-13. Hamilton then added another field goal to go up 31-13 early in the fourth quarter. After Dolegala fumbled the ball on Saskatchewan’s ninth drive of the game, backup quarterback Mason Fine entered the game for the Riders with nine minutes to go in the game. However, Fine was ineffective as well, turning it over on downs on his first drive and throwing an interception on his second. Hamilton added a late touchdown to make it a 38-13 final. “Wasn’t good enough across the board,” said Dolegala, who went 16-of-25 for 154 yards. “Just couldn’t really do anything. “It was not a good showing whatsoever.” The Riders will now need a much better effort next week in Calgary, as a win would drastically increase their chances at a playoff berth. “We’ve got to play better, there’s no other way around it,” said defensive lineman Pete Robertson. “The biggest thing is guys have got to come out and play with heart. “We’ve got to go out and legitimately make a statement. I think we know as a team that we haven’t played our best ball and we can look at each other in the eyes and we can tell we’re not playing our best ball and we’ve got to pull it together.” tshire@postmedia.com Share this Story : ‘Probably the low point in my time here’: Roughriders lose 38-13 to Tiger-Cats for fifth straight defeat Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr","pubDate":"2023-10-08 03:36:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"leaderpost","source_priority":72082,"country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4c8a8bdf053cb8e9750b1c93c2160466","title":"Korea beats Japan to win Asian Games soccer gold once again","link":"https://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/10/829_360666.html?utm_source=fl","keywords":null,"creator":["webmaster@koreatimes.co.kr(KoreaTimes)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Korea defeated Japan 2-1 to win gold at the Asian Games, Saturday, a third straight triumph in the men’s tournament.

Yonhap By John Duerden Korea defeated Japan 2-1 to win gold at the Asian Games, Saturday, a third straight triumph in the men’s tournament. It wasn’t smooth sailing but the young Taeguk Warriors have won all seven matches in Hangzhou and the celebrations at the final whistle were heartfelt and very much deserved. As everyone knows, this U-23 tournament in which teams are also allowed to select three players of any age, is not just about the medal but what it means. The South Korean government grants all male athletes who win gold at the Asian Games ? any medal at the Olympics will do ? exemption from the 18 to 21 months of military service that they must start by the age of 28. It means that the likes of Lee Kang-in, a talented midfielder who signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, does not need to cut short his European career and return home in a few years time for military service. Just look at what happened in the past with Son Heung-min and Kim Min-jae. They won gold in 2018 and are now playing at Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich respectively. The next generation of stars in the country are now free to go wherever they want. Lee is just 22 and has a very bright future at the top levels of European soccer and now, he has a decade or more to look forward to, should he desire it. PSG midfielder Lee Kang-in among prominent athletes to receive military service exemption 2023-10-08 08:20 | Hangzhou Asian Games That was looking uncertain after 90 seconds in China as Kotaro Uchino put Japan ahead with a shot high into the net from close range within the first 90 seconds. It was a surprise. While Korea uses the best players it possibly can as the only thing that matters is winning gold, Japan is able to treat the Asian Games as purely a developmental event, giving talented youngsters a chance to experience a competitive tournament. Jeong Woo-yeong of South Korea scores a header against Japan during the Asian Games men's football gold medal match at the Huanglong Sports Centre Stadium in Hangzhou, China, Oct. 7. Yonhap Not so for Korea. The equalizing goal came just before the half-hour and it was scored by Jeong Woo-yeong, the top scorer of the tournament. The Stuttgart midfielder netted his eighth with a perfect header that flew into the top corner of the Japanese net. The second came early in the second half. The ball fell to Cho Young-wook inside the area and he kept his cool to slot it home. Hwang Sun-hong’s men pushed for a third, something to give them a cushion as the game entered its final stages. It didn’t come but Korea always looked the more likely to score. In the end, the extra goal was not needed. Few would argue that Korea is not a deserved winner. The team has scored 27 goals throughout and conceded just three. While everything is done to field the best team possible, the pressure that the players are under is quite something. Now they are free to enjoy the achievement, enjoy the feeling of a gold medal around their necks and enjoy the feeling that anything can happen in the next few years.

Yonhap For Korean male athletes, winning an Asian Games gold medal comes with an added bonus: an exemption from mandatory military service. It's often a touchy and divisive issue in Korea, and prominent professional athletes receive the bulk of the spotlight, for one reason or another. For the Korean men's Asiad football team, which beat Japan 2-1 for the gold medal in China on Saturday night, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) midfielder Lee Kang-in is easily the biggest name among those getting an exemption. It comes at an opportune time in Lee's career, too. The 22-year-old signed a lucrative deal with the French champions this summer, and the military service exemption will set him on a path to an uninterrupted career in France or perhaps elsewhere in Europe down the road. Korea beats Japan to win Asian Games soccer gold once again 2023-10-08 00:05 | Hangzhou Asian Games This was the gamble that PSG were willing to take. Because the Asian Games aren't part of the FIFA international calendar, clubs are under no obligation to release their players. However, Lee convinced PSG to let him play for the country in the middle of their club season and even put that into his contract. PSG only let him leave after he played in a UEFA Champions League group stage match soon after the Asian Games tournament kicked off, and Lee didn't join Korea until the third and final group stage match. And he never once played a full 90 minutes. Lee, who missed some time from late August to early September with a left quadriceps injury, wasn't close to being Korea's best player on their run to the gold medal. That distinction belongs to Jeong Woo-yeong, midfielder for the Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart who led the Asian Games tournament with eight goals in seven matches. Jeong scored a brace in the semifinals against Uzbekistan and netted the equalizer against Japan to key Korea's rally. Though not nearly as beloved as Lee by Korean fans, Jeong, 24, is another talented young attacking player who will now be able to enjoy a potentially long club career. Before Lee and Jeong came the likes of Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min and Bayern Munich defender Kim Min-jae, who earned their military service exemptions with their 2018 Asian Games gold medals. Both players have established themselves as among the best in Europe, something Lee and Jeong will now try to do as they enter their prime years. Korea head coach Hwang Sun-hong said the gold medal would have a positive impact on Lee's career in the long run. \"He's playing for a great club, and I think he has to keep improving,\" Hwang said. \"And this exemption will help him continue on that career path. And I also think he has to keep playing hard for the country. It's important for him to play his best when wearing the national flag on his chest. And since he's playing well for a big club, I expect him to have a major influence on the development of Korean football.\" (Yonhap)","pubDate":"2023-10-08 03:35:05","image_url":"http://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/b8c745c5f61845348a8b9797a71656e4.jpg","source_id":"koreatimes","source_priority":35310,"country":["south korea"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1bfa745d8c7343f44dc19b0408e0dcc8","title":"Okocha, Maicon, Mboma, 147 other legends to feature in inaugural Veterans World Cup","link":"https://guardian.ng/sport/okocha-maicon-mboma-147-other-legends-to-feature-in-inaugural-veterans-world-cup/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha","Douglas Maicon","Patrice Mboma","Veterans World Cup"],"creator":["Guardian Nigeria"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Super Eagles Captain, Austin Jay Jay Okocha, Brazil legend, Douglas Maicon and retired Cameroun great, Patrice Mboma, are among former stars from across the world billed to feature in the inaugural Veteran Clubs World Cup (VCWC) slated to hold in Kigali, Rwanda, next year.

According to the organisers of the competition, the maiden VCWC will feature players from all the regions of the world, including women legends, who will take part in the football competition and also economic forums. Some of the players already listed for the competition, the organisers said, are Charmaine Hooper, Robert Pires, Gaizka Mendieta, Wael Gomaa, Jimmy Gatete, Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, Anthony Baffoe, Roger Milla and Laura Georges. Others are Lilian Thuram, Sonny Anderson, Louis Saha and Khalilou Fadiga. Teams at the championship will represent East and South Europe, North Africa and Middle East, North and West Europe, West and Central Africa, North and Central America, East and South Africa, South America, as well as Asia and Oceania. Speaking at the media presentation of the championship in Lagos on Friday, Jesse Happy Ndongo of Easy Group, one of the competition’s partners, said the participants at the VCWC would also be part of business expos to hold side by side with the championship. Ndongo said: “The championship will hold at the Amahoro Stadium and two other venues in Kigali. The teams are regional selections that will consider the popularity of the legends and the stories they have to tell, as well as those veterans that have invested in their communities’ development. “The first three editions will hold in Rwanda, but it could move to other zones with time. It is a yearly event that will continually incorporate new legends as they retire from the game.” Apart from football, the other activities to be held at the event, Ndongo said, are a youth expo, multisport competition, which will include tennis challenges and an amateur competition featuring youths from various communities. “The competition will have about 32 women legends because each team is expected to register at least two retired female legends in their squad,” he said.

After signing off with a 2-0 victory over New York City on Saturday night, Rooney told reporters he will not be renewing his contract in the US capital. Talking about his decision to leave, the Manchester United and England legend said: 'It's the right time. I've done everything I can to get this club into the playoffs. It's not a single thing that's happened. It's about timing.' Rooney's DC side is still mathematically in with a chance of reaching the MLS playoffs after the victory over New York City. As things stand, DC is currently holding the final playoff spot in ninth place on 40 points.

'We have spoken with Wayne and agreed it is best for us to part ways at this time,' said CEO and co-chairman Jason Levein. 'This decision creates the avenue for our next General Manager to have the full opportunity to impart a new philosophy and structure onto our sporting operations, which begins with the critical identification of a Head Coach who will best align with this.

Messi, who was a doubt for this weekend's match in South Florida , entered Saturday night's game in the 55' minute for defender Tomas Aviles in an offensive substitution, with the score still 0-0 at the time. But, roughly 23 minutes later, and Bareal scored off a fine save made by Inter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callendar to gift all three points to Cincinnati - the No. 1 seed of MLS' Eastern Conference. Inter Miami (9-17-6, 33 points) were eliminated from playoff contention due to their loss combined with CF Montreal 's win over the Portland Timbers. Messi, 36, played on Saturday evening for the first time since September 20, after missing two weeks with a reaggravated scar tissue injury in his leg. He could not capitalize on a few chances in Cincinnati's end when came in on as a substitute in the second half.

Up until Saturday night's game, the team had avoided defeat in all 12 of his appearances, only coming unstuck when he was unavailable. FC Cincinnati (20-5-8, 68 points) continued the best season in their young franchise history. They had already clinched the Supporters' Shield for the league's best record in the regular season. Roman Celentano made two saves for Cincinnati. Callender had five saves for Miami. Inter Miami had possession for 61.6 percent of the game, but just two of their 16 shot attempts were on target. Inter Miami controlled play in the first half and hit the woodwork on three separate occasions. Aviles hit the crossbar head-on from the center of the box, Josef Martinez pinged the far post with a shot and Benjamin Cremaschi's close-range shot went off the crossbar before the end of the scoreless first half. When Messi came on, 10 minutes after halftime, he quickly won a free kick in scoring range in the 59th minute, but he sent his attempt well over the crossbar.

Yuya Kubo moved in and fired on Callender, who parried it to his right. But Barreal was charging in on that side and easily deposited it in the net for his fifth goal of the season. In the 87th minute, Messi got a left-footed shot through some traffic, but it dribbled past the net and out of play. Messi drew two late fouls near the box, one in the 90th minute and one in stoppage time. On the first free kick, Messi tried to cross the ball in to a teammate and Cincinnati cleared it, setting up a fruitless Miami corner kick. On the latter, Messi's shot at goal went over the bar again. Miami ends it season as champions of the League Cup, runners-up of the U.S. Open Cup and in 14th place out of 15 in the MLS' Eastern Conference. Only Toronto (4-10-19, 22 points) trail the Herons in the league. Since Messi's July debut, Inter Miami only won one of the six games he missed and only lost one of the 13 he's played in.

The hosts cruised to victory at Audi Field on Saturday night as goals from Mateusz Klich and Chris Durkin either side of halftime were enough to see off the threat of New York. It means that, as things stand, DC is currently holding the final playoff spot in ninth place on 40 points. Chicago currently trails Charlotte 1-0 in one of Saturday night's later fixtures, meaning Frank Klopas's team is currently down in 11th place on goal difference. However, both Chicago and New York Red Bulls - in 10th place on 40 points - has one more game to play. Charlotte, projected to close out the evening on 39 points, also has two games-in-hand still to play. Wayne Rooney potentially bowed out as DC United manager with a 2-0 win over New York City Chris Durkin was on the scoresheet as DC United kept their faint MLS playoff hopes alive With their playoff chances unlikely, Rooney confirmed after the game that he will be leaving DC United once his contract comes to an end. 'It's the right time,' he told reporters. 'I've done everything I can to get this club into the playoffs. It's not a single thing that's happened. It's about timing.' Rooney is potentially waving goodbye to the club on a bittersweet note given it is still not entirely out of the question that his team makes it into the playoffs. Nevertheless, his future as manager was up in the air prior to Saturday's game with the guaranteed portion of his contract in the United States capital set to expire at the end of the season. There is a mutual option to renew until 2024, however the Manchester United and England legend missed training on Friday to all but confirm his time in DC is at an end.
