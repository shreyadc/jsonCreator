Liverpool are still in the hunt for a top-four finish after seven straight wins while Leicester and Leeds look destined for the drop.

Victory at home for Pep Guardiola’s side against Chelsea on Sunday would seal the deal but it will be all over the previous day if Arsenal lose to relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest. Liverpool are still in the hunt for a top-four finish after seven straight wins while Leicester and Leeds look destined for the drop. Last season City were pushed to the limit by Liverpool, only sealing the title after a thrilling comeback from 2-0 down against Aston Villa on the final day of the season. This year they are in a more comfortable position after winning their past 11 games to take a vice-like grip on the Premier League. Arsenal, for so long front-runners, must avoid defeat at Forest to keep the race alive but it is now a question of if, rather than when, for Guardiola’s team. Even if Arsenal win at Forest, few would back against City beating Chelsea at the Etihad and becoming Premier League champions for a third straight year. It would be their fifth title in six years, underlining their dominance in the richest league in the world. Once they have lifted the trophy, City will have the luxury of focusing on the FA Cup final against Manchester United and the Champions League final against Inter Milan as they seek to emulate United’s unique 1999 treble. Newcastle are within touching distance of a top-four finish for the first time in two decades just 19 months after the launch of their new era. They can complete the job themselves if they beat struggling Leicester on Monday. Fourth-placed Manchester United, three points behind Newcastle but with a game in hand, need two more wins from their final three games to guarantee Champions League football next season. If either slip up, Liverpool are waiting to pounce, seeking to qualify for the Champions League for the seventh consecutive season. Jamie Vardy still believes 19th-placed Leicester can survive in the Premier League after a horrific season but the odds are heavily stacked against them. The 2016 champions and 2021 FA Cup winners started the campaign with six defeats in their first seven games and their sporadic mini-revivals have petered out.
