North Macedonia need a swift response after their disappointment on Friday — they led Ukraine by two goals at half-time but fell apart in the second-half to lose 3-2. England vs North Macedonia is scheduled for a 7.45pm BST kick-off on Monday, June 19, 2023. The match will take place at Wembley Stadium in London. In the UK, the game will be televised live and free-to-air on Channel 4, with coverage starting at 7pm BST. Fans can also catch the contest live for free online via the All4 website and app. You can follow all the action on matchday via Standard Sport’s live blog, with expert analysis from Dan Kilpatrick at the ground. Bukayo Saka was withdrawn at half-time in the win over Malta after picking up a knock, and despite Southgate insisting that substitution was only precautionary. Phil Foden came off the bench in that match and could start at Wembley, with his Man City team-mates Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, John Stones and Kalvin Phillips all pushing to be involved too. Eberechi Eze should get more minutes after making his debut last time out, while Southgate may opt to continue with in midfield after his superb display. No10: Trent Alexander-Arnold shone in a more advanced role North Macedonia should offer a sterner test than Malta, but England will still be confident of a comfortable win on home soil. With the likely return of England’s Man City contingent and the Three Lions so often cruising to big victories in these qualifying games, Southgate’s side could rack up the goals again.

The 27-year-old cheekily posted pictures with Kane and Rice on social media stating that he took them on a “tour” of Carrington, where are preparing to face North Macedonia on Monday. Kane is a known target of the Red Devils but currently looks unlikely to leave this summer. United, meanwhile, have been tipped for a move for Rice but he continues to look -bound. They are just two players in Gareth Southgate’s squad who could move clubs this summer, not including Mason Mount, who United are continuing to pursue. Speaking about his club’s transfer plans, Shaw explained that he would like England’s best to join him at Old Trafford: “Yes, [my Instagram post was] half joking. It is a bit of both. SPONSORED “I know they are both world-class players and I don’t know what is going on at their clubs but if it was down to me, I would take them in a heartbeat and they would improve our team massively and help us go to what we want to achieve. “They have been here the last couple of days and hopefully they like it and can get used to it! It is up to the club and whatever they decide so we have to go from there.” This England squad features as many as ten players facing uncertain futures at their clubs this summer. Jordan Pickford, Marc Guehi, Harry Maguire, Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips, Conor Gallagher and James Maddison are also being linked with moves. Shaw accepted that it is a major talking point among the squad, who have become increasingly close-knit. He added: “It is hard not to read because it is everywhere. “Because of the situation of when this camp is and the situation of contracts running down, there is much more talk this time around than there has been in other years. “We read what is going on. We all talk. We are all really close. We have private conversations of what is going on although they won’t be spoken about here. We speak and that is all I can say.” Declan Rice and Harry Kane are both targets for Man Utd England have won their first three matches to reach Euro 2024 and are considered among the favourites to win the tournament in Germany. After seeing Jude Bellingham join Real Madrid for £100million, Shaw thinks England’s stars are rightly coveted after reaching new levels. He said: “You could pick anyone in this squad and love them to come to your team. We have strength and depth. “World-class abilities and any players that leave to go to another club this summer will only make the other team better. “I’ll do anything I can to bring the right players [to United] that I know the manager will like and want and who will improve our team.

Kenny’s position has been questioned and potential successors touted in the wake of a hugely disappointing 2-1 Euro 2024 qualifying defeat in Greece on Friday evening which left Ireland’s hopes of making it to the finals in severe jeopardy after just two games. However, asked if he had been given any assurances by the Football Association of Ireland that he would see out the campaign, the 51-year-old replied: “I haven’t sought any assurance. That’s not something I do.” Kenny, who complained about “a lack of respect” at his pre-match press conference, was asked how he felt he was doing as Ireland manager. Stephen Kenny has not sought assurances over his future (Brian Lawless/PA) He said: “I’m not going to sit here and do a full press conference on an assessment of my period in charge or anything like that, I’m here really to prepare for tomorrow, the game against Gibraltar. Advertisement “It’s a big game for us. Obviously, I’m disappointed that we lost against Greece, but we’ve got to bounce back against Gibraltar and I’m fairly sure we can do that, and we’ll take that into September.” For all Kenny’s bullishness, Ireland have won only four of the 23 competitive games they have played under his charge and lost five of the last eight. Asked if that was a source of disappointment, he said: “It’s a fair question. I’m disappointed about the Greek game, I’m disappointed we didn’t get the result that we needed. Listen, we have lost a game that we wanted to win and we have to bounce back against Gibraltar.” Former Ireland boss Brian Kerr was critical of Kenny’s tenure in his role as a TV pundit, while counterpart Liam Brady, one of the nation’s most gifted former internationals, described the current squad as “the worst group of players that any manager has had in my lifetime”.

Με ήρωα τον Ουνάι Σιμόν στη διαδικασία των πέναλτι, οι «Φούριας Ρόχας» λύγισαν την Κροατία με 5-4 (κ. δ. και παρ. 0-0) και έγιναν η δεύτερη ομάδα, μετά την Γαλλία, που έχει στη συλλογή της Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο, Euro και, πλέον, Nations League . Ο κεντρικός αμυντικός της ΑΕΚ , Ντομαγκόι Βίντα , έδωσε την θέση του στον Μάρτιν Έρλιτς στην βασική ενδεκάδα, στην μοναδική αλλαγή που έκανε ο Ζλάτκο Ντάλιτς σε σχέση με τον ημιτελικό απέναντι στην Ολλανδία. Με δύο αλλαγές σε σχέση με τον ημιτελικό κόντρα στην Ιταλία παρέταξε την ομάδα του ο Λουίς Ντε λα Φουέντε , με τον Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ αντί του Μίκελ Μερίνο στα χαφ και τον Μάρκο Ασένσιο αντί του Ροντρίγκο στην τριάδα πίσω από τον Άλβαρο Μοράτα . Πίεση ψηλά από τους Ισπανούς, μεγαλύτερος και καλύτερος έλεγχος της μπάλας από τους Κροάτες , οι οποίοι πάντως γλίτωσαν από το γκολ στο 12ο λεπτό, όταν ο Γκάβι μετά από κλέψιμο πλάσαρε ελάχιστα άουτ από το ύψος της μεγάλης περιοχής, ενώ είχε σε καλύτερη θέση στα δεξιά του τον Ασένσιο . Η Κροατία απάντησε με δύο τετ – α – τετ ευκαιρίες του Αντρέι Κράμαριτς μέσα σε δύο λεπτά (23’ και 24’), με τους κεντρικούς αμυντικούς της Ισπανίας να τον προλαβαίνουν προτού γίνει πραγματικά επικίνδυνος για την εστία του Ουνάι Σιμόν . Οι άμυνες, μετά από ένα αρκετά συντηρητικό 25λεπτο, άνοιξαν κάπως, με Ρόδρι και Ιβάν Πέρισιτς να απειλούν με κεφαλιές εκατέρωθεν και την Κροατία να περιορίζει σημαντικά την δράση του μέσου της Μάντσεστερ Σίτι και MVP του Champions League, κάτι που στοίχιζε στην Ισπανία. Μια κεφαλιά άουτ του Μοράτα έπειτα από ωραίο ομαδικό συνδυασμό ήταν η τελευταία άξια αναφοράς φάση σε ένα πολύ ισορροπημένο πρώτο ημίχρονο όπου οι δύο ομάδες ήταν ιδιαιτέρως προσεκτικές και έριξαν το βάρος στην άμυνα, παρά στην επίθεση. Χωρίς αλλαγές μπήκαν οι δύο ομάδες στο δεύτερο μέρος, με την Κροατία να αγγίζει το γκολ στο 51ο λεπτό όταν, μετά από εξαιρετική ενέργεια και σέντρα του Πέρισιτς , ο Γιόσιπ Γιουράνοβιτς μέσα από την περιοχή σούταρε πολύ διαγώνια άουτ. Οι Ισπανοί απάντησαν με κεφαλιά άουτ του Ασένσιο από καλή θέση ύστερα από σέντρα του Τζόρντι Άλμπα (56’), ο Μάριο Πάσαλιτς είχε επίσης κεφαλιά άουτ λίγο αργότερα (60’), στην τελευταία του ενέργεια προτού δώσει την θέση του στον ήρωα του ημιτελικού, Μπρούνο Πέτκοβιτς . Οι Βαλκάνιοι έδιναν μεγαλύτερη αίσθηση κινδύνου στις επιθέσεις τους, με τον Ντε λα Φουέντε να ψάχνει αντίδραση με δύο αλλαγές, ρίχνοντας στη μάχη τον Ανσού Φατί και τον «χρυσό» σκόρερ του ημιτελικού Χοσέλου, αντί των Γιέρεμι Πίνο και Μοράτα αντίστοιχα. Μακρινό πλασέ άουτ του Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ προ κενής εστίας ύστερα από έξοδο και διώξιμο του Ντόμινικ Λιβάκοβιτς προ του Φατί (75’), σουτ άουτ του Ασένσιο λίγο αργότερα για μια Ισπανία που είχε πάρει λίγο τα πάνω της μετά από ένα μάλλον παθητικό πρώτο μέρος στην επανάληψη. Νέα διπλή αλλαγή του Ντε λα Φουέντε , η μια υποχρεωτική λόγω ενοχλήσεων του Ρομπέν Λε Νορμάντ , με τον Νάτσο να τον αντικαθιστά και τον Μερίνο να παίρνει την θέση του κουρασμένου Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ , την ώρα που ο Ντάλιτς έκανε την δεύτερη κίνησή του με τον Νίκολα Βλάσιτς αντί του Λούκα Ιβανούσεκ . Στο 84’, οι ανεβασμένοι Ίβηρες έχασαν μοναδική ευκαιρία για να ανοίξουν το σκορ και να κάνουν άλμα για την κατάκτηση του τροπαίου, όταν μετά από πολύ ωραίο συνδυασμό Άλμπα – Μερίνο η μπάλα έφτασε στον Φατί μέσα στην περιοχή, αλλά το σουτ του επιθετικού της Μπαρτσελόνα σταμάτησε πάνω στον Πέρισιτς , λίγο πριν από την γραμμή της εστίας. Ο Ντε λα Φουέντε αποφάσισε να ρισκάρει με την είσοδο του Ντάνι Όλμο αντί του Γκάβι για να κάνει ακόμα πιο επιθετική την ομάδα του, με τον Ασένσιο να σουτάρει διαγώνιο άουτ μέσα από την περιοχή, ύστερα από εξαιρετική μπαλιά του αιεθαλούς Νάβας . Ο Ντάλιτς έψαξε μεγαλύτερη δημιουργικότητα με την είσοδο του Λόβρο Μάγιερ αντί του Κράμαριτς ενόψει, ουσιαστικά, της παράτασης, στην οποία οδηγήθηκε το ματς, όπως συνέβη και στο τελευταίο ραντεβού των δύο ομάδων, στους «16» του Euro2020 . Εκείνο το παιχνίδι, βεβαίως, ήταν 3-3 μετά το 90λεπτο και έληξε 5-3 υπέρ των Ισπανών μετά το έξτρα ημίωρο… Ο Ρόδρι δεν είχε άλλες ανάσες (κατέβασε ακόμα και τις κάλτσες του...), αλλά ο Ντε λα Φουέντε υποχρεώθηκε να αντικαταστήσει τον εξαντλημένο Νάβας στη διάρκεια της παράτασης, στην οποία ο Νάτσο με αυτοθυσία πρόλαβε τον Μάγιερ προτού αυτός σουτάρει, με αποτέλεσμα να τραυματιστεί και να παίξει χωλαίνοντας στη συνέχεια. Η εκατέρωθεν κούραση άνοιξε διαδρόμους και παραλίγο να τους εκμεταλλευτεί ο Ντάνι Όλμο , ο οποίος σούταρε ψηλά άουτ από πολύ καλή θέση (104’), σε μια παράταση που μάλλον ευνόησε την Κροατία , αφού στην τελική ευθεία του 90λεπτου η Ισπανία ήταν ανώτερη. Ο Μαρσέλο Μπρόζοβιτς σούταρε πέφτοντας για να μπλοκάρει ο Σιμόν , ο Ντάνι Όλμο άγγιξε ξανά το γκολ σε σουτ μέσα από την περιοχή που κόντραρε σε αντίπαλο και πήγε κόρνερ, με τις δύο ομάδες να «επιλέγουν» εντέλει να πάει ο τελικός στα πέναλτι, ρισκάροντας ελάχιστα στα τελευταία λεπτά. Πριν από την διαδικασία από την άσπρη βούλα, υπήρξε έντασση και μια μικρή… κλοτσοπατινάδα (!) στην οποία συμμετείχε και ο Βίντα, χωρίς πάντως να… ξεφύγει η κατάσταση. Στα πέναλτι, ο Ουνάι Σιμόν εξελίχθηκε σε ήρωα των Ιβήρων, απέκρουσε τα σουτ των Μάγιερ και Πέτκοβιτς, ο Αϊμερίκ Λαπόρτ έστειλε το δικό του στο οριζόντιο δοκάρι και ο Ντάνι Καρβαχάλ , με εκτέλεση α λα Πανένκα , έστεψε την Ισπανία. Η σκηνή του τελικού, βεβαίως, οι Ισπανοί παίκτες της Ρεάλ Μαδρίτης που έσπευσαν να παρηγορήσουν τον Λούκα Μόντριτς , ο οποίος δεν μπόρεσε για άλλη μια φορά να σηκώσει έναν τίτλο με την απίθανη παρέα του...

Chasing their first-ever major trophy and possibly a last dance for and a team that has finished second and third at the last two World Cups, failed to pull off their trademark route to tournament glory of simply outlasting their opponent in a match of pure attrition. Lovro Majer and Bruno Petkovic both saw their penalties saved by goalkeeper Simon and, although spurned Spain’s first match point, stepped up to seal La Roja’s first triumph in the competition. After the drama of both semi-finals and the five-goal play-off that Italy won earlier in the day to take third place, it was perhaps not surprising that it was the final that delivered a more tense affair. In truth, it was a game that had penalties written all over it from very early on. SPONSORED Both teams reeled out the classics; Croatia doggedly organised and sensibly biding their time without any concern at going the distance, Spain most at ease when calmly passing the ball with maximum patience as they looked to craft an immaculate breakthrough goal. A slow start was punctured by Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic dropping a straightforward cross onto his post, before the offside Alvaro Morata failed to pounce on the rebound. Another mistake from Zlatko Dalic’s side handed Gavi an opportunity to shoot from 18 yards, an effort he dragged wide, before Aymeric Laporte did superbly to deny Andrej Kramaric a shooting chance with a break up the other end. In the second half, it wasn’t until the latter stages that La Roja looked the most likely side to grab the go-ahead goal. Ansu Fati’s pace terrorised Croatia’s defenders after he came off the bench and fine work from Jordi Alba helped tee up the Barcelona youngster with five minutes left, only for his stab goalwards to be turned off the line by Ivan Perisic. Extra time saw Dani Olmo fire over the bar from a central position as Spain continued to waste decent chances in front of goal. Croatia’s shootout defeat leaves a question mark over Modric’s international future, although it will hardly be a surprise if he opts for a final shot at glory in next summer’s Euros - when he’ll be 38 and coming off the back of likely his last season at Real Madrid. For Spain, Luis de la Fuente has come through a rocky start to life in the dugout with a perhaps surprising piece of silverware as they kickstart a new era in fine fashion.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 21:55:23","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/06/18/22/1499557600.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Transfer news LIVE!

United have given up on bringing Harry Kane to Old Trafford, while they also look set to miss out on Kim Min-jae as Bayern Munich close in on signing the centre-back. Follow all the latest news, gossip and rumours below! Goncalo Ramos is available for £80m this summer. Agent Jorge Mendes has reportedly offered the Benfica striker around Europe with a very clear price tag on his head. Among the teams tracking Ramos’ situation are Manchester United, Tottenham, West Ham and Newcastle, so say The Sun. Emile Smith Rowe has vowed to fight for his Arsenal career after rumours of a move away. Mikel Arteta wants to keep the midfielder at the Emirates next season despite interest from Brighton. “Arsenal are my club and I’m not going to give up until [Arteta] says he doesn’t want me,” he told The Times. “But that’s not the case. He wants me as part of the team and I want to fight for my place and get back in the team.” Leicester want a speedy resolution to the speculation over James Maddison’s future. Newcastle and Tottenham are both unwilling to meet the Foxes’ price tag, according to Northern Echo. Maddison will cost £60m even though his contract expires in a year’s time. Romelu Lukaku has told Chelsea he only wants to sign for Inter Milan. The Nerazzurri have seen a loan bid for the Belgian striker rejected after he spent this season on a temporary deal back at the Giuseppe Meazza. Inter also want Kalidou Koulibaly on loan next year. However, Chelsea have rejected the bids as they look to seal a permanent sale. La Gazzetta dello Sport report on Lukaku being determined to re-sign for Inter. Mikel Arteta has declined Alexis Sanchez’s offer to return to Arsenal. Chilean newspaper La Tercera claim the ex-Gunners winger called Arteta after his contract expired at Marseille. But a reportedly “direct” response from the manager was not a positive one for 34-year-old Sanchez. Kylian Mbappe has once again spoken of his plans to snub a move to Real Madrid this summer. With only a year left on his PSG contract, the Frenchman told Telefoot that he is calm over his future. “I have already said that I will stay at Paris Saint-Germain Germain and I said it before all this happened,” he stated. “Next year I'll play for PSG, that's what I said. There are many things that can happen in a year, especially in a club like PSG.” Kylian Mbappe addresses the French media ahead of Euro 2024 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Greece Inter Milan have been warned not to sell Nicolo Barella to Chelsea. Newcastle are also keen on the Italian midfielder, and a sale would be greeted with fury by Inter’s ultras. They have posted a group message to social media making clear their anger at any potential exit, writing of Barella: “Interista born, present and future. Untouchable.” Arsenal are ready to cash in on Thomas Partey. With Granit Xhaka set to leave for Bayer Leverkusen and Mikel Arteta eyeing new midfielders, the Ghanaian may be next to head for pastures new. The Telegraph report on Arsenal being ready to listen to offers if a replacement can be found. Declan Rice and Romeo Lavia are both sought after by the Gunners. Erik ten Hag is reportedly furious that Manchester United’s takeover has held up his transfer plans. The Glazers continue to dither over whether to sell the club to Jim Ratcliffe or Sheikh Jassim, with a solution not expected until after the start of next season. United are said by The Sun to have wanted Declan Rice, but now look set to miss out on him to Arsenal or Manchester City. Kyle Walker is in talks to sign for Bayern Munich. Having been left out of Manchester City’s line-up for the Champions League final, the England defender is ready to try his luck elsewhere. Sky Germany say no agreement has been reached between Bayern, Walker and City yet but Thomas Tuchel’s presence in Bavaria is helping to persuade him to join.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 21:53:58","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/06/15/08/pltransfer150523v1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Μέσι: «Έχω πετύχει τα πάντα στο ποδόσφαιρο, δεν μένει κάτι άλλο»","link":"https://www.gazzetta.gr/football/mls/2231704/mesi-eho-petyhei-ta-panta-sto-podosfairo-den-menei-kati-allo","keywords":["Ποδόσφαιρο","Αργεντινή","Newsroom","MLS","Ίντερ Μαϊάμι"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Μία μεγάλη συνέντευξη παραχώρησε ο Λιονέλ Μέσι, η οποία θα δημοσιευθεί στις 24/06, όπου φαίνεται να λέει ότι έχει πετύχει τα πάντα στο ποδόσφαιρο.","content":"Μία νέα πρόκληση ετοιμάζεται να αντιμετωπίσει ο Λιονέλ Μέσι καθώς θα αφήσει για πρώτη φορά την Ευρώπη για το πρωτάθλημα του MLS όπου θα αγωνίζεται από τη νέα σεζόν με την Ίντερ Μαϊάμι.

Bukayo Saka was withdrawn at half-time in the win over Malta after picking up a knock, and despite Southgate insisting that substitution was only precautionary. Phil Foden came off the bench in that match and could start at Wembley, with his Man City team-mates Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, John Stones and Kalvin Phillips all pushing to be involved too.

The 27-year-old cheekily posted pictures with Kane and Rice on social media stating that he took them on a “tour” of Carrington, where are preparing to face North Macedonia on Monday. Kane is a known target of the Red Devils but currently looks unlikely to leave this summer. United, meanwhile, have been tipped for a move for Rice but he continues to look -bound. They are just two players in Gareth Southgate’s squad who could move clubs this summer, not including Mason Mount, who United are continuing to pursue. Speaking about his club’s transfer plans, Shaw explained that he would like England’s best to join him at Old Trafford: “Yes, [my Instagram post was] half joking. It is a bit of both. SPONSORED “I know they are both world-class players and I don’t know what is going on at their clubs but if it was down to me, I would take them in a heartbeat and they would improve our team massively and help us go to what we want to achieve. “They have been here the last couple of days and hopefully they like it and can get used to it! It is up to the club and whatever they decide so we have to go from there.” This England squad features as many as ten players facing uncertain futures at their clubs this summer. Jordan Pickford, Marc Guehi, Harry Maguire, Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips, Conor Gallagher and James Maddison are also being linked with moves. Shaw accepted that it is a major talking point among the squad, who have become increasingly close-knit. He added: “It is hard not to read because it is everywhere. “Because of the situation of when this camp is and the situation of contracts running down, there is much more talk this time around than there has been in other years. “We read what is going on. We all talk. We are all really close. We have private conversations of what is going on although they won’t be spoken about here. We speak and that is all I can say.” Declan Rice and Harry Kane are both targets for Man Utd England have won their first three matches to reach Euro 2024 and are considered among the favourites to win the tournament in Germany. After seeing Jude Bellingham join Real Madrid for £100million, Shaw thinks England’s stars are rightly coveted after reaching new levels. He said: “You could pick anyone in this squad and love them to come to your team. We have strength and depth. “World-class abilities and any players that leave to go to another club this summer will only make the other team better. “I’ll do anything I can to bring the right players [to United] that I know the manager will like and want and who will improve our team.

Kenny’s position has been questioned and potential successors touted in the wake of a hugely disappointing 2-1 Euro 2024 qualifying defeat in Greece on Friday evening which left Ireland’s hopes of making it to the finals in severe jeopardy after just two games. However, asked if he had been given any assurances by the Football Association of Ireland that he would see out the campaign, the 51-year-old replied: “I haven’t sought any assurance. That’s not something I do.” Kenny, who complained about “a lack of respect” at his pre-match press conference, was asked how he felt he was doing as Ireland manager. Stephen Kenny has not sought assurances over his future (Brian Lawless/PA) He said: “I’m not going to sit here and do a full press conference on an assessment of my period in charge or anything like that, I’m here really to prepare for tomorrow, the game against Gibraltar. Advertisement “It’s a big game for us. Obviously, I’m disappointed that we lost against Greece, but we’ve got to bounce back against Gibraltar and I’m fairly sure we can do that, and we’ll take that into September.” For all Kenny’s bullishness, Ireland have won only four of the 23 competitive games they have played under his charge and lost five of the last eight. Asked if that was a source of disappointment, he said: “It’s a fair question. I’m disappointed about the Greek game, I’m disappointed we didn’t get the result that we needed. Listen, we have lost a game that we wanted to win and we have to bounce back against Gibraltar.” Former Ireland boss Brian Kerr was critical of Kenny’s tenure in his role as a TV pundit, while counterpart Liam Brady, one of the nation’s most gifted former internationals, described the current squad as “the worst group of players that any manager has had in my lifetime”.

I’m not going to do that. “But look, we have a tendency, especially in this country, to get carried away. We are two games in now. This country in the past has shown that we have big results in us when no-one has expected it. “There is a lot of football to be played between now and the end of the campaign.

Με ήρωα τον Ουνάι Σιμόν στη διαδικασία των πέναλτι, οι «Φούριας Ρόχας» λύγισαν την Κροατία με 5-4 (κ. δ. και παρ. 0-0) και έγιναν η δεύτερη ομάδα, μετά την Γαλλία, που έχει στη συλλογή της Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο, Euro και, πλέον, Nations League . Ο κεντρικός αμυντικός της ΑΕΚ , Ντομαγκόι Βίντα , έδωσε την θέση του στον Μάρτιν Έρλιτς στην βασική ενδεκάδα, στην μοναδική αλλαγή που έκανε ο Ζλάτκο Ντάλιτς σε σχέση με τον ημιτελικό απέναντι στην Ολλανδία. Με δύο αλλαγές σε σχέση με τον ημιτελικό κόντρα στην Ιταλία παρέταξε την ομάδα του ο Λουίς Ντε λα Φουέντε , με τον Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ αντί του Μίκελ Μερίνο στα χαφ και τον Μάρκο Ασένσιο αντί του Ροντρίγκο στην τριάδα πίσω από τον Άλβαρο Μοράτα . Πίεση ψηλά από τους Ισπανούς, μεγαλύτερος και καλύτερος έλεγχος της μπάλας από τους Κροάτες , οι οποίοι πάντως γλίτωσαν από το γκολ στο 12ο λεπτό, όταν ο Γκάβι μετά από κλέψιμο πλάσαρε ελάχιστα άουτ από το ύψος της μεγάλης περιοχής, ενώ είχε σε καλύτερη θέση στα δεξιά του τον Ασένσιο . Η Κροατία απάντησε με δύο τετ – α – τετ ευκαιρίες του Αντρέι Κράμαριτς μέσα σε δύο λεπτά (23’ και 24’), με τους κεντρικούς αμυντικούς της Ισπανίας να τον προλαβαίνουν προτού γίνει πραγματικά επικίνδυνος για την εστία του Ουνάι Σιμόν . Οι άμυνες, μετά από ένα αρκετά συντηρητικό 25λεπτο, άνοιξαν κάπως, με Ρόδρι και Ιβάν Πέρισιτς να απειλούν με κεφαλιές εκατέρωθεν και την Κροατία να περιορίζει σημαντικά την δράση του μέσου της Μάντσεστερ Σίτι και MVP του Champions League, κάτι που στοίχιζε στην Ισπανία. Μια κεφαλιά άουτ του Μοράτα έπειτα από ωραίο ομαδικό συνδυασμό ήταν η τελευταία άξια αναφοράς φάση σε ένα πολύ ισορροπημένο πρώτο ημίχρονο όπου οι δύο ομάδες ήταν ιδιαιτέρως προσεκτικές και έριξαν το βάρος στην άμυνα, παρά στην επίθεση. Χωρίς αλλαγές μπήκαν οι δύο ομάδες στο δεύτερο μέρος, με την Κροατία να αγγίζει το γκολ στο 51ο λεπτό όταν, μετά από εξαιρετική ενέργεια και σέντρα του Πέρισιτς , ο Γιόσιπ Γιουράνοβιτς μέσα από την περιοχή σούταρε πολύ διαγώνια άουτ. Οι Ισπανοί απάντησαν με κεφαλιά άουτ του Ασένσιο από καλή θέση ύστερα από σέντρα του Τζόρντι Άλμπα (56’), ο Μάριο Πάσαλιτς είχε επίσης κεφαλιά άουτ λίγο αργότερα (60’), στην τελευταία του ενέργεια προτού δώσει την θέση του στον ήρωα του ημιτελικού, Μπρούνο Πέτκοβιτς . Οι Βαλκάνιοι έδιναν μεγαλύτερη αίσθηση κινδύνου στις επιθέσεις τους, με τον Ντε λα Φουέντε να ψάχνει αντίδραση με δύο αλλαγές, ρίχνοντας στη μάχη τον Ανσού Φατί και τον «χρυσό» σκόρερ του ημιτελικού Χοσέλου, αντί των Γιέρεμι Πίνο και Μοράτα αντίστοιχα. Μακρινό πλασέ άουτ του Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ προ κενής εστίας ύστερα από έξοδο και διώξιμο του Ντόμινικ Λιβάκοβιτς προ του Φατί (75’), σουτ άουτ του Ασένσιο λίγο αργότερα για μια Ισπανία που είχε πάρει λίγο τα πάνω της μετά από ένα μάλλον παθητικό πρώτο μέρος στην επανάληψη. Νέα διπλή αλλαγή του Ντε λα Φουέντε , η μια υποχρεωτική λόγω ενοχλήσεων του Ρομπέν Λε Νορμάντ , με τον Νάτσο να τον αντικαθιστά και τον Μερίνο να παίρνει την θέση του κουρασμένου Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ , την ώρα που ο Ντάλιτς έκανε την δεύτερη κίνησή του με τον Νίκολα Βλάσιτς αντί του Λούκα Ιβανούσεκ . Στο 84’, οι ανεβασμένοι Ίβηρες έχασαν μοναδική ευκαιρία για να ανοίξουν το σκορ και να κάνουν άλμα για την κατάκτηση του τροπαίου, όταν μετά από πολύ ωραίο συνδυασμό Άλμπα – Μερίνο η μπάλα έφτασε στον Φατί μέσα στην περιοχή, αλλά το σουτ του επιθετικού της Μπαρτσελόνα σταμάτησε πάνω στον Πέρισιτς , λίγο πριν από την γραμμή της εστίας. Ο Ντε λα Φουέντε αποφάσισε να ρισκάρει με την είσοδο του Ντάνι Όλμο αντί του Γκάβι για να κάνει ακόμα πιο επιθετική την ομάδα του, με τον Ασένσιο να σουτάρει διαγώνιο άουτ μέσα από την περιοχή, ύστερα από εξαιρετική μπαλιά του αιεθαλούς Νάβας . Ο Ντάλιτς έψαξε μεγαλύτερη δημιουργικότητα με την είσοδο του Λόβρο Μάγιερ αντί του Κράμαριτς ενόψει, ουσιαστικά, της παράτασης, στην οποία οδηγήθηκε το ματς, όπως συνέβη και στο τελευταίο ραντεβού των δύο ομάδων, στους «16» του Euro2020 . Εκείνο το παιχνίδι, βεβαίως, ήταν 3-3 μετά το 90λεπτο και έληξε 5-3 υπέρ των Ισπανών μετά το έξτρα ημίωρο… Ο Ρόδρι δεν είχε άλλες ανάσες (κατέβασε ακόμα και τις κάλτσες του...), αλλά ο Ντε λα Φουέντε υποχρεώθηκε να αντικαταστήσει τον εξαντλημένο Νάβας στη διάρκεια της παράτασης, στην οποία ο Νάτσο με αυτοθυσία πρόλαβε τον Μάγιερ προτού αυτός σουτάρει, με αποτέλεσμα να τραυματιστεί και να παίξει χωλαίνοντας στη συνέχεια. Η εκατέρωθεν κούραση άνοιξε διαδρόμους και παραλίγο να τους εκμεταλλευτεί ο Ντάνι Όλμο , ο οποίος σούταρε ψηλά άουτ από πολύ καλή θέση (104’), σε μια παράταση που μάλλον ευνόησε την Κροατία , αφού στην τελική ευθεία του 90λεπτου η Ισπανία ήταν ανώτερη. Ο Μαρσέλο Μπρόζοβιτς σούταρε πέφτοντας για να μπλοκάρει ο Σιμόν , ο Ντάνι Όλμο άγγιξε ξανά το γκολ σε σουτ μέσα από την περιοχή που κόντραρε σε αντίπαλο και πήγε κόρνερ, με τις δύο ομάδες να «επιλέγουν» εντέλει να πάει ο τελικός στα πέναλτι, ρισκάροντας ελάχιστα στα τελευταία λεπτά. Πριν από την διαδικασία από την άσπρη βούλα, υπήρξε έντασση και μια μικρή… κλοτσοπατινάδα (!) στην οποία συμμετείχε και ο Βίντα, χωρίς πάντως να… ξεφύγει η κατάσταση. Στα πέναλτι, ο Ουνάι Σιμόν εξελίχθηκε σε ήρωα των Ιβήρων, απέκρουσε τα σουτ των Μάγιερ και Πέτκοβιτς, ο Αϊμερίκ Λαπόρτ έστειλε το δικό του στο οριζόντιο δοκάρι και ο Ντάνι Καρβαχάλ , με εκτέλεση α λα Πανένκα , έστεψε την Ισπανία. Η σκηνή του τελικού, βεβαίως, οι Ισπανοί παίκτες της Ρεάλ Μαδρίτης που έσπευσαν να παρηγορήσουν τον Λούκα Μόντριτς , ο οποίος δεν μπόρεσε για άλλη μια φορά να σηκώσει έναν τίτλο με την απίθανη παρέα του...

Chasing their first-ever major trophy and possibly a last dance for and a team that has finished second and third at the last two World Cups, failed to pull off their trademark route to tournament glory of simply outlasting their opponent in a match of pure attrition. Lovro Majer and Bruno Petkovic both saw their penalties saved by goalkeeper Simon and, although spurned Spain’s first match point, stepped up to seal La Roja’s first triumph in the competition. After the drama of both semi-finals and the five-goal play-off that Italy won earlier in the day to take third place, it was perhaps not surprising that it was the final that delivered a more tense affair. In truth, it was a game that had penalties written all over it from very early on. SPONSORED Both teams reeled out the classics; Croatia doggedly organised and sensibly biding their time without any concern at going the distance, Spain most at ease when calmly passing the ball with maximum patience as they looked to craft an immaculate breakthrough goal. A slow start was punctured by Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic dropping a straightforward cross onto his post, before the offside Alvaro Morata failed to pounce on the rebound. Another mistake from Zlatko Dalic’s side handed Gavi an opportunity to shoot from 18 yards, an effort he dragged wide, before Aymeric Laporte did superbly to deny Andrej Kramaric a shooting chance with a break up the other end. In the second half, it wasn’t until the latter stages that La Roja looked the most likely side to grab the go-ahead goal. Ansu Fati’s pace terrorised Croatia’s defenders after he came off the bench and fine work from Jordi Alba helped tee up the Barcelona youngster with five minutes left, only for his stab goalwards to be turned off the line by Ivan Perisic. Extra time saw Dani Olmo fire over the bar from a central position as Spain continued to waste decent chances in front of goal. Croatia’s shootout defeat leaves a question mark over Modric’s international future, although it will hardly be a surprise if he opts for a final shot at glory in next summer’s Euros - when he’ll be 38 and coming off the back of likely his last season at Real Madrid. For Spain, Luis de la Fuente has come through a rocky start to life in the dugout with a perhaps surprising piece of silverware as they kickstart a new era in fine fashion.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 21:55:23","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/06/18/22/1499557600.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Transfer news LIVE!

Over at Tottenham, Leicester duo James Maddison and Harvey Barnes are top targets, while for around £25m. United have given up on bringing Harry Kane to Old Trafford, while they also look set to miss out on Kim Min-jae as Bayern Munich close in on signing the centre-back. Follow all the latest news, gossip and rumours below! Goncalo Ramos is available for £80m this summer. Agent Jorge Mendes has reportedly offered the Benfica striker around Europe with a very clear price tag on his head. Among the teams tracking Ramos’ situation are Manchester United, Tottenham, West Ham and Newcastle, so say The Sun. Emile Smith Rowe has vowed to fight for his Arsenal career after rumours of a move away. Mikel Arteta wants to keep the midfielder at the Emirates next season despite interest from Brighton. “Arsenal are my club and I’m not going to give up until [Arteta] says he doesn’t want me,” he told The Times. “But that’s not the case. He wants me as part of the team and I want to fight for my place and get back in the team.” Leicester want a speedy resolution to the speculation over James Maddison’s future. Newcastle and Tottenham are both unwilling to meet the Foxes’ price tag, according to Northern Echo. Maddison will cost £60m even though his contract expires in a year’s time. Romelu Lukaku has told Chelsea he only wants to sign for Inter Milan. The Nerazzurri have seen a loan bid for the Belgian striker rejected after he spent this season on a temporary deal back at the Giuseppe Meazza. Inter also want Kalidou Koulibaly on loan next year. However, Chelsea have rejected the bids as they look to seal a permanent sale. La Gazzetta dello Sport report on Lukaku being determined to re-sign for Inter. Mikel Arteta has declined Alexis Sanchez’s offer to return to Arsenal. Chilean newspaper La Tercera claim the ex-Gunners winger called Arteta after his contract expired at Marseille. But a reportedly “direct” response from the manager was not a positive one for 34-year-old Sanchez. Kylian Mbappe has once again spoken of his plans to snub a move to Real Madrid this summer. With only a year left on his PSG contract, the Frenchman told Telefoot that he is calm over his future. “I have already said that I will stay at Paris Saint-Germain Germain and I said it before all this happened,” he stated. “Next year I'll play for PSG, that's what I said. There are many things that can happen in a year, especially in a club like PSG.” Kylian Mbappe addresses the French media ahead of Euro 2024 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Greece Inter Milan have been warned not to sell Nicolo Barella to Chelsea. Newcastle are also keen on the Italian midfielder, and a sale would be greeted with fury by Inter’s ultras. They have posted a group message to social media making clear their anger at any potential exit, writing of Barella: “Interista born, present and future. Untouchable.” Arsenal are ready to cash in on Thomas Partey. With Granit Xhaka set to leave for Bayer Leverkusen and Mikel Arteta eyeing new midfielders, the Ghanaian may be next to head for pastures new. The Telegraph report on Arsenal being ready to listen to offers if a replacement can be found. Declan Rice and Romeo Lavia are both sought after by the Gunners. Erik ten Hag is reportedly furious that Manchester United’s takeover has held up his transfer plans. The Glazers continue to dither over whether to sell the club to Jim Ratcliffe or Sheikh Jassim, with a solution not expected until after the start of next season. United are said by The Sun to have wanted Declan Rice, but now look set to miss out on him to Arsenal or Manchester City. Kyle Walker is in talks to sign for Bayern Munich. Having been left out of Manchester City’s line-up for the Champions League final, the England defender is ready to try his luck elsewhere. Sky Germany say no agreement has been reached between Bayern, Walker and City yet but Thomas Tuchel’s presence in Bavaria is helping to persuade him to join.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 21:53:58","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/06/15/08/pltransfer150523v1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Μέσι: «Έχω πετύχει τα πάντα στο ποδόσφαιρο, δεν μένει κάτι άλλο»","link":"https://www.gazzetta.gr/football/mls/2231704/mesi-eho-petyhei-ta-panta-sto-podosfairo-den-menei-kati-allo","keywords":["Ποδόσφαιρο","Αργεντινή","Newsroom","MLS","Ίντερ Μαϊάμι"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Μία μεγάλη συνέντευξη παραχώρησε ο Λιονέλ Μέσι, η οποία θα δημοσιευθεί στις 24/06, όπου φαίνεται να λέει ότι έχει πετύχει τα πάντα στο ποδόσφαιρο.","content":"Μία νέα πρόκληση ετοιμάζεται να αντιμετωπίσει ο Λιονέλ Μέσι καθώς θα αφήσει για πρώτη φορά την Ευρώπη για το πρωτάθλημα του MLS όπου θα αγωνίζεται από τη νέα σεζόν με την Ίντερ Μαϊάμι.

Kane is a known target of the Red Devils but currently looks unlikely to leave this summer. United, meanwhile, have been tipped for a move for Rice but he continues to look -bound. They are just two players in Gareth Southgate’s squad who could move clubs this summer, not including Mason Mount, who United are continuing to pursue. Speaking about his club’s transfer plans, Shaw explained that he would like England’s best to join him at Old Trafford: “Yes, [my Instagram post was] half joking. It is a bit of both. SPONSORED “I know they are both world-class players and I don’t know what is going on at their clubs but if it was down to me, I would take them in a heartbeat and they would improve our team massively and help us go to what we want to achieve. “They have been here the last couple of days and hopefully they like it and can get used to it!

Jordan Pickford, Marc Guehi, Harry Maguire, Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips, Conor Gallagher and James Maddison are also being linked with moves. Shaw accepted that it is a major talking point among the squad, who have become increasingly close-knit. He added: “It is hard not to read because it is everywhere. “Because of the situation of when this camp is and the situation of contracts running down, there is much more talk this time around than there has been in other years. “We read what is going on.

After seeing Jude Bellingham join Real Madrid for £100million, Shaw thinks England’s stars are rightly coveted after reaching new levels. He said: “You could pick anyone in this squad and love them to come to your team. We have strength and depth. “World-class abilities and any players that leave to go to another club this summer will only make the other team better. “I’ll do anything I can to bring the right players [to United] that I know the manager will like and want and who will improve our team.

Kenny’s position has been questioned and potential successors touted in the wake of a hugely disappointing 2-1 Euro 2024 qualifying defeat in Greece on Friday evening which left Ireland’s hopes of making it to the finals in severe jeopardy after just two games. However, asked if he had been given any assurances by the Football Association of Ireland that he would see out the campaign, the 51-year-old replied: “I haven’t sought any assurance. That’s not something I do.” Kenny, who complained about “a lack of respect” at his pre-match press conference, was asked how he felt he was doing as Ireland manager. Stephen Kenny has not sought assurances over his future (Brian Lawless/PA) He said: “I’m not going to sit here and do a full press conference on an assessment of my period in charge or anything like that, I’m here really to prepare for tomorrow, the game against Gibraltar. Advertisement “It’s a big game for us. Obviously, I’m disappointed that we lost against Greece, but we’ve got to bounce back against Gibraltar and I’m fairly sure we can do that, and we’ll take that into September.” For all Kenny’s bullishness, Ireland have won only four of the 23 competitive games they have played under his charge and lost five of the last eight. Asked if that was a source of disappointment, he said: “It’s a fair question. I’m disappointed about the Greek game, I’m disappointed we didn’t get the result that we needed. Listen, we have lost a game that we wanted to win and we have to bounce back against Gibraltar.” Former Ireland boss Brian Kerr was critical of Kenny’s tenure in his role as a TV pundit, while counterpart Liam Brady, one of the nation’s most gifted former internationals, described the current squad as “the worst group of players that any manager has had in my lifetime”.

Με ήρωα τον Ουνάι Σιμόν στη διαδικασία των πέναλτι, οι «Φούριας Ρόχας» λύγισαν την Κροατία με 5-4 (κ. δ. και παρ. 0-0) και έγιναν η δεύτερη ομάδα, μετά την Γαλλία, που έχει στη συλλογή της Παγκόσμιο Κύπελλο, Euro και, πλέον, Nations League . Ο κεντρικός αμυντικός της ΑΕΚ , Ντομαγκόι Βίντα , έδωσε την θέση του στον Μάρτιν Έρλιτς στην βασική ενδεκάδα, στην μοναδική αλλαγή που έκανε ο Ζλάτκο Ντάλιτς σε σχέση με τον ημιτελικό απέναντι στην Ολλανδία. Με δύο αλλαγές σε σχέση με τον ημιτελικό κόντρα στην Ιταλία παρέταξε την ομάδα του ο Λουίς Ντε λα Φουέντε , με τον Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ αντί του Μίκελ Μερίνο στα χαφ και τον Μάρκο Ασένσιο αντί του Ροντρίγκο στην τριάδα πίσω από τον Άλβαρο Μοράτα . Πίεση ψηλά από τους Ισπανούς, μεγαλύτερος και καλύτερος έλεγχος της μπάλας από τους Κροάτες , οι οποίοι πάντως γλίτωσαν από το γκολ στο 12ο λεπτό, όταν ο Γκάβι μετά από κλέψιμο πλάσαρε ελάχιστα άουτ από το ύψος της μεγάλης περιοχής, ενώ είχε σε καλύτερη θέση στα δεξιά του τον Ασένσιο . Η Κροατία απάντησε με δύο τετ – α – τετ ευκαιρίες του Αντρέι Κράμαριτς μέσα σε δύο λεπτά (23’ και 24’), με τους κεντρικούς αμυντικούς της Ισπανίας να τον προλαβαίνουν προτού γίνει πραγματικά επικίνδυνος για την εστία του Ουνάι Σιμόν . Οι άμυνες, μετά από ένα αρκετά συντηρητικό 25λεπτο, άνοιξαν κάπως, με Ρόδρι και Ιβάν Πέρισιτς να απειλούν με κεφαλιές εκατέρωθεν και την Κροατία να περιορίζει σημαντικά την δράση του μέσου της Μάντσεστερ Σίτι και MVP του Champions League, κάτι που στοίχιζε στην Ισπανία. Μια κεφαλιά άουτ του Μοράτα έπειτα από ωραίο ομαδικό συνδυασμό ήταν η τελευταία άξια αναφοράς φάση σε ένα πολύ ισορροπημένο πρώτο ημίχρονο όπου οι δύο ομάδες ήταν ιδιαιτέρως προσεκτικές και έριξαν το βάρος στην άμυνα, παρά στην επίθεση. Χωρίς αλλαγές μπήκαν οι δύο ομάδες στο δεύτερο μέρος, με την Κροατία να αγγίζει το γκολ στο 51ο λεπτό όταν, μετά από εξαιρετική ενέργεια και σέντρα του Πέρισιτς , ο Γιόσιπ Γιουράνοβιτς μέσα από την περιοχή σούταρε πολύ διαγώνια άουτ. Οι Ισπανοί απάντησαν με κεφαλιά άουτ του Ασένσιο από καλή θέση ύστερα από σέντρα του Τζόρντι Άλμπα (56’), ο Μάριο Πάσαλιτς είχε επίσης κεφαλιά άουτ λίγο αργότερα (60’), στην τελευταία του ενέργεια προτού δώσει την θέση του στον ήρωα του ημιτελικού, Μπρούνο Πέτκοβιτς . Οι Βαλκάνιοι έδιναν μεγαλύτερη αίσθηση κινδύνου στις επιθέσεις τους, με τον Ντε λα Φουέντε να ψάχνει αντίδραση με δύο αλλαγές, ρίχνοντας στη μάχη τον Ανσού Φατί και τον «χρυσό» σκόρερ του ημιτελικού Χοσέλου, αντί των Γιέρεμι Πίνο και Μοράτα αντίστοιχα. Μακρινό πλασέ άουτ του Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ προ κενής εστίας ύστερα από έξοδο και διώξιμο του Ντόμινικ Λιβάκοβιτς προ του Φατί (75’), σουτ άουτ του Ασένσιο λίγο αργότερα για μια Ισπανία που είχε πάρει λίγο τα πάνω της μετά από ένα μάλλον παθητικό πρώτο μέρος στην επανάληψη. Νέα διπλή αλλαγή του Ντε λα Φουέντε , η μια υποχρεωτική λόγω ενοχλήσεων του Ρομπέν Λε Νορμάντ , με τον Νάτσο να τον αντικαθιστά και τον Μερίνο να παίρνει την θέση του κουρασμένου Φαμπιάν Ρουίθ , την ώρα που ο Ντάλιτς έκανε την δεύτερη κίνησή του με τον Νίκολα Βλάσιτς αντί του Λούκα Ιβανούσεκ . Στο 84’, οι ανεβασμένοι Ίβηρες έχασαν μοναδική ευκαιρία για να ανοίξουν το σκορ και να κάνουν άλμα για την κατάκτηση του τροπαίου, όταν μετά από πολύ ωραίο συνδυασμό Άλμπα – Μερίνο η μπάλα έφτασε στον Φατί μέσα στην περιοχή, αλλά το σουτ του επιθετικού της Μπαρτσελόνα σταμάτησε πάνω στον Πέρισιτς , λίγο πριν από την γραμμή της εστίας. Ο Ντε λα Φουέντε αποφάσισε να ρισκάρει με την είσοδο του Ντάνι Όλμο αντί του Γκάβι για να κάνει ακόμα πιο επιθετική την ομάδα του, με τον Ασένσιο να σουτάρει διαγώνιο άουτ μέσα από την περιοχή, ύστερα από εξαιρετική μπαλιά του αιεθαλούς Νάβας . Ο Ντάλιτς έψαξε μεγαλύτερη δημιουργικότητα με την είσοδο του Λόβρο Μάγιερ αντί του Κράμαριτς ενόψει, ουσιαστικά, της παράτασης, στην οποία οδηγήθηκε το ματς, όπως συνέβη και στο τελευταίο ραντεβού των δύο ομάδων, στους «16» του Euro2020 . Εκείνο το παιχνίδι, βεβαίως, ήταν 3-3 μετά το 90λεπτο και έληξε 5-3 υπέρ των Ισπανών μετά το έξτρα ημίωρο… Ο Ρόδρι δεν είχε άλλες ανάσες (κατέβασε ακόμα και τις κάλτσες του...), αλλά ο Ντε λα Φουέντε υποχρεώθηκε να αντικαταστήσει τον εξαντλημένο Νάβας στη διάρκεια της παράτασης, στην οποία ο Νάτσο με αυτοθυσία πρόλαβε τον Μάγιερ προτού αυτός σουτάρει, με αποτέλεσμα να τραυματιστεί και να παίξει χωλαίνοντας στη συνέχεια. Η εκατέρωθεν κούραση άνοιξε διαδρόμους και παραλίγο να τους εκμεταλλευτεί ο Ντάνι Όλμο , ο οποίος σούταρε ψηλά άουτ από πολύ καλή θέση (104’), σε μια παράταση που μάλλον ευνόησε την Κροατία , αφού στην τελική ευθεία του 90λεπτου η Ισπανία ήταν ανώτερη. Ο Μαρσέλο Μπρόζοβιτς σούταρε πέφτοντας για να μπλοκάρει ο Σιμόν , ο Ντάνι Όλμο άγγιξε ξανά το γκολ σε σουτ μέσα από την περιοχή που κόντραρε σε αντίπαλο και πήγε κόρνερ, με τις δύο ομάδες να «επιλέγουν» εντέλει να πάει ο τελικός στα πέναλτι, ρισκάροντας ελάχιστα στα τελευταία λεπτά. Πριν από την διαδικασία από την άσπρη βούλα, υπήρξε έντασση και μια μικρή… κλοτσοπατινάδα (!) στην οποία συμμετείχε και ο Βίντα, χωρίς πάντως να… ξεφύγει η κατάσταση. Στα πέναλτι, ο Ουνάι Σιμόν εξελίχθηκε σε ήρωα των Ιβήρων, απέκρουσε τα σουτ των Μάγιερ και Πέτκοβιτς, ο Αϊμερίκ Λαπόρτ έστειλε το δικό του στο οριζόντιο δοκάρι και ο Ντάνι Καρβαχάλ , με εκτέλεση α λα Πανένκα , έστεψε την Ισπανία. Η σκηνή του τελικού, βεβαίως, οι Ισπανοί παίκτες της Ρεάλ Μαδρίτης που έσπευσαν να παρηγορήσουν τον Λούκα Μόντριτς , ο οποίος δεν μπόρεσε για άλλη μια φορά να σηκώσει έναν τίτλο με την απίθανη παρέα του...

Chasing their first-ever major trophy and possibly a last dance for and a team that has finished second and third at the last two World Cups, failed to pull off their trademark route to tournament glory of simply outlasting their opponent in a match of pure attrition. Lovro Majer and Bruno Petkovic both saw their penalties saved by goalkeeper Simon and, although spurned Spain’s first match point, stepped up to seal La Roja’s first triumph in the competition. After the drama of both semi-finals and the five-goal play-off that Italy won earlier in the day to take third place, it was perhaps not surprising that it was the final that delivered a more tense affair. In truth, it was a game that had penalties written all over it from very early on. SPONSORED Both teams reeled out the classics; Croatia doggedly organised and sensibly biding their time without any concern at going the distance, Spain most at ease when calmly passing the ball with maximum patience as they looked to craft an immaculate breakthrough goal. A slow start was punctured by Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic dropping a straightforward cross onto his post, before the offside Alvaro Morata failed to pounce on the rebound. Another mistake from Zlatko Dalic’s side handed Gavi an opportunity to shoot from 18 yards, an effort he dragged wide, before Aymeric Laporte did superbly to deny Andrej Kramaric a shooting chance with a break up the other end. In the second half, it wasn’t until the latter stages that La Roja looked the most likely side to grab the go-ahead goal. Ansu Fati’s pace terrorised Croatia’s defenders after he came off the bench and fine work from Jordi Alba helped tee up the Barcelona youngster with five minutes left, only for his stab goalwards to be turned off the line by Ivan Perisic. Extra time saw Dani Olmo fire over the bar from a central position as Spain continued to waste decent chances in front of goal. Croatia’s shootout defeat leaves a question mark over Modric’s international future, although it will hardly be a surprise if he opts for a final shot at glory in next summer’s Euros - when he’ll be 38 and coming off the back of likely his last season at Real Madrid. For Spain, Luis de la Fuente has come through a rocky start to life in the dugout with a perhaps surprising piece of silverware as they kickstart a new era in fine fashion.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 21:55:23","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/06/18/22/1499557600.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Transfer news LIVE!

Among the teams tracking Ramos’ situation are Manchester United, Tottenham, West Ham and Newcastle, so say The Sun. Emile Smith Rowe has vowed to fight for his Arsenal career after rumours of a move away. Mikel Arteta wants to keep the midfielder at the Emirates next season despite interest from Brighton. “Arsenal are my club and I’m not going to give up until [Arteta] says he doesn’t want me,” he told The Times. “But that’s not the case. He wants me as part of the team and I want to fight for my place and get back in the team.” Leicester want a speedy resolution to the speculation over James Maddison’s future. Newcastle and Tottenham are both unwilling to meet the Foxes’ price tag, according to Northern Echo. Maddison will cost £60m even though his contract expires in a year’s time.

The Nerazzurri have seen a loan bid for the Belgian striker rejected after he spent this season on a temporary deal back at the Giuseppe Meazza. Inter also want Kalidou Koulibaly on loan next year.

With only a year left on his PSG contract, the Frenchman told Telefoot that he is calm over his future. “I have already said that I will stay at Paris Saint-Germain Germain and I said it before all this happened,” he stated. “Next year I'll play for PSG, that's what I said. There are many things that can happen in a year, especially in a club like PSG.” Kylian Mbappe addresses the French media ahead of Euro 2024 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Greece Inter Milan have been warned not to sell Nicolo Barella to Chelsea. Newcastle are also keen on the Italian midfielder, and a sale would be greeted with fury by Inter’s ultras. They have posted a group message to social media making clear their anger at any potential exit, writing of Barella: “Interista born, present and future. Untouchable.” Arsenal are ready to cash in on Thomas Partey. With Granit Xhaka set to leave for Bayer Leverkusen and Mikel Arteta eyeing new midfielders, the Ghanaian may be next to head for pastures new. The Telegraph report on Arsenal being ready to listen to offers if a replacement can be found. Declan Rice and Romeo Lavia are both sought after by the Gunners. Erik ten Hag is reportedly furious that Manchester United’s takeover has held up his transfer plans. The Glazers continue to dither over whether to sell the club to Jim Ratcliffe or Sheikh Jassim, with a solution not expected until after the start of next season. United are said by The Sun to have wanted Declan Rice, but now look set to miss out on him to Arsenal or Manchester City. Kyle Walker is in talks to sign for Bayern Munich. Having been left out of Manchester City’s line-up for the Champions League final, the England defender is ready to try his luck elsewhere. Sky Germany say no agreement has been reached between Bayern, Walker and City yet but Thomas Tuchel’s presence in Bavaria is helping to persuade him to join.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 21:53:58","image_url":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/06/15/08/pltransfer150523v1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"standarduk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Μέσι: «Έχω πετύχει τα πάντα στο ποδόσφαιρο, δεν μένει κάτι άλλο»","link":"https://www.gazzetta.gr/football/mls/2231704/mesi-eho-petyhei-ta-panta-sto-podosfairo-den-menei-kati-allo","keywords":["Ποδόσφαιρο","Αργεντινή","Newsroom","MLS","Ίντερ Μαϊάμι"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Μία μεγάλη συνέντευξη παραχώρησε ο Λιονέλ Μέσι, η οποία θα δημοσιευθεί στις 24/06, όπου φαίνεται να λέει ότι έχει πετύχει τα πάντα στο ποδόσφαιρο.","content":"Μία νέα πρόκληση ετοιμάζεται να αντιμετωπίσει ο Λιονέλ Μέσι καθώς θα αφήσει για πρώτη φορά την Ευρώπη για το πρωτάθλημα του MLS όπου θα αγωνίζεται από τη νέα σεζόν με την Ίντερ Μαϊάμι.
