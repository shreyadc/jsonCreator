The striker is a target for several of Europe‚Äôs top clubs and has been strongly . Kane has always been in the transfer window, but United have not entered into negotiations with Tottenham Hotspur this summer. Advertisement Advertisement Spurs would much prefer, if Kane were to leave, that he joins a foreign side rather than strengthen a Premier League rival, while the difficulties of dealing with Daniel Levy have also prevented United from making a concentrated effort to sign Kane this window. There has also been a sense that any negotiations with Spurs would be drawn out and infuriating, while Ten Hag wants the club to wrap up their business in the market as quickly as possible. United had, prior to the summer, identified the capture of a top-quality centre-forward as their primary transfer aim, although the signatures of Mason Mount and Andre Onana have been secured first. With Kane and Victor Osimhen deemed unattainable, to Atlanta forward Rasmus Hojlund, but the fresh reports of Kane‚Äôs availability may see the Red Devils stall on that particular venture, for a few days at least. As per , Levy has been told by Tottenham‚Äôs majority owner Joe Lewis that the club cannot allow their record scorer to leave for free next summer. Kane has less than a year remaining on his current contract and it was believed Levy was willing to let him depart for nothing at the end of 2023/24, rather than sell this window. However, Lewis has reportedly baulked at the prospect of Spurs turning down around ¬£100m for the England captain, while Kane has not accepted a new deal from Tottenham this summer. The Guardian add that a major stumbling block to an Old Trafford move could be the attacker‚Äôs wage demands, which are in the region of ¬£30m a year.

Previously, Mail Sport reported on claims that the German giants would let Goretzka, 28, leave for the right price, after five years with the Bavarian club, with Erik ten Hag 's Red Devils at the front of the queue to sign him up. But the midfielder has openly declared his love for Bayern Munich in a strong statement to German media, and insisted that he is going nowhere. Sky Germany asked Goretzka about this summer's exit rumours, leaving the 28-year-old to reply: 'I have no intention to leave Bayern. I love the club, I love the city, I love the fans.' It was thought that Bayern would accept an offer as low as ¬£34m to let Goretzka leave the Allianz Arena during the transfer window, but it seems that the German international is staying put in Munich. Leon Goretzka said he has 'no intention' of leaving Bayern Munich despite Man United interest The German midfielder joined the club in 2018, and is contracted to Bayern until June 2026 Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel cannot guarantee Goretzka's place in the team next season Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel cannot guarantee Goretzka's role moving forward, as the squad undergoes a revamp ahead of his first full season on the touchline. Tuchel is expected to start with Joshua Kimmich and Konrad Laimer in central midfield, raising doubts over Goretzka's future, despite being contracted to the club until June 2026. Goretzka made 40 club appearances last season in all competitions, but experienced limited time on the pitch in the season's final few weeks. The 28-year-old has 34 goals in 179 matches for Bayern Munich since joining from Bundesliga rivals Schalke in 2018. In those years, he has won five Bundesliga titles and the Champions League title in 2020. Manchester United will have to find another way to strengthen their midfield after Goretzka's commitment to the German champions. It was previously thought that the Red Devils could bring in the German international's experience to replace Scott McTominay or Fred, who have both been connected with exit rumours, but they will need to find other affordable options.

The sportswear giant claims the eye-catching strip has been pieced together to celebrate United's 'storied past' and embrace a 'fresh, modern look'. Its vertical stripes are a nod back to the club's early years, with the pattern last seen two decades ago, while the kit has also drawn inspiration from the city. United's alternative strips at the start of the 20th century often featured stripes of various colours, with green and gold and blue and white proving popular. And the green has now made a surprise return for Erik ten Hag's second campaign in charge, offering a fresh interpretation on an Old Trafford throwback.

The dark green base is said to represent the urban landscape at the heart of the sprawling city, with the design completed by a crew-neck collar. In addition, the shirt is crafted from 100 per cent recycled materials. The on-field version of the jersey features HEAT.RDY technology, allowing United's players to stay cool during their matches across multiple fronts next season. For the supporters, the kit alternative uses AEROREADY, technology similarly designed to help keep the body dry and comfortable. A host of United's players have modelled the design , with the likes of Marcus Rashford, captain Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro front and centre. United often sported vertical stripes but a similar pattern has not been worn for two decades Lisandro Martinez was among the group of players to model the strip for its official release United will wear the away design for the first time when they face Wrexham as part of their tour of the US on July 25, although fringe names are set to feature. The kit is available to buy from United's club stores and selected adidas retailers. An adidas spokesperson said: 'We're incredibly excited to return to a design that is fundamental to the heritage of this great club. 'Vertical stripes are in the DNA of Manchester United, and we hope this bold new look captures the imaginations of fans as they travel the globe supporting the team. 'We have intentionally taken cues from the city itself, to provide both the players and travelling fans with a piece of home, wherever they are wearing it.'

Tresor caught the eye in the Jupiler Pro League last season, having scored eight goals and registered 24 assists from his 42 appearances. Unsurprisingly, his performances have attracted interest ahead of the new campaign and Brentford, looking to build on their ninth-placed finish , are keen.

El primer tiempo termin√≥ sin goles y fue bastante cerrado. Argentina tuvo la primera chance al minuto de juego, con una pelota que Mariana Larroquette encontr√≥ en el aire y se desvi√≥ por muy poco.

The add-ons keep coming; ¬£250,000 if he starts more than half of Tottenham‚Äôs Premier League games in his first two seasons and another ¬£250,000 if Tottenham qualify for Europe and Phillips plays half of the games.

The striker is a target for several of Europe‚Äôs top clubs and has been strongly . Kane has always been in the transfer window, but United have not entered into negotiations with Tottenham Hotspur this summer. Advertisement Advertisement Spurs would much prefer, if Kane were to leave, that he joins a foreign side rather than strengthen a Premier League rival, while the difficulties of dealing with Daniel Levy have also prevented United from making a concentrated effort to sign Kane this window. There has also been a sense that any negotiations with Spurs would be drawn out and infuriating, while Ten Hag wants the club to wrap up their business in the market as quickly as possible. United had, prior to the summer, identified the capture of a top-quality centre-forward as their primary transfer aim, although the signatures of Mason Mount and Andre Onana have been secured first. With Kane and Victor Osimhen deemed unattainable, to Atlanta forward Rasmus Hojlund, but the fresh reports of Kane‚Äôs availability may see the Red Devils stall on that particular venture, for a few days at least. As per , Levy has been told by Tottenham‚Äôs majority owner Joe Lewis that the club cannot allow their record scorer to leave for free next summer. Kane has less than a year remaining on his current contract and it was believed Levy was willing to let him depart for nothing at the end of 2023/24, rather than sell this window. However, Lewis has reportedly baulked at the prospect of Spurs turning down around ¬£100m for the England captain, while Kane has not accepted a new deal from Tottenham this summer. The Guardian add that a major stumbling block to an Old Trafford move could be the attacker‚Äôs wage demands, which are in the region of ¬£30m a year.

Previously, Mail Sport reported on claims that the German giants would let Goretzka, 28, leave for the right price, after five years with the Bavarian club, with Erik ten Hag 's Red Devils at the front of the queue to sign him up. But the midfielder has openly declared his love for Bayern Munich in a strong statement to German media, and insisted that he is going nowhere. Sky Germany asked Goretzka about this summer's exit rumours, leaving the 28-year-old to reply: 'I have no intention to leave Bayern. I love the club, I love the city, I love the fans.' It was thought that Bayern would accept an offer as low as ¬£34m to let Goretzka leave the Allianz Arena during the transfer window, but it seems that the German international is staying put in Munich. Leon Goretzka said he has 'no intention' of leaving Bayern Munich despite Man United interest The German midfielder joined the club in 2018, and is contracted to Bayern until June 2026 Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel cannot guarantee Goretzka's place in the team next season Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel cannot guarantee Goretzka's role moving forward, as the squad undergoes a revamp ahead of his first full season on the touchline. Tuchel is expected to start with Joshua Kimmich and Konrad Laimer in central midfield, raising doubts over Goretzka's future, despite being contracted to the club until June 2026. Goretzka made 40 club appearances last season in all competitions, but experienced limited time on the pitch in the season's final few weeks. The 28-year-old has 34 goals in 179 matches for Bayern Munich since joining from Bundesliga rivals Schalke in 2018. In those years, he has won five Bundesliga titles and the Champions League title in 2020. Manchester United will have to find another way to strengthen their midfield after Goretzka's commitment to the German champions. It was previously thought that the Red Devils could bring in the German international's experience to replace Scott McTominay or Fred, who have both been connected with exit rumours, but they will need to find other affordable options.

The sportswear giant claims the eye-catching strip has been pieced together to celebrate United's 'storied past' and embrace a 'fresh, modern look'. Its vertical stripes are a nod back to the club's early years, with the pattern last seen two decades ago, while the kit has also drawn inspiration from the city. United's alternative strips at the start of the 20th century often featured stripes of various colours, with green and gold and blue and white proving popular. And the green has now made a surprise return for Erik ten Hag's second campaign in charge, offering a fresh interpretation on an Old Trafford throwback.

The dark green base is said to represent the urban landscape at the heart of the sprawling city, with the design completed by a crew-neck collar. In addition, the shirt is crafted from 100 per cent recycled materials. The on-field version of the jersey features HEAT.RDY technology, allowing United's players to stay cool during their matches across multiple fronts next season. For the supporters, the kit alternative uses AEROREADY, technology similarly designed to help keep the body dry and comfortable. A host of United's players have modelled the design , with the likes of Marcus Rashford, captain Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro front and centre. United often sported vertical stripes but a similar pattern has not been worn for two decades Lisandro Martinez was among the group of players to model the strip for its official release United will wear the away design for the first time when they face Wrexham as part of their tour of the US on July 25, although fringe names are set to feature. The kit is available to buy from United's club stores and selected adidas retailers. An adidas spokesperson said: 'We're incredibly excited to return to a design that is fundamental to the heritage of this great club. 'Vertical stripes are in the DNA of Manchester United, and we hope this bold new look captures the imaginations of fans as they travel the globe supporting the team. 'We have intentionally taken cues from the city itself, to provide both the players and travelling fans with a piece of home, wherever they are wearing it.'

Tresor caught the eye in the Jupiler Pro League last season, having scored eight goals and registered 24 assists from his 42 appearances. Unsurprisingly, his performances have attracted interest ahead of the new campaign and Brentford, looking to build on their ninth-placed finish , are keen.

El primer tiempo termin√≥ sin goles y fue bastante cerrado. Argentina tuvo la primera chance al minuto de juego, con una pelota que Mariana Larroquette encontr√≥ en el aire y se desvi√≥ por muy poco.

That is according to , who claim that Tottenham are ‚Äòstunned‚Äô by Blackburn‚Äôs asking price. It‚Äôs suggested that Tottenham were under the impression that they could sign defender Phillips for around ¬£2million plus add-ons. Reports from the just a few days ago suggested that a medical was imminent for Phillips with Spurs on the verge of a deal. There has been no deal just yet though and The Sun claim that Blackburn are asking for more than expected. Blackburn‚Äôs demands are described as ‚Äòextraordinary‚Äô with a guaranteed ¬£5million wanted inside two years with a hefty chunk up front. Rovers are then seeking a raft of add-ons, including ¬£150,000 when he gets his first Tottenham start. Should Phillips become a regular starter at Tottenham, then the package rises to ¬£6.5million. The add-ons keep coming; ¬£250,000 if he starts more than half of Tottenham‚Äôs Premier League games in his first two seasons and another ¬£250,000 if Tottenham qualify for Europe and Phillips plays half of the games. Rovers also want ¬£500,000 if Phillips wins the Premier League or Champions League with Tottenham and another ¬£1.45million depending on international appearances. With all of Rovers‚Äô demands involved, the fee could reach around ¬£9.45million in the future. That‚Äôs a huge increase on the fee initially expected and corroborate that a ‚Äòhefty‚Äô amount of add-ons are stalling the deal. Phillips is a huge talent and could be a star of the future for Tottenham. Spurs must now determine whether they want to potentially be on the hook for nearly ¬£10million down the line, when they thought the deal would be about a third of that price.","pubDate":"2023-07-24 08:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"hitc","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"French Footballer‚Äôs Union Criticises PSG, Threatens to Take Legal Action Against Ligue 1 Giants for Dropping Kylian Mbappe From Asia Tour Squad","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/football/french-footballers-union-criticises-psg-threatens-to-take-legal-action-against-ligue-1-giants-for-dropping-kylian-mbappe-from-asia-tour-squad-5288067.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Paris Saint-Germain has dropped their record-goal scorer Kylian Mbappe from the pre-season squad for their tour to Japan.","content":"Kylian Mbappe is one of the most popular in the current generation and the mastery the 24-year-old has shown on the football ground is second to none.

Kane has always been in the transfer window, but United have not entered into negotiations with Tottenham Hotspur this summer. Advertisement Advertisement Spurs would much prefer, if Kane were to leave, that he joins a foreign side rather than strengthen a Premier League rival, while the difficulties of dealing with Daniel Levy have also prevented United from making a concentrated effort to sign Kane this window. There has also been a sense that any negotiations with Spurs would be drawn out and infuriating, while Ten Hag wants the club to wrap up their business in the market as quickly as possible. United had, prior to the summer, identified the capture of a top-quality centre-forward as their primary transfer aim, although the signatures of Mason Mount and Andre Onana have been secured first. With Kane and Victor Osimhen deemed unattainable, to Atlanta forward Rasmus Hojlund, but the fresh reports of Kane‚Äôs availability may see the Red Devils stall on that particular venture, for a few days at least. As per , Levy has been told by Tottenham‚Äôs majority owner Joe Lewis that the club cannot allow their record scorer to leave for free next summer. Kane has less than a year remaining on his current contract and it was believed Levy was willing to let him depart for nothing at the end of 2023/24, rather than sell this window. However, Lewis has reportedly baulked at the prospect of Spurs turning down around ¬£100m for the England captain, while Kane has not accepted a new deal from Tottenham this summer.

Previously, Mail Sport reported on claims that the German giants would let Goretzka, 28, leave for the right price, after five years with the Bavarian club, with Erik ten Hag 's Red Devils at the front of the queue to sign him up. But the midfielder has openly declared his love for Bayern Munich in a strong statement to German media, and insisted that he is going nowhere. Sky Germany asked Goretzka about this summer's exit rumours, leaving the 28-year-old to reply: 'I have no intention to leave Bayern. I love the club, I love the city, I love the fans.' It was thought that Bayern would accept an offer as low as ¬£34m to let Goretzka leave the Allianz Arena during the transfer window, but it seems that the German international is staying put in Munich. Leon Goretzka said he has 'no intention' of leaving Bayern Munich despite Man United interest The German midfielder joined the club in 2018, and is contracted to Bayern until June 2026 Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel cannot guarantee Goretzka's place in the team next season Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel cannot guarantee Goretzka's role moving forward, as the squad undergoes a revamp ahead of his first full season on the touchline. Tuchel is expected to start with Joshua Kimmich and Konrad Laimer in central midfield, raising doubts over Goretzka's future, despite being contracted to the club until June 2026. Goretzka made 40 club appearances last season in all competitions, but experienced limited time on the pitch in the season's final few weeks. The 28-year-old has 34 goals in 179 matches for Bayern Munich since joining from Bundesliga rivals Schalke in 2018. In those years, he has won five Bundesliga titles and the Champions League title in 2020. Manchester United will have to find another way to strengthen their midfield after Goretzka's commitment to the German champions. It was previously thought that the Red Devils could bring in the German international's experience to replace Scott McTominay or Fred, who have both been connected with exit rumours, but they will need to find other affordable options.

The sportswear giant claims the eye-catching strip has been pieced together to celebrate United's 'storied past' and embrace a 'fresh, modern look'. Its vertical stripes are a nod back to the club's early years, with the pattern last seen two decades ago, while the kit has also drawn inspiration from the city. United's alternative strips at the start of the 20th century often featured stripes of various colours, with green and gold and blue and white proving popular. And the green has now made a surprise return for Erik ten Hag's second campaign in charge, offering a fresh interpretation on an Old Trafford throwback.

The dark green base is said to represent the urban landscape at the heart of the sprawling city, with the design completed by a crew-neck collar. In addition, the shirt is crafted from 100 per cent recycled materials. The on-field version of the jersey features HEAT.RDY technology, allowing United's players to stay cool during their matches across multiple fronts next season. For the supporters, the kit alternative uses AEROREADY, technology similarly designed to help keep the body dry and comfortable. A host of United's players have modelled the design , with the likes of Marcus Rashford, captain Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro front and centre. United often sported vertical stripes but a similar pattern has not been worn for two decades Lisandro Martinez was among the group of players to model the strip for its official release United will wear the away design for the first time when they face Wrexham as part of their tour of the US on July 25, although fringe names are set to feature. The kit is available to buy from United's club stores and selected adidas retailers. An adidas spokesperson said: 'We're incredibly excited to return to a design that is fundamental to the heritage of this great club. 'Vertical stripes are in the DNA of Manchester United, and we hope this bold new look captures the imaginations of fans as they travel the globe supporting the team. 'We have intentionally taken cues from the city itself, to provide both the players and travelling fans with a piece of home, wherever they are wearing it.'

The club are planning to strengthen Thomas Frank's squad this summer and have set their sights on Tresor, a full-fledged international for Belgium. Indeed, it is believed that the 24-year-old playmaker is a target and a discussion is understood to have been held over the potential signing. Tresor caught the eye in the Jupiler Pro League last season, having scored eight goals and registered 24 assists from his 42 appearances. Unsurprisingly, his performances have attracted interest ahead of the new campaign and Brentford, looking to build on their ninth-placed finish , are keen. Brentford are understood to have spoken to Genk over midfielder Mike Tresor (pictured) Tresor (left) caught the eye in the Jupiler Pro League last season and may move on this summer He is tied down to a contract that runs until 2025 but Genk may be open to selling.

Cristiana Girelli fue la goleadora en las europeas.","content":"Foto: Juli√°n Alvarez El seleccionado argentino perdi√≥ 1 a 0 frente a Italia en su debut del Mundial Femenino de la FIFA, por el Grupo G, en el Eden Park de Auckland, con un gol sobre el final que convirti√≥ la capitana Cristiana Girelli poco despu√©s de ingresar desde el banco. El equipo de Germ√°n Portanova, n√∫mero 28 del ranking FIFA, dej√≥ todo en el encuentro ante las duras europeas (16¬∞) pero sufri√≥ los ataques de su rival, en especial en el complemento, y no logr√≥ sumar puntos frente a 30.889 espectadores. El primer tiempo termin√≥ sin goles y fue bastante cerrado. Argentina tuvo la primera chance al minuto de juego, con una pelota que Mariana Larroquette encontr√≥ en el aire y se desvi√≥ por muy poco. Italia complic√≥ con los centros de Lisa Boattin, aunque la defensa estaba firme y la arquera Correa tambi√©n para sacar con los pu√±os varios tiros. Foto: Juli√°n Alvarez Banini la llev√≥ repetidas veces por la banda izquierda, gambete√≥, no se la pod√≠an sacar. Bonsegundo, cerca, las peleaba todas tambi√©n. El juego asociado de Argentina se gener√≥ por ese lado, con el buen trabajo de Lorena Ben√≠tez, segura en los pases y en la marca para la Argentina, aunque Italia se cerr√≥ bien. Bonansea por derecha y Dragoni m√°s al medio buscaron a Arianna Caruso y crearon peligro frente al arco de Correa. Italia, inclusive, convirti√≥ dos goles (uno Caruso y otro Giacinti) pero ambos fueron correctamente anulados por fuera de juego. La hinchada argentina, con bombos, se hac√≠a escuchar en el Eden Park. En la pantalla gigante del estadio se pudo ver a Gianni Infantino, presidente de la FIFA. Claudio Tapia, presidente de la AFA, lleg√≥ el s√°bado para acompa√±ar al seleccionado. Una espectadora de lujo fue la actriz Natalie Portman, una de las due√±as del Angel City Football Club de la liga estadounidense de f√∫tbol. Estados Unidos, las actuales bicampeonas del mundo, tambi√©n tuvieron su debut en Auckland, con goleada 3-0 ante Vietnam. Foto: Juli√°n Alvarez Con pelota parada o presionando, Banini y Bonsegundo fueron las protagonistas de la posesi√≥n y las llegadas que tuvo el equipo de Portanova. Romina N√∫√±ez gener√≥ un tiro libre a los 3 minutos de la segunda mitad. El remate de St√°bile, de gran segundo tiempo, casi se le mete por arriba a la arquera Durante. Italia tambi√©n tuvo varios tiros libres a favor, busc√≥ por izquierda y por el centro, se adelant√≥ en la campo y pate√≥ al arco desde afuera. Mientras en el estadio hubo una \"ola\" que dur√≥ como tres vueltas y la batucada argentina segu√≠a sonando en la tribuna del arco defendido por Correa. \"Se mueve para ac√°, se mueve para all√°, esta es la banda m√°s loca que hay. Argentina, Argentina\", baj√≥ desde esa popular. \"Italia, Italia\", respondieron los espectadores italianos, menos ruidosos. Foto: Juli√°n Alvarez Ahora cantan \"Muchachos\" mientras Giuliano patea un tiro libre desde cerca del √°rea que pasa apenas por encima del travesa√±o. Argentina intent√≥ por derecha y hubo otra falta a N√∫√±ez. La zurda St√°bile volvi√≥ a patear fuerte al arco, Durante rechaz√≥, la pelota le rebot√≥ en el cuerpo a Larroquette y se fue al lado del palo. Italia tuvo algunas chances pero ven√≠a bien controlada por las argentinas hasta que, a los 4 minutos de haber ingresado, la capitana Cristiana Girelli, goleadora de la Juventus, puso el 1-0 con un cabezazo que se col√≥ por arriba de las manos de Correa. #ITA 1-0 #ARG | 41¬¥ ST | Gol de Italia.

En un partido cerrado, Italia se qued√≥ con los tres puntos y lidera el grupo junto a Suecia, que venci√≥ 2-1 a Sud√°frica. El pr√≥ximo rival de Argentina ser√° justamente el equipo africano este jueves, desde las 21 hora argentina, en la ciudad de Dunedin.

The post Report: Tottenham stunned as expected signing stalls, will now cost much more than first thought appeared first on HITC.","content":"Blackburn Rovers are standing firm on their valuation of teenager amid interest from Tottenham Hotspur. That is according to , who claim that Tottenham are ‚Äòstunned‚Äô by Blackburn‚Äôs asking price. It‚Äôs suggested that Tottenham were under the impression that they could sign defender Phillips for around ¬£2million plus add-ons. Reports from the just a few days ago suggested that a medical was imminent for Phillips with Spurs on the verge of a deal. There has been no deal just yet though and The Sun claim that Blackburn are asking for more than expected. Blackburn‚Äôs demands are described as ‚Äòextraordinary‚Äô with a guaranteed ¬£5million wanted inside two years with a hefty chunk up front. Rovers are then seeking a raft of add-ons, including ¬£150,000 when he gets his first Tottenham start. Should Phillips become a regular starter at Tottenham, then the package rises to ¬£6.5million. The add-ons keep coming; ¬£250,000 if he starts more than half of Tottenham‚Äôs Premier League games in his first two seasons and another ¬£250,000 if Tottenham qualify for Europe and Phillips plays half of the games. Rovers also want ¬£500,000 if Phillips wins the Premier League or Champions League with Tottenham and another ¬£1.45million depending on international appearances. With all of Rovers‚Äô demands involved, the fee could reach around ¬£9.45million in the future. That‚Äôs a huge increase on the fee initially expected and corroborate that a ‚Äòhefty‚Äô amount of add-ons are stalling the deal. Phillips is a huge talent and could be a star of the future for Tottenham. Spurs must now determine whether they want to potentially be on the hook for nearly ¬£10million down the line, when they thought the deal would be about a third of that price.","pubDate":"2023-07-24 08:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"hitc","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"French Footballer‚Äôs Union Criticises PSG, Threatens to Take Legal Action Against Ligue 1 Giants for Dropping Kylian Mbappe From Asia Tour Squad","link":"https://www.latestly.com/sports/football/french-footballers-union-criticises-psg-threatens-to-take-legal-action-against-ligue-1-giants-for-dropping-kylian-mbappe-from-asia-tour-squad-5288067.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Paris Saint-Germain has dropped their record-goal scorer Kylian Mbappe from the pre-season squad for their tour to Japan.","content":"Kylian Mbappe is one of the most popular in the current generation and the mastery the 24-year-old has shown on the football ground is second to none.

However, post his revelation, Parc des Princes are seeming desperate to sell him in a bid to receive a handsome fee in return for their top footballer. PSG has dropped Mbappe from their pre-season squad for their tour to Japan, emphasizing that the French captain either leave the club or agree to a contract extension.
