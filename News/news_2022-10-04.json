He has the option of a sabbatical during his new contract. A handy goal-kicker, Barrett further proved that versatility when he started in the All Blacks No.12 jersey for the first time in the Bledisloe Cup clash with Australia last month. He has also started tests at wing, fullback and first five-eighth. The Taranaki representative and 45-test All Black says he is grateful to extend his contract with the Hurricanes and is honoured to don the swirl once again. New Zealand's Jordie Barrett is airborne as he scores a try against Argentina. Photosport \"It's a privilege to have the opportunity to live and play rugby in New Zealand. That is a dream I've had since I was a young kid,\" said Barrett. \"I feel as though the Hurricanes franchise is in a really good place at the moment and I feel like the All Blacks are building towards something special.\" All Blacks head coach Ian Foster added: \"I'm delighted with Jordie's re-signing.\" \"He's become a massive part of our long-term plan. His commitment to New Zealand through till 2025 is fantastic news.\" Hurricanes CEO Avan Lee said he was a great outcome to have Barrett locked into the entire deal in the capital. His older brother Beauden left the Hurricanes for the Blues when he signed his current deal in 2019. \"It's a great outcome for us. We don't every year want to be worrying Jordie [leaving]. It's really cool to have him locked for three years,\" Lee said. Lee also confirmed with NZME that Jordie Barrett's new deal does include a possible sabbatical. \"It is an option. It has to be balanced with someone like Ardie as well. We don't want to lose two players in one year but there's no guarantee around sabbatical, it comes down to negotiation between New Zealand Rugby, ourselves and the player and his agent. Naturally there is some appeal to have sabbaticals within the World Cup cycle but we'll cross the bridge when we come to it. If Jordie's really keen to do it and get away for a season of Super Rugby, well we'll naturally have an open mind to that,\" he added. Born into a rugby-mad family, the 25-year-old is one of eight siblings which include fellow All Blacks Beauden and Scott. Their father, Kevin \"Smiley\" Barrett, played 167 games for Taranaki and played for the Hurricanes. A talented fast bowler in cricket, Barrett had been tagged for big things as a student at New Plymouth's Francis Douglas Memorial College. He chose rugby and headed south to Lincoln University to study commerce. In 2016, after just one season of domestic rugby, Barrett toured as an apprentice with the All Blacks to the Northern Hemisphere. The following year saw Barrett burst onto the Super Rugby scene, playing 17 games and scoring 135 points in his debut season before being selected for the All Blacks. Hurricanes head coach, Jason Holland, is thrilled to secure Barrett as the Hurricanes prepare for the Super Rugby Pacific season in 2023. \"Great to have Jordie commit to the Canes. He has grown into a key leader for our group on and off the field,\" Holland said. \"Playing some of his best rugby last year at both 12 and 15 and we expect him to be even better in the next few years.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-03 19:22:36","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/bh1mkhcf/jordie-barrett-has-signed-a-new-deal-with-new-zealand-rugby-photosport.jpg","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Schlange sorgt für Unterbrechung bei Cricket-Länderspiel","link":"https://www.spiegel.de/sport/schlange-sorgt-fuer-unterbrechung-bei-cricket-laenderspiel-a-39da728f-fb9f-491c-aa85-0097faebac6d#ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Beim Aufeinandertreffen im Twenty20 Cricket zwischen Indien und Südafrika kam es zu mehreren ungeplanten Stopps.

From batters sneaking extra runs to fielders throwing it beyond the boundary ropes, there has been no dearth of comedy even as teams battle hard for supremacy. And European Cricket League clips have become a rage on social media and streaming platforms in the recent past for funny on-field incidents. As it turned out, another video, this time from the ongoing European Cricket Championship is cracking up fans on social media. In a widely-shared clip, a batter can be seen punching his partner's face after a failed bid to complete a fist bump. The batter can be seen looking away from the non-striker while accidentally jabbing the helmet. The non-striker, who didn't expect the turn of events, can be seen standing in a state of shock.

Having said that, team India have also managed to post the two highest totals in the tournament so far at this very pitch while batting first. All in all, the pitch still has in it for the batters, but the lack of firepower in some of the teams have overall made it a low-scoring tournament thus far. Furthermore, the bowlers will have an extra advantage with each match taking place at this venue, as the pitch will tend to slow down due to wear and tear.

While Suryakumar is firing on all cylinders, Rizwan is also enjoying the top form that has seen him amass five fifties in seven innings. However, a runout could have cost Suryakumar a place at the top of the T20I batters ranking. The ICC rankings are determined by several factors that contribute to player rankings every Wednesday. The factors used to determine the batters’ rankings are – As things stand, Rizwan had an off day after he was dismissed for just one run against England while Surya was scoring for fun as he amassed 61 off just 22 deliveries. According to the ICC algorithm that determines the standings, Suryakumar is superior to Rizwan in four of the five categories mentioned. However, a run-out on the first ball of the 19th over could turn out to be a huge factor as Surya will miss out on valuable points for getting dismissed. While there is a 60-point gap between the Rizwan and Suryakumar, the gap could be reduced on Tuesday when India take on South Africa in the final T20I. If Surya does play, he will be expected to breach the gap and reduce it significantly but if he misses out on the top spot the runout could prove to be the Achilles heel for him. Tuesday’s encounter will be Suryakumar’s final T20I (if he plays) before the T20 World Cup. While India will play both Australia and New Zealand in the warm-up, those matches won’t be counted in the ICC rankings. On the bigger picture, Rizwan will have a minimum of four and a maximum of five matches in the tri-series in New Zealand, where Bangladesh are the other nation. So, Rizwan will have more matches to play compared to Suryakumar and that could cost him a place at the top next week. However, for the time being, the Indian ace is a top contender to surpass Rizwan in the T20I batters ranking of the ICC which will be released on Wednesday afternoon.","pubDate":"2022-10-03 16:53:38","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Legends League Cricket: Mitchell Johnson fined 50 percent match fees, warned for on-field misconduct with Yusuf Pathan","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/mitchell-johnson-yusuf-pathan-argument-legends-league-cricket-fine-match-fees-misconduct-india-capitals-vs-bhilwara-kings/article65967949.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        PTI  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Mitchell Johnson was engaged in a verbal exchange with Bhilwara Kings’ batter Yusuf Pathan and was seen pushing the latter away before the umpires intervened on Sunday.","content":"India Capitals’ pacer Mitchell Johnson has been handed a warning and docked 50 percent of his match fees for his involvement in a heated argument with Bhilwara Kings’ Yusuf Pathan during a Legends League Cricket match here.

The last match of the first leg of South Africa’s second tour of India this year will be played at the Holkar Stadium on Tuesday. Holkar Stadium, which had last hosted an international match in the form of an India-Sri Lanka T20I in January 2020, will be hosting one after almost 33 months. While India have been unbeaten in both their Indore T20Is thus far, South Africa will be playing their first-ever T20I here tomorrow. South Africa’s only appearance in the city had happened in an ODI seven years ago when they had lost by 22 runs. Yet to be confirmed officially, multiple reports suggest that India have rested vice-captain KL Rahul and former captain Virat Kohli for a dead-rubber third T20I. If true, the development will hand opportunities to ICC T20 World Cup 2022 standby players. South Africa, on the other hand, will also be looking to make changes to their Playing XI to avoid a T20I series whitewash. Holkar Stadium T20 records Highest run-scorers in Indore T20Is are KL Rahul (134), Rohit Sharma (118), Kusal Perera (111), Upul Tharanga (47) and Shreyas Iyer (34). Other Indian batters part of the current squad to have played a T20I at this venue are Virat Kohli (30), Dinesh Karthik (5) and Rishabh Pant (1).

Barring Chahal, no other Indian bowler part of the current squad has played a T20I here in the past. Highest innings totals in Indore T20Is Highest innings total across a couple of Indore T20Is is also India’s highest T20I innings total (fifth-highest overall). Batting first during the inaugural Indore T20I, India had amassed 260/5 in 20 overs on the back of a match-winning 165-run opening partnership (highest among Indian batters) between Sharma (118) and Rahul (89). Also won by India, the second Indore T20I had witnessed the home team chasing down a 143-run target with 15 balls to spare.
