India dominated proceedings on day two, accumulating their way to 376-7 to put themselves well and truly in command, a lead of 157 runs on first innings with three wickets still to burn. The final session in particular was a killer for Alyssa Healy‚Äôs side, as Deepti Sharma and Pooja Vastrakar kept the visitors at bay for the entirety, stretching the lead by 100 runs and batting the Aussies into the red Mumbai dust. Will day three bare witness to a dramatic turnaround or will it be more of the same? We‚Äôll find out soon enough. Play gets underway at 9.30am local time, 3.30pm AEDT and 4am UK time.

India have not won a Test series in South Africa and came pretty close of doing so during the last tour (2021/22). Despite winning the first Test, the visitors ended up conceding the series 2-1. The defeat in the series decider turned out to be Kohli's last as captain as he decided to step down from his role. Having missed the second Test due to an injury, the former India captain scored only 161 runs at an average of 40.25 with a top score of 79. However, Manjrekar feels if Kohli gets fired up, the star batter might come in clutch in the two-match series. \"I see Virat Kohli doing his own few things. He is going to get fired up. The last trip to South Africa, he did not get a big one and Kohli has had to work harder for Test runs recently. When Virat Kohli is all fired up and angry, that's the sight I like. David Warner as well. When they get a little fired up, you see them batting better,\" Manjrekar was quoted as saying on Star Sports. India's last Test toured of South Africa was also marred by a controversy as the visiting players had accused the local broadcasters for favouring the local team. For instance, Kohli and co. had criticised the broadcaster on the stump mic when an LBW decision from Dean Elgar was overturned by DRS. While highlighting the same incident, Manjrekar doesn't feel that the Indian team would do something similar under the leadership of Rohit Sharma . \"No (stump-mic aggression from last series repeat?) because we have a new leader in Rohit Sharma. But you are right, it brings back memories of players saying something that they have never done before, suggesting that the local broadcasters supported the South African team and all that. But that was a different temperamental team the last time around, under Rohit Sharma, they tend to play differently. It's always the captain who creates the culture, so I don't see that happening,\" he added. The first Test starts from Boxing Day (December 26) in Centurion.","pubDate":"2023-12-23 03:40:36","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-12/6p2rvhl8_virat-kohli-806_625x300_22_December_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5d05ca4cc4f082db71adc8b58c991546","title":"Bangladesh Historic Win Over NZ: ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§®‡•á ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§, 98 ‡§∞‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¢‡•á‡§∞","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/bangladesh-historic-win-over-nz-bangladesh-registered-a-historic-win-over-new-zealand-bowled-out-the-entire-team-for-98-runs-2022838.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§! ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ñ‡§º‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§´‡§º ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡•á ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä. ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§≠‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§è ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ï‡§≤‡•Ä‡§® ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§ï ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§§‡•Ä‡§® ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§®‡•á 2-1 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•Ä.","content":"‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§! ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ñ‡§º‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§´‡§º ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡•á ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä. ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§≠‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§è ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ï‡§≤‡•Ä‡§® ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§ï ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§§‡•Ä‡§® ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§®‡•á 2-1 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•Ä. ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Å‡§ï‡§ø ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∏‡§∞‡•á ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ù‡•á‡§≤‡§®‡•Ä ‡§™‡•ú‡•Ä. ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∏‡§∞‡•á ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§®‡•á ‡§ü‡•â‡§∏ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§ó‡•á‡§Ç‡§¶‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§´‡•à‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§¨‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§è 98 ‡§∞‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ü ‡§ó‡§à. ‡§ú‡§µ‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§®‡•á 15.1 ‡§ì‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç 1 ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ñ‡•ã‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§§‡§Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§π‡§∏‡§® ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡§ø‡§¨ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ë‡§´ ‡§¶ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ö‡•Å‡§®‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§§‡§Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§®‡•á 7 ‡§ì‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç 14 ‡§∞‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§ï‡§∞ 3 ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ù‡§ü‡§ï‡•á.

England crashed out of the 50-over World Cup last month, before suffering Twenty20 and one-day international series defeats at the hands of West Indies. Asked if he had doubts over his ability to lead the side, Buttler told reporters: \"Not really. I've had some low moments, for sure. It was a huge disappointment in my career, that World Cup that's just gone. \"But after you let the dust settle there's huge motivation and determination to have another crack and just keep going. That desire still burns strongly. \"It's important you learn and get better and try not to make the same mistakes. It's the same for my own game as a player, I want to just get better and better and I feel like I've still got higher levels to reach.\" Following Thursday's T20 series defeat to West Indies, England coach Matthew Mott said the side had taken valuable lessons ahead of next year's Twenty20 World Cup. Buttler echoed Mott's words, saying: \"There's lots to look forward to next year with the World Cup and I thought we played some really good cricket for the majority of the series. \"We all wanted to win the series and it's hard to say when you've lost, but I think we've found out some good things. Obviously some players have stood up and done really well. \"We've had five games out here in the Caribbean and had a really good look at what conditions will be like for the World Cup only six months away. So yeah, it's been a good series.\" England will play just one four-match series against Pakistan in May before defending their T20 World Cup title in the United States and West Indies in June.

India dominated proceedings on day two, accumulating their way to 376-7 to put themselves well and truly in command, a lead of 157 runs on first innings with three wickets still to burn. The final session in particular was a killer for Alyssa Healy‚Äôs side, as Deepti Sharma and Pooja Vastrakar kept the visitors at bay for the entirety, stretching the lead by 100 runs and batting the Aussies into the red Mumbai dust.

India have not won a Test series in South Africa and came pretty close of doing so during the last tour (2021/22). Despite winning the first Test, the visitors ended up conceding the series 2-1. The defeat in the series decider turned out to be Kohli's last as captain as he decided to step down from his role. Having missed the second Test due to an injury, the former India captain scored only 161 runs at an average of 40.25 with a top score of 79. However, Manjrekar feels if Kohli gets fired up, the star batter might come in clutch in the two-match series. \"I see Virat Kohli doing his own few things. He is going to get fired up. The last trip to South Africa, he did not get a big one and Kohli has had to work harder for Test runs recently. When Virat Kohli is all fired up and angry, that's the sight I like. David Warner as well. When they get a little fired up, you see them batting better,\" Manjrekar was quoted as saying on Star Sports. India's last Test toured of South Africa was also marred by a controversy as the visiting players had accused the local broadcasters for favouring the local team. For instance, Kohli and co. had criticised the broadcaster on the stump mic when an LBW decision from Dean Elgar was overturned by DRS. While highlighting the same incident, Manjrekar doesn't feel that the Indian team would do something similar under the leadership of Rohit Sharma . \"No (stump-mic aggression from last series repeat?) because we have a new leader in Rohit Sharma. But you are right, it brings back memories of players saying something that they have never done before, suggesting that the local broadcasters supported the South African team and all that. But that was a different temperamental team the last time around, under Rohit Sharma, they tend to play differently.

India dominated proceedings on day two, accumulating their way to 376-7 to put themselves well and truly in command, a lead of 157 runs on first innings with three wickets still to burn. The final session in particular was a killer for Alyssa Healy‚Äôs side, as Deepti Sharma and Pooja Vastrakar kept the visitors at bay for the entirety, stretching the lead by 100 runs and batting the Aussies into the red Mumbai dust. Will day three bare witness to a dramatic turnaround or will it be more of the same? We‚Äôll find out soon enough. Play gets underway at 9.30am local time, 3.30pm AEDT and 4am UK time.

Carey has endured some mixed fortunes since that groundbreaking achievement, but he is hopeful of better times ahead in all formats as Australia look to retain the Benaud-Qadir Trophy with victory over Pakistan at the MCG. With Australia's Test schedule nowhere as busy in 2024 as it was this year, the 32-year-old will look to throw himself into more 50-over and 20-over matches. \"I still feel like I've had some pretty solid performances in the last 12 months in one-day cricket,\" Carey said on Saturday. \"The timing of a leaner trot led to that decision (in India for the World Cup) from the selection panel. \"But I feel like I've got a lot of good one-day cricket, lots of T20 cricket still left in me. \"I haven't been able to play a lot of T20 cricket, which has been good of course playing Test cricket. \"But I'd love to get the opportunity to play some more T20 cricket over the winter, wherever that may be.\" Carey was axed for Josh Inglis after just one game at the World Cup, but insists he was never left wondering why he was dropped and what he needed to do to win back his place. \"With our selection panel they've been really honest with every decision they make,'' he said. \"It never makes it easier though to hear you've got to be left out. \"Don't leave any stone unturned - it's your career, ask the questions, they're really open to it. \"They've been honest with it the whole time. \"You don't want to be going to bed at night wondering why - and I didn't. \"Although you still don't like to hear it, you're able to talk through it, move on and try to help the team win the World Cup.''

India have not won a Test series in South Africa and came pretty close of doing so during the last tour (2021/22). Despite winning the first Test, the visitors ended up conceding the series 2-1. The defeat in the series decider turned out to be Kohli's last as captain as he decided to step down from his role. Having missed the second Test due to an injury, the former India captain scored only 161 runs at an average of 40.25 with a top score of 79. However, Manjrekar feels if Kohli gets fired up, the star batter might come in clutch in the two-match series. \"I see Virat Kohli doing his own few things. He is going to get fired up. The last trip to South Africa, he did not get a big one and Kohli has had to work harder for Test runs recently. When Virat Kohli is all fired up and angry, that's the sight I like. David Warner as well. When they get a little fired up, you see them batting better,\" Manjrekar was quoted as saying on Star Sports. India's last Test toured of South Africa was also marred by a controversy as the visiting players had accused the local broadcasters for favouring the local team. For instance, Kohli and co. had criticised the broadcaster on the stump mic when an LBW decision from Dean Elgar was overturned by DRS. While highlighting the same incident, Manjrekar doesn't feel that the Indian team would do something similar under the leadership of Rohit Sharma . \"No (stump-mic aggression from last series repeat?) because we have a new leader in Rohit Sharma. But you are right, it brings back memories of players saying something that they have never done before, suggesting that the local broadcasters supported the South African team and all that. But that was a different temperamental team the last time around, under Rohit Sharma, they tend to play differently. It's always the captain who creates the culture, so I don't see that happening,\" he added. The first Test starts from Boxing Day (December 26) in Centurion.","pubDate":"2023-12-23 03:40:36","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-12/6p2rvhl8_virat-kohli-806_625x300_22_December_23.jpg","source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"5d05ca4cc4f082db71adc8b58c991546","title":"Bangladesh Historic Win Over NZ: ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§®‡•á ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§, 98 ‡§∞‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¢‡•á‡§∞","link":"https://hindi.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/bangladesh-historic-win-over-nz-bangladesh-registered-a-historic-win-over-new-zealand-bowled-out-the-entire-team-for-98-runs-2022838.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§! ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ñ‡§º‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§´‡§º ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡•á ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä. ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§≠‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§è ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ï‡§≤‡•Ä‡§® ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§ï ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§§‡•Ä‡§® ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§®‡•á 2-1 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•Ä.","content":"‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§! ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ñ‡§º‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§´‡§º ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•Ä ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡•á ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä. ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§≠‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§è ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ï‡§≤‡•Ä‡§® ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§ï ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§§‡•Ä‡§® ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§®‡•á 2-1 ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•É‡§Ç‡§ñ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•Ä. ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Å‡§ï‡§ø ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∏‡§∞‡•á ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ù‡•á‡§≤‡§®‡•Ä ‡§™‡•ú‡•Ä. ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∏‡§∞‡•á ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§®‡•á ‡§ü‡•â‡§∏ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§ó‡•á‡§Ç‡§¶‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§´‡•à‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§¨‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§è 98 ‡§∞‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ü ‡§ó‡§à. ‡§ú‡§µ‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§®‡•á 15.1 ‡§ì‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç 1 ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ñ‡•ã‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§§‡§Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§π‡§∏‡§® ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡§ø‡§¨ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ë‡§´ ‡§¶ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ö‡•Å‡§®‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§§‡§Ç‡§ú‡§º‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§®‡•á 7 ‡§ì‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç 14 ‡§∞‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§ï‡§∞ 3 ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ù‡§ü‡§ï‡•á.
