It is a massive coup for the Storm which has beaten a host of rival sporting organisations and clubs to Selwood’s signature in what is his first official coaching role following a fairytale finish to his AFL career. Selwood, who is regarded as one of the finest on-field leaders in Australian sport, steered Geelong to a fourth premiership in the Grand Final win over Sydney Swans in his last AFL game. The champion Cat, who led Geelong for 11 seasons after taking over as skipper aged 23, said he looked forward to joining a club he had huge respect for. “I’m really excited to be joining Storm. I’ve been watching them and been in envy of what the club has been able to achieve for a long time,” Selwood said. “When the opportunity come up, I saw it as a great chance to get involved in something a bit different in an environment that is so well run.” The Storm has utilised former Collingwood premiership captain Nick Maxwell in a similar leadership role and believe Selwood’s experience and expertise will be invaluable for its playing group. Storm chief executive Justin Rodski and coach Craig Bellamy pulled off the deal with Selwood after recent talks with the hard nut about working with the club’s key on-field figures. Storm football manager Frank Ponissi said Selwood would be an outstanding addition to the club, helping mentor its senior and emerging leaders for next season. The club’s captain or co-captains will be appointed ahead of the new season next year.“Joel is an impressive person and has shown he has outstanding leadership qualities as Captain of the Cats over a long period of time,” Ponissi said. “We were particularly impressed with his humility and eagerness to learn, which was no surprise given what we knew about him and from the feedback we got from those we spoke to through the process, including Simon Lloyd (Geelong football manager) at the Cats.” Selwood had expressed a desire to stay in sport after hanging up the boots on his playing career but said he would take time to decide the next steps, in conjunction with his manager Tom Petroro, from TLA. There has been a long list of AFL clubs enquire about his plans, while Cricket Australia had also been linked to him for a similar position. The Storm finished the home and away season in fifth place but bowed out of the premiership race after losing its first final to Canberra Raiders. At Geelong, Patrick Dangerfield, Tom Stewart and Mark Blicavs are considered the frontrunners to replace Selwood as captain as the Cats shoot for back-to-back premierships.","pubDate":"2022-11-18 03:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sue Barker’s Wimbledon replacement ‘revealed’ after legendary BBC TV host drops major hint at awards ceremony","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/9782396/sue-barker-wimbledon-replacement-hint-tennis/","keywords":["Sport","Tennis","BBC","BBC ONE","Television","Wimbledon"],"creator":["Ian Tuckey"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"SUE BARKER has dropped a huge hint over her replacement as the BBC's lead presenter at Wimbledon.

Much like his team, Warner failed to fire as the defending champions were eliminated before the semi-finals, registering just 44 runs in four matches after being playing of the tournament just 12 months earlier. But he was back to his best in Adelaide on Thursday night, smashing 84 in a 147-run opening stand with new opening partner Travis Head as the Aussies destroyed world champions England, albeit without some first-choice players. Warner, 36, said it was the start of the lead-in to what he conceded would probably be his final one-day World Cup in India next year, and beyond that tournament his future in the format was unclear.Having already declared he could finish his Test career after next year’s Ashes in England, the timeline would suggest 50-over cricket may follow. “The goals are winning World Cups,” Warner said after Thursday’s win. “We’ve got a World Cup next year, then the next one is in four years time when I’ll be 41. I don’t know if I’ve got that long left in me.“It will be time for the next generation of players, (Head) is one of those players. It’s about giving them opportunities to cement their spot in the team and have that goal and aspiration to play in that World Cup. “Who knows, I might have a second wind?“But my goal at the moment is to get to that World Cup, play as well as I can, and we’ll see from there.”The partnership with Head, who was given first crack to replace retired Australian captain Aaron Finch, was something of a back-to-the future moment. In an Adelaide ODI in 2017 against Pakistan, the duo put on a 284-run stand – the highest partnership in Australia’s ODI history.While Warner stayed at the top, Head had a rollercoaster ride in the one-day team from that period until he was dropped before the 2019 World Cup. But Warner is hopeful Head, who shares similar batting qualities, can cement his spot ahead of the World Cup in India next October.“I think we both play quite similar, we take the game on,” Warner said. .“We like to go aerial, that‘s the way we play. Anything short we try and punch, pull. That’s our style of play.“It‘s coming off at the moment, which is great and hopefully we can continue that success.“For us it’s about winning every game leading in, getting some momentum, making sure we have the right team they want to go with.”","pubDate":"2022-11-17 22:49:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"He’s baaaack!

The defeat extended their wait for an ICC trophy, with the Indian team not having won a major global event since the 2013 Champions Trophy.Like India, New Zealand too were eliminated in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup after topping their group, failing to defend what would prove to be a sub-par total against Pakistan. Unlike the Indians however, the Black Caps did manage to collect a few wickets during Babar Azam and Co’s successful run chase.The two teams lock horns in three T20Is, which will then be followed by as many ODIs. Each game in the tour will take place in a different venue, with Wellington’s Sky Stadium playing host to the opening game of India’s tour.While the Black Caps continue to be led by their usual captain Kane Williamson, the all-rounder Hardik Pandya has filled in for India skipper Rohit Sharma, who has been rested from the tour along with Virat Kohli and KL Rahul. Though they’ve stuck with Williamson as their skipper, the Kiwis have dropped senior pacer Trent Boult and opener Martin Guptill for the series.Ahead of the first T20I, we take a look at five players who could strike big in the series:Umran MalikWith the Indian attack taking a severe beating in the semi-final against England, supporters of the Men in Blue will want some changes to be made to the team’s bowling combination, to put it politely. And while young Arshdeep Singh remained impressive, folks will be wanting an alternative to Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami in the pace department.Express pacer Umran Malik is seen as one such candidate capable of dismantling opposition batting lineups at will if he gets his discipline right along with his breakneck speed. Malik, who hit 157kmph while representing the Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2022, had made his debut in the tour of England earlier this year but was a tad expensive. The Jammu and Kashmir pacer will hope to make up for it this time around and present a solid case for his long-term selection in New Zealand where the conditions will be to his liking.Lockie FergusonMalik briefly held the record for the fastest ball delivered in the 2022 edition of the IPL for a brief while, only for Gujarat Titans’ pacer Lockie Ferguson to break the record a little over three weeks later in the final, clocking 157.3 kmph against Malik’s 157.And in the upcoming series between India and New Zealand, it won’t just be Malik who will be setting the speed gun on fire; Ferguson is just as capable of hitting dizzying speeds with the ball. What’s more Ferguson’s the more experienced of the two as well as a local, someone who understands the conditions inside out. Expect a battle for the ages between these two.Yuzvendra ChahalAnd it’s not just the pace department one has to keep an eye out for in the upcoming series. Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will be hoping to send a strong message to those who kept him out of India’s playing XI in the T20 World Cup despite wrist-spinners proving to be match-winners for teams such as England and Pakistan, the two sides that made it to the final.Chahal, whose only appearances in Australia took place during the practice games, doesn’t have the best of records when it comes to T20Is in New Zealand, but will he be hoping to change for the better should opportunities come his way in the upcoming series.Shubman GillIt wasn’t just the bowling unit where India had issues in the T20 World Cup; their batting department has had its fair share of problems, especially at the top of the order with skipper Rohit Sharma and his deputy KL Rahul struggling to find their touch and ultimately putting pressure on Virat Kohli and the rest of the middle order.Punjab and Gujarat Titans opener Shubman Gill comes into this series on the back of a stellar run in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he collected 260 runs at an average of 52 and a strike rate of 156.62 including a 55-ball 126 against powerhouses Karnataka in the quarters. And he sure will hope to present himself as a successor to Rahul should the senior team management decide they’ve enough of him in the shortest format.Glenn PhillipsPhillips was among the standout players in the World Cup, where he smashed one of the two centuries scored across the tournament — a 64-ball 104 against Sri Lanka that came at a time when the Black Caps were reeling at 15/3, helping them post a match-winning total of 167/7.The South Africa-born keeper-batter finished the highest run-scorer for his side in the tournament with 201 runs at an average of 40.20 and a strike rate of 158.26 and the 10th-highest overall (fifth, if you take into account the teams that started their campaigns from the Super 12s). And though his form tapered off towards the end when it mattered the most, with Phillips getting dismissed for 6 in the semi-final off Mohammad Nawaz’s bowling, he remains the biggest threat among the Kiwi batters for Hardik Pandya and Co in the upcoming fixtures.Squads:India: Shubman Gill, Ishan Kishan, Sanju Samson, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya(c), Rishabh Pant(wk), Deepak Hooda, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Umran Malik, Washington Sundar, Mohammed Siraj, Shreyas Iyer, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshal PatelNew Zealand: Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Kane Williamson(c), Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Lockie Ferguson, Blair Tickner, Michael Bracewell, Ish SodhiRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Image: Blackcaps/Twitter The 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia may have got over just a few days, but preparations and planning are underway in full swing for the next edition of the tournament in 2024, to be hosted by West Indies and the United States of America. Just days after their semi-final exit from the T20 World Cup, some Team India members like Suryakumar Yadav and Rishabh Pant, who were part of the T20 World Cup campaign, touched down in New Zealand’s Wellington ahead of a limited-overs series against the Black Caps. In Kiwiland, India will play three T20Is and as many ODIs over the next two weeks. Hardik Pandya, who has been considered by many as an able future skipper, will captain the Men in Blue in the T20I series, while Shikhar Dhawan will lead the side in the ODIs. Veterans like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been rested for this tour following a hectic cricketing season, so this series will provide an opportunity for youngsters to step up their game. Sanju Samson has been on and off the Indian team, and he finds himself in the squad for both the T20I as well as the ODI series. Other notable youngsters in the batting department include Shubman Gill and Ishan Kishan. Suryakumar Yadav, or SKY as he is affectionately called by fans and experts alike, will look to carry on his positive form from the T20 World Cup. SKY scored 239 runs from six T20 World Cup matches, registering three half-centuries. He ended up as the tournament’s third highest run-getter, behind Virat Kohli and Netherlands’ Max ODowd. India’s bowling department is a mix of experience and youth. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the most experienced bowler in the side, followed by the duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. Young Arshdeep Singh has been a promising sign for Team India, and he retains his place in the squad, while Umran Malik, synonymous for his fiery pace, has also been included. VVS Laxman will fill in as coach for the series, replacing Rahul Dravid, who has also been given a break after the T20 World Cup. Here’s all you need to know as to when and where to watch the first India vs New Zealand T20I: When will the India vs New Zealand match be played? The India vs New Zealand first T20I will be played on 18 November, 2022 (Friday). What is the venue for the India vs New Zealand match?

About a dozen informal games are in progress in a carpark near the city’s financial district, as metro trains glide across a bridge overhead and police watch from a parked SUV, wary of players bringing alcohol or otherwise misbehaving. Every weekend, such games are played on spare patches of ground across the Gulf region, which is home to millions of migrant workers and expatriates from cricket-loving South Asia. And even as the Gulf, namely Qatar, gears up to host the first football World Cup on Arab soil, another tournament dominated conversation among the players in Dubai: cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup, which was unfolding in Australia. Faisal, a 35-year-old Pakistani who drives for a living, followed the tournament so avidly that he nearly crashed during India’s tense win over Pakistan in October. “I was almost in an accident-I was watching my phone, the India-Pakistan game,” he said. “We really love cricket.” There’s no question which is the prime sport among the Gulf’s migrant workers, whose treatment has been in the spotlight in the build-up to the Qatar World Cup. Street cricket can often be seen in Dubai, much more commonly than football. That’s a result of the huge numbers of South Asians in the region, including an estimated 3.5 million Indians in the United Arab Emirates. Making up about a third of residents, they dwarf the native population of around one million. “We keep watching scores while playing cricket,” said Indian expat Dinesh Balani, 49. “While working, while in the bathroom or anywhere, we follow cricket.” DUBAI: Expatriate workers play cricket in a parking lot in the Gulf emirate of Dubai.- AFP ‘Our own bosses’ As the November morning heats up, more players arrive, clutching paper cups of karak tea, a Gulf speciality, and bags of bats and plastic wickets as they spill out of cars. A children’s game is in progress in one corner of the carpark, while in another, an all-women’s team undergo a coaching session. Tennis balls wrapped in tape-to make them less bouncy, which better replicates leather cricket balls for bowling and batting-hurtle across the tarmac, bumping off kerbs and rolling under parked cars. Balani, who works in real estate, said he has played street cricket in Dubai since 1995. He runs a team, the D-Boys, with 30 players on the roster. He said for many workers, often with boring or stressful jobs, cricket is an important outlet. “A lot of us are between white and blue-collar workers,” Balani said. “So they have to go through a lot of things in the week. They listen to a lot of things from bosses and managers,” he added. “But this is the one place where we vent out. Nobody is there to boss us. We are our own bosses.” Amreen Vadsaria, 22, who was raised in New Zealand and is playing with the women’s team, says India’s Virat Kohli is her favorite player. She cannot name any footballers. “I grew up outside of India, and I never really had an interest in cricket. But I think (playing street cricket) has made me want to follow cricket more,” she said. “And because it’s such a big thing in my country in India, I think it’s brought me closer to my culture.” ‘Family get-together’ The players and their games have an itinerant history, moving from place to place as Dubai’s breakneck development turns their makeshift cricket grounds into tower blocks and malls. Meanwhile, the UAE has become a fixture in professional cricket, hosting Pakistan’s home games for a decade after a 2009 attack on Sri Lanka’s team in Lahore. India’s glitzy IPL Twenty20 competition shifted to the UAE for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the oil-rich country also hosted last year’s Twenty20 World Cup, along with several Asian Cups. While the UAE’s South Asian population ensures a ready-made fan-base for big tournaments, weekly cricket also acts as a glue for the community, according to Balani. “This is what we have done from the age of five. We started playing and never stopped since then,” he said. “It is part and parcel of our life… we became friends in cricket and then our families became friends and then our kids became friends and so on and so forth,” Balani added. “So this is not only cricket, this is also like a family get-together for us,” he said. – AFP The post As WCup looms, street cricket rules for Gulf migrant workers appeared first on Kuwait Times.","pubDate":"2022-11-17 16:21:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"IND vs NZ T20 Series | Dinesh Karthik joins as a cricket expert?","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/ind-vs-nz-t20-series-dinesh-karthik-joins-as-a-cricket-expert/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","Dinesh Karthik","game","India"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik is expected to attend the first match of the T20I series between India and New Zealand starting on Friday as a cricket expert and share his views.

The only ones who played were Malan, who missed the final, captain Jos Buttler, and late-tournament injury replacements Chris Jordan and Phil Salt.

Although the BCCI is yet to confirm venues for the series, it is looking increasingly likely that the four Tests in February and March next year will be hosted by Nagpur, Delhi, Dharamsala and Ahmedabad. The Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Credit: AP The stadium in Ahmedabad has hosted matches as far back as the early 1980s, when it was known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cricket Stadium, but underwent a major rebuild between 2015 and 2020 when it was named after India’s populist prime minister Narendra Modi. The first event it hosted was a joint rally for Modi and then United States president, Donald Trump , in February 2020, a few weeks before COVID-19 swept the globe. A year later, the stadium was used for two Test matches between England and India, and this year was the venue for the Indian Premier League final, witnessed by 104,859 spectators. The biggest official attendance for a Test match day was Boxing Day in the 2013-14 Ashes fixture at the MCG, when 91,112 spectators attended. Among the other venues, Dehli’s Arun Jaitley Stadium, once known as the Feroz Shah Kotla, has been an unhappy hunting ground for Australia, winning there only once as far back as 1959 and failing to win any of the six Tests played there since. Loading Australia also lost their only Test match in Dharamshala, the decisive game of the epic 2017 series that India won 2-1 after surrendering the first Test in Pune on a sharply turning track.","pubDate":"2022-11-17 10:49:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ मैच में एश्टन एगर ने की हैरान कर देने वाली फाल्डिंग, बचाया ऐसा छक्का, देखें वीडियो","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ashton-agar-did-awesome-fielding-to-save-a-six-from-dawid-malan-in-match-against-england-see-video-2261367","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ashton Agar Feilding: इंग्लैंड टीम इन दिनों ऑस्ट्रेलिया दौरे पर तीन वनडे मैचों की सीरीज़ खेले रही है. इस सीरीज़ का पहला मैच 17 नवंबर यानी आज एडिलेड ओवल में खेला जा रहा है. इस मैच में ऑस्ट्रेलियाई ऑलराउंडर एश्टन एगर (Ashton Agar) ने डीप मिड विकेट में फील्डिंग करते हुए एक शानदार छक्का रोका है. एश्टन की इस फील्डिंग को देखकर सभी हैरान हो गए. उनकी इस फील्डिंग का वीडियो सोशल मीडिया पर जमकर वायरल हो रहा है. टीम के लिए बचाए अमह रन दरअसल, पहली पारी के 45वें ओवर में इंग्लैंड के बल्लेबाज़ डेविड मलान ने ऑस्ट्रेलियाई तेज़ गेंदबाज़ पेट कमिंस की गेंद पर एक शाट खेला. गेंद मिड विकेट पर गई, जहां एश्टन एगर फील्डिंग कर रहे थे. एक बार को लगा कि यह गेंद बाउंड्री के पार हो गई और इंग्लैंड के खाते में 6 रन जुड़ जाएंगे. लेकिन फील्डिंग कर रहे एश्टन ने ऐसा संभव नहीं होने दिया. उन्होंने शानदार प्रयास करते हुए गेंद को बाउंड्री तक जाने से रोका. वीडियो में आप देख सकते हैं कि कैसे एश्टन ने छलांग लगाकर गेंद को बाउंड्री में दाखिल होने से पहले ही वापस फेंक दिया और टीम के लिए अहम रन बचाए. उनकी ये शानदार छलांग टीम के लिए काफी फायदेमंद साबित हुई. इसके बाद मिचेल स्टार्क ने गेंद को वापस फेंका.
