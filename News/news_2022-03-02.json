The first Test will mark the beginning of newly appointed full-time skipper Rohit Sharma's journey as the leader of the Test side. Virat Kohli, on the other hand, will represent India in the cricketing whites for the 100th time. The home side has a few records to extend as it enters the Test series. One that must be highlighted is India's dominance over the island nation in Tests at home. So far, India have played against Sri Lanka 20 times at home, with the former emerging victorious on 11 occasions while the remaining nine ended in draws. Sri Lanka are yet to defeat India in Tests in India, a run which Rohit will look to continue in the upcoming series. In another interesting statistic, a win for India will help them become the only team to register 21 Test wins against Sri Lanka. The Test series will be seen as a new dawn for Indian cricket under the leadership of Rohit and head coach Rahul Dravid. Promoted After enjoying a relatively easier task of winning the Test series against New Zealand at home as his first assignment, Dravid lost against South Africa away, with Virat as captain. What will be interesting to see is the combination the captain and coach choose to go ahead with. In the absence of Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, the young guns could be given a chance to prove their mettle.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-12/3k64ru88_virat-kohli-team-india-test-afp_625x300_10_December_21.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussies lucky to play in Pakistan: Cummins","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/aussies-lucky-to-play-in-pakistan-cummins-c-5900357","keywords":null,"creator":["Steve Larkin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Twenty-four years after Mark Taylor equalled one of the most celebrated feats in Australian sport, Australia is finally back playing Test cricket in Pakistan.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-02 03:48:18","full_description":"From being rolled on mats to Tubby's triple-treat, Pakistan has polarised Australia's cricketers.

Only five Tests have been played in Pakistan since a terrorist attack on Sri Lanka's cricketers in Lahore in 2009. None were played in the decade after the Sri Lankan's team bus was shot at by about a dozen gunmen, injuring six cricketers - six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed during the attack. Only last September, New Zealand abandoned a tour just hours before a T20 International in Rawalpindi, citing a security threat. Soon after, England cancelled a scheduled tour. But Cummins and co have stressed they feel safe in a country where Australia first played a Test match in 1956. That landmark match ended in ignominy for Ian Johnson's Australians: a nine-wicket loss on a jute matting pitch in Karachi. After the matting was rolled out, Australia was rolled for 80 all out en route to defeat as a Karachi police superintendent, Fazal Mahmood, took 13 wickets for the game. Australia returned in 1959 and won 2-0 in the three-Test series - the triumph was Australia's last series victory in Pakistan for 39 years. After a drawn sole Test in 1964, Australia only returned in 1980 when 1-0 losers in a three-Test series punctuated by two cricket rarities. After losing the series-opener, captain Greg Chappell summed up his feelings for a flat Faisalabad track in the second Test by bowling all 11 of his team in Pakistan's sole innings - wicketkeeper Rod Marsh sent down 11 wicketless overs and specialist batsmen Bruce Laird and Kim Hughes were among the trundlers. And 1980's drawn third Test was highlighted by a young Allan Border scoring 150 not out and 153 - he remains the only cricketer to score 150 or more in both innings of a Test. Australia returned under Hughes' captaincy in 1982 - Chappell made himself unavailable, along with Dennis Lillee - and were walloped 3-0. Australia lost further series in Pakistan in 1988 and 1994, a tour infamous for bribery. On the night of day four in the first Test in Karachi, Australia's legspinner Shane Warne was visited in his hotel room by Pakistani captain Saleem Malik. Warne, who held the key to the result on the final day when Australia required another seven wickets and Pakistan a further 160 runs, alleged he and fellow spinner Tim May were offered $US200,000 bribes by Malik to try not to take wickets. \"I just sort of sat there stunned. And then I go 'f*** you, mate, we're going to beat you',\" Warne said in his documentary, Shane. On the final day, Warne had claimed five Pakistan wickets when Inzamam-ul-Haq was joined by No.11 Mushtaq Ahmed with the hosts needing 57 more runs to win. They got them. It took authorities until 2000 to get Malik, when he was banned for life for match-fixing. Four years later, in 1998, captain Mark 'Tubby' Taylor oversaw a first Test victory. Then he batted for two days in Peshawar's second Test before declaring when not out 334 - equalling the then-record of Sir Donald Bradman for Australia's highest individual Test score.

During the upcoming Mohali Test, he will become the 12th Indian to play 100 Tests after Sachin Tendulkar (200), Rahul Dravid (163), VVS Laxman (134), Anil Kumble (132), Kapil Dev (131), Sunil Gavaskar (125), Dilip Vengsarkar (116), Sourav Ganguly (113), Ishant Sharma (105), Harbhajan Singh (103), and Virender Sehwag (103).

Shah also said though the recent white-ball series against the West Indies was played behind closed doors, the dip in Covid-19 cases across the country allowed the hosting associations to permit crowds. \"While we started off the West Indies Tour of India behind closed doors, the encouraging dip in Covid-19 cases allowed the hosting associations to permit crowds.

He believes that the lack of broadcasting of domestic games is also a reason for the downfall. “Domestic cricket should be the criteria because some players who can’t play the IPL, they have such outstanding performances in domestic cricket,” Kaul said. Siddharth Kaul highlighted the fact that he scalped 28 wickets in five games last year, which included three five-wicket hauls. He still was not called even for the India-A team.

He believes that the lack of broadcasting of domestic games is also a reason for the downfall. “Domestic cricket should be the criteria because some players who can’t play the IPL, they have such outstanding performances in domestic cricket,” Kaul said. Siddharth Kaul highlighted the fact that he scalped 28 wickets in five games last year, which included three five-wicket hauls. He still was not called even for the India-A team. Kaul has 237 first-class wickets under his belt. Siddharth Kaul can’t wait to get started in the red and gold & neither can we! 🤩👊🏻 #PlayBold #WeAreChallengers #IPLMegaAuction #IPL2022 #IPLAuction pic.twitter.com/WUY7GNXesf — Royal Challengers Bangalore (@RCBTweets) February 14, 2022 Kaul scalped 21 wickets in IPL 2018 and was drafted in the Indian national team. Although, he was out of the team after playing just three T20Is. Kaul has been bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL 2022 this season on his base price of 75 L. He said that his job is to keep performing. “My job is to perform. If I do that, deep down, I will have the satisfaction that I did well,” Kaul said. “It is the selector’s job to pick or not pick me. I will be happy knowing that I did my job. Yes, if I don’t do my job well and then criticise then that is foolishness.” “No one said ‘look at Siddharth Kaul’ when I was performing. There was no air about me.” Siddharth Kaul is currently under quarantine, and that’s why he is not playing the Ranji Trophy for his state.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Victory, apt gift for the gifted","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/victory-apt-gift-for-the-gifted-374392","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Deepankar ShardaMohali, March 1As India take on Sri Lanka in the first Test starting Friday, all eyes will be on the charismatic Virat Kohli.

The money has come from the estate of former Bradford League umpire and noted Bradford Junior League supporter Derek Shuttleworth, who died aged 89 in January 2019. After a loss of £1,970 that year, the league, which was renamed the Derek Shuttleworth Bradford Junior Cricket League in 2019, were able to show a profit of £25,140 in the year ending October 31, 2020. Bradford Junior League treasurer Phil Radcliffe said: “Soon after Derek had died (in 2018) we knew that there was something in the will as a bequest to the Bradford Junior Cricket League, but at that time we didn’t know how much the amount was, as it depended on the total value of his estate. “The money finally came in April 2020. I had an inkling that £25,000 would be the amount but until it was confirmed, that could have gone up or down, so we kept it quiet. “We announced at the annual meeting two years ago that this money was on its way but we don’t know how much, but at the annual meeting last month we could publish it in the accounts so that all the clubs could see it.” Radcliffe added: “The money is for the benefit of junior cricket in Bradford, so we can put it to what we want, but we need it to support the league, to make the league better. “The league is financially viable because of it, but we don’t want to squander Derek’s money. “It is too early to say what we will do with it, but we could move to send coaches on courses, invest in clubs, apply for grants, but we need to sit down as an executive committee, who need more members by the way, and see what the options are. “We will probably open the discussion out to clubs at one of our league meetings so that they have an input, as it is to their benefit as well, but we want something that is of benefit to the league and is sustainable. “Over the years we have probably had a good base of anything up to £10,000 to work with, but that has probably gone down to £4,000 (they made a loss of £128 on the year ending October 31, 2021). “With this money, which has topped it back up again, we know that the league is financially secure and we know that we don’t have to look for sponsorship, which is hard to obtain these days, but we can still get sponsorship on top of this. “Without the money from Derek’s estate, we would have had to ask the clubs to contribute more to keep us viable. “We have lost some clubs and gained some clubs, so we have kept the status quo, but in the last two years, there has been very little expenditure and in 2020 we waived all the league fees for clubs.” Shuttleworth, who was president of the Bradford Premier League Umpires’ Association when he died, began umpiring in 1964 and was the umpires’ chairman from 1968-1997, becoming president at the end of that nearly 30-year tenure. He won the league’s prestigious Sir Leonard Hutton Trophy in 1998 and later became a life member, and received the ECBACO’s Lifetime Achiever Award in 2012. He was also given a Yorkshire Cricket Board OSCA for services to umpiring in 2018 – the second time he had won that award.","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/13526996/?type=app&htype=120","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Smith hits the nets in Rawalpindi ahead of first Test | Pakistan v Australia 2022 - cricket.com.au","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9Z0RWVnFYREhaODDSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Smith hits the nets in Rawalpindi ahead of first Test | Pakistan v Australia 2022  cricket.com.au‘I was struggling’: Aussie star’s fresh setback  news.com.au‘I was struggling’: Smith reveals brutal ordeal in concussion comeback  Fox SportsSmith explains aftermath of Sri Lanka concussion | Pakistan v Australia 2022  cricket.com.au‘No concerns from me’: Smith raring to go on batting paradise  Sydney Morning HeraldView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-02 00:18:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan lose gun quick ahead of first Test","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/australian-tour-of-pakistan-fast-bowler-haris-rauf-ruled-out-due-to-positive-covid-test/1f034bba-712d-4fb7-a180-4411ee2201e8","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Fast bowler Haris Rauf has been robbed of a chance to make his Test debut in his home town after testing positive to COVID.","content":"Fast bowler Haris Rauf has been robbed of a chance to make his Test debut in his home town after testing positive to COVID-19.The 28-year-old white ball specialist was in the frame for the first Test against Australia after injuries to Hasan Ali and allrounder Faheem Ashraf last week.Rauf may be best remembered by Australian audiences for his hat trick against the Sydney Thunder while playing for the Melbourne Stars in the 2020-21 Big Bash.READ MORE: Coach quits Russian football club in war protestREAD MORE: World sport takes another swipe at PutinREAD MORE: Mundine's surprise ahead of son's huge moveThe Pakistan Cricket Board said that Rauf will isolate for five days, pending a negative test.

As part of the eight-figure settlement, US Soccer pledged to equalise prize money between the men’s and women’s national teams across all competitions, including World Cups. A few days earlier, the International Cricket Council confirmed the prize money for the upcoming Women’s World Cup would be $9 million less than the corresponding men’s competition.

Although cricket has taken its own strides towards gender equity over the past few years, the disparity between male and female athletes remains glaring. The prize pool at next month’s Women’s World Cup will be 75 per cent larger than the previous tournament, with $4.8 million up for grabs at the New Zealand-based tournament. However, that sum is a fraction of the total prize money awarded at the corresponding men’s event, with $13.8 million handed out at the 2019 Men’s World Cup. “Those sorts of things are really important in terms of the message that it sends more broadly in the community,” Australian vice-captain Rachael Haynes told news.com.au . “Even just last week, we saw the US soccer team win their fight for pay equity in their sport, so I think there is a lot of groundswell around this, and particularly governing bodies needing to make sure there is gender equity in their sport. “I definitely would suspect over time we would see greater parity in prize pools and pay.” Earlier this summer, Cricket Australia announced a $1.2 million cash injection to increase the base salary for female athletes that hold a contract in the WBBL and WNCL to more than $65,000. However, this remains considerably lower than the average retainer of $198,000 that men’s players who compete in all formats at domestic level receive. Australian cricketers are among the country’s best paid female athletes, but the gender pay gap remains cause for concern. “I think probably the biggest thing for Australian cricket is really getting our domestic players up to the point where they can call themselves full-time,” Haynes said. “I think that’s the next frontier for domestic cricket and cricket in general in Australia. “I’m sure there’s discussions that are happening behind the scenes, and working out how we can bridge those gaps and making sure we achieve gender equity.” ‘Scar tissues’ from 2017 have healed Australia were touted as favourites heading into the 2017 Women’s Cricket World Cup, and rightfully so. With the likes of Meg Lanning, Alex Blackwell and Ellyse Perry among their arsenal, the Aussies cruised into the knockouts before Indian batter Harmanpreet Kaur put together a career-defining knock in the must-win semi-final. Kaur brought up her half-century against Australia in 64 deliveries — she then struck 120 runs from her following 51 balls at the crease. It was a white-ball masterclass and the Aussies fell 36 runs short in the run chase. England were crowned champions after defeating India in the decider by nine runs. Five years later, Australia is searching for redemption in New Zealand. The 2022 Women’s Cricket World Cup, postponed 12 months due to the Covid-19, gets underway this week across the Tasman, and Australia are once again the frontrunners to lift the coveted trophy. Haynes, who’s about to embark on her third World Cup campaign, is adamant the scars of 2017 have well and truly healed. “We’ve sort of moved on from that point as a group,” she said. “It was obviously really disappointing at the time. “The team’s really different to what it was in 2017 as well. There’s lots of fresh faces. The scar tissues from that tournament aren’t really there, because there is just a freshness to the group.” Australia’s ODI record since the 2017 World Cup is nothing short of remarkable — 31 wins from 33 matches, with just two defeats. The historic purple patch was highlighted by a record-breaking 26-match unbeaten streak from March 2018 to September 2021. The Aussies are also coming off a comprehensive Ashes triumph that included three straight ODI wins over England. But Haynes knows the numbers and records become obsolete when the tournament kicks off. “We’ve played some really good cricket over the last couple of years, but when you get into tournaments it doesn’t count for much, because you’ve got to keep winning the game that’s in front of you,” she said. “We’ve seen some really good cricket from all different countries over the last couple of years and England obviously comes in as defending champions too. From our point of view, we’re chasing them. “Hopefully we can be there at the business end.” From under-12 boys to World Cup glory Like several of her teammates, Haynes’ family introduced her to cricket. Growing up in Melbourne, the left-hander fell in love with the game by honing her craft in the backyard and on the street. “It was something we always did that brought us together,” Haynes recalled. “We’d always find ourselves out in the backyard enjoying a game of cricket together. Sometimes it got a little bit more competitive than it probably needed to be.” When a neighbour spotted Haynes batting in the street, they invited her to join North Balwyn Cricket Club that summer. “The rest is history, so to speak,” she said with a laugh. Haynes started her cricket journey playing for the North Balwyn CC under-12 boys team, and the opposition was at times startled when she waltzed into the middle. “I was one of the only girls playing in the competition at the time,” she explained. “When I used to walk out to bat, it used to take other teams back a little bit, just clarifying if I was a girl. “Initially when I went to those first couple of training sessions I was a little bit worried about whether or not I would be welcomed into the team, and if I’d have any friends. “But once I started going to training and playing alongside them, the boys I played with were great, they were very welcoming.” Haynes progressed through the Victorian pathways program before eventually making her international debut in 2009. She cracked a classy 98 on Test debut against England and in the 13 years since has registered 3264 international runs, 22 fifties, five World Cup titles and four Ashes triumphs. Women’s Social Smash After leading the Sydney Thunder to its second Women’s Big Bash League title in 2020, Haynes missed last summer’s campaign due to border restrictions and quarantine requirements. Haynes and her partner Leah Poulton had recently welcomed their first child Hugo, and the 35-year-old planned to skip the opening WBBL matches while on parental leave. But border closures made it almost impossible for Haynes to join her Thunder teammates for the second half of the T20 tournament. During her extended break from professional cricket, Haynes travelled up to the northern beaches and took part in the Women’s Social Smash , a Cricket Australia initiative that is designed for women of all ages and abilities. While traditional forms of cricket can be confronting for new participants, the Social Smash focuses purely on engagement and social connection. Each Social Smash game is played with a shorter pitch and boundary; a soft ball is used and no protective gear is required. There are no outs and everyone gets to bat and bowl. It draws on the fundamentals of backyard cricket, where Haynes started her own journey to the Australian national team. “The thing that really resonated with me was that it really was an extension of the community,” she said. “It was just about people having a go and actually enjoying what they were doing. “It wasn’t about having all the new gear or needing to have a particular uniform or anything like that. You can literally walk off the street and play and not be out of place. “If cricket can continue to focus on those things and provide different opportunities for people to participate, then we might see the game continue to grow in different ways, rather than just in traditional formats.” Australia will come up against reigning champion England for its opening fixture of the Women’s Cricket World Cup, with the first ball scheduled for 12pm AEDT on Saturday. The squad’s preparations hit a snag on Tuesday when New Zealand all-rounder Sophie Devine plundered an unbeaten 161 off 117 balls to embarrass Australia’s world-class bowling attack. It was a rare thrashing for the Australians, but Haynes was not concerned by the nine-wicket defeat. “It was good for our bowling group to be under pressure, so we’ve got some good lessons to take out of today,” she told reporters at Christchurch’s Bert Sutcliffe Oval. “It’s a good thing to be put under the pump, particularly in a practice game. Sometimes that’s really had to contrive at training. “That’s the beauty of practice games.” Australia’s Women’s World Cup fixtures March 5 vs England, Seddon Park, Hamilton, 12pm AEDT March 8 vs Pakistan, Bay Oval, Tauranga, 12pm AEDT March 13 vs New Zealand, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 8am AEDT March 15 vs West Indies, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 8am AEDT March 19 vs India, Eden Park, Auckland, 12pm AEDT More Coverage Aussies’ tour of Pakistan starts on scary note ‘The best Test catch ever seen’ goes viral March 22 vs South Africa, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 8am AEDT March 25 vs Bangladesh, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 8am AEDT Australian batter Steve Smith has revealed a worrying repeat of debilitating vertigo symptoms delayed his recovery from concussion.

Mark Waugh was of a similar opinion, saying Agar comes in for Mitchell Starc — but only if the pitch conditions call for it. Adam Gilchrist was the only expert from the quartet to turn to Australia’s traditional attack of Pat Cummins, Hazlewood, Starc and Lyon. There was no room for Australia’s Ashes hero Scott Boland in any of the predicted XIs. All four predicted Australia would retain its top six from the final Ashes Test of David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head and Cameron Green, while Alex Carey will still wear the gloves despite his struggles at the Ashes. Meanwhile, not one of the former Test stars believe Australia will be triumphant in its first tour of Pakistan since 1998, when it won 1-0. Gilchrist, Julian and Waugh all predict a 1-1 score in the three Test series, while Vaughan believes Australia will go winless and lose 2-0. Australia is fresh off a massive 4-0 Ashes win over the summer, but it hasn’t toured the subcontinent since playing series against India and Bangladesh in 2017.

Wicketkeeper Nicole Faltum: Nicole has performed well with the bat as well behind the stumps. In three games, she has scored 138 runs while affecting six dismissals.

Last month, Smith concussed himself while attempting to prevent a boundary during the final over of a T20 match against Sri Lanka at the SCG. The 32-year-old was sidelined for the remainder of the white-ball series but recovered from the head knock in time for Australia’s flight to Pakistan last week. Watch Australia’s Tour of Pakistan on Kayo. Every Test, ODI and T20 Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > But speaking to reporters from his Islamabad hotel on Tuesday, Smith detailed how his recovery only progressed after vertigo symptoms were treated by the Epley manoeuvre. However, the Australian No. 4 was free from discomfort and “feeling good” ahead of his team’s first training session on Tuesday afternoon. “I’ve had headaches and drowsiness,” Smith said. “A couple of Fridays ago, I had a vertigo incident where I was struggling for a bit that day. “But I had the Epley manoeuvre and got the crystals back where they’re supposed to be in the inner ear – it’s not a very comfortable place to be, I will tell you that. “After that, things settled down and progressed really nicely. “I have been able to do all the exercise stuff that I needed to do to get myself back to that ready-to-play state, so everything is going well.” The right-hander nearly missed Australia’s ODI series against India in November 2020 due to an extreme bout of vertigo. He was vomiting on the morning of the first match due to the formation of small crystals in his middle ear. Steve Smith of Australia receives attention after hitting his head. Photo by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Smith is no stranger to concussion symptoms — he missed the third match of the 2019 Ashes series after England paceman Jofra Archer struck him on the neck during the Lord’s Test. And then in 2020, Smith was sidelined for most of Australia’s white-ball series against England after being hit in the head by a throw down from assistant coach Trent Woodhill. Smith only faced spin bowlers and side-arm throwdowns in the MCG practice nets ahead of the squad’s departure for Pakistan last week, and the former Australian captain needed to survive a pace bowling barrage on Tuesday to prove his fitness ahead of the first Test at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. “I have the opportunity to face some fast bowlers today which I am looking forward to,” Smith explained. “And I am looking forward to the next three days of prep before we get started on Friday. “The head has progressed really well the last few days so I am feeling in a good space. “I have done a lot of stuff where I have got my heart rate up to a good amount and brought it back down and that is part of the protocols of getting back to playing. “And I had a couple of good hits in Melbourne before we came away. “But today is obviously just about ticking off facing fast bowling. And once that is done, then everything should be fine.” Smith has scored 755 Test runs against Pakistan at an average of 53.92, with a high score of 165 not out at the MCG in December 2016. The New South Welshman also boasts a formidable away record in Test cricket, with 3883 runs to his name at 57.10. The only cricketer to have played more away Test matches while maintaining a higher batting average than Smith is England legend Wally Hammond with 66.32.

We have heard a numerous times how the commentators often find themselves at the edge of a slippery slope, where it takes just a few minutes or even an instant when their punditry is proved otherwise by the player in focus. Former England batter and skipper Kevin Pietersen too, had found himself in a similar sort of a situation when he tended to laugh off at the South African batter Temba Bavuma’s bowling ability. It happened during the first Test match of South Africa’s tour of Australia in 2016/17 at Perth. The Proteas batters had handed a stiff target of 539 to the Australian batters with Usman Khawaja batting at 84* alongside wicket-keeper batter Peter Nevill, and the scorecard reading 226/4. It was at that point that Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis handed the ball to Temba Bavuma, who was on the verge to bowl his first delivery in International Cricket. Pietersen, who apparently had earlier exclaimed he’d come out to bat if Bavuma was to bowl, had a quick glance at Bavuma’s First- Class bowling numbers, which along expected lines did not speak highly of his bowling abilities. “Let’s have a look at this. Let’s see if there should be a little bit more respect for his bowling in the commentary box. He averages 34, he’s got 4 wickets, the best of 2/34. Stats do not tell me that you would not have wanted to have faced what’s just about to be delivered. Please do not tell me, if you were sitting there on 84*, you’d be facing reverse swing from Philander, Rabada,” remarked Pietersen the moment Bavuma came on to bowl. Bavuma nearly strikes first ball Much to everyone’s amazement at the commentary box, including Pietersen’s, Bavuma bowled a short delivery which stayed low and struck Khawaja beneath his right pad’s knee roll in front of the stumps. While it looked Plumb, the umpire Nigel Llong, declared it a No-ball with Bavuma overstepping the line. While Bavuma covered his face with disappointment, Pietersen would have done the same with sheer disbelief on how lucky he was to get away from the embarrassment he would have faced had it not been a No-Ball. The Hawk-Eye, later on, confirmed that the ball would have crashed into the middle and leg stump.

The Mariners wrapped up their season last week with a climatic final-over win over Scarborough that saw them finish the season in 11th with six wins, one draw and eight losses. Although well down on last season’s second-place finish, the side was able to debut plenty of young players who will play a pivotal role going forward. “Although we didn’t get the wins, it probably ended up a bit of a successful year blooding the young guys,” Simmons said. “Obviously you start out wanting to play finals, but we lost Teague Wyllie for a big chunk of the season and he’s pretty important to our batting, as he showed on the last weekend with his 100.” The side registered some of their biggest defeats during Wyllie’s absence, including a 138-run loss to One-Day champions Subiaco-Floreat, but also pulled off some big wins such as knocking off last year’s finalists Wanneroo, with almost half the side at times under the age of 18. “We got to play Jye Donald who is 17, Albert Esterhuysen, who is a 15-year-old who looks outstanding, Mitch Zadow and Mitch Oliver, so we had a group of five or six guys who are 18 and under, and it culminated in five of them playing in the State 18s practice match,” Simmons said. “Hopefully they keep putting in the hard yards and we will see the benefit in the next year or two.” The Burrage brothers also continued to take strides forward, with Aaron leading the runs chart on 413 at 29.50 on top of making his maiden 1st Grade ton, while Damien made 319 runs at 24.54 to go with his keeping duties. Wyllie also starred despite missing a large chunk of the season while at the U19s World Cup, producing 354 runs at 50.57. However, the biggest story of the campaign came from the bowlers. After finding his feet last season, Adam France led all comers to take 21 wickets at 22.86. Aaron Burrage was also impressive with 18 wickets at 24.94, but the development of Ronan Hogarth caught the eye of those at the club as he grabbed 17 wickets at 21.29 to go with 92 runs with the bat. “Ronan Hogarth has been a 2nd Grade player for the majority of the last two years, but he stepped up this season,” Simmons said. “Ronan grew as a cricketer this year and everyone is happy for him after winning the Martin Baird Medal.” The Mariners may have also found a key piece of their batting puzzle with the return of Wesley Steele during the second half of the season. In just three games, he amassed 124 runs with an average of 41.33. “Wes was a bit of a find,” Simmons said. “He played 1st Grade for us as a 19-year-old two years ago and then with work, he went back and played local cricket. “He turned up after Christmas and said his work had changed a bit, and he wanted to come back and give it a crack. “If he can put in a reasonable pre-season, who knows where he will end up.” The team’s progress has even convinced Simmons to keep playing for another year and he said everyone was already looking forward to coming back. “We didn’t get the wins we’d have liked, but there’s still so many positives and we’re moving in the right direction,” he said. “We had some tough points in the last month or two, but to get some wins at the back end of the year keeps people on a bit of a high and looking forward to next season. “It’s a pretty exciting time for us as a club.”","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5807720/b1de72abd0be699471fce172349dcda80d931b95-16x9-x0y45w972h547.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes IPL 2022: Is Ben Stokes playing IPL 2022?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ben-stokes-ipl-2022-is-ben-stokes-playing-ipl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Stokes IPL 2022: The English all-rounder played just a single match for Rajasthan Royals during the previous edition of the IPL.

Ben Stokes IPL 2022 With England’s Test skipper Joe Root deciding to not put his name up for grabs at the mega auction table, Stokes too, with his captain’s bid to prioritize Test Cricket, decided to mark his unavailability for the two-day event. The 0-4 Ashes drubbing had made way for quite some ire and disappointment for England fans and Cricket experts, with quite a few of them even blaming the franchise T20 leagues like the IPL as the reason for the team’s downfall in the Test format. With England set to play Test series against New Zealand starting June 2, followed by one against South Africa, Stokes decided not to partake in IPL 2022 and play the County Championship instead. “It is why I thought long and hard about whether to go to the IPL or not, and felt that this was not about the money but about where my priorities are. It wouldn’t be fair on any team I signed up for if I wasn’t totally focused on things out there,” remarked Stokes. I think the Test side will benefit more from me playing a number of County Championship matches this summer and getting myself as best prepared as possible for the challenges of New Zealand and South Africa,” he further added. The 30-year-old first played in the IPL in 2017 for the now defunct Rising Pune SuperGiants and impressed one and all right away. He scored 316 runs and even scalped 12 wickets to emerge as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the season. He then played for the Rajasthan Royals until the league’s 14th season, post which he was decided not to be retained by the franchise ahead of the mega auction.

So then, you can understand which direction the Indian team is going in where they feel that if it's going to be a second keeper role, then they'll look at somebody younger.\" Karthik was sympathetic towards Saha, saying it was not easy for a cricketer to accept rejection. \"I'm pretty sure from wherever I've seen with Wriddhiman's interviews, he understands where this decision is coming from,\" the Tamil Nadu cricketer said in the ICC Review. \"I know no cricketer is going to accept that when you're being told to move on. It is a very hard one because this is what they've been doing day in and day out. \"All of us want to represent the country and that is the burning desire for everybody. So when somebody comes in says, 'I think your time is done,' it can be a hard one to swallow. But it is understandable and you have to understand where the selectors, the coach and the captain are coming from,\" Karthik said. He was all praise for Saha's contributions to Indian cricket. \"Kudos to Wriddhiman Saha. I think he has been one of those brilliant, quiet servants of Indian cricket who has done so well over a period of years.\" \"He is still one of the best wicketkeepers in the world, by a distance - I rate him as the best wicketkeeper in the world. He has got great hands, he moves really well... he is a terrific wicketkeeper. And add to the fact, he has a few centuries in international cricket and played some really crucial, important knocks when Team India needed it,\" Karthik added. But following the emergence of Pant, Karthik said it was understandable why the team management took the decision to move on from Saha. Promoted \"Just like MS Dhoni came in all those years ago, we've had a Rishabh Pant who's come in over the last couple of years and has done really well,\" he said. \"When that happens, Saha has obviously become the second wicketkeeper and he has been travelling with the team and playing the odd match here and there.\" The 37-year old Saha was left out from India's Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against Sri Lanka, with Pant and KS Bharat being chosen for the contests. Saha later revealed he was told by India head coach Rahul Dravid that the team would look to move on from the veteran. Saha has represented India in 40 Tests, scoring 1,353 runs with three centuries and six fifties and effected 104 dismissals.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/43spls0o_saha-pant-afp_625x300_01_March_22.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Naseem Shah added to Pakistan squad for first Test against Australia, Haris Rauf ruled out","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/naseem-shah-added-to-pakistan-squad-for-first-test-against-australia-haris-rauf-ruled-out-2022-03-01-762201","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Naseem Shah, who was originally a travelling reserve, has been included in the Pakistan squad for the first Test against Australia after Haris Rauf was ruled out after testing positive for COVID-19, Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Tuesday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-01 16:53:11","full_description":"Naseem Shah, who was originally a travelling reserve, has been included in the Pakistan squad for the first Test against Australia after Haris Rauf was ruled out after testing positive for COVID-19, Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Tuesday.

It feels good to be part of a historic tour which could see the full return of international cricket in Pakistan,\" Smith said in a media interaction ahead of the first Test of the three-match series starting in Rawalpindi on March 4. \"Many of us have come to Pakistan for the first time so it is an exciting tour for us and we are looking forward to some challenging cricket.\" Smith, who is the vice-captain of the side, also praised Pat Cummins for leading the team fantastically well in Test cricket. Smith, a former Australia captain, said they are expecting the pitches here to help the spinners. Smith also made it clear that they trusted the security measures put in place for them in Pakistan and he and his teammates felt \"incredibly safe\" on their first tour of Pakistan in nearly 24 years, a day after it was reported that spinner Ashton Agar's partner received a death threat via social media just days before the start of the first Test.

Smith said Pakistan had a good Test side and the people here are passionate about the game and the coming series should produce some competitive cricket. He was also asked about the concussion he sustained while fielding when his head hit the ground hard in a T20 match against Sri Lanka last month at Sydney and Smith said he was feeling okay and in good space. \"I think I have progressed well and it's the first session back for me facing fast bowling. I'm recovering from the concussion and I've faced some side-arm and spinners,\" Smith said.
