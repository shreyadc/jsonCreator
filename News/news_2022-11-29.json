We wish Phil well in his future endeavours,” said Mail.Meanwhile, the Blues on Monday announced that legspinner Adam Zampa would play a rare Shield match as he vies for a spot in the Test squad to tour India in early 2023.“It’s rare that Adam is available for Sheffield Shield, given his taxing white ball schedule but he has this week free and has always maintained his desire to play red-ball cricket,” NSW head of men’s cricket Michael Klinger said.“For us to be able to bring in a player of his calibre and experience is a welcome one. Toby Gray is unlucky to miss out after a strong debut last week but he is a young guy who will look to get more chances as his career develops.”","pubDate":"2022-11-28 23:03:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Like father, like son?

MCC cricket advisor Jonny Singer wrote: “‘We won’t glorify that by showing it to you further’It’s a man with a pride flag. They will probably go to prison now, but it’s an incredibly brave thing to do. Glorify it you bastards!” he wrote.“I get that we usually say pitch invasions aren’t welcome. I get that @itvfootball don’t have control over the broadcast feed. But, as a commentary team, you can speak about it. And to simply pass it off like that is a truly cowardly move.”Others watching on were quick to praise the brave man for defying the stringent laws and waving the pride flag on the pitch.Craig Foster after the game was full of praise for the act, letting the pitch invader know he’d always be welcome at his house.“Well done to him. You are always welcome in the Foster household,” he said on SBS.","pubDate":"2022-11-28 21:17:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ICC World Cup Super League scenarios - West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Ireland contest for one spot - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L2ljYy13b3JsZC1jdXAtc3VwZXItbGVhZ3VlLXNjZW5hcmlvcy13ZXN0LWluZGllcy1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2Etc3JpLWxhbmthLWFuZC1pcmVsYW5kLWNvbnRlc3QtZm9yLW9uZS1zcG90LTEzNDY4MTjSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"ICC World Cup Super League scenarios - West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Ireland contest for one spot  ESPNcricinfoIndia spot confirmed as Afghanistan earn place at 2023 World Cup  ICC CricketICC World Cup Super League Points: Afghanistan Qualify For World Cup 2023  ICC CRICKET SCHEDULEAfghanistan Qualify For 2023 ODI World Cup in India  News18Afghanistan seal ODI World Cup spot in India after washout game against Sri Lanka  The HinduView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-28 19:12:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Wild West: Aussies prepare for hostile ‘home’ crowd","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-vs-west-indies-cricket-justin-langer-fallout-may-linger-ahead-of-fiery-perth-test/news-story/ab53b8b0d051e54686f72c48bfcbb21d","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"They don’t call it the Wild West for nothing …","content":"It’s anyone’s guess what fate awaits the Australians when they walk out on suddenly hostile turf against the West Indies in Perth this week.In all probability skipper Pat Cummins will take the new ball from the end where a grandstand is named after Justin Langer, the controversial former Australian coach who may be out of favour with Cricket Australia but remains a favourite local son.One small mercy for Australia is if they do cop a ribbing is the knowledge that others have copped worse.At least they won’t be trailed into the dressing room by a fan and get a compressed ball of wet newspaper thrown into their faces!This year is the 30th anniversary of a Test against the Windies in Perth when champion gloveman Ian Healy copped this unexpected serve after he was followed down the players’ race by an angry fan who threw a rolled up ball of newspaper in Healy’s face, prompting him to drop his bat and helmet.The source of the outrage was that Healy had committed the unforgivable “crime’’ of been chosen ahead of Perth gloveman Tim Zoehrer in the Australian Test side.The incident sparked frantic scenes and the man was later arrested and ejected from the ground.“The guy was a country cricketer and I think he was down for their country week,’’ Healy told News Corp.“A few of us were copping it over there. I remember Mike Whitney was copping it as well. “I copped it because of the Tim Zoehrer thing but it was broader than that and quite widespread.’’Former Test stars who have felt the wrath of Perth’s parochialism will be surprised if there is no crowd fallout to the Langer affair, no matter how small the crowd is at Optus Stadium. “Justin is a golden haired boy in Perth so I would expect something for sure,’’ Healy said.“I think there will probably be a bit of angst there.’’Players in Allan Border’s teams of the mid-1980s used to joke that Perth was Australia’s first “away’’ game of the season. “It came from the fact there were a lot of English and South African people living in Perth so they would be well supported and our own support was not great,’’ Healy said.Perth has always been protective of its own. Adam Gilchrist also copped some sledging when he moved from Sydney to take over from Zoehrer at state level for West Australia.If Gilchrist can cop it any one can.","pubDate":"2022-11-28 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Extra sting’: Thunder signs Pakistani star","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/extra-sting-to-our-attack-pakistan-spinner-returns-to-bbl-in-huge-boost-for-the-thunder/news-story/71c2738005d3c09d860f1ed3b27be0ef","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","NewsWire"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Qadir will return to the Big Bash League after the Pakistani leg-spinner signed a deal to join the Sydney Thunder four years after his last appearance in the competition with the Scorchers.","content":"The 29-year-old, who is the son of the legendary Abdul Qadir, once harboured ambitions to play for Australia before he eventually opted to represent Pakistan.Qadir played local cricket in Sydney and Adelaide, represented the Scorchers and Western Australia and was picked in the Prime Minister’s XI side where he claimed three wickets against South Africa four years ago.He returns to the BBL four years after he claimed six wickets in seven matches for the Scorchers and will provide plenty of international experience having taken 29 wickets in 23 T20 internationals.

Pant has looked subdued in limited overs cricket this year, scoring just one fifty in the shortest format way back in February against the West Indies, while crossing the 30-run mark only twice in the 21 innings that he has played in 2022. In ODIs, the 25-year-old had two fifties and a hundred in the nine innings he has played this year. “Maybe you can give him (Pant) a break and tell him ‘just wait a bit, come and play in India’, they haven’t handled him well. Are you going to wait for a couple of matches before giving him a break or remove him after one or two games?” Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel Cheeky Cheeka. “Yes, Rishabh Pant is not utilising the chances he’s getting. I am very disappointed – ennada Pant-u (what is this Pant)?” he added. Pant scored only 17 runs in the T20I series against New Zealand, while he was dismissed for 15 in the first ODI. “You are messing up these chances. If you smash into such matches, it’ll be good right? The World Cup is coming up. Already a lot of people are saying that Pant isn’t scoring so it’ll add fuel to the fire,” Srikkanth, a former India opener, said. “He’s going to put pressure on himself. He needs to reinvent himself. He has to do something right – stand and play for a while and then go for it…He’s throwing his wicket away all the time.” India will take on New Zealand in the third and final ODI on Wednesday in Christchurch. —PTI You are messing up chances, need to reinvent game: Srikkanth to Pant added by Press Trust of India on 12:17 am November 29, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-28 18:47:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sky Sports to film inside dressing rooms and interview bosses during games in English football first","link":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/9839828/sky-sports-film-inside-dressing-rooms-interviews/","keywords":["Football","Sport","Sky Sports"],"creator":["Dylan Terry"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"SKY SPORTS will debut in-game interviews and cameras inside dressing room for the first time in English football this weekend.

It couldn’t be confirmed whether former pacer Ajit Agarkar has applied or not. According to many, Agarkar has a sure-shot chance of becoming selection committee chairman with his international credentials, if he decides to apply. Salil Ankola, current chairman of senior Mumbai team, former keeper Samir Dighe and the flamboyant Vinod Kambli are said to have applied from Mumbai. As the date of application for the new panel closed at 6.00pm Monday, it is understood that more than 50 persons have applied but there aren’t too many heavyweights in the fray. Among the confirmed applicants, no one has played more Tests than Maninder (35) while Das (21) is second in that list. However, Maninder had applied in 2021 also and despite qualifying for the interview round, he was pipped by Chetan Sharma, who was the choice of erstwhile Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) headed by Madan Lal. Chetan, in fact, had played lesser number of matches as compared to Maninder but stature-wise both were almost of same category, having been young stars of mid to late 1980s before fading away. “Yes, I have applied,” Maninder confirmed to this agency. Sources in the know confirmed that Das, who is currently senior Punjab team’s batting coach, has applied and with East Zone barely producing Test players of repute, he stands a very good chance to become a selector. But, it is not confirmed if Das’ home state Odisha will back his candidature. Last time, Agarkar, despite being the favourite, didn’t get the job as the former MCA regime hadn’t backed him as the officials wanted Abey Kuruvilla. The other names from North zone are lightweight former cricketers. From North zone, apart from Maninder, Atul Wassan, Nikhil Chopra (Delhi), Ajay Ratra (Haryana) and Reetinder Singh Sodhi (Punjab) are former India players who have thrown their hat into the ring. From East zone, save Das, other names are really lightweight. They include Prabhanjan Mullick, Rashmi Ranjan Parida from Odisha, Subhamoy Das, Saradindu Mukherjee and Sourasish Lahiri from Bengal. Deep Dasgupta and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (current Bengal coach) – two former India players – have decided against applying. From central zone, Amay Khurasiya of Madhya Pradesh and Gyanendra Pandey of Uttar Pradesh are believed to have applied. While there are no written rules, BCCI normally believes in convention of equal distribution and hence five junior and five senior selectors in recent times have been from 10 different states.

Another former HCA chief G Vinod too echoed similar feelings. “We have met the four-member panel and expressed our grievances. We have conducted a meeting with former HCA club secretaries and former HCA officials and presidents. We are requesting the panel to convene AGM soon and conduct the elections. The image of the HCA has tarnished in the last three years because of Azharuddin .” HCA former secretary Shesh Narayan said that they are going to convene a special general body meeting on December 11 at the Uppal stadium and requested the BCCI to send an observer.

The committee will also try to bring more and more international matches, including World Cup encounters, to Guwahati. The new office-bearers of the Assam Cricket Association were elected unanimously in the Annual General Meeting of the Association which was held at the ACA Stadium, Barsapara here today. MLA Taranga Gogoi was elected as president and Tridip Konwar as the secretary. The other office-bearers are Chiranjit Langthasa (treasurer), Rajdeep Oja (vice president), Rajinder Singh (joint secretary) and Anupam Deka (Apex Council member). Talking to media persons after the end of the Annual General Meeting, president Gogol said, \"Our outgoing committee has done a good job on the infrastructural development work across the state during their tenure. We will also continue it and you can say that it will be on our priority list.\" Gogoi also admitted that Guwahati may get a match in the forthcoming ODI series between India and Sri Lanka which is scheduled to be held in January. \"It is not confirmed yet. BCCI officials will soon visit Guwahati and after that, we can tell you whether the match is allotted to us or not. However, one thing I can say is that we will try to bring more and more international matches including that of the forthcoming World Cup in Guwahati along with a few games of IPL,\" said Gogoi.

There were some predictions of rain threatening to disrupt the proceedings, but it washed off the match. Before rain eventually prevailed, 12.5 overs of play was possible as India were pushed into batting first by New Zealand, who won the toss for the second time in as many matches of this series.Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav entertained the crowd with some scintillating stroke-play on a pitch which was aiding fast bowlers. Suryakumar hit three glorious sixes in his unbeaten 25-ball 34, while Gill was crisp in his timing and placement of shots to be 45 not out off 42 deliveries. For New Zealand, pacer Matt Henry took out captain Shikhar Dhawan for just three just after the match was reduced to 29 overs a side affair due to a lengthy rain interruption. The washout means India cannot win the series now and their best chance now is to square the ODI series in the final match of the tour at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Wednesday. Earlier, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson won the toss for the second time in the series, and elected to bowl first again. The toss had been delayed by 15 minutes due to cloudy conditions, and the pitch being covered in the run-up to the match. New Zealand made one change: - bringing in spin all-rounder Michael Bracewell in place of fast bowler Adam Milne. India made two changes: - Deepak Chahar and Deepak Hooda came in place of Shardul Thakur and Sanju Samson. Shubman Gill drove elegantly past mid-on twice and cut Tim Southee fiercely through cover. But rain arrived and cut short the proceedings as India were 22/0 in 4.5 overs. Rain kept play away for nearly nearly three and half hours, before it stopped for the match to resume, Now reduced to 29-overs-a-side, India needed to up the ante from the word go. In a bid to do so, Shikhar Dhawan mistimed his chipped drive of Henry to mid-on on the second ball after the resumption of play. But the rain returned again, forcing the players off the field. With the downpour becoming heavier, the bigger covers came on the pitch and outfield. But rain refused to relent and the game was finally called off as umpires shook hands with both captains.

For coach Walid Regragui, who took charge of Morocco in September, the match against Belgium was his sixth in charge and till now they have kept clean-sheets in all six games with him at the helm of affairs. This is Morocco's finest World Cup moment as Atlas Lions scripted their third-ever win at a World Cup and stand a great chance to qualify for the knockout stage. For Morocco, ranked 22, the two other World Cup wins came in 1998 when they trounced Scotland 3-0 and in 1986 they stunned the football world with a 3-1 win over Portugal and qualified for the knockout stage. The North Africans have not reached the knockout rounds since 1986. The win, their first in 24 years, sends Morocco into first place in the group with four points after having drawn goalless with 2018 runner-up Croatia, who take on Canada in the last match on Sunday. Belgium, who were far from impressive in their first match of the group, which they won 1-0 against Canada, have three points from two matches and next face Croatia, Morocco beating Belgium is the third major upset of the championship which is into its eighth day. In the earlier matches, Argentina ranked third on the FIFA computer had crashed to a 2-1 loss against Saudi Arabia ranked 51, while World No.11 Germany had lost by an identical score to Japan, who are ranked 13 places below the Germans. Morocco had to make a last-minute change to their starting XI when goalkeeper Yassine Bounou pulled out after the anthems -- for reasons not yet specified -- and was replaced by Monir El Kajoui. The understudy made an early save to settle any nerves when smothering an attempt by Michy Batshuayi at close range. Morocco had the majority of the crowd at Al Thumama Stadium on their side and they thought they had given them a goal to celebrate in stoppage time at the end of the first half when Hakim Ziyech whipped in a free-kick from wide on the right that beat Thibaut Courtois at his near post. However, Romain Saiss, standing right in front of the goalkeeper, was ruled offside after a VAR check. Sabiri's introduction after 68 minutes was his cue to spark arguably Morocco's greatest World Cup victory. He still has not started a game for his country in a World Cup but took just five minutes to score the most important goal of his life, on what was his fourth international outing, whipping in a free-kick from a position wide on the left, just a metre or two from the touchline into the near post and beating Courtois, who has come off his line ready to try and take the cross. Roberto Martinez's 2018 semifinalists fell again this time in stoppage time. El Kajoui's long goal-kick was headed back towards his own goal by a Belgian defender.Also Read: India remain on top Cricket World Cup Super League (CWCSL), New Zealand move up to 3rd spotAlso Watch: ","pubDate":"2022-11-28 14:16:02","image_url":"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2022/11/28/416836-morocco-v-belgium.jpg","source_id":"sentinel","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Badani, Mongia, Ratra, Das apply to India selector post - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmF5YW4tbW9uZ2lhLXNoaXYtc3VuZGVyLWRhcy1hamF5LXJhdHJhLWFwcGx5LWZvci1pbmRpYS1zZWxlY3Rvci1wb3N0LTEzNDY4MDPSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L25heWFuLW1vbmdpYS1zaGl2LXN1bmRlci1kYXMtYWpheS1yYXRyYS1hcHBseS1mb3ItaW5kaWEtc2VsZWN0b3ItcG9zdC0xMzQ2ODAzP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Badani, Mongia, Ratra, Das apply to India selector post  ESPNcricinfoNayan Mongia, Hemang Badani, Shiv Sunder Das, and Ajay Ratra apply for India selector post  CricTrackerManinder Singh, Shiv Sunder Das and Nayan Mongia Among Notable Names in Contention for Senior Selectors' Po  News18Hemang Badani, Nayan Mongia, Shiv Sunder Das Apply To India Selector Post  Cricket AddictorManinder Singh, Nayan Mongia re-apply for national selection panel  Hindustan TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-28 14:13:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England Test team arrive in Islamabad","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/england-test-team-arrive-in-islamabad-625715","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"England Cricket shared a video of team arrival at Islamabad airport on their various social media handles. “Touchdown in Pakistan for our Men’s Test squad,”","content":"ISLAMABAD: The Ben Stokes-led England Test team touched down in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, in the early hours of Sunday, ahead of playing a three-match Test series against the Babar Azam-led side. England Cricket shared a video of team arrival at Islamabad airport on their various social media handles. \"Touchdown in Pakistan for our Men's Test squad,\" read the caption. England's Test squad had spent time in Abu Dhabi as part of the preparation for the series against Pakistan. England will be playing a Test series on Pakistani soil after a gap of 17 years. They last played a Test match in Pakistan in 2005, losing the three-match series by 2-0. The visitors' had played a seven-match T20I series here in September-October, which they won 4-3. England were scheduled to visit Pakistan last year, but pulled out shortly after New Zealand abandoned their tour just before the first ODI in Rawalpindi could begin, citing security reasons. There was a scare of the first Test being shifted from Rawalpindi, following an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister and 1992 World Cup winning captain Imran Khan earlier this month. The three Tests between Pakistan and England are part of the ICC World Test Championship's second cycle and are scheduled to be played in Rawalpindi (December 1-5), Multan (December 9-13) and Karachi (December 17-21). The upcoming Tests against England is Pakistan's fifth series in the current WTC cycle - their last series will be the two Tests against New Zealand at home in December 2022 and January 2023. These three Tests will be England's final appearance in the second edition of the World Test Championship, where they are ranked seventh as compared to Pakistan's fifth position in the table.

The match began under gloomy skies and a threat of rain but it stayed away for the toss to happen. Hosts New Zealand opted to bowl first and India openers Shikhar Dhawan and Shubman Gill started cautiously before the rain disrupted their innings on 22/0 in the fifth over. A long delay ensued with the rain threatening to overpower at every inspection. Finally, the play resumed after nearly three and half hours, reduced to 29-overs-a-side. The long break brought Dhawan's downfall as Matt Henry removed him on the second ball after the resumption. Suryakumar Yadav joined Gill in the middle and together the duo began accelerating with Gill approaching his second half-century of the series.

It also included a major topic regarding the allowance of frequent breaks for senior cricketers between series throughout the year.Now, former India player Ajay Jadeja added another point to the controversy taking the names of India’s head coach Rahul Dravid and batting coach Vikram Rathore. The duo took a rest after the World Cup and missed the ongoing multi-format tour in New Zealand.While speaking on Amazon Prime Video, Jadeja made a stern remark that he believes coaches don’t need any break as they get plenty of time for that during the IPL season. “In the IPL, you have a break for two or two-and-a-half months. They are, after all, my friends. I’ve known Vikram Rathour for a very long time. Dravid has played excellent cricket for India. I have no intention to disrespect them. However, you only work in this position only for two years. So, they should invest everything in it like the players,” he stated.Moreover, Jadeja cleared the reasons behind his thought. According to him, the side will get very little time before the Bangladesh tour where India will play a couple of Tests along with a three-match ODI series. Thus, Dravid needed to be with the Test squad during this time and it would have enhanced their performance in the red-ball fixtures.“There will be players travelling from this country to Bangladesh, with a four-day break in between,” Jadeja further explained.Previously, ex-India coach Ravi Shastri also made the same kind of statement in a virtual interview session. He shed light on the benefits of spending more time with the players and asked, “To be honest, why do you need that many breaks?”Along with Dravid and Rathore, a number of first-team players including skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli did not travel to New Zealand. It paved a way for youngsters to wear the Blue jersey. As a replacement, VVS Laxman was bestowed the responsibility to guide the side as the interim head coach.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The Family Hockey Tournament remains a popular event and there are several talented youngsters who emerge in these matches. Many such players from rural areas learn their craft on natural surfaces. Since all major tournaments are now conducted on synthetic surfaces and youngsters from the more affluent countries begin their hockey journeys by playing on such grounds, it confers a great advantage to players from these countries. Fascinated by the interest and passion for hockey in Kodagu and not missing any Family Tournaments in his home district, Dr. Kuppanda Tilak Ponappa draws examples from other sports and presents the argument in this article that hockey players should be able to adapt to different surfaces including natural ones. Perhaps, such a move will ‘level the playing field’ and enable our once great subcontinental teams to compete with the very best in the world. — Ed The early days To people of the Indian subcontinent, hockey refers to ‘Field hockey,’ and is distinct from ‘Ice hockey’ that super-fast, ultra-violent sport played in the frigid northern latitudes. Field hockey was introduced to India by the British during the colonial era. Indians soon took to the game and were quickly dominating the English teams, and indeed, everyone else. Indian players were famous for their skilful dribbling, clever passing, body swerves and general artistry. India remained the pre-eminent team in the world for many decades. In the Summer Olympics, India was dominant between 1928 and 1956, winning gold in Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Berlin, London, Helsinki and Melbourne. Another Indian gold medal in Tokyo (1964) was sandwiched between the two Pakistani triumphs of 1960 and 1968. Cracks in the pre-eminence of subcontinental hockey became evident in the 1970s. During this period, the victory in the World Cup final over Pakistan in 1975 proved to be a high point for India. By the time the Moscow Olympics rolled around in 1980, India was no longer a dominant force. That year, although India did win its eighth (and last) Olympic gold medal in hockey, it perhaps lacks the lustre of the previous seven golds, as many of the best teams of that era boycotted the tournament for political reasons. The partition of India and the creation of Pakistan saw the two neighbours play each other in many an epic battle, featuring their exciting style of hockey. Pakistan produced numerous excellent teams that won three Olympic golds, three silvers and two bronze medals from 1956 through 1992; in addition, our neighbours have won the prestigious World Cup four times having last triumphed in 1994. Sadly, neither of these teams rules the sport any longer. In the past, there was something about a hockey victory by India, especially during the colonial era and soon after Independence, that gave the sporting public a great sense of pride. But things change, and many factors have resulted in a host of European teams as well as Australia, New Zealand and Argentina being major powers in the sport. A sketch of hockey in Kodagu by Dr. Tilak Ponappa’s wife Patricia Taylor. Why do teams from the Indian subcontinent no longer dominate hockey? All sports evolve over time. Technologically advanced countries probably analysed the all-conquering Asian hockey teams and developed means to counter them. Gradually, the Europeans and Australians began to catch up to the subcontinental teams and eventually surpass them. Furthermore, numerous changes were implemented in the rules of hockey. Some of these were ostensibly to speed up the game and make it more visually appealing to television audiences; although the end result may have been detrimental to the Indians and Pakistanis. A major change was the switch from natural to synthetic surfaces that were inaccessible to many players in these countries. I suggest that, at least in India and other developing countries, there would be much to be gained by returning to the natural surfaces where the game was first played and rose to popularity. In order to emphasise this issue, perhaps we can look at the way some other sports are conducted. READ ALSO Two houses burgled in Kodagu; three coffee estate labourers arrested A case in point would be ‘lawn’ tennis where the surfaces vary depending on the tournament. Two of the major championships, the Australian Open and the US Open, are now played on synthetic courts. Wimbledon, on the other hand, is played on grass; whereas the French Open is conducted on clay. Many giants of the sport have had limited success in adapting to courts that were relatively unfamiliar to them. For instance, the American stars, Jimmy Connors and Pete Sampras were unable to conquer the red clay of Roland-Garros at singles, although they had great success at the other major tournaments. A Wimbledon title eluded Ivan Lendl, though he won multiple major tournaments on surfaces other than grass. All sports change over time. Modern-day tennis players use racquets with large sweet spots and are able to generate incredible pace and topspin. However, the introduction of these enormous racquets means that we seldom see the kind of finesse and ‘touch’ exhibited by the brilliant John McEnroe, our own Ramesh Krishnan or his father Ramanathan Krishnan. While considering cricket, especially the exacting Test match version, there is little question that the playing surface has a great effect on performance. In fact, much of Test cricket’s charm results from the pitch’s characteristics. The nature of the soil, the amount of grass on the surface and the methods used in the preparation of the pitch, all contribute to the ebb and flow of the game and its ‘glorious uncertainties’. Consequently, the ability to adapt to the initial state of the surface, as well as its changing nature over a five day Test match is vital to a cricketer’s success. There is an abundance of sporting talent in the little district of Coorg (Kodagu) in Karnataka. The hardy people of these hills have excelled in various athletic endeavours, but the sport that seems to be closest to their hearts is hockey. The annual ‘Hockey Festival’ in Kodagu is a significant event in the local calendar. Hundreds of Kodava families participate in the tournament wherein the skills of many talented rural players are on display. Although the fields may be grass or gravel, the matches are often riveting, indicating that a synthetic surface is not imperative for the sport to be exciting. Despite the all-pervasive presence of cricket in the media, and the general impression that interest in hockey is on the wane, it is encouraging to note that there remains isolated pockets in India, including Kodagu, Punjab and Odisha, where hockey still holds a special place in the hearts of sports enthusiasts. Dr. Tilak Ponappa Conclusion India was once a great hockey playing nation. However, for various reasons, it has been many decades since teams from the Indian subcontinent have dominated the sport. Since the inaugural World Cup in 1971, India’s best result in the competition was achieved way back in 1975, when they were crowned champions. Unfortunately, replicating this early success in the prestigious tournament has proved to be elusive. The bronze medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was a significant achievement considering the country’s previous Olympic medal at hockey was earned in the boycott-marred, truncated Moscow Olympic competition of 1980. Although the silver medal in the recently conducted Commonwealth Games of 2022 is a creditable achievement for our men’s team, losing 0-7 to the mighty Australians illustrates the gulf that needs to be bridged before we can get back to the very top of the sport. As the country develops on all fronts, one looks forward to more progress in the sport and hopes that appropriate steps are taken for the team to reach the summit again. Perhaps making a pitch for putting the ‘field’ back in hockey will be one such measure. How can we attract more youngsters to hockey? 1. Allow the use of different playing surfaces READ ALSO Injured wild tusker dies in Kodagu A talented young hockey player in rural India may not have access to artificial turf. The skills needed to succeed on a natural surface are different from those required for synthetic surfaces. By the time the player is proficient enough to be selected for a training facility with access to artificial surfaces, new skills will have to be learned and old ones unlearned, putting the youngster at a disadvantage. The use of artificial turf, often coloured blue, was thought to facilitate television viewing. Today, however, multiple, high-quality cameras would likely capture the nuances of the sport regardless of the playing surface. Perhaps it is time to play major international hockey tournaments on either natural or synthetic surfaces, depending on convenience. The teams that can adapt to different types of surfaces will be more successful as in the case of a tennis player who is able to win all four major tournaments and earn the coveted Grand Slam, or a cricket team that wins at home and abroad. 2. Reduce the chance for injury and the need for protective equipment While playing hockey on uneven surfaces and indeed on any surface, perhaps we can take a step back for reasons of player safety and ensure that the ball remains on the pitch, or not more than a few inches above the ground, except when ‘scooped’. Strong enforcement of the old rule of ‘sticks,’ whereby a hockey stick may not be raised above shoulder level when taking a shot, would also reduce the likelihood of injury. 3. Encourage the scoring of more field goals Modifying rules to enable the scoring of more field goals and reducing the emphasis on ‘corners’ may well make the game more exciting. To this end, perhaps doing away with frightening drag flicks that could seriously maim defenders would be useful. Again, such measures will also reduce the necessity for expensive protective gear that may not be easily available or affordable to poorer countries. Although not related to this argument, reinstating the unique ‘bully’ to start the game would restore some old-world charm. 4. Look after the interests of hockey players in the developing world As in most walks of life, money matters. Compared to many developing countries and indeed several other nations that are considered “advanced,” India has become relatively wealthy after shrugging off the colonial yoke. Thanks to shrewd marketing and administrative strategies, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has harnessed the passion of our enormous population for cricket. Consequently, the BCCI is flush with funds and does not have to kowtow to the cricket boards of other countries. If our hockey administrators were as influential as the BCCI, changes proposed by the world body that may prove to be detrimental to the sport in our country could be opposed. Also, popularising hockey with the country’s youths would be an important step forward. Promising young players need to feel a passion for the sport, pride in the country’s past success and perhaps view hockey as being just as glamorous as cricket. 5. Identify talent early A scientific approach to identifying and grooming promising players is essential. In the highly competitive world of American football, players are constantly evaluated for parameters pertinent to that sport. Very often, but not always, elite athletes end up being exceptional football players. Conversely, some of the greatest professional players have not necessarily been the best athletes. Apart from being conversant with modern techniques, our hockey coaches must pick players who are not only sufficiently athletic but also have the temperament to succeed at the highest level. Excellence must be rewarded. Dr. Tilak Ponappa is a planter based in Kodagu. Previously, he used to conduct scientific research in the area of plant biology.

A gentleman in every sense of the word.— Brendan Powell (@bpowell13) November 27, 2022 A mainstay on BBC’s Grandstand Grand National coverage, Hanmer worked as Peter O’Sullevan’s commentary assistant from 1971 to 1997. During these years he would take over as the runners bounded across the Melling Road during the Aintree showpiece run every April. Current racing commentator Ian Bartlett worked with Hanmer – who passed away on Sunday – for a decade at the Beeb. He said the racing and cricket fanatic would always make people laugh and was the ultimate professional. Barty told the Racing Post: “He was a tremendously polite man with a fantastic sense of humour. “I had lunch with him two weeks ago and his memory for things going back to the Fifties was fantastic and he was still razor sharp.” Most read in Horse Racing 'NOT SCARED' Brave ITV Racing star Leonna Mayor on her 'rapidly worsening' skin condition FIVER FLUTTER Three longshots to bash the bookies from Monday's top racing action TEMPLEGATE'S TIPS My NAP looks certain to improve in Listed contest for the Gosdens HORSING AROUND Ridiculous moment groundsmen are almost RUN OVER at hurdle during horse race UP THE ANTE Cheltenham hero looks nice price to make it three in a row for brilliant owners DOWN & OUT Bryony Frost rushed to hospital after bone-crunching fall as horse causes chaos Racing TV presenter Lydia Hislop was among those who paid tribute.
