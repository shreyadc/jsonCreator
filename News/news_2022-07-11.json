Yadav made 117 from 55 balls and went close to overhauling England’s mighty total of 215-7 in a typical runfest at Trent Bridge. England won by 17 runs and Buttler enjoyed his first victory since taking over from Eoin Morgan as white-ball captain. But India still won the Twenty20 series 2-1. Yadav scored his runs after India’s much-vaunted top three of Rishabh Pant, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were dismissed inside the first five overs. Reece Topley, the 6ft 7in left-arm seamer who has overcome several stress fractures of the back, took two of those wickets and a third later when Shreyas Iyer, who put on 119 with Yadav for the fourth wicket, under-edged a catch behind. Player of the Match Topley said: “You have to ride the game when things go your way because there are a lot of times when they don’t. “I’m not a big cricket watcher so I’ve not really seen Yadav play before. There were some amazing shots but I also felt we were always taking his wicket away from winning the match.” Richard Gleeson, who made such an impressive debut in England’s defeat at Edgbaston on Saturday, had another good game with 1-31 in four overs. Yadav advanced from 50 to 100 in just 16 balls and showed he can hit the ball through 360 degrees with his wrist work and imagination. After chasing in the first two games and losing by 50 runs and 49 runs, England batted first against and Indian attack lacking their two stars bowlers in Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah, both rested with the series already secure. FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS Buttler’s modest sequence continued when, after three juicy boundaries, he dragged on. And Jason Roy again struggled with 27 from 26 deliveries until he was caught behind. Dawid Malan made India pay for dropping him on four – a relatively straightforward caught and bowled chance to Harshal Patel – and surged to 77 from just 39 balls. Malan is frequently overlooked or underestimated as a T20 batsmen alongside more power-packed players such as Buttler or Liam Livingstone. But he has previously been ranked No.1 in the world in the shortest format and is still fourth in the list. Livingstone made 42 not out, with four sixes, and England went past 200 on the highest-scoring ground in the country. A three-match 50-over series against India begins at the Oval on Tuesday. Skipper Buttler said: “That was good fun and much more like what we’re used to seeing with the bat after a couple of disappointing performances in the previous two games. “That was an incredible knock from Yadav, one of the best hundreds I’ve seen.”","pubDate":"2022-07-10 18:57:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket gold: Birthday boy Sunil Gavaskar imitates Imran Khan and other Pakistan bowlers in rare video","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/cricket-gold-birthday-boy-sunil-gavaskar-imitates-imran-khan-and-other-pakistan-bowlers-in-rare-video-2483812.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Gavaskar became the first cricketer to reach 10,000 Test runs milestone an incredible feat that was unbelievable at the time.","content":"Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar is celebrating his 73rd birthday on July 10, 2022.

Sunil Gavaskar bowling leg-spin imitating Abdul Qadir. pic.twitter.com/xqmgGQy704 — Mazher Arshad (@MazherArshad) July 10, 2020 Gavaskar, better known as 'Sunny' and 'Little Master', made and broke many records in his spectacular cricketing career on the field. He played many historic innings for Indian cricket from 1971 to 1987. Gavaskar holds various batting records in the longest format of the game. Member of the 1983 World Cup-winning once held the record for scoring most centuries in Tests. Gavaskar, who scored more than 10,000 runs in Test matches, scored 45 half-centuries with 34 centuries in Test matches. Today on the occasion of his birthday, let's revisit some of his finest records. In March 1987, Gavaskar became the first cricketer to reach 10,000 Test runs milestone an incredible feat that was unbelievable at the time. Gavaskar's Test career ended with 10,122 runs. Sunny, for a pretty long time, led the list of most hundreds. After featuring in 125 Test matches, he smashed 34 centuries. Later, in 2005, the record was smashed by 'God of cricket', Sachin Tendulkar. Little Master smashed 13 centuries against mighty West Indies in the 27 matches he played against them. The 70s and 80s era were very impressive for West Indies as they were formidable to defeat. But they were Gavaskar's favourite team when it came to scoring runs and making bowlers dance to his tune. Gavaskar loved to smash Windies bowlers all around the ground. He smashed 774 runs in his debut series against the West Indies in 1971 and played so many memorable innings in that series alone that a list can be made from him. He also scored a double century in this series. He was an impressive batter and a shrewd fielder too. Excluding the wicket keepers, he was the first Indian fielder to achieve a milestone of a century in terms of catches in Test cricket. For the record, he has taken 108 catches in his Test career.","pubDate":"2022-07-10 18:44:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Need a way to play the best available players”: Virender Sehwag exclaims India not picking players on current form in T20Is","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-need-a-way-to-play-the-best-available-players-virender-sehwag-exclaims-india-not-picking-players-on-current-form-in-t20is/","keywords":["Cricket","India tour of England 2022","Virender Sehwag"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virender Sehwag exclaims India are not picking in-form players despite enough of their availability in dug-out post 3rd T20I versus England.

During the third and final T20I of the ongoing India’s tour of England at the Trent Bridge in Notttingham, the entire stadium were up on their feet to acknowledge a T20 innings of the highest order by Suryakumar Yadav , who smashed his maiden T20I century in mere 48 deliveries. The agonizing part though, is that despite his 55-ball 117 which comprised of 14 Fours and 6 Sixes, team India failed to get over the line en route the stiff target of 216 handed by Jos Buttler’s men, as they eventually lost the match by 17 runs. A part of the loss had to do with the poor start the top-3 Indian batters – Rohit Sharma (11 off 12), Rishabh Pant (1 off 5), and out-of-form Virat Kohli (11 off 6) gave their side, as they were reduced to 31/3 in mere 5 Overs. A record 4th wicket partnership of 119 off mere 62 deliveries between Yadav and Shreyas Iyer (28 off 23) from there on, brought team India right back into the contest, but with Dinesh Karthik (6 off 7) and Ravindra Jadeja (7 off 4) failing to hand some heavy blows alongside Yadav later in the chase, meant that team India could eventually post 198/9 in their 20 Overs. Under the scanner by fans on social media was Virat Kohli, who failed yet again in the series , adding on to his lean patch of form with the bat in hand for quite some time now. Former India batter Virender Sehwag, took to his social media handle minutes post team India’s loss, to exclaim that the team has the pool of batters who can play their shots right from the get-go, but are unfortunately not getting enough opportunity to showcase their ability by warming the benches. He further added that the team management needs to find a way to include players in the playing XI on the basis of current form, and perhaps not as per their reputation.

Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the third over, Yadav hit his sixth delivery for a boundary off England pacer Richard Gleeson. Despite India losing their third wicket in the form of captain Rohit Sharma (11) inside the powerplay , Yadav continued to find boundaries in a 216-run chase. Having hit a four and six off England all-rounder David Willey right after the powerplay, Yadav hit four more boundaries in the next two overs bowled by Chris Jordan and Liam Livingstone. It was on the first delivery of the 12th over that Yadav took a single off Reece Topley to complete a half-century. Not letting go of any opportunity to attack a part-time bowler in Livingstone, Yadav hit a couple of sixes in the following over to keep India alive in the match.

Bhuvi was the Player of the Match in India's 49-run win over England on Saturday that saw Rohit Sharma and Co earn an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the three-match T20I series. The fast bowler finished with figures of 3 for 15 in his quota of four overs, which also included a maiden over. \"I've been here quite a few times but it didn't swing in the last few series I've played here. Yes, even I was a bit surprised that the white ball is swinging and is swinging for a long period of time, especially in the T20 format. There's a bit more bounce on the wicket as well. So when the ball is swinging, you enjoy it more. Honestly, I don't know if I'm swinging it, some conditions or if it's the ball. But I'm glad it's swinging more. \"If it swings, which is my strength, I can get on to the attack. You see batters attacking when the wicket is flat. They play all the shots. In both these matches, the ball swung and I was able to play to my strength. Then there are more chances of getting wickets,\" said Bhuvi after India's victory at Edgbaston. \"But it's important to keep it in control because when the ball moves, you feel like bowling 'one in, one out, one in, one out'. You have to control that urge and bowl consistently in one line and work on setting batters up,\" the Uttar Pradesh pacer added. Bhuvi, who is not a part of the ongoing third T20I between India and England, picked up four wickets in two T20Is. However, he is not in India's squad for their upcoming three-match ODI series against England. He recently went past Jasprit Bumrah in the list of most wickets among Indian pacers in the T20Is. Bumrah now has 70 T20I wickets, one more than Bumrah. Bhuvi is also India's second-leading wicket-taker for India in the shortest format, with spinner Yuzvendra Chahal at the top. The year 2021 was a tough one for Bhuvi who was at crossroads in his career, due to the combination of regular injuries and bad form. As a result, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) released him from their squad ahead of the IPL 2022. Even though they re-signed him at the mega auction, he would have taken a big pay cut. However, Bhuvi proved his worth by being consistent throughout the season. The starts Bhuvneshwar Kumar provides is gold for INDIA! 👏 #BhuvneshwarKumar #ENGvIND #IND pic.twitter.com/lOlvQKv9nx Bhuvneshwar Kumar: After the injury, I knew I had to come back and do well The current form of the Meerut-born bowler is crucial for India's chances in the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to take place later this year in Australia. Bhuvi believes that he always wanted to comeback to the Indian team and never thought that his career was over. \"I never thought that was that for me. But yes, I was working with the trainers, and physios and doing my thing. Of course, when you are out of the game, you are never confident. After the injury, I knew I had to come back and do well. There were no options. I felt I would get matches, and I wanted to give my 100% in them. But there's no guarantee you'd do well. When you have had injuries, you have... not doubt, but you are left frustrated and disappointed. \"You're not in the best mental state. You keep thinking about wanting to do well on a comeback. Luckily I got a chance again, I did well. Of course, I was backed by the captain and coach. And it feels good to come good on that backing. Luckily I came back and am playing for India again,\" the 32-year-old pacer added.","pubDate":"2022-07-10 16:17:51","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/07/10/500x300_1302163-bhuvneshwar-kumar.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Vaughan on Kohli's poor run: You cannot select a player for his past performances","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/vaughan-on-kohlis-poor-run-you-cannot-select-a-player-for-his-past-performances-752778","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli has not scored a century since 2019India and England are currently playing a limited-overs seriesIndia have won the first two games of the three-match T20I series","content":"Former England captain Michael Vaughan has said India are not considering dropping struggling Virat Kohli but \"you shouldn't be selecting a player for his past performances.\" Kohli has not scored an international century since 2019. Even though the rise of the likes of Deepak Hooda and Suryakumar Yadav has threatened Kohli's place in the T20I side, his inclusion is never in doubt. Carrying his forgettable streak into the second T20I against England, Kohli scored just one run off three balls at Edgbaston, Birmingham. \"He (Virat) needs to score runs at a good strike rate. I am sure Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma are not considering dropping him. But you can't just keep picking a player because of what he has done in the past,\" Vaughan said in an interview with Cricbuzz. Vaughan also backed India's decision to rest Kohli from India's upcoming tour of West Indies, saying the former Indian skipper needs a break from the game. \"I have been saying he needs a break as it will do him a world of good. So missing the five T20Is against West Indies will be best thing to happen to him. But if there was ever a ground where you could get a quick score with great strike rate, Trent Bridge is the ground to get your form back,\" added Vaughan. The third T20I between India and England is currently underway in Nottingham. England won the toss and are batting first. Rohit and Co have already sealed the series by bagging an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-game T20I series. Meanwhile, Vaughan has also advised Kohli to take a sabbatical and take a beach vacation. \"I look at Virat in particular. I knew he had a little bit of a rest at the end of the IPL. But he just looks to me like he needs a sabbatical. He looks like he needs three months away from cricket. Go and sit on a beach.\" \"Go and do what you can with your family because a career of 20 years, which he probably will end up getting because he's such a good player. To have a three months break, is it going to affect him? No. Will it help him? Yes,\" added Vaughan. Vaughan also expressed his displeasure with the schedule for the upcoming ODI and T20I series between India and England. The two teams are scheduled to play three T20Is followed by as many ODIs. \"I just look at the schedule for India and England. It's ridiculous. We'll see more and more of this over the next few years. It's just impossible that all-format players will be able to play all three formats. The management of all these teams are going to have to be very clever in terms of giving them a breather,\" Vaughan said further.","pubDate":"2022-07-10 16:09:15","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/07/10/500x300_1302160-michael-vaughan.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG: Rishabh Pant ने बिना बैटिंग के पूरा किया अर्धशतक, जानें कैसे हासिल की खास उपलब्धि","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/england-vs-india-rishabh-pant-playing-his-50th-t20i-match-trent-bridge-nottingham-2165158","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rishabh Pant England vs India, 3rd T20I Nottingham:</strong> टीम इंडिया के विकेटकीपर बैट्समैन ऋषभ पंत ने नॉटिंघम में एक खास रिकॉर्ड अपने नाम कर लिया. उन्होंने भारत के लिए 50 टी20 इंटरनेशनल मैच खेलने की उपलब्धि अपने नाम कर ली. टीम इंडिया और इंग्लैंड के बीच टी20 सीरीज का तीसरा और आखिरी मैच खेला जा रहा है. हालांकि यह मैच पंत के लिए ठीक साबित नहीं हुआ. वे महज एक रन बनाकर आउट हो गए.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ऋषभ पंत भारत के लिए 50 या इससे ज्यादा टी20 इंटरनेशनल मैच खेलने वाले 14वें खिलाड़ी बन गए हैं. उन्होंने इस दौरान 768 रन बनाए हैं. पंत का टी20 इंटरनेशनल मैचों में सर्वश्रेष्ठ स्कोर नाबाद 65 रन रहा है. उन्होंने इस फॉर्मेट में 3 अर्धशतक लगाए हैं. हालांकि वे इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ खेली गई टी20 सीरीज में कुछ खास नहीं कर पाए. उन्होंने दूसरे मैच में 26 रन बनाए थे. जबकि तीसरे मुकाबले में सिर्फ एक ही रन बना पाए.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">गौरतलब है कि टीम इंडिया के लिए सबसे ज्यादा टी20 इंटरनेशनल मैच खेलने का रिकॉर्ड रोहित शर्मा के नाम दर्ज है. उन्होंने 128 मैच खेले हैं. जबकि विराट कोहली 99वां मैच खेल रहे हैं. इस मामले में महेंद्र सिंह धोनी तीसरे स्थान पर हैं. धोनी ने 98 मैच खेले थे. सुरेश रैना 78 मैचों के साथ चौथे स्थान पर हैं.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A special HALF-CENTURY! 👍<br /><br />Congratulations to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RishabhPant17?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RishabhPant17</a> as he plays his 5⃣0⃣th T20I. 👏👏<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamIndia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TeamIndia</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ENGvIND?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ENGvIND</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gMoRSZnog9\">pic.twitter.com/gMoRSZnog9</a></p> &mdash; BCCI (@BCCI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BCCI/status/1546131224200183809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2022</a></blockquote> <p> <script src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>यह भी पढ़ें : <a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-avesh-khan-out-jos-buttler-trent-bridge-nottingham-3rd-t20-2165114\">IND vs ENG: Avesh Khan ने जोस बटलर को बनाया शिकार, देखें किस तरह से किया बोल्ड</a></strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/can-you-ask-geoff-lemmon-to-sit-in-the-yellow-color-david-warner-told-the-broadcaster-at-the-stump-mic-during-the-galle-test-between-australia-and-sri-lanka-the-batsman-is-disappointed-please-2165013\"><strong>Watch Video: डेविड वार्नर ने स्टंप माइक से ब्रॉडकास्टर को दिया यह मैसेज, हंसी नहीं रोक पाए कमेंटेटर</strong></a></p>","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-10 16:00:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Dawid Malan T20 ranking: Dawid Malan ICC Ranking in T20Is","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dawid-malan-t20-ranking-dawid-malan-icc-ranking-in-t20is/","keywords":["Cricket","Dawid Malan","India tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dawid Malan T20 ranking: The England Southpaw batter smashed his 12th T20I half-century during the third T20I versus India at Nottingham.

With England struggling to get on with their run rate after having posted 86/3 on the scoreboard after the end of 10 Overs, Malan took the mantle upon himself to smash the inexperienced pacers in particular for a total of 6 Fours and 5 Sixes at an impressive strike rate of 197.44.

As of today, the 34-year-old is currently ranked 4th in the ICC Men’s T20I ranking for batters, with 728 points under his belt. Pakistan skipper Babar Azam (818) and his opening partner in T20Is wicket-keeper batter Mohammed Rizwan (794) are currently placed at the first and second spot respectively, with South Africa’s Aiden Markram (757) taking the third spot. It is worth of a mention that Malan had, in December 2020 attained the highest-ever rating points for batters (men) in the ICC T20I rankings with 915 rating points. He had in fact, become the first men’s batter to cross the 900-point mark after Australian Aaron Finch’s 900-point achievement in July 2018. As far as the ongoing third T20I is concerned, Malan’s 43-ball 84-run partnership alongside Liam Livingstone (42* off 29) for the 4th wicket was instrumental in England posting a humongous total of 215/7 in their 20 Overs.","pubDate":"2022-07-10 15:22:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG 3rd T20: इंग्लैंड ने भारत को दिया 216 रनों का लक्ष्य, मलान का दमदार अर्धशतक","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/eng-vs-ind-3rd-t20i-england-score-215-runs-dawid-malan-half-century-ravi-bishnoi-trent-bridge-nottingham-2165151","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>England vs India 3rd T20I Nottingham:</strong> टीम इंडिया और इंग्लैंड के बीच टी20 सीरीज का तीसरा और आखिरी मैच नॉटिंघम में खेला जा रहा है. इसमें इंग्लैंड ने पहले बैटिंग करते हुए भारत को 216 रनों का लक्ष्य दिया है. इस दौरान डेविड मलान ने तूफानी प्रदर्शन किया. उन्होंने 39 गेंदों में 77 रन बनाए. जबकि लियाम लिविंगस्टोन ने भी अच्छी पारी खेली. भारत के लिए रवि बिश्नोई ने दो विकेट झटके.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">इंग्लैंड ने टॉस जीतकर पहले बैटिंग करते हुए 20 ओवरों में 215 रन बनाए. इस दौरान टीम के लिए जेसन रॉय और जोस बटलर ओपनिंग करने आए. बटलर 9 गेंदों में 18 रन बनाकर आउट हुए. उन्होंने दो चौके और एक छक्का लगाया. जबकि रॉय 26 गेंदों में 27 रन बनाकर आउट हुए. उन्होंने दो छक्के और एक चौका लगाया. फिलिप साल्ट महज 8 रन बनाकर आउट हुए. उन्होंने 6 गेंदों में एक चौका लगाया.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">मलान ने दमदार पारी खेली. उन्होंने 39 गेंदों का सामना करते हुए 77 रन बनाए. मलान की इस पारी में 6 चौके और 5 छक्के शामिल रहे. मोईन अली पहली ही गेंद पर आउट हो गए. वे खाता तक नहीं खोल सके. हैरी ब्रूक ने 9 गेंदों में 3 चौकों की मदद से 19 रन बनाए. अंत में लियाम लिविंगस्टोन ने 29 गेंदों में 4 छक्कों की मदद से नाबाद 42 रन बनाए. क्रिस जॉर्डन 11 रन बनाकर रन आउट हुए.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">भारत के लिए रवि बिश्नोई ने खतरनाक गेंदबाजी की. उन्होंने 4 ओवरों में 30 रन देकर 2 विकेट लिए. आवेश खान को भी एक सफलता हाथ लगी. उन्होंने 4 ओवरों में 43 रन दिए. रविंद्र जडेजा ने 4 ओवरों में 45 रन दिए. हालांकि उन्हें एक भी विकेट नहीं मिला. हर्षल पटेल ने भी अच्छी गेंदबाजी की. उन्होंने 4 ओवरों में 35 रन देकर 2 विकेट लिए. उमरान मलिक काफी महंगे साबित हुए. उन्होंने 4 ओवरों में 56 रन देकर एक विकेट लिया.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>यह भी पढ़ें : <a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-avesh-khan-out-jos-buttler-trent-bridge-nottingham-3rd-t20-2165114\">IND vs ENG: Avesh Khan ने जोस बटलर को बनाया शिकार, देखें किस तरह से किया बोल्ड</a></strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-2nd-t20-virat-kohli-dance-in-stadium-india-vs-england-edgbaston-birmingham-2165015\"><strong>IND vs ENG 2nd T20: बल्ले से फेल विराट कोहली ने फील्डिंग के दौरान किया डांस, देखें वीडियो</strong></a></p>","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-10 15:14:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Centre asks BCCI to organise India vs Rest of World XI cricket match to mark 75 years of Independence","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/centre-asks-bcci-to-organise-india-vs-rest-of-world-xi-cricket-match-to-mark-75-years-of-independence/videoshow/92787618.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-10 15:10:01","image_url":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-1200,imgsize-42000,resizemode-4,msid-92787618/centre-asks-bcci-to-organise-india-vs-rest-of-world-xi-cricket-match-to-mark-75-years-of-independence.jpg","source_id":"economictimes_indiatimes","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dhoni in England: MS Dhoni and Ravi Shastri spotted watching 3rd IND vs ENG T20 at Trent Bridge","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dhoni-in-england-ms-dhoni-and-ravi-shastri-spotted-watching-3rd-ind-vs-eng-t20-at-trent-bridge/","keywords":["Cricket","ENG vs IND","MS Dhoni","Ravi Shastri"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dhoni in England: MS Dhoni and Ravi Shastri were spotted in the stadium watching the England vs India 3rd T20I match.

Check out the third T20I preview here India players leave the field after beating England during the second T20 international cricket match between England and India at Edgbaston in Birmingham, England, Saturday, July 9, 2022. (AP Photo/Rui Vieira) Preview: Rohit Sharma-led Team India take on Jos Buttler’s England in the third and final T20I at Nottingham’s Trent Bridge on Sunday. This will be the second consecutive game the two teams face off in, after having been scheduled to play the second T20I at Edgbaston on Saturday. The Men in Blue registered a formidable 50-run win over the hosts in the first T20I in Southampton on Thursday. Hardik Pandya was the star of the day for India on Thursday, notching up his maiden T20I fifty while also scalping four wickets. India had won the toss in the series-opener and opted to bat. Apart from Hardik, Deepak Hooda (33) and Suryakumar Yadav (39) contributed quickfire knocks to take India to 198/8 from 20 overs. In reply, Hardik took four, while debutant Arshdeep Singh too scalped a couple of wickets to see off England for 148. Focus will be on England’s batters, including Jos Buttler, with the skipper having been dismissed for a golden duck off Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s ball in the first T20I. As far as India are concerned, the likes of Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant return for the second and third T20Is, after having played the fifth Test that India lost last week. For India, all eyes will be on that man, Kohli, who has not scored an international century since November 2019.

Bangladesh will look to have some consolation by performing well in the ODI series before ending the tour. Captain Tamim Iqbal had acknowledged that his side are comfortable in the ODI format. With T20 World Cup looming around the corner, ODIs might not be of much relevance. But, with the ODI championship points at stake with every series, the games cannot be taken lightly. Bangladesh have managed to win five out of their last six ODI series. West Indies on the other hand had their last win against Netherlands. The stats and the history of recent times are in favour of the Bangladesh tigers as the Men in Maroon last defeated them in an ODI series in 2014. Bangladesh will miss one of their best players in Shakib Al Hasan. Whereas West Indies will play with their frontline team. However, rain is expected to play a spoil sport throughout the match.

On off, Roy slaps it towards cover and gets to the other end. 4.5 overs (0 Run) Angled into middle, defended. 4.4 overs (0 Run) Slightly shorter, this one turns away a little. It is slapped to covers. 4.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Over mid on! Goes with the angle! Fuller and on middle, Roy lifts it over mid on for another boundary. That biggie has really got Roy going here. 4.2 overs (0 Run) Flatter and on middle, defended. 4.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! That has been smacked! Welcome into the attack, Jadeja! On middle, flatter. Jadeja makes room and slams it down the ground and over the long off fence. 3.6 overs (0 Run) End of a very good over by Avesh Khan! The last ball stayed down a touch! Outside off, length. Malan looks to push at it but this does not bounce alot and he is beaten. 3.6 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Way too short and on the body, Malan leaves it alone. Will the extra delivery cost him? 3.5 overs (0 Run) Quite an aggressive shot first up! Shorter and angling away from off. Malan looks to pull but gets an inside edge onto the pads. Dawid Malan walks out to bat! 3.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! TIMBER! Buttler falls to yet another low score and Avesh Khan gets the much-needed wicket for his side. Buttler was looking good so India will be very happy to see him walk back. Poor shot to be honest! This is short and just outside off, not enough room. Buttler looks to cut with no foot movement, it goes off the inside edge and onto the stumps. 3.3 overs (0 Run) Angled into middle, this is worked to mid-wicket. 3.2 overs (1 Run) Pant could have done better there! Roy steps out and this is shorter and on the body, Roy looks to pull but it hits his body, goes to the right of Pant who is moving to his left. He dives over the ball. A single taken towards third man. 3.1 overs (3 Runs) Safe! Fuller and on off, Buttler clears his front leg and lofts it down the ground, not timed that well but hits it well enough to clear mid off. Sharma runs after it and keeps it down to three. Change! Avesh Khan is back! 2.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! That is massive! Wow! This should probably get Roy going. The last ball spoils the over and it is yet another good one for England. On middle, Roy gets the slog sweep out and it sails over the mid-wicket fence. 2.5 overs (1 Run) Angled into the pads, Buttler works it through mid-wicket for one. 2.4 overs (1 Run) Well fielded! Shorter and outside off, Roy cuts but the fielder at point dives to his right and stops it. 2.3 overs (0 Run) Misses out again! He will be disappointed he did not put that away! On the pads, he sweeps but to short fine leg. 2.2 overs (0 Run) Fuller and on middle, Roy mistimes it to mid off. Roy just has not found his timing in this series so far. 2.1 overs (0 Run) Quicker and outside off, this one zips through. Roy is beaten as he tries to cut. 1.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Caressed! 18 from Umran Malik's first! This is finesse. We saw power a few balls ago and now he just uses the pace. Fuller and on off, Buttler times it through covers. No chance for any fielder. England off to a flier. 1.6 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Looks to go full, probably a yorker but ends up slipping it down the leg side. Buttler looks to flick but misses. 1.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! What a shot that is! Wow! Dismissed! This is short and Buttler picks the length early, he rocks back and powers it over the mid-wicket fence for the first biggie of the day. So the first biggie and first boundary of the game comes in the same over. 1.4 overs (1 Run) Angled in on middle, Roy works it through mid-wicket and takes one. 1.3 overs (1 Run) Good pace again! Short and on the body, Buttler looks to pull but misses, it hits his body and rolls on the off side. A leg bye taken. 1.2 overs (0 Run) BEATEN! That is a real effort ball! Shorter and outside off, this one zips through. Buttler is beaten as he looks to push at it. He tried to play a similar shot he did on the last ball but was beaten for pace. 1.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! That is a top shot! Welcome into the attack! Shorter and outside off, Buttler stands tall, gets on top of the bounce and creams it through point for a boundary. First of the game and Buttler is off the mark in style. Who will bowl from the other end then? It is Umran Malik. 0.6 over (0 Run) That is a very good first over by Avesh! Length and on off, this is guided to point. Just the two from it. 0.5 over (0 Run) This one zips through! Roy steps out but Avesh bowls it shorter and outside off. Roy looks to cut but misses. 0.4 over (2 Runs) Roy is off the mark! He avoids a pair. Shorter and on off, once again it comes slow off the surface, this is pulled through mid-wicket for a couple. The outfield seemed very fast there. 0.3 over (0 Run) That lands just short! Angled into the pads, Roy looks to flick, it seemed like it held on the surface. It goes uppishly but lands short of the mid-wicket fielder. Three dots in a row. 0.2 over (0 Run) Back of a length and on off, Roy guides it to the man at point. 0.1 over (0 Run) A good start from him! On a length and around off, Roy takes a few steps down the track and defends. We are all set for the action to begin! The two openers for England, Jason Roy and Jos Buttler, walk out to the middle. Avesh Khan has the new ball in hand. Here we go... Rohit Sharma, skipper of India says they wanted to chase as they have batted first initially and now they want to see how they can chase. Informs they have 4 changes. Adds they want to continue to win games but they also want to give chances to the others. Says Umran Malik is an exciting prospect and they want to give him that confidence. England skipper, Jos Buttler says it looks a great wicket and he hopes they can make use of it. Informs they have two chances, Salt and Topley comes in, adds he is going to bat at number 4. Mentions it looks like a brilliant surface and they want to make use of it, the side is still full of confidence and he hopes they can do well. here. India (Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Rishabh Pant (WK), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer In for Hardik Pandya), Dinesh Karthik, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshal Patel, Ravi Bishnoi (In for Yuzvendra Chahal), Umran Malik(In for Bhuvneshwar Kumar) and Avesh Khan (In for Jasprit Bumrah). England (Playing XI) - Jason Roy, Jos Buttler (C/WK), Dawid Malan, Philip Salt (In for Sam Curran), Liam Livingstone, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, David Willey, Chris Jordan, Richard Gleeson and Reece Topley (In for Matt Parkinson). TOSS - Up goes the flip of the coin and it lands in England's favour. They have elected to BAT first. For England, it is their batting which has been disappointing so far! Quite shocking to be honest, especially the form their players have come into in this game. The series is gone but they would still want to head into the ODI series with a win. They'll have to play really well if they are to do so.

Since the start of 2021, India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has won three Player of the Match awards in the shortest format. Batter Suryakumar Yadav is the only other Indian cricketer to have won three T20I match awards in this period. Kumar, who has been playing T20Is for almost a decade now, had won a lone such award since his debut in 2012 till the end of 2020. Having regained his position in the Indian T20I squad after suffering multiple injuries and undergoing a bad patch across formats, Kumar’s stellar comeback should aid him in boarding the plane to Australia for ICC World Twenty20 2022 later this year. If Kumar manages to extend his streak of picking early wickets with the new ball, expect him to open the bowling during the world event for picking wickets in the powerplay is a niche and uncommon skill which comes in very handy in T20Is. “When the ball swings, you enjoy bowling. But if I am not wrong it has not swung much in England in the past few years. If the ball swings it motivates you to do well and I am confident right now,” Kumar had told Sky Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony of the second T20I against England in Birmingham yesterday. Bowling figures of 6-1-25-4 across two outings in this series doesn’t make Kumar the highest wicket-taker but no one else has made an impact like him. While the right-arm bowler had dismissed England captain Jos Buttler for a golden duck in the first T20I in Southampton, he managed to dismiss opening batter Jason Roy on the first ball of the innings on Saturday. I am probably going overboard with these Bhuvneshwar Kumar tweets of late but numbers will tell you that the world has never seen a greater Powerplay bowler in T20 cricket and no one talks about that. — Abhishek Mukherjee (@ovshake42) July 9, 2022 Readers must note that Kumar is the highest wicket-taker in powerplay in both T20Is and T20s.","pubDate":"2022-07-10 12:58:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ishan Kishan GF: Is Ishan Kishan married?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ishan-kishan-gf-is-ishan-kishan-married/","keywords":["Cricket","Aditi Hundia","ishan kishan","Ishan Kishan gf"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ishan Kishan GF: The talented Indian wicket-keeper has seen a terrific rise in his career in the last few years.

AFP Australian batting star David Warner was at his hilarious best on Saturday during his team’s second Test against Sri Lanka at Galle. Towards the end of play on Day two, Warner was quick to use the stump mic in order to send a message to journalist Geoff Lemon. Sri Lanka were batting at the time, with Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews the two batters. The incident took place when the duo complained to the umpire about being disturbed during the game, courtesy of people moving around in the press box, just above the sightscreen. The person in particular, who was roaming around in a yellow shirt was Australian journalist Geoff Lemon. Actually, David, it’s more of a beige and cinnamon pic.twitter.com/XXqkQFurKl — Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) July 9, 2022 With Mathews reporting the incident, Warner was quick to take matters into his own hands, using the stump mic to convey a message. “Broadcast, can you tell Geoff Lemon to sit down, in the yellow. Batsman is frustrated, please,” Warner could be heard over the stump mic, the video of which has since gone viral. Geoff Lemon, too took it in good stead, replying to Warner in a tweet, where he said: “Actually, David, it’s more of a beige and cinnamon.” Having won the opening Test, Australia are aiming for a series sweep in Galle. After Australia posted 364 in the first innings of the second Test, Sri Lanka have responded in a fighting fashion, taking a lead which is nearing fifty, with Dinesh Chandimal having scored a century.

AP Photo A funny conversation between Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant went viral during the second T20I between India and England on Saturday. To the surprise of everyone, Rishabh Pant opened the innings with Rohit Sharma after India opted to bat first. It was the first time Pant opened an innings for India. The duo had a hilarious conversation after taking a run which was caught on the stump mic and caught eyeballs on social media. Pant defended an out-swinger from Dawid Willey in the first over and took off for a quick single. But Willey was about to hit Pant, while they were running. Hence, Rohit asked Pant why he was running differently. And this is how the conversation went – Pant: Ye saamne aa gaya yaar (He came in my way while running). Takkar mar du kyaa? (Should I push him the next time?) Rohit: Maar de, aur kyaa! (Push him, what else can be done.)

Pant, opening for the first time, scored 26 — at a strike rate of 173.33 — in just 15 deliveries. With Saturday's win, India also took an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the three-match series. If the side is able to win the third match on Sunday as well, it will be the sixth consecutive T20I whitewash under Rohit’s leadership. The final T20I starts at 7 pm IST on Sunday. Rohit Sharma had hinted at some changes in the playing XI at the post-match presentations. It will be interesting to see how India tinkers with the combination.
