During the 53rd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the MCA Stadium in Pune, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), continuing with their scintillating performances in the marquee league so far, have decimated the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 75 runs. With the win tonight, the KL Rahul-led side have not only won four matches on the trot, but have now topped the points table with a total of 8 wins from 11 matches. The KKR, on the other hand, are all but out of the race for the playoffs , having lost their 7th match out of eleven they have played so far. En route the target of 177 handed by LSG, KKR were on the back foot right from the first Over itself, as the LSG pacer Mohsin Khan began their chase with a wicket-maiden, getting rid of Baba Indrajith (0 off 6). They even registered their lowest Powerplay score of the season ‚Äì 25/3, and further slipped to 30/4 after the end of eight Overs. Some fireworks from Andre Russell (45 off 19) did bring the crowd up on their feet as long as it lasted, but post his departure during the 13th Over, the rest of the line-up fell like ninepins to bundle up for 101 runs in mere 14.3 Overs. Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, took to his social media handle to praise and congratulate LSG upon reaching the top of the points table in what has been a dream run for them so far in their maiden IPL season. The 41-year-old also commended the fantastic performances from the LSG pace-bowling quartet of Mohsin Khan (3-1-6-1), Dushmantha Chameera (3-0-14-0), Avesh Khan (3-1-19-3), and Jason Holder (2.3-0-31-3), who collectively turned up for their side with match-winning contributions. üîùof the table @LucknowIPL üî• Well deserved!

However, Quinton de Kock (50 off 29) and Deepak Hooda (41 off 27) continued with their aggressive batting approach, to take their side to 110/3 after 13 Overs. Just when the KKR bowlers had managed to keep a check on the run-rate, Shivam Mavi (4-0-50-1) conceded 30 runs off the 19th Over, as LSG posted a healthy score of 176/7 in their 20 Overs on what was a slow wicket to bat on.","pubDate":"2022-05-07 18:34:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Bowlers guide Lucknow Super Giants to 75-run win over Kolkata Knight Riders","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/photos/ipl-2022-bowlers-guide-lucknow-super-giants-to-75-run-win-over-kolkata-knight-riders-10645411.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Bowlers guide Lucknow Super Giants to 75-run win over Kolkata Knight Riders","content":"Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022 , and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

Andre Russell did an Andre Russell with the willow. Still, its poor record in the PowerPlay continued to haunt Kolkata Knight Riders as it faced a crushing defeat against Lucknow Super Giants on Saturday night. The 75-run victory at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium meant the Super Giants was catapulted to the top of the table while the Knight Riders suffered a near-fatal blow to their Indian Premier League campaign. Entering the game with the worst batting PowerPlay record, KKR would have hoped for its top-three to at least survive the first six overs in quest of a target of 177. But the batters wilted against the onslaught of the Super Giants‚Äô pace quartet. Mohsin Khan, Dushmantha Chameera and Jason Holder were too hot to handle up front. Left-armer Mohsin started off with a wicket-maiden to set the tone. Chameera then rattled Shreyas Iyer with the short-ball ploy and Holder repeated the same tactic to see the back of Aaron Finch to leave KKR reeling at 25 for three at the end of the PowerPlay. When Avesh Khan, the fourth pacer, forced Nitish Rana to play on to the stumps in the next over, the fate of the game was all but sealed. Then came the Russell assault, which gave 17,000-strong crowd a glimmer of hope. As it happened But his five sixes - including three in a Holder over - were far from enough to get KKR even close to the target. When a diving Holder caught a top-edge off Russell‚Äôs blade running in from deep fine-leg off Avesh in the 13th over, the remaining proceedings were a mere formality. Besides the batting PowerPlay, even the bowling PowerPlay turned out to be detrimental to KKR. When captain K.L. Rahul was run out without facing a ball in the opening over courtesy a direct hit by Shreyas Iyer, KKR, without the in-form Umesh Yadav, would have fancied its chances. READ | IPL 2022: Jaiswal, Chahal star in Rajasthan Royals' six-wicket win over Punjab Kings But Quinton de Kock - who was guilty of sending Rahul back after calling for a quick single - didn‚Äôt let the setback affect him. Everything that was pitched short to him was dispatched either through or over the arc between square-leg and mid-wicket. Deepak Hooda, meanwhile, was scintillating with his cover drives. Despite scoring just two runs in the opening over, Super Giants had raced to 66 for one at the end of the PowerPlay. The Knight Riders then pulled things back, conceding just 76 runs in the next 12 overs. But Marcus Stoinis and Jason Holder tonked five sixes in Shivam Mavi‚Äôs penultimate over to tilt the balance in Super Giants‚Äô favour.","pubDate":"2022-05-07 18:01:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Avesh Khan, Jason Holder Star As Lucknow Super Giants Thrash Floundering Kolkata Knight Ri.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2luZGlhbi1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS0yMDIyLWF2ZXNoLWtoYW4tamFzb24taG9sZGVyLXN0YXItYXMtbHNnLXRocmFzaC1mbG91bmRlcmluZy1ra3ItMjk1NTUzONIBhAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9pbmRpYW4tcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtMjAyMi1hdmVzaC1raGFuLWphc29uLWhvbGRlci1zdGFyLWFzLWxzZy10aHJhc2gtZmxvdW5kZXJpbmcta2tyLTI5NTU1MzgvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Avesh Khan, Jason Holder Star As Lucknow Super Giants Thrash Floundering Kolkata Knight Ri..¬†¬†NDTV SportsLSG vs KKR, IPL 2022 stats: Head-to-Head record, players to watch out for¬†¬†SportstarLSG vs KKR Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorIPL 2022 LIVE: LSG vs KKR LIVE | Preview LIVE | Shreyas Iyer | KL Rahul | Andre Russell¬†¬†NEWS9 liveLive Cricket Score - LSG v KKR, Match 53, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-07 17:59:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LSG vs KKR Man of the Match today IPL: Who was awarded Man of the Match in Lucknow vs Kolkata 2022 IPL match?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-lsg-vs-kkr-man-of-the-match-today-ipl-who-was-awarded-man-of-the-match-in-lucknow-vs-kolkata-2022-ipl-match/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","KKR","Lucknow Super Giants","Indian Premier League","IPL","Kolkata Knight riders","LSG"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"LSG vs KKR Man of the Match today IPL: The LSG fast bowlers were breathing fire during the LSG versus KKR IPL 2022 match.

During the 53rd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the MCA Stadium in Pune, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have obliterated the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 75 runs to register their fourth consecutive and overall their eighth win in their debut season to go right at the top of the points table. Defending a good enough total of 176/7 posted after being invited to bat first on a relatively slow wicket, LSG were bang on target with the ball right away, as KKR registered their lowest score in the Powerplay ‚Äì 25 with the loss of three wickets. However, with the scorecard reading 30/4 after 8 Overs, the West Indies destructive all-rounder Andre Russell (45 off 19) did bring with himself some glimmer of hope till he lasted on the 22-yard-deck, as he smashed 3 Fours and 5 gigantic Sixes while striking at 236.84. With him getting dismissed off a short delivery by Avesh Khan during the 13 th Over, it was all over for the KKR, as the entire line-up fell like ninepins within minutes to get bowled out for 101 in mere 14.3 Overs. It were the four LSG pacers, who turned up for their side, with some fantastic display of bowling, particularly with the shorter lengths, which got rid of as many as five KKR batters. While Jason Holder (2.3-0-31-3) and Avesh Khan (3-1-19-3) were amongst the wicket-takers, Mohsin Khan (3-1-6-1) and Dushmantha Chameera (3-0-14-0) restricted the run-flow with good effect. Having gotten rid of the in-form Nitish Rana (2 off 11) post his scratchy stay at the crease and most importantly getting the wicket of the ever dangerous Andre Russell, who was yet again looking in some destructive mood tonight, Avesh Khan was adjudged the ‚ÄòPlayer of the Match‚Äô for returing with excellent bowling figures of 3-1-19-3. 3Ô∏è‚É£-1Ô∏è‚É£-1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£-3Ô∏è‚É£: An #Epic spell that guided @LucknowIPL to a jordaar win!

Andreüëè pic.twitter.com/x06lcqLHFe ‚Äî KolkataKnightRiders (@KKRiders) May 7, 2022 Playing this match ahead of all-rounder Krishnappa Gowtham, pacer Avesh Khan was the pick of the bowlers for Super Giants with his figures of 3-1-19-3. While all-rounder Jason Holder also picked three wickets, the likes of Mohsin Khan, Dushmantha Chameera and Ravi Bishnoi picked a wicket apiece at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. Asked to bat first by opposition captain Shreyas Iyer (6), Lucknow put on board a competitive 176/7 in 20 overs on the back of healthy contributions from wicket-keeper batter Quinton de Kock (50) and batter Deepak Hooda (41). In what is their sixth loss in the last seventh match this season, Kolkata‚Äôs position on the points table has further weakened after losing a total of seven out of their 11 IPL 2022 matches. This loss, in particular, has significantly affected their chances of qualifying for the playoffs. Even if Knight Riders win their remaining three matches, they will only reach to seven wins, i.e., 14 points. A negative NRR (Net Run Rate) of -0.304 makes it all but impossible for KKR to play the next round form this point. Assuming that something magical happens, KKR‚Äôs NRR will still come into play as more teams are likely to finish with 14 points this season. Another loss in the league stage will official knock out Kolkata from IPL 2022 qualification.","pubDate":"2022-05-07 17:37:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tata IPL 2022 LSG vs KKR HIGHLIGHTS: LSG beat KKR by 75 runs","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/lsg-vs-kkr-live-cricket-score-tata-ipl-2022-match-scorecard-live-update-lucknow-super-giants-vs-kolkata-knight-riders-indian-premier-league-live-streaming-today-10642001.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tata IPL 2022 LSG vs KKR HIGHLIGHTS: LSG beat KKR by 75 runs","content":"23:02 (IST)That's it from our end for this match.

Over after over, game after game, and week after week, Arshdeep has done his job with utter perfection. You may not hear a lot about him. He is not as fast as Umran Malik or part of team like Prasidh Krishna, who are continuously putting in great performances. Consider this, In Saturday's game, Rajasthan Royals needed 11 runs off 12 deliveries. With Heymyer and Padikkal at the crease, the game had no business going till the last over. Arshdeep Singh came in to bowl the most important over of the game, nailed 4 perfect yorkers, sent Padikkal back, and gave away just three runs. He made a match out of something that wasn't even there. If Punjab had won the game, Singh's penultimate over would have been all over our channels and social media. But since RR won the match, no one is talking about it. Take the game against Chennai Super Kings for example. If it wasn't for Arshdeep Singh's brilliant 17th over, Punjab Kings, in all probability, would have lost the match. Chasing 188, CSK's was hitting the ball brilliantly. In short, he was putting on an exhibition. Sandeep Sharma came to bowl the 16th over, and Rayudu hit him for 23 runs. With four overs left in the game, CSK needing just 46 to win, and Rayudu still at the crease, no one would have given Punjab a chance. But there he was again. In a match where every bowler was being smacked by Rayudu, Arshdeep came in, bowled a brilliant over, gave away just six runs against a red-hot Rayudu, and took the steam out of CSK's chase. No one really talked about that over, but it was the one that changed the game, and gave Punjab the upper hand. He bowls at the start, during the middle overs and at the death. Arshdeep Singh is here to stay, and is the next big thing in Indian cricket.","pubDate":"2022-05-07 16:02:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jos√© Enrique outraged by what's now happened to two Liverpool players","link":"https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/05/07/jose-enrique-outraged-by-whats-now-happened-to-two-liverpool-players/","keywords":["Competitions","Football","Liverpool","Premier League","Teams","andy robertson","anfield","fabinho","Jose Enrique","Jurgen Klopp","premier league","reds"],"creator":["Billy Meyers"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jos√© Enrique has taken to Twitter to react after Liverpool duo Andy Robertson and Fabinho were left out of the FIFA 22 Team of the...

Two-wicket haul by Murugan Ashwin and top knocks from Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, and Tim David helped Mumbai Indians score a 5-run win over Gujarat Titans at the Brabourne Stadium here on Friday. The collective bowling effort from Mumbai Indians put the strong batting efforts of Shubman Gill and Wriddhiman Saha to vain as Gujarat could not capitalize on their opening partnership in the tight contest that was settled in the last over. ‚ÄúIt was pretty tight towards the back end. Very satisfying, something we were looking for all this while. Luck has to turn at some stage, we‚Äôll take that win with both hands. Credit to everyone. We were 15-20 runs short. The way we started, we got stuck in the middle. They bowled well in that situation,‚Äù said Rohit Sharma in a post-match presentation. Following the win, Rohit Sharma lauded Tim David who smashed a stunning 44* off 21 balls to help Mumbai post 177 for six. ‚ÄúTim David finished things really well. We knew it would be tough, but we held our nerves and that was good to see. A lot depends on how the game is going, who‚Äôs bowling well on the day. Luckily I had few resources so I could change-up. They bowled slower balls and it was difficult to hit. We wanted to do the same. We did that pretty well, it was a great effort from the bowling unit,‚Äù said Sharma. Rohit also praised Daniel Sams, who conceded only three runs in the final nail-biting over. With the Titans needing six runs off the last two balls, Sams bowled two slower deliveries and fooled Miller, so that the batter couldn‚Äôt hit any shot. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to look too far ahead. Even today, we didn‚Äôt play our best cricket, a lot of credit to the bowlers at the back-end. It‚Äôs important to back the skills you have. Sams was under the pump in a couple of games but I know the quality he has. It‚Äôs important to back those guys. We are trying to maintain the same squad how much ever possible. Daniel Sams was brilliant,‚Äù he added. Gujarat have played 10 matches so far, winning eight and losing two. On the other hand, MI are currently 10th on the table and have no chance to make the playoffs.","pubDate":"2022-05-07 15:30:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, LSG vs KKR LIVE Updates: Quinton De Kock Falls After Quickfire Fifty, Lucknow Super Giants 2 Down vs Kolkata Knight Riders - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9saXZlLWlwbC1zY29yZS1sc2ctdnMta2tyLWxpdmUtY3JpY2tldC1zY29yZS1sdWNrbm93LXN1cGVyLWdpYW50cy12cy1rb2xrYXRhLWtuaWdodC1yaWRlcnMtbGl2ZS1zY29yZWJvYXJkLWFuZC11cGRhdGVzLTI5NTQ3MTjSAaUBaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vaXBsLTIwMjIvbGl2ZS1pcGwtc2NvcmUtbHNnLXZzLWtrci1saXZlLWNyaWNrZXQtc2NvcmUtbHVja25vdy1zdXBlci1naWFudHMtdnMta29sa2F0YS1rbmlnaHQtcmlkZXJzLWxpdmUtc2NvcmVib2FyZC1hbmQtdXBkYXRlcy0yOTU0NzE4L2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, LSG vs KKR LIVE Updates: Quinton De Kock Falls After Quickfire Fifty, Lucknow Super Giants 2 Down vs Kolkata Knight Riders¬†¬†NDTV SportsLSG vs KKR, IPL 2022 stats: Head-to-Head record, players to watch out for¬†¬†SportstarLSG vs KKR Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorLSG vs KKR Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing XI, Pitch Report & Injury Updates For Match 53¬†¬†CricTrackerMatch Preview - Super Giants vs KKR, Indian Premier League 2022, 53rd Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-07 14:54:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lucknow Super Giants vs Kolkata Knight Riders: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/lucknow-super-giants-vs-kolkata-knight-riders-live-score-over-match-53-t20-11-15-updates-2955091","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Lucknow Super Giants vs Kolkata Knight Riders from Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune.

During the 53rd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the MCA Stadium in Pune, the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) got off to a worst possible start, with their skipper KL Rahul getting dismissed at the score of naught against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In what can be arguably stated as the most unlucky manner to head back towards the dug out for any player, Rahul had to leave the 22-yard turf without even facing a delivery. It all happened on the fifth delivery of the match being bowled by the Kiwi quick Tim Southee after KKR won the Toss and elected to field first. Southee bowled an inswinging delivery to the felt-handed Quinton de Kock, to which the LSG wicket-keeper drove the ball uppishly towards the cover region. De Kock quickly set off for the single to which Rahul naturally responded. However, only after almost one-and-a-half strides the Proteas batter halted mid-way, only to find his LSG skipper stranded on the middle of the turf. Rahul did try to get back, but a direct hit from Shreyas Iyer meant that he was well short of the crease. Getting out without facing a delivery, KL Rahul was thus dismissed on a rare Diamond duck. Unfortunately for the 30-year-old, this was his third Duck this season, with the previous ones being Golden Ducks , against the Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Gujarat Titans (GT).

Hardik Pandya said he did not want to offer any excuses but added that GT were let down by their batting and rued the two run-outs. Hardik Pandya was run out for a 14-ball 24 while Rahul Tewatia got out in the crucial final over. ‚ÄúOn any day, we‚Äôd take 9 off the last over. The two run-outs cost us the game. I think batters let us down. In T20s, you can‚Äôt lose back to back games,‚Äù said Hardik Pandya in a post-match presentation. ‚ÄúNo blame games as we have cleared such games. We have made rookie mistakes which cost us this one. We played good cricket for 19.2 overs in our innings, one or two hits would have made a difference,‚Äù he added. However, Pandya said the bowlers did a ‚Äòfantastic job‚Äô by putting pressure on Mumbai. He further said that there‚Äôs no need to stress as the Titans still played well and it was just a matter of two deliveries that ended up deciding the game. ‚ÄúWe kind of played 19.2 or 19.3 overs of good cricket, but losing wickets didn‚Äôt help us as I said before. At one point I thought they would post more than 200, but our bowlers did well to restrict them,‚Äù he added. Talking about the match, chasing a target of 178, Wriddhiman Saha (55) and Shubman Gill (52) added 106 for the first wicket but the rest of the batting unit failed to deliver. The star batters of the team David Miller, Rahul Tewatia and Rashid Khan were unable to finish it for the side. As a result, Gujarat fell short of the target by 5 runs after Daniel Sams bowled a stunning final over at the Brabourne Stadium here on Friday. Consequently, GT suffered their second consecutive defeat in IPL 2022.","pubDate":"2022-05-07 14:15:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Worcestershire v Durham, Lancashire v Warwickshire: county cricket ‚Äì live!","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/may/07/county-championship-cricket-live-day-three","keywords":["County Championship","Cricket","Sport","Worcestershire","Durham","Lancashire","Warwickshire"],"creator":["Tanya Aldred"],"video_url":null,"description":"Updates from the third day of the latest Championship gamesThe Spin: sign up to receive our free, weekly cricket newsletterAnd you can contact Tanya by email, Twitter or post BTLOooh, that decision does look a bit dodgy on the slow-mo.Matty Potts!

There has been a development since lunch, which is Keaton Jennings‚Äô sixth first-class century for Lancashire , and his first since July 2021 v Yorkshire. Afternoon from a relatively placid Old Trafford @tjaldred , where Lancs are well ahead but not exactly flying with centurion Jennings and new hope Bohannon nurdling before the new ball.

Middx 319-7. And Ben Stokes is still wicketless at New Road, where Worcestershire have crept up to 266-8, Joe Leach 56 not out. Wright appeals for LBW against Cooke.

And a wicket here at OT, where Luke Wells is a very reluctant walking wicket ,with 80 to his name.

Easy In other news, Keaton Jennings has inched onto fifty with a streaky four through the slips. He told BBC Radio Lancashire‚Äôs Scott Read last night that he felt very uneasy yesterday in his first innings since last August. Feet not moving, everything unfamiliar.

But can you do this, Ben? Photograph: Nick Wood/TGS Photo/REX/Shutterstock 6h ago 05.02 And Ali‚Äôs report on Ben Stokes‚Äôs boom-time: Ben Stokes breaks sixes record with devastating innings for Durham Read more 6h ago 05.02 Friday's round-up While Ben Stokes was causing carnage at New Road , rain brought proceedings to an early close at Old Trafford, but there was time enough for Keaton Jennings, with a tattooist‚Äôs eye, and Luke Wells, with a whitewasher‚Äôs, to put on an unbeaten 127 for Lancashire . Earlier Hasan Ali had picked up two wickets ‚Äì without his punch down, fists-up celebration ‚Äì and Matt Parkinson one, to bowl Warwickshire out for 315. Dom Sibley carried his bat for 142. Essex ‚Äôs long-drawn out 403 on a moribund Chelmsford pitch burst into life when Simon Harmer appeared, biffing 54 in haste. Paul Walter made his maiden first-class century, despite a spell in the nervous nineties, eventually falling for 141. Yorkshire wobbled to 81 for three in reply, a nightwatchman sparing Joe Root from facing the tricky final overs in his first county appearance since he resigned the England captaincy. A last-wicket stand of 55 saved face for Gloucestershire ‚Äôs batters, Ajeet Singh-Dale and Jared Warner seeing opportunity where others saw only devil. Otherwise, it was the Mohammad Abbas show: line and length perfect, six for 45 in his purse. Hampshire ‚Äôs second innings then hit the rocks, 28 for four at stumps, as Mohammad Amir (three for 22) and Ryan Higgins (one for six, after top-scoring for Gloucestershire with 46) swarmed. Northamptonshire were in similar strife at the Oval, though the steady hand of Luke Procter (61 not out) squeezed them past 150 ‚Äì they closed on 154 for eight. Surrey had earlier limbered past 400 thanks to the pummelling efforts of Jamie Overton (59) and Gus Atkinson (an unbeaten 66). In Division Two, Ollie Robinson got back into the groove in his first run-out for Sussex since he returned from West Indies with a back spasm and a flea in his ear from the England management. He bowled Sam Robson for a duck before plucking the leg stump of Middlesex captain Peter Handscomb, whose County Championship life continues to be tricky, and then removed John Simpson‚Äôs middle stump after a well-made 71. Luke Hollman (52) and Martin Andersson (41) then frustrated Sussex with a fruitful seventh-wicket stand. At Sophia Gardens, Kiran Carlson (91) and Sam Northeast (84) sailed Glamorgan to near parity with Leicestershire from the doldrums of 63 for three, with Marnus Labuschagne hooking fatefully for 17 just before lunch.

A lead of 191 in their pocket should be enough but what further chaos can Gloucester cause this morning? Elsewhere, Northants and Worcestershire are in trouble, Yorks and Lancs batters have big days ahead, and Leicestershire need quick Glamorgan wickets.

Playing only their second match at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Lucknow Super Giants captain KL Rahul accepted the opportunity of putting a competitive total on the board in the first innings. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt played too many games here. From whatever we have seen on the TV, it has been sticky and hasn‚Äôt been a high scoring venue. But it gives us a good opportunity as a batting unit to come out and put up a competitive total on the board. We have to assess the conditions and put a challenging total on the board,‚Äù Rahul told Star Sports at the toss. Already at the eighth position on the points table, Knight Riders have suffered a major blow in the form of fast bowler Umesh Yadav suffering a calf injury ahead of this match. ‚ÄúWe have got one change. Unfortunately, Umesh [Yadav] pulled his calf muscle and Harshit Rana comes in.

TOSS - Kolkata have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first! Update from Match 53 - There is another game going on at the moment in Mumbai and it is Rajasthan who require 77 more runs to win off 48 balls against Punjab. Yashasvi Jaiswal has scored a half-century and looks in fine form. That match is turning out to be a nail-biter. So you can switch the tabs while keeping an eye here as well. The rookie team, Lucknow are playing as if they belong here all along. They are sitting with 14 points and are one of the most consistent teams this season. Kolkata on the other hand, despite looking so strong on the paper, are still finding the final XI. The likes of Venkatesh Iyer, Varun Chakaravarthy, and Pat Cummins who they bet so much are not producing enough and it is hurting them. Though it was local heroes, Rinku Singh and Nitish Rana who took them over the line last time. Kolkata will hope they do the job once again. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. Super Saturday means a double dose of entertainment and the second match is between two teams who are travelling in unparalleled ways, it is Lucknow vs Kolkata. Lucknow is sitting at the top half of the points table, while Kolkata have finally found a victory after five unbearable trouncing. On that note, a very warm welcome to our coverage.

The Englishman showed great athleticism to send back an in-form Shikhar Dhawan to the dugout during the powerplay overs.The catch happened in the 6th over of the innings when spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was brought to bowl his very first spell. Ashwin started the over with a wide delivery. In the next one, he went for a slower length delivery. Dhawan came down the pitch and tried to flick the outside-off delivery over the mid-on region where Buttler was positioned.The delivery connected well with the willow and was looking good enough to clear the boundary over Buttler‚Äôs head. But he took one step back and adjusted his position while eyeing the ball. When the ball was just about to cross over his head, Buttler threw himself in the air and attempted to catch it with his right hand. The ball stuck to his hand and he tumbled back to the ground. However, he kept the ball secure, helping Ashwin scalp his first wicket of the game.Even Shikhar Dhawan was stunned after watching the dive from Buttler. The crowd in Wankhede was delighted after witnessing one of the best catches of the tournament.Watch the video here:The dismissal of Dhawan gave an early blow to the Punjab Kings as they were left stumbling 48/1 in 6 overs. Ashwin also put a pause on the explosive show of Jonny Bairstow with an economical over of 2 runs after picking up the crucial wicket.Buttler has been impressive with the bat in this edition of IPL. He has created a storm multiple times on the field with some match-winning knocks for Rajasthan Royals. The orange cap holder has scored three centuries so far in the season.
