Smirin is a Belarusian-born Israeli Grandmaster, who has also featured once in the world’s 20 players. Smirin was making his debut as an English-language commentator, along with Fiona Steil-Antoni, a Woman International Master (WIM).On-air, Smirin made vile comments against women, saying: “Chess is not for women”.However, the story does not end there. Smirin continued, saying: “Why women can play against men and men cannot play against women”.Smirin further went onto say: “why a woman would want to get a men’s GM title.”FIDE, the International Chess Federation, termed Smirin’s comments ‘very embarrassing while also apologising ‘unreservedly’.“Although we have great respect for Grandmaster Ilya Smirin as a chess player, the views he expressed on air are completely unacceptable, offensive, and do not represent any of the values that FIDE stands for,” it said in a statement, adding “Mr Smirin will not continue as a FIDE commentator with immediate effect.”Smirin, however, was quoted as saying by the BBC that he was ‘slightly puzzled, since “did not say anything really bad, did not want to insult or hurt anyone”.“But what I said during the broadcasts was perhaps slightly impolite but nothing more,” Smirin said.“And most of it clearly was a joke. If we will continue like that, the very words ‘man’ and ‘woman’ risk to disappear rather soon. I want to stress that I did not want to hurt anyone, I love and respect chess and women. And I do not like hypocrisy,” Smirin added.While Smirin said he had understood the decision to suspend his commentary duties, he added that ‘common sense will prevail’.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

India were restricted to 17/1 inside the powerplay overs, and Virat Kohli came in at three following Rohit’s dismissal, but hardly made an impact with the bat. Anrich Nortje struck on the first ball after the powerplay to remove the former skipper.KL Rahul’s 56-ball match-winning fifty is now the slowest ever in T20I history by a player from a Test nation!#IndvSA #IndvsSA #SAvInd #SAvsInd— Mohandas Menon (@mohanstatsman) September 28, 2022KL Rahul, however, endured a slow start to his innings, lacking in counter-attack and seemingly being more interested in just playing out deliveries.Just before the drinks break, Nortje dropped Rahul in his follow-through with Rahul on 15. In fact, Rahul looked seemingly out of sorts at just 14 runs off 31 deliveries.However, at the stroke of the 10th over, Rahul hit Nortje for a six over long-on. He reached to 21 off 37 deliveries at the time, and then he hardly looked out of touch.Later on, Rahul made use of the lost opportunity with three more sixes during his innings.In the fourth ball of the 17th, when India finally won the match, Rahul went for the slog-sweep, clearing backward square leg, to get to his fifty inside 56 balls. His knock consisted of two 4s and four 6s.Dominating Suryakumar YadavAfter a shaky start to the chase, Suryakumar Yadav came in as the No 4 batter for India in the seventh over, following Virat Kohli’s dismissal. India were restricted to 17/2 in 6.1 overs, and while the duo of Suryakumar and Rahul forged an unbeaten 93 runs off 63 balls for the third wicket, SKY looked the more aggressive of the two, getting to his fifty in just 33 balls. He took five fours and three sixes to get to the milestone.Surya continues to shine bright as he breaks the record of most T20I sixes in a year 💥💙P.S. We have 3 more months left in 2022 😎#OneFamily #INDvSA @surya_14kumar @BCCI pic.twitter.com/y2S9J5353V— Mumbai Indians (@mipaltan) September 28, 2022In the first ball he faced, SKY was hit on the body off Nortje’s 143 kmph delivery. However, Suryakumar responded strongly with a couple of sixes, courtesy of the flick shot, to collect a dozen off his next two deliveries.Suryakumar continued punishing the South African bowlers with boundaries, and a major highlight of SKY’s innings was hitting Kagiso Rabada for consecutive fours in the 16th over, which in fact took the Men in Blue closer to victory.That was the last of SKY’s boundaries for the night, but his innings was a visual treat for the Indian fans and team members alike.KL Rahul: It was unbelievable for Suryakumar Yadav to come and play those shotsSharp Arshdeep SinghEver since the 23-year-old Arshdeep Singh came into the international cricket limelight in July this year, he has sprung a few surprises on more than one occasion for his team.Wednesday was no different. At the end of the first over of the innings, the Proteas were 1/1, with Temba Bavuma being dismissed for a duck.The dominance of Arshdeep Singh and Deepak Chahar in the first 15 balls. pic.twitter.com/tAMXzueynT— Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) September 28, 2022Arshdeep was introduced into the attack in the second over of the Proteas’ innings, and he certainly delivered for his team in his very first over.Watch: Arshdeep Singh runs through South African top-orderArshdeep’s first victim was Quinton de Kock, who was dismissed in the second ball of the over. De Kock was looking to smash on the off-side, but misread Arshdeep’s length delivery to get a thick inside edge, only for the ball to chop on onto the stumps.Arshdeep struck again in the fifth ball of the over, seeing off Rilee Rossouw who got a thin edge en route to the keeper Rishabh Pant.Read: Arshdeep Singh shows signs of being one of the better investments for Indian cricketDavid Miller faced Arshdeep in the final ball of the second over of the innings, and he was undone by Arshdeep’s inswinger, eventually being clean bowled.Arshdeep went on to finish his four overs with figures of 3/32.Fighting Keshav MaharajSouth Africa were in all sorts of trouble after being restricted to 42/6 from 8 overs, following the dismissal of Aiden Markram.In came Keshav Maharaj, who would go on to score a timely 41 off 35 balls to avoid an embarrassing collapse for his team.Maharaj was involved in a 26-run stand with Wayne Parnell for the seventh wicket, but his more productive stand was a 33-run partnership with Kagiso Rabada for the eighth wicket.However, in the first ball of the 20th, Maharaj was cleaned up by Harshal Patel, after amassing five fours and two sixes.He may have missed out on a fifty, but had it not been for Maharaj’s valiant knock, the Proteas may have been bundled out for an even lower total.Fiery Kagiso RabadaWith figures of 1/16 from four overs, Kagiso Rabada ended up as Proteas’ second most economical bowler in the match, with an economy of just four. Wayne Parnell had an economy of 3.50, but he ended his spell wicketless, finishing with figures of 0/14.Rabada struck in the third over of the Indian run-chase, getting rid of skipper Rohit Sharma for a duck. It was a full-length ball outside off-stump. The ball was angling into the stump, and Rohit got forward to defend it, but ended up getting an edge to the keeper Quinton de Kock.Rabada’s most expensive over was his final one when he went for 10 runs, including two consecutive fours from Suryakumar Yadav. And after Rabada’s spell was complete, it was only a matter of time before India crossed the finish line.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The likes of Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Sam Billings, Tim Bresnan, Micheal Vaughan et al have, for different reasons voiced their opinions against the genuineness of ‘, which dismisses the batter at the non-striker’s end, without the ball being bowled at the batter on-strike. I find the debate of the Mankad really interesting. So many views from either side. I personally wouldn’t like to win a match like that, also, very happy for others to feel differently — Stuart Broad (@StuartBroad8) As for the cricketing fraternity, a huge section does agree with the law, but the same lot strangely, also have a problem with it being used to determine a match outcome. While some bring in the ‘spirit of the game’ to the fold, the others go as far as terming the act itself as ‘cheating’, which involves no skill on the bowler’s part. Star Australian allrounder Ellyse Perry, during an interaction with ‘ however, stated that while she too would not run out a batter at the non-striker’s end, she wouldn’t mind players effecting the same against players from England. “I think the overall gist is no good, don’t do it, but if you’re going to do it, do it to England,” Perry hilariously exclaimed during the podcast. “I’ve actually spent a good month or so with Deepti Sharma, just recently in the UK at ‘The Hundred’ with both at the Birmingham Pheonix, and she is the sweetest human being on the planet! So quietly spoken, and then just comes out on the field with a bit of wildlife, she further exclaimed. The English Cricket fans have just not been able to digest the manner in which the match ended the other day, with Deepti Sharma messing with their senses after she ran Charlotte Dean out at the non-striker’s end, and with it, clean sweeping England 3-0 in the ODI series.","pubDate":"2022-09-28 20:14:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs South Africa 1st T20I, stat attack: Suryakumar Yadav’s multiple records, Rohit Sharma’s winning streak and more","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-south-africa-1st-t20i-stat-attack-suryakumar-yadavs-multiple-records-rohit-sharmas-winning-streak-and-more-11352721.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa 1st T20I, stat attack: Suryakumar Yadav’s multiple records, Rohit Sharma’s winning streak and more","content":"Suryakumar Yadav (50*) and KL Rahul (51*) hit unbeaten half-centuries to power India to an eight-wicket win against South Africa in the first T20 International, at the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday.Keshav Maharaj top-scored for South Africa with a 35-ball 41, while Aiden Markram and Wayne Parnell contributed 25 and 24 respectively as the visitors struggled due to some fine bowling from the Indians.Arshdeep Singh was the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of 3/32, picking up three wickets in a single over, while Deepak Chahar and Harshal Patel grabbed two wickets each.The hosts lost two quick wickets in Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli but Rahul and Yadav steered the side home.From the most number of T20I wins in a single year to the slowest powerplay, many interesting records were made and some dubious records were broken.Here is a glimpse through them –– South Africa were bundled out for 106/8 in their 20 overs after batting first.

As for team India, who had a perfect start to the ongoing series, they would be well aware of the fact that pitches akin the one they played in Thiruvananthapuram, might not be present in Australia, where they will play the T20 World Cup next month onwards. Also, with their death bowling still a matter of concern, skipper Rohit Sharma would like to test his pacers in that very department of their game during the remaining two T20Is against a quality opposition as South Africa.

The second-ever T20I at this venue between India and Sri Lanka in January 2020, had to be abandoned due to rain. The average score across the 16 T20 matches at this venue from 2017-2021 is mere 138.8 runs, proving that this has not traditionally been a high-scoring venue for teams. Additionally, not once has any of the teams here so far have managed to post a total in excess of the 180-run mark.

South Africa, playing the first of their three T20 Internationals at Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday were out of the game before India had bowled three overs.Deepak Chahar, brought into the side after Bhuvneshwar Kumar was packed off the National Cricket Academy after the Australia series, made the most of the occasion.But the bowler who really set the cat among the pigeons was Arshdeep Singh. The left-armer was gifted by an early wicket by Quinton de Kock but a minor adjustment of the radar and the seamer was nearly unplayable in the first three overs he bowled.READ: It was unbelievable for Suryakumar Yadav to come and play those shots, says KL RahulFinishing his first spell at 3/15, Arshdeep had once more put his hand up as a suitable member for the Indian seam-up attack, not just in the current series but also in the upcoming T20 World Cup and long beyond that.The youngster is still in his learning days but has already made his mark and as days go by, it looks like he is learning fast and could well be indispensable in the side in next to no time.All the permutation and combination has been with the World Cup in mind, Arshdeep is already in the 15 for the tournament, so there is no anxiety for the youngster about his place.That is something that has been plaguing many of the other fast bowlers. We just saw how the cricket board said that Mohammad Shami was still not fit enough for the South Africa series but the seamer put up his negative Covid test soon after.Similarly, even Chahar is not really in the fray, in the sense that Bhuvneshwar is the first choice for the right-arm swing bowler in the side.WATCH: Suryakumar hits a mammoth six off Anrich Nortje, lits up the night skyThe only other bowler of this lot who has been in the side is Harshal Patel, which is a little surprising. It is not like he has set the cricket pitch on fire with his display against Australia but somehow, he seems to be in the fray all the while and is also in the World Cup squad.Man for man, under the current circumstances, Arshdeep for sure looks better than Patel. For once, the left-armer brings variety, and more importantly, has shown tremendous poise and quite a bit of control in the death overs.As was seen during the Asia Cup, Arshdeep, young in years, was under tremendous pressure to defend seven runs in the last over in two consecutive matches. While he didn’t manage to do so, neither over was a cakewalk for the batters. He showed enough gumption and calmness to offer them some posers, even in these restricted circumstances.Thereafter, the bowler was sent to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) presumably to iron out some glitches and come back into the fray with better ideas.If that is what it was all about, Arshdeep surely has learned his lessons, and fast.The first wicket in Thiruvananthapuram was a little bit of a gift with De Kock dragging one onto his stumps from a long way off but the other two were pure jewels for a swing bowler.An outswinger, as perfect as it can get, saw Rilee Rossouw fish at one to be comfortable held behind the stumps and then the next delivery, curved wickedly back into left-hander David Miller, making a mockery of his defence and a mess of his stumps.Hit it like SKY! 👌👌 Enjoy that cracking SIX 🎥 🔽Follow the match ▶️ https://t.co/L93S9k4QqDDon’t miss the LIVE coverage of the #INDvSA match on @StarSportsIndia pic.twitter.com/7RzdetvXVh— BCCI (@BCCI) September 28, 20225 wickets summed up in 11 seconds.

While that didn’t really happen, the young man had done enough damage, with Chahar chipping in at the other end, to ensure that it was smooth sailing for India when they batted, even though they lost Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli cheaply,To be fair, Patel did a decent job and eventually, with Arshdeep being a little expensive in his last over, ended up with better figures than the latter at the end of the match.But Patel’s role is a little mystifying. He is not a new-ball exponent, a job that was given to Bhuvneshwar when Jasprit Bumrah was out of action. Also, Arshdeep has done both jobs – opening the bowling and also sending down the death overs. Both jobs, as we saw on Wednesday, he is doing with quite a bit of skill.The young left-armer is definitely one to invest in, as India now seek to see new faces take from the older lot in all formats.Things will also change after the World Cup, as they have done in the past after every big event, so Arshdeep Singh could be on the frontline of all things earlier than we all had imagined.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

His innings proved crucial as the home team eventually won the game against England, who only managed 140/7 in 20 overs.With another match-winning knock, Rizwan has been holding the Pakistan innings together as he is also the bi-lateral tournament’s top scorer with 315 runs. His score sequence against England has been 63, 88 (51), 8 (14), and 68 (46) and only reflects further why a Pakistan side can’t be imagined at the upcoming T20 World Cup with rest of the batters blowing hot and cold.Fourth half-century in the series for @iMRizwanPak 🙌#PAKvENG | #UKSePK pic.twitter.com/Z3wamUaIxp— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) September 28, 2022His opening partner and the team’s captain Babar Azam has been the next impactful batter in the team with a century (110*) in the second ODI, which Pakistan won by 10 wickets. The duo has been the most successful opening partners in T20 history by scoring more than 2000 runs together in a stand.However, Azam, individually, hasn’t been near the purple patch Rizwan is enjoying ahead of the big-ticket event. Apart from his century, Azam has scored 31, 8, and 36, in the remaining games, which is a decent return but is dwarfed by the scoring form of Rizwan.The remaining Pak batting order has been somewhat non-existential as the third batter on the list is Shan Masood with an aggregate of just 101 runs in five games.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Chasing a small target of 107, the home side lost Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli early in the chase but KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav steadied the ship for the team and eventually took them home.While KL struggled a bit in the early stage of the innings, SKY was on song right from the word go as the two batters notched up individual fifties.KL who chipped in with an unbeaten stand of 93 runs for the second wicket with SKY lauded the latter for his knock.

We have played in some difficult conditions like this but I haven’t got runs, so this was hard work. It was unbelievable for Surya to come out there and play those shots, we have seen how balls were flying, nipping around, two-paced and everything that can be hard for a batter that was the wicket today, and for Surya to come with that approach after the first ball that hit him, he just woke up and wanted to play his shots, be aggressive and take on the bowling,” KL said after the match. He also explained that Suryakumar’s innings helped him to take his time and settle down. “That helped me take my time and play one end. (Expect that much help) Not that much. We did practice here yesterday and that was a humbling experience as well, we all came in prepared mentally as it was not going to be an easy wicket and I was ready to do the dirty work, ready to be challenged and get the job done for the team.Earlier, the Indian seamers, especially Deepak Chahar and Arshdeep Singh rattled the South African batting line-up to 9/5 in less than three overs and were eventually restricted to 106/8 in 20 overs. Rahul lavished praise on Arshdeep for his contribution.“He’s (Arshdeep) growing with each game and with each outing he gets better, he is somebody who has a big heart and I have seen him in close quarters while playing in the IPL. This season what he did for his franchise was phenomenal and to be the number one death bowler in a team which has Rabada speaks highly of him. We always want a left-arm seamer and it is great to have someone like Arshdeep,” he added.The two sides will now lock horns with each other in the second T20I in Guwahati on Sunday.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

While a few games have been utterly one-sided, the last one went down to the wire in true sense with the heartbeats of fans increasing on each and every delivery.Jos Buttler, who was earlier expected to feature in the Lahore leg of the series will still be sidelined as his recovery is taking time. Phil Salt will continue in his absence.For Pakistan, Naseem Shah’s absence can prove to be a big blow. The ace pacer felt unwell right after landing in Lahore and is down with viral fever.Pakistan’s middle order has still failed to fire and the tension in that sense might be high amongst the management despite them winning the games. The top order has largely contributed to their runs with Mohammad Rizwan scoring as consistently as any batter can. Shan Masood has also shown a glimpse of what he can do, but he will still be tested.The pitch at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore is again expected to favour the batters. The last match at the venue, between Australia and Pakistan in April, showed that 160 can be chased without much hesitation.However, things might be different with almost six months to that match.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Chasing a 107-run target, India thrived on the back of a 93-run third-wicket partnership between vice-captain KL Rahul (51*) and batter Suryakumar Yadav (50*). Yadav, in particular, didn’t let India get affected by their worst performance in a powerplay. Coming in to bat at No. 4 right after the powerplay, Yadav was up and running within no time on the back of consecutive sixes against South Africa fast bowler Anrich Nortje. Batting in almost his preferred risk-involving manner on a surface not conducive to this format, Yadav hit five fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 151.51. Rahul, on the other hand, hit two fours and four sixes at a strike rate of 91.07 in an innings which remained scratchy for majority of its duration. Before Rahul and Yadav shining as a pair in the second innings, it was India’s new-ball bowling pair of Deepak Chahar and Arshdeep Singh which had put them in a match-winning position within the first 15 balls of the match. With captain Rohit Sharma (0) electing to bowl first, Chahar and Singh joined hands to reduce the Proteas to 9/5 in the third over. Making the new ball swing at will, the right-arm and left-arm bowlers’ testing spells resulted in five South African batters scoring a total of one run between them. Arshdeep Singh was here 😉 — Lucknow Super Giants (@LucknowIPL) Singh, who dismissed Quinton de Kock (1), Rilee Rossouw (0) and David Miller (0) to pick bowling figures of 4-0-32-3 and become the pick of the Indian bowlers, was awarded his maiden match award in international cricket.","pubDate":"2022-09-28 17:17:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Multiple records for Suryakumar Yadav in India's big win - ICC Cricket","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljYy1jcmlja2V0LmNvbS9uZXdzLzI4MDg5MzTSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Multiple records for Suryakumar Yadav in India's big win  ICC CricketSuryakumar back to career-best No. 2 in T20I rankings, Babar just behind at third  ESPNcricinfoSuryakumar Yadav Surpasses Shikhar Dhawan with Most T20I Runs in a Calendar Year  News18India, Pakistan players shine in latest Men's T20I rankings update  ICC CricketMost T20I sixes in a calendar year: Suryakumar surpasses Rizwan with 43 maximums  SportstarView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-28 17:08:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs South Africa: Suryakumar hits a mammoth six off Anrich Nortje, lits up the night sky; Watch","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-south-africa-suryakumar-hits-a-mammoth-six-off-anrich-nortje-lits-up-the-night-sky-watch-11352311.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa: Suryakumar hits a mammoth six off Anrich Nortje, lits up the night sky; Watch","content":"India batter Suryakumar Yadav hit a brilliant six off Anrich Nortje against the run of play in the seventh over of the innings on Wednesday to cheer the crowds after a nervy start.India lost Rohit Sharma (0) in the third over and Virat Kohli (3) in the seventh over and were under some pressure chasing the target of 107 in the first T20I against South Africa.Suryakumar Yadav, however, straight away was in action with back-to-back sixes of Anrich Nortje who was bowling around 143 kmph.On the second delivery Suryakumar faced, he top edged the delivery trying to flick on the leg side.

Deepak Chahar and R Ashwin return. 18:23 (IST)India vs South Africa, LIVE ScoreHello and welcome to our LIVE coverage of the first T20I between India and South Africa in Thiruvananthapuram. This is a chance for both teams to finalise their preparations ahead of the T20 World Cup in October. Preview: India will be looking to round off their T20 World Cup preparation with a marked improvement in their death bowling besides providing crucial game time to its untested players in the three-match series against South Africa, beginning here on Wednesday.India skipper Rohit Sharma, expectedly, singled out death bowling as an area that requires improvement following the series win over Australia.The hosts will be without two of their key bowlers, Hardik Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who have been rested ahead of the ICC event next month.Mohammed Shami, though, has tested negative for COVID-19, but will remain unavailable for the South Africa T20Is.Harshal Patel did not have the best of times in his comeback series against Australia but he will be expected to get back to his best in the final three games before the World Cup.His career economy rate stands at 9.05 but he conceded more than 12 runs per over against the Aussies.Deepak Chahar, who is also on standby for the Word Cup, did not get a game in the previous series and he could get a chance if the team decides to rotate its pacers over the three games.Arshdeep Singh will return to bolster the team’s resources in the slog overs, making an effective combination alongside Jasprit Bumrah, who will be aiming to regain his full rhythm after coming back from injury.In the series decider against Australia, Yuzvendra Chahal showed what he can do if the ball is gripping and turning after looking flat in the first two games.Keeping the Australian conditions in mind, the wily leg-spinner will be looking to up his game on docile pitches.As Rohit spoke about the importance of giving all the players game time ahead of the World Cup, R Ashwin could get a look in.In the batting department, K L Rahul would like to make the most of these three games after missing out on the last two games against Australia.With Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma looking in good touch, it is important that Rahul too is in full flow before the team travels to Australia.Dinesh Karthik got to play all eight balls against Australia and Rohit has already said the designated finisher in the squad needs more time in the middle.With inputs from PTI","pubDate":"2022-09-28 17:00:42","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/09/India-vs-South-Africa-LIVE-1.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Naseem Shah ruled out of T20I series vs England due to THIS infection, big blow for Pakistan ahead of T20 World Cup 2022","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/pak-vs-eng-5th-t20i-naseem-shah-ruled-out-of-t20i-series-vs-england-due-to-pneumonia-big-blow-for-pakistan-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-2022-2515546.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Pakistan Cricket Board said on Wednesday that Naseem's participation in a three-nation tournament in New Zealand which is followed by the World Cup will also be advised by the medical panel which will be monitoring his recovery.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-28 16:50:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“I am calling the batsman back”: Jos Buttler exclaims Mankading is just not his thing; will recall the batter back even during a World Cup final","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-i-am-calling-the-batsman-back-jos-buttler-exclaims-mankading-is-just-not-his-thing-will-recall-the-batter-back-even-during-a-world-cup-final/","keywords":["Cricket","Jos Buttler","Mankading"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jos Buttler exclaims Mankading as a distraction from the game which is actually a contest between bat and the ball.

Joining the likes of Michael Vaughan, Sam Billings, Moeen Ali, and a host of other former or present England players to voice their opinions against ‘Mankading’ or the run out at the non-striker’s end, in some form or the other, is present limited Overs skipper Jos Buttler, as debates around the issue continue unabated. Buttler has perhaps come up with the harshest of criticisms around this form of run out, by even stating that he would recall the batter back if any of his bowlers did dismiss a batter in this manner, even if it was a World Cup final against Australia. “No, I am calling the batsman back,” remarked Buttler during an interaction with talkSPORT. “No one wants to see them in the game because they always create such a talking point when it should be about the battle between bat and ball and watching great games of cricket. They always seem to happen at unsavoury times.” Sorry- there is nothing in the laws that says a warning should ever be given for unfair play. Play by the laws and the game will take care of itself. https://t.co/4Mq1CTq7L3 — Jason Gillespie (@dizzy259) September 26, 2022 Jos Buttler exclaims Mankading law has a lot of grey areas The 32-year-old further commented on the verbatim framing of the ‘Mankading’ law as defined by the MCC – the custodians of the laws of cricket, which he reckons has a lot of grey areas. Buttler referred to the Law 41.16.1, which states, “If the non-striker is out of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be Run out.” The England White Ball captain has his issues with the ‘expected to release the ball’ part of the law, which he considers is not clearly defined and needs to be re-worded. “I think they should re-word it because the way the law is written gives a lot of grey areas – with the “expected to bowl” part so maybe if they just tightened that up,” Buttler remarked. Despite Buttler having issues with the so-called unambiguous wording of the law, the MCC has perhaps, made it explicitly clear as to when the run out at the non-striker’s end is liable to come into play. The phrase “when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball”, clearly refers to the point when the ball is about to be released off the bowler’s hand, which is nothing but the highest point of the bowler’s arm.
