Smirin is a Belarusian-born Israeli Grandmaster, who has also featured once in the world‚Äôs 20 players. Smirin was making his debut as an English-language commentator, along with Fiona Steil-Antoni, a Woman International Master (WIM).On-air, Smirin made vile comments against women, saying: ‚ÄúChess is not for women‚Äù.However, the story does not end there. Smirin continued, saying: ‚ÄúWhy women can play against men and men cannot play against women‚Äù.Smirin further went onto say: ‚Äúwhy a woman would want to get a men‚Äôs GM title.‚ÄùFIDE, the International Chess Federation, termed Smirin‚Äôs comments ‚Äòvery embarrassing while also apologising ‚Äòunreservedly‚Äô.‚ÄúAlthough we have great respect for Grandmaster Ilya Smirin as a chess player, the views he expressed on air are completely unacceptable, offensive, and do not represent any of the values that FIDE stands for,‚Äù it said in a statement, adding ‚ÄúMr Smirin will not continue as a FIDE commentator with immediate effect.‚ÄùSmirin, however, was quoted as saying by the BBC that he was ‚Äòslightly puzzled, since ‚Äúdid not say anything really bad, did not want to insult or hurt anyone‚Äù.‚ÄúBut what I said during the broadcasts was perhaps slightly impolite but nothing more,‚Äù Smirin said.‚ÄúAnd most of it clearly was a joke. If we will continue like that, the very words ‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòwoman‚Äô risk to disappear rather soon. I want to stress that I did not want to hurt anyone, I love and respect chess and women. And I do not like hypocrisy,‚Äù Smirin added.While Smirin said he had understood the decision to suspend his commentary duties, he added that ‚Äòcommon sense will prevail‚Äô.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

India were restricted to 17/1 inside the powerplay overs, and Virat Kohli came in at three following Rohit‚Äôs dismissal, but hardly made an impact with the bat. Anrich Nortje struck on the first ball after the powerplay to remove the former skipper.KL Rahul‚Äôs 56-ball match-winning fifty is now the slowest ever in T20I history by a player from a Test nation!#IndvSA #IndvsSA #SAvInd #SAvsInd‚Äî Mohandas Menon (@mohanstatsman) September 28, 2022KL Rahul, however, endured a slow start to his innings, lacking in counter-attack and seemingly being more interested in just playing out deliveries.Just before the drinks break, Nortje dropped Rahul in his follow-through with Rahul on 15. In fact, Rahul looked seemingly out of sorts at just 14 runs off 31 deliveries.However, at the stroke of the 10th over, Rahul hit Nortje for a six over long-on. He reached to 21 off 37 deliveries at the time, and then he hardly looked out of touch.Later on, Rahul made use of the lost opportunity with three more sixes during his innings.In the fourth ball of the 17th, when India finally won the match, Rahul went for the slog-sweep, clearing backward square leg, to get to his fifty inside 56 balls. His knock consisted of two 4s and four 6s.Dominating Suryakumar YadavAfter a shaky start to the chase, Suryakumar Yadav came in as the No 4 batter for India in the seventh over, following Virat Kohli‚Äôs dismissal. India were restricted to 17/2 in 6.1 overs, and while the duo of Suryakumar and Rahul forged an unbeaten 93 runs off 63 balls for the third wicket, SKY looked the more aggressive of the two, getting to his fifty in just 33 balls. He took five fours and three sixes to get to the milestone.Surya continues to shine bright as he breaks the record of most T20I sixes in a year üí•üíôP.S.

However, Suryakumar responded strongly with a couple of sixes, courtesy of the flick shot, to collect a dozen off his next two deliveries.Suryakumar continued punishing the South African bowlers with boundaries, and a major highlight of SKY‚Äôs innings was hitting Kagiso Rabada for consecutive fours in the 16th over, which in fact took the Men in Blue closer to victory.That was the last of SKY‚Äôs boundaries for the night, but his innings was a visual treat for the Indian fans and team members alike.KL Rahul: It was unbelievable for Suryakumar Yadav to come and play those shotsSharp Arshdeep SinghEver since the 23-year-old Arshdeep Singh came into the international cricket limelight in July this year, he has sprung a few surprises on more than one occasion for his team.Wednesday was no different. At the end of the first over of the innings, the Proteas were 1/1, with Temba Bavuma being dismissed for a duck.The dominance of Arshdeep Singh and Deepak Chahar in the first 15 balls. pic.twitter.com/tAMXzueynT‚Äî Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) September 28, 2022Arshdeep was introduced into the attack in the second over of the Proteas‚Äô innings, and he certainly delivered for his team in his very first over.Watch: Arshdeep Singh runs through South African top-orderArshdeep‚Äôs first victim was Quinton de Kock, who was dismissed in the second ball of the over. De Kock was looking to smash on the off-side, but misread Arshdeep‚Äôs length delivery to get a thick inside edge, only for the ball to chop on onto the stumps.Arshdeep struck again in the fifth ball of the over, seeing off Rilee Rossouw who got a thin edge en route to the keeper Rishabh Pant.Read: Arshdeep Singh shows signs of being one of the better investments for Indian cricketDavid Miller faced Arshdeep in the final ball of the second over of the innings, and he was undone by Arshdeep‚Äôs inswinger, eventually being clean bowled.Arshdeep went on to finish his four overs with figures of 3/32.Fighting Keshav MaharajSouth Africa were in all sorts of trouble after being restricted to 42/6 from 8 overs, following the dismissal of Aiden Markram.In came Keshav Maharaj, who would go on to score a timely 41 off 35 balls to avoid an embarrassing collapse for his team.Maharaj was involved in a 26-run stand with Wayne Parnell for the seventh wicket, but his more productive stand was a 33-run partnership with Kagiso Rabada for the eighth wicket.However, in the first ball of the 20th, Maharaj was cleaned up by Harshal Patel, after amassing five fours and two sixes.He may have missed out on a fifty, but had it not been for Maharaj‚Äôs valiant knock, the Proteas may have been bundled out for an even lower total.Fiery Kagiso RabadaWith figures of 1/16 from four overs, Kagiso Rabada ended up as Proteas‚Äô second most economical bowler in the match, with an economy of just four. Wayne Parnell had an economy of 3.50, but he ended his spell wicketless, finishing with figures of 0/14.Rabada struck in the third over of the Indian run-chase, getting rid of skipper Rohit Sharma for a duck. It was a full-length ball outside off-stump. The ball was angling into the stump, and Rohit got forward to defend it, but ended up getting an edge to the keeper Quinton de Kock.Rabada‚Äôs most expensive over was his final one when he went for 10 runs, including two consecutive fours from Suryakumar Yadav. And after Rabada‚Äôs spell was complete, it was only a matter of time before India crossed the finish line.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The likes of Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Sam Billings, Tim Bresnan, Micheal Vaughan et al have, for different reasons voiced their opinions against the genuineness of ‚Äò, which dismisses the batter at the non-striker‚Äôs end, without the ball being bowled at the batter on-strike. I find the debate of the Mankad really interesting. So many views from either side. I personally wouldn‚Äôt like to win a match like that, also, very happy for others to feel differently ‚Äî Stuart Broad (@StuartBroad8) As for the cricketing fraternity, a huge section does agree with the law, but the same lot strangely, also have a problem with it being used to determine a match outcome. While some bring in the ‚Äòspirit of the game‚Äô to the fold, the others go as far as terming the act itself as ‚Äòcheating‚Äô, which involves no skill on the bowler‚Äôs part. Star Australian allrounder Ellyse Perry, during an interaction with ‚Äò however, stated that while she too would not run out a batter at the non-striker‚Äôs end, she wouldn‚Äôt mind players effecting the same against players from England. ‚ÄúI think the overall gist is no good, don‚Äôt do it, but if you‚Äôre going to do it, do it to England,‚Äù Perry hilariously exclaimed during the podcast. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve actually spent a good month or so with Deepti Sharma, just recently in the UK at ‚ÄòThe Hundred‚Äô with both at the Birmingham Pheonix, and she is the sweetest human being on the planet! So quietly spoken, and then just comes out on the field with a bit of wildlife, she further exclaimed.

The second-ever T20I at this venue between India and Sri Lanka in January 2020, had to be abandoned due to rain. The average score across the 16 T20 matches at this venue from 2017-2021 is mere 138.8 runs, proving that this has not traditionally been a high-scoring venue for teams.

South Africa, playing the first of their three T20 Internationals at Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday were out of the game before India had bowled three overs.Deepak Chahar, brought into the side after Bhuvneshwar Kumar was packed off the National Cricket Academy after the Australia series, made the most of the occasion.But the bowler who really set the cat among the pigeons was Arshdeep Singh. The left-armer was gifted by an early wicket by Quinton de Kock but a minor adjustment of the radar and the seamer was nearly unplayable in the first three overs he bowled.READ: It was unbelievable for Suryakumar Yadav to come and play those shots, says KL RahulFinishing his first spell at 3/15, Arshdeep had once more put his hand up as a suitable member for the Indian seam-up attack, not just in the current series but also in the upcoming T20 World Cup and long beyond that.The youngster is still in his learning days but has already made his mark and as days go by, it looks like he is learning fast and could well be indispensable in the side in next to no time.All the permutation and combination has been with the World Cup in mind, Arshdeep is already in the 15 for the tournament, so there is no anxiety for the youngster about his place.That is something that has been plaguing many of the other fast bowlers. We just saw how the cricket board said that Mohammad Shami was still not fit enough for the South Africa series but the seamer put up his negative Covid test soon after.Similarly, even Chahar is not really in the fray, in the sense that Bhuvneshwar is the first choice for the right-arm swing bowler in the side.WATCH: Suryakumar hits a mammoth six off Anrich Nortje, lits up the night skyThe only other bowler of this lot who has been in the side is Harshal Patel, which is a little surprising. It is not like he has set the cricket pitch on fire with his display against Australia but somehow, he seems to be in the fray all the while and is also in the World Cup squad.Man for man, under the current circumstances, Arshdeep for sure looks better than Patel. For once, the left-armer brings variety, and more importantly, has shown tremendous poise and quite a bit of control in the death overs.As was seen during the Asia Cup, Arshdeep, young in years, was under tremendous pressure to defend seven runs in the last over in two consecutive matches. While he didn‚Äôt manage to do so, neither over was a cakewalk for the batters. He showed enough gumption and calmness to offer them some posers, even in these restricted circumstances.Thereafter, the bowler was sent to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) presumably to iron out some glitches and come back into the fray with better ideas.If that is what it was all about, Arshdeep surely has learned his lessons, and fast.The first wicket in Thiruvananthapuram was a little bit of a gift with De Kock dragging one onto his stumps from a long way off but the other two were pure jewels for a swing bowler.An outswinger, as perfect as it can get, saw Rilee Rossouw fish at one to be comfortable held behind the stumps and then the next delivery, curved wickedly back into left-hander David Miller, making a mockery of his defence and a mess of his stumps.Hit it like SKY! üëåüëå Enjoy that cracking SIX üé• üîΩFollow the match ‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/L93S9k4QqDDon‚Äôt miss the LIVE coverage of the #INDvSA match on @StarSportsIndia pic.twitter.com/7RzdetvXVh‚Äî BCCI (@BCCI) September 28, 20225 wickets summed up in 11 seconds.

While that didn‚Äôt really happen, the young man had done enough damage, with Chahar chipping in at the other end, to ensure that it was smooth sailing for India when they batted, even though they lost Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli cheaply,To be fair, Patel did a decent job and eventually, with Arshdeep being a little expensive in his last over, ended up with better figures than the latter at the end of the match.But Patel‚Äôs role is a little mystifying. He is not a new-ball exponent, a job that was given to Bhuvneshwar when Jasprit Bumrah was out of action. Also, Arshdeep has done both jobs ‚Äì opening the bowling and also sending down the death overs. Both jobs, as we saw on Wednesday, he is doing with quite a bit of skill.The young left-armer is definitely one to invest in, as India now seek to see new faces take from the older lot in all formats.Things will also change after the World Cup, as they have done in the past after every big event, so Arshdeep Singh could be on the frontline of all things earlier than we all had imagined.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

It was unbelievable for Surya to come out there and play those shots, we have seen how balls were flying, nipping around, two-paced and everything that can be hard for a batter that was the wicket today, and for Surya to come with that approach after the first ball that hit him, he just woke up and wanted to play his shots, be aggressive and take on the bowling,‚Äù KL said after the match.¬†He also explained that Suryakumar‚Äôs innings helped him to take his time and settle down. ‚ÄúThat helped me take my time and play one end. (Expect that much help) Not that much. We did practice here yesterday and that was a humbling experience as well, we all came in prepared mentally as it was not going to be an easy wicket and I was ready to do the dirty work, ready to be challenged and get the job done for the team.Earlier, the Indian seamers, especially Deepak Chahar and Arshdeep Singh rattled the South African batting line-up to 9/5 in less than three overs and were eventually restricted to 106/8 in 20 overs.

While a few games have been utterly one-sided, the last one went down to the wire in true sense with the heartbeats of fans increasing on each and every delivery.Jos Buttler, who was earlier expected to feature in the Lahore leg of the series will still be sidelined as his recovery is taking time. Phil Salt will continue in his absence.For Pakistan, Naseem Shah‚Äôs absence can prove to be a big blow. The ace pacer felt unwell right after landing in Lahore and is down with viral fever.Pakistan‚Äôs middle order has still failed to fire and the tension in that sense might be high amongst the management despite them winning the games. The top order has largely contributed to their runs with Mohammad Rizwan scoring as consistently as any batter can. Shan Masood has also shown a glimpse of what he can do, but he will still be tested.The pitch at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore is again expected to favour the batters.

But nevertheless, both the teams were in the contest as South Africa bowled with three slips in the power play.‚ÄúWhen you play a game like that you learn a lot. It was nice to play a game like that. We knew there will be something for the bowlers, but not through the 20 overs we bowled. It was sticky, there was still dampness, and it stayed throughout. There was no sun so it makes it difficult to hit. Both teams were in the contest,‚Äù Rohit said at the post-match presentation.Watch: Suryakumar hits a mammoth six off Anrich Nortje, lits up the night skyEarlier, Arshdeep Singh and Deepak Chahar wreaked havoc as the Proteas were reduced to 9/5 inside powerplay before the lower middle order fought back to cross the 100-run mark.‚ÄúWe got wickets upfront, and that was the turning point. No matter what the conditions, you still have to execute your plans. When you swing the ball like that any batter will struggle. 107, we knew it was not going to be that easy.

Chasing a 107-run target, India thrived on the back of a 93-run third-wicket partnership between vice-captain KL Rahul (51*) and batter Suryakumar Yadav (50*). Yadav, in particular, didn‚Äôt let India get affected by their worst performance in a powerplay. Coming in to bat at No. 4 right after the powerplay, Yadav was up and running within no time on the back of consecutive sixes against South Africa fast bowler Anrich Nortje. Batting in almost his preferred risk-involving manner on a surface not conducive to this format, Yadav hit five fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 151.51. Rahul, on the other hand, hit two fours and four sixes at a strike rate of 91.07 in an innings which remained scratchy for majority of its duration. Before Rahul and Yadav shining as a pair in the second innings, it was India‚Äôs new-ball bowling pair of Deepak Chahar and Arshdeep Singh which had put them in a match-winning position within the first 15 balls of the match. With captain Rohit Sharma (0) electing to bowl first, Chahar and Singh joined hands to reduce the Proteas to 9/5 in the third over.

Buttler has perhaps come up with the harshest of criticisms around this form of run out, by even stating that he would recall the batter back if any of his bowlers did dismiss a batter in this manner, even if it was a World Cup final against Australia. ‚ÄúNo, I am calling the batsman back,‚Äù remarked Buttler during an interaction with talkSPORT. ‚ÄúNo one wants to see them in the game because they always create such a talking point when it should be about the battle between bat and ball and watching great games of cricket. They always seem to happen at unsavoury times.‚Äù Sorry- there is nothing in the laws that says a warning should ever be given for unfair play.

Buttler referred to the Law 41.16.1, which states, ‚ÄúIf the non-striker is out of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be Run out.‚Äù The England White Ball captain has his issues with the ‚Äòexpected to release the ball‚Äô part of the law, which he considers is not clearly defined and needs to be re-worded. ‚ÄúI think they should re-word it because the way the law is written gives a lot of grey areas ‚Äì with the ‚Äúexpected to bowl‚Äù part so maybe if they just tightened that up,‚Äù Buttler remarked. Despite Buttler having issues with the so-called unambiguous wording of the law, the MCC has perhaps, made it explicitly clear as to when the run out at the non-striker‚Äôs end is liable to come into play. The phrase ‚Äúwhen the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball‚Äù, clearly refers to the point when the ball is about to be released off the bowler‚Äôs hand, which is nothing but the highest point of the bowler‚Äôs arm.
