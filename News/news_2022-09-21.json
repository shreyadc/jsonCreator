Pandya bounced back to form in style with a blistering 71 not out off 30 balls, helping the Men in Blue post a formidable 208/6.Read: Hardik Pandya’s batting unparalleled assault goes in vain as bowlers stumbleBut the bowling, especially the pace department, once again let the team down, with the hosts leaking 53 runs from overs 17 to 19 — 31 of those coming off two Bhuvneshwar overs, with Harshal Patel bowling the other one.And it wasn’t just the pace bowling department that didn’t fire on the day — India’s fielding wasn’t up to the mark either as three catches were put down during Australia’s run chase.Cameron Green, who opened for the first time in international cricket and laid the foundation for a successful chase with a lively 61, was the first to be handed a lifeline. And it was Axar Patel, one of the better fielders in the Indian team, who put down the chance at deep midwicket off Hardik Pandya’s bowling to allow Green, then batting on 42, to bring up his half-century.Axar would then have a chance fluffed off his own bowling the very next over, this time India vice-captain Rahul spilling a chance at long off, with Steve Smith surviving on 19. The Aussie No 3 would go on to add another 16 to his score.Read: Men in Blue’s listless bowling at death and other talking points from 1st T20IThe third dropped chance would then occur in the 18th over, in which the pair of Matthew Wade and Tim David plundered 22 runs in Harshal’s final over. The seamer, returning to the XI after an extended injury layoff, dropped a tough catch off his own bowling after Wade chipped the ball in his direction.Wade would make the most of the chance handed to him by smashing three consecutive boundaries off Bhuvneshwar in the penultimate over to bring the equation down to two off the last six balls, finishing unbeaten on 45 off 21 balls.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Buttler isn’t expected to play until the last two matches that take place in Lahore, and might end up skipping the whole series altogether as he has been advised to go easy on his recovery before the T20 World Cup.PAK vs ENG, 1st T20I stat attack: Hales ends long wait, Rizwan joins elite list and moreThings haven’t been going Pakistan’s way in the recent weeks.

Pakistan might have felt they could have added 15-20 more runs, but wickets at regular intervals hurt their momentum after a strong start. Skipper Babar Azam (31) and his opening partner Mohammad Rizwan (68) provided a fiery start to the hosts’ innings, forging an 85-run stand for the first wicket, before Adil Rashid cleaned up Babar Azam in the 10th over.Debutant Luke Wood impressed with figures of 3/24 from four overs, and he played a major part in restricting Pakistan to 158. Barring Rizwan, none of the Pakistan batters could convert starts into big knocks, and the closest scorer after Azam was Iftikhar Ahmed (28 off 17 balls).Pakistan gained early momentum in England’s run-chase, removing Phil Salt (10) in the third over, and even managed to get rid of Dawid Malan (20) in the seventh over, but Alex Hales (53) and Harry Brook (42*) forged a 55-run stand for the fourth wicket, that changed the course of the game.Hales was dismissed in the 17th over, but stand-in skipper Moeen Ali and Brook ensured England crossed the finish line with four deliveries to spare.With the series now in early 1-0 favour of England, let’s take a look at some interesting statistics from the game:This was England’s first tour to Pakistan in 17 years, last having toured the country in 2005. This was also England’s first T20I victory on Pakistan soil.Mohammad Rizwan became the joint-fastest man to get to 2000 T20I runs, equalling his national skipper Babar Azam. Both Rizwan and Babar took 52 innings to get to the milestone.Tuesday marked 1291 days since Alex Hales last batted in an England shirt. Before Tuesday, Hales’ last international match for England had come on 10 March, 2019, in a T20I against West Indies in the Caribbean.This was also Hales’ first T20I fifty in 1538 days, his last in the same international format coming against India on 6 July, 2018.The first T20I marked England’s first international match on Pakistan soil after 6118 days, having last toured the country in December 2005 comprising of Tests and ODIs.Pakistan made a strong start after being put into bat, scoring 87 runs for the loss of just one wicket in the first ten overs, but lost six wickets in the next ten, while managing only 71 runs during that phase.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

And much like those games, senior bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar was once again guilty of leaking too many runs in the death over, this time going for 31 runs in the 17th and 19th overs.However, the match also witnessed some positives, such as Hardik Pandya returning to form with the bat as he blazed his way to an unbeaten 71 off just 30 balls, helping India post 208/6.

He went level with Guptill’s 172 sixes in the format with a whip over long leg off Pat Cummins, his only maximum of the innings.— Harshal Patel has now conceded 40 or more runs in a T20I five times this year.

The same was true of the Men in Blue in the series opener against the defending T20 world champions at the IS Bindra PCA Stadium, where Australia ended up chasing the 209-run target down with four balls to spare, grabbing a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Read: Hardik Pandya’s batting unparalleled assault goes in vain as bowlers stumbleThe ongoing series against Australia along with South Africa’s upcoming tour of India are meant to serve as a dress rehearsal for the Indians in their preparation for the T20 World Cup that takes place Down Under starting next month. And with the kind of performance dished out on Tuesday, there still is a plenty for skipper Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid to ponder over.Here we take a look at five talking points from the opening T20I:India’s death bowling woes:While Jasprit Bumrah’s inclusion in the squad was a major boost to the Indians, the star pacer wasn’t included in the opening T20I, meaning Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav and Harshal Patel had to share the seam-bowling duties with assistance from Hardik Pandya. And Bumrah’s death-bowling skills were once again sorely missed by the Men in Blue as the pair of Matthew Wade and Tim David virtually killed the contest by collecting 53 runs between the 17th and 19th overs, bringing the equation down from 55 off 24 to 2 off 6.Read: Fans fume at host’s bowling after they lose opening T20I, check reactionsBhuvneshwar had entered this series on the back of two horrid penultimate overs bowled against Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the Super 4s of the Asia Cup and his confident took an even bigger hit after conceding 31 of the 53 runs mentioned above, finishing with disastrous figures of 4-0-52-0.Pandya re-establishes middle-order credentialsPandya’s form both with bat and ball had taken a hit after a match-winning all-round display in the opening game of the Asia Cup against Pakistan. The Gujarat Titans captain however, bounced back to form in style before anyone could begin to doubt his place in the middle-order.Pandya walked in at a time when the pair of KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav had done a fine rebuilding job after a shaky start to the innings. And the manner in which he took the Aussie attack to the cleaners, smashing seven fours and five sixes, was a sign of the all-rounder back at his destructive best with the bat in hand. Pandya ended the innings on a flourish, smashing a hat-trick of sixes off Cameron Green in the last three balls, ensuring India posted a formidable total on the board.Green a fine backup to WarnerAustralia are missing several first-team players in this series, including opener David Warner, and Josh Inglis was seen among the options the visiting team had for partnering captain Aaron Finch at the start of the innings.For a change, however, all-rounder Cameron Green walked out at the start of the chase, an unfamiliar position for him in international cricket. And he took to the job of batting in the powerplay like duck to water. While Finch, who had registered seven single-digit scores in his last eight outings, couldn’t quite convert a promising start into a bigger score, it was Cameron Green’s fireworks that gave the visitors the start that they needed to successfully chase down a target of this size. His 30-ball 61 was laced with eight fours and four sixes and the Western Australian struck at over 200, giving the team management a solid back-up to Warner.Axar’s day outSpeaking of back-ups, how good was Axar Patel in the series opener! At a time when India are sweating over Ravindra Jadeja’s absence due to injury, not just from their home assignments but in the upcoming World Cup as well, his like-for-like replacement delivered a performance with the ball gave the team management something to smile about and was a big positive in an otherwise insipid bowling display.Axar finished with a fine haul of 3/17 from four overs, the kind of performance that wins you matches more often than not and would’ve seen India through to a victory had it not been for the brainfade in the death overs. Among his wickets was top-scorer Green, who departure in the 11th over began a mid-innings revival of sorts for the Men in Blue.Rahul silences the opener debate… for nowOne of the key talking points heading into India’s home fixtures against Australia and South Africa was the debate over Rohit Sharma’s opening partner, especially after Virat Kohli’s brilliant hundred against Afghanistan at the top of the order in their final Asia Cup outing.Whip(K)lash Rahul! 👌 👌How about that for a SIX! 👏 👏Follow the match 👉 https://t.co/ZYG17eC71l #TeamIndia | @klrahulDon’t miss the LIVE coverage of the #INDvAUS match on @StarSportsIndia pic.twitter.com/UwwUDArHiP— BCCI (@BCCI) September 20, 2022On a day when both Rohit and Virat — the first-choice opening pair according to some — were sent back to the hut early, it was Rahul who stood up for the hosts with his 35-ball 55 that comprised four fours and three sixes. The Lucknow Super Giants captain led India’s revival after the shaky start in the powerplay, forging a 68-run third-wicket stand with SKY. And it’s not just runs, his strike rate of 157.14 should also shut the critics up for a while.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Pakistan have posted 158/7, but one cannot say if Pakistan would be happy with the total given that they lost a flurry of wickets in the second half of the innings. England will need 159 runs to win when they walk out for the chase. 21:37 (IST)OUT! Taken by Duckett who just hangs on for the catch before the boundary ropes to remove Iftikhar Ahmed.

Read Bansal Shah's preview of the series here. 19:05 (IST)Hello and welcome to our LIVE coverage of the first T20I between Pakistan and England in Karachi. It's a historic occasion as England is touring Pakistan for the first time in 17 years, having last toured the country in 2005. Stay tuned for more updates. Pakistan vs England, 1st T20I, LIVE CRICKET SCORE and UPDATES, Ball by ball commentary: ENGLAND WIN! Harry Brook seals the deal with a four, carving over the extra cover region for the boundary, with four balls remaining.Preview: Moeen Ali returns to his roots in Pakistan to lead England in a seven-match series as both nations fine-tune for next month’s T20 World Cup.Ali will captain England because Twenty20 skipper Jos Buttler is recovering from a calf injury and is expected to play in only one or two games toward the end of the series, which begins Tuesday.“Captaining England in any game, anywhere in the world, is a huge honor,” Ali said. “Obviously, with my roots being from here and to lead England … it’s huge and it’s (a) very proud moment for me and my family, my mum and dad and everybody.”England’s first tour to Pakistan since 2005 starts in Karachi, which will host four games. The remaining three will be played in Lahore from Sept. 28-Oct. 2.Buttler is with the squad and has been undergoing rehabilitation, but Ali said the recurring of the injury during the Hundred back home has forced the England captain to be extra careful.“Maybe in the back end of the tour he will play one or two games, but we’re not sure yet,” Ali said. “Obviously with the World Cup in Australia, it’s huge for us and we want him fully fit for the whole competition there.”The T20 World Cup begins in mid-October.At least eight members of the England squad like Ali himself, Harry Brook, Alex Hales and Phil Salt have experience playing in Pakistan for various franchises in the Pakistan Super League.That experience could come in handy for an England team that is without its key T20 World Cup player Ben Stokes.Fast bowlers Mark Wood and Chris Woakes are returning to the team after being sidelined for most of the summer because of injuries. Jonny Bairstow was ruled out of the T20 World Cup due to freak injury while playing golf while out-of-form Jason Roy was dropped both for the tour of Pakistan and the T20 World Cup.With inputs from The Associated Press Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The first part of the plan came good in the first of the three T20 Internationals against Australia at the I.S. Bindra Stadium in Mohali on Tuesday night, but the second part, once again, was found to be woefully short.While there has been a lot of talk about how the Indian middle-order has not been delivering when needed, the stark truth is that any bowling attack that can’t defend 208 runs evidently has a lot to answer for. As for the batter, at least on this day did what was expected of them, with Hardik Pandya leading an unparalleled run-riot, even which didn’t give the bowlers enough to defend.Pandya, when in his elements, is something else altogether. Time and again, he has come into the match with India either needing quick runs, or needing to chase down a stiff target and more often than not, he has hammered home his batting power.Things went right down to the wire but it’s Australia who won the first #INDvAUS T20I.#TeamIndia will look to bounce back in the second T20I.Scorecard 👉 https://t.co/ZYG17eC71l pic.twitter.com/PvxtKxhpav— BCCI (@BCCI) September 20, 2022Tuesday evening in Mohali was no different.Coming in with India at 103/3 in 11.5 overs when Rahul left, Pandya and Yadav kept finding the boundary in sensational fashion. Once Yadav left, Pandya took over the batting reins to clatter the Australian bowlers to all corners, his efforts culminating with three consecutive sixes off the last three balls of the inning as he ended with 71 not out of just 30 balls, with seven boundaries and five sixes, at a strike rate of 236.7.The Indian top-order somehow invariably contrives to see that only one out of three actually get big runs. It is quite a statement that the top batters – Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli – among the best in the business anywhere, can’t be all seen scoring consistently.In the Asia Cup, by and large it was Kohli who delivered more of than not, while Rahul was anywhere near as effective as he was on Tuesday. As for Sharma, he seems to reach these high 20s and low 30s and precious little beyond.Sharma has not been batting as long at the top of the order as the team would ideally like, so there is always at least one wicket, if not two, that go down during the Powerplay. Quite strange, considering that those six overs are the ones to be really capitalised on, especially by a batter of his calibre.Also, Rahul was dismissed right when he didn’t need to go, to a shot which was simply not merited with the fielding placed by Aaron Finch. But that is also something we’ve seen before.But invariably these issues get brushed under the carpet when the team manages to crack the 200-run target in 20 overs.Even though often India have fallen short of this in the recent past, there was little to complain about in Mohali as the top and middle-order saw runs coming and gave the bowlers quite a considerable target to defend.Rahul, it seems, has opted to go on the attack and it worked wonders for him this time around. His very hesitant and ineffective approach of the Asia Cup seems to be a thing of the past, or at least was in this match. He went on the offensive right from the beginning, making maximum use of the pace provided by the Australian fast bowlers, both Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, and also Cameron Green.If there was one bowler that he and the rest of the Indian batters had to give some respect to, that was the unassuming Nathan Ellis. But the rest, including the spinners, were carted around enough for India to get a big total. Suryakumar Yadav, coming in after Kohli left cheaply, did what he does best – play the angles.There are few batters in India more gifted in terms of making the unorthodox look authentic like Yadav. His ability to use his super-flexible and powerful wrists to find some angles which the rest can only dream about make him one of the most difficult to bowl at.Yadav’s 46 off 25 at a strike rate of 184 was just the kind of undercard to the big show in the Indian batting – that knock by Pandya.A few questions do crop up here. In Pandya, India have a finisher like no one else, so what exactly is Dinesh Karthik’s role? Especially when he is sent in to bat even after Axar Patel. Surely it cannot be that Karthik has to bat only five overs, and not one ball extra?Also, if this is the combination, and this is how Rahul, Yadav and Pandya bat, exactly where does Rishabh Pant fit into the scene? As things stand, not one of the batters among these three will be moved from their slots. Unless Pandya is demoted and Karthik is benched. The latter is a distinct possibility but the former is a bad idea, in his current form.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

A proud Indian, Sunil Gavaskar would always get furious whenever anyone in his vicinity uttered the word ‘Mankading’, as he reckoned it was an insult to one of the country’s first superstar cricketers, Vinoo Mankad. In the 1948 tour of Australia, Mankad had famously run out home team keeper Bill Brown, who would often leave his crease at the non- striker’s end, to gain a few yards. Mankad did warn Brown a couple of times before running him out for trying to “unfairly gain ground”. It was a perfectly legal mode of dismissal, but the Australian media termed it ‘Mankading’. The first world countries — England and Australia — picked up the term and maintained that the practice is against the spirit of the game. “Why do we call it Mankading and not Browned?” Gavaskar once asked. Kapil Dev was panned in 1992 for running out Peter Kirsten in an ODI, while Murali Kartik faced the wrath many times during his career for Railways and English county cricket, simply for playing by the rule book. When Ravichandran Ashwin ran Jos Buttler out during an IPL game, all hell broke loose with Jimmy Anderson, playfully (but not without making a point), putting the Indian off-spinner’s photograph in a shredder. Metaphorically tearing Ashwin to shreds for playing within the spirit of the game. With the ICC finally terming it ‘run out’ and removing ‘unfair play’ in its rule book, the de-stigmatization of running players out at non- striker’s has started. The ICC’s playing condition rule changes will come into effect from October 1. The PTI looks at each rule and its implication on the teams. Rule 1. Batters returning when caught: When a batter is out caught, the new batter will come in at the end the striker is, regardless of whether the batters crossed prior to the catch being taken. Implication: In close games, this rule will be gold dust for the bowling teams. Often when the last couple of wickets are left and at least one established batter at the non-striker’s end, normally during a catch the crossing over would give a distinct advantage to the set batter. But the rule change means that at the fall of ninth wicket due to a catch, No. 11 will have to take strike. Rule 2: Use of saliva to polish the ball: This prohibition has been in place for over two years in international cricket as a Covid-related temporary measure, and it is considered appropriate for the ban to be made permanent. Implication: Saliva is heavier than body sweat and over decades, it has helped bowlers use it as one of the methods to keep the shine on one side and make it heavier as the other side scruffs up. That is how reverse swing came into play and if one looks at the Test matches in last two years, conventional swing is taking over reverse in red ball format. Rule 3: Incoming batter ready to face the ball: An incoming batter will now be required to be ready to take strike within two minutes in Tests and ODIs, while the current threshold of ninety seconds in T20Is remains unchanged. Implications: This is done to avoid deliberate time-wasting tactics, especially in close Test matches on the fifth day, when a team batting in the fourth innings during final stages tries to delay proceedings. Rule 4: Striker’s right to play the ball: This is restricted so as to require some part of their bat or person to remain within the pitch. Should they venture beyond that, the umpire will call and signal dead ball. Any ball which would force the batter to leave the pitch will also be called no ball. Implications: There is no such significance as this is very, very rare at the highest level. Rule 5: Unfair movement by the fielding side: Any unfair and deliberate movement while the bowler is running in to bowl could now result in the umpire awarding five penalty runs to the batting side, in addition to it being called a dead ball. Implications: Fielders normally back up and cover some ground, but that would now be deemed unfair if it happens before the delivery is completed. Some quick singles inside the circle, that used to be saved, might not be otherwise. Rule 6: Running out of the non-striker: The playing conditions follow the laws in moving this method of effecting a run out from the ‘unfair play’ section to the ‘run out’ section. Implication: The rule has always been in place, but it is the bowler who has got the stick from the cricket community as the Australians and English saw it as going against the spirit of cricket. Bowlers have been judged over the years for what is deemed legal in letter but not in spirit. It will change now. Rule 7: Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery: Previously, a bowler who saw the batter advancing down the wicket before entering their delivery stride, could throw the ball in an attempt to run out the striker. This practice will now be called a dead ball. Implication: Nothing much as most bowlers aren’t seen using this ploy. Especially fast bowlers are in motion, and even if they find a batter giving charge while loading up, it’s difficult to pull out of the action as it could cause injuries. Rule 7: The in-match penalty introduced in T20Is in January 2022 (whereby the failure of a fielding team to bowl their overs by the scheduled cessation time leads to an additional fielder having to be brought inside the fielding circle for the remaining overs of the innings), will also be adopted in ODI matches after the completion of the ICC Men’s World Cup Super League in 2023. Implication: The teams are now taking nearly four hours at times to complete the 50 overs knowing that only a token financial penalty is in place, and that too, paid by the boards. This rule would mean that one less fielder outside the 30-yard circle in last two or three overs could massively impact the game.The post New ICC rules could deem reverse swing extinct appeared first on Northlines.","pubDate":"2022-09-20 17:59:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenorthlines","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rohit Sharma captaincy record in T20 International: Is Rohit Sharma a good captain in T20I?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rohit-sharma-captaincy-record-in-t20-international-is-rohit-sharma-a-good-captain-in-t20i/","keywords":["Cricket","India","Rohit Sharma"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rohit Sharma captaincy record in T20 International: The Indian all-format skipper has had a great journey so far while leading in T20Is.

En route the target of 209, the Aaron Finch-led side were off to a fiery 39-run stand for the opening wicket in mere 3.3 Overs, with Cameron Green (61 off 30), opening the innings for the first time in Australian colours, decimating the Indian new ball bowlers right from the get-go. Yeh bowling attack nahi bowling surrender hai. — Vipul Goyal (@HumorouslyVipul) September 20, 2022 Post Finch’s dismissal as well, Green carried on with his onslaught along Steve Smith next, as the duo stitched together a 70-run stand off mere 40 deliveries for the second wicket, to go up and running with the steep chase. With 100 runs required off the last ten Overs, and nine wickets in the bank, Australia were in the driver’s seat despite losing three wickets within the next three Overs. However, with the entire batting line-up having made their minds up to play risk-free Cricket, there was no stopping for the Aussies tonight, as they accomplished the target with four deliveries to spare. Matthew Wade (45* off 21) handed some hefty blows during the 18th Over (22 runs) and the penultimate Over (16 runs) to show the Mohali crowd, that they are the World Champions for a reason. Rohit Sharma captaincy record in T20 International In terms of number of wins, Rohit Sharma had, after team India’s victory versus Hong Kong in the recently concluded Asia Cup 2022, become the second- most successful Indian skipper in the format, surpassing Virat Kohli (30 wins), with 31 wins across mere 37 T20Is. Despite India losing the next matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka to crash out of the Asia Cup, and after losing tonight’s encounter versus Australia in Mohali, Rohit, is still India’s best T20I captain so far, in terms of win percentage, which currently stands at 77.50. Overall, across 40 T20I matches as captain, the 35-year-old has notched-up 31 victories under his belt, while losing nine.

K L Rahul (55 off 35 balls) and Hardik Pandya (71 not out off 30) helped India post a daunting 208 for six after Australia put the hosts in to bat.Australia were dominant in the run chase, romping home in 19.2 overs. Last year’s World Cup hero Matthew Wade (45 not out off 21) and Cameron Green (61 off 30) played special knocks to make short work of a stiff target. It was a formidable total but the way Australia started, an early finish was on the cards.Opening for the first time in international cricket, Green was in a menacing mood as he hammered comeback man Umesh Yadav for four successive boundaries in his first T20 since February 2019. The seasoned Indian pacer felt the heat straightaway and resorted to bowling slower balls in his very first over, which did not work.There wasn’t heavy dew but no swing was on offer for both Umesh and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The batters were able to hit through the line, making the Indian attack look very ordinary.The stand-out bowler for India, Axar Patel, removed opposition skipper Aaron Finch to get a much-needed breakthrough. However, more carnage was in store as Green, who is not even part of Australia’s T20 World Cup squad, toyed with the bowling while Steve Smith enjoyed from the other end.In the eighth over, he slog-swept Yuzvendra Chahal for a couple of sixes and a four for a 19-run over. India dropping Green and Smith also did not help their cause.At 109 for one in 10 overs, Australia were running away with the contest before India fought back with three quick wickets, two of those coming via Rohit Sharma’s brilliant DRS calls, which sent Smith and Glenn Maxwell back in the hut.With five wickets in hand, Australia needed 55 off the last 24 balls.However, Australia debutant Tim David in the company of the experienced Wade went ballistic in the death overs to complete a fine run chase.Two big overs in which Bhuvneshwar leaked 15 and Harshal 22 sealed the home team’s fate.As expected, Indian fans took to social media to lash out at India’s horrible bowling which was the main reason behind hosts’ defeat in the opening match of the series.

Jasprit Bumrah, who was picked for the series after recovering from a back injury, was surprisingly not selected for the series opener. Dinesh Karthik was picked ahead of Rishabh Pant.After Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli fell cheaply, Rahul and Suryakumar shared a 68-run stand off 42 balls. It was raining sixes when they were in the middle.Rahul’s walk across the stumps to dispatch Josh Hazlewood over the cow corner made his intent clear before he whipped Cameron Green for a massive six over deep square leg.Suryakumar’s style of play is often awe-inspiring and the Mohali crowd got to see him at his lethal best.Of his four sixes, his swat over fine leg off a good length ball from Cummins stood out.India were able to maintain their tempo in the middle overs as Suryakumar picked up leggie Adam Zampa for two successive sixes over long on and deep midwicket.Hardik then took over and pushed India past 200. He was quick to punish anything short from the pacers and his pick-up shot off Pat Cummins in the 18th over was the highlight of his entertaining knock.He smashed three consecutive sixes off Green in the 20th over including a flat one in the mid wicket region.

During the innings break, Rahul said he had played a lot in Mohali during his stint with PBKS in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and he knew what shots worked at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium. Rahul, who has been on the receiving end of criticism for low strike rate in the shortest format, scored his runs at 157.14 as he struck three sixes and four boundaries in his knock of 55 runs off 35 deliveries. \"Looks a good pitch. It took some time to get used to the bounce of the pitch. I have played here in the IPL and I knew the shots that work here. I used my experience. I always work on hitting on both sides of the ground and get into good positions. Fortunately the ball was in the areas where I could hit it for sixes. Glad they came off the middle of the bat,\" Rahul said after India put up 208 runs on the board. India's 208 for 6 was also the Men in Blue's highest total against Australia in the T20Is. Their previous best was 202 for 4, which had come in Rajkot in 2013. Rahul's 55 runs took his T20I runs tally to over 2,000 runs. He became the second-fastest Indian batter to do so as he reached the landmark in 58 innings, two more than Virat Kohli. Overall, Rahul was the third-fastest to 2,000 T20I runs, after Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan (52 innings each) and Kohli. When Rahul got out, India's score was 103 for the loss of three wickets in 11.5 overs. Earlier, Rahul had a forgettable run in the Asia Cup where he struggled against quality fast bowling. Apart from the 62-run knock that he played against Afghanistan, Rahul looked to be struggling in every game. 92M flick from vice-captain @klrahul & captain @ImRo45 loved it😍 📸: Disney+Hotstar pic.twitter.com/LZbJPFSMPw In 62 matches so far in his T20I career for India, Rahul has scored 2,018 runs at an average of 39.56 and strike rate of 141.31. He has recorded two centuries so far, with the hundreds coming against the West Indies (2016) and England (2018). Meanwhile, earlier in the innings India captain Rohit Sharma equaled New Zealand opener Martin Guptill in the list of most sixes in the T20Is. Rohit, who struck a six in his knock of 11 off 9 balls in the first innings on Tuesday, now has 172 sixes in the T20Is, the same as Guptill. West Indies' Chris Gayle is second in the list with 124 strikes, ahead of former England captain Eoin Morgan (120), Australia skipper Aaron Finch (118), and Ireland's Paul Sterling (111).","pubDate":"2022-09-20 17:41:32","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/09/20/500x300_1313120-kl-rahul.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia cruise to victory as Indian bowlers falter in first T20I","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/australia-cruise-to-victory-as-indian-bowlers-falter-in-first-t20i/","keywords":["Prime News","Sports"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mohali: Cameron Green’s (61, 30b, 8×4, 4×6) opening salvo and a 62-run partnership for the sixth wicket between Matthew Wade (45 n o, 21b, 6×4, 2×6) and Tim David (18, 14b, 1×4, 1×6) helped World Champions Australia beat India by four wickets in the first game of the three-match T20I series at the IS Bindra […]","content":"Mohali: Cameron Green’s (61, 30b, 8×4, 4×6) opening salvo and a 62-run partnership for the sixth wicket between Matthew Wade (45 n o, 21b, 6×4, 2×6) and Tim David (18, 14b, 1×4, 1×6) helped World Champions Australia beat India by four wickets in the first game of the three-match T20I series at the IS Bindra Stadium here Tuesday. After being put in, India scored 208 for the loss of six wickets riding on a magnificent knock by Hardik Pandya (71 n o, 30b, 7×4, 5×6), but in the end it did not prove enough. Australia comfortably overhauled the score with four balls to spare reaching 211 for 6 in 19.2 overs.

Axar Patel was the pick of the bowlers for India PTI photo The result will certainly leave Rohit Sharma a worried man though at the end of the game he tried to present a brave face. India’s T20 display in the last few games have really showed, why the Men in Blue cannot be considered favourites for the World Cup which begins next month in Australia. The Indian bowlers were bad in the power play and bowled too many loose deliveries to create any pressure on the Australian batters. The end result was that Rohit was left an exasperated man. If this form of bowling continues, India will certainly have to look for some other options.
