Gujarat Titans captain Hardik Pandya is enjoying his maiden Indian Premier League season as a captain. Pandya, who labeled the additional responsibility as “fun”, has led Titans to the top of the points table on the back of winning four out of their first five IPL 2022 matches. Pandya, 28, who hadn’t played a lot of cricket coming in to the 15th season of the biggest T20 tournament across the globe, has contributed across divisions and how this season. “Captaincy is fun and it allows me to take responsibility and be the flag-bearer. The group carries one another. The team is gelling well. I wanted all of us to be happy for each other’s happiness. That is working well for the team,” Pandya told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony. GT have been the surprise package of the season. Lots of credit should go to @hardikpandya7 and Nehra ji. Both are quite relaxed characters and keep things simple. Hardik definitely the standout new captain of this season. #RRvGT #IPL2022 — Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) April 14, 2022 Hardik Pandya Injury Update Having promoted himself to No. 4 this season, Pandya has stood tall on his batting potential scoring 228 runs in five innings at an average of 76 and a strike rate of 136.52 to be the second-highest run-scorer. A couple of early wickets in the recently concluded match against Rajasthan Royals witnessed Pandya walking in to bat in the third over. A match-winning sixth IPL half-century saw Pandya scoring 87* (52) with the help of eight fours and four sixes to power Titans to 192/4 in 20 overs. “I am not used to batting this long. It gives me a lot of time. I can calculate and take risk. The last game it did not come off but today I made sure I did. I have been in this situation where I have taken the role of scoring 12-ball 30. It is difficult but now at [number] four I can control the game,” Pandya said. With Rajasthan opening batter Jos Buttler scoring boundaries left, right and centre in the powerplay, Pandya had no option than to introduce himself in the bowling attack. Pandya, who had run out his counterpart Sanju Samson (11), followed it with a caught and bowled to dismiss James Neesham (17) to become a deserving candidate of his seventh IPL Player of the Match award. That being said, a consequence of all of this was Pandya struggling with his fitness on the field. In what started with him leaving the ground at first, it appeared to have become serious after Pandya opted to not complete his third over. While fans couldn’t help but think of Pandya injuring his back again, he shared a relieving clarity on his injury after the match. “It was just cramps, nothing serious,” Pandya mentioned to ease the tension of his fans..

That's it from the coverage of this game. The Indian T20 League action continues on 15th April, where Hyderabad will take on Kolkata. The first ball will be bowled at 7.30 pm IST (2 pm GMT). But as you all know, you can join us early for the build-up. Till then take care and goodbye! Hardik Pandya, the skipper of Gujarat is the Player of the Match. He says it feels pretty special as he is putting in hard work. Tells that it is just cramps and he feels okay. Adds that he is not used to batting this much but he feels better since the last two games and this just helps other batters to play freely. He enjoys being the flag bearer and everyone is playing and enjoying as a group. Lockie Ferguson is down for a chat. He says he had to change something as Jos Buttler was batting brilliantly, he is on top of his game right now. Adds that Pandya had a superb game and they love the energy he brings to the team. Tells that there is a lot of experience including Rashid who gives so much to the team. Sanju Samson, the skipper of Rajasthan, says Gujarat's batsmen played really well, and even though they were there with run-rate but the wickets fall at the regular time. On Boult, he says he will be back soon. Tells that he knows the momentum matters a lot and he knows how hard this league is. Informs there is a lot of thought process regarding the batting line up. He was batting at 3 but felt he should come lower down and be flexible. It was never going to be easy to chase down a target of over 190 runs against a strong bowling attack. But the way they started the innings it felt like we were in for an exciting chase! Jos Buttler started firing from the word go. He brought up his 50 in just 23 balls and guided Rajasthan to a total of 65 at the end of the Powerplay! However, they lost three wickets within the Powerplay, which included the wicket of Jos Buttler and that was the turning point of the game. From there onwards, runs had dried up and wickets started to tumble as well. No other batter other than Jos found their mojo in the middle and as a result, they failed to chase down the target. A comfortable and convincing victory for Gujarat at the end! After losing their previous game, they have done well to get over the line here, and with this victory, they move to the top of the points table. While Rajasthan have been handed their second defeat of this tournament. Stay tuned for the presentation... Gujarat did not get off to a great start. As all the bowlers were taken to the cleaners by Jos Buttler. However, they fought back well. Lockie Ferguson came into the attack and grabbed two vital wickets in one over and that probably shifted the momentum towards them. They did well to capitalize on the same and made sure to take wickets at regular intervals and not to leak too many runs. Yash Dayal the debutant might have been expensive in his first two overs, but he held his nerve and grabbed 3 wickets by the end of his spell. It's been a complete performance from them at the end. 19.6 overs (0 Run) NOT OUT! Short and on middle. Sen pulls it without much control and the keeper celebrates as he collects it. Dayal wants to take the review and Rashid Khan, the stand-in skipper takes it. UltraEdge shows nothing on it. Gujarat win by 37 runs. Review! Gujarat have reviewed a caught behind decision! UltraEdge shows no bat involved and the on-field decision stands. 19.5 overs (0 Run) Full, slower and outside off. Sen swings again and he fails to get any bat on it. 19.4 overs (0 Run) Length and outside off. Sen looks to go downtown but misses it. Kuldeep Sen is the last man in. 19.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Dayal gets his third wicket on his debut! A length ball, on middle, was a slower delivery.

Vijay Shankar will complete the over. 17.3 overs (1 Run) Short and on middle. Chahal looks to pull but gets a top edge and it evades the short mid-wicket fielder easily. Would have taken it if the fielder was stationed on the ring. He was well inside. A single taken. Yuzvendra Chahal comes to the crease. 17.2 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT AND BOWLED! That should be the game for Gujarat! Full ball, on middle. Neesham swings across but only gets a top edge here. The ball goes high in the air and to Pandya who moves across slightly to covers and takes it. 17.1 overs (2 Runs) Full ball, on middle. Neesham steps across and tucks it to square leg for a brace.

Parag quickly asks for a no ball but the replay shows it was well below the waist and Parag has to walk back to the pavilion. 15.5 overs (0 Run) A yorker now, on off. Parag can only squeeze it back to the bowler. 15.4 overs (1 Run) Comes around the wicket and angles it on middle. Neesham tucks it behind square on the leg side for a single. 15.3 overs (1 Run) A low full toss, on off. Pushed to mid off for a quick single. 15.2 overs (0 Run) Short of a length and just outside off. Parag makes room and looks to cut but misses. 15.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Just what Rajasthan needed! Fabulous shot from Parag! A length ball, on middle. Parag stays back and flicks it superbly over mid-wicket for a biggie. Proper timing.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637855757893290726.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals vs Gujarat Titans Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/rajasthan-royals-vs-gujarat-titans-live-score-over-match-24-t20-11-15-updates-2889433","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Rajasthan Royals vs Gujarat Titans from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

Pandya at mid off, scores a direct-hit at the bowler's end and the replay shows Samson was well short of his crease. Run-out chance! A direct-hit at the bowler's end! The replay shows that Sanju Samson is well short of his ground! He has to walk back. 7.2 overs (0 Run) Hits the deck hard and keeps it on a length, on off. Samson hangs back and drops it to cover. 7.1 overs (0 Run) Full and on off, pushed to covers. 6.6 overs (1 Run) This one skids through the surface, on off. Samson pushes it to long on for a run. 119 runs needed in 78 balls. 6.5 overs (0 Run) Flatter and on off. Samson chops it to pont. 6.4 overs (0 Run) Fuller ball, slower through the air and on off, Kept out. 6.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Into the stands! Too full and drifting on the pads.

Couldn't time it much better than this. 6.2 overs (1 Run) Flatter at 90.9 kph, slanting on middle. van der Dussen works it to square leg for a single. 6.1 overs (1 Run) Shorter, slower and angling on middle. Samson eases it to long on for a single. DRINKS! Phew! What a Powerplay this has been! Rajasthan have got off to a flier with 65 runs on the board. But Gujarat have fought back with 3 wickets, which includes the big wicket of Jos Buttler! It's the over of Lockie Ferguson that has turned the game around now. There are now two new batters at the crease and Gujarat will be looking to keep things quiet from here. Rassie van der Dussen comes to bat now. Also, Rahul Tewatia comes into the attack. 5.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! BOWLED! Lockie Ferguson gets the big wicket of Jos Buttler and he is pumped up! A yorker delivery from Ferguson, on the slower side and right on the money, on middle. Buttler is deceived by the lack of pace and fails to get his bat down. The ball sneaks under his bat and rattles the stumps. What an innings from Buttler. He gives the start Rajasthan wanted. 5.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Fifty for Jos Buttler in just 23 balls. What a superb innings this is from him. Innovation at its best! Pre-meditates a length ball, outside off.

Ashwin tries to get underneath the ball as he tries for a big booming drive. He hits it hard and low to cover where David Miller gets low and takes the catch out of thin air. The ball went in no time but Miller watched it all the way to take the catch.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637855712429304648.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, RR vs GT: His teammates should learn from him- Yuvraj hails Jos Buttler for his gentleman conduct","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ipl-2022-rr-vs-gt-his-teammates-should-learn-from-him-yuvraj-hails-jos-buttler-for-his-gentleman-conduct-1937610-2022-04-14?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RR vs GT: Cricket still a gentleman's game, says Yuvraj Singh showering praise on Jos Buttler","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-14 16:36:25","full_description":"Former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh heaped praise on England wicket-keeper batter Jos Buttler amid the ongoing match between Rajasthan Royals vs Gujarat Titans in IPL 2022. During the 12th over, when Jimmy Neesham was bowling to GT skipper Hardik Pandya, the latter pulled it away. As Jos pulled off a good slide to stop the ball, he touched the rope while trying to release the throw. It looked like a decent effort but Buttler sent a signal to the umpire to check. However, replays showed the Englishman touching the boundary when throwing it back, giving freebies to Gujarat. Buttler showed sportsmanship when he signalled the umpire that his legs may be touching the boundary ropes after an excellent fielding effort in the clash vs Gujarat Titans. Singh appreciated a decent effort from Buttler as he was trying to save a boundary, but he was not sure whether he came in touch with the boundary rope while saving the ball as GT skipper Hardik Pandya missed a glance. The fact that Buttler asked for a third umpire referral without a false claim captured the attention of Yuvraj Singh. Singh wrote on Twitter, \"We still have gentleman in the game of cricket !!! @josbuttler other players should learn from him specially team mates !!! #IPL2022 #RRvGT.\" (sic) We still have gentleman in the game of cricket !!! @josbuttler other players should learn from him specially team mates !!! #IPL2022 #RRvGT — Yuvraj Singh (@YUVSTRONG12) April 14, 2022 As soon as Singh praised the effort of Buttler, many people highlighted the last line of his tweet which says that Buttler's teammates should learn from him.

During the 24th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Gujarat Titans (GT) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) at Dr DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, GT skipper Hardik Pandya played a gem of a captain’s knock to smash back-to-back half-centuries for the first time ever in his IPL career. Having lost Matthew Wade (12 off 6) and Vijay Shankar (2 off 7) within the first three Overs of the match, Pandya came in to bat at a pressure situation with his team uncharacteristically needing him to spend some time at the crease.

Joined by another batting sensation in Abhinav Manohar (43 off 28), Pandya, while smashing his second consecutive fifty in the ongoing season off mere 33 deliveries, stitched a crucial 86-run partnership off mere 55 deliveries with the former for the 4th wicket, to set his side for a power finish during the death Overs. Yuvraj Singh hails Hardik Pandya’s knock Despite a scratchy season so far, David Miller (31* off 14) then played a scintillating cameo in the end to provide a much needed booster to the GT score which ultimately posted 192/4 in their 20 Overs.

To say farewell, let’s hand out awards for the best, weirdest, and most magical moments produced by pitchers stepping up to the plate. Baseball has become slightly more efficient and significantly less weird. Both the American and National leagues now use the designated hitter, meaning that teams are no longer required to let their pitchers hit. They can still let pitchers hit, if they have a pitcher good enough to outperform a DH, but this essentially applies to only Shohei Ohtani. With the rule changes implemented in the new CBA, the days of pitchers ending rallies with subpar swings are officially over. Having pitchers hit was a holdover from baseball’s predecessor, cricket, in which bowlers still have to bat to this day. But pitchers were not good at hitting, nor have they ever been: As The Ringer’s Ben Lindbergh detailed in 2018, complaints about pitchers hitting date back to the 1890s, and the American League adopted the designated hitter in 1973. It’s ludicrous in retrospect: For almost 50 years, half of MLB’s teams played by one set of rules and the other half played by another. The advent of the universal DH has seemed likely for a while, but became imminent in 2020, when both leagues used the DH as part of that season’s COVID-altered schedule that included a sizable uptick in interleague play. Baseball still felt like baseball even though National League pitchers were hitting, and while many aspects of the 2022 lockout were contentious, both MLB and the MLBPA seemed happy to agree on cementing the universal DH as part of the league’s playing rules for good. The logic behind the move is unassailable. As baseball has gotten more specialized, pitchers have gotten even worse at hitting. In 2021, MLB pitchers combined to hit .110, an all-time-low mark. Every other offensive position had a collective OPS somewhere between .792 (first basemen) and .697 (catchers); pitchers were all the way down at .293. Even the best-hitting pitchers are far worse at hitting than the worst-hitting hitters. And the knock-on effects of eliminating pitcher at-bats benefit everybody: Pitchers will no longer get hurt attempting tasks they don’t train for; the World Series will no longer feature teams from both leagues tweaking their lineups to fit the other league’s rules in the most important games of the season. The league has even engineered an Ohtani rule so that pitchers who do hit can stay in the game after their pitching is done, which actually makes the prospect of genuine two-way players more feasible than in the decades when pitchers were mandated to hit. You’d think that the few decent-hitting NL pitchers who aren’t quite good enough to outperform a DH would be upset by this change, but, well, even they’re on board with it. The game will be better and make more sense without pitchers hitting—but it still feels as if something has been lost. There was something magical about the rare breakthroughs when a pitcher managed to succeed at the plate, even though it wasn’t his main job. Baseball treasures oddities and quirks, and over the years pitchers hitting provided one-off moments that were strange and unforgettable. As we bid farewell to MLB’s era of pitcher hitting, I’m handing out awards for the greatest pitcher hitting feats in recent memory. I’m focusing specifically on the seasons since 1973, when the DH was introduced in the AL. Hardest Crushed Pitcher Dinger(s): Madison Bumgarner No pitcher hit the ball harder than MadBum. He has the second most career home runs of any full-time MLB pitcher of the past 50 years, behind only Carlos Zambrano. And thanks to StatCast we can truly appreciate the power of his blasts. If we take out Ohtani, Bumgarner has four of the nine hardest-hit home runs by a pitcher, and three of the top four. He’s also responsible for the two hardest-hit home runs by a pitcher, which both came on Opening Day of the 2017 season against the Diamondbacks: These two homers left Bumgarner’s bat at 112.5 and 112.1 miles per hour, respectively. No other pitcher besides Ohtani has ever had an exit velocity above 110 miles per hour. However, the longest home run hit by a pitcher in the StatCast era came not from Bumgarner, but from Rockies pitcher Jon Gray. He smacked a 467-footer in 2017, a rare win for pitchers in the mile-high air of Coors Field. Clutchest Pitcher Hit: Kerry Wood There isn’t a lot to choose from in this category, since managers typically sub out pitchers for pinch-hitters in high-leverage situations. There hasn’t been a walk-off home run by a starting pitcher since before the American League DH rule went into effect (although Padres reliever Craig Lefferts hit one in 1986). Only two pitchers have hit World Series homers since 1973, Ken Holtzman in 1974 and Joe Blanton in 2008. Even great-hitting pitchers are easy outs when their opponents are dialed in—Bumgarner might have crushed homers on Opening Day, but he’s 0-for-27 lifetime in the playoffs. So I’m giving the nod to Kerry Wood for his home run to tie Game 7 of the 2003 NLCS at Wrigley Field: The 2003 postseason was an all-timer for pitcher hitting. The Marlins had Dontrelle Willis, who went 3-for-3 at the plate in the NLDS. That team went on to win the World Series thanks to one of the biggest pitcher hits of all time—a two-run single by Brad Penny to break open Game 5 against the Yankees. That was the second-biggest Marlins hit of the series, according to Baseball-Reference’s championship win probability added. And the Cubs won Game 1 of the NLDS after Wood hit a two-run go-ahead double against the Braves. And then Wood hit a game-tying home run in Game 7 of the NLCS, one of the most memorable playoff series of all time—though it wasn’t memorable for good reasons for the Cubs. They ended up losing after Wood’s pitching gave back the lead he earned with his bat. Career Achievement Award: Carlos Zambrano This award comes down to two pitchers: Zambrano and Mike Hampton, who were both known for their impressive abilities at the plate. Hampton, at 5-foot-10 and 195 pounds, looked like a second baseman and hit like one too. He didn’t hit any homers in his first eight MLB seasons, but his power surged when he joined the Rockies. He smacked seven homers in 2001, the most by a full-time pitcher in one season in the modern era. At one point, Hampton hit dingers in three straight at-bats: But I’m not giving Hampton this award. He’ll have to console himself with the actual awards he won for hitting, including five Silver Slugger awards, the most of any pitcher. (RIP to the Silver Slugger for pitchers, long MLB’s funniest award.) I’m giving the nod to Zambrano, a rare switch-hitting pitcher who was regularly used as a pinch-hitter. At 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds, Big Z was a legit slugger, and he has a hitting highlight reel: Since the AL introduced the DH in 1973, Zambrano has the most homers by a pitcher (24), and he holds the all-time league records for the longest hitting streak by a pitcher (13 games) and the most consecutive games with an RBI (eight). Only 18 pitchers have hit at least nine home runs since 1973; Zambrano hit 15 as a lefty and nine as a righty. He was also really great at pitching, and really great at getting suspended by the Cubs for getting angry at people—a true triple threat. But his ability to crush baseballs stands out the most. Worst Hitting Pitcher: James Paxton There are a lot of ways we could go with this one. Since 1973, 69 pitchers have amassed at least 10 plate appearances without reaching base once, finishing their careers with an on-base percentage of .000. The leader of the pack is Eduardo Rodríguez, who has been to the plate 29 times and come up empty in every one. And that list doesn’t even include Randy Tate, who went 0-for-41 on the 1975 Mets but did manage to reach base exactly one time, finishing his career with a sterling .024 OBP. But I’m going to give the honor to the Big Maple, James Paxton. Here he is trying (and failing) to hit a breaking ball from Hyun-Jin Ryu in 2019. That’s one of Paxton’s 12 career strikeouts, which is notable because Paxton has 12 career at-bats. Outside of four sacrifice bunts, he’s never put a ball into play. His BABIP does not exist; his K rate is 100 percent. Nobody has ever done worse—nobody could do worse, not even me or you. The worst we could do is exactly as badly as James Paxton. Greatest Pitcher Hitting Moment, AL Edition: Félix Hernández American League pitchers have long been worse at hitting than National League pitchers. This makes sense: For the past half-century, NL starters prepared to take swings every week, while AL pitchers didn’t have to hit at all from 1973 to 1997, when interleague play began. In 2019, NL pitchers hit a combined .131 with 25 home runs in 4,201 at-bats—that’s one homer every 168 at-bats, pretty bad! But AL pitchers were considerably worse, batting .087 with just one extra-base hit in 289 at-bats. Over the 48 World Series in which the AL used a DH and the NL didn’t, AL pitchers got exactly 27 hits, and eight of those (almost 30 percent!) came before 1976, when hitting presumably still felt like a regular task to AL pitchers. In the nearly five-decade span when the AL had a DH and the NL did not, AL pitchers hit exactly one grand slam: this opposite-field blast by Félix Hernández that provided almost all the run support in a 5-2 Mariners win over the Mets. It was his only at-bat of the 2008 season: The odds of this happening were outrageously low. For one, the home run came against Johan Santana, a two-time Cy Young award winner who led the majors in ERA in 2008. In his career, Santana allowed only two homers to pitchers: this one and one to Hampton, who we’ve just established as a Pitcher Hitting God. King Felix, on the other hand, had just four hits in 50 career at-bats. Hernández spent his entire career with the Mariners, so this was his only career home run. This was one of the best pitchers in the game facing one of the worst hitters in the majors. And Hernández went oppo for a grand slam. Most Effective Pitcher Hitting Strategy: Santiago Casilla Santiago Casilla entered the majors in 2004, but didn’t make a plate appearance until August 2011, as the Giants tried to close out a win over the Marlins. After all, Casilla was a reliever, and had spent most of his career to that point in the AL. When he stepped to the plate in this game, he wanted to complete his at-bat as quickly as possible. He had pitched in the eighth inning and was batting so that he could stay in the game for the ninth. There were two outs, the Giants were leading comfortably, and this game was being played in South Florida in August. It was probably 94 degrees with 94 percent humidity. Everybody wanted this to be over ASAP. When Casilla dug in against Marlins reliever José Ceda, he stood as far from the plate as he possibly could. If he’d taken a swing, his outstretched bat might have reached the inner half of the plate. But clearly, he was not going to swing. It should have been the easiest strikeout in MLB history. Instead, Ceda threw four straight balls. It was the only walk of Casilla’s 15-year MLB career. This at-bat has become a beloved part of weird baseball lore, and the subject of a Jon Bois video. I truly believe that Casilla’s unusual choice of positioning led to the walk, throwing off the pitcher’s perception of the plate. Unfortunately, Casilla did not stick to this strategy for the rest of his career. In 2014, Casilla once again came to the plate in the ninth inning of a game that the Giants were leading. This time, he swung and made contact. He grounded the ball to the shortstop, requiring him to run out the play—and he sprained his hamstring tripping over first base, forcing him to miss a month of action. Trying is overrated. Greatest Pitcher Base-Running Performance: Koo Dae-Sung Tragically, we have probably seen the last instance of a pitcher reaching base and being presented with a jacket to wear on the basepaths. I loved the jacket. It was clearly not aerodynamic, which is why no other players wear it when they reach base. But while other runners were primarily trying to score, pitchers were mainly concerned with keeping their arm muscles warm until they were relieved of their running duties. The jacket was a bright, zippered reminder that something unusual was happening. It was surprising that Koo Dae-Sung ever got to wear a jacket on the bases. The 35-year-old pitcher came to the Mets in 2005 after playing 12 seasons in Korea and Japan. During those stints, he never made a plate appearance. (Pitchers still have to hit in Japan’s Central League; Koo played with the Orix Buffaloes in the Pacific League.) In his first at-bat with the Mets, Koo stood a Casilla-esque length away from home plate and refused to swing, a performance that The New York Times described as “anti-batting.” In his second at-bat, he faced five-time Cy Young award winner Randy Johnson. In the dugout, Mets catcher Mike Piazza joked that he’d donate a million dollars to charity if Koo got a hit; on the broadcast, announcer Tim McCarver predicted Koo would take “the biggest give-up at-bat of the season.” Instead, he laced a double into center field. But the biggest surprise came directly after that. The next hitter, José Reyes, laid down a sacrifice bunt. Koo took third, and the Yankees, not expecting much from him, assumed that the play was over. They forgot to cover the plate. Koo sprinted home and dove head-first, beating catcher Jorge Posada. It was the only run of Koo’s 23-year professional career. (It is also the subject of a Jon Bois video.) Everybody underestimated Koo here: his teammates, who joked about his upcoming plate appearance; the announcers, who assumed he wouldn’t swing; Johnson, who grooved a pitch where Koo could put his barrel on it; and the Yankees, who assumed that he wouldn’t try to make a play at the plate. Even the very concept of the pitcher jacket was an underestimation of what Koo would do: It signaled he was concerned with keeping his arm warm, when in fact he was willing to risk everything to score a run. Greatest Single-Game Pitching-Hitting Combo: Noah Syndergaard There are many examples of spectacular all-around performances, in which pitchers dominated on the mound and also contributed at the plate. The all-time greatest is probably the 1971 outing in which Phillies pitcher Rick Wise threw a no-hitter and hit two home runs—but that falls outside of our cutoff date for these awards. In Matt Cain’s 2012 perfect game, the most recent by an NL pitcher, Cain hit a single and came around to score, outdoing the entire opposing team. But I’m giving the nod to Syndergaard. Thanks to the Mets’ long, storied tradition of not providing run support for their pitchers, Thor single-handedly won two games through his pitching and his hitting. In 2019, Syndergaard threw a complete-game shutout against the Reds and scored the Mets’ only run by hitting a solo homer. It’s the last of 31 games since 1973 in which a pitcher threw a complete-game shutout and went deep. In all but one of those games, another player besides the pitcher had an RBI. But that’s not all! In 2016, Syndergaard pitched eight innings against the Dodgers while also hitting two home runs and driving in all four runs in the Mets’ 4-3 win. It’s one of just 14 games since 1973 in which a pitcher has hit two homers. In all but one of those games, at least one other player besides the pitcher had an RBI. It was always magnificent when a pitcher not only dominated on the mound, but also outhit his eight teammates who are paid to provide offense. This didn’t happen very often, and felt impossible when it did. Thank the Mets hitters for making it possible, again and again. The Single Greatest Moment in Pitcher Hitting History Folks, it’s what you came for. You know what it is. Roll the clip: After signing with the Mets in 2014, Bartolo Colón quickly established himself as one of the worst hitters in baseball. Colón was 41 years old at the time, nearly a decade removed from his Cy Young–winning season with the Angels in 2005. He had spent almost his entire 18-year MLB career in the AL, save a few months with the Expos in 2002. By this point, however, the Expos hadn’t existed for more than a decade. And it’s worth noting that Colón’s body changed noticeably over his two decades in the sport. Here is young Bartolo with Cleveland in the 1990s; here is old Bartolo, jiggling his belly with the Mets. He did not look like an athlete—he looked like a pitcher. And he certainly did not look like a hitter. Colón didn’t swing the bat so much as he flailed. He began his Mets career 0-for-26 with 17 strikeouts. His ill-fitting batting helmet repeatedly fell off his smooth, round head after hopeless hacks. (In Colón’s memoir, Big Sexy, he says he asked the Mets equipment manager for an especially large helmet “so I could make the fans laugh some more.”) But on one beautiful day in 2016, after two years of swinging and missing, he connected on a pitch from Padres pitcher James Shields. As it turned out, Colón’s swing had always been all power and no grace. All he needed was to connect one time. “THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS HAPPENED,” Mets announcer Gary Cohen shouted as Colón took his lengthy and triumphant loop around the bases. “THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT MOMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF BASEBALL!” Colón attempting to hit was somewhat of a mockery of professional sports: He wasn’t built for hitting baseballs. He wasn’t skilled at hitting baseballs. He did not train to become better at hitting baseballs. And for years, he did not succeed at hitting baseballs. But with one perfect swing, he did the best possible thing any hitter can do. It was the pinnacle of pitchers hitting—a concept beloved not because it led to regular success, but because of those once-in-a-Bartolo moments that stand out in our memories. The average MLB game will be more exciting and interesting without pitchers hitting, but the sport has lost the potential for these exceedingly rare and delightful breakthroughs. It probably doesn’t make much sense to mandate the presence of subpar play because the rare good outcomes are so fun. But what is baseball if not a sport in which we sit around for hours, weeks, months, or years hoping to witness one amazing thing?","pubDate":"2022-04-14 15:50:09","full_description":"Baseball has become slightly more efficient and significantly less weird. Both the American and National leagues now use the designated hitter, meaning that teams are no longer required to let their pitchers hit. They can still let pitchers hit, if they have a pitcher good enough to outperform a DH, but this essentially applies to only Shohei Ohtani. With the rule changes implemented in the new CBA, the days of pitchers ending rallies with subpar swings are officially over. Having pitchers hit was a holdover from baseball’s predecessor, cricket, in which bowlers still have to bat to this day. But pitchers were not good at hitting, nor have they ever been: As The Ringer ’s Ben Lindbergh detailed in 2018 , complaints about pitchers hitting date back to the 1890s, and the American League adopted the designated hitter in 1973. It’s ludicrous in retrospect: For almost 50 years, half of MLB’s teams played by one set of rules and the other half played by another. The advent of the universal DH has seemed likely for a while, but became imminent in 2020, when both leagues used the DH as part of that season’s COVID-altered schedule that included a sizable uptick in interleague play. Baseball still felt like baseball even though National League pitchers were hitting, and while many aspects of the 2022 lockout were contentious, both MLB and the MLBPA seemed happy to agree on cementing the universal DH as part of the league’s playing rules for good. The logic behind the move is unassailable. As baseball has gotten more specialized, pitchers have gotten even worse at hitting. In 2021, MLB pitchers combined to hit .110 , an all-time-low mark. Every other offensive position had a collective OPS somewhere between .792 (first basemen) and .697 (catchers); pitchers were all the way down at .293. Even the best-hitting pitchers are far worse at hitting than the worst-hitting hitters . And the knock-on effects of eliminating pitcher at-bats benefit everybody: Pitchers will no longer get hurt attempting tasks they don’t train for ; the World Series will no longer feature teams from both leagues tweaking their lineups to fit the other league’s rules in the most important games of the season. The league has even engineered an Ohtani rule so that pitchers who do hit can stay in the game after their pitching is done , which actually makes the prospect of genuine two-way players more feasible than in the decades when pitchers were mandated to hit. You’d think that the few decent-hitting NL pitchers who aren’t quite good enough to outperform a DH would be upset by this change, but, well, even they’re on board with it . The game will be better and make more sense without pitchers hitting—but it still feels as if something has been lost. There was something magical about the rare breakthroughs when a pitcher managed to succeed at the plate, even though it wasn’t his main job. Baseball treasures oddities and quirks, and over the years pitchers hitting provided one-off moments that were strange and unforgettable. As we bid farewell to MLB’s era of pitcher hitting, I’m handing out awards for the greatest pitcher hitting feats in recent memory. I’m focusing specifically on the seasons since 1973, when the DH was introduced in the AL. No pitcher hit the ball harder than MadBum. He has the second most career home runs of any full-time MLB pitcher of the past 50 years, behind only Carlos Zambrano. And thanks to StatCast we can truly appreciate the power of his blasts. If we take out Ohtani, Bumgarner has four of the nine hardest-hit home runs by a pitcher , and three of the top four. He’s also responsible for the two hardest-hit home runs by a pitcher, which both came on Opening Day of the 2017 season against the Diamondbacks: These two homers left Bumgarner’s bat at 112.5 and 112.1 miles per hour, respectively. No other pitcher besides Ohtani has ever had an exit velocity above 110 miles per hour. However, the longest home run hit by a pitcher in the StatCast era came not from Bumgarner, but from Rockies pitcher Jon Gray. He smacked a 467-footer in 2017 , a rare win for pitchers in the mile-high air of Coors Field. There isn’t a lot to choose from in this category, since managers typically sub out pitchers for pinch-hitters in high-leverage situations. There hasn’t been a walk-off home run by a starting pitcher since before the American League DH rule went into effect (although Padres reliever Craig Lefferts hit one in 1986 ). Only two pitchers have hit World Series homers since 1973, Ken Holtzman in 1974 and Joe Blanton in 2008 . Even great-hitting pitchers are easy outs when their opponents are dialed in—Bumgarner might have crushed homers on Opening Day, but he’s 0-for-27 lifetime in the playoffs. So I’m giving the nod to Kerry Wood for his home run to tie Game 7 of the 2003 NLCS at Wrigley Field: The 2003 postseason was an all-timer for pitcher hitting. The Marlins had Dontrelle Willis, who went 3-for-3 at the plate in the NLDS. That team went on to win the World Series thanks to one of the biggest pitcher hits of all time—a two-run single by Brad Penny to break open Game 5 against the Yankees. That was the second-biggest Marlins hit of the series, according to Baseball-Reference’s championship win probability added . And the Cubs won Game 1 of the NLDS after Wood hit a two-run go-ahead double against the Braves. And then Wood hit a game-tying home run in Game 7 of the NLCS, one of the most memorable playoff series of all time—though it wasn’t memorable for good reasons for the Cubs. They ended up losing after Wood’s pitching gave back the lead he earned with his bat. This award comes down to two pitchers: Zambrano and Mike Hampton, who were both known for their impressive abilities at the plate. Hampton, at 5-foot-10 and 195 pounds, looked like a second baseman and hit like one too. He didn’t hit any homers in his first eight MLB seasons, but his power surged when he joined the Rockies. He smacked seven homers in 2001, the most by a full-time pitcher in one season in the modern era. At one point, Hampton hit dingers in three straight at-bats: But I’m not giving Hampton this award. He’ll have to console himself with the actual awards he won for hitting, including five Silver Slugger awards, the most of any pitcher. (RIP to the Silver Slugger for pitchers, long MLB’s funniest award.) I’m giving the nod to Zambrano, a rare switch-hitting pitcher who was regularly used as a pinch-hitter. At 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds, Big Z was a legit slugger, and he has a hitting highlight reel: Since the AL introduced the DH in 1973, Zambrano has the most homers by a pitcher (24), and he holds the all-time league records for the longest hitting streak by a pitcher (13 games) and the most consecutive games with an RBI (eight). Only 18 pitchers have hit at least nine home runs since 1973; Zambrano hit 15 as a lefty and nine as a righty. He was also really great at pitching, and really great at getting suspended by the Cubs for getting angry at people—a true triple threat. But his ability to crush baseballs stands out the most. There are a lot of ways we could go with this one. Since 1973, 69 pitchers have amassed at least 10 plate appearances without reaching base once, finishing their careers with an on-base percentage of .000. The leader of the pack is Eduardo Rodríguez, who has been to the plate 29 times and come up empty in every one. And that list doesn’t even include Randy Tate, who went 0-for-41 on the 1975 Mets but did manage to reach base exactly one time, finishing his career with a sterling .024 OBP. But I’m going to give the honor to the Big Maple, James Paxton. Here he is trying (and failing) to hit a breaking ball from Hyun-Jin Ryu in 2019. That’s one of Paxton’s 12 career strikeouts, which is notable because Paxton has 12 career at-bats. Outside of four sacrifice bunts, he’s never put a ball into play. His BABIP does not exist; his K rate is 100 percent. Nobody has ever done worse—nobody could do worse, not even me or you. The worst we could do is exactly as badly as James Paxton. American League pitchers have long been worse at hitting than National League pitchers. This makes sense: For the past half-century, NL starters prepared to take swings every week, while AL pitchers didn’t have to hit at all from 1973 to 1997, when interleague play began. In 2019, NL pitchers hit a combined .131 with 25 home runs in 4,201 at-bats—that’s one homer every 168 at-bats, pretty bad! But AL pitchers were considerably worse, batting .087 with just one extra-base hit in 289 at-bats. Over the 48 World Series in which the AL used a DH and the NL didn’t, AL pitchers got exactly 27 hits , and eight of those (almost 30 percent!) came before 1976, when hitting presumably still felt like a regular task to AL pitchers. In the nearly five-decade span when the AL had a DH and the NL did not, AL pitchers hit exactly one grand slam: this opposite-field blast by Félix Hernández that provided almost all the run support in a 5-2 Mariners win over the Mets. It was his only at-bat of the 2008 season: The odds of this happening were outrageously low. For one, the home run came against Johan Santana, a two-time Cy Young award winner who led the majors in ERA in 2008. In his career, Santana allowed only two homers to pitchers: this one and one to Hampton, who we’ve just established as a Pitcher Hitting God. King Felix, on the other hand, had just four hits in 50 career at-bats. Hernández spent his entire career with the Mariners, so this was his only career home run. This was one of the best pitchers in the game facing one of the worst hitters in the majors. And Hernández went oppo for a grand slam. Santiago Casilla entered the majors in 2004, but didn’t make a plate appearance until August 2011, as the Giants tried to close out a win over the Marlins.

Samson tried some different things today by bringing Ashwin a bit too late. He might have thought to keep his spin wizards away from Pandya but both, Chahal and Ashwin showed their experience and had a decent game. Kuldeep Sen got a wicket but he was not on top of his game. Rajasthan didn't miss Boult with a good powerplay but definitely missed him on the back end. They conceded a bit too much in the fag end and they will hope, it does not hurt them. Gujarat did not had the best of Powerplay as they lost two wickets. Pandya and Gill started the repair work but the latter fell and then it was Manohar who played yet another fine innings for his team. He and Pandya stitched an 86-run partnership to stay on top in the middle phase. Manohar fell but Pandya was still out there and with Miller, Gujarat made sure to give the finishing touches. A partnership of 53-runs in just 25 balls and Pandya and Miller have done really well to cross the 190-run mark. They will back themselves to defend this. 47 runs in the last three overs. Killer Miller and Pandya's power have given the much required finishing touches to the innings and now Pandya will back his bowling group to defend this down. A solid batting performance from Hardik Pandya who is enjoying his new role to come and bat early on rather than his old finishing game. 19.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Streaky boundary! Another low full toss, outside off. Hardik Pandya swings his bat it and the ball goes off the outside edge away from the keeper towards third man for a boundary. Gujarat end at 192 for 4! 19.5 overs (1 Run) A full toss, on middle. David Miller knocks it towards long on for a single. 19.4 overs (0 Run) Swing and a miss! Length delivery, outside off. David Miller stays in his crease and looks to go over cover but he misses. 19.3 overs (1 Run) Yorker-length delivery, outside off. Hardik Pandya tries to squeeze this one, but he manages to get an inside edge towards square leg for a single. 19.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! WOW! Wonderful shot by Hardik Pandya! A low full toss, wide off. Hardik Pandya reaches out to that, and slices it over point for a biggie! 19.1 overs (0 Run) On a length, wide of off again. Hardik Pandya looks to slash this away but he misses. No wide called this time! 19.1 overs (1 Run) Wide! Full-length delivery, wide of off. Hardik Pandya leaves it alone.

Both were named in the Sussex playing eleven which is captained by Tom Daines. With Derbyshire opting to bat, Pujara and Rizwan are expected to bat on day two. Both the players stand at the opposite end of their international careers. While Pujara will be aiming to score a bagful of runs to make a Test comeback after being dropped following the tour of South Africa, Rizwan has been one of the best wicket-keeper batters in international cricket over the last couple of years. With Sussex having lost their opening game, head coach Ian Salisbury included both overseas stars for the contest against Derbyshire. \"I am extremely excited to be able to bring in players of Rizwan and Pujara's quality into the side. Not only are they absolute world-class cricketers that will boost our performances on the pitch, but to have them around the boys and in the dressing room can only be a positive,\" said the head coach in a team statement.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals vs Gujarat Titans Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/rajasthan-royals-vs-gujarat-titans-live-score-over-match-24-t20-6-10-updates-2888919","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Rajasthan Royals vs Gujarat Titans from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

Rajasthan Royals are up against Gujarat Titans in their next league game of the IPL 2022. Both teams have won three of their four games in the tournament, and this is an important game for both sides. Sanju Samson informed that Trent Boult will miss this game due to a niggle, and this is a massive shock for the Royals. Gujarat Titans have also made two changes to their line-up. Yash Dayal is making his debut, whereas Vijay Shankar also returns to playing 11. Sai Sudarshan and Darshan Nalkande are dropped from the eleven. What happened to Trent Boult? Sanju Samson at the toss informed that Trent Boult will miss the game against Gujarat Titans due to a niggle. Fellow New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham has replaced Trent Boult in the Rajasthan Royals lineup against Gujarat. “Yesterday, Trent Boult had a small niggle and isn’t available for today’s game. Jimmy Neesham is replacing him,” Sanju Samson said at the toss. Trent Boult has been an important cog in the bowling of the Rajasthan Royals. He has scalped 7 wickets in 4 games at an average of 16.57. After IPL 2020, Trent Boult has taken the most wickets in the first over of an innings. Boult bowled an incredible spell in the last game against Lucknow Super Giants as well. Niggle meaning in cricket Niggle means a light injury that may cause discomfort in some movements. It is a small injury, but playing with a niggle increases the risk of a player getting seriously injured. A niggle to a player won’t allow him/her to play at this full potential. Generally, niggles are healed in a few days of rest. The level of discomfort to a player varies from player to player and body part to body part. The parts like the back and knee take longer to recover. The post Niggle meaning in cricket: What happened to Trent Boult?

Fellow New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham has replaced Trent Boult in the Rajasthan Royals lineup against Gujarat. “Yesterday, Trent Boult had a small niggle and isn’t available for today’s game. Jimmy Neesham is replacing him,” Sanju Samson said at the toss. Boulty misses tonight’s game with a niggle, but we have a debut in Pink for Jimmy Neesham! Time to #HallaBol . 💗 #RoyalsFamily | #RRvGT | @Dream11 pic.twitter.com/IYefEps08H — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 14, 2022 Trent Boult has been an important cog in the bowling of the Rajasthan Royals. He has scalped 7 wickets in 4 games at an average of 16.57. After IPL 2020, Trent Boult has taken the most wickets in the first over of an innings. Boult bowled an incredible spell in the last game against Lucknow Super Giants as well. Niggle means a light injury that may cause discomfort in some movements. It is a small injury, but playing with a niggle increases the risk of a player getting seriously injured. A niggle to a player won’t allow him/her to play at this full potential. Generally, niggles are healed in a few days of rest. The level of discomfort to a player varies from player to player and body part to body part. The parts like the back and knee take longer to recover.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shane Watson picks his favorite cricketer among Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, Kane Williamson and Babar Azam","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/shane-watson-picks-his-favorite-cricketer-among-virat-kohli-steve-smith-kane-williamson-and-babar-azam-2022-04-14-769795","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson has picked Virat Kohli as the best batter among the 'big five' in Test cricket, preferring to not read much into the Indian maestro's failure to score a hundred since November 2019.

As per Watson's list, the former India captain has pipped the likes of , , , and . \"In Test match cricket, I am always going to say, Virat Kohli,\" Watson said when asked by Isa Guha who he thought is the best Test batter in the world, in his latest episode of the ICC Review. \"It's nearly superhuman, what he is able to do because he has such high intensity every time he goes out to play,\" Watson added. While Kohli has slipped to 10th on the ICC rankings, the Indian great continues to hold a remarkable Test batting record. He has scored 27 Test centuries and 28 half-centuries and currently has a Test batting average of just under 50. The world's current No.1 Test batter Marnus Labuschagne, who has played 26 Test matches and averages 54.31, would have increased the 'big 'five' to a 'big six', but was left out of the debate for this topic due to a 40-Test minimum criteria, the ICC said in a report on its official website. Regarding Pakistan skipper Babar, who he has kept at number two, Watson noted, \"Babar Azam is playing incredibly well. \"(It's great) to be able to see how he has adapted his game to really move his game to Test cricket as well. \"Babar Azam would probably be No.2 at the moment.\" Babar is currently ranked the fifth-best batter in the world and appears to be on the rise if his recent performances against Australia are anything to go by. He stroked a superb 196 during the second Test in Karachi and finished the series with a total of 390 runs. About Watson's third-best batter Smith, he said the Australian star \"has just started to come off a little bit.\" \"It looks like Smith has really started to play for time a little bit more and is not putting as much pressure on the bowlers as he did when was at his absolute best. For me, Steve has dropped down that list a little bit.\" Smith is second on the ICC rankings, with only Australian team-mate Labuschagne ranked ahead of him. About Williamson, who Watson considers the world's fourth-best at the moment, the Australian said, \"Kane knows his game inside out and knows how to put pressure on bowlers in any conditions.\" While Williamson has played just two Test matches in the last 12 months, he remains ranked as the third-best batter. The Kiwi veteran has 24 Test centuries to his name and may still have plenty of cricket left in him if he can overcome his injury issues. Coming to his fifth-best batter Root, Watson said, \"Joe Root recently scored a hundred but he has had a bit of time along the lines of Steve Smith where he hasn't been able to nail the big scores like he has done in the past.\" \"It's incredible how these world-class batters just go through waves where instead of scoring those big hundreds, get the 70s-80s, but still have an impact on the game but are not able to really maintain that really high standard of getting those big runs as they have done in the past,\" Watson added.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Yash Dayal IPL auction 2022: Why is Sai Sudharsan not playing today’s IPL 2022 match between Rajasthan Royals and Gujarat Titans?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-yash-dayal-ipl-auction-2022-why-is-sai-sudharsan-not-playing-todays-ipl-2022-match-between-rajasthan-royals-and-gujarat-titans/","keywords":["Cricket","Gujarat Titans","IPL 2022","Rajasthan Royals","GT","Indian Premier League","rajasthan royals","RR","Sai Sudharsan","Vijay Shankar","Yash Dayal"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Why Sai Sudharsan not playing today: Gujarat Titans have made a couple of changes to their Playing XI for this match.

Wanting to follow a trend of chasing a total this season, Gujarat Titans captain Hardik Pandya revealed that he was looking to bowl first at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy tonight. Having said that, Pandya remained unperturbed about the prospect of batting first against the table-toppers. “We would have liked to bowl first as well but I wouldn’t mind batting first as well. It’s always good to get responsibility, I have always been a player who has enjoyed taking responsibilities, taking things on my shoulder. It helps me to get better as a cricketer and as a person as well. The boys are pretty chilled out, the supporting staff is nice,” Pandya told Star Sports at the toss. As far as the changes for them are concerned, Titans have brought back all-rounder Vijay Shankar into the XI in addition to handing a debut to fast bowler Yash Dayal. Batter Sai Sudharsan and pacer Darshan Nalkande have been left out for this match. Having scored 35 (30) and 11 (9) in his first two IPL matches, Sudharsan has been benched to accommodate Shankar, who had to miss a couple of matches due to an injury. The change confirms GT’s thought process of backing their first-choice players. Meanwhile, 24-year old Dayal plays for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket. Keenly interested for this left-arm fast bowler, Gujarat had bought him for a whopping INR 3.2 crore. Having registered himself for a base price of INR 20 lakh, Dayal had also allured interest from Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the mega auction earlier this year. In 15 T20s, Dayal has picked 15 wickets at an average of 22.13, an economy rate of 7.21 and a strike rate of 18.4.

Jos Buttler is up for a chat. He says that wearing the orange cap is a confidence booster early on in the tournament and he is very grateful for the cap and he is enjoying his season so far. Adds that opening is best for him in the T20 format and it suits his game and he gets the most number of balls to face. But every position in T20 is important and just because he faces most balls at opening does not make it an important position. Informs that he feels nice to score runs early on, but he has to play each game with a fresh mentality. Hardik Pandya, the captain of Gujarat says they would've bowled first as well but they don't mind much. Adds that he is enjoying the captaincy and so do the players and support staff, they are in a honeymoon phase and he hopes it continues further. Tells that if he misses with the bat, he can contribute with the ball. Mentions that they are brilliant in the bowling department and informs, there are two changes. Sanju Samson, the skipper of Rajasthan says that they are going to bowl first, they would like to use the conditions here today and bowl here. Informs that Boult has a niggle and he will miss the game tonight, and Neesham will replace him Gujarat (Playing XI) - Matthew Wade (WK), Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya (C), Vijay Shankar (In for Sai Sudharsan), David Miller, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Mohammad Shami, Lockie Ferguson, Yash Dayal (In for Darshan Nalkande). Rajasthan (Playing XI) - Jos Buttler, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (C/WK), Rassie van der Dussen, Shimron Hetmyer, James Neesham (In for Trent Boult), Ravichandran Ashwin, Riyan Parag, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Sen, Prasidh Krishna. TOSS - Rajasthan have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first! UPDATE - Yash Dayal has received his cap from Ashish Nehra. He is all set to make his debut tonight for Gujarat. PITCH REPORT - Matthew Hayden is near the pitch. He says that this pitch is not new and has been used before. This pitch is in the middle of the stadium and the dimensions are similar. Adds that the pitch is an absolute beauty, it has got a fair bit of grass around the hard lengths where the bowlers love to bowl at. Mentions that pitch is good, it's got true even pace, but the bowlers will have to bowl at the stumps otherwise they will go big. He further adds that we expect a lot of runs today and it is going to be a cracking game. The toss has played a crucial part in this tournament so far. Interestingly we saw the team successfully defend a target in the previous game at Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy. So, what will it be bat or bowl first? We will find out. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. After winning three back-to-back games, Gujarat were handed their first defeat in their previous game against Hyderabad. Just like their opposition, they do have a strong bowling attack. Mohammad Shami, Lockie Ferguson, and Rashid Khan are bowlers who all cause a lot of trouble. However, Matthew Wade has not been at his best and Gujarat will need him to give them the desired start if he is in the playing XI today. We could probably see Rahmanullah Gurbaz replace him. Rajasthan are coming into this game after defeating Lucknow in their previous game. Their main strength is their bowling attack. Trent Boult and Yuzvendra Chahal have been real match winners. After grabbing 11 wickets, Chahal is currently the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. He will prove to be a real threat. Although Rajasthan will need their top-order mainly, Sanju Samson to step up. He has been struggling in the past few games and he will want to get some runs under his belt. Rajasthan will be hoping they continue the same way and carry the winning momentum forward. Hello and a warm welcome folks to match number 24 of the Indian T20 League where Rajasthan will be up against Gujarat. There is not much that separates the two sides, both teams have played four games and have managed to grab 6 points so far. It will be an interesting battle to see which team comes out on top today. ...

Readers must note that Buttler and Shami have faced each other in four IPL innings in the past.

Derbyshire 180-2. Sussex’s young bowlers on a learning curve. Pujara watching and waiting. An email drifts by from Tim Thompson, “ Shan Masood’s century makes that two for Stamford school already this season. Do you know who bagged the first?” Oooh.. who of last week’s 20 centurions went to Stamford school? The county champions elect motoring along . Expecting Bohannon to have a tricky one after last year’s breakthrough season; Vilas due a better summer with the bat. Currently 151-3 (Croft 43, Vilas 39). Injury news: Alex Lees is missing today’s Durham game with a back injury. “Give me an over and I’ll give you a man.” Simon Harmer 1-1-0-1. Somerset 86-7. It’s easy this county cricket lark. Somerset. What to say: 75-6. Steven Davies wafts at Snater. Lammonby has survived two chances. Unfortunately, I’m unable to attend this summons! But please could you send the sun this way. Abbas and Abbott bowling to Amla at The Oval - we need you to complete the Grade A quartet @tjaldred . A lovely walk round the ground. Happy spectators, an ice cream van, grass and daisies left to grow wild, a golden Labrador, electric car charging points, vegan food as well as bacon rolls. Community gardens, six and four cards printed on wild flower embedded paper to plant at home. And Gloucestershire 75-2. Lovely to see this queen on the wall at @Gloscricket . Happy retirement! pic.twitter.com/GHJotWar9N Bracey falls just before lunch, and I’m going to take a stroll round Bristol. I don’t think I’ve been since watching Tendulkar make 140 in a 1999 World Cup game just after returning from his father’s funeral.

Not an extra in 24 overs for the Yorkies, the tightwads. Marcus Harris starting to look sublime and, ah, Charlesworth nibbles to Fisher and is well caught by Duke for 15. Gloucestershire 50-1. How do Somerset escape this rip in their batting universe? It is going to be a long, long season.. Head slumps into neck, neck slumps into shoulders: 49-5. Three for Sam Cook, two for Mark Steketee. Have Derbyshire (80-1) made the signing of the season? Yes they have. Oh Has. Alas.

The first seven rounds run Thursday-Sunday in successive weeks. A further five rounds follow in June and July before the finale in September. Each county plays 14 Championship matches, with seven home matches and seven away matches. So in Div Two, all play all, but in Div one .. they don’t. Happy Birthday Durham! Thirty years a first-class county today. Last week’s unbeaten centurion Alex Lees not playing today, whispers of an injury. Ah, thanks to Romeo for pointing this out. 🔴 @jimmy9 and @SaqMahmood25 are both absent from the squad after they were made unavailable for selection by the ECB.

Oo oh, I reckon in the sun, with a bank holiday ahead, people are happy to clap most things! As to whether people are getting less discerning - I don’t know. Does it matter do you think? Marcus Harris pats Haris Rauf square for four - gorgeous shot - and oooh dropped by Harry Duke next ball. Gloucs 29-0. Ok, time for a coffee and a sniff round the Division One grounds: Here at Gloucestershire, it’s been slow stuff: Fisher and Thompson keeping it tight, four slips, a good scattering in the cheap seats. And here comes Haris Rauf. Lancashire have lost their first wicket of the day, nay the season. Balderson gone for 7, while Wells has smashed six fours in his 30 - a three Weetabix morning. Somerset’s top order proves as fragile as ever: 25-2, Green and Renshaw gone; while Surrey ease into second gear, Burns and Patel swapping the roles they took at Edgbaston: Burns all bombast and Patel steady. “How on earth can it be fair for England to drop Anderson for West Indies tests then block Lancashire from using him but without guaranteeing him a place in the next test?” asks Stephen Herzenberg. “They are stopping Anderson from showing up the ECB by decimating Kent.” Hi Stephen, t o the best of my knowledge, Anderson and Broad fix their own schedules in conjunction with physios etc with the aim - as in other years - of getting themselves in the best shape for the first Test. Whether they play or not is another matter... A man for all seasons (but not April) Still no Jimmy Anderson, no Stuart Broad. Zak Crawley is back, as are Jack Leach , Craig Overton and Parky . Simon Harmer returns for Essex, Matt Renshaw for Somerset, Marnus Labuschagne for Glamorgan, Marcus Harris for Gloucestershire, Mohammad Rizwan and Cheteshwar Pujara at Hove If anyone missed this yesterday: reports of up to 12 ex Yorkshire players to be charged by the ECB on breaching the anti-discrimination code/bringing the game into disrepute, including Gary Ballance, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Gale and Tim Bresnan.

She started her domestic career for Somerset before going on to play 173 England games across all formats, winning the Ashes twice, and claiming 227 wickets. She finishes fourth on the list of England’s ODI wicket-takers, and bows out as England’s current top IT20 wicket-taker. She became the first woman to appear on the front of Wisden, in 2018, and retained her golden arm right to the end, taking two key wickets in the recent World Cup semi-final against South Africa. She will continue to play domestic cricket. “I feel immensely privileged to have been able to represent my country for the past 14 years,” said Shrubsole. “To have been involved in women’s cricket at a time of such growth has been an honour but it has become clear to me that it is moving forward faster than I can keep up with, so it is time for me to step away. “Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be lucky enough to play for England for so long, I’d have been happy with one game. There have been many ups and downs along the way but it was all worth it to be able to lift the ICC Women’s World Cup at Lord’s in 2017. “There have been so many people who have supported me along the way and I want to thank them all for everything they have done, but most of all I couldn’t have done it without the unwavering support of my family. They have been with me every step of the way and I simply couldn’t have done it without them.” Gloucester news: Marcus Harris will make his Gloucestershire debut today - said to be excited about playing Division One cricket after a spell with Leicestershire. Naseem Shah doesn’t play, out with a shoulder injury.

Pakistan's tour of India in 2012 was the last time the two countries played each other in a bilateral tie. It included 3 ODIs and 3 T20s each. Ashraf said that PCB had taken this decision to send players' wives to avoid any controversy involving the cricketers. \"During my time when our team went on a tour to India, I advised that all the wives of the players will accompany them. This decision was taken so that no controversy could be created as Indian media is always on the lookout for that. The wives meant to also keep a check on the players,\" Ashraf told Cricket Pakistan. \"Everyone took it in a nice manner and went to India. Everyone remained disciplined. Everytime a Pakistan team had toured India, their country would always try to trap us and tarnish the image of our players and country. So that was avoided.\" Ashraf added that he wants to see an India vs Pakistan series happening soon. Pakistan had toured India on invitation of BCCI and now a return tour is awaited, said Ashraf. \"We should always try to restore ties with the Indian government in regards to cricket. The biggest advantage we have right now is that General Bajwa is currently occupying the position and he himself wants to see Pakistan cricket prosper,\" Ashraf said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Andrew McDonald, the quiet achiever - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvYXVzdHJhbGlhLWFuZHJldy1tY2RvbmFsZC10aGUtcXVpZXQtYWNoaWV2ZXItMTMxMDcxONIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Andrew McDonald, the quiet achiever  ESPNcricinfoFrom the bottom to the top: McDonald's coaching journey  cricket.com.auAndrew McDonald replaces Justin Langer as the new head coach of Australian men`s cricket team  WIONFive key challenges for Andrew McDonald as Australia's new head coach  ESPNcricinfo‘Calm and collaborative’: McDonald the modern cricket coach  Sydney Morning HeraldView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-14 12:07:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"Divided And Untied By British\": Twitter On Pujara, Rizwan Sussex Debut","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/divided-and-untied-by-british-indian-and-pakistani-fans-celebrate-cheteshwar-pujara-and-mohammad-rizwans-sussex-debut-2888282","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"While Pujara is one of the finest Test batters of this generation, Rizwan has made a name for himself in white-ball cricket for Pakistan and was adjudged the ICC T20I Player of 2021.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-14 11:23:55","full_description":"Indian and Pakistani cricket fans are rarely united and today is one such occasion as two stalwarts from either country, Cheteshwar Pujara and Mohammad Rizwan are all set to make their debut for English county side Sussex.
