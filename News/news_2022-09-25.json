Whenever there is a discussion about mankading, India star player Ravichandran Ashwin's mankading of during the 2019 is remembered. After Dean's dismissal by Deepti, fans started sharing posts on their social media handles mentioning Ashwin's name, which then started trending. Looking at this, the 36-year-old all-rounder shared a sarcastic post on his Twitter handle. \"Why the hell are you trending Ashwin? Tonight is about another bowling hero Deepti Sharma,\" he wrote. England cricketer Stuart Broad also gave his take on the incident and tweeted, \"I find the debate of the Mankad really interesting. So many views from either side. I personally wouldn’t like to win a match like that, also, very happy for others to feel differently.\" Earlier in the match, Indian player Deepti Sharma dismissed England batsman Dean through Mankading. Deepti saw Dean outside the crease at the non-striker's end and removed the bails before completing her delivery stride.","pubDate":"2022-09-24 22:00:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Latest England flop shows there are only THREE problems with the Three Lions… the defence, midfield and attack","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19910639/england-world-cup-nations-league/","keywords":["Boxing","Sport","Football","UEFA Nations League","World Cup 2022"],"creator":["Dan King"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"ENGLAND only have three problems ahead of the World Cup: the defence, the midfield, and the attack. It’s an old joke borrowed from another sport, but Gareth Southgate isn’t laughing as he surveys a side unrecognisable from the Three Lions that achieved so much at the last two major tournaments. ReutersEngland suffered defeat in their Nations League clash with Italy on Friday night[/caption] Giacomo Raspadori put the Three Lions to th sword with a scintillating finishGetty ReutersGareth Southgate has major headaches ahead of the World Cup[/caption] England have gone from being one of the most prolific teams in Europe to failing to score from open play in five consecutive games. One goal always looked likely to be enough to beat an England team short on ideas and intensity. And so it proved as Giacomo Raspadori gave Italy a deserved win on Friday night in Milan. Southgate said: “We’ve got to be decisive in the final third and we’re not managing that at the moment.

Why does Raheem Sterling, to take the most high-profile example, look like a pale imitation of the player he is at club level and has long been for England? Captain Harry Kane seemed set to beat Wayne Rooney’s 53-goal all-time scoring record in time for the World Cup.

Kane said: “When you get to major tournaments, it’s about being clinical, taking one chance when you get it. “These last four or five games we haven’t done that. “We’re just not quite, especially from an attacking front, doing the business at the moment. “It’s disappointing, for sure, but I’m a confident guy. I know the strikers and attacking players here are confident players.” The problem is, England don’t look confident. And they have just one more game to sort that out — a Nations League dead rubber against Germany at Wembley tomorrow. It feels like a lot of the intensity and belief has gone out of Southgate’s England, particularly up front. And as ever with the Three Lions boss, there is debate about how to balance defensive strength with attacking threat. Tournament success was built on a strong defence which has crumbled as players like Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell lose their places at club level, while others struggle for fitness or form. Bukayo Saka found himself playing left wing-back in Milan on Friday night, but Southgate doesn’t seem to have many other solutions beyond the trusty back-three comes good again, rather than finding a way to make a back four work. The England boss said: “I think the defenders that are playing well are playing in back threes. Gareth Southgate has kept the faith with the underperforming Harry MaguireGETTY “Of course if you don’t win matches people will look at everything and we’re always open minded. “But I think it [three at the back] gives us the best chance, over the next few months, of depth in those positions where, if we get injuries, we’re not changing the system again and starting from scratch.” The return of Eric Dier was one positive thing to cling to from Friday. The performance of Jude Bellingham was another. Relying on a teenager with limited big tournament experience is a risk, but Southgate has little choice. His options in central midfield were already limited before Kalvin Phillips, fans’ player of the year in the season England reached the Euros final, had surgery on a shoulder that makes him no better than 50/50 to go to Qatar. Southgate said: “We have a slight lack of depth in the middle of midfield, which is a concern – but I think Jude had an excellent game, which is encouraging.” It is, but not enough to override all the other issues. Even England’s set-pieces, such a potent weapon at the 2018 World Cup, aren’t working anymore. So it feels a lot like Southgate’s side have become the football version of the nation’s cricket team in 1986. It was famously written: They can’t bat, can’t bowl, and can’t field.

England were eyeing a remarkable win in the third women’s one-day international when India bowler Deepti Sharma ran out non-striker Charlie Dean, who was well out of her ground. Dean’s 47, batting at number nine, had given England, who were 53-6, hope of chasing down a target of 170. Instead they were bowled out for 153 as India won by 16 runs to complete a 3-0 series sweep.

Start your free trial now > An emotional Dean broke down in tears when her dismissal was confirmed before sportingly shaking hands with her opponents. “Has that not just left the sourest taste in the mouth at the end of this international summer? I’m dumbfounded,” England all-rounder Georgia Elwiss said on BBC Test Match Special . “I cannot believe the Indian team felt that was the only way they were going to get a wicket. I don’t think Charlie Dean was trying to gain any sort of advantage. It’s ridiculous. “For me, Harmanpreet Kaur has got to look at her side and think, ‘is that how we want to win games of cricket?’ Can she not withdraw that appeal? “It’s taken the shine off Jhulan Goswami’s big send-off. She’s doing the lap of honour but everyone else in the ground is just stunned at how it’s finished.” Despite being allowed under cricket’s rules, running out a non-striker backing up has long been regarded as unsporting by many within the game. But it was only this week the International Cricket Council reiterated the dismissal, known as a “Mankad” after India’s Vinoo Mankad, who ran out Australia batsman Bill Brown backing up in a 1948 Test in Sydney, was completely legitimate. This was both teams’ first match at Lord’s since England beat India in the 2017 Women’s World Cup final. And while some boos were heard following Dean’s dismissal, Kaur was adamant Sharma had done nothing to overshadow either the victory or India pace great Jhulan Goswami’s last match before international retirement. “Today whatever we have done I don’t think it was any crime, it is part of the game and it is an ICC rule and I think we just need to back our player,” Kaur said. “I don’t think (Sharma) has done something wrong and we just need to back her.” England seamer Kate Cross said she would never take a wicket in this way but added: “I think it’s a dismissal that’s always going to divide opinion. That’s all that’s ever going to get said about it: some people are going to like it, some people aren’t. “Deepti chose to dismiss Charlie Dean that way. I’m more disappointed for Charlie Dean that she couldn’t get a fifty at Lord’s today because she looked set to do that. “If we’re looking at the real positives, then maybe that’s the only way they could have got Deano out today.”","pubDate":"2022-09-24 20:46:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jhulan Goswami retires: Twitterati applaud as legendary India cricketer plays her final international match","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/jhulan-goswami-retires-twitterati-applaud-as-legendary-india-cricketer-plays-her-final-international-match-11327481.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jhulan Goswami retires: Twitterati applaud as legendary India cricketer plays her final international match","content":"Renuka Singh’s four wickets, Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s two-wicket haul and an all-round effort from Women in Blue helped India give Jhulan Goswami a series-winning farewell as they bundled out hosts for 153 in the third ODI against England at Lord’s ground on Saturday.The highlight of the match was when Jhulan Goswami received a guard of honour from the players as she walked out to bat final time in international cricket.

In what was a jaw-dropping, yet a memorable way to mark an end to , Deepti Sharma displayed a cunning presence of mind, to dismiss the well-set Charlotte Dean (47 off 80) via a run out at the non-striker’s end, as Dean was found dangling outside the crease or backing away way too far before Deepti’s release of the ball. An agonizing loss for England, as they were in for a near-impossible triumph with mere 17 runs required in Over Six Overs and one wicket remaining in the bank. En route the modest target of 170, England were reduced to 65/7 at one stage, but a couple of crucial partnerships – 38 (76) runs between Amy Jones (28 off 50) and Charlotte Dean for the 8th wicket, and then worth 35 (50) runs for the 10th wicket between Freya Davies (10* off 29) and Dean, brought them right back into the contest, until Deepti decided to rip their jaws apart and snatch the memorable victory.

She further added that Deepti was well within her rights to run the batter Out, and that she will always back her players on the field for something which are well within the laws of the game. “To be honest, I thought you will ask about all the 10 wickets which was not easy to take as well [on being probed about the last wicket].

Read full story","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - India's Jhulan Goswami, the leading wicket-taker in women's ODIs, bowed out of international cricket on Saturday at Lord's after bowling her 10,000th ball in one-day matches, as her side completed a 3-0 series win over England with a controversial final wicket. Goswami claimed her record-extending 254th and 255th ODI wickets - the last one with her 10,001st delivery in the format - before ending her 20-year international career, having debuted in 2002. Her captain Harmanpreet Kaur said after the match: \"I know it was her last game but we'll always remember her, she's always with us and she's just a call away when we need her. I'm thankful we had the chance to play with her.\" But Goswami's achievement was somewhat overshadowed at the end of the match when Indian all-rounder Deepti Sharma ran out England's top-scorer Charlie Dean (47) for the final wicket with a \"mankad\" move, whipping off the bails of the non-facing batter, who had stepped out of her crease. While the move is legal according to the laws of cricket, many players and pundits say it is not within the spirit of the game. Boos rang out from England fans around the ground as the umpires reviewed their decision that Dean was out, and the player herself threw her bat and gloves to the ground, and eventually left the field in tears. Dean later told the BBC: \"The last dismissal divides opinion. I'm not a fan but it is how India feel about it. It is in the rules and hopefully it doesn't take the shine off a good summer and good series.\" England had been hoping for some redemption after losing the first two matches in the three-game series, but they eventually lost by 16 runs. Having announced her international retirement before the match, the 39-year-old Goswami was given a guard of honour by the England side when she came in to bat - only to be bowled out first ball - and again by her own side when they took the field. India struggled with the bat and were eventually bowled out for 169. Early in the day they had been reeling on 29 for four before making a gradual recovery. Opener Smriti Mandhana steadied the ship with a half-century off 79 balls, but was out in the next over when the ball deflected off the bottom of her bat and onto the stumps. Sharma then underpinned the side with an unbeaten top score of 68 off 106 balls. Kate Cross was England's best bowler with 4-26, claiming the early wickets of India captain Harmanpreet Kaur (4) - who had smashed an unbeaten 143 in the second match of the series on Wednesday - as well as those of Shafali Verma and Yastika Bhatia for ducks, and finally that of Mandhana. Despite being set a relatively low score, England soon found themselves in huge trouble as they crumbled to 53 for six, with India's Renuka Singh Thakur taking four wickets for 29 runs. Captain Amy Jones (28) took England past 100 runs before she fell to Thakur, and Dean then held the innings together as England drew steadily closer to their target of 170 - before Sharma's unexpected move snatched the win for India.

Goswami, bowling her final over in international cricket, castled England's Kate Cross with a beautiful delivery that seamed in to clatter the stumps. It was her 255th ODI wicket, and 355th across formats for India. Having starred in some of India Women's most historic matches, it was only fitting that she play a major role in helping them complete their first ever ODI series sweep in England. Her final spell read 2/30 in 10 overs and that combined with her 1/20 in the first ODI meant she gave fans a great reminder of what she has done through her career in her final few matches. It is also poetic that she ends her international career with an ODI, a format in which she is the leading wicket taker among women. Jhulan had made her debut all the way back in January 2002 in an ODI against England in Chennai, when she also picked up two wickets. Her Test debut came later that month, also against England. Her first T20I also came against the same opponents, albeit four years later. Goswami has gone on to play in two World Cup finals -- in 2005 and 2017.

Set to play a bilateral T20I series together for the first time ever, Bangladesh will take on UAE in a two-match T20I series beginning tomorrow at the Dubai International Stadium. Bangladesh’s record in the format has been dismal to say the least, having not been able to win a single bilateral T20I series this year so far. In fact, since the T20I World Cup in UAE last year, they have managed to win just a lone T20I off the 13 they have played thus far, including a forgetful Asia Cup 2022 campaign. As for the upcoming series, they would be without the services of their skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who is presently plying his trade for his Caribbean Premier League (CPL) franchise Guyana Amazon Warriors. Narul Hassan, who is returning back from an injury after having missed the Asia Cup, will act as the team’s interim skipper for the series. The UAE, on the other hand, will be playing a T20I exactly after a one-month gap, having missed on the Asia Cup 2022 berth by losing against Hong Kong in their last qualifier match by 8 wickets.

Hyderabad, the city of Nizams, has seen it all in the last three days. A stampede followed by a lathi-charge at the Gymkhana Grounds during the ticket sales for the India-Australia third T20I dampened the spirits of cricket lovers. But, such is the tradition of the rich land that produced cricketing legends like Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, ML Jaisimha, Arshad Ayub, Mohammad Azharuddin and VVS Laxman, to name a few, that an experience of that painful magnitude is only now etched in the memory, an encounter that fans have chosen to forget and forgive. Cricket is a uniting force in India and even as the scars of the lathi-charge are still fresh, the balm only being the love for the game with fans sprinting up and down the road leading up to the stadium, wearing their emotions on their sleeves, just to be a part of the festivity surrounding the spectacle. After all, international cricket is returning to the city after 1,024 calendar days. The fans’ emotions were decorated with gentle outbursts, with many still hoping to cheer for their superstars from the stands. While the off-field characters continue to dazzle, beneath the blue clear skies, with the sun beating down, the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium is decked up for a blockbuster decider when Rohit Sharma’s men will take on Aaron Finch’s Australia in the final T20I match on Sunday. The last time India played in this venue was in 2019 when then skipper Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten 94 in a high-scoring thriller to beat West Indies by six wickets. And Rohit Sharma will hope his troops produce a cricketing display of defiance and beauty to humble the mighty Australians. The Hitman Show In the series-levelling win on Friday, Rohit Sharma was at his belligerent best, exhibiting his six-hitting prowess as India won by six wickets in an eight-over contest that was reduced due to rain. A target of 91 was chased down with four balls as India bounced back from a fatal loss in Mohali. The showstopper was the Indian captain as Rohit paced the chase perfectly, dropped anchor when Adam Zampa sneaked out three crucial wickets and then picked up the momentum with Dinesh Karthik essaying into the finisher’s role at ease. KL Rahul, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya have looked solid with good knocks under their belts and will aim to fire on all cylinders in a must-win encounter. Virat Kohli is fresh on the back of an exuberantT20I century and although his knocks haven’t been impactful in this series, the modern master’s presence will give the team much batting depth and experience. Bumrah Returns India was bolstered with Bumrah’s return as the team ticked most of the boxes with the likes of Axar Patel and Karthik playing their roles to perfection. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was torn apart in the first T20I as he leaked 52 runs in his quota of four overs and while Umesh Yadav made way for Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar was omitted from the playing XI with India beefing its batting with Rishabh Pant in the second T20I. There was a lot of debate around Dinesh Karthik being preferred over Rishabh Pant but the team management hasn’t given any indication of who their preferred choice is. However, in the final T20I, Rohit might not tinker with the Playing XI that took the field in Nagpur, which means both the wicket-keepers will be in the eleven. Harshal Patel has been a bit of a worry for India ever since his return as the death overs specialist is struggling to make his slower deliveries translate into wickets. However, with Rohit’s backing, the medium pacer should bounce back in the decider. Green, Wade pose a serious threat From Australia’s point of view, the form of Cameron Green and Matthew Wade has been its biggest takeaway. While Green played an outstanding knock during the opener in a tall chase of 209 in Mohali, Wade displayed his batting pyrotechnics in Nagpur. An unbeaten 43 off 20 deliveries in the rain-curtailed second T20I match where the Australian dismantled Harshal in the final over, gave a glimpse of the finishing kick that the wicketkeeper-batsman brings to the table. The form of Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell has been under the spotlight and it will be interesting to see how Finch helps the duo iron out their form issues. While Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins continue to lead the bowling attack, Nathan Ellis stood out in the first T20I with a three-wicket haul and Zampa showed his prowess by spinning a web in Nagpur. India has just four T20Is to check its permutations and combinations before heading Down Under for the T20 World Cup. The one against the T20 defending champions on Sunday will be decisive in Hyderabad with a 55,000 full-capacity boisterous crowd backing the Men in Blue to claim the series title. It’s showtime, under the Uppal lights.

Both the teams must be pretty much pleased with the overall batting effort on display in each of the two T20Is. However, it is the bowling department, the death bowling in particular, which has been their cause of worry. As for team India, this facet of their game has made them pay big time off-late, including the Asia Cup 2022 debacle. The return of Jasprit Bumrah, however, might have lifted their spirits significantly. As for Australia, impressive performance from wicket-keeper batter Matthew Wade down the order, has been their biggest positive so far. However, the experienced pacers in Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins’ ordinary returns have left them scratching their heads a bit. All square. See you in Hyderabad. 🇮🇳👊 — Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) The Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad is set to host only its second men’s T20I tomorrow, with the last match taking place back in December 2019, when India defeated West Indies by 6 wickets. Moreover, since 2019, this venue has not even hosted an IPL match. However, despite the sample size being the shortest ever of a lone T20I, one might still get a know-how as to what should be expected of the Hyderabad pitch. The aforementioned T20I was an absolute run-fest with over 400 runs being scored by both the teams. Also, with a combined total of 27 Sixes during the contest, the Rajiv Gandhi stadium also holds the record of most Sixes being hit at an Indian venue during a T20I match. Thus, one should expect no respite for the bowlers tomorrow as well, with the relatively shorter boundaries likely to further add to their misery. Also, the pitch will be devoid of any tinge of grass, making it a batting paradise to say the least.","pubDate":"2022-09-24 15:32:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"In Pics: Jhulan Goswami bids adieu to international cricket","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/web-stories/jhulan-goswami-bids-adieu-to-international-cricket/photostory/94422667.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-24 15:08:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India Women vs England Women 3rd ODI Highlights: India Beat England In Jhulan Goswami's Farewell, Sw.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaW5kaWEtd29tZW4tdnMtZW5nbGFuZC13b21lbi0zcmQtb2RpLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0zMzczNTY10gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS13b21lbi12cy1lbmdsYW5kLXdvbWVuLTNyZC1vZGktbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTMzNzM1NjUvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India Women vs England Women 3rd ODI Highlights: India Beat England In Jhulan Goswami's Farewell, Sw..  NDTV SportsIndia vs England 3rd ODI highlights: IND take series 3-0  Hindustan TimesRecent Match Report - IND Women vs ENG Women 3rd ODI 2022  ESPNcricinfoEngland W vs India W (ENG vs IND) 3rd ODI Highlights: Jhulan wins in final game as India defeat England by 16 runs, clean sweep series  The Indian ExpressEN-W vs IN-W Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- India Women Tour of England, 3rd ODI  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-24 14:48:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘MS Dhoni told me not to take any kind of pressure, if we lose, it was on him’: Joginder Sharma recalls 2007 WC final","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ms-dhoni-told-me-not-to-take-any-kind-of-pressure-if-we-lose-it-was-on-him-joginder-sharma-recalls-2007-wc-final-11326871.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["Indo-Asian News Service"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘MS Dhoni told me not to take any kind of pressure, if we lose, it was on him’: Joginder Sharma recalls 2007 WC final","content":"New Delhi: Saturday marked 15 years of India’s triumph over Pakistan in the 2007 inaugural World T20 final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. This was India’s first world title in 24 years and a moment etched in the minds of fans to date. And who better than Adani Sportsline Gujarat Giant’s Joginder Sharma — the medium-pacer who helped India notch up a famous five-run win — to reminisce about what happened on that special night?Chasing a target of 158, Pakistan needed 13 off the last six balls. An in-form Misbah-ul-Haq was looking to take the match and title away from India. Under the circumstances, Dhoni took a gamble and turned to Joginder Sharma to bowl the final over. And Joginder delivered the goods by getting Misbah out.Watch: India won the inaugural T20 World Cup beating Pakistan in a last-over thriller On this day in 2007In a video posted by Adani Sportsline-owned Gujarat Giants on social media on Saturday, Joginder took the fans on an emotional journey and revealed what was the conversation he had with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni while bowling the last over on that night 15 years ago.“The discussion before the final over wasn’t around what line and length I should be bowling or what should be my bowling strategy.

At no point, we discussed what we needed to do. Just before I delivered the third ball, I saw Misbah getting ready to play a scoop. So I altered the length and bowled a slower one. That’s why Misbah couldn’t hit it properly. Sreesanth pulled off the catch and the rest as they say is history,” Joginder, who is playing the Legends League currently, said.Joginder said the memory is still fresh in his mind and will be forever treasured.
