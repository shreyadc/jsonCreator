Batting first, Udaipur Lakecity Warriors opener Kartik Sharma stood tall in the powerplay overs after losing his partner Aditya Garhwal for a golden duck. Middle-order batters Samarpit Joshi, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan also played crucial knocks in the middle and death overs, helping their side in putting a total of 162/6 in the stipulated 20 overs. Ravindra Khichar was the top bowler for Jodhpur as he picked three crucial wickets of Kartik Sharma, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan to keep the opposition on the back foot. In the chase, Jodhpur lost their opener Dev Yadav for a golden duck. However, Abhijeet Tomar stood tall, scoring 82 runs off 53 balls. Batting at no.4, keeper-batter Bharat Sharma played a pivotal role with an unbeaten half-century to take his side over the line with 1.5 overs to spare. With this comprehensive win, Jodhpur Sunrisers have set the epic final clash with Jaipur Indians on September 10, Sunday. On that note, let’s take a look at how the IPL players fared in Qualifier 2 of the Rajasthan Premier League 2023. Khaleel Ahmed proved his worth, scalping two crucial wickets of Dev Yadav and Anshul Garhwal in his four-over spell, conceding 33 runs. However, other bowlers didn't give enough support to him, resulting in Udaipur's defeat in the knockout game. Leg-spinner Rahul Chahar bagged the big wicket of Arjit Gupta in the middle overs to turn the tide towards his team. In his four-over quota, Chahar ended on the expensive side, conceding 44 runs.

In the 19th game, Noida Super Kings defeated Gorakhpur Lions convincingly by seven wickets. The 18th game was shortened to nine overs due to excessive rainfall ahead of the match. Batting first, Meerut Mavericks' opener Rituraj Sharma looked in excellent touch, scoring 47 runs off 24 balls with two fours and four sixes. In the end, Rinku Singh played an unbeaten 22-run knock off 10 balls to take the side to 103/2. Jasmer Dhankar was the lone successful bowler for Kanpur with a wicket. In reply, Kanpur struggled to get going, losing wickets quite regularly. Captain Sameer Rizvi was the only batter to do well with the bat. They eventually lost the game by just four runs via the VJD method. Yash Garg shone with the ball for Meerut with a three-wicket haul. With this thrilling win, Meerut climbed to the second spot on the table. Shifting our focus to the 19th game, Gorakhpur Lions batted first and posted an imposing total of 182/6 in 20 overs.

Meerut batter Swastik Chikara claimed the top spot on the batting chart, amassing 390 runs from six innings at an average of 97.5.

He is currently in the capital city of Sri Lanka, preparing for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 match against Pakistan. Due to incessant rains, the Shubman Gill and co have been practicing in the indoor nets. Indian left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav gave fans a glimpse of Shubman Gill's birthday celebrations in the team camp. He shared a picture and video of the same on this official X (formerly known as Twitter) handle. In it, Gill can be seen cutting the cake in the presence of other players. Kuldeep captioned the post: Gill has displayed mixed batting form in two matches of the Asia Cup so far. He failed miserably in the first match against a red-hot Pakistan pace trio - Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Haris Rauf - and scored only 10 runs from 32 balls. The youngster then hit a stroke-filled 67 against Nepal on Tuesday. Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan recently shed light on a certain technical deficiency, which according to him, has restricted Shubman Gill from scoring fluently in the recent past. He explained his stance by analyzing Gill's dismissal against Haris Rauf in the group match of the Asia Cup. During a recent discussion on Star Sports, Pathan said: He added: The high-octane contest between India and Pakistan will happen on Sunday (September 10) at the R.Premadasa Stadium, Colombo.

The Proteas bounced back with a 127-run victory at the National Stadium, after a disappointing in a 3-0 loss in the T20Is. South Africa take a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series in Pakistan, with the second match set on Monday. Luus and Kapp shared a mammoth 183-run fourth-wicket stand as the Proteas posted a competitive 292-4. Chasing 293 to win, the hosts continued to lose wickets at regular intervals as Ayabonga Khaka and Nadine de Klerk made early inroads. De Klerk, who notably scored an unbeaten 29 with the bat, also thrived with the ball as she took three wickets for 23. Spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba also came to the party as she caused destruction in Pakistan's middle-order and walked away with three scalps for 39 runs. Aliya Riaz was the only hope for the home side as she shared a 42-run stand with Sidra Nawaz (18). But Riaz kept losing partners at the other end and eventually remained unbeaten on 49 off 58 balls (hitting six fours) as Pakistan were restricted to 165. However, the stars of the match came in the form of all-rounders Luus and Kapp with the bat earlier on. The Proteas had a horrid start, losing openers Tazmin Brits (17) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt, who won the toss, also for 17. Lara Goodall made 15 to leave the Proteas reeling at 64-3, but a stunning and hard-fought century partnership from Luus and Kapp ensured a big total. Kapp got to her second ODI century - also her second against Pakistan - before eventually being caught out in the deep off the bowling of Nashra Sandhu (2/50). Luus brought up her maiden ODI century and eventually went on to score an unbeaten 107 off 129 balls (hitting seven fours). The second ODI gets under way on Monday at the same venue (12:30 SA time).

The all-rounder, who played in 79 Tests and 141 one-day matches for England, has kept a low profile since. But on Friday he was pictured in England coaching kit watching the opening ODI against New Zealand at Cardiff’s Sophia Gardens from the home team’s balcony. It is believed to be the first time Flintoff has been photographed in public since suffering his injuries. Flintoff is a close friend of England managing director Rob Key and is set to be with the squad for the remainder of the four-match series. The PA news agency understands the role is unpaid. He is not due to be with the group for the upcoming World Cup in India. England captain Jos Buttler said it was “great” to have Flintoff around the squad and he had “settled in really well”. Speaking after the hosts’ eight-wicket defeat, he said: “So he’s been starting to do some stuff in cricket. “It’s just great for him to be around, he’s obviously an England legend and it’s just nice to have him around the group. “He’s not been brought in with any specific role, just to be around and observe. “A few of the lads can pick his brains a little bit and he’s settled in really well. It’s great to have him with us. Just for this series.” The injuries from Flintoff’s Top Gear crash, which brought the filming of series 34 to a halt, appeared evident. He sported large cuts or scars on his face and surgical tape on his nose. A statement from BBC Studios earlier this year said it had “concluded its investigation into the accident at the Top Gear Test Track in Surrey last December, which regrettably injured presenter Freddie Flintoff”. It continued: “We have sincerely apologised to Freddie and will continue to support him with his recovery. Under the circumstances, we feel it would be inappropriate to resume making series 34 of Top Gear at this time. “We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but it is the right thing to do, and we’ll make a judgement about how best to continue later this year. This has also impacted the production team, who we continue to support.” Flintoff ended his international career in 2009 after helping England to an Ashes series victory over Australia before he retired from all forms of the game in 2015. He went on to launch a career in broadcasting, including featuring on Sky’s ‘A League Of Their Own’ and BBC’s Top Gear.","pubDate":"2023-09-08 21:10:34","image_url":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/resources/images/17209023/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"time_series","source_priority":668753,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c780ce6d3129f2fd93122aa0777073db","title":"Andrew Flintoff joins up with England squad for New Zealand ODI series","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23778459.andrew-flintoff-joins-england-squad-new-zealand-odi-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The former all-rounder has kept a low profile since being injured while filming for Top Gear last December.","content":"The former England captain, 45, was hospitalised last December after suffering facial injuries in an accident while shooting for the motoring show at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey.

To compound England’s woes, Adil Rashid struggled with cramp after bowling three overs and did not come back into the attack until New Zealand had decisively gained the upper hand, with unbeaten centuries from Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell securing a comprehensive eight-wicket victory. Buttler said: “Fingers crossed, he’s OK. Adil Rashid has been so good for us for so long as he’s been a member of this squad. Hopefully, he’ll be fine.

He’s really crucial member of the squad and is unique with the skill he offers. “Fingers crossed he can get some cricket under his belt, but we don’t need to rush it at all. Getting him fully fit and ready for travelling to India is the priority.” As for whether he knows his XI for the World Cup opener, Buttler said: “You always have an idea but the best laid plans sometimes change. There’s plenty of time and you have an idea but things can change.” Buttler top-scored for England with 72 off 68 balls in Cardiff while Ben Stokes amassed a resolute 52 off 69 deliveries in his first ODI in 14 months, having reversed his retirement for the World Cup. There were also fifties for Malan (54 off 53 balls) and Liam Livingstone (52 off 40), heartening innings for the pair who may be looking over their shoulders as Brook seeks a route into England’s final World Cup squad. The Yorkshireman, who was called up late as batting cover for this series, had an opportunity to push his case and while he made a pedestrian 25 off 41 balls in his first List A innings opening the batting and was upstaged by Malan’s fluent knock, Buttler is happy with Brook’s adaptability. “He’s a quality player, he can bat anywhere,” Buttler said. “It’s a great effort for him, from not being in the squad at the start and now being called up for as injury cover and then parachuted in to open the batting.” England’s 291 for six after they were asked to bat first on a tricky pitch appeared respectable and Buttler thought they were “just above a par score”, but they had no answer to a staggering, unbroken 180-run stand in 152 balls from Conway and Mitchell. Conway rebounded from three single-figure scores in the drawn T20 series to post a classy 111 not out from 121 balls while Mitchell was at his belligerent best in his unbeaten 118 off 91 deliveries. He hammered Livingstone for the last of seven sixes over the shorter straight boundaries as New Zealand won with 4.2 overs to spare to lay down a marker for the rest of the series. “It’s certainly not the World Cup, for us it was a great opportunity as a group to play against a quality side,” Conway said. “We’ve got another three opportunities to do that. “We thought (England’s total) was slightly above par, actually.

Set 292 to win in Friday's ODI, the New Zealanders reached the target with 26 balls to spare at Sophia Gardens as Conway (111no) and Mitchell (118no) each struck their fourth hundreds in the format. It was the first of four matches in an ODI series between teams who will open the World Cup by playing each other in Ahmedabad on October 5 - and New Zealand struck the first psychological blow. On this evidence, New Zealand are going into the tournament in better shape and are on a three-match winning streak over England in limited-overs cricket after victories in the final two Twenty20 internationals of their series that finished 2-2 on Tuesday. \"It's certainly not the World Cup - for us it was a great opportunity as a group to play against a quality side,\" Conway said. \"We've got another three opportunities to do that.\" Ben Stokes, who opted to come out of ODI retirement ahead of England's World Cup title defence in India, marked his return to the 50-overs format by being one of four batters to post fifties on what appeared a tough track at first. Stokes hit 52 after a quick knock of 54 from Dawid Malan, who was part of an emergency opening partnership with Harry Brook (25) because of injuries to Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy. Brook has been controversially left out of England's World Cup squad and is staking a claim for a late call-up. New Zealand were on top after removing Joe Root for six to leave England 3-101 in the 21st over but Stokes and captain Jos Buttler, who was the top scorer with 72 off 68 balls on his 33rd birthday, steadied the innings with a partnership of 88. Big-hitting Liam Livingstone weighed in with a lively 52 off 40, including three sixes, in a 77-run stand with Buttler before both fell to Tim Southee in the same over late on. David Willey's unbeaten 21 included a six down the ground off the last ball, and England seemed to have set a testing target despite allrounder Rachin Ravindra picking up 3-48 off his 10 overs of spin. But New Zealand were always ahead of the run-rate and batted with a great tempo. Opener Will Young - picked ahead of Finn Allen - hit 29 and Henry Nicholls 26 before Conway and Mitchell came together with the score at 2-117 and took England's attack apart. Adil Rashid (1-70 in eight overs) came in for heavy punishment as he was smashed over the shorter boundaries by Mitchell especially, before Conway clinched the win with a straight six off Livingstone. \"We thought (England's total) was slightly above par, actually,\" Conway said. \"The way Daryl came out was awesome. He really put his foot down, showed intent and then certainly made my job pretty easy at the other end.\" Former England captain Andrew Flintoff was in Cardiff for the game. He was hospitalised in December after he suffered facial injuries in an accident while shooting for TV program \"Top Gear\" and has kept a low profile since.

Batting first, Udaipur Lakecity Warriors opener Kartik Sharma stood tall in the powerplay overs after losing his partner Aditya Garhwal for a golden duck. Middle-order batters Samarpit Joshi, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan also played crucial knocks in the middle and death overs, helping their side in putting a total of 162/6 in the stipulated 20 overs. Ravindra Khichar was the top bowler for Jodhpur as he picked three crucial wickets of Kartik Sharma, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan to keep the opposition on the back foot. In the chase, Jodhpur lost their opener Dev Yadav for a golden duck. However, Abhijeet Tomar stood tall, scoring 82 runs off 53 balls.

On that note, let’s take a look at how the IPL players fared in Qualifier 2 of the Rajasthan Premier League 2023. Khaleel Ahmed proved his worth, scalping two crucial wickets of Dev Yadav and Anshul Garhwal in his four-over spell, conceding 33 runs. However, other bowlers didn't give enough support to him, resulting in Udaipur's defeat in the knockout game. Leg-spinner Rahul Chahar bagged the big wicket of Arjit Gupta in the middle overs to turn the tide towards his team. In his four-over quota, Chahar ended on the expensive side, conceding 44 runs.

Batting first, Meerut Mavericks' opener Rituraj Sharma looked in excellent touch, scoring 47 runs off 24 balls with two fours and four sixes. In the end, Rinku Singh played an unbeaten 22-run knock off 10 balls to take the side to 103/2. Jasmer Dhankar was the lone successful bowler for Kanpur with a wicket. In reply, Kanpur struggled to get going, losing wickets quite regularly. Captain Sameer Rizvi was the only batter to do well with the bat.

He is currently in the capital city of Sri Lanka, preparing for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 match against Pakistan. Due to incessant rains, the Shubman Gill and co have been practicing in the indoor nets. Indian left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav gave fans a glimpse of Shubman Gill's birthday celebrations in the team camp. He shared a picture and video of the same on this official X (formerly known as Twitter) handle. In it, Gill can be seen cutting the cake in the presence of other players. Kuldeep captioned the post: Gill has displayed mixed batting form in two matches of the Asia Cup so far. He failed miserably in the first match against a red-hot Pakistan pace trio - Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Haris Rauf - and scored only 10 runs from 32 balls. The youngster then hit a stroke-filled 67 against Nepal on Tuesday. Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan recently shed light on a certain technical deficiency, which according to him, has restricted Shubman Gill from scoring fluently in the recent past. He explained his stance by analyzing Gill's dismissal against Haris Rauf in the group match of the Asia Cup. During a recent discussion on Star Sports, Pathan said: He added: The high-octane contest between India and Pakistan will happen on Sunday (September 10) at the R.Premadasa Stadium, Colombo.

The Proteas bounced back with a 127-run victory at the National Stadium, after a disappointing in a 3-0 loss in the T20Is. South Africa take a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series in Pakistan, with the second match set on Monday. Luus and Kapp shared a mammoth 183-run fourth-wicket stand as the Proteas posted a competitive 292-4. Chasing 293 to win, the hosts continued to lose wickets at regular intervals as Ayabonga Khaka and Nadine de Klerk made early inroads. De Klerk, who notably scored an unbeaten 29 with the bat, also thrived with the ball as she took three wickets for 23. Spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba also came to the party as she caused destruction in Pakistan's middle-order and walked away with three scalps for 39 runs. Aliya Riaz was the only hope for the home side as she shared a 42-run stand with Sidra Nawaz (18). But Riaz kept losing partners at the other end and eventually remained unbeaten on 49 off 58 balls (hitting six fours) as Pakistan were restricted to 165. However, the stars of the match came in the form of all-rounders Luus and Kapp with the bat earlier on. The Proteas had a horrid start, losing openers Tazmin Brits (17) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt, who won the toss, also for 17. Lara Goodall made 15 to leave the Proteas reeling at 64-3, but a stunning and hard-fought century partnership from Luus and Kapp ensured a big total. Kapp got to her second ODI century - also her second against Pakistan - before eventually being caught out in the deep off the bowling of Nashra Sandhu (2/50). Luus brought up her maiden ODI century and eventually went on to score an unbeaten 107 off 129 balls (hitting seven fours). The second ODI gets under way on Monday at the same venue (12:30 SA time).

All-rounders Moeen Ali and Sam Curran plus express fast bowler Mark Wood were also conspicuous by their absence from this series opener between two teams who contested the dramatic 2019 World Cup final and will play the first match of this year’s extravaganza against each other on October 5 in Ahmedabad. To compound England’s woes, Adil Rashid struggled with cramp after bowling three overs and did not come back into the attack until New Zealand had decisively gained the upper hand, with unbeaten centuries from Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell securing a comprehensive eight-wicket victory. Buttler said: “Fingers crossed, he’s OK. Adil Rashid has been so good for us for so long as he’s been a member of this squad. Hopefully, he’ll be fine. We’ve had just a couple of niggles around. “Jonny had a little injury in the last T20 (on Tuesday). He would just need a few more days and we didn’t want to take a risk on him. Jason picked up a little injury sort of on the way in. “Woody’s still building back up. Again, someone we don’t need to take any risks with. He’s really crucial member of the squad and is unique with the skill he offers. “Fingers crossed he can get some cricket under his belt, but we don’t need to rush it at all. Getting him fully fit and ready for travelling to India is the priority.” As for whether he knows his XI for the World Cup opener, Buttler said: “You always have an idea but the best laid plans sometimes change. There’s plenty of time and you have an idea but things can change.” Buttler top-scored for England with 72 off 68 balls in Cardiff while Ben Stokes amassed a resolute 52 off 69 deliveries in his first ODI in 14 months, having reversed his retirement for the World Cup. There were also fifties for Malan (54 off 53 balls) and Liam Livingstone (52 off 40), heartening innings for the pair who may be looking over their shoulders as Brook seeks a route into England’s final World Cup squad. The Yorkshireman, who was called up late as batting cover for this series, had an opportunity to push his case and while he made a pedestrian 25 off 41 balls in his first List A innings opening the batting and was upstaged by Malan’s fluent knock, Buttler is happy with Brook’s adaptability. “He’s a quality player, he can bat anywhere,” Buttler said. “It’s a great effort for him, from not being in the squad at the start and now being called up for as injury cover and then parachuted in to open the batting.” England’s 291 for six after they were asked to bat first on a tricky pitch appeared respectable and Buttler thought they were “just above a par score”, but they had no answer to a staggering, unbroken 180-run stand in 152 balls from Conway and Mitchell. Conway rebounded from three single-figure scores in the drawn T20 series to post a classy 111 not out from 121 balls while Mitchell was at his belligerent best in his unbeaten 118 off 91 deliveries.

All-rounders Moeen Ali and Sam Curran plus express fast bowler Mark Wood were also conspicuous by their absence from this series opener between two teams who contested the dramatic 2019 World Cup final and will play the first match of this year’s extravaganza against each other on October 5 in Ahmedabad. To compound England’s woes, Adil Rashid struggled with cramp after bowling three overs and did not come back into the attack until New Zealand had decisively gained the upper hand, with unbeaten centuries from Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell securing a comprehensive eight-wicket victory. Buttler said: “Fingers crossed, he’s OK. Adil Rashid has been so good for us for so long as he’s been a member of this squad. Hopefully, he’ll be fine. We’ve had just a couple of niggles around. “Jonny had a little injury in the last T20 (on Tuesday). He would just need a few more days and we didn’t want to take a risk on him. Jason picked up a little injury sort of on the way in. “Woody’s still building back up. Again, someone we don’t need to take any risks with. He’s really crucial member of the squad and is unique with the skill he offers. “Fingers crossed he can get some cricket under his belt, but we don’t need to rush it at all. Getting him fully fit and ready for travelling to India is the priority.” As for whether he knows his XI for the World Cup opener, Buttler said: “You always have an idea but the best laid plans sometimes change. There’s plenty of time and you have an idea but things can change.” Buttler top-scored for England with 72 off 68 balls in Cardiff while Ben Stokes amassed a resolute 52 off 69 deliveries in his first ODI in 14 months, having reversed his retirement for the World Cup. There were also fifties for Malan (54 off 53 balls) and Liam Livingstone (52 off 40), heartening innings for the pair who may be looking over their shoulders as Brook seeks a route into England’s final World Cup squad. The Yorkshireman, who was called up late as batting cover for this series, had an opportunity to push his case and while he made a pedestrian 25 off 41 balls in his first List A innings opening the batting and was upstaged by Malan’s fluent knock, Buttler is happy with Brook’s adaptability. “He’s a quality player, he can bat anywhere,” Buttler said. “It’s a great effort for him, from not being in the squad at the start and now being called up for as injury cover and then parachuted in to open the batting.” England’s 291 for six after they were asked to bat first on a tricky pitch appeared respectable and Buttler thought they were “just above a par score”, but they had no answer to a staggering, unbroken 180-run stand in 152 balls from Conway and Mitchell. Conway rebounded from three single-figure scores in the drawn T20 series to post a classy 111 not out from 121 balls while Mitchell was at his belligerent best in his unbeaten 118 off 91 deliveries. He hammered Livingstone for the last of seven sixes over the shorter straight boundaries as New Zealand won with 4.2 overs to spare to lay down a marker for the rest of the series. “It’s certainly not the World Cup, for us it was a great opportunity as a group to play against a quality side,” Conway said. “We’ve got another three opportunities to do that. “We thought (England’s total) was slightly above par, actually.

Set 292 to win in Friday's ODI, the New Zealanders reached the target with 26 balls to spare at Sophia Gardens as Conway (111no) and Mitchell (118no) each struck their fourth hundreds in the format. It was the first of four matches in an ODI series between teams who will open the World Cup by playing each other in Ahmedabad on October 5 - and New Zealand struck the first psychological blow. On this evidence, New Zealand are going into the tournament in better shape and are on a three-match winning streak over England in limited-overs cricket after victories in the final two Twenty20 internationals of their series that finished 2-2 on Tuesday. \"It's certainly not the World Cup - for us it was a great opportunity as a group to play against a quality side,\" Conway said. \"We've got another three opportunities to do that.\" Ben Stokes, who opted to come out of ODI retirement ahead of England's World Cup title defence in India, marked his return to the 50-overs format by being one of four batters to post fifties on what appeared a tough track at first. Stokes hit 52 after a quick knock of 54 from Dawid Malan, who was part of an emergency opening partnership with Harry Brook (25) because of injuries to Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy. Brook has been controversially left out of England's World Cup squad and is staking a claim for a late call-up. New Zealand were on top after removing Joe Root for six to leave England 3-101 in the 21st over but Stokes and captain Jos Buttler, who was the top scorer with 72 off 68 balls on his 33rd birthday, steadied the innings with a partnership of 88. Big-hitting Liam Livingstone weighed in with a lively 52 off 40, including three sixes, in a 77-run stand with Buttler before both fell to Tim Southee in the same over late on. David Willey's unbeaten 21 included a six down the ground off the last ball, and England seemed to have set a testing target despite allrounder Rachin Ravindra picking up 3-48 off his 10 overs of spin. But New Zealand were always ahead of the run-rate and batted with a great tempo. Opener Will Young - picked ahead of Finn Allen - hit 29 and Henry Nicholls 26 before Conway and Mitchell came together with the score at 2-117 and took England's attack apart. Adil Rashid (1-70 in eight overs) came in for heavy punishment as he was smashed over the shorter boundaries by Mitchell especially, before Conway clinched the win with a straight six off Livingstone. \"We thought (England's total) was slightly above par, actually,\" Conway said. \"The way Daryl came out was awesome. He really put his foot down, showed intent and then certainly made my job pretty easy at the other end.\" Former England captain Andrew Flintoff was in Cardiff for the game. He was hospitalised in December after he suffered facial injuries in an accident while shooting for TV program \"Top Gear\" and has kept a low profile since.

Middle-order batters Samarpit Joshi, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan also played crucial knocks in the middle and death overs, helping their side in putting a total of 162/6 in the stipulated 20 overs. Ravindra Khichar was the top bowler for Jodhpur as he picked three crucial wickets of Kartik Sharma, Rahul Tomar and Shahbaz Khan to keep the opposition on the back foot. In the chase, Jodhpur lost their opener Dev Yadav for a golden duck. However, Abhijeet Tomar stood tall, scoring 82 runs off 53 balls.

However, other bowlers didn't give enough support to him, resulting in Udaipur's defeat in the knockout game. Leg-spinner Rahul Chahar bagged the big wicket of Arjit Gupta in the middle overs to turn the tide towards his team. In his four-over quota, Chahar ended on the expensive side, conceding 44 runs.

Due to incessant rains, the Shubman Gill and co have been practicing in the indoor nets. Indian left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav gave fans a glimpse of Shubman Gill's birthday celebrations in the team camp. He shared a picture and video of the same on this official X (formerly known as Twitter) handle. In it, Gill can be seen cutting the cake in the presence of other players. Kuldeep captioned the post: Gill has displayed mixed batting form in two matches of the Asia Cup so far. He failed miserably in the first match against a red-hot Pakistan pace trio - Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, and Haris Rauf - and scored only 10 runs from 32 balls. The youngster then hit a stroke-filled 67 against Nepal on Tuesday. Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan recently shed light on a certain technical deficiency, which according to him, has restricted Shubman Gill from scoring fluently in the recent past. He explained his stance by analyzing Gill's dismissal against Haris Rauf in the group match of the Asia Cup. During a recent discussion on Star Sports, Pathan said: He added: The high-octane contest between India and Pakistan will happen on Sunday (September 10) at the R.Premadasa Stadium, Colombo.

South Africa take a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series in Pakistan, with the second match set on Monday. Luus and Kapp shared a mammoth 183-run fourth-wicket stand as the Proteas posted a competitive 292-4. Chasing 293 to win, the hosts continued to lose wickets at regular intervals as Ayabonga Khaka and Nadine de Klerk made early inroads. De Klerk, who notably scored an unbeaten 29 with the bat, also thrived with the ball as she took three wickets for 23. Spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba also came to the party as she caused destruction in Pakistan's middle-order and walked away with three scalps for 39 runs. Aliya Riaz was the only hope for the home side as she shared a 42-run stand with Sidra Nawaz (18). But Riaz kept losing partners at the other end and eventually remained unbeaten on 49 off 58 balls (hitting six fours) as Pakistan were restricted to 165. However, the stars of the match came in the form of all-rounders Luus and Kapp with the bat earlier on. The Proteas had a horrid start, losing openers Tazmin Brits (17) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt, who won the toss, also for 17. Lara Goodall made 15 to leave the Proteas reeling at 64-3, but a stunning and hard-fought century partnership from Luus and Kapp ensured a big total.

He went on to launch a career in broadcasting, including featuring on Sky’s ‘A League Of Their Own’ and BBC’s Top Gear.","pubDate":"2023-09-08 21:10:34","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17209023/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3bc2605071394f8c7865cd7df429bc78","title":"Jos Buttler says England not taking any risks over fitness after heavy defeat","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23778495.jos-buttler-says-england-not-taking-risks-fitness-heavy-defeat/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand ran out victors by eight wickets in the first of four one-day internationals between the two teams.","content":"Caution was adopted over Jonny Bairstow’s shoulder niggle while Jason Roy succumbing to a back spasm on Friday morning meant Harry Brook formed a makeshift opening partnership with Dawid Malan at a hot and sticky Sophia Gardens. All-rounders Moeen Ali and Sam Curran plus express fast bowler Mark Wood were also conspicuous by their absence from this series opener between two teams who contested the dramatic 2019 World Cup final and will play the first match of this year’s extravaganza against each other on October 5 in Ahmedabad. To compound England’s woes, Adil Rashid struggled with cramp after bowling three overs and did not come back into the attack until New Zealand had decisively gained the upper hand, with unbeaten centuries from Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell securing a comprehensive eight-wicket victory. Buttler said: “Fingers crossed, he’s OK. Adil Rashid has been so good for us for so long as he’s been a member of this squad. Hopefully, he’ll be fine. We’ve had just a couple of niggles around. “Jonny had a little injury in the last T20 (on Tuesday). He would just need a few more days and we didn’t want to take a risk on him. Jason picked up a little injury sort of on the way in. “Woody’s still building back up. Again, someone we don’t need to take any risks with. He’s really crucial member of the squad and is unique with the skill he offers. “Fingers crossed he can get some cricket under his belt, but we don’t need to rush it at all. Getting him fully fit and ready for travelling to India is the priority.” As for whether he knows his XI for the World Cup opener, Buttler said: “You always have an idea but the best laid plans sometimes change. There’s plenty of time and you have an idea but things can change.” Buttler top-scored for England with 72 off 68 balls in Cardiff while Ben Stokes amassed a resolute 52 off 69 deliveries in his first ODI in 14 months, having reversed his retirement for the World Cup. There were also fifties for Malan (54 off 53 balls) and Liam Livingstone (52 off 40), heartening innings for the pair who may be looking over their shoulders as Brook seeks a route into England’s final World Cup squad. The Yorkshireman, who was called up late as batting cover for this series, had an opportunity to push his case and while he made a pedestrian 25 off 41 balls in his first List A innings opening the batting and was upstaged by Malan’s fluent knock, Buttler is happy with Brook’s adaptability. “He’s a quality player, he can bat anywhere,” Buttler said. “It’s a great effort for him, from not being in the squad at the start and now being called up for as injury cover and then parachuted in to open the batting.” England’s 291 for six after they were asked to bat first on a tricky pitch appeared respectable and Buttler thought they were “just above a par score”, but they had no answer to a staggering, unbroken 180-run stand in 152 balls from Conway and Mitchell. Conway rebounded from three single-figure scores in the drawn T20 series to post a classy 111 not out from 121 balls while Mitchell was at his belligerent best in his unbeaten 118 off 91 deliveries. He hammered Livingstone for the last of seven sixes over the shorter straight boundaries as New Zealand won with 4.2 overs to spare to lay down a marker for the rest of the series. “It’s certainly not the World Cup, for us it was a great opportunity as a group to play against a quality side,” Conway said. “We’ve got another three opportunities to do that. “We thought (England’s total) was slightly above par, actually. The way Daryl came out was awesome. He really put his foot down, showed intent and then certainly made my job pretty easy at the other end.”","pubDate":"2023-09-08 20:44:53","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17209094/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"34119a66d569b90f16dab70b9af66059","title":"Jos Buttler says England not taking any risks over fitness after heavy defeat","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23778495.jos-buttler-says-england-not-taking-risks-fitness-heavy-defeat/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand ran out victors by eight wickets in the first of four one-day internationals between the two teams.","content":"Caution was adopted over Jonny Bairstow’s shoulder niggle while Jason Roy succumbing to a back spasm on Friday morning meant Harry Brook formed a makeshift opening partnership with Dawid Malan at a hot and sticky Sophia Gardens.

Set 292 to win in Friday's ODI, the New Zealanders reached the target with 26 balls to spare at Sophia Gardens as Conway (111no) and Mitchell (118no) each struck their fourth hundreds in the format. It was the first of four matches in an ODI series between teams who will open the World Cup by playing each other in Ahmedabad on October 5 - and New Zealand struck the first psychological blow. On this evidence, New Zealand are going into the tournament in better shape and are on a three-match winning streak over England in limited-overs cricket after victories in the final two Twenty20 internationals of their series that finished 2-2 on Tuesday. \"It's certainly not the World Cup - for us it was a great opportunity as a group to play against a quality side,\" Conway said. \"We've got another three opportunities to do that.\" Ben Stokes, who opted to come out of ODI retirement ahead of England's World Cup title defence in India, marked his return to the 50-overs format by being one of four batters to post fifties on what appeared a tough track at first. Stokes hit 52 after a quick knock of 54 from Dawid Malan, who was part of an emergency opening partnership with Harry Brook (25) because of injuries to Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy. Brook has been controversially left out of England's World Cup squad and is staking a claim for a late call-up. New Zealand were on top after removing Joe Root for six to leave England 3-101 in the 21st over but Stokes and captain Jos Buttler, who was the top scorer with 72 off 68 balls on his 33rd birthday, steadied the innings with a partnership of 88. Big-hitting Liam Livingstone weighed in with a lively 52 off 40, including three sixes, in a 77-run stand with Buttler before both fell to Tim Southee in the same over late on. David Willey's unbeaten 21 included a six down the ground off the last ball, and England seemed to have set a testing target despite allrounder Rachin Ravindra picking up 3-48 off his 10 overs of spin. But New Zealand were always ahead of the run-rate and batted with a great tempo. Opener Will Young - picked ahead of Finn Allen - hit 29 and Henry Nicholls 26 before Conway and Mitchell came together with the score at 2-117 and took England's attack apart. Adil Rashid (1-70 in eight overs) came in for heavy punishment as he was smashed over the shorter boundaries by Mitchell especially, before Conway clinched the win with a straight six off Livingstone. \"We thought (England's total) was slightly above par, actually,\" Conway said. \"The way Daryl came out was awesome. He really put his foot down, showed intent and then certainly made my job pretty easy at the other end.\" Former England captain Andrew Flintoff was in Cardiff for the game. He was hospitalised in December after he suffered facial injuries in an accident while shooting for TV program \"Top Gear\" and has kept a low profile since. The second ODI is in Southampton on Sunday (Monday AEST).
