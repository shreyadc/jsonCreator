Ishant not just took a wicket in the powerplay but thrived when Warner handed him the responsibility of bowling the final over in a tense chase at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Bought for Rs 50 lakh late in the auction, Ishant Sharma has made a fine comeback to the IPL, picking up 6 wickets in 4 matches at an economy rate of just over 6 runs per over. Ishant had to wait for his opportunity as Delhi were struggling with 5 defeats on the row. However, the 34-year-old has proved he is far from finished in IPL 2023. Ishant had only 12 runs to defend against two of the most dangerous finishers in T20 cricket - Rahul Tewatia and Hardik Pandya. Tewatia had pummeled express pacer Anrich Nortje for 3 sixes in the last 3 deliveries of the 19th over and was ready to take Gujarat Titans past the finish line for yet another time. However, Ishant mixed it up wonderfully well, giving away just 3 runs, including a dot ball, in the first 3 balls of the final over. After bowling a wide Yorker to Tewatia, he banged one short to the left-hander, who was caught at covers. Ishant gave away just 6 runs in the final over, helping Delhi Capitals seal a 5-run win and keep their IPL 2023 playoffs chances alive. \"With Ishant forever getting younger and coming out and delivering, it's amazing to see him. How much did he hold his nerves there at the end, credit to him. I was nervous there when Tewatia was going off. He's renowned for that, he always hits the ball nice and clean towards the back end. Our best death bowler at the end has been Anrich. I passed the ball to him. Ishant was so clear with what he wanted to execute and he was able to do that,\" Warner said after Delhi Capitals' 3rd win of the season.

After a stunning new-ball burst from Mohammed Shami, who took 4 for 7 in his first 3 overs, Delhi Capitals, who were without Mitchell Marsh, were reduced to 23 for 5. None of the batters found answers to Shami's brilliance while David Warner was run-out in the powerplay. However, Aman Hakim Khan hit 51 from 44 balls with support from Axar Patel (27) and Ripal Patel (21) to help Delhi post 130, which in the end, proved to be a winning total. \"We just keep finding ways to lose wickets in clumps. Another runout. I just don't know what's happening with our batting at the moment. We tried to have positive intent today. It didn't come off. But look, we won and got the two points,\" Warner added.

Ishant Sharma stopped Rahul Tewatia's blitz in the final over, successfully defending just 12 runs in the last 6 deliveries. against Delhi Capitals despite a 59 not out from their captain Hardik Pandya. It was the first time Gujarat lost a match while chasing in IPL 2023 and only the second time they have failed to do so in their nascent history in the tournament. Gujarat Titans needed 33 runs in the last 2 overs but Rahul Tewatia went after express pacer Anrich Nortje, hitting him for 3 sixes in the last 3 balls of the penultimate over. Needing just 12 runs in the last over, Gujarat were well-placed to pull off another win as Tewatia was in the mood to do a Tewatia. However, Ishant Sharma gave away just 3 runs in the first two balls, before bowling a dot ball against Tewatia with a wide yorker. Ishant Sharma mixed it up in the 4th delivery with a short delivery, banged into the pitch and went away from the left-hander. Tewatia was surprised by the delivery as he skied one into the air and was caught in the extra cover region. It was a crucial wicket as Ishant then held his nerve and closed out the match, giving away just 6 runs in the final over. \" I played enough cricket with Tewatia, so was just having fun with him. I knew I had to double bluff him otherwise we know what he can do with the bat,\" Ishant said, elaborating on his change-ups in the final over. The senior bowler, who was bought for Rs 50 lakh, came into the IPL 2023 season after 5 matches. However, he has stepped up big time for Delhi, picking up 6 wickets in 4 matches at an economy rate of 6.50. On Tuesday, Ishant cleaned up Vijay Shankar in the powerplay with a knuckleball before coming to deliver the perfect final over for Delhi Capitals. \"I keep practicing in the nets. We practice bowling we the new ball, but at the same time we do practice bowling wide yorkers, and today the hardwork paid off, I just backed myself and bowled wide yorkers. When you are preparing yourself in the nets we plan to certain batsmen as to what to bowl and it is all about executing it every single time, back yourself and believing in yourself,\" he added. Delhi Capitals clinched only their 3rd win in 9 matches and are still at the bottom of the IPL 2023 points table. However, Ishant said this could be the start of something good for Delhi Capitals who kept themselves alive in the play-offs race with the win over Gujarat. \"From here on, we just carry the momentum and look to win one game at a time and hope for the best from the future,\" Ishant said.

Hardik said that Rahul Tewatia got them back in the game and he himself tried his best but could not capitalize while admitting that they were hoping to get a couple of big overs during the middle phase but could not get the rhythm. Delhi Capitals defended 130 to register a five-run win over defending champions Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. \"Obviously, we would have taken 129 on any given day. Just lost a couple of wickets but Rahul got us back in the game. I tried hard but failed to get across the line. We were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle overs. We couldn't get a rhythm as well,\" Hardik said in the post-match presentation ceremony. Gujarat would have hoped that they would get a steady start to set up the base for this chase but Delhi had other plans. They lost Wriddhiman Saha in the first over, while Shubman Gill and Vijay Shankar followed him soon and they were reduced to 26-3 in the Powerplay. Pandya held one end, losing one partner after the other, at the other end, and the promotion of David Miller also did not work out as he was dismissed too, while trying to be a bit too cute. However, after that, the skipper finally found a batter in Abhinav Manohar, who supported him really well. They built up an extremely crucial partnership and kept them in the chase. Pandya registered a fine fifty and both added 62 runs together but it was difficult for them to find the boundaries and Manohar perished trying to find one. However, the iceman, Rahul Tewatia, came in and smashed three sixes in the penultimate over to make the equation 12 runs in the last over, but he could not finish the job and they fell short by five runs in the end. \"It came down to me as I couldn't finish the game. But full marks for the way they bowled. The wicket didn't play much role. It was about us feeling the pressure due to the loss of wickets. Rahul got us back in the game, but it wasn't enough. We kept losing wickets and it was difficult to keep the intent. That puts us under more pressure. \"I feel sorry for Shami to be honest. The batters were disappointed tonight. The ball didn't do a lot. It was all about Shami's skills tonight. Full credit to him. But as I said, the batters were disappointed and I was not good at all. Still a lot of games left. We will learn from this game and look to rectify those in the upcoming games. We need to keep playing good cricket,\" Hardik signed off.","pubDate":"2023-05-02 18:11:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Steve Smith joins Pujara at Sussex in County Championship ahead of WTC Final","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/steve-smith-joins-pujara-at-sussex-in-county-championship-ahead-of-wtc-final-2367749-2023-05-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith joins Pujara at Sussex in County Championship ahead of WTC Final","content":": Australia star batter Steve Smith has joined India's Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara at the Sussex Cricket Club in the ongoing County Championship season ahead of the World Test Championship final.

And Joshua appeared to confirm that a blockbuster meeting with the Bronze Bomber is on the cards for later this year. In a video reposted to YouTube by iFL TV from Instagram, Joshua was asked if he’s going to beat Wilder. AJ responded: “That’s what’s happening, you know what’s going on.” When asked if the fight was going ahead in December, Joshua replied: “It’s public news we’re getting it down, throwing it down in December.” The pair have accumulated a huge wealth from boxing. While Wilder has made around £25million from the sport, that figure is dwarfed by AJ’s reported £170million fortune. It affords the heavyweight duo a lifestyle to envy. Here’s how they compare.

Ishant not just took a wicket in the powerplay but thrived when Warner handed him the responsibility of bowling the final over in a tense chase at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Bought for Rs 50 lakh late in the auction, Ishant Sharma has made a fine comeback to the IPL, picking up 6 wickets in 4 matches at an economy rate of just over 6 runs per over. Ishant had to wait for his opportunity as Delhi were struggling with 5 defeats on the row. However, the 34-year-old has proved he is far from finished in IPL 2023. Ishant had only 12 runs to defend against two of the most dangerous finishers in T20 cricket - Rahul Tewatia and Hardik Pandya. Tewatia had pummeled express pacer Anrich Nortje for 3 sixes in the last 3 deliveries of the 19th over and was ready to take Gujarat Titans past the finish line for yet another time. However, Ishant mixed it up wonderfully well, giving away just 3 runs, including a dot ball, in the first 3 balls of the final over. After bowling a wide Yorker to Tewatia, he banged one short to the left-hander, who was caught at covers. Ishant gave away just 6 runs in the final over, helping Delhi Capitals seal a 5-run win and keep their IPL 2023 playoffs chances alive. \"With Ishant forever getting younger and coming out and delivering, it's amazing to see him. How much did he hold his nerves there at the end, credit to him. I was nervous there when Tewatia was going off. He's renowned for that, he always hits the ball nice and clean towards the back end. Our best death bowler at the end has been Anrich. I passed the ball to him. Ishant was so clear with what he wanted to execute and he was able to do that,\" Warner said after Delhi Capitals' 3rd win of the season.

After a stunning new-ball burst from Mohammed Shami, who took 4 for 7 in his first 3 overs, Delhi Capitals, who were without Mitchell Marsh, were reduced to 23 for 5. None of the batters found answers to Shami's brilliance while David Warner was run-out in the powerplay. However, Aman Hakim Khan hit 51 from 44 balls with support from Axar Patel (27) and Ripal Patel (21) to help Delhi post 130, which in the end, proved to be a winning total. \"We just keep finding ways to lose wickets in clumps. Another runout. I just don't know what's happening with our batting at the moment. We tried to have positive intent today. It didn't come off. But look, we won and got the two points,\" Warner added.

Ishant Sharma stopped Rahul Tewatia's blitz in the final over, successfully defending just 12 runs in the last 6 deliveries. against Delhi Capitals despite a 59 not out from their captain Hardik Pandya. It was the first time Gujarat lost a match while chasing in IPL 2023 and only the second time they have failed to do so in their nascent history in the tournament. Gujarat Titans needed 33 runs in the last 2 overs but Rahul Tewatia went after express pacer Anrich Nortje, hitting him for 3 sixes in the last 3 balls of the penultimate over. Needing just 12 runs in the last over, Gujarat were well-placed to pull off another win as Tewatia was in the mood to do a Tewatia. However, Ishant Sharma gave away just 3 runs in the first two balls, before bowling a dot ball against Tewatia with a wide yorker. Ishant Sharma mixed it up in the 4th delivery with a short delivery, banged into the pitch and went away from the left-hander. Tewatia was surprised by the delivery as he skied one into the air and was caught in the extra cover region. It was a crucial wicket as Ishant then held his nerve and closed out the match, giving away just 6 runs in the final over. \" I played enough cricket with Tewatia, so was just having fun with him. I knew I had to double bluff him otherwise we know what he can do with the bat,\" Ishant said, elaborating on his change-ups in the final over. The senior bowler, who was bought for Rs 50 lakh, came into the IPL 2023 season after 5 matches. However, he has stepped up big time for Delhi, picking up 6 wickets in 4 matches at an economy rate of 6.50. On Tuesday, Ishant cleaned up Vijay Shankar in the powerplay with a knuckleball before coming to deliver the perfect final over for Delhi Capitals. \"I keep practicing in the nets. We practice bowling we the new ball, but at the same time we do practice bowling wide yorkers, and today the hardwork paid off, I just backed myself and bowled wide yorkers. When you are preparing yourself in the nets we plan to certain batsmen as to what to bowl and it is all about executing it every single time, back yourself and believing in yourself,\" he added. Delhi Capitals clinched only their 3rd win in 9 matches and are still at the bottom of the IPL 2023 points table. However, Ishant said this could be the start of something good for Delhi Capitals who kept themselves alive in the play-offs race with the win over Gujarat. \"From here on, we just carry the momentum and look to win one game at a time and hope for the best from the future,\" Ishant said.

Hardik said that Rahul Tewatia got them back in the game and he himself tried his best but could not capitalize while admitting that they were hoping to get a couple of big overs during the middle phase but could not get the rhythm. Delhi Capitals defended 130 to register a five-run win over defending champions Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. \"Obviously, we would have taken 129 on any given day. Just lost a couple of wickets but Rahul got us back in the game. I tried hard but failed to get across the line. We were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle overs. We couldn't get a rhythm as well,\" Hardik said in the post-match presentation ceremony. Gujarat would have hoped that they would get a steady start to set up the base for this chase but Delhi had other plans. They lost Wriddhiman Saha in the first over, while Shubman Gill and Vijay Shankar followed him soon and they were reduced to 26-3 in the Powerplay. Pandya held one end, losing one partner after the other, at the other end, and the promotion of David Miller also did not work out as he was dismissed too, while trying to be a bit too cute. However, after that, the skipper finally found a batter in Abhinav Manohar, who supported him really well. They built up an extremely crucial partnership and kept them in the chase. Pandya registered a fine fifty and both added 62 runs together but it was difficult for them to find the boundaries and Manohar perished trying to find one. However, the iceman, Rahul Tewatia, came in and smashed three sixes in the penultimate over to make the equation 12 runs in the last over, but he could not finish the job and they fell short by five runs in the end. \"It came down to me as I couldn't finish the game. But full marks for the way they bowled. The wicket didn't play much role. It was about us feeling the pressure due to the loss of wickets. Rahul got us back in the game, but it wasn't enough. We kept losing wickets and it was difficult to keep the intent. That puts us under more pressure. \"I feel sorry for Shami to be honest. The batters were disappointed tonight. The ball didn't do a lot. It was all about Shami's skills tonight. Full credit to him. But as I said, the batters were disappointed and I was not good at all. Still a lot of games left. We will learn from this game and look to rectify those in the upcoming games. We need to keep playing good cricket,\" Hardik signed off.","pubDate":"2023-05-02 18:11:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Steve Smith joins Pujara at Sussex in County Championship ahead of WTC Final","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/steve-smith-joins-pujara-at-sussex-in-county-championship-ahead-of-wtc-final-2367749-2023-05-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith joins Pujara at Sussex in County Championship ahead of WTC Final","content":": Australia star batter Steve Smith has joined India's Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara at the Sussex Cricket Club in the ongoing County Championship season ahead of the World Test Championship final.

And Joshua appeared to confirm that a blockbuster meeting with the Bronze Bomber is on the cards for later this year. In a video reposted to YouTube by iFL TV from Instagram, Joshua was asked if he’s going to beat Wilder. AJ responded: “That’s what’s happening, you know what’s going on.” When asked if the fight was going ahead in December, Joshua replied: “It’s public news we’re getting it down, throwing it down in December.” The pair have accumulated a huge wealth from boxing. While Wilder has made around £25million from the sport, that figure is dwarfed by AJ’s reported £170million fortune. It affords the heavyweight duo a lifestyle to envy. Here’s how they compare.

Ishant not just took a wicket in the powerplay but thrived when Warner handed him the responsibility of bowling the final over in a tense chase at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Bought for Rs 50 lakh late in the auction, Ishant Sharma has made a fine comeback to the IPL, picking up 6 wickets in 4 matches at an economy rate of just over 6 runs per over. Ishant had to wait for his opportunity as Delhi were struggling with 5 defeats on the row. However, the 34-year-old has proved he is far from finished in IPL 2023. Ishant had only 12 runs to defend against two of the most dangerous finishers in T20 cricket - Rahul Tewatia and Hardik Pandya. Tewatia had pummeled express pacer Anrich Nortje for 3 sixes in the last 3 deliveries of the 19th over and was ready to take Gujarat Titans past the finish line for yet another time. However, Ishant mixed it up wonderfully well, giving away just 3 runs, including a dot ball, in the first 3 balls of the final over. After bowling a wide Yorker to Tewatia, he banged one short to the left-hander, who was caught at covers. Ishant gave away just 6 runs in the final over, helping Delhi Capitals seal a 5-run win and keep their IPL 2023 playoffs chances alive. \"With Ishant forever getting younger and coming out and delivering, it's amazing to see him. How much did he hold his nerves there at the end, credit to him. I was nervous there when Tewatia was going off. He's renowned for that, he always hits the ball nice and clean towards the back end. Our best death bowler at the end has been Anrich. I passed the ball to him. Ishant was so clear with what he wanted to execute and he was able to do that,\" Warner said after Delhi Capitals' 3rd win of the season.

After a stunning new-ball burst from Mohammed Shami, who took 4 for 7 in his first 3 overs, Delhi Capitals, who were without Mitchell Marsh, were reduced to 23 for 5. None of the batters found answers to Shami's brilliance while David Warner was run-out in the powerplay. However, Aman Hakim Khan hit 51 from 44 balls with support from Axar Patel (27) and Ripal Patel (21) to help Delhi post 130, which in the end, proved to be a winning total. \"We just keep finding ways to lose wickets in clumps. Another runout. I just don't know what's happening with our batting at the moment. We tried to have positive intent today. It didn't come off. But look, we won and got the two points,\" Warner added.

Ishant Sharma stopped Rahul Tewatia's blitz in the final over, successfully defending just 12 runs in the last 6 deliveries. against Delhi Capitals despite a 59 not out from their captain Hardik Pandya. It was the first time Gujarat lost a match while chasing in IPL 2023 and only the second time they have failed to do so in their nascent history in the tournament. Gujarat Titans needed 33 runs in the last 2 overs but Rahul Tewatia went after express pacer Anrich Nortje, hitting him for 3 sixes in the last 3 balls of the penultimate over. Needing just 12 runs in the last over, Gujarat were well-placed to pull off another win as Tewatia was in the mood to do a Tewatia. However, Ishant Sharma gave away just 3 runs in the first two balls, before bowling a dot ball against Tewatia with a wide yorker. Ishant Sharma mixed it up in the 4th delivery with a short delivery, banged into the pitch and went away from the left-hander. Tewatia was surprised by the delivery as he skied one into the air and was caught in the extra cover region. It was a crucial wicket as Ishant then held his nerve and closed out the match, giving away just 6 runs in the final over. \" I played enough cricket with Tewatia, so was just having fun with him. I knew I had to double bluff him otherwise we know what he can do with the bat,\" Ishant said, elaborating on his change-ups in the final over. The senior bowler, who was bought for Rs 50 lakh, came into the IPL 2023 season after 5 matches. However, he has stepped up big time for Delhi, picking up 6 wickets in 4 matches at an economy rate of 6.50. On Tuesday, Ishant cleaned up Vijay Shankar in the powerplay with a knuckleball before coming to deliver the perfect final over for Delhi Capitals. \"I keep practicing in the nets. We practice bowling we the new ball, but at the same time we do practice bowling wide yorkers, and today the hardwork paid off, I just backed myself and bowled wide yorkers. When you are preparing yourself in the nets we plan to certain batsmen as to what to bowl and it is all about executing it every single time, back yourself and believing in yourself,\" he added. Delhi Capitals clinched only their 3rd win in 9 matches and are still at the bottom of the IPL 2023 points table. However, Ishant said this could be the start of something good for Delhi Capitals who kept themselves alive in the play-offs race with the win over Gujarat. \"From here on, we just carry the momentum and look to win one game at a time and hope for the best from the future,\" Ishant said.

Hardik said that Rahul Tewatia got them back in the game and he himself tried his best but could not capitalize while admitting that they were hoping to get a couple of big overs during the middle phase but could not get the rhythm. Delhi Capitals defended 130 to register a five-run win over defending champions Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. \"Obviously, we would have taken 129 on any given day. Just lost a couple of wickets but Rahul got us back in the game. I tried hard but failed to get across the line. We were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle overs. We couldn't get a rhythm as well,\" Hardik said in the post-match presentation ceremony. Gujarat would have hoped that they would get a steady start to set up the base for this chase but Delhi had other plans. They lost Wriddhiman Saha in the first over, while Shubman Gill and Vijay Shankar followed him soon and they were reduced to 26-3 in the Powerplay. Pandya held one end, losing one partner after the other, at the other end, and the promotion of David Miller also did not work out as he was dismissed too, while trying to be a bit too cute. However, after that, the skipper finally found a batter in Abhinav Manohar, who supported him really well. They built up an extremely crucial partnership and kept them in the chase. Pandya registered a fine fifty and both added 62 runs together but it was difficult for them to find the boundaries and Manohar perished trying to find one. However, the iceman, Rahul Tewatia, came in and smashed three sixes in the penultimate over to make the equation 12 runs in the last over, but he could not finish the job and they fell short by five runs in the end. \"It came down to me as I couldn't finish the game. But full marks for the way they bowled. The wicket didn't play much role. It was about us feeling the pressure due to the loss of wickets. Rahul got us back in the game, but it wasn't enough. We kept losing wickets and it was difficult to keep the intent. That puts us under more pressure. \"I feel sorry for Shami to be honest. The batters were disappointed tonight. The ball didn't do a lot. It was all about Shami's skills tonight. Full credit to him. But as I said, the batters were disappointed and I was not good at all. Still a lot of games left. We will learn from this game and look to rectify those in the upcoming games. We need to keep playing good cricket,\" Hardik signed off.","pubDate":"2023-05-02 18:11:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Steve Smith joins Pujara at Sussex in County Championship ahead of WTC Final","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/steve-smith-joins-pujara-at-sussex-in-county-championship-ahead-of-wtc-final-2367749-2023-05-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith joins Pujara at Sussex in County Championship ahead of WTC Final","content":": Australia star batter Steve Smith has joined India's Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara at the Sussex Cricket Club in the ongoing County Championship season ahead of the World Test Championship final.

And Joshua appeared to confirm that a blockbuster meeting with the Bronze Bomber is on the cards for later this year. In a video reposted to YouTube by iFL TV from Instagram, Joshua was asked if he’s going to beat Wilder. AJ responded: “That’s what’s happening, you know what’s going on.” When asked if the fight was going ahead in December, Joshua replied: “It’s public news we’re getting it down, throwing it down in December.” The pair have accumulated a huge wealth from boxing. While Wilder has made around £25million from the sport, that figure is dwarfed by AJ’s reported £170million fortune. It affords the heavyweight duo a lifestyle to envy. Here’s how they compare.
