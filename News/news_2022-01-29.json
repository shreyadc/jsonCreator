Pakistan Super League 2022 is up and running in Karachi, and we have seen a couple of great games. There have been some Covid cases, but it is a normal routine across the world now. The defending champions Multan Sultans faced Karachi Kings in the opening game of the tournament. Babar Azam led Karachi Kings failed in the first game, and the Sultans got their first won of the season. Babar Azam struggled in the first game, but Sharjeel Khan proved his mettle with the bat. The evergreen Imran Tahir took three wickets for the Sultans. Courtesy of Mohammad Rizwan’s half-century, the Sultans easily won the game by seven wickets. In the 2nd game of the season, the Quetta Gladiators were up against Peshawar Zalmi. The Gladiators were missing the services of Shahid Afridi, whereas the Zalmis were missing their captain Wahab Riaz. Both of them were out due to Covid. This game produced some brilliant action for cricket fans with boundaries all around. Quetta Gladiators managed to score 190 runs in the first innings. English opener Will Smeed missed his century by just three runs, whereas Ahsan Ali also played a fine knock of 73 runs. Peshawar Zalmi chased the target with two balls to spare, Shoaib Malik and Hussain Talat proved their batting powers.

Credit: Getty Starc won Australian cricket’s top honour after a stellar season, which saw the left-armer snare 43 wickets across all formats - 12 clear of Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa - at an average of 24.4. The voting period was from January 26 last year to January 18 this year. Awards were voted by cricketers, peers, umpires and the media across every game of international cricket. In an incredibly tight finish, Starc (107) edged out Mitchell Marsh (106) by one vote to extend the streak of a NSW player winning the award to eight years. Mitchell Johnson was the last non-NSW player to win the Allan Border Medal. Steve Smith (2015, 2018, 2021), David Warner (2016, 2017, 2020) and Pat Cummins (2019) are the previous winners. It caps a remarkable period for Starc, who has copped his fair share of criticism, particularly leading into the Ashes series. “I’m not really sure what words to say at the moment,” Starc said on Channel Seven from Manuka Oval on Saturday. “It was a huge surprise. To look at some of those names who have won it before, it’ll take a bit to sink in. Hugely honoured to receive this award.” Travis Head, who was named player of the Ashes, finished third in the polling (72 votes) but was named Test player of the year, ahead of Starc and Scott Boland. Australia’s five Ashes fixtures were the only Test matches in the voting period, with Head making 357 runs at 59.5 from six innings.

Meanwhile, Gardner is also a maiden winner of the top female award. Gardner scored 281 runs at 35.1 across all formats, to go with her nine wickets.

Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis have turned the tennis world on its head to the point where Saturday night’s doubles showdown with Max Purcell and Matt Ebden – marking the first all-Australian men’s grand slam doubles final in 42 years – has turned into one of the most anticipated matches of the week. KYRGIOS & KOKKINAKIS V EBDEN & PURCELL STARTS AFTER THE WOMEN’S FINAL | FOLLOW BARTY V COLLINS LIVE And it could be a lucrative one, too. Kyrgios played precious few tournaments in 2021, entering the Australian Open on the back of a five-match losing streak, and finished the year with a 7-8 singles record – with $430,102 finding its way into his bank account. While that’s nothing to sniff at, he’s set to blow that out of the water in one special fortnight with his best mate. Watch Tennis Live with beIN SPORTS on Kayo.

Start Your Free Trial > Should they keep the party going with victory over fellow Australians Max Purcell and Matt Ebden on Saturday, they’ll split the $675,000 in prizemoney – giving each player $337,500. Throw in the $154,000 Kyrgios earned for his first-round win over Liam Broady, and he will bank a healthy $491,500 for two weeks’ work at Melbourne Park – more than the $340,000 he earned for reaching the 2015 Australian Open quarter-finals. Aus Open 2022 – Snapshot None of this is likely to be important to Kyrgios, who prioritises entertainment over winning – but not to the extent that he’ll make a fool of himself. “I think I played pretty good tennis in the past. I’ve beaten pretty much every player that’s picked up a racquet,” Kyrgios said. “I’ve obviously had to play a certain level of tennis. It’s not like I’m going out there putting on a clown suit and creating a circus. “I have also played, won titles, won big titles, I have played the traditional way.” As for who deserves favouritism, it’s a prickly question for both camps. The unseeded pairing of Ebden and Purcell bristled at questions likening this final to the Australia v Australia A cricket matches in the 1990s – where the star-studded world-beaters were pitched against a side of young guns, but one that was still considered the second-tier team. “Who is Australia and who is Australia A? Because we’re the underdogs,” said Purcell. Ebden stepped in to ramp up even more pressure on their high-profile opponents – who don’t have the doubles rankings to show for their heavy-metal performances this week. “They have higher singles rankings right now.

Brunt gets some movement in, takes the inside edge into thigh pad and spits off it sharply. Beaumont at short leg has little time but gets her left hand to it and hangs on. Brilliant from England! 4th over: Australia 10-1 (Haynes 4, Mooney 6) Shrubsole is making Mooney play with almost every delivery. Last ball of the over Mooney drives fluently, beating the dive of mid off for four. 3rd over: Australia 6-1 (Haynes 4, Mooney 2) Brunt booming another inswinger into the pads of Haynes, but there was bat on that. The bowler almost talks Knight into a review but not quite. Haynes defends well, soft hands into the ground to get through the over. 2nd over: Australia 4-1 (Haynes 2, Mooney 2) Anya Shrubsole sharing the new ball of course, finding swing immediately. Haynes and Mooney pick up a couple of runs with little drives but it looks fraught. 1st over: Australia 1-1 (Haynes 1, Mooney 0) Another belter beats Mooney two balls after she arrives. Will it be the Brunt show again? What a start! A pair for Alyssa Healy, and it’s Brunt who gets her again. In the first innings Healy chased one. This time the ball is angling in, Healy has to play, then it swings away and leaps off the surface to take the edge through to the keeper. Not much Healy could do about that. So ends a truly remarkable performance by Heather Knight. Cross runs off the field, leaving Knight to walk off solo and enjoy the spotlight on 168 not out, over 56% of her team’s runs. Sophie Ecclestone with 34 at No10 was the only other player to make over 15. Knight didn’t give a chance, barely made a mistake, and kept her calm through 103 overs of batting, taking the deficit from 333 when she walked in to 40 when she walks off. Well played. It’s all over! Not sure why Cross feels the need to take on a pull shot from Perry, especially just after clipping a high full toss through the leg side for four. But that’s what Cross does. Top edge to deep backward square. And here’s Darcie Brown again, so good across the ground. Dives forward and takes a belter of a catch. 105th over: England 292-9 (Knight 167, Cross 7) Apparently Cross was dropped in the previous King over. Edged a cut shot that Healy put down. She’s missed a few chances in this match. Knight in this over is looking to attack. Plays the reverse but straight to deep third and turns down the single. Tries to loft but hits it to mid on, and then mis-hits over short cover for a run. Cross says, I’ll show you how it’s done. Clatters a cut shot for four. 104th over: England 287-9 (Knight 166, Cross 3) McGrath to Knight, with Mooney standing at a very short straight mid-off, about halfway down the pitch. Not sure I would want Mooney standing in front of the bat like that with a broken jaw and no helmet. Knight cuts the second ball for a single. The field closes in for Cross, who wafts, then drives solidly for none. Ignores the final wide drag-down. The deficit is 50 runs. 103rd over: England 286-9 (Knight 165, Cross 3) Knight facing King, five in the deep protecting the boundaries. Knight tries to drop it softly enough towards deep midwicket that she can get back for two, but Gardner’s arm is a rocket and the throw lasers back to the keeper. Would have been a run out for sure. Cross on strike survives the last four balls though. 102nd over: England 285-9 (Knight 164, Cross 3) Knight takes on another big drive to the deep, fielded on the cover boundary. Two runs, then a single. McGrath gets four balls to work at Cross, two slips and a gully with a short cover and short midwicket catching. Can’t get her out. The field spreads for the sixth ball to offer her a single, but she misses a ball that goes off the thigh pad to slip. England trail by 52. 101st over: England 282-9 (Knight 161, Cross 3) Alana King comes on to bowl her leg-breaks, and Knight looks like she’s changing modes a bit here. Late cut down to deep third, where Sutherland fumbles over the rope. Steps down and lofts two runs over mid-off, then plays an aggressive sweep but it’s fielded in the deep. Drinks. 100th over: England 273-9 (Knight 152, Cross 3) Lovely start from Cross, clipping her first ball out through midwicket for three runs, just saved by a slide on the rope. Knight happily takes a single next ball. It could well be in England’s interest to get bowled out here. Get bowling in these conditions. The closer they get to Australia’s score, the longer Australia will have to bat before setting a target. McGrath delivers! Straight ball, cannons into the pad and Ecclestone reviews in faint hope but is wandering off the field before the decision is upheld. Hitting middle stump, three reds. 99th over: England 267-8 (Knight 151, Ecclestone 34) Knight squeezes a single from Jonassen through the leg side, then Ecclestone cuts, off the bottom edge, and the ball should bounce back onto her stumps but the spin she imparts from the edge of the bat makes the ball turn past off. She still looks dicey. Gets a single to raise the hundred partnership though. 98th over: England 267-8 (Knight 150, Ecclestone 33) Tahlia McGrath comes on, having not bowled since early in the day yesterday, and she has Ecclestone dropped at slip. Lanning again. That was a tough chance though, diving full length to her right. Can’t reel it in. No run from the over. 97th over: England 267-8 (Knight 150, Ecclestone 33) There’s the 150 up for Heather Knight, who enjoys it but only briefly acknowledges it. Clobbers Jonassen’s spin over wide long-on with the slog sweep. Two Test tons for Knight, both over 150. 96th over: England 262-8 (Knight 146, Ecclestone 32) Knight and Ecclestone cut the deficit down to 75 now, Knight hooking Perry down through fine leg before a couple of singles. 95th over: England 255-8 (Knight 141, Ecclestone 31) Another first-ball single, this time Knight glancing Sutherland, who follows up with a wide. Another Ecclestone prod outside the stumps evades an edge. Then another. Stop fishing! 94th over: England 254-8 (Knight 140, Ecclestone 31) Knight gets a single away, and Ecclestone plays a few swishes outside off stump. Looking a bit dicey, Knight might want to settle her down. 93rd over: England 253-8 (Knight 139, Ecclestone 31) We’ve seen several well timed cut shots this morning, but they’ve all gone behind point and been nicely stopped in the cordon. Sutherland finishes the over by cutting the ball into Ecclestone, banged on the front pad and the Australians send it upstairs. Looks a chance for sliding down to me, and the review says umpire’s call on leg stump. 92nd over: England 253-8 (Knight 139, Ecclestone 31) Ellyse Perry taking it back to the traditions of Test cricket, bowling an eight-ball over. A wide and a no-ball in there, as well as Ecclestone dropping a ball into the big gap on the leg side to scamper through. 91st over: England 250-8 (Knight 139, Ecclestone 30) Sutherland isn’t finding the outside edge per se, but keeps finding the outside half of Knight’s bat. A couple of shots sliced away behind point. Ecclestone spices things up by using the inside edge for a run. 90th over: England 246-8 (Knight 136, Ecclestone 29) Perry’s in, with that distinctive bound of hers. Three slips, gully, looking to force another mistake. Knight drives a single, Ecclestone survives the straighter ball. 89th over: England 244-8 (Knight 135, Ecclestone 28) Sutherland now, and Knight is beaten again twice on the trot. The second delivery prompts a bit of interest after a noise is heard. Lanning doesn’t review - good decision, there’s a gap between bat and pad. Knight then finds the boundary for the first time today with a wonderful cover drive and this partnership is now worth 75. 88th over: England 240-8 (Knight 131, Ecclestone 28) Here we go then. Lanning leads Australia onto the pitch under overcast skies at Manuka before Perry takes the ball and play resumes. Knight takes guard and there’s immediately two, nicely played off her legs into the gap on the on side. A single through the off side follows before Ecclestone is dropped in the slips by Lanning, who might be distracted by Mooney diving across her. A mistake from the Australians who have been very good to this point. Perry then delivers a beauty to beat Knight all ends up. An action-packed opening over. And here is the daily podcast with me and Isabelle Westbury if you’d like some more detail for quarter of an hour about how the day panned out. Have to say, we’ve had two outstanding days of Test cricket. Really hope the rain has less influence than projected from here. Here’s my match report from yesterday for you to catch up. Lots of conjecture about day three, starting some days ago. Yes, there BoM forecast still says there is a high chance of thunderstormy rain today. It also says that it should be an afternoon thing. It rained a bit here in Canberra last night, but this morning is rain-free and humid and cloudy, just like yesterday morning when the swing bowlers went so well. There is rain on the radar but it’s in patchy bits here and there, so who knows what will or won’t find Manuka. For now it looks like the day should start on time. Hello world. It is day three of the women’s Ashes Test, and we have a contest on our hands. England looked done and dusted yesterday at 120 for 6 in replay to 337 for 9 declared, but Heather Knight played her finest Test innings to reach 127 by stumps. She’ll resume this morning with Sophie Ecclestone on 27, and two wickets in hand, to try to narrow the deficit from its current 102. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a dominant position for Australia. But instead of England being blown away short of the follow-on mark, the visitors could now at least push the hosts to make some difficult decisions about how to play the match from here.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08bcdeda3344abc59b98e98ccdd5edf92a5be0a3/0_92_2771_1664/master/2771.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=966f6514315f9d4d39da05d126cfe845","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Barty party at Australian Open or can Collins crash celebrations?","link":"https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2022/01/29/barty-party-at-australian-open-or-can-collins-crash-celebrations/2038309","keywords":["australian open tennis","ashleigh barty"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MELBOURNE, Jan 29 ― World number one Ashleigh Barty will look to become the first Australian woman for 44 years to win her home Grand Slam today, but to do it she needs to get past a rejuvenated Danielle Collins in the form of her life.

MELBOURNE, Jan 29 ― World number one Ashleigh Barty will look to become the first Australian woman for 44 years to win her home Grand Slam today, but to do it she needs to get past a rejuvenated Danielle Collins in the form of her life.American Collins faces a daunting task in the women's singles final on Rod Laver Arena in front of Barty's fiercely partisan Australian Open crowd. But the resurgent American is ready to tackle the top seed, and clear favourite.Collins was in “the zone” and almost flawless as she pummelled Polish seventh seed Iga Swiatek into submission in the semi-final.Now the 28-year-old knows if she can find the same sweet spot on Saturday that she has a huge chance.“I think for me when I have a really clear idea of my tactics and what I want to do, it's easier for me to get there,” said the 27th seed, who is playing pain-free in Melbourne for the first time in years after emergency surgery last April for endometriosis.“But then, you know, just like any other athlete and I think all of us on tour, you know, we have days where we try to get in the zone and we can't.”The big-hitting Collins will need to bring more than just raw power to counter the tactical nous of Barty, who has been rampant so far, winning 20 of 21 sets this year.As Jessica Pegula put it after losing to the Australian in the quarter-finals: “I think she's definitely living in everyone's head a little bit.”Collins has pushed Barty hard in their previous four matches, winning their last encounter in Adelaide 12 months ago in straight sets.As well as feeling the weight of Collins' fearsome groundstrokes, Barty could also buckle under the expectation at her home Slam.She is the first Australian woman into the decider in Melbourne since Wendy Turnbull in 1980 and is aiming to become the first winner since Chris O'Neil in 1978.The two-time Grand Slam champion ― at the 2019 French Open and Wimbledon in 2021 ― appears relaxed and ready to accept the extra pressure.“I'm able to switch off when I'm not here on site and that makes the time when we are on site more enjoyable, more special, and then we switch on and get ready to go,” said Barty.A talented Australian multi-sportswoman who also played professional cricket, Barty has demonstrated her ability to “problem-solve” while on court, a trait she has worked on with coach Craig Tyzzer.That will again come into play against Collins, who is not just one of the game's hardest hitters, but also one of its most passionate and emotional characters in stark contrast to the unflappable Barty who it seems barely sweats.“It's going to be a challenge for me to try and neutralise as best that I can,” said Barty.“I think the challenge is going to be trying to get her off-balance.” ― AFP","pubDate":"2022-01-29 00:03:49","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"malaymail"},{"title":"The childhood training drill that unlocked Barty","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/tennis/australian-open-2022-ash-barty-childhood-training-secret-revealed/819eecd1-8bc3-454b-9b37-3d1794bb94fd","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ash Barty is renowned for her well-rounded and versatile game.

It moved from player-coach to a player-coach/mentor relationship. Jim helped guide Ash through what can be a difficult period for a talented athlete in any sport, that time where a talented teenager is pulled in various directions by academies and governing bodies.They mean well and are going by the book, but sometimes they don't understand the athlete in question. Well I can tell you, Jim understood and even though he ruffled a few feathers along the way, he helped guide Ash and the Barty family through a period of many challenges. One of the best things Jim did was have Ash play adult fixtures from an early age. Ash was a seven-to-eight year old playing against grown men at a very high standard each Thursday night.By the time Ash was 10, some of the biggest servers in the fixture comp didn't hold back when playing her. I remember one player named Zoran who would hit a serve around 190km/h, and Ash would have no problem getting the ball back into play. She was already learning back then how to combat a players power game on the other side of the net. READ MORE: Medvedev's biggest 'regret' over explosive umpire spatREAD MORE: The real reason behind Rafael Nadal's semi-final tearsThe all-court game and the famous sliced backhand was developed by Jim at an early age as well. Not a lot of people know this, but quite often when Ash was on a break, including during the time she left the game to play cricket, she'd often be seen at West Brisbane Tennis Centre helping out with coaching and hitting with the young kids. Ash has always remained grounded and level-headed and has never forgotten where she came from.Ash has had great guidance throughout her career. From Jim to the likes of Jason Stoltenberg. She has learnt from many to help turn herself into the best player in the world.Ash often talks about her team, they are perfect for her.

It moved from player-coach to a player-coach/mentor relationship. Jim helped guide Ash through what can be a difficult period for a talented athlete in any sport, that time where a talented teenager is pulled in various directions by academies and governing bodies. They mean well and are going by the book, but sometimes they don't understand the athlete in question. Well I can tell you, Jim understood and even though he ruffled a few feathers along the way, he helped guide Ash and the Barty family through a period of many challenges. One of the best things Jim did was have Ash play adult fixtures from an early age. Ash was a seven-to-eight year old playing against grown men at a very high standard each Thursday night. By the time Ash was 10, some of the biggest servers in the fixture comp didn't hold back when playing her. I remember one player named Zoran who would hit a serve around 190km/h, and Ash would have no problem getting the ball back into play. She was already learning back then how to combat a players power game on the other side of the net. READ MORE: Medvedev's biggest 'regret' over explosive umpire spat READ MORE: The real reason behind Rafael Nadal's semi-final tears The all-court game and the famous sliced backhand was developed by Jim at an early age as well. Not a lot of people know this, but quite often when Ash was on a break, including during the time she left the game to play cricket, she'd often be seen at West Brisbane Tennis Centre helping out with coaching and hitting with the young kids. Ash has always remained grounded and level-headed and has never forgotten where she came from. Ash has had great guidance throughout her career. From Jim to the likes of Jason Stoltenberg. She has learnt from many to help turn herself into the best player in the world. Ash often talks about her team, they are perfect for her. The team headed up by Craig Tyzzer do a terrific job and are perfect for Ash, on and off the court. Stream every match, every court of the Australian Open live and free on 9Now I'll be cheering for Ash tonight and if she wins I'll shed a tear for her. Those that have known her for a long time will know the hard work and sacrifice she's put in. I'll also be proud of my mate, Jim Joyce. He'll be courtside tonight and will be the proudest man inside Rod Laver Arena should Ash Barty win the Australian Open final. Go Ash!

The world number one has steam rolled her way to the final without dropping a set, with American Danielle Collins awaiting at the Rod Laver Arena. Barty has faced no trouble in getting to the Australian Open finalGetty Australia have been waiting for female finalist since Wendy Turnbull lost in the 1980 final, and she will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of greats like Evonne Goolagong and Margaret Court, who dominated in the 1960s and 1980s. Goolagong has particularly provided inspiration to Barty over the years and it will be a proud moment for indigenous Australians all over the country. Barty has Ngarigo ancestry through her father’s side and she regularly speaks about her heritage and what it means to her. During the Australian Open, she said: “I’m a very, very proud indigenous woman. I love my heritage. It’s what connects me to all of you here today. It’s what connects me to the land.” On Goolagong, she added: “We’re connected through our heritage and she’s paved a path for so many Indigenous youth coming up, both in her career and also in her work off the court.” Barty is already a two-time Grand Slam winner, claiming the French Open in 2019 and Wimbledon last year, but you feel like this is the tip of the iceberg of what she can achieve. The 25-year-old is able to dominate any player in the world on the court and her fun personality makes her a popular figure, not just in Australia but the wider world. Barty has been winning tennis tournament since she was a childInstagram Barty has regularly spoken of how inspiring Goolagong has beenGetty Barty was a junior Wimbledon champion who turned pro shortly after her 14th birthday and there were clearly big things predicted of her career. But just as her career was still in its fledgling stages, she decided to take a break from tennis in 2014 and took up professional cricket. “It was too much too quickly for me as I’ve been travelling from quite a young age,” Barty later admitted. “I wanted to experience life as a normal teenaged girl and have some normal experiences.” Although she had no competitive cricket experience, she showed what an incredibly talented sportswoman she is. Barty played professional cricket during her break from tennisGetty She played in the inaugural Women’s Big Bash League for Brisbane Heat, and impressed in several matches for the team. Just to give you some idea of her ridiculous sporting talent, she also has a golf handicap of 3.9. By 2016, the lure of tennis pulled her back in and she returned to the WTA Tour and quickly started climbing the rankings. She won the US Open in doubles in 2018, before going on to win her first Grand Slam the following year before COVID-19 hit and derailed things. The world number one decided to take the rest of 2020 off after tennis had been called to a halt, due to concerns about global travel amid the pandemic. The Barty story is inspirational to so manyGetty She made her return in 2021 to win Wimbledon as she made up for the time she missed. Barty takes no prisoners on the court, happily dispatching opponents 6-0, 6-0 if the occasion calls for it. But her demeanour off the court is the polar opposite. She shares a laugh and a joke in her interviews, while is regularly seen playing cricket even if it is minutes before going out to a Grand Slam semi-final. Chris O’Neil was the last Australian women to win the Grand Slam back in 1978, while Turnbull lost the final in 1980. There has been more finals misery on the men’s side with Pat Cash losing back-to-back finals in 1987 and 1988, while Lleyton Hewitt was beaten by Marat Saffin in 2005. The eyes of a nation will be on party in the Australian Open finalGetty There is an enormous amount of pressure on Barty, but she was taking everything in her stride after winning her semi-final in double quick time. “It’s unreal, it’s incredible,” said the relaxed Queenslander. “I love this tournament.

A half-century from Teague Wyllie was the catalyst for Australia's innings of 7-276 in their quarter-final at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua and Barbuda. Pakistan's run chase never got going and they were dismissed for just 157 in the 36th over, as wickets fell at regular intervals. After being asked to bat first, Australia got off to a flyer with Wyllie and Campbell Kellaway providing the solid foundation before Corey Miller and captain Cooper Connolly contributed valuable runs. Paceman William Salzmann was the chief destroyer with the ball as five different players took wickets to seal a comfortable passage to the last four. Three-time tournament winners Australia will face India or defending champions Bangladesh on Thursday morning (AEDT) for a place in the February 6 final. Wyllie top-scored for Australia for the third time in four matches in the Caribbean, his 71 off 97 balls complemented by Kellaway's 47 as the openers put on 86 runs in 16.4 overs. No.3 Miller (64) played his part in a 101-run partnership with Wyllie before Connolly chipped in with 33 and Salzmann cracked a rapid 25 to round out the innings. West Australian Wyllie has scored 264 runs at an average of 132 in the Caribbean, with his outstanding form in four innings including an unbeaten century against Scotland in their final group game. Australia's bowlers ensured the comprehensive win was never in doubt as scoreboard pressure proved too much for Pakistan to handle. Salzmann took 3-37 from seven overs, including the final wicket to wrap up proceedings, while Tom Whitney (2-31) and Jack Sinfield (2-34) provided valuable support.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5487435/dee0b41e0df4cc135967f5e03ff6bebdd39e7506-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow"},{"title":"India, Bangladesh face off in all important quarters","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/india-bangladesh-face-off-in-all-important-quarters-726807","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Skipper Dhull, 4 others recover ahead of match but Sindhu tests Covid +ve","content":"India, Bangladesh face off in all important quarters India, Bangladesh face off in all important quarters Osbourn (Antigua): Covid-hit India will be bolstered by the return of key players, including skipper Yash Dhull, when the record four-time champions meet holders Bangladesh in the third quarterfinal of the U-19 Cricket World Cup here on Saturday.Most of the half a dozen India players, who were affected by the dreaded virus, have recovered and are set to feature in the crucial clash. However, Nishant Sindhu, who was stand-in captain of the team, has tested positive and will miss the match. He will be replaced by Aneeshwar Gautam in the squad. Six players -- Dhull, his deputy Shaik Rasheed, Sidharth Yadav, Aaradhya Yadav and Manav Parakh -- had returned positive RTPCR tests before the Ireland game. All of them are available for Saturday's game. Dhull and other infected players reached Antigua on Friday morning after undergoing seven days of isolation in Trinidad. \"They have been medically deemed fit to play. They have a day or so to train and be game ready,\" an ICC source told PTI. They had gone into isolation ahead of India's second league fixture against Ireland, dealing a big blow to the record four time champions. Five of them tested positive in the RTPCR tests and also ended up missing the last league game against Uganda. However, the depth in the squad ensured India won both those games comfortably and qualified for the quarterfinals as group toppers. Sindhu led the side in Dhull's absence as India struggled to field 11 fit players on the park in the game against Ireland. \"Most of the players have recovered and should be fit enough to play tomorrow,\" a BCCI official told PTI. Both Dhull and Rasheed are important batters for the team and had looked in good touch against South Africa in their tournament opener. Opener Angkrish Raghuvanshi and all-rounder Raj Bawa's confidence must be sky high after they scored match winning tons against Uganda. Left-arm spinner Vicky Ostwal has been India's stand out bowler in the tournament with seven wickets. Another left-arm spinner Sindhu has been tidy with the ball, taking four wickets at an economy rate of 2.76 runs per over. The Bangladesh batters will also not have an easy time negotiating the extra pace of Rajvardhan Hangargekar. The game will be a rematch of the previous edition's final in 2020 when Bangladesh had stunned the favourites to win their maiden title. Current Bangladesh skipper Rakibul Hasan was part of that memorable final. In the recently held Asia Cup semifinal in the UAE, India had outplayed Bangaldesh and gone on to win the title. Bangladesh's entry into the knockouts here wasnt as smooth as India's. England outplayed them in the first game before they qualified with wins over Canada and UAE.

The International Cricket Council said Taylor had admitted to four breaches of its anti-corruption code and a separate charge of violating the global governing body’s anti-doping code.

Taylor’s violation of the ICC’s anti-doping code, which is separate from the anti-corruption charges, resulted from an in-competition test conducted in September 2021 following Zimbabwe’s match against Ireland. The batsman tested positive for the stimulant benzoylecgonine, a cocaine metabolite, which is specified as a “substance of abuse” under the code. Former Zimbabwe cricket captain Brendan Taylor. Source: AFP He was given a one-month ban, which will run concurrently with his other suspension, meaning he will be free to resume playing on July 28, 2025. “Brendan is a former international captain who represented Zimbabwe for 17 years,” said Alex Marshall, general manager of the ICC’s Integrity Unit. “Over such a long career, he participated in numerous anti-corruption and anti-doping education sessions and knew exactly what his obligations were under the ICC anti-corruption and anti-doping codes. “It is disappointing that a player of his experience chose not to fulfil those obligations. However, he has accepted all charges, which has been reflected in the sanction.” Sensational Scorchers claim BBL Title! | 01:20 Taylor, Zimbabwe’s second-highest run-scorer in one-day cricket, issued a statement on his Twitter account on Monday revealing that he faced a long ban from cricket. The 35-year-old, who retired in September, said he was invited by an Indian businessman in October 2019 to travel to India to discuss “sponsorships and the potential launch of a T20 competition in Zimbabwe and was advised that I would be paid USD$15 000 for the journey”. The invitation came when the team had not received salaries for six months, he said, and there were concerns the country would not be able to continue playing international matches. Taylor said he was a “little wary” but made the journey and while there he took cocaine after he was offered it by the businessmen and his colleagues.

Spot-fixing refers to the illegal fixing of a specific part of a match for betting purposes. Taylor said he was “cornered” and accepted a $15,000 sum that he was told was a “deposit” for spot fixing. He took the cash so that he could fly out. It took him four months to report the offence to the ICC but he stressed he had never been involved “in any form of match-fixing”.

The World Giants have been thoroughly dominant throughout the season. Having won three of their four fixtures, they finished the league stage as table-toppers. Having lost their tournament-opener, the Giants bounced back to win all their following games. They registered a five-run victory over the India Maharajas in an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Batting first, the World Giants put up a massive 228-run total. Herschelle Gibbs was the top scorer for the Giants, scoring a quick-fire 46-ball 89.

The Asia Lions have won two of their four league stage matches.

The Asia Lions may not have ended the group stage on a winning note. However, they are a formidable side and will be keen to take the field on Saturday. Batting first, the Lions registered a modest 149-run total. Asghar Afghan was the top scorer, scoring a 26-ball 41.

Picture: Simone De Peak A NEW $39 million art gallery ... how lucky are Novocastrians? Since Thursday's announcement that a joint funding arrangement would ensure the completion of a project 17 years in the making, I've scarcely been able to contain my excitement. But then, as is so often the case, a lightbulb flashed inside Sporting Declaration's head. Without wanting to sound like Oliver Twist, greedily requesting another bowl of gruel, here's a random idea from outside the square. How about instead of spending the best part of $40 million at No.1 Laman Street, that cash was directed towards building a new grandstand at No.1 Sportsground? But what about the art gallery, you ask? Don't worry, I'm not saying we just give those cultured types the Basil Brush. I reckon you'd build a pretty decent grandstand for $40 mill, which would presumably include at least one level specifically for corporate entertainment. That floor could be divided by those fancy retractable walls, creating a host of smaller function rooms. Then, when we're not hosting Test matches, one-day internationals, Big Bash League clashes and AFL blockbusters, the walls would be retracted to create a spacious art gallery. Of course, there would be a bit of work before sporting fixtures in boxing up all the artworks (careful with the sculptures) and stashing them temporarily in storage downstairs, alongside the groundsman's heavy roller. But where there's a will, there's a way, and sharing is caring. OK, OK, I know what you're thinking. This bloke is obviously a neanderthal with no appreciation of the finer things in life. Well that's where you're wrong. I'm actually an award-winning artist. True story. The precise details of how I ended up studying (for want of a better word) art in high school for a year or so have faded over the course of time. But I have vague recollections of being a dismal failure in the technical-drawing elective that my father insisted I enrol in, and by the time I dropped out, there were no vacancies in woodwork (which might explain my home-handyman skills, or lack thereof). Somehow I ended up in the art class, in which I was required to submit a major project. I settled for a painting of a rugby league player, funnily enough, which basically involved using tracing paper to copy the centre-spread poster in Rugby League Week (Manly's try machine Phil Blake). My art teacher then suggested dividing the initial etching into thirds, so that it was two parts black-and-white, with the middle in full colour. The finished product at least bore some vague resemblance to what was originally intended, and on a whim, I submitted it in that year's Bathurst Show. I finished (controversially) runner-up in whatever category it was I entered, and received a ribbon and $2 prizemoney for my efforts. (In those days $2 was nothing to be sneezed at.) So to cut a long story short, I feel eminently qualified to comment about art and culture and, for mine, you could turn a decent-sized tin shed into an art gallery. All you really need is a bit of space and some walls on which to hang the paintings. A stadium capable of hosting top-level cricket, on the other hand, needs a certain standard of facilities for both players and fans. And despite Newcastle City Council claiming to have spent $8 million on a yet-to-be-completed upgrade at No.1 Sportsground, it still doesn't measure up. I ventured in to inspect No.1 the other day with my own eyes, and I can't help wondering if council have spent $8 million polishing a you-know-what. Sure, there are new sightscreens and new floodlights (apparently not up to broadcast requirements), and a new concrete slab on which spectators can sit, if indeed there are any events that attract spectators. Apparently the playing surface has been expanded, the drainage improved and a new wicket square installed, although I wasn't aware that these were pressing issues. Unfortunately we won't be hosting any big-time cricket here until the change rooms have been given at least a fresh coast of paint. Anyway, I guess beggars can't be choosers and local cricketers and AFL players will be able to enjoy the benefits when it eventually re-opens, after almost three years as a construction site. Those weekend warriors, however, might again have to vacate the premises if council decides No.1 is the perfect venue to stage another rock concert during the Supercars weekend. The big race has been postponed because of COVID, but I see the Supercars CEO is \"100 per cent\" certain it will return later in the year. I'm not 100 per cent certain 100 per cent of Novocastrians will welcome that news. I'd be intrigued, incidentally, to establish how many of the 14,000 tourists per year who the powers-that-be are predicting will flock to visit our new art gallery also attend the Supercars. What's the cross-over ratio? I guess what it goes to show is that Newcastle is a multicultural metropolis, catering for all demographics. Unless, that is, you're a cricket fan. In which case Coffs Harbour is only a four-hour drive.","image_url":"https://transform.newsnow.io/transform/v1/crop/frm/AFKkRPHwQbXhqFfb42nFTx/5e338f18-fd48-40dc-9226-b376e77681c6.jpg/r0_373_4648_2991_w600_h338_fmax.jpg","source_id":"newcastleherald"},{"title":"Longest six in Cricket: Tom Kohler-Cadmore hits 108m six vs Quetta Gladiators in PSL 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-longest-six-in-cricket-tom-kohler-cadmore-hits-108m-six-vs-quetta-gladiators-in-psl-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Peshawar Zalmi","PSL","PSL 2022","Quetta Gladiators","Tom Kohler-Cadmore"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Longest six in Cricket: Tom Kohler-Cadmore hits a gigantic six during Peshawar Zalmi versus Quetta Gladiators match in PLS 2022.

During the second match of the ongoing seventh season of the Pakistan Super League between Quetta Gladiators and Peshawar Zalmi at the National Stadium in Karachi, Peshawar’s wicket-keeper batter Tom Kohler-Cadmore hit a humongous 108 meters six off Gladiator’s left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz to leave the commentators slack-jawed. The event happened during the first delivery of the 6th Over bowled by Nawaz. Bowling from around the wicket, the off-spinner bowled a tossed-up half-volley delivery to which the English batter threw the kitchen sink to slog-sweep it high into the night sky, towards the mid-wicket area. The ball landed just inside the stadium, underneath the roof as the distance of the maximum read 108m on the giant screen. However, it was Nazaw who had the last laugh, as he dismissed the English uncapped batter for the score of 22 (16), with another tossed-up delivery, this time outside the off-stump only for the ball to hit the bat’s toe-end to hand a simple catch towards the fielder at Backward Point. At the time of writing, the match is slightly titled in favour of Peshawar, with another 49 runs required off 32 deliveries. Skipper Shoaib Malik (23* off 19) and Hussain Talat (41* off 21) have added 65* (36) runs for the 4th wicket so far en route the score of 190/4 posted by the Quetta Gladdiators. Earlier the Gladiators’ opening pair of Will Smeed (97 off 62) and Ahsan Ali (73 off 46) stitched together a 155-run partnership- the third-highest opening partnership in the PSL. Out. Of. The.
