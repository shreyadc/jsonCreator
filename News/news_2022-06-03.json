His team reached stumps on 116 for seven, having earlier dismissed the world champions for 132. But Stokes was out for just one in a fast-moving final session, as England collapsed from 59 without loss to bring the tourists back into contention. Much of the damage was done by Durham fast bowler Matt Potts, who removed New Zealand captain Kane Williamson with his fifth ball, and finished with four for 13 on his Test debut before leaving the field with cramp. Matt Potts insists England will show some resolve when they resume vs New Zealand on Friday Momentum is with New Zealand – who have England 116-7 after a topsy-turvy day one at Lord’s ‘We’re still in a contest to win a game of Test cricket here,’ he said. ‘We’ve got three wickets left, and we’re going to attack the second day. We’re going to throw our punches. If they throw us two, we’ll throw them four.’ Potts described his ‘elation’ after having Williamson caught behind for two to leave New Zealand 12 for four. ‘I mean, it was absolute elation. A Test debut at the home of cricket, in the pinnacle format, and then to get the New Zealand captain out fifth ball. I was absolutely over the moon and can’t put into words really how that feels. I know it probably meant an awful lot to me, and an awful lot to my family as well.’ A few hours later, Potts was out for a duck as England slid to 100 for seven. ‘Yes, it was a rollercoaster,’ he said. ‘Yes, I wanted to take the boots off and just put the feet up, but then again I’m batting eight.’ New Zealand fast bowler Kyle Jamieson, who started England’s slide by removing Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope, said: ‘We knew we had to bowl well.

It was just a pity their old failings with the bat came back to haunt them. The seamers bowled a fuller length, the fielders caught everything, with Jonny Bairstow setting the tone at third slip to catch Will Young, and the bowlers didn’t overstep once, where recently they’ve been taking wickets with no-balls. But no matter how much good work Stokes did in the first half of the day, he was reminded in the second half that England’s Test batting is still a big issue. There’s plenty of work still to be done – technically, mentally and positionally. Many of the things England have been doing wrong in the field over the last 17 Test matches they got right on Ben Stokes’ (second right) first day as full-time captain at Lord’s on Thursday The seamers, like the recalled James Anderson (above), bowled fuller and didn’t overstep once And the fielders caught everything, with Jonny Bairstow (left) setting the tone at third slip For instance, having Ollie Pope batting at No 3 for the first time was never going to be straightforward. But this is a structural, long-term problem, and it’s not going to be solved overnight. Until that dreadful final session, there were reasons to be cheerful. Cricket is fundamentally a simple game, and for too long England have been over-complicating it. For example, I liked the fact that Brendon McCullum said he wasn’t going to do rotation: he’d simply pick the best team in front of him for each game. He and Stokes weren’t too fussed either about having a longish tail, with no Chris Woakes to bridge the gap at No 8. They’ve chosen their best six batters, and their best four bowlers. Of course that doesn’t mean you’re necessarily going to have the opposition 45 for seven after losing the toss. But it gives you every chance of competing. There was a lot about Stokes’s tactics to enjoy. Yes, he got Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to bowl a full length, but he also backed them with the right fields. He kept three men on the leg side so they didn’t hide the ball outside off, and he kept mid-off in to ensure they stayed full. Stokes also used fellow Durham lad Matthew Potts (left) well on his Test debut for England He also kept cover point open for Tom Latham, the experienced New Zealand opener, and posted five slips. He was dangling a carrot, asking Latham to find the gap – he took it, and edged to Bairstow. Then there was the way he used Potts. He could have given Broad an extra over or two in the first hour, but brought Potts into the attack on his debut at the Nursery End – the right end for him – and he immediately looked comfortable, removing Kane Williamson with his fifth ball. Stokes also took emotion out of the equation. Like him, Potts is a Durham lad, and you could see how thrilled Stokes was with each of his three wickets in the morning. But he didn’t introduce him straightaway after lunch, when he must have suspected Colin de Grandhomme and Tim Southee would go after the bowling a bit, and gave the task instead to the wise old heads, Broad and Anderson. When Stokes did go back to Potts an hour after lunch, he took a wicket with his first ball. It was a day when the bowling changes worked nicely for the new captain. His demeanour impressed me as well. He also put faith in trusted lieutenants Stuart Broad (left) and Anderson (right) to take wickets But although you can change the regime, you cannot change England’s fragility with the bat It’s easy for a captain to look calm when your opponents are collapsing in a heap – less so when they’re counter-attacking, as a good side like New Zealand were always going to do at some point. Stokes can be an expressive cricketer, but he kept a cool head throughout. He looked as if he was enjoying himself, too. At one point, Potts did a Broad-like celebrappeal for an lbw shout – and Stokes seemed to take the mickey. That kind of thing can be infectious. It was also good to see Zak Crawley reap the benefits of some technical changes with his hands – he’s gripping the bat less tightly, as Joe Root does – only for his old nemesis, the booming drive, to prove his undoing. After that, it was a familiar story, I’m afraid. You can change the regime, it seems, but not England’s fragility with the bat.

The first day of the ongoing opening Test match between England and New Zealand at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground was dominated completely by the fast bowlers after as many as 17 wickets fell at the cost of mere 248 runs. After opting to bat first, Kane Williamson’s men got off to a poor start as they lost three of their batters with only eight runs posted on the scoreboard. The English pace attack made sure that the initial jolt handed to the Kiwi batters did not go in vain, as James Anderson and debutant Matty Potts bagged four-fers to skittle the batting order for mere 132/10 in 40 Overs. In reply, the English openers – Zak Crawley (43) and Alex Lees (25) stitched a 59-run opening stand, and looked like they would be all over New Zealand like a rash with a massive first innings lead. However, the tables turned real quick as the middle order fell like a pack of cards, with the scorecard reading 116/7, and a 16-run deficit yet to be erased. Joe Root, who was mere 111 runs away from becoming only the second English player, and overall the 14th in the world to breach the 10,000-run mark in Test match Cricket, was out cheaply at the score of 11, as he nicked one off Colin de Grandhomme straight to Gully. Overall, Root has featured in 118* Test matches (217 innings) for England, and has amassed a total of 9,900 runs at an average of 49.00, with the assistance of 53 half-centuries and 25 centuries.

And it’s not like we weren’t warned, either. When Rob Key decided Brendon McCullum was the ideal head coach to pair with Stokes, the director of men’s cricket told folks to “buckle up and get ready for the ride”. An opening day of 17 wickets and 248 runs played out to the burbling hum of Lord’s, initially dominated by the hosts but with New Zealand fighting back in the final session, certainly met that billing. England collapse after Potts begins new era with blitz: first Test, day one – as it happened Read more Indeed, come the close it was the tourists in the ascendancy, atoning for a rusty performance in which they were rolled for 132 in 40 overs by reducing England to 116 for seven from 36 in reply. Zak Crawley had played a princely 43 only to fall to the latest booming drive of his nascent Test career, while Alex Lees dug in for 25. But otherwise it was a string of low scores as Kyle Jamieson, Tim Southee and Trent Boult ran amok. This startling late collapse of seven for 41 had simply continued the gripping mood of a first innings in which the returning Jimmy Anderson and the impressive debutant Matt Potts took four wickets apiece, Jonny Bairstow made three fine catches, and play stopped at 23 overs so the ground could applaud the life of Shane Warne . There was also a nasty tumble over the boundary rope that forced poor Jack Leach to be subbed out of his first home Test in two years with concussion symptoms. While the latter incident meant Matt Parkinson had to hare down the motorway from Manchester to make an unexpected Test debut, arriving at 5.30pm with his side batting, it may be best to go back to the start. Stokes walked out for the toss alongside Kane Williamson, eschewing the captain’s blazer; instead he chose to wear a Test shirt with the name and cap number of Graham Thorpe on the back, a touching tribute for the team’s former batting coach who remains seriously ill in hospital . Williamson called correctly but things went south for the visiting skipper thereafter, the world champions living down to pre-series fears about their readiness by crumbling to 12 for four in the 10th over and 39 six by lunch. However good the menu may be at the Home of Cricket – a choice of lamb rump or grilled halibut for the players on this first day – one suspects it probably could have tasted better for the visitors. But then New Zealand are such a phlegmatic bunch, perhaps they were able to rationalise all this. After all, they had come up against two stellar operators in Anderson and Stuart Broad, veterans desperate to prove a point after the nonsense of their absence from the Caribbean tour, plus county cricket’s form horse in the flinty-eyed Potts. And as it later proved, there was a bit on offer out there for the seamers. England’s Matt Potts, pictured bowing at New Zealand’s Trent Boult, enjoyed a dream-like start to his debut at Lord’s before the afternoon’s travails. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Certainly Anderson and Broad hit a rich groove with the new ball, the pair bowling the lengths that Joe Root was still demanding during the final days of his captaincy to vaporise New Zealand’s top order. Anderson was up and running in just his second over, too, Will Young poetically falling to a man who turns 40 next month after he edged an outswinger to the cordon and Bairstow grasped a diving one-hander to his left. Bairstow’s follow-up in the fifth over was no less spectacular, taking a diving rebound off his own initial fumble after Tom Latham’s drive off Anderson. The Yorkshireman’s third was at least less stressful with Devon Conway, a double-centurion on debut at this ground 12 months ago, struggling with Broad’s angle from around the wicket and presenting a simple low catch. Potts could seldom have wished for a better position from which to enter the fray at first change, nor a more dream-like start to his Test career thereafter. Hustling in from the Nursery End, his fifth ball nipped away from Williamson, feathered the edge and offered Ben Foakes his first dismissal at home. Happy Days for young Pottsy, if you will. The 23-year-old from Sunderland certainly offered a point of difference from the big two, even if he operates at a similar pace. He hit the splice hard from back of a length in the main – this method forcing Daryl Mitchell to chop on to his stumps to make it 27 for five – with the fuller delivery the sucker ball that accounted for Tom Blundell, bowled offering no shot, and the tailender Ajaz Patel lbw during the afternoon. Anderson bouncing out both Jamieson and Southee in between meant he and Potts were vying to make the honours board. But in the end a dose of cramp forced the younger man off the field two balls into his 10th over, with Stokes taking over and claiming the final wicket of Boult. So far, so very good for the new England captain. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Come stumps, however, the all-rounder was pondering the same issues that dominated the winter and forced England’s regime change. Though Boult and Southee squandered the new ball, the introduction of the giant Jamieson changed the complexion of events: he profited from Crawley’s latest error of judgment, teased a tame poke behind from Ollie Pope on seven, and allowed his colleagues to pile in. Among them was Colin de Grandhomme, who after carving a useful 42 with the bat ended Root’s first innings back via an edged cut to third slip. It was the first of five wickets to fall for just eight runs, with Southee trapping Lees lbw and nicking off Stokes with an outswinger, and Boult then knocking over Bairstow and Potts with Foakes looking on from the non‑striker’s end. After a promising start to the new era, England had somewhat buckled.","pubDate":"2022-06-02 18:23:52","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90961d5bc94832d1ff741813c2fc0bb2abf0e7c8/0_112_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a666897e78d15fc3c9658d31b6814456","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England v New Zealand: 17 wickets fall on day one at Lord's","link":"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/20184967.england-v-new-zealand-17-wickets-fall-day-one-lords/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"ENGLAND began the Ben Stokes era with a chaotic day of cricket Lord’s, with 17 wickets tumbling on a frantic start to their first Test against New Zealand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-02 18:18:55","image_url":"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/resources/images/13846285/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"thenorthernecho","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England crumble with the bat after skittling New Zealand on day one of first Test at Lord's - Sky Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvbmV3cy8xMjEyMy8xMjYyNjIxOS9lbmdsYW5kLWNydW1ibGUtd2l0aC10aGUtYmF0LWFmdGVyLXNraXR0bGluZy1uZXctemVhbGFuZC1vbi1kYXktb25lLW9mLWZpcnN0LXRlc3QtYXQtbG9yZHPSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England crumble with the bat after skittling New Zealand on day one of first Test at Lord's  Sky SportsEngland v New Zealand: Jonny Bairstow takes three early catches at Lord's  BBCEngland collapse after Potts begins new era with blitz: first Test, day one – as it happened  The GuardianDurham's Matthew Potts enjoys dream debut for England  The Northern EchoRemember the Name!

He will take over from Mominul Haque, who resigned as captain on May 31. He was leading the side since October 2019. Batter Litton Das has been named as Shakib's deputy, the vice-captain of the team. \"What I have discussed - or, what we have discussed - and learnt is that he [Shakib] is available to play, After the series against West Indies, we have a series against Zimbabwe. Shakib is uncertain for that series, and it is unclear how long Shakib will remain the captain for....,\" said the BCB president. \"I had three names. The people responsible for (selecting the captain) had their discussions and gave me three names - one of them would be the captain and one of the others would be the vice-captain. If Shakib had refused the captaincy, we would have turned to the other two. We wanted to appoint both the new captain and the vice-captain. And after the preliminary discussions, we decided to have Shakib Al Hasan as the captain and Litton Das as the vice-captain,\" he added. During Haque's tenure, the results did not go in Bangladesh's favour. The team won only three tests, lost 12 and drew two. His own batting form suffered as a captain. In six Tests so far in 2022, he has scored 162 runs at an average of 16.20. \"When you play well, even if the team does not win, you are still in a position to motivate them. I felt that captaining a side is tough when I am not scoring and team is not winning,\" said Haque at time of announcing his resignation. Shakib, 35, has been in numerous stints as Bangladesh's Test captain, first leading the side in a game against West Indies in 2009. He led the side for six more matches in the first half of 2010, and again in August 2011 against Zimbabwe, before he fell out of favour with the then BCB chief Mustafa Kamal. In December 2017, Shakib took over Test captaincy again and replaced Mushfiqur Rahim. He carried on with the role for almost two years before being banned for a year in 2019 for failing to report a bookie's approach. Shakib's future in Test cricket has been a hot topic of discussion for a while. In February, Shakib had reportedly asked the BCB for some time off from the longest format of the game, but was included in squad for the tour of South Africa. Shakib, suggested that he was \"jaded\", and requested the board for a break from international cricket, which was eventually granted to him. Later, Nazmul Hassan publicly questioned Shakib's commitment to his country and, after another round of meetings between the allrounder and Hassan, Shakib was added to the squad for South Africa. But he missed out on the Test series due to illness in his family. In the home series against Sri Lanka, Hasan finished as the highest wicket-taker for his side. Lanka had won the series 1-0. Hassan also confirmed that former Indian opener Wasim Jaffer and former Australia batter Stuart Law will join the Under-19 coaching team. \"Our Under-19 [men's] coaching staff will have Stuart Law and Wasim Jaffer. Stuart Law will be the head coach and Wasim Jaffer will be BCB's batting consultant. We can use them in various capacities,\" he said.

The England pace bowling battery featuring its veteran pacers – James Anderson and Stuart Broad, and the debutant Durham Pacer Matty Potts, have handed their side a massive advantage within hours of the start of the three-match Test series at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground. While Anderson (16-6-66-4) and Broad (13-0-45-1) struck with the new, red cherry right away, Potts (9.2-4-13-4) dismissed the Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson (2) in his very first Over of international Cricket, to kick-start his debut appearance. Ultimately, all the New Zealanders could manage was a paltry score of 132/10 in mere 40 Overs. England leading Test run scorers The England innings got off to a decent enough start with their openers – Alex Lees (25 off 77) and Zak Crawley (43 off 56) stitching a 59-run stand in quick time. However, with the addition of mere 37 runs from there on, the Kiwi quicks have roared back into the contest in some style, dismissing four of their batters with a deficit of 35 runs (at the time of writing) still staring at them. The Lord’s crowd, who had been waiting for the arrival of England’s former Test skipper Joe Root, were handed a major disappointment from the latter, as he nicked one off Colin de Grandhomme straight to Gully, at the score of 11. It is worth of a mention that Root was mere 110 runs away before the start of his innings today, to become only the second English batter in Test Cricket to complete 10,000 runs. #OnThisDay in 2013, Joe Root made his first Test hundred, in front of his home crowd at Headingley.

Because if anyone can defend the indefensible, it’s BT Sport’s refereeing expert. I am still scratching my head to understand how Karim Benzema’s Champions League final ‘goal’ was ruled out for offside. And once Walton had been called in to clarify matters for TV viewers, everything was as clear as mud. “It’s actually an easy one,” insisted the former Premier League official before giving the most complicated explanation imaginable. And after listening to him wittering away about Fabinho’s tackle being an accidental backwards deflection rather than a deliberate attempt to play the ball, I understood only one thing. I don’t know the rules of football any more. After the best part of 40 years watching and reporting on the sport, that is quite some confession. But I’m certain I’m not the only one who is struggling to comprehend laws which are making a simple game as incomprehensible as cricket and Rugby Union. Confirmation of those suspicions arrived the day after the Champions League final, when Huddersfield were denied two penalties during their Championship play-off defeat by Nottingham Forest. FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS Their first claim was open to debate because Harry Toffolo went down very easily when he brushed the outstretched leg of Jack Colback. But there was absolutely no doubt that Lewis O’Brien was fouled by Max Lowe as Huddersfield pressed for a late Wembley equaliser. Yet VAR Paul Tierney refused to get involved and I can only assume he didn’t want to embarrass Jon Moss in his final match before retirement. So now Moss has seen his record shop trashed and suffered online death threats while Huddersfield are left to complain about missing out on the £200million jackpot that comes with promotion to the Premier League. Burnley know exactly how they feel after the ridiculous penalty awarded against Ashley Barnes which condemned them to defeat by Spurs and took the wind out of their sales as they battled to beat the drop. It was another decision that was justified on a technicality by the rulebook aficionados but one that left the rest of us gobsmacked. So now there is talk of the Premier League clubs contemplating a move to oust referees’ chief Mike Riley from his position as general manager of the PGMOL. But Riley, as useless as he is, doesn’t make the changes to the rules which leave so many decisions open to interpretation. That’s down to the International Football Board, who meet again in two weeks’ time to decide how they’re next going to bugger things up. And the fact that they’re convening in Doha suggests it will be something that none of realises is an actual thing until it wins the World Cup for Qatar. HAD to laugh when I read about Gareth Bale’s gruelling week of flying first class between Madrid, Paris, Wroclaw and Cardiff. Because let’s be honest, he can’t exactly be knackered by the 20 minutes of football he has played for club and country in the last two months. Maybe it’s the strain of lugging his £650,000-a-week salary around which has proved such a strain. It still hasn’t prevented him from being awarded an MBE in this week’s Jubilee Honours list, though. Presumably for his services to the banking sector. IN an interview to preview the Champions League final, Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold declared: “I can see things others can’t see.” What a pity he couldn’t see Vinicius Junior sneaking in behind him to score Real Madrid’s winning goal. But he wasn’t the only one at the Parc des Princes suffering from blurred vision. The French interior minister who blamed the shambolic handling of the match on ticketless Liverpool supporters was even more blind to reality. The organisation was so bad that even Boris Johnson is now calling for an investigation. And we all know how seriously he takes official inquiries. But I’m guessing that the King of Spain and Rafa Nadal weren’t kettled and tear gassed by le Parisian riot police as they made their way to their posh seats. Odd that. THE only thing that could possibly make the Monaco Grand Prix interesting is a spot of Riviera rain to test the skill of the drivers. But when the heavens opened up in Monte Carlo on Sunday, race officials delayed the start until the track had dried out and still went off behind a safety car. The inevitable outcome was less of a race and more of a procession, free from overtaking and decided by the quickest pit crews. It is hard to think of any other sport which shoots itself in the foot more regularly than Formula One. WITH no major tournament to distract us, it’s going to be a very long summer of transfer speculation. The good news is that every foreign player who says they won’t sign a new contract with their club will be a transfer boost for Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea. And every player who joins someone will be a transfer blow. YOU almost have to admire the obstinacy of the French Open refusing to use Hawkeye to settle disputed line calls. Why use modern technology when you can rely on the umpire jumping down from his chair to examine scuff marks in the clay? Especially when TV then uses that technology to show viewers where the ball actually landed. IT’S good to see head of world athletics Lord Coe signing the sport up to the declaration for clean air campaign. Because with so many of the world’s best athletes taking asthma medication, it’s easy to understand why the IAAF are so concerned about pollution levels.","pubDate":"2022-06-02 17:10:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Saha yet to take a call on new team after seeking NOC from Bengal","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/saha-bengal-ranji-trophy-noc-gujarat-titans-ipl-2022/article38500011.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Shayan Acharya"],"video_url":null,"description":"Wriddhiman Saha admits that he has spoken to quite a few state units and will formally seek a No-Objection Certificate from the Cricket Association of Bengal after he informed the state unit that he is not willing to play the Ranji Trophy knockouts.","content":"Wriddhiman Saha has made up his mind to quit Bengal, but the wicketkeeper-batter is yet to decide on his new destination. He admits that he has spoken to quite a few people from several state units, but is yet to zero in on a particular team. “Since I had made up my mind that I won’t play for Bengal, I had informed (the Cricket Association of Bengal president Avishek Dalmiya) over phone. But I will meet him in person and finalise the formalities,” Saha told Sportstar, indicating that he will soon formally seek a No-Objection Certificate (NOC). Saha had earlier informed the state unit that he is not willing to play the Ranji Trophy knockouts, beginning on June 6. Soon after the Bengal squad for the Ranji knockouts was released by the CAB, Saha had a long conversation with Dalmiya, where he indicated that he may no longer play for Bengal. READ | Saha unwilling to play Ranji Trophy knockouts He was upset with comments by a senior CAB official, who had raised questions over Saha’s commitment after he decided to skip the group stage of the Ranji Trophy due to personal reasons. Last week, he even exited the Bengal team's WhatsApp group, despite coach Arun Lal having a word with the India international. While his wife Romi had earlier indicated about Saha’s possible exit from Bengal, the cricketer had remained quiet. But on Thursday, he broke his silence. “For me, too, it is a very sad feeling that I have to go through something like this after playing for Bengal for so long. It is disappointing that people make such comments and question your integrity. As a player, I had never faced such a thing in the past, but now that it has happened, even I need to (move on),” Saha added. There were speculations that he could shift to Gujarat next season. However, Saha remained tight-lipped. “I have spoken to a lot of people, but no decision has been taken yet. There is still time left for next season…” After being left out of the Indian Test team for the home series against Sri Lanka in March, Saha went to the Indian Premier League and had a successful stint with the champion side Gujarat Titans. Opening the innings for Titans alongside Shubman Gill, Saha amassed 317 runs. “I just went to the IPL to contribute to Gujarat Titans and help them win. I am glad that we won the title, but I am not thinking too much about what will happen next or what should have happened. My job was to perform and I just did that,” Saha added. READ | Saha's participation in doubt despite being named in Bengal's Ranji squad After spending two and a half months in the bio-bubble, Saha now wants to spend quality time with the family and go on a vacation. Looking back at his stint with Gujarat Titans, Saha only has fond memories. “It was one happy unit, where we could express ourselves and communicate. There would be open sessions over breakfast or meal or even during team sessions, where all of us spoke to each other about our plans and vision,” he said. “It was not just about communicating with Hardik (Pandya) or Ashish Nehra. We spoke with everyone and there was an exchange of ideas. That approached us in reaching our goal as a unit and we all knew what the plan would be…” After opting for Matthew Wade as the opener for the first five games, the team management brought Saha in and he did not disappoint. “Every match is important for a team. While one match can actually be a decisive moment in a player’s career, it also plays a huge impact on the team’s rankings in the points table. So, we had to take every match that way and play accordingly,” Saha said. “When a team goes into the auction, they pick players with a certain idea. I think they had considered Wade as a first-choice wicketkeeper-opener. He obviously performed really well in the T20 World Cup, and maybe that's why initially the team management went ahead with him. But later, to set the combination right, I was chosen. I have tried contributing to the team’s success in every possible way…” In his long career, Saha has played for several franchises - including Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings - but with Titans, he got an opportunity to express himself and play with an open mind. That helped him score runs and contribute to the team’s title win.","pubDate":"2022-06-02 16:43:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka Cricket appoints Lasith Malinga as bowling strategy coach for white ball series against Australia","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/sri-lanka-cricket-appoints-lasith-malinga-as-bowling-strategy-coach-for-white-ball-series-against-australia-1957663-2022-06-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lasith Malinga appointed as bowling strategy coach for white ball series against Australia","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-02 16:05:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Great display boys”: Jofra Archer praises England bowlers as they rattle the Kiwi batting order during ENG vs NZ 1st Test match at Lord’s","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-great-display-boys-jofra-archer-praises-england-bowlers-as-they-rattle-the-kiwi-batting-order-during-eng-vs-nz-1st-test-match-at-lords/","keywords":["Cricket","England","jofra archer","Lord's Test","New Zealand","New Zealand tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Jofra Archer praises England bowlers as they run over the New Zealand batting line-up to gain advantage on the opening day of the first Test.

During the first day of the ongoing opening Test match between England and New Zealand at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground , the English pace battery were all over the Kiwi batting line-up like a rash, as they bundled them up for a paltry 132 in mere 40 Overs, to gain a massive advantage early on in the three-match series. The return back of the veteran fast bowling duo of James Anderson (16-6-66-4) and Stuart Broad (13-0-45-1) reaped fruit right away, as they managed to send three of their batters back in the hut before the 8-Over mark, assisted by some excellent catching by Jonny Bairstow in the slip cordon. However, the star of the day so far was the debutant pacer from Durham – Matty Potts, who picked up the prized wicket of Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson (2) in his very first Over in international Cricket to kick-start, what turned out to be a blistering spell of pace bowling. There was no looking back for the 23-year-old from there on, as he rattled the middle-order to end up with his first innings bowling figures of 9.2-4-13-4. With an unbeaten 42*(50), Colin de Grandhomme was the highest run-scorer for New Zealand, with the four English pacers getting rid of their entire batting line-up. England fast bowler Jofra Archer, who has been ruled out of the entire ongoing season due to a lower back stress fracture, took to his ever famous Twitter handle, to compliment the English pacers for a rare excellent exhibition of collective fast bowling after quite some time.

As far as the ongoing Lord’s Test is concerned, England have further asserted their dominance in match proceedings with a 59-run stand for the first wicket between Alex Less and Zak Crawley at the time of writing.","pubDate":"2022-06-02 15:58:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Openul Francez: Iga Swiatek este supusă unui test riguros împotriva adolescentului chinez Zheng Qinwen | știri din tenis","link":"https://www.obiectivtulcea.ro/openul-francez-iga-swiatek-este-supusa-unui-test-riguros-impotriva-adolescentului-chinez-zheng-qinwen-stiri-din-tenis/","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["Sidony Cato"],"video_url":null,"description":"Iga Swiatek face un pas uriaș în cursa ei aparent necruțătoare către Campionatul feminin de...","content":"Iga Swiatek face un pas uriaș în cursa ei aparent necruțătoare către Campionatul feminin de la French Open, după ce s-a calificat în trei seturi împotriva adolescentului chinez Zheng Qinwen; Cap de serie o va întâlni în continuare pe americanca Jessica Pegula, în timp ce Veronica Kudermetova o va înfrunta pe Daria Kasatkina. Ultima actualizare: 30.05.22 20:01 Iga Swiatek a trecut prin primul ei test real, dar capul de serie a avansat în sferturile de finală la French Open. Iga Swiatek s-ar putea să-și fi extins seria de victorii la 32 de meciuri, dar numărul unu mondial a fost testat sever pentru acreditările la French Open de către adolescentul chineză Zheng Chen Wen. Cap de serie a luptat dintr-un set jos pentru a o învinge pe Zheng cu 6-7 (5-7) 6-0, 6-2 în două ore și 45 de minute și a păstrat cursul pentru a câștiga al doilea titlu în trei ani la Roland Garros. Cheng a salvat cinci puncte de set și s-a luptat cu 5-2 pe drum pentru a câștiga primul set al tiebreak, dar o accidentare la picior i-a împiedicat șansele și Swiatek a profitat din plin de avantaj. Tânăra de 20 de ani s-a luptat cu cea mai lungă serie neînvinsă din Turul feminin de la 34 de victorii consecutive ale Serenei Williams în 2013. „Ea joacă un tenis grozav”, a spus Swiatek despre Cheng. „Am fost surprins de unele dintre loviturile ei, așa că o felicit. Este un turneu greu. Mă bucur că am reușit să revin după un prim set frustrant. „Sunt mândru de mine pentru că sunt încă în campionat. „Sferturile de finală sunt o cursă stresantă, așa că sper să o pot reduce”. Swiatek va prelua Jessica Pegola Următoarea, după ce americanca a luptat dintr-un început dificil pentru a câștiga cu 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 româncei Irina Camelia Bego pentru a se califica în sferturile de finală ale ei de Grand Slam la rând. Rușii, interziși de la Wimbledon, fac tot posibilul la Paris Veronika Kudermitova Și-a revenit dintr-o cădere de set pentru a învinge Madison Keys cu 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 și a ajuns pentru prima dată în sferturile de finală ale unui Grand Slam. „Am încercat să cred în mine și să cred. Asta a fost cheia mea”, a spus a 29-a semințe, Kudermetova. „Uneori am încercat să joc mai greu, alteori mai inteligent. M-am descurcat foarte bine astăzi.” Kudermetova o va înfrunta pe colegul ei rus Daria Kasatkina pentru un loc în semifinale după ce numărul 20 mondial a avansat la un sfert de finală de Grand Slam pentru prima dată în patru ani, cu o victorie dominantă 6-2 6-2 asupra Camila Giorgi în 1 oră 20 de minute pe terenul Susan Lenglin . „Fără greșeli”, a spus Kasatkina când a fost întrebat despre planul ei de joc. „Camila este o jucătoare foarte aprigă și este foarte greu să joci împotriva ei”.

During the first day of the ongoing opening Test match between England and New Zealand at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground , the New Zealanders were bundled out for a paltry 132 in 40 Overs, after their skipper Kane Williamson opted to bat first. It was the veteran English pacer James Anderson who proved his pedigree with the new ball yet again, as he dismissed both the Kiwi opening batters – Will Young (1 off 2) and Tom Latham (1 off 17) within the first five Overs of the match itself to provide his side a perfect start to the series. After Stuart Broad dismissed the left-handed Devon Conway (3 off 7) as well during the eighth Over, it was time for the debutant pacer from Durham, Matty Potts, to hog all the limelight as he picked up the prized wicket of Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson (2 off 22) in his very first Over of international career. There was no looking back for the 23-year-old from there on, as he rattled the middle-order to end up with his first innings bowling figures of 9.2-4-13-4.

With an unbeaten 42*(50), Colin de Grandhomme was the highest run-scorer for New Zealand, after an excellent bowling and fielding effort from England under their new full-time skipper. New Zealand’s 132/10 is no where near their list of lowest scores in a Test match innings.

After the tourists won the toss and decided to bat first, they found themselves in the sorry depths of 39 for six at lunch before being bowled out for just 132 shortly after with Durham seamer Potts the star of the show. New England skipper Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum couldn’t have scripted the first session of their partnership any better as their seamers tore New Zealand’s upper order apart. Matty Potts marks taking the wicket of Daryl Mitchell in a dream start to his England career Potts (right) took three wickets in the morning session and celebrates with captain Ben Stokes New Zealand captain Kane Williamson was Potts’ first victim in Test cricket for England After recalled duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad softened the tourists up, 23-year-old Potts claimed the prize scalp of captain Kane Williamson with only his fifth delivery in Test cricket, caught behind by wicketkeeper Ben Foakes for just two runs. That left New Zealand reeling on 12 for four and that became 27 for five when Potts forced Daryl Mitchell into playing on after he made 13 from 35 deliveries. And Potts’ fine start to life with England continued when he bowled Tom Blundell for 14 for the sixth wicket, before claiming the ninth wicket after a failed LBW review from Ajaz Patel to cap off his fine start to life in England’s bowling attack. Earlier, Anderson, clearly relishing his return to the fold after being dumped along with partner-in-crime Broad for the tour of the West Indies, removed both openers with the help of Jonny Bairstow. Jimmy Anderson showed his class once again upon his return to the England Test side Jonny Bairstow took a one-handed catch off James Anderson’s bowling to remove Tom Latham England celebrate the early wicket of New Zealand opener Will Young on the first morning Will Young lasted just two balls before he edged the veteran Lancashire seamer behind and Bairstow got down to pull off a stunning one-handed catch at second slip. Bairstow then produced another grab – at the second attempt – to dismiss Tom Latham for one off Anderson’s bowling. Not wishing to be left out, Broad took the third wicket to dismiss Devon Conway, with Bairstow pouching a more regulation catch this time as New Zealand were seven for three. Potts then proved his worth in the field after lunch, with England keeping New Zealand down as the debutant took catches off Anderson’s bowling to dismiss Kyle Jamieson with the tourists on 45 and Tim Southee at 86. New Zealand’s tail threatened to wag, before Ben Stokes took the final wicket thanks to a smart catch from Ollie Pope at mid-wicket. Broad took Conway’s wicket after New Zealand collapsed early on despite opting to bat England though were not without their worries. In the morning session spinner Jack Leach had to leave the field after just over half an hour of play when he landed on his head and neck when stopping a boundary. The England spinner was replaced on the field by Harry Brook but under the concussion protocols, England have called Matt Parkinson into their side for the remainder of the match. Potts then also had to depart the field injured after appearing to pull a calf muscle after lunch, with the debutant having been seen stretching the muscle at the start of bowling an over. But the morning session was just the lift England so desperately needed after a dismal run of just one win in their last 17 Tests, spanning five consecutive series defeats. Jack Leach landed awkwardly while saving a boundary in the opening session of the first Test Leach has symptoms of concussion and has been withdrawn from the Test against New Zealand Stokes’ first act as the country’s 81st Test captain was to lose the toss, but everything else fell into place as ball dominated bat in the opening exchanges. Stokes and McCullum were both clear that recalling Anderson and Broad was their first priority of their reign, overturning a controversial decision to drop the pair in the West Indies, and 39-year-old Anderson needed just seven deliveries to reopen his record tally. Challenging Will Young with just enough swing from a full length, he took the outside edge and saw Bairstow leap into action at third slip, diving low to his left to pull off a one-handed stunner. England have been weak in the cordon for some time, but Bairstow’s handiwork was flawless here. The Yorkshireman juggled his next attempt when Tom Latham nicked the metronomic Anderson, but he clung on at the second time of asking to make it two for two. Stokes rushes to embrace Potts after he took the wicket of Tom Blundell, his third wicket Not to be outdone for long, Broad was rewarded for a consistently attacking length when Devon Conway made it three in a row for the alert Bairstow as optimism surged around the old ground. Having seen the seasoned duo set the tone, Potts then made the case for the next generation. The Durham seamer struck gold with his fifth delivery in the international arena, with Kiwi captain and star batter Kane Williamson edging low to keeper Ben Foakes to leave his side 12 for four. Potts continued his impressive start and grabbed another two before the break, Daryl Mitchell (13) playing into his own stumps and Tom Blundell losing his off stump to one that nipped back. Potts departed with caution late in New Zealand’s innings, appearing to pick up a calf injury Anderson bowls to Kyle Jamieson with five slips in place as England attacked after lunch Anderson eventually took the wicket of Jamieson for his second dismissal of the day The 23-year-old left the field with figures of three for eight in eight overs, a superb introduction. Anderson had a point to prove having been recalled and he starred after lunch, tempting Jamieson with a loose shot that looped high to Potts at fine leg. Southee then tried to attack the 39-year-old but he too was caught out by the same trap after finding himself dismissed in almost identical fashion to Jamieson after scoring 26 from 23 balls. Potts returned to the attack to dismiss Patel for seven, with a delivery that was given out for LBW following a review from the tourists that was optimistic at best when it showed the inswinger was clearly hitting middle and leg. New Zealand hit what could be a handy 30 runs for the final partnership, with final man Boult dismissed for 14 after Pope dived low to his right to leave England in a strong position heading towards tea.

Unbeaten Sheeraz who has KO’d 11 of his 15 opponents is the 69th fledgling fighter to pick up the Boxing Writers’ Club’s much-sought-after trophy. Hamzah Sheeraz is back in action this summerRichard Pelham / The Sun My Club colleagues deserve a pat on the back for their ability to recognise the potential in young talent over seven decades. Since 1951, 28 of the shy youngsters who were voted Best Young Boxer fulfilled their early promise and justified the faith in their ability by winning world titles. Among them are many of Britain’s all time greats including Randy Turpin – who was the first – Ken Buchanan, John Conteh, Joe Calzaghe, Barry McGuigan, Nigel Benn, Naseem Hamed and Amir Khan. It’s worth pointing out that 32 of those who didn’t manage to reach the ultimate were still good enough to be British and European champions.

He has his first starring role when he makes his debut top-of-the-bill appearance defending his WBC silver belt against experienced Argentine Francisco Torres, at the Copper Box, Stratford, on July 16. Physically Sheeraz reminds of Tommy Hearns – at 6ft 3in he’s built like a hairpin but just like the “Hit Man” he carries considerable power in his lean frame which will get more lethal when he reaches his full adult strength. Carl Frampton, Belfast’s two-time world champion is one of his most enthusiastic admirers and after seeing him in action a couple of years ago said “If he doesn’t win a world title I’ll eat my hat.” Most read in Boxing On demand What games are live on Premier Sports and how much does it cost?

Hearn plans Fury vs Joshua for December despite Gypsy King announcing retirement SUN BINGO GET £50 BONUS & 50 FREE SPINS TODAY Hamzah who started boxing when he was eight years old explaining why he turned pro at at just 18 said: “I never set sights on being an Olympian or going to world amateur championships. I just didn’t have much interest in it. Winning pro titles is just so much more appealing to me.” For more than 100 years the sons of immigrants have always been the backbone of boxing in this country – Ted ‘Kid’ Lewis, Lloyd Honeyghan, Maurice Hope, Conteh, Hamed, Calzaghe and Khan are classic examples. Sheeraz looks likely to keep up that proud tradition and he certainly has an interesting Heritage – his father’s family hail from Pakistan and his mother is Indian – Hamzah laughingly says “I’m there to keep the peace.” Hamzah one of Khan’s distant cousins is trained by American Ricky Funez , in Los Angeles and he spends three months there before every fight which costs him £50,000. Money he says that’s well spent because of the high quality of sparring he gets in La La Land. I said how refreshing it was that so many kids of Asian descent were now taking up boxing and asked him if it’s because they are inspired by Khan’s illustrious career. He said “That has got something to do with it but mainly it’s the result of a change in parental attitude. “Asian parents always emphasised the importance of education because they wanted their sons and daughters to be doctors or lawyers. “ “Now they can see their children can benefit their lives through sports like boxing.” But he added “It’s not easy for us South Asians to break through like Amir.” It won’t surprise many to know Sheeraz – who lives in Ilford – inevitably has been the victim of racism. Going to his car after a training session he found a threatening note on the windscreen which read “Don’t park here again” along with an obscene racist slur. Hamzah said “It wasn’t the best thing to come back to but it takes a lot to break me. I will carry-on spreading positivity and love and try to get these bitter people to understand we all bleed red.” Read More on The Sun NOT FUNNY BGT's Amanda Holden makes blunder about disabled contestant Eva Abley JOR DROPPING Hollyoaks' Jorgie Porter sends fans wild as she goes topless in swimming pool With Sheeraz’s family background – his father Kamran played county cricket for Gloucestershire – it’s a wonder his ambition was to walk out at Lords rather than climb into a ring. If all goes to plan it will be cricket’s loss and boxing’s gain. And there will hundreds of his vociferous fans from the Asian community at the Copper Box ringside next month making as much noise as they do when applauding a Pakistan or Indian test century.","pubDate":"2022-06-02 14:16:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Who is Matthew Potts, the bowler who dismissed Kane Williamson in first over on Test debut - all you need to know","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/england-vs-new-zealand-1st-test-matthew-potts-dismisses-kane-williamson-in-first-over-on-debut-all-you-need-to-know-about-him-2469852.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Potts comes from Durham and has also played U-19 cricket for England.
