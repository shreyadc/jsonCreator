While Ponting thought India’s tactics were incorrect on the first day, he was impressed with their second-day fightback, as they bundled out Australia for 469. On the second day in London, Siraj was a big motivator for India’s improved performance with the ball, with the right arm embracing the challenge of bowling to Australia’s powerful batting line-up – and picking up four vital wickets. Siraj peppered Australia’s lineup of quality bats with short-pitched offerings and even participated in a few mid-pitch staring competitions, which excited Ponting. “I loved seeing that and he looks like the ultimate competitor. Maybe sometimes he gets carried away and goes a little bit over the top, but you need those guys in your side when things aren’t going well. He was the one today who said I am going to be the guy that is going to turn things around and what I loved was that his pace didn’t drop at all during the whole innings,” Ponting told International Cricket Council (ICC). “From the first ball yesterday morning until late this afternoon, his pace was hovering around that 86 or 87-mile-and-hour mark and that says a lot about a great attitude,” he added. Siraj was the pick of the bowlers, but all four quicks were excellent, as was Ravindra Jadeja. The Indian top-order collapsed yet again even as the Australian attack overcame a comeback partnership by Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane to take firm control of the WTC final on Day 2 at the Oval in London on Thursday.

Australia have dominated the majority of the opening two days of the ‘Ultimate Test’ at The Oval on the back of centuries from batters Travis Head and Steve Smith and outstanding bowling performance from their pacers, while India have majorly struggled to come to terms with the tricky pitch and English conditions that they are facing at The Oval. Australian attack ripped through India’s top order to leave Rohit Sharma’s lead side five down and still trailing by 318 runs at the time of stumps on Thursday, clearing most of the momentum India had gained from taking in a much-improved bowling display. At the close of play on Day 2, India had posted 151/5 at The Oval on Thursday. “Our score was not as good as we were expecting because our openers failed to score well. Ajinkya Rahane is still on crease and is playing well, we expect to perform better tomorrow and bounce back in the match. Opting to bat or bowl depends completely on the condition. I hope our team plays well and brings the WTC Cup home,” BCCI Vice President Rajiv Shukla told ANI. Coming to the match, At the close of play on Day 2, India had posted 151/5 at The Oval on Thursday. KS Bharat (5*) and Rahane (29*) were unbeaten at the crease as the stumps were drawn at the end of the final session. India started the final session at 37/2, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli unbeaten in the middle. India reached the 50-run mark in 13.4 overs. Pujara looked confident, smashing Green for a four. But a few overs later, the bowler had the last laugh as he struck timber that had been left exposed by Pujara, sending him back for 14. Virat continued building the innings with Ajinkya Rahane, as the Indian dressing room set its turnaround hopes on them. But Virat fell for 14 to a Mitchell Starc delivery, which reared up from a length and hit the batter’s glove. The catch went straight into Steve Smith’s hands at the slip cordon. India were reduced further to 71/4. Following this, Rahane resumed the innings with Ravindra Jadeja. Jadeja looked to be in fine fettle, striking some elegant drives. He took India to 100 in 24.5 overs. The duo marched to a 50-run partnership with their positive intent. Half of India’s line-up was inside the hut, however, as Jadeja was dismissed for 48 off 51 balls after edging a Nathan Lyon delivery to Steve Smith. India was 142/5 and the 71-run partnership with Rahane was broken.KS Bharat came to the crease at the fall of Jadeja’s wicket and he and Rahane took India to the 150-run mark on the final ball of the day. Despite a comeback by Indian pacers, Australia strengthened their position in ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final as they dismissed both Indian openers in the second session of the second day of Thursday after scoring 469 runs. At Tea, India’s score read 37/2, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli unbeaten. Australia started the second session at 422/7, with Alex Carey (22*) and skipper Pat Cummins (2*) unbeaten. Umesh Yadav started the session with a maiden over. Carey played some aggressive strokes, smashing Mohammed Shami for three fours in the 113th over. With Carey’s six in the next over, Australia crossed the 450-run mark in 114.3 overs. However, on the very next ball, Ravindra Jadeja trapped Carey leg-before-wicket for 48, which came off 69 balls and consisted of seven fours and a six. Australia were 453/8. Cummins took the proceedings further with Nathan Lyon. But Mohammed Siraj castled Lyon for nine to get his third wicket. Australia were 468/9. With this, Siraj also reached 50 Test wickets. Siraj took the final wicket as well. Cummins gave a catch straight to Ajinkya Rahane at extra cover after scoring nine runs. The Australian innings ended on 469. Siraj was the leading wicket-taker for India, taking 4/108 in 28.3 overs. Shardul Thakur took 2/83 in 23 overs. Shami took 2/122 in 29 overs. Jadeja got one wicket. When India came out to bat, openers Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma sought to give a solid start, both striking some elegant shots. But the budding partnership was cut short at 30 when skipper Rohit was trapped lbw by Pat Cummins for 15. Skipper got the skipper and the scoreline read 30/1 in six overs. Cheteshwar Pujara was next on the crease. But Scott Boland gave India another heavy blow as Gill was dismissed for 13. Gill was looking to leave the ball, but left his stumps exposed and the ball went through them. India was 30/2 in 6.4 overs. The experienced duo of Virat Kohli and Pujara took India through the remainder of the session without any further loss. Earlier, tight bowling spells from the pace trio of Mohammed Siraj, Mohammed Shami and Shardul Thakur helped India make a comeback in the first session of the second day. At lunch, Alex Carey was batting on 22 and Pat Cummins on 2. Australia started the day at the overnight score of 327/3 with Steve Smith (95*) and Travis Head (146*) unbeaten. The duo started the second day with positive intent and Smith smashed two straight fours in the first over of the day to bring up his 31st Test hundred, his seventh in England. Head also brought up his 150 in just 164 balls. Australia brought up the 350-run mark in the 90th over. Mohammed Siraj struck early in the session to give India the much-needed breakthrough. Head was caught behind by KS Bharat for 163 (174 balls). His knock consisted of 25 fours and a six. Australia were 361/4. Mohammed Shami dismissed Cameron Green for six runs as he was caught by Shubman Gill at slips. Next, it was Shardul Thakur who got the key wicket of Smith for 121 (268 balls). Australia were 387/6 in 98.1 overs and crossed the 400-run mark in 102.5 overs. Axar Patel, who had come to the field as a substitute, made an immediate impact by running out Mitchell Starc for just five runs. India continued to build pressure on the lower order with their pace, but Alex Carey and skipper Pat Cummins put up some solid resistance to it carrying Australia to the lunch without further damage. Australia had ended the first day on a high at 327/3 with Steve Smith (95*) and Travis Head (146*) unbeaten. India had restricted Australia to 76/3 but Head-Smith put on a solid partnership to put Australia in a strong position.

China’s ambassador to Australia will toss the coin. On the night before the game, the league will launch the book Celestial Footy: the Story of Chinese Heritage Aussie Rules by author Patrick Skene at the Swans’ new headquarters at the Royal Hall of Industries. The book explores the little-known history of Chinese involvement in the sport, starting on Ballarat’s gold fields. A total of 2500 tickets have been provided to Universities Australia for distribution, presumably to international students who may not have been to an AFL match live. Swans chairman Andrew Pridham wants this game to help grow the sport in Sydney’s Chinese community. According to the 2021 census, 11.6 per cent of people in Sydney nominated Chinese ancestry. “So it’s a significant part of the population,” Pridham said. “We already have very strong following from Chinese origin people, which you’ll see in the crowd. “We want to do everything we can to showcase the game to as many Chinese heritage people as we can and welcome them to the club, and give them the opportunity to be part of the Australian Indigenous game.” The Swans host an annual Marn Grook game celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture, and take part in the yearly Pride Game with St Kilda. “Having relevantly themed games that support sections of the community are core to our community engagement strategy,” Pridham said. “This is the first one. As always happens with these things, they gain momentum over time. As a club, we’ll be keen to grow and make it a very identifiable game for us.” Colless was the mastermind of the themed game, which he said was inspired by research that found Chinese Australians were feeling disengagement from the broader part of the community. “It started because a few people thought we should do something to say Chinese are a fundamental part of Australian community and Australian culture,” Colless said. Loading “The challenge was to find something that was quintessentially Australia and see if there was a Chinese connection. Lo and behold, Australian football is the closest thing we’ve got. “I think it’s going to lay a platform which will get a fair degree of coverage in different ways through the Chinese Australian communities – and it’s up to the AFL and Swans to take advantage of it. “From little acorns, big oak trees grow.” Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

Sport is just another oil painting to be acquired.","content":"On November 15, 2017, Leonardo da Vinci ’s “Salvator Mundi” — a haunting oil painting depicting Jesus Christ — went to auction at Christie’s in New York. The bidding lasted only a few minutes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman weighed in with a bid of US$450 million (A$675m), making it the most expensive piece of artwork in the world. Soon after, the Salvator Mundi found a home on bin Salman’s US$400m (A$600m) superyacht. Recent reports suggest an extravagant art gallery is being built so there’s somewhere to hang it. At the time, many wondered why the Ruler of Saudi Arabia, a country that strictly observes Islamic law, would literally spend a king’s ransom on a piece of Italian Renaissance art that pays homage to Jesus H. Christ himself. The way the Saudis have devoured golf — with an eye firmly on football and other sports — provides us with the answer. Because he can. Former US president Donald Trump with LIV architect Yasir Al-Rumayyan. Credit: AP The sporting world is still unpacking the events from earlier this week when PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan rolled over like a puppy dog wanting his belly tickled, allowing Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to essentially take over both the US and European tours while welcoming the rebels from LIV Golf back into the warm bosom of grown-up, 72-hole golf. How the unholy marriage will work remains unclear but what we do know is money prevailed ahead of morality. Couldn’t see that coming, eh? While Monahan has become the face of the PGA’s treachery, reports are emerging about the decisive influence of Jimmy Dunne , an investment banker and golf powerbroker of sorts. Dunne had been against the idea of LIV from the very beginning. For starters, his firm lost 66 employees when hijacked planes slammed in the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001 - with the majority of hijackers from Saudi Arabia. When PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan made the famous remark that any LIV golfer who shot 54 would receive $54 million, he told SI.com: “This is the guy that’s running the event? I mean, come on. That’s like something you’d see on Saturday Night Live .” The “Salvator Mundi” on display at Christie’s auction rooms in London in October 2017. Credit: AP But, in the past few weeks, things changed. Dunne came to understand that the Saudis had far deeper pockets than the PGA, which was squeezing sponsors for more money to fund litigation against the rebel tour. According to various reports, the PIF was going to litigate the PGA into oblivion. Dunne met with Al-Rumayyan to broker a truce before taking the idea of a merged entity with the Saudis as the “exclusive investor” to Monahan and the deal, within days, was done. Which is all a bit of a worry, of course. Billionaires, oligarchs, and media moguls buy up clubs and codes all the time, but this is different because of the motives.

Credit: Getty Saudi Arabia seems less concerned about using sport to wash away its appalling human rights record than making it a tool by which they can attain power, prestige, and something to play with on a global scale. It’s been said the only reason the PIF went after golf was because Al-Rumayyan is obsessed with it, although the haste with which he abandoned Greg Norman ’s vision for a McHappy Meal version of the sport reveals his true motivations. That point was seemingly forgotten by LIV-aligned golfers who immediately started beating their chests — on Twitter, no less — when the PGA deal was struck. They quickly abandoned what they were fighting for. What happened to enticing a young, vibrant fan base to a stuffy old format followed by old, rich men? What about the loud music, getting hammered on the “watering hole” and eschewing long pants for shorts? What now of LIV’s bold mantra about it being “golf, but louder”? About the only thing that will live post-LIV is the team component — possibly — because Al-Rumayyan likes it. He’s paying the bills so expect it to happen. With golf now in the PIF’s back pocket, what’s the next sport or fancy-schmancy painting on the shopping list? Two of the world’s best footballers , Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema , have signed deals that look like telephone numbers to join the Saudi Pro league, although Lionel Messi on Thursday morning rejected an offer from Al-Hilal to join Major League Soccer franchise Inter Miami in the US. Less than six months after the World Cup in Qatar, the latest reports suggest a joint Saudi bid for the 2034 tournament if not four years sooner. Cricket appears to be the next in line. As reported by this masthead in April, representatives of the Saudi Arabian government have lobbied Indian Premier League owners about setting up the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament in the gulf state.

Aramco made a profit of $240 billion in 2022. Look, there’s nothing new about countries using sport to flex their nationalistic muscle, from the 1936 Olympic Games held in Nazi Germany to Rocky IV , the supreme example of Cold War propaganda. But no! Sport can’t and shan’t be some toy for those with riyals to burn. It might be a losing battle but some of us will rail against the nefarious influence of money on sport until we die or retire or find something else to gibber about. Footnote: If you intend to write an angry email in response to the above, please come up with something better than silly whataboutism about buying petrol and using Uber, in which the Saudis have invested a large chunk of change along with other US companies.

Anyone familiar with cricket knows scenarios such as this have a tendency to get players’ backs up. She knew it, too, and just as the captain of the slighted team approached to protest, made a split-second decision to own her mistake. “He was about to ask a question but I actually stopped him and said ‘I know I’ve missed that’, and it stopped him in his tracks because he didn’t know what to say then,” Polosak, 35, said. “Once umpires acknowledge it, sometimes players are like ‘oh, OK, how can I argue with that?’.” Claire Polosak inspects conditions after rain stops play during a Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Credit: Rick Rycroft/AP Polosak’s resume spans two decades across the men’s and women’s games. She makes a lot more good decisions than she does bad and could recite the Laws of Cricket in her sleep. But perhaps her greatest strength is her understanding that, while the rules of the game are revised only occasionally, the human condition can change by the second. It is partly why abuse of officials by players, coaches and fans continues to make headlines, and partly why referees and umpires – particularly those without access to high-performance training – can feel overwhelmed by the pressure of navigating the grey areas of emotion and subjectivity that come with managing other people. The Australian Sports Commission has sought to tackle this through a new free training and education program to be offered to the country’s one million community sports officials – many of whom are volunteers and under 18 and operating without the help of technology – to develop communication and rapport-building. Cameron Tradell, the ASC’s director of coaching and officiating, says the organisation has met with more than 36 sports, including Australian rules, cricket, netball and wheelchair basketball to understand their needs before updating guidelines largely unchanged since the turn of the century. ‘Umpires are meant to start perfect and get better.’ Claire Polosak “It is about creating support for officials in their relations with players or athletes,” Tradell said. “So, how do you have respectful conversations? How do you understand different people’s needs? How do you get to understand, monitor and evaluate emotion? They are the sorts of things we want to provide so that it is not just transactional, but more of a personalised approach.” Tradell said sentiment is heavily skewed against officials, who are often pilloried for an error even though they are just as fallible as players. The key, he says, is giving them the skills to gain respect through clear, individualised communication. Loading “I’ve been at grounds and witnessed moments that have gone one of two ways, and it came down to the quality of the interactions with the referee,” he said. “They’ve come across and explained in a really clear, concise way, what is unacceptable behaviour and what they don’t want to see moving forward – so actually having that conversation before it gets to the point that it blows up.” The training, which follows last year’s launch of its modern coaching approach , will be delivered via online courses, and then each sport will offer additional, more nuanced sport-specific classes appropriate to the level, age group and region. The ASC hopes the guidelines, which will eventually phase out the general principles of officiating from 2000, will help stop the decline in the number of grassroots officials and increase inclusivity. “Umpires are meant to start perfect and get better – it’s the nature of the beast – but we’re only human,” says Polosak, who endured a “baptism of fire” when she started umpiring men’s club cricket in her hometown of Goulburn at the age of 15. In 2021, she became the first woman to officiate at a men’s Test match. “It’s part one of the reasons why so many people love umpiring sports because it’s about the challenge and getting better, and reading the situation and knowing how to react. There is so much more to good officiating than the rules and the laws. “Really, we’re in the people management game, so any skills we can provide people right from the outset is easier than trying to introduce things later on. “It’s bigger than emotional intelligence, but that’s certainly part of it. But being able to communicate clearly and manage conflict with different people is really important.” News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Steve Smith has officially thrown down the gauntlet to England ahead of the Ashes, daring them to test their mettle against the mighty Australian bowlers. Coming off the field with yet another ton under his belt, a confident Smith declared, “they haven‘t come up against us yet”, taunting England’s batsmen to come after them as Australia’s attack dominated the Indian top order on day two . England, known for their fearless and attacking brand of cricket under new coach Brendon McCullum, have enjoyed a sensational run over the past year. They have set the cricketing world on fire, unleashing a relentless barrage of runs against New Zealand, South Africa, and Pakistan, securing a staggering 11 victories from 13 matches. But one by one, critics have taken aim at England‘s ultra-aggressive style, expecting them to buckle under the pressure. Yet, to everyone’s surprise, Stokes and his band of daredevils have continued their rampage, refusing to let their foot off the throttle. Enter Australia, swaggering onto the scene with an air of supreme confidence. Smith, the enigmatic Australian batsman, left no doubt about his side’s ability to dismantle England’s preferred style of play after his bowlers squeezed India at the Oval. With the likes of Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, Mitchell Starc, Cameron Green, and spinner Nathan Lyon wreaking havoc, India found themselves struggling at 5/151 and 318 runs behind. When asked if England’s attacking approach would succeed against their formidable bowling lineup, Smith responded with a sly grin. Smith has become a force to be reckoned with in English conditions, boasting an astonishing record of seven centuries and accumulating a jaw-dropping 774 runs in the 2019 Ashes at an average of 110.57. “I think I said it initially when ’Bazball’ started that I’m intrigued to see how it goes against our bowlers. I’ve said that all along,” he said. Smith continued to stoke the flames, questioning whether the quality of The Oval pitch would suit the out-and-out assault.

So, we’ll see.” Smith agreed that England have enjoyed a sensational run over the past year but warned they ‘haven’t come up against’ Australia’s bowlers yet. Smith’s comments came after he notched his 31st Test century, spending over five-and-a-half hours at the crease to compile an imperious 121 runs. Partnering with the audacious Travis Head, who smashed a remarkable 163, the duo amassed a partnership of 285 runs. The knock has done much to quench speculation over whether Smith could recreate the form seen during his last tour of England. His astonishing record only seems to get better, with his ton placing him equal with Joe Root for most centuries against India, ever. His knock has also pushed his average at The Oval to an incredible 102.40. ð 9 innings ð¥ 1,038 runs ð® 115.33 average ð¯ Five centuries, three fifties Steve Smith's recent Test record in England is absurd ð¤¯ #AUSvIND #WTCFinal pic.twitter.com/mpWll2RUyL — Wisden (@WisdenCricket) June 8, 2023 Most Test centuries against India: 9 - Joe Root, STEVE SMITH 8 - Ricky Ponting, Viv Richards, Garry Sobers #WTC23 — Nic Savage (@nic_savage1) June 8, 2023 Smith has become a force to be reckoned with in English conditions, boasting an astonishing record of seven centuries and accumulating a jaw-dropping 774 runs in the 2019 Ashes at an average of 110.57. His overall average England over the past nine Tests has amounted to 1,038 runs at 115.33, with scores of 143, 144, 142, 92, 211, 82, 80, 23 and 121. “It was nice to spend a lot of time out there against some good bowlers on a challenging wicket after getting sent in,” he said. “I‘ll take a lot of confidence out of that and hopefully can keep building and have a successful summer here. “I think in terms of English wickets, it‘s probably as close to Australia as you get. I’ve enjoyed playing here, and it was nice to score a few out here again.” The Aussie bowlers immediately stood up as India opened its innings, with the four quicks each taking a wicket in the first four dismissals. Scott Boland starred in the opening overs, following Pat Cummins’ suit when he dismissed Rohit Sharma LBW for 15, by bowling Shubman Gill, who didn’t play a shot only to be bowled. Bizarrely, Cameron Green’s wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara was a near carbon copy of Gill’s dismissal. Mitchell Starc joined the party with a sharp bouncing ball catching the top of Virat Kohli’s bat with Steve Smith taking a high catch in the slips. All eyes will be on India to see if they can salvage the match on Day Three, which begins at 7.30pm AEST tonight.

With Australia having won the previous Ashes series at home in the 2021-22 season by 4-0, England will be aiming to avenge the loss in their home territory. Australia will also be aiming to win their first Ashes series in England in over 20 years. The hosts are also charged up by the ‘Bazball’ revolution brought by skipper Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum, which has seen England win 11 of their last 13 Tests and dominate their opponents with an attacking, aggressive and positive cricket that aims for victory, or a result at least. The history of the series dates back to August 1882, when Australia toured England for a Test match. The match, held at The Oval was a low-scoring affair. In the first innings, Australia was skittled out for 63, with Jack Blackham (17) top scoring. Dick Barlow (5/19) and Ted Peate (4/31) set the tone for the rest of the match. England got a slender lead of 38 runs as they were bowled out for 101, with George Ulyett (26) being the top-scorer. Frederick Spofforth took 7/46 for Australia. However, despite a fifty by Hugh Massie (55), Australia could make only 122 runs in their second innings, leaving England with 85 to chase. Ted Peate (4/40) bowled really well for England again. WG Grace made a commanding 32 at the top but the rest of the batting side failed him. England was bundled out for 77, left just seven short of a win. This was Australia’s first-ever win on English soil. This loss left fans stunned, who were not much used to seeing their heroes lose at home. The Sporting Times, a British newspaper back then expressed their dissapointment with the team’s performance with a mock obituary that suggested that the ‘English Cricket had died’. “In Affectionate Remembrance OF ENGLISH CRICKET, WHICH DIED AT THE OVAL ON 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. R. I. P. N.B.–The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,” read the obituary that intensified the rivalry between two cricketing powerhouses. For years, this rivalry would be a major source of bread and butter for cricket administrators and bodies as they carried on their mission of expanding the sport, which later created rivalries like England vs India, India vs Pakistan, Australia vs New Zealand etc. A small terracotta urn, believed to be having ashes of a burnt cricket bail, became a symbol of cricket’s biggest rivalry and an object over which sport’s biggest icons would fight their hearts out on the field. Before England travelled to Australia in 1882-83, skipper Ivo Bligh expressed his commitment to the cause of “regaining the ashes”. Bligh proved to be a man of his word, defeating Australia in Australia in the series 2-1. Since then, a total of 72 Ashes series have been played since 1882, with England winning 32, Australia winning 34 and six ending in a draw. Ever since 1882, England and Australia have played a total of 340 Test matches, out of which Australia has won 140, England has won 108 and 92 have ended in a draw. In the 12 Ashes series played in the 21st century, Australia has won six, England has won five and one ended in a draw. Australia’s Don Bradman is the top run-maker in the Ashes. In 37 matches, he has scored 5,028 runs at an average of 89.50. He has scored 19 centuries and 12 fifties in his Ashes career, with best score of 334. Following him is England’s Jack Hobbs. In 41 matches, 3,636 runs at an average of 54.26. He has 12 centuries and 15 fifties, with the best score of 187. At the third position is Australia’s Allan Border. In 42 matches, he has scored 3,222 runs at an average of 55.55. He has a total of seven centuries and 19 fifties, with a best score of 200*. The top three run-scorers for Australia are – Bradman (5,028 runs), Border (3,222 runs) and Steve Waugh (3,173 runs at an average of 58.75, with 10 centuries and 14 fifties). The top three-run scorers for England are – Jack Hobbs (3,636 runs), David Gower (3,037 runs in 38 matches at an average of 46.01 with nine centuries and 11 fifties) and Wally Hammond (2,853 runs at an average of 38.07 with nine centuries and seven centuries). Coming to the bowlers, the highest wicket-taker in The Ashes is late spin great Shane Warne, who has 195 wickets in 36 matches at an average of 23.25, with best figures of 8/71. In the second spot is Australia’s Glenn McGrath. He has 157 wickets in 30 matches, with an average of 20.92 and best figures of 8/38. The third is Australia’s Hugh Trumble, who has 141 scalps in 31 matches, with an average of 20.88 and best figures of 8/65. These are also the top-three wicket-takers for Australia in the Ashes. For England, they are, Stuart Broad (131 wickets in 35 balls, with best figures of 8/15), Ian Botham (128 wickets in 32 matches with best figures of 6/95) and Bob Willis (123 wickets in 31 matches with best figures of 8/43).

India collapsed to 4-71 before recovering somewhat to be 5-151 at stumps on the second day in reply to Australia’s 469 at stumps. Nathan Lyon gets in on the action by dismissing Ravindra Jadeja. Credit: Getty Images Australia’s innings was built around a 285-run partnership between Smith (121) and Travis Head (163). Smith resumed on 95 and brought up his 31st Test century flicking successive boundaries off the first over of the day. He now averages 102 at the Oval with three centuries in four innings and his overall career average is back above 60 in rarefied air. Smith questioned how England could succeed with their “Bazball” approach in conditions like those offered up at the Oval. “I think it will be difficult on this kind of wicket that’s up and down and seaming around,” he said. “It’s not easy to defend, let alone come out and swing. “I’m intrigued to see how it goes against our bowlers. I’ve said that all along. They’ve obviously done well against some other attacks, but they haven’t come up against us yet, so we’ll see. “It’s obviously been exciting to watch. I must say I’ve enjoyed watching the way they’ve played and the way they’ve turned things around in the last 12 months or so, but we’ll wait and see how it comes off against us.” India were momentarily 5-87 when captain Pat Cummins was awarded his second wicket, Ajinkya Rahane leg before wicket for 17, until replays confirmed a no ball. “Obviously that hurt. No balls are costly and you want your bowlers behind the line as much as possible,” Smith said. “Jinx is still out there so yeah, no balls are never good.” India have won just nine Tests in England going back through 20 series to 1932. Loading On Thursday, their top three all fell to wobble seam deliveries that cut back into the right-handers, with Cummins beginning the rot in the sixth over of India’s innings, claiming opposing skipper Rohit Sharma leg before wicket for 15. Worse followed when Scott Boland replaced a wayward Mitchell Starc after just two expensive overs and was immaculate, eventually tempting Shubman Gill (13) into leaving a delivery that came back and crashed into his middle and off stumps. The often impenetrable Cheteshwar Pujara (14) did the same, offering his off stump to a delighted Cameron Green. Starc played just one Test on the 2019 tour of England because of problems with his accuracy real and imagined. The big left-armer had similar problems on Thursday, conceding a run a ball, but the quickest of Australia’s bowlers delivered a nasty short ball to Virat Kohli (14). It took the right glove and flew to a leaping Steve Smith, who took a fine overhead catch at second slip. Pat Cummins celebrates taking the wicket of Rohit Sharma. Credit: AP Boland’s continued impressive performances, conceding just two an over while troubling the batsmen with constant seam moment, makes for intriguing selections around the make-up of Australia’s team for the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston next week. The Victorian seamer is playing this Test because Josh Hazlewood was considered not quite ready after returning from the IPL early with a minor side niggle. Hazlewood was expected to be ready for the Ashes, but the selectors have added Michael Neser to the Test squad for the first Test as cover. Smith claimed Boland offered variety to Australia’s attack. “I think the angles he provides, his ability to hit the stumps from slightly shorter than some of our other bowlers, is a big plus,” said Smith. “[It’s] something that I think Neser can do as well ... shorter guys that are a bit skiddier. If there’s any seam movement, it gives the ball more chance to move and still hit the stumps. “The skills he possesses are magnificent. He’s turned up every time he’s had an opportunity. So whether he’s leaving any of the big three out, I don’t know the answer to that, but he’s certainly a quality prospect, as we’ve seen for a couple of years now.” News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Smith, 95 not out overnight, followed team-mate Travis Head in going to three figures with 121 in a first-innings total of 469 at The Oval. Fast bowler Pat Cummins, in his 50th Test, then removed opposing skipper Rohit Sharma to initiate India’s second-day slump. Ajinkya Rahane (29 not out), struck some painful blows on the glove, held firm with Ravindra Jadeja (48) after India had been reduced to 71-4. But India were 151-5 at stumps, a huge deficit of 318 runs. Rohit was plumb lbw for 15 to a full-length ball from Cummins, who had close figures of 1-36 in nine overs. Four balls later, India were 30-2 when Shubman Gill (13) was bowled playing no shot to Scott Boland after being deceived by a sharp off-cutter. England’s Stuart Broad tried to rile Australia before the WTC Final by saying he hoped Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli kept Cummins’s men in the field for a long time ahead of next week’s first Ashes Test at Edgbaston. But both senior India batsmen fell for 14 on Thursday. Pujara was bowled leaving a delivery from all-rounder Cameron Green and Kohli was undone by a spiteful, lifting ball from Mitchell Starc that took the shoulder of the bat, with Smith holding an excellent leaping catch above his head at second slip. Left-hander Jadeja defied Australia in an aggressive 51-ball knock featuring seven fours and a six. But he succumbed to off-spinner Nathan Lyon, edging a well-flighted and turning delivery to slip in a tame end to a stand of 71 with Rahane. “We are in a really good spot so hopefully we can get a few more wickets in the morning,” Boland told Sky Sports. “The pitch is going a little bit up and down so it should be harder for the India batters tomorrow (Friday).” India were facing a potentially huge Australian first-innings total with Smith and Head (163) at the crease. But their pacemen struck as Australia lost four wickets for 41 runs, including Head and Smith, to slip from 361-3 to 402-7. India bowled out Australia after lunch, fast bowler Mohammed Siraj taking 4-108 from 28.3 overs. Smith reached three figures in the opening over on Thursday, joining compatriot Steve Waugh on seven Test hundreds in England. Among non-England batters, only Australia great Don Bradman, with 11 centuries, has scored more. Smith’s 31st Test century left him 12th on the all-time list. Head extended his first overseas Test century to 150 but a short ball proved his undoing when he tried to whip Siraj legside and gloved a catch to wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat. Head’s dismissal ended an impressive stand of 285 runs with Smith after they had come together with Australia in trouble at 76-3. Shardul Thakur then captured the prized wicket of Smith, who inside-edged an outswinger into his stumps to the delight of the large India contingent in a crowd of over 23,000. The WTC is the only major men’s cricket trophy Australia have yet to win. India are appearing in their second WTC final, having lost to New Zealand in the inaugural 2021 showpiece match in Southampton.

While Ponting thought India’s tactics were incorrect on the first day, he was impressed with their second-day fightback, as they bundled out Australia for 469. On the second day in London, Siraj was a big motivator for India’s improved performance with the ball, with the right arm embracing the challenge of bowling to Australia’s powerful batting line-up – and picking up four vital wickets. Siraj peppered Australia’s lineup of quality bats with short-pitched offerings and even participated in a few mid-pitch staring competitions, which excited Ponting. “I loved seeing that and he looks like the ultimate competitor. Maybe sometimes he gets carried away and goes a little bit over the top, but you need those guys in your side when things aren’t going well. He was the one today who said I am going to be the guy that is going to turn things around and what I loved was that his pace didn’t drop at all during the whole innings,” Ponting told International Cricket Council (ICC). “From the first ball yesterday morning until late this afternoon, his pace was hovering around that 86 or 87-mile-and-hour mark and that says a lot about a great attitude,” he added. Siraj was the pick of the bowlers, but all four quicks were excellent, as was Ravindra Jadeja. The Indian top-order collapsed yet again even as the Australian attack overcame a comeback partnership by Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane to take firm control of the WTC final on Day 2 at the Oval in London on Thursday.

Australia have dominated the majority of the opening two days of the ‘Ultimate Test’ at The Oval on the back of centuries from batters Travis Head and Steve Smith and outstanding bowling performance from their pacers, while India have majorly struggled to come to terms with the tricky pitch and English conditions that they are facing at The Oval. Australian attack ripped through India’s top order to leave Rohit Sharma’s lead side five down and still trailing by 318 runs at the time of stumps on Thursday, clearing most of the momentum India had gained from taking in a much-improved bowling display. At the close of play on Day 2, India had posted 151/5 at The Oval on Thursday. “Our score was not as good as we were expecting because our openers failed to score well. Ajinkya Rahane is still on crease and is playing well, we expect to perform better tomorrow and bounce back in the match. Opting to bat or bowl depends completely on the condition. I hope our team plays well and brings the WTC Cup home,” BCCI Vice President Rajiv Shukla told ANI. Coming to the match, At the close of play on Day 2, India had posted 151/5 at The Oval on Thursday. KS Bharat (5*) and Rahane (29*) were unbeaten at the crease as the stumps were drawn at the end of the final session. India started the final session at 37/2, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli unbeaten in the middle. India reached the 50-run mark in 13.4 overs. Pujara looked confident, smashing Green for a four. But a few overs later, the bowler had the last laugh as he struck timber that had been left exposed by Pujara, sending him back for 14. Virat continued building the innings with Ajinkya Rahane, as the Indian dressing room set its turnaround hopes on them. But Virat fell for 14 to a Mitchell Starc delivery, which reared up from a length and hit the batter’s glove. The catch went straight into Steve Smith’s hands at the slip cordon. India were reduced further to 71/4. Following this, Rahane resumed the innings with Ravindra Jadeja. Jadeja looked to be in fine fettle, striking some elegant drives. He took India to 100 in 24.5 overs. The duo marched to a 50-run partnership with their positive intent. Half of India’s line-up was inside the hut, however, as Jadeja was dismissed for 48 off 51 balls after edging a Nathan Lyon delivery to Steve Smith. India was 142/5 and the 71-run partnership with Rahane was broken.KS Bharat came to the crease at the fall of Jadeja’s wicket and he and Rahane took India to the 150-run mark on the final ball of the day. Despite a comeback by Indian pacers, Australia strengthened their position in ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final as they dismissed both Indian openers in the second session of the second day of Thursday after scoring 469 runs. At Tea, India’s score read 37/2, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli unbeaten. Australia started the second session at 422/7, with Alex Carey (22*) and skipper Pat Cummins (2*) unbeaten. Umesh Yadav started the session with a maiden over. Carey played some aggressive strokes, smashing Mohammed Shami for three fours in the 113th over. With Carey’s six in the next over, Australia crossed the 450-run mark in 114.3 overs. However, on the very next ball, Ravindra Jadeja trapped Carey leg-before-wicket for 48, which came off 69 balls and consisted of seven fours and a six. Australia were 453/8. Cummins took the proceedings further with Nathan Lyon. But Mohammed Siraj castled Lyon for nine to get his third wicket. Australia were 468/9. With this, Siraj also reached 50 Test wickets. Siraj took the final wicket as well. Cummins gave a catch straight to Ajinkya Rahane at extra cover after scoring nine runs. The Australian innings ended on 469. Siraj was the leading wicket-taker for India, taking 4/108 in 28.3 overs. Shardul Thakur took 2/83 in 23 overs. Shami took 2/122 in 29 overs. Jadeja got one wicket. When India came out to bat, openers Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma sought to give a solid start, both striking some elegant shots. But the budding partnership was cut short at 30 when skipper Rohit was trapped lbw by Pat Cummins for 15. Skipper got the skipper and the scoreline read 30/1 in six overs. Cheteshwar Pujara was next on the crease. But Scott Boland gave India another heavy blow as Gill was dismissed for 13. Gill was looking to leave the ball, but left his stumps exposed and the ball went through them. India was 30/2 in 6.4 overs. The experienced duo of Virat Kohli and Pujara took India through the remainder of the session without any further loss. Earlier, tight bowling spells from the pace trio of Mohammed Siraj, Mohammed Shami and Shardul Thakur helped India make a comeback in the first session of the second day. At lunch, Alex Carey was batting on 22 and Pat Cummins on 2. Australia started the day at the overnight score of 327/3 with Steve Smith (95*) and Travis Head (146*) unbeaten. The duo started the second day with positive intent and Smith smashed two straight fours in the first over of the day to bring up his 31st Test hundred, his seventh in England. Head also brought up his 150 in just 164 balls. Australia brought up the 350-run mark in the 90th over. Mohammed Siraj struck early in the session to give India the much-needed breakthrough. Head was caught behind by KS Bharat for 163 (174 balls). His knock consisted of 25 fours and a six. Australia were 361/4. Mohammed Shami dismissed Cameron Green for six runs as he was caught by Shubman Gill at slips. Next, it was Shardul Thakur who got the key wicket of Smith for 121 (268 balls). Australia were 387/6 in 98.1 overs and crossed the 400-run mark in 102.5 overs. Axar Patel, who had come to the field as a substitute, made an immediate impact by running out Mitchell Starc for just five runs. India continued to build pressure on the lower order with their pace, but Alex Carey and skipper Pat Cummins put up some solid resistance to it carrying Australia to the lunch without further damage.

Despite Australia’s rich history of immigration from China and East Asia, there have been disproportionately few people with ancestry from that part of the world involved in Australian rules football as players, coaches or administrators. Port Adelaide played three games for premiership points against St Kilda and Gold Coast from 2017-19 in Shanghai, but the fixtures were scrapped in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and have not returned.

China’s ambassador to Australia will toss the coin. On the night before the game, the league will launch the book Celestial Footy: the Story of Chinese Heritage Aussie Rules by author Patrick Skene at the Swans’ new headquarters at the Royal Hall of Industries. The book explores the little-known history of Chinese involvement in the sport, starting on Ballarat’s gold fields. A total of 2500 tickets have been provided to Universities Australia for distribution, presumably to international students who may not have been to an AFL match live. Swans chairman Andrew Pridham wants this game to help grow the sport in Sydney’s Chinese community. According to the 2021 census, 11.6 per cent of people in Sydney nominated Chinese ancestry. “So it’s a significant part of the population,” Pridham said. “We already have very strong following from Chinese origin people, which you’ll see in the crowd. “We want to do everything we can to showcase the game to as many Chinese heritage people as we can and welcome them to the club, and give them the opportunity to be part of the Australian Indigenous game.” The Swans host an annual Marn Grook game celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture, and take part in the yearly Pride Game with St Kilda. “Having relevantly themed games that support sections of the community are core to our community engagement strategy,” Pridham said. “This is the first one. As always happens with these things, they gain momentum over time. As a club, we’ll be keen to grow and make it a very identifiable game for us.” Colless was the mastermind of the themed game, which he said was inspired by research that found Chinese Australians were feeling disengagement from the broader part of the community. “It started because a few people thought we should do something to say Chinese are a fundamental part of Australian community and Australian culture,” Colless said. Loading “The challenge was to find something that was quintessentially Australia and see if there was a Chinese connection. Lo and behold, Australian football is the closest thing we’ve got. “I think it’s going to lay a platform which will get a fair degree of coverage in different ways through the Chinese Australian communities – and it’s up to the AFL and Swans to take advantage of it. “From little acorns, big oak trees grow.” Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

Sport is just another oil painting to be acquired.","content":"On November 15, 2017, Leonardo da Vinci ’s “Salvator Mundi” — a haunting oil painting depicting Jesus Christ — went to auction at Christie’s in New York. The bidding lasted only a few minutes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman weighed in with a bid of US$450 million (A$675m), making it the most expensive piece of artwork in the world. Soon after, the Salvator Mundi found a home on bin Salman’s US$400m (A$600m) superyacht. Recent reports suggest an extravagant art gallery is being built so there’s somewhere to hang it. At the time, many wondered why the Ruler of Saudi Arabia, a country that strictly observes Islamic law, would literally spend a king’s ransom on a piece of Italian Renaissance art that pays homage to Jesus H. Christ himself. The way the Saudis have devoured golf — with an eye firmly on football and other sports — provides us with the answer. Because he can. Former US president Donald Trump with LIV architect Yasir Al-Rumayyan. Credit: AP The sporting world is still unpacking the events from earlier this week when PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan rolled over like a puppy dog wanting his belly tickled, allowing Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to essentially take over both the US and European tours while welcoming the rebels from LIV Golf back into the warm bosom of grown-up, 72-hole golf. How the unholy marriage will work remains unclear but what we do know is money prevailed ahead of morality. Couldn’t see that coming, eh? While Monahan has become the face of the PGA’s treachery, reports are emerging about the decisive influence of Jimmy Dunne , an investment banker and golf powerbroker of sorts. Dunne had been against the idea of LIV from the very beginning. For starters, his firm lost 66 employees when hijacked planes slammed in the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001 - with the majority of hijackers from Saudi Arabia. When PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan made the famous remark that any LIV golfer who shot 54 would receive $54 million, he told SI.com: “This is the guy that’s running the event? I mean, come on. That’s like something you’d see on Saturday Night Live .” The “Salvator Mundi” on display at Christie’s auction rooms in London in October 2017. Credit: AP But, in the past few weeks, things changed. Dunne came to understand that the Saudis had far deeper pockets than the PGA, which was squeezing sponsors for more money to fund litigation against the rebel tour. According to various reports, the PIF was going to litigate the PGA into oblivion. Dunne met with Al-Rumayyan to broker a truce before taking the idea of a merged entity with the Saudis as the “exclusive investor” to Monahan and the deal, within days, was done. Which is all a bit of a worry, of course. Billionaires, oligarchs, and media moguls buy up clubs and codes all the time, but this is different because of the motives.

Credit: Getty Saudi Arabia seems less concerned about using sport to wash away its appalling human rights record than making it a tool by which they can attain power, prestige, and something to play with on a global scale. It’s been said the only reason the PIF went after golf was because Al-Rumayyan is obsessed with it, although the haste with which he abandoned Greg Norman ’s vision for a McHappy Meal version of the sport reveals his true motivations. That point was seemingly forgotten by LIV-aligned golfers who immediately started beating their chests — on Twitter, no less — when the PGA deal was struck. They quickly abandoned what they were fighting for. What happened to enticing a young, vibrant fan base to a stuffy old format followed by old, rich men? What about the loud music, getting hammered on the “watering hole” and eschewing long pants for shorts? What now of LIV’s bold mantra about it being “golf, but louder”? About the only thing that will live post-LIV is the team component — possibly — because Al-Rumayyan likes it. He’s paying the bills so expect it to happen. With golf now in the PIF’s back pocket, what’s the next sport or fancy-schmancy painting on the shopping list? Two of the world’s best footballers , Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema , have signed deals that look like telephone numbers to join the Saudi Pro league, although Lionel Messi on Thursday morning rejected an offer from Al-Hilal to join Major League Soccer franchise Inter Miami in the US. Less than six months after the World Cup in Qatar, the latest reports suggest a joint Saudi bid for the 2034 tournament if not four years sooner. Cricket appears to be the next in line. As reported by this masthead in April, representatives of the Saudi Arabian government have lobbied Indian Premier League owners about setting up the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament in the gulf state.

Aramco made a profit of $240 billion in 2022. Look, there’s nothing new about countries using sport to flex their nationalistic muscle, from the 1936 Olympic Games held in Nazi Germany to Rocky IV , the supreme example of Cold War propaganda. But no! Sport can’t and shan’t be some toy for those with riyals to burn. It might be a losing battle but some of us will rail against the nefarious influence of money on sport until we die or retire or find something else to gibber about. Footnote: If you intend to write an angry email in response to the above, please come up with something better than silly whataboutism about buying petrol and using Uber, in which the Saudis have invested a large chunk of change along with other US companies.

After working as an undercover drug squad operative and then police prosecutor, Newham pivoted into acting, gaining entry to the prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which counts Robert Redford , Danny deVito and Adrien Brody among its alumni. Two years after quitting the police force, he landed a role as a deranged murderer in the 2006 movie Isolated , a psychological thriller. “It was strange playing the sort of person I used to arrest,” Newham told this masthead in 2005.

Anyone familiar with cricket knows scenarios such as this have a tendency to get players’ backs up. She knew it, too, and just as the captain of the slighted team approached to protest, made a split-second decision to own her mistake. “He was about to ask a question but I actually stopped him and said ‘I know I’ve missed that’, and it stopped him in his tracks because he didn’t know what to say then,” Polosak, 35, said. “Once umpires acknowledge it, sometimes players are like ‘oh, OK, how can I argue with that?’.” Claire Polosak inspects conditions after rain stops play during a Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Credit: Rick Rycroft/AP Polosak’s resume spans two decades across the men’s and women’s games. She makes a lot more good decisions than she does bad and could recite the Laws of Cricket in her sleep. But perhaps her greatest strength is her understanding that, while the rules of the game are revised only occasionally, the human condition can change by the second. It is partly why abuse of officials by players, coaches and fans continues to make headlines, and partly why referees and umpires – particularly those without access to high-performance training – can feel overwhelmed by the pressure of navigating the grey areas of emotion and subjectivity that come with managing other people. The Australian Sports Commission has sought to tackle this through a new free training and education program to be offered to the country’s one million community sports officials – many of whom are volunteers and under 18 and operating without the help of technology – to develop communication and rapport-building. Cameron Tradell, the ASC’s director of coaching and officiating, says the organisation has met with more than 36 sports, including Australian rules, cricket, netball and wheelchair basketball to understand their needs before updating guidelines largely unchanged since the turn of the century. ‘Umpires are meant to start perfect and get better.’ Claire Polosak “It is about creating support for officials in their relations with players or athletes,” Tradell said. “So, how do you have respectful conversations? How do you understand different people’s needs? How do you get to understand, monitor and evaluate emotion? They are the sorts of things we want to provide so that it is not just transactional, but more of a personalised approach.” Tradell said sentiment is heavily skewed against officials, who are often pilloried for an error even though they are just as fallible as players. The key, he says, is giving them the skills to gain respect through clear, individualised communication. Loading “I’ve been at grounds and witnessed moments that have gone one of two ways, and it came down to the quality of the interactions with the referee,” he said. “They’ve come across and explained in a really clear, concise way, what is unacceptable behaviour and what they don’t want to see moving forward – so actually having that conversation before it gets to the point that it blows up.” The training, which follows last year’s launch of its modern coaching approach , will be delivered via online courses, and then each sport will offer additional, more nuanced sport-specific classes appropriate to the level, age group and region. The ASC hopes the guidelines, which will eventually phase out the general principles of officiating from 2000, will help stop the decline in the number of grassroots officials and increase inclusivity. “Umpires are meant to start perfect and get better – it’s the nature of the beast – but we’re only human,” says Polosak, who endured a “baptism of fire” when she started umpiring men’s club cricket in her hometown of Goulburn at the age of 15. In 2021, she became the first woman to officiate at a men’s Test match. “It’s part one of the reasons why so many people love umpiring sports because it’s about the challenge and getting better, and reading the situation and knowing how to react. There is so much more to good officiating than the rules and the laws. “Really, we’re in the people management game, so any skills we can provide people right from the outset is easier than trying to introduce things later on. “It’s bigger than emotional intelligence, but that’s certainly part of it. But being able to communicate clearly and manage conflict with different people is really important.” News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Steve Smith has officially thrown down the gauntlet to England ahead of the Ashes, daring them to test their mettle against the mighty Australian bowlers. Coming off the field with yet another ton under his belt, a confident Smith declared, “they haven‘t come up against us yet”, taunting England’s batsmen to come after them as Australia’s attack dominated the Indian top order on day two . England, known for their fearless and attacking brand of cricket under new coach Brendon McCullum, have enjoyed a sensational run over the past year. They have set the cricketing world on fire, unleashing a relentless barrage of runs against New Zealand, South Africa, and Pakistan, securing a staggering 11 victories from 13 matches. But one by one, critics have taken aim at England‘s ultra-aggressive style, expecting them to buckle under the pressure. Yet, to everyone’s surprise, Stokes and his band of daredevils have continued their rampage, refusing to let their foot off the throttle. Enter Australia, swaggering onto the scene with an air of supreme confidence. Smith, the enigmatic Australian batsman, left no doubt about his side’s ability to dismantle England’s preferred style of play after his bowlers squeezed India at the Oval. With the likes of Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, Mitchell Starc, Cameron Green, and spinner Nathan Lyon wreaking havoc, India found themselves struggling at 5/151 and 318 runs behind. When asked if England’s attacking approach would succeed against their formidable bowling lineup, Smith responded with a sly grin. Smith has become a force to be reckoned with in English conditions, boasting an astonishing record of seven centuries and accumulating a jaw-dropping 774 runs in the 2019 Ashes at an average of 110.57. “I think I said it initially when ’Bazball’ started that I’m intrigued to see how it goes against our bowlers. I’ve said that all along,” he said. Smith continued to stoke the flames, questioning whether the quality of The Oval pitch would suit the out-and-out assault.

So, we’ll see.” Smith agreed that England have enjoyed a sensational run over the past year but warned they ‘haven’t come up against’ Australia’s bowlers yet. Smith’s comments came after he notched his 31st Test century, spending over five-and-a-half hours at the crease to compile an imperious 121 runs. Partnering with the audacious Travis Head, who smashed a remarkable 163, the duo amassed a partnership of 285 runs. The knock has done much to quench speculation over whether Smith could recreate the form seen during his last tour of England. His astonishing record only seems to get better, with his ton placing him equal with Joe Root for most centuries against India, ever. His knock has also pushed his average at The Oval to an incredible 102.40. ð 9 innings ð¥ 1,038 runs ð® 115.33 average ð¯ Five centuries, three fifties Steve Smith's recent Test record in England is absurd ð¤¯ #AUSvIND #WTCFinal pic.twitter.com/mpWll2RUyL — Wisden (@WisdenCricket) June 8, 2023 Most Test centuries against India: 9 - Joe Root, STEVE SMITH 8 - Ricky Ponting, Viv Richards, Garry Sobers #WTC23 — Nic Savage (@nic_savage1) June 8, 2023 Smith has become a force to be reckoned with in English conditions, boasting an astonishing record of seven centuries and accumulating a jaw-dropping 774 runs in the 2019 Ashes at an average of 110.57. His overall average England over the past nine Tests has amounted to 1,038 runs at 115.33, with scores of 143, 144, 142, 92, 211, 82, 80, 23 and 121. “It was nice to spend a lot of time out there against some good bowlers on a challenging wicket after getting sent in,” he said. “I‘ll take a lot of confidence out of that and hopefully can keep building and have a successful summer here. “I think in terms of English wickets, it‘s probably as close to Australia as you get. I’ve enjoyed playing here, and it was nice to score a few out here again.” The Aussie bowlers immediately stood up as India opened its innings, with the four quicks each taking a wicket in the first four dismissals. Scott Boland starred in the opening overs, following Pat Cummins’ suit when he dismissed Rohit Sharma LBW for 15, by bowling Shubman Gill, who didn’t play a shot only to be bowled. Bizarrely, Cameron Green’s wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara was a near carbon copy of Gill’s dismissal. Mitchell Starc joined the party with a sharp bouncing ball catching the top of Virat Kohli’s bat with Steve Smith taking a high catch in the slips. All eyes will be on India to see if they can salvage the match on Day Three, which begins at 7.30pm AEST tonight.

With Australia having won the previous Ashes series at home in the 2021-22 season by 4-0, England will be aiming to avenge the loss in their home territory. Australia will also be aiming to win their first Ashes series in England in over 20 years. The hosts are also charged up by the ‘Bazball’ revolution brought by skipper Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum, which has seen England win 11 of their last 13 Tests and dominate their opponents with an attacking, aggressive and positive cricket that aims for victory, or a result at least. The history of the series dates back to August 1882, when Australia toured England for a Test match. The match, held at The Oval was a low-scoring affair. In the first innings, Australia was skittled out for 63, with Jack Blackham (17) top scoring. Dick Barlow (5/19) and Ted Peate (4/31) set the tone for the rest of the match. England got a slender lead of 38 runs as they were bowled out for 101, with George Ulyett (26) being the top-scorer. Frederick Spofforth took 7/46 for Australia. However, despite a fifty by Hugh Massie (55), Australia could make only 122 runs in their second innings, leaving England with 85 to chase. Ted Peate (4/40) bowled really well for England again. WG Grace made a commanding 32 at the top but the rest of the batting side failed him. England was bundled out for 77, left just seven short of a win. This was Australia’s first-ever win on English soil. This loss left fans stunned, who were not much used to seeing their heroes lose at home. The Sporting Times, a British newspaper back then expressed their dissapointment with the team’s performance with a mock obituary that suggested that the ‘English Cricket had died’. “In Affectionate Remembrance OF ENGLISH CRICKET, WHICH DIED AT THE OVAL ON 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. R. I. P. N.B.–The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,” read the obituary that intensified the rivalry between two cricketing powerhouses. For years, this rivalry would be a major source of bread and butter for cricket administrators and bodies as they carried on their mission of expanding the sport, which later created rivalries like England vs India, India vs Pakistan, Australia vs New Zealand etc. A small terracotta urn, believed to be having ashes of a burnt cricket bail, became a symbol of cricket’s biggest rivalry and an object over which sport’s biggest icons would fight their hearts out on the field. Before England travelled to Australia in 1882-83, skipper Ivo Bligh expressed his commitment to the cause of “regaining the ashes”. Bligh proved to be a man of his word, defeating Australia in Australia in the series 2-1. Since then, a total of 72 Ashes series have been played since 1882, with England winning 32, Australia winning 34 and six ending in a draw. Ever since 1882, England and Australia have played a total of 340 Test matches, out of which Australia has won 140, England has won 108 and 92 have ended in a draw. In the 12 Ashes series played in the 21st century, Australia has won six, England has won five and one ended in a draw. Australia’s Don Bradman is the top run-maker in the Ashes. In 37 matches, he has scored 5,028 runs at an average of 89.50. He has scored 19 centuries and 12 fifties in his Ashes career, with best score of 334. Following him is England’s Jack Hobbs. In 41 matches, 3,636 runs at an average of 54.26. He has 12 centuries and 15 fifties, with the best score of 187. At the third position is Australia’s Allan Border. In 42 matches, he has scored 3,222 runs at an average of 55.55. He has a total of seven centuries and 19 fifties, with a best score of 200*. The top three run-scorers for Australia are – Bradman (5,028 runs), Border (3,222 runs) and Steve Waugh (3,173 runs at an average of 58.75, with 10 centuries and 14 fifties). The top three-run scorers for England are – Jack Hobbs (3,636 runs), David Gower (3,037 runs in 38 matches at an average of 46.01 with nine centuries and 11 fifties) and Wally Hammond (2,853 runs at an average of 38.07 with nine centuries and seven centuries). Coming to the bowlers, the highest wicket-taker in The Ashes is late spin great Shane Warne, who has 195 wickets in 36 matches at an average of 23.25, with best figures of 8/71. In the second spot is Australia’s Glenn McGrath. He has 157 wickets in 30 matches, with an average of 20.92 and best figures of 8/38. The third is Australia’s Hugh Trumble, who has 141 scalps in 31 matches, with an average of 20.88 and best figures of 8/65. These are also the top-three wicket-takers for Australia in the Ashes. For England, they are, Stuart Broad (131 wickets in 35 balls, with best figures of 8/15), Ian Botham (128 wickets in 32 matches with best figures of 6/95) and Bob Willis (123 wickets in 31 matches with best figures of 8/43).

India collapsed to 4-71 before recovering somewhat to be 5-151 at stumps on the second day in reply to Australia’s 469 at stumps. Nathan Lyon gets in on the action by dismissing Ravindra Jadeja. Credit: Getty Images Australia’s innings was built around a 285-run partnership between Smith (121) and Travis Head (163). Smith resumed on 95 and brought up his 31st Test century flicking successive boundaries off the first over of the day. He now averages 102 at the Oval with three centuries in four innings and his overall career average is back above 60 in rarefied air. Smith questioned how England could succeed with their “Bazball” approach in conditions like those offered up at the Oval. “I think it will be difficult on this kind of wicket that’s up and down and seaming around,” he said. “It’s not easy to defend, let alone come out and swing. “I’m intrigued to see how it goes against our bowlers. I’ve said that all along. They’ve obviously done well against some other attacks, but they haven’t come up against us yet, so we’ll see. “It’s obviously been exciting to watch. I must say I’ve enjoyed watching the way they’ve played and the way they’ve turned things around in the last 12 months or so, but we’ll wait and see how it comes off against us.” India were momentarily 5-87 when captain Pat Cummins was awarded his second wicket, Ajinkya Rahane leg before wicket for 17, until replays confirmed a no ball. “Obviously that hurt. No balls are costly and you want your bowlers behind the line as much as possible,” Smith said. “Jinx is still out there so yeah, no balls are never good.” India have won just nine Tests in England going back through 20 series to 1932. Loading On Thursday, their top three all fell to wobble seam deliveries that cut back into the right-handers, with Cummins beginning the rot in the sixth over of India’s innings, claiming opposing skipper Rohit Sharma leg before wicket for 15. Worse followed when Scott Boland replaced a wayward Mitchell Starc after just two expensive overs and was immaculate, eventually tempting Shubman Gill (13) into leaving a delivery that came back and crashed into his middle and off stumps. The often impenetrable Cheteshwar Pujara (14) did the same, offering his off stump to a delighted Cameron Green. Starc played just one Test on the 2019 tour of England because of problems with his accuracy real and imagined. The big left-armer had similar problems on Thursday, conceding a run a ball, but the quickest of Australia’s bowlers delivered a nasty short ball to Virat Kohli (14). It took the right glove and flew to a leaping Steve Smith, who took a fine overhead catch at second slip. Pat Cummins celebrates taking the wicket of Rohit Sharma. Credit: AP Boland’s continued impressive performances, conceding just two an over while troubling the batsmen with constant seam moment, makes for intriguing selections around the make-up of Australia’s team for the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston next week. The Victorian seamer is playing this Test because Josh Hazlewood was considered not quite ready after returning from the IPL early with a minor side niggle. Hazlewood was expected to be ready for the Ashes, but the selectors have added Michael Neser to the Test squad for the first Test as cover. Smith claimed Boland offered variety to Australia’s attack. “I think the angles he provides, his ability to hit the stumps from slightly shorter than some of our other bowlers, is a big plus,” said Smith. “[It’s] something that I think Neser can do as well ... shorter guys that are a bit skiddier. If there’s any seam movement, it gives the ball more chance to move and still hit the stumps. “The skills he possesses are magnificent. He’s turned up every time he’s had an opportunity. So whether he’s leaving any of the big three out, I don’t know the answer to that, but he’s certainly a quality prospect, as we’ve seen for a couple of years now.” News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Smith, 95 not out overnight, followed team-mate Travis Head in going to three figures with 121 in a first-innings total of 469 at The Oval. Fast bowler Pat Cummins, in his 50th Test, then removed opposing skipper Rohit Sharma to initiate India’s second-day slump. Ajinkya Rahane (29 not out), struck some painful blows on the glove, held firm with Ravindra Jadeja (48) after India had been reduced to 71-4. But India were 151-5 at stumps, a huge deficit of 318 runs. Rohit was plumb lbw for 15 to a full-length ball from Cummins, who had close figures of 1-36 in nine overs. Four balls later, India were 30-2 when Shubman Gill (13) was bowled playing no shot to Scott Boland after being deceived by a sharp off-cutter. England’s Stuart Broad tried to rile Australia before the WTC Final by saying he hoped Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli kept Cummins’s men in the field for a long time ahead of next week’s first Ashes Test at Edgbaston. But both senior India batsmen fell for 14 on Thursday. Pujara was bowled leaving a delivery from all-rounder Cameron Green and Kohli was undone by a spiteful, lifting ball from Mitchell Starc that took the shoulder of the bat, with Smith holding an excellent leaping catch above his head at second slip. Left-hander Jadeja defied Australia in an aggressive 51-ball knock featuring seven fours and a six. But he succumbed to off-spinner Nathan Lyon, edging a well-flighted and turning delivery to slip in a tame end to a stand of 71 with Rahane. “We are in a really good spot so hopefully we can get a few more wickets in the morning,” Boland told Sky Sports. “The pitch is going a little bit up and down so it should be harder for the India batters tomorrow (Friday).” India were facing a potentially huge Australian first-innings total with Smith and Head (163) at the crease. But their pacemen struck as Australia lost four wickets for 41 runs, including Head and Smith, to slip from 361-3 to 402-7. India bowled out Australia after lunch, fast bowler Mohammed Siraj taking 4-108 from 28.3 overs. Smith reached three figures in the opening over on Thursday, joining compatriot Steve Waugh on seven Test hundreds in England. Among non-England batters, only Australia great Don Bradman, with 11 centuries, has scored more. Smith’s 31st Test century left him 12th on the all-time list. Head extended his first overseas Test century to 150 but a short ball proved his undoing when he tried to whip Siraj legside and gloved a catch to wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat. Head’s dismissal ended an impressive stand of 285 runs with Smith after they had come together with Australia in trouble at 76-3. Shardul Thakur then captured the prized wicket of Smith, who inside-edged an outswinger into his stumps to the delight of the large India contingent in a crowd of over 23,000. The WTC is the only major men’s cricket trophy Australia have yet to win.

While Ponting thought India’s tactics were incorrect on the first day, he was impressed with their second-day fightback, as they bundled out Australia for 469. On the second day in London, Siraj was a big motivator for India’s improved performance with the ball, with the right arm embracing the challenge of bowling to Australia’s powerful batting line-up – and picking up four vital wickets. Siraj peppered Australia’s lineup of quality bats with short-pitched offerings and even participated in a few mid-pitch staring competitions, which excited Ponting. “I loved seeing that and he looks like the ultimate competitor. Maybe sometimes he gets carried away and goes a little bit over the top, but you need those guys in your side when things aren’t going well. He was the one today who said I am going to be the guy that is going to turn things around and what I loved was that his pace didn’t drop at all during the whole innings,” Ponting told International Cricket Council (ICC). “From the first ball yesterday morning until late this afternoon, his pace was hovering around that 86 or 87-mile-and-hour mark and that says a lot about a great attitude,” he added. Siraj was the pick of the bowlers, but all four quicks were excellent, as was Ravindra Jadeja. The Indian top-order collapsed yet again even as the Australian attack overcame a comeback partnership by Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane to take firm control of the WTC final on Day 2 at the Oval in London on Thursday.

Australia have dominated the majority of the opening two days of the ‘Ultimate Test’ at The Oval on the back of centuries from batters Travis Head and Steve Smith and outstanding bowling performance from their pacers, while India have majorly struggled to come to terms with the tricky pitch and English conditions that they are facing at The Oval. Australian attack ripped through India’s top order to leave Rohit Sharma’s lead side five down and still trailing by 318 runs at the time of stumps on Thursday, clearing most of the momentum India had gained from taking in a much-improved bowling display. At the close of play on Day 2, India had posted 151/5 at The Oval on Thursday. “Our score was not as good as we were expecting because our openers failed to score well. Ajinkya Rahane is still on crease and is playing well, we expect to perform better tomorrow and bounce back in the match. Opting to bat or bowl depends completely on the condition. I hope our team plays well and brings the WTC Cup home,” BCCI Vice President Rajiv Shukla told ANI. Coming to the match, At the close of play on Day 2, India had posted 151/5 at The Oval on Thursday. KS Bharat (5*) and Rahane (29*) were unbeaten at the crease as the stumps were drawn at the end of the final session. India started the final session at 37/2, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli unbeaten in the middle. India reached the 50-run mark in 13.4 overs. Pujara looked confident, smashing Green for a four. But a few overs later, the bowler had the last laugh as he struck timber that had been left exposed by Pujara, sending him back for 14. Virat continued building the innings with Ajinkya Rahane, as the Indian dressing room set its turnaround hopes on them. But Virat fell for 14 to a Mitchell Starc delivery, which reared up from a length and hit the batter’s glove. The catch went straight into Steve Smith’s hands at the slip cordon. India were reduced further to 71/4. Following this, Rahane resumed the innings with Ravindra Jadeja. Jadeja looked to be in fine fettle, striking some elegant drives. He took India to 100 in 24.5 overs. The duo marched to a 50-run partnership with their positive intent. Half of India’s line-up was inside the hut, however, as Jadeja was dismissed for 48 off 51 balls after edging a Nathan Lyon delivery to Steve Smith. India was 142/5 and the 71-run partnership with Rahane was broken.KS Bharat came to the crease at the fall of Jadeja’s wicket and he and Rahane took India to the 150-run mark on the final ball of the day. Despite a comeback by Indian pacers, Australia strengthened their position in ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final as they dismissed both Indian openers in the second session of the second day of Thursday after scoring 469 runs. At Tea, India’s score read 37/2, with Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli unbeaten. Australia started the second session at 422/7, with Alex Carey (22*) and skipper Pat Cummins (2*) unbeaten. Umesh Yadav started the session with a maiden over. Carey played some aggressive strokes, smashing Mohammed Shami for three fours in the 113th over. With Carey’s six in the next over, Australia crossed the 450-run mark in 114.3 overs. However, on the very next ball, Ravindra Jadeja trapped Carey leg-before-wicket for 48, which came off 69 balls and consisted of seven fours and a six. Australia were 453/8. Cummins took the proceedings further with Nathan Lyon. But Mohammed Siraj castled Lyon for nine to get his third wicket. Australia were 468/9. With this, Siraj also reached 50 Test wickets. Siraj took the final wicket as well. Cummins gave a catch straight to Ajinkya Rahane at extra cover after scoring nine runs. The Australian innings ended on 469. Siraj was the leading wicket-taker for India, taking 4/108 in 28.3 overs. Shardul Thakur took 2/83 in 23 overs. Shami took 2/122 in 29 overs. Jadeja got one wicket. When India came out to bat, openers Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma sought to give a solid start, both striking some elegant shots. But the budding partnership was cut short at 30 when skipper Rohit was trapped lbw by Pat Cummins for 15. Skipper got the skipper and the scoreline read 30/1 in six overs. Cheteshwar Pujara was next on the crease. But Scott Boland gave India another heavy blow as Gill was dismissed for 13. Gill was looking to leave the ball, but left his stumps exposed and the ball went through them. India was 30/2 in 6.4 overs. The experienced duo of Virat Kohli and Pujara took India through the remainder of the session without any further loss. Earlier, tight bowling spells from the pace trio of Mohammed Siraj, Mohammed Shami and Shardul Thakur helped India make a comeback in the first session of the second day. At lunch, Alex Carey was batting on 22 and Pat Cummins on 2. Australia started the day at the overnight score of 327/3 with Steve Smith (95*) and Travis Head (146*) unbeaten. The duo started the second day with positive intent and Smith smashed two straight fours in the first over of the day to bring up his 31st Test hundred, his seventh in England. Head also brought up his 150 in just 164 balls. Australia brought up the 350-run mark in the 90th over. Mohammed Siraj struck early in the session to give India the much-needed breakthrough. Head was caught behind by KS Bharat for 163 (174 balls). His knock consisted of 25 fours and a six. Australia were 361/4. Mohammed Shami dismissed Cameron Green for six runs as he was caught by Shubman Gill at slips. Next, it was Shardul Thakur who got the key wicket of Smith for 121 (268 balls). Australia were 387/6 in 98.1 overs and crossed the 400-run mark in 102.5 overs. Axar Patel, who had come to the field as a substitute, made an immediate impact by running out Mitchell Starc for just five runs. India continued to build pressure on the lower order with their pace, but Alex Carey and skipper Pat Cummins put up some solid resistance to it carrying Australia to the lunch without further damage. Australia had ended the first day on a high at 327/3 with Steve Smith (95*) and Travis Head (146*) unbeaten. India had restricted Australia to 76/3 but Head-Smith put on a solid partnership to put Australia in a strong position.

A total of 2500 tickets have been provided to Universities Australia for distribution, presumably to international students who may not have been to an AFL match live. Swans chairman Andrew Pridham wants this game to help grow the sport in Sydney’s Chinese community. According to the 2021 census, 11.6 per cent of people in Sydney nominated Chinese ancestry. “So it’s a significant part of the population,” Pridham said. “We already have very strong following from Chinese origin people, which you’ll see in the crowd. “We want to do everything we can to showcase the game to as many Chinese heritage people as we can and welcome them to the club, and give them the opportunity to be part of the Australian Indigenous game.” The Swans host an annual Marn Grook game celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture, and take part in the yearly Pride Game with St Kilda. “Having relevantly themed games that support sections of the community are core to our community engagement strategy,” Pridham said. “This is the first one. As always happens with these things, they gain momentum over time. As a club, we’ll be keen to grow and make it a very identifiable game for us.” Colless was the mastermind of the themed game, which he said was inspired by research that found Chinese Australians were feeling disengagement from the broader part of the community. “It started because a few people thought we should do something to say Chinese are a fundamental part of Australian community and Australian culture,” Colless said. Loading “The challenge was to find something that was quintessentially Australia and see if there was a Chinese connection. Lo and behold, Australian football is the closest thing we’ve got. “I think it’s going to lay a platform which will get a fair degree of coverage in different ways through the Chinese Australian communities – and it’s up to the AFL and Swans to take advantage of it. “From little acorns, big oak trees grow.” Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

Sport is just another oil painting to be acquired.","content":"On November 15, 2017, Leonardo da Vinci ’s “Salvator Mundi” — a haunting oil painting depicting Jesus Christ — went to auction at Christie’s in New York. The bidding lasted only a few minutes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman weighed in with a bid of US$450 million (A$675m), making it the most expensive piece of artwork in the world. Soon after, the Salvator Mundi found a home on bin Salman’s US$400m (A$600m) superyacht. Recent reports suggest an extravagant art gallery is being built so there’s somewhere to hang it. At the time, many wondered why the Ruler of Saudi Arabia, a country that strictly observes Islamic law, would literally spend a king’s ransom on a piece of Italian Renaissance art that pays homage to Jesus H. Christ himself. The way the Saudis have devoured golf — with an eye firmly on football and other sports — provides us with the answer. Because he can. Former US president Donald Trump with LIV architect Yasir Al-Rumayyan. Credit: AP The sporting world is still unpacking the events from earlier this week when PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan rolled over like a puppy dog wanting his belly tickled, allowing Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to essentially take over both the US and European tours while welcoming the rebels from LIV Golf back into the warm bosom of grown-up, 72-hole golf. How the unholy marriage will work remains unclear but what we do know is money prevailed ahead of morality. Couldn’t see that coming, eh? While Monahan has become the face of the PGA’s treachery, reports are emerging about the decisive influence of Jimmy Dunne , an investment banker and golf powerbroker of sorts. Dunne had been against the idea of LIV from the very beginning. For starters, his firm lost 66 employees when hijacked planes slammed in the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001 - with the majority of hijackers from Saudi Arabia. When PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan made the famous remark that any LIV golfer who shot 54 would receive $54 million, he told SI.com: “This is the guy that’s running the event? I mean, come on. That’s like something you’d see on Saturday Night Live .” The “Salvator Mundi” on display at Christie’s auction rooms in London in October 2017. Credit: AP But, in the past few weeks, things changed. Dunne came to understand that the Saudis had far deeper pockets than the PGA, which was squeezing sponsors for more money to fund litigation against the rebel tour. According to various reports, the PIF was going to litigate the PGA into oblivion. Dunne met with Al-Rumayyan to broker a truce before taking the idea of a merged entity with the Saudis as the “exclusive investor” to Monahan and the deal, within days, was done. Which is all a bit of a worry, of course. Billionaires, oligarchs, and media moguls buy up clubs and codes all the time, but this is different because of the motives.

Credit: Getty Saudi Arabia seems less concerned about using sport to wash away its appalling human rights record than making it a tool by which they can attain power, prestige, and something to play with on a global scale. It’s been said the only reason the PIF went after golf was because Al-Rumayyan is obsessed with it, although the haste with which he abandoned Greg Norman ’s vision for a McHappy Meal version of the sport reveals his true motivations. That point was seemingly forgotten by LIV-aligned golfers who immediately started beating their chests — on Twitter, no less — when the PGA deal was struck. They quickly abandoned what they were fighting for. What happened to enticing a young, vibrant fan base to a stuffy old format followed by old, rich men? What about the loud music, getting hammered on the “watering hole” and eschewing long pants for shorts? What now of LIV’s bold mantra about it being “golf, but louder”? About the only thing that will live post-LIV is the team component — possibly — because Al-Rumayyan likes it. He’s paying the bills so expect it to happen. With golf now in the PIF’s back pocket, what’s the next sport or fancy-schmancy painting on the shopping list? Two of the world’s best footballers , Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema , have signed deals that look like telephone numbers to join the Saudi Pro league, although Lionel Messi on Thursday morning rejected an offer from Al-Hilal to join Major League Soccer franchise Inter Miami in the US. Less than six months after the World Cup in Qatar, the latest reports suggest a joint Saudi bid for the 2034 tournament if not four years sooner. Cricket appears to be the next in line. As reported by this masthead in April, representatives of the Saudi Arabian government have lobbied Indian Premier League owners about setting up the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament in the gulf state. Watch this space. ‘That’s like something you’d see on Saturday Night Live’ Investment banker and golf powerbroker Jimmy Dunne Via oil giant Aramco, Saudi Arabia is also a global partner with Formula 1 racing. Aramco made a profit of $240 billion in 2022. Look, there’s nothing new about countries using sport to flex their nationalistic muscle, from the 1936 Olympic Games held in Nazi Germany to Rocky IV , the supreme example of Cold War propaganda. But no! Sport can’t and shan’t be some toy for those with riyals to burn. It might be a losing battle but some of us will rail against the nefarious influence of money on sport until we die or retire or find something else to gibber about. Footnote: If you intend to write an angry email in response to the above, please come up with something better than silly whataboutism about buying petrol and using Uber, in which the Saudis have invested a large chunk of change along with other US companies.

The 57-year-old has many favourable attributes that make him a great operator, but I’ve been told several times — by players, coaches, and officials — that his strongest is his ability to rip out a match-day oratory that would put Al Pacino in the final scenes of Any Given Sunday to shame.

After working as an undercover drug squad operative and then police prosecutor, Newham pivoted into acting, gaining entry to the prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which counts Robert Redford , Danny deVito and Adrien Brody among its alumni. Two years after quitting the police force, he landed a role as a deranged murderer in the 2006 movie Isolated , a psychological thriller. “It was strange playing the sort of person I used to arrest,” Newham told this masthead in 2005.

Anyone familiar with cricket knows scenarios such as this have a tendency to get players’ backs up. She knew it, too, and just as the captain of the slighted team approached to protest, made a split-second decision to own her mistake. “He was about to ask a question but I actually stopped him and said ‘I know I’ve missed that’, and it stopped him in his tracks because he didn’t know what to say then,” Polosak, 35, said. “Once umpires acknowledge it, sometimes players are like ‘oh, OK, how can I argue with that?’.” Claire Polosak inspects conditions after rain stops play during a Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Credit: Rick Rycroft/AP Polosak’s resume spans two decades across the men’s and women’s games. She makes a lot more good decisions than she does bad and could recite the Laws of Cricket in her sleep. But perhaps her greatest strength is her understanding that, while the rules of the game are revised only occasionally, the human condition can change by the second. It is partly why abuse of officials by players, coaches and fans continues to make headlines, and partly why referees and umpires – particularly those without access to high-performance training – can feel overwhelmed by the pressure of navigating the grey areas of emotion and subjectivity that come with managing other people. The Australian Sports Commission has sought to tackle this through a new free training and education program to be offered to the country’s one million community sports officials – many of whom are volunteers and under 18 and operating without the help of technology – to develop communication and rapport-building. Cameron Tradell, the ASC’s director of coaching and officiating, says the organisation has met with more than 36 sports, including Australian rules, cricket, netball and wheelchair basketball to understand their needs before updating guidelines largely unchanged since the turn of the century. ‘Umpires are meant to start perfect and get better.’ Claire Polosak “It is about creating support for officials in their relations with players or athletes,” Tradell said. “So, how do you have respectful conversations? How do you understand different people’s needs? How do you get to understand, monitor and evaluate emotion? They are the sorts of things we want to provide so that it is not just transactional, but more of a personalised approach.” Tradell said sentiment is heavily skewed against officials, who are often pilloried for an error even though they are just as fallible as players. The key, he says, is giving them the skills to gain respect through clear, individualised communication. Loading “I’ve been at grounds and witnessed moments that have gone one of two ways, and it came down to the quality of the interactions with the referee,” he said. “They’ve come across and explained in a really clear, concise way, what is unacceptable behaviour and what they don’t want to see moving forward – so actually having that conversation before it gets to the point that it blows up.” The training, which follows last year’s launch of its modern coaching approach , will be delivered via online courses, and then each sport will offer additional, more nuanced sport-specific classes appropriate to the level, age group and region. The ASC hopes the guidelines, which will eventually phase out the general principles of officiating from 2000, will help stop the decline in the number of grassroots officials and increase inclusivity. “Umpires are meant to start perfect and get better – it’s the nature of the beast – but we’re only human,” says Polosak, who endured a “baptism of fire” when she started umpiring men’s club cricket in her hometown of Goulburn at the age of 15. In 2021, she became the first woman to officiate at a men’s Test match. “It’s part one of the reasons why so many people love umpiring sports because it’s about the challenge and getting better, and reading the situation and knowing how to react. There is so much more to good officiating than the rules and the laws. “Really, we’re in the people management game, so any skills we can provide people right from the outset is easier than trying to introduce things later on. “It’s bigger than emotional intelligence, but that’s certainly part of it. But being able to communicate clearly and manage conflict with different people is really important.” News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Steve Smith has officially thrown down the gauntlet to England ahead of the Ashes, daring them to test their mettle against the mighty Australian bowlers. Coming off the field with yet another ton under his belt, a confident Smith declared, “they haven‘t come up against us yet”, taunting England’s batsmen to come after them as Australia’s attack dominated the Indian top order on day two . England, known for their fearless and attacking brand of cricket under new coach Brendon McCullum, have enjoyed a sensational run over the past year. They have set the cricketing world on fire, unleashing a relentless barrage of runs against New Zealand, South Africa, and Pakistan, securing a staggering 11 victories from 13 matches. But one by one, critics have taken aim at England‘s ultra-aggressive style, expecting them to buckle under the pressure. Yet, to everyone’s surprise, Stokes and his band of daredevils have continued their rampage, refusing to let their foot off the throttle. Enter Australia, swaggering onto the scene with an air of supreme confidence. Smith, the enigmatic Australian batsman, left no doubt about his side’s ability to dismantle England’s preferred style of play after his bowlers squeezed India at the Oval. With the likes of Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, Mitchell Starc, Cameron Green, and spinner Nathan Lyon wreaking havoc, India found themselves struggling at 5/151 and 318 runs behind. When asked if England’s attacking approach would succeed against their formidable bowling lineup, Smith responded with a sly grin. Smith has become a force to be reckoned with in English conditions, boasting an astonishing record of seven centuries and accumulating a jaw-dropping 774 runs in the 2019 Ashes at an average of 110.57. “I think I said it initially when ’Bazball’ started that I’m intrigued to see how it goes against our bowlers. I’ve said that all along,” he said. Smith continued to stoke the flames, questioning whether the quality of The Oval pitch would suit the out-and-out assault.

So, we’ll see.” Smith agreed that England have enjoyed a sensational run over the past year but warned they ‘haven’t come up against’ Australia’s bowlers yet. Smith’s comments came after he notched his 31st Test century, spending over five-and-a-half hours at the crease to compile an imperious 121 runs. Partnering with the audacious Travis Head, who smashed a remarkable 163, the duo amassed a partnership of 285 runs. The knock has done much to quench speculation over whether Smith could recreate the form seen during his last tour of England. His astonishing record only seems to get better, with his ton placing him equal with Joe Root for most centuries against India, ever. His knock has also pushed his average at The Oval to an incredible 102.40. ð 9 innings ð¥ 1,038 runs ð® 115.33 average ð¯ Five centuries, three fifties Steve Smith's recent Test record in England is absurd ð¤¯ #AUSvIND #WTCFinal pic.twitter.com/mpWll2RUyL — Wisden (@WisdenCricket) June 8, 2023 Most Test centuries against India: 9 - Joe Root, STEVE SMITH 8 - Ricky Ponting, Viv Richards, Garry Sobers #WTC23 — Nic Savage (@nic_savage1) June 8, 2023 Smith has become a force to be reckoned with in English conditions, boasting an astonishing record of seven centuries and accumulating a jaw-dropping 774 runs in the 2019 Ashes at an average of 110.57. His overall average England over the past nine Tests has amounted to 1,038 runs at 115.33, with scores of 143, 144, 142, 92, 211, 82, 80, 23 and 121. “It was nice to spend a lot of time out there against some good bowlers on a challenging wicket after getting sent in,” he said. “I‘ll take a lot of confidence out of that and hopefully can keep building and have a successful summer here. “I think in terms of English wickets, it‘s probably as close to Australia as you get. I’ve enjoyed playing here, and it was nice to score a few out here again.” The Aussie bowlers immediately stood up as India opened its innings, with the four quicks each taking a wicket in the first four dismissals. Scott Boland starred in the opening overs, following Pat Cummins’ suit when he dismissed Rohit Sharma LBW for 15, by bowling Shubman Gill, who didn’t play a shot only to be bowled. Bizarrely, Cameron Green’s wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara was a near carbon copy of Gill’s dismissal. Mitchell Starc joined the party with a sharp bouncing ball catching the top of Virat Kohli’s bat with Steve Smith taking a high catch in the slips. All eyes will be on India to see if they can salvage the match on Day Three, which begins at 7.30pm AEST tonight.

With Australia having won the previous Ashes series at home in the 2021-22 season by 4-0, England will be aiming to avenge the loss in their home territory. Australia will also be aiming to win their first Ashes series in England in over 20 years. The hosts are also charged up by the ‘Bazball’ revolution brought by skipper Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum, which has seen England win 11 of their last 13 Tests and dominate their opponents with an attacking, aggressive and positive cricket that aims for victory, or a result at least. The history of the series dates back to August 1882, when Australia toured England for a Test match. The match, held at The Oval was a low-scoring affair. In the first innings, Australia was skittled out for 63, with Jack Blackham (17) top scoring. Dick Barlow (5/19) and Ted Peate (4/31) set the tone for the rest of the match. England got a slender lead of 38 runs as they were bowled out for 101, with George Ulyett (26) being the top-scorer. Frederick Spofforth took 7/46 for Australia. However, despite a fifty by Hugh Massie (55), Australia could make only 122 runs in their second innings, leaving England with 85 to chase. Ted Peate (4/40) bowled really well for England again. WG Grace made a commanding 32 at the top but the rest of the batting side failed him. England was bundled out for 77, left just seven short of a win. This was Australia’s first-ever win on English soil. This loss left fans stunned, who were not much used to seeing their heroes lose at home. The Sporting Times, a British newspaper back then expressed their dissapointment with the team’s performance with a mock obituary that suggested that the ‘English Cricket had died’. “In Affectionate Remembrance OF ENGLISH CRICKET, WHICH DIED AT THE OVAL ON 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. R. I. P. N.B.–The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,” read the obituary that intensified the rivalry between two cricketing powerhouses. For years, this rivalry would be a major source of bread and butter for cricket administrators and bodies as they carried on their mission of expanding the sport, which later created rivalries like England vs India, India vs Pakistan, Australia vs New Zealand etc. A small terracotta urn, believed to be having ashes of a burnt cricket bail, became a symbol of cricket’s biggest rivalry and an object over which sport’s biggest icons would fight their hearts out on the field. Before England travelled to Australia in 1882-83, skipper Ivo Bligh expressed his commitment to the cause of “regaining the ashes”. Bligh proved to be a man of his word, defeating Australia in Australia in the series 2-1. Since then, a total of 72 Ashes series have been played since 1882, with England winning 32, Australia winning 34 and six ending in a draw. Ever since 1882, England and Australia have played a total of 340 Test matches, out of which Australia has won 140, England has won 108 and 92 have ended in a draw. In the 12 Ashes series played in the 21st century, Australia has won six, England has won five and one ended in a draw. Australia’s Don Bradman is the top run-maker in the Ashes. In 37 matches, he has scored 5,028 runs at an average of 89.50. He has scored 19 centuries and 12 fifties in his Ashes career, with best score of 334. Following him is England’s Jack Hobbs. In 41 matches, 3,636 runs at an average of 54.26. He has 12 centuries and 15 fifties, with the best score of 187. At the third position is Australia’s Allan Border. In 42 matches, he has scored 3,222 runs at an average of 55.55. He has a total of seven centuries and 19 fifties, with a best score of 200*. The top three run-scorers for Australia are – Bradman (5,028 runs), Border (3,222 runs) and Steve Waugh (3,173 runs at an average of 58.75, with 10 centuries and 14 fifties). The top three-run scorers for England are – Jack Hobbs (3,636 runs), David Gower (3,037 runs in 38 matches at an average of 46.01 with nine centuries and 11 fifties) and Wally Hammond (2,853 runs at an average of 38.07 with nine centuries and seven centuries). Coming to the bowlers, the highest wicket-taker in The Ashes is late spin great Shane Warne, who has 195 wickets in 36 matches at an average of 23.25, with best figures of 8/71. In the second spot is Australia’s Glenn McGrath. He has 157 wickets in 30 matches, with an average of 20.92 and best figures of 8/38. The third is Australia’s Hugh Trumble, who has 141 scalps in 31 matches, with an average of 20.88 and best figures of 8/65. These are also the top-three wicket-takers for Australia in the Ashes. For England, they are, Stuart Broad (131 wickets in 35 balls, with best figures of 8/15), Ian Botham (128 wickets in 32 matches with best figures of 6/95) and Bob Willis (123 wickets in 31 matches with best figures of 8/43).

India collapsed to 4-71 before recovering somewhat to be 5-151 at stumps on the second day in reply to Australia’s 469 at stumps. Nathan Lyon gets in on the action by dismissing Ravindra Jadeja. Credit: Getty Images Australia’s innings was built around a 285-run partnership between Smith (121) and Travis Head (163). Smith resumed on 95 and brought up his 31st Test century flicking successive boundaries off the first over of the day. He now averages 102 at the Oval with three centuries in four innings and his overall career average is back above 60 in rarefied air. Smith questioned how England could succeed with their “Bazball” approach in conditions like those offered up at the Oval. “I think it will be difficult on this kind of wicket that’s up and down and seaming around,” he said. “It’s not easy to defend, let alone come out and swing. “I’m intrigued to see how it goes against our bowlers. I’ve said that all along. They’ve obviously done well against some other attacks, but they haven’t come up against us yet, so we’ll see. “It’s obviously been exciting to watch. I must say I’ve enjoyed watching the way they’ve played and the way they’ve turned things around in the last 12 months or so, but we’ll wait and see how it comes off against us.” India were momentarily 5-87 when captain Pat Cummins was awarded his second wicket, Ajinkya Rahane leg before wicket for 17, until replays confirmed a no ball. “Obviously that hurt. No balls are costly and you want your bowlers behind the line as much as possible,” Smith said. “Jinx is still out there so yeah, no balls are never good.” India have won just nine Tests in England going back through 20 series to 1932. Loading On Thursday, their top three all fell to wobble seam deliveries that cut back into the right-handers, with Cummins beginning the rot in the sixth over of India’s innings, claiming opposing skipper Rohit Sharma leg before wicket for 15. Worse followed when Scott Boland replaced a wayward Mitchell Starc after just two expensive overs and was immaculate, eventually tempting Shubman Gill (13) into leaving a delivery that came back and crashed into his middle and off stumps. The often impenetrable Cheteshwar Pujara (14) did the same, offering his off stump to a delighted Cameron Green. Starc played just one Test on the 2019 tour of England because of problems with his accuracy real and imagined. The big left-armer had similar problems on Thursday, conceding a run a ball, but the quickest of Australia’s bowlers delivered a nasty short ball to Virat Kohli (14). It took the right glove and flew to a leaping Steve Smith, who took a fine overhead catch at second slip. Pat Cummins celebrates taking the wicket of Rohit Sharma. Credit: AP Boland’s continued impressive performances, conceding just two an over while troubling the batsmen with constant seam moment, makes for intriguing selections around the make-up of Australia’s team for the first Ashes Test in Edgbaston next week. The Victorian seamer is playing this Test because Josh Hazlewood was considered not quite ready after returning from the IPL early with a minor side niggle. Hazlewood was expected to be ready for the Ashes, but the selectors have added Michael Neser to the Test squad for the first Test as cover. Smith claimed Boland offered variety to Australia’s attack. “I think the angles he provides, his ability to hit the stumps from slightly shorter than some of our other bowlers, is a big plus,” said Smith. “[It’s] something that I think Neser can do as well ... shorter guys that are a bit skiddier. If there’s any seam movement, it gives the ball more chance to move and still hit the stumps. “The skills he possesses are magnificent. He’s turned up every time he’s had an opportunity. So whether he’s leaving any of the big three out, I don’t know the answer to that, but he’s certainly a quality prospect, as we’ve seen for a couple of years now.” News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Smith, 95 not out overnight, followed team-mate Travis Head in going to three figures with 121 in a first-innings total of 469 at The Oval. Fast bowler Pat Cummins, in his 50th Test, then removed opposing skipper Rohit Sharma to initiate India’s second-day slump. Ajinkya Rahane (29 not out), struck some painful blows on the glove, held firm with Ravindra Jadeja (48) after India had been reduced to 71-4. But India were 151-5 at stumps, a huge deficit of 318 runs. Rohit was plumb lbw for 15 to a full-length ball from Cummins, who had close figures of 1-36 in nine overs. Four balls later, India were 30-2 when Shubman Gill (13) was bowled playing no shot to Scott Boland after being deceived by a sharp off-cutter. England’s Stuart Broad tried to rile Australia before the WTC Final by saying he hoped Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli kept Cummins’s men in the field for a long time ahead of next week’s first Ashes Test at Edgbaston. But both senior India batsmen fell for 14 on Thursday. Pujara was bowled leaving a delivery from all-rounder Cameron Green and Kohli was undone by a spiteful, lifting ball from Mitchell Starc that took the shoulder of the bat, with Smith holding an excellent leaping catch above his head at second slip. Left-hander Jadeja defied Australia in an aggressive 51-ball knock featuring seven fours and a six. But he succumbed to off-spinner Nathan Lyon, edging a well-flighted and turning delivery to slip in a tame end to a stand of 71 with Rahane. “We are in a really good spot so hopefully we can get a few more wickets in the morning,” Boland told Sky Sports. “The pitch is going a little bit up and down so it should be harder for the India batters tomorrow (Friday).” India were facing a potentially huge Australian first-innings total with Smith and Head (163) at the crease. But their pacemen struck as Australia lost four wickets for 41 runs, including Head and Smith, to slip from 361-3 to 402-7. India bowled out Australia after lunch, fast bowler Mohammed Siraj taking 4-108 from 28.3 overs. Smith reached three figures in the opening over on Thursday, joining compatriot Steve Waugh on seven Test hundreds in England. Among non-England batters, only Australia great Don Bradman, with 11 centuries, has scored more. Smith’s 31st Test century left him 12th on the all-time list. Head extended his first overseas Test century to 150 but a short ball proved his undoing when he tried to whip Siraj legside and gloved a catch to wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat. Head’s dismissal ended an impressive stand of 285 runs with Smith after they had come together with Australia in trouble at 76-3. Shardul Thakur then captured the prized wicket of Smith, who inside-edged an outswinger into his stumps to the delight of the large India contingent in a crowd of over 23,000. The WTC is the only major men’s cricket trophy Australia have yet to win. India are appearing in their second WTC final, having lost to New Zealand in the inaugural 2021 showpiece match in Southampton.
