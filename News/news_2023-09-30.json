There had looked to be only one outcome as Nottinghamshire, having been set a target of 207 in a generous 58 overs by Middlesex skipper Toby Roland-Jones, progressed to 64 without loss and then 106 for one. Thank you for your outstanding support this season ü§ù We'll see you back in Division One next year üëä ‚Äî Kent Cricket (@KentCricket) But on a dry, turning pitch on a sunny afternoon, spinners Jayant Yadav, Josh De Caires and Sam Robson ‚Äì who finished with a career-best four for 46 with his leg spin ‚Äì reduced the home side to 157 for seven and suddenly a great escape looked on. However, Matt Montgomery (34 not out) held the tail together to drag Nottinghamshire across the line at eight down, with 16 balls to spare, and left Kent celebrating survival despite being frustrated by dogged Lancashire resistance. Third-placed Hampshire became just the second team to beat Surrey across their back-to-back title-winning campaigns. Only Lancashire had beaten Surrey in 2022 and 2023 in red-ball cricket, winning once in either campaign. But Liam Dawson took his season tally to 49 wickets by claiming two of the four scalps needed to secure victory at the Ageas Bowl, with Surrey only scoring 20 of the 73 required to lose by 52 runs before 11am. Despite the defeat, Surrey were presented with the Division One trophy by England and Wales Cricket Board chair Richard Thompson. Warwickshire and Somerset‚Äôs rain-hit clash ended in an expected draw. The Division One contest was officially abandoned just after lunch on the final day when, with the sun shining, the umpires ruled that areas of the field remained unsafe. Somerset had been 90 for two in the second innings, a lead of 32. The result saw Warwickshire end the campaign in fourth with Somerset seventh. In Division Two, Shan Masood‚Äôs brilliant 123 helped Yorkshire chase down a final-day target of 360 to beat promoted Worcestershire at Headingley and avoid finishing bottom for only the second time in their history. Yorkshire‚Äôs fourth-highest successful run chase was achieved with relative comfort in the end, with six wickets in hand and three overs of the allotted 70 remaining. And that‚Äôs a wrap! Thank you to all our incredible members and supporters for every bit of support this season ü´∂ It means the world üíô ‚Äî Yorkshire CCC (@YorkshireCCC) With the game meandering ahead of day four, both sides opted to contrive a finish, with Yorkshire risking the draw which would lift them off the bottom of Division Two. As it was, they were able to achieve that by going for broke as captain Masood hit 15 fours in 131 balls. Sussex took just 45 minutes to complete a 339-run victory that condemned Gloucestershire to a winless season and bottom spot. The hosts took only 9.5 overs to achieve a third victory of the campaign after Gloucestershire resumed on 113 for five, needing another 400 runs. Durham sealed an emphatic victory over Leicestershire by an innings and 141 runs to end their title-winning campaign on a high. The home side required 10 wickets to secure their seventh victory of the campaign at Seat Unique Riverside and took only 42.5 overs to tear through the Leicestershire batting line-up. The Durham bowlers shared the wickets around as Vishwa Fernando and Matt Parkinson claimed three apiece, while Matthew Potts, Ben Raine and Jonathan Bushnell also struck. The hosts took 24 points from the contest, ending the term with a mammoth total of 233. Leus Du Plooy‚Äôs last game for Derbyshire ended in a draw despite another Luis Reece century as their side came up four wickets short after setting Glamorgan a target of 384 to win on the final day in 70 overs. Derbyshire had eight fielders around the bat in the chase for wickets but eventually called time one over short at 5.37pm as the game petered out into a draw with Glamorgan on 135 for six. Derbyshire finished sixth in the table and Glamorgan fifth.","pubDate":"2023-09-29 18:39:41","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/17282124/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","source_priority":435041,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"1030b7dfc670c8e593162c3d10eaa3c3","title":"‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§°‡§∞-17 ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ö‡•à‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§®‡§∂‡§ø‡§™ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ","link":"https://jantaserishta.com/sports/baramulla-won-the-title-of-under-17-provincial-cricket-championship-2860721","keywords":["‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤"],"creator":["Manish Sahu"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"‡§ú‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∂‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§∞:ÔøΩ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§â‡§≠‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§®‡•á ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§´‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡•å‡§∂‡§≤ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤‡§ó‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§°‡§∞-17 ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§®‡§∂‡§ø‡§™ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§®‡§Ç‡§§‡§®‡§æ‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ú‡§ø‡§§ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ö‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ä 5 ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§® ‡§π‡•Å‡§Ü‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§´‡•à‡§ú‡§æ‡§® ‡§á‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§´‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è \"‡§Æ‡•à‡§® ‡§ë‡§´ ‡§¶ ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú\" ‡§î‡§∞ \"‡§Æ‡•à‡§® ‡§ë‡§´ ‡§¶ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö\" ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§ ‡§ú‡§§‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§Ç‡§π ‡§°‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§à‡§è‡§∏‡§ì ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§â‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§ñ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§â‡§™‡§≤‡§¨‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§ï ‡§¨‡§ß‡§æ‡§à ‡§¶‡•Ä‡•§ ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ, ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§® ‡§ï‡•á‡§µ‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•É‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤ ‡§á‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§è‡§ï ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à, ‡§¨‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡§ø ‡§π‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§ü ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§™‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§≠‡§æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§£ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•á‡§ñ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡•§","pubDate":"2023-09-29 18:30:09","image_url":"https://jantaserishta.com/h-upload/2023/09/29/3479047-gk.avif","source_id":"jantaserishta","source_priority":6826860,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"article_id":"f488908c6e8bdf6510e02d609c064600","title":"Mehidy Hasan Miraz Shines As Bangladesh Trump Sri Lanka by Seven Wickets in ICC World Cup 2023 Warm-Up Match","link":"https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/sports-news-bangladesh-beat-sri-lanka-by-seven-wickets-in-world-cup-warm-up-match-5451114.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bangladesh handed Sri Lanka a crushing seven-wicket defeat in their first warm-up match of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 on Friday to make a winning start.","content":"Guwahati, Sep 29: Bangladesh handed Sri Lanka a crushing seven-wicket defeat in their first warm-up match of the ICC ODI World Cup, here on Friday to make a winning start. Chasing 264, Bangladesh rode on half-centuries from top-order batters Tanzid Hasan (84), Litton Das (61) and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (67 not out) to romp home in 42 overs at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium. Hasan cracked 10 fours and two sixes to make a sturdy 84 off 88 balls, while Das hit 10 fours in his 56-ball 61. The two batters added 131 for the opening wicket.

stay in Division One of the LV= Insurance County Championship is over, although they at least went down with a fight on a dramatic final day at Trent Bridge.","content":"In a match they ultimately had to win following Kent‚Äôs draw against Lancashire to avoid joining Northamptonshire in Division Two next season, there had looked to be only one outcome as skipper Toby Roland-Jones set Nottingham a target of just 207 in a generous 58 overs. But on a dry, turning pitch on a beautifully sunny last afternoon, spinners Jayant Yadav, Josh De Caires and Sam Robson - who finished with a career-best 4-46 with his leg spin - gave the home side a real scare before Matt Montgomery (34 not out) held the tail together to drag Nottinghamshire across the line at eight down, with 16 balls to spare. Fittingly, it was number 10 Jake Ball - in his final appearance for Nottinghamshire - who swept Robson for the winning boundary. Earlier, as Nottinghamshire set fields that allowed Middlesex to set the game up, Robson hit an 109-ball unbeaten 105 that contained only three fours, and De Caires 49 from 47 as the two shared an 83-run sixth-wicket partnership before the declaration came, with Roland-Jones needing to take a gamble if his bowlers were to have any chance of taking 10 wickets on a pitch that, while taking spin, was still essentially a good surface for batting. Hutton‚Äôs 2-38 had confirmed him as the season‚Äôs leading wicket-taker across both divisions on 62 and as Ben Slater added a 49 to his first-innings 140 Nottinghamshire looked to be cruising on 133-2. There had been only sporadic glimmers of hope for Middlesex. Haseeb Hameed, without a hundred this year after four in 2022, pulled Tom Helm straight to square leg in the 16th over. Ten overs later, John Simpson executed a sharp stumping to enable De Caires to end Steven Mullaney‚Äôs progress at 30 from 34 balls. But then wickets came in consecutive overs twice as the turning ball suddenly became a potent weapon. Joe Clarke was bowled by off-spinner Yadav for 22 in the 31st, before Slater was leg before to Robson in the 32nd. Tom Moores was caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep off Robson in the 36th and Lyndon James leg before on the back foot to Yadav in the 37th, leaving Nottinghamshire 152-6, still 55 short of the target. And the odds looked to be tipping firmly in Middlesex‚Äôs favour as Robson bowled Calvin Harrison in the 40th, giving Robson career-best figures with the ball as a bonus. But Montgomery played the spinners well and Hutton brought a calm authority to proceedings, the pair adding 45 for the seventh wicket. There was still for one more scare as Hutton, with just five needed, swiped at Robson to be caught behind. But Ball kept his nerve to get the job done, punching the air as his sweep off Robson beat the infield, achieving a fourth win of the season and a sixth-place finish for Nottinghamshire, who were promoted with Middlesex as Division Two champions last year. At the start of the day, with just one slip in place as Ball bowled the opening delivery with a ball just three overs old, it was clear that Nottinghamshire were happy to let Middlesex progress at their own pace towards the declaration they had in mind. Quite soon there were no slips and ultimately nine Nottinghamshire players stationed by the boundary rope. The wonder was that Middlesex managed to lose five wickets in taking their total to 177 in the 29 overs up to lunch, although Stevie Eskinazi‚Äôs freakish demise capped an unfortunate match for the South African-born player. His firm drive towards mid-on hit Robson on the foot at the non-striker‚Äôs end and rolled gently towards Mullaney, the bowler, who picked up the ball and lobbed it to wicketkeeper Tom Moores with Eskinazi, who had copped one on the helmet on day one, hopelessly stranded. Either side of this moment of comedy - dark comedy from a Middlesex point of view - Mark Stoneman picked out Lyndon James at deep mid-wicket and Max Holden fell to an excellent catch by Ball at third man as Hutton extended his wickets tally for the season to 62. Dane Paterson raised his own total to 50 - for the third consecutive season - by having Ryan Higgins caught behind off a thin edge and Mullaney removed Simpson via a much thicker edge, a steepler that Moores had to run to backward point to take. A 47-ball 49 by De Caires either side of lunch helped things along, with the young off-spinner lofting Ball into the Fox Road stand beyond square leg before he was caught at deep extra flinging the bat. It gave Ball his final wicket as a Nottinghamshire player - and the first from the Stuart Broad End, as the pavilion end here will henceforth be known following a lunchtime announcement in the presence of the retired England pace bowler. Moments later, Robson completed his third hundred of the season, Middlesex declared, mindful mostly of how many overs their bowlers might need to have any chance of taking 10 wickets, and Ball led his team-mates off the field for the last time. Another county will surely find room for him next season. Roland-Jones said: ‚ÄúWe knew coming into this game that we had to try to force a result and coming into today we had a pretty clear picture. We asked the guys to give it everything and to truly believe that every result was possible and I think that showed on the pitch in the way we have hung in when they were one down for 100-odd, knowing that once we got one we could start to make things tricky for them on a turning pitch. ‚ÄúWe took it right down to the wire but it just wasn‚Äôt to be unfortunately. But I‚Äôm definitely proud of the guys today, but we will look back over the season and say that on other occasions in close games where we have been outwrestled and not able to compete as we have done over the four days here. ‚ÄúThe frustration is that on a wearing wicket on the last day we were in a good position, but I think fundamentally as a group over the course of a 14-game season we have not found our true form and found ourselves in a situation with which you can‚Äôt really argue.‚Äù Head coach Richard Johnson added: ‚ÄúWe had a figure in mind that we were comfortable defending and that would leave ourselves enough time to get 10 wickets. That worked out perfectly, I felt Sam Robson anchored the innings beautifully while everyone played around him and that set up the game for our bowlers to put them as much under pressure as they could. ‚ÄúWhen we had them seven down I felt there was a real opportunity but their guys dug in well at the end. We've talked all year about how much harder playing cricket is in the First Division compared with the Second Division. We couldn‚Äôt cope with that at the start and it has taken up until these last three or four games to start to perform and put our best foot forward. ‚ÄúIt has come too late but what it means is that we can start next season with positivity about how we approach our cricket. We know we can play First Division cricket but we have to build a team now that not only can we compete in Second Division cricket but when we come back up we can compete and push these boys. ‚ÄúIn First Division cricket you have to be switched on from the start and our total of just two batting points all season before this game shows clearly where we have let ourselves down. ‚ÄúWe are gutted and disappointed with the way we have been relegated this year. We know we are a better side than that but we have to show it consistently week in, week out.‚Äù *copy from Jon Culley/Reporters Network","pubDate":"2023-09-29 18:03:55","image_url":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/resources/images/17282079/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"time_series","source_priority":668753,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"feef8bfbc073617213d3f96300e25060","title":"Al-Attiyah's multi-sport genius is of a rare kind","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/alattiyahs-multi-sport-genius-is-of-a-rare-kind-101696009190784.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 52-year-old is a five-time Dakar Rally champion and has been making his mark in shooting as well","content":"In January, Nasser Al-Attiyah was flying through the hills and dunes that dot the landscape of Saudi Arabia, driving his Toyota Hilux to pick up a fifth title at the dangerous yet celebrated Dakar Rally. Al-Attiyah picked up shooting hoping it would help him focus better in rallying.(PTI) Nine months later, with a shotgun perched on his shoulder, the Qatari was shooting clay targets at the Fuyang Yinhu Sports Centre in Hangzhou to help his country win two medals ‚Äì a team silver and an individual bronze ‚Äì in skeet shooting at the Asian Games. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The two medals account for half of Qatar‚Äôs tally in Hangzhou, clinched by someone who is 52 and doesn‚Äôt shoot all-year round. In fact, Al-Attiyah picked up shooting hoping it would help him focus better in rallying. But the 52-year-old became such a pro at it that he clinched gold medals at the 2001, 2006 and 2012 Asian Shooting Championships and 2002 and 2010 Asian Games before also claiming a bronze at the 2012 London Olympics. ‚ÄúWhen I am competing in rally driving, no skeet training. Nothing, zero training. I didn't do training for the (Asian) Games. I used my experience and this is why I have two medals here at the Asian Games,‚Äù Al-Attiyah was quoted as saying by AFP. The Qatari‚Äôs feat is nothing short of remarkable given the demands of modern sport and the toll it takes on athletes today. Gone are the days of CB Fry, who played for England at cricket and football, and equalled the world record for the long jump or American athlete Jim Thorpe (he won two gold medals in the 1912 Summer Olympics, one in classic pentathlon and the other in decathlon. He also played American football (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball) or ‚ÄòBullet‚Äô Bob Hayes, who excelled as a sprinter winning the 100m and 4x100m gold at the 1964 Olympics and then made a mark in the National Football League. The great Carl Lewis was a champion sprinter and long jumper as well. But it is increasingly becoming very difficult in this day and age to shift one‚Äôs focus outside his or her discipline. With competitions throughout the year ‚Äì there is no off season now across sport ‚Äì athletes have to train through the year, participate in multiple competitions to qualify for the bigger ones and most importantly have to manage their training and schedule so that they peak during the major tournaments. There have been some names who have played at the highest level in two different sports. Take Ashleigh Barty for example. The Australian played three disciplines in tennis, reached finals of Grand Slams then decided to switch to cricket for a couple of years where she played 50 over as well as T20 cricket at the highest domestic level before returning to tennis again to win three singles Grand Slam crowns, one doubles Major and an Olympic medal! The great Michael Jordan too surprised the world when he retired in 1993. Having ‚Äúlost the desire to play basketball‚Äù, Jordan made a move to his childhood love of baseball only to realise that succeeding in basketball was different than winning in baseball. He eventually made a return to the sport that gave him name, fame and money. There have been others too like Ric Charlesworth, who played cricket and hockey simultaneously. But athletes playing more than one sport is increasingly becoming a rarity which is why we will unlikely get to see more of the likes of Al-Attiyah, who not just compete in sports that are at the opposite ends of the spectrum but also excel in it. Al-Attiyah's achievement is nothing short of incredible. To win at the Dakar Rally, competing against the very best rally raid drivers in the world like Sebastien Loeb or Carlos Sainz Senior to win medals in shooting at not just the Asian but also global level (Olympics) requires a special kind of perseverance. Al-Attiyah did not stop at two sports either. He also tried his hand at horse riding and also competed in powerboat racing, finishing second at the 2013 Superboat World Championships in Key West, Florida. The 52-year-old won a team skeet gold at the 2002 Busan Asian Games and returned to the continental showpiece eight years later to bag another gold in the same event before also taking home a bronze in the individual event in Guangzhou. He returned to the podium twice at Hangzhou with a men's skeet team silver and skeet individual bronze without even touching the shotgun before reaching China as he was busy rallying. Now, the five-time Dakar champion is targetting the 2024 Paris Games, having competed in all Olympics from 1996 to 2016 before missing Tokyo. He doesn't intend to take part in the regular International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) competitions and will only take part in the Olympic qualifiers. \"I am not in the ISSF competitions at the moment because I am also a professional rally driver. I am so busy. The next (Olympic qualification) competition will be in (South) Korea (in October). There are two quota places. I hope to take one to be in Paris,‚Äù he said. Al-Attiyah said that rallying and shooting may be completely different sports but some of the skills needed applied to both. ‚ÄúStrength, mind strength,\" he said. ‚ÄúRallying is very difficult. We are competing at a high level in rallying. It is not easy to rally and shoot at a high level, but every sport helps.\" Indeed, every sport helps. \"Exciting news!

Barring the openers, Pakistan batters including Mohammad Rizwan (103 retired hurt off 91), Babar Azam (80 off 84) and Saud Shaukeel (75 off 53) had a good hit in the middle, helping their team post a daunting 345 for five in 50 overs. New Zealand cruised to the target in 43.4 overs with contributions from Ravindra (97 off 72), Williamson (54 off 50), Daryl Mitchell (59 retired hurt off 57) and Mark Chapman (65 not out off 41). Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Other Australian Cricketers Have Fun Time in Kerala Ahead of ICC World Cup 2023 Warm-Up Game Against Netherlands (Watch Video) . While Pakistan had all 15 squad members to choose from in the first of their two practice games before the tournament proper, New Zealand had the option of trying out 14 players with Tim Southee yet to arrive in India as he continues to recover from a thumb injury. Ravindra, batting at the top in place of Will Young, gave the team management another opening option alongside Devon Conway, who lasted only one ball in the steep run chase. With the focus firmly on managing players' workload ahead of the main competition, Williamson walked back into the dressing room after scoring a sublime half-century. Williamson, who continues his knee rehabilitation from the injury he suffered in the IPL in March, only came out to bat on Friday and will not be part of the World Cup opener against England on October 5. However, considering the way he batted against the Pakistan attack, it certainly seemed he was ready on the batting front if not the other areas of the game. A couple of backfoot punches in the cover region off a seriously quick Haris Rauf showed that Williamson was very much close to his best.Ravindra at the other end pretty much dealt in boundaries with his first 24 runs coming off only fours. His entertaining innings comprised 16 fours and a six. Number four Mitchell put New Zealand on the cusp of a comfortable win before retiring. Chapman and Jimmy Neesham then bullied an ordinary-looking Pakistan attack to pick up a confidence-boosting win for New Zealand.While the majority of the Pakistan batters would be pleased with their efforts, the bowlers have plenty to worry about. Star pacer Shaheen Afridi did not bowl in the game, allowing Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali to audition for the new ball in the absence of injured Naseem Shah.Rauf bowled only a four-over spell and leaked 36 runs without a wicket. Hasan Ali, who is back in the Pakistan set-up after nine months, was decent in his opening spell before going for runs in the later stages of the New Zealand innings. Leggie Shadab Khan did not bowl and Usama Mir (2/68 in 10) took a couple of wickets in his absence. Part-time spinner Salman Agha (1/60 in 8) was easy meat for the opposition and so was left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz (0/55 in 7). Mohammad Wasim Jr (1/58 in 7) too proved expensive on a tough day for the bowlers.

The Chinese fans, rattled by some exemplary shooting from Swapnil Suresh Kusale, roared for him to flounder. His eight years of international experience and countless routines behind him, Kusale stood ramrod straight under the spotlight. Fifty metres away waited the perfect tease ‚Äì the concentric rings that define his sport and the innermost dot that shooters work so hard to hit. The 21-year-old has medalled in each of his four competitions in Hangzhou.(PTI) Kusale didn‚Äôt need a 10.9. Moments ago, he had shot a jaw-dropping prone series that had pushed him to the gold medal position. No Indian had ever been there. Gagan Narang, an Asiad bronze medallist in 50m 3P, sat among the VIPs, his camera ready to capture the moment. Kusale had no business to fail, and yet when he pulled the trigger, a gasp of disbelief escaped from those present. The electronic scoreboard read 7.6. You rub your eyes and look again. It‚Äôs still 7.6. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Those in the Indian camp sank into their seats. Hands on head, eyes wide, mouth agape. They might as well have seen a ghost. Kusale stood motionless in Lane 2, but you could sense his heart break. The ignominy of a 7, the pain of squandering the chance of making history, the curse of the big final; you know he felt because, sitting in the arena, you felt it too. And then, the roar. A group of Chinese, delirious now, turn towards the Indians ‚Äì this correspondent included ‚Äì and burst out laughing. The mocking is so evident but you are dazed to look away. In one shot, Kusale had gone from gold medal position to fifth. Only two Indians had climbed the podium in 50m three positions at the Asiad before, none had won gold. On the verge of history, Kusale had combusted. He looks at his weapon for a moment that seems to last an eternity. He begins to pick the pieces of his equipment, and one would assume the shattered heart. He trudges back to the Indian corner, which slowly rises to applaud. That‚Äôs that then for him. Kusale had ended the kneeling segment of the competition (first 15 shots) at third, ending it fourth. The scoreboard shows a drop of one spot, but in less than an hour and between going from third to first to fourth, he has lived the microcosm of an athlete's life. The pulsating high of the three flawless prone series where his lowest hit was a 10 and the highest a 10.9 to the ripping low that saw him shoot a score that would put amateurs to shame. ‚ÄúWell, this is 3P. It is brutal,‚Äù Narang would say. ‚ÄúI have seen Olympic champions do much worse. It is a brutal discipline.‚Äù Kusale doesn't break down, at least not in public. From behind the shooting lane, his eyes are fixed on the scoreboard. Two lanes to his right, Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar is meeting an opposite fate. Having struggled in the kneeling and prone positions, he begins the standing round ‚Äì his favourite ‚Äì in fifth place. He claws his way back to third, drops to fifth, and rises to second as the pecking order changes with each shot. With Kusale out, the onus is on Tomar to deliver a medal, and the youngster has suddenly found his groove. He goes 10.6, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.3 in the elimination series to prevent a Chinese 1-2. Linshu Du is a bridge too far, but Jiaming Tian is pushed to third. Tomar needs a 10.7 to win, he manages a 9.7 instead. ‚ÄúI was thinking of shooting a perfect shot. But it didn‚Äôt go that way,‚Äù he would say. The silver though means the 21-year-old has medalled in each of his four competitions in Hangzhou. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling extremely good. We have been practicing very hard for this competition. Winning a medal means achieving my goals, and I‚Äôm very happy,‚Äù he said. Earlier, the men‚Äôs 3P team of Kusale, Tomar and Akhil Sheoran shot gold with a world record score of 1769. Tomar and Kusale led the charge with 591 points each followed by Sheoran, who shot 587. China‚Äôs Linshu Du, Hao Yu and Jiaming Tian were next with 1763 followed by South Korea‚Äôs Kim Sangdo, Kim Jong-hyun and Mo Dai-seong, who aggregated 1748. \"Exciting news!

There had looked to be only one outcome as Nottinghamshire, having been set a target of 207 in a generous 58 overs by Middlesex skipper Toby Roland-Jones, progressed to 64 without loss and then 106 for one. Thank you for your outstanding support this season ü§ù We'll see you back in Division One next year üëä ‚Äî Kent Cricket (@KentCricket) But on a dry, turning pitch on a sunny afternoon, spinners Jayant Yadav, Josh De Caires and Sam Robson ‚Äì who finished with a career-best four for 46 with his leg spin ‚Äì reduced the home side to 157 for seven and suddenly a great escape looked on. However, Matt Montgomery (34 not out) held the tail together to drag Nottinghamshire across the line at eight down, with 16 balls to spare, and left Kent celebrating survival despite being frustrated by dogged Lancashire resistance. Third-placed Hampshire became just the second team to beat Surrey across their back-to-back title-winning campaigns. Only Lancashire had beaten Surrey in 2022 and 2023 in red-ball cricket, winning once in either campaign. But Liam Dawson took his season tally to 49 wickets by claiming two of the four scalps needed to secure victory at the Ageas Bowl, with Surrey only scoring 20 of the 73 required to lose by 52 runs before 11am. Despite the defeat, Surrey were presented with the Division One trophy by England and Wales Cricket Board chair Richard Thompson. Warwickshire and Somerset‚Äôs rain-hit clash ended in an expected draw. The Division One contest was officially abandoned just after lunch on the final day when, with the sun shining, the umpires ruled that areas of the field remained unsafe. Somerset had been 90 for two in the second innings, a lead of 32. The result saw Warwickshire end the campaign in fourth with Somerset seventh. In Division Two, Shan Masood‚Äôs brilliant 123 helped Yorkshire chase down a final-day target of 360 to beat promoted Worcestershire at Headingley and avoid finishing bottom for only the second time in their history. Yorkshire‚Äôs fourth-highest successful run chase was achieved with relative comfort in the end, with six wickets in hand and three overs of the allotted 70 remaining. And that‚Äôs a wrap! Thank you to all our incredible members and supporters for every bit of support this season ü´∂ It means the world üíô ‚Äî Yorkshire CCC (@YorkshireCCC) With the game meandering ahead of day four, both sides opted to contrive a finish, with Yorkshire risking the draw which would lift them off the bottom of Division Two. As it was, they were able to achieve that by going for broke as captain Masood hit 15 fours in 131 balls. Sussex took just 45 minutes to complete a 339-run victory that condemned Gloucestershire to a winless season and bottom spot. The hosts took only 9.5 overs to achieve a third victory of the campaign after Gloucestershire resumed on 113 for five, needing another 400 runs. Durham sealed an emphatic victory over Leicestershire by an innings and 141 runs to end their title-winning campaign on a high. The home side required 10 wickets to secure their seventh victory of the campaign at Seat Unique Riverside and took only 42.5 overs to tear through the Leicestershire batting line-up. The Durham bowlers shared the wickets around as Vishwa Fernando and Matt Parkinson claimed three apiece, while Matthew Potts, Ben Raine and Jonathan Bushnell also struck. The hosts took 24 points from the contest, ending the term with a mammoth total of 233.

stay in Division One of the LV= Insurance County Championship is over, although they at least went down with a fight on a dramatic final day at Trent Bridge.","content":"In a match they ultimately had to win following Kent‚Äôs draw against Lancashire to avoid joining Northamptonshire in Division Two next season, there had looked to be only one outcome as skipper Toby Roland-Jones set Nottingham a target of just 207 in a generous 58 overs. But on a dry, turning pitch on a beautifully sunny last afternoon, spinners Jayant Yadav, Josh De Caires and Sam Robson - who finished with a career-best 4-46 with his leg spin - gave the home side a real scare before Matt Montgomery (34 not out) held the tail together to drag Nottinghamshire across the line at eight down, with 16 balls to spare. Fittingly, it was number 10 Jake Ball - in his final appearance for Nottinghamshire - who swept Robson for the winning boundary. Earlier, as Nottinghamshire set fields that allowed Middlesex to set the game up, Robson hit an 109-ball unbeaten 105 that contained only three fours, and De Caires 49 from 47 as the two shared an 83-run sixth-wicket partnership before the declaration came, with Roland-Jones needing to take a gamble if his bowlers were to have any chance of taking 10 wickets on a pitch that, while taking spin, was still essentially a good surface for batting. Hutton‚Äôs 2-38 had confirmed him as the season‚Äôs leading wicket-taker across both divisions on 62 and as Ben Slater added a 49 to his first-innings 140 Nottinghamshire looked to be cruising on 133-2. There had been only sporadic glimmers of hope for Middlesex. Haseeb Hameed, without a hundred this year after four in 2022, pulled Tom Helm straight to square leg in the 16th over. Ten overs later, John Simpson executed a sharp stumping to enable De Caires to end Steven Mullaney‚Äôs progress at 30 from 34 balls. But then wickets came in consecutive overs twice as the turning ball suddenly became a potent weapon. Joe Clarke was bowled by off-spinner Yadav for 22 in the 31st, before Slater was leg before to Robson in the 32nd. Tom Moores was caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep off Robson in the 36th and Lyndon James leg before on the back foot to Yadav in the 37th, leaving Nottinghamshire 152-6, still 55 short of the target. And the odds looked to be tipping firmly in Middlesex‚Äôs favour as Robson bowled Calvin Harrison in the 40th, giving Robson career-best figures with the ball as a bonus. But Montgomery played the spinners well and Hutton brought a calm authority to proceedings, the pair adding 45 for the seventh wicket. There was still for one more scare as Hutton, with just five needed, swiped at Robson to be caught behind. But Ball kept his nerve to get the job done, punching the air as his sweep off Robson beat the infield, achieving a fourth win of the season and a sixth-place finish for Nottinghamshire, who were promoted with Middlesex as Division Two champions last year. At the start of the day, with just one slip in place as Ball bowled the opening delivery with a ball just three overs old, it was clear that Nottinghamshire were happy to let Middlesex progress at their own pace towards the declaration they had in mind. Quite soon there were no slips and ultimately nine Nottinghamshire players stationed by the boundary rope. The wonder was that Middlesex managed to lose five wickets in taking their total to 177 in the 29 overs up to lunch, although Stevie Eskinazi‚Äôs freakish demise capped an unfortunate match for the South African-born player. His firm drive towards mid-on hit Robson on the foot at the non-striker‚Äôs end and rolled gently towards Mullaney, the bowler, who picked up the ball and lobbed it to wicketkeeper Tom Moores with Eskinazi, who had copped one on the helmet on day one, hopelessly stranded. Either side of this moment of comedy - dark comedy from a Middlesex point of view - Mark Stoneman picked out Lyndon James at deep mid-wicket and Max Holden fell to an excellent catch by Ball at third man as Hutton extended his wickets tally for the season to 62. Dane Paterson raised his own total to 50 - for the third consecutive season - by having Ryan Higgins caught behind off a thin edge and Mullaney removed Simpson via a much thicker edge, a steepler that Moores had to run to backward point to take. A 47-ball 49 by De Caires either side of lunch helped things along, with the young off-spinner lofting Ball into the Fox Road stand beyond square leg before he was caught at deep extra flinging the bat. It gave Ball his final wicket as a Nottinghamshire player - and the first from the Stuart Broad End, as the pavilion end here will henceforth be known following a lunchtime announcement in the presence of the retired England pace bowler. Moments later, Robson completed his third hundred of the season, Middlesex declared, mindful mostly of how many overs their bowlers might need to have any chance of taking 10 wickets, and Ball led his team-mates off the field for the last time. Another county will surely find room for him next season. Roland-Jones said: ‚ÄúWe knew coming into this game that we had to try to force a result and coming into today we had a pretty clear picture. We asked the guys to give it everything and to truly believe that every result was possible and I think that showed on the pitch in the way we have hung in when they were one down for 100-odd, knowing that once we got one we could start to make things tricky for them on a turning pitch. ‚ÄúWe took it right down to the wire but it just wasn‚Äôt to be unfortunately. But I‚Äôm definitely proud of the guys today, but we will look back over the season and say that on other occasions in close games where we have been outwrestled and not able to compete as we have done over the four days here. ‚ÄúThe frustration is that on a wearing wicket on the last day we were in a good position, but I think fundamentally as a group over the course of a 14-game season we have not found our true form and found ourselves in a situation with which you can‚Äôt really argue.‚Äù Head coach Richard Johnson added: ‚ÄúWe had a figure in mind that we were comfortable defending and that would leave ourselves enough time to get 10 wickets. That worked out perfectly, I felt Sam Robson anchored the innings beautifully while everyone played around him and that set up the game for our bowlers to put them as much under pressure as they could. ‚ÄúWhen we had them seven down I felt there was a real opportunity but their guys dug in well at the end. We've talked all year about how much harder playing cricket is in the First Division compared with the Second Division. We couldn‚Äôt cope with that at the start and it has taken up until these last three or four games to start to perform and put our best foot forward. ‚ÄúIt has come too late but what it means is that we can start next season with positivity about how we approach our cricket. We know we can play First Division cricket but we have to build a team now that not only can we compete in Second Division cricket but when we come back up we can compete and push these boys. ‚ÄúIn First Division cricket you have to be switched on from the start and our total of just two batting points all season before this game shows clearly where we have let ourselves down. ‚ÄúWe are gutted and disappointed with the way we have been relegated this year. We know we are a better side than that but we have to show it consistently week in, week out.‚Äù *copy from Jon Culley/Reporters Network","pubDate":"2023-09-29 18:03:55","image_url":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/resources/images/17282079/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"time_series","source_priority":668753,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"feef8bfbc073617213d3f96300e25060","title":"Al-Attiyah's multi-sport genius is of a rare kind","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/alattiyahs-multi-sport-genius-is-of-a-rare-kind-101696009190784.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 52-year-old is a five-time Dakar Rally champion and has been making his mark in shooting as well","content":"In January, Nasser Al-Attiyah was flying through the hills and dunes that dot the landscape of Saudi Arabia, driving his Toyota Hilux to pick up a fifth title at the dangerous yet celebrated Dakar Rally. Al-Attiyah picked up shooting hoping it would help him focus better in rallying.(PTI) Nine months later, with a shotgun perched on his shoulder, the Qatari was shooting clay targets at the Fuyang Yinhu Sports Centre in Hangzhou to help his country win two medals ‚Äì a team silver and an individual bronze ‚Äì in skeet shooting at the Asian Games. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The two medals account for half of Qatar‚Äôs tally in Hangzhou, clinched by someone who is 52 and doesn‚Äôt shoot all-year round. In fact, Al-Attiyah picked up shooting hoping it would help him focus better in rallying. But the 52-year-old became such a pro at it that he clinched gold medals at the 2001, 2006 and 2012 Asian Shooting Championships and 2002 and 2010 Asian Games before also claiming a bronze at the 2012 London Olympics. ‚ÄúWhen I am competing in rally driving, no skeet training. Nothing, zero training. I didn't do training for the (Asian) Games. I used my experience and this is why I have two medals here at the Asian Games,‚Äù Al-Attiyah was quoted as saying by AFP. The Qatari‚Äôs feat is nothing short of remarkable given the demands of modern sport and the toll it takes on athletes today. Gone are the days of CB Fry, who played for England at cricket and football, and equalled the world record for the long jump or American athlete Jim Thorpe (he won two gold medals in the 1912 Summer Olympics, one in classic pentathlon and the other in decathlon. He also played American football (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball) or ‚ÄòBullet‚Äô Bob Hayes, who excelled as a sprinter winning the 100m and 4x100m gold at the 1964 Olympics and then made a mark in the National Football League. The great Carl Lewis was a champion sprinter and long jumper as well. But it is increasingly becoming very difficult in this day and age to shift one‚Äôs focus outside his or her discipline. With competitions throughout the year ‚Äì there is no off season now across sport ‚Äì athletes have to train through the year, participate in multiple competitions to qualify for the bigger ones and most importantly have to manage their training and schedule so that they peak during the major tournaments. There have been some names who have played at the highest level in two different sports. Take Ashleigh Barty for example. The Australian played three disciplines in tennis, reached finals of Grand Slams then decided to switch to cricket for a couple of years where she played 50 over as well as T20 cricket at the highest domestic level before returning to tennis again to win three singles Grand Slam crowns, one doubles Major and an Olympic medal! The great Michael Jordan too surprised the world when he retired in 1993. Having ‚Äúlost the desire to play basketball‚Äù, Jordan made a move to his childhood love of baseball only to realise that succeeding in basketball was different than winning in baseball. He eventually made a return to the sport that gave him name, fame and money. There have been others too like Ric Charlesworth, who played cricket and hockey simultaneously. But athletes playing more than one sport is increasingly becoming a rarity which is why we will unlikely get to see more of the likes of Al-Attiyah, who not just compete in sports that are at the opposite ends of the spectrum but also excel in it. Al-Attiyah's achievement is nothing short of incredible. To win at the Dakar Rally, competing against the very best rally raid drivers in the world like Sebastien Loeb or Carlos Sainz Senior to win medals in shooting at not just the Asian but also global level (Olympics) requires a special kind of perseverance. Al-Attiyah did not stop at two sports either. He also tried his hand at horse riding and also competed in powerboat racing, finishing second at the 2013 Superboat World Championships in Key West, Florida. The 52-year-old won a team skeet gold at the 2002 Busan Asian Games and returned to the continental showpiece eight years later to bag another gold in the same event before also taking home a bronze in the individual event in Guangzhou. He returned to the podium twice at Hangzhou with a men's skeet team silver and skeet individual bronze without even touching the shotgun before reaching China as he was busy rallying. Now, the five-time Dakar champion is targetting the 2024 Paris Games, having competed in all Olympics from 1996 to 2016 before missing Tokyo. He doesn't intend to take part in the regular International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) competitions and will only take part in the Olympic qualifiers. \"I am not in the ISSF competitions at the moment because I am also a professional rally driver. I am so busy. The next (Olympic qualification) competition will be in (South) Korea (in October). There are two quota places. I hope to take one to be in Paris,‚Äù he said. Al-Attiyah said that rallying and shooting may be completely different sports but some of the skills needed applied to both. ‚ÄúStrength, mind strength,\" he said. ‚ÄúRallying is very difficult. We are competing at a high level in rallying. It is not easy to rally and shoot at a high level, but every sport helps.\" Indeed, every sport helps. \"Exciting news!

Barring the openers, Pakistan batters including Mohammad Rizwan (103 retired hurt off 91), Babar Azam (80 off 84) and Saud Shaukeel (75 off 53) had a good hit in the middle, helping their team post a daunting 345 for five in 50 overs. New Zealand cruised to the target in 43.4 overs with contributions from Ravindra (97 off 72), Williamson (54 off 50), Daryl Mitchell (59 retired hurt off 57) and Mark Chapman (65 not out off 41). Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Other Australian Cricketers Have Fun Time in Kerala Ahead of ICC World Cup 2023 Warm-Up Game Against Netherlands (Watch Video) . While Pakistan had all 15 squad members to choose from in the first of their two practice games before the tournament proper, New Zealand had the option of trying out 14 players with Tim Southee yet to arrive in India as he continues to recover from a thumb injury. Ravindra, batting at the top in place of Will Young, gave the team management another opening option alongside Devon Conway, who lasted only one ball in the steep run chase. With the focus firmly on managing players' workload ahead of the main competition, Williamson walked back into the dressing room after scoring a sublime half-century. Williamson, who continues his knee rehabilitation from the injury he suffered in the IPL in March, only came out to bat on Friday and will not be part of the World Cup opener against England on October 5. However, considering the way he batted against the Pakistan attack, it certainly seemed he was ready on the batting front if not the other areas of the game. A couple of backfoot punches in the cover region off a seriously quick Haris Rauf showed that Williamson was very much close to his best.Ravindra at the other end pretty much dealt in boundaries with his first 24 runs coming off only fours. His entertaining innings comprised 16 fours and a six. Number four Mitchell put New Zealand on the cusp of a comfortable win before retiring. Chapman and Jimmy Neesham then bullied an ordinary-looking Pakistan attack to pick up a confidence-boosting win for New Zealand.While the majority of the Pakistan batters would be pleased with their efforts, the bowlers have plenty to worry about. Star pacer Shaheen Afridi did not bowl in the game, allowing Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali to audition for the new ball in the absence of injured Naseem Shah.Rauf bowled only a four-over spell and leaked 36 runs without a wicket. Hasan Ali, who is back in the Pakistan set-up after nine months, was decent in his opening spell before going for runs in the later stages of the New Zealand innings. Leggie Shadab Khan did not bowl and Usama Mir (2/68 in 10) took a couple of wickets in his absence. Part-time spinner Salman Agha (1/60 in 8) was easy meat for the opposition and so was left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz (0/55 in 7). Mohammad Wasim Jr (1/58 in 7) too proved expensive on a tough day for the bowlers.

After Pakistan opted to bat, Babar played his trademark drives on the off-side and ended with eight fours and two sixes.

The Chinese fans, rattled by some exemplary shooting from Swapnil Suresh Kusale, roared for him to flounder. His eight years of international experience and countless routines behind him, Kusale stood ramrod straight under the spotlight. Fifty metres away waited the perfect tease ‚Äì the concentric rings that define his sport and the innermost dot that shooters work so hard to hit. The 21-year-old has medalled in each of his four competitions in Hangzhou.(PTI) Kusale didn‚Äôt need a 10.9. Moments ago, he had shot a jaw-dropping prone series that had pushed him to the gold medal position. No Indian had ever been there. Gagan Narang, an Asiad bronze medallist in 50m 3P, sat among the VIPs, his camera ready to capture the moment. Kusale had no business to fail, and yet when he pulled the trigger, a gasp of disbelief escaped from those present. The electronic scoreboard read 7.6. You rub your eyes and look again. It‚Äôs still 7.6. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Those in the Indian camp sank into their seats. Hands on head, eyes wide, mouth agape. They might as well have seen a ghost. Kusale stood motionless in Lane 2, but you could sense his heart break. The ignominy of a 7, the pain of squandering the chance of making history, the curse of the big final; you know he felt because, sitting in the arena, you felt it too. And then, the roar. A group of Chinese, delirious now, turn towards the Indians ‚Äì this correspondent included ‚Äì and burst out laughing. The mocking is so evident but you are dazed to look away. In one shot, Kusale had gone from gold medal position to fifth. Only two Indians had climbed the podium in 50m three positions at the Asiad before, none had won gold. On the verge of history, Kusale had combusted. He looks at his weapon for a moment that seems to last an eternity. He begins to pick the pieces of his equipment, and one would assume the shattered heart. He trudges back to the Indian corner, which slowly rises to applaud. That‚Äôs that then for him. Kusale had ended the kneeling segment of the competition (first 15 shots) at third, ending it fourth. The scoreboard shows a drop of one spot, but in less than an hour and between going from third to first to fourth, he has lived the microcosm of an athlete's life. The pulsating high of the three flawless prone series where his lowest hit was a 10 and the highest a 10.9 to the ripping low that saw him shoot a score that would put amateurs to shame. ‚ÄúWell, this is 3P. It is brutal,‚Äù Narang would say. ‚ÄúI have seen Olympic champions do much worse. It is a brutal discipline.‚Äù Kusale doesn't break down, at least not in public. From behind the shooting lane, his eyes are fixed on the scoreboard. Two lanes to his right, Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar is meeting an opposite fate. Having struggled in the kneeling and prone positions, he begins the standing round ‚Äì his favourite ‚Äì in fifth place. He claws his way back to third, drops to fifth, and rises to second as the pecking order changes with each shot. With Kusale out, the onus is on Tomar to deliver a medal, and the youngster has suddenly found his groove. He goes 10.6, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.3 in the elimination series to prevent a Chinese 1-2. Linshu Du is a bridge too far, but Jiaming Tian is pushed to third. Tomar needs a 10.7 to win, he manages a 9.7 instead. ‚ÄúI was thinking of shooting a perfect shot. But it didn‚Äôt go that way,‚Äù he would say. The silver though means the 21-year-old has medalled in each of his four competitions in Hangzhou. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling extremely good. We have been practicing very hard for this competition. Winning a medal means achieving my goals, and I‚Äôm very happy,‚Äù he said. Earlier, the men‚Äôs 3P team of Kusale, Tomar and Akhil Sheoran shot gold with a world record score of 1769. Tomar and Kusale led the charge with 591 points each followed by Sheoran, who shot 587. China‚Äôs Linshu Du, Hao Yu and Jiaming Tian were next with 1763 followed by South Korea‚Äôs Kim Sangdo, Kim Jong-hyun and Mo Dai-seong, who aggregated 1748. \"Exciting news!

There had looked to be only one outcome as Nottinghamshire, having been set a target of 207 in a generous 58 overs by Middlesex skipper Toby Roland-Jones, progressed to 64 without loss and then 106 for one. Thank you for your outstanding support this season ü§ù We'll see you back in Division One next year üëä ‚Äî Kent Cricket (@KentCricket) But on a dry, turning pitch on a sunny afternoon, spinners Jayant Yadav, Josh De Caires and Sam Robson ‚Äì who finished with a career-best four for 46 with his leg spin ‚Äì reduced the home side to 157 for seven and suddenly a great escape looked on. However, Matt Montgomery (34 not out) held the tail together to drag Nottinghamshire across the line at eight down, with 16 balls to spare, and left Kent celebrating survival despite being frustrated by dogged Lancashire resistance. Third-placed Hampshire became just the second team to beat Surrey across their back-to-back title-winning campaigns. Only Lancashire had beaten Surrey in 2022 and 2023 in red-ball cricket, winning once in either campaign. But Liam Dawson took his season tally to 49 wickets by claiming two of the four scalps needed to secure victory at the Ageas Bowl, with Surrey only scoring 20 of the 73 required to lose by 52 runs before 11am. Despite the defeat, Surrey were presented with the Division One trophy by England and Wales Cricket Board chair Richard Thompson. Warwickshire and Somerset‚Äôs rain-hit clash ended in an expected draw. The Division One contest was officially abandoned just after lunch on the final day when, with the sun shining, the umpires ruled that areas of the field remained unsafe. Somerset had been 90 for two in the second innings, a lead of 32. The result saw Warwickshire end the campaign in fourth with Somerset seventh. In Division Two, Shan Masood‚Äôs brilliant 123 helped Yorkshire chase down a final-day target of 360 to beat promoted Worcestershire at Headingley and avoid finishing bottom for only the second time in their history. Yorkshire‚Äôs fourth-highest successful run chase was achieved with relative comfort in the end, with six wickets in hand and three overs of the allotted 70 remaining. And that‚Äôs a wrap! Thank you to all our incredible members and supporters for every bit of support this season ü´∂ It means the world üíô ‚Äî Yorkshire CCC (@YorkshireCCC) With the game meandering ahead of day four, both sides opted to contrive a finish, with Yorkshire risking the draw which would lift them off the bottom of Division Two. As it was, they were able to achieve that by going for broke as captain Masood hit 15 fours in 131 balls. Sussex took just 45 minutes to complete a 339-run victory that condemned Gloucestershire to a winless season and bottom spot. The hosts took only 9.5 overs to achieve a third victory of the campaign after Gloucestershire resumed on 113 for five, needing another 400 runs. Durham sealed an emphatic victory over Leicestershire by an innings and 141 runs to end their title-winning campaign on a high. The home side required 10 wickets to secure their seventh victory of the campaign at Seat Unique Riverside and took only 42.5 overs to tear through the Leicestershire batting line-up. The Durham bowlers shared the wickets around as Vishwa Fernando and Matt Parkinson claimed three apiece, while Matthew Potts, Ben Raine and Jonathan Bushnell also struck. The hosts took 24 points from the contest, ending the term with a mammoth total of 233.

stay in Division One of the LV= Insurance County Championship is over, although they at least went down with a fight on a dramatic final day at Trent Bridge.","content":"In a match they ultimately had to win following Kent‚Äôs draw against Lancashire to avoid joining Northamptonshire in Division Two next season, there had looked to be only one outcome as skipper Toby Roland-Jones set Nottingham a target of just 207 in a generous 58 overs. But on a dry, turning pitch on a beautifully sunny last afternoon, spinners Jayant Yadav, Josh De Caires and Sam Robson - who finished with a career-best 4-46 with his leg spin - gave the home side a real scare before Matt Montgomery (34 not out) held the tail together to drag Nottinghamshire across the line at eight down, with 16 balls to spare. Fittingly, it was number 10 Jake Ball - in his final appearance for Nottinghamshire - who swept Robson for the winning boundary. Earlier, as Nottinghamshire set fields that allowed Middlesex to set the game up, Robson hit an 109-ball unbeaten 105 that contained only three fours, and De Caires 49 from 47 as the two shared an 83-run sixth-wicket partnership before the declaration came, with Roland-Jones needing to take a gamble if his bowlers were to have any chance of taking 10 wickets on a pitch that, while taking spin, was still essentially a good surface for batting. Hutton‚Äôs 2-38 had confirmed him as the season‚Äôs leading wicket-taker across both divisions on 62 and as Ben Slater added a 49 to his first-innings 140 Nottinghamshire looked to be cruising on 133-2. There had been only sporadic glimmers of hope for Middlesex. Haseeb Hameed, without a hundred this year after four in 2022, pulled Tom Helm straight to square leg in the 16th over. Ten overs later, John Simpson executed a sharp stumping to enable De Caires to end Steven Mullaney‚Äôs progress at 30 from 34 balls. But then wickets came in consecutive overs twice as the turning ball suddenly became a potent weapon. Joe Clarke was bowled by off-spinner Yadav for 22 in the 31st, before Slater was leg before to Robson in the 32nd. Tom Moores was caught at deep midwicket on the slog-sweep off Robson in the 36th and Lyndon James leg before on the back foot to Yadav in the 37th, leaving Nottinghamshire 152-6, still 55 short of the target. And the odds looked to be tipping firmly in Middlesex‚Äôs favour as Robson bowled Calvin Harrison in the 40th, giving Robson career-best figures with the ball as a bonus. But Montgomery played the spinners well and Hutton brought a calm authority to proceedings, the pair adding 45 for the seventh wicket. There was still for one more scare as Hutton, with just five needed, swiped at Robson to be caught behind. But Ball kept his nerve to get the job done, punching the air as his sweep off Robson beat the infield, achieving a fourth win of the season and a sixth-place finish for Nottinghamshire, who were promoted with Middlesex as Division Two champions last year. At the start of the day, with just one slip in place as Ball bowled the opening delivery with a ball just three overs old, it was clear that Nottinghamshire were happy to let Middlesex progress at their own pace towards the declaration they had in mind. Quite soon there were no slips and ultimately nine Nottinghamshire players stationed by the boundary rope. The wonder was that Middlesex managed to lose five wickets in taking their total to 177 in the 29 overs up to lunch, although Stevie Eskinazi‚Äôs freakish demise capped an unfortunate match for the South African-born player. His firm drive towards mid-on hit Robson on the foot at the non-striker‚Äôs end and rolled gently towards Mullaney, the bowler, who picked up the ball and lobbed it to wicketkeeper Tom Moores with Eskinazi, who had copped one on the helmet on day one, hopelessly stranded. Either side of this moment of comedy - dark comedy from a Middlesex point of view - Mark Stoneman picked out Lyndon James at deep mid-wicket and Max Holden fell to an excellent catch by Ball at third man as Hutton extended his wickets tally for the season to 62. Dane Paterson raised his own total to 50 - for the third consecutive season - by having Ryan Higgins caught behind off a thin edge and Mullaney removed Simpson via a much thicker edge, a steepler that Moores had to run to backward point to take. A 47-ball 49 by De Caires either side of lunch helped things along, with the young off-spinner lofting Ball into the Fox Road stand beyond square leg before he was caught at deep extra flinging the bat. It gave Ball his final wicket as a Nottinghamshire player - and the first from the Stuart Broad End, as the pavilion end here will henceforth be known following a lunchtime announcement in the presence of the retired England pace bowler. Moments later, Robson completed his third hundred of the season, Middlesex declared, mindful mostly of how many overs their bowlers might need to have any chance of taking 10 wickets, and Ball led his team-mates off the field for the last time. Another county will surely find room for him next season. Roland-Jones said: ‚ÄúWe knew coming into this game that we had to try to force a result and coming into today we had a pretty clear picture. We asked the guys to give it everything and to truly believe that every result was possible and I think that showed on the pitch in the way we have hung in when they were one down for 100-odd, knowing that once we got one we could start to make things tricky for them on a turning pitch. ‚ÄúWe took it right down to the wire but it just wasn‚Äôt to be unfortunately. But I‚Äôm definitely proud of the guys today, but we will look back over the season and say that on other occasions in close games where we have been outwrestled and not able to compete as we have done over the four days here. ‚ÄúThe frustration is that on a wearing wicket on the last day we were in a good position, but I think fundamentally as a group over the course of a 14-game season we have not found our true form and found ourselves in a situation with which you can‚Äôt really argue.‚Äù Head coach Richard Johnson added: ‚ÄúWe had a figure in mind that we were comfortable defending and that would leave ourselves enough time to get 10 wickets. That worked out perfectly, I felt Sam Robson anchored the innings beautifully while everyone played around him and that set up the game for our bowlers to put them as much under pressure as they could. ‚ÄúWhen we had them seven down I felt there was a real opportunity but their guys dug in well at the end. We've talked all year about how much harder playing cricket is in the First Division compared with the Second Division. We couldn‚Äôt cope with that at the start and it has taken up until these last three or four games to start to perform and put our best foot forward. ‚ÄúIt has come too late but what it means is that we can start next season with positivity about how we approach our cricket. We know we can play First Division cricket but we have to build a team now that not only can we compete in Second Division cricket but when we come back up we can compete and push these boys. ‚ÄúIn First Division cricket you have to be switched on from the start and our total of just two batting points all season before this game shows clearly where we have let ourselves down. ‚ÄúWe are gutted and disappointed with the way we have been relegated this year. We know we are a better side than that but we have to show it consistently week in, week out.‚Äù *copy from Jon Culley/Reporters Network","pubDate":"2023-09-29 18:03:55","image_url":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/resources/images/17282079/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"time_series","source_priority":668753,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"feef8bfbc073617213d3f96300e25060","title":"Al-Attiyah's multi-sport genius is of a rare kind","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/alattiyahs-multi-sport-genius-is-of-a-rare-kind-101696009190784.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 52-year-old is a five-time Dakar Rally champion and has been making his mark in shooting as well","content":"In January, Nasser Al-Attiyah was flying through the hills and dunes that dot the landscape of Saudi Arabia, driving his Toyota Hilux to pick up a fifth title at the dangerous yet celebrated Dakar Rally. Al-Attiyah picked up shooting hoping it would help him focus better in rallying.(PTI) Nine months later, with a shotgun perched on his shoulder, the Qatari was shooting clay targets at the Fuyang Yinhu Sports Centre in Hangzhou to help his country win two medals ‚Äì a team silver and an individual bronze ‚Äì in skeet shooting at the Asian Games. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The two medals account for half of Qatar‚Äôs tally in Hangzhou, clinched by someone who is 52 and doesn‚Äôt shoot all-year round. In fact, Al-Attiyah picked up shooting hoping it would help him focus better in rallying. But the 52-year-old became such a pro at it that he clinched gold medals at the 2001, 2006 and 2012 Asian Shooting Championships and 2002 and 2010 Asian Games before also claiming a bronze at the 2012 London Olympics. ‚ÄúWhen I am competing in rally driving, no skeet training. Nothing, zero training. I didn't do training for the (Asian) Games. I used my experience and this is why I have two medals here at the Asian Games,‚Äù Al-Attiyah was quoted as saying by AFP. The Qatari‚Äôs feat is nothing short of remarkable given the demands of modern sport and the toll it takes on athletes today. Gone are the days of CB Fry, who played for England at cricket and football, and equalled the world record for the long jump or American athlete Jim Thorpe (he won two gold medals in the 1912 Summer Olympics, one in classic pentathlon and the other in decathlon. He also played American football (collegiate and professional), professional baseball, and basketball) or ‚ÄòBullet‚Äô Bob Hayes, who excelled as a sprinter winning the 100m and 4x100m gold at the 1964 Olympics and then made a mark in the National Football League. The great Carl Lewis was a champion sprinter and long jumper as well. But it is increasingly becoming very difficult in this day and age to shift one‚Äôs focus outside his or her discipline. With competitions throughout the year ‚Äì there is no off season now across sport ‚Äì athletes have to train through the year, participate in multiple competitions to qualify for the bigger ones and most importantly have to manage their training and schedule so that they peak during the major tournaments. There have been some names who have played at the highest level in two different sports. Take Ashleigh Barty for example. The Australian played three disciplines in tennis, reached finals of Grand Slams then decided to switch to cricket for a couple of years where she played 50 over as well as T20 cricket at the highest domestic level before returning to tennis again to win three singles Grand Slam crowns, one doubles Major and an Olympic medal! The great Michael Jordan too surprised the world when he retired in 1993. Having ‚Äúlost the desire to play basketball‚Äù, Jordan made a move to his childhood love of baseball only to realise that succeeding in basketball was different than winning in baseball. He eventually made a return to the sport that gave him name, fame and money. There have been others too like Ric Charlesworth, who played cricket and hockey simultaneously. But athletes playing more than one sport is increasingly becoming a rarity which is why we will unlikely get to see more of the likes of Al-Attiyah, who not just compete in sports that are at the opposite ends of the spectrum but also excel in it. Al-Attiyah's achievement is nothing short of incredible. To win at the Dakar Rally, competing against the very best rally raid drivers in the world like Sebastien Loeb or Carlos Sainz Senior to win medals in shooting at not just the Asian but also global level (Olympics) requires a special kind of perseverance. Al-Attiyah did not stop at two sports either. He also tried his hand at horse riding and also competed in powerboat racing, finishing second at the 2013 Superboat World Championships in Key West, Florida. The 52-year-old won a team skeet gold at the 2002 Busan Asian Games and returned to the continental showpiece eight years later to bag another gold in the same event before also taking home a bronze in the individual event in Guangzhou. He returned to the podium twice at Hangzhou with a men's skeet team silver and skeet individual bronze without even touching the shotgun before reaching China as he was busy rallying. Now, the five-time Dakar champion is targetting the 2024 Paris Games, having competed in all Olympics from 1996 to 2016 before missing Tokyo. He doesn't intend to take part in the regular International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) competitions and will only take part in the Olympic qualifiers. \"I am not in the ISSF competitions at the moment because I am also a professional rally driver. I am so busy. The next (Olympic qualification) competition will be in (South) Korea (in October). There are two quota places. I hope to take one to be in Paris,‚Äù he said. Al-Attiyah said that rallying and shooting may be completely different sports but some of the skills needed applied to both. ‚ÄúStrength, mind strength,\" he said. ‚ÄúRallying is very difficult. We are competing at a high level in rallying. It is not easy to rally and shoot at a high level, but every sport helps.\" Indeed, every sport helps. \"Exciting news!

Barring the openers, Pakistan batters including Mohammad Rizwan (103 retired hurt off 91), Babar Azam (80 off 84) and Saud Shaukeel (75 off 53) had a good hit in the middle, helping their team post a daunting 345 for five in 50 overs. New Zealand cruised to the target in 43.4 overs with contributions from Ravindra (97 off 72), Williamson (54 off 50), Daryl Mitchell (59 retired hurt off 57) and Mark Chapman (65 not out off 41).

While Pakistan had all 15 squad members to choose from in the first of their two practice games before the tournament proper, New Zealand had the option of trying out 14 players with Tim Southee yet to arrive in India as he continues to recover from a thumb injury. Ravindra, batting at the top in place of Will Young, gave the team management another opening option alongside Devon Conway, who lasted only one ball in the steep run chase. With the focus firmly on managing players' workload ahead of the main competition, Williamson walked back into the dressing room after scoring a sublime half-century. Williamson, who continues his knee rehabilitation from the injury he suffered in the IPL in March, only came out to bat on Friday and will not be part of the World Cup opener against England on October 5. However, considering the way he batted against the Pakistan attack, it certainly seemed he was ready on the batting front if not the other areas of the game. A couple of backfoot punches in the cover region off a seriously quick Haris Rauf showed that Williamson was very much close to his best.Ravindra at the other end pretty much dealt in boundaries with his first 24 runs coming off only fours. His entertaining innings comprised 16 fours and a six. Number four Mitchell put New Zealand on the cusp of a comfortable win before retiring. Chapman and Jimmy Neesham then bullied an ordinary-looking Pakistan attack to pick up a confidence-boosting win for New Zealand.While the majority of the Pakistan batters would be pleased with their efforts, the bowlers have plenty to worry about. Star pacer Shaheen Afridi did not bowl in the game, allowing Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali to audition for the new ball in the absence of injured Naseem Shah.Rauf bowled only a four-over spell and leaked 36 runs without a wicket. Hasan Ali, who is back in the Pakistan set-up after nine months, was decent in his opening spell before going for runs in the later stages of the New Zealand innings. Leggie Shadab Khan did not bowl and Usama Mir (2/68 in 10) took a couple of wickets in his absence. Part-time spinner Salman Agha (1/60 in 8) was easy meat for the opposition and so was left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz (0/55 in 7). Mohammad Wasim Jr (1/58 in 7) too proved expensive on a tough day for the bowlers.

After Pakistan opted to bat, Babar played his trademark drives on the off-side and ended with eight fours and two sixes.

The Chinese fans, rattled by some exemplary shooting from Swapnil Suresh Kusale, roared for him to flounder. His eight years of international experience and countless routines behind him, Kusale stood ramrod straight under the spotlight. Fifty metres away waited the perfect tease ‚Äì the concentric rings that define his sport and the innermost dot that shooters work so hard to hit. The 21-year-old has medalled in each of his four competitions in Hangzhou.(PTI) Kusale didn‚Äôt need a 10.9. Moments ago, he had shot a jaw-dropping prone series that had pushed him to the gold medal position. No Indian had ever been there. Gagan Narang, an Asiad bronze medallist in 50m 3P, sat among the VIPs, his camera ready to capture the moment. Kusale had no business to fail, and yet when he pulled the trigger, a gasp of disbelief escaped from those present. The electronic scoreboard read 7.6. You rub your eyes and look again. It‚Äôs still 7.6. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Those in the Indian camp sank into their seats. Hands on head, eyes wide, mouth agape. They might as well have seen a ghost. Kusale stood motionless in Lane 2, but you could sense his heart break. The ignominy of a 7, the pain of squandering the chance of making history, the curse of the big final; you know he felt because, sitting in the arena, you felt it too. And then, the roar. A group of Chinese, delirious now, turn towards the Indians ‚Äì this correspondent included ‚Äì and burst out laughing. The mocking is so evident but you are dazed to look away. In one shot, Kusale had gone from gold medal position to fifth. Only two Indians had climbed the podium in 50m three positions at the Asiad before, none had won gold. On the verge of history, Kusale had combusted. He looks at his weapon for a moment that seems to last an eternity. He begins to pick the pieces of his equipment, and one would assume the shattered heart. He trudges back to the Indian corner, which slowly rises to applaud. That‚Äôs that then for him. Kusale had ended the kneeling segment of the competition (first 15 shots) at third, ending it fourth. The scoreboard shows a drop of one spot, but in less than an hour and between going from third to first to fourth, he has lived the microcosm of an athlete's life. The pulsating high of the three flawless prone series where his lowest hit was a 10 and the highest a 10.9 to the ripping low that saw him shoot a score that would put amateurs to shame. ‚ÄúWell, this is 3P. It is brutal,‚Äù Narang would say. ‚ÄúI have seen Olympic champions do much worse. It is a brutal discipline.‚Äù Kusale doesn't break down, at least not in public. From behind the shooting lane, his eyes are fixed on the scoreboard. Two lanes to his right, Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar is meeting an opposite fate. Having struggled in the kneeling and prone positions, he begins the standing round ‚Äì his favourite ‚Äì in fifth place. He claws his way back to third, drops to fifth, and rises to second as the pecking order changes with each shot. With Kusale out, the onus is on Tomar to deliver a medal, and the youngster has suddenly found his groove. He goes 10.6, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.3 in the elimination series to prevent a Chinese 1-2. Linshu Du is a bridge too far, but Jiaming Tian is pushed to third. Tomar needs a 10.7 to win, he manages a 9.7 instead. ‚ÄúI was thinking of shooting a perfect shot. But it didn‚Äôt go that way,‚Äù he would say. The silver though means the 21-year-old has medalled in each of his four competitions in Hangzhou. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling extremely good. We have been practicing very hard for this competition. Winning a medal means achieving my goals, and I‚Äôm very happy,‚Äù he said. Earlier, the men‚Äôs 3P team of Kusale, Tomar and Akhil Sheoran shot gold with a world record score of 1769. Tomar and Kusale led the charge with 591 points each followed by Sheoran, who shot 587. China‚Äôs Linshu Du, Hao Yu and Jiaming Tian were next with 1763 followed by South Korea‚Äôs Kim Sangdo, Kim Jong-hyun and Mo Dai-seong, who aggregated 1748. \"Exciting news!
