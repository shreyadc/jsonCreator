Read full story","content":"(Reuters) - New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been named in his first white ball squad since the T20 World Cup as the Black Caps ramp up their preparations for the global tournament with their first tour of the Caribbean in eight years. Williamson, who played his last T20 match in the defeat by Australia in the World Cup final last November, will captain identical T20 and one-day squads to play the West Indies in six white ball matches starting in Jamaica on Aug. 10. Williamson will be joined by pace veterans Trent Boult and Tim Southee, and batsman Devon Conway, all of whom were rested following the team's 3-0 whitewash by England in the test series in June. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always exciting to be heading somewhere you‚Äôve not been in a while and I know this group can‚Äôt wait for the challenge of taking on the West Indies in the Caribbean,\" coach Gary Stead said in a statement on Monday. \"For Kane, Trent, Tim and Devon, this will be the first time they have played white ball cricket for New Zealand since last year‚Äôs T20 World Cup and tour to India - so this trip will be important for them.\" New Zealand wrapped up a 3-0 T20 series defeat of Ireland with a six-wicket win in Belfast last week. A number of players who featured in that series have been omitted for the West Indies tour, including Dane Cleaver, Jacob Duffy and Blair Tickner. Batsmen Finn Allen and Michael Bracewell have broken into New Zealand's best 15 in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup hosted by champions Australia in October-November. Allen made his ODI debut against Ireland this month, while Bracewell made his T20I debut against the Irish last week.

West Indies and India have successfully put on display two back-to-back riveting ODIs in Port of Spain resulting in the visitors winning on both occasions to gain an unassailable 2-0 lead in a three-match series. The recently concluded second ODI required India to chase a 312-run target in order to seal a series win. In what ended up becoming the highest ODI run-chase at the Queen‚Äôs Park Oval, it also is the third-highest in West Indies. Although half-centuries by vice-captain Shreyas Iyer (63) and wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson (54) kept India alive in the chase, them losing half their batting unit right before the third powerplay provided the hosts with a massive advantage. Coming in to bat at No. 7 in the 39th over with more than 100 runs remaining to be scored, all-rounder Axar Patel scored a maiden ODI half-century to win a maiden ODI match award in only his second ODI in the last five years. In what is also his highest individual score in international cricket, Patel scored 64* (35) at a strike rate of 182.85 on the back of hitting three fours and five sixes. Patel playing a pivotal role in scoring a combined total of game-changing 29 runs in the 46th and 47th overs propelled India to chase their 18th run-chase of 300 or more runs in ODIs. An almost early morning finish according to the Indian time has it in it for plentiful Indian fans to have missed out on live action.

Which is why we should stop comparing it with men‚Äôs football. Last week it was being said that if Ellen White nets another two she will go past Wayne Rooney‚Äôs England goal-scoring record of 53. No she won‚Äôt, she will extend her own incredible record in women‚Äôs football. After all if Harry Kane, currently on 50 goals, gets to 55 we wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs beaten Ellen White, so why do it the other way round? Of course, should The Lionesses win the tournament at Wembley on Sunday, there will be the inevitable digs at the men about the females triumphing where they failed last year. And they will deserve all the plaudits that come their way. But for the women‚Äôs game to seriously progress in the years to come it needs to develop in its own space. Hopefully that means this Euros will encourage girls‚Äô football teams in every primary school, rather than the best players being in the boys‚Äô teams. Once that becomes the norm, then women‚Äôs football will really be on the march.","pubDate":"2022-07-24 22:17:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE IND vs WI 2nd ODI Cricket Score and Updates: Axar Leads The Way As India On Verge Of Victory - India.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi6QFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2xpdmUtaW5kLXZzLXdpLTJuZC1vZGktY3JpY2tldC1zY29yZS10cmluaWRhZC1wb3J0LW9mLXNwYWluLW1hdGNoLXVwZGF0ZXMtaW5kaWEtdnMtd2VzdC1pbmRpZXMtbGl2ZS1zdHJlYW0tZGQtZmFuY29kZS1iYWxsLWJ5LWJhbGwtY29tbWVudGFyeS10YXJnZXQtMzEyLWhvb2RhLWF4YXItc2hhcmR1bC1peWVyLXNhbXNvbi1tYXllcnMtaG9wZS01NTMyMjc1L9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE IND vs WI 2nd ODI Cricket Score and Updates: Axar Leads The Way As India On Verge Of Victory¬†¬†India.comIndia vs West Indies 2nd ODI LIVE cricket score and ball by ball commentary: India need 8 from the final over¬†¬†FirstpostIND vs WI 2nd ODI Live Score Updates: Axar stars as India defeat West Indies by 2 wickets, seal series 2-0¬†¬†The Indian Express'A Little Casual': Former India Cricketer Slams Shubman Gill For Throwing Away His Wicket¬†¬†News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-24 22:11:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sanju Samson batting highlights yesterday match: Sanju Samson maiden ODI half-century in Port of Spain ODI","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sanju-samson-batting-highlights-yesterday-match-sanju-samson-maiden-odi-half-century-in-port-of-spain-odi/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of West Indies 2022","Sanju Samson","West Indies"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sanju Samson batting highlights: The Indian wicket-keeper batter scored a maiden ODI half-century at the Queen‚Äôs Park Oval.

During the second ODI of India‚Äôs tour of West Indies 2022 in Port of Spain, India wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson scored a maiden half-century in only his third match. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the 18th over of a 312-run chase, Samson scored 54 (51) with the help of three fours and sixes each before finding himself on the wrong end of a run-out in order to sneak a run which could‚Äôve been avoided. It was on the first delivery that Samson faced that he hit a boundary off West Indies all-rounder Kyle Mayers. A leg-side delivery was provided with an apt treatment by the right-handed batter. With spinner Hayden Walsh beating him outside the off-stump only a handful of deliveries later, Samson cleared his front leg to hit the leg-spinner for a six over long-off on the following delivery. Walsh got hit for a replica of this shot for the same result later in the same spell. Samson‚Äôs third six of the innings came in the 32nd over when he stepped out against spinner Akeal Hosein only to clear the long-off fielder yet again. It was on the second delivery of the 38th over when Samson hit a Jayden Seales full-toss towards the fine-leg region for his third boundary through that area. With India needing close to 10 runs per over right before the third powerplay, the situation was ideal for a well-set Samson to play an archetype match-winning knock but it wasn‚Äôt to be in this particular match.

En Route the stiff target of 312 handed by the Windies, team India were in deep trouble having lost three of their top-order batters by the 18th Over, and with only 79 runs posted on the scoreboard. However, the pair of Shreyas Iyer (63 off 71) and Sanju Samson came to the fore when the team needed the most, stitching a 99-run stand off 94 deliveries for the fourth wicket, to find themselves well and alive in the chase. Iyer, not only brought up his 11th ODI half-century, but now has also scored a total of 7 fifties across 8 innings versus the West Indies, including the one during the first ODI of the series a couple of days ago as well. Samson, on the other hand, soaked in all the pressure as well, while also made sure to go for the big hits every now and then, to keep the required run-rate in check. Samson unfortunately had to head back towards the dressing room due to a run-out at the non-striker‚Äôs end at a very critical juncture of the game, but can can still be proud of his 51-ball 54, which he scored with the assistance of 3 Fours and as many Sixes.

Australia had been left hugely frustrated on Saturday when they were coasting to victory against Pakistan, only to be denied by the rain in Northern Ireland which forced a no result. It was their second match against Pakistan, one of their opponents in the upcoming Games in Birmingham, which had to be abandoned because of the elements. But as they left for England, they weren't to be denied the overall series victory when Pakistan's final match with the hosts also had to be called off even before the toss at Bready because of more rain. Australia, who only completed two games against Ireland and won them both easily, were announced as overall winners in the six-game round-robin event competition. They earned 12 points to Pakistan's 10, with winless Ireland finishing on two points. But it proved a frustrating weekend for both Australia and Pakistan, who'd been hoping to get in some serious work before flying off to England for their Games quest in Birmingham. Australia legspinner Alana King was announced as player of the tournament for her eight wickets in four innings, including a best of 3-8 against Pakistan in the rain-ruined opening encounter.

We will work in partnership with @sportscotland with immediate effect to ensure appropriate governance, leadership & support is in place for sport in the days ahead,‚Äù Cricket Scotland tweeted on Sunday. The review was commissioned last year by Sport Scotland, the national funding body, after Scotland‚Äôs all-time leading wicket-taker Majid Haq told Sky Sports News that Cricket Scotland was ‚Äúinstitutionally racist‚Äù. Haq picked up 60 wickets for Scotland in 54 ODI matches and 28 wickets in 21 T20Is, but was exiled after he tweeted ‚Äúalways tougher when you‚Äôre in the minority! #colour #race‚Äù after not being selected for a 2015 match. Last year, he told Sky Sports ‚ÄúI was treated like a criminal‚Äù in the aftermath of that incident. Haq‚Äôs former teammate Qasim Sheikh said he had also suffered racist abuse.

However, it added the board had been made aware of ‚Äúproposed timescales and certain mandated actions‚Äù recommended by the review. In the view of the outgoing board, plans to both resolve the racism issues quickly and modernise the running of Cricket Scotland were ‚Äúunachievable within the timetable proposed and the current governance framework‚Äù. ‚ÄúConsequently, we believe we must now step aside to enable the required progress to be made in the coming months,‚Äù the statement added. The issue of racism within British cricket as a whole was brought to the fore again two years ago when former spinner Azeem Rafiq said he had been subjected to racial harassment and bullying during his time as a player for leading English county Yorkshire. That prompted the Headingley-based club to commission an investigation into allegations by the 31-year-old Rafiq, who said he was driven to thoughts of suicide by the culture of racism during his time at Yorkshire. Although seven were upheld, Yorkshire concluded last October that no member of staff would face disciplinary action, a decision that prompted uproar among politicians and the wider cricket community. The shocking testimony of former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq to British MPs shook the game. Source: AFP That led to a mass clear-out of administrative and coaching staff at Headingley, with new chairman Kamlesh Patel taking over as the face of a fresh Yorkshire regime. New governance procedures proposed by Patel were voted through by the Yorkshire membership and, as a result, the England and Wales Cricket Board did not go through with a threat to strip Headingley of lucrative international games ‚Äî a potential financial disaster for Yorkshire. Nevertheless, last month the ECB charged Yorkshire and a number of individuals with bringing the sport into disrepute. But former Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale, who in June won an unfair dismissal claim against the club after being sacked last year, has said he will refuse to co-operate with the ECB disciplinary process.","pubDate":"2022-07-24 20:11:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Highest run chase in ODI: Highest ODI run chase in West Indies","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-highest-run-chase-in-odi-highest-odi-run-chase-in-west-indies/","keywords":["Cricket","India tour of West Indies 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Highest run chase in ODI: The Windies put on a commendable show with the bat yet again, to pose a still target before India in 2nd ODI.

He comfortably held on to his own at the front when an incident involving three cars brought out the safety car. FP Sports July 24, 2022 23:53:35 IST File photo of Jehan Daruva Photo by James Gasperotti Le Castellet : Indian racer Jehan Daruvala started the 'feature race' from 10th on the grid but fought his way up to the seventh spot in Formula 2 French Grand Prix on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, Jehan secured his sixth podium of the season, finishing second in the French round of the Formula 2 championship here. It was his fifth second-place finish this season. The 23-year-old, who races for Italian team Prema, was robbed of a potential fourth F2 victory by a post-race penalty in the last round in Austria. \"It's good to be back on the podium what happened in Silverstone and Austria. We were struggling with pace down the straights but had some good battles to finish second,\" Jehan said. \"We would have finished even higher in the feature race with our strategy to run a long first stint but we gambled on a safety car and stayed out a bit longer than ideal. Other than that, it was a solid weekend for us. We still have some areas to work on and I'm confident we'll come back stronger next weekend in Hungary,\" the 23-year-old added. Jehan started Saturday's 'sprint race' from the pole position and after a lightning start led into the first corner. He comfortably held on to his own at the front when an incident involving three cars brought out the safety car. The 23-year-old Mumbai-based driver timed the restart to perfection, that allowed him to open up a small gap with second-placed Liam Lawson but the latter's superior straight-line speed allowed him to close in. Lawson used his car's superior speed down the straights to get past Jehan and the former swept around the outside into turn one. Jehan held his line but the pair touched, which opened up a tear on his front tyre, but he didn't suffer a puncture. A few laps later, Marcus Armstrong attempted to pass Jehan for second at the same corner but on the inside. They made contact but Jehan, forced wide across the chicane, and kept his position. Armstrong was handed a five-second penalty for forcing Jehan off the track. The Red Bull-backed racer, who earlier this week completed a second Formula One test with McLaren, will now go to Hungary.

David, who has played 114 T20s over the years, has been one of the consistent lower-order batsmen, scoring runs for fun across T20 leagues. He has 2,556 runs at an average of 33.19 and a fine strike rate of 164.79 since making his professional debut in 2018. Out of the 114 games, 14 came for Singapore, where he scored 558 runs at an average of 46.50 and strike rate of 158.52. David's last appearance for Singapore came in March 2020 when his country played against Hong Kong in Bangkok. The 26-year-old David, who was bought by Mumbai Indians (MI) at INR 8.25 crore at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 mega auction, has featured in a number of leagues, including Big Bash League (BBL), Caribbean Premier League (CPL), Pakistan Super League (PSL), T20 Blast, and The Hundred. \"If I was a selector, I would love to have someone like that in my team. If he's playing or not, just to have that sort of striking power ability around, he's an out and out match-winner,\" said Ponting in a recent interview. Comparing David with Andrew Symonds, who played a vital role in Australia's 2003 World Cup triumph, Ponting said that the former was a match winner. \"He's the sort of player that could actually win you a World Cup. He's not just the average run-of-the-mill guy that might just sneak into a squad. I mean, he actually reminds me a bit of someone like an Andrew Symonds back in the 2003 World Cup. You know if you get them in and you give him an opportunity they're a chance of winning a tournament for you. That's how I'd be looking at him right now. I know there are some other great world-quality players in the middle order for Australia. But probably none of them boasts the resume as good as Tim's over the last two years,\" added Ponting. David, who did not play all the games for MI in IPL 2022, was quite impressive at the fag end of the tournament but by that time, the five-time champions had already been eliminated. üá∏üá¨ ‚úàÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è üáÆüá≥ üèöÔ∏è Our newest member of the ‡§§‡•ã‡§°‡§´‡•ã‡§° ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§≥, Tim David is home! üí•üíô #OneFamily #MumbaiIndians @timdavid8 MI TV pic.twitter.com/Fo9DygMFgM \"He's been incredible in almost every tournament that he's played around the world, the last 12 or 18 months. He was probably a little bit unlucky not to play more in the IPL this year to be honest, with the way that he started with Mumbai and then didn't come back until right near the end and played some match-winning knocks then.\" \"He's a very, very good, very dangerous T20 player that I'm sure the Australian selectors are thinking long and hard about for the World Cup in a couple of months time,\" Australia's World Cup-winning skipper concluded.

Reece Topley, who has been a revelation for English cricket created some initial trouble for the Proteas batsmen but it was David Willey who dismissed Janneman Malan for a meager 11 off 18 deliveries.

While Dhawan missed the century by just three runs, Gill, returning to the playing XI in ODIs for the first time since December 2020, played with a point to prove, scoring a magnificent 64 off just 53 balls. The 22-year-old Gill showed tremendous class as he smashed the West Indies pacers for boundaries inside the powerplay, racing to 41 off 28 balls in the first 10 overs and bringing up his maiden ODI half-century soon off just 36 balls. At the other end, Dhawan played second fiddle but kept scoring at a healthy rate as the duo brought up their 100-run partnership in just 14 overs. The captain too managed to get to his half-century, his 36th in ODI cricket. With both the batters scoring at a fast clip, it needed something special to break the partnership and Nicholas Pooran came up with a brilliant direct hit to dismiss Gill for 64. West Indies managed to slip in a few quiet overs but the pairing of Shikhar Dhawan and Shreyas Iyer batted with composure to ensure the hosts didn't make any more inroads. Iyer faced a few short-pitched deliveries but tore the spinners apart. Dhawan looked set for his 18th career ODI ton but a superb catch by Shamarh Brooks brought his innings to an end just three runs short of a century. Iyer (54) too fell soon after his fifty. With 14 overs to go, India were in complete control at 231/3 and looked on course to posting a massive total. But the West Indies bowlers fought back brilliantly to keep pegging at the wickets and pushing the visitors back. Deepak Hooda and Axar Patel made decent contributions to take India past 300, finishing at 308/7. Despite losing Shai Hope early in the innings, the West Indies chase was off to a great start thanks to a 117-run second-wicket partnership between Kyle Mayers (75) and Shamarh Brooks (46) who set the platform for their teammates. Brandon King (54) anchored the chase well, bringing up his third ODI fifty while constantly losing partners at the other end. West Indies needed only 120 runs in the last 15 overs with seven wickets. They were looking at a historic run chase but the Indian bowlers had other plans. First Mohammed Siraj dismissed the dangerous Nicholas Pooran (25) and Rovman Powell (6) soon followed his captain back to the pavilion as Yuzvendra Chahal bagged the first of his two wickets. Akeal Hosein (32 not out) and Romario Shepherd (39 not out) put a late blitz bringing their side within 38 runs off the target with the last three overs to go.

But naturally there are challenges, we've seen that over a period of time now. We only had to look at the Test series this summer when there was the one-day squad in Holland at the same time. \"I think even if you look at the back end of this summer as well, there are the seven T20s in Pakistan that pretty much overlap with the last Test match. And it even goes back to the last World Cup where then you fly straight to the Ashes with a week's preparation after quarantining, then straight into the Test match,\" said Bairstow to Sky Sports Cricket. In the home summer for England this year, Bairstow is one of the very rare all-format players. He played in Tests against New Zealand and India, playing a huge hand in victories. He then played ODIs against India and is featuring in 50-over matches against South Africa. Bairstow will play the T20Is against the Proteas and is scheduled to play three matches in The Hundred before Test series against South Africa comes. \"But you know me well enough now: I'll be trying to play all of them for as long as possible. I'll be going all out for as long as I can. There might come a time when you do have to make a decision for different reasons, but that's part and parcel of life and cricket. \"In the near future I can't see me making a choice because I'm loving being part of all three squads. They're all individual squads and they're great to be a part of. It's exciting. You go into a new one and you've got a freshness and new faces and energy around them, because you're going into a new format,\" added Bairstow. Amidst the talk over future of bilateral series, especially of the 50-over cricket at risk, Bairstow insisted he still loves ODIs and warned young players of the danger in committing only to T20 cricket. \"I think it is a really good format. The journey we have been on as a group to get to (winning) the 2019 World Cup was amazing. \"I also think that 50-over cricket is in some ways a stepping stone into Test cricket. You get worked over for longer, you sometimes have to grind out difficult periods and play good cricket shots. The middle overs, especially are a lot like Test cricket. \"There is the lure of playing in T20 leagues and making a quick buck, let's be honest about that. But, everything comes from your basic technique, which you learn in four-day cricket - and then you expand from that.\" Citing the example of premier England batter Joe Root, Bairstow elaborated, \"Look at (Joe) Root, for instance, his technique is fantastic and then he takes that from Test cricket to 50-over cricket, to T20 cricket... and all he does is expand his game.\" IANS Also Read: \"Jonny Bairstow Going Through Hot Streak Batters Get Once or Twice in Their Career\": Michael Vaughan Also Watch:","pubDate":"2022-07-24 16:47:51","image_url":"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2022/07/24/367954-johh.jpg","source_id":"sentinel","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ben Stokes in ODI retirement speech...'Keep pushing yourselves to absolute extremes'","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/ben-stokes-in-odi-retirement-speechkeep-pushing-yourselves-to-absolute-extremes-604211","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"On July 19, all-rounder Ben Stokes retired from ODI cricket after the first match against South Africa at his home ground in Durham.","content":"MANCHESTER: On July 19, all-rounder Ben Stokes retired from ODI cricket after the first match against South Africa at his home ground in Durham. Stokes, who captains England in Test cricket, cited playing three formats in international cricket was \"unsustainable\" in a hectic cricketing schedule. After the match ended in a 62-run defeat, Stokes gave a stirring speech in the dressing room, posted by England on their official Twitter account. In the video, Stokes was seen urging his team-mates to keep pushing themselves to absolute extreme so as to realise their actual capabilities. \"I just want to say for the team going forward, Jos (Buttler) has always mentioned is just keep pushing the boundaries of what we do on that cricket field. Whether it will be with bat, ball or field, take yourselves to the extremes because that's when we are able to go out and do stuff like no one else can do as a team. Not many teams still feel like, I personally was there today and feeling we're still in the game even with four overs left to go. \"Not many teams can feel like that when they are seven or eight down because of what we have got in this dressing room. In the field as well, we've got some unbelievable athletes and just keep pushing ourselves to the absolute extremes to realise what we are all capable of. If you don't do that and you don't test that out when you are training, you are probably never going to know what your limit is,\" said Stokes in the beginning of his speech. Stokes ended his ODI career at 105 matches, making 2924 runs with a batting average of 39 and a strike rate of 95, including three centuries and 21 half-centuries. He also picked 74 wickets at an average of 42.39 and economy rate of 6.05. He had strong words of advice and encouragement for white-ball skipper Jos Buttler, who is in his first month of being the England ODI and T20I captain since international retirement of Eoin Morgan. \"To Jos, never doubt yourself, never doubt any decisions you make, as a leader and as a captain. You are an incredible human being and an incredible player. Whatever you do, for a fact that you are going to have all ten blokes in the field to follow you. You are one of those blokes who ooze class.

The innings seemed to be heading towards an ordinary total despite Stirling's promising innings. Harry Tector tried to turn things around with two boundaries off the first two balls of the 17th over, but a big heave next ball saw him holing out to leave Ireland in further trouble. However, Curtis Campher joined hands with Mark Adair and things started looking up for Ireland from thereon. The pair put on a 58-run partnership in 21 balls as Ireland smashed 50 runs in the last three overs. Four fours and four sixes came off the three overs as Ireland posted a competitive 174 on board. Ireland, however, managed to pull things back with the wicket of Guptill. George Dockrell had created chances twice in succession against Glenn Phillips only to see two catches go down. But he found reward at the other end with the big wicket of Guptill the very next ball. After 10 overs, the game was in the balance with New Zealand on 83/3. Phillips and Daryl Mitchell took over from there to build a steady stand. In the first six overs of the partnership, only two boundaries came as New Zealand ambled along to 112/3 in 14 overs. With 63 needed in six overs, Mitchell and Phillips turned the game on its head with a 20-run over against Campher. While Joshua Little had Mitchell out caught and bowled for 48 in 32 balls in the 17th over, the 82-run stand between Phillips and Mitchell had all but sealed the match for New Zealand. Phillips stayed on to complete his half-century and take New Zealand home with six balls to spare and give New Zealand a 3-0 series victory. Brief scores: Ireland 174/6 in 20 overs (Paul Stirling 40, Lorcan Tucker 28, Mark Adair 37 not out) lost to New Zealand 180/4 in 19 overs (Martin Guptill 25, Glenn Phillips 56 not out, Daryl Mitchell 48; Josh Little 2/33) by six wickets.
