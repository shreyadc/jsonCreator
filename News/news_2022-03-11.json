The SCG posted a touching thread on Twitter about Warne following his death last weekend. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said details for the memorial service were still being finalised, including the need to follow any COVID-19 health and safety protocols. He said there would be no restrictions on crowd numbers for the service, with the MCG’s stands able to hold more than 100,000 people. Warne’s private funeral is expected to be held next week. The Premier said he hoped the public reaction to Warne’s death comforted the cricket great’s family. “It is a very difficult time for them,” he said. “I hope that it would be made just that little bit easier by the fact that there has been such an outpouring of grief and support.

India’s tour of Australia 2020-21 has been etched in the hearts and minds of each and every Indian Cricket fan. The historic tour was a consummate example of pushing one’s limit to not only turn the tables, but to turn them without a warning, despite the backs against the wall. Post team India went 0-1 down, courtesy of an embarrassing show with the bat which bundled them up for mere 36 team runs in the second innings, team India were written off by almost all the fans, experts, and pundits of the sport. With their skipper Virat Kohli also having to leave the squad, the series verdict was all but formally written. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan had even gone on to predict a 4-0 series result in favour of Australia, even before the second Test began at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Michael Vaughan’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy result prediction humbles him Under Ajinkya Rahane for the rest of the series, India made a stellar comeback out of nowhere to first win the MCG Test, then eke out a Draw from the jaws of defeat at the SCG during the third Test, and then finally breach Australia’s fortress at The Gabba in Brisbane, chasing a record 328 runs in the 4th innings. By the time India commenced the fourth Test at The Gabba, more than half the Indian side were down with injuries of its regular players in the squad, with a certain Mohammed Siraj- just two international Tests into his career, handed the responsibility to lead the pace attack. The final scorecard read 2-1 in favour of India. Michael Vaughan, clearly taken aback after the series while writing for The Telegraph stated, “India looked shot after (Adelaide Test) match and with all the selection issues they had, even India’s most one-eyed fans would not have predicted a comeback.

During the third day of the first Test of the ongoing England’s tour of West Indies in Antigua, England fast bowler Mark Wood injured his elbow to not let him bowl on a day when his team needed him to play a huge role in dismissing the opposition. Wood, 32, was late to reach the field when play started earlier in the day. It was only a few minutes later that there were visuals of him getting his elbow strapped. It was in the 74th over of the West Indian innings that England captain Joe Root introduced Wood into the bowling attack. Having given away 13 runs in his four-over spell in the first hour of the day, Wood was recalled into the attack only to bowl the 88th over. Mark Wood Injury Update A few overs later, England walked back to their dressing room to break for lunch whilst there being suspense about Wood’s fitness. With all-rounder Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes far from their best due to form and fitness-related reasons respectively, Wood’s absence had it in it to dent England’s progress. An ECB (England Cricket Board) spokesperson eventually confirmed that Wood will remain unavailable to bowl throughout the first innings at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Woody unlikely to bowl again this innings #WIvENG — England’s Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) March 10, 2022 Wood, who bowled 17 overs in the first innings, conceded 45 runs to pick the lone wicket of West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite (55) on Day 2. Will Mark Wood play IPL 2022? Wood, who was bought by Indian Premier League franchise Lucknow Super Giants for an impressive price of INR 7.5 crore during the mega auction held in Bengaluru last month, is scheduled to head to India for the 15th season of the biggest T20 tournament across the world slated to be played March 26 – May 29. ALSO WATCH: Mark Wood hilariously joins England’s team huddle from a distance It is worth mentioning that nothing official has been confirmed with respect to the extent of Wood’s injury. Hence, it would be premature to comment on his IPL 2022 availability. For now, it isn’t even confirmed if Wood will bowl in the second innings of the ongoing match or not.

With all-rounder Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes far from their best due to form and fitness-related reasons respectively, Wood’s absence had it in it to dent England’s progress. An ECB (England Cricket Board) spokesperson eventually confirmed that Wood will remain unavailable to bowl throughout the first innings at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Woody unlikely to bowl again this innings 💔 #WIvENG — England’s Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) March 10, 2022 Wood, who bowled 17 overs in the first innings, conceded 45 runs to pick the lone wicket of West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite (55) on Day 2. Wood, who was bought by Indian Premier League franchise Lucknow Super Giants for an impressive price of INR 7.5 crore during the mega auction held in Bengaluru last month, is scheduled to head to India for the 15th season of the biggest T20 tournament across the world slated to be played March 26 – May 29 . ALSO WATCH: Mark Wood hilariously joins England’s team huddle from a distance It is worth mentioning that nothing official has been confirmed with respect to the extent of Wood’s injury. Hence, it would be premature to comment on his IPL 2022 availability. For now, it isn’t even confirmed if Wood will bowl in the second innings of the ongoing match or not.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WAU vs NSW Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Australia One Day Cup 2021/22, Final","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/wau-vs-nsw-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-australia-one-day-cup-2021-22-final?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Anjishnu Roy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 19:16:24","full_description":"Western Australia will take on New South Wales in the final of the Australia One Day Cup 2021/22 at the Junction Oval in Melbourne on Friday.

Pakistan have already lost their first two games and will be hoping to rebuild against South Africa. South Africa have already won their first match, defeating Bangladesh in a thriller. Both teams will be hoping to put in a good display and build some stability in their respective campaigns in Bay Oval. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) The ICC Women’s World Cup 2022 is up and running and we have witnessed some enthralling contests so far. We are now into match number 9 which sees South Africa Women take on Pakistan Women at the Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui. Both teams have had different stories so far. South Africa Women have managed to grab two points in their opening clash, while Pakistan Women have failed to register a win in their first two games. After a decent batting show, South Africa Women put up an exceptional bowling performance that helped them get over the line in their first game against Bangladesh Women. Coming into this game they will want to step up with the bat. Their top-order failed to score runs in the first game and they will be hoping they can score big this time. Ayabonga Khaka was their stand-out player in the previous game, she grabbed four wickets and helped her side win. She will want to replicate the same and continue her sublime form. Their bowling department looks lethal and they are well and truly capable of causing trouble yet again. Pakistan Women, on the other hand, have a lot to think about. They have lost their first two games and have failed to give a tough fight on both occasions. They do have a quality side but they have not been able to perform as a unit. Their batting has been more of a concern for them, captain, Bismah Maroof did score some runs in their previous game, but she had no support from the other players and ended up with a below-par total. Other batters will have to pull their socks up going ahead in this competition. They do have some good bowlers in their ranks but they have not been up to the mark, they too will need to put their best foot forward. Pakistan Women have started this mega event on a losing note, but they will want to change things around before it gets too late for them. They are currently languishing at the bottom of the table but they will be hoping they can grab two vital points and move forward. Will Pakistan Women register their first win? Or will South Africa Women carry their winning momentum forward? We will find out soon.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/1sii5h1g_pakistan-afp_625x300_11_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chris Woakes leading England’s bowling attack ‘not fair’, says Steve Harmison, who ‘feels sorry’ for seamer in Antigua","link":"https://talksport.com/sport/cricket/1061155/chris-woakes-england-bowling-attack-not-fair-steve-harmison/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport","England Cricket"],"creator":["Jackson Cole"],"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Harmison expressed his sympathy for Chris Woakes, saying that it was ‘not fair’ on the seam-bowling all-rounder that he was put in the position to lead the attack in the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.

Opening the bowling on day two of the first Test, Woakes experienced one of his worst days with the ball in Test cricket as his first three overs went for 23 runs with West Indian batters Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell punished his wavering lines and lengths. In Anderson and Broad’s absence, Woakes led England’s bowling attackGetty But it proved to be a tough day for the Warwickshire manAFP By the end of the day’s play, Woakes had bowled 12 overs and taken just one wicket at the cost of 54 runs. “It’s as tough as I’ve seen Chris Woakes have a day with the red-ball from a consistency point of view,” Harmison said on talkSPORTS 2’s commentary of the Test in Antigua. “He’s bowled both sides of the wicket and I don’t mind him bowling straight but the last couple he’s been too legside and it’s been an easy clip off the legs for the West Indian batsman.” Ahead of the series, Woakes admitted that he feared being dropped after a disastrous Ashes series in which he took just six wickets in three matches at an average of 55.33. It furthered concerns about his contrasting home and away records which sees him average 22.63 with the ball at home, but 52.38 away. Woakes’ struggles with the ball here were increased by a surface in Antigua. That has been very good for batting led to all the bowlers struggle once the ball has gotten older and softer.

Congratulations to Aap !!! — Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) March 10, 2022 Akin his political career, which began in the year 2004, Navjot Sidhu had to go through some topsy-turvy days during his Cricketing-career as well, having made his First-Class debut in November 1981 for Punjab against Services. An impressive show at the domestic level for the Punjab side, which began with a half-century on debut, it took mere two years for Sidhu to earn his maiden India call-up in 1983 after he smashed a century for the North Zone against West Indies. However, post a couple of Tests against the Windies at home, the right-hander was dropped from the Indian side and failed to make a comeback until exactly five years later against New Zealand in 1988. Navjot Singh Sidhu cricket career Navjot Singh Sidhu made a stellar comeback to the Indian Test side by smashing an impressive century against the Kiwis in Bengaluru. During his Test career, which ended in January 1999, ‘Sixer Sidhu’- as he was popularly named, amassed a total of 3,202 runs across 51 Test matches (78 innings), at an average of 42.13, with the help of 15 half-centuries and 9 centuries. Before making his return back to the Indian Test side, the now 58-year-old, made his ODI debut during the 1987 Cricket World Cup, and got himself registered in the record books right away.

Congratulations to Aap !!! — Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) March 10, 2022 Akin his political career, which began in the year 2004, Navjot Sidhu had to go through some topsy-turvy days during his Cricketing-career as well, having made his First-Class debut in November 1981 for Punjab against Services. An impressive show at the domestic level for the Punjab side, which began with a half-century on debut, it took mere two years for Sidhu to earn his maiden India call-up in 1983 after he smashed a century for the North Zone against West Indies. However, post a couple of Tests against the Windies at home, the right-hander was dropped from the Indian side and failed to make a comeback until exactly five years later against New Zealand in 1988. Navjot Singh Sidhu made a stellar comeback to the Indian Test side by smashing an impressive century against the Kiwis in Bengaluru. During his Test career, which ended in January 1999, ‘Sixer Sidhu’- as he was popularly named, amassed a total of 3,202 runs across 51 Test matches (78 innings), at an average of 42.13, with the help of 15 half-centuries and 9 centuries.

Warner said batters have only themselves to blame if they end up being dismissed in such a manner. “There’s no doubt about that, and if you’re silly enough to get caught out like that and run out, that’s your own fault. You’re told not to leave before the bowler lets the ball go, so just don’t do it,” Warner said. The dismissal first came to be known when the legendary former India allrounder Vinoo Mankad twice ran out Australia opener Bill Brown at the non-striker’s end — once in a tour game against an Australia XI at the SCG in 1947, and then again in the second Test of the ensuing series. The Australian media dubbed it as ‘Mankading’, a name which stuck in popular parlance but was vehemently opposed by legends like Sunil Gavaskar for being “disrespectful” towards Mankad. Warner does not believe the switch from ‘unfair’ to ‘legitimate’ will cause bowlers to pursue such a dismissal more often as it would only slow down the game. “I think what’s important for the game of cricket is that bowlers don’t be looking for that, because then you’re going to slow the game down even more,” he said. “I know from before, being a captain, it can be frustrating and you’re taking time out of the game. “So there’s some areas there that need to be addressed, but that’s on an individual basis,” he added. Requires zero skill: Broad ================= England fast bowler Stuart Broad has also endorsed Warner’s views. Responding to MCC’s announcement, Broad wrote on Twitter “Hasn’t it always been a legitimate dismissal and whether it is unfair is subjective? and added Mankad “requires zero skill”. Indian ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin had ignited the most recent debate about the tactic’s legitimacy by dismissing England’s Jos Buttler in an Indian Premier League match in 2019. He has been advocating for its usage by the bowlers if the batters do not respond to warnings on backing up too far.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"International Cricket Council reveals rating for Rawalpindi pitch","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/international-cricket-council-reveals-rating-for-rawalpindi-pitch-20220311-p5a3pa.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Tom Decent"],"video_url":null,"description":"There was no shortage of pitch criticism in Australia’s first Test against Pakistan, where 14 wickets fell across five days, and now the ICC has gone public with a pitch rating.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 15:03:25","full_description":"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has rated the Rawalpindi pitch “below average” after Australia and Pakistan’s dull draw in the first Test.

In response to England's first innings total of 311, the hosts reached 202 for four at Stumps on Day 2, with Nkrumah Bonner and Jason Holder set to resume batting. Kraigg Brathwaite top-scored for the side on Day 2 with a knock of 55 runs off 70 balls. Meanwhile, for England's bowling department, Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Mark Wood and Ben Stokes have taken a wicket each. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) We are back for West Indies' reply! The English players have made their way out to the middle. Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell to open the batting for West Indies. Chris Woakes will start proceedings with the ball for England. Three slips and a gully in place. Here we go... ... Second innings ... West Indies had a sensational start as their bowlers were breathing fire with the red cherry. Kemar Roach, Jayden Seales wrecked England's top order and Jason Holder followed it up by bowling impeccable lines and lengths and with great consistency and also bagged the wicket of Lawrence. It was a different story later as in the middle and the final session, as they allowed some partnerships to build and were blown away by Bairstow's counter-attack. It was the short ball ploy that worked in their favor on Day 2, as Seales struck twice and then Joseph ended the proceedings bagging two wickets. They would be pleased that they didn't allow England to add much to their overnight score and now it's onto their batters to come out and show positive intent. Their first target would be to enter the Lunch unscathed. Let's see if they are able to achieve that or not. Electing to bat first, England were in all sorts of trouble as the top order collapsed leaving the side with 48/4. After that, Stokes and Foakes stitched crucial partnerships with Bairstow but they could not convert their starts. However, Jonny Bairstow bailed England out of trouble with a remarkable century and they ended Day 1 on 268/6. He found another sustainable partner in Chris Woakes and they built a 71-run stand before Woakes holed out. The tail-enders could not do much with the bat and England added 43 runs to their overnight score with Bairstow walking back with just 10 runs short of his 150 . If it hadn't been him, England would have never reached here. All the credit to Bairstow for putting up a show and helping England to get out of the rut. Jonny Bairstow walks back with a huge round of applause from the English supporters and his teammates. A fine innings from him as it has lifted England to 311. OUT! TAKEN! Alzarri Joseph ends the proceedings. Bowls a length ball, on off. Jonny Bairstow goes for the heave. The ball goes off the top edge and goes high up in the air towards gully. Jason Holder settles himself underneath and takes the skier. England are bundled out for 311. Length ball, outside off. Jonny Bairstow pushes it to point. Short of a length, outside off. Jonny Bairstow guides it to third man but does not take a single. A length ball, outside off. Jack Leach leaves it alone this time. FOUR! Edged but it sneaks through the keeper and first slip! Roach is absolutely gutted with that! A full ball, outside off. Jack Leach prods and looks to push it away from his body. It takes the outside edge and goes past the keeper and first slip for a boundary. Joshua Da Silva should have surely gone for it. A short ball, around off. Jonny Bairstow swivels and pulls it along the ground towards fine leg. He takes a single this time. Back of a length, angling down leg. Jonny Bairstow sways away from the line of the ball and lets it go through to the keeper. Another short ball, around off. Jonny Bairstow pulls it along the ground towards mid-wicket. A bumper, around off. Jonny Bairstow ducks underneath. Leg bye! Short of a length, angling in from off. Jonny Bairstow looks to heave it away but he misses and gets hit on his thigh pad. The ball rolls to the off side and the batters sneak in a leg bye. Back of a length, well outside off. Jonny Bairstow lets it through to the keeper. Drinks! West Indies bowlers are bowling with much more aggression and it looks like the short ball ploy is working for them. They have got three wickets and will look to wrap things up quickly. Jonny Bairstow is still at the crease and he will look to pile up as many runs as he can now before his side gets bundled out. Jack Leach is the last batsman in. OUT! CAUGHT! The ploy of bowling short has done the trick for West Indies and Alzarri Joseph! This is a well-directed bumper, around off. Wood looks to pull but the ball hurries onto him and it goes off the top edge, in the air towards the point fielder. Veerasammy Permaul there, settles under it and pouches it with ease. England lose their ninth wicket and Alzarri Joseph gets his first of the innings. Joseph serves a length ball, around middle. Wood covers the line of the ball and defends it onto the deck. Back of a length, well outside off. Mark Wood leaves it alone for the keeper to collect it.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/bnpplm3g_holder-afp_625x300_10_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Sri Lanka, Day/Night Test: Will Jayant get another chance or one among Siraj or Axar feature in - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi1AFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9zcmktbGFua2EtaW4taW5kaWEvaW5kaWEtdnMtc3JpLWxhbmthLWRheS9uaWdodC10ZXN0LXdpbGwtamF5YW50LWdldC1hbm90aGVyLWNoYW5jZS1vci1vbmUtYW1vbmctc2lyYWotb3ItYXhhci1mZWF0dXJlLWluLXRoZS1wbGF5aW5nLXhpL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkwMTMxNTU1LmNtc9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Sri Lanka, Day/Night Test: Will Jayant get another chance or one among Siraj or Axar feature in  Times of IndiaIND vs SL: Rohit Sharma Set To Become 9th Indian Player To Play In More Than 400 International Matches  Cricket AddictorIndia vs Sri Lanka: 100 per cent attendance to be allowed at Bengaluru's Chinnaswamy stadium for second Test  Hindustan TimesSecond IND vs SL 2022 Test in Bengaluru to be staged with 100 percent crowd capacity  SportskeedaIndia vs Sri Lanka: Rohit Sharma-Virat Kohli in a duel for pink-ball Test batting supremacy  India TodayView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 13:53:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"David Warner feels run-out at non-striker's end a batter's fault but still a spirit of cricket issue","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/david-warner-feels-run-out-at-non-strikers-end-a-batters-fault-but-still-a-spirit-of-cricket-issue-2444204.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Stuart Broad is not in favour of such a dismissal while Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar have backed the change.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 13:05:00","full_description":"MCC has introduced several news laws of cricket.
