The six franchises have started assembling in Karachi with the Pakistan Cricket Board launching the seventh edition of the league on January 27 at the National Stadium in Karachi. On Thursday, sources said that three franchises had reported five positive cases of players and officials. \"These are the first positive cases in Karachi among the teams,\" one source said. Quetta Gladiators franchise has already lost three overseas signings including Shermon Hetmayer, James Faulkner and Luke Woods for their first match as the trio tested positive and have gone into isolation before they even boarded the flight to Karachi. An official of the Pakistan board made it clear that they were prepared for all situations because of the rising Covid-19 cases in the country and the league was still on schedule. \"We have clear contingency plans because of the Covid-19 situation around the globe. Even if a franchise is without seven to eight players because of any cases their matches will still go on schedule and the players will go into isolation at their team hotel, he said. He said learning to live with COVID was a reality now in cricket and despite positive cases in different cricket playing nations matches were going on or being postponed or rescheduled by a few days. He pointed out that even the ongoing ICC U-19 World Cup in the West Indies had been hit by Covid positive cases but the tournament was continuing. \"All boards have drawn up contingency plans as we have so we are confident that the PSL will be completed on schedule,\" he said.

The charges stem from the findings made last month by the Social Justice and Nation Building Ombudsman, who is looking into alleged discrimination within the sport's national governing organisation in the past. \"While Mr Boucher is being charged with gross misconduct, which could lead to his dismissal, CSA emphasises it is important that the independent inquiry first needs to test all allegations before any question of sanction can arise,\" CSA said in a statement. Former spinner Adams said he had been subjected to racial slurs in a South Africa team song during his time in the side, which spanned a nine-year period from 1995 to 2004, including by former wicketkeeper Boucher who has since apologised. \"I look forward to dealing with and defending these allegations which have been made and will do so at the hearing in due course,\" Boucher said in a statement. \"For now I am solely focused on my duties as head coach of the Proteas.\" CSA also said that the inquiry, for which a timetable will be set on January 26, will consider \"concerns and allegations\" that arose following the resignation - in August 2021 - of former South Africa assistant coach Enoch Nkwe.

The report said selection decisions made during their times as captain of the side were prejudicial towards Black players. Smith and de Villiers have denied the allegation. Boucher is in charge of the South Africa one-day international side, who are one game into a three-match home series against India. South Africa are due to tour New Zealand for two test matches, with the first starting on February 17.","image_url":"https://e0.365dm.com/22/01/1920x1080/skysports-mark-boucher-south_5647598.jpg?20220120194607","source_id":"skysports"},{"title":"Legends League Cricket 2022: Yusuf, Irfan shine as India Maharajas beat Asia Lions","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/india-maharajas-beats-asia-lions-legends-league-cricket-2022-yusuf-irfan-pathan-kaif/article38299893.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Team Sportstar"],"video_url":null,"description":"Yusuf Pathan stole the show with his 40-ball 80 as the India Maharajas chased down a 176-target set by the Asia Lions in the inaugural match of the league in Muscat on Friday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-20 19:21:46","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar"},{"title":"Highlights IMR vs ALN Legends Cricket League 2022 T20 Match Updates: India Maharajas Beat Asia Lions By 6 Wic - India.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2hsaWdodHMtaW1yLXZzLWFsbi1sZWdlbmRzLWNyaWNrZXQtbGVhZ3VlLTIwMjItdDIwLW1hdGNoLXVwZGF0ZXMtaW5kaWEtbWFoYXJhamFzLWJlYXQtYXNpYS1saW9ucy1ieS02LXdpY2tldHMtNTE5NjM1My_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Highlights IMR vs ALN Legends Cricket League 2022 T20 Match Updates: India Maharajas Beat Asia Lions By 6 Wic  India.comIndia Maharajas vs Asia Lions Live Steaming and Live Telecast Details, Legends League Cricket 2022  Cricket AddictorLegends League Cricket 2022: All you need to know  News18India Maharajas vs Asia Lions HIGHLIGHTS, Legends League Cricket 2022: Yusuf, Irfan, Kaif power India to six-wicket win  SportstarLegends League Cricket 2022 Schedule, Squad, Teams, Broadcast In India, India Squad, Live Streaming  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-20 19:01:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Ganguly wanted to issue show cause notice to Kohli","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ganguly-wanted-to-issue-show-cause-notice-to-kohli-725504","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"In a major revelation in the whole Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli saga, it has been now learnt that the BCCI president wanted to issue a show cause notice to the then India Test captain before the beginning of the series against South Africa in December 2021.","content":"New Delhi: In a major revelation in the whole Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli saga, it has been now learnt that the BCCI president wanted to issue a show cause notice to the then India Test captain before the beginning of the series against South Africa in December 2021. Ahead of the Indian team's departure for South Africa, Virat addressed the press-conference and made some strong comments. He claimed that no one from the board or the selection committee had asked him to reconsider his decision to give up captaincy in the T20 cricket, contradicting Ganguly, who had said that he personally requested the star batter to not leave the leadership role in the shortest format of the game. The 33-year-old also complained about the lack of communication between him and the board before removing him as ODI captain. These comments made by Kohli in front of the media didn't go down well with the BCCI as it eventually showed both board and Ganguly in poor light. And it is understood that a convinced Ganguly, in what could have been an unprecedented move in the history of Indian cricket, had prepared a draft letter and wanted to send a show cause notice to Kohli for his outburst.","pubDate":"2022-01-20 18:35:14","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/20/1195988-gangulykohli.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"Raj, Goswami feature in ICC Women's 'ODI Team of Year'","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/raj-goswami-feature-in-icc-womens-odi-team-of-year-725501","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Veteran India players Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami featured in the ICC 'ODI Team of the Year' for women after they extended their consistent run in international cricket.","content":"Dubai: Veteran India players Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami featured in the ICC 'ODI Team of the Year' for women after they extended their consistent run in international cricket.

The 39-year-old Raj, the veteran India batter and captain, amassed the same number of runs as England opener Tammy Beaumont and at exactly the same average. But her 503 runs came when the Indian team struggled as a unit, making her contribution even more important.

The six franchises have started assembling in Karachi with the Pakistan Cricket Board launching the seventh edition of the league on January 27 at the National Stadium in Karachi. On Thursday, sources said that three franchises had reported five positive cases of players and officials. \"These are the first positive cases in Karachi among the teams,\" one source said. Quetta Gladiators franchise has already lost three overseas signings including Shermon Hetmayer, James Faulkner and Luke Woods for their first match as the trio tested positive and have gone into isolation before they even boarded the flight to Karachi. An official of the Pakistan board made it clear that they were prepared for all situations because of the rising Covid-19 cases in the country and the league was still on schedule. \"We have clear contingency plans because of the Covid-19 situation around the globe. Even if a franchise is without seven to eight players because of any cases their matches will still go on schedule and the players will go into isolation at their team hotel,? he said. He said learning to live with COVID was a reality now in cricket and despite positive cases in different cricket playing nations matches were going on or being postponed or rescheduled by a few days. He pointed out that even the ongoing ICC U-19 World Cup in the West Indies had been hit by Covid positive cases but the tournament was continuing. \"All boards have drawn up contingency plans as we have so we are confident that the PSL will be completed on schedule,\" he said. The last two PSL editions had to be stopped and rescheduled because of Covid-19 cases in Karachi.

Justice Asha Menon said that plaintiff Samir Kasal -- who contended that the defendants i.e. organisers of 'Legends League Cricket' misappropriated his idea-- failed to make out a prima facie case for grant of any interim relief and that none of the features of his concept reflected original thought. The plaintiff's ideas have been in the public domain for long and “none can claim an exclusive right to any of these ideas”, the judge added. The first edition of 'Legends League Cricket' began on January 20 in Oman. Justice Menon further said that the format of 'Legends League Cricket' was “significantly different” from that of the plaintiff and the defendant organisers were not copying any idea or concept of the plaintiff. The cricketers cannot be injuncted from playing for the defendants or any other organizer, as the plaintiff can claim no such exclusive right, she stated. To protect the interest of the plaintiff, the judge nonetheless directed defendant organisers to “maintain clear accounts of their earnings and expenditure in respect of the match/matches that are being organized at Oman (UAE) and file the same in court within one month of the conclusion of the league matches”. The court issued summons to the organisers on the lawsuit by Kansal and said if an order of stay is passed at this stage, loss to the defendants, the players, the sponsors, the media partners and the public at large cannot be compensated. “To say that because the plaintiff conceptualized a league match with retired cricketers in a 'T-10 Test Format' to be played at venues where there is Indian diaspora, and that being his idea, had become his exclusive right, is to stretch it too far to claim a right to seek an injunction against the 'Legends League Cricket' tournament organized by the defendants,” said the court in its order on January 19. “In this case, the fundamental similarity will be the 'game of cricket' and no one can claim a copyright to the 'game of cricket'. Several permutations and combinations in the format of playing the 'game of cricket' have been evolved over a period of centuries. Therefore, it is reasonable that there can also be no copyright in the evolution of cricket over a period of time, from a '5-Day Test Match Series', to the latest of 'T-20 Matches/One-Dayers'. Any such permutations and combinations would involve “innings” and “overs”,” it added. The plaintiff, represented by senior advocate Sandeep Sethi and advocate Srivats Kaushal, argued before the court that he was a well-known person in the sports industry and had worked with the defendant organisers on holding a limited-over cricket tournament with two teams namely, “Asia XI” and “World XI” made up of world cricket legends who have since retired. Promoted The plaintiff submitted that while no tournament, as conceptualised by him, could be held in 2020 and 2021 on account of the pandemic, he subsequently learnt through media reports that the defendants were organizing a tournament similar to his, under the name “Legends League Cricket”. In its order, the court observed that there was no document to reflect that there was a “firmed-up contract” entailing mutual obligations between the plaintiff and defendants and that claim of “confidentiality” against the defendants, as asserted by the plaintiff, cannot be permitted to continue indefinitely.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-05/j7h9l54_cricket-generic-afp_625x300_15_May_21.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"Ruthless Australia surge to win against England in Women’s Ashes T20 opener - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL2phbi8yMC9ydXRobGVzcy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtc3VyZ2UtdG8td2luLWFnYWluc3QtZW5nbGFuZC1pbi13b21lbnMtYXNoZXMtdDIwLW9wZW5lctIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL2phbi8yMC9ydXRobGVzcy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtc3VyZ2UtdG8td2luLWFnYWluc3QtZW5nbGFuZC1pbi13b21lbnMtYXNoZXMtdDIwLW9wZW5lcg?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ruthless Australia surge to win against England in Women’s Ashes T20 opener  The GuardianEllyse Perry axed from Aussie Ashes side  NEWS.com.auAussies take first-up points on back of McGrath magic | Women's Ashes 2021-22  cricket.com.auMcGrath stars in ultimate Ashes coronation  Mandurah MailLanning coy as Ashes call on Perry looms  Port Macquarie NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-20 16:53:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Team India’s handling of allrounder Venkatesh Iyer raises eyebrows - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC90ZWFtLWluZGlhLXZlbmthdGVzaC1peWVyLXNlbGVjdGlvbi1yb2xlLXJhaXNlcy1leWVicm93cy03NzM0MjM4L9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Team India’s handling of allrounder Venkatesh Iyer raises eyebrows  The Indian ExpressCan Markram find some form?

With Tendulkar, accompanied yet another Aussie great- Shane Warne, as the duo, carrying all the nervous energies by their side, were on their way to wish and meet the legend at his house in Adelaide on August 27. During an interaction with India Today a couple of years ago, Sachin Tendulkar (aged 47 in 2020), went nostalgic on his meeting with Bradman back in the year 1998. As per Tendulkar, both Warne and him were in a fix as to who would initiate the conversation first, as both the legends of the game exhibited a rare case of lack of clarity, albeit off the Cricket field.

After moments of deliberation, it was finally decided by Tendulkar that it would be an Aussie who would strike a conversation with a fellow Aussie first. “It was a big moment because I still remember from the hotel, Warnie was with me. Warnie was driving and he said ‘I am tensed, I am worried, what to talk to him about batting? You’re a batter, so you need to talk to him.’ “I said, ‘no, Aussie first’. I told him to start the conversation and I would follow up. So Shane Warne went inside and started talking a little bit,” said Tendulkar. Warne then asked Sir Bradman as to what he reckoned he would have averaged if he batted in today’s era (in 1998)? “Obviously, the natural question was ‘Sir Don, if you were batting in today’s era, what would you have averaged?’. He took about 10 seconds to think and said ‘maybe around 70’. Obvious reaction was ‘why only 70? Why not 99?’. “He said ‘common kid, it’s not bad for a 90-year-old man’. That was his response. He enjoyed watching cricket. He was up with the game. Those were special moments,” recalled a nostalgic Sachin Tendulkar. Averaging a world record of 99.94, Sir Don Bradman played a total of 52 Tests for Australia and scored a total of 6996 runs in his career. He retired in 1948, and earned the deserved knighthood the following year.       The post “I said ‘no, Aussie first'”: When Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne went all nervous on their way to meet Don Bradman appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-20 16:10:11","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"}]}
