The Football Association confirmed in January they were investigating the incident amid suspicious betting patterns. Xhaka was booked for time-wasting during what was, ultimately a straightforward 4-1 win for Arsenal at Elland Road against a severely understrength Leeds side, ravaged by injuries and suspension. A bet on Granit Xhaka getting booked against Leeds United is said to have earned one punter ¬£250,000 (Picture: Getty) With Arsenal cantering to three points, Xhaka was cautioned during the closing stages after he delayed taking a free-kick. The matter has now been referred to to the country‚Äôs leading organised crime agency, although there is no suggestion, according to the Daily Mail, that Xhaka or any of his Arsenal temmates are guilty of any wrongdoing. Suspicions were raised by a wager of nearly ¬£52,000 placed during the match on Xhaka to be booked in the final 10 minutes. The gamble is said to have landed on punter and astonishing payout of around ¬£250,000. The gambling industry has evolved to the extent whereby punters are able to bet on a variety of eventualities and possibilities within a match, on top of the traditional result-based markets. Those markets mean relatively innocuous events, which would likely have very little bearing on the overall outcome of a game, have the capacity to earn gamblers thousands of pounds.

He is now more than 2,000 runs clear of the other members of the Fab Four and on par with Tendulkar‚Äôs tally at the same age","content":"In sublime touch: The way Root is batting these days, he can even score with a toothbrush! | Photo Credit: Getty Images Batters are forever judged against two elusive benchmarks. One is a staggering numerical yardstick: 99.94, Don Bradman‚Äôs Test average. This is divine consistency marred by the mortal blemish of a meagre .06 percentage points. The other is a mystical aura that combines swagger, the disdainful emasculation of chewing gum and those rip-roaring shots deflating most bowlers, the kind that Vivian Richards exuded all through his career. The first yardstick is like the horizon, far and staying out of reach. The second gifts shock and awe in addition to a pathos-infused nostalgia about a past when men from the Caribbean ruled the cricketing world. Bradman‚Äôs numbers and Richards‚Äô halo can never be replicated and all that the other batting greats could do was to carve their own niche through their respective statistics ‚Äî runs scored, centuries etched and longevity at the crease. In that distinct space, Sachin Tendulkar reigns supreme: 200 Tests, 15,921 runs, 53.78 average and 51 hundreds. We are not even getting towards his ODI yield which is equally staggering. At different points in the last decade, a few names were whispered as possible challengers to Mount Tendulkar. But most wilted in that final stretch, suddenly conscious about their age, waning reflexes, sore limbs and a mind that said it was time for the rocking chair. There was a time when South African Graeme Smith, especially during his prolific start, was seen as one of those who might chase down the Mumbaikar. Incidentally during those Smith-ruling-the-charts days, Tendulkar was in Bangalore as part of an Indian training camp. A television reporter, once the cameras and microphones were turned off, walked beside the maestro and picked his brains on Smith. Tendulkar appreciated the South African‚Äôs dream-run and then said: ‚ÄúWe need to see how he does in the next few seasons and then we can judge. He is a good batsman but we need to watch how he performs in the coming seasons.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt a man speaking from envy, this was a legend talking from experience, acutely aware of the cyclical nature of form and conscious about the surprising way injuries could crop up in a sportsperson‚Äôs life. Smith eventually finished with 9,265 while Tendulkar‚Äôs immediate contemporaries like Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid ended their act after crossing 13,000 runs. In the subsequent generation, Alastair Cook, based on his initial consistency and with fewer summers in his rear-view mirror, was deemed a challenger. But at 33 and with 12,472 Test runs, he bid adieu and is placed fifth in the all-time list. Now another Englishman has nudged fans to ask that question ‚Äî could Mount Tendulkar be scaled? Root, in the middle of a Bradmanesque run, has suddenly steered clear of his other three middle-order challengers in the sweepstakes. His nimble ways at times remain unnoticed like a pickpocket hoodwinking passengers in a heaving bus. It is a contrast to the muscular look-at-me-ye-brethren aggro and angst that Virat Kohli exudes. Equally Root remains different from Kane Williamson‚Äôs sense of the philosopher ‚Äî who can forget his ‚Äòit is what it is‚Äô quip? And at the other end of the spectrum is Steve Smith whose batting style blends a maverick‚Äôs exaggeration with cascading runs. The four present a varied combo, like the bouquet of choices that the famous 1980s gang of Richards, Allan Border, Javed Miandad, David Gower and Dilip Vengsarkar offered through their middle-order heroics. At one point in the evolution of batting, Mount 10K was seen as this impossible peak until Sunil Gavaskar late-cut Ijaz Fakih at a raucous old Motera Stadium at Ahmedabad in 1987. Sportstar ran out of its commemorative copies and had to go for a reprint. Gavaskar eventually got company and with the latest entrant Root, there are 14 batters occupying this exclusive club. In his last 22 Tests, starting with the 228 against Sri Lanka at Galle during January 2021, Root the batter has largely held fort, while the skipper waned, especially after an Ashes defeat Down Under and another loss in the West Indies. As a willow-wielder there wasn‚Äôt much to fault him about as he vacillated among the 30s, 50s and the big hundreds with two double tons to boot. Overall in these 22 games, he struck 10 tons and specifically in the last 10 innings, he crossed the three-figure mark on four occasions. This wasn‚Äôt a case of a captain going down with the bat tucked behind. It was more about a skipper‚Äôs shelf-life darting up with a terse reminder while the batter within him had no cobwebs to deal with. And while his relatively more acclaimed rivals like Kohli (8,043 runs), Smith (8,010) and Williamson (7,289) trail behind him, Root is now at 10,194, riding on a fine stint against the visiting Black Caps. Root may look relatively leaner than the other three but in those wiry limbs there is boundless energy and a battle-ready heart is always ticking. Even during those early days that involved a nasty pub brawl with David Warner, Root showed that he could stand up and counter. As a batter, he has scored on all surfaces across countries, adept against pace and spin. Most importantly like he showed recently against New Zealand at Lord‚Äôs, he can handle the pressure of a tricky fourth innings chase. The result was a classy unbeaten 115 that helped new skipper Ben Stokes start on a winning note. Cook said that Root was the 'most complete English batter' he has seen while Kevin Pietersen could play an incredible innings. Those remarks also hinted at the different strains of English batting. Be it Geoff Boycott's more famous obduracy that spawned varied followers, ranging from the acclaimed Cook to the forgotten Chris Tavare. Or the muscular style that marked Graham Gooch, Allan Lamb and Robin Smith. The constant poetry and frustration associated with the stylish Gower. Or the game-altering dynamics inherent in Pietersen, Stokes and earlier Ian Botham. England has seen diverse batters over the decades and to this mix steps in Root, with his unique traits, ticking the scoreboard over and not averse to a cheeky remark, much akin to Miandad. He can drop anchor and Boycott once said Root reminds him of himself. Equally Root could reverse scoop a six as the New Zealand bowlers learnt. The right-hander did himself a good turn by relinquishing captaincy. Age is on his side but form, as earlier mentioned, is cyclical and cricket loves its cliched law of averages. England is more invested in Tests and he will get more avenues to score but Ashes jousts can be a drain when fortune looks the other way. Root is aware of this but for now he appears the most probable challenger to Tendulkar's Test runs. As comebacks go, this is as good as it gets and the hackneyed ‚ÄòEngland strikes roots‚Äô might become a recurring headline. For now he is in the form of his life and like veteran scribe R. Mohan wrote about Vengsarkar‚Äôs scorching runs in the mid-1980s, Root can now even score with a toothbrush! At 31 he is on par with what Tendulkar was at the same age in the Test arena. As for what lies ahead, it all depends on his form, fitness and above all the desire to stay the course, a trait that defined the great Tendulkar.

A resounding 82-run victory against South Africa during the fourth match of the ongoing five-match T20I series at the Saurashtra Cricket Association in Rajkot has meant that team India have not only bounced back by winning two games on the trot, but have also managed to level the series score line 2-2. The development has meant that it is the 5th T20I, set to be played at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, which will decide as to who clinches the trophy, which has been evenly contested so far. At the aforementioned venue, team India has won three, while lost two matches, with a winning percentage of 40. South Africa has played just a solitary T20I at this venue, which they had won by 9 wickets against India in the year 2019. The aforementioned match also happens to be the last T20I at the Chinnaswamy stadium, which is all set to host its eighth T20I after almost a three-year gap. Chinnaswamy Stadium owner The M.Chinnaswamy Stadium is located in the heart of the city of Bengaluru, and was formerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) Stadium. The stadium was later re-named as a tribute to Mangalam Chinnaswamy ‚Äì a lawyer, Cricket administrator, and the founding member of the Mysore State Cricket Association. He also served as the BCCI president from 1977-1980. As its former name suggested, the stadium is owned by the Government of Karnataka has been leased out to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.

When Karthik walked in to bat in the 13th over, India was in deep trouble at 81 for four after being asked to bat first on a tricky pitch that had some assistance for the fast bowlers with variable bounce. He had good support from Hardik Pandya, who gave the innings the initial momentum with his quickfire 46 (31b, 3x4, 3x6). The duo added 65 runs off just 33 balls for the fifth wicket as India finished strongly on 169 for six from 56 for three at the halfway stage. Once he got his eye in, Karthik flourished in the final phase of the innings as he swept the spinners and pacers with elan in his breezy knock as India managed 73 in the last five overs. AS IT HAPPENED | IND vs SA Highlights, 4th T20: India clinches 82-run win to level series 2-2 Karthik first went after Anrich Nortje, finding two boundaries through the off-side before launching into Keshav Maharaj by hitting the left-arm spinner for three consecutive boundaries in the 17th over, using both the sweep and reverse-sweep to good effect. In the very next over, Karthik went after Dwaine Pretorius by walking across to the off-stump to sweep the medium-pacer over the leg side for a six and a four as the bowler missed his length by bowling too full The 37-year-old Tamil Nadu batter then got to his maiden T20I half-century in style with a six, over mid-wicket in the final over off Pretorius. Needing 170 to win the series, South Africa‚Äôs chase never took off. Skipper Temba Bavuma had to retire after hurting his left elbow while diving to complete a run at the start of the fourth over. Quinton de Kock, who returned after recovering from a wrist injury, hit a few boundaries off Hardik but was run out after a mix-up with Pretorius. Avesh Khan (four for 14) soon had Pretorius caught behind while Yuzvendra Chahal accounted for Heinrich Klaasen leg-before-wicket. Harshal Patel then had the dangerous David Miller for the second time this series, castling him with a delivery that just angled across the left-hander. READ | Dinesh Karthik becomes oldest Indian to score T20I fifty Rassie van der Dussen and Marco Jansen tried to put up some fight, but Avesh struck thrice in the 14th over to remove the duo and seal the tie in India‚Äôs favour. Earlier, the South African seamers exploited the conditions well by targeting the good-length areas with the two-paced nature of the wicket now allowing the Indian batters to hit through the line. Lungi Ngidi, who replaced Kagiso Rabada, struck in his first over when he had Ruturaj Gaikwad caught at slip with the extra bounce. In the fourth over, Marco Jansen, replacing Wayne Parnell, had Shreyas Iyer trapped leg-before-wicket with a ball that seamed into the right-hander. Just after the PowerPlay, Ishan Kishan who looked good for his 27, tried to ramp Nortje over the wicketkeeper and the extra bounce had him edging to keeper de Kock. After struggling to get going, Pant yet again perished trying to hit a wide delivery outside off-stump from Maharaj only to top-edge it to the short-third man fielder. Fortunately, for the Men in Blue, Hardik and Karthik stepped up to the challenge and took the game away from the Proteas to ensure India lived another day to fight and forced the series into a decider in Bengaluru on Sunday.","pubDate":"2022-06-17 17:18:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs SA 4th T20 Man of the Match: Who is Man of the Match of today cricket match India vs South Africa Rajkot T20I?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ind-vs-sa-4th-t20-man-of-the-match-who-is-man-of-the-match-of-today-cricket-match-india-vs-south-africa-rajkot-t20i/","keywords":["Cricket","dinesh karthik","India","South Africa","South Africa tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs SA 4th T20 Man of the Match: The veteran Indian batter won a T20I match award after four years tonight.

Temba Bavuma has been retired hurt after hurting his left elbow.#TembaBavuma #INDvsSA #Cricket pic.twitter.com/MGXFqqrfGJ ‚Äî Wisden India (@WisdenIndia) June 17, 2022 Retired hurt batsman rules in t20 As per ‚ÄòLaw 25‚Äô of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) under the head ‚Äì ‚ÄòBatters retiring‚Äô, a batter may retire at any time during his/her innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to proceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring (law 25.4.1). Furthermore, if a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume his/her innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‚ÄòRetired ‚Äì not out‚Äô (law 25.4.2). Thus, despite Bavuma being entitled to resume his innings at the fall of any of the South African wickets post his return back to the pavilion, he decided against it, as South Africa were bundled up for 87 in mere 16.5 Overs, therby losing the match by 82 runs. Moreover, it is worth of a mention that a batter cannot resume his batting once the team management has decided to retire him Out, as was witnessed with Ravichandran Ashwin for the Rajasthan Royals in the recently concluded IPL 2022.

After being put in India had scored 169 for the loss of six wickets. However, the bowlers then dismissed South Africa for just 87 in 16.5 overs. The five-match series now stands at 2-2 with both sides having won two games each. None of the South African batters got going against the Indian bowlers who maintained tight line and length. Even though Harshal Patel (1/3 off 2 overs) bowled just two overs, he produced a magical delivery to send David Miller‚Äôs (9) stumps cart-wheeling. The top scorer for South Africa was Rassie van der Dussen (20) and only three of their batters managed to get double digit scores. Such was India‚Äôs dominance that the last five wickets of South Africa fell for only 13 runs. In the process, Dinesh Karthik the eternal comeback man of Indian cricket notched up his maiden T20 half century and gave the bowlers a total to bowl to after the hosts had been reduced to 81 for four wickets including the wicket of skipper Rishabh Pant (17) whose horrendous form with the bat continued. Karthik and Hardik Pandya (46, 31b, 3√ó4, 3√ó6) revived the Indian innings with some exhilarating strokeplay. They put on 65 runs for the fifth wicket in less than six overs as all the South Africa bowlers were taken to the cleaners. Karthik was particularly strong on square of the wickets on both sides with most of his boundaries coming in that region. However, the most pleasant shot was a lofted bowler‚Äôs back drive off Keshav Maharaj (1/30) that had class written all over it. In fact the pinch-hitting capability of the Indian batting line up now looks even more impressive with both Pandya and Karthik back in the slots. If Pant can find some form with the bat ahead of the T20 World Cup, it would certainly look good for India. The start however, was not very inspiring for India as Ruturaj Gaikwad (5) and Shreyas Iyer (4) fell cheaply. And when the inform Ishan Kishan (27) fell, things did not look too rosy for India. But then they recovered through Karthik and Pandya as South Africa bowlers went for 58 runs in the last four overs. Lungi Ngidi (2/20) was the most impressive among the South African bowlers. It remains a mystery as to why skipper Temba Bavuma did not use him for his full quota.

While Buttler smashed his second fastest century in mere 47 deliveries, Liam Livingstone (66* off 22) fell just one delivery short of scoring the joint-fastest half-century in One-Dayers, reaching the figure in mere 17 balls. If this was not it, the Eoin Morgan-led side also went on to smash the maximum sixes (26) in an ODI innings, again bettering their own record of 25 Sixes which they had hit versus Afghanistan in the year 2019.

It was a long wait since 2006 when Karthik made his T20I debut with Team India just ahead of the inaugural T20 World Cup. After being asked to bat at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Rajkot, India lost three wickets inside seven overs. At 81 for 4, Karthik walked in to bat and joined Hardik Pandya in the middle. Karthik and Pandya put up crucial 65 runs for the fifth wicket and brought India's innings back on the track. Karthik, who had a fine run with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022, struck nine fours and two sixes in his knock of 55 off 27 deliveries. Prior to this, Karthik's highest T20I score was 48, which he had recorded in India's first-ever T20I in 2006. Coincidentally the game was against South Africa in Johannesburg, which India won by six wickets and Karthik was named the Player of the Match. Notably, Karthik is the only player from the current team to have played the said game in Johannesburg 16 years ago. During the innings break in Rajkot, Karthik said that even though he feels old, referring to being a part of India's first T20I side in 2006, he also feels \"good that I'm alive and kicking and playing some cricket here.\" ùó™ùóõùóîùóß. ùóî. ùóûùó°ùó¢ùóñùóû üî•üíô55 (27) üëâ ùîªùïÇ OP ho jaaye, Paltan ü§© #OneFamily #INDvSA @DineshKarthik @BCCI pic.twitter.com/DbP10L7Eps Dinesh Karthik: Feels good to be still playing cricket after 16 years \"With how India were placed at 10 overs, it was important in the scheme of things, so I was very happy with what we did today.

Risks are something you need to accept and absorb in T20 cricket, so I was trying to weigh my options and figure out what to do,\" said Karthik after India posted 169 for 6 in 20 overs. When he was asked about still playing for India after 16 years since the team's maiden T20I outing, Karthik said,\" Whenever the question is asked, I feel old for a start, but apart from that it feels good to play the first-ever T20 for India; complete different generations. I read somewhere that out of both those teams 21 have retired out of the 22 have retired.

Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the fourth over, Pant was required to stitch a rescue act with India losing their top-order without a lot of success tonight. While Pant appeared to have made it a point to spend time in the middle, the 23-year old player failed to convert a slow start into something meaningful for the team. As a result, it was in the 13th over when Pant‚Äôs attempt of slogging a wide Keshav Maharaj delivery resulted in him lobbing a simple catch to Dwaine Pretorius at short third-man.

Marred by political tensions and bitter relations since decades now, India and Pakistan, who last played a limited Overs bilateral series in 2012-13, might well be seen playing for the same team in mid-2023. As per reports, the discussions for the Afro-Asia Cup, which was last played in the years 2005 and 2007, had been a part of the agenda during the International Cricket Council‚Äôs meeting in the month of April this year. Individuals involved during the aforementioned meetings were Jay Shah ‚Äì incumbent president of the ACC, newly elected chairman of African Cricket Association Sumod Damodar, and ACC chairman of development committee Mahinda Vallipuram. As per the Forbes magazine, the Afro-Asia Cup 2023 would be played in the T20 format, unlike the previous two editions, which were played in the ODI format. While it remains to be seen as to how many matches would be played during the series, further details on the same are likely to be divulged post ICC‚Äôs meeting next month. As per Pakistan journalist Arfa Feroz Zake, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), under the chairmanship of Ramiz Raja is expected to come up with a positive response on the same. It may finally boil down to a confirmation nod from the government of India and then the BCCI, if the conduction of the series has to take place. This is big news for Indo-Pak cricket fans!!!
