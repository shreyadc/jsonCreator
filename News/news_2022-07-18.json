Read full story","content":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Rugby Australia have handed a lifetime ban to a fan who climbed onto the roof of a stand at Sydney Cricket Ground and urinated during the test against England on Saturday. A 31-year-old man was arrested after the incident, which was filmed by other fans in the sellout crowd of 43,274 and posted on social media. \"The deplorable actions of the alleged intruder that made his way to the roof of the grandstand were disgraceful and dangerous,\" Rugby Australia said in a statement. \"This individual has been issued with a life ban from Rugby Australia events – and we will continue to support the authorities in their handling of the matter.\" Video also emerged of another fan berating England coach Eddie Jones from the sidelines as he walked past the historic Members' Stand. The Australian coach reacted angrily to being called a \"traitor\" by the fan and had to be held back by a security guard. \"The offensive remarks made by spectators ... towards England staff were unacceptable – and not representative of the values of rugby,\" the statement added. \"We have a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate behaviour, and we are working with Venues NSW on appropriate sanctions for these individuals.\" Australia's first match at the SCG since 1986 will probably be the last for many years with the finishing touches being put to the rebuilt Sydney Football Stadium next door ahead of its opening on Sept 2. England won the deciding third test 21-17 on Saturday to clinch the series 2-1.

A scintillating maiden ODI century of the highest order by Rishabh Pant , along with a complete all-round performance by Hardik Pandya has helped team India lift the three-match ODI series versus England 2-1, with a thumping 5 wicket-victory at the Emirates Old Trafford, in Manchester. Akin the second ODI at Lord’s the other day, the Indian top-order gave their wickets away cheaply, with the scorecard at one point in time reading 38/3 after 8.1 Overs. Following Rohit Sharma (17), Shikhar Dhawan (1), and Virat Kohli (17) in the dressing room was in-form Suryakumar Yadav (16) in the 17th Over as well, as India desperately needed a huge partnership to stand a chance to lift the series. With England right on top, the tables turned, and turned without a warning, as Rishabh Pant (125* off 113) joined hands with all-rounder Hardik Pandya (71 off 55) to stitch together a 133-run stand for the fifth wicket off mere 115 deliveries, to steer the Indian ship ever closer to the arrival point. A maiden ODI ton for Pant, and a half-century by Pandya with a career-best ODI bowling figures earlier in the day, meant that the two standout performances deserved nothing less than a sweet, satisfying victory, to end what has been a successful all-format tour for the Indian cricket team. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan, following Pant’s breathtaking century, took to his Twitter handle, to eulogize the wicket-keeper for his ‘entertaining’ and ‘smart’ knock. What a cricketer @RishabhPant17 is .. Incredibly entertaining but also very smart .. #ENGvIND — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) July 17, 2022 It is worth of a mention that Pant played second fiddle during the aforementioned partnership with Pandya, as he reached his fifty after facing 71 deliveries, thereby soaking in all the pressure of the series decider. However, post Pandya’s wicket during the 36th Over, Pant decided to operate at the fifth gear, going ballistic especially after the seamers, including a black and blue beating of David Willey, who was smashed for 21 runs with the help of five straight Fours during the 42nd Over of the chase.","pubDate":"2022-07-17 18:31:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rishabh Pant's hundred and Hardik Pandya brilliance power India to ODI series win over England - Sky Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvbmV3cy8xMjEyMy8xMjY1Mzc0MC9yaXNoYWJoLXBhbnRzLWh1bmRyZWQtYW5kLWhhcmRpay1wYW5keWEtYnJpbGxpYW5jZS1wb3dlci1pbmRpYS10by1vZGktc2VyaWVzLXdpbi1vdmVyLWVuZ2xhbmTSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rishabh Pant's hundred and Hardik Pandya brilliance power India to ODI series win over England  Sky SportsIndia vs England 3rd ODI highlights: Rishabh Pant century powers India to ODI series win vs England  Times of IndiaIND vs ENG 3rd ODI Live Cricket Score: Rishabh Pant’s maiden ODI century guides India to 2-1 series victory  The Indian ExpressRishabh Pant's Century Helps India Win ODI Series Against England  India TodayRecent Match Report - England vs India 3rd ODI 2022  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-17 18:30:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG 3rd ODI Man of the Series: Who won IND vs ENG Man of the Series in ODIs?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ind-vs-eng-3rd-odi-man-of-the-series-who-won-ind-vs-eng-man-of-the-series-in-odis/","keywords":["Cricket","England","India","India tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs ENG 3rd ODI Man of the Series: The Indian all-rounder won a series award for the second time in his ODI career.

During the third ODI of India’s tour of England 2022 in Manchester, India beat England by 5 wickets to register a 2-1 series. With England winning a one-off Test earlier this month and India winning both the white-ball series, the visitors have taken laurels with respect to the full tour. India, who’ve now won their 11th bilateral ODI series against England , have extended their dominating run over this opposition in the last decade. Readers must note that India have won six out of the last seven bilateral ODI series against England. England, who managed to dismiss the Indian top-order cheaply for the second consecutive time, had to give away all the progress made with the new balls in front of a match-winning 115-ball 133-run fifth-wicket partnership between India wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant (125*) and all-rounder Hardik Pandya (71). Pant, who was declared the Player of the Match for scoring a maiden ODI century on Sunday, managed to pin down Pandya (sixth ODI half-century and career-best bowling figures of 7-3-24-4) for this award. Having said that, 28-year old Pandya ended up winning the Player of the Series award for being the second-highest run-scorer and fourth-wicket wicket-taker. Pandya, who has won his second series award (after five years) in ODI cricket, scored 100 runs at a strike rate of 101.01 and picked six wickets at an average and strike rate of 12.33 and 17 respectively.

During the third ODI of India’s tour of England in Manchester, India beat England by 5 wickets to register a 2-1 series victory. The development means that India have extended their bilateral series lead against England to 11-7. Asked to bat first by his counterpart Rohit Sharma (17), England captain Jos Buttler’s 22nd ODI half-century remained the highlight of an otherwise below par innings. Had it not been for Buttler scoring 60 (80) with the help of three fours and two sixes, England might have not even scored 259/10 in 45.5 overs. A maiden ODI four-wicket haul enabled all-rounder Hardik Pandya to pick bowling figures of 7-3-24-4 to be the pick of the Indian bowlers today. Pandya, who dismissed the likes of Jason Roy (41), Ben Stokes (27), Liam Livingstone (27) and Buttler, thrived on the back of bowling short balls relentlessly at Old Trafford on Sunday. A second consecutive top-order collapse in a run-chase witnessed India getting reduced to 72/4 in the 17th over. However, it was a 115-ball 133-run fifth-wicket partnership between wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant and Pandya which turned the tables for the visitors. A near-flawless sixth ODI half-century saw Pandya dominating the partnership. With Pant surprisingly and maturely looking to take his time, Pandya was one hitting boundaries frequently to end up with 71 (55) at a strike rate of 129.09 comprising of 10 fours. “72/4, pressure on Hardik and Pant.” Meanwhile @hardikpandya7 and @RishabhPant17 : #ENGvIND pic.twitter.com/LkDs5ZDNqG — Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) July 17, 2022 Pant, on the other hand, registered a maiden ODI century scoring 125* (113) with the help of 16 fours and two sixes. Pant, who completed a 71-ball half-century, changed gears soon after to take only 25 more deliveries to reach the three-figure mark. As a result, the 24-year old player was declared the Player of the Match for the first time in his ODI career. “Hopefully, I will remember my first ODI century for the rest of my life. But when I was in there, I was just focusing on one ball at a time. When a team is under pressure and you bat like that, that’s what you aspire to do. I enjoy playing in England and will do whatever I can do to keep enjoying my cricket,” Pant told Sky Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony.","pubDate":"2022-07-17 17:39:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs England 3rd ODI HIGHLIGHTS: Pant, Pandya anchor India to 2-1 win in the series - Firstcricket News - Firstpost","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMixAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2ZpcnN0Y3JpY2tldC9zcG9ydHMtbmV3cy9pbmQtdnMtZW5nLTNyZC1vZGktbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGUtd2F0Y2gtMTctanVseS1qb3MtYnV0dGxlci1zLWVuZ2xhbmQtdnMtcm9oaXQtc2hhcm1hLWxlZC10ZWFtLWluZGlhLWNyaWNrZXQtbWF0Y2gtbGl2ZS1pbi1pbmRpYS0xMDkxOTEzMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs England 3rd ODI HIGHLIGHTS: Pant, Pandya anchor India to 2-1 win in the series - Firstcricket News  FirstpostIND vs ENG 3rd ODI Live Cricket Score: Rishabh Pant’s maiden ODI century guides India to 2-1 series victory  The Indian ExpressLive Cricket Score - England vs India, 3rd ODI | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIndia vs England 3rd ODI 2022 VIDEO Highlights: Pantastic Pant Finishes Off In Style To Give IND A Famous Ser  Cricket Country NewsIndian batters blew away a golden chance to seal the series  Gulf NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-17 17:31:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG 3rd ODI: Virat Kohli has NO century in ODI since between 2020 and 2022, check stat","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-eng-3rd-odi-virat-kohli-has-no-century-in-odi-since-between-2020-and-2022-check-stat-2486540.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli's bad fate in international cricket continued as he failed yet again in the third and last ODI vs England at Old Trafford in Manchester.

Kohli just scored 17 and went out amid a stunned silence at the ground. As soon as he got, reactions started pouring in as upset fans asking when will his next ton come? The fact is Kohli has not scored a hundred in last three years now. Between 2020 and 2022, Kohli has not ODI century. In fact, his last international ton came in 2019 in a Test match. But here's more to it: Between 2017 and 2019, Kohli scored 17 hundred in 75 matches, scoring 4029 runs at an average of 79.19. Those three were the best phase of his ODI career while the current one has been horrible. Kohli's dismal show in the third ODI did not affect India's chances in the match as India chased down the target of 260 with five wickets in hand. It was all thanks to Rishabh Pant who smashed a century and Hardik Pandya who slammed a fifty in the chase. Pant was specifically brilliant as he smashed five fours in a over of David Willey to guide the team home. Pant made 125 off 113 balls which included off 16 fours and 2 sixes respectively. England had no answer to onslaught of Pant as once he was settled in, he was a force to reckon with. India finishes the tour unbeaten in any series. England won the last Test to level the series 2-2.

During the third ODI of India’s tour of England 2022 in Manchester, India wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant and all-rounder Hardik Pandya put together a 133-run fifth-wicket partnership to stitch a stroke-filled rescue act. Chasing a 260-run target in a series decider, India were reduced to 72/4 in the 17th over when Pant and Pandya were united in the middle. The next 115 deliveries saw these two batters hitting 18 fours and a six between them to turn the tables at Old Trafford. Pandya, who dominated the partnership to score his eighth ODI half-century, ended up with 71 (55) including 10 fours at a strike rate of 129.09. Pant, on the other hand, appeared to have made a special attempt by putting price to his wicket. Not wanting to attack from the word go by playing unnecessarily risk-involved shots, Pant treated balls on merit to build from strength to strength. Batting at a strike rate of 65 even after playing more than 50 balls, Pant did manage to make up for the dot balls even when India didn’t require him to score at a brisk rate in the last 20 overs. It was on the last delivery of the 31st over when Pant hit England all-rounder Ben Stokes to bring up a sixth ODI half-century. Hitting three more fours on the next eight deliveries that he faced, Pant surely opened up after crossing the 50-run mark. It was an over later than Pant stepped out against England fast bowler Craig Overton to hit the first six of his innings.

During the third ODI of the ongoing India’s tour of England in Manchester, former India captain Virat Kohli failed to contribute significantly in a 260-run chase. While Kohli has been struggling for a long while in international cricket now, his bountiful fans were hoping for him to end a rut before beginning a rest period when the team will be touring West Indies. Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the third over, Kohli looked positive with his timing and footwork to provide early impressions of finding form at the highest level. In what has become a routine now for the 33-year old player, Kohli ended up getting out after a brief start which saw him scoring 17 (22) with the help of three fours. It all happened on the first delivery of the ninth over when Kohli put on display a replica of his dismissal from the second ODI. Facing left-arm pacer Reece Topley from over the wicket, all Kohli did was edge the ball to England captain Jos Buttler behind the wickets. Coming on the back of a career-best performance in the last match at Lord’s, Topley extended his form by dismissing the third Indian batter in the form of Kohli in his first spell at Old Trafford on Sunday. It is noteworthy that Kohli’s dismissal reduced his team to 48/3 in the first powerplay. Virat Kohli had raised his standards so high that now even an average of 36.75 is looking bad. It’s not that he is terribly out of form but only failing to convert scores into centuries like he used to do in the past. He still has 9 fifties in last 20 innings in ODIs. #EngvInd pic.twitter.com/TLuJCDbrlR — Mazher Arshad (@MazherArshad) July 17, 2022 Given the form that he is in, it is no surprise that Kohli has batted way below his standards in his last 10 and 20 ODI innings . As far as his last 30 innings in the format is concerned, Kohli has done quite better scoring 1,257 runs at an average of 44.89 and a strike rate of 90.23 with the help of two centuries and 12 half-centuries. Kohli, whose last ODI century had come as late as August 2019, has scored 824 runs in 23 innings at an average and strike rate of 35.82 and 87.94 respectively including 10 half-centuries in this period.","pubDate":"2022-07-17 15:14:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shikhar Dhawan last 10 ODI innings score: Shikhar Dhawan last 10 innings in ODIs full list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-shikhar-dhawan-last-10-odi-innings-score-shikhar-dhawan-last-10-innings-in-odis-full-list/","keywords":["Cricket","India tour of England 2022","Shikhar Dhawan"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shikhar Dhawan last 10 ODI innings score: Failing to bat with his well known flair, Dhawan has had a forgetful tour of England this year.

During the third ODI of the ongoing India’s tour of England at the Emirates Old Trafford in Manchester, India’s hopes of clinching the three-match series have been handed an early dent, as both their openers – Shikhar Dhawan (1 off 3) and skipper Rohit Sharma (17 off 17) headed back towards the dressing room within the first five Overs of the run chase. An impressive bowling performance for the third successive occasion , led by all-rounder Hardik Pandya (7-3-24-4) who notched-up his career-best ODI figures, meant that team India bundled up the English batting line-up for 259 in 45.5 Overs. It is worth of a mention that this is the seventh successive ODI in which India have bowled out the opposition, with the last time of the same happening during the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. As for the famed Indian opening pair of Dhawan and Rohit, who recently became only the 4th pair in ODI history to complete 5,000 runs in the format, the experienced duo have, for the second consecutive game put their side in deep waters early in the chase.

During the second day of the first Test of Pakistan’s tour of Sri Lanka 2022 in Galle, Pakistan captain Babar Azam registered a seventh Test century to bail his team out of trouble under testing circumstances. Azam, 27, resumed from his overnight score of 1* to score a praiseworthy 119 (244) with the help of 11 fours and two sixes. In what is Azam’s third Test century (most against any opposition) against Sri Lanka, it is his sixth in Asia, fifth at No. 4, second away from home, as captain and in 2022 and first in Sri Lanka. With Pakistan being reduced to 85/7 at one point in time, a substantial first innings trail was on the cards for the visitors. However, grinding hard from one end, a resolute Azam made it a point to not give up so easily. Primarily known for an amalgamation of technique and patience, the right-handed batter successfully combated a challenge possessed by Sri Lankan spinners. It is worth mentioning that Azam received strong support from fast bowler Naseem Shah (5*) as the duo hustled together to put together a 185-ball 70-run partnership for the 10th wicket. Nowhere near the highest 10th wicket partnerships in Test cricket, Azam and Shah’s stand was enough for Pakistan to score 218 (only two runs short of Sri Lanka’s first innings total) in 90.5 overs. In addition to a century which will be remembered for a long time, Azam also managed to complete 10,000 runs in international cricket – becoming the fifth-fastest batter to do the same.

However the Indian bowlers were at their best yet again, and the new addition Mohammed Siraj had an instant impact on the match. He took the wickets of Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root in his very first over and broke the back of the English side. Both English batters could not open their account. The bowler Hardik Pandya proved his class with the ball, where he bowled an incredible spell of 7-3-24-4. Due to his brilliance, England managed to score just 259 runs in the first innings. Former Indian batter Wasim Jaffer has appreciated the efforts of Indian bowlers in the ongoing ODI series. Ahead of the series, Michael Vaughan said that he won’t be surprised if the English team scores over 400 runs in an innings. Jaffer took a dig at that statement of Michael Vaughan as well. He said that this English team never look so tied in a home ODI series and Jasprit Bumrah was not even playing the match. Jaffer also mentioned Hardik Pandya for his excellent performance in the match. “There were talks about Eng scoring 400 pre series, but the way Indian bowlers have bowled has been great to watch. Can’t remember last time Eng were so tied down in a home series. Boom wasn’t there today but Hardik Pandya stepped and how,” Wasim Jaffer tweeted.

Clear weather is forecasted for this very match and both teams would want to bat first after winning the toss.","pubDate":"2022-07-17 13:41:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG: रविंद्र जडेजा के जाल में फंसे मोईन अली, इस तरह ऋषभ पंत को दे बैठे कैच","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/england-vs-india-3rd-odi-moeen-ali-catch-out-rishabh-pant-ravindra-jadeja-manchester-2170105","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rishabh Pant Ravindra Jadeja India vs England Old Trafford, Manchester:</strong> भारत और इंग्लैंड के बीच वनडे सीरीज का तीसरा और आखिरी मैच मैनचेस्टर के ओल्ड ट्रेफर्ड में खेला जा रहा है. इस मुकाबले में इंग्लैंड की शुरुआत खराब रही. टीम ने शुरुआती दो विकेट 12 रनों के स्कोर पर गंवा दिए. इस दौरान मोईन अली 34 रन बनाकर आउट हुए. रविंद्र जडेजा ने उनका विकेट लिया. जडेजा के इस विकेट की तस्वीरें और वीडियो सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे हैं.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">टॉस हारकर पहले बैटिंग करने उतरी इंग्लैंड टीम के लिए जेसन रॉय और जॉनी बेयरस्टो ओपनिंग करने आए. बेयरस्टो बिना खाता खोले आउट हुए. जबकि रॉय 41 रन बनाकर बनाकर आउट हुए. इंग्लैंड की पारी के दौरान मोईन अली छठे नंबर पर बैटिंग करने आए. इस दौरान वे जडेजा की गेंद पर विकेटकीपर ऋषभ पंत को कैच थमा बैठे. मोईन ने इस पारी में 44 गेंदों का सामना करते हुए दो चौके और दो छक्के लगाए.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">गौरलतलब है कि इंग्लैंड ने भारत को जीत के लिए 260 रनों का लक्ष्य दिया है. टीम के लिए सबसे ज्यादा 60 रन जोस बटलर ने बनाए. उन्होंने 80 गेंदों का सामना करते हुए 3 चौके और 2 छक्के लगाए. वहीं जेसन रॉय ने 31 गेंदों का सामना करते हुए 41 रन बनाए. उनकी इस पारी में 7 चौके शामिल रहे. बेन स्टोक्स ने 27 रनों का योगदान दिया.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A sharp catch behind the stumps from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RishabhPant17?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RishabhPant17</a> as Moeen Ali departs.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/imjadeja?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@imjadeja</a> picks up his first wicket of the game.<br /><br />Live - <a href=\"https://t.co/radUqNrOn1\">https://t.co/radUqNrOn1</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ENGvIND?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ENGvIND</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IHwMcTD3ke\">pic.twitter.com/IHwMcTD3ke</a></p> &mdash; BCCI (@BCCI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BCCI/status/1548644446765518856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 17, 2022</a></blockquote> <p> <script src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>यह भी पढ़ें : <a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-rishabh-pant-praises-by-ashish-nehra-says-big-asset-for-team-india-2170063\">IND vs ENG: आशीष नेहरा ने की ऋषभ पंत की जमकर तारीफ, बताया टीम इंडिया का बड़ा एसेट</a></strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/india-women-vs-pakistan-women-match-time-date-edgbaston-birmingham-commonwealth-games-2022-2170086\"><strong>Commonwealth Games 2022: भारत-पाकिस्तान के बीच होगा मुकाबला, जानें कब और कहां खेला जाएगा मैच</strong></a></p>","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-17 13:35:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Civil Service Cricket Club Belfast pitch report: IRE vs NZ pitch report 1st T20I Belfast","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-civil-service-cricket-club-belfast-pitch-report-ire-vs-nz-pitch-report-1st-t20i-belfast/","keywords":["Cricket","Ireland","New Zealand"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Civil Service Cricket Club Belfast pitch report: The SportsRush brings you the pitch report of the 1st T20I between Ireland and New Zealand.

Ireland will take on New Zealand in the 1st T20I of the 3-match T20I series at the Civil Service Cricket Club in Belfast. Both teams would want to start the series on a winning note. New Zealand whitewashed Ireland in the ODIs, but it was a well-competitive series, where Ireland went unlucky on a few occasions. Both teams have some clinical T20 performers in their ranks, and this can be a great game to watch out for. The pitch at the Civil Service Cricket Club in Belfast has been a track that has been tough for batting in the past. This track offers a visible amount of support to the pacers, and they can certainly hurt the batters in the initial overs of the match. The track provides an extra amount of bounce, which the pacers can use to their advantage. Although, the batters also have something to cheer on from this wicket. The true bounce on the track will allow them to play their shots freely, and the ball will definitely not stay low at this very venue, so they can trust the bounce. This ground’s outfield is very very fast, and once placed in the gap, it will be difficult for the fielders to stop the ball. Heart-break for our lads, but hats off to the @BLACKCAPS for the ODI series win. Martin Guptill was awarded Player of the Match and Multibagger of the Match, while Michael Bracewell was Player of the Series. On we go to the T20I series! #BackingGreen | #Exchange22 ☘️🏏 pic.twitter.com/TrrKugj3R0 — Cricket Ireland (@cricketireland) July 15, 2022 A total of 14 T20Is have been played at this very venue, where 12 matches have been won by the chasing teams and 6 teams have been won by the teams batting first. The average 1st innings score has been 114 runs, which clearly proves that batting has not been that easy on this track. An overcast day is expected in Belfast that will encourage the pace bowlers yet again on this track. Looking at the overhead conditions in mind, both teams would want to bowl first after winning the toss.","pubDate":"2022-07-17 13:26:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IR-W vs AU-W Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for T20I Tri-Series, Match 2","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/ir-w-vs-au-w-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-t20i-tri-series-match-2?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Anjishnu Roy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Ireland Women (IR-W) will take on Australia Women (AU-W) in the second match of the T20I Tri-Series at Bready Cricket Club on Sunday. After defeating England Women in the final of the Women’s T20 World Cup a few months ago, Australia Women have returned to the international scene. They rank first in both ICC Women’s ODI and T2OI charts by a fine margin. This will be their second match of the series as they faced Pakistan Women earlier. However, the match was abandoned due to poor weather conditions on Sunday. Ireland Women, meanwhile, got outplayed by South Africa in their most recent series. They were no match for them and will be hoping to bounce back strongly, especially considering that it’s being played at home.

IR-W vs AU-W, T20I Tri-Series, Match 2 Date and Time: July 17, 2022, 8:30 PM IST Venue: Bready Cricket Club, Bready The Bready Cricket Club track is expected to be slow and bowlers have had the upper hand during the initial stages of the competition. A score of between 120 and 140 could prove to be par at this venue. Wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy is one of the most dangerous wicketkeepers in the world. She is a feared opener who can take the game away with her performance with the bat. She has scored 2136 runs in this format at a strike rate of close to 30. Batters Beth Mooney is a leading figure in the Australian lineup. She is No.1 in the ICC Women’s ODI rankings and also scored an instrumental 62 off 47 in the final of the T20 World Cup against England Women. Mooney has scored 1649 runs in her T20I career. Tahlia McGrath is perhaps the most in-form player from Australia. She had a spectacular World Cup campaign. In her relatively short five-match T20I career so far, she has scored 177 runs at a strike rate of over 156 and is yet to be dismissed. She has also taken three wickets at an average of 15.33. All-rounders Ashleigh Gardner is a top-level performer who has also been in incredible touch in recent months. Having played 52 T20I matches, she has scored 815 runs at a strike rate close to 130. She has also picked up 29 wickets and is a great multiplier pick for your Dream11 Fantasy Team. Irish skipper Laura Delany is full of talent and is a responsible player. She has scored 787 runs and picked up 41 wickets in the T20I format. Bowlers Megan Schutt is the highest-ranked Australian pace bowler and she has taken five wickets in her last four matches. She also scalped two wickets in the final against England Women.
