The 35-year-old, who announced his retirement from international cricket as England's white-ball captain earlier this year, went for a duck in a five-wicket defeat to the Manchester Originals at The Ageas Bowl. Besides competing in this summer's short format competition, Morgan has also spent time working with the Sky Sports Cricket punditry team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I'm not quite sure,\" he said of his plans for the immediate future. \"Tournaments are a long way away next year. \"Obviously finishing this year has reflected really well on me. I've enjoyed retirement a lot, I love the pod, I love golf, I love spending more time with my family, it's been magnificent. \"But who knows next year?\" Morgan did not feature in the IPL earlier this year after being overlooked during the auction following his involvement with the Kolkata Knight Riders last season. Morgan was joining Ian Ward, Chris Jordan and Kevin Pietersen pitchside following his team's defeat to the Originals, who were inspired by a superb 72 from Laurie Evans to kickstart their successful run chase. Pietersen joked he had already made up his mind about his next steps. \"I think he's answered the question about next year,\" laughed the former England batter. \"He's coming to join us in the pod, he'd rather be in the pod than win a game of cricket.\"","pubDate":"2022-09-02 21:20:00","image_url":"https://e1.365dm.com/22/09/1920x1080/skysports-eoin-morgan-the-hundred_5885245.jpg?20220902221017","source_id":"skysports","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúSon who earns the most, gets loved the most‚Äù: Mohammad Hafeez rants against India yet again; reckons BCCI gets motherly treatment solely because of their revenue-generating capacity","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-son-who-earns-the-most-gets-loved-the-most-mohammad-hafeez-rants-against-india-yet-again-reckons-bcci-gets-motherly-treatment-solely-because-of-their-revenue-generating-capacity/","keywords":["Cricket","BCCI","Mohammad Hafeez"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mohammad Hafeez rants against India while claiming BCCI of receiving undue respect only because of their ability to generate revenue.

In a fresh dig taken at the Indian Cricket team and the BCCI in particular, former Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Hafeez has yet again decided to not mince with his words, while taking potshots at the most richest Cricket board this time around. For those unaware, Hafeez had, post India‚Äôs victory against Hong Kong, faced some quite some flak from the India fans, after opining that Rohit Sharma might not be able to sustain himself as team India‚Äôs skipper in the T20 format. During an interaction yet again with PTV Sports, the 41-year-old had the BCCI in the line of fire, claiming that the board‚Äôs ability to generate revenue for the other teams‚Äô boards, despite also managing to rake in their own sponsors during other nation tours, makes them the most loved son of the ICC. The former Pakistani batter, also known as ‚ÄòThe Professor‚Äô amongst his former peers, exclaimed that the Indian Cricket board is like that son, which is loved and pampered no bound because he earns the most. He also added that India is favoured by the ICC not because they play better cricket than the other teams, but solely because they attract them the maximum revenue. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that much, but I know that the son who earns the most in a family gets loved the most, gets kissed all across his face. India is a revenue-generating country and even in any bilateral series across the world, they demand Indian sponsorship, and have it their way. Such aspects cannot be denied,‚Äù exclaimed Hafeez. The anchor then interrupted and asked whether the ICC considers India as favourites because of their performance on the field or because they generate revenue, the 41-year-old remarked ‚Äì ‚Äú Ji, dusri baat .

Wicket-keeper batter Mohammad Rizwan provided a meticulous explanation for Pakistan scoring 64/1 in 10 overs in the sixth match of the ongoing 10th edition of the Asia Cup against Hong Kong tonight. Rizwan, who opened the batting with captain Babar Azam (9), shared an 80-ball 116-run second-wicket partnership with batter Fakhar Zaman to lay a solid foundation for Khusdil Shah (35*) to finish the innings brilliantly to power Pakistan to 193/2 in 20 overs after being asked to bat first by Hong Kong captain Nizakat Khan. However, it was only in the second half of their partnership that both Rizwan and Zaman found boundaries frequently. The first half of the Pakistani innings primarily witnessed them toiling hard on a slow pitch at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. With cross-batted shots not working at all, Rizwan and Zaman decided to play with a straight bat. It was upon getting their eye in that the duo decided to accelerate. Rizwan, who scored 78* (57) at a strike rate of 136.84, won his seventh T20I match award. Zaman, on the other hand, scored 53 (41) at 129.26.

The ball was keeping low. We tried hitting, but it wasn‚Äôt coming off. Then we charged down, keeping in mind the ball was staying low, ‚Äù Rizwan told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony stating how certain situations demand patience even in the shortest format. Highest T20I run-scorer since the start of 2020, Rizwan has amassed 1,603 runs in 34 innings at an average and strike rate of 69.69 and 133.02 respectively. Rizwan, who has hit a century and 14 half-centuries in this period, is followed by Azam (1,300) on the second position but the pair is separated by a massive 303-run difference. Being asked about any key mantra behind his stupendous T20I form, Rizwan thanked god for showering blessings and laid emphasis on reaping fruits of hard work.

While Rizwan had earlier tweeted as well motivating people to donate in a difficult time for the country, the whole Pakistani team had donned black armbands during their match against India on Sunday to show solidarity with the affected people.

Banton looked up from his phone. ‚ÄúYou know, if you close your eyes for long enough, I mean for a really, really long time, you can smell colours . It‚Äôs, like, whoah.‚Äù Jason Roy out of England T20 World Cup squad but Wood and Woakes in Read more Fast forward 17 minutes, through a haze of light, sounds, light, sounds, sounds and sounds, and Banton and Clarke will be back sitting on the same UPVC-mix sport-bench. Clarke was out without scoring. Banton hit one huge six then forgot what he was doing. Welsh would go on to lose by nine wickets, the first in a sequence of eight defeats in eight games. And so a grand scale sporting collapse is set in train. In the course of this 4,000-word deep dive and 12-part companion podcast the Guardian will provide forensic, unseen insight into the unravelling of the men‚Äôs Welsh Fire Hundred franchise season. Fire and Loathing: Two Years of Hurt is an attempt to understand the collapse of a sporting dynasty, the effects on the culture of Fire, the Fire fans, the Fire way of life. How to untangle those deep threads? Was it the random blokes of the Welsh Fire men‚Äôs Hundred team, assembled via bespoke dissociative data algorithms and because some of them were famous? Was the DJ selection process robust? Was the material of the tomato red outfits not stretchy enough, or perhaps too stretchy? Was Gary Kirsten hanging around vaguely with an iPad to blame, or just, like, probably not? Because frankly if it‚Äôs not any of those things, it doesn‚Äôt really leave much to work with. What is certain is that the Fire did lose eight games and did spend ¬£250,000 on two star openers who faced 84 balls combined the whole tournament and averaged 12. And while I would love to read a genuine deep dive into the details, I also make no apology for mocking Welsh Fire Men‚Äôs Hundred team, if only because it doesn‚Äôt really exist. Welsh Fire is still basically just a name, some clothing, some words on the internet. Losing eight from eight is Welsh Fire Men‚Äôs Hundred team‚Äôs most convincing claim to any kind of actual life. Could this be the most grippingly pointless sporting entity ever created in this country? Here we have a losing machine in a space where losing doesn‚Äôt matter, but where it must be broadcast to the nation eight times in 29 days by a cult-like TV commentary crew willing to pretend, energetically, that Welsh Fire losing has any objective meaning. And yes the Hundred has been pretty good over the last month, on its own terms. The women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs finals will be played on Saturday at Lord‚Äôs. The weather looks decent, fingers crossed. The last week has finally brought some close games, although less so in the women‚Äôs draw. On Wednesday the Manchester Originals reached ‚ÄúThe Eliminator‚Äù with a fine last-ball win, which was also fun because it involved Paul Walter and Wayne Madsen thrashing away and the whole thing looking like a good-standard 2017 Blast game with added edgy font and commentators on drugs, which might be a good way to brand this thing for the jaded legacy pound. And so as the competition ends it is standard practice even for the sceptic to see the positives, to say that this is all part of ‚Äúa conversation‚Äù. But I‚Äôm not going to do that here, because I‚Äôve noticed that the more you mention the good things the Hundred can do, the more they seem not just long overdue and self evidently necessary, but problems the England and Wales Cricket Board caused in the first place, and which it is now using to ‚Äúwash‚Äù its money-making venture. Southern Brave celebrate a wicket. The women‚Äôs Hundred has been a success, but so would a women‚Äôs T20 Blast. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images The Hundred is about opening up the sport, we hear, from the people who closed cricket off in the first place, and who have now realised the money is elsewhere. The same body who danced around 20 years of warnings over institutional racism now tells us the Hundred is all about diversity, that this is the most important thing. The same ECB that showed moderate interest in prioritising women‚Äôs cricket now waves the (excellent) women‚Äôs Hundred around as though this has been the whole point all along, like some caddish chief officer on the Titanic piously loading women and children into the lifeboats then leaping in after them.

A women‚Äôs Blast would also have been excellent. Women‚Äôs cricket is good. It needed more and still needs more. The Hundred was not invented to address this, but will scoop it up as more growth, more wallpapering, a way of suggesting, with Putinesque double-speak, that if you‚Äôre against the Hundred you must also be against women‚Äôs cricket, happy children and crisps. Mainly, though, the Hundred is the least good version of a complex activity. There are only two real elements of meaning in team sport: proper rivalries or a genuinely high standard. For all the gushing of TV‚Äôs Eoin Morgan and his fellow double-glazing salespeople, the Hundred has neither of these things. County cricket: Lancashire and Kent reach Royal London Cup final Read more It is instead interchangeable competent people in coloured shirts doing stuff. The alleged razor-sharp high-pressure skills of short-form cricket are often overstated by journalists, broadcasters and coaches with skin in the game. In reality there is little room for depth or other gears. For bowlers five balls is not enough, 10 balls too many. Batting is reduced to hitting, but on pitches that have seemed tired.Is it best just to be honest? This is a property being groomed for sale to private owners, an ECB attempt to retain a commercial foothold at a time when cricket is rapidly becoming a freelance franchise gig. So we get the genuinely weird spectacle of cricket that is by design a kind of saleable noise, Muzak, generic light entertainment; not as a pathway to anything else, but as a lure for TV advertisers and private capital. Let us also be clear that this new form must and will quietly strangle its host, that bed-blocking old parent sport. That there is a choice here, that commerce and income are not the only elements of value. Against all this it is impossible not to love the Welsh Fire men‚Äôs franchise just a little, to respect its complete inability to function as a competitive entity, if only as a note of gallows humour, a clutch of the dying hand, and as something that does still genuinely feel like sport.","pubDate":"2022-09-02 18:19:57","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b5a451a44a2bf21a1c459f45b288c293f66ab1f/1_0_2558_1535/master/2558.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d96e480ed1783253bbf7f57ad0786caf","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Paul Green‚Äôs death prompts a cricket legend to open up about mental health strategies","link":"https://thewest.com.au/opinion/justin-langer-what-we-can-all-learn-from-paul-greens-tragic-death-c-8101996","keywords":null,"creator":["Justin Langer"],"video_url":null,"description":"‚ÄòJustin, if you knew the demons going on within my brother‚Äôs mind, dying may well have been the best thing for him.‚Äô These words shocked me, but they were my initiation into the world of mental illness.","content":"‚ÄúJustin, if you knew the demons going on within my brother‚Äôs mind, dying may well have been the best thing for him.‚Äù These words shocked me at the time, but in many ways, they were my initiation into the world of mental illness. A world I had no real comprehension of until that confronting confession above from a sad sibling telling me the truth of a schoolmate of mine who had taken his own life. A friend I mistakenly thought I knew quite well. Also, a mate I had no idea was suffering so badly. Paul Green, a legend of rugby league, succumbed to a similar fate in Brisbane a fortnight ago. His death has again shone a light on mental health and illness in our country. His funeral on Tuesday looked heartbreaking. By chance, I was invited last week, to speak at a luncheon for the inspirational charity Zero2Hero. In preparation for my presentation, I met with founder and CEO Ashlee Harrison. I had known of Ashlee when she was awarded young West Australian of the Year in 2016 for her commitment to youth suicide and metal health, through Zero2Hero. Ashlee told me: ‚ÄúPrevention is more effective than cure. Like with any health issue, treating an illness at the beginning ‚Äî or better preventing it from even occurring ‚Äî provides a far greater opportunity for health, wellbeing and success. ‚ÄúTo prevent skin cancer, we go for a skin check and slip, slop, slap. To prevent cavities, we regularly go for dental check-ups, brush our teach and avoid sugar. To prevent prostate or breast cancer we attend check-ups when we reach the risk age bracket. ‚ÄúMental illness should be treated the same, regular check-ups or check ins, making decisions that support our mental health and treating an illness proactively when or if it arises.‚Äù The statistics are sobering. Suicide remains the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15-44. It‚Äôs estimated that more than 65,000 Aussies attempt suicide each year. Tragically, 480 young people in Australia took their lives in 2020. Almost nine Australians die every day by suicide. All this in the ‚Äòlucky‚Äô country we live in. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. In my speech at the luncheon, I described my lack of authority to discuss mental illness. I‚Äôm not a doctor, psychiatrist or psychologist. But I am a person, just like you, who hits a hurdle every now and then. It‚Äôs part of life as a human being. So, instead, I talked about my strategies for maintaining mental health. Learning these strategies comes from wearing a number of different hats over the years. For example, living in a world of professional sport where winning is demanded came with immense internal and external pressure. Being a dad to four daughters, where the perils of social media and perfectionism are tangible. Where bullying is rife. And cruel. Where so many kids simply feel like they can‚Äôt escape. It must be very lonely. In this world where there is so much focus on mental health, maybe the best prevention is to be kind and gentle on ourselves. And as a head coach, where I was blown away by the number of young men who have cried in my office as they describe the pressure they‚Äôre feeling. Most think they are supposed to be living the dream? Back in 2009, the year after I retired from playing cricket, I remember having a discussion at the Coogee Bay Hotel in Sydney with a great young mate and cricket prodigy, Robbie Baker. I distinctly remember him saying to me: ‚ÄúI just wish I was as mentally tough as you were JL.‚Äù Just as clearly I remember putting down my glass of red wine and fighting back every single instinct to give my friend a hug, and telling him: ‚ÄúIf only you knew mate.‚Äù Robbie, a handsome, talented, terrific young bloke, had suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome for years. With such a long illness came the natural bouts of depression and anxiety. Recently, he opened up in an excellent and comprehensive article for Cricket Australia. In it, he talked about whether life was even worth living during that debilitating time. Chatting with him again this week, Robbie told me how he has learnt that, ‚Äúwe often neglect the person in the quest for perfection and performance. Mental toughness in professional sport was defined as striving, working harder, focusing and achieving anything you put your mind to. But, there is so much more to it than just that‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure this can be the same in the corporate world. Bottom lines. Climbing the corporate ladder. Strive, strive, strive. But at the expense of what? So back to my ‚Äúif only you knew mate‚Äù moment at the Coogee Bay Hotel. Justin Langer Justin Langer What I‚Äôve learnt is that we are all human. Even the best of us have our doubts, insecurities, fears, anxieties and worries. How do I know I this? Because, I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes. The greats and the highest achievers ‚Äî who wear a mask or often pull on an armour ‚Äî are as human and susceptible as anyone. I also know it because I have lived with it all my adult life. The mask. The armour. Without my strategies, those two critical friends simply hide the underbelly of fear and insecurity. So, what have I learnt? In 1992, Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson starred in the movie, White Men Can‚Äôt Jump. My take on this title is, Aussie Men Don‚Äôt Talk. Thinking you can go it alone and bottle up your thoughts and emotions is like poisoning your system. Dealing with your own mental health is incredibly complex but here are a five of many strategies that have helped me through the journey. Firstly, for the men out there: talk, talk, talk. Whether with your mates, your family or a specialist, talking is like spewing out cancer. For some this might be uncomfortable, but the sooner you can get comfortable being uncomfortable the freer you will feel. That‚Äôs my experience anyway. In 2001, having been dropped from the Australian team in England, I did what a lot of Aussie blokes would do. Work. Strive. Practise more. Try harder. Introvert. Retract from the tribe ‚Äî in my case the team. The result? Consistent failures, miserable experiences and eventually a blow-up. After another failure, I walked into the change room, grabbed Adam Gilchrist ‚Äî one of my best mates ‚Äî by the scruff of the neck and said: ‚ÄúLook what you guys have done to me!‚Äù Of course, they hadn‚Äôt done anything to me, I had brought it all on myself, I just needed someone to blame. Gilly was the vice-captain and one of the selectors on the tour, so he became the target. A few hours later, Gilly and the coach John Buchanan dragged me into the hotel bar. For the next three hours I drank beer and talked. What a magical therapy. When we had finished John gave me a hug. More magic. Ten days later later I opened the batting for Australia for the first time. The rest is history. A miracle really considering the hole I was in just a week-and-a-half before. The lesson? Talk, talk, talk. Let it out. If you think you can go it alone, think again. Strategy number two. Be clear in your purpose. I believe you should be able to write your purpose on the palm of your hand. This can change. Nothing is permanent in this life. But the philosophy is sound. When I was a player, my purpose was to be the best player I could be. Simple. Get balanced in my stance and watch the ball like a hawk. This inspired me every day to get better. It also helped me stay focussed though the inevitable tough times. While coaching the Australian cricket team my purpose was to make Australians proud of the team. Simple. Again, this inspired me every day and helped me through the toughest times. Be clear in your purpose. Keep it simple, and make sure it is what inspires you and makes you happy. Thirdly, learn to meditate. In 1993, veteran New Zealand opening batsman John Wright sat next to me in a change room. With a stubbie of beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, he said: ‚ÄúI have been watching you young man. You need to learn relax. You‚Äôre too serious and you‚Äôre trying way to hard. I recommend you learn transcendental meditation.‚Äù Justin Langer ‚ÄúTranscendental what?‚Äù I replied, nearly falling off my chair. A few weeks later, having been dropped for the 1993 Ashes series, I read in the West Australian newspaper an advertisement saying. ‚ÄúLearn Transcendental Meditation.‚Äù The universe speaking? I drove to Smyth Road, Claremont and a man named Dereck taught me how to meditate. I have meditated every day since. It‚Äôs hard to intellectualise what it does. But it has certainly been a game-changer in my life. Strategy number four: Be disciplined with social media. When it gets out of balance and becomes an addiction, you‚Äôve got a problem. Succinctly, you don‚Äôt need strangers telling you how good you are. More importantly, you don‚Äôt need them telling you how bad you are. Let your loved ones do that. They‚Äôre the ones that really matter. And, finally, laugh a lot. Surround yourself with people who make you laugh. Laughter is like medicine. It is also the music of all the great environments I have been a part of in my life. I always knew if I was happy off the field, I was usually successful on it. In this world where there is so much focus on mental health, maybe the best prevention is to be kind and gentle on ourselves, while teaching our kids simple and effective coping strategies to live a free and happy life.

During the Eliminator of The Hundred 2022 Women‚Äôs Competition between Southern Brave and Trent Rockets in Southampton, Southern Brave beat Trent Rockets by 2 runs to cement their position in the final. Having finished at the second spot on the points table, Brave will now face table-toppers Oval Invincibles in the final at Lord‚Äôs tomorrow. Brave vs Rockets ended up being an absolute thriller of a contest. Chasing a 135-run target, Rockets needed 47 runs off 20 balls to qualify for the final. All-rounder Nat Sciver hit a six and two fours in the next two sets to reduce the equation to needing 28 runs from 10 deliveries. Knowing that the advantage was with the hosts, Sciver didn‚Äôt give up on putting on display a miraculous batting effort to seal a chase. Facing Brave all-rounder Tahlia McGrath, the 30-year old player was eventually required to score 24 runs off five balls. ALSO READ: Is Tahlia McGrath related to Glenn McGrath? What followed was one of the best batting displays in Women‚Äôs Cricket as Sciver hit three consecutive sixes to bring down the equation to four runs off the last ball. Sciver, who could score just a run on the final ball, missed out on a victory but ended up earning applause from the cricketing fraternity for scoring 72* (36) at a strike rate of 200 with the help of five fours and sixes each. South Africa and Invincibles all-rounder Marizanne Kapp took to social media platform Twitter to express admiration for Sciver. Set to play the final on Saturday, Kapp was generous enough to write that she would happily exchange places with Sciver believing her to be a deserving candidate to play the final match of this tournament.

Bairstow sustained a lower limb injury in a freak accident whilst playing golf on Friday in Leeds. He will see a specialist next week to ascertain the full extent of the injury, according to a press release from England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). England are currently playing a three-match Test series at home against South Africa. The series is tied at 1-1 ahead of the final game, which is going to begin next Thursday (Sept. 8). Nottinghamshire batsman Ben Duckett has been added to England's squad ahead of the third Test at Kennington Oval, London. The release further stated that Bairstow's replacement for the T20 World Cup will be announced in due course. The ICC event is scheduled to begin on Oct. 16 in Australia and will go on till Nov. 13. Bairstow took to social media on Friday and revealed that he would have to undergo surgery to treat the injury. \"Unfortunately I am going to be unavailable for all games/ tours in the immediate future. The reason being is that I have injured my lower leg in a freak accident and it shall need an operation. The injury came when I slipped on the golf course this morning. I am gutted and want to wish everyone for this week at The Oval all the best firstly the boys that are going to Australia for the T20 World Cup. Absolutely gutted! I will be back, wrote Bairstow in an Instagram post. A post shared by Jonny Bairstow (@jbairstow21) Bairstow's injury has come as a big blow for the 2009 T20 World Cup champions as the wicketkeeper-batsman has been in fine form this year across formats. He scored 90, 30, and 27 in the three T20Is against South Africa recently, but had not replicated the same form in the Test series with scores of 0, 18, and 49 in the three innings he had batted in. While it is still not clear how long Bairstow will be out, he will miss the entire English summer. He is the leading run-scorer in Tests this year, with 1,061 runs at an average of 66.31. He has recorded six centuries and a fifty in 19 innings in the longest format for England. Bairstow played a significant role in England chasing down 270-plus totals in the three Tests against New Zealand at home recently. Since making his T20I debut in 2011, Bairstow has scored 1,337 runs at a strike rate of 136.42, which includes eight fifties. You can't keep this guy down üò§ He'll be back. pic.twitter.com/TXVmoldTaB Overall in T20s, Bairstow has amassed 4,304 runs in 180 games at an average of 30.52 and strike rate of 138.08, including three centuries and 25 fifties. Earlier today, the ECB announced England's 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup. England's T20 World Cup squad: Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood Travelling Reserves: Liam Dawson, Richard Gleeson, Tymal Mills","pubDate":"2022-09-02 16:34:11","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/09/02/500x300_1310556-jonny-bairstow.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bairstow Golf freak accident: Who has replaced Jonny Bairstow in England T20 World Cup 2022 squad?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-bairstow-golf-freak-accident-who-has-replaced-jonny-bairstow-in-england-t20-world-cup-2022-squad/","keywords":["Cricket","Ben Duckett","England","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","Jonny Bairstow"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bairstow Golf freak accident: The star English batter won‚Äôt be taking part in ICC T20 World Cup 2022 in Australia.

The hapless development involving Bairstow has come merely hours after he was named in England‚Äôs 15-member squad for the World Cup in Australia next month. 2022, 12th year of Bairstow‚Äôs international career, has seen him scoring 1,344 runs in 27 innings across formats at an average of 56 and including six centuries and three half-centuries.

Bairstow Golf freak accident For the unversed, Bairstow has suffered a lower limb injury. The most unfortunate part is that the 32-year old player didn‚Äôt injure himself on a cricket ground. It was during Bairstow‚Äôs recreational golf session this morning that he slipped on the golf course to do harm to his ‚Äúlower leg‚Äù. Bairstow took to his social media platforms to both provide details about a freak accident and express shock around missing a World Cup in one of his best years as an international cricket. Who has replaced Jonny Bairstow in England T20 World Cup 2022 squad? As far as the imminent third England vs South Africa Test match at The Oval is concerned, batter Ben Duckett has replaced Bairstow in a 14-member squad. Duckett, 27, had played the last of his eight international matches across formats over three years ago. As far as the last of his four Tests is concerned, the left-handed batter had taken the field during England‚Äôs tour of India 2016. On the other hand, England are yet to name Bairstow‚Äôs replacement for the T20 World Cup. ‚ÄúA further announcement will be made in due course on who will replace Bairstow in England‚Äôs ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup squad.‚Äù ECB (England Cricket Board) said in a statement. However, it is worth mentioning that former England batter and current managing director of men‚Äôs cricket and interim chair of selectors Rob Key had recently disclosed that Bairstow is being considered to open alongside captain Jos Buttler during the World Cup. With Jason Roy dropped from the T20I squad, the move made quite a lot of sense. While there‚Äôs no dearth of in-form top-order batters in England, Bairstow‚Äôs injury could end up becoming a boon for Alex Hales. A bona fide opener, Hales hasn‚Äôt any played international match since England‚Äôs tour of West Indies 2019. Left out of the squad before the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 due to a non-cricketing reason, Hales deserves a comeback for all that he has done in T20 leagues around the world in this period. Since his last match for England, Hales has amassed 4,599 runs in 155 T20 innings at an average and strike rate of 32.62 and 152.89 respectively to be the highest run-scorer in the format.

Stokes has a surprisingly poor T20 record for England and has never scored a half-century in 34 games and taken just 19 wickets. But Key believes his soaring form and confidence after his stunning Test performances as batsman, bowler and captain can translate to the shorter format. Key said: ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt quite found Ben‚Äôs best role in T20s and I‚Äôd like to get him up the order. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a great line in his documentary where they say ‚Äòbig moments find him‚Äô and you want to give him the opportunity.

The reason being that I have injured my lower leg in a freak accident and it shall need an operation. The injury came when I slipped on the golf course this morning. Jonny Bairstow Key explained: ‚ÄúAlex rang me and I much prefer when people pick up the phone and ask why they‚Äôre not in a squad ‚Äì as opposed to those who go behind the scenes moaning.

The MCC's 12-member World Cricket Committee, which is headed by Mike Gatting and also has BCCI president Sourav Ganguly , made the observations following a research into how much time was lost on each day's play during New Zealand's three Tests in England in June. Making their suggestions to the ICC, the MCC on Friday said in a statement: \"In general, ICC playing regulations be reviewed to tighten the parameters around when substitutes are permitted onto the field of play i.e. with gloves, drinks etc. Going into details, it said: \"the fielding team should immediately return to their positions, ready to bowl the next delivery\" when a decision is reviewed. \"Batters should also remain in the proximity and prepare to recommence play. No drinks should be brought onto the field. If the decision is overturned to Out, the fielding side will still have time to celebrate,\" it said. It further urged the umpires and match referees to be \"more proactive at speeding up play and enforcing Laws 41.9 and 41.10, which provide a warning for the first offence, followed by the award of Penalty runs for deliberate slow play.\" One of the \"key findings\" of the research during the New Zealand Test was approximately \"64 minutes\" were lost during the series to the DRS. Giving a break-up, it says: \"Player discussions where no review was taken - 6 minutes; Player reviews - 47 minutes; and Umpire reviews - 11 minutes.\" \"It took an average of 25 seconds for the fielding side to be ready to bowl the next ball after the DRS had confirmed an umpire's Not out decision.\" \"On average, four minutes were lost on each day's play for DRS reviews. Ball checks and changes averaged between two and four minutes per day of lost time. \"Batters changing gloves or 12th Men bringing on helmets resulted in lots of delays. Such changes caused delays of around two and a half minutes each day in Tests, which was 90 seconds more than in County Championship cricket.\" Chairman of the MCC World Cricket committee Gatting said they have been concerned about declining over rates for some years. \"We note that the ICC has enacted quite strong penalties for captains and teams, but it does not appear to have had the desired impact as over rates are consistently slow and decreasing,\" he said. Promoted \"We have little doubt that there are a number of areas where time can be saved, without adversely affecting the quality of play... \"We hope that by eradicating some of the reasons as to why over rates are slow, that we will encourage audiences, improve the look of the game and increase the profile of Test cricket on a global basis,\" Gatting said.","pubDate":"2022-09-02 14:23:06","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-05/cpgs7hpg_icc-logo_625x300_27_May_20.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England name 15-man squad for T20 World Cup; Jason Roy misses out","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/england-name-15-man-squad-for-t20-world-cup-jason-roy-misses-out-760151","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"T20 World Cup is due to take place in Australia from OctoberEngland are yet to win a T20I series this yearJos Buttler will lead England in the T20 World Cup","content":"England name 15-man squad for T20 World Cup; Jason Roy misses outEngland name 15-man squad for T20 World Cup; Jason Roy misses outEngland have named their 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup in Australia, starting in October.

Seam bowlers Chris Woakes and Mark Wood have recovered from their respective injuries and have been named in both squads for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup and the IT20 tour of Pakistan in September, according to an official release from England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Both players last played for England during the Test tour of the West Indies back in March. One of the notable absentees from the side was Jason Roy.

Here is a look at the cricket stadiums to host the most international matches: 280 - Sharjah Cricket Stadium (UAE): An ODI paradise right from the 1980s to early 2000, the Sharjah Cricket Stadium has stood witness to several epochal moments in cricket history. The stadium in the United Arab Emirates has hosted 244 ODIs, nine Tests and 27* T20Is (280* international matches overall). Test cricket entered late, in 2002, but the one-dayers would lit up the ground. The first match hosted by the ground was the inaugural match of the first Asia Cup in 1984 between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs famous ‚ÄòDesert Storm‚Äô knock against Australia in 1998, the famous Miandad last-ball six against India in the 1986 Austral-Asia cup final and the 1985 India vs Pakistan Rothmans Cup match were a few iconic matches that happened here. Tendulkar holds the record for most ODI hundreds (7) at this venue alongside Pakistan‚Äôs Saeed Anwar. 280 - Sydney Cricket Ground (Australia): Sydney has hosted 280 international matches; 110 Tests, 159 ODIs and 11 T20Is. The first Test match at the SCG was held in 1882. Billy Murdoch‚Äôs Australia beat England by five wickets. In 1979, the first ODI at this venue, involving England again, had ended in no result. The SCG will next play host as a major venue during the ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup 2022. 279 - Melbourne Cricket Ground (Australia): The colossal ‚ÄòMCG‚Äô stadium in Australia has hosted 279 international matches till now; 114 Tests, 149 ODIs and 15 T20Is. The first Test match at the MCG was in 1877. Dave Gregory‚Äôs Australia beat England by 45 runs. In 1971, the stadium had its first taste of limited-overs cricket. Even this time, the Englishmen were at the receiving end. Under the leadership of Bill Lawry, Australia beat England by five wickets. In 2015, Australia beat New Zealand at this ground to lift the Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup for the fifth time. In 2020, the Australian women‚Äôs team beat India in the final to win the 2020 Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup. 237 - Harare Sports Club (Zimbabwe): Zimbabwe may not presently be a successful cricket team but HSC remains a busy park for the sport. The first Test match, between Zimbabwe and India in 1992, was a drawn affair. Sanjay Manjrekar and Dave Houghton had scored hundreds. The only ODI of the same tour, also the first one here, was won by India. Harare has hosted 237 international matches: 163 ODIs, 39 Tests and 35 T20Is. 221 - Lord‚Äôs Cricket Ground (London): In the fourth position with 221 international matches ‚Äî 143 Tests, 68 ODIs and 10 T20Is ‚Äî Lord‚Äôs is mostly known for Test cricket. Lord Harris‚Äô England beat Australia by an innings and five runs in the first-ever Test match in 1884. The first ODI, in 1972, was won by Australia. Eleven years later, India won its maiden ODI World Cup here under the leadership of Kapil Dev. Former captain Sourav Ganguly also has a history with the ground. He scored a hundred on his Test debut in 1996 and six years later, took his shirt off at the royal balcony to celebrate India‚Äôs win in the Natwest series. In 2019, England lifted its maiden ODI World Cup at the ‚ÄòHome of Cricket.‚Äô Read more stories on Cricket.","pubDate":"2022-09-02 11:02:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
