The imminent intriguing fifth day of the first Test of the ongoing Pakistan‚Äôs tour of Sri Lanka in Galle will not just be another Test match day but has the potential of being a historic one due to the current match situation. Chasing a mammoth 342-run target, Pakistan need 120 runs in 90 overs with seven wickets in hand to win this match. Other than just providing them with an unassailable 1-0 lead in a two-match series, a victory will also witness Pakistan registering their second-highest Test run-chase and the highest-ever at the Galle International Stadium . Set to resume proceedings in less than eight hours from now, Pakistan opening batter Abdullah Shafique and vice-captain Mohammad Rizwan will walk out to bat with a phenomenal victory in sight. With the advantage resting with Pakistan, all Shafique and Rizwan have to ensure is that they don‚Äôt be part of a batting collapse in the first session of Day 5. üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúI know the job is not done yet‚Äù @imabd28 opens up on his gritty fourth-innings üíØ today and his partnership with @babarazam258 üëè #SLvPAK | #BackTheBoysInGreen pic.twitter.com/UGReLRzO7Z ‚Äî Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) July 19, 2022 Given the number of runs left to decide the winner of this match, the team which will dominate the morning session should also be able stage a victory. Much like Day 4, weather forecast in Galle comprises of quite some chances of rainfall on Day 5 as well. While Tuesday managed to remain rain-free despite the weather prediction, all the stakeholders would be hoping for Wednesday to also evade rain. Having said that, an interruption or two would still not be able to prevent Sri Lanka and Pakistan from finding a result as the same could be decided in just over a session today. As far as the weather forecast according to AccuWeather is concerned, Day 5 will be a hot (28-30 degree) and humid (78%) day encompassing of a cloud cover of as high as 97%. Talking about the rain probability, it will range between 34% ‚Äì 57% throughout the playing hours. A highest of 57% rain probability right at the start of the day could see an initial delay. However, the same will fall to 34% by the scheduled start of the afternoon session on the final day of this Test.

During the first ODI of the ongoing South Africa‚Äôs tour of England in Chester-le-Street, South Africa batter Rassie van der Dussen continued his supreme form in this format by bringing up a third century. Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the seventh over, van der Dussen marked his presence in the middle for 39.3 overs by scoring 134 (117) with the help of 10 fours. van der Dussen, who batted at a strike rate of 114.52 without hitting a six, played an exemplary knock highlighting how attack can be done without playing risk-involving shots. Having hit the first of his 10 fours via a reverse sweep off England all-rounder Moeen Ali on the 16th ball that he faced, the right-hand batter targeted another spinner in Adil Rashid to play another successful reverse sweep. van der Dussen, who completed a half-century by running a single off Rashid in the 23rd over, reached the three-figure mark via a boundary off England all-rounder Sam Curran in the 39th over.

Having announced his decision to retire from the format on Monday, it was South Africa‚Äôs part-time off-spinner Aiden Markram who dismissed the local boy from Durham for the one final time in the format. Stokes arrived at this difficult decision with a long-term view to sustain himself for as long as possible in the Test format, after being appointed England‚Äôs full-time Test skipper around three months ago. While announcing his decision, he also expressed his inability to give his 100% to his teammates in the format due to the jam-packed international schedule, something which has now become a topic of intense debate and discussion with respect to players‚Äô well-being and sustenance.

Thus, with the T20 World Cup in Australia just three months away, Stokes will be available for selection in the England team squad. Will Ben Stokes play IPL 2023? The decision has also meant that Stokes might well also be available to participate in IPL 2023. Currently not part of any of the ten IPL franchises, it remains to be seen if he would be drafted into any of the squads, or a mini auction would take place for him along with the rest of the players available for selection, although the likelihood of the latter happening is highly unlikely. It is worth of a mention that Stokes had opted his name out of IPL 2022 this year owing to his decision to prioritize Test Cricket, after England were handed a 0-4 drubbing by Australia in the Ashes Test series.

Kohli is enduring a wretched run with the bat and has failed to score a century since November 2019. He could manage just 76 runs from six innings across formats on the England soil, which included the rescheduled fifth Test, two ODIs and as many T20s. ‚ÄúIf I had about 20 minutes with him, I would be able to tell him the things he might have to do. It might help him, I am not saying it will help him but it could, particularly with regards to that off-stump line,‚Äù Gavaskar told ‚ÄòIndia Today‚Äô. ‚ÄúHaving been an opening batter, having been troubled by that line, there are certain things that you try and do.‚Äù Kohli‚Äôs lean patch has led to calls for his ouster from the T20 World Cup team, with even the legendary Kapil Dev voicing support for his exclusion. However, many former and current cricketers, including Babar Azam, Kevin Pietersen and Shoaib Akhtar have backed him to come good in the upcoming games. ‚ÄúIt goes back to the fact that his first mistake turns out to be his last. Again, just because he is not amongst the runs, there is this anxiety to play at every delivery because that is what batters feel, they have got to score,‚Äù Gavaskar said. ‚ÄúYou look to play at deliveries that you otherwise won‚Äôt. But he has gotten out to good deliveries as well on this particular tour.‚Äù Kohli has been rested for the limited-overs series against West Indies which includes five T20Is and three ODIs. Gavaskar also praised Rishabh Pant for batting responsibly in the third ODI against England. ‚ÄúRishabh Pant seems to have learned from his mistakes against South Africa. He chased balls outside off stump to slog them over the leg side then, but the way he batted with responsibility yesterday shows how well he paced his innings,‚Äù the 73-year-old said. ‚ÄúThe way he smashed a flurry of boundaries towards the end showed that he is someone who can absorb pressure and then attack. We will need to wait and see (whether Pant is able to replicate this form in T20Is). He might have found the right template to play white ball cricket.‚Äù Pant smashed a maiden ODI century against England at Old Trafford in Manchester to help India seal the three-game series 2-1. ‚ÄîPTI ¬† ¬† Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-07-19 18:42:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cheteshwar Pujara hits hundred as Sussex captain against Middlesex at Lord's Cricket Ground","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/cheteshwar-pujara-hits-hundred-as-sussex-captain-against-middlesex-at-lord-s-cricket-ground-1977576-2022-07-19?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pujara hits hundred as Sussex captain against Middlesex at Lord's","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-19 17:53:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI 2022: Rahul Dravid features in Shikhar Dhawan's viral video as Team India arrive in the Caribbean - Watch","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-wi-2022-rahul-dravid-features-in-shikhar-dhawans-viral-video-as-team-india-arrive-in-the-caribbean-watch-2487372.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"This was the first time that cricket fans got to see Dravid having fun after his 'Indira Nagar Ka Gunda' advertisement.","content":"Team India's stand-in captain for the ODI series against West Indies, Shikhar Dhawan loves posting funny videos and photos on social media.

Rahul Dravid's side is enjoying a fine run in white-ball cricket as they claimed 2-1 victories in both T20I and ODI series on English soil.","pubDate":"2022-07-19 17:48:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄòHad lot more ODI fuel left‚Äô: Yuvraj Singh on Ben Stokes retirement - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9oYWQtbG90LW1vcmUtb2RpLWZ1ZWwtbGVmdC15dXZyYWotc2luZ2gtZmVlbHMtYmVuLXN0b2tlcy1yZXRpcmVkLXRvby1zb29uLXJlc2VydmVzLXNwZWNpYWwtcHJhaXNlLWZvci1hbGxyb3VuZGVyLTEwMTY1ODI0OTE4Mzg2MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"‚ÄòHad lot more ODI fuel left‚Äô: Yuvraj Singh on Ben Stokes retirement¬†¬†Hindustan Times\"This England shirt deserves 100% of whoever wears it' Ben Stokes on his ODI retirement¬†¬†Sky Sports CricketWe are not cars, you can't just fill us up - Ben Stokes | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzBen Stokes gives an elaborate and stunning reply to Virat Kohli's comment on his retirement post on Instagram¬†¬†Hindustan TimesExpresso National and International Cricket News Update at 1:30 pm on 19th July 2022¬†¬†The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-19 17:41:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England legend Kevin Pietersen hits out at ECB after Ben Stokes' ODI retirement","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/england-ben-stokes-kevin-pietersen-27523721","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Matthew Cooper)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Stokes has announced his retirement from ODI cricket and Kevin Pietersen has weighed in, having stepped away from white-ball cricket in 2012 for similar reasons","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-19 17:36:59","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26834617.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS213232221.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sky Sports Commentators 2022: ENG vs SA ODI commentators list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sky-sports-commentators-2022-eng-vs-sa-odi-commentators-list/","keywords":["Cricket","Sky Sports","South Africa tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sky Sports Commentators 2022: The Sportsush presents the commentary panel of ongoing England versus South Africa ODI series.

During the ongoing first ODI of South Africa‚Äôs tour of England at the Riverside Ground in Chester-Le-Street, South Africa have posted their highest-ever score in One-Dayers versus England in their own backyard. A fine century from Rassie Van der Dussen (133 off 117), and half-century knocks from Janneman Malan (57 off 77) and Aiden Markram (77 off 61), meant that the Proteas powered their way through to post 333/5 on the scoreboard. It is worth of a mention that a 151-run partnership off mere 122 deliveries for the third wicket between Markram and van der Dussen laid the foundation for a score in excess of 300, with the English bowlers found struggling in what is one of the hottest days in the city today. Also, the partnership is the highest-ever for the third wicket at the Chester-Le-Street. In reply, at the time of writing, England have got off to a cautious start, having posted 47 on the board without any loss after the end of the mandatory powerplay. Sky Sports Commentators 2022 England fast-bowler Mark Wood, who today confirmed to undergo a second operation on his right elbow, after picking a five-fer for his club Ashington Cricket Club on Saturday, has joined the star-studded Sky Sports commentary panel for the ongoing ODI series between the two sides. Having garnered praises from fans in social media already for his commentary skills, he has been spoken highly of in particular for the game analysis alongside Shaun Pollock, during the ongoing first ODI. Apart from Wood and Shaun Pollock, the Sky Sports commentary panel for the ENG versus SA ODI series includes Mark Butcher, Nick Knight, Kumar Sangakkara and Nasser Hussain. ‚ÄúWhen does a niggle become so bad that you have to say I can‚Äôt bowl anymore?‚Äù Nasser Hussain and Mark Wood take a look at the difference in Ben Stokes‚Äô bowling from now to when fully fit a few years ago. pic.twitter.com/8oeY6sXUtp ‚Äî Sky Sports Cricket (@SkyCricket) July 19, 2022 For more Cricket-related news, click here.

Ireland and New Zealand will be up against each other in the 2nd T20I of the 3-match series at the Civil Service Cricket Ground in Belfast. The visitors would want to win the series, whereas the hosts would want to level it. The all-rounders of New Zealand are in great form, whereas the batting of Martin Guptill has also been a bonus for the side. For Ireland, Harry Tector and Paul Stirling have been their best batters, whereas Mark Adair and Josh Little have been their best pacers. Civil Service Cricket Club Belfast pitch report 2nd T20 The track at the Civil Service Cricket Club in Belfast has been a competitive track, and it has support for both batters and bowlers. This ground has always offered a bit of help for the pacers, as they have been able to swing the ball in the initial overs of the game. There is an extra bounce on the wicket which helps the short ball ploy. The batters also enjoy batting on this surface as they are able to trust the bounce in the wicket, and they can play their shots easily. There is a very fast outfield at this venue, so once placed in the gap, the ball races away for the fence. Even the boundaries at this stadium are not that big, and the batters can clear the ropes easily. Some photos of the crowd enjoying the game yesterday in glorious sunshine. Thanks everybody for coming out to support the lads. #BackingGreen | #EXCHANGE22 | #ABDIndiaSterlingReserve pic.twitter.com/9unlTkmg7L ‚Äî Cricket Ireland (@cricketireland) July 19, 2022 A total of 19 T20Is have been played at this very venue, where 12 matches have been won by the chasing teams and 7 teams have been won by the teams batting first. The average 1st innings score has been 117 runs, which clearly proves that batting has not been that easy on this track. The Kiwi batters batted beautifully in the last match, and the pacers of both sides loved bowling at the surface. We can expect the wicket to behave in a similar manner in this match as well.

FirstCricket Staff July 19th, 2022 22:19:54 IST File image of Hardik Pandya. Sportzpics India all-rounder Hardik Pandya had requested Team India trainer Shankar Basu to get him through the 2019 World Cup amidst injury and body fatigue. Pandya had struggled with a troubled back and was out of action for a significant time after the 2019 World Cup. He also had his role reduced as a bowler. Under the circumstances, India‚Äôs strength and conditioning coach Shankar Basu was the one who helped him. In a conversation with Ranveer Allahbadia on the latter's YouTube channel BeerBiceps, Basu opened up about his conversation with Pandya. \"Hardik is a great guy. I remember the 2019 World Cup, it was post-IPL and he was sore, having played a lot of matches. He said to me 'Sir, please get me through this World Cup. I need to be fit'. And I got him through,‚Äù Basu said. He also said that Pandya is an easy guy to work with as he obeys the instructor without any doubts or questions. ‚ÄúIt is easy to work with him. He will be convinced to do whatever you want him to do. Obviously, the demand of an all-rounder is very different ‚Äî understanding the body and all.\" Basu highlighted that since Pandya has not played a significant amount of junior or domestic cricket, he was prone to injury. \"He had not played much of junior cricket. Suddenly, he has been catapulted to the international level, and the loads are much higher. He has to do it day in and day out. He is getting used to it now. Of course, fast bowlers and all-rounders are going to get injured every now and then. That is part and parcel of the game,\" Basu explained. Pandya came back to the international arena full throttle after the IPL 2022. He also led Gujarat Titans to their maiden IPL title in their debut season itself. Since then, Pandya has made some brilliant performances for India and also won the Player of the Series award in the three-match ODI tournament against England.

Although Ten Hag will be reunited with his former Ajax star Lisandro Martinez, the 52-year-old has retained the England international as the club‚Äôs first team captain and Maguire could well play alongside the Argentina international.

South Africa elected to bat after winning the toss and made the most of what is likely to be a deteriorating pitch under the baking sun, with Van der Dussen scoring his third ODI century and putting on a record third-wicket stand for the tourists against England of 151 with Aiden Markram (77). The pair worked the ball around on the large playing surface and put South Africa in a strong position to win the first of three matches in the series, which is also a farewell for England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who is retiring from ODI cricket after the game. Opener Janneman Malan scored a fine 57 to get the innings off to a good start following the early loss of Quinton de Kock (19). England toiled in the field with debutant seam bowler Matthew Potts manging only four overs (0-33) before he retreated to the dressing room after feeling the effects of the conditions. Stokes also battled as he recorded figures of 0-44 in five overs, with the pick of the bowlers Moeen Ali with his 1-47 in eight. Spinner Liam Livingston took 2-29 in four overs as he removed both Markram and Van der Dussen within three balls as the pair tried to up the tempo on a wicket that got more difficult to score off as the innings wore on.
