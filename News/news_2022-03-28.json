The second day of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) witnessed two absolute cracker of high-scoring games during the first double header fixture of the edition. During the day fixture, Mumbai Indians (MI) took on the Delhi Capitals (DC) at the Brabourne Stadium. While during the evening fixture, the Punjab Kings (PBKS) locked horns against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) at the DY Patil Stadium, as all the four teams played their respective opening matches of the season. During the day match, DC’s Rishabh Pant won the Toss and elected to field first only to be on the back foot quite early into the match courtesy of a 67-run stand for the opening wicket between MI skipper Rohit Sharma (41 off 32) and Ishan Kishan (81 off 48). The bowling attack, led by Khaleel Ahmed (4-0-27-2) and Kuldeep Yadav (4-0-18-3) pulled things back brilliantly though to restrict their score to 177/5 after their 20 Overs. During the second match of the day, it was PBKS’ Mayank Agarwal who won the Toss and elected to bowl first as well. In contrast to the match earlier, the Punjab bowlers did manage to put a leash on the RCB openers in skipper Faf du Plessis and Anuj Rawat, with their scorecard reading mere 78/1 in 11 Overs. But, du Plessis (88 off 57) then took the 5th gear, and stitched a 118-run partnership alongside Virat Kohli (41 off 29) for the second wicket to score 127 runs in the next nine Overs, including the contribution in the form of a wonderful cameo by Dinesh Karthik (32* off 14) during the death Overs, as RCB posted a massive 205/2 in the 20 Overs. Yesterday IPL match result Delhi Capitals (DC) vs Mumbai Indians (MI) Chasing 177, and despite an aggressive start by Tim Seifert (21 off 14) during the first half of the Powerplay, Delhi lost their three top order batters, including skipper Rishabh Pant (1 off 2) with 46 runs on the board after the end of the Powerplay. Mumbai bowlers continued to chip in with wickets regularly, to reduce DC to 104/6 during the 14th Over. However, the middle-orders batters in Lalit Yadav (48* off 38) and Axar Patel (38* off 17) had other ideas as they stitched a 30-ball 75 runs partnership for the 7th wicket, including a 24-run Over bowled by Daniel Sams (18th Over) to snatch victory from MI’s jaws by 4 wickets with as many as 10 deliveries to spare.

Adds that the ball was swinging in the first innings but they went through is very pleasing for them. New captain, same old woes for Bangalore. They scored 205 runs and thought they had done a good job at the interval but the experienced pair of David Willey and Mohammed Siraj didn't provide a good start in the Powerplay, with Siraj being taken to the cleaners. Even the other star bowlers in the side, Wanindu Hasaranga and Harshal Patel went for runs at an alarming rate. Mohammed Siraj then came in and got a double breakthrough but turned villain quickly as he went for 25 in his final over, leaving nothing to defend in the last two overs. An important dropped catch from Anuj Rawat who was having a ball in the field also proved to be costly as Smith did hit a few lusty blows. Bangalore will now look to pull up their socks and bounce back with a win. Punjab needed a good start and skipper Mayank Agarwal along with Shikhar Dhawan provided just that as they raced to 50 within no time. Mayank fell but then came in a surprise package in the form of Bhanuka Rajapaksa who took the game by the scruff of the neck and didn't allow the opposition bowlers to settle. Along with Dhawan, Rajapaksa took Punjab to comfort but then the wickets started tumbling. Raj Bawa got out for a golden duck but they kept on playing their shots. Liam Livingstone hit a couple of big sixes and then at the death, Shahrukh Khan just stayed at the crease and allowed Odean Smith to pummel the bowlers and seal the win. What a remarkable chase this has been from Punjab and they have chased down a score of 200 plus with an over to spare! Shades of David Miller's heroics against Bangalore in 2013 but this time it has been a team effort from Punjab. They have truly deserved the win and after having all the depth in the bowling department, it's the same old story for Bangalore, they just can't defend scores. This is also Punjab's highest successful run chase in the Indian T20 League. 18.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Khan hits the winning runs! What a partnership this was! Fullish and on off. Khan muscles it past the bowler and to long off for a boundary. Punjab win by 5 wickets. 18.5 overs (0 Run) A yorker, around off. Khan shuffles across and digs it out back to Patel. 18.4 overs (0 Run) Full and wide, Shahrukh Khan looks to cover drive but the balls sneaks under the willow. 18.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Easy pickings! An off cutter, full and on off. Khan waits,waits and waits as he thumps it over long off for a biggie. 18.2 overs (0 Run) Bangs a bouncer and on middle. Khan misses his pull. 18.2 overs (1 Run) Wide! Yet another extra! This is on a length and outside off. Another wide. 18.1 overs (2 Runs) Fuller ball, on off, slower. Khan pushes it to deep covers for a couple of runs. 17.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! It is his power, just sheer power! Short ball, on off. Smith rides the bounce and tonks it well over long off for a maximum. 11 runs needed in 12 balls. 17.5 overs (1 Run) Leg bye! Full and angling on the pads. Khan misses his heave. A leg bye as it goes off the pads to point. Faf du Plessis seems out of sorts here and is having a discussion with the bowler after every single ball. The fielders are being chopped and changed and they are trying to work out a plan to save the boundary. 17.4 overs (1 Run) Shorter and on off. Smith thumps it to long off for a run. 17.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Smith showing his power! This is on a length and outside off. Smith hangs back and again shows his power over covers for a biggie. 17.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! A length ball, angling on the pads. Smith wrists it to square leg and beats the fielder there for a boundary. 11 run off the first three balls. 17.2 overs (1 Run) Wide! Too many extras from Bangalore! Full ball, way outside off, over the tramline. Smith swings and misses. 17.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Perfect start! A length ball, outside off. Smith powers it flat and over sweeper cover for a biggie. 16.6 overs (2 Runs) This is full and on off. Khan tries to go over long off but does not power it much. David Willey is in two minds, to catch it on a bounce or go for it. He takes it on a bounce and keeps it down to two. An eventful over from Harshal Patel. Mohammed Siraj (3-0-35-2) to bowl out here. 16.6 overs (1 Run) Wide! Full ball, way outside off. Khan leaves it. 16.5 overs (0 Run) A full toss, outside off. Khan hits it straight to covers. Smith wanted a single and he committed himself. Khan says no. He rushed back and a sloppy throw just help him to get back with a dive. 16.5 overs (1 Run) Wide! Way outside off. A wide given. 16.4 overs (1 Run) DROPPED! Anuj Rawat the culprit! A length ball, outside off. Smith powers it to deep cover but Anuj Rawat is stationed there, he runs to his right and drops a regulation catch. Will this prove costly? 16.3 overs (1 Run) Fullish and on off. Khan squeezes it out to deep cover for a single. Singles won't do for Punjab. 16.2 overs (0 Run) A full toss, outside off. Khan swings in the air and connects thin air. 16.2 overs (1 Run) Wide! Keeps it away from the arc, over the tramline. Left alone. 16.1 overs (1 Run) A pace off delivery, fuller and on off. Smith pushes it to mid off for a single. 15.6 overs (0 Run) Tossed up, on off, pushed back to Hasaranga. 15.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Much needed! A full ball on off. Khan gets low and hammers it to long off for a biggie. 15.4 overs (0 Run) Shorter and quicker and around off. Khan guides it to point. Superb from Hasaranga. 15.3 overs (0 Run) Tossed up, full and on off. Khan leans and keeps it out. 15.2 overs (0 Run) Fuller this time, on middle. Khan defends it out. 15.1 overs (0 Run) A googly, short and outside off. Khan chops it to point.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637840193787561370.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies vs England, 3rd Test: Windies crush Joe Root and Co to win series 1-0","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/west-indies-vs-england-3rd-test-windies-crush-joe-root-and-co-to-win-series-1-0-2448579.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies crushed England by 10 wickets in the third and final cricket test on Sunday to win the series 1-0.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-27 17:37:00","full_description":"West Indies crushed England by 10 wickets in the third and final cricket test on Sunday to win the series 1-0. The hosts needed only 4.5 overs on Day 4 for their batters to reach the winning target in Grenada. West Indies finished on 28-0 in the second innings after earlier dismissing England for 120. West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite was 20 not out and John Campbell undefeated on 6. When England resumed on 103-8, it was already on the brink of defeat with a lead of only 10 runs with just two wickets in hand in its second innings. Victory for @windiescricket _ West Indies complete a ten-wicket win to take the Test and the series _ #WTC23 | #WIvENG | https://t.co/8vvmZqjdsh pic.twitter.com/KRe5N0TUzT — ICC (@ICC) March 27, 2022 The visitors lasted another 11 overs in the opening session with Kemar Roach (2-10 off 9.2 overs) taking both England wickets ? Chris Woakes (19) and Jack Leach (4). It took almost 45 minutes for West Indies to break up England's ninth-wicket partnership, with a stunning reaction catch from Jason Holder doing the job. Woakes middled Roach's first ball as it went down the leg side and Holder flung out a hand and plucked the ball out of the air at leg gully. No. 11 Saqib Mahmood, who hit a defiant 49 in the first innings, was 3 not out. West Indies medium-pacer Kyle Mayers started the day with an incredible 5-9 from 13 overs, a maiden five-for, but went for five in his first over on Sunday and finished with 5-18 from 17 overs. The batting allrounder was unwanted for the first two tests ? both draws ? and he replaced spinner Veerasammy Permaul with the aim of strengthening the batting. The result means England's failure to win a test series in the Caribbean in 18 years carries on. It is likely to extend the debate over Joe Root's suitability as captain, despite his superb batting form with two centuries in the series. After England's latest defeat, and a 4-0 Ashes humiliation in Australia, Root indicated he still wants to stay on as captain. \"I think I made it quite clear at the start of this game and throughout this tour I'm very passionate about trying to take this team forward,\" Root told BT Sport. \"I will control what I can. I don't think it's ever in your hands. I feel like the group are very much behind me, we're doing a lot of really good things and we just need to turn that into results now.? West Indies enjoyed its first test series win at home since 2019. That was when England last visited. West Indies had an intimidating 93-run lead on the first innings after making England bat.","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women's World Cup: 'Everything should come to an end,' Mithali hints at retirement as India crash out","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/womens-world-cup-everything-should-come-to-an-end-mithali-hints-at-retirement-as-india-crash-out-735323","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"The game against SA was a must-win for IndiaSA defeated India by 3 wickets in a last-over thrillerMithali and Smriti scored a half-century each in the first innings","content":"Mithali RajMithali RajIndia's legendary cricketer Mithali Raj has hinted at retirement following her side's elimination from the Women's World Cup on Sunday.India Women were left heartbroken after they lost a last-over thriller in their final group game of the World Cup at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch.

Anuj Rawat with another catch in the match and his efforts in the field are making a difference here. Full and wide, Liam Livingstone throws his hands at it.

Two in two for Mohammed Siraj and Raj Bawa marks his Indian T20 League debut with a golden duck. Siraj bowls a low full toss, curving into the pads and that's not an easy delivery to put away first ball. Bawa misses the flick and gets pinged on the pads. Siraj appeals and the finger is raised. Punjab lose another wicket and Siraj is on a hat-trick. What a quick turn of events this has been! Raj Bawa comes out. 13.1 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN!

Agarwal gets low to pull and he hits it flat to Shahbaz Ahmed who is standing inside the ring at square leg, takes a sharp catch. Finally, Bangalore find the breakthrough.

The wicket is a belter but the bowling has been ordinary from Bangalore, especially given the likes of David Willey and Mohammed Siraj being experienced campaigners. Punjab need more than a strong start to win and Bangalore will feel that a couple of wickets will bring down the scoring rate quite a fair bit. Also, Akash Deep comes into the attack now. 5.6 overs (0 Run) Follows Mayank on the leg side with a flatter ball. Agarwal cuts it straight to point. 5.5 overs (0 Run) Shorter and angling on off, Agarwal punches it to covers. Dhawan wanted a single but was sent back wisely. 5.4 overs (1 Run) On middle, swept to short fine leg for a single. 5.3 overs (0 Run) A flatter ball, angling down, was slower through the air.

Dinesh Karthik charges there and puts a dive but fails to hold onto it, was a hard one though. 5.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Good start to the over! A full ball, on off. Dhawan skips down and tonks it towards long on for a boundary. The boundary just landed inches before the ropes and hence a boundary. 5.1 overs (1 Run) Very full and on off, drilled down to long on for a single.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637840165339206908.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, PBKS vs RCB Live Score: Shikhar Dhawan, Bhanuka Rajapaksa Keep PBKS Ticking After RCB Snag Mayank Agarwal - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2lwbC0yMDIyLXBia3MtdnMtcmNiLW1hdGNoLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0yODQ2MjM30gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vaXBsLTIwMjIvaXBsLTIwMjItcGJrcy12cy1yY2ItbWF0Y2gtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTI4NDYyMzcvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, PBKS vs RCB Live Score: Shikhar Dhawan, Bhanuka Rajapaksa Keep PBKS Ticking After RCB Snag Mayank Agarwal  NDTV SportsPBKS vs RCB, IPL 2022 stats: Head-to-head record, players to watch out for  SportstarMatch Preview - RCB vs Punjab Kings, Indian Premier League 2022, 3rd Match  ESPNcricinfoLive Cricket Score: PBKS vs RCB, Match 3, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzPBKS vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2022: Hasaranga strikes first-ball to break threatening opening stand  Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-27 16:50:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Punjab Kings vs Royal Challengers Bangalore: IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/punjab-kings-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-live-score-over-match-3-t20-1-5-updates-2846582","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Punjab Kings vs Royal Challengers Bangalore from Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy, Navi Mumbai.

Shikhar Dhawan makes room and slices it over point for another boundary. 4.5 overs (0 Run) Half a chance for stumping but Dinesh Karthik spills it. Willey hits the length hard and bowls it around off. Shikhar Dhawan advances but misses the ball. The ball bounces a bit extra and DK has almost no time to react. 4.4 overs (0 Run) Just a touch fuller, on off. The ball skids on and Dhawan keeps it out. 4.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Cheeky from Shikhar Dhawan and the fifty is up for Punjab in no time. A length ball, well outside off. Dhawan shuffles, gets down on one knee and ramps it over the keeper for a boundary. 4.2 overs (1 Run) On middle, worked onto the leg side for a single. 4.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! This is banged in short and outside off. Mayank Agarwal goes for the uppercut and manages to clear the point fence with ease. He looks in solid form here. 3.6 overs (1 Run) On off and angling in. Agarwal bunts it out towards mid on for one. 14 off Siraj's second over. 3.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Mohammed Siraj is being taken to the cleaners here. Around the hips, Agarwal half-pulls it over backward square leg for another boundary. 3.4 overs (0 Run) Around the top of off at 142.7 kph. Agarwal hangs back to defend. 3.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Clean strike from Mayank Agarwal! Right in the slot on off stump. Agarwal smokes it right back over the bowler's head for a biggie. 3.2 overs (2 Runs) Siraj goes full and on middle and leg. Mayank Agarwal launches the ball without much timing but is able to clear mid on and mid-wicket. They race back for two. 3.1 overs (1 Run) On a good length, over off stump. Dhawan drops it onto the off side and picks up a run. 2.6 overs (1 Run) Around the top of off, Shikhar Dhawan comes down the track again and nudges it towards mid off. He sets off for a quick single and makes it in time. 2.5 overs (1 Run) Short ball, on the body. Agarwal mistimes the pull shot. The ball goes aerially towards the vacant mid-wicket region and they get a single. 2.4 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, Dhawan walks towards the ball and pulls it down to mid-wicket for a run. 2.3 overs (2 Runs) Pitched up, around off. Dhawan lofts it with the swing and just about manages to clear the man at covers. They race back for two though, good running. 2.2 overs (1 Run) Short of a length, around off. Agarwal goes up and over point and picks up a single. 2.1 overs (0 Run) Full and straight, flicked away towards mid-wicket. 1.6 overs (1 Run) Around the top of off, tapped towards covers for a quick run. 15 off the over and Punjab off to a flier. 1.6 overs (5 Runs) FIVE WIDES! This is a disastrous start from Mohammed Siraj with the new ball. Tries to angle it into the pads but spills it down leg. The ball zips through and DK can't get to it. The ball runs away into the fine leg fence. 1.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! This is pushed fuller and around off from Siraj. Mayank Agarwal throws his hands at it and looks to go over extra cover but ends up slashing it behind point for a boundary. 1.4 overs (0 Run) Around off, pushed towards the cover region. 1.3 overs (0 Run) Beaten! A length ball, tight on the off stump and just shaping away a bit. Agarwal looks to steer it towards third man but gets beaten past the outside edge. 1.3 overs (5 Runs) FIVE WIDES! Mohammed Siraj tries to be a bit too aggressive and bangs it in high and wide, down the leg side. The ball races away to the fence and Punjab get five free runs. 1.2 overs (0 Run) Mayank Agarwal makes room leg side and Siraj follows him with a 140 kph full delivery. Agarwal misses the swing. 1.1 overs (0 Run) Length, over middle. Agarwal tucks it away leg side. Who will bowl from the other end? It is Mohammed Siraj. 0.6 over (4 Runs) FOUR! Bit of width on offer and Shikhar Dhawan pounces on it. Dhawan advances down the track and hammers it through the cover region for the first boundary of the innings. 0.5 over (1 Run) Good-length, over middle and shaping into Mayank Agarwal who manages to da it down towards backward point for a quick single. 0.4 over (1 Run) A length ball, around middle. Dhawan walks towards the ball and flicks it towards deep mid-wicket for a single. He is underway as well. 0.3 over (0 Run) Again some swing on offer for Willey. Even fuller this time, close to the off stump and shaping away. Dhawan plays inside the line of the ball. 0.2 over (0 Run) Lovely shape from David Willey! Pitched up a bit, around off and shaping away. Shikhar Dhawan lets it through to the keeper. 0.1 over (1 Run) Mayank Agarwal and Punjab are off the mark straightaway. Willey starts off with a length ball, wide of off stump. Agarwal slaps it towards deep point for a single.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637840147028755971.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Root should resign but finding his England replacement is not easy | Vic Marks","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/joe-root-should-resign-finding-england-replacement-west-indies-cricket","keywords":["England in West Indies 2022","England cricket team","West Indies cricket team","Joe Root","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Vic Marks"],"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies series defeat could be final straw for Root and now England must be more flexible in approach to captaincyThis is the sort of crisis we like, one we can revel in, a sporting calamity but no more than that.

Lives have not been ruined. No one has died. The options ahead, though hard to unravel, are not terrifying. Three months ago, England’s cricket team was thrashed by a good Australian side and as a consequence the managing director and coach was sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board’s Red Adair, Andrew Strauss, who belied his reputation for rock-solid pragmatism by sending the side off to the Caribbean without some of their best players – just to see what happened. Now England have lost humiliatingly to West Indies, a moderate, spirited side nowhere near as good as Australia. Something must be done to hasten “the red-ball reset”. Fresh cliches may be required. So we can all leap on our bandwagons. This means I can rail against the myopic structure of English domestic cricket, which has the prime cricketing months of the summer being devoted to two types of short-form cricket. Why should the next generation of cricketers be bothered with this archaic red-ball game? The money is elsewhere. The advent of the Hundred is symbolic of a sleepwalk to decline; it may be a godsend for women’s cricket but the death knell for the men’s game. Others may use England’s demise this winter as confirmation of a county structure that’s not fit for purpose. Why not be radical and abolish them all? Use the Hundred model to create some red-ball franchises in the urban centres and bugger Bognor, or Hove, or Taunton or Chelmsford or Worcester. And what about our battters? They can only score runs on featherbeds and how can they possibly prosper when they never encounter genuine pacemen in county cricket? Except that they have been humiliated this winter by Scott Boland and Kyle Mayers, both of whom display the qualities of the archetypal English seamers, who are just gearing up for action this April? So let’s not pretend there are any simple solutions. There will be calls for more change. Someone else has to go and the only one left in the firing line is captain Joe Root – even though we currently have no idea who has the job of sacking him if he does not walk away of his own accord. Ben Stokes, age 30 Why? Vice-captain, heartbeat of the team, powerful personality. Steered a motley crew to a 3-0 triumph in the one‑day series against Pakistan last summer. Why not? Already has his hands full as an all‑rounder, can be combustible, and said in January that he did not want the job. Stuart Broad, age 35 Why? Vast experience, sharp cricket brain, the most articulate man in the room. As Pat Cummins is proving with Australia, fast bowlers can run the show. Has had some practice after leading England’s T20 team for three years. Why not? Sometimes hot-headed, reliably bad at reviews, too old to play every game – and now a rabbit with the bat. Eoin Morgan, age 35 Why? Simply the best. In Top Trumps: England Men’s Captains , he would score higher for authority, vision and composure than anyone since Mike Brearley. Has already rebuilt one England squad, transforming them from zeroes to World Cup heroes. Test record middling, but no worse than most England batters. Bound to be the boss one day, may as well start now. Why not? Out of form, has become injury-prone. James Vince, age 31 Why? Sharpest captain on the county circuit. Has transferred his gifts from Hampshire to Southern Brave, with whom he won the Hundred. Fine fielder, getting better as an England batter – averaging 40 since last June. Why not? Maddening inability to bring the best out of himself. Specialises in sparkling scores of 15-20, which consist of four dreamy strokes and a waft to second slip. Liam Livingstone, age 28 Why? He’s a star. Has presence and acumen, captained Lancashire at 24. Superb fielder, sparky sixth bowler, first-class average of 38. Why not? Yet to play a Test. Born big hitter, not an easy role to play when carrying the burdens of office. More credible as the captain after next. Sam Billings, age 30 Why? Four years of experience as captain of Kent, plus one in the Hundred with Oval Invincibles. Fields well, can keep wicket, has a good temperament. Personable and articulate. Why not? Jack of all trades, master of none. Has still played just the one Test – at Hobart in January, as the understudy’s understudy. Joe Root is personable too, and look where that got us. Tim de Lisle More agonising about Root’s captaincy is faintly preposterous since he has been in charge for longer than any other Englishman in history, 64 Tests, of which 27 have been won and 26 lost. After all those Tests you would have thought the debate about Root was over. He is not the worst captain we have ever had. Nor the best. He is a thoroughly decent, well-respected leader, genuinely devoted to the game and, by a terrifying margin, England’s best batter. But that does not mean that he should carry on regardless. He will probably go now; he probably should. It is not all his fault. His side has been about three Test batters short. He has done his time in charge and at the moment it is not working. He could even come back in a few years’ time. Maybe we should view the captaincy differently. In recent times it has become a presidential term. With a few failed interlopers, the England captaincy has passed from Atherton to Hussain to Vaughan to Strauss to Cook and then to Root in roughly four-year cycles as if it is the holy grail, which dare not be disturbed. It does not have to be like that. There is no harm in letting someone else have a go. In cricket the captain is a deliciously important post but there is still scope for a bit of experimentation. It is tempting to be mesmerised by the mystique of the great captain, which is mostly Mike Brearley’s fault. In fact his period in charge was a consequence of a freakish set of circumstances involving two larger than life characters – Kerry Packer and Ian Botham. Post-Brearley, the armchair experts like to seek a repeat performance in times of crisis. Today that may result in suggesting the elevation of Eoin Morgan, who last played a game of cricket with a red ball in April 2019. That is the solution of diehard adherents to the captaincy mystique. I’m not even sure that Morgan should still be captaining our white-ball sides as his performances dip. Australia sometimes show the way – by accident. Before the Ashes, out went Tim Paine out of the blue. In came Pat Cummins, an exceptional man and an exceptional cricketer but with no experience of captaincy. And he’s been very good. Arguably a distinct improvement. Admittedly England do not possess such an obvious candidate within their current team, leading us to the traditional old English way, which sends us around the counties in pursuit of “leadership” qualities. This takes us to the likes of Rory Burns, James Vince, Tom Abell, Sam Billings, Tom Westley and Will Rhodes. Ho hum. So, what of recent members of the England set-up? After a traumatic year or more even Ben Stokes may be uncertain whether the job suits him at the moment. More importantly, alongside Root, he has to be one of the the pillars of the England team in 2022. Indeed we may have to think in terms only of the next series rather than the next four years. So who could we put in charge for the three Tests against New Zealand. Stuart Broad? Possibly. One other suggestion from an armchair: Jos Buttler. I did tell you there are no simple solutions.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d9a76d425b951cfe97f1c655ea929b47a48b35/0_80_2426_1456/master/2426.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ddb4d74fb3265ce621d21ab1d50129b","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why du Plessis wear pink gloves: Faf du Plessis highest score in IPL","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-why-du-plessis-wear-pink-gloves-faf-du-plessis-highest-score-in-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Punjab Kings","RCB","Faf Du Plessis","Indian Premier League","PBKS","Royal Challengers Bangalore"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Faf du Plessis highest score: The former South African captain has kick-started his Royal Challengers Bangalore career with a half-century.

During the third match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Dr DY Patil Cricket Academy, Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Faf du Plessis scored his 23rd half-century in the tournament in his first match for the franchise. Opening the batting with another debutant in Anuj Rawat (21), du Plessis looked out of touch for a large part of his knock tonight. With RCB scoring 70/1 at the halfway mark, du Plessis had scored just 17 (30) to puzzle one and all. However, an instantaneous change of gears led to du Plessis entering a six-hitting spree to end up with 88 (57) with the help of three fours and seven sixes. While batters usually slow down during the middle overs, du Plessis put on display a contrasting approach hitting a four and five sixes within a nine-ball span. Having punished Punjab Kings all-rounder Odean Smith and Harpreet Brar initially, du Plessis then attacked pacer Arshdeep Singh hitting him for a couple of sixes in the 16th over.

THE CHASE.... Punjab started nicely but once Bangalore found their foot, they were toying with the field. The bowlers started nicely but as the game went through, they started to fade away. Too many looseners and freebies were hit to cleaners. Sharukh Khan dropped Faf du Plessis on 7 and that proved very costly. Only Rahul Chahar ended with the economy under 6 and that tells you the story. The pitch looks like it loves batters and Punjab have a few big guns as well. They need to take the game till the deep if they want to start the season on a high. An exciting second session coming up... A South African putting a big stand with Kohli! Yeah...We have seen that before. AB de Villiers will be proud of it. It was Rawat who gave a good start while Faf du Plessis was struggling but once the former got out. Kohli and Faf started to find the gaps and rotate the scores quite quickly. Faf du Plessis struggled earlier but once he found his groove, the bowlers started to struggle and it was raining sixes and fours. Kohli was playing the second fiddle and enjoying the show. After doing the damage, Karthik came in and played a superb cameo to post a score above 200. First game for Bangalore and they start with a bang. 200 plus scores to start the campaign and they will be very happy going into the break. A slow start but a demolishing finish, started from Faf du Plessis and ended with Dinesh Karthik. 19.6 overs (1 Run) Bye! Just a bye to end a brilliant display of batting from Bangalore. Dinesh Karthik shuffles across the off stump again and Sandeep Sharma follows him with a full and wide one. The ball is beyond the tramline but the line moves with the batter's movement. DK misses the heave leg side and Bhanuka Rajapaksa does well to get a glove on it. Bangalore finish with 205/2! 19.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Slog-sweep off a seamer and DK has gone berzerk! Full and angled across off stump. Karthik picks it up and shuffles across the stumps to heave it into the cow corner fence. 19.4 overs (0 Run) Dot ball! Sharma comes 'round the wicket and nails the yorker, going across the off stump. Karthik looks to jam it out on the off side but gets beaten. 19.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Out comes the lap shot! Full and wide, DK gets inside the line of the ball and lifts it over short fine leg for a boundary. The 200 is up for Bangalore. 19.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! All the way! A good-length ball, outside off. Dinesh Karthik hangs back and punches it over the extra cover fence for a biggie. 19.1 overs (1 Run) This is dug in short and over off. Virat Kohli pulls it down towards deep mid-wicket for a single. Sandeep Sharma to bowl the final over. 18.6 overs (0 Run) A rare dot ball to end the over. Dinesh Karthik pre-meditates and shuffles way across his stumps. Smith follows him with a full ball and Karthik misses the scoop shot. 18.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! It's carnage out there from DK! Pitched up on off. Karthik picks up the slower ball and thumps it right back over the bowler's head for a biggie. Odean Smith brings up his half-century as well. 18.4 overs (1 Run) Shorter in length, on the body. Kohli pulls it behind square on the leg side for a single. 18.3 overs (1 Run) Leg bye! Fuller in length, angled into leg stump. Karthik misses the heave leg side and the ball rolls off the pads towards covers. They get a leg bye. 18.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Now Smith bangs it in halfway down the track and this is pummeled away. Over middle, sets up nicely for the batter. Dinesh Karthik pulls it into the mid-wicket fence. 18.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! It's been a forgetful debut for Odean Smith. This is angling down leg with fine leg inside the ring. Karthik picks it up and dispatches it over the fine leg fence for a maximum. Odean Smith to bowl the penultimate over. 17.6 overs (1 Run) A diving effort but it's out of reach. A short ball, at the body. Karthik looks to pull but mistimes it just over the fielder at square leg and picks up a single. Just 3 runs and a wicket off Arshdeep Singh's final over. 17.5 overs (0 Run) Arshdeep Singh bowls another slower bouncer, this is way outside off and almost never arrives. Dinesh Karthik goes fetching but can only manage to edge it down towards short third man. 17.4 overs (0 Run) Full and curving into off stump. Karthik can only jam it back towards the bowler. 17.3 overs (1 Run) Slower bouncer from Singh, around off. Kohli pulls it down well in front of square on the leg side for a run. 17.2 overs (1 Run) A full toss, on off and dipping on the batter. Karthik eases it down to long on for one. Dinesh Karthik is the new man in. 17.1 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Shahrukh Khan with a sensational catch and Faf du Plessis has to depart. Arshdeep Singh changes the angle of attack as he comes from 'round the wicket. This is fuller and angling in from outside off. The bat twists in Faf's hands as he tries to clear long off and ends up chipping it well in front. Khan races in and dives forward to pouch it just before the ball hits the turf. Khan has made up for his dropped catch but du Plessis has done a lot of damage. End of a fabulous knock from the Bangalore skipper. 16.6 overs (2 Runs) A low full toss, sliding into the pads. Virat Kohli clips it behind square on the leg side for a couple of runs. 16.5 overs (1 Run) Very full again, at the toes. This is jammed out on the leg side for a single. 16.4 overs (1 Run) Full and straight, driven down to long off for one more. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Nails the yorker this time does Sandeep Sharma. Faf keeps it out back onto the deck but they still manage to scamper through for one. 16.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Full and wide, Faf creams it with exquisite timing over extra cover for a boundary. 16.1 overs (1 Run) Sharma pushes it wide, Kohli advances but has to adjust and works it towards long off for a single.

If they are to go into the semi-finals, India need a win. If they lose to an in-form South Africa side, they will be out of the competition. It has been a rather up-and-down campaign for India in the tournament. In one match, they are a winning side but in the very next game, they end up as the losing team. Sample this: against West Indies, they made 317 and won by 144 runs. In the very next match against defending champions England, they were all out for 134 and lost by four wickets. In India's batting at the World Cup, losing wickets in clusters has become a regular occurrence. Against Pakistan, they were 114/6 before Sneh Rana and Pooja Vastrakar saved the day with a 122-run partnership. When facing New Zealand, they were 95/5 and eventually lost by 62 runs. India was 78/3 against the West Indies before Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur slammed centuries. When facing England, India were tottering at 86/7 and were bowled out for 134. Against Australia, they lost two wickets within the first 10 overs and two in successive overs in the last ten stage. When facing Bangladesh, India slipped from 74/0 to 74/3 and were 108/4 before Yastika Bhatia and Sneh Rana staged a rescue act. \"With such a very crucial game tomorrow, everyone in the team knows their roles. All in the team are ready to give their 100 percent. Whenever someone goes out to bat, we always think of creating partnerships and take others along with you and back each other all the time in batting. I just hope that we get good partnerships tomorrow as a batting unit. Our bowling and fielding units have also got a lot better. We have been improving as a team,\" were Shafali Verma's words on batting improvements in the pre-match virtual press conference. Shafali, out of the eleven after scoring a duck against Pakistan, came back against Australia and showed glimpses of shrugging her poor form by making a stroke-filled 42 against Bangladesh. Smriti Mandhana has looked good at the crease but will want to bat for long. Yastika Bhatia has been a solid performer for India, notching up half-centuries at three. Ideally, India would like for runs to flow from Mithali Raj's bat. The skipper, one of the most experienced players in the side, hasn't been at her best self with the bat, barring the half-century against Australia. Her deputy, Harmanpreet Kaur, has been consistent with the bat and with Pooja Vastrakar and Sneh Rana, has been leading India's charge with the final ten overs. Their bowling attack, which took a beating against Australia, bounced back strongly against Bangladesh. But India might be tempted to bring in pacer Meghna Singh for leg-spinner Poonam Yadav due to the Hagley Oval's nature of helping the fast bowlers. They will also be buoyed by the fact that South Africa haven't been at their best while batting against spin, something which all-rounder Chloe Tryon touched upon.

Currently, India are on six points, with three wins and as many losses while South Africa are already into the semi-finals. If they are to go into the semi-finals, India need a win. If they lose to an in-form South Africa side, they will be out of the competition. It has been a rather up-and-down campaign for India in the tournament. In one match, they are a winning side but in the very next game, they end up as the losing team. Sample this: against West Indies, they made 317 and won by 144 runs. In the very next match against defending champions England, they were all out for 134 and lost by four wickets. In India's batting at the World Cup, losing wickets in clusters has become a regular occurrence. Against Pakistan, they were 114/6 before Sneh Rana and Pooja Vastrakar saved the day with a 122-run partnership. When facing New Zealand, they were 95/5 and eventually lost by 62 runs. India was 78/3 against the West Indies before Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur slammed centuries. When facing England, India were tottering at 86/7 and were bowled out for 134. Against Australia, they lost two wickets within the first 10 overs and two in successive overs in the last ten stage. When facing Bangladesh, India slipped from 74/0 to 74/3 and were 108/4 before Yastika Bhatia and Sneh Rana staged a rescue act. \"With such a very crucial game tomorrow, everyone in the team knows their roles.

Livingstone sprints to his left and dives in to save two runs for his team. 4.2 overs (1 Run) WIDE! Faf du Plessis tries to be cheeky and Arshdeep Singh tries to outsmart him. Faf shuffles right across his stumps. Singh goes chasing after him but pushes it beyond the tramline. 4.1 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, around off.

At this level that should have been taken! Just short of a length, on middle. Faf du Plessis doesn't move his feet and just pulls it straight towards Shahrukh Khan at short mid-wicket.

Faf du Plessis and Anuj Rawat are the openers for Bangalore tonight and they take guard. Sandeep Sharma has the new ball in hand and he will be looking for some swing early on. Let's go... We are minutes away from the start of this match but in the first match of Super Sunday, Delhi have managed to notch up a victory out of nowhere against Mumbai. It required a special batting effort from Axar Patel and Lalit Yadav to guide Delhi to a win in their opening fixture. Bangalore (Playing XI) - Faf du Plessis (C), Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Virat Kohli, David Willey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep. Punjab (Playing XI) - Mayank Agarwal (C), Shikhar Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Bhanuka Rajapaksa (WK), Odean Smith, Shahrukh Khan, Raj Bawa, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Brar, Sandeep Sharma, Rahul Chahar. TOSS - Up goes the coin and it lands in the favour of Punjab. They will BOWL first! Punjab on the other hand have shuffled things around with changes right on the top. A new season with a new skipper and they look balanced on the paper. They have the likes of Liam Livingstone and Odean Smith in the middle with Kagiso Rabada leading the bowling troops. Rabada though will miss the opening fixture. Which new captain will lead his troops to the safer shores first? We will find out soon. Toss and teams coming up shortly. ‘Ee sala cup namde' which means, this time the cup is ours. For yet another season, Bangalore fans will chant wholeheartedly, with a promise that the franchise will live up to the expectations, this time with a new leader at the helm. In the previous edition, they made it to the Eliminator but were knocked out by Kolkata. So they will hope to make the next big step this season and go a couple of steps further. The Indian T20 League is up and running and the third match of the season sees Punjab take on Bangalore. Both the teams have new leaders for the new season. Virat Kohli announced last year that he will step down as the Bangalore skipper so it will be Faf du Plessis leading the side while Punjab will rely on prolific opener Mayank Agarwal to lead them. ...

The second game of the double-header between Punjab and Bangalore is underway so you can switch the tabs and join us there. From here, it is goodbye! Kuldeep Yadav is adjudged as the Player of the Match. Delhi were three down inside the Powerplay but it was their deep batting that helped them. Once, Rovman Powell fell it looked like they will come second best here but the cameo from Shardul Thakur and the 75-run partnership between Lalit Yadav and Axar Patel proved to be the winning stand and they won the game with 10 balls to spare. Yadav was going run-a-ball at one time but he played an anchor role throughout and then launched big when it mattered. A superb win for Delhi and they are off to a fantastic start. Mumbai didn't have the best of starts as both the openers had a go against them but Murugan Ashwin took two wickets and Tymal Mills got one to help them close the Powerplay on a high. Basil Thampi got two wickets and all of a sudden it was looking like a good win for Mumbai but they failed to take the wickets in the backend. Mumbai were hurt with Bumrah's spell mostly. He mostly finds a way to get a wicket and be economical but it was not the case this time around. He went for 43 runs while Daniel Sams did not have a debut to remember as he gave away more than 50 runs in his spell. Delhi bat deep, really deep and their fire-power was shown here. Delhi are off to this new campaign with a hard-fought win, all thanks to Axar Patel and Lalit Yadav. It always looked like Mumbai were 15-20 runs short and it turned out the same as well.

Delhi are a hit away now from a famous victory. 17.5 overs (1 Run) Seam up this time from Sams and on the pads. This is tucked away leg side for a single. 17.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! This might be the defining blow from Lalit Yadav and what an innings it has been from him! Full and wide, creamed through extra cover for a boundary. 11 needed now off 14 balls. 17.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX!

Patel waits for it and pulls it a long way over the backward square leg fence for a huge hit. 22 needed now off 17 balls. Daniel Sams is back into the attack. 16.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR LEG BYES! Just it has been in the last 6-7overs, Delhi get a boundary off the final delivery of the over. Full and on the pads, Yadav misses the flick and the ball goes off the pads, past a diving Ishan Kishan and runs away into the fine leg fence. 28 needed now off 18 balls. 16.6 overs (1 Run) WIDE! This is poor bowling from Thampi and he seems under pressure now. Full and well down leg. Wided. 16.5 overs (1 Run) Gets away with that one does Thampi. A full toss, on leg stump. Patel gets low and slogs it straight towards the man at the mid-wicket fence. Single taken. 16.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Thampi comes 'round the wicket and serves a length ball on off stump.
