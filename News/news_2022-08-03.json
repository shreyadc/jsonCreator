En route the target of 165, team India, akin the second T20I a day before, lost Rohit Sharma early, albeit this time around, he was forced to retire hurt during the second Over of the chase. However, after a string of low scores, Rohit‚Äôs opening partner in the ongoing series, Suryakumar Yadav, did what he does best, to nearly single-handedly rule the match in India‚Äôs favour, with a stellar innings of 76 off 44 deliveries, aided by the help of 8 Fours and 4 Sixes. Shreyas Iyer (24 off 27) and Rishabh Pant (33* off 26) proved to be Kumar‚Äôs able partners at the other end, as India clinched the match with an Over to spare.

Hardik Pandya (4-0-19-1) yet again was economical in the third successive T20I, while Arshdeep Singh (4-0-33-1) was impressive again during the death Overs.

India captain Rohit Sharma has expressed pleasure in watching opening partner Suryakumar Yadav play a match-winning knock to seal a 165-run chase in the recently concluded third T20I against West Indies in Basseterre. Opening the batting for the third consecutive time, Yadav didn‚Äôt take much time before finding his rhythm. Having entered his zone on the back of playing some eye-catching shots, there was no stopping Yadav as he raced through to a stroke-filled 76 (44) at a strike rate of 171.72. Yadav, 31, hit eight fours and four sixes to win his fourth match award in 22nd T20I. ‚ÄúIt is very important that if you get a start in this format, you should convert it. It does well for the team. The 30s and 40s look good but when you get past 70-80 and get a hundred [as well], then you‚Äôre scoring those runs for the team,‚Äù Sharma told ESPN Caribbean during the post-match presentation ceremony. Sky‚Äôs range is something that troubles even some of the top class bowlers in t20s. Brilliant batting @surya_14kumar ‚Äî Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) August 2, 2022 ‚ÄúGood partnership with [Shreyas] Iyer. When you are chasing a target like that anything can happen. It was not an easy target and the pitch had something for the bowlers. It was important for us to pick the right shots off the right balls.‚Äù Sharma, who himself hit a four and six each during his five-ball stay at the Warner Park, walked back to the pavilion in the second over to give a massive scare to the fans of the Indian cricket team. It was only after some time that BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) tweeted to confirm Sharma suffering a back spasm . The 35-year old player was seen sitting in the dugout by the end of the match to provide a sigh of relief to one and all. Being asked about the extent of the injury, Sharma sounded comfortable and fit enough to take part in the fourth T20I on Saturday. ‚ÄúMy body is OK, we have a few days in between so hopefully it should be OK,‚Äù Sharma said. A three-day break between the third and fourth T20Is should be enough for Sharma to recover assuming his injury isn‚Äôt a major one.","pubDate":"2022-08-02 20:40:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Yadav powers India to 2-1 series lead in West Indies","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/08/03/cricket-yadav-powers-india-to-2-1-series-lead-in-west-indies","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Opener Suryakumar Yadav scored an impressive 76 as India defeated West Indies by seven wickets in the third Twenty20 international in Basseterre on Tuesday, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.

I told my coach before the race and he said whatever happens, it is gathering intel, gaining experience. And I‚Äôm glad I went out there and put together the best race I could tonight. Just off my PB, so, I cannot ask for much more, aside from learning how to deal with the experience and pressure bit. It is very exciting,‚Äù he told Channel 7.Asked what was more nerve-wracking, a Commonwealth Games final or performing in front of 10,000 screaming girls, Simpson reckoned it was the former.‚ÄúRight now, I think it is this. I think with experience comes confidence. And I‚Äôm still gathering the experience, so still gathering the experience, so still gaining confidence, I am happy to be here. And I think, win or lose today, I‚Äôm going to go back to the drawing board and make sure I come back stronger. I‚Äôve already way ahead where I thought I would be at this stage.‚ÄúPeople are swimming later into their 20s, it leaves so much room to be able to come into it later if you want to.

The South African pair of Lara Van Niekerk and Tatjana Schoenmaker taking the top two spots.After the race all finalists gathered together in a group hug in a touching moment and then exited the pool together.‚ÄúWe actually planned in marshalling that all eight of us are going to come together and show everyone how close we all are and how much we love each other. It is the friendly games and I think we showed that to everyone tonight.‚ÄùCrucially for Hodges, who turned 21 last month, the bronze medal also assures her of a start in the Australian women‚Äôs medley relay team on Thursday, where Australia will start as the gold medal favourites.Bradley Woodward then finished like a train down the last 50m of the 200m backstroke to take silver in one of the races of the Games. Brodie Williams of England touching in 1:56.40, only one hundredth of a second in front of Woodward.CHALMERS NOT NAMED IN RELAYBy Julian LindenKyle Chalmers has been left off the Australian team for the mixed medley relay final at the Commonwealth Games after the Dolphins selectors stuck with the same lineup used in last year‚Äôs Tokyo Olympics.Chalmers has been in great form in Birmingham, winning three gold medals, but the coaches decided to retain the same combination that performed so well in Tokyo last year, winning a bronze medal.That means Emma McKeon - Australia‚Äôs greatest swimmer - will swim the concluding freestyle leg.World record holder Kaylee McKeown will swim the backstroke leg while Zac Stubblety-Cook will do breaststroke and Matt Temple butterfly.The team is at unbackable odds to win the gold.A new event on the Commonwealth Games program, the makeup of mixed relays is always one of the trickiest for selectors to make because of the different options available.Many team use male swimmers for the first two legs then females for the last two.Australia‚Äôs preference is to start and finish with females. Australia‚Äôs biggest rivals for the gold medal - England - have also opted for the same combination.Although he missed out on the mixed medley relay, Chalmers is expected to be an automatic pick for the men‚Äôs medley relay on the final day of competition.AGONY IN THE 100m HEATSThere was drama during the 100m heats with Swaziland‚Äôs Ayanda Malaza spectacularly crashing to the track after just 20m.Malaza had pinged his hamstring and lay motionless for several minutes before officials rushed to his aid.The 19-year-old broke down in tears and was eventually taken off the track in a wheelchair with the capacity crowd at Alexander Stadium giving him a rousing reception.It was a dramatic race whihc had already suffered a false start after Nigeria‚Äôs Godson Oke Oghenebrume began too early.Malaza could be seen clutching his hamstring as he waved his arm for attention.And medics quickly rushed to the scene as Malaza began crying.There was no chance of the star being able to walk off the track.Meanwhile, Australia‚Äôs fastest man Rohan Browning has put his world championships debacle behind him by cruising through to the semi-finals.Browning didn‚Äôt get out of the heats in Eugene last month but the Flying Mullet was back in town, finishing in 10.10sec.‚ÄúI‚Äôve been wondering where that‚Äôs been all year. It‚Äôs been a real season of ups and downs.The losses started to pile up,‚Äù Browning said.‚ÄúBut I heard a great quote over on the PGA Tour earlier this week, a winner is just a loser who kept on trying. I tried to channel a bit of that in this Commonwealth Games. Always good to win the heat.‚ÄùCOUGHLAN TAKES JUDO GOLDAustralia‚Äôs Aofie Coughlan has won gold in the under 70kg women‚Äôs judo match after outlasting Jamaica‚Äôs Ebony Drysdale Daley.The two couldn‚Äôt be separated after allotted time and had to go into a golden score.Coughlan was the aggressor throughout, nearly getting an ippon with a minute to go, but Drysdale Daley, the first Jamaican to compete for gold, held on throughout.But she received three shidos, with Coughlan winning via disqualification.It‚Äôs the third medal for Australia from the Coventry Arena this evening.Jake Benstead won via ippon over Northern Ireland‚Äôs Josuha Green in the bronze medal match in the men‚Äôs under 73kg.Katharina Haecker won via ippon over Jamaica‚Äôs Lauren Semple in the under 63kg women‚Äôs event.ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBy Eliza BarrA team-mate‚Äôs selfless sacrifice has proved worth it after Australia‚Äôs Tyson Bull took out the horizontal bar silver silver medal in the Commonwealth Games artistic gymnastics - after fellow Australian Clay Stephens sacrificed his reserve spot to give Bull the opportunity.Bull had crashed out in his qualifier on the apparatus and failing to make the final.When team-mate Jesse Moore pulled out due to injury, Stephens would have qualified as the first reserve - but he gave up his spot to give Bull his chance as the second reserve.He held the gold medal position the entire final, until he was pipped at the post by Cyprus‚Äô Ilia‚Äôs Georgiou with just 0.233 between them.Mitchell Morgans was also denied the bronze by a narrow margin, coming in fourth to Cyprus‚Äô Marios Georgiou when Ilias took the top position on the leaderboard.After falling short in Monday‚Äôs finals, there were tears from Australia‚Äôs Emily Whitehead when she clinched the bronze medal on floor.It is the only medal for the reigning Oceania all-round champion at this year‚Äôs games.GOLDEN BEAMBy Eliza BarrIt‚Äôs double the fun and double the glory for Australia‚Äôs female gymnasts, with debutante Kate McDonald claiming gold in the balance beam and Georgia Godwin taking out silver in her fourth medal of the Commonwealth Games.Melbourne‚Äôs McDonald had fallen just short of her own expectations in the uneven bars on Monday - but the moment she knew she had secured a spot on the podium, and overcome her senior team-mate Godwin, prompted instant tears on the sidelines.Godwin had come in strong with a solid gold medal performance in the all-around and another on the vault, followed by a silver in the uneven bars.James Bacueti has changed the cruel fortunes of Australia‚Äôs male artistic gymnasts by landing a bronze medal in the vault. The Australian men‚Äôs team just missed out on bronze and teen star Jesse Moore pulled out of the all-around, the horizontal bar and the rings finalsBacueti broke the duck to finish on the podium behind England‚Äôs Jake Jarman and Gianni Regini-Moran.Tyson Bull and Mitchell Morgans were out of luck in the men‚Äôs parallel bars, placing outside the medal positions.WALES NO MATCH FOR DIAMONDSBy Erin BarrIt was far from a perfect game but despite missing key midcourter Paige Hadley, ruled out with an injury, the Diamonds claimed their fourth win of the Commonwealth Games.Hadley, who hobbled off the court in the win against South Africa, watched the bench with a heavily strapped up right calf muscle. A few shaky moments, including some out of character handling errors, helped keep Wales in touch with the table leaders Australia in the first quarter, which ended 20-11. Diamonds emerged for the second quarter with a bit of extra focus - stepping it up and keeping Wales to just seven goals.Gretel Bueta started at GA tonight and is yet to drop a shot, netting 18 goals. Diamonds go into the second half up 42-18. The dominance continued in the second half with Diamonds rounding out the game 79-33.CHALMERS ON TRACK FOR NO.4Kyle Chalmers is on track to win his fourth gold medal at the Commonwealth Games after Australia smashed the opposition to qualify fastest for the final of the mixed medley relay.Chalmers did not swim in Tuesday night‚Äôs heats but is a certainty to be selected for the anchor leg in Wednesday morning‚Äôs final after blowing his rivals away 24 hours earlier to win the individual 100m freestyle final.King Kyle has also won two gold medals in freestyle relays in Birmingham and it would take a major upset for Australia not to win the mixed medley because of the incredible talent they have at their disposal.The lineup for the final won‚Äôt be announced until the start of the finals season but is likely to include Kaylee McKeown (backstroke), Zac Stubblety-Cook (breaststroke), Emma McKeon (butterfly) and Chalmers.With Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton watching from the stands, Australia was represented by Mitch Larkin, Sam Williamson, Alex Perkins and Madi Wilson, who combined to post the fastest overall time of 3:45.34 - almost six seconds clear of the next best.Swimming wrap - Men‚Äôs 50m freestyleThe Aussie teenage star who‚Äôs been beating Chalmers‚Äô national age group records has stormed into the semifinals of his first individual race at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.Flynn Southam, 17, has already won two gold medals in relays in his maiden appearance at a senior international event.And now the gun youngster has made it through to the semis of the men‚Äôs one-lap sprint, even though it‚Äôs not his strongest event.He only got the call up when Isaac Cooper was sent home for ‚Äòwellbeing‚Äô issues but safely made it through the heats, posting the 12th fastest time overall.Australia‚Äôs Tom Nowakowski, the national champion, was second quickest overall for Wednesday morning‚Äôs semis while Grayson Bell advanced with the ninth best time.Women‚Äôs 50m backstrokeAussie ironwoman Kaylee McKeown eased into the semi finals of the 50m backstroke with a controlled heat swim.McKeown has already won gold medals in the 100m and 200m backstroke and a silver in the 200m individual medley but is still firing with three more events to go, including two relays.She finished second in her heat in a time of 28.09 to qualify fourth quickest overall behind her Canadian rival Kyle Masse.Australia‚Äôs Bronte Job, swimming in the lane next to Masse, was second overall while teenage star Mollie O‚ÄôCallaghan - won her heat and was fifth overall. She already has three golds and a silver and is also through to the 100m freestyle final.Men‚Äôs 1500m freestyleRising teenage distance swimmer Sam Short put himself in position to win gold in the best event on the program after setting the fastest time for Thursday morning‚Äôs final.A silver medallist in the 400m, Short won his heat in 15:02.66 - more than 20 second clear of the next best, his Aussie team mate Kieren Pollard (15:23.46).Short‚Äôs prospects of winning gold were given a massive lift following the withdrawal of Welshman Dan Jervis, who was the likely favourite.Jervis contracted Covid after making the final at last month‚Äôs world championships and issued a heartfelt statement explaining that he had been unable to properly train in the weeks between.Men‚Äôs 200m backstrokeAustralia‚Äôs three entrants all qualified directly for the final.Brad Woodward was the fastest Aussie, finishing second in his heat to qualify third overall.Josh Edwards-Smith won his heat to be sixth while Mitch Larkin was second in the same heat and seventh.England‚Äôs Luke Greenback, the bronze medallist in the event at last year‚Äôs Tokyo Olympics, posted the top time to go into the final as the gold medal favourite.Women‚Äôs 200m butterflyAustralian teenager Lizzie Dekkers was nearly two seconds faster than her nearest rival as she topped the charts in a time of 2:07.62.With world champion Summer McIntosh skipped the race, Dekkers has a great shot at winning her first gold medal at senior international level.Her team mate Abbey Connor was third while another Aussie, Brianna Throssell also made the final as the fifth best qualifier.9:15PM FLYING MULLET INTO FINALROHAN Browning has declared there will be no repeat of Tokyo as he eyes a berth in the Commonwealth Games 100m final.Australia‚Äôs fastest man bounced back from his world championships disappointment with a stunning 10.10sec heat victory.The Flying Mullet became a household name after winning his heat at the Olympic Games last year but then failed to get out of the semi-finals.Browning, 24, was brimming with confidence after his first look at Alexander Stadium, stating he had plenty left for Wednesday night‚Äôs finals.‚ÄúIt is by far my best run for the year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow I don‚Äôt want a repeat of Tokyo where I was out in the semis, I want to keep a little bit of powder dry for the final.‚ÄùBrowning was the equal fourth fastest through to the semi-finals with Sri Lanka‚Äôs Yupun Abeykoon clocking the fastest time of 10.06sec in the qualifying round.He will be joined in the semi-finals by his Australian teammate Jake Doran who finished second (10.39sec) in an earlier heat.It has been an interrupted year for Browning through illness and injury and it found him out at the world championships in Eugene, Oregon, where he ran 10.22sec to be eliminated.‚ÄúI tried not to take it to heart, there is always that humiliation element of when you get run out in the heats,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI tried to bounce back from it, not take it to heart and just trust that the form is there, it‚Äôs just in the execution. I think I have tapped into a good vein of form for these championships.‚ÄúThis year I have struggled a bit on the circuit, the losses really started to pile up and I‚Äôve been wondering where that‚Äôs been all year.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a real season of ups and downs but I heard a great quote over on the PGA Tour earlier this week, a winner is just a loser who keeps on trying. I tried to channel a bit of that in this Commonwealth Games.‚ÄúI knew I had a run like that in me, I stumbled a bit out of the blocks, it was far from the perfect race. The conditions out here are pretty average and I just want to keep progressing.‚Äù9:05PM AUSSIE INJURY ISSUESAustralian midcourter Paige Hadley will miss today‚Äôs match against Wales with a calf injury.Hadley, 29, injured her right calf in the Diamonds‚Äô 25-goal win over South Africa yesterday.‚ÄúPaige is one of the toughest competitors in netball, and we will continue to work with our medical team on her return to the court,‚Äù said Australian Diamonds head coach Stacey Marinkovich.‚ÄúWe have a versatile and dynamic team, and we are focused on improving performance as we progress towards the business end of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.‚Äùfreak accident at the world championships last month has made Australian runner Catriona Bisset hungrier than ever as she hunts for gold at Commonwealth Games.The 800m athlete was left with 11 stitches in her thigh after being knocked over on the home straight and accidentally stamped on by a rival‚Äôs spikes on the home straight in Oregon.Incredibly, Bisset picked herself up, finished the race and qualified for the semi-finals.While the injury has not impacted her running, Bisset gave a stomach-turning description of the recovery.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all closed and scabbed over now, so there‚Äôs none of that gnarly, pussy, gross stuff,‚Äù the 28-year-old said.‚ÄúAll the bruising‚Äôs disappeared now, as well, so it‚Äôs finally a normal skin colour, rather than bright purple.‚ÄúIt gives me a lot of motivation to run in this next one.‚ÄúI feel like I didn‚Äôt really get a good crack at worlds and I‚Äôm in really good shape. It‚Äôs been a pretty flawless build-up to these majors, which is why it‚Äôs definitely really heartbreaking to have this freak accident.‚ÄùAUSSIE GETS THORUGH ON THE LINEBy Scott GullanAustralia‚Äôs second fastest man Jake Doran has qualified for the 100m semi-finals.The national champion finished second in his heat in 10.39sec which got him an automatic passage through to Wednesday‚Äôs finals.Gold medal favourite South Africa‚Äôs Akani Simbine won the heat in 10.09sec.Australia‚Äôs fastest man Rohan Browning is set to go in the ninth heat.It is a cut-throat qualifying in the 100m with only the first two in each heat guaranteed a spot in the semi-finals with the next seven fastest also advancing.Australia enjoyed an excellent start to the athletics program with heptathlete Taneille Crase winning the opening event on the track, the 100 hurdles in a personal best 13.42sec.And moments later Henry Frayne confirmed his place in the long jump final by leaping 7.85m with his first qualifying jump.He will be joined in the final by teammate Chris Mitrevski who recorded 7.76m with his second jump.HOCKEYROOS IN TENSE WINBy Joe BartonFor the second time in 24 hours, Australian hockey reigned supreme over arch rivals New Zealand ‚Äì this time with the Hockeyroos doing the damage.12 hours after the Kookaburras destroyed their rivals 7-2 to move atop Pool A in the men‚Äôs tournament, Australia‚Äôs women repeated the dose with a tense 1-0 victory on Tuesday morning.The win keeps Australia‚Äôs perfect record at Birmingham intact and puts them in the box seat to finish on top of Pool B with just a match against Scotland to come on Wednesday.This was a match the Hockeyroos had circled since the draw was made public, with a chance for some retribution for the gold medal defeat on the Gold Coast four years ago.Now comes one final pool game, against Scotland on Wednesday, and potentially two more victories to secure the ultimate redemption of Commonwealth Games gold.In a cagey match, in which Australia was frequently saved by last-ditch defensive efforts from the likes of Renee Taylor and Claire Colwill, it was the first-quarter goal to Kaitlin Nobbs that split the teams at the break.Nobbs converted from the penalty spot after New Zealand‚Äôs defence denied a certain goal with a foot ‚Äì leading to a penalty stroke being awarded.It continues a dream tournament for Nobbs, who has five goals for the tournament, hammered home a hat-trick in the opener against Kenya and also brought up her 100th game in green and gold this week.6:57AM SPLIT LOYALTIES FOR AUSSIE Cricket star Mitchell Starc will arrive in Birmingham this week ‚Äì but his eyes may be focused away from Edgbaston Stadium, where wife Alyssa Healy is leading Australia‚Äôs women‚Äôs cricket charge.Australia have started with consecutive wins, following a scare against India in their opener, but Starc hasn‚Äôt been in the stands.Instead, he was back home to attend some weddings ‚Äî including that of Test captain Pat Cummins to Becky Boston in Byron on Friday. Starc is sure to be in the stands watching the women‚Äôs bid to win the maiden Commonwealth Games T20 gold, but Healy believes the major drawcard that lured the left-arm quick to the UK was brother Brandon, who is competing in the high jump.‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs coming over for Brandon more than me,‚Äù she said.SWIM STAR WOULD HAVE ‚ÄòCUT FINGER OFF‚Äô TO WIN Making history at the Commonwealth Games was not enough for South Africa‚Äôs swimming hero Chad Le Clos with the 18-time medallist denied gold in the men‚Äôs 200 metres butterfly. The medal saw Le Clos join shooters Michael Gault and Phil Adams as the most decorated Commonwealth Games athletes of all time and also came 10 years to the day since he beat Michael Phelps in the same event at the 2012 London Olympics. But the 30-year-old could not hide his frustrations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gutted not to have won, I‚Äôll be honest,‚Äù he said afterwards. ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve cut my finger off to win tonight. It meant everything to me and my family ‚Äì everyone‚Äôs in the stands, my friends flew out for this race.‚Äù Le Clos was beaten to the wall by New Zealand‚Äôs Lewis Clareburt with a winning time of 1:55.60 seconds. ‚ÄúFair play to Lewis, he had a great race,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe said he watched me growing up and I said, ‚Äòman, did you have to do it on my day? Could you not have given me one more time?‚Äù Le Clos‚Äôs medal haul from four Commonwealth Games includes seven gold, four silver and seven bronze.FANS ANGRY OVER BIZARRE COMM GAMES INCIDENTS Eliza Barr A bus crash involving an allegedly intoxicated driver, illegal parking and snaking queues for major events are among the dramas that have been overcome by organisers since the Commonwealth Games kicked off last week.Several people were injured when a bus carrying spectators from the Rugby Sevens in Coventry back to the Birmingham city centre collided with three cars on July 30.There were no serious injuries and a 27-year-old man was subsequently arrested over allegations of drug driving and causing injury to a minor, West Midlands police said.Meanwhile, hordes of cars in Birmingham were plastered with $85 tickets after motorists fell foul of temporary Games parking restrictions designed to ease parking access for residents with so many visitors expected near Games venues.Other spectators took to social media to complain about ‚Äúshambolic‚Äù planning as queues for the men‚Äôs artistic gymnastics team final snaked for hundreds of metres outside Arena Birmingham on Day 1 of the Games, causing some punters to miss 45 minutes of the event.The access issues appeared to be resolved by Day 3, with queues moving into the venue much more smoothly.Updates to story","pubDate":"2022-08-02 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland vs South Africa 1st T20I Live Telecast Channel in India and UK: When and where to watch IRE vs SA Bristol T20I?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ireland-vs-south-africa-1st-t20i-live-telecast-channel-in-india-and-uk-when-and-where-to-watch-ire-vs-sa-bristol-t20i/","keywords":["Cricket","Ireland","South Africa","South Africa tour of Ireland 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ireland vs South Africa 1st T20I Live Telecast: The SportsRush presents before you the timing and live streaming details of the first IRE vs SA T20I.

During the third T20I of India‚Äôs tour of West Indies 2022 at Basseterre in St Kitts, team India skipper Rohit Sharma was forced to make a long walk back towards the dressing room after a few balls into his innings. It all happened during the second Over of the 165-run chase handed by the West Indies. Rohit had smashed pacer Alzarri Joseph for a Six while playing his renowned pull shot towards the deep backward square leg fence. A couple of deliveries later, he steeped down the pitch in his bid to dismiss the ball from his sight, but only to get an under edge off his bat towards the fine leg fence for a Four. After playing the next delivery gently towards the point region, Rohit seemed to be in quite some discomfort, as the team physio scampered through to the pitch to address the concern, which perhaps was the result of his aforementioned across the line whack for a Four. After some deliberation with the physio, the 35-year-old decided to ‚Äòretire hurt‚Äô, and was seen holding his back during his walk back, perhaps a cue for a possible case of a muscle pull.

As per ‚ÄòLaw 25‚Äô of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) under the head ‚Äì ‚ÄòBatters retiring‚Äô, a batter may retire at any time during his/her innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to proceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring (law 25.4.1). Furthermore, if a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume his/her innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‚ÄòRetired ‚Äì not out‚Äô (law 25.4.2). Also, for those unaware, a batter cannot resume his innings in case he is ‚Äòretired out‚Äô, as was the case with Ravichandran Ashwin during IPL 2022 match between Rajasthan Royals and Lucknow Super Giants.","pubDate":"2022-08-02 18:43:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rohit Sharma Injury Update: What happened to Rohit Sharma in today match?

During the third T20I of India‚Äôs tour of West Indies in Basseterre, India captain Rohit Sharma has left the whole of Indian cricket fans scared post him retiring hurt midway through his innings. Opening the batting with Suryakumar Yadav in a 165-run chase, Sharma had nailed a pull off West Indies fast bowler Alzarri Joseph to hit a six off just the second ball that he faced. On the third delivery of the same over, Sharma aimed to step down the track but had to make a last-minute change to another short delivery. While a bottom edge aided Sharma in finding a fortunate boundary through the fine-leg region, it also appeared to have done something to his body. Rohit Sharma Injury Update A sudden swivel to adjust to the short delivery perhaps threw Sharma in a region of discomfort. Sharma, who guided the following delivery to point, immediately called for medical attention. A brief interaction with the Indian physio ended in Sharma opting to walk back to the pavilion. Considering the suddenness of the move and the absence of any official statement from the Indian team management, it seems that Sharma has faced a lower back niggle. With the amount of cricket to be played in the next few months, both Sharma and Indian fans would be hoping for the injury to not be very serious. Rohit goes out.

However, batting heavy sides like Australia, England, New Zealand, and even India during their previous match against Pakistan, have not found run-scoring an uphill task so far. Also, the pitch has offered decent bounce and movement off the deck for the new ball bowlers, as was on display during the opening match between India and Australia, when India‚Äôs Renuka Singh breathed fire with the new ball, getting rid of each of the four top-order Aussie batters in her spell.
