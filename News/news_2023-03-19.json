Thomas’ on Thursday. Moments after the skipper ended a seven-year wait for a batsman from Reid Avenue to score a century, Ramiru Perera joined the list scoring 128 runs. The duo were involved in a record-breaking fifth wicket partnership that helped them recover to post a commanding total after being four wickets down for 63 runs in the morning. After Pasindu Sooriyabandara scored a debut century at the 2016 Big Match no Royalist had passed the three-figure mark until Thursday. Manchanayake had played the lead role in the Royal batting lineup throughout this season. In fact, he earned the rare honour of scoring 1000 runs for the season this year. It included a double century as well. Not many Royalists have scored that many runs in the 144-year-old history of the college. He scored 1059 runs at an average of 62.20. According to Royal statisticians there had been 19 Royalists who had scored over 1000 runs for the season but only five of them had averaged over 50. Since 2000, 12 Royalist batsmen had scored over 1000 runs but only Bhanuka Rajapaksa (in 2009: 1184 runs in 15 matches at 53.81) and Sooriyabandara (in 2019: 1257 runs in 16 matches at 83.80) had averaged above 50. Of the others, R.S. Madugalle (1979: 1207 runs in 16 matches at 71.00), S. Warnakulasuriya (1981: 1308 runs in 16 matches at 76.94) and C. Amerasinghe (1983: 1329 runs in 17 matches at 73.83) stand out for their outstanding averages. When this edition was ready for press, Manchanayake had backed his century with a half-century in the second innings and had given Royal the complete command in the match. Not many Royalists who had scored thousand runs for the season had scored centuries in the Big Match. C.J. Fernando in 1971 (160n.o), A. Polonnowita in 1996 (165), S. Senaratne in 2006 (104) ND Ramith Rambukwella in 2012 (127) are the only other batsman to have followed up their 1000 runs with centuries in the Big Match. More than anything else what makes Manchanayake’s century so special is the impact it had on the match. On paper, the Thomians were the team that had the edge and when he was joined by Ramiru Perera Royal were four wickets down for 63 runs. He was positive from the word go and remained so until Royal took a firm grip of the game. Published on By Over the years, we have seen the cricket team rebuilding after an extended period of poor run and when that happens a few seniors are given the cold shoulder. Although these tough decisions are taken with the best interest of the game in mind, there have been occasions that some selectors have settled old scores. Rebuilding at times don’t go to plan. Sometimes they backfire and the very players whom you have dropped prove yourself wrong scoring heavily either in domestic cricket or in a different format of international cricket. At times these players are recalled but when that happens the selectors who had dropped them have moved on and a new set have taken over. This time though it’s quite different as the same selectors who introduced the aggressive youth policy have taken a step back, either they are honest people who have realized their mistake or they are desperate given the dreadful scenario facing the ODI outfit. Sri Lanka need to win three out of three games in New Zealand if they are to qualify automatically for the World Cup or else they will have to play the qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June. Mathews is going to be a crucial cog in the wheel as Sri Lanka ensure that they keep their World Cup record intact having played in all editions of the tournament since the inaugural one in 1975. In Trivandrum early this year, Sri Lanka were shot out for 73 runs after India had posted 390 for five in their 50 overs. It was a massive 317 run defeat, the heaviest in the history of ODI cricket by any team. Having seen that the selectors have got cold feet and were left with Hobson’s choice but to recall Mathews, who has scored nearly 6000 runs at an average of over 41. There are many questions about the selectors’ choices. Carried away by their youth policy they played T20 players in the ODI format and today those players can’t even find a place in the T20 side. Bhanuka Rajapaksa is a case in point. Plus they experimented with too many all-rounders and still too many of them have persevered eventhough results have been pretty ordinary. It’s the same policy that England tried out for so long when they were pathetic in limited overs cricket two decades ago. Sadly, our selectors have borrowed a leaf out of England. Mathews selection is certainly a step in the right direction but much more needs to be done moving forward. Kusal Janith Perera, who hasn’t played any international cricket since November 2021 is also back in the reckoning after shoulder surgery. He’ll initially feature only in T20s but soon should come into the ODI mix too as Sri Lanka try to qualify for the World Cup.

The veteran Kiwi demonstrated all her famed power as she just missed out on the first-ever century in the new Women’s Premier League, blitzing 99 off just 36 balls in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Giants on Saturday. Earlier at the other WPL venue in Mumbai, the DY Patil Stadium, Alyssa Healy’s UP Warriorz became the first team to beat the table-topping Mumbai Indians, with some robust hitting from her Australian compatriots Grace Harris and Tahlia McGrath helping them to a five-wicket win.

Credit: Getty Images But it was as nothing compared to the late game at Brabourne Stadium, as the 33-year-old Devine smashed eight sixes with RCB making light work of the Giants’ 4-188, reaching their target on 2-189 with 27 balls to spare. Devine’s power hitting was remarkable, as she clattered 84 in boundaries. She was selfless too, getting caught at mid-off while still trying to boom one over the top in a bid to smash RCB to the quickest possible victory to help their net run-rate, rather than stroking a simple single that would have eased her to the first three-figure score in the league. She crushed one six into the upper-tier of the stand and admitted afterwards that watching Australian allrounder Ash Gardner crack a six and six fours in her 26-ball 41 for the Giants had been a bit of an education. “It’s been good to see how other batters go about it. So even just watching Ash bat, I learned a lot and just took out the best bits and applied it to how I wanted to bat,” said Devine. Unfortunately for Gardner, Devine also took a fancy to her off-spin, smashing her for 24 off her first over as the Aussie star ended up going for 48 off three. “Most of the time when I’ve seen her bat like that, it’s been playing against her. So for me selfishly, it’s nice to be on her side tonight,” smiled Perry, who guided RCB home with 19no. “There are few people who can do what she did tonight but she’s been doing it consistently for years and what she did tonight was special. “That last shot where she got out typifies Sophie. It’s not about runs for her but playing for the team. To be going for a big shot on 99 when cover was open for a single, it speaks volumes to her character as a person.” Devine’s innings has kept RCB in the chase for one of the three play-off places as has UP’s successful chase of Mumbai’s 127, which owed much to McGrath’s 38 off 25 balls and Harris’s 39 from 28.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 23:50:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Proteas’ run chase falls short despite brilliant century by captain Temba Bavuma","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas/proteas-run-chase-falls-short-despite-brilliant-century-by-captain-temba-bavuma-574cbcaf-7dad-4bd1-b02f-4becf752a842","keywords":null,"creator":["Ongama Gcwabe"],"video_url":null,"description":"Proteas’ captain Temba Bavuma scored a brilliant 144 at Buffalo Park on Saturday, but it was not enough as the West Indies won the second ODI by 48 runs.","content":"Gqeberha — South Africa fell 48 runs shy from what would have been a fourth highest successful run chase despite a third three-figure score of the year from the captain, Temba Bavuma. Despite the beautiful 48 from Quinton de Kock, there was no other Proteas batter that steadily and confidently held an end alongside Temba Bavuma in the mammoth run chase of 339 runs in Buffalo Park. De Kock’s knock promised to be the innings that would turn things around for the wicket-keeper batter but once again, he gave a teaser that reminded everyone that he is still box office quality. The left hander struck five 4s and three sixes in his 26-ball stay at the crease before he was trapped leg-before wicket by Kyle Mayers, leaving the former captain visibly upset with himself for lapsing in concentration. A partnership of 76 was broken and in came debutant Tony de Zorzi. De Zorzi stayed as long as De Kock at the crease but managed 27 in his stay. Rassie van der Dussen and Tristan Stubbs fell for single figure scores while all this time Temba Bavuma was edging closer to a third century of the year. Bavuma was his typical, classy self on his way to 144 off 117 balls. He stayed the cause and let De Kock have a go at West Indies opening bowlers while he kept the score board ticking with singles, hitting the occasional boundary when the bowlers dished out freebies. He brought up his third international hundred of the year and pushed the game to the last ten overs of the innings. Bavuma gloved an Alzarri Joseph slower ball bouncer back to the safe hands of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps. At some point, there was belief that Bavuma and Lungi Ngidi (12* off 23) might just carry South Africa to victory as the pair put on a highest nineth wicket partnership at Buffalo Park in ODIs, worth 49 off 46 balls. Joseph accounted for Tabraiz Shamsi in the same over and won the match for the West Indies by 48 runs. Earlier, Shai Hope’s unbeaten 128 and Rovman Powell’s 46 pushed the West Indies to 335/8 in their allotted 50 overs. Debutant, Gerald Coetzee, was pick of the bowlers for South Africa with figures of 3/57 and was followed by Bjorn Fortuin’s 2/57. It was truly the captain’s day in East London as they both put on inspirational batting performances as they lead squads in rebuilding phase.

With Multan needing four runs off the last ball - bowled by Zaman Khan - Khusdil Shah was run out while attempting a third run that would have tied Lahore's total of 200-6. Instead Multan finished on 199-8 to see them lose out to Lahore again in a repeat of last year's final. The Qalanders are the first team in PSL history to retain the title. Captain Shaheen Shah Afridi was influential throughout, securing Player of the Match honours after smashing five sixes and two boundaries in a belligerent 44 not out off just 15 balls at the back-end of the Lahore innings, and then the left-arm pace bowler following that up with four wickets in the final overs to finish with figures of 4-51. Shaheen's initial efforts with the bat helped catapult Lahore to what only just proved to be a match-winning score. When he came to the crease, the Qalanders were reeling at 111-4 after a run of four wickets for 17 runs in the space of three overs - Kent and England's Sam Billings among them, out for nine. But Shaheen and Abdullah Shafique, who anchored the innings superbly with 65 of 40 balls, proceeded to plunder a staggering 85 runs off the final five overs to fire Lahore up to 200. In reply, Rilee Rossouw (52 off 32 balls) hit a fine fifty to keep Multan on top of the required run rate, and though Mohammad Rizwan (34 off 23), Kieron Pollard (19 off 16) and Tim David (20 off 16) had their moments, a steady stream of wickets made things increasingly tougher for the Sultans - Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan chipping in with 2-26.

However, Nicholas Tadros is no ordinary kid. His toughness and resilience in the most awful of circumstances has made him just that for Penrith’s Jarome Luai – his hero. Nicholas is the boy who lost his mum and was seriously injured in the Sea World helicopter crash on January 2 in which four people died and nine were injured. Nicholas is the boy who lost his mum and was seriously injured in the Sea World helicopter crash on January 2 in which four people died and nine were injured. Nicholas is dealing with a lot, including the loss of a leg due to his injuries. When Luai was told he was the youngster’s hero, he couldn’t wait to help. “He is now my inspiration,” Luai said. “And I want to help him in any way I can.” Luai has his detractors – the line stretches around the block – but they don’t know the kind of work he does away from football. Nor will they know about the relationship he is developing with Nicholas. “It’s humbling to be in the position where you can make even the smallest difference,” Luai said. “None of this is about me. It puts life into perspective for me, and just knowing other people’s pressures, struggles and what they’re going through. “My heart is there for Nicholas. Sometimes life is just a whirlwind – we’re training, competing and all of this stuff – but it was definitely an awesome experience for me to just get a call from a young man who’s obviously been through a lot. Panthers star Jarome Luai visits Sea World helicopter tragedy survivor Nicholas Tadros. Just telling me I am his favourite player and I look up to you and things like that was was pretty awesome for me. We went over to Westmead Children’s Hospital and got to meet him and his father and some of his uncles. They are all great people.” Finding the words to express yourself in that situation would be difficult for many. But not Luai. “I don’t make it up ... I’m just myself,” he said. “That’s the person he wanted to meet, the guy you see on the field. So I got there and put some music on and we played it throughout the hospital. The nurses were telling us to turn it down and be quiet, but you know what he’s been through, so you just have that right energy around him. I was just so blessed to be a part of that.” And for Luai it’s not a one-off. “We definitely are going to stay in touch,” he said. “We have a bit of a deal going on, when he’s well and he gets out he’s coming to watch us. He’s had a pretty tough surgery, so it was pretty cool to build a connection with him and his family. It’s good to help him, to keep his spirits high through this stuff.” Crichton’s return Angus Crichton is about to re-enter the Roosters system, but he is being urged to take his time as he embraces his own mini pre-season. Crichton wants to be back playing football as soon as possible, but his mental health is the priority of all of those around him. His family, the club and his agent, David Rawlings , are all rallying around him. Rawlings gave this column the following statement. Sidelined Roosters star Angus Crichton. Credit: NRL Photos “The Roosters have done an extraordinary job in supporting Angus,” he said. “We met with the chairman [ Nick Politis ] on Friday for breakfast and he reiterated their commitment. There is a progressive plan in place for his return, which has been constructed with input from specialists and the club doctor, which we will implement over the next four to six weeks.” Act of Todd? He was once the boss of the NRL, but now Todd Greenberg is treated with a degree of suspicion, and even fear, by those running the game as they try to nut out a deal with the Rugby League Players’ Association. It’s no secret that Greenberg and influential NRL figures are not the best of friends, and maybe that’s why the game has been rife with rumours Greenberg has been involved with the RLPA in its fight with the NRL as they look to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. Greenberg left the NRL in April 2020 with a decent payout that included a clause that he could not divulge information he had gleaned during his time in the game. That might be troubling the NRL. Loading RLPA chief executive Clint Newton confirmed he’d had contact with Greenberg but said it was natural given Greenberg has a similar role as CEO of the Australian Cricketers’ Association. Newton strongly denied Greenberg was some kind of “puppet master”, saying their discussions had been limited to a number of text messages and he had been a mentor. Greenberg said there was “nothing for them [the NRL] to be edgy about”. “Just a sounding board during his most difficult and lonely times,” he said. “He’s [Newton] a good man and he’s doing a tough job so wanted to make sure he was going OK.” League to the rescue The promised federal government investment must be huge – well into the millions – because that’s the only way to justify the narrative that rugby league is going to bring peace to the Pacific. Without significant investment, it is hard to swallow. People smarter than this columnist say the code is being used to stop China getting a foothold in Papua New Guinea and becoming a threat to Australia; that if PNG gets an NRL team, the country will knock back Chinese investment. We don’t doubt the good intentions of PM and Rabbitohs tragic Anthony Albanese , who is pushing the idea. Even the suggestion that three more teams should be added to the competition – and that players could be recruited from the US to fill them – is hard to fathom. Loading A couple of years ago, a taskforce set up by the NRL recommended not to allow even one more team into the competition. When Peter V’landys became ARL Commission chairman he asked the committee to look at the idea again. It came back supporting expansion. Most of those involved have now left the NRL. At the time, the NRL suggested the key to growth was to lure Indian and Asian schoolchildren to the game. There is a strong expansion push for a Pacific team “based” in PNG but playing games in Townsville or Cairns, throughout the Pacific and at North Sydney Oval. It’s a head-scratcher.

However, Nicholas Tadros is no ordinary kid. His toughness and resilience in the most awful of circumstances has made him just that for Penrith’s Jarome Luai – his hero. Nicholas is the boy who lost his mum and was seriously injured in the Sea World helicopter crash on January 2 in which four people died and nine were injured. Nicholas is dealing with a lot, including the loss of a leg due to his injuries. When Luai was told he was the youngster’s hero, he couldn’t wait to help. “He is now my inspiration,” Luai said. “And I want to help him in any way I can.” Luai has his detractors – the line stretches around the block – but they don’t know the kind of work he does away from football. Nor will they know about the relationship he is developing with Nicholas. “It’s humbling to be in the position where you can make even the smallest difference,” Luai said. “None of this is about me. It puts life into perspective for me, and just knowing other people’s pressures, struggles and what they’re going through. “My heart is there for Nicholas. Sometimes life is just a whirlwind – we’re training, competing and all of this stuff – but it was definitely an awesome experience for me to just get a call from a young man who’s obviously been through a lot. Panthers star Jarome Luai visits Sea World helicopter tragedy survivor Nicholas Tadros. “Just telling me I am his favourite player and I look up to you and things like that was pretty awesome for me. We went over to Westmead Children’s Hospital and got to meet him and his father and some of his uncles. They are all great people.” Finding the words to express yourself in that situation would be difficult for many. But not Luai. “I don’t make it up ... I’m just myself,” he said. “That’s the person he wanted to meet, the guy you see on the field. So I got there and put some music on and we played it throughout the hospital. The nurses were telling us to turn it down and be quiet, but you know what he’s been through, so you just have that right energy around him. I was just so blessed to be a part of that.” And for Luai it’s not a one-off. “We definitely are going to stay in touch,” he said. “We have a bit of a deal going on, when he’s well and he gets out he’s coming to watch us. He’s had a pretty tough surgery, so it was pretty cool to build a connection with him and his family. It’s good to help him, to keep his spirits high through this stuff.” Angus Crichton is about to re-enter the Roosters system, but he is being urged to take his time as he embraces his own mini pre-season. Crichton wants to be back playing football as soon as possible, but his mental health is the priority of all of those around him. His family, the club and his agent, David Rawlings , are all rallying around him. Rawlings gave this column the following statement. Sidelined Roosters star Angus Crichton. Credit: NRL Photos “The Roosters have done an extraordinary job in supporting Angus,” he said. “We met with the chairman [ Nick Politis ] on Friday for breakfast and he reiterated their commitment. There is a progressive plan in place for his return, which has been constructed with input from specialists and the club doctor, which we will implement over the next four to six weeks.” He was once the boss of the NRL, but now Todd Greenberg is treated with a degree of suspicion, and even fear, by those running the game as they try to nut out a deal with the Rugby League Players’ Association. It’s no secret that Greenberg and influential NRL figures are not the best of friends, and maybe that’s why the game has been rife with rumours Greenberg has been involved with the RLPA in its fight with the NRL as they look to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. Greenberg left the NRL in April 2020 with a decent payout that included a clause that he could not divulge information he had gleaned during his time in the game. That might be troubling the NRL. RLPA chief executive Clint Newton confirmed he’d had contact with Greenberg but said it was natural given Greenberg has a similar role as CEO of the Australian Cricketers’ Association. Newton strongly denied Greenberg was some kind of “puppet master”, saying their discussions had been limited to a number of text messages and he had been a mentor. Greenberg said there was “nothing for them [the NRL] to be edgy about”. “Just a sounding board during his most difficult and lonely times,” he said. “He’s [Newton] a good man and he’s doing a tough job so wanted to make sure he was going OK.” The promised federal government investment must be huge – well into the millions – because that’s the only way to justify the narrative that rugby league is going to bring peace to the Pacific. Without significant investment, it is hard to swallow. People smarter than this columnist say the code is being used to stop China getting a foothold in Papua New Guinea and becoming a threat to Australia; that if PNG gets an NRL team, the country will knock back Chinese investment. We don’t doubt the good intentions of PM and Rabbitohs tragic Anthony Albanese , who is pushing the idea. Even the suggestion that three more teams should be added to the competition – and that players could be recruited from the US to fill them – is hard to fathom. A couple of years ago, a taskforce set up by the NRL recommended not to allow even one more team into the competition. When Peter V’landys became ARL Commission chairman he asked the committee to look at the idea again. It came back supporting expansion. Most of those involved have now left the NRL. At the time, the NRL suggested the key to growth was to lure Indian and Asian schoolchildren to the game. There is a strong expansion push for a Pacific team “based” in PNG but playing games in Townsville or Cairns, throughout the Pacific and at North Sydney Oval. It’s a head-scratcher. Expansion will occur only if teams from new areas play in those regions regularly. The AFL has taken a long-term approach to growing the code.

Zubayr Hamza is called aside to take a routine drugs test. He has performed this action numerous times during his career. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. But yet it is. Two months later upon the release of the results it emerges that Hamza has tested positive for a prohibited substance under the ICC's anti-doping code. How was it even possible? Was it recreational? Was it performance enhancing? These were the questions floating around while Hamza’s career was at a crossroads. The stylish batter had only just returned to the Proteas squad, having played a Test in New Zealand after also striking a maiden half-century on his ODI debut a couple of months earlier. Everything was seemingly on the rise again, but suddenly it seemed like his entire world was imploding. Hamza’s forward defence was that it was an unintentional act. He had simply taken the wrong medication. It was discovered later that Furosemide — a drug prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure and edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) — was found in his bloodstream. Unfortunately for Hamza, it is also a masking agent on the World Anti-Doping (Wada) list of prohibited substances, and he would still have to serve a ban. Hamza’s suspension was ultimately reduced to nine months from the prescribed two-year sentence. It was still an arduous long time with a home Test series against Bangladesh and a blue-chip tour to England that he would now miss. Hamza, who had played six Tests since his debut against Pakistan in 2019, was not allowed to pick up a bat from March 22, 2022, until his return to competitive cricket three days before Christmas last year. During this period Hamza was uncontactable. A likeable, social individual, he became reclusive. Rumours circulated that the Protea may not even return to the game at all. “There was a lot of self doubt. Dark times, so to speak,” Hamza exclusively told IOL Sport this week at Newlands, Cape Town. “A lot of retrospection. A lot of answers to questions I needed to answer. “It was by no means an easy period in my life, and not just my career. I learnt a lot of lessons about myself. During that period there were definitely doubts, and some tough questions whether I would make it back.” But while Hamza shut out the rest of the world, he leaned heavily on those closest to him. And that’s how he began his rehabilitation process. From being spotted on the golf course to attending Cape Town City FC matches, Hamza was slowly emerging from seclusion. It also helped that his introspection was starting to take shape. “I have always kept my circle small and close. People that I trust, who always want the best for me. During that time those people played a massive role in keeping my mind off things at that point. There are also a few close teammates that I have played with for a very long time who know me better than I know myself,” Hamza said. “In terms of how I was going to go about my career, and what I still wanted to achieve, fortunately I found the answers to those things. The goals would always remain simple. As out of this world it might be, it is something that I enjoy challenging myself with. I am where I am now (because of the process), and to be honest, I’ve slightly enjoyed the process.” The next step was his reintegration into the Western Province dressing room. In his absence, Tony de Zorzi had taken over the mantle as the team’s premier batter, which included a historic triple century at Newlands and was now actually pushing for Hamza’s Proteas Test spot higher up, while Kyle Verreynne had taken over the leadership reins. But the peripherals were not Hamza’s focus. He just wanted to get back out on the turf and feel the sun on his skin again. That opportunity finally came on December 23 — one day after his ban ended — against the Rocks at Boland Park in a Cricket SA 1-Day Cup clash. “With every game comes nerves, and the pressure of consistency, so there was always going to be that pressure and nerves, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.” he said. “Just to be out on the park again. I didn’t score runs in the game, but I certainly enjoyed being out there, the chatter that happens between colleagues. I enjoy the WP squad and the relationships that have been built up.” For all the camaraderie and the appreciation of being able to enjoy playing the game he loves again, Hamza is a professional that knows the currency of a batter is runs. And they were not coming. His duck in the CSA 1-Day Cup final against the Lions was particularly galling, especially as it was WP’s first domestic final in eight years. Therefore, the return to the Wanderers after a couple of months of feeling bat on ball again out in the middle was extra special, particularly when he struck his first century since the suspension. A couple of half-centuries against the Warriors in the final game of the season have since followed the 129, which seemingly suggests Hamza is approaching his best form again. “It was emotional and extremely joyous at the same time. These are things that if you want to achieve the goals that you set for yourself, then at some point it has to become an obsession. When you have nine months of doing nothing, then you start to obsess a little. I really enjoyed that moment,” Hamza said. “From a preparation point of view, I thought I put in the hours. I think there might have been the difference between training in the nets and competing at a professional level, especially with the high stakes of a trophy on the line. “But it feels good now. It has been a good experience. Unfortunately I’ve just started to get going now, and scoring some runs, and it's the end of the season.” The path ahead is unclear for Hamza, now 27 years old, but he admits that “I would be lying” if thoughts about returning to Shukri Conrad’s Proteas Test squad have not entered his mind. Coincidentally, they also don’t play for another nine months. And as Hamza can attest to, that can be life-changing. @ ZaahierAdams IOL Sport Share","pubDate":"2023-03-18

गया। इस मैच में रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर ने गुजरात जायंट्स को 8 विकेट से हरा प्लेऑफ में जाने की अपनी उम्मीदों को जिंदा रखा है। आरसीबी के लिए यह मैच करो या मरो का था। इस मैच में मिली जीत के बाद आरसीबी की टीम ने मानों वह लय हासिल कर ली है जो वह सीजन के शुरुआत से हासिल करना चाह रही थी। आरसीबी की जीत में सोफी डिवाइन का सबसे बड़ा योगदान रहा। उन्होंने इस मैच में अपनी पारी से फैंस का दिल जीत लिया। सोफी डिवाइन ने बल्ले के साथ-साथ गेंद से भी कमाल करते हुए आरसीबी को जीत दिलाई। सोफी डिवाइन में इस मुकाबले में 99 रनों की पारी खेली। उन्होंने अपनी इस पारी के दौरान सिर्फ 36 गेंदों का सामना किया। 9 चौके और 8 छक्कों से सजी इस पारी ने मैदान में बैठे हर फैंस का दिल जीत लिया। उनकी इस पारी के बाद मैदान में बैठा हर दर्शक उनके लिए ताली बजा रहा था। फैंस सोशल मीडिया पर भी उनकी इस पारी को लेकर जमकर तारीफ कर रहे थे। रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर और गुजरात जायंट्स के बीच खेले गए इस मैच में गुजरात जायंट्स ने टॉस जीतकर बल्लेबाजी का फैसला किया। पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने निर्धारित 20 ओवर में 4 विकेट खोकर 188 रन बना डाले। मैच की पहली पारी में लौरा वोल्वार्ट (68) और एशले गार्डनर (41) ने शानदार पारी खेली। इन दोनों खिलाड़ियों के दमपर गुजरात जायंट्स ने एक चुनौतीपूर्ण टारगेट सेट कर दिया। इस दौरान आरसीबी की सोफी डिवाइन ने 23 रन देकर एक विकेट लिया। 189 रनों के टारगेट का पीछा कर रही आरसीबी की ओर से कप्तान स्मृति मंधाना और सोफी डिवाइन ने शानदार शुरुआत करते हुए टीम के स्कोर को 10वें ओवर में ही 125 तक पहुंचा दिया। टीम ने पहला विकेट स्मृति के रूप में 125 के स्कोर पर गंवाया। लेकिन तब तक बहुत देर हो चुकी थी। क्योंकी दूसरी छोर से सोफी डिवाइन ताबड़तोड़ बल्लेबाजी कर रही थी। हालांकि 12वें ओवर में वह 99 रन बनाकर आउट हो गई। लेकिन टीम के लिए एक ऐसी पारी खेल गई जिसने उन्हें अभी भी प्लेऑफ की रेस में बनाए रखा है। उनकी टीम को फाइनल में जाने के लिए अपने अगले मैच को जीतना होगा वहीं उन्हें यह उम्मीद करनी होगी की यूपी वारियर्स अपने आगले सभी मैच हार जाए। ऐसे में आरसीबी प्लेऑफ के लिए अभी भी क्वालीफाई कर सकती है।","pubDate":"2023-03-18

[…]","content":"Published on By Royal College skipper Dasis Manchanayake became the 27th batsman from his school to have scored a century at the historic Battle of the Blues when he entered the record books with a knock of 137 runs on day one of the 144th Big Match against S. Thomas’ on Thursday. Moments after the skipper ended a seven-year wait for a batsman from Reid Avenue to score a century, Ramiru Perera joined the list scoring 128 runs. The duo were involved in a record-breaking fifth wicket partnership that helped them recover to post a commanding total after being four wickets down for 63 runs in the morning. After Pasindu Sooriyabandara scored a debut century at the 2016 Big Match no Royalist had passed the three-figure mark until Thursday. Manchanayake had played the lead role in the Royal batting lineup throughout this season. In fact, he earned the rare honour of scoring 1000 runs for the season this year. It included a double century as well. Not many Royalists have scored that many runs in the 144-year-old history of the college. He scored 1059 runs at an average of 62.20. According to Royal statisticians there had been 19 Royalists who had scored over 1000 runs for the season but only five of them had averaged over 50. Since 2000, 12 Royalist batsmen had scored over 1000 runs but only Bhanuka Rajapaksa (in 2009: 1184 runs in 15 matches at 53.81) and Sooriyabandara (in 2019: 1257 runs in 16 matches at 83.80) had averaged above 50. Of the others, R.S. Madugalle (1979: 1207 runs in 16 matches at 71.00), S. Warnakulasuriya (1981: 1308 runs in 16 matches at 76.94) and C. Amerasinghe (1983: 1329 runs in 17 matches at 73.83) stand out for their outstanding averages. When this edition was ready for press, Manchanayake had backed his century with a half-century in the second innings and had given Royal the complete command in the match. Not many Royalists who had scored thousand runs for the season had scored centuries in the Big Match. C.J. Fernando in 1971 (160n.o), A. Polonnowita in 1996 (165), S. Senaratne in 2006 (104) ND Ramith Rambukwella in 2012 (127) are the only other batsman to have followed up their 1000 runs with centuries in the Big Match. More than anything else what makes Manchanayake’s century so special is the impact it had on the match. On paper, the Thomians were the team that had the edge and when he was joined by Ramiru Perera Royal were four wickets down for 63 runs. He was positive from the word go and remained so until Royal took a firm grip of the game. Published on By Over the years, we have seen the cricket team rebuilding after an extended period of poor run and when that happens a few seniors are given the cold shoulder. Although these tough decisions are taken with the best interest of the game in mind, there have been occasions that some selectors have settled old scores. Rebuilding at times don’t go to plan. Sometimes they backfire and the very players whom you have dropped prove yourself wrong scoring heavily either in domestic cricket or in a different format of international cricket. At times these players are recalled but when that happens the selectors who had dropped them have moved on and a new set have taken over. This time though it’s quite different as the same selectors who introduced the aggressive youth policy have taken a step back, either they are honest people who have realized their mistake or they are desperate given the dreadful scenario facing the ODI outfit. Sri Lanka need to win three out of three games in New Zealand if they are to qualify automatically for the World Cup or else they will have to play the qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June. Mathews is going to be a crucial cog in the wheel as Sri Lanka ensure that they keep their World Cup record intact having played in all editions of the tournament since the inaugural one in 1975. In Trivandrum early this year, Sri Lanka were shot out for 73 runs after India had posted 390 for five in their 50 overs. It was a massive 317 run defeat, the heaviest in the history of ODI cricket by any team. Having seen that the selectors have got cold feet and were left with Hobson’s choice but to recall Mathews, who has scored nearly 6000 runs at an average of over 41. There are many questions about the selectors’ choices. Carried away by their youth policy they played T20 players in the ODI format and today those players can’t even find a place in the T20 side. Bhanuka Rajapaksa is a case in point. Plus they experimented with too many all-rounders and still too many of them have persevered eventhough results have been pretty ordinary. It’s the same policy that England tried out for so long when they were pathetic in limited overs cricket two decades ago. Sadly, our selectors have borrowed a leaf out of England. Mathews selection is certainly a step in the right direction but much more needs to be done moving forward. Kusal Janith Perera, who hasn’t played any international cricket since November 2021 is also back in the reckoning after shoulder surgery. He’ll initially feature only in T20s but soon should come into the ODI mix too as Sri Lanka try to qualify for the World Cup.

The veteran Kiwi demonstrated all her famed power as she just missed out on the first-ever century in the new Women’s Premier League, blitzing 99 off just 36 balls in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Giants on Saturday. Earlier at the other WPL venue in Mumbai, the DY Patil Stadium, Alyssa Healy’s UP Warriorz became the first team to beat the table-topping Mumbai Indians, with some robust hitting from her Australian compatriots Grace Harris and Tahlia McGrath helping them to a five-wicket win.

Devine’s power hitting was remarkable, as she clattered 84 in boundaries. She was selfless too, getting caught at mid-off while still trying to boom one over the top in a bid to smash RCB to the quickest possible victory to help their net run-rate, rather than stroking a simple single that would have eased her to the first three-figure score in the league. She crushed one six into the upper-tier of the stand and admitted afterwards that watching Australian allrounder Ash Gardner crack a six and six fours in her 26-ball 41 for the Giants had been a bit of an education. “It’s been good to see how other batters go about it. So even just watching Ash bat, I learned a lot and just took out the best bits and applied it to how I wanted to bat,” said Devine. Unfortunately for Gardner, Devine also took a fancy to her off-spin, smashing her for 24 off her first over as the Aussie star ended up going for 48 off three. “Most of the time when I’ve seen her bat like that, it’s been playing against her. So for me selfishly, it’s nice to be on her side tonight,” smiled Perry, who guided RCB home with 19no. “There are few people who can do what she did tonight but she’s been doing it consistently for years and what she did tonight was special. “That last shot where she got out typifies Sophie. It’s not about runs for her but playing for the team. To be going for a big shot on 99 when cover was open for a single, it speaks volumes to her character as a person.” Devine’s innings has kept RCB in the chase for one of the three play-off places as has UP’s successful chase of Mumbai’s 127, which owed much to McGrath’s 38 off 25 balls and Harris’s 39 from 28.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 23:50:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Proteas’ run chase falls short despite brilliant century by captain Temba Bavuma","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas/proteas-run-chase-falls-short-despite-brilliant-century-by-captain-temba-bavuma-574cbcaf-7dad-4bd1-b02f-4becf752a842","keywords":null,"creator":["Ongama Gcwabe"],"video_url":null,"description":"Proteas’ captain Temba Bavuma scored a brilliant 144 at Buffalo Park on Saturday, but it was not enough as the West Indies won the second ODI by 48 runs.","content":"Gqeberha — South Africa fell 48 runs shy from what would have been a fourth highest successful run chase despite a third three-figure score of the year from the captain, Temba Bavuma. Despite the beautiful 48 from Quinton de Kock, there was no other Proteas batter that steadily and confidently held an end alongside Temba Bavuma in the mammoth run chase of 339 runs in Buffalo Park. De Kock’s knock promised to be the innings that would turn things around for the wicket-keeper batter but once again, he gave a teaser that reminded everyone that he is still box office quality. The left hander struck five 4s and three sixes in his 26-ball stay at the crease before he was trapped leg-before wicket by Kyle Mayers, leaving the former captain visibly upset with himself for lapsing in concentration. A partnership of 76 was broken and in came debutant Tony de Zorzi. De Zorzi stayed as long as De Kock at the crease but managed 27 in his stay. Rassie van der Dussen and Tristan Stubbs fell for single figure scores while all this time Temba Bavuma was edging closer to a third century of the year. Bavuma was his typical, classy self on his way to 144 off 117 balls. He stayed the cause and let De Kock have a go at West Indies opening bowlers while he kept the score board ticking with singles, hitting the occasional boundary when the bowlers dished out freebies. He brought up his third international hundred of the year and pushed the game to the last ten overs of the innings. Bavuma gloved an Alzarri Joseph slower ball bouncer back to the safe hands of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps. At some point, there was belief that Bavuma and Lungi Ngidi (12* off 23) might just carry South Africa to victory as the pair put on a highest nineth wicket partnership at Buffalo Park in ODIs, worth 49 off 46 balls. Joseph accounted for Tabraiz Shamsi in the same over and won the match for the West Indies by 48 runs. Earlier, Shai Hope’s unbeaten 128 and Rovman Powell’s 46 pushed the West Indies to 335/8 in their allotted 50 overs. Debutant, Gerald Coetzee, was pick of the bowlers for South Africa with figures of 3/57 and was followed by Bjorn Fortuin’s 2/57. It was truly the captain’s day in East London as they both put on inspirational batting performances as they lead squads in rebuilding phase.

With Multan needing four runs off the last ball - bowled by Zaman Khan - Khusdil Shah was run out while attempting a third run that would have tied Lahore's total of 200-6. Instead Multan finished on 199-8 to see them lose out to Lahore again in a repeat of last year's final. The Qalanders are the first team in PSL history to retain the title. Captain Shaheen Shah Afridi was influential throughout, securing Player of the Match honours after smashing five sixes and two boundaries in a belligerent 44 not out off just 15 balls at the back-end of the Lahore innings, and then the left-arm pace bowler following that up with four wickets in the final overs to finish with figures of 4-51. Shaheen's initial efforts with the bat helped catapult Lahore to what only just proved to be a match-winning score. When he came to the crease, the Qalanders were reeling at 111-4 after a run of four wickets for 17 runs in the space of three overs - Kent and England's Sam Billings among them, out for nine. But Shaheen and Abdullah Shafique, who anchored the innings superbly with 65 of 40 balls, proceeded to plunder a staggering 85 runs off the final five overs to fire Lahore up to 200. In reply, Rilee Rossouw (52 off 32 balls) hit a fine fifty to keep Multan on top of the required run rate, and though Mohammad Rizwan (34 off 23), Kieron Pollard (19 off 16) and Tim David (20 off 16) had their moments, a steady stream of wickets made things increasingly tougher for the Sultans - Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan chipping in with 2-26.

Nor will they know about the relationship he is developing with Nicholas. “It’s humbling to be in the position where you can make even the smallest difference,” Luai said. “None of this is about me.

Greenberg said there was “nothing for them [the NRL] to be edgy about”. “Just a sounding board during his most difficult and lonely times,” he said. “He’s [Newton] a good man and he’s doing a tough job so wanted to make sure he was going OK.” League to the rescue The promised federal government investment must be huge – well into the millions – because that’s the only way to justify the narrative that rugby league is going to bring peace to the Pacific.

Zubayr Hamza is called aside to take a routine drugs test. He has performed this action numerous times during his career. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. But yet it is. Two months later upon the release of the results it emerges that Hamza has tested positive for a prohibited substance under the ICC's anti-doping code. How was it even possible? Was it recreational? Was it performance enhancing? These were the questions floating around while Hamza’s career was at a crossroads. The stylish batter had only just returned to the Proteas squad, having played a Test in New Zealand after also striking a maiden half-century on his ODI debut a couple of months earlier. Everything was seemingly on the rise again, but suddenly it seemed like his entire world was imploding. Hamza’s forward defence was that it was an unintentional act. He had simply taken the wrong medication. It was discovered later that Furosemide — a drug prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure and edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) — was found in his bloodstream. Unfortunately for Hamza, it is also a masking agent on the World Anti-Doping (Wada) list of prohibited substances, and he would still have to serve a ban. Hamza’s suspension was ultimately reduced to nine months from the prescribed two-year sentence. It was still an arduous long time with a home Test series against Bangladesh and a blue-chip tour to England that he would now miss. Hamza, who had played six Tests since his debut against Pakistan in 2019, was not allowed to pick up a bat from March 22, 2022, until his return to competitive cricket three days before Christmas last year. During this period Hamza was uncontactable. A likeable, social individual, he became reclusive. Rumours circulated that the Protea may not even return to the game at all. “There was a lot of self doubt. Dark times, so to speak,” Hamza exclusively told IOL Sport this week at Newlands, Cape Town. “A lot of retrospection. A lot of answers to questions I needed to answer. “It was by no means an easy period in my life, and not just my career. I learnt a lot of lessons about myself. During that period there were definitely doubts, and some tough questions whether I would make it back.” But while Hamza shut out the rest of the world, he leaned heavily on those closest to him. And that’s how he began his rehabilitation process. From being spotted on the golf course to attending Cape Town City FC matches, Hamza was slowly emerging from seclusion. It also helped that his introspection was starting to take shape. “I have always kept my circle small and close. People that I trust, who always want the best for me. During that time those people played a massive role in keeping my mind off things at that point. There are also a few close teammates that I have played with for a very long time who know me better than I know myself,” Hamza said. “In terms of how I was going to go about my career, and what I still wanted to achieve, fortunately I found the answers to those things. The goals would always remain simple. As out of this world it might be, it is something that I enjoy challenging myself with. I am where I am now (because of the process), and to be honest, I’ve slightly enjoyed the process.” The next step was his reintegration into the Western Province dressing room. In his absence, Tony de Zorzi had taken over the mantle as the team’s premier batter, which included a historic triple century at Newlands and was now actually pushing for Hamza’s Proteas Test spot higher up, while Kyle Verreynne had taken over the leadership reins. But the peripherals were not Hamza’s focus. He just wanted to get back out on the turf and feel the sun on his skin again. That opportunity finally came on December 23 — one day after his ban ended — against the Rocks at Boland Park in a Cricket SA 1-Day Cup clash. “With every game comes nerves, and the pressure of consistency, so there was always going to be that pressure and nerves, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.” he said. “Just to be out on the park again. I didn’t score runs in the game, but I certainly enjoyed being out there, the chatter that happens between colleagues. I enjoy the WP squad and the relationships that have been built up.” For all the camaraderie and the appreciation of being able to enjoy playing the game he loves again, Hamza is a professional that knows the currency of a batter is runs. And they were not coming. His duck in the CSA 1-Day Cup final against the Lions was particularly galling, especially as it was WP’s first domestic final in eight years. Therefore, the return to the Wanderers after a couple of months of feeling bat on ball again out in the middle was extra special, particularly when he struck his first century since the suspension. A couple of half-centuries against the Warriors in the final game of the season have since followed the 129, which seemingly suggests Hamza is approaching his best form again. “It was emotional and extremely joyous at the same time. These are things that if you want to achieve the goals that you set for yourself, then at some point it has to become an obsession. When you have nine months of doing nothing, then you start to obsess a little. I really enjoyed that moment,” Hamza said. “From a preparation point of view, I thought I put in the hours. I think there might have been the difference between training in the nets and competing at a professional level, especially with the high stakes of a trophy on the line. “But it feels good now. It has been a good experience. Unfortunately I’ve just started to get going now, and scoring some runs, and it's the end of the season.” The path ahead is unclear for Hamza, now 27 years old, but he admits that “I would be lying” if thoughts about returning to Shukri Conrad’s Proteas Test squad have not entered his mind. Coincidentally, they also don’t play for another nine months. And as Hamza can attest to, that can be life-changing. @ ZaahierAdams IOL Sport Share","pubDate":"2023-03-18

गया। इस मैच में रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर ने गुजरात जायंट्स को 8 विकेट से हरा प्लेऑफ में जाने की अपनी उम्मीदों को जिंदा रखा है। आरसीबी के लिए यह मैच करो या मरो का था। इस मैच में मिली जीत के बाद आरसीबी की टीम ने मानों वह लय हासिल कर ली है जो वह सीजन के शुरुआत से हासिल करना चाह रही थी। आरसीबी की जीत में सोफी डिवाइन का सबसे बड़ा योगदान रहा। उन्होंने इस मैच में अपनी पारी से फैंस का दिल जीत लिया। सोफी डिवाइन ने बल्ले के साथ-साथ गेंद से भी कमाल करते हुए आरसीबी को जीत दिलाई। सोफी डिवाइन में इस मुकाबले में 99 रनों की पारी खेली। उन्होंने अपनी इस पारी के दौरान सिर्फ 36 गेंदों का सामना किया। 9 चौके और 8 छक्कों से सजी इस पारी ने मैदान में बैठे हर फैंस का दिल जीत लिया। उनकी इस पारी के बाद मैदान में बैठा हर दर्शक उनके लिए ताली बजा रहा था। फैंस सोशल मीडिया पर भी उनकी इस पारी को लेकर जमकर तारीफ कर रहे थे। रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर और गुजरात जायंट्स के बीच खेले गए इस मैच में गुजरात जायंट्स ने टॉस जीतकर बल्लेबाजी का फैसला किया। पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने निर्धारित 20 ओवर में 4 विकेट खोकर 188 रन बना डाले। मैच की पहली पारी में लौरा वोल्वार्ट (68) और एशले गार्डनर (41) ने शानदार पारी खेली। इन दोनों खिलाड़ियों के दमपर गुजरात जायंट्स ने एक चुनौतीपूर्ण टारगेट सेट कर दिया। इस दौरान आरसीबी की सोफी डिवाइन ने 23 रन देकर एक विकेट लिया। 189 रनों के टारगेट का पीछा कर रही आरसीबी की ओर से कप्तान स्मृति मंधाना और सोफी डिवाइन ने शानदार शुरुआत करते हुए टीम के स्कोर को 10वें ओवर में ही 125 तक पहुंचा दिया। टीम ने पहला विकेट स्मृति के रूप में 125 के स्कोर पर गंवाया। लेकिन तब तक बहुत देर हो चुकी थी। क्योंकी दूसरी छोर से सोफी डिवाइन ताबड़तोड़ बल्लेबाजी कर रही थी। हालांकि 12वें ओवर में वह 99 रन बनाकर आउट हो गई। लेकिन टीम के लिए एक ऐसी पारी खेल गई जिसने उन्हें अभी भी प्लेऑफ की रेस में बनाए रखा है। उनकी टीम को फाइनल में जाने के लिए अपने अगले मैच को जीतना होगा वहीं उन्हें यह उम्मीद करनी होगी की यूपी वारियर्स अपने आगले सभी मैच हार जाए। ऐसे में आरसीबी प्लेऑफ के लिए अभी भी क्वालीफाई कर सकती है।","pubDate":"2023-03-18

[…]","content":"Published on By Royal College skipper Dasis Manchanayake became the 27th batsman from his school to have scored a century at the historic Battle of the Blues when he entered the record books with a knock of 137 runs on day one of the 144th Big Match against S. Thomas’ on Thursday. Moments after the skipper ended a seven-year wait for a batsman from Reid Avenue to score a century, Ramiru Perera joined the list scoring 128 runs. The duo were involved in a record-breaking fifth wicket partnership that helped them recover to post a commanding total after being four wickets down for 63 runs in the morning. After Pasindu Sooriyabandara scored a debut century at the 2016 Big Match no Royalist had passed the three-figure mark until Thursday. Manchanayake had played the lead role in the Royal batting lineup throughout this season. In fact, he earned the rare honour of scoring 1000 runs for the season this year. It included a double century as well. Not many Royalists have scored that many runs in the 144-year-old history of the college. He scored 1059 runs at an average of 62.20. According to Royal statisticians there had been 19 Royalists who had scored over 1000 runs for the season but only five of them had averaged over 50. Since 2000, 12 Royalist batsmen had scored over 1000 runs but only Bhanuka Rajapaksa (in 2009: 1184 runs in 15 matches at 53.81) and Sooriyabandara (in 2019: 1257 runs in 16 matches at 83.80) had averaged above 50. Of the others, R.S. Madugalle (1979: 1207 runs in 16 matches at 71.00), S. Warnakulasuriya (1981: 1308 runs in 16 matches at 76.94) and C. Amerasinghe (1983: 1329 runs in 17 matches at 73.83) stand out for their outstanding averages. When this edition was ready for press, Manchanayake had backed his century with a half-century in the second innings and had given Royal the complete command in the match. Not many Royalists who had scored thousand runs for the season had scored centuries in the Big Match. C.J. Fernando in 1971 (160n.o), A. Polonnowita in 1996 (165), S. Senaratne in 2006 (104) ND Ramith Rambukwella in 2012 (127) are the only other batsman to have followed up their 1000 runs with centuries in the Big Match. More than anything else what makes Manchanayake’s century so special is the impact it had on the match. On paper, the Thomians were the team that had the edge and when he was joined by Ramiru Perera Royal were four wickets down for 63 runs. He was positive from the word go and remained so until Royal took a firm grip of the game. Published on By Over the years, we have seen the cricket team rebuilding after an extended period of poor run and when that happens a few seniors are given the cold shoulder. Although these tough decisions are taken with the best interest of the game in mind, there have been occasions that some selectors have settled old scores. Rebuilding at times don’t go to plan. Sometimes they backfire and the very players whom you have dropped prove yourself wrong scoring heavily either in domestic cricket or in a different format of international cricket. At times these players are recalled but when that happens the selectors who had dropped them have moved on and a new set have taken over. This time though it’s quite different as the same selectors who introduced the aggressive youth policy have taken a step back, either they are honest people who have realized their mistake or they are desperate given the dreadful scenario facing the ODI outfit. Sri Lanka need to win three out of three games in New Zealand if they are to qualify automatically for the World Cup or else they will have to play the qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June. Mathews is going to be a crucial cog in the wheel as Sri Lanka ensure that they keep their World Cup record intact having played in all editions of the tournament since the inaugural one in 1975. In Trivandrum early this year, Sri Lanka were shot out for 73 runs after India had posted 390 for five in their 50 overs. It was a massive 317 run defeat, the heaviest in the history of ODI cricket by any team. Having seen that the selectors have got cold feet and were left with Hobson’s choice but to recall Mathews, who has scored nearly 6000 runs at an average of over 41. There are many questions about the selectors’ choices. Carried away by their youth policy they played T20 players in the ODI format and today those players can’t even find a place in the T20 side. Bhanuka Rajapaksa is a case in point. Plus they experimented with too many all-rounders and still too many of them have persevered eventhough results have been pretty ordinary. It’s the same policy that England tried out for so long when they were pathetic in limited overs cricket two decades ago. Sadly, our selectors have borrowed a leaf out of England. Mathews selection is certainly a step in the right direction but much more needs to be done moving forward. Kusal Janith Perera, who hasn’t played any international cricket since November 2021 is also back in the reckoning after shoulder surgery. He’ll initially feature only in T20s but soon should come into the ODI mix too as Sri Lanka try to qualify for the World Cup.

The veteran Kiwi demonstrated all her famed power as she just missed out on the first-ever century in the new Women’s Premier League, blitzing 99 off just 36 balls in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Giants on Saturday. Earlier at the other WPL venue in Mumbai, the DY Patil Stadium, Alyssa Healy’s UP Warriorz became the first team to beat the table-topping Mumbai Indians, with some robust hitting from her Australian compatriots Grace Harris and Tahlia McGrath helping them to a five-wicket win. Sophie Devine. Credit: Getty Images But it was as nothing compared to the late game at Brabourne Stadium, as the 33-year-old Devine smashed eight sixes with RCB making light work of the Giants’ 4-188, reaching their target on 2-189 with 27 balls to spare. Devine’s power hitting was remarkable, as she clattered 84 in boundaries. She was selfless too, getting caught at mid-off while still trying to boom one over the top in a bid to smash RCB to the quickest possible victory to help their net run-rate, rather than stroking a simple single that would have eased her to the first three-figure score in the league. She crushed one six into the upper-tier of the stand and admitted afterwards that watching Australian allrounder Ash Gardner crack a six and six fours in her 26-ball 41 for the Giants had been a bit of an education. “It’s been good to see how other batters go about it. So even just watching Ash bat, I learned a lot and just took out the best bits and applied it to how I wanted to bat,” said Devine. Unfortunately for Gardner, Devine also took a fancy to her off-spin, smashing her for 24 off her first over as the Aussie star ended up going for 48 off three. “Most of the time when I’ve seen her bat like that, it’s been playing against her. So for me selfishly, it’s nice to be on her side tonight,” smiled Perry, who guided RCB home with 19no. “There are few people who can do what she did tonight but she’s been doing it consistently for years and what she did tonight was special. “That last shot where she got out typifies Sophie. It’s not about runs for her but playing for the team. To be going for a big shot on 99 when cover was open for a single, it speaks volumes to her character as a person.” Devine’s innings has kept RCB in the chase for one of the three play-off places as has UP’s successful chase of Mumbai’s 127, which owed much to McGrath’s 38 off 25 balls and Harris’s 39 from 28.","pubDate":"2023-03-18 23:50:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Proteas’ run chase falls short despite brilliant century by captain Temba Bavuma","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas/proteas-run-chase-falls-short-despite-brilliant-century-by-captain-temba-bavuma-574cbcaf-7dad-4bd1-b02f-4becf752a842","keywords":null,"creator":["Ongama Gcwabe"],"video_url":null,"description":"Proteas’ captain Temba Bavuma scored a brilliant 144 at Buffalo Park on Saturday, but it was not enough as the West Indies won the second ODI by 48 runs.","content":"Gqeberha — South Africa fell 48 runs shy from what would have been a fourth highest successful run chase despite a third three-figure score of the year from the captain, Temba Bavuma. Despite the beautiful 48 from Quinton de Kock, there was no other Proteas batter that steadily and confidently held an end alongside Temba Bavuma in the mammoth run chase of 339 runs in Buffalo Park. De Kock’s knock promised to be the innings that would turn things around for the wicket-keeper batter but once again, he gave a teaser that reminded everyone that he is still box office quality. The left hander struck five 4s and three sixes in his 26-ball stay at the crease before he was trapped leg-before wicket by Kyle Mayers, leaving the former captain visibly upset with himself for lapsing in concentration. A partnership of 76 was broken and in came debutant Tony de Zorzi. De Zorzi stayed as long as De Kock at the crease but managed 27 in his stay. Rassie van der Dussen and Tristan Stubbs fell for single figure scores while all this time Temba Bavuma was edging closer to a third century of the year. Bavuma was his typical, classy self on his way to 144 off 117 balls. He stayed the cause and let De Kock have a go at West Indies opening bowlers while he kept the score board ticking with singles, hitting the occasional boundary when the bowlers dished out freebies. He brought up his third international hundred of the year and pushed the game to the last ten overs of the innings. Bavuma gloved an Alzarri Joseph slower ball bouncer back to the safe hands of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps. At some point, there was belief that Bavuma and Lungi Ngidi (12* off 23) might just carry South Africa to victory as the pair put on a highest nineth wicket partnership at Buffalo Park in ODIs, worth 49 off 46 balls. Joseph accounted for Tabraiz Shamsi in the same over and won the match for the West Indies by 48 runs. Earlier, Shai Hope’s unbeaten 128 and Rovman Powell’s 46 pushed the West Indies to 335/8 in their allotted 50 overs. Debutant, Gerald Coetzee, was pick of the bowlers for South Africa with figures of 3/57 and was followed by Bjorn Fortuin’s 2/57. It was truly the captain’s day in East London as they both put on inspirational batting performances as they lead squads in rebuilding phase.

With Multan needing four runs off the last ball - bowled by Zaman Khan - Khusdil Shah was run out while attempting a third run that would have tied Lahore's total of 200-6. Instead Multan finished on 199-8 to see them lose out to Lahore again in a repeat of last year's final. The Qalanders are the first team in PSL history to retain the title. Captain Shaheen Shah Afridi was influential throughout, securing Player of the Match honours after smashing five sixes and two boundaries in a belligerent 44 not out off just 15 balls at the back-end of the Lahore innings, and then the left-arm pace bowler following that up with four wickets in the final overs to finish with figures of 4-51. Shaheen's initial efforts with the bat helped catapult Lahore to what only just proved to be a match-winning score. When he came to the crease, the Qalanders were reeling at 111-4 after a run of four wickets for 17 runs in the space of three overs - Kent and England's Sam Billings among them, out for nine. But Shaheen and Abdullah Shafique, who anchored the innings superbly with 65 of 40 balls, proceeded to plunder a staggering 85 runs off the final five overs to fire Lahore up to 200.

However, Nicholas Tadros is no ordinary kid. His toughness and resilience in the most awful of circumstances has made him just that for Penrith’s Jarome Luai – his hero. Nicholas is the boy who lost his mum and was seriously injured in the Sea World helicopter crash on January 2 in which four people died and nine were injured. Nicholas is the boy who lost his mum and was seriously injured in the Sea World helicopter crash on January 2 in which four people died and nine were injured. Nicholas is dealing with a lot, including the loss of a leg due to his injuries. When Luai was told he was the youngster’s hero, he couldn’t wait to help. “He is now my inspiration,” Luai said. “And I want to help him in any way I can.” Luai has his detractors – the line stretches around the block – but they don’t know the kind of work he does away from football. Nor will they know about the relationship he is developing with Nicholas. “It’s humbling to be in the position where you can make even the smallest difference,” Luai said. “None of this is about me. It puts life into perspective for me, and just knowing other people’s pressures, struggles and what they’re going through. “My heart is there for Nicholas.

They are all great people.” Finding the words to express yourself in that situation would be difficult for many. But not Luai. “I don’t make it up ... I’m just myself,” he said. “That’s the person he wanted to meet, the guy you see on the field. So I got there and put some music on and we played it throughout the hospital. The nurses were telling us to turn it down and be quiet, but you know what he’s been through, so you just have that right energy around him. I was just so blessed to be a part of that.” And for Luai it’s not a one-off. “We definitely are going to stay in touch,” he said. “We have a bit of a deal going on, when he’s well and he gets out he’s coming to watch us. He’s had a pretty tough surgery, so it was pretty cool to build a connection with him and his family.

Crichton wants to be back playing football as soon as possible, but his mental health is the priority of all of those around him. His family, the club and his agent, David Rawlings , are all rallying around him. Rawlings gave this column the following statement. Sidelined Roosters star Angus Crichton.

He was once the boss of the NRL, but now Todd Greenberg is treated with a degree of suspicion, and even fear, by those running the game as they try to nut out a deal with the Rugby League Players’ Association. It’s no secret that Greenberg and influential NRL figures are not the best of friends, and maybe that’s why the game has been rife with rumours Greenberg has been involved with the RLPA in its fight with the NRL as they look to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.

Newton strongly denied Greenberg was some kind of “puppet master”, saying their discussions had been limited to a number of text messages and he had been a mentor. Greenberg said there was “nothing for them [the NRL] to be edgy about”. “Just a sounding board during his most difficult and lonely times,” he said. “He’s [Newton] a good man and he’s doing a tough job so wanted to make sure he was going OK.” League to the rescue The promised federal government investment must be huge – well into the millions – because that’s the only way to justify the narrative that rugby league is going to bring peace to the Pacific. Without significant investment, it is hard to swallow. People smarter than this columnist say the code is being used to stop China getting a foothold in Papua New Guinea and becoming a threat to Australia; that if PNG gets an NRL team, the country will knock back Chinese investment. We don’t doubt the good intentions of PM and Rabbitohs tragic Anthony Albanese , who is pushing the idea. Even the suggestion that three more teams should be added to the competition – and that players could be recruited from the US to fill them – is hard to fathom. Loading A couple of years ago, a taskforce set up by the NRL recommended not to allow even one more team into the competition. When Peter V’landys became ARL Commission chairman he asked the committee to look at the idea again. It came back supporting expansion. Most of those involved have now left the NRL. At the time, the NRL suggested the key to growth was to lure Indian and Asian schoolchildren to the game. There is a strong expansion push for a Pacific team “based” in PNG but playing games in Townsville or Cairns, throughout the Pacific and at North Sydney Oval. It’s a head-scratcher. Expansion will occur only if teams from new areas play in those regions regularly. The AFL has taken a long-term approach to growing the code.

Zubayr Hamza is called aside to take a routine drugs test. He has performed this action numerous times during his career. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. But yet it is. Two months later upon the release of the results it emerges that Hamza has tested positive for a prohibited substance under the ICC's anti-doping code. How was it even possible? Was it recreational? Was it performance enhancing? These were the questions floating around while Hamza’s career was at a crossroads. The stylish batter had only just returned to the Proteas squad, having played a Test in New Zealand after also striking a maiden half-century on his ODI debut a couple of months earlier. Everything was seemingly on the rise again, but suddenly it seemed like his entire world was imploding. Hamza’s forward defence was that it was an unintentional act. He had simply taken the wrong medication. It was discovered later that Furosemide — a drug prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure and edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) — was found in his bloodstream. Unfortunately for Hamza, it is also a masking agent on the World Anti-Doping (Wada) list of prohibited substances, and he would still have to serve a ban. Hamza’s suspension was ultimately reduced to nine months from the prescribed two-year sentence. It was still an arduous long time with a home Test series against Bangladesh and a blue-chip tour to England that he would now miss. Hamza, who had played six Tests since his debut against Pakistan in 2019, was not allowed to pick up a bat from March 22, 2022, until his return to competitive cricket three days before Christmas last year. During this period Hamza was uncontactable. A likeable, social individual, he became reclusive. Rumours circulated that the Protea may not even return to the game at all. “There was a lot of self doubt. Dark times, so to speak,” Hamza exclusively told IOL Sport this week at Newlands, Cape Town. “A lot of retrospection. A lot of answers to questions I needed to answer. “It was by no means an easy period in my life, and not just my career. I learnt a lot of lessons about myself. During that period there were definitely doubts, and some tough questions whether I would make it back.” But while Hamza shut out the rest of the world, he leaned heavily on those closest to him. And that’s how he began his rehabilitation process. From being spotted on the golf course to attending Cape Town City FC matches, Hamza was slowly emerging from seclusion. It also helped that his introspection was starting to take shape. “I have always kept my circle small and close. People that I trust, who always want the best for me. During that time those people played a massive role in keeping my mind off things at that point. There are also a few close teammates that I have played with for a very long time who know me better than I know myself,” Hamza said. “In terms of how I was going to go about my career, and what I still wanted to achieve, fortunately I found the answers to those things. The goals would always remain simple. As out of this world it might be, it is something that I enjoy challenging myself with. I am where I am now (because of the process), and to be honest, I’ve slightly enjoyed the process.” The next step was his reintegration into the Western Province dressing room. In his absence, Tony de Zorzi had taken over the mantle as the team’s premier batter, which included a historic triple century at Newlands and was now actually pushing for Hamza’s Proteas Test spot higher up, while Kyle Verreynne had taken over the leadership reins. But the peripherals were not Hamza’s focus. He just wanted to get back out on the turf and feel the sun on his skin again. That opportunity finally came on December 23 — one day after his ban ended — against the Rocks at Boland Park in a Cricket SA 1-Day Cup clash. “With every game comes nerves, and the pressure of consistency, so there was always going to be that pressure and nerves, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.” he said. “Just to be out on the park again. I didn’t score runs in the game, but I certainly enjoyed being out there, the chatter that happens between colleagues. I enjoy the WP squad and the relationships that have been built up.” For all the camaraderie and the appreciation of being able to enjoy playing the game he loves again, Hamza is a professional that knows the currency of a batter is runs. And they were not coming. His duck in the CSA 1-Day Cup final against the Lions was particularly galling, especially as it was WP’s first domestic final in eight years. Therefore, the return to the Wanderers after a couple of months of feeling bat on ball again out in the middle was extra special, particularly when he struck his first century since the suspension. A couple of half-centuries against the Warriors in the final game of the season have since followed the 129, which seemingly suggests Hamza is approaching his best form again. “It was emotional and extremely joyous at the same time. These are things that if you want to achieve the goals that you set for yourself, then at some point it has to become an obsession. When you have nine months of doing nothing, then you start to obsess a little. I really enjoyed that moment,” Hamza said. “From a preparation point of view, I thought I put in the hours. I think there might have been the difference between training in the nets and competing at a professional level, especially with the high stakes of a trophy on the line. “But it feels good now. It has been a good experience. Unfortunately I’ve just started to get going now, and scoring some runs, and it's the end of the season.” The path ahead is unclear for Hamza, now 27 years old, but he admits that “I would be lying” if thoughts about returning to Shukri Conrad’s Proteas Test squad have not entered his mind. Coincidentally, they also don’t play for another nine months. And as Hamza can attest to, that can be life-changing. @ ZaahierAdams IOL Sport Share","pubDate":"2023-03-18 18:11:38","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/e6b82cf4-8b4f-54b0-81d6-5109ac066ab1&operation=CROP&offset=0x96&resize=2483x1397","source_id":"iol","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WPL 2023: 99 रन पर आउट होकर भी सोफी डिवाइन ने जीता फैंस का दिल, अब ऐसे फाइनल में पहुंचेगी RCB","link":"https://www.indiatv.in/sports/cricket/wpl-2023-rcb-beat-gujarat-giants-by-8-wickets-still-royal-challenger-bangalore-are-in-race-of-playoffs-2023-03-18-942806","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WPL 2023: आरसीबी ने महिला प्रीमियर लीग में खेले गए 16वें मुकाबले में गुजरात जायंट्स को 8 विकेट से हरा दिया। इस जीत के साथ वह प्लेऑफ की रेस में बने हुए हैं।","content":"आरसीबी ने महिला प्रीमियर लीग में खेले गए 16वें मुकाबले में गुजरात जायंट्स को 8 विकेट से हरा दिया। इस जीत के साथ वह प्लेऑफ की रेस में बने हुए हैं। महिला प्रीमियर लीग में रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर और गुजरात जायंट्स के बीच मुकाबला खेला गया। इस मैच में रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर ने गुजरात जायंट्स को 8 विकेट से हरा प्लेऑफ में जाने की अपनी उम्मीदों को जिंदा रखा है। आरसीबी के लिए यह मैच करो या मरो का था। इस मैच में मिली जीत के बाद आरसीबी की टीम ने मानों वह लय हासिल कर ली है जो वह सीजन के शुरुआत से हासिल करना चाह रही थी। आरसीबी की जीत में सोफी डिवाइन का सबसे बड़ा योगदान रहा। उन्होंने इस मैच में अपनी पारी से फैंस का दिल जीत लिया। सोफी डिवाइन ने बल्ले के साथ-साथ गेंद से भी कमाल करते हुए आरसीबी को जीत दिलाई। सोफी डिवाइन में इस मुकाबले में 99 रनों की पारी खेली। उन्होंने अपनी इस पारी के दौरान सिर्फ 36 गेंदों का सामना किया। 9 चौके और 8 छक्कों से सजी इस पारी ने मैदान में बैठे हर फैंस का दिल जीत लिया। उनकी इस पारी के बाद मैदान में बैठा हर दर्शक उनके लिए ताली बजा रहा था। फैंस सोशल मीडिया पर भी उनकी इस पारी को लेकर जमकर तारीफ कर रहे थे। रॉयल चैलेंजर्स बैंगलौर और गुजरात जायंट्स के बीच खेले गए इस मैच में गुजरात जायंट्स ने टॉस जीतकर बल्लेबाजी का फैसला किया। पहले बल्लेबाजी करते हुए गुजरात जायंट्स की टीम ने निर्धारित 20 ओवर में 4 विकेट खोकर 188 रन बना डाले। मैच की पहली पारी में लौरा वोल्वार्ट (68) और एशले गार्डनर (41) ने शानदार पारी खेली। इन दोनों खिलाड़ियों के दमपर गुजरात जायंट्स ने एक चुनौतीपूर्ण टारगेट सेट कर दिया। इस दौरान आरसीबी की सोफी डिवाइन ने 23 रन देकर एक विकेट लिया। 189 रनों के टारगेट का पीछा कर रही आरसीबी की ओर से कप्तान स्मृति मंधाना और सोफी डिवाइन ने शानदार शुरुआत करते हुए टीम के स्कोर को 10वें ओवर में ही 125 तक पहुंचा दिया। टीम ने पहला विकेट स्मृति के रूप में 125 के स्कोर पर गंवाया। लेकिन तब तक बहुत देर हो चुकी थी। क्योंकी दूसरी छोर से सोफी डिवाइन ताबड़तोड़ बल्लेबाजी कर रही थी। हालांकि 12वें ओवर में वह 99 रन बनाकर आउट हो गई। लेकिन टीम के लिए एक ऐसी पारी खेल गई जिसने उन्हें अभी भी प्लेऑफ की रेस में बनाए रखा है। उनकी टीम को फाइनल में जाने के लिए अपने अगले मैच को जीतना होगा वहीं उन्हें यह उम्मीद करनी होगी की यूपी वारियर्स अपने आगले सभी मैच हार जाए। ऐसे में आरसीबी प्लेऑफ के लिए अभी भी क्वालीफाई कर सकती है।","pubDate":"2023-03-18 18:07:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"}]}
