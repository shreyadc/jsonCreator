In Shaheen’s place, Pakistan roped in off-spinner Sajid Khan for the New Year’s Test. Sajid had joined the national team after Abrar Ahmed had injury concerns. \"We play for Test match cricket; we don't play for T20s or one-day cricket. If you're missing Test match cricket purely because you're being rested, I do not understand. That's a real shocker for me,\" Waqar was quoted as saying to the broadcasters before the match. As far as Shaheen is concerned, he picked up eight wickets from two matches at the Perth Stadium and the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. The after Abdullah Shafique dropped a simple catch on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. In the second innings of the Test, Shaheen also picked up a four-wicket haul, dismissing Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc. In 29 Tests until now since his debut back in December 2018, Shaheen has picked up 113 wickets with 12 four-wicket hauls, 4 five-wicket hauls and 1 10-wicket haul. Pakistan, in the meantime, are looking to avoid a series whitewash in Australia. Having lost their last 18 Tests on Australian soil, Shan Masood and Co. need to pull a rabbit out of the hat to secure victory. After losing the first Test by 360 runs in Perth, Pakistan fought hard in Melbourne. But they lost by 79 runs to concede the series. Pat Cummins picked up 10 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls to rock the visiting team.","pubDate":"2024-01-03 03:13:16","image_url":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/shaheen-afridi-285010330-16x9.jpg?VersionId=tYbnZYesYErd0onOBkexu9utUmLDe9AN","source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"7d5fc63250be1d734fc565e0268cc40f","title":"India's Predicted XI vs SA: Ashwin May Miss Out As Major Changes Expected","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sa-vs-ind-dream11-prediction-and-2nd-test-fantasy-tips-4786058","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa have won three of the last 5 Test matches against India.","content":"South Africa will face India in the 2nd Test of the Freedom Trophy 2023/24 on Wednesday, January 3, at Newlands in Cape Town, South Africa.

FirstCricket Staff January 03, 2024 08:28:31 IST India have lost in two successive World Test Championship finals. Reuters After Michael Vaughan called India an underachieving side that doesn’t “win anything” , another former international cricketer has slammed Team India for not performing to their potential. Former India opener Kris Srikkanth has said that India is an “over-rated” cricket team in Test cricket as many players from the current side have failed to live up to their expectations. Srikkanth’s rebuke came after India suffered an innings and 32 runs defeat to South Africa in the Centurion Test. He added that India did well in Tests under Virat Kohli who left captaincy in January 2022. “Test cricket, we are over-rated,” Srikkanth said in a video on his YouTube channel.

We dominated in England, we fought hard in South Africa, we won in Australia. We had a good phase for 2-4 years,” Srikkanth said. The ex-India player added that India need to forget the No. 1 ranking in ICC and focus should be on getting the results. “We have to forget ICC rankings. We are always 1-2, 1-2. It’s a combination of having over-rated cricketers and people who have not performed up to their potential. Or some players have not enough chances like Kuldeep (Yadav),” Srikkanth said. “If you want to be the best team, you should be capable of being the giants on home grounds. That is what we did when Rishabh Pant was firing. “But you can keep on saying that we scored in Australia, we scored in England. You can sing the same song; you won’t move forward if you rest on past laurels. You have to just look at how you have performed in the last two years, last 18 months.” Srikkanth also did not spare the limited-over side and added that India are an overrated side in T20Is as well. “In T20 cricket India are highly over-rated. ODI cricket, we are a fantastic team. What happens in ODIs, in the semifinals, finals, it’s just a one-off match. It’s a luck factor, a lot depends on luck in these matches. “I read Rohit Sharma’s statement, for a cricketer, the 50-over World Cup is a huge achievement. “We sometimes underperform in the knockout matches, in the semifinals and the final. But we are a gun side in ODI,” he shared.

Williamson missed last month’s ODI and T20 series against Bangladesh while he rehabilitated a knee injury sustained nine months ago. The 33-year-old recovered to play in the 50-over World Cup and a two-Test series in Bangladesh but was rested from white-ball commitments last month as a precaution. Williamson’s controlled return will include a rest in game three of the five-match Pakistan series starting on January 12. All-rounder Mitchell Santner will lead the Black Caps in that match in Dunedin. Opening batter Devon Conway returns after also missing both white ball series against Bangladesh, while pace bowlers Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson will both make their first international appearances since being injured during the World Cup. Seamer Kyle Jamieson and spinner Michael Bracewell were not considered because of ongoing injuries while a notable omission from the 15-man squad was allrounder Rachin Ravindra, who scored 578 runs at the World Cup. Coach Gary Stead said Ravindra was in need of rest. “Rachin’s a young player who has immense value to New Zealand Cricket and we therefore want to look after his wellbeing,” Stead said. “He’s the only player or staff member to have been touring non-stop for the past five months across five countries and that’s simply not sustainable. He’s still very much part of our thinking for the T20 World Cup in June and will come back into the reckoning for the T20 series against Australia in February.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2024-01-03 02:45:52","image_url":"https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/juj21a/article67700798.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_21._kane-williamson__2_1_62AFUH1C.jpg","source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"8cf7d0e8e75f845af0247a5b71edd943","title":"AUS vs PAK Sydney Test: फेयरवेल टेस्ट में बेटियों संग मैदान में उतरे डेविड वॉर्नर, तालियों से गूंजा पूरा स्टेडियम","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/david-warner-took-field-with-his-three-daughter-for-farewell-test-aus-vs-pak-sydney-test-2575927","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["शिव ठाकुर"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>David Warner:</strong> ऑस्ट्रेलिया और पाकिस्तान के बीच तीन मैचों की टेस्ट सीरीज का आखिरी मुकाबला सिडनी में शुरू हो चुका है. यह मुकाबला ऑस्ट्रेलिया के सलामी बल्लेबाज डेविड वॉर्नर के करियर का आखिरी रेड बॉल गेम भी है. इस मैच के बाद वॉर्नर फिर कभी टेस्ट जर्सी में नहीं दिखाई देंगे.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">अपने इस फेयरवेल टेस्ट में डेविड वॉर्नर की एंट्री बेहद ही आकर्षक रही. दरअसल, इस मैच से पहले राष्ट्रगान के लिए मैदान पर आते वक्त उनके साथ उनकी तीनों बेटियां मौजूद थी. यह देख पूरा स्टेडियम तालियों से गूंज उठा. सिडनी क्रिकेट ग्राउंड पर मौजूद दर्शकों से लेकर क्रिकेटर्स और कमेंटेटर्स तक तालियां बजाते रहे.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">David Warner with his daughters in his final Test.<br /><br />- Picture of the day ⭐ <a href=\"https://t.co/DzmruiQ7CO\">pic.twitter.com/DzmruiQ7CO</a></p> &mdash; Johns.

The Blackcaps are gearing up for their home series against the Men in Green and have named a squad for it with some key decisions made. Notably, three star players have made a return to the team with a CSK player missing out on selection. CSK's Rachin Ravindra has been rested out from the New Zealand squad for the 20-over series while is back to lead the side after a long break from the format. Notably, fast bowler Matt Henry and CSK's other star Devon Conway return to the team. However, several players are available for select games with Williamson not part of the third T20I to manage his knee. Uncapped Josh Clarkson is picked for only game number three, while Lockie Ferguson is not part of the first two matches. Ben Sears is available for those two games. Ravindra out after a late entry in the Bangladesh T20I series Ravindra was called in as a replacement for the team's last T20I assignment of 2023 against Bangladesh but was not picked in the Playing XI in any of the three T20Is. Ravindra had a terrific World Cup, where he had scored 578 runs from 10 matches, including three centuries. New Zealand Cricket confirmed Ravindra was not considered. \"Rachin Ravindra wasn’t considered as a replacement for Williamson in the third game, as he begins a period of rest after being on the road with the BLACKCAPS since the beginning of August, a decision made by NZC in conjunction with Cricket Wellington,\" NZC wrote. New Zealand coach Gary Stead said they wanted to give him rest and he is very much in the scheme of things for the T20 World Cup. Williamson returns after late withdrawal from Bangladesh T20Is Meanwhile, Williamson is back to lead the T20I side again after being withdrawn from the 20-over series against Bangladesh. He along with Kyle Jamieson were pulled out from the Bangladesh 20-over series on precautionary measures. Williamson last played a T20I back on 20th November 2022 after the T20 World Cup.

Winner: Darts Gifts don’t come any better than this. Luke Littler, aged just 16, has made the darts world championships final in a blaze of publicity that any sport can only dream of. Littler is a portly character with serious facial hair. He’s not what immediately springs to mind when you think of a 16-year-old. But 16 he is, and he has been blitzing all-comers in the world champs in London. He’s far too young to sound remotely interesting though. “I just wake up, play on my Xbox, have some food and have a chuck on the board, go to bed and that’s it,” he said of a typical day. Have no fear, the British tabloids are here. They have already stepped up to the task of star-making by promoting stories around Littler’s “glamorous” 21-year-old girlfriend. Loser: Rugby - where is Scott Robertson? Here’s a typical problem for a sport that only pays lip service to connecting with fans. Rugby does understand one thing - almost all of its eggs must go into the test rugby basket. All forms of rugby below test action have turned into losers in terms of mass appeal. That’s why the All Blacks will play a whopping 14 tests this year, and World Rugby has introduced a new quasi-World Cup from 2026. Yet in this country, we’ll still start the year with the normal diet of limp Super Rugby coverage while new All Blacks boss Scott Robertson remains parked in the background. Meanwhile, over in the Blue Corner, the Warriors grabbed a huge slice of the sporting spotlight last year without even trying that hard. Rugby league has its weaknesses but works because it is small enough to keep things very simple and move with the times. In contrast, rugby is so quaint that it goes on holiday over the holiday period, as if it can afford to take a break just weeks before the season kicks into gear. Here’s my best advice for a failing powerhouse: make the All Blacks front and centre of absolutely everything. It’s your only chance of survival. Loser: Cricket South Africa named a joke of a test squad to tour New Zealand , omitting a host of stars who play in its domestic T20 competition. Aussie great Mark Waugh suggested it was the “defining moment in the death of test cricket”. Waugh is on the mark except that test cricket outside of the Big Three has been in its death throes for ages. That’s why New Zealand hosts test matches in picnic areas. While Waugh quite reasonably reckoned New Zealand should tell South Africa to take a hike, it’s probably better to have some cricket than none at all. And New Zealand can hardly complain when it contrives to keep the great Trent Boult out of the test team. While this South African squad is a joke, the last laugh might be on us. The last hopeless sports team to visit New Zealand was a weak England netball squad that duly won the first test over the erratic Silver Ferns. And write South Africa cricket teams off at your peril - their cricketers come from a tough and very competitive environment. Loser: Cricket statistics/averages Further to the above … players’ averages will have to be taken with a grain of salt as test cricket descends into a sporting death zone alongside Super Rugby and co. Winners/Losers? Chris Wood and Nottingham Forest A wonderful few days on the pitch have been followed by a potential disaster off it for one of the clubs who will battle to avoid relegation from the English Premier League. Kiwi striker Wood had an incredible match against his old club Newcastle, taking Forest to victory with a hat-trick, a great moment for Kiwi football. Forest followed that up with a win over once-mighty Manchester United, putting handy distance between them and the bottom-three relegation zone. But Forest are reportedly in danger of having breached the EPL financial fair play regulations and thus face the threat of having points docked, as happened to Everton this season. Winner: Liverpool vs Newcastle A fantastic six-goal second half was a showcase of the EPL at its best. And a rejuvenated Liverpool have confirmed that they are quality challengers to Manchester City, who are facing a much tougher time defending their title than many expected. City will be buoyed by the sight of the great midfielder Kevin De Bruyne - who has been out with a long-term injury - warming up during the latest match against Sheffield United. He received a remarkable reception while limbering up, a reminder of the incredible passion that football inspires. Losers: Wayne Rooney and Birmingham City A short and disastrous managerial career at Birmingham City has come to an end for the fantastic former England player after just 15 games in charge. It always seemed a bit of an odd appointment, particularly as EPL-chasing Birmingham were reasonably placed in the football championship at the time. The club was just as keen on Rooney’s famous name as his abilities. Bad move. Winner: Vinesh Phogat The star Indian wrestler has continued to protest against the alleged sexual harassment of female athletes. Phogat, a courageous voice against sexist attitudes in sport, left two government awards on a kerbside after she was blocked from handing them back to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Winners … kind of: Detroit Pistons The Pistons ended a record-equalling 28-game losing streak with a victory over the underpowered Toronto Raptors. The Pistons duly lost their next game. Winner: Joseph Parker A belated congratulations to heavyweight boxer Joseph Parker on his victory over Deontay Wilder. Parker is back in the news and “back as a major player in the division” as one boxing website put it. Kiwi boxing had a terrific time in 2023, from Mea Motu and Lani Daniels’ rise to Parker’s surprise win.

In Shaheen’s place, Pakistan roped in off-spinner Sajid Khan for the New Year’s Test. Sajid had joined the national team after Abrar Ahmed had injury concerns. \"We play for Test match cricket; we don't play for T20s or one-day cricket. If you're missing Test match cricket purely because you're being rested, I do not understand. That's a real shocker for me,\" Waqar was quoted as saying to the broadcasters before the match. As far as Shaheen is concerned, he picked up eight wickets from two matches at the Perth Stadium and the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. The after Abdullah Shafique dropped a simple catch on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. In the second innings of the Test, Shaheen also picked up a four-wicket haul, dismissing Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc. In 29 Tests until now since his debut back in December 2018, Shaheen has picked up 113 wickets with 12 four-wicket hauls, 4 five-wicket hauls and 1 10-wicket haul. Pakistan, in the meantime, are looking to avoid a series whitewash in Australia. Having lost their last 18 Tests on Australian soil, Shan Masood and Co. need to pull a rabbit out of the hat to secure victory. After losing the first Test by 360 runs in Perth, Pakistan fought hard in Melbourne. But they lost by 79 runs to concede the series.

FirstCricket Staff January 03, 2024 08:28:31 IST India have lost in two successive World Test Championship finals. Reuters After Michael Vaughan called India an underachieving side that doesn’t “win anything” , another former international cricketer has slammed Team India for not performing to their potential. Former India opener Kris Srikkanth has said that India is an “over-rated” cricket team in Test cricket as many players from the current side have failed to live up to their expectations. Srikkanth’s rebuke came after India suffered an innings and 32 runs defeat to South Africa in the Centurion Test. He added that India did well in Tests under Virat Kohli who left captaincy in January 2022. “Test cricket, we are over-rated,” Srikkanth said in a video on his YouTube channel.

We dominated in England, we fought hard in South Africa, we won in Australia. We had a good phase for 2-4 years,” Srikkanth said. The ex-India player added that India need to forget the No. 1 ranking in ICC and focus should be on getting the results. “We have to forget ICC rankings. We are always 1-2, 1-2. It’s a combination of having over-rated cricketers and people who have not performed up to their potential. Or some players have not enough chances like Kuldeep (Yadav),” Srikkanth said. “If you want to be the best team, you should be capable of being the giants on home grounds. That is what we did when Rishabh Pant was firing. “But you can keep on saying that we scored in Australia, we scored in England. You can sing the same song; you won’t move forward if you rest on past laurels. You have to just look at how you have performed in the last two years, last 18 months.” Srikkanth also did not spare the limited-over side and added that India are an overrated side in T20Is as well. “In T20 cricket India are highly over-rated. ODI cricket, we are a fantastic team. What happens in ODIs, in the semifinals, finals, it’s just a one-off match. It’s a luck factor, a lot depends on luck in these matches. “I read Rohit Sharma’s statement, for a cricketer, the 50-over World Cup is a huge achievement. “We sometimes underperform in the knockout matches, in the semifinals and the final. But we are a gun side in ODI,” he shared.

Williamson missed last month’s ODI and T20 series against Bangladesh while he rehabilitated a knee injury sustained nine months ago. The 33-year-old recovered to play in the 50-over World Cup and a two-Test series in Bangladesh but was rested from white-ball commitments last month as a precaution. Williamson’s controlled return will include a rest in game three of the five-match Pakistan series starting on January 12. All-rounder Mitchell Santner will lead the Black Caps in that match in Dunedin. Opening batter Devon Conway returns after also missing both white ball series against Bangladesh, while pace bowlers Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson will both make their first international appearances since being injured during the World Cup. Seamer Kyle Jamieson and spinner Michael Bracewell were not considered because of ongoing injuries while a notable omission from the 15-man squad was allrounder Rachin Ravindra, who scored 578 runs at the World Cup. Coach Gary Stead said Ravindra was in need of rest. “Rachin’s a young player who has immense value to New Zealand Cricket and we therefore want to look after his wellbeing,” Stead said. “He’s the only player or staff member to have been touring non-stop for the past five months across five countries and that’s simply not sustainable. He’s still very much part of our thinking for the T20 World Cup in June and will come back into the reckoning for the T20 series against Australia in February.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2024-01-03 02:45:52","image_url":"https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/juj21a/article67700798.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_21._kane-williamson__2_1_62AFUH1C.jpg","source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"8cf7d0e8e75f845af0247a5b71edd943","title":"AUS vs PAK Sydney Test: फेयरवेल टेस्ट में बेटियों संग मैदान में उतरे डेविड वॉर्नर, तालियों से गूंजा पूरा स्टेडियम","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/david-warner-took-field-with-his-three-daughter-for-farewell-test-aus-vs-pak-sydney-test-2575927","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["शिव ठाकुर"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>David Warner:</strong> ऑस्ट्रेलिया और पाकिस्तान के बीच तीन मैचों की टेस्ट सीरीज का आखिरी मुकाबला सिडनी में शुरू हो चुका है. यह मुकाबला ऑस्ट्रेलिया के सलामी बल्लेबाज डेविड वॉर्नर के करियर का आखिरी रेड बॉल गेम भी है. इस मैच के बाद वॉर्नर फिर कभी टेस्ट जर्सी में नहीं दिखाई देंगे.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">अपने इस फेयरवेल टेस्ट में डेविड वॉर्नर की एंट्री बेहद ही आकर्षक रही. दरअसल, इस मैच से पहले राष्ट्रगान के लिए मैदान पर आते वक्त उनके साथ उनकी तीनों बेटियां मौजूद थी. यह देख पूरा स्टेडियम तालियों से गूंज उठा. सिडनी क्रिकेट ग्राउंड पर मौजूद दर्शकों से लेकर क्रिकेटर्स और कमेंटेटर्स तक तालियां बजाते रहे.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">David Warner with his daughters in his final Test.<br /><br />- Picture of the day ⭐ <a href=\"https://t.co/DzmruiQ7CO\">pic.twitter.com/DzmruiQ7CO</a></p> &mdash; Johns.

Uncapped Josh Clarkson is picked for only game number three, while Lockie Ferguson is not part of the first two matches. Ben Sears is available for those two games. Ravindra out after a late entry in the Bangladesh T20I series Ravindra was called in as a replacement for the team's last T20I assignment of 2023 against Bangladesh but was not picked in the Playing XI in any of the three T20Is. Ravindra had a terrific World Cup, where he had scored 578 runs from 10 matches, including three centuries. New Zealand Cricket confirmed Ravindra was not considered. \"Rachin Ravindra wasn’t considered as a replacement for Williamson in the third game, as he begins a period of rest after being on the road with the BLACKCAPS since the beginning of August, a decision made by NZC in conjunction with Cricket Wellington,\" NZC wrote. New Zealand coach Gary Stead said they wanted to give him rest and he is very much in the scheme of things for the T20 World Cup. Williamson returns after late withdrawal from Bangladesh T20Is Meanwhile, Williamson is back to lead the T20I side again after being withdrawn from the 20-over series against Bangladesh. He along with Kyle Jamieson were pulled out from the Bangladesh 20-over series on precautionary measures. Williamson last played a T20I back on 20th November 2022 after the T20 World Cup. Notably, Matt Henry also returns to International cricket after missing a few matches in the ODI World Cup due to a hamstring injury.

Winner: Darts Gifts don’t come any better than this. Luke Littler, aged just 16, has made the darts world championships final in a blaze of publicity that any sport can only dream of. Littler is a portly character with serious facial hair. He’s not what immediately springs to mind when you think of a 16-year-old. But 16 he is, and he has been blitzing all-comers in the world champs in London. He’s far too young to sound remotely interesting though. “I just wake up, play on my Xbox, have some food and have a chuck on the board, go to bed and that’s it,” he said of a typical day. Have no fear, the British tabloids are here. They have already stepped up to the task of star-making by promoting stories around Littler’s “glamorous” 21-year-old girlfriend. Loser: Rugby - where is Scott Robertson? Here’s a typical problem for a sport that only pays lip service to connecting with fans. Rugby does understand one thing - almost all of its eggs must go into the test rugby basket. All forms of rugby below test action have turned into losers in terms of mass appeal. That’s why the All Blacks will play a whopping 14 tests this year, and World Rugby has introduced a new quasi-World Cup from 2026. Yet in this country, we’ll still start the year with the normal diet of limp Super Rugby coverage while new All Blacks boss Scott Robertson remains parked in the background. Meanwhile, over in the Blue Corner, the Warriors grabbed a huge slice of the sporting spotlight last year without even trying that hard. Rugby league has its weaknesses but works because it is small enough to keep things very simple and move with the times. In contrast, rugby is so quaint that it goes on holiday over the holiday period, as if it can afford to take a break just weeks before the season kicks into gear. Here’s my best advice for a failing powerhouse: make the All Blacks front and centre of absolutely everything. It’s your only chance of survival. Loser: Cricket South Africa named a joke of a test squad to tour New Zealand , omitting a host of stars who play in its domestic T20 competition. Aussie great Mark Waugh suggested it was the “defining moment in the death of test cricket”. Waugh is on the mark except that test cricket outside of the Big Three has been in its death throes for ages. That’s why New Zealand hosts test matches in picnic areas. While Waugh quite reasonably reckoned New Zealand should tell South Africa to take a hike, it’s probably better to have some cricket than none at all. And New Zealand can hardly complain when it contrives to keep the great Trent Boult out of the test team. While this South African squad is a joke, the last laugh might be on us. The last hopeless sports team to visit New Zealand was a weak England netball squad that duly won the first test over the erratic Silver Ferns. And write South Africa cricket teams off at your peril - their cricketers come from a tough and very competitive environment. Loser: Cricket statistics/averages Further to the above … players’ averages will have to be taken with a grain of salt as test cricket descends into a sporting death zone alongside Super Rugby and co. Winners/Losers? Chris Wood and Nottingham Forest A wonderful few days on the pitch have been followed by a potential disaster off it for one of the clubs who will battle to avoid relegation from the English Premier League. Kiwi striker Wood had an incredible match against his old club Newcastle, taking Forest to victory with a hat-trick, a great moment for Kiwi football. Forest followed that up with a win over once-mighty Manchester United, putting handy distance between them and the bottom-three relegation zone. But Forest are reportedly in danger of having breached the EPL financial fair play regulations and thus face the threat of having points docked, as happened to Everton this season. Winner: Liverpool vs Newcastle A fantastic six-goal second half was a showcase of the EPL at its best. And a rejuvenated Liverpool have confirmed that they are quality challengers to Manchester City, who are facing a much tougher time defending their title than many expected. City will be buoyed by the sight of the great midfielder Kevin De Bruyne - who has been out with a long-term injury - warming up during the latest match against Sheffield United. He received a remarkable reception while limbering up, a reminder of the incredible passion that football inspires. Losers: Wayne Rooney and Birmingham City A short and disastrous managerial career at Birmingham City has come to an end for the fantastic former England player after just 15 games in charge. It always seemed a bit of an odd appointment, particularly as EPL-chasing Birmingham were reasonably placed in the football championship at the time. The club was just as keen on Rooney’s famous name as his abilities. Bad move. Winner: Vinesh Phogat The star Indian wrestler has continued to protest against the alleged sexual harassment of female athletes. Phogat, a courageous voice against sexist attitudes in sport, left two government awards on a kerbside after she was blocked from handing them back to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Winners … kind of: Detroit Pistons The Pistons ended a record-equalling 28-game losing streak with a victory over the underpowered Toronto Raptors. The Pistons duly lost their next game. Winner: Joseph Parker A belated congratulations to heavyweight boxer Joseph Parker on his victory over Deontay Wilder. Parker is back in the news and “back as a major player in the division” as one boxing website put it. Kiwi boxing had a terrific time in 2023, from Mea Motu and Lani Daniels’ rise to Parker’s surprise win. Chris Rattue has been a journalist since 1980 and is one of the most respected opinion writers in New Zealand sports journalism.","pubDate":"2024-01-03 02:30:56","image_url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/zpBGLhrI-NXCNJhgonZmfZZ9YmA=/300x300/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/T2XRDWR7OFAUPERZZSNASBHMTM.jpg","source_id":"nzherald","source_priority":7971,"country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"26fdb4d45724e94b712b686781137c37","title":"Waqar Younis slams Pakistan for ‘real shocker’ over resting Shaheen in SCG Test","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/aus-vs-pak-waqar-younis-pakistan-shaheen-shah-afridi-sydney-test-2483485-2024-01-03?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Waqar Younis slams Pakistan for ‘real shocker’ over resting Shaheen in SCG Test","content":"Listen to Story Former fast bowler Waqar Younis lashed out at Pakistan after fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi was, reportedly, rested for the third and final Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In Shaheen’s place, Pakistan roped in off-spinner Sajid Khan for the New Year’s Test. Sajid had joined the national team after Abrar Ahmed had injury concerns. \"We play for Test match cricket; we don't play for T20s or one-day cricket. If you're missing Test match cricket purely because you're being rested, I do not understand. That's a real shocker for me,\" Waqar was quoted as saying to the broadcasters before the match. As far as Shaheen is concerned, he picked up eight wickets from two matches at the Perth Stadium and the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. The after Abdullah Shafique dropped a simple catch on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. In the second innings of the Test, Shaheen also picked up a four-wicket haul, dismissing Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc. In 29 Tests until now since his debut back in December 2018, Shaheen has picked up 113 wickets with 12 four-wicket hauls, 4 five-wicket hauls and 1 10-wicket haul. Pakistan, in the meantime, are looking to avoid a series whitewash in Australia. Having lost their last 18 Tests on Australian soil, Shan Masood and Co. need to pull a rabbit out of the hat to secure victory. After losing the first Test by 360 runs in Perth, Pakistan fought hard in Melbourne. But they lost by 79 runs to concede the series.

FirstCricket Staff January 03, 2024 08:28:31 IST India have lost in two successive World Test Championship finals. Reuters After Michael Vaughan called India an underachieving side that doesn’t “win anything” , another former international cricketer has slammed Team India for not performing to their potential. Former India opener Kris Srikkanth has said that India is an “over-rated” cricket team in Test cricket as many players from the current side have failed to live up to their expectations. Srikkanth’s rebuke came after India suffered an innings and 32 runs defeat to South Africa in the Centurion Test. He added that India did well in Tests under Virat Kohli who left captaincy in January 2022. “Test cricket, we are over-rated,” Srikkanth said in a video on his YouTube channel. Related Articles India vs South Africa 2nd ODI: Preview, Gqeberha Weather Report and St George's Park Pitch Report India vs South Africa 2nd ODI Highlights: Tony de Zorzi's unbeaten 119 guides Proteas to series-leveling win “I think it was a phase of 2-3 years…when Virat Kohli was the captain of the team, we were outstanding. We dominated in England, we fought hard in South Africa, we won in Australia. We had a good phase for 2-4 years,” Srikkanth said. The ex-India player added that India need to forget the No. 1 ranking in ICC and focus should be on getting the results. “We have to forget ICC rankings. We are always 1-2, 1-2. It’s a combination of having over-rated cricketers and people who have not performed up to their potential. Or some players have not enough chances like Kuldeep (Yadav),” Srikkanth said. “If you want to be the best team, you should be capable of being the giants on home grounds. That is what we did when Rishabh Pant was firing. “But you can keep on saying that we scored in Australia, we scored in England. You can sing the same song; you won’t move forward if you rest on past laurels. You have to just look at how you have performed in the last two years, last 18 months.” Srikkanth also did not spare the limited-over side and added that India are an overrated side in T20Is as well. “In T20 cricket India are highly over-rated. ODI cricket, we are a fantastic team. What happens in ODIs, in the semifinals, finals, it’s just a one-off match. It’s a luck factor, a lot depends on luck in these matches. “I read Rohit Sharma’s statement, for a cricketer, the 50-over World Cup is a huge achievement. “We sometimes underperform in the knockout matches, in the semifinals and the final.

Williamson missed last month’s ODI and T20 series against Bangladesh while he rehabilitated a knee injury sustained nine months ago. The 33-year-old recovered to play in the 50-over World Cup and a two-Test series in Bangladesh but was rested from white-ball commitments last month as a precaution. Williamson’s controlled return will include a rest in game three of the five-match Pakistan series starting on January 12. All-rounder Mitchell Santner will lead the Black Caps in that match in Dunedin. Opening batter Devon Conway returns after also missing both white ball series against Bangladesh, while pace bowlers Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson will both make their first international appearances since being injured during the World Cup. Seamer Kyle Jamieson and spinner Michael Bracewell were not considered because of ongoing injuries while a notable omission from the 15-man squad was allrounder Rachin Ravindra, who scored 578 runs at the World Cup. Coach Gary Stead said Ravindra was in need of rest. “Rachin’s a young player who has immense value to New Zealand Cricket and we therefore want to look after his wellbeing,” Stead said. “He’s the only player or staff member to have been touring non-stop for the past five months across five countries and that’s simply not sustainable. He’s still very much part of our thinking for the T20 World Cup in June and will come back into the reckoning for the T20 series against Australia in February.” Comments Related stories Related Topics","pubDate":"2024-01-03 02:45:52","image_url":"https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/juj21a/article67700798.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_21._kane-williamson__2_1_62AFUH1C.jpg","source_id":"sportstar","source_priority":2972,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"8cf7d0e8e75f845af0247a5b71edd943","title":"AUS vs PAK Sydney Test: फेयरवेल टेस्ट में बेटियों संग मैदान में उतरे डेविड वॉर्नर, तालियों से गूंजा पूरा स्टेडियम","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/david-warner-took-field-with-his-three-daughter-for-farewell-test-aus-vs-pak-sydney-test-2575927","keywords":["cricket"],"creator":["शिव ठाकुर"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>David Warner:</strong> ऑस्ट्रेलिया और पाकिस्तान के बीच तीन मैचों की टेस्ट सीरीज का आखिरी मुकाबला सिडनी में शुरू हो चुका है. यह मुकाबला ऑस्ट्रेलिया के सलामी बल्लेबाज डेविड वॉर्नर के करियर का आखिरी रेड बॉल गेम भी है. इस मैच के बाद वॉर्नर फिर कभी टेस्ट जर्सी में नहीं दिखाई देंगे.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">अपने इस फेयरवेल टेस्ट में डेविड वॉर्नर की एंट्री बेहद ही आकर्षक रही. दरअसल, इस मैच से पहले राष्ट्रगान के लिए मैदान पर आते वक्त उनके साथ उनकी तीनों बेटियां मौजूद थी. यह देख पूरा स्टेडियम तालियों से गूंज उठा. सिडनी क्रिकेट ग्राउंड पर मौजूद दर्शकों से लेकर क्रिकेटर्स और कमेंटेटर्स तक तालियां बजाते रहे.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">David Warner with his daughters in his final Test.<br /><br />- Picture of the day ⭐ <a href=\"https://t.co/DzmruiQ7CO\">pic.twitter.com/DzmruiQ7CO</a></p> &mdash; Johns.

The Blackcaps are gearing up for their home series against the Men in Green and have named a squad for it with some key decisions made. Notably, three star players have made a return to the team with a CSK player missing out on selection. CSK's Rachin Ravindra has been rested out from the New Zealand squad for the 20-over series while is back to lead the side after a long break from the format. Notably, fast bowler Matt Henry and CSK's other star Devon Conway return to the team. However, several players are available for select games with Williamson not part of the third T20I to manage his knee. Uncapped Josh Clarkson is picked for only game number three, while Lockie Ferguson is not part of the first two matches. Ben Sears is available for those two games. Ravindra out after a late entry in the Bangladesh T20I series Ravindra was called in as a replacement for the team's last T20I assignment of 2023 against Bangladesh but was not picked in the Playing XI in any of the three T20Is. Ravindra had a terrific World Cup, where he had scored 578 runs from 10 matches, including three centuries. New Zealand Cricket confirmed Ravindra was not considered. \"Rachin Ravindra wasn’t considered as a replacement for Williamson in the third game, as he begins a period of rest after being on the road with the BLACKCAPS since the beginning of August, a decision made by NZC in conjunction with Cricket Wellington,\" NZC wrote. New Zealand coach Gary Stead said they wanted to give him rest and he is very much in the scheme of things for the T20 World Cup. Williamson returns after late withdrawal from Bangladesh T20Is Meanwhile, Williamson is back to lead the T20I side again after being withdrawn from the 20-over series against Bangladesh. He along with Kyle Jamieson were pulled out from the Bangladesh 20-over series on precautionary measures. Williamson last played a T20I back on 20th November 2022 after the T20 World Cup. Notably, Matt Henry also returns to International cricket after missing a few matches in the ODI World Cup due to a hamstring injury.

Winner: Darts Gifts don’t come any better than this. Luke Littler, aged just 16, has made the darts world championships final in a blaze of publicity that any sport can only dream of. Littler is a portly character with serious facial hair. He’s not what immediately springs to mind when you think of a 16-year-old. But 16 he is, and he has been blitzing all-comers in the world champs in London. He’s far too young to sound remotely interesting though. “I just wake up, play on my Xbox, have some food and have a chuck on the board, go to bed and that’s it,” he said of a typical day. Have no fear, the British tabloids are here. They have already stepped up to the task of star-making by promoting stories around Littler’s “glamorous” 21-year-old girlfriend. Loser: Rugby - where is Scott Robertson? Here’s a typical problem for a sport that only pays lip service to connecting with fans. Rugby does understand one thing - almost all of its eggs must go into the test rugby basket. All forms of rugby below test action have turned into losers in terms of mass appeal. That’s why the All Blacks will play a whopping 14 tests this year, and World Rugby has introduced a new quasi-World Cup from 2026. Yet in this country, we’ll still start the year with the normal diet of limp Super Rugby coverage while new All Blacks boss Scott Robertson remains parked in the background. Meanwhile, over in the Blue Corner, the Warriors grabbed a huge slice of the sporting spotlight last year without even trying that hard. Rugby league has its weaknesses but works because it is small enough to keep things very simple and move with the times. In contrast, rugby is so quaint that it goes on holiday over the holiday period, as if it can afford to take a break just weeks before the season kicks into gear. Here’s my best advice for a failing powerhouse: make the All Blacks front and centre of absolutely everything. It’s your only chance of survival. Loser: Cricket South Africa named a joke of a test squad to tour New Zealand , omitting a host of stars who play in its domestic T20 competition. Aussie great Mark Waugh suggested it was the “defining moment in the death of test cricket”. Waugh is on the mark except that test cricket outside of the Big Three has been in its death throes for ages. That’s why New Zealand hosts test matches in picnic areas. While Waugh quite reasonably reckoned New Zealand should tell South Africa to take a hike, it’s probably better to have some cricket than none at all. And New Zealand can hardly complain when it contrives to keep the great Trent Boult out of the test team. While this South African squad is a joke, the last laugh might be on us. The last hopeless sports team to visit New Zealand was a weak England netball squad that duly won the first test over the erratic Silver Ferns. And write South Africa cricket teams off at your peril - their cricketers come from a tough and very competitive environment. Loser: Cricket statistics/averages Further to the above … players’ averages will have to be taken with a grain of salt as test cricket descends into a sporting death zone alongside Super Rugby and co. Winners/Losers? Chris Wood and Nottingham Forest A wonderful few days on the pitch have been followed by a potential disaster off it for one of the clubs who will battle to avoid relegation from the English Premier League. Kiwi striker Wood had an incredible match against his old club Newcastle, taking Forest to victory with a hat-trick, a great moment for Kiwi football. Forest followed that up with a win over once-mighty Manchester United, putting handy distance between them and the bottom-three relegation zone. But Forest are reportedly in danger of having breached the EPL financial fair play regulations and thus face the threat of having points docked, as happened to Everton this season. Winner: Liverpool vs Newcastle A fantastic six-goal second half was a showcase of the EPL at its best. And a rejuvenated Liverpool have confirmed that they are quality challengers to Manchester City, who are facing a much tougher time defending their title than many expected. City will be buoyed by the sight of the great midfielder Kevin De Bruyne - who has been out with a long-term injury - warming up during the latest match against Sheffield United. He received a remarkable reception while limbering up, a reminder of the incredible passion that football inspires. Losers: Wayne Rooney and Birmingham City A short and disastrous managerial career at Birmingham City has come to an end for the fantastic former England player after just 15 games in charge. It always seemed a bit of an odd appointment, particularly as EPL-chasing Birmingham were reasonably placed in the football championship at the time. The club was just as keen on Rooney’s famous name as his abilities. Bad move. Winner: Vinesh Phogat The star Indian wrestler has continued to protest against the alleged sexual harassment of female athletes. Phogat, a courageous voice against sexist attitudes in sport, left two government awards on a kerbside after she was blocked from handing them back to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Winners … kind of: Detroit Pistons The Pistons ended a record-equalling 28-game losing streak with a victory over the underpowered Toronto Raptors. The Pistons duly lost their next game. Winner: Joseph Parker A belated congratulations to heavyweight boxer Joseph Parker on his victory over Deontay Wilder. Parker is back in the news and “back as a major player in the division” as one boxing website put it. Kiwi boxing had a terrific time in 2023, from Mea Motu and Lani Daniels’ rise to Parker’s surprise win. Chris Rattue has been a journalist since 1980 and is one of the most respected opinion writers in New Zealand sports journalism.","pubDate":"2024-01-03 02:30:56","image_url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/zpBGLhrI-NXCNJhgonZmfZZ9YmA=/300x300/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/T2XRDWR7OFAUPERZZSNASBHMTM.jpg","source_id":"nzherald","source_priority":7971,"country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"}]}
