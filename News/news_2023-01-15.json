Remarkably, in the Renegades’ Melbourne derby victory over the Stars on Saturday night, Stars batsmen Joe Clarke and Beau Webster both hit the roof. But rather than being ruled dead balls by the umpire, under BBL rules both Clarke and Webster were awarded sixes, despite both shots going straight up into the air and almost certainly providing a catching chance for the Renegades had they been playing at an open-air stadium. The controversial shots prompted Zampa to call for a staple rule of backyard cricket all around the country to be introduced to the Big Bash League, a one-handed catch off the roof.

It’s honestly a little bit bizarre that they call it six when the ball goes straight up into the air,” Zampa said post-match. “As a bowler you expect (when you) deceive a batsman to at least be a chance of getting a wicket. “Maybe build the roof a bit higher,” he quipped. “When it happens, you know how lucky you are, it’s nothing about getting on top of the bowler, or anything like that, it’s just pure luck.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Cricket great Mark Waugh was in complete agreement. “It’s cost them 12 runs which is wrong,” Waugh told Fox Cricket. “It’s just not going for six. At the minimum it should be a dead ball. “Twelve runs is a big difference in this game – let alone the fact they would have been out. “Can’t do much about that but there’s no way it should be an automatic six. “They’ve got to have a look at that rule. It’s not right the way that rule sits at the moment.” Waugh said he thought discretion should be in the umpires’ hands. “If it looks like it’s not going anywhere near a six, it shouldn’t be a six,” Waugh said. “It should be a dead ball. I think it’s ridiculous. If you hit it straight up and it should have been out, then you get a six as a reward. I think it needs to change.” Despite coming close to being denied victory by the bizarre scenes, Aaron Finch of the Renegades said he wasn't too fussed by the rulings. Photo / Getty Renegades stand-in captain Aaron Finch wasn’t too fussed by the controversial sixes, despite how close they came to depriving his team their narrow six-run win. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. He wasn’t sure if the rule should be changed again, either, after originally being deemed a dead ball, before being tweaked to its current interpretation after Finch himself hit the Marvel Stadium roof during a game a decade ago. “The rule is what it is, it’s the same for both teams, so I don’t think you can complain,” he said. “But it would’ve been two dismissals... so that makes a big difference in a game. “It’s hard to police isn’t it? Because you have these beams that hang over (the field of play), they’re already over the boundary so if it hits that, you should get a six, (but) if you hit it straight up you get a six, I don’t know. “But I think the game is better with the roof closed at Marvel, because there’s so many buildings around (the Docklands precinct), there’s a lot of light that comes in and if you’re fielding it can be really difficult to see as the sun is setting off the seats.” The Stars’ finals dream is all but over, and Zampa couldn’t hide his disappointment. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “It would’ve been nice going into the last three games with something to play for,” he said. “It was always going to be a tough season without the best player in the comp (Glenn Maxwell due to a broken leg), and obviously ‘Stoin’ (Marcus Stoinis) has been out quite a bit as well. “When you miss two experienced guys like that, it’s a big loss, but I think we were good enough to make finals this year at least.” Renegades batsman Sam Harper is in a rich vein of form, having now hit three consecutive fifties, and Finch was full of praise for the No.3. “The way that he’s managing his innings at the moment is brilliant, he’s obviously got all the shots so the way that he’s constructing it has been outstanding,” Finch said. “Maybe be a kick in the backside (helped Harper) as well after missing a couple of games.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. One batsman who isn’t enjoying a good run is star import Martin Guptill, who is averaging just 15.86 in his seven games for the Renegades, but Finch was still “100 per cent” confident the New Zealander could turn things around in the back-end of the season. “He’s one of the best players in the world,” Finch said. Veteran Renegades spinner Fawad Ahmed appeared to hurt his knee late in the game against the Stars, but Finch was hopeful he would be available for their next game against the Thunder in Sydney on Thursday.

By the time he had finished his batting blitz a few hours later, it was the hosts who were feeling queasy. Phillips went from throwing up to chasing down a target that was slipping from his side’s grasp yesterday, smacking 63 runs from 42 balls to seal New Zealand’s first ODI series victory in Pakistan. It was Phillips’ maiden ODI half-century and came after he had been struck down by a virus that forced him from the park, suffering from symptoms including vomiting. As a result of his absence, Phillips had to drop to No 7 in the batting order. But that placement eventually worked in the tourists’ favour, after they had lost 4-45 to leave the series in the balance. The Black Caps had earlier appeared on track to chase down 281, with Devon Conway (52) and Kane Williamson (53) continuing strong series to position their side on 160-2 in the 31st over. The mini-collapse that followed left New Zealand needing 100 from 87 balls when Phillips walked to the crease, still clearly showing the effects of his spell in the sickbay. The way the 26-year-old proceeded to bat, however, suggested he had never felt better. Phillips struck four fours and four sixes with the type of clean hitting that has made him a weapon in T20 cricket, launching blows off the back foot and running with an urgency that belied his poor health. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. His onslaught saw the Black Caps speed to their target with 11 balls and two wickets to spare, engendering awe among his teammates. “Coming into the last 10 overs, we were probably a couple of wickets down more than we would’ve liked,” said Williamson. “But then you see a knock like Glenn Phillips’, it was incredibly special. “We lost [wickets] quite quickly and he walked out and did his thing. He wasn’t feeling too good - he was quite sick, actually. But he came out and saw things very clearly and played an incredible knock. “Some of the shots we saw were amazing. To see an innings like that is what you hope for but certainly don’t expect. No one really saw it coming.” Knocks like that have become expected by Phillips in the shortest form, with his outstanding World Cup giving him a career strike rate of 148 and lifting him to No 7 in the world rankings. But having made his ODI debut only six months ago, this was the first time the Otago batsman had enjoyed the chance to change a match in 50-over cricket. “We’ve all seen the X-factor that he brings in the T20 format - the power and how dynamic he is,” Williamson said. “To get opportunities in ODI cricket and transfer those skillsets, we saw it to the highest degree. “He was exceptional and played with real freedom. It was an amazing contribution - the game was right in the balance and he came out and really threw a punch in terms of his style of play. He’s a very special player.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. It was a special result - the Black Caps’ first ODI triumph on the subcontinent since 2008 and their first series win of any kind in Pakistan since 1969. The team will now head to India for six white-ball matches, while Williamson and Tim Southee will return home to prepare for next month’s visit of England. Southee - who led the attack with 3-56 as a ton from opener Fakhar Zaman saw Pakistan post 280-9 - overtook Daniel Vettori as New Zealand’s highest wicket-taker in international cricket, with 697 scalps across formats. The test skipper will next be hoping to surpass Vettori (361) on the test ranks, needing nine wickets against England to reach second on the all-time list behind Sir Richard Hadlee (431).

A report by ESPNCricinfo says Pant, who miraculously survived a horrific car crash on December 30, has torn all three key ligaments in his right knee, two of which were reconstructed recently during the surgery which happened on January 6 while the reconstruction of the third torn ligament is expected after six weeks. \"All three ligaments in the knee - anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament, which are necessary for movement and stability - have been torn in Pant's case.\" \"It is understood that in the surgery conducted recently, both the PCL and MCL were reconstructed. Pant will need to undergo another surgery to reconstruct his ACL, but the doctors will wait for at least six weeks before going ahead with it,\" said the report. As a result, Pant is in danger of being sidelined from the game for at least six months, which can potentially affect his chances of being fit and available for selection for the 2023 ODI World Cup, scheduled to take place in India in October-November. On December 30, around 5:30am, Pant, 25, suffered multiple injuries when his car collided with a road divider and caught fire on the Delhi-Dehradun highway. The horrific car accident happened between Manglaur and Narsan in the Haridwar district in the state of Uttarakhand. Pant was initially taken to Saksham Hospital Multispecialty and Trauma Centre, before being admitted to Max Hospital, Dehradun. He was on his way to his hometown Roorkee from New Delhi and was alone while driving his Mercedes car. On January 4, the Board of Control for Cricket in India announced that Pant would be shifted from Dehradun to Mumbai via an air ambulance for surgery and further treatment, where he is now under direct supervision of Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala, the head of the Centre for Sports Medicine, and Director of Arthroscopy amp; Shoulder Service, at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Andheri West, Mumbai. The first medical update from the BCCI hours after the accident on December 30 said apart from right knee ligament tear, Pant suffered two cuts on his forehead, and has also hurt his right wrist, ankle, and toe apart from abrasion injuries on his back. Later that evening, a medical bulletin said the results of Pant's MRI of the brain and spine came out as normal. It added that Pant also underwent plastic surgery to manage his facial injuries, lacerated wounds and abrasions. The report also said that there is no definitive timeline given by the doctors yet on how long it would take Pant to resume training for playing cricket. It added that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the selectors have concluded that the wicketkeeper-batter would be out for a minimum of six months. It implies that Pant will miss white-ball series against New Zealand, four Tests for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and three ODIs against Australia, IPL 2023, where he is captain of Delhi Capitals and World Test Championship (WTC) final in June if India makes it to the title clash. In his absence, KS Bharat and Ishan Kishan are the wicketkeeping options for the first two Tests against Australia. Bharat and Ishan are also included as keeping options for the three-match ODI series against New Zealand starting from January 18. Ishan and Jitesh Sharma are the keeping options for T20Is against New Zealand, which follows after the ODI series. Pant, who made his international cricket debut in February 2017, was part of the India Test squad that sealed a 2-0 series victory over Bangladesh in Dhaka in December 2022. In that match which ended on December 25, he hit a match-winning 93 in the first innings of the second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.

Flower said Rahul has great batting skills and can lead the team well. “KL is a superb batter, beautiful to watch, I love watching him bat always. I first came across him when I was coaching England Lions. We played against India A in Trivandrum so I have been a keen follower of him as a batsman since then,” Flower said. The Zimbabwe great praised Rahul’s captaincy too. “He is also an outstanding young man and a really good leader, he is very calm, measured, he is good company. I respect him and really enjoy working with him.” When asked about Pandya and players such as Suryakumar Yadav and Shreyas Iyer, Flower said, “What I know of him (Rahul), he will be an excellent skipper. I don’t know the other guys very well so can’t comment on that, selectors might see that.” He wished Rahul a great married life ahead. Rahul is set to tie the knot with Bollywood actress Athiya Shetty. Flower is coaching league teams in various countries and said that he enjoys his role with franchises. “At the moment I am fairly busy throughout the year due to franchise cricket.

In his book ‘Coaching Beyond: My Days With Indian Cricket Team’, co-authored by veteran journalist R Kaushik, Sridhar spoke extensively about communication which he felt was the hallmark of the coaching staff during his time with the Indian team. “As far as the coaching group is concerned, one of the non-negotiables is being honest about developing a culture where you can look each player in the eye and tell him the truth, no matter how bitter or unpalatable that might be,” Sridhar wrote in his book. Page 42 of the chapter ‘Cracking The Communication Code’, Sridhar recollected an incident from former Kohli’s early days when he was already leading the Test squad but was captain-in-waiting as far as the white ball squad was concerned. “There was a time in 2016 when Virat was very eager to be the captain of the white-ball team too. He said a few things that showed he was looking for the captaincy,” Sridhar narrated. “One evening, Ravi called him and said, ‘Look, Virat, MS gave it (the captaincy) to you in red-ball cricket. You have to respect him. He will give it to you in limited-overs cricket, too, when the time is right. Unless you respect him now, tomorrow when you are the captain, you won’t get the respect from your team’,” Sridhar said. According to Sridhar, Shastri in no uncertain terms told Kohli to wait till Dhoni hands it over to him in limited overs cricket. “Respect him (Dhoni) now, irrespective of what is going on. It will come to you, you don’t have to run behind it.'” Shastri told Kohli. “To his credit, Virat took the advice on board. Eventually, in a year’s time, he got the white-ball captaincy too.” Terming Shastri as a “fabulous communicator who talks straight and doesn’t mince words,” Sridhar also wrote that the former head coach did the proverbial dirty job of informing players when they were dropped. “He is (was) the one who passes on the tough messages-calls pertaining to being dropped from the XI to the players concerned.” The book was published by Rupa.

Yadav, who has been rewarded for his supreme T20I form, has been added to the list of Indian cricketers who have done well in one format but benefited in an entirely different one. Yadav’s Test selection would’ve been celebrated by one and all had uncapped batter Sarfaraz Khan not been scoring truckloads of runs in domestic cricket. With Khan doing almost everything in his capacity in order to earn a maiden Test call-up, his performances still seem to be not up to the mark to allure selectors’ attention. Without dwelling too much into the numbers, it is enough to state that 25-year old Khan averages and strikes at 80.47 and 69.89 respectively and has registered 12 centuries and nine half-centuries across 52 first-class innings. Ranji trophy performances should be the first criteria for test selections! — Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) January 14, 2023 Irrespective of the reason, the right-handed Mumbai batter not getting a maiden national call-up neither sets the right precedent nor does justice to someone who has been ever consistent in the latest seasons of the prestigious Ranji Trophy. Will Suryakumar Yadav Test debut happen in 1st Test vs Australia at Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium? Yadav, 32, hasn’t been added to the Test squad for the first time. Part of the white-ball squads for the tour of Sri Lanka in 2021, Yadav had traveled to England to join the Test squad in the absence of injured players namely Shubman Gill, Washington Sundar and Avesh Khan. Both Yadav and fellow Mumbai batter Prithvi Shaw had traveled together but neither of the two got to play a match in England. Yadav, who has scored 5,549 first-class runs in 79 matches at an average of 44.75 with the help of 14 centuries and 28 half-centuries, is unlikely to debut in the first Test against Australia in Nagpur starting from February 9. With captain Rohit Sharma also returning to the Test squad, one out of vice-captain KL Rahul or opening batter Shubman Gill will have to make way for him at the top of the order. Hence, Yadav is comparatively down the pecking order even in case of a last-minute injury to any specialist batter. As is the case in the ongoing ODI series against Sri Lanka, Yadav would ideally be contesting for a Test spot with his Mumbai teammate Shreyas Iyer. Just like the ODIs, Yadav might not be able to pin down Iyer because of his recent form. Iyer, 28, has scored 624 runs at an average of 56.72 consisting of a century and five half-centuries in 12 Test innings. Apart from Sharma and Yadav, uncapped wicket-keeper batter Ishan Kishan, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja (subject to fitness) and fast bowler Mohammed Shami have returned to the Test squad in place of uncapped batter Abhimanyu Easwaran, wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant, all-rounder Shardul Thakur, fast bowler Navdeep Saini and uncapped spinner Saurabh Kumar. Interestingly, Yadav and Kishan, who had made their debuts in white-ball formats in the same matches, once again find themselves in the same squad as uncapped batters.

Ballance made his Zimbabwe debut as the hosts beat Ireland by five wickets in the first T20 international in Harare. Ballance, who played 23 Tests and 16 one-day internationals for England between 2014 and 2017, signed a two-year deal to play for his native Zimbabwe after leaving Yorkshire towards the end of 2022. The 33-year-old made 30 from 29 balls on Thursday, hitting two fours and a six, as Zimbabwe reached their target of 115 with two overs to spare. Ireland had earlier been dismissed for 114 in 19.2 overs. ZC usually asks journalists at the match venue to nominate a player to attend the post match briefing and on Thursday Ballance was the obvious choice after his solid debut. The press corps were however left dissapointed after their request for Ballance was turned down by ZC's media and communications manager Darlington Majonga. While ZC maintains that Ballance is unavailable for interviews as he is \"still settling down\" with the team, the media gag could be due to his racism allegations in England. Ballance signed a two-year deal with Zimbabwe in December, having been released early from his county contract with Yorkshire following the racism scandal. The 33-year-old admitted to using a racial slur against Yorkshire teammate Azeem Rafiq, but claimed \"this was a situation where best friends said offensive things to each other which, outside of that context, would be considered wholly inappropriate.\" In August last year, Ballance met Rafiq in person to apologise for his use of \"unacceptable\" and \"racist\" language and, having not played professionally since September 2021. Despite the racism allegations in England, Ballance has now since returned to action for the country of his birth.","pubDate":"2023-01-14 10:12:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"allafrica","country":["tanzania"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zampa mulling on taking call on red ball career after India tour omission","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/zampa-mulling-on-taking-call-on-red-ball-career-after-india-tour-omission/","keywords":["Sports","Adam Zampa","Ashton Agar","George bailey","India","Nathan Lyon","Queensland"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne: A disappointed Australian leg-spinner Adam Zampa feels that he might need to look beyond revival of his red ball career after being ignored for the four-Test series in India starting next month.

For next month’s India tour, national selection chairman George Bailey and coach Andrew McDonald opted for Queensland leg-spinner Mitch Swepson as their only option. The other spinners in the side are Ashton Agar, uncapped Todd Murphy, and veteran Nathan Lyon. “I’m very disappointed, I would loved to have been on it. I thought with the way that I’ve been going in international cricket in particular that this was going to be my opportunity (to play Test cricket),” Zampa was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. “And that was the messaging I got six weeks ago as well that this was going to be very good chance I could potentially be on it but now that I’m not, I’m very flat about it and it’s time to just move on from it. “I was really excited to potentially be on this tour and the messaging was that my style of bowling might have been handy over there. But I think potentially last minute that was a change of mind,” he added. Zampa said he is yet to take a call on his Test career as his priority right now is the ODI World Cup in India later this year and next year’s T20 World Cup in the US and Caribbean islands. “I’m not going to close the door completely to red-ball cricket,” the 30-year-old said. “But life is always about balance and I’ve got a family and these white-ball tours and World Cups that are coming up. So I’ve got to try and think about what’s best for my body and myself and my family. “It’s two years until the next subcontinent tour, that’s a long way away and I’ve got two white-ball World Cups to concentrate on before that.” PTI Tags: Adam Zampa Ashton Agar George bailey India Nathan Lyon Queensland Share Tweet Send Share Suggest A Correction Enter your email to get our daily news in your inbox.

Warner has been an exceptional servant to Australian cricket across all formats since 2009. In 101 Test matches so far, Warner has scored 8,132 runs at an average of 46.20. He has 25 centuries and 34 fifties in the format, with the best individual score of 335*. Warner has also featured in 141 ODIs for Aussies, in which he has scored 6,007 runs at an average of 45.16. He has 19 centuries and 27 fifties in the format, with the best individual score of 179. Warner has also had a decorated T20I career as a batter. In 99 matches, he has scored 2,894 runs at an average of 32.88. He has one century and 24 half-centuries in this format, with the best score of 100. He is also part of the Australian team that captured the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup. He will be seen in action during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India, which will start from February 9 onwards. Australia has named an 18-member squad for the Border-Gavaskar series in India, including 22-year-old Todd Murphy, while awaiting updates on whether Mitchell Starc and Cameron Green would be fit for the series. Off-spinner Murphy joins Ashton Agar and Mitchell Swepson as prospective spin partners for Nathan Lyon after a promising start to his First Class career. Murphy and the rest of the spin group were preferred over Adam Zampa. Uncapped quick Lance Morris, who was part of Australia’s red-ball squad in the home series, retains his spot and has a chance to make his debut in the first Test at Nagpur, as Mitchell Starc, who is currently nursing tendon damage on his left middle finger, won’t join the squad until after the first Test. Batters Peter Handscomb and Matt Renshaw will support the top six in the touring squad, with Marcus Harris, a member of Australia’s selection for the home summer, missing out. All-rounder Cameron Green is also racing against time to be fit but could make the opening Test in spite of sustaining a fracture on the right index finger during the Boxing Day Test against South Africa. The Australia tour of India will kickstart in Nagpur on February 9. There will be a total of 7 matches on the tour — 4 Tests and 3 ODIs. The tour will start with the four-match Test series with the first game starting on February 9 at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur. Delhi (Arun Jaitley Stadium), Dharamsala (HPCA Stadium) and Ahmedabad (Narendra Modi Stadium) will host the remaining three Tests of the four-match series. The home series will conclude with a three-match ODI series, with Mumbai, Vizag and Chennai playing hosts. Mumbai will host the first match of the series on March 17 while the second and third will be held on January 19 and 22 in Vizag and Chennai, respectively. Australia Test squad for the tour of India: Pat Cummins (c), Ashton Agar, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Lance Morris, Todd Murphy, Matthew Renshaw, Steve Smith (vc), Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson and David Warner.","pubDate":"2023-01-14 09:00:04","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Steve Smith could play for Sussex ahead of The Ashes: Details","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/steve-smith-could-play-for-sussex-ahead-of-the-ashes-details-777656","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sakshi Gupta"],"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith has scored 8,000+ runs in TestsHe recently scored his 30th century in Test cricketAustralia are next set to tour India for the Border Gavaskar series","content":"Steve Smith has scored 8,000+ runs in TestsSteve Smith has scored 8,000+ runs in TestsSteve Smith is reportedly set to play for County side Sussex in the build-up to the Ashes that will be held in England later this year.Smith, who has decided not to participate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023, is in discussions with Sussex over a short-time deal that would see him play just \"three or four games,\" according to a report in Sydney Morning Herald. No contract has yet been signed with Sussex, who play in Division Two, with a decision expected to be made in the coming week.It is understood that Smith has spent the last few months holding discussions with various county sides over a small deal. The Australian batsman was preferably looking to join a club in Division One, with Kent seen as an ideal given his links to the county following a stint in club cricket at Sevenoaks Vine CC in 2007, which led to a one-off second-team appearance at Canterbury. However, the club's situation and Smith's availability did not match. A short-team stint with a county side would help Smith to get accustomed to English conditions ahead of their likely appearance in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at the Kia Oval in June, along with their subsequent Ashes series, beginning on June 16 at Edgbaston. England were hammered 4-0 in the previous Ashes series that took place Down Under in 2020-21. However, since then, England have undergone a massive transition under the new leadership of captain Ben Stokes and Test head coach Brendon McCullum. England are on a run of nine wins from 10 Tests.Stokes, England's Test skipper, recently expressed slight disapproval at a county deal for Smith when the former was told about this possibility during his side's recent tour of Pakistan. \"It's good for the county game to see that players of Steve's calibre want to come over and play. But, I don't know – it's one of those where you probably prefer them not to get any game time out here before the Ashes. At the same time, it is what it is,\" Stokes said in an interview.Australia's upcoming series is a big home in India as the two sides are set to lock horns in a four-match Border Gavaskar series. It is scheduled to begin on Feb. 9 in Nagpur, with the remaining Tests to be played in Delhi (Feb.17-21), Dharamsala (March 1-5), and Ahmedabad (March 9-13). Australia's squad for India Tests: Pat Cummins (c), Ashton Agar, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Peter Handscomb, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Lance Morris, Todd Murphy, Matthew Renshaw, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson, David Warner.Australia recently defeated South Africa 2-0, with the final Test ending in a draw in Sydney. Smith finished as the leading scorer with 231 runs in three Tests at an average of 57.75, including a century that was his 30th in his Test career. With 8,647 runs, Smith is now the fourth-highest run-scorer for Australia, having surpassed Michael Clarke (8643) and Hayden (8625) during his hundred at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in the New Year's Test.","pubDate":"2023-01-14 08:22:11","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2023/01/14/500x300_1329857-steve-smith.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lalit Modi hospitalised due to Covid, pneumonia","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/lalit-modi-hospitalised-due-to-covid-pneumonia/","keywords":["Home News","Sports","COVID","lalit modi","Pneumonia"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi has been hospitalised in London due to COVID-19 infection and pneumonia, he said in a social media post.

In a post on Instagram with pictures of his arrival at London Luton Airport, Modi said he is currently on external oxygen support having been flown from Mexico City. “After 3 weeks in confinement with a double Covid in 2 weeks, accompanied by influenza and deep pneumonia — and post trying several times to leave, finally landed via air ambulance accompanied by two doctors,” Modi said in the post sharing photos of him getting treatment. The flight was smooth, he said, adding, “Unfortunately, still on 24/7 external oxygen.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lalit Modi (@lalitkmodi) He thanked the doctors who treated him at Mexico City and the one who flew from London to accompany him back to the UK. Modi, who pioneered the T20 league Indian Premier League (IPL) — now the richest cricket league in the world — had left India in 2010 for London after being charged with tax evasion, money laundering, and manipulating broadcast deals. He was the founder and first chairman of the IPL, running the tournament for three years but was ousted afterward from Indian cricket following charges of various irregularities.

Sharma passed on Thursday in Vadodara, where he was hospitalised for nearly two weeks due to breathing issues. His final rites were performed in Nangal, Punjab on Friday. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu expressed grief over his death on Twitter. “The news of the demise of Himachal’s Vijay Hazare Trophy-winning team member and star bowler Sidharth Sharma is extremely sad. I pray to God to give peace to the departed soul and May the loved ones be given the strength to bear this great loss,” tweeted Sukhu. As per ESPNCricinfo, the bowler was a resident of a Himachal town Una and had travelled to Gujarat to play a Ranji Trophy match against Baroda from January 3 to January 6. During the practice session on December 31, he complained of breathing trouble, following which he was hospitalised later that day. Himachal spinner Mayank Dagar said that the bowler had been on ventilator support. “From January 3 to 6, we played against Baroda, but all of us focused on Siddharth’s health even during the match,” Dagar said. “We visited him regularly in hospital, but we had to leave him alone in Baroda and leave for the next match [against Odisha in Nadaun from January 10 to 13]. His breathing problem continued to worsen, after which he was put on a ventilator. We are all deeply saddened by his death. Sidharth was an important part of our team, and connected well with everyone,” added Dagar. Sidharth made his senior team debut in Ranji Trophy back in November 2017 against Bengal. He had played six first-class cricket matches, six List-A games and one T20 match. He was part of Himachal’s Vijay Hazare Trophy 2021-22 winning team and played three matches for them, including the final against Tamil Nadu, in which he took 1/34 in ten overs.","pubDate":"2023-01-14 08:00:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India names two short-form jets for Aussie Tests","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/india-v-australia-test-series-2023-squads-suryakumar-yadav-ishan-kishan/934b9333-2976-427f-861d-6f7d0c92030e","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"I﻿ndia has revealed a 17-man squad for the first two Tests against Australia, to be played in Nagpur and Delhi in February.","content":"India could be on the verge of blooding﻿ two superstars of limited-overs cricket in the Test format when Australia tours, after Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan were named in a 17-man squad.India on Saturday revealed a squad for the first two Tests, to be played in Nagpur and Delhi in February, which didn't include Rishabh Pant due to his car crash and Jasprit Bumrah because of a back injury.But great anticipation surrounds the selection of Yadav, who's struck 1578 T20 runs, including three centuries, at the average of 46.41 and strike-rate of 180.34﻿.READ MORE: Teary Tomljanovic's heartbreak at AO exit﻿READ MORE: Kyrgios' kind tribute to 'emotional' Djokovic﻿READ MORE: Hamilton's right-hand man jumps ship to F1 rival﻿The 32-year-old has shown off astounding strokemaking in the shortest form of the game﻿, with Virat Kohli describing one knock against New Zealand in November as a \"video game innings\".Kishan has peeled off 477 one-day international runs at the average of 53 and strike-rate of 111.97﻿.The 24-year-old left-hander slammed the fastest ODI double century in history against Bangladesh in December, reaching the mark in 126 balls.﻿Australia on Wednesday announced an 18-man Test squad for the tour of India, which included young Victorian off-spinner Todd Murphy and the recalled Peter Handscomb.Australia will be gunning for its first Test series victory in India since 2004, when Adam Gilchrist led his side to a 2-1 win.India's 17-man squad for first two Tests﻿Rohit Sharma (c), KL Rahul (vc), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KS Bharat (wk), Ishan Kishan (wk), R.

That guy has been one of the most consistent run-getters in First Class cricket and deserved that call-up more than anyone. Baffling selection by this committee, yet again. Sarfaraz a victim of not having social media fan following like sanju. Poor guy has done more than enough to be in the squad. such a shame he is not included.
