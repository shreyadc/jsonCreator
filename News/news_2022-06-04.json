Fakhar smashed 365 runs at an average of 60.83 with two hundred in six matches last year. One of the centuries came against South Africa. He scored 193, nearly leading Pakistan to victory in their pursuit of 342 in Johannesburg. Fakhar shared his picture in which he is seen wearing the cap. He wrote: \"Finally, it's here. Thank you for this ICC. Honored to be the part of the ODI team of the year.\" It is pertinent to mention here that Fakhar holds the record for the highest score from a Pakistan batsman in an ODI match. He achieved the milestone against Zimbabwe in July 2018, scoring 210 runs in 156 balls. The other players of the team were Paul Stirling (Ireland), Janneman Malan (South Africa), Rassie van der Dussen (South Africa), Shakib Al Hasan (Bangladesh), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk) (Bangladesh), Wanindu Hasaranga (Sri Lanka), Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh), Simi Singh (Ireland), and Dushmantha Chameera (Sri Lanka).","pubDate":"2022-06-04 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan secure series win after Sidra's century","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/963318-pakistan-secure-series-win-after-sidra-s-century","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Sidra Amin continued with her blistering form as she hammered a superb 123 while pacer Fatima Sana took 4-26 to enable Pakistan seal the three-match ODI series with a game in hand when they demolished Sri Lanka by 73 runs here at the Southend Club Cricket Stadium on Friday.Sidra, who had...","content":"KARACHI: Sidra Amin continued with her blistering form as she hammered a superb 123 while pacer Fatima Sana took 4-26 to enable Pakistan seal the three-match ODI series with a game in hand when they demolished Sri Lanka by 73 runs here at the Southend Club Cricket Stadium on Friday. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Sidra, who had hit 76 in the first match, did a glorious job by hammering her second hundred of her career to guide Pakistan to 253-2 in the allotted 50 overs. Fatima Sana then did a nice job with the ball, especially in her second spell, to restrict Sri Lanka to 180-9. After opting to bat first for the first time in the series when Bismah Maroof won the toss, Pakistan were lucky when Sri Lanka floored two catches earlier on in the innings which cost the visitors the match eventually. Sidra was dropped by Hasini Perera off Oshadi Ranasinghe when she had yet opened her account while the other opener Muneeba Ali (56) was dropped by Kavisha Dilhari off her own bowling on 17. Both the openers capitalised on the opportunities and went on to share a record 158 runs for the opening stand, surpassing the previous best opening stand of 96 from Javeria Khan and Nahida Khan. Sidra, who played some superb strokes during her epic knock, slog-swept Kavisha for a glorious four to bring in her second century. Sidra, who beat her previous best of 104, smashed 11 fours from 150 balls before being dismissed towards the end of the innings by Kavisha. She brought in her fifty off 72 balls and her hundred came off 137 deliveries. Muneeba, on the other hand, played a subdued role during the marathon partnership before falling soon after completing her fifty off 92 balls. She struck three fours in her 100-ball feat. In the end skipper Bismah Maroof (36*) and Nida Dar (10*) did well to help Pakistan post a decent total on the low track. Bismah also became the leading scorer of Pakistan in the ODI cricket when she reached 30 by displacing Javeria Khan from the summit. Bismah's aggregate total is 2891 in 117 matches while Javeria remains at No2 now with 2885 runs in 116 matches. Oshadi (1-44) and Kavisha (1-43) were the successful bowlers. Chasing a huge total, Sri Lanka were never in the business and in the first half of their innings their batters mostly were content to go ahead with snail pace with the asking run-rate mounting swiftly. Fatima Sana provided early breakthrough when she had Hasini for 14, held by Nida at mid-on. Nida then got rid of skipper Chamari Athapaththu (16) before Omaima Sohail getting rid of Hansima Karunaratne (27). Prasadani Weerakkody (20) then got run out to leave Sri Lanka at 90-4 in the 28th over. At this stage Harshitha Madavi (41) and Kavisha Dilhari (32) shared 61 runs for the fifth wicket association but after Kavisha was sent back, Sri Lanka lost their way completely. Omaima removed Kavisha while Harshitha got run out soon afterwards and Sri Lanka were restricted well behind the target. Fatima Sana was ably backed by spinner Omaima Sohail with 2-35. Sidra was adjudged as player of the match. \"The credit goes to the whole team as everyone chipped in. Sidra was simply brilliant,\" Pakistan's skipper Bismah Maroof said. Sri Lanka's skipper Chamari Athpaththu rued missed chances for the loss. \"We dropped a couple of catches and especially of Sidra who then batted really well,\" Chamari said. The third and final game will be held on Sunday (tomorrow). Pakistan now lead 2-0 in the series which is also a part of the ICC Women Championship 2022-2025 cycle which is also a pathway for qualifying for the 2025 World Cup.","pubDate":"2022-06-04 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PCB employees' salary issue referred to standing committee","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/963315-pcb-employees-salary-issue-referred-to-standing-committee","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"ISLAMABAD: The chairman of the Senate has referred the Pakistan Cricket Board’s issues relating to salaries’ raise and discrepancies found in the annual perks and privileges of the employees to the Standing Committee on the Inter-Provincial Coordination for further deliberations.

On a question raised by Senator Mushtaq Ahmad, Minister for IPC Ehsan Ur Rehman furnished details of the PCB regular as well as contractual employees’ salaries. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ There are 18 regular PCB employees and 350 contractual. There were serious observations on the criteria followed for the annual or timely salary raise where a few were preferred over others for the reasons unknown. “Why some employees were preferred over the others when it comes to a raise in the salary? There should be a clear criterion. Some were given huge raise while others were deprived of that,” Senator Mushtaq said. The questions were also raised on the criteria followed in the recent past to hire the employees on huge salaries. These questions will now be taken up in the Senate’s Standing Committee on IPC for further deliberations. “The PCB high-ups will be asked to appear before the committee to give briefing on the criteria adopted to hire employees and to raise their salaries on annual basis.” The PCB salary structure reveals, Managing Director PCB was drawing Rs2,650,000 (in Wasim Khan’s case) while chief executive of the Board draws Rs2.5 million per month salary. Director Media around Rs1.3 million, Director Human Resources Rs880,000, SGM Infrastructure Rs448,000, GM Procurement Rs275,000, Head Players Acquisition and Management Rs300,000, Manager Anti-Corruption Rs220,000, Manager Electrical 174,000, Manager HR Transformation Rs135,000 and Manager Anti Corruption Rs100,000. Majority of these are regular employees MD and CEO. All other regular employees draw less than Rs100,000 as salary. Contractual employees headed by MD and CEO draw different salaries according to the nature of their job.

And the way he is going, it is not beyond the realms of possibility the England skipper will end up getting near 100. Kane, who spent Thursday afternoon watching the first Test against New Zealand — captained by another Kane, Williamson — on TV, will beat Bobby Charlton’s tally of 49 goals with a strike here at the Puskas Arena tonight . It would move him within three of Wayne Rooney. The former Manchester United striker would have thought his record would have lasted a bit longer when grabbing goal No 50 from the penalty spot in a 2-0 win over Switzerland in 2015. Kane, 28, scored his third goal for England that night and his progress has been remarkable. He said: “Of course I think it would be an incredible achievement to break the record. “I was lucky enough to be playing on the pitch and actually scored when Wayne broke the record himself. I saw how much it meant to him and his family. I did not really think that far ahead at that stage. “But to be where I am now - four goals behind Wayne with plenty of games coming up this year- is an incredible achievement. “Whenever you are in amongst the names of Rooney and Lineker and Charlton and players like that you are doing something worthwhile. “It seems like a long time ago when I made my debut. At the time it was just about playing for England - that was one of the best feelings and still is one of the best feelings every time I pull on that shirt. “Back then it wasn’t a number I had in my head. “Of course, I wanted to score as many goals as possible and play as long as possible. “It all goes so quickly, the major tournaments come around so quickly, the games come quickly and year-by-year you edge up that leaderboard. It’s great to be close to 50. “Obviously I am still a few goals behind Wazza (Rooney) but the most important thing is to go out there and perform for my team and that is what I’ll try and do.” England have just six games left before the World Cup starts against Iran on November 21. After two matches against Hungary, a trip to Germany and a home clash with Italy, Gareth Southgate’s side finish their preparations in September. They take on the Italians in Milan on September 23 and then face Germany at Wembley three days later. In many respects, it would do Kane a favour if he makes history before flying out to Qatar. He said: “I'd like to break it as soon as possible. I'd love to score as many goals as I can in the next four games before the World Cup and see where we go from there. “But I'm someone who doesn't let that stuff affect me when I'm on the pitch. I have a job to do, it's not about scoring records and thinking about stuff like that when I'm on the pitch.” Kane finished the season strongly to help guide Spurs into the Champions League. And he is certainly in a much better place than at the start of the season when his form was all over the place. Kane was frustrated at failing to force a move to Manchester City but equally, maybe more importantly, there was the psychological impact of being the England captain which lost the Euro 2020 final on penalties at Wembley. He said: “Whenever you finish strongly with your club there is always a freer mind going into the international stage. “Obviously, last summer we had a major European competition. “It ended very disappointingly, but going into these games, I feel confident, I feel free. “We had a good finish as a team towards the end of the season and I had a good season personally, which is always great. So, yes, I am looking forward to carrying that on into these games.” Finally, Kane was asked about how he would like to be remembered as a sportsman. Hinting that he maybe has plans to become a professional golfer when finishing football, he said: “I guess the ideal career would be a World Cup, a Super Bowl and maybe a Masters green jacket, if I am lucky enough to do that as well. “Football is my first thought always and it is what has got me to where I am now. I still enjoy training and every game I play. “I would love to win the World Cup, there is not one player who wouldn’t. It is my next opportunity to win a trophy, so I’m really looking forward to that.”","pubDate":"2022-06-03 21:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun_ie","country":["ireland"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ICC chair questions place of Women's Tests in cricket calendar","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/international/icc-chair-questions-place-of-womens-tests-in-cricket-calendar-7e86c565-f609-45c2-b858-48e57e309e0f","keywords":null,"creator":["AFP"],"video_url":null,"description":"International Cricket Council chairman Greg Barclay says he would like to see women's Test matches played over five days instead of four.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-03 19:56:38","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/1bfa4909-3822-5964-b99d-b9557d51bdc7&operation=CROP&offset=0x191&resize=3635x2043","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-New Zealand have &#039;big job&#039; to do against England on day three - Blundell","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/04/cricket-new-zealand-have-039big-job039-to-do-against-england-on-day-three---blundell","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LONDON (Reuters) - Tom Blundell was pleased with his formidable partnership with Daryl Mitchell that put New Zealand in control of the first test against England but the wicket-keeper batsman said they still have a \"big job\" to do on day three at Lord's.

Blundell (90 not out) and Mitchell (97 not out) added 180 runs for the fifth wicket to revive New Zealand and take a solid 227-run lead on the second day. Wickets tumbled on a frantic first day and in the morning session of day two but world test champions New Zealand showed resilience with the bat in the afternoon and evening sessions as they fought back and put pressure on the hosts. \"I was just doing my things and playing the way I like to play,\" Blundell told reporters. \"I was being positive... I thought Daryl batted especially well and to build a partnership with him was pretty pleasing.\" England's fast bowlers bundled out New Zealand for 132 in the first innings but they struggled to find a way past Blundell and Mitchell on Friday. Asked about how the Black Caps duo managed to break the bowlers' rhythm, Blundell said: \"I think it was about trying to play the ball late and look to hit really straight. \"The pitch is a little bit slow, quite hard to get a rhythm at times, but if you get through that and keep on bringing the bowlers back -- I thought we did that really well.\" Blundell remains 10 runs away from his third century in the longest format and also getting his name featured on the iconic Lord's honours board. \"Obviously it would mean a lot but there is a long way to go in this game,\" he added. \"Daryl and I have a big job tomorrow to build that lead. \"Those milestones will take care of themselves but first and foremost we got our job to do.\" (Reporting by Manasi Pathak in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar)","pubDate":"2022-06-03 19:51:00","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/06/04/1610545.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“I received a call from Alan Butcher to play for England”: How Steve Smith could have easily played for England but chose Australia instead","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-i-received-a-call-from-alan-butcher-to-play-for-england-how-steve-smith-could-have-easily-played-for-england-but-chose-australia-instead/","keywords":["Cricket","Steve Smith"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith could have easily played for England had he accepted a lip smacking offer from Surrey as part of a three-year deal.

Ask a random Cricket fan to list his/her picks for the greatest batters from the current generation, and Steve Smith would certainly find his name at least in their top-5. No wonder, a huge section of the followers of the sport even regard him as the best Test batter amongst active players, with numbers backing their claim as well. His present average of 59.77 is best amongst active cricketers, and the sixth-best all time (irrespective of the number of innings played). In the year 2017, Smith became only the second batsman to score over 1,000 Test runs for four successive years (2014-2017), and also went on to surpass the 1,000 run-mark with an average of over 50 in each of these years, becoming the first player do so. Already a legend for Australia in the sport, the 33-year-old is fortunate enough to represent Australia at the international level, because as per a latest revelation by the man himself, his fate to represent his country laid rest on one very important decision he had to take at a very early age in his career.

Thoughts and prayers for his shoulder at this time #SLvAUS pic.twitter.com/oHuQ6g7Eht — Louis Cameron (@LouisDBCameron) June 3, 2022 As per his new book titled ‘The Journey’, the Australian mainstay has revealed that he had received a lucrative three-year contract offer from the English county club Surrey to play for them, back when he was mere 18 years of age. It is worth of a mention that Smith was the holder of the British passport then, and had a mind-boggling offer up his sleeve, way more than what Cricket New South Wales (NSW) had paid him as part of his first ever Cricket contract later. “I had to decide whether I wanted to press on with ambition to play for New South Wales and, ultimately, Australia or throw in my lot with English county side Surrey and pursue the possibility of playing international cricket for England,” Smith wrote in his book, The Journey. “The Surrey club was aware of my status as a British passport holder and so I received a call from Alan Butcher, the former England opening batsman and father of fellow England international Mark Butcher, with the offer of the three-year deal. It was a lot of money to potentially throw at an 18-year-old and I’d never conceived of such a large amount in my life. If it had been about money then it would have been no contest. Surrey were offering me a three-year deal worth around £30,000 per year while my first rookie contract with Cricket NSW netted me around AUD$12,000.” Clearing his mind away from money trap, the Aussie legend returned back to Australia and made his FC debut for NSW in January 2008, before making his debut for Australia across all formats in 2010.","pubDate":"2022-06-03 19:03:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Toxic relationship with money an elephant in the long room at Lord’s | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jun/03/toxic-relationship-with-money-elephant-in-long-room-lords-first-test-england-new-zealand","keywords":["England v New Zealand 2022","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew at Lord's"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lord’s works the senses so thoroughly that attendees of England v New Zealand barely notice it working their walletsThe second evening at Lord’s, and the day has begun to sag a little.

New Zealand’s Mitchell and Blundell ease first Test away from England Read more “Lord’s is a cashless ground,” announces a message on the big screen as you enter, a statement that is true only until the moment your bank statement drops. But then this has always been the genius of Lord’s: a place that works the senses so thoroughly that you barely notice the efficiency with which it is simultaneously working your wallet. They don’t really obsess about anything as vulgar as money here, largely because for centuries it has been run by the sort of people with so much of it that it hardly matters. We got a taste of this earlier in the week, when the MCC was fleetingly blindsided by a sudden controversy over ticket prices for the first Test. Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes both spoke out. Pundits and journalists fumed at the audacity of charging £160 to watch one-fifth of a cricket match. Eventually, confronted with a deluge of sour headlines, the club was forced to issue an extra tranche of £20 junior tickets for the fourth day and a promise to review their prices for the 2023 season. The cricket began. Everyone moved on. In one sense the whole affair was vaguely overblown. Ticket prices at Lord’s smashed through the £100 barrier some years ago and hardly anybody batted an eyelid. And as for empty seats – well, have you ever been to Lord’s? Even at its sold-out capacity, Lord’s always has empty seats. People drift away and drift back. People arrive late and go home early. There are punters who barely use their seat at all, for whom a day at Lord’s is primarily a chance to catch up with old friends and have a mosey about the place. All this is fine. But in another sense the MCC’s evident discomfort was quietly revealing. Ben Stokes gives instructions on a Lord’s day where England passed up the early advantage they’d pressed on day one. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian After all, one of the unspoken maxims of Lord’s is that pecuniary matters are the sort of thing the little people like to worry about. An Englishman’s bank account is his castle and all that. And besides, this is a place that likes to think itself above the vulgarity of pounds and pence. It’s an experience, a confraternity, a guild. If you need to ask the price of the suit, old boy, then you can’t afford it. Of course, behind the scenes the terrain has been shifting for a while. For most of the last decade the club has been embroiled in a civil war between its traditionalists and the speculators. The pandemic cost the MCC around £30m in lost revenue. The controversial redevelopment of the Compton and Edrich Stands cost £52m. Two years ago the club voted through – against stiff internal opposition – plans to allow the super-rich to purchase express membership, thus jumping the famously epochal waiting list. The home secretary, Priti Patel, was one of the first to sign up, paying £45,000. Matt Parkinson gets rare chance to give England leg-spin at Lord’s | Andy Bull Read more And if you visit Lord’s today what strikes you above all is the whiff of money, the way it swirls through the corridors and concourses like limited-edition aftershave, the sensation of being sold a premium experience. The City boys in shirts and aviator sunglasses. The City girls in designer dresses and uncomfortable-looking shoes. Not much more than a decade ago, as a scruffy and impoverished student, I used to be able to sit in the Compton Lower for £35. But Lord’s doesn’t want people like us any more. Perhaps this feels like a charmingly parochial thing to get annoyed about. But in a way the entire sport is being rebuilt along similar lines. At tea the ICC chair, Greg Barclay, was interviewed on Test Match Special and mentioned revenue or money 10 times in the first six or seven minutes. Barclay baldly stated that with Twenty20 franchise leagues and ICC tournaments in the ascendant, bilateral Test cricket would inevitably be cut in future. “There will be some unfortunate consequences – from a revenue generation perspective – for some of those countries who won’t get the amount of cricket they will hope to have,” he said. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. So often the debate on the future of Test cricket gets reduced to absurd abstractions like attention spans and over rates. Similarly, administrators chatter away happily about diversity and representation, set up task forces and working groups, without ever coming close to addressing the elephant in the room. There is not a problem in world cricket that can be solved without addressing its toxic relationship with money. But it’s awkward, and besides Lord’s isn’t really the place to discuss these things. So instead you go for another drink, tap your card on the reader, wait for the bleep.","pubDate":"2022-06-03 18:31:11","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7f0e80fa3506d19da94b9f3fd50bba906116d0/0_190_5073_3043/master/5073.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=964022356b164b5dd5e2c70c426f660e","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Matt Parkinson gets rare chance to give England leg-spin at Lord’s | Andy Bull","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jun/03/matt-parkinson-has-rare-challenge-of-bowling-leg-spin-for-england-at-lords","keywords":["England v New Zealand 2022","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Andy Bull at Lord's"],"video_url":null,"description":"Test captain Ben Stokes turned to his side’s replacement spinner on day two against New Zealand – with mixed resultsBy three o’clock in the afternoon the match was just starting to drag.

This first day and a half of the Test unspooled at such a frantic pace that the burgeoning stand between Tom Blundell and Daryl Mitchell made everyone feel a little restless and uncomfortable, like Lord’s was caught in an awkward silence that had stretched on too long. They’d only been going an hour, which would have been routine business in almost any other Test, but this one’s run in fast forward. The way they’ve been going at it in this match has made playing Test cricket feel like trying to ride a Victorian bicycle: it’s essentially familiar, and yet somehow all very different to how we do it now. New Zealand’s Mitchell and Blundell ease first Test away from England Read more It was at this moment Ben Stokes finally decided to bring on Matt Parkinson. Lord’s ruffled. You could hear the crowd mutter and shuffle as neighbours prodded each other in the ribs. “The leg-spinner’s coming on.” There are periodic comets that come around more often. The Lord’s crowd saw (and promptly forgot) a couple of fleeting overs of it from Joe Denly in the Ashes Test back in 2019. Before that, you have to go all the way to the summer of 1996 to find the last time England bowled a leg-spinner in a Test here, when they played Ian Salisbury against Pakistan. You’re more likely to have seen the Queen here in the last 25 years than you are an Englishman bowling a leg-break. Parkinson is a bristling little bowler, whose hunched shoulders and mean glare make him seem a bit like he’s just popped up from underneath a bridge to nick a wicket off a passing batsman. He got through six overs for 21 runs in his first spell. They were a rich mix, with the odd full toss and long hop among some lovely deliveries that drew shouts and sighs from the close fielders, especially when Blundell almost yorked himself by trying to come down the wicket to hit him back over his head. Parkinson had a better time of it than either of the other two specialist leg-spinners England have played at Lord’s since Salisbury. Chris Schofield got a game against Zimbabwe in 2000 and Adil Rashid another against India 18 years later, but neither got a bowl in either game. The irony, of course, is that England didn’t actually pick Parkinson for this match. He was only here because he’d been called up as a substitute after Jack Leach concussed himself when he was chasing a ball to the boundary early on the first morning. Parkinson, who had to travel down from Manchester, spent most of his first day of Test cricket on the M1. Matt Parkinson in action on the second day. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian It beats carrying the drinks, which is what he’s been doing for most of the time since they first called him up to the Test squad in 2019. He’s been a beverage-delivery specialist. “I feel like a privileged stepdad from all the time I’ve spent with you over the last two or three years,” said England’s spin coach, Jeetan Patel, when he presented him with his cap before the start of play. They’ve spent a lot of time in the nets together. Parkinson’s been on the England pathway for years. He came up through their under-17, under-19 and Lions teams; it was only when they got to the point that they actually needed to pick him for Test cricket that they started wavering. Careless Broad characterises England tail with little offered or delivered | Simon Burnton Read more Quite why the game’s so leery about leg-spin is between English cricket and its therapist. They’ve had a few to choose from in recent years, and it’s never ended up well. Scott Borthwick got one Test in Australia in 2014, and never played again. Mason Crane got another four years later, and hasn’t been seen since either. Rashid, who is perhaps the best England have ever had, played 19 games, the last of them in 2019, and has ended up turning away from red-ball cricket because he had shoulder problems. England never came close to getting the best out of him in Test cricket. There are a lot more around the counties right now, Matt Critchley at Essex, Luke Hollman at Middlesex, Rehan Ahmed at Leicestershire, Archie Lenham at Sussex, who all came up through white-ball cricket. Parkinson, who has 126 first-class wickets at 23, is the best of them. Whether that means he’s good enough is another question, and one that will take longer to answer than he’ll likely get. You could already hear the judgments calcifying around him by the time he was into his second spell. Like Rashid, he will have to deal with the accusation that he bowls too slowly to succeed at this level of the game, (invariably from people who know a lot less about his craft than he does himself). The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Of course Rashid could bat, too. Parkinson, on the other hand, is the first man to come in below Jimmy Anderson since Boyd Rankin (another one-cap England wonder) played in 2014. He’s made one fifty in his career, for Lancashire under-17s in 2013, and that’s it. So he’ll have to make his case with his bowling. Anyone who watched Shane Warne, and there’s been plenty of opportunity to do it these last few days, knows that leg-spin involves a little kidology. What’s less clear with Parkinson is who he’s kidding, the batsmen, or all us misty-eyed romantics who like to think that a wrist-spinner has a future in Test cricket in England.","pubDate":"2022-06-03 18:09:54","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45e5617b1fdfc640adcc3acbed92f9c96ed5939e/0_0_4539_2723/master/4539.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b13efa3e1e368ddbb83ee340fa84ae3","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Weather forecast in Lord’s London: Will it rain on Day 3 of ENG vs NZ 1st Test match at Lord’s Cricket Ground?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-weather-forecast-in-lords-london-will-it-rain-on-day-3-of-eng-vs-nz-1st-test-match-at-lords-cricket-ground/","keywords":["Cricket","England","Lord's Cricket Ground","Lord's Test","New Zealand","New Zealand tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Weather forecast in Lord’s London: Advantage New Zealand in the second innings, but rain may prove to be the obstacle cometh Day 3.

After Stumps on Day 2 of the ongoing first Test match between England and New Zealand at the Lord’s Cricket Ground, the Kiwi middle-order batters in Daryl Mitchell (97*) and Tom Blundell (90*) have stitched together an unbeaten 180*- run partnership for the fifth wicket, to make a stellar comeback after a poor show with the bat in the first innings. After restricting the England batters to a slender 9-run lead in the first innings, New Zealand were off to yet another poor start with the bat, losing their top-4 batters at the score of 56. However, batting throughout most part of the second session, and then the entire third session of the day unscathed, New Zealand are now sitting at an authoritative position where they can now dictate terms, unless they witness yet another collapse in the morning tomorrow. After the end of day’s play, the Kane Williamson-led side have managed to take a handy lead of 227 runs, with the scorecard reading 236/4 in 79 Overs.

At around 2 pm, there is the forecast of yet another spell of rain, post which the conditions are likely to remain pleasant until Stumps are called on Day 3 of this nicely poised Test match.

With the sport’s focus increasingly trained on shorter formats, Barclay does not expect a scheduling surge. England v New Zealand: first Test, day two – live! Read more “If you look at the way cricket is going there is no doubt that white ball is the way of the future – that is the game that is sought after by the fans, where the broadcasters are putting their resources and what is driving the money,” Barclay said. “Therefore the counties that are developing women’s cricket will focus on that. In order to play Test cricket you have to the structures in place domestically and they don’t really exist, so I can’t really see women’s Test or long-form cricket evolving at any speed at all. That’s not to say they can’t choose to play Test cricket, but I don’t really see that as part of the landscape moving forward to any real extent.” Barclay, who was elected chair of the ICC in 2020 having been a director of New Zealand cricket for the previous eight years, played down the possibility of Afghanistan being stripped of full member status because of their failure to operate a women’s team, suggesting the collapse of the women’s game in the country since Taliban retook control last year represented “something of a blip”. “The people involved in Afghan cricket assure me they are doing everything they can to get the women’s game better established and what has happened is hopefully something of a blip in that process,” he said. “Some other members have also had slow progress in developing a women’s game so let’s give it time.” Rly disappointing comments from ICC Chair Greg Barclay on women's cricket on @bbctms .

In 10 or 15 years time I still see Test cricket being an integral part, [but] some of the smaller full members will have to accept that they can’t play the amount of Test cricket that they want to.”","pubDate":"2022-06-03 17:09:35","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9abbd0dcf2d58e90494fcd5c595278f62b5d4e9/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b06f959a5745a50f1a805f1991eb6627","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England Cricket vice captain 2022: Who is England men’s Test team vice-captain?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-england-cricket-vice-captain-2022-who-is-england-mens-test-team-vice-captain/","keywords":["Cricket","England","England vice-captain"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"England Cricket vice captain 2022: The England men’s side have embarked on a new journey in the Test format under Ben Stokes at Lord’s.

During the first Test match between England and New Zealand at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground, both the sides have had poor returns with the bat so far, getting all-out in each of their first-innings with not even two complete days into the Test. Termed as the ‘new era’ under the captain-coach duo of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, England were right on the money with the ball led by the pace attack of James Anderson, as they bundled up the Kiwi batting line-up for a paltry 132 in mere 40 Overs. England in reply, with a 59-run stand for the first wicket, looked clearly on the front-foot to dominate the match proceedings. But, the Kiwi pacers turned up too big time, to restrict them to 141 in 42.5 Overs. The experienced Kiwi pacers in Trent Boult and Tim Southee forced the much needed collapse, to leave England with a slender 9-run lead. In the second innings, despite yet another top-order collapse, an unbeaten 147-run partnership (at the time of writing) between Daryl Mitchell (77*) and Tom Blundell (77*) for the 5th wicket, has managed to take the New Zealand lead close to 200. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who appointed Ben Stokes as the captain of their men’s Test side replacing Joe Root exactly a month ago, have not yet named Stokes’ deputy or vice-captain of the team. However, the English star all-rounder did remark that there are “five or six people” who are in the frontrunners for the role, while ruling out Joe Root of those. “The vice captain is a very important and crucial role. Sometimes it can just be seen as a token gesture. You have got to help your captain. I know how vital I was in helping Joe along that road. “Joe will always be someone I look to for advice, someone players will turn to for advice. He has captained the team for five years, it would be stupid not to ask for advice. But making him vice-captain would be a bit backward as if I left the field he would be captain again and he has just stepped down, exclaimed Stokes at the Chester-Le-Street in Durham last month. Thus, England are on with the three-match Test series against New Zealand without a designated vice-captain of the side.","pubDate":"2022-06-03 16:51:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kyle Coetzer to stand down as Scotland captain after UAE clash","link":"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/other-sport/kyle-coetzer-to-stand-down-as-scotland-captain-after-uae-clash-3719701","keywords":["Other Sport","Sport"],"creator":["Clive Wellington"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kyle Coetzer is to stand down as Scotland captain after Friday's ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 tri-series fixture against the UAE.","content":"comments The match in Texas will be Coetzer's 110th as skipper and his 214th appearance for Scotland , making him the country's third most capped player.

New Zealand were 4-128 in the second innings before the end of the afternoon session on Friday, having been bundled out for 132 in the first innings. All-rounder Mitchell (43 not out) struck five boundaries in a formidable batting display, which came as a relief to the Black Caps who crumbled against England's fast bowlers in the first innings. After wickets tumbled on the opening day and the first session on day two, there was a sense of calm in the afternoon as New Zealand lost just one wicket and finally found a firm batting partnership. The reigning world Test champions, who were 3-38 at lunch, lost Devon Conway (13) in the 23rd over of the second innings after the returning Stuart Broad strangled him down legside. Conway's departure brought an end to his 9.3 overs-partnership with Mitchell, which looked promising. Mitchell, nonetheless, combined well with wicket-keeper batsman Blundell (39 not out) as the visitors kept the Test evenly poised ahead of the final session on day two.

We have seen that there are various people who fight for a humanitarian cause. In fact, we have seen the recent fight against racism in sports. During any FIFA recognised football league, we have seen a banner on the field that encourages us to stand against racism. In cricket also, we have seen players getting down on their knees, as a gesture against racism. But rarely have we seen instances when a single personality fights for a humanitarian cause both on screen and on the field.  In Jona Xiao, we have such a rare example. She has dedicated her life to a humanitarian cause. She is bravely fighting against racism directed against Asian-Americans. Jona is doing this by trying to increase AAPI representation in one way or the other. Read the article to know more about her fight.  Who Is Jona Xiao? People who watch television might be familiar with the name Jona Xiao. She has been attached to Hollywood for quite some time. In fact, she is an acclaimed Hollywood star. She played the role of Daisy in “Hightown” on STARZ. She has also done a famous voice-over in the famed Disney animation, “Raya and the Last Dragon”. In that animation, she gave voice to the character, Young Namaari.  Apart from this, the 33-year old is the founder and captain of a Los Angeles-based flag football team, She Unit. In the world of football, she works in order to earn recognition for Women’s football. As a Chinese-American woman, she herself has been fighting various stereotypes about Asian-Americans and women’s football. Therefore, her fight is multi-layered. It also involves a lot of risks. But Jona Xiao seems to enjoy her fights. How Was Jona Introduced to Football? The football life of Jona Xiao began in her adulthood when she was settled in Los Angeles and was working as an actor. She grew up playing lacrosse. In fact, she went on to become an Academic All-American and All-State lacrosse player in high school. Later she disclosed the way in which she took up football. Jona Xiao narrated that one day she showed up for beach football. Out of curiosity, she joined the game. Some people present there were impressed with her performance and coached her. This is how Jona got introduced to football. Jona Xiao And Women’s Football On the field, Jona has always let her game do the talking. In fact, her game earned her an exclusive sponsorship from Team Milk. Team Milk, by selecting four women footballers drives home the message that “football is football”. During a Super Bowl spot, Jona and her other three Team Milk mates drove home the same message. They showed that women can also excel in a male-dominated sport. The truth is that there are many talented women football players out there. But they don’t even know about the existence of football leagues for women. However, there are tackle and flag leagues that offer athletes like Jona a chance to join the game. Jona admitted that previously there was a lack of proper opportunity for women in sports. Thus, she thanked Team Milk for doing such a wonderful job. She also encourages Asian athletes, women and girls to take up sports.  Flag Football And Jona Various people complain that flag football is ‘soft’. They say that flag football lacks physical play. However, Jona Xiao says that there is nothing casual or ‘soft’ in flag football. There was no flag football team for women. But Jona wanted one. Therefore she wanted to change it. With this view in mind, she founded the She Unit. This was also her attempt to defy the ‘soft’ nature of flag football. She wanted to prove that the female talent of the  West Coast was not ‘soft’.  Incidentally, soon her football career acquired the stardom of her lacrosse career. She went on to garner national recognition on the preliminary 2020 roster for the Team USA flag football team. She also admitted her fondness for Jo Overstreet. Overstreet is also known as “Lady OBJ”. She also voiced her fondness for Russell Wilson. Incidentally, both Xiao and Wilson are 33-year-old quarterbacks sharing the No. 3 jersey. Interestingly, both of them have led their teams to world championships.  According to Flag Football World Championship Tour, Xiao’s She-Unit is currently the No. 1-ranked flag football team out of 876 men’s and women’s teams. Moreover, they have also won the world championship twice.  Racism and Stereotyping Faced By Jona Jona is the star quarterback of the nation’s premier flag football team. Yet she has had her experience of racism. In a 2017 interview, she disclosed how she faced racism at St.Louis high school. She is also fighting the stereotypes about Asian-Americans and the “model minority myth”. But in the field, she faced more adversity. As a woman, she stepped into the ‘men’s domain’. Though there had been women playing American football for over 100 years, many have not been successful in garnering respect. However, she says that she is enjoying her fight both on screen and offscreen. Concluding Lines Rose Low was another first-generation Chinese-American Angeleno. She became the starting quarterback for the Los Angeles Dandelions in the early 1970s. Jona Xiao is therefore continuing that tradition but in a new era. She has become a representative face of women’s football with Team Milk. Jona has become a representative figure of what Asian women are capable of.

Kane Williamson (15) then fell victim to debutant Matthew Potts again after the England paceman forced him off the back foot but got a thick edge to Jonny Bairstow at third slip. Potts earlier removed Williamson in the first innings for his first test wicket. The 23-year-old Durham bowler continued to have the dreamiest of debuts after he soon removed Tom Latham (14) as New Zealand were reduced to 35-3 in the 14th over. Devon Conway (6 not out) and Daryl Mitchell (2 not out) were on the crease before the end of the first session. ENGLAND ALL OUT FOR 141 IN FIRST INNINGS Earlier, England were bowled out for 141 in reply to New Zealand's 132, with the hosts earning a mere nine-run lead at the start of the second day. After yet another batting collapse on the opening day, England started the second day on 116-7 but their tail-end could not survive for long as they were sent packing within nearly half an hour from the start. Tim Southee (4-55) and Trent Boult (3-21) led New Zealand's fight-back with the ball after a disappointing performance from their batting order in the first innings.
