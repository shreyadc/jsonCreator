Kent wicketkeeper Billings emerged as a shock candidate for the England job after Joe Root stepped down from the role in April. The 30-year-old only made his Test debut in January during the fifth Ashes Test in Australia, but has been a regular in Eoin Morgan’s white-ball team and is respected not only as a dynamic player but as an astute captain and franchise star. Billings was playing for Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders when Root resigned and says his IPL colleagues quickly caught on to the fact he was being linked with the job. ‘It was funny because at the time I think I was the second favourite for the job. I had Baz [former Kolkata head coach Brendon McCullum], Pat Cummins and Tim Southee all literally just taking the mickey out of me the whole time,’ Billings told Metro.co.uk. ‘Pat would go, “heads or tails mate?” when he saw me. There were lots of jokes going around. But look, it was all hearsay. There just wasn’t that many options around. At the end of the day the right decision was made.’ The decision Billings is referring to is Ben Stokes’ appointment as Root’s replacement. While Stokes was virtually the only viable candidate, the early signs have been promising, with the all-rounder leading England to a brilliant five-wicket victory over New Zealand in his first Test as captain. Billings has featured regularly for England’s white-ball teams (Picture: Getty) ‘It was always going to be Stokesy and that was absolutely the right decision,’ Billings added. ‘I’ve known him since the age of 13 and he always leads from the front and sets the example in terms of his work ethic. ‘There’s no doubt that he is the right man to take England forward. His journey over the last few years is a great example; everyone goes through difficult times but to come out the other side is a great thing to do. ‘From my point of view, I just want to continue to grow as a player and a captain [for Kent and Oval Invincibles].’ Having played under McCullum at the IPL, Billings is well placed to discuss his qualities as a coach. McCullum – one of New Zealand’s greatest ever players – signed a four-year deal to take over England’s Test side in May and enjoyed a winning start to his reign at Lord’s last week. ‘Above all he’s a great human being,’ Billings said. ‘He’s done everything you can do in the game and that’s a pretty good mix to have when you’re in a job like that. The Kent star has heaped praise on Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum (Picture: Getty) ‘I’m not surprised at the impact he’s had already. He will be a phenomenal addition to English cricket and there’s no doubt he’s the right man to take the team forward.’ Billings’ Kent team-mate Zak Crawley endured another frustrating outing in the series opener against New Zealand, making 43 in the first innings and nine in the second. Crawley looked set to make a significant contribution on day one before nicking behind, a familiar story in his career to date. The 24-year-old averages less than 30 after 22 Tests, having registered a stunning double century against Pakistan in 2020, a hundred in the Caribbean earlier in the year and a series of low scores in-between. Asked if he believes Crawley will cement his place at the top of the order, Billings said: ‘Anyone who scores a double hundred in international cricket, talent is not the issue. ‘He’s world-class. He’s got the mind-set and the drive to crack it at the top level. Everyone is judged on results, that’s pretty obvious, but as a young player he’s learning all the time. Billings has backed his Kent team-mate Zak Crawley (Picture: Getty) ‘We saw Joe Root average 90-odd in his first year in Test cricket and then have a slight dip. But he came back soon after that and now he’s one of the best players we’ve ever had. ‘I know Zak really well and he will be absolutely fine. I’m one of his biggest fans and I’ve got no doubt he will be absolutely fine.’ Billings has been featuring for T20 Blast champions Kent since returning from India and will captain Oval Invincibles in the second edition of The Hundred later in the summer. Tom Moody’s Invincibles finished fourth last summer, narrowly missing out on the play-offs as Southern Brave became the first men’s champions. Billings said: ‘It was disappointing not to qualify last summer with the quality we’ve got. We should have been in the play-offs but a huge amount of learning took place. ‘We’ve got a really good squad and Sam Curran being fit is great news for us, he’s a world-class all-rounder in both facets of the game. The core of the side has stayed the same which is encouraging. The second edition of The Hundred takes place in August (Picture: Getty) ‘There’s no doubt about the quality we possess so there’s absolutely no reason why we can’t go one better and get into those knockout games. ‘It’s a great tournament and the key thing is the pace, it doesn’t go on for too long and every game has a huge amount of significance. We’ve got some of the best players in the world playing in a tournament held during the best part of the summer. What’s not to like?’ Given the nature of The Hundred, it would not be a surprise to see tactical batting retirements become a frequent part of the tournament. India’s Ravichandran Ashwin became the first player in Indian Premier League history to be retired out after he walked off during a game for Rajasthan Royals in April, while two players voluntarily walked off during a T20 Blast game last week. https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd3O1PeN6bV/ Billings disagrees with the principle of tactical retirements but admits as a captain he will more than likely indulge in cricket’s latest white-ball trend. ‘The game is definitely moving forward and match-ups present a huge part of the game from a tactical element,’ he said. ‘I see it coming into the game far more and I see the benefit, of course I do. ‘Whether I agree with it, I’m yet to make my mind up. It doesn’t sit that well with me, if I’m being totally honest. It’s just one part of the game where the bowler is actually on top of you and earns the right to be on top. ‘I’m not sure you can have that easy an option to just walk off. That’s my opinion. The whole point of the game is to try and get yourself out of difficult situations. It’s a bit of a cop-out, let’s be honest, passing on the responsibility to someone else. I just don’t like it.’ More: CricketEx-Yorkshire head coach wins unfair dismissal case in wake of Azeem Rafiq racism scandalEngland name 14-man ODI squad for Netherlands tourJoe Root pays touching tribute to Shane Warne after guiding England to victory For more stories like this, check our sport page.

Having made her debut as a 16-year-old in 1999, Mithali's career has spanned nearly 23 years across four different decades during which time she became the central cog in the growth of the women's game in the country and beyond. Mithali finished international career with a staggering 10,868 runs - the most in women's cricket. She scored 7805 ODI runs in 232 matches, at an average just over 50 while has 2364 runs in 89 T20Is, as well as 699 runs in 12 Tests, including a century and four half-centuries. The 39-year-old Mithali, who captained India to the final of the ICC Women's World Cup 2017, also holds the record for the most matches (28 matches) captained in Women's World Cups, breaking Australian legend Belinda Clark's record during the ICC Women's World Cup 2022 in March. She also led India to four consecutive Asia Cup triumphs -- 2005-06, 2006-07, 2008, 2012. However, perhaps Mithali's most significant achievement as captain came in 2014 as India sealed a historic Test series victory in England, with Mithali guiding the team home with an unbeaten 50 in the second innings. As a skipper, Mithali has 89 wins out of 155 - the most by any player in women's ODIs. Her 155 matches as captain is also the highest in women's ODIs. The batter also became the second youngest centurion after she scored a century on ODI debut in 1999. At 16 years and 205 days, she became the youngest centurion in women's internationals.","pubDate":"2022-06-08 19:16:59","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/06/08/500x300_1296768-mithali-raj.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia's cricket team is touring Sri Lanka when the country can barely keep the lights on - ABC News","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA2LTA5L2V0aGljcy1vZi1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLWNyaWNrZXQtdGVhbS1pbi1zcmktbGFua2EvMTAxMTI5MTg40gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia's cricket team is touring Sri Lanka when the country can barely keep the lights on  ABC NewsFinch, Warner go whack in T20 thrashing  news.com.auAustralia beats Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in T20 hammering  Wide World of SportsAustralia beats Sri Lanka by three wickets in Colombo to take 2-0 lead in three-match T20I series  ABC NewsAussies survive big collapse in ‘weird’ T20 win as WC hero saves the day  Fox SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-08 18:42:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"A poster girl for women’s cricket, Mithali showed the path for a generation","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/a-poster-girl-for-womens-cricket-mithali-showed-the-path-for-a-generation/article65507542.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        P.

She answered to the name Mithali Raj. For more than two decades, she carried the bat for the Women in Blue — and on the rare occasions when they wore whites — in admirable fashion. She announced her retirement from international cricket, at the age of 39, on Wednesday. India’s match against South Africa in the Women’s World Cup at Christchurch on March 27 has turned out to be her last. It had all begun when her father took her to her brother’s cricket training sessions at Secunderabad where the coach first spotted her potential. The game will miss her assured presence at the wicket, and those beauteous cover drives. Her friendly smile — even at the end of a demanding or even disappointing day — will also be missed. She has been a fine ambassador for women’s cricket. Mithali shattered several batting records. She inspired many girls to pick up a cricket bat when it wasn’t the most glamorous thing to do. From her bat have flown 7,805 runs in 232 ODIs and 2,364 in 89 T20Is. If she played only in 12 Tests, that is because women get to play a few of them. She scored 699 runs in those Tests; her 214, which she made at Taunton against England in 2002, remains the second highest individual score in Women’s Tests. With 10,868 runs, she is the leading scorer in international women’s cricket. She is also the highest run-getter in WODIs, in which she made a stunning debut aged 16 in 1999, with an unbeaten 114 against Ireland at Milton Keynes. She led India in two World Cup finals. By the time Mithali reached the evening of her career, Indian women’s cricket was no longer just about her, or the champion bowler and her contemporary, Jhulan Goswami. If the game has several bright stars now in Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur and Shafali Verma, she is one of the biggest reasons for that. She was the Sunil Gavaskar of women’s cricket the Sachin Tendulkars and Rahul Dravids wanted to emulate.

Chasing 125, world champions Australia struggled against Wanindu Hasaranga's (4-33) spin before Matthew Wade's run-a-ball 26 not out secured a tense victory with 13 balls to spare. Put into bat, Sri Lanka struggled to get going and rode cameos from Charith Asalanka (39) and Kusal Mendis (36) to post a below-par 124-9, barely avoiding being bowled out inside 20 overs. Australia's ploy to open their attack with Glenn Maxwell (2-18) paid off with the off-spinner dismissing opener Danushka Gunathilaka in the first over. Australia were without fast bowler Mitchell Starc who slit the index finger of his bowling hand on his shoe spike during the tourists' 10-wicket win in Tuesday's series opener. His replacement Jhye Richardson (3-26) ensured Australia did not feel Starc's absence and Kane Richardson claimed 4-30 to restrict Sri Lanka. For Australia, captain Aaron Finch (24) began well but Hasaranga rocked their top order and David Warner (21) was run out after a mix-up with Maxwell as their chase threatened to unravel. Hasaranga dismissed Maxwell and Ashton Agar in successive deliveries but Wade calmed Australian nerves and secured victory with a four off Gunathilaka. The teams move to Pallekele for the final Twenty20, which will be followed by five one-dayers and two test matches.

The Indian Cricket team, without the presence of some of their big guns in the squad, were handed a heavy blow after KL Rahul, their designated skipper for the five-match T20I series against South Africa was ruled out of the entire series due to his right groin injury. “He (KL Rahul) felt pain and he was checked on Wednesday morning. The team management decided that as a measure of precaution, as well keeping the England series in mind, he will be withdrawn from the South Africa series,” said a source in the knowledge of the development, as per Cricbuzz. While one man’s misfortune is another man’s opportunity, wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant has been elevated to the post of skipper , and is now set to lead the Indian team, for the very first time in front of his home crowd at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium tomorrow onwards. Additionally, at 24 years and 248 days, the Delhi wicket-keeper batter will also become the second-youngest Indian captain to lead the team in the T20 format. Rahul, who has had quite an affair with injuries for team India off-late, took to his social media handle to express his disappointment for having lost the opportunity to lead team India for the first time at home. Having said that, he also wished Rishabh Pant the best of luck for his maiden stint as the team’s captain, while also remarking to support the team from the sidelines.

It remains to be seen if he will be available for the Test match against England from July 1 in Birmingham, which is also a part of the World Test Championship (WTC) and the five-match Test series for the Pataudi Trophy.","pubDate":"2022-06-08 17:37:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘We know we’re going to have to play good cricket,’ says Temba Bavuma ahead of first T20 against India","link":"https://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/proteas/we-know-were-going-to-have-to-play-good-cricket-says-temba-bavuma-ahead-of-first-t20-against-india-2582d8e1-b293-43ca-8d9f-d9dfb466ff51","keywords":null,"creator":["Zaahier Adams"],"video_url":null,"description":"Temba Bavuma’s Proteas and India will go head to head in the first of five T20 interntionals in Delhi on Thursday afternoon.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-08 17:31:10","image_url":"https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/1964de82-f306-5723-89f1-b0042c0eed43&operation=CROP&offset=0x0&resize=3660x2056","source_id":"iol","country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs SA: RCB Shared A Hilarious Tweet After Rishabh Pant Was Named Team India’s Captain - The Cricket Lounge","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JpY2tldGxvdW5nZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNi9pbmQtdnMtc2EtcmNiLXNoYXJlZC1hLWhpbGFyaW91cy10d2VldC1hZnRlci1yaXNoYWJoLXBhbnQtd2FzLW5hbWVkLXRlYW0taW5kaWFzLWNhcHRhaW4v0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs SA: RCB Shared A Hilarious Tweet After Rishabh Pant Was Named Team India’s Captain  The Cricket LoungeView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-08 17:13:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"Did Not Come Under Very Good Circumstances...\": Rishabh Pant After Being Named India Captain Post K.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pbmRpYS12cy1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtMjAyMi9kaWQtbm90LWNvbWUtdW5kZXItdmVyeS1nb29kLWNpcmN1bXN0YW5jZXMtcmlzaGFiaC1wYW50LWFmdGVyLWJlaW5nLW5hbWVkLWluZGlhLWNhcHRhaW4tcG9zdC1rbC1yYWh1bHMtaW5qdXJ5LTMwNDk4ODXSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"Did Not Come Under Very Good Circumstances...\": Rishabh Pant After Being Named India Captain Post K..  NDTV SportsKL Rahul & Kuldeep Yadav ruled out!

As fate pleasantly surprises people, it did today to Rishabh Pant as the Delhi wicket-keeper batter has been elevated to the post of captain of the Indian Cricket team for the five-match T20I series against South Africa, with the series opener set to be played tomorrow (Thursday) at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. The BCCI decided to go for the sudden change after the team’s designated skipper for the series – KL Rahul, was ruled out of the entire series due to a right groin injury. Hardik Pandya, who led the Gujarat Titans (GT) to their maiden IPL title triumph a few days ago, has been named as the team’s vice-captain, replacing Pant from the position. The development has meant that Pant will go on to become the second-youngest Indian captain to lead the side in the T20I format. Rishabh Pant was made aware of his sudden appointment to the post, with not even a day left for the start of the series, and along expected lines, the wicket-keeper batter had been taken by surprise post being communicated about the same from the BCCI. “I haven’t been able to digest it yet. I got to know just an hour ago,” remarked Pant while wearing big smile during the pre-match press conference. “It is a very good feeling; it did not come under very good circumstances but at the same time I am feeling happy. I would like to thank the BCCI for giving me this opportunity to lead the Indian side. I will try to make the most out of it. Thank you to all my well-wishers for supporting me in my journey through the thick and thin of my cricketing career. I will look to make it a base and keep improving and keep making my life better and better each and every day,” he further added. The 24-year-old will lead team India for the first time ever and that too in front of his home crowd in Delhi. Additionally, left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav has also been ruled out of the entire series after sustaining an injury while batting in the nets. The BCCI have not named any replacement players as yet to substitute the duo from the squad. Time for Spiderman to lead the band of Superheroes in Blue. 😉 Congratulations to @RishabhPant17 for being named captain.

In her long and illustrious career, she has witnessed quite a few transitions and has seen Indian cricket emerge as one of the strongest contenders. READ: Mithali Raj - the torchbearer of women's cricket in India “I am fortunate and grateful to God and all those who helped me to be part of this journey,” she told Sportstar hours after announcing her retirement from all forms of the game. Making it clear that it was not an impulsive decision, Mithali said: “The decision to quit was never an impulsive or an emotional one but had been on the cards ever since I had come back from the last World Cup (50 overs) in New Zealand.” Mithali, who led India in the World Cup in New Zealand earlier this year, insisted that she had made up her mind that it would be her last international assignment. “I have always been insisting that the World Cup would be my last international assignment. Yes, it was a huge disappointment personally and from the team’s perspective. I hoped we would make it to the semis at least,” Mithali said. READ: Mithali is the best women’s cricketer India has ever produced, says Shantha Rangaswamy “I did have a discussion with my father and other well-wishers before I decided to call it a day. Well, it took time for me to come out of the disappointment of the World Cup. That was the reason why I played only one domestic match after that,” Mithali explained. “In a way, I was mentally preparing for this day after the World Cup…” She made it clear that the growing criticism about her strike rate did not bother her. “These things come when you are successful and for so long at the highest level,” she said, “The high-points of my career were the 2005 and the 2017 World Cups (50 overs) and not winning the World Cup would be the biggest regret too,” she said. Under her leadership, the Indian team reached the final of the Women’s World Cup in 2017. “I believe the 2017 edition broke many shackles as far Indian women’s cricket is concerned in terms of popularity, standard of the game. For the team showed to the world what we are capable of,” she added. “Well, when I look back, I feel fortunate and privileged to see the evolution of women’s cricket in India from my early days to the current era when the players are more recognised and have a fan base with huge support from the BCCI too,” Mithali said. Talking about a memorable moment in her career, she said: “I can’t pinpoint any one moment as the most memorable or any other as the most disappointing. For, I always found the ability to keep going, especially fight back from tough times, being mentally more tough and gaining in confidence. I have never let any distraction get the better of me.” After announcing her retirement on Wednesday, Mithali put out a statement on social media indicating that she is looking forward to her ‘second innings’. “I will definitely look at the options available for me when I look ahead. Given a choice by the BCCI, I prefer to come into the administration. I know what the players need at different stages to take the sport to the next level,” Mithali said.","pubDate":"2022-06-08 15:10:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Youngest captain of Indian Cricket team: Youngest captains to lead team India across all formats","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-youngest-captain-of-indian-cricket-team-youngest-captains-to-lead-team-india-across-all-formats/","keywords":["Cricket","rishabh pant","South Africa tour of India 2022","Team India"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Youngest captain of Indian Cricket team: 24-year-old Rishabh Pant is set to lead team India after KL Rahul was ruled out due to injury.

India won this coveted cup for the first time in the history of Thomas Cup since the tournament started in 1948-49. Apart from hockey and cricket, this is only third sports discipline where India became the World Champions in a team event. Chief National coach Pullela Gopichand, players Kidambi Srikanth, Dhruv Kapila, HS Prannoy, Priyanshu Rajawat, Vishnuvardhan Goud, GK Prasad, MR Arjun, Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy were felicitated at a special function organised here at Lok Seva Bhawan convention centre. Naveen honoured Gopichand with a shawl and memento. All the players received Rs. 10 lakh cash awards each, a shawl and a memento. The players also presented the Chief Minister a Team India jersey autographed by all the players. Speaking on the occasion, the CM said that India has now become a production centre for world champions in badminton. It is the dawn of a new era of Indian domination in badminton. Across the country there is great interest among the kids and parents in badminton. Congratulating the Indian players and coaches on becoming the World Champions, Naveen said that it’s a historic achievement and proud moment for the entire country that ‘our boys have become World Champions’ in a tough sport like badminton. A decade back it was unthinkable that India will dominate a sport like badminton. Thanks to the dedication and commitment of coaches like Gopichand and support of the Badminton Association of India (BAI), Central and state governments, India has been able to consistently perform well at international level in the last 10 years, Naveen stated. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik felicitates coach Pullela Gopichand OP Photo Speaking on state’s effort to promote badminton, the CM said, “In Odisha also, we are investing hugely in badminton. In partnership with Gopichand, a state-of-the-art high performance facility will be launched in next few months,” Naveen said. Also read: India make history, beat Indonesia 3-0 to lift maiden Thomas Cup trophy “We are constructing 89 multi-purpose indoor halls across the state. These will primarily cater to the development of badminton players in Odisha and even from outside the state. Many champions will emerge from Odisha in the coming years,” Naveen asserted. The Chief Minister announced that his government is also likely to host the Odisha Open badminton tournament as an annual event and support more such international championships. While every state is promoting its own sportspersons, Odisha is the only state that is promoting all from across India. Odisha is one of the pioneers in promotion of sports now, Gopichand said in his address. “This celebration is an inspiration for us. So, thank you Odisha for this big support,” said an elated Gopichand. Sports & Youth Services Minister Tusharkanti Behera gave the welcome address and Sports Secretary Vineel Krishna offered the vote of thanks.

Generally, the straight boundaries are smaller on this ground, but the long mid-wicket boundary will be a relief for the bowlers. The behind the square boundaries are easy to clear as well.

Former Indian captain Raj has changed the face of Indian women's cricket and is the only lady captain to lead India in two world cup finals. As the legend bids one final goodbye to the game of cricket, here is a look back at her greatest knocks, the knocks that molded her into a legend. Just after she earned the India blues for herself, 16-year-old Mithali Raj went all guns blazing on her international debut. While opening with yet another debutant Reshma Gandhi, the former India skipper took the attack to the Irish side and ended up smashing a ton first up. The world was in awe of this young Indian batter and istantly knew that the legend of Mithali Raj was a force to reckon with. By this time Mithali had cemented herself in the Indian team and was one of their regular members. This was one match where Mithali showed the strength of her technique. Coming out to bat against the English side, Mithali Raj smashed a double hundred while stitching a partnership with her skipper Anjum Chopra. Mithali's solid knock in reply to England's 329 helped her side to take a crucial lead. Cricket World Cup is the biggest stage for any player and everybody wants to deliver for their country especially on a stage like this. Mithali, who was incharge of the women in blue did nothing different. It was a must win contest and just like a champion, she went on to score 64 off 85 deliveries on a difficult wicket. The knock which included 10 boundaries helped India to come back on track and continue their winning momentum in the tournament. This game was a virtual quarter final and India was called out to bat first. With Mandhana and Punam Raut being dismissed cheaply, Raj stitched a crucial 132-run partnership with that helped the Indian team to put a respectable score of 265 runs on the board. Mithali scored her 6th ODI ton in this match and India won the contest by 186 runs which earned them a semifinal spot against Australia. Difficult batting conditions and Mithali Raj are a match made in heaven. England came out to bat first and were dismissed for 229 runs. Starting the chase on a very tricky note, India lost its openers and then came out Raj. She maintained great composure and her knock of 94 helped the visitors to chase down the target quite comfortably.","pubDate":"2022-06-08 12:50:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
