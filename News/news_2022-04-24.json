All-rounders S Al Hasan is arguably the greatest all-rounder that Bangladesh has ever produced. He has been well-rested and has played just one match this season.

Sharma, who has scored a century and four half-centuries as an opening batter in 21 T20s for Punjab in domestic cricket, had opened for SRH twice last season. However, it is only in the ongoing 15th season of the IPL that Sharma has started to justify his potential in the biggest T20 tournament around the world. Into his fifth IPL season, Sharma has scored 220 runs in seven innings at an average and strike rate of 31.42 and 125.71 respectively to be the highest run-scorer for Sunrisers this season till now.

Abhishek Sharma IPL auction salary It was in IPL 2018 that Delhi Capitals (then Daredevils) had first bought Sharma for INR 55 lakh. Sharma, who had struck a 19-ball 46* after coming in to bat in the 16th over on debut, was traded alongside Vijay Shankar and Shahbaz Nadeem to Hyderabad in return for opening batter Shikhar Dhawan. While SRH didn’t retain him ahead of 2022 mega auction held in Bengaluru earlier this year, they did manage to buy Sharma’s services again for an opulent INR 6.5 crore. Having said that, the same wasn’t possible without combating with Punjab Kings and Gujarat Titans at the auction table. While Kings had made the first bid of INR 20 lakh, Titans had joined at a much later stage but couldn’t pin down Sunrisers’ resilient approach regarding buying back a player they had groomed for three seasons. Abhishek Sharma girlfriend As far as Sharma’s relationship status is concerned, the 21-year old player from Amritsar seems to be single at this point in time.

Kohli was once again dismissed outside the off-stump off the very first delivery he faced as RCB were shot out for a meagre 68 in just 16.1 overs. This was the sixth lowest total in the history of IPL. The Sunrisers pace attack led by Marco Jansen (3/25 in 4 overs) and ably supported by Umran Malik (1/19 in 4 overs) and T Natarajan (3/10 in 3 overs) left the star-studded RCB line-up rattled with pace, swing and seam. In reply, it took SRH only eight overs as Abhishek Sharma butchered an already deflated RCB attack to score 47 off 28 balls in company of Kane Williamson (16 not out). The win also took SRH to second place with 10 points while RCB, who are still placed third, will like to forget this game as a bad dream. But one would wonder if Kohli can do the same as it’s only getting worse for one of the contemporary greats in world cricket. The problems are very real and unfortunately, one doesn’t see any corrective measures in his approach as same kind of technical mistakes are being repeated again and again. Some years back, it was James Anderson and now it is a Dushmantha Chameera and Marco Jansen, who are exposing the big chink in Kohli’s armour. There couldn’t have been a quicker end to a contest as Jansen removed Faf du Plessis (5), Kohli (0) and Anuj Rawat (0) off second, third and final delivery of the second over to make it 8 for 3. In case of Jansen, it was seam movement off the pitch with a few that were angled across, some that held its line while Natarajan got some movement in the air and Malik was unleashing his thunderbolts at upward of 150 clicks. In between, left-arm spinner Jagadeesha Suchith (2/12) was also unrelenting as RCB never got elbow room to get some momentum going their way. It soon became 20 for 4 when Natarajan got Glenn Maxwell (12) caught brilliantly by skipper Kane Williamson at mid-off. The other player to reach double figure was Suyash Prabhudesai (15). But, it is Kohli’s dismissal that would certainly deflate his legion of fans as his problems outside the off-stump seems to have resurfaced. Jansen did pose problems for Kohli during the South Africa Test series few months back and again bowled the ideal Test match length, full and getting the ball to either shape in or hold its line. In the last match against Lucknow, it was the backward point that was in operation and Kohli’s propensity to jab at deliveries on off-stump channel with hard hands caused his undoing with Aiden Markram snapping it in second slip. There was not much resistance from the other batters and once Dinesh Karthik (7) was caught down leg-side off Suchith trying to sweep, it was all over for RCB. Once it was 47 for 6 after nine overs, the lower order looked mortally scared facing the fast and furious Umran as it seemed as if the ball was hitting the bat rather than the other way round. Natarajan also kept up the pressure, snuffing out the wickets as veteran Bhuvneshwar Kumar wrapped up the innings. Now you can get handpicked stories from Telangana Today on Telegram everyday.

Both Hazlewood and Hasaranga collect a single each to get off the mark later in the over.20:44 (IST)OUT! Another peach of a delivery from Natarajan that sends the off-stump into a cartwheel. The left-arm seamer slanted this across to the right-handed Patel, the ball nipping away after pitching between middle and leg, and getting just about enough movement to beat Patel's outside edge and clip the top of off.

Further trouble for the Royal Challengers with Shahbaz caught-behind off Malik's bowling in the speedster's second over of the evening. The umpires take this upstairs to check if it's a clean catch or not, and ultimately rule it in favour of the bowling side. Third dismissal for Pooran in a space of two overs.

What an over this is turning out to be for the left-arm spinner! Suchith gets rid of the in-form Dinesh Karthik this time, getting him caught-behind. Except the umpire initially ruled it a wide.

Prabhudessai collects three in the third delivery after guiding the ball through the midwicket region. Malik later ends up bowling a second bouncer in the over, the umpire signalling a no-ball and a free hit after the second one.

Prabhudessai, meanwhile, collects his first boundary with an aerial drive over the diving Williamson at cover, following it up with a single. Six from the over. RCB reach 31/4 at the end of the powerplay. Shahbaz Ahmed, meanwhile, is the new batter at the crease.20:01 (IST)After 5 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 26/4 ( Suyash Prabhudessai 1 , Shahbaz Ahmed 0)Natarajan replaces Bhuvi, and he too is off to a top start as the Tamil Nadu left-arm seamer removes Maxwell in the second delivery, with Bangalore losing their fourth wicket with just 20 on board. Could’ve started off with a wicket-maiden had he not conceded five wides in the final delivery.19:57 (IST)OUT! Superb catch by Williamson at mid off as the wickets continue to tumble for the Royal Challengers, this time Glenn Maxwell heading back to the dugout after getting off to a promising start. Maxwell looked to take the aerial route down the ground, but hardly got any timing on it. Natararaj strikes in his first over of the evening! RCB 20/4Maxwell c Williamson b Natarajan 12(11)19:52 (IST)After 4 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 20/3 ( Glenn Maxwell 12 , Suyash Prabhudessai 1)Maxwell fights back against Jansen in the seamer’s second over of the evening, collecting a couple of boundaries.

The South African left-arm seamer strikes thrice in his first over — uprooting the off stump to send his compatriot du Plessis packing and removes Kohli for a second golden duck of the season the very next delivery.

Another golden duck for Virat Kohli, who seems to be going through the worst patch of his career at the moment!

During the 35th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) bowlers were all over the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) batters like a rash, as they skittled them out for a paltry score of 68/10 in 16.1 Overs, which is also their second lowest score in IPL history. Taking advantage of the nice bit of grass cover on the pitch, the Proteas pacer Marco Jansen (4-0-25-3) laid the foundation of the shambolic RCB collapse, as he dismissed the top-3 batters – Faf du Plessis (5 off 7), Virat Kohli (0 off 1), and Anuj Rawat (0 off 2) during the second Over of the innings itself. With all eyes and spotlight on Virat Kohli yet again, courtesy of his extended lean patch of form, it was another bad day at the office for him as he registered his second consecutive Golden Duck of the ongoing season, getting caught at the second slip off Jansen. In fact, it was only the first time ever in his IPL career that the former India skipper got Out successive times after facing a single delivery in each of his innings.

However, a series of six 10-pointers from the Indian trio helped them cut back the gap to just a point.“That’s what a final does to you,” Rajat told Firstpost from Antalya. “Despite all those high-scoring figures to reach the final, the pressure of the big game still found us. And it took us as long as the second set to realise we are taking this too seriously and need to relax a bit. We reminded ourselves this is not a war but just another match and it’s something we are good at.”The team’s senior-most archer Abhishek, on the other hand, didn’t lose his cool and with the years of experience that the 32-year-old has, the three-time World Cup gold medallist knew he just need to do his best.“It was like any other archery match, a roller-coaster ride,” said Abhishek. “Despite not getting a good start, I knew we will have our chances if we individually focus on doing our best. And that third set with all 10s was the key moment that allowed us to be in the grip of the match.”However, Abhishek stressed that while it’s a good beginning to the season, this is only the first step they took into the year and the ultimate goals remain their ‘Olympics’ in Asian Games. To rejig the reader’s memory, compound archery, unlike recurve archery, is a non-Olympic event and was included in Asian Games in 2014.“This win was a morale-booster but we have a long season ahead. The next stop for us is the World Cup Stage 2 next month, where we will come across our main opponents (archery powerhouse Korea) and will be a good test for us as far as Asian Games is concerned, that’s our Olympics,” said the three-time Asian Games medallist.The youngest member of the team, Aman pointed out that the victory was hard-earned but not exactly their best performance by their high standard. As pointed out by teammate Rajat earlier in an interview, the 24-year-old from Delhi said they are the best compound trio in India and the scoreline doesn’t reflect that as they went for the world record.“Happy to win the world record but it leaves a bitter taste in our mouth too as we went for the team world record. The score of 232 was far below our expectations as we wanted to score all the 240 points on the offer and create the record. In an Asian Games year, we want to remain in our top form and after our performances earlier in the week, we felt confident about it,” said the archer from Delhi, who will now head for Khelo India University Games in Bengaluru.The same trio matched the world record of 239 at the same venue and competition in 2019 when they defeated Italy 239-233 in their opening round match.As far as this World Cup is concerned, Abhishek, along with female archer Ridhi, missed out on a mixed team bronze medal as they lost to Croatia by a point at 156-157 on Saturday.On Sunday, recurve mixed team of Tarundeep Rai and Muskan Kirar will compete in the gold medal match against Great Britain. However, none of the archers could qualify for the medal rounds of the individual events of both disciplines.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

The right-arm spinner achieved the feat in his 83rd IPL game. Former Sri Lanka pacer Lasith Malinga holds the record for the fastest bowler to 100 IPL wickets. Malinga took 70 games to get to the milestone.Rashid scalped the wicket of Kolkata Knight Riders' Venkatesh Iyer who was caught in the deep by Abhinav Manohar for 17 off 17 during the IPL fixture in Mumbai on Saturday.He later scalped another wicket after the right-arm bowler cleaned up Shivam Mavi for 2.With this, Rashid became the joint-fastest spinner to scalp 100 wickets in the tournament, taking 83 matches to do so, the same as Amit Mishra.Talking about the game, the Gujarat Titans scored 156/9 in 20 overs. The side lost an early wicket but Hardik Pandya held the fort at one end and notched up a fifty. But his departure saw a flurry of wickets as Andre Russell picked up four wickets in the final over.Later, KKR too had a dismal start to the chase as they were reduced to 34/4 before Venkatesh Iyer and Rinku Singh chipped in with a partnership of 45 runs. But Singh's dismissal was followed by fall of wickets at regular intervals and it was only Russell who showed resistance and took on the Gujarat bowlers before he was eventually out in the final over.The Gujarat Titans won the match by eight runs while Rashid returned with figures of 2/22 in 4 overs.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPL Live Score, IPL 2022 schedule, IPL 2022 Points table and Entertainment News.

It took the little man from Mumbai a further 368 days before he kept his tryst with the unprecedented milestone of 100 international tons. Not until 16 March 16 2012 did the hundred count tick over to three digits, when he made 114 against Bangladesh in a 50-over contest in Mirpur.Between those two three-figure knocks, Tendulkar batted 33 times in international cricket – he had just two half-centuries in 12 One-Day Internationals and touched fifty six times in 21 Test innings, twice being dismissed in the 90s. Every time he strode out to take guard between No. 99 and No. 100, there was a buzz of anticipation, a frenzied wait, a collective push willing him towards where no man had gone previously.By November of 2019, the populist if somewhat befuddling view was that it was a matter of when, rather than whether, Virat Kohli would overhaul Tendulkar’s magical 100 hundreds. The hype stemmed from the fact that Kohli had breezed to 70 centuries across formats at the highest level. It seemed lost on several that, despite his heroics, he was just a little more than two-thirds of the way to Tendulkar. The convenient narrative was to build edifices of heroic optimism around the then India captain though, to be fair, Kohli steered steadfastly clear of being drawn into this cesspool.Two and a half years later, Kohli is stuck on 70. In the period between November 2019, when he produced a magical 136 in India’s first home day-night Test, against Bangladesh in Kolkata, and now, three-figures have been singularly elusive. Kohli has gone out to bat for India 75 times since that 136; he has topped fifty on 24 occasions, but seldom zeroed in on a hundred. Indeed, in the last year, he has touched 80 just once in 34 hits. Talk of 100 has gone out the window, there is no more than a tenuous reference, at best, to No. 71.What’s wrong with Kohli?It’s a question that has reverberated around the Indian cricketing firmament for a while now. Where is the dominant, all-conquering batsman who towered over all-comers for nearly five full years between 2015 and 2019? Where is the imperious stroke-maker, the consummate finisher, the destroyer of high-quality attacks? Where is Virat Kohli, as we knew him in all his pomp and glory?If there was one answer to these questions, Kohli would have figured it out by himself long back. Life, however, doesn’t come in black and white. It’s the grey areas that lend colour – pardon the terrible pun – and add mystery, mystique, drama and intrigue. It’s precisely this vast expanse of grey that Kohli must successfully traverse as he seeks to haul his illustrious career back on track.What the last year has done is open our eyes to the wondrousness of Kohli’s behemoth-like presence at the highest level for those five years. To bat like he did for so long against so many with such great success was particularly special, though it might not have seemed so at the time because Kohli made it appear ridiculously simple and commonplace.There has been a touch of the human and the fragile to Kohli in the last year that speaks to the vicissitudes of form, the vagaries of fortune, the fickleness of fame. That it has coincided with a particularly tumultuous phase in his cricketing life has added an intriguing subtext. Undisputed captain across formats and inarguably the best batsman in the team, if not the world, a little over six months back, Kohli is now no longer the general but an honest foot-soldier. And as much as opponents covet his scalp, he perhaps doesn’t inspire the same awe and fear in them as he did not so long back.Which is understandable. Cricket’s a game of failures, like most sport is. One’s more likely to fail than succeed; the trick, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni so succinctly has put it so many times, is to extend the gap between the failures. Kohli seemed to mock the failure theory, stacking up runs for fun innings after innings, night after day, day after night, until he no longer did. In a coming of the full circle, he must now be wondering, like his vast legion of loyal fans, where his next big knock is going to come from.Come it will, for sure. Kohli hasn’t gone from a batting prince to a commoner irrevocably or irreversibly. He has too much quality not to be able to arrest the slide – for that’s what this is, let’s make no mistake – and rediscover run-scoring ways, though only time will tell if he will ever be the dominant, omnipotent force he once used to be.So, what does the road back entail?That’s no secret – bloody-minded commitment to the cause, long, untiring stints at the nets, smartness, industry, ambition, hunger and desire. Wait, aren’t these quintessential Kohli traits in any case? Aren’t these what have characterised his cricket all these years? The answer lies in the questions themselves. If they have worked for him in the past, there is no reason why they shouldn’t work again, notwithstanding the fact that he is 33, that is a few months shy of completing 14 years in international cricket.Two former international captains, among them Ravi Shastri, his close confidant and until November the head coach of the national team, have advocated a clean break from the sport so that Kohli regathers focus, recharges batteries and rediscovers the brilliant batsman lurking within himself. It’s unlikely Kohli wouldn’t have reflected on the same because for all the extraneous scrutiny, the fiercely proud Kohli is his most unforgiving critic. If he needs to subjugate his batting ego — for want of a better phrase — to return to prolific run-making, then so be it, as he showed in the first innings of the Cape Town Test at the start of the year.Kohli’s trust in the processes has been immense, as has been his unflagging faith in his abilities. Never before have that trust and faith been challenged so severely. How will he respond to this, the biggest challenge of his cricketing life yet?Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

During the 36th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Brabourne Stadium, former Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli became part of a top-order collapse after Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Kane Williamson invited them to bat first. Playing only his fifth IPL match, Sunrisers Hyderabad fast bowler Marco Jansen not only drew first blood but wreaked havoc by picking as many as three wickets in his first over itself. With his first ball of the match coming in to Royal Challengers captain Faf du Plessis (5), the batter anticipating for a similar result on the following delivery led to his dismissal. Jansen, who successfully managed to swing the ball the other way, found du Plessis wanting to put on display a stunning bowled dismissal. Coming in to bat at No. 3, Kohli edged a fourth stump-line delivery to Aiden Markram at second slip to register a second consecutive golden duck. In what is Kohli’s eighth IPL duck, it is his fifth golden duck in the IPL and 11th duck in T20s.

The 36th league match of Indian Premier League 2022 is being played between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. Sunrisers Hyderabad won the toss and opted to bowl first. All the eyes were on Virat Kohli in the game, who has been terrible this season. Virat Kohli, who last scored a century in 2019 across any format of the game has not even played close to his potential this season. Virat Kohli got out on a Golden Duck in the last game against Lucknow Super Giants. In the game against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Virat was forced to be on the field after just eight balls, when Marco Jansen took the wicket of his fellow countryman Faf du Plessis. Virat Kohli got a warm reception, but he disappointed his fans and went out on a golden duck yet again. Marco Jansen bowled a fullish delivery outside off, which Virat Kohli tried to drive hard. The ball took the outside edge and Markram completed an easy catch at 2nd slip. This is Virat Kohli’s 5th Golden Duck in the history of IPL. Former Royal Challengers Bangalore’s skipper is having a forgettable IPL 2022 so far. He has just scored 119 runs this season at a terrible average of 17.00. 48 has been the highest score of Virat Kohli this season.

The likes of Wriddhiman Saha (27) and David Miller (25) got off to starts but failed to convert them.

Rinku ensured he did not lose momentum there as his back leg almost touched the cushion after sealing the catch. Two in two balls for Russell.19.3: Hat-trick ball for Russell, but doesn’t get so. Russell to Alzarri Joseph, it’s a full-length ball and on the pads, Alzarri has flicked this behind square for a single.19.4: Russell with a slower ball outside off Tewatia manages to reach this and pulls through midwicket fence for a four.19.5: A short-length, slow ball, Tewatia manages a cut in this one, but Rinku Singh rushes from sweeper cover and claims the catch. No hat-trick, but third wicket for Dre Russ.19.6: A perfect yorker from Russell, and Yash Dayal, facing the final ball of the innings, looks to play this straight down the ground but hits this one straight to Russell, who completes the catch.

Three out of the last five Indian Premier League 2022 innings of former Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli have been single-digit scores. Kohli, who hasn’t scored a century in last 100 innings across formats, has been far away from what is expected out of a batter of his potential. In addition to Kohli not contributing adequately with the bat in hand, him finding strange ways to get out is nothing short of disheartening for his superabundant fans. In seven innings of the ongoing 15th season of the biggest T20 tournament across the globe, Kohli has scored 119 runs at an average of 19.83 and a strike rate of 123.95. Good vibes in the camp @RCBTweets pic.twitter.com/rTTPHdoDzx — Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) April 22, 2022 Kohli, who is set to face Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Brabourne Stadium tonight, will be playing a T20 at this iconic venue after as many as 12 years. Having played all of a lone T20 at the Cricket Club of India, it’s an ideal situation for a batter seeking a fresh start.

Much like Kohli, another Indian superstar in Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma is also struggling for runs this season. In seven IPL 2022 innings, Sharma’s 114 runs have come at a disappointing average and strike rate of 16.28 and 126.66 respectively. Another similarity between the two greats is that Sharma had also registered a duck in his last match against Chennai Super Kings on Thursday. Sharma, who now has 14 IPL ducks as compared to Kohli’s seven, has the maximum ducks in the history of the IPL under his belt.

In the first innings against Glamorgan, he castled Marnus Labuschagne to claim his first county wicket in style and then followed it up with another one on the very next ball. Though the bowler failed to clinch a hat-trick, he definitely made a statement in the first innings. He was not done though as he claimed another prized wicket in the second innings. The left-arm Pakistan fast bowler, who had claimed Labuschagne's wicket thrice in the three-match Test series against Australia at home last month, made sure he got the better of the batter in the second innings too. On Saturday, Shaheen bowled a quick delivery that struck Labuschagne's pads to trap him LBW. Although, Marnus was quite convinced that there was some bat involved, the umpire raised the finger. Labuschagne walked away clearly disappointed. The video of the dismissal was shared on Twitter by Middlesex's official handle. | SHAHEEN TRAPS MARNUS LBW @iShaheenAfridi has dismissed Marnus Labuschagne for the second time in this match!

While Lucknow Super Giants captain Rahul and Rajasthan Royals opening batter Jos Buttler are the only two Brabourne centurions, the likes of Iyer, Livingstone and Warner have scored a couple of half-centuries each at this venue this season. In the bowling department, Kuldeep Yadav (9), Khaleel Ahmed (7), Avesh Khan (5), Rahul Chahar (5) and Yuzvendra Chahal (5). Rajasthan Royals spinner Chahal is the only bowler to pick an IPL 2022 five-wicket haul (including a hat-trick) at the Brabourne Stadium. Among fielders, Rishabh Pant (5), Rovman Powell (4), Dwayne Bravo (3) and Mayank Agarwal (3) have grabbed maximum catches at this venue this season. Readers must note that Pant’s five dismissals include a couple of catches and stumpings each apart from a run-out.
