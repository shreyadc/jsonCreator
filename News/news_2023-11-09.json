This ruling came in response to critical remarks made by Waqar about Bangladesh cricket and their team captain, Shakib Al Hasan, during their recent World Cup match against Sri Lanka. In that match, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews was controversially given a \"timed out\" dismissal, marking the first instance of this type of dismissal in the 146-year history of international cricket. During the match, Shakib decided to appeal for a \"timed-out\" dismissal of Mathews. While the ICC regulations do include a provision for \"timed out\" dismissals, it had not been implemented in international cricket before this incident. Mathews requested a new helmet, and the process took more than two minutes to complete. Shakib, noticing the delay, informed the umpire, leading to Mathews being declared \"timed out.\" Both Waqar and former Sri Lankan cricketer Russel Arnold criticized Shakib's actions in the commentary box, characterizing the appeal as \"unsportsmanlike behavior.\" Younis specifically directed his criticism towards Shakib, questioning his actions and expressing disapproval of Bangladesh's approach, citing that it went against the spirit of cricket. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enjoy what I saw out there. That wasn‚Äôt good for the spirit of cricket. I am old school and I think that was a lot of drama to get Angelo Mathews out,‚Äù Waqar said during TV broadcast. The ruling against Waqar instructed the Bangladesh Cricket Board to explain why they should not lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to have Waqar removed from the list of international commentators in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023. Furthermore, the court has given the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and its president a period of 10 days to provide a response to this ruling. The ruling was issued by a bench comprising Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam and Justice Md Atabullah after the initial hearing of a writ petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Advocate Waliur Rahman Khan.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_8d29a8000a.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bf6fde846aeb589436b7592fa9a6c41d","title":"Sri Lanka Cricket to be governed by 18-member Board of Directors","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sri-Lanka-Cricket-to-be-governed-by-18-member-Board-of-Directors/108-270875","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In a bid to address and resolve the ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s popular sport of cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket is to be governed by a Board of Directors comprising 18 members.","content":"COLOMBO (PMD) - In a bid to address and resolve the ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka's popular sport of cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket is to be governed by a Board of Directors comprising 18 members. The proposed changes were outlined in a report drafted by a committee headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, which was formally handed over to the Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, by President's Secretary Saman Ekanayake on Tuesday. The new constitution was commissioned by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who believes that a mere interim committee will not be sufficient to tackle the complex issues plaguing Sri Lankan Cricket. To ensure a long-term solution and advancement of the sport, a permanent and substantive approach is needed. The \"Chitrasiri Committee Report,\" presented to President Wickremesinghe last month, was originally intended to be submitted to Parliament after the conclusion of the 2023 Cricket World Cup and the presentation of the 2024 budget. However, given the current circumstances, President Wickremesinghe has decided to expedite the process and submit the proposed draft constitution to the Cabinet sub-committee, with the intention of bringing it to the attention of Parliament. The new draft constitution proposes a comprehensive overhaul of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board's membership, composition, administration and management. Under the proposed changes, a Board of Directors consisting of 18 members will govern the Sri Lanka Cricket Board. Each director will serve a four-year term and will have the authority to make policy decisions. The execution of these decisions will be the responsibility of a Director-General appointed by the Board of Directors. Out of the 18 directors, 8 will be appointed, and the recommendation for their appointment will be made by an expert committee consisting of six members. This committee will include representatives from the National Sports Council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, the Institute of Directors of Sri Lanka, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Sri Lanka (CIMA Sri Lanka). The remaining 10 board members will be selected through an official election process. This process will see five directors representing cricket clubs, one representing the Players' Association, one representing the School Cricket Association, one representing the Women's Cricket Association, one representing the Umpires' Association, and one representing the Coaches' Association. Furthermore, the proposed constitution suggests the establishment of 12 committees dedicated to various aspects of cricket. These committees include the Cricket Committee, Audit Committee, Related Party Transactions Committee, Nominations Committee, Selection Committee, Tournament Committee, Facilities Development Committee, Rules, Arbitration, and Disciplinary Committee, Investment Committee, Anti-Doping and Anti-Corruption Committee, and Remuneration Committee. The proposed new Constitution will be tabled and discussed by the ruling party during the parliamentary debate, which will be held tomorrow. If approved, these changes are expected to bring a fresh start to Sri Lankan cricket, ensuring transparent governance, effective decision-making, and improved administration of the sport.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_061d9f60e9.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2b386f05631fe7bcd840eea4343819d9","title":"Ton-up Stokes stars as England stop rot against the Netherlands","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Ton-up-Stokes-stars-as-England-stop-rot-against-the-Netherlands/315-270854","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Stokes√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ maiden World Cup hundred set-up a 160-run win for England over the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table.","content":"Last updated: (09.37 p.m.) PUNE (AFP) - Ben Stokes' maiden World Cup hundred set-up a 160-run win for England over the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table. Victory ended a five-game losing streak, with England having long since ceased to be in semi-final contention. But just their second win of the 10-team tournament maintained England's hopes of a top-eight finish that would qualify them for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. England were in trouble at 192-6 after yet another batting collapse before Stokes' 108 and 51 from fellow all-rounder Chris Woakes took them to 339-9 in 50 overs. The Netherlands were never in the hunt, collapsing to 179 all out inside 38 overs, Woakes and David Willey striking with the new ball before spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid took three wickets each. \"I'm more pleased for us to get a victory over the line, it's been a tough World Cup,\" said Stokes. England talisman Stokes, battling a longstanding knee injury, made a painstaking fifty in 58 balls and then accelerated, taking just 20 more deliveries to reach his fifth one-day international century. He was well-supported by Woakes as England added 124 runs in the last 10 overs to finish on 339-9. Test skipper Stokes, 32, eventually holed out in the last over for 108. A target of 340 always looked like it might be beyond non-Test side the Netherlands, who had twice defeated England at the T20 World Cup but lost all six of the teams' previous ODI meetings. England came into this match rock bottom of the table but opener Dawid Malan led the way with a 36-ball fifty that featured 40 runs in boundaries after skipper Jos Buttler won the toss. England, however, lost two wickets in quick succession. Joe Root fell for 28 in bizarre fashion when bowled between his legs by Logan van Beek attempting a reverse scoop. And 133-2 became 139-3 when Malan was run out in sight of his second hundred of the tournament when sent back by Stokes going for a needless single. Harry Brook gave his wicket away before Buttler and Moeen both fell tamely in single figures. Stokes, dropped in the deep on 41 off a tough chance, survived a tight lbw review before smashing a no-ball from spinner Aryan Dutt - and the ensuing free-hit - for sixes. He went into the 90s with another six, a straight drive off Bas de Leede. A reverse swept four off paceman Paul van Meekeren, his sixth of the innings, saw Stokes to a 78-ball hundred that included five sixes on a ground where he had played for Pune in the Indian Premier League. Woakes and Stokes shared a seventh-wicket stand of 129. Van Beek - who bowled 10 wides - suffering in a return of 2-88. The Netherlands slumped to 13-2 in reply, Max O'Dowd chipping Woakes to mid-on before Colin Ackermann was caught behind for a duck off Willey Several batsmen made it into the 30s, while Teja Nidamanuru was left stranded on 41 not out when last man van Meekeren was stumped off Moeen.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_759f917024.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b24c35d7385058b4d2cc27f8a4f17b27","title":"SL-New Zealand WC game faces rain threat","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SL-New-Zealand-WC-game-faces-rain-threat/108-270876","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bad weather threatens to spoil Sri Lanka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s last group game of the ICC Men√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Cricket World Cup match against New Zealand at Bengaluru in India tomorrow.","content":"By Champika Fernando BENGALURU (Daily Mirror) - Bad weather threatens to spoil Sri Lanka‚Äôs last group game of the ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup match against New Zealand at Bengaluru in India tomorrow. The two teams will meet up for their last group game in the ICC Men‚Äôs World Cup at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ‚Äî but with scattered thunderstorms forecasted, the match could be rained off. The city has experienced wet conditions during the last few days and AccuWeather predicts some showers and a thunderstorm later in the day. It‚Äôs a crucial fixture for both teams. After their previous game against Pakistan was impacted by the inclement weather, the Black Caps' semi-final hopes are hanging by a thread. With only eight points and locked with Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Kiwis must beat Sri Lanka to occupy the last remaining spot in the semis. India, South Africa and Australia have entered the semi-finals. Pakistan cruised to a 21-run win on the DLS method over New Zealand, chasing a mammoth 402 to win. Pakistan had reached 200 for one wicket after 25.3 overs when rain arrived ‚Äî a defeat that hurt the Black Caps' chances. New Zealand, however, has a better run-rate than Pakistan and Afghanistan but anything less than a win puts them in a spot of bother. They can still reach the semis based on net run-rate only if Pakistan and Afghanistan who also have eight points, lose against England and South Africa. But if Pakistan defeats England and even if Afghanistan beats South Africa and the Kiwis lose to Sri Lanka, Pakistan will secure the last remaining semi-final spot. If the match gets washed out, the Kiwis will be in deep trouble as the points would be divided between the teams, taking theirs to nine. And if Pakistan wins against England, they will be in the semi-final with 10 points. If Pakistan lose and rain washes out the game between Sri Lanka and New Zealand, the Kiwis can still hope for a semi-final berth provided Afghanistan lose their last group game against South Africa on Friday. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of things that we can't control and the weather is one of those,‚Äù said Kane Williamson, the Black Caps Skipper, ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs fixture. ‚ÄúYou mentioned that there might be some of it, there may be a thought in the back of your mind. But at the end of the day, our focus will be on the cricket that we want to play and trying to put all our focus and energy into that. That gives us the best chance of putting out a good performance. And so that'll be what we try to do‚Äù. For Sri Lanka, their World Cup campaign is over, after six defeats so far in eight games. There had been some chance until Monday but a three-wicket defeat at the hands of Bangladesh under the most controversial circumstance where Angelo Mathews became the first international cricketer ever to be timed out - put them out of contention for a semi-final spot. They will look to finish the tournament on a high and at least qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Only the first eight teams along with hosts Pakistan will enter. Sri Lanka‚Äôs best chance is to beat New Zealand and then hope England and Netherlands will falter in their last remaining games. A wash-out will make it tougher for them. Against New Zealand, Sri Lanka are likely to make at least one change with bowling all-rounder Chamika Karunaratne expected to replace Kasun Rajitha. Both teams have squared off 101 times in ODIs with the Black Caps winning 51 matches while Sri Lanka have won 41. Eight encounters have concluded with no result while one match ended in a tie. New Zealand have done extremely well in the tournament, even though some results did not go their way. Rachin Ravindra playing his debut World Cup has been exceptional with the bat and has amassed 523 runs at an average of 74.71 in eight matches, including three centuries and two half centuries. For Sri Lanka, the left-arm seamer Dilshan Madushanka has been in terrific form and currently leads the bowling chart with 21 wickets in eight matches. Sadeera Samarawickrema and Pathum Nissanka have also shown some consistency but weren‚Äôt able to change Sri Lanka‚Äôs fortunes. New Zealand Squad: Kane Williamson (Captain), Trent Boult, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Jimmy Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee and Will Young. Sri Lanka Squad: Kusal Mendis (Captain), Kusal Perera, Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha/Chamika Karunaratne, Dilshan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f0af85bf53.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"9b3f8c02b32b4542861e5c227e1b6bab","title":"Jos Buttler wants to remain as England one-day captain despite poor World Cup","link":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/sport/national/23911279.jos-buttler-wants-remain-england-one-day-captain-despite-poor-world-cup/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England ended a five-match losing run against Netherlands.","content":"Key has flown out to India for the second time, having been part of the touring party earlier in the tournament, and will begin the process of picking the bones out of a miserable title defence with Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott in the coming days.

Key has flown out to India for the second time, having been part of the touring party earlier in the tournament, and will begin the process of picking the bones out of a miserable title defence with Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott in the coming days. A 160-run win over Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday gives them something positive to talk about after five successive defeats and put England back on track for Champions Trophy qualification in 2025 ahead of their final game against Pakistan. There have been questions over the leadership of the side in India, which Key may wish to examine more closely, but Buttler has made it clear he wants to lead what will be a much-changed squad when it tours the West Indies next month. Asked if he would be travelling as skipper, Buttler said: ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôd like to. I know Rob Key arrives into India today.

This ruling came in response to critical remarks made by Waqar about Bangladesh cricket and their team captain, Shakib Al Hasan, during their recent World Cup match against Sri Lanka. In that match, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews was controversially given a \"timed out\" dismissal, marking the first instance of this type of dismissal in the 146-year history of international cricket. During the match, Shakib decided to appeal for a \"timed-out\" dismissal of Mathews. While the ICC regulations do include a provision for \"timed out\" dismissals, it had not been implemented in international cricket before this incident. Mathews requested a new helmet, and the process took more than two minutes to complete. Shakib, noticing the delay, informed the umpire, leading to Mathews being declared \"timed out.\" Both Waqar and former Sri Lankan cricketer Russel Arnold criticized Shakib's actions in the commentary box, characterizing the appeal as \"unsportsmanlike behavior.\" Younis specifically directed his criticism towards Shakib, questioning his actions and expressing disapproval of Bangladesh's approach, citing that it went against the spirit of cricket. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enjoy what I saw out there. That wasn‚Äôt good for the spirit of cricket. I am old school and I think that was a lot of drama to get Angelo Mathews out,‚Äù Waqar said during TV broadcast. The ruling against Waqar instructed the Bangladesh Cricket Board to explain why they should not lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to have Waqar removed from the list of international commentators in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023. Furthermore, the court has given the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and its president a period of 10 days to provide a response to this ruling. The ruling was issued by a bench comprising Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam and Justice Md Atabullah after the initial hearing of a writ petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Advocate Waliur Rahman Khan.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_8d29a8000a.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bf6fde846aeb589436b7592fa9a6c41d","title":"Sri Lanka Cricket to be governed by 18-member Board of Directors","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sri-Lanka-Cricket-to-be-governed-by-18-member-Board-of-Directors/108-270875","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In a bid to address and resolve the ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s popular sport of cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket is to be governed by a Board of Directors comprising 18 members.","content":"COLOMBO (PMD) - In a bid to address and resolve the ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka's popular sport of cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket is to be governed by a Board of Directors comprising 18 members. The proposed changes were outlined in a report drafted by a committee headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, which was formally handed over to the Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, by President's Secretary Saman Ekanayake on Tuesday. The new constitution was commissioned by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who believes that a mere interim committee will not be sufficient to tackle the complex issues plaguing Sri Lankan Cricket. To ensure a long-term solution and advancement of the sport, a permanent and substantive approach is needed. The \"Chitrasiri Committee Report,\" presented to President Wickremesinghe last month, was originally intended to be submitted to Parliament after the conclusion of the 2023 Cricket World Cup and the presentation of the 2024 budget. However, given the current circumstances, President Wickremesinghe has decided to expedite the process and submit the proposed draft constitution to the Cabinet sub-committee, with the intention of bringing it to the attention of Parliament. The new draft constitution proposes a comprehensive overhaul of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board's membership, composition, administration and management. Under the proposed changes, a Board of Directors consisting of 18 members will govern the Sri Lanka Cricket Board. Each director will serve a four-year term and will have the authority to make policy decisions. The execution of these decisions will be the responsibility of a Director-General appointed by the Board of Directors. Out of the 18 directors, 8 will be appointed, and the recommendation for their appointment will be made by an expert committee consisting of six members. This committee will include representatives from the National Sports Council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, the Institute of Directors of Sri Lanka, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Sri Lanka (CIMA Sri Lanka). The remaining 10 board members will be selected through an official election process. This process will see five directors representing cricket clubs, one representing the Players' Association, one representing the School Cricket Association, one representing the Women's Cricket Association, one representing the Umpires' Association, and one representing the Coaches' Association. Furthermore, the proposed constitution suggests the establishment of 12 committees dedicated to various aspects of cricket. These committees include the Cricket Committee, Audit Committee, Related Party Transactions Committee, Nominations Committee, Selection Committee, Tournament Committee, Facilities Development Committee, Rules, Arbitration, and Disciplinary Committee, Investment Committee, Anti-Doping and Anti-Corruption Committee, and Remuneration Committee. The proposed new Constitution will be tabled and discussed by the ruling party during the parliamentary debate, which will be held tomorrow. If approved, these changes are expected to bring a fresh start to Sri Lankan cricket, ensuring transparent governance, effective decision-making, and improved administration of the sport.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_061d9f60e9.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2b386f05631fe7bcd840eea4343819d9","title":"Ton-up Stokes stars as England stop rot against the Netherlands","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Ton-up-Stokes-stars-as-England-stop-rot-against-the-Netherlands/315-270854","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Stokes√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ maiden World Cup hundred set-up a 160-run win for England over the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table.","content":"Last updated: (09.37 p.m.) PUNE (AFP) - Ben Stokes' maiden World Cup hundred set-up a 160-run win for England over the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table. Victory ended a five-game losing streak, with England having long since ceased to be in semi-final contention. But just their second win of the 10-team tournament maintained England's hopes of a top-eight finish that would qualify them for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. England were in trouble at 192-6 after yet another batting collapse before Stokes' 108 and 51 from fellow all-rounder Chris Woakes took them to 339-9 in 50 overs. The Netherlands were never in the hunt, collapsing to 179 all out inside 38 overs, Woakes and David Willey striking with the new ball before spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid took three wickets each. \"I'm more pleased for us to get a victory over the line, it's been a tough World Cup,\" said Stokes. England talisman Stokes, battling a longstanding knee injury, made a painstaking fifty in 58 balls and then accelerated, taking just 20 more deliveries to reach his fifth one-day international century. He was well-supported by Woakes as England added 124 runs in the last 10 overs to finish on 339-9. Test skipper Stokes, 32, eventually holed out in the last over for 108. A target of 340 always looked like it might be beyond non-Test side the Netherlands, who had twice defeated England at the T20 World Cup but lost all six of the teams' previous ODI meetings. England came into this match rock bottom of the table but opener Dawid Malan led the way with a 36-ball fifty that featured 40 runs in boundaries after skipper Jos Buttler won the toss. England, however, lost two wickets in quick succession. Joe Root fell for 28 in bizarre fashion when bowled between his legs by Logan van Beek attempting a reverse scoop. And 133-2 became 139-3 when Malan was run out in sight of his second hundred of the tournament when sent back by Stokes going for a needless single. Harry Brook gave his wicket away before Buttler and Moeen both fell tamely in single figures. Stokes, dropped in the deep on 41 off a tough chance, survived a tight lbw review before smashing a no-ball from spinner Aryan Dutt - and the ensuing free-hit - for sixes. He went into the 90s with another six, a straight drive off Bas de Leede. A reverse swept four off paceman Paul van Meekeren, his sixth of the innings, saw Stokes to a 78-ball hundred that included five sixes on a ground where he had played for Pune in the Indian Premier League. Woakes and Stokes shared a seventh-wicket stand of 129. Van Beek - who bowled 10 wides - suffering in a return of 2-88. The Netherlands slumped to 13-2 in reply, Max O'Dowd chipping Woakes to mid-on before Colin Ackermann was caught behind for a duck off Willey Several batsmen made it into the 30s, while Teja Nidamanuru was left stranded on 41 not out when last man van Meekeren was stumped off Moeen.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_759f917024.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b24c35d7385058b4d2cc27f8a4f17b27","title":"SL-New Zealand WC game faces rain threat","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SL-New-Zealand-WC-game-faces-rain-threat/108-270876","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bad weather threatens to spoil Sri Lanka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s last group game of the ICC Men√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Cricket World Cup match against New Zealand at Bengaluru in India tomorrow.","content":"By Champika Fernando BENGALURU (Daily Mirror) - Bad weather threatens to spoil Sri Lanka‚Äôs last group game of the ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup match against New Zealand at Bengaluru in India tomorrow. The two teams will meet up for their last group game in the ICC Men‚Äôs World Cup at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ‚Äî but with scattered thunderstorms forecasted, the match could be rained off. The city has experienced wet conditions during the last few days and AccuWeather predicts some showers and a thunderstorm later in the day. It‚Äôs a crucial fixture for both teams. After their previous game against Pakistan was impacted by the inclement weather, the Black Caps' semi-final hopes are hanging by a thread. With only eight points and locked with Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Kiwis must beat Sri Lanka to occupy the last remaining spot in the semis. India, South Africa and Australia have entered the semi-finals. Pakistan cruised to a 21-run win on the DLS method over New Zealand, chasing a mammoth 402 to win. Pakistan had reached 200 for one wicket after 25.3 overs when rain arrived ‚Äî a defeat that hurt the Black Caps' chances. New Zealand, however, has a better run-rate than Pakistan and Afghanistan but anything less than a win puts them in a spot of bother. They can still reach the semis based on net run-rate only if Pakistan and Afghanistan who also have eight points, lose against England and South Africa. But if Pakistan defeats England and even if Afghanistan beats South Africa and the Kiwis lose to Sri Lanka, Pakistan will secure the last remaining semi-final spot. If the match gets washed out, the Kiwis will be in deep trouble as the points would be divided between the teams, taking theirs to nine. And if Pakistan wins against England, they will be in the semi-final with 10 points. If Pakistan lose and rain washes out the game between Sri Lanka and New Zealand, the Kiwis can still hope for a semi-final berth provided Afghanistan lose their last group game against South Africa on Friday. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of things that we can't control and the weather is one of those,‚Äù said Kane Williamson, the Black Caps Skipper, ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs fixture. ‚ÄúYou mentioned that there might be some of it, there may be a thought in the back of your mind. But at the end of the day, our focus will be on the cricket that we want to play and trying to put all our focus and energy into that. That gives us the best chance of putting out a good performance. And so that'll be what we try to do‚Äù. For Sri Lanka, their World Cup campaign is over, after six defeats so far in eight games. There had been some chance until Monday but a three-wicket defeat at the hands of Bangladesh under the most controversial circumstance where Angelo Mathews became the first international cricketer ever to be timed out - put them out of contention for a semi-final spot. They will look to finish the tournament on a high and at least qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Only the first eight teams along with hosts Pakistan will enter. Sri Lanka‚Äôs best chance is to beat New Zealand and then hope England and Netherlands will falter in their last remaining games. A wash-out will make it tougher for them. Against New Zealand, Sri Lanka are likely to make at least one change with bowling all-rounder Chamika Karunaratne expected to replace Kasun Rajitha. Both teams have squared off 101 times in ODIs with the Black Caps winning 51 matches while Sri Lanka have won 41. Eight encounters have concluded with no result while one match ended in a tie. New Zealand have done extremely well in the tournament, even though some results did not go their way. Rachin Ravindra playing his debut World Cup has been exceptional with the bat and has amassed 523 runs at an average of 74.71 in eight matches, including three centuries and two half centuries. For Sri Lanka, the left-arm seamer Dilshan Madushanka has been in terrific form and currently leads the bowling chart with 21 wickets in eight matches. Sadeera Samarawickrema and Pathum Nissanka have also shown some consistency but weren‚Äôt able to change Sri Lanka‚Äôs fortunes. New Zealand Squad: Kane Williamson (Captain), Trent Boult, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Jimmy Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee and Will Young. Sri Lanka Squad: Kusal Mendis (Captain), Kusal Perera, Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha/Chamika Karunaratne, Dilshan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f0af85bf53.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"9b3f8c02b32b4542861e5c227e1b6bab","title":"Jos Buttler wants to remain as England one-day captain despite poor World Cup","link":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/sport/national/23911279.jos-buttler-wants-remain-england-one-day-captain-despite-poor-world-cup/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England ended a five-match losing run against Netherlands.","content":"Key has flown out to India for the second time, having been part of the touring party earlier in the tournament, and will begin the process of picking the bones out of a miserable title defence with Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott in the coming days.

There have been questions over the leadership of the side in India, which Key may wish to examine more closely, but Buttler has made it clear he wants to lead what will be a much-changed squad when it tours the West Indies next month.

This ruling came in response to critical remarks made by Waqar about Bangladesh cricket and their team captain, Shakib Al Hasan, during their recent World Cup match against Sri Lanka. In that match, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews was controversially given a \"timed out\" dismissal, marking the first instance of this type of dismissal in the 146-year history of international cricket. During the match, Shakib decided to appeal for a \"timed-out\" dismissal of Mathews. While the ICC regulations do include a provision for \"timed out\" dismissals, it had not been implemented in international cricket before this incident. Mathews requested a new helmet, and the process took more than two minutes to complete. Shakib, noticing the delay, informed the umpire, leading to Mathews being declared \"timed out.\" Both Waqar and former Sri Lankan cricketer Russel Arnold criticized Shakib's actions in the commentary box, characterizing the appeal as \"unsportsmanlike behavior.\" Younis specifically directed his criticism towards Shakib, questioning his actions and expressing disapproval of Bangladesh's approach, citing that it went against the spirit of cricket. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enjoy what I saw out there. That wasn‚Äôt good for the spirit of cricket. I am old school and I think that was a lot of drama to get Angelo Mathews out,‚Äù Waqar said during TV broadcast. The ruling against Waqar instructed the Bangladesh Cricket Board to explain why they should not lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to have Waqar removed from the list of international commentators in the ongoing ICC World Cup 2023. Furthermore, the court has given the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and its president a period of 10 days to provide a response to this ruling. The ruling was issued by a bench comprising Justice Mustafa Zaman Islam and Justice Md Atabullah after the initial hearing of a writ petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Advocate Waliur Rahman Khan.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_8d29a8000a.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"bf6fde846aeb589436b7592fa9a6c41d","title":"Sri Lanka Cricket to be governed by 18-member Board of Directors","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Sri-Lanka-Cricket-to-be-governed-by-18-member-Board-of-Directors/108-270875","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In a bid to address and resolve the ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s popular sport of cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket is to be governed by a Board of Directors comprising 18 members.","content":"COLOMBO (PMD) - In a bid to address and resolve the ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka's popular sport of cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket is to be governed by a Board of Directors comprising 18 members. The proposed changes were outlined in a report drafted by a committee headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, which was formally handed over to the Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, by President's Secretary Saman Ekanayake on Tuesday. The new constitution was commissioned by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who believes that a mere interim committee will not be sufficient to tackle the complex issues plaguing Sri Lankan Cricket. To ensure a long-term solution and advancement of the sport, a permanent and substantive approach is needed. The \"Chitrasiri Committee Report,\" presented to President Wickremesinghe last month, was originally intended to be submitted to Parliament after the conclusion of the 2023 Cricket World Cup and the presentation of the 2024 budget. However, given the current circumstances, President Wickremesinghe has decided to expedite the process and submit the proposed draft constitution to the Cabinet sub-committee, with the intention of bringing it to the attention of Parliament. The new draft constitution proposes a comprehensive overhaul of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board's membership, composition, administration and management. Under the proposed changes, a Board of Directors consisting of 18 members will govern the Sri Lanka Cricket Board. Each director will serve a four-year term and will have the authority to make policy decisions. The execution of these decisions will be the responsibility of a Director-General appointed by the Board of Directors. Out of the 18 directors, 8 will be appointed, and the recommendation for their appointment will be made by an expert committee consisting of six members. This committee will include representatives from the National Sports Council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, the Institute of Directors of Sri Lanka, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Sri Lanka (CIMA Sri Lanka). The remaining 10 board members will be selected through an official election process. This process will see five directors representing cricket clubs, one representing the Players' Association, one representing the School Cricket Association, one representing the Women's Cricket Association, one representing the Umpires' Association, and one representing the Coaches' Association. Furthermore, the proposed constitution suggests the establishment of 12 committees dedicated to various aspects of cricket. These committees include the Cricket Committee, Audit Committee, Related Party Transactions Committee, Nominations Committee, Selection Committee, Tournament Committee, Facilities Development Committee, Rules, Arbitration, and Disciplinary Committee, Investment Committee, Anti-Doping and Anti-Corruption Committee, and Remuneration Committee. The proposed new Constitution will be tabled and discussed by the ruling party during the parliamentary debate, which will be held tomorrow. If approved, these changes are expected to bring a fresh start to Sri Lankan cricket, ensuring transparent governance, effective decision-making, and improved administration of the sport.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_061d9f60e9.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"2b386f05631fe7bcd840eea4343819d9","title":"Ton-up Stokes stars as England stop rot against the Netherlands","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Ton-up-Stokes-stars-as-England-stop-rot-against-the-Netherlands/315-270854","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ben Stokes√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ maiden World Cup hundred set-up a 160-run win for England over the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table.","content":"Last updated: (09.37 p.m.) PUNE (AFP) - Ben Stokes' maiden World Cup hundred set-up a 160-run win for England over the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday as the struggling champions climbed off the bottom of the table. Victory ended a five-game losing streak, with England having long since ceased to be in semi-final contention. But just their second win of the 10-team tournament maintained England's hopes of a top-eight finish that would qualify them for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. England were in trouble at 192-6 after yet another batting collapse before Stokes' 108 and 51 from fellow all-rounder Chris Woakes took them to 339-9 in 50 overs. The Netherlands were never in the hunt, collapsing to 179 all out inside 38 overs, Woakes and David Willey striking with the new ball before spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid took three wickets each. \"I'm more pleased for us to get a victory over the line, it's been a tough World Cup,\" said Stokes. England talisman Stokes, battling a longstanding knee injury, made a painstaking fifty in 58 balls and then accelerated, taking just 20 more deliveries to reach his fifth one-day international century. He was well-supported by Woakes as England added 124 runs in the last 10 overs to finish on 339-9. Test skipper Stokes, 32, eventually holed out in the last over for 108. A target of 340 always looked like it might be beyond non-Test side the Netherlands, who had twice defeated England at the T20 World Cup but lost all six of the teams' previous ODI meetings. England came into this match rock bottom of the table but opener Dawid Malan led the way with a 36-ball fifty that featured 40 runs in boundaries after skipper Jos Buttler won the toss. England, however, lost two wickets in quick succession. Joe Root fell for 28 in bizarre fashion when bowled between his legs by Logan van Beek attempting a reverse scoop. And 133-2 became 139-3 when Malan was run out in sight of his second hundred of the tournament when sent back by Stokes going for a needless single. Harry Brook gave his wicket away before Buttler and Moeen both fell tamely in single figures. Stokes, dropped in the deep on 41 off a tough chance, survived a tight lbw review before smashing a no-ball from spinner Aryan Dutt - and the ensuing free-hit - for sixes. He went into the 90s with another six, a straight drive off Bas de Leede. A reverse swept four off paceman Paul van Meekeren, his sixth of the innings, saw Stokes to a 78-ball hundred that included five sixes on a ground where he had played for Pune in the Indian Premier League. Woakes and Stokes shared a seventh-wicket stand of 129. Van Beek - who bowled 10 wides - suffering in a return of 2-88. The Netherlands slumped to 13-2 in reply, Max O'Dowd chipping Woakes to mid-on before Colin Ackermann was caught behind for a duck off Willey Several batsmen made it into the 30s, while Teja Nidamanuru was left stranded on 41 not out when last man van Meekeren was stumped off Moeen.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_759f917024.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b24c35d7385058b4d2cc27f8a4f17b27","title":"SL-New Zealand WC game faces rain threat","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/SL-New-Zealand-WC-game-faces-rain-threat/108-270876","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Bad weather threatens to spoil Sri Lanka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s last group game of the ICC Men√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Cricket World Cup match against New Zealand at Bengaluru in India tomorrow.","content":"By Champika Fernando BENGALURU (Daily Mirror) - Bad weather threatens to spoil Sri Lanka‚Äôs last group game of the ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup match against New Zealand at Bengaluru in India tomorrow. The two teams will meet up for their last group game in the ICC Men‚Äôs World Cup at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ‚Äî but with scattered thunderstorms forecasted, the match could be rained off. The city has experienced wet conditions during the last few days and AccuWeather predicts some showers and a thunderstorm later in the day. It‚Äôs a crucial fixture for both teams. After their previous game against Pakistan was impacted by the inclement weather, the Black Caps' semi-final hopes are hanging by a thread. With only eight points and locked with Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Kiwis must beat Sri Lanka to occupy the last remaining spot in the semis. India, South Africa and Australia have entered the semi-finals. Pakistan cruised to a 21-run win on the DLS method over New Zealand, chasing a mammoth 402 to win. Pakistan had reached 200 for one wicket after 25.3 overs when rain arrived ‚Äî a defeat that hurt the Black Caps' chances. New Zealand, however, has a better run-rate than Pakistan and Afghanistan but anything less than a win puts them in a spot of bother. They can still reach the semis based on net run-rate only if Pakistan and Afghanistan who also have eight points, lose against England and South Africa. But if Pakistan defeats England and even if Afghanistan beats South Africa and the Kiwis lose to Sri Lanka, Pakistan will secure the last remaining semi-final spot. If the match gets washed out, the Kiwis will be in deep trouble as the points would be divided between the teams, taking theirs to nine. And if Pakistan wins against England, they will be in the semi-final with 10 points. If Pakistan lose and rain washes out the game between Sri Lanka and New Zealand, the Kiwis can still hope for a semi-final berth provided Afghanistan lose their last group game against South Africa on Friday. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of things that we can't control and the weather is one of those,‚Äù said Kane Williamson, the Black Caps Skipper, ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs fixture. ‚ÄúYou mentioned that there might be some of it, there may be a thought in the back of your mind. But at the end of the day, our focus will be on the cricket that we want to play and trying to put all our focus and energy into that. That gives us the best chance of putting out a good performance. And so that'll be what we try to do‚Äù. For Sri Lanka, their World Cup campaign is over, after six defeats so far in eight games. There had been some chance until Monday but a three-wicket defeat at the hands of Bangladesh under the most controversial circumstance where Angelo Mathews became the first international cricketer ever to be timed out - put them out of contention for a semi-final spot. They will look to finish the tournament on a high and at least qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Only the first eight teams along with hosts Pakistan will enter. Sri Lanka‚Äôs best chance is to beat New Zealand and then hope England and Netherlands will falter in their last remaining games. A wash-out will make it tougher for them. Against New Zealand, Sri Lanka are likely to make at least one change with bowling all-rounder Chamika Karunaratne expected to replace Kasun Rajitha. Both teams have squared off 101 times in ODIs with the Black Caps winning 51 matches while Sri Lanka have won 41. Eight encounters have concluded with no result while one match ended in a tie. New Zealand have done extremely well in the tournament, even though some results did not go their way. Rachin Ravindra playing his debut World Cup has been exceptional with the bat and has amassed 523 runs at an average of 74.71 in eight matches, including three centuries and two half centuries. For Sri Lanka, the left-arm seamer Dilshan Madushanka has been in terrific form and currently leads the bowling chart with 21 wickets in eight matches. Sadeera Samarawickrema and Pathum Nissanka have also shown some consistency but weren‚Äôt able to change Sri Lanka‚Äôs fortunes. New Zealand Squad: Kane Williamson (Captain), Trent Boult, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Jimmy Neesham, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee and Will Young. Sri Lanka Squad: Kusal Mendis (Captain), Kusal Perera, Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha/Chamika Karunaratne, Dilshan Madushanka and Dushmantha Chameera.","pubDate":"2023-11-08 19:32:57","image_url":"https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_f0af85bf53.jpg","source_id":"dailymirror","source_priority":43341,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"9b3f8c02b32b4542861e5c227e1b6bab","title":"Jos Buttler wants to remain as England one-day captain despite poor World Cup","link":"https://www.bordercountiesadvertizer.co.uk/sport/national/23911279.jos-buttler-wants-remain-england-one-day-captain-despite-poor-world-cup/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England ended a five-match losing run against Netherlands.","content":"Key has flown out to India for the second time, having been part of the touring party earlier in the tournament, and will begin the process of picking the bones out of a miserable title defence with Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott in the coming days.
