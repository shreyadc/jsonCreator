The Spurs striker and Barty then beat the gridiron duo of two-time Super Bowl winner Ben Roethlisberger and one-time SB king Marshall Faulk in the greensomes. Kane, though, was back on the ropes in his second fourballs when he and boxing superstar Canelo Alvarez succumbed to Faulk and ex-New York Giants hero Michael Strahan as the US led 10-5 overnight. And to make things worse for Kane the word on the greens was that Strahan 'needed to speak' to him - to 'discuss' his preference for the New England Patriots and Tom Brady.

England captain Ben Stokes opted to use the same template that served his side so well in the 3-0 whitewash of world champions New Zealand last month, and the hosts were in the ascendancy when three Jimmy Anderson wickets helped reduce the Indians to 98 for five in overcast conditions. But Pant counter-attached with a hundred from 89 deliveries, the fastest ever in Tests in Birmingham, and eventually fell to Joe Root’s occasional off-spin, having made 146 from 111. Paul Collingwood praised Rishabh Pant’s ‘world class’ performance to rescue India on day one His 222-run stand with Ravindra Jadeja (83 not out) swelled India’s run rate to an England-esque 4.63 as India closed a rain-shortened opening day of the re-scheduled fifth Test of last summer on 338 for seven. But England assistant coach Collingwood countered: ‘I don’t feel that our backs were against the wall for too long. That’s a really good wicket out there and the batsmen should be excited about batting on it. It will be a great result if we keep them down to 360-370. ‘Hats off to the way Pant played. When you play against world-class players, they can do world-class things.’ ‘The way that we played the three games against New Zealand, though, we are not over-awed by what the opposition are going to get in their first innings, and we are not scared of what we need to chase in the fourth innings. But the England assistant coach says the hosts will be ready to attack with the bat as well Collingwood believes that England will not be ‘over-awed’ by the run target that India set ‘We have been pretty successful in those games, we are not playing conventional Test match cricket, we are trying to be as attacking as possible, always looking to take wickets with the field placings we’ve got, not always trying to stem the flow of runs or keep the run rate down.’ While England are determined to stick to Brendon McCullum’s mantra of making Test cricket an entertainment game, they must also win this contest to share a series suspended last September when the Indians pulled out of the original fixture in Manchester citing Covid fears. But Twenty20 poster boy Pant put a spoke in the wheel with his afternoon blitz and later said it was up to others to judge if his fifth Test hundred was his best to date. ‘Yes, I might play some different shots sometimes but I try to play the percentages,’ the 24-year-old said, after crashing four sixes, including three off last week’s Headingley hero Jack Leach.

Although not for the first time in international cricket, veteran England pacer James Anderson has emerged as the highest wicket-taker for his team in a day of Test cricket today. Anderson, who resumed with the usual custom of opening the bowling for England, successfully managed to pick a couple of early wickets dismissing India opening batters Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara in identical manner. A workhorse even at 40, Anderson had bowled 15 out of 35 overs in a bid to continue chipping in with wickets especially after him also sending Shreyas Iyer back to the pavilion. ALSO WATCH: Rishabh Pant audaciously plays reverse sweep off James Anderson at Edgbaston Readers must note that Anderson finished the day with bowling figures of 19-4-52-3 at an economy rate of 2.73 on a day when Indian batters scored at a run rate of 4.63. Third-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket, Anderson is the highest among fast bowlers. The right-arm bowler is the only fast bowler in the world to pick 600 Test wickets. It is noteworthy that 416 (at an average and strike rate of 24 and 51.1 respectively) out of Anderson’s 654 Test wickets have come in England. Furthermore, Anderson is at the second spot when it comes to picking most Test wickets at home. Only legendary Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (493) has more Test wickets at home than Anderson.

The Telegraph and the Times say the person allegedly commented this summer he was unable to see ex-bowler Malcolm 'until he smiles'. English cricket has already been rocked by the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal, leading to the ECB bringing charges against Yorkshire and seven individuals in June for bringing the game into disrepute . The un-named official caught up in the latest allegations is said to have worked for the English Cricket Board for several years. After emigrating from Jamaica to Sheffield in 1979, Malcolm became a popular figure in the sport. He picked up 128 wickets in 40 Tests, famously taking 9-57 with his extreme pace against South Africa at The Oval in 1994, as well as starring for Derbyshire, Northamptonshire and Leicestershire. FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS Now 59, he joined another former England quickie, Dean Headley, as one of five newcomers on the ECB’s match referees panel in a bid to increase diversity. But it came after he was previously twice turned down in his attempt to become a first-class umpire, even though others were readily accepted. And two years ago, former umpires John Holder and Ismail Dawood claimed there was discrimination in the ECB’s appointments system. They noted that no non-white official had made the first-class list since 1992. Ex-Hampshire bowler Holder, English cricket's most senior black official, was axed from officiating in Tests in 1991. That was soon after he reported reporting alleged ball tampering by an England player. Yorkshireman Dawood, who played for Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, Glamorgan and Yorkshire, was never promoted from the reserve list. Soon after Malcolm joined the new ‘supplementary panel’ of match referees., Holder and Dawood dropped their employment claim against the ECB.","pubDate":"2022-07-01 20:00:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australians get ‘truly extraordinary’ support from Sri Lankan fans","link":"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/australians-get-truly-extraordinary-support-from-sri-lankan-fans-20220701-p5ayan.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Peter FitzSimons"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s men’s cricket team isn’t used to applause from rival fans and it was heartwarming to see they truly appreciated it in Sri Lanka.","content":"There was a lovely moment in cricket last week that has not received sufficient attention. During the fifth ODI between Australia and Sri Lanka last Friday, the Sri Lankan crowd wore yellow t-shirts and jerseys to thank the Australian team for touring the country even while Sri Lanka itself is in the midst of a shocking economic and humanitarian crisis so bad it threatens the stability of the country. In the midst of all that, the Australians still turned up and the locals appreciated it, many holding up signs saying simply THANK YOU. At the end of the match, the Australian cricket captain led his team around the ground to thank the crowd for their graciousness. “It was pretty extraordinary,” Glenn Maxwell told India Today . “I was just telling the boys “that was one of the most special feelings, being able to walk around the ground and have a foreign country all cheer for you. A lot of times when Australia tours, we are generally the enemy and there is not many Australian fans in the stands but to have the support and fans that are here at the moment is truly extraordinary.” In the meantime, the business of sport mostly bores me. Yes, it is important it is covered, but few head to the sports pages professionally or personally for updates on what the pinstripes brigade has been up to lately. And yet when it comes to the current legal stoush between Channel Seven and Cricket Australia over the former’s desire to walk away from its broadcasting deal on the alleged grounds of “multiple quality and standards breaches”, it is hard to look away. The move completely undercuts the whole schtick of “tune in to us, because we have the cricket!” When the broadcaster itself wants to walk, you’d have to figure either the viewers are not far behind, or have already left? In fact, it appears to be the latter, with a reported loss of “an average of 450,000 TV viewers per game compared to an average of 1.1 million viewers-per-game when the BBL was broadcast by Ten in 2016.” Not that you care, but I am one of them. The BBL? Please. I had a brief look early, but have long ago lost interest. And clearly, so has much of Australia. It is bubblegum cricket, momentarily sweet at the time, but instantly forgettable. How cricket will emerge from this we know not, but my vote goes to paring it back. Seven West Media wants to terminate its broadcast rights deal with Cricket Australia. Credit: Brett Hemmings Don’t make it the video wallpaper of summer. Make each game an event . Help us to care again. Because right now there is so damn much of it, and it is all over so quickly you simply can’t follow it. And one more thing. You kids, get off my lawn! My friend, the SMH’s State Political Editor, Alexandra Smith, wrote a piece on Thursday about the John Barilaro saga, focusing on how very odd it was that our former Deputy Premier should have secured an annual $500K for a position he created. (He has since, mercifully, withdrawn.) The headline was “ Barilaro saga is an own goal for Perrottet government ” to which I lightly mused on twitter, “‘Own goal’? Or “hit wicket”? I am sure there is a better sporting metaphor, I am just not sure what it is . . .” The answers came flooding in: “Since it is a Nat involved, is it not shooting oneself in the foot?” “Can’t bowl, can’t bat”? “Salary cap scandal for team caught in systemic drug cheating program.” Former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro has stepped down from the US appointment. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer “Own goal? It’s a straight up professional foul. This is red card stuff for the voters.” “Could it be ‘Bowled a Maiden Over’. Goodbye [public servant who appointed him], Amy Brown!” “A shank out of bounds followed by a duck hook, 4 putts and a pick up . . .” “Perrottet’s underarm bowling moment”? “More akin to Bodyline. Barilaro is Douglas Jardine & Perrottet is Larwood. We’re all The Don. ‘It’s just not cricket’ feels appropriate.” “Impaled himself on his stumps.” “‘Richie, you really couldn’t make a bigger balls up of this thing if you tried, could you?’ ‘Thats fair, Bill. It’s a total cock up. Barilaro has run his captain out for nought, and Perrotet isn’t happy. There will be some strong words in the clubhouse when this innings is over’.” And the winner? @Tedd111 came good with the perfect, pithy rejoinder: “Fine Cotton”. I wouldn’t say there is method in his madness, but there is certainly a pattern forming. As discussed in this very spot when Nick Kyrgios had a meltdown over an umpire’s decision at the Miami Open in April, the Canberran said: “When everyone in that crowd is booing an umpire, and he’s becoming the centre of attention, that’s not his job. Because no one in that entire stadium bought a ticket to see him talk or play or do what he does.” Nick Kyrgios Credit: John Shakespeare On Tuesday, Kyrgios had a similar meltdown over the call of a lineswoman in the course of his first-round victory at Wimbledon, saying to umpire Marija Cicak :“Has one person today come here to see her speak? Not one person. I know you’ve got fans but she’s got none.” Last time, I noted the similarity of the sentiment to the famous one expressed in 1880 by the iconic English batsman, W.G. Grace, to an umpire who was uppity enough to give him out LBW: “They came to see me bat, not you umpire.” This time, it is less amusing. Without engaging in pscyho-babble, the good glimpses we get of Kyrgios’s character show that deep inside there is a good, humble bloke trying to get out from under all the ranting. And that quote – essentially saying the lineswoman is a nobody whose opinion simply doesn’t count – is not worthy of the bloke inside we keep glimpsing and liking. And nor is spitting at Wimbledon toward fans. As ever, Nick, we all get you are a work in progress and there really is a good man in there trying to get out. Yonks back a bloke called Phil Gould sang the national anthem before a Bledisloe Test. No, not that Phil Gould, the other one – the professional singer. I remember it because he gave it such a beat, such a tempo and resonance that he was able to make even that dreadful dirge Advance Australia Fair sound good. I was reminded of it when watching last Sunday night’s State of Origin and saw the Welcome to Country. Wow. Just wow. The words! The warmth! The sense of an Australian original engaging in an original concept. It was perfect, a credit to rugby league and to Australia. Who is that guy? It was by Noongar/Yamatji musician Richard Walley and it turns out he more or less invented the contemporary concept of Welcome to Country nearly 50 years ago with Ernie Dingo. Yes, of course it has been done in these parts for tens of thousands of years, but Dingo and Walley were part of the Middar Aboriginal theatre, at Perth fringe festival and as noted by a piece in The Guardian , it was Dingo and Walley who were given the blessing by community elders to take the inter-Indigenous concept and welcome the non-Indigenous. And it has grown from there, most particularly since 2008 “when the official opening of Australia’s federal parliament began, for the first time, with a traditional welcome to the country, becoming a standard feature thereafter. The following day the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, gave an historic formal apology to Australia’s Indigenous people.” Bravo. Serena Williams congratulates a shocked Harmony Tan. Credit: Getty Serena Williams on her first-round loss to Harmony Tan at Wimbledon: “Today I gave all I could do, you know, today. Maybe tomorrow I could have gave more. Maybe a week ago I could have gave more. But today was what I could do. At some point, you have to be able to be OK with that.” And so this is how it ends. Not with a bang, nor even a walloping. Just a first-round loss at Wimbledon to an unknown. Harmony Tan on the win: “I don’t know because I don’t believe now. I don’t believe. It’s a dream because, you know, I saw Serena on the TV when I was young … she’s a legend. I mean, she won 23 Grand Slams. When you play her, I was scared. I mean, I was scared when I was on the court but really happy to be there.” Nick Kyrgios upset with fans in his first round match: “Have you ever gone to a supermarket and just started berating someone scanning the groceries? No. So why do they do it when I’m at Wimbledon? Why is that? I just think it’s a whole generation of people on social media feeling like they have a right to comment on every single thing with negativity. It just carries on to real life.” Headline in London’s Daily Mail , above a photo of Nick Kyrgios: “Why is this most cretinous player at Wimbledon?” The article went on to call him “rambling and often incoherent” while criticising his “relentless, poisonous tirades,” and accusing him of “nursing a sense of victimhood”. And then it started to rip into him! Who else but Kyrgios after his blistering 2nd round win at Wimbledon: “Today, enjoy it, watch it back, I hope you all watch my highlights and write about that. I’m one of the most important people in the sport, you want to investigate that? Nothing to investigate there, it’s just factual.” Ahead of Origin II, former Bulldogs coach Trent Barrett on Matt Burton: “I’m really proud of Burto; he’s an exceptional player and an exceptional person, and he deserves this.” Surely we can do better than “Burto”! Australian basketballer Josh Green on waking up and seeing his bronze medal from Tokyo: “Words can’t even describe; the medal is sitting right next to my bed. I wake up every morning, look at it, it’s a good start to the day. It’s also so much more than just a medal, being around the great group of guys, it’s like a family you know what I mean? I make sure that I keep in contact with all of them.” Green on missing Australian food: “I get red frogs sent to my house every month. It’s basically a subscription at this point.” Dallas Mavericks guard Josh Green (left). Credit: AP Paul Vautin on the sin-binning during Origin II: “No one knows what they’re for. No one here knows. No one at home knows. We don’t know. We’re so-called experts. So called.” Phil Gould on it: “The fact that these six-agains were not penalty kicks for goal meant they were just given away like smarties. You don’t need that – it’s Origin football.” Usman Khawaja on things the BBL has to do to improve: “If we’re not careful we’re going to be left behind, and you don’t want to do that because the BBL is a great product.” Referring to it as a “product” has to be part of the problem. Whatever the reality, I, for one, want to feel like a sports fan rather than the consumer of a product, put out by an industry. England rugby coach Eddie Jones on the lack of lip from Wallaby coach Dave Rennie in the lead-up to the first Test: “In 2016 we had [Michael] Cheika here and there was a bit of niggle – it was good, good Australian sport. This time it feels like . . . I don’t know what it feels like. I prefer it like that, but you can’t spar against nothing. I like a bit of fun. When you’re sparring in a corner by yourself it’s not much fun.” Eddie Jones laughing at England training in Perth. Credit: Getty Eddie Jones. Back to Australia with the England men’s rugby side.

Does that seem right to you? TFF. You’re welcome, Brad Fittler. TFF unequivocally tipped Queensland in Origin II, which brought into play my Kiss of Death, and now forces the decider. NSW will have to beat history to claim the series after winning just five of 20 Origin series deciders. Nine deciders have been played at Lang Park and NSW have only won two, the last being 2005.

During the first day of the rescheduled fifth Test match between England and India in Birmingham, India vice-captain Rishabh Pant scored his fifth Test century to emerge as the crowing point of the day’s play. Sticking to his reputation of being a hard-hitting customer, Pant returned to the pavilion after scoring 146 (111) with the help of 19 fours and four sixes at a strike rate of 131.53. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the 23rd over, Pant witnessed India losing two more wickets within the next 33 balls.

Yet to score 1,000 runs in both the white-ball formats in spite of his game being more suited for ODIs and T20Is, the same speaks highly about how well the 24-year old player has adopted to red-ball cricket without even changing his approach. 38th Indian cricketer to score 2,000 Test runs, Pant is the 15th fastest among them to achieve this milestone. Pant, who has achieved the milestone in his 52nd Test innings, follows the likes of Murali Vijay (50) and Navjot Singh Sidhu (50).

After not winning a series in Asia in 10 years, Australia could now pull off two in the space of four months with a win in the second Test at Galle starting on Friday.

Nathan Lyon has also arrived with a willingness to bowl differently to the way he does at home, going away from the shape of the offbreak he enjoys so much in Australia and offering up more variations. \"It's been a big one for us, just embracing everything about it,\" captain Pat Cummins said. \"In the past you can get caught up in conditions that aren't like Australia. \"But if you want to be the number one Test team in the world you have to be winning overseas. \"It's in everyone, the experienced guys finding new shots, (Mitchell) Starc working on reverse swing, Gaz (Lyon) coming up with a few new balls. \"There is so much appetite to learn and to be successful on these wickets which, as a captain, couldn't be more pleasing.\" Cummins said part of the approach had been trying to discard a fear of failure with the batters, given the emphasis was on each individual having a plan to unsettle the bowlers. \"It's part of the environment that we are trying to create,\" Cummins said. \"Failure is absolutely okay, as long as you are failing in a way you are happy to be. \"If you're just trying to survive, it's not the best way forward.\" Australia's other advantage has been continuity in Asian conditions, with a four-Test tour of India next year after this year's series in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \"We have a big series next year in India, so this can really help develop and fast track our batters (for that),\" Cummins said. \"Marnus (Labuschagne), Travis Head, Cam Green, Alex Carey haven't played Test matches in conditions that have spun this much. \"(Mitchell) Swepson hasn't played in wickets like this, so absolutely you learn so much from these tours.\"","pubDate":"2022-07-01 19:03:02","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-7376851/e67ce96f3c1add613444ef89966c5e8f471efea3-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Root 5 wickets: Joe Root best bowling figures","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-joe-root-5-wickets-joe-root-best-bowling-figures/","keywords":["Cricket","India tour of England 2022","Joe Root"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Joe Root 5 wickets: The former England Test captain got rid of the ever dangerous Rishabh Pant during the first Test match at Edgbaston.

During the first day of the rescheduled ‘fifth’ Test match between England and India at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham, a Rishabh Pant cyclone which caused a heavy distraction in the English camp, was finally calmed down by an off-spinning delivery bowled by Joe Root, but not before he had tonked the bowlers black and blue and amassed a total of 146 runs at a strike rate of 131.53. Having been reduced to 98/5 at one stage, Pant and Ravindra Jadeja (83*) not only soaked in all the pressure, but also scored runs at more than 4 an Over throughout their stay at the crease, to help India post 338/7 at stumps on Day 1, which also turns out to be the highest runs for team India on the first day of a Test match in England. Pant, in particular, was at his ultimate beast mode, smashing the pacers and spinners alike with utmost disdain, while playing some of the jaw-dropping shots during his innings which comprised of 20 Fours and 4 Sixes. The innings came to a halt during the 67th Over, when Root tossed up a fullish delivery outside the off-stump to which Pant slashed hard only for the ball to get a thick outside edge of the bat, to end up in the hands of the first slip fielder.

During the third Day/night Test in Ahmedabad which was played on a rank-turner, 28 of the 30 wickets that had fallen, were taken by spinners, as England lost the match by 10 wickets, with Joe Root playing just the lone spinner in Jack Leach. However, Root did ably assist Leach from the other end, as his maiden five-wicket haul helped in getting the Indian team dismissed for 145 in the first innings. The former England Test skipper returned with a mind-boggling bowling figures of 6.2-3-8-5.

Pant batted with just as much brilliance and brutality as the likes of Jonny Bairstow this summer and rescued his team from a dire predicament. India were 98-5 at one stage with Jimmy Anderson swinging his magic but Pant’s response was to tear into England’s bowlers with the aggression and audacity of an inveterate risk-taker. It is exactly the way England responded to sticky situations against New Zealand. That approach was tagged Bazball after the nickname of new coach Brendon McCullum. Well, this was Pantball and the chunky left-handed wicketkeeper certainly sprayed shots to all parts. He reached his century from just 89 balls and some of his strokes were thrilling in their ingenuity. Once, he landed flat on his back after whacking spinner Jack Leach for a one-bounce four. Another time, he reverse ramped Anderson for two, which was bold but not quite as spectacular as Joe Root’s two sixes using the same unorthodox shot against the Kiwis. Another over from Leach cost 22 runs and included a one-handed hit by Pant that sailed into the crowd at long-on. But his innings wasn’t wild slogging, it was a calculated assault. Pant was eventually out for 146 from just 111 balls – caught at slip by Zak Crawley off Root attempting another big blow – when on course for the fastest 150 ever made against England. Pant found a superb ally in another left-hander, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, and the pair put on 222 in just 38.5 overs for the sixth wicket. FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS By the close of day one of the Fifth Test – yes, the Fifth Test because this match is held over from last summer after being postponed because of Covid fears – India were 338-7. England assistant coach Paul Collingwood said: \"Pant’s counter-attack was brilliant to watch. When someone plays out of his skin in an entertaining manner, you’ve got to look at the bigger picture. \"For Test cricket to survive, we’ve got to make it more entertaining. He certainly played some amazing shots. \"We’re not playing conventional Test cricket, we’re always looking to take wickets rather than stem the flow of runs. There’s been a huge change in mentality. \"If we can keep India to under 360 or 370, we’ll have done really well.\" Pant added: \"The pressure was there after we lost those early wickets but I just tried to focus on the ball. I might play some unusual shots but really I try to play the percentages.\" After Stokes chose to bowl first, Crawley was soon in the action, holding two and dropping one catch in the opening session. He clung on when Shubman Gill guided Anderson tamely to second slip but spilled an opportunity low to his right offered by Hanuma Vihari off Potts. In the next over, however, Crawley snaffled a comfortable edge from Pujara. Pujara had earlier been given out for 13, caught behind off Stuart Broad. But a review showed the ball brushed his back thigh rather than the bat. After rain held up play for 90 minutes, Potts had Vihari plumb lbw and then Virat Kohli, attempting to shoulder arms, succeeded only in deflecting the ball onto the stumps. Potts dismissed Kane Williamson three times out of four during the New Zealand series and now he had India’s No.1 gun. When Shreyas Iyer tickled a short ball from Anderson down the legside and Sam Billings took a fine one-handed catch diving to his left, India were 98-5 and in big trouble. Anderson, who missed the final Test against New Zealand, had three wickets and was bowling immaculately and Potts had two, although he later took some heavy punishment from Pant. Pant was even more severe on Leach, whose nine overs cost 71 runs. Pant and Jadeja transformed the match with their huge stand, which rattled along at more than five-and-a-half an over. England started to look a touch ragged in the closing session, with a wild four byes sent down by Stokes, four overthrows by Crawley and sub fielder Ethan Brookes and a bouncer by part-time spinner Root that Pant slapped for four. This game could become the biggest test of Stokes’ leadership and England’s new philosophy so far. Let’s see how they bat. It sure won’t be defensive. After Pant departed, Stokes bounced out Shardul Thakur but Mohammed Shami survived with Jadeja 83 not out.","pubDate":"2022-07-01 18:46:29","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs India: Rishabh Pant hasn't let his white-ball form affect him in Test cricket, says Ajit Agarkar","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/england-vs-india-rishabh-pant-hasn-t-let-his-white-ball-form-affect-him-in-test-cricket-says-ajit-agarkar-1969279-2022-07-02?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"ENG vs IND: Pant hasn't let his white-ball form affect him in Test cricket, says Agarkar","content":"Former pacer Ajit Agarkar said that indifferent form in white-ball cricket hasn't affected Rishabh Pant in Test cricket by any stretch of the imagination. On Day one of India's ongoing rescheduled fifth Test against Ben Stokes's England, Pant scored a sparkling 111-ball 146 with the help of 19 fours and four sixes. On the back of his knock, the visiting team made a recovery from 98 for five in 27.5 overs to 338 for seven at the close of play on the first day. \"He came into the Test match being a little bit under pressure because of his form in white-ball cricket, which has been a tad indifferent. But it hasn't affected his form in Test cricket,\" Agarkar was quoted as saying. After scoring his fifth Test ton off 89 balls, Pant also broke MS Dhoni's record of the fastest century by an Indian batter in the purest format. Moreover, the left-handed Pant also became the only visiting wicketkeeper to score more than one overseas Test century on English soil. \"He was batting well, particularly for India. In the five-match series where he was the captain, he was under a bit of pressure,\" he stated. Agarkar, who has a Test century at the iconic Lord's Cricket Ground, said that Pant's style of play has benefitted India to a large extent. \"It's not the first time that he has done it. It shouldn't come as a surprise. It's just good for India that he has kept repeating it, especially in Test cricket. It not only put the opposition under pressure, but put India so far ahead in the game,\" Agarkar added. India currently have Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami as their overnight batters. Jadeja has played the sheet-anchor's role, having scored 83 runs from 163 balls with 10 fours.

With the clouds of doubt looming over the Indian batsmen, Rishabh Pant came out and started belting the deliveries as he generally does it. Pant wreaked havoc on the dominant English side and at one point in time, it looked like captain Stokes had no answers to Pant's brilliance. It was a dismal day for Stokes the bowler too as he kept on bowling no balls to stretch further and create difficulties for Rishabh Pant. With Brendon McCullum at the helm of English cricket, Ben Stokes and his team have been playing aggressive Test cricket, but a Pant gave them a taste of their own medicine.

While he smashed each bowler with utmost disdain, with him batting in his 60s, he also decided to play the reverse scoop yet again to England’s best Test bowler James Anderson, during the 48th Over of the innings. On the third delivery of the Over, to a delivery which was on length and around the off-stump, Pant decided to bring out his reverse scoop/ramp out of the casket, to take everyone by surprise. However, fortunately, he just gets the timing right for the ball to fly above the slip cordon and collect a couple of runs.

During the first day of the fifth rescheduled Test match between England and India in Birmingham, India vice-captain Rishabh Pant has scored another game-changing century to fuel discussions of this format being the most preferred one for him. Pant, 24, found himself in the middle at No. 5 right after the extended lunch interval . With India also losing former captain Virat Kohli (11) and batter Shreyas Iyer (15) in the subsequent overs, the onus in an overseas Test was yet again on Pant. Having faced 14 deliveries, Pant treated veteran England pacer James Anderson with disdain stepping down the track to hit him down the ground for his first boundary of the day. With all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja finding himself among boundaries as well, he complemented Pant well enough as the left-handed batters rescued India and how. Unaffected by the match situation or overcast conditions, Pant attacked spinner Jack Leach hitting him for a couple of fours and a six in his second over. Pant, who is usually brave and determined in spite of the risk which accompanies his batting, put on display his natural qualities to play shots with freedom at Edgbaston on Day 1. It was on the penultimate delivery of the 43rd over that Pant hit another boundary off Leach to bring up a 51-ball half-century. Returning from the tea break, Pant hit a couple of boundaries off Matthew Potts right after the break to gain the same rhythm. Four more boundaries off Potts further witnessed Pant running towards the three-figure mark. Having hit Leach for two more fours, Pant ran a couple of runs off veteran England pacer Stuart Broad to register an 89-ball century. In what is his fifth Test century , it is Pant’s fourth away from home, third against England, second in England and first at No. 5.

During the first day of the rescheduled ‘fifth’ Test match between England and India at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham, team India have fought back magnificently after losing half their side under 100 runs just after Lunch. Veteran England pacer James Anderson once again delivered for his team at his favourite hunting ground, getting rid of both the Indian openers – Shubman Gill (17) and Cheteshwar Pujara (13) and then Shreyas Iyer (15), to reduce them to 98/5. However, the two Southpaw batters – Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja, not only soaked in all the pressure with consummate ease, but also batted aggressively as per Test match standards to stitch together a century stand for the sixth wicket in mere 130 deliveries to breach the 200-run mark, while scoring at an average of four runs per Over. Pant, in particular continued to bat like a dream in Test match Cricket this year, as he smashed his 10th Test fifty in mere 51 deliveries. In fact, in the last seven Test innings, the wicket-keeper batter has five 50+ scores under his belt, while coming into bat at no.5 in the order. Most Test runs for India in 2022 Pant and Jadeja are also so far, the leading run-scorers for India in Tests his year. With both the players still going strong in the first innings, Rishabh Pant, at the time of writing, led the highest-run getters list amongst Indian batters by quite some margin. Playing his fifth Test match this year, the 24-year-old has amassed a total of 417* runs across 8 innings at an average of 69.50, with the help of three fifties and a century. Just like Viru Sehwag, Rishab Pant seems a natural white ball player. But it is his test record that is actually much more impressive. The ability to counter-attack is so important in test matches. — Joy Bhattacharjya (@joybhattacharj) July 1, 2022 Highest Test run-scorer for India in 2021 The Delhi left-hander was also in top-notch form in 2021; ending the year as India’s second-highest run-getter in Tests, just behind team India’s all format skipper Rohit Sharma. Rohit was the highest run-scorer with a total of 906 runs across 21 innings (11 Test matches) at an average of 47.68, with the help of four fifties and two centuries. Pant, with 748 runs across 21 innings, was placed at the second spot, with Cheteshwas Pujara (702 runs) taking up the third spot.

Coming on the back of a 2-0 series victory against Ireland, India will be up against a Derbyshire squad which comprises of international players such as Pakistan’s Shan Masood and Australia’s Hilton Cartwright. Veteran wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has been named as India’s captain for these practice matches before the T20I series. The development hints at Hardik Pandya (captain in Ireland) not participating in any of these matches. Karthik, who made a T20I comeback after more than three years during the home series against South Africa last month, will become the ninth cricketer to lead an Indian team since 2021. Karthik, who has represented India in 159 matches across formats in what is an 18-year old career now, has never had an opportunity of leading them. Having said that, Karthik has led Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals) and Kolkata Knight Riders in the cash-rich Indian Premier League leading these teams to a combined 21 wins and 21 losses in 43 matches across four seasons.

Now it has gone viral outside the internet. The Test cricket match between India and England is currently being played at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground. The Indian team is batting first. At the end of almost 28 overs, the Indian team is stumbling, losing 5 wickets for just 98 runs. In this case, the main rivals in the world of cricket are the goalie and Anderson. These two are not mutually exclusive. If the goalie stumbles, Anderson and if Anderson stumbles, the goalie will dominate the game. The goalie has faced 681 balls bowled by Anderson in Test cricket before this match. With that he has added 297 runs. Anderson, on the other hand, has scored seven goals. Meanwhile, the ICC shared a picture of Kohli and Anderson talking to each other and laughing during the lunch break of the Edgbaston Test match. It was also asked to give a caption to it. Now it’s just going viral on the internet. Many social media users have been commenting on the ICC fire. At the same time, the goalie took only 11 off 19 balls in the match and snatched his wicket from inside the bowler’s in England’s Edge mode. James Anderson has taken 3 wickets in this match. \r Caption this # WTC23 | #ENGvIND | https://t.co/h6av5ZWkOk pic.twitter.com/j8tWCPsFXj .","pubDate":"2022-07-01 15:06:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Instant karma for you’ – Watch laughing David Warner go down in pain after being hit in balls with flying BAIL","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19061716/david-warner-australia-cricket-hit-in-balls/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Jake Lambourne"],"video_url":null,"description":"AUSTRALIAN cricket star David Warner suffered a freak injury during the Test victory against Sri Lanka after a flying bail crashed into his private parts.

It proved to be a huge error of judgement as while he went for the ball, which he ultimately fumbled, one of the bails flew into his sensitive area. He crumpled in a heap on the floor as his team-mates rushed to Head to celebrate his wicket. The Aussie squad then burst into laughter after realising what happened.
