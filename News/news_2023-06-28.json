They lost it because they made mistakes which they cannot repeat if they hope to hit back at Lord's and keep the Ashes alive . England's first mistake, although not many saw it at the time, was picking Moeen Ali. Focus was put on the mental side of him coming back after such a long time away from Test cricket, but we forgot about the physical demands. On the last day, when Edgbaston was taking turn, England's premier spinner could not hold the ball because his finger had been shredded. So that is an error. Then there were the mistakes made by Jonny Bairstow , usually such a good wicketkeeper. Bairstow had a poor game, especially standing up, and missed chances. If those errors had not been made, England would have won, but all we have seen since that Test are comments on the merits of Bazball and whether it can win the Ashes. England's breathtaking 'Bazball' style of play was not the reason for their defeat at Edgbaston England lost the first Test because they made mistakes which they cannot repeat at Lord's We must also remember that, whatever England say about not being a results-based side, the reason they have introduced this style is to maximise their chances of winning. Yes, they are considering the wider picture, the entertainment Bazball is providing and the good it can do Test cricket when it is in danger of being marginalised by Twenty20 and franchise leagues. But England want to win. I remember talking to Rob Key when he became managing director of England cricket and saying to him, 'Don't worry about the brand and style. Just win games of cricket because England have only won one of their last 17 Tests'. And he said, 'Yes, brilliant Einstein, but the way we are going to win games of cricket is by changing that brand and style'. That is what England have done. Their brand and style have led to them winning 11 of their last 14 matches. Winning is what they will be judged on and if they want to be entertaining then going to the Oval at 2-2 would be a lot more entertaining than being down 4-0. I have wanted England to win the whole of my life. But, as a 55-year-old, I do now see the bigger picture. When I left Edgbaston I looked at the crowd and the record viewing figures on Sky and thought, 'Yes, we want a bit more of that'. Then I heard Ben Stokes say people approached him after the Test to say how much they were riveted by it and I see my son receiving messages from his football mates saying, 'Aren't the Ashes brilliant. When's the next Test?' But I also appreciate the reason England are carrying on like this and still trying to take concerns about the result out of the equation is that they want their players to be free to enjoy themselves. As a consequence, they will play better. And they need to be at their very best now. You have to be careful at Lord's. The pitch may look green and there might be rain around but it can go very flat and you must have an attack that can bowl a side out in the second innings as well as the first. That is probably why they have gone for Josh Tongue. Hosts need a win at Lord's to avoid going 2-0 down in the series and staring defeat in the eye Josh Tongue has been selected for the second Test and will bring some much-needed pace I have said all along I would have gone the other way round had I been England or Australia. I would have played Mark Wood, had he been fit, or Tongue at Edgbaston and Mitchell Starc - if I had been in charge of the Australians - to provide pace on a slow pitch. Then, at Lord's, I would have played all the seamers for England and whoever misses out for Starc on Wednesday, either Scott Boland or Josh Hazlewood. But even though there was a case to play Chris Woakes here, because of his great record at Lord's and his batting ability at No 8, England will have remembered Tongue getting a five-wicket second-innings haul against Ireland on debut here when the pitch was flat. The reason England have been winning far more than they have been losing is that they have kept their positivity. That could change if they lose here because the moment you break that chain, the fear of failure can come creeping in again. England need to win now to keep that carefree mindset in place. Go two down and not only will Bazball be doubted but they will be nailed by everyone and some in the country could turn on them. So there's a lot at stake over the next five days.

JOHN McENROE on the void left by his BBC sidekick, electronic line calls - and why he expects Andy Murray to shine at Wimbledon The three-time Wimbledon champion has worked with Barker for over 20 years McEnroe believes that Djokovic is set to win a historic 24th Grand Slam in SW19 WIMBLEDON Q&A: Is it really Djokovic's to lose? And how far can Murray go? By Mike Dickson for MailOnline Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 23:20 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail 2 View comments John McEnroe knows that summers will never be quite the same again when he takes his customary seat at Wimbledon with the BBC, with Sue Barker no longer there . Aside from anything, the onus will be more on him than ever to provide the spark for the corporation’s coverage, but he will miss her on a personal level after more than 20 years working together . ‘She was incredible at what she did. So it’s going to be a void,’ says the American legend. ‘Doing the other side, the commentary side, as long as I have, I’ve been doing it with her. She just made it easier for everyone around her. God bless her, hopefully she’ll come by and say hello. So it’s a tough act to follow.’ A new era will begin for the corporation’s flagship sports event. Clare Balding is taking the main presenting role , with the early shift being occupied by cricket expert Isa Guha. The Beeb would like to have supplemented its ranks with significant former male players of a more recent vintage. But they come with a hefty price tag and recruitment has been difficult, so McEnroe, 64, retains pride of place, especially as Boris Becker cannot return due to him being banned from the UK after his early release from prison. McEnroe can usually be relied upon for an original opinion, but even he cannot, in all conscience, see past Novak Djokovic being the strong favourite for the event this year. ‘Novak doesn’t seem to have too many problems, he’s not even bothering to play a tournament beforehand,’ says McEnroe. John McEnroe will take part in BBC's Wimbledon coverage without Sue Barker for the first time The tennis legend doesn't believe anyone will get in the way of a historic 24th victory for French Open winner Novak Djokovic He does, however, point out that the unpredictable can happen on grass, and that there are players who can lift themselves to take advantage if the Serb has an off-day, or is troubled by any physical problem. Queen’s champion Carlos Alcaraz is one. ‘This guy is going to figure it out. It’s just a matter of when to me, not if,’ says McEnroe, adding that he would love to coach him on grass. He also believes that it would be foolish to write off Djokovic’s direct contemporary Andy Murray, with his early exit at Queen’s likely to have been the result of fatigue. ‘Certainly his best chance is at Wimbledon . He understands the nuances of grass better than anyone, I put him in the top dozen players that understand what it takes to compete and do well on grass. ‘It’s going to depend on his draw (taking place on Friday). I’ve actually been pleasantly surprised by his improved movement in the last couple of years. ‘I’m sure he’s been inspired by Novak because they are the same age and he’ll see this guy, who looks like he’s 25. ‘I don’t know how Andy is even playing in the first place. I’m pulling for him to do something, he’s a Hall of Famer who has been to 11 Grand Slam finals, so I’m hoping he will be able to go out on his own terms.’ McEnroe’s fame has long since spread beyond tennis, and he has been acquiring a new following through his role as narrator of the Netflix comedy drama Never Have I Ever. As he dryly acknowledges, he would not have had so many post-playing career avenues opened to him had he not had so many blow-ups with officialdom while on the court. Therefore it is with some reluctance that he believes that, with the recent ATP ruling that all line calls on the regular tour will be made electronically by 2025 , line judges’ days are numbered at Wimbledon. But the three-time winner is adamant that Andy Murray stay in the conversation on grass McEnroe claims he would have loved to have coached world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz on the turf ‘That’s where everything’s headed. I don’t think there’s any two ways about it,’ he says. ‘There’s other ways that players can engage. It’s not just the linespeople. With (Ilie) Nastase, when they first had the Cyclops machine, I was like, “Nasty, they got Cyclops, we can’t question a call”. And he was like, “Macaroni. Don’t worry, we can figure something out. There are other things”. ‘If you have equipment that’s accurate, I’m sorry, you’ve got to go with that. Maybe I wouldn’t be talking to you now because of the antics, and maybe I would have won more but I would have been more boring. ‘But this is just the way it’s going. I will say that if you had told me at 18 that they’ve got a system where they get every call correct I would definitely have wanted that.’ John McEnroe will be part of the BBC’s commentary team on Wimbledon 2023 across TV and radio.

He has proved people wrong again and again Jonny Bairstow is just 48 runs short of an impressive landmark in English cricket The Yorkshire keeper-batter's demeanour makes him English cricket's everyman EXCLUSIVE: Sledging war continues as Jim Maxwell queries Bairstow's weight By Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail Published: 22:30, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:52, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments The landmark just up ahead for Jonny Bairstow is testament to his extraordinary powers of perseverance in cricket. A mere 48 runs in the course of the next five days will make him only the 10th English player to complete 1,000 of them at Lord's, though none of the select group has a story of survival quite like his. He has proved people wrong, again and again, and generally engaged in his best work when the doubts are most vivid. There is timelessness about the man, who has been left out and moved about the order so often that the notion of him being here, aged 33, a pillar of the new England, is an achievement against all odds. He is English cricket's everyman, too, because of that demeanour of his - always showing exactly how much it means and how much effort has been expended to deliver. On the eve of the Test, he finds himself at the centre of a different kind of warfare - Jim Maxwell's questioning of his weight, as well as his eligibility to carry the gloves into another Ashes Test. Jonny Bairstow is just 48 shy of 1,000 Test runs at Lord's - only nine have managed the feat Australia edged the tense first Test but should be wary of Bairstow in the second at Lord's There have been utterances from both Englishmen and Australians, in the past week or so, which frankly don't belong in 2023. Ollie Robinson's F-bombing Usman Khawaja was one of them. But Maxwell's was the more objectionable. Immeasurably so. That will have registered. There is certainly an insecurity behind that swashbuckling style - perhaps understandable in a man who has fought his way back into consideration so often. But Brendon McCullum seems to have unlocked more in him than any other England player. Bairstow's beautiful 2018 autobiography was titled A Clear Blue Sky - the story of a man hoping to find one - and the blue-sky thinking provided by McCullum and Ben Stokes has transformed him more than most. He will be a very dangerous individual in the days ahead. Several years ago, Bairstow approached sports psychologist David Priestley to sort out his mental approach to batting, though it was evidently not a long conversation. Priestley asked Bairstow to write down the basic principles of his batting. He wrote: 'See the ball, hit the ball, dominate, keep it simple'. Priestly read it, pushed it back, and said: 'That's your blueprint. Use it.' Bairstow laminated the paper and carried it in his kitbag. Australian commentator Jim Maxwell (right) branded Bairstow 'overweight' ahead of the second Ashes Test He has worn his Ashes experiences on his sleeve in a way which has left those of us who have tracked his rollercoaster Test career feeling like we have been right there alongside him. The celebration of his ninth Test century in the middle of the Sydney Cricket Ground, 18 months ago, will live long in the memory - Bairstow absorbing 105 balls in the final day of a fourth Test, guaranteeing a draw that ensured there would be no Ashes whitewash. His response was 'equal parts relief and told-you-so', one observer wrote that day. Nasser Hussain once described Bairstow as a 'street-fighting, over-my-dead-body' cricketer. He has more incentive than ever to take that game to Australia now.

BUMBLE'S GUIDE TO LORD'S ahead of second Ashes Test I never miss the stampede at Lord's as they open the gates for the members If the second Ashes Test is anything like Birmingham then we're in for a treat After impressing against Ireland, Josh Tongue has was a 'dream' Ashes nod By David Lloyd For The Daily Mail Published: 22:31, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:39, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments I never miss getting to Lord’s at 9am in the morning and seeing the massive queues snaking around the ground, waiting for the gunfire! Because when they open the gates for the members, it is an absolute stampede! What an occasion. It reminds me of the Grand National and I find it hilarious seeing some of the elder members of the cricketing community charging to get the best seats possible for the day. But once you’re inside, this is one of the more sedate grounds in the country — full of respect and nostalgia. And unlike Edgbaston, this is a proper posh day out. We’re down in the ‘Big Smoke’ where you can get a pint of bitter for £6.50 and it’s the exact same product as you get up north for four quid! Mail Sport's David 'Bumble' Lloyd described Lord's as 'a proper posh day out' ahead of the second Test Australia come into the clash 1-0 up in the series after a thrilling win at Edgbaston last week It’s that flat you could serve it in an envelope! But down here, you’re spoilt for choice for things to do and as a great people-watcher, Primrose Hill is a personal favourite. The Queens pub over there is one I’ve been visiting for years and despite the claims of one of their staffers that Liam Gallagher is a frequent visitor, I must admit I’ve never bumped into him. I will be making my annual trip to Soho to visit The French House which is one of the great watering holes renowned for its clientele and iconic of course, for their no mobile phones rule! You’re politely asked to go outside if you want to use yours. But there’s no pint pots in there — just halves! And it’s widely reputed that Peter Ustinov on a particularly thirsty day somersaulted through an open window there and caused a multi-car pile-up! As a lover of hats, I’ll most certainly be paying a visit to Camden Market too. Food-wise, celebrity chef Tommy Banks heads up the Edrich restaurant at Lord’s and that’s on my list too, among all the other options in the capital. It’ll be some week. But to the cricket and if it’s anything like Birmingham, we are in for a treat. England were not happy with that pitch and will be hoping this one is more responsive. Jimmy Anderson’s comments describing it like ‘Kryptonite’ for his bowling style were worrying and physically, this will be a big ask for him. Because if you’re Ben Stokes, you have to use Jimmy at Headingley and Old Trafford. Sometimes it’s tough on groundsmen because of the dry weather but with a fair amount of rain knocking about, they’ll be hoping that the square itself retains some moisture so the ball can move around off the surface. It looks like we’re getting a green seamer and with the slope here, there’ll be enough variations to work with but to go without Mark Wood is a big call from England. They’ve gone for Josh Tongue and that is a different proposition in itself. The difference is about three inches in height and he will hit the pitch hard but crucially he offers something different from last week. They must like him and you can mark my words that the Aussie players will be badgering their analyst about Tongue. Jimmy Anderson will likely be needed at both Headingley and Old Trafford later in the series Josh Tongue will hit the pitch hard but crucially he offers something different from last week in his express pace Moeen Ali's omission is another gutsy call and leaves England with not much batting after Jonny Bairstow Leaving out Moeen Ali is another gutsy call and leaves England with not much batting after Jonny Bairstow. The talk before the series was that Australia had a long tail but Pat Cummins won the game for them. Can any of our tail match Cummins’ effort? Australia would have been cock-a-hoop after winning at Edgbaston and you have to remember that opposition teams always seem to find an extra 10 per cent playing at Lord’s. Because it’s so special and it’s the home of cricket and they will thrive off that. It won’t be anywhere near as raucous at Edgbaston. It will be very much sedate, like I said earlier and perhaps a little bit upper class with a lot of decorum! You won’t find anyone here dressed up as Darth Vader, Robin Hood or a bevy of Butchers! England have to come back strongly. They missed chances and were sloppy with no-balls. 23 to four. That’s a huge difference! They need to get up to speed and there’s no better place to do so.

England skipper inspired by Zak Crawley's Far Eastern proverb to crack on with all-out attack in must-win Lord's Test England captain Ben Stokes says a Chinese proverb has inspired them to attack He said Zak Crawley's tale has given him confidence his team are not out of luck Stokes feels the team are in good spirits ahead of second Test vs Australia By Paul Newman for the Daily Mail Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:38 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments When Ben Stokes starts talking about Chinese farmers you know this Ashes series has taken an unexpected twist. This was not a second Test call-up at Lord’s even more surprising than Josh Tongue replacing Moeen Ali, but simply a way for the England captain to insist his best-laid pace bowling plans had not gone awry. First Jofra Archer and Olly Stone were ruled out, now Mark Wood is not fit enough to give England that all-important extra speed Stokes insisted was at the heart of his Ashes game plan when he told Nasser Hussain he wanted ‘flat and fast wickets’. So in comes Tongue, the nearest thing England have now to a bowler of express pace, for a Test of utmost importance and Stokes has to turn to Zak Crawley and his story about a Chinese farmer to shoot down the suggestion his side have run out of luck. ‘Brendon (McCullum) always goes round the group before he hands over to me to speak,’ said Stokes (right) at Lord’s yesterday. ‘This time Zak actually said, “I’ve got something to say” and he made an unbelievable speech in the huddle. Ben Stokes has revealed how a Chinese proverb has inspired England to continue attacking Australia in the second Ashes Test The England captain said Zak Crawley led a team meeting and stunned them with a story about a Chinese farmer who says, 'We’ll see if it’s good or bad' after their defeat to the Aussies ‘It was a story of a Chinese farmer who basically says, “We’ll see if it’s good or bad”, whenever something happens. That it’s never the end of the world. We don’t know why things happen, if it’s for good or not. It’s just something else to deal with. ‘So I’m very confident the team we’ve picked can walk away from here with a win. Rather than worry about what I don’t have, I’d rather be happy with what I do have.’ England’s Ashes hopes depend on it. Lose here and it is virtually all over. England’s men and women have played two classic Tests in the last fortnight, but the bottom line is Australia have won both of them and now it is crunch time. One more defeat and both the ‘Mashes’ and the ‘Washes’, as some are calling the two series, will be all but lost. Not that England are thinking that way. Stokes and his ‘s*** happens’ philosophy was totally in keeping with England’s relaxed mood at Lord’s yesterday. Nothing that happened at Edgbaston and since that nail- biting and narrow defeat has shaken their belief that Bazball is here to stay and, crucially, gives them their best chance of levelling this Ashes now. ‘Baz has just about come to terms that it’s a thing now, but he still hates it,’ smiled Stokes when asked about the label for England’s expansive, thrilling style. ‘But it’s been nice that lots of people have come up to me saying how much they were enthralled by the first Test. Stokes said he had been buoyed by plaudits of England's style - introduced by head coach Brendon McCullum (right) SO, WHAT IS CRAWLEY'S STORY? A Chinese story of unknown origin tells of a farmer who used a horse in his fields. One day, the horse escaped into the hills and, when the farmer’s neighbours sympathised with the old man over his bad luck, he replied: ‘Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?’ A week later, the escaped horse returned with a herd of wild horses from the hills, and the neighbours congratulated the farmer on his good luck. He replied: ‘Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows?’ Then, when the farmer’s son was attempting to tame one of the wild horses, he fell off its back and broke a leg. Everyone again sympathised with the farmer over his bad luck. The farmer said: ‘Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?’ Some weeks later, the army marched into the village and drafted every able-bodied youth they found. When they saw the farmer’s son with his broken leg, they let him stay. Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows? <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/nl/sport/cricket/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement ‘I had a conversation in a men’s changing room at a spa which was a bit awkward. This guy said, “Are you the cricketer or do you just look like him?”. I was like, “It’s me”. ‘So he said he doesn’t follow the game but went down the pub for a quick few on the last day of the first Test and ended up having a few more because he was transfixed watching the game. When you hear that, it makes you feel good.’ Stokes has often said this England squad are not results driven, but there was a subtle change of emphasis yesterday when he talked about the importance of winning this Ashes. ‘I don’t want to be misunderstood about that,’ he said. ‘We want to win every game. Losing sucks. But if we don’t win we’ll just keep doing what we’re doing and move on to the next game.’ To that end, Wood’s lack of confidence in his ability to get through this Test is a concern. Stokes may have said another week should mean he is available for the third Test at Headingley and beyond, but Wood remains a fragile part of this England team. Tongue was impressive on debut against Ireland, but this is a big step up and his inclusion in a four-seamer attack is not just a reflection of England’s concerns over Moeen Ali’s sore finger but on the condition of Stokes’ knee. The captain talked of his ‘confidence boost’ in being able to bowl at Edgbaston, but if he was sure he could perform the fourth seamer role properly then a specialist spinner would surely have been included, as one has been for all 14 Tests that Stokes has captained. The absence of Moeen, who had been declared fit, and Rehan Ahmed is also partly down to a very green Lord’s pitch and clearly, after the sub-continental surface at Edgbaston, England’s groundsmen have not listened to the captain’s pre-series plea for pace. ‘I’m not going to go there to say how easy or hard it is to prepare pitches,’ said Stokes diplomatically. ‘It’s a tough job and we have to respond to how the wicket presents itself. We’ve not bowled a ball on this one yet. Let’s have that conversation after the game.’ England are confident they can turn things around against Australia after losing the first Test One thing for certain is Australia will not leave out their spinner. Nathan Lyon goes into the second Test having become the first one to ever play 100 consecutive Tests and stands just five short of 500 wickets. Lyon remains a huge threat but so too is Joe Root, with the only surprise about his selection as spinner, as well as best batsman, being that England seem to have only just realised how good he can be with the ball. After all, he did once take five for eight against India, albeit on a very different pitch to the one that awaits today. There has been a lot of Aussie Ashes absurdity since Edgbaston, from Matthew Hayden’s attack on Ollie Robinson for daring to give Usman Khawaja a minor send-off, to the most ridiculous of all, Test Match Special commentator Jim Maxwell fat-shaming Jonny Bairstow in Mail Sport yesterday. But, significantly, none of it has come from the Australia team. Thank goodness we can now get on with the cricket again. The second Test should, weather permitting, be another classic. And England cannot afford to lose it.

No, Jonny Bairstow's fit and robust. He was always my first pick behind the stumps at Yorkshire Jonny Bairstow made a run a ball 78 alongside Joe Root in the Edgbaston Test The Yorkshire keeper-batter has recently returned from a freak broken leg EXCLUSIVE: Sledging war continues as Jim Maxwell queries Bairstow's weight By Jason Gillespie For The Daily Mail Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:36 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments Jonny Bairstow’s wicketkeeping and fitness have come in for some hefty criticism from some of the Australian media and the bare fact is that if you are a player who hasn’t performed it goes with the territory. Jonny's batting in the first Ashes Test , when he struck a run-a-ball 78 alongside Joe Root after England had been in a bit of a tricky spot, was excellent. And that's what the England team value in him - the ability to make strong, aggressive contributions with the bat. But I'm sure that Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes will have said to him heading into Lord's : ‘Look, we need more from you with the gloves.’ He needs to make sure he keeps chipping away, working on his drills because wicketkeepers need repetition. Jonny Bairstow's fitness and wicket-keeping were brought into question after Edgbaston Test Jason Gillespie was a former Head Coach of Yorkshire - Bairstow's county side since 2009 In cricket coaching, we talk about batters and bowlers taking daily vitamins — regular technical work — to keep themselves topped up, and the same is true for Jonny and his keeping. He just needs to make sure his vitamins are up in terms of his routines and preparation. He will have been looking to improve his footwork this week. Mention has been made of his weight but that is not something I’ve noticed. In my experience, he has always been a fit and robust cricketer. When I was Yorkshire head coach, he loved going for big runs around the streets as his preferred way of keeping in good nick and the recent broken leg might have affected his ability to do that. He really embraced road running because he always felt it strengthened his legs, contrary to the opinion it’s no good for knees. As for my time with him at Headingley, well, he was always my first pick behind the stumps. I arrived in 2012 and Jonny and Gerard Brophy were vying for the gloves. A lot of people at the club felt that Brophy was the better keeper. However, I was having none of that because I just felt that Jonny could change the course of the game and that, while his keeping was not the very best going around, it was solid. Australian commentator Jim Maxwell (right) branded Bairstow 'overweight' ahead of the second Ashes Test Bairstow (L) has been given the wicketkeeping gloves ahead of Ben Foakes (R) for the start of the series In fact, he is more than serviceable at international level, and much better than he showed at Edgbaston. I’ve always been of the belief that Jonny is a better cricketer when he has a second suit to focus on, and if you put all the eggs in the batting basket you don’t get as much out of him. Later, we recruited Andrew Hodd from Sussex, one of the best keepers in the country at the time and although we felt he was superior to Jonny with the gloves, it was really difficult to ignore someone like a Jonny Bairstow who changes games with the bat. Essentially, as a wicketkeeper you want to be invisible. Really good ones don’t get noticed. Look at Alex Carey, his opposite number in this Ashes. No one mentioned him last week because he was slick, sharp, and clean, getting the job done quietly and efficiently. Whereas, as Jonny discovered, wasted opportunities behind the stumps get magnified and replayed over and over and over again. If you miss a catch or stumping, the spotlight is on you and so you’ve got to try and find a way to minimise that. He did take a really good catch low to his right to dismiss Marnus Labuschagne off Stuart Broad but he’s still developing his fitness, coming back from quite a serious injury. Building that back up will just take some time. What does interest me, as an Australian looking into county cricket these days, is that everyone talks about Ben Foakes as his rival. Yes, he’s a wonderful player but I am going to throw another name in there in Ollie Robinson at Durham. Bairstow took a brilliant diving catch low to his right to dismiss Marnus Labuschagne in the first Test Durham's Ollie Robinson scored a big hundred in the County Championship to go top of the leading run-scorer list in Division Two I was very keen on getting him across to Sussex a few years ago because he’s a very good cricketer: an elite wicketkeeper, a fantastic batsman and a wonderful kid. It wouldn’t shock me if his name was to be mentioned regularly by the England management and selectors going forward. Robinson got a big hundred in this round of Championship matches — hitting 167 not out against Leicestershire. As I say, I’ve been a big fan of his for years. Plus, I also want to see caught Ollie Robinson, bowled Ollie Robinson on an international scorecard. That would be hilarious! Share or comment on this article: JASON GILLESPIE: Overweight?

The 32-year-old was horrified to hear the conclusions of the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket and said: ‘To the people involved in the game who have been made to feel unwelcome or unaccepted in the past, I am deeply sorry to hear of your experiences. Cricket is a game that needs to celebrate diversity on all fronts. We need to learn from past mistakes and do all we can to make people feel safe. ‘I have been an England player since 2011 and I feel very fortunate to have been a part of some incredibly diverse teams. We must be more inclusive and diverse because the game I love should be enjoyed without fear of discrimination or judgment. ‘I am Ben Stokes, born in New Zealand, a state-educated pupil who dropped out at 16 with one GCSE in P.E. I need help with the spelling and grammar in this speech and I am sitting here as the England men’s Test captain. ‘There’s so much more the game has to do. As players, we want to ensure this is truly a sport for everyone.’ England captain Ben Stokes insists cricket must be a game for everyone after a damning report about discrimination in the sport The revelations - which claimed sexism, racism and elitism were widespread in cricket - came days before the second Ashes Test gets underway at Lord's The ECB are set to escape the threat of outside regulation despite the damning conclusions of the report. There is no appetite in Government to get involved in regulating cricket — which will be a setback to the Commission, who have called for the ECB to be stripped of regulatory powers as one of 44 recommendations for change. It came as Yorkshire look set for a £500,000 fine and record points deduction that would condemn them to finishing bottom of the Second Division this season after admitting to four ECB racism charges. At a sanctions hearing on Tuesday ECB lawyers demanded deductions of between 48 and 72 points in the Championship, as well as four to six points in the T20 Blast and One Day Cup. It would effectively end their sporting season, while the fine could put the very survival of the club in jeopardy. The charges relate to mishandling the Azeem Rafiq case, the deletion of documents related to it and a failure to address the use of racist language at the club over a prolonged period. The findings were on the back of accusations made by former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq Share or comment on this article: Ben Stokes insists cricket must be a game that 'celebrates diversity on all fronts' e-mail 5 shares Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

They are only interested in squeezing more cash out of the club The delay to Man United's takeover feels like an act of vengeance to supporters United have been left with no brand or substance under the Glazers Fans protested against them on Tuesday as the club's sale continues to drag on By Ian Herbert for MailOnline Published: 18:00 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 21:40 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail 103 shares 282 View comments It was a hot, lazy June lunchtime and most of the world was taking a momentary pause from football, yet there was the face of Manchester City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak, on a TV screen, delivering his thoughts on what happens next. 'Today I'm speaking to you but I'm already thinking about next year,' he said, at the top of the news bulletin during an Ashes lunch break last week. 'We're always in growth mode. We're never in contentment and pause. We're never, \"Let's just milk the asset\".' This hardly needed pointing out. The summer transfer window is entering its third week and there's already been a Manchester City deal for Mateo Kovacic and a Manchester City drive to buy RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and a £90million Manchester City bid for Declan Rice . These are the hallmarks of owners with an obsessive intent to make their club better. The same can be said of Liverpool 's Fenway Sports Group, with Alexis Mac Allister through the Anfield door for a mere £35million. But over at Manchester United it's Groundhog Day. New transfer window, same old confusion. All brand, no substance. A club living in some vague hope that their hallowed name will eventually get them some players in, after their traditional midsummer game of whack-a-mole in the market. Avram and Joel Glazer are seemingly only interested in squeezing a few more million out of Manchester United United fans blocked the entrance to the megastore on Tuesday to coincide with the launch of the new kit as the club's takeover drags on Signing a quality striker was the obvious priority for United when the summer started but they made their first move for… a midfielder.. They went mid-range, for Mason Mount, because they are up to their eyes in wage payments and their own vast revenues can no longer insulate them from the risk of a spending breach. Mail Sport's Ian Herbert has questioned the motives of the Glazer family during the sale process of Manchester United But wait. They have suddenly tacked to Moises Caicedo, a different type of player and price bracket. And they're also looking at goalkeeper Andre Onana. So, where's the money for that quality striker, with a total budget of £140million? No-one knows. United have set values on many players they want to clear out and there is actually a suggestion that West Ham will take £40m plus a few of those makeweights, for Rice. Other clubs just laugh. If United had proprietors who were ruthlessly focused on the executive oversight of their club, as City and Liverpool's owners are, then Erik ten Hag might have a fully-assembled new squad for the return to training on July 9. He won't. United are, of course, marooned with football’s ultimate speculators - the Glazers. A family interested only in how they can squeeze more cash from the club, not how to keep up in a relentless competitive, strategic elite sports environment. Man City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (pictured lifting the Champions League trophy in Istanbul) has shown the obsession and desire needed to run an elite sports team Dragging out the sale of the club feels like an act of vengeance by the Glazers towards fans Custodians with an ounce of care for one of our country’s greatest sporting institutions would also see that Old Trafford is an aged, careworn place, now, desperately needing renewal. A shadow of Arsenal’s and Tottenham’s modern arenas. The lazy, semi-detached sloth of these chancers is more of a disgrace than ever this summer, given that they have their noses in the trough which has sustained them for so long - dragging out the interminable sale of United for a few million dollars more, to a point when the April deadline in that process long since became somewhere between an illusion and a practical joke. That prospective sale, to either Sheik Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani or Sir Jim Ratcliffe, belonged to the usual pre-summer optimism around United. The £5-6billion disposal would make the club the world’s most expensive. But, of course, it’s been torture - leaving the club in a state of limbo, top to bottom, with jobs, structures and to an extent even transfer strategy, uncertain - at a time when optimal clarity is needed. Meanwhile, the club’s latest financial results on Tuesday showed that borrowings from a revolving credit facility have almost doubled, to £203.7m, in a year. The US trading website Benzinga reported on Tuesday that Sheik Jassim is ahead of Ratcliffe in the race but without the remotest transparency or communication, Wall Street whispers are all United fans have to go on. There are doubts whether the sale of the club will be concluded before the window closes, let alone when the season starts. British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe (left) and Qatari Sheikh Jassim (right) are the two front-runners in the process. The fact the initial deadline was April has become a practical joke It all feels like the ultimate act of Glazer vengeance on a fanbase which manifestly detests them. United’s tendency to overpay for incoming players has obscured another chronic deficiency: their struggle to sell well. Highly rated midfield prospect Zidane Iqbal has just gone to Utrecht for a mere £800,000. But the only sale that currently matters is the one that will rescue this benighted club from the hands of those who have bled it dry for so long. Al Mubarak’s observations about not ‘milking the asset’ were no coincidence amid the drawn-out annexation of Manchester United. It was manifestly clear which club’s owners he was talking about. BEAUMONT AND CO DESERVE MORE TESTS The images my daughter sent me from Trent Bridge on Saturday told their own story of what her first day watching Test cricket, seeing Tammy Beaumont make history, meant to her. Women's cricket is making sure and steady progress but why is there only one women's Ashes Test this summer? It feels like there is the appetite for more. A DEFENSIVE ENGLAND IS NOT BLASPHEMY The England Test team's proclivity to attack at all costs has become such an article of faith that to put the case for a modicum of defence seems to have become a blasphemy. As if the two are mutually exclusive. Absolute nonsense, of course. Nasser Hussain's compelling interview with Kevin Pietersen in these pages on Saturday was a reminder, from a player you wouldn't exactly call a wall flower, that there is something that matters more than creeds and philosophies in sport. It's called winning. 'My issue is that it is an Ashes series,' Pietersen told Hussain. 'If we were playing against New Zealand or South Africa or India, it doesn't mean as much to the fan as an Ashes series.' It should be acceptable to demand a more defensive display from England after Zak Crawley boldly predicted his side would beat Australia by 150 runs in the second Test No-one's listening, though, because the bombast seems to have permeated all areas of the England realm. After defeat at Edgbaston, we were treated to this from Zak Crawley: 'We'll win the second Test. It will suit us a bit more, that Lord's pitch. So I'm confident we'll win by… I don't know, 150 runs?' If a player in the England football team had declared, ahead of a match against Germany or France, that the side would win 'I don't know, 3-0?', it's safe to assume Gareth Southgate would have taken him into a side room and robustly offered the benefit of his opinion about giving the opposition extra motivation. No-one blinked an eye at Crawley's crass pronouncement. That's the current England for you — so wrapped up in their own methodology that humility and self-effacement seem to have gone out the window. 'This England team are not about winning or losing, we're about entertainment,' Crawley concluded, contributing to the nonsensical orthodoxy that the urn is a mere incidental detail this summer.

The schedule for CWC 2023 was announced on Tuesday. Arch-rivals India and Pakistan will square off at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 this October at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The opening game of the World Cup is scheduled to place at the same venue on October 5 with a match between defending champions England and New Zealand in Ahmedabad, the ICC announced on Tuesday. “Preparations have started. We started preparations after IPL for the World Cup. We are renovating the stadium, corporate boxes. Ground conditions are excellent. Preparations will start from July 1 for the ground. We had a meeting with our curator. Eden Gardens is ready to host the World Cup. There are some patches here and there, within the next two months, we will resolve all those issues,” said Ganguly to ANI. On the WC schedule, Ganguly expressed his satisfaction, saying that they got “what we expected, what we wished for.” “We tried that we get a semifinal match this time and at the last moment, we got a semifinal match at Eden,” he said. Kolkata will host Qualifier 1 vs Bangladesh on October 28, Pakistan vs Bangladesh on October 31, India vs South Africa on November 5, England vs Pakistan on November 12 and the second semifinal on November 16. “Everyone’s first choice will be an India vs Pakistan semifinal at Eden Gardens, it would be a dream match,” he added. On the pitch, Ganguly said that the staff will go for a sporting wicket, which offers high-scoring contests and helps both bowlers and batters. “In IPL, everyone enjoyed the match since they were high scoring and the wicket condition was good. We will try maintaining it,” he added. Ganguly said that a decision on tickets price will be taken in the next couple of days. “We expect the crowd to come, we have a capacity of 65,000. Keeping this in mind, we will have a reasonable price,” he added. Lastly, he urged fans to come to the stadium to watch the matches or at least enjoy them live on TV. Ganguly said that the matches will be done smoothly with proper security for all during the Durga Puja days, which will take place during the duration of the tournament. “Last time also during international matches, Kolkata police managed this festival and an international match well. They cooperated with us. We are confident that matches will be carried out in a big way, with proper security and safety,” he said. Ahmedabad will host the tournament opener as well as the final. The other venues are Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Dharamsala, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune. Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram join Hyderabad in hosting the practice matches. Eight teams have qualified for the 46-day event through the Cricket World Cup Super League while the final two spots will be taken by the finalists of the World Cup Qualifier taking place in Zimbabwe.

They lost it because they made mistakes which they cannot repeat if they hope to hit back at Lord's and keep the Ashes alive . England's first mistake, although not many saw it at the time, was picking Moeen Ali. Focus was put on the mental side of him coming back after such a long time away from Test cricket, but we forgot about the physical demands. On the last day, when Edgbaston was taking turn, England's premier spinner could not hold the ball because his finger had been shredded. So that is an error. Then there were the mistakes made by Jonny Bairstow , usually such a good wicketkeeper. Bairstow had a poor game, especially standing up, and missed chances. If those errors had not been made, England would have won, but all we have seen since that Test are comments on the merits of Bazball and whether it can win the Ashes. England's breathtaking 'Bazball' style of play was not the reason for their defeat at Edgbaston England lost the first Test because they made mistakes which they cannot repeat at Lord's We must also remember that, whatever England say about not being a results-based side, the reason they have introduced this style is to maximise their chances of winning. Yes, they are considering the wider picture, the entertainment Bazball is providing and the good it can do Test cricket when it is in danger of being marginalised by Twenty20 and franchise leagues. But England want to win. I remember talking to Rob Key when he became managing director of England cricket and saying to him, 'Don't worry about the brand and style. Just win games of cricket because England have only won one of their last 17 Tests'. And he said, 'Yes, brilliant Einstein, but the way we are going to win games of cricket is by changing that brand and style'. That is what England have done. Their brand and style have led to them winning 11 of their last 14 matches. Winning is what they will be judged on and if they want to be entertaining then going to the Oval at 2-2 would be a lot more entertaining than being down 4-0. I have wanted England to win the whole of my life. But, as a 55-year-old, I do now see the bigger picture. When I left Edgbaston I looked at the crowd and the record viewing figures on Sky and thought, 'Yes, we want a bit more of that'. Then I heard Ben Stokes say people approached him after the Test to say how much they were riveted by it and I see my son receiving messages from his football mates saying, 'Aren't the Ashes brilliant. When's the next Test?' But I also appreciate the reason England are carrying on like this and still trying to take concerns about the result out of the equation is that they want their players to be free to enjoy themselves. As a consequence, they will play better. And they need to be at their very best now. You have to be careful at Lord's. The pitch may look green and there might be rain around but it can go very flat and you must have an attack that can bowl a side out in the second innings as well as the first. That is probably why they have gone for Josh Tongue. Hosts need a win at Lord's to avoid going 2-0 down in the series and staring defeat in the eye Josh Tongue has been selected for the second Test and will bring some much-needed pace I have said all along I would have gone the other way round had I been England or Australia. I would have played Mark Wood, had he been fit, or Tongue at Edgbaston and Mitchell Starc - if I had been in charge of the Australians - to provide pace on a slow pitch. Then, at Lord's, I would have played all the seamers for England and whoever misses out for Starc on Wednesday, either Scott Boland or Josh Hazlewood. But even though there was a case to play Chris Woakes here, because of his great record at Lord's and his batting ability at No 8, England will have remembered Tongue getting a five-wicket second-innings haul against Ireland on debut here when the pitch was flat. The reason England have been winning far more than they have been losing is that they have kept their positivity. That could change if they lose here because the moment you break that chain, the fear of failure can come creeping in again. England need to win now to keep that carefree mindset in place. Go two down and not only will Bazball be doubted but they will be nailed by everyone and some in the country could turn on them. So there's a lot at stake over the next five days.

JOHN McENROE on the void left by his BBC sidekick, electronic line calls - and why he expects Andy Murray to shine at Wimbledon The three-time Wimbledon champion has worked with Barker for over 20 years McEnroe believes that Djokovic is set to win a historic 24th Grand Slam in SW19 WIMBLEDON Q&A: Is it really Djokovic's to lose? And how far can Murray go? By Mike Dickson for MailOnline Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 23:20 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail 2 View comments John McEnroe knows that summers will never be quite the same again when he takes his customary seat at Wimbledon with the BBC, with Sue Barker no longer there . Aside from anything, the onus will be more on him than ever to provide the spark for the corporation’s coverage, but he will miss her on a personal level after more than 20 years working together . ‘She was incredible at what she did. So it’s going to be a void,’ says the American legend. ‘Doing the other side, the commentary side, as long as I have, I’ve been doing it with her. She just made it easier for everyone around her. God bless her, hopefully she’ll come by and say hello. So it’s a tough act to follow.’ A new era will begin for the corporation’s flagship sports event. Clare Balding is taking the main presenting role , with the early shift being occupied by cricket expert Isa Guha. The Beeb would like to have supplemented its ranks with significant former male players of a more recent vintage. But they come with a hefty price tag and recruitment has been difficult, so McEnroe, 64, retains pride of place, especially as Boris Becker cannot return due to him being banned from the UK after his early release from prison. McEnroe can usually be relied upon for an original opinion, but even he cannot, in all conscience, see past Novak Djokovic being the strong favourite for the event this year. ‘Novak doesn’t seem to have too many problems, he’s not even bothering to play a tournament beforehand,’ says McEnroe. John McEnroe will take part in BBC's Wimbledon coverage without Sue Barker for the first time The tennis legend doesn't believe anyone will get in the way of a historic 24th victory for French Open winner Novak Djokovic He does, however, point out that the unpredictable can happen on grass, and that there are players who can lift themselves to take advantage if the Serb has an off-day, or is troubled by any physical problem. Queen’s champion Carlos Alcaraz is one. ‘This guy is going to figure it out. It’s just a matter of when to me, not if,’ says McEnroe, adding that he would love to coach him on grass. He also believes that it would be foolish to write off Djokovic’s direct contemporary Andy Murray, with his early exit at Queen’s likely to have been the result of fatigue. ‘Certainly his best chance is at Wimbledon . He understands the nuances of grass better than anyone, I put him in the top dozen players that understand what it takes to compete and do well on grass. ‘It’s going to depend on his draw (taking place on Friday). I’ve actually been pleasantly surprised by his improved movement in the last couple of years. ‘I’m sure he’s been inspired by Novak because they are the same age and he’ll see this guy, who looks like he’s 25. ‘I don’t know how Andy is even playing in the first place. I’m pulling for him to do something, he’s a Hall of Famer who has been to 11 Grand Slam finals, so I’m hoping he will be able to go out on his own terms.’ McEnroe’s fame has long since spread beyond tennis, and he has been acquiring a new following through his role as narrator of the Netflix comedy drama Never Have I Ever. As he dryly acknowledges, he would not have had so many post-playing career avenues opened to him had he not had so many blow-ups with officialdom while on the court. Therefore it is with some reluctance that he believes that, with the recent ATP ruling that all line calls on the regular tour will be made electronically by 2025 , line judges’ days are numbered at Wimbledon. But the three-time winner is adamant that Andy Murray stay in the conversation on grass McEnroe claims he would have loved to have coached world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz on the turf ‘That’s where everything’s headed. I don’t think there’s any two ways about it,’ he says. ‘There’s other ways that players can engage. It’s not just the linespeople. With (Ilie) Nastase, when they first had the Cyclops machine, I was like, “Nasty, they got Cyclops, we can’t question a call”. And he was like, “Macaroni. Don’t worry, we can figure something out. There are other things”. ‘If you have equipment that’s accurate, I’m sorry, you’ve got to go with that. Maybe I wouldn’t be talking to you now because of the antics, and maybe I would have won more but I would have been more boring. ‘But this is just the way it’s going. I will say that if you had told me at 18 that they’ve got a system where they get every call correct I would definitely have wanted that.’ John McEnroe will be part of the BBC’s commentary team on Wimbledon 2023 across TV and radio.

He has proved people wrong again and again Jonny Bairstow is just 48 runs short of an impressive landmark in English cricket The Yorkshire keeper-batter's demeanour makes him English cricket's everyman EXCLUSIVE: Sledging war continues as Jim Maxwell queries Bairstow's weight By Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail Published: 22:30, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:52, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments The landmark just up ahead for Jonny Bairstow is testament to his extraordinary powers of perseverance in cricket. A mere 48 runs in the course of the next five days will make him only the 10th English player to complete 1,000 of them at Lord's, though none of the select group has a story of survival quite like his. He has proved people wrong, again and again, and generally engaged in his best work when the doubts are most vivid. There is timelessness about the man, who has been left out and moved about the order so often that the notion of him being here, aged 33, a pillar of the new England, is an achievement against all odds. He is English cricket's everyman, too, because of that demeanour of his - always showing exactly how much it means and how much effort has been expended to deliver. On the eve of the Test, he finds himself at the centre of a different kind of warfare - Jim Maxwell's questioning of his weight, as well as his eligibility to carry the gloves into another Ashes Test. Jonny Bairstow is just 48 shy of 1,000 Test runs at Lord's - only nine have managed the feat Australia edged the tense first Test but should be wary of Bairstow in the second at Lord's There have been utterances from both Englishmen and Australians, in the past week or so, which frankly don't belong in 2023. Ollie Robinson's F-bombing Usman Khawaja was one of them. But Maxwell's was the more objectionable. Immeasurably so. That will have registered. There is certainly an insecurity behind that swashbuckling style - perhaps understandable in a man who has fought his way back into consideration so often. But Brendon McCullum seems to have unlocked more in him than any other England player. Bairstow's beautiful 2018 autobiography was titled A Clear Blue Sky - the story of a man hoping to find one - and the blue-sky thinking provided by McCullum and Ben Stokes has transformed him more than most. He will be a very dangerous individual in the days ahead. Several years ago, Bairstow approached sports psychologist David Priestley to sort out his mental approach to batting, though it was evidently not a long conversation. Priestley asked Bairstow to write down the basic principles of his batting. He wrote: 'See the ball, hit the ball, dominate, keep it simple'. Priestly read it, pushed it back, and said: 'That's your blueprint. Use it.' Bairstow laminated the paper and carried it in his kitbag. Australian commentator Jim Maxwell (right) branded Bairstow 'overweight' ahead of the second Ashes Test He has worn his Ashes experiences on his sleeve in a way which has left those of us who have tracked his rollercoaster Test career feeling like we have been right there alongside him. The celebration of his ninth Test century in the middle of the Sydney Cricket Ground, 18 months ago, will live long in the memory - Bairstow absorbing 105 balls in the final day of a fourth Test, guaranteeing a draw that ensured there would be no Ashes whitewash. His response was 'equal parts relief and told-you-so', one observer wrote that day. Nasser Hussain once described Bairstow as a 'street-fighting, over-my-dead-body' cricketer. He has more incentive than ever to take that game to Australia now.

BUMBLE'S GUIDE TO LORD'S ahead of second Ashes Test I never miss the stampede at Lord's as they open the gates for the members If the second Ashes Test is anything like Birmingham then we're in for a treat After impressing against Ireland, Josh Tongue has was a 'dream' Ashes nod By David Lloyd For The Daily Mail Published: 22:31, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:39, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments I never miss getting to Lord’s at 9am in the morning and seeing the massive queues snaking around the ground, waiting for the gunfire! Because when they open the gates for the members, it is an absolute stampede! What an occasion. It reminds me of the Grand National and I find it hilarious seeing some of the elder members of the cricketing community charging to get the best seats possible for the day. But once you’re inside, this is one of the more sedate grounds in the country — full of respect and nostalgia. And unlike Edgbaston, this is a proper posh day out. We’re down in the ‘Big Smoke’ where you can get a pint of bitter for £6.50 and it’s the exact same product as you get up north for four quid! Mail Sport's David 'Bumble' Lloyd described Lord's as 'a proper posh day out' ahead of the second Test Australia come into the clash 1-0 up in the series after a thrilling win at Edgbaston last week It’s that flat you could serve it in an envelope! But down here, you’re spoilt for choice for things to do and as a great people-watcher, Primrose Hill is a personal favourite. The Queens pub over there is one I’ve been visiting for years and despite the claims of one of their staffers that Liam Gallagher is a frequent visitor, I must admit I’ve never bumped into him. I will be making my annual trip to Soho to visit The French House which is one of the great watering holes renowned for its clientele and iconic of course, for their no mobile phones rule! You’re politely asked to go outside if you want to use yours. But there’s no pint pots in there — just halves! And it’s widely reputed that Peter Ustinov on a particularly thirsty day somersaulted through an open window there and caused a multi-car pile-up! As a lover of hats, I’ll most certainly be paying a visit to Camden Market too. Food-wise, celebrity chef Tommy Banks heads up the Edrich restaurant at Lord’s and that’s on my list too, among all the other options in the capital. It’ll be some week. But to the cricket and if it’s anything like Birmingham, we are in for a treat. England were not happy with that pitch and will be hoping this one is more responsive. Jimmy Anderson’s comments describing it like ‘Kryptonite’ for his bowling style were worrying and physically, this will be a big ask for him. Because if you’re Ben Stokes, you have to use Jimmy at Headingley and Old Trafford. Sometimes it’s tough on groundsmen because of the dry weather but with a fair amount of rain knocking about, they’ll be hoping that the square itself retains some moisture so the ball can move around off the surface. It looks like we’re getting a green seamer and with the slope here, there’ll be enough variations to work with but to go without Mark Wood is a big call from England. They’ve gone for Josh Tongue and that is a different proposition in itself. The difference is about three inches in height and he will hit the pitch hard but crucially he offers something different from last week. They must like him and you can mark my words that the Aussie players will be badgering their analyst about Tongue. Jimmy Anderson will likely be needed at both Headingley and Old Trafford later in the series Josh Tongue will hit the pitch hard but crucially he offers something different from last week in his express pace Moeen Ali's omission is another gutsy call and leaves England with not much batting after Jonny Bairstow Leaving out Moeen Ali is another gutsy call and leaves England with not much batting after Jonny Bairstow. The talk before the series was that Australia had a long tail but Pat Cummins won the game for them. Can any of our tail match Cummins’ effort? Australia would have been cock-a-hoop after winning at Edgbaston and you have to remember that opposition teams always seem to find an extra 10 per cent playing at Lord’s. Because it’s so special and it’s the home of cricket and they will thrive off that. It won’t be anywhere near as raucous at Edgbaston. It will be very much sedate, like I said earlier and perhaps a little bit upper class with a lot of decorum! You won’t find anyone here dressed up as Darth Vader, Robin Hood or a bevy of Butchers! England have to come back strongly. They missed chances and were sloppy with no-balls. 23 to four. That’s a huge difference! They need to get up to speed and there’s no better place to do so.

England skipper inspired by Zak Crawley's Far Eastern proverb to crack on with all-out attack in must-win Lord's Test England captain Ben Stokes says a Chinese proverb has inspired them to attack He said Zak Crawley's tale has given him confidence his team are not out of luck Stokes feels the team are in good spirits ahead of second Test vs Australia By Paul Newman for the Daily Mail Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:38 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments When Ben Stokes starts talking about Chinese farmers you know this Ashes series has taken an unexpected twist. This was not a second Test call-up at Lord’s even more surprising than Josh Tongue replacing Moeen Ali, but simply a way for the England captain to insist his best-laid pace bowling plans had not gone awry. First Jofra Archer and Olly Stone were ruled out, now Mark Wood is not fit enough to give England that all-important extra speed Stokes insisted was at the heart of his Ashes game plan when he told Nasser Hussain he wanted ‘flat and fast wickets’. So in comes Tongue, the nearest thing England have now to a bowler of express pace, for a Test of utmost importance and Stokes has to turn to Zak Crawley and his story about a Chinese farmer to shoot down the suggestion his side have run out of luck. ‘Brendon (McCullum) always goes round the group before he hands over to me to speak,’ said Stokes (right) at Lord’s yesterday. ‘This time Zak actually said, “I’ve got something to say” and he made an unbelievable speech in the huddle. Ben Stokes has revealed how a Chinese proverb has inspired England to continue attacking Australia in the second Ashes Test The England captain said Zak Crawley led a team meeting and stunned them with a story about a Chinese farmer who says, 'We’ll see if it’s good or bad' after their defeat to the Aussies ‘It was a story of a Chinese farmer who basically says, “We’ll see if it’s good or bad”, whenever something happens. That it’s never the end of the world. We don’t know why things happen, if it’s for good or not. It’s just something else to deal with. ‘So I’m very confident the team we’ve picked can walk away from here with a win. Rather than worry about what I don’t have, I’d rather be happy with what I do have.’ England’s Ashes hopes depend on it. Lose here and it is virtually all over. England’s men and women have played two classic Tests in the last fortnight, but the bottom line is Australia have won both of them and now it is crunch time. One more defeat and both the ‘Mashes’ and the ‘Washes’, as some are calling the two series, will be all but lost. Not that England are thinking that way. Stokes and his ‘s*** happens’ philosophy was totally in keeping with England’s relaxed mood at Lord’s yesterday. Nothing that happened at Edgbaston and since that nail- biting and narrow defeat has shaken their belief that Bazball is here to stay and, crucially, gives them their best chance of levelling this Ashes now. ‘Baz has just about come to terms that it’s a thing now, but he still hates it,’ smiled Stokes when asked about the label for England’s expansive, thrilling style. ‘But it’s been nice that lots of people have come up to me saying how much they were enthralled by the first Test. Stokes said he had been buoyed by plaudits of England's style - introduced by head coach Brendon McCullum (right) SO, WHAT IS CRAWLEY'S STORY? A Chinese story of unknown origin tells of a farmer who used a horse in his fields. One day, the horse escaped into the hills and, when the farmer’s neighbours sympathised with the old man over his bad luck, he replied: ‘Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?’ A week later, the escaped horse returned with a herd of wild horses from the hills, and the neighbours congratulated the farmer on his good luck. He replied: ‘Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows?’ Then, when the farmer’s son was attempting to tame one of the wild horses, he fell off its back and broke a leg. Everyone again sympathised with the farmer over his bad luck. The farmer said: ‘Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?’ Some weeks later, the army marched into the village and drafted every able-bodied youth they found. When they saw the farmer’s son with his broken leg, they let him stay. Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows? <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/nl/sport/cricket/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement ‘I had a conversation in a men’s changing room at a spa which was a bit awkward.

I was like, “It’s me”. ‘So he said he doesn’t follow the game but went down the pub for a quick few on the last day of the first Test and ended up having a few more because he was transfixed watching the game. When you hear that, it makes you feel good.’ Stokes has often said this England squad are not results driven, but there was a subtle change of emphasis yesterday when he talked about the importance of winning this Ashes. ‘I don’t want to be misunderstood about that,’ he said. ‘We want to win every game. Losing sucks. But if we don’t win we’ll just keep doing what we’re doing and move on to the next game.’ To that end, Wood’s lack of confidence in his ability to get through this Test is a concern. Stokes may have said another week should mean he is available for the third Test at Headingley and beyond, but Wood remains a fragile part of this England team. Tongue was impressive on debut against Ireland, but this is a big step up and his inclusion in a four-seamer attack is not just a reflection of England’s concerns over Moeen Ali’s sore finger but on the condition of Stokes’ knee. The captain talked of his ‘confidence boost’ in being able to bowl at Edgbaston, but if he was sure he could perform the fourth seamer role properly then a specialist spinner would surely have been included, as one has been for all 14 Tests that Stokes has captained. The absence of Moeen, who had been declared fit, and Rehan Ahmed is also partly down to a very green Lord’s pitch and clearly, after the sub-continental surface at Edgbaston, England’s groundsmen have not listened to the captain’s pre-series plea for pace. ‘I’m not going to go there to say how easy or hard it is to prepare pitches,’ said Stokes diplomatically. ‘It’s a tough job and we have to respond to how the wicket presents itself. We’ve not bowled a ball on this one yet. Let’s have that conversation after the game.’ England are confident they can turn things around against Australia after losing the first Test One thing for certain is Australia will not leave out their spinner. Nathan Lyon goes into the second Test having become the first one to ever play 100 consecutive Tests and stands just five short of 500 wickets. Lyon remains a huge threat but so too is Joe Root, with the only surprise about his selection as spinner, as well as best batsman, being that England seem to have only just realised how good he can be with the ball. After all, he did once take five for eight against India, albeit on a very different pitch to the one that awaits today. There has been a lot of Aussie Ashes absurdity since Edgbaston, from Matthew Hayden’s attack on Ollie Robinson for daring to give Usman Khawaja a minor send-off, to the most ridiculous of all, Test Match Special commentator Jim Maxwell fat-shaming Jonny Bairstow in Mail Sport yesterday. But, significantly, none of it has come from the Australia team. Thank goodness we can now get on with the cricket again. The second Test should, weather permitting, be another classic. And England cannot afford to lose it.

No, Jonny Bairstow's fit and robust. He was always my first pick behind the stumps at Yorkshire Jonny Bairstow made a run a ball 78 alongside Joe Root in the Edgbaston Test The Yorkshire keeper-batter has recently returned from a freak broken leg EXCLUSIVE: Sledging war continues as Jim Maxwell queries Bairstow's weight By Jason Gillespie For The Daily Mail Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:36 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments Jonny Bairstow’s wicketkeeping and fitness have come in for some hefty criticism from some of the Australian media and the bare fact is that if you are a player who hasn’t performed it goes with the territory. Jonny's batting in the first Ashes Test , when he struck a run-a-ball 78 alongside Joe Root after England had been in a bit of a tricky spot, was excellent. And that's what the England team value in him - the ability to make strong, aggressive contributions with the bat. But I'm sure that Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes will have said to him heading into Lord's : ‘Look, we need more from you with the gloves.’ He needs to make sure he keeps chipping away, working on his drills because wicketkeepers need repetition. Jonny Bairstow's fitness and wicket-keeping were brought into question after Edgbaston Test Jason Gillespie was a former Head Coach of Yorkshire - Bairstow's county side since 2009 In cricket coaching, we talk about batters and bowlers taking daily vitamins — regular technical work — to keep themselves topped up, and the same is true for Jonny and his keeping. He just needs to make sure his vitamins are up in terms of his routines and preparation. He will have been looking to improve his footwork this week. Mention has been made of his weight but that is not something I’ve noticed. In my experience, he has always been a fit and robust cricketer. When I was Yorkshire head coach, he loved going for big runs around the streets as his preferred way of keeping in good nick and the recent broken leg might have affected his ability to do that. He really embraced road running because he always felt it strengthened his legs, contrary to the opinion it’s no good for knees. As for my time with him at Headingley, well, he was always my first pick behind the stumps. I arrived in 2012 and Jonny and Gerard Brophy were vying for the gloves. A lot of people at the club felt that Brophy was the better keeper. However, I was having none of that because I just felt that Jonny could change the course of the game and that, while his keeping was not the very best going around, it was solid. Australian commentator Jim Maxwell (right) branded Bairstow 'overweight' ahead of the second Ashes Test Bairstow (L) has been given the wicketkeeping gloves ahead of Ben Foakes (R) for the start of the series In fact, he is more than serviceable at international level, and much better than he showed at Edgbaston. I’ve always been of the belief that Jonny is a better cricketer when he has a second suit to focus on, and if you put all the eggs in the batting basket you don’t get as much out of him. Later, we recruited Andrew Hodd from Sussex, one of the best keepers in the country at the time and although we felt he was superior to Jonny with the gloves, it was really difficult to ignore someone like a Jonny Bairstow who changes games with the bat. Essentially, as a wicketkeeper you want to be invisible. Really good ones don’t get noticed. Look at Alex Carey, his opposite number in this Ashes. No one mentioned him last week because he was slick, sharp, and clean, getting the job done quietly and efficiently. Whereas, as Jonny discovered, wasted opportunities behind the stumps get magnified and replayed over and over and over again. If you miss a catch or stumping, the spotlight is on you and so you’ve got to try and find a way to minimise that. He did take a really good catch low to his right to dismiss Marnus Labuschagne off Stuart Broad but he’s still developing his fitness, coming back from quite a serious injury. Building that back up will just take some time. What does interest me, as an Australian looking into county cricket these days, is that everyone talks about Ben Foakes as his rival. Yes, he’s a wonderful player but I am going to throw another name in there in Ollie Robinson at Durham. Bairstow took a brilliant diving catch low to his right to dismiss Marnus Labuschagne in the first Test Durham's Ollie Robinson scored a big hundred in the County Championship to go top of the leading run-scorer list in Division Two I was very keen on getting him across to Sussex a few years ago because he’s a very good cricketer: an elite wicketkeeper, a fantastic batsman and a wonderful kid. It wouldn’t shock me if his name was to be mentioned regularly by the England management and selectors going forward. Robinson got a big hundred in this round of Championship matches — hitting 167 not out against Leicestershire. As I say, I’ve been a big fan of his for years. Plus, I also want to see caught Ollie Robinson, bowled Ollie Robinson on an international scorecard. That would be hilarious! Share or comment on this article: JASON GILLESPIE: Overweight?

The 32-year-old was horrified to hear the conclusions of the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket and said: ‘To the people involved in the game who have been made to feel unwelcome or unaccepted in the past, I am deeply sorry to hear of your experiences. Cricket is a game that needs to celebrate diversity on all fronts. We need to learn from past mistakes and do all we can to make people feel safe. ‘I have been an England player since 2011 and I feel very fortunate to have been a part of some incredibly diverse teams. We must be more inclusive and diverse because the game I love should be enjoyed without fear of discrimination or judgment. ‘I am Ben Stokes, born in New Zealand, a state-educated pupil who dropped out at 16 with one GCSE in P.E. I need help with the spelling and grammar in this speech and I am sitting here as the England men’s Test captain. ‘There’s so much more the game has to do. As players, we want to ensure this is truly a sport for everyone.’ England captain Ben Stokes insists cricket must be a game for everyone after a damning report about discrimination in the sport The revelations - which claimed sexism, racism and elitism were widespread in cricket - came days before the second Ashes Test gets underway at Lord's The ECB are set to escape the threat of outside regulation despite the damning conclusions of the report. There is no appetite in Government to get involved in regulating cricket — which will be a setback to the Commission, who have called for the ECB to be stripped of regulatory powers as one of 44 recommendations for change. It came as Yorkshire look set for a £500,000 fine and record points deduction that would condemn them to finishing bottom of the Second Division this season after admitting to four ECB racism charges. At a sanctions hearing on Tuesday ECB lawyers demanded deductions of between 48 and 72 points in the Championship, as well as four to six points in the T20 Blast and One Day Cup. It would effectively end their sporting season, while the fine could put the very survival of the club in jeopardy. The charges relate to mishandling the Azeem Rafiq case, the deletion of documents related to it and a failure to address the use of racist language at the club over a prolonged period. The findings were on the back of accusations made by former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq Share or comment on this article: Ben Stokes insists cricket must be a game that 'celebrates diversity on all fronts' e-mail 5 shares Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

They are only interested in squeezing more cash out of the club The delay to Man United's takeover feels like an act of vengeance to supporters United have been left with no brand or substance under the Glazers Fans protested against them on Tuesday as the club's sale continues to drag on By Ian Herbert for MailOnline Published: 18:00 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 21:40 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail 103 shares 282 View comments It was a hot, lazy June lunchtime and most of the world was taking a momentary pause from football, yet there was the face of Manchester City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak, on a TV screen, delivering his thoughts on what happens next. 'Today I'm speaking to you but I'm already thinking about next year,' he said, at the top of the news bulletin during an Ashes lunch break last week. 'We're always in growth mode. We're never in contentment and pause. We're never, \"Let's just milk the asset\".' This hardly needed pointing out. The summer transfer window is entering its third week and there's already been a Manchester City deal for Mateo Kovacic and a Manchester City drive to buy RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and a £90million Manchester City bid for Declan Rice . These are the hallmarks of owners with an obsessive intent to make their club better. The same can be said of Liverpool 's Fenway Sports Group, with Alexis Mac Allister through the Anfield door for a mere £35million. But over at Manchester United it's Groundhog Day. New transfer window, same old confusion. All brand, no substance. A club living in some vague hope that their hallowed name will eventually get them some players in, after their traditional midsummer game of whack-a-mole in the market. Avram and Joel Glazer are seemingly only interested in squeezing a few more million out of Manchester United United fans blocked the entrance to the megastore on Tuesday to coincide with the launch of the new kit as the club's takeover drags on Signing a quality striker was the obvious priority for United when the summer started but they made their first move for… a midfielder.. They went mid-range, for Mason Mount, because they are up to their eyes in wage payments and their own vast revenues can no longer insulate them from the risk of a spending breach. Mail Sport's Ian Herbert has questioned the motives of the Glazer family during the sale process of Manchester United But wait. They have suddenly tacked to Moises Caicedo, a different type of player and price bracket. And they're also looking at goalkeeper Andre Onana. So, where's the money for that quality striker, with a total budget of £140million? No-one knows. United have set values on many players they want to clear out and there is actually a suggestion that West Ham will take £40m plus a few of those makeweights, for Rice. Other clubs just laugh. If United had proprietors who were ruthlessly focused on the executive oversight of their club, as City and Liverpool's owners are, then Erik ten Hag might have a fully-assembled new squad for the return to training on July 9. He won't. United are, of course, marooned with football’s ultimate speculators - the Glazers. A family interested only in how they can squeeze more cash from the club, not how to keep up in a relentless competitive, strategic elite sports environment. Man City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (pictured lifting the Champions League trophy in Istanbul) has shown the obsession and desire needed to run an elite sports team Dragging out the sale of the club feels like an act of vengeance by the Glazers towards fans Custodians with an ounce of care for one of our country’s greatest sporting institutions would also see that Old Trafford is an aged, careworn place, now, desperately needing renewal. A shadow of Arsenal’s and Tottenham’s modern arenas. The lazy, semi-detached sloth of these chancers is more of a disgrace than ever this summer, given that they have their noses in the trough which has sustained them for so long - dragging out the interminable sale of United for a few million dollars more, to a point when the April deadline in that process long since became somewhere between an illusion and a practical joke. That prospective sale, to either Sheik Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani or Sir Jim Ratcliffe, belonged to the usual pre-summer optimism around United. The £5-6billion disposal would make the club the world’s most expensive. But, of course, it’s been torture - leaving the club in a state of limbo, top to bottom, with jobs, structures and to an extent even transfer strategy, uncertain - at a time when optimal clarity is needed. Meanwhile, the club’s latest financial results on Tuesday showed that borrowings from a revolving credit facility have almost doubled, to £203.7m, in a year. The US trading website Benzinga reported on Tuesday that Sheik Jassim is ahead of Ratcliffe in the race but without the remotest transparency or communication, Wall Street whispers are all United fans have to go on. There are doubts whether the sale of the club will be concluded before the window closes, let alone when the season starts. British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe (left) and Qatari Sheikh Jassim (right) are the two front-runners in the process. The fact the initial deadline was April has become a practical joke It all feels like the ultimate act of Glazer vengeance on a fanbase which manifestly detests them. United’s tendency to overpay for incoming players has obscured another chronic deficiency: their struggle to sell well. Highly rated midfield prospect Zidane Iqbal has just gone to Utrecht for a mere £800,000. But the only sale that currently matters is the one that will rescue this benighted club from the hands of those who have bled it dry for so long. Al Mubarak’s observations about not ‘milking the asset’ were no coincidence amid the drawn-out annexation of Manchester United. It was manifestly clear which club’s owners he was talking about. BEAUMONT AND CO DESERVE MORE TESTS The images my daughter sent me from Trent Bridge on Saturday told their own story of what her first day watching Test cricket, seeing Tammy Beaumont make history, meant to her. Women's cricket is making sure and steady progress but why is there only one women's Ashes Test this summer? It feels like there is the appetite for more. A DEFENSIVE ENGLAND IS NOT BLASPHEMY The England Test team's proclivity to attack at all costs has become such an article of faith that to put the case for a modicum of defence seems to have become a blasphemy. As if the two are mutually exclusive. Absolute nonsense, of course. Nasser Hussain's compelling interview with Kevin Pietersen in these pages on Saturday was a reminder, from a player you wouldn't exactly call a wall flower, that there is something that matters more than creeds and philosophies in sport. It's called winning. 'My issue is that it is an Ashes series,' Pietersen told Hussain. 'If we were playing against New Zealand or South Africa or India, it doesn't mean as much to the fan as an Ashes series.' It should be acceptable to demand a more defensive display from England after Zak Crawley boldly predicted his side would beat Australia by 150 runs in the second Test No-one's listening, though, because the bombast seems to have permeated all areas of the England realm. After defeat at Edgbaston, we were treated to this from Zak Crawley: 'We'll win the second Test. It will suit us a bit more, that Lord's pitch. So I'm confident we'll win by… I don't know, 150 runs?' If a player in the England football team had declared, ahead of a match against Germany or France, that the side would win 'I don't know, 3-0?', it's safe to assume Gareth Southgate would have taken him into a side room and robustly offered the benefit of his opinion about giving the opposition extra motivation. No-one blinked an eye at Crawley's crass pronouncement. That's the current England for you — so wrapped up in their own methodology that humility and self-effacement seem to have gone out the window. 'This England team are not about winning or losing, we're about entertainment,' Crawley concluded, contributing to the nonsensical orthodoxy that the urn is a mere incidental detail this summer.

The schedule for CWC 2023 was announced on Tuesday. Arch-rivals India and Pakistan will square off at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 this October at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The opening game of the World Cup is scheduled to place at the same venue on October 5 with a match between defending champions England and New Zealand in Ahmedabad, the ICC announced on Tuesday. “Preparations have started. We started preparations after IPL for the World Cup. We are renovating the stadium, corporate boxes. Ground conditions are excellent. Preparations will start from July 1 for the ground. We had a meeting with our curator. Eden Gardens is ready to host the World Cup. There are some patches here and there, within the next two months, we will resolve all those issues,” said Ganguly to ANI. On the WC schedule, Ganguly expressed his satisfaction, saying that they got “what we expected, what we wished for.” “We tried that we get a semifinal match this time and at the last moment, we got a semifinal match at Eden,” he said. Kolkata will host Qualifier 1 vs Bangladesh on October 28, Pakistan vs Bangladesh on October 31, India vs South Africa on November 5, England vs Pakistan on November 12 and the second semifinal on November 16. “Everyone’s first choice will be an India vs Pakistan semifinal at Eden Gardens, it would be a dream match,” he added. On the pitch, Ganguly said that the staff will go for a sporting wicket, which offers high-scoring contests and helps both bowlers and batters. “In IPL, everyone enjoyed the match since they were high scoring and the wicket condition was good. We will try maintaining it,” he added. Ganguly said that a decision on tickets price will be taken in the next couple of days. “We expect the crowd to come, we have a capacity of 65,000. Keeping this in mind, we will have a reasonable price,” he added. Lastly, he urged fans to come to the stadium to watch the matches or at least enjoy them live on TV. Ganguly said that the matches will be done smoothly with proper security for all during the Durga Puja days, which will take place during the duration of the tournament. “Last time also during international matches, Kolkata police managed this festival and an international match well. They cooperated with us. We are confident that matches will be carried out in a big way, with proper security and safety,” he said. Ahmedabad will host the tournament opener as well as the final. The other venues are Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Dharamsala, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune. Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram join Hyderabad in hosting the practice matches. Eight teams have qualified for the 46-day event through the Cricket World Cup Super League while the final two spots will be taken by the finalists of the World Cup Qualifier taking place in Zimbabwe.

They lost it because they made mistakes which they cannot repeat if they hope to hit back at Lord's and keep the Ashes alive . England's first mistake, although not many saw it at the time, was picking Moeen Ali. Focus was put on the mental side of him coming back after such a long time away from Test cricket, but we forgot about the physical demands. On the last day, when Edgbaston was taking turn, England's premier spinner could not hold the ball because his finger had been shredded. So that is an error. Then there were the mistakes made by Jonny Bairstow , usually such a good wicketkeeper. Bairstow had a poor game, especially standing up, and missed chances. If those errors had not been made, England would have won, but all we have seen since that Test are comments on the merits of Bazball and whether it can win the Ashes. England's breathtaking 'Bazball' style of play was not the reason for their defeat at Edgbaston England lost the first Test because they made mistakes which they cannot repeat at Lord's We must also remember that, whatever England say about not being a results-based side, the reason they have introduced this style is to maximise their chances of winning. Yes, they are considering the wider picture, the entertainment Bazball is providing and the good it can do Test cricket when it is in danger of being marginalised by Twenty20 and franchise leagues. But England want to win. I remember talking to Rob Key when he became managing director of England cricket and saying to him, 'Don't worry about the brand and style. Just win games of cricket because England have only won one of their last 17 Tests'. And he said, 'Yes, brilliant Einstein, but the way we are going to win games of cricket is by changing that brand and style'. That is what England have done. Their brand and style have led to them winning 11 of their last 14 matches. Winning is what they will be judged on and if they want to be entertaining then going to the Oval at 2-2 would be a lot more entertaining than being down 4-0. I have wanted England to win the whole of my life. But, as a 55-year-old, I do now see the bigger picture. When I left Edgbaston I looked at the crowd and the record viewing figures on Sky and thought, 'Yes, we want a bit more of that'. Then I heard Ben Stokes say people approached him after the Test to say how much they were riveted by it and I see my son receiving messages from his football mates saying, 'Aren't the Ashes brilliant. When's the next Test?' But I also appreciate the reason England are carrying on like this and still trying to take concerns about the result out of the equation is that they want their players to be free to enjoy themselves. As a consequence, they will play better. And they need to be at their very best now. You have to be careful at Lord's. The pitch may look green and there might be rain around but it can go very flat and you must have an attack that can bowl a side out in the second innings as well as the first. That is probably why they have gone for Josh Tongue. Hosts need a win at Lord's to avoid going 2-0 down in the series and staring defeat in the eye Josh Tongue has been selected for the second Test and will bring some much-needed pace I have said all along I would have gone the other way round had I been England or Australia. I would have played Mark Wood, had he been fit, or Tongue at Edgbaston and Mitchell Starc - if I had been in charge of the Australians - to provide pace on a slow pitch. Then, at Lord's, I would have played all the seamers for England and whoever misses out for Starc on Wednesday, either Scott Boland or Josh Hazlewood. But even though there was a case to play Chris Woakes here, because of his great record at Lord's and his batting ability at No 8, England will have remembered Tongue getting a five-wicket second-innings haul against Ireland on debut here when the pitch was flat. The reason England have been winning far more than they have been losing is that they have kept their positivity. That could change if they lose here because the moment you break that chain, the fear of failure can come creeping in again. England need to win now to keep that carefree mindset in place. Go two down and not only will Bazball be doubted but they will be nailed by everyone and some in the country could turn on them. So there's a lot at stake over the next five days.

JOHN McENROE on the void left by his BBC sidekick, electronic line calls - and why he expects Andy Murray to shine at Wimbledon The three-time Wimbledon champion has worked with Barker for over 20 years McEnroe believes that Djokovic is set to win a historic 24th Grand Slam in SW19 WIMBLEDON Q&A: Is it really Djokovic's to lose? And how far can Murray go? By Mike Dickson for MailOnline Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 23:20 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail 2 View comments John McEnroe knows that summers will never be quite the same again when he takes his customary seat at Wimbledon with the BBC, with Sue Barker no longer there . Aside from anything, the onus will be more on him than ever to provide the spark for the corporation’s coverage, but he will miss her on a personal level after more than 20 years working together . ‘She was incredible at what she did. So it’s going to be a void,’ says the American legend. ‘Doing the other side, the commentary side, as long as I have, I’ve been doing it with her. She just made it easier for everyone around her. God bless her, hopefully she’ll come by and say hello. So it’s a tough act to follow.’ A new era will begin for the corporation’s flagship sports event. Clare Balding is taking the main presenting role , with the early shift being occupied by cricket expert Isa Guha. The Beeb would like to have supplemented its ranks with significant former male players of a more recent vintage. But they come with a hefty price tag and recruitment has been difficult, so McEnroe, 64, retains pride of place, especially as Boris Becker cannot return due to him being banned from the UK after his early release from prison. McEnroe can usually be relied upon for an original opinion, but even he cannot, in all conscience, see past Novak Djokovic being the strong favourite for the event this year. ‘Novak doesn’t seem to have too many problems, he’s not even bothering to play a tournament beforehand,’ says McEnroe. John McEnroe will take part in BBC's Wimbledon coverage without Sue Barker for the first time The tennis legend doesn't believe anyone will get in the way of a historic 24th victory for French Open winner Novak Djokovic He does, however, point out that the unpredictable can happen on grass, and that there are players who can lift themselves to take advantage if the Serb has an off-day, or is troubled by any physical problem. Queen’s champion Carlos Alcaraz is one. ‘This guy is going to figure it out. It’s just a matter of when to me, not if,’ says McEnroe, adding that he would love to coach him on grass. He also believes that it would be foolish to write off Djokovic’s direct contemporary Andy Murray, with his early exit at Queen’s likely to have been the result of fatigue. ‘Certainly his best chance is at Wimbledon . He understands the nuances of grass better than anyone, I put him in the top dozen players that understand what it takes to compete and do well on grass. ‘It’s going to depend on his draw (taking place on Friday). I’ve actually been pleasantly surprised by his improved movement in the last couple of years. ‘I’m sure he’s been inspired by Novak because they are the same age and he’ll see this guy, who looks like he’s 25. ‘I don’t know how Andy is even playing in the first place. I’m pulling for him to do something, he’s a Hall of Famer who has been to 11 Grand Slam finals, so I’m hoping he will be able to go out on his own terms.’ McEnroe’s fame has long since spread beyond tennis, and he has been acquiring a new following through his role as narrator of the Netflix comedy drama Never Have I Ever. As he dryly acknowledges, he would not have had so many post-playing career avenues opened to him had he not had so many blow-ups with officialdom while on the court. Therefore it is with some reluctance that he believes that, with the recent ATP ruling that all line calls on the regular tour will be made electronically by 2025 , line judges’ days are numbered at Wimbledon. But the three-time winner is adamant that Andy Murray stay in the conversation on grass McEnroe claims he would have loved to have coached world No 1 Carlos Alcaraz on the turf ‘That’s where everything’s headed. I don’t think there’s any two ways about it,’ he says. ‘There’s other ways that players can engage. It’s not just the linespeople. With (Ilie) Nastase, when they first had the Cyclops machine, I was like, “Nasty, they got Cyclops, we can’t question a call”. And he was like, “Macaroni. Don’t worry, we can figure something out. There are other things”. ‘If you have equipment that’s accurate, I’m sorry, you’ve got to go with that. Maybe I wouldn’t be talking to you now because of the antics, and maybe I would have won more but I would have been more boring. ‘But this is just the way it’s going. I will say that if you had told me at 18 that they’ve got a system where they get every call correct I would definitely have wanted that.’ John McEnroe will be part of the BBC’s commentary team on Wimbledon 2023 across TV and radio.

He has proved people wrong again and again Jonny Bairstow is just 48 runs short of an impressive landmark in English cricket The Yorkshire keeper-batter's demeanour makes him English cricket's everyman EXCLUSIVE: Sledging war continues as Jim Maxwell queries Bairstow's weight By Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail Published: 22:30, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:52, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments The landmark just up ahead for Jonny Bairstow is testament to his extraordinary powers of perseverance in cricket. A mere 48 runs in the course of the next five days will make him only the 10th English player to complete 1,000 of them at Lord's, though none of the select group has a story of survival quite like his. He has proved people wrong, again and again, and generally engaged in his best work when the doubts are most vivid. There is timelessness about the man, who has been left out and moved about the order so often that the notion of him being here, aged 33, a pillar of the new England, is an achievement against all odds. He is English cricket's everyman, too, because of that demeanour of his - always showing exactly how much it means and how much effort has been expended to deliver. On the eve of the Test, he finds himself at the centre of a different kind of warfare - Jim Maxwell's questioning of his weight, as well as his eligibility to carry the gloves into another Ashes Test. Jonny Bairstow is just 48 shy of 1,000 Test runs at Lord's - only nine have managed the feat Australia edged the tense first Test but should be wary of Bairstow in the second at Lord's There have been utterances from both Englishmen and Australians, in the past week or so, which frankly don't belong in 2023. Ollie Robinson's F-bombing Usman Khawaja was one of them. But Maxwell's was the more objectionable. Immeasurably so. That will have registered. There is certainly an insecurity behind that swashbuckling style - perhaps understandable in a man who has fought his way back into consideration so often. But Brendon McCullum seems to have unlocked more in him than any other England player. Bairstow's beautiful 2018 autobiography was titled A Clear Blue Sky - the story of a man hoping to find one - and the blue-sky thinking provided by McCullum and Ben Stokes has transformed him more than most. He will be a very dangerous individual in the days ahead. Several years ago, Bairstow approached sports psychologist David Priestley to sort out his mental approach to batting, though it was evidently not a long conversation. Priestley asked Bairstow to write down the basic principles of his batting. He wrote: 'See the ball, hit the ball, dominate, keep it simple'. Priestly read it, pushed it back, and said: 'That's your blueprint. Use it.' Bairstow laminated the paper and carried it in his kitbag. Australian commentator Jim Maxwell (right) branded Bairstow 'overweight' ahead of the second Ashes Test He has worn his Ashes experiences on his sleeve in a way which has left those of us who have tracked his rollercoaster Test career feeling like we have been right there alongside him. The celebration of his ninth Test century in the middle of the Sydney Cricket Ground, 18 months ago, will live long in the memory - Bairstow absorbing 105 balls in the final day of a fourth Test, guaranteeing a draw that ensured there would be no Ashes whitewash. His response was 'equal parts relief and told-you-so', one observer wrote that day. Nasser Hussain once described Bairstow as a 'street-fighting, over-my-dead-body' cricketer. He has more incentive than ever to take that game to Australia now.

BUMBLE'S GUIDE TO LORD'S ahead of second Ashes Test I never miss the stampede at Lord's as they open the gates for the members If the second Ashes Test is anything like Birmingham then we're in for a treat After impressing against Ireland, Josh Tongue has was a 'dream' Ashes nod By David Lloyd For The Daily Mail Published: 22:31, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:39, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments I never miss getting to Lord’s at 9am in the morning and seeing the massive queues snaking around the ground, waiting for the gunfire! Because when they open the gates for the members, it is an absolute stampede! What an occasion. It reminds me of the Grand National and I find it hilarious seeing some of the elder members of the cricketing community charging to get the best seats possible for the day. But once you’re inside, this is one of the more sedate grounds in the country — full of respect and nostalgia. And unlike Edgbaston, this is a proper posh day out. We’re down in the ‘Big Smoke’ where you can get a pint of bitter for £6.50 and it’s the exact same product as you get up north for four quid! Mail Sport's David 'Bumble' Lloyd described Lord's as 'a proper posh day out' ahead of the second Test Australia come into the clash 1-0 up in the series after a thrilling win at Edgbaston last week It’s that flat you could serve it in an envelope! But down here, you’re spoilt for choice for things to do and as a great people-watcher, Primrose Hill is a personal favourite. The Queens pub over there is one I’ve been visiting for years and despite the claims of one of their staffers that Liam Gallagher is a frequent visitor, I must admit I’ve never bumped into him. I will be making my annual trip to Soho to visit The French House which is one of the great watering holes renowned for its clientele and iconic of course, for their no mobile phones rule! You’re politely asked to go outside if you want to use yours. But there’s no pint pots in there — just halves! And it’s widely reputed that Peter Ustinov on a particularly thirsty day somersaulted through an open window there and caused a multi-car pile-up! As a lover of hats, I’ll most certainly be paying a visit to Camden Market too. Food-wise, celebrity chef Tommy Banks heads up the Edrich restaurant at Lord’s and that’s on my list too, among all the other options in the capital. It’ll be some week. But to the cricket and if it’s anything like Birmingham, we are in for a treat. England were not happy with that pitch and will be hoping this one is more responsive. Jimmy Anderson’s comments describing it like ‘Kryptonite’ for his bowling style were worrying and physically, this will be a big ask for him. Because if you’re Ben Stokes, you have to use Jimmy at Headingley and Old Trafford. Sometimes it’s tough on groundsmen because of the dry weather but with a fair amount of rain knocking about, they’ll be hoping that the square itself retains some moisture so the ball can move around off the surface. It looks like we’re getting a green seamer and with the slope here, there’ll be enough variations to work with but to go without Mark Wood is a big call from England. They’ve gone for Josh Tongue and that is a different proposition in itself. The difference is about three inches in height and he will hit the pitch hard but crucially he offers something different from last week. They must like him and you can mark my words that the Aussie players will be badgering their analyst about Tongue. Jimmy Anderson will likely be needed at both Headingley and Old Trafford later in the series Josh Tongue will hit the pitch hard but crucially he offers something different from last week in his express pace Moeen Ali's omission is another gutsy call and leaves England with not much batting after Jonny Bairstow Leaving out Moeen Ali is another gutsy call and leaves England with not much batting after Jonny Bairstow. The talk before the series was that Australia had a long tail but Pat Cummins won the game for them. Can any of our tail match Cummins’ effort? Australia would have been cock-a-hoop after winning at Edgbaston and you have to remember that opposition teams always seem to find an extra 10 per cent playing at Lord’s. Because it’s so special and it’s the home of cricket and they will thrive off that. It won’t be anywhere near as raucous at Edgbaston. It will be very much sedate, like I said earlier and perhaps a little bit upper class with a lot of decorum! You won’t find anyone here dressed up as Darth Vader, Robin Hood or a bevy of Butchers! England have to come back strongly. They missed chances and were sloppy with no-balls. 23 to four. That’s a huge difference! They need to get up to speed and there’s no better place to do so.

England skipper inspired by Zak Crawley's Far Eastern proverb to crack on with all-out attack in must-win Lord's Test England captain Ben Stokes says a Chinese proverb has inspired them to attack He said Zak Crawley's tale has given him confidence his team are not out of luck Stokes feels the team are in good spirits ahead of second Test vs Australia By Paul Newman for the Daily Mail Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:38 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments When Ben Stokes starts talking about Chinese farmers you know this Ashes series has taken an unexpected twist. This was not a second Test call-up at Lord’s even more surprising than Josh Tongue replacing Moeen Ali, but simply a way for the England captain to insist his best-laid pace bowling plans had not gone awry. First Jofra Archer and Olly Stone were ruled out, now Mark Wood is not fit enough to give England that all-important extra speed Stokes insisted was at the heart of his Ashes game plan when he told Nasser Hussain he wanted ‘flat and fast wickets’. So in comes Tongue, the nearest thing England have now to a bowler of express pace, for a Test of utmost importance and Stokes has to turn to Zak Crawley and his story about a Chinese farmer to shoot down the suggestion his side have run out of luck. ‘Brendon (McCullum) always goes round the group before he hands over to me to speak,’ said Stokes (right) at Lord’s yesterday. ‘This time Zak actually said, “I’ve got something to say” and he made an unbelievable speech in the huddle. Ben Stokes has revealed how a Chinese proverb has inspired England to continue attacking Australia in the second Ashes Test The England captain said Zak Crawley led a team meeting and stunned them with a story about a Chinese farmer who says, 'We’ll see if it’s good or bad' after their defeat to the Aussies ‘It was a story of a Chinese farmer who basically says, “We’ll see if it’s good or bad”, whenever something happens. That it’s never the end of the world. We don’t know why things happen, if it’s for good or not. It’s just something else to deal with. ‘So I’m very confident the team we’ve picked can walk away from here with a win. Rather than worry about what I don’t have, I’d rather be happy with what I do have.’ England’s Ashes hopes depend on it. Lose here and it is virtually all over. England’s men and women have played two classic Tests in the last fortnight, but the bottom line is Australia have won both of them and now it is crunch time. One more defeat and both the ‘Mashes’ and the ‘Washes’, as some are calling the two series, will be all but lost. Not that England are thinking that way. Stokes and his ‘s*** happens’ philosophy was totally in keeping with England’s relaxed mood at Lord’s yesterday. Nothing that happened at Edgbaston and since that nail- biting and narrow defeat has shaken their belief that Bazball is here to stay and, crucially, gives them their best chance of levelling this Ashes now. ‘Baz has just about come to terms that it’s a thing now, but he still hates it,’ smiled Stokes when asked about the label for England’s expansive, thrilling style. ‘But it’s been nice that lots of people have come up to me saying how much they were enthralled by the first Test. Stokes said he had been buoyed by plaudits of England's style - introduced by head coach Brendon McCullum (right) SO, WHAT IS CRAWLEY'S STORY? A Chinese story of unknown origin tells of a farmer who used a horse in his fields. One day, the horse escaped into the hills and, when the farmer’s neighbours sympathised with the old man over his bad luck, he replied: ‘Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?’ A week later, the escaped horse returned with a herd of wild horses from the hills, and the neighbours congratulated the farmer on his good luck. He replied: ‘Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows?’ Then, when the farmer’s son was attempting to tame one of the wild horses, he fell off its back and broke a leg. Everyone again sympathised with the farmer over his bad luck. The farmer said: ‘Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?’ Some weeks later, the army marched into the village and drafted every able-bodied youth they found. When they saw the farmer’s son with his broken leg, they let him stay. Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows? <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/nl/sport/cricket/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement ‘I had a conversation in a men’s changing room at a spa which was a bit awkward.

I was like, “It’s me”. ‘So he said he doesn’t follow the game but went down the pub for a quick few on the last day of the first Test and ended up having a few more because he was transfixed watching the game. When you hear that, it makes you feel good.’ Stokes has often said this England squad are not results driven, but there was a subtle change of emphasis yesterday when he talked about the importance of winning this Ashes. ‘I don’t want to be misunderstood about that,’ he said. ‘We want to win every game. Losing sucks. But if we don’t win we’ll just keep doing what we’re doing and move on to the next game.’ To that end, Wood’s lack of confidence in his ability to get through this Test is a concern. Stokes may have said another week should mean he is available for the third Test at Headingley and beyond, but Wood remains a fragile part of this England team. Tongue was impressive on debut against Ireland, but this is a big step up and his inclusion in a four-seamer attack is not just a reflection of England’s concerns over Moeen Ali’s sore finger but on the condition of Stokes’ knee. The captain talked of his ‘confidence boost’ in being able to bowl at Edgbaston, but if he was sure he could perform the fourth seamer role properly then a specialist spinner would surely have been included, as one has been for all 14 Tests that Stokes has captained. The absence of Moeen, who had been declared fit, and Rehan Ahmed is also partly down to a very green Lord’s pitch and clearly, after the sub-continental surface at Edgbaston, England’s groundsmen have not listened to the captain’s pre-series plea for pace. ‘I’m not going to go there to say how easy or hard it is to prepare pitches,’ said Stokes diplomatically. ‘It’s a tough job and we have to respond to how the wicket presents itself. We’ve not bowled a ball on this one yet. Let’s have that conversation after the game.’ England are confident they can turn things around against Australia after losing the first Test One thing for certain is Australia will not leave out their spinner. Nathan Lyon goes into the second Test having become the first one to ever play 100 consecutive Tests and stands just five short of 500 wickets. Lyon remains a huge threat but so too is Joe Root, with the only surprise about his selection as spinner, as well as best batsman, being that England seem to have only just realised how good he can be with the ball. After all, he did once take five for eight against India, albeit on a very different pitch to the one that awaits today. There has been a lot of Aussie Ashes absurdity since Edgbaston, from Matthew Hayden’s attack on Ollie Robinson for daring to give Usman Khawaja a minor send-off, to the most ridiculous of all, Test Match Special commentator Jim Maxwell fat-shaming Jonny Bairstow in Mail Sport yesterday. But, significantly, none of it has come from the Australia team. Thank goodness we can now get on with the cricket again. The second Test should, weather permitting, be another classic. And England cannot afford to lose it.

No, Jonny Bairstow's fit and robust. He was always my first pick behind the stumps at Yorkshire Jonny Bairstow made a run a ball 78 alongside Joe Root in the Edgbaston Test The Yorkshire keeper-batter has recently returned from a freak broken leg EXCLUSIVE: Sledging war continues as Jim Maxwell queries Bairstow's weight By Jason Gillespie For The Daily Mail Published: 22:30 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 22:36 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail View comments Jonny Bairstow’s wicketkeeping and fitness have come in for some hefty criticism from some of the Australian media and the bare fact is that if you are a player who hasn’t performed it goes with the territory. Jonny's batting in the first Ashes Test , when he struck a run-a-ball 78 alongside Joe Root after England had been in a bit of a tricky spot, was excellent. And that's what the England team value in him - the ability to make strong, aggressive contributions with the bat. But I'm sure that Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes will have said to him heading into Lord's : ‘Look, we need more from you with the gloves.’ He needs to make sure he keeps chipping away, working on his drills because wicketkeepers need repetition. Jonny Bairstow's fitness and wicket-keeping were brought into question after Edgbaston Test Jason Gillespie was a former Head Coach of Yorkshire - Bairstow's county side since 2009 In cricket coaching, we talk about batters and bowlers taking daily vitamins — regular technical work — to keep themselves topped up, and the same is true for Jonny and his keeping. He just needs to make sure his vitamins are up in terms of his routines and preparation. He will have been looking to improve his footwork this week. Mention has been made of his weight but that is not something I’ve noticed. In my experience, he has always been a fit and robust cricketer. When I was Yorkshire head coach, he loved going for big runs around the streets as his preferred way of keeping in good nick and the recent broken leg might have affected his ability to do that. He really embraced road running because he always felt it strengthened his legs, contrary to the opinion it’s no good for knees. As for my time with him at Headingley, well, he was always my first pick behind the stumps. I arrived in 2012 and Jonny and Gerard Brophy were vying for the gloves. A lot of people at the club felt that Brophy was the better keeper. However, I was having none of that because I just felt that Jonny could change the course of the game and that, while his keeping was not the very best going around, it was solid. Australian commentator Jim Maxwell (right) branded Bairstow 'overweight' ahead of the second Ashes Test Bairstow (L) has been given the wicketkeeping gloves ahead of Ben Foakes (R) for the start of the series In fact, he is more than serviceable at international level, and much better than he showed at Edgbaston. I’ve always been of the belief that Jonny is a better cricketer when he has a second suit to focus on, and if you put all the eggs in the batting basket you don’t get as much out of him. Later, we recruited Andrew Hodd from Sussex, one of the best keepers in the country at the time and although we felt he was superior to Jonny with the gloves, it was really difficult to ignore someone like a Jonny Bairstow who changes games with the bat. Essentially, as a wicketkeeper you want to be invisible. Really good ones don’t get noticed. Look at Alex Carey, his opposite number in this Ashes. No one mentioned him last week because he was slick, sharp, and clean, getting the job done quietly and efficiently. Whereas, as Jonny discovered, wasted opportunities behind the stumps get magnified and replayed over and over and over again. If you miss a catch or stumping, the spotlight is on you and so you’ve got to try and find a way to minimise that. He did take a really good catch low to his right to dismiss Marnus Labuschagne off Stuart Broad but he’s still developing his fitness, coming back from quite a serious injury. Building that back up will just take some time. What does interest me, as an Australian looking into county cricket these days, is that everyone talks about Ben Foakes as his rival. Yes, he’s a wonderful player but I am going to throw another name in there in Ollie Robinson at Durham. Bairstow took a brilliant diving catch low to his right to dismiss Marnus Labuschagne in the first Test Durham's Ollie Robinson scored a big hundred in the County Championship to go top of the leading run-scorer list in Division Two I was very keen on getting him across to Sussex a few years ago because he’s a very good cricketer: an elite wicketkeeper, a fantastic batsman and a wonderful kid. It wouldn’t shock me if his name was to be mentioned regularly by the England management and selectors going forward. Robinson got a big hundred in this round of Championship matches — hitting 167 not out against Leicestershire. As I say, I’ve been a big fan of his for years. Plus, I also want to see caught Ollie Robinson, bowled Ollie Robinson on an international scorecard. That would be hilarious! Share or comment on this article: JASON GILLESPIE: Overweight?

The 32-year-old was horrified to hear the conclusions of the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket and said: ‘To the people involved in the game who have been made to feel unwelcome or unaccepted in the past, I am deeply sorry to hear of your experiences. Cricket is a game that needs to celebrate diversity on all fronts. We need to learn from past mistakes and do all we can to make people feel safe. ‘I have been an England player since 2011 and I feel very fortunate to have been a part of some incredibly diverse teams. We must be more inclusive and diverse because the game I love should be enjoyed without fear of discrimination or judgment. ‘I am Ben Stokes, born in New Zealand, a state-educated pupil who dropped out at 16 with one GCSE in P.E. I need help with the spelling and grammar in this speech and I am sitting here as the England men’s Test captain. ‘There’s so much more the game has to do. As players, we want to ensure this is truly a sport for everyone.’ England captain Ben Stokes insists cricket must be a game for everyone after a damning report about discrimination in the sport The revelations - which claimed sexism, racism and elitism were widespread in cricket - came days before the second Ashes Test gets underway at Lord's The ECB are set to escape the threat of outside regulation despite the damning conclusions of the report. There is no appetite in Government to get involved in regulating cricket — which will be a setback to the Commission, who have called for the ECB to be stripped of regulatory powers as one of 44 recommendations for change. It came as Yorkshire look set for a £500,000 fine and record points deduction that would condemn them to finishing bottom of the Second Division this season after admitting to four ECB racism charges. At a sanctions hearing on Tuesday ECB lawyers demanded deductions of between 48 and 72 points in the Championship, as well as four to six points in the T20 Blast and One Day Cup. It would effectively end their sporting season, while the fine could put the very survival of the club in jeopardy. The charges relate to mishandling the Azeem Rafiq case, the deletion of documents related to it and a failure to address the use of racist language at the club over a prolonged period. The findings were on the back of accusations made by former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq Share or comment on this article: Ben Stokes insists cricket must be a game that 'celebrates diversity on all fronts' e-mail 5 shares Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

They are only interested in squeezing more cash out of the club The delay to Man United's takeover feels like an act of vengeance to supporters United have been left with no brand or substance under the Glazers Fans protested against them on Tuesday as the club's sale continues to drag on By Ian Herbert for MailOnline Published: 18:00 BST, 27 June 2023 | Updated: 21:40 BST, 27 June 2023 e-mail 103 shares 282 View comments It was a hot, lazy June lunchtime and most of the world was taking a momentary pause from football, yet there was the face of Manchester City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak, on a TV screen, delivering his thoughts on what happens next. 'Today I'm speaking to you but I'm already thinking about next year,' he said, at the top of the news bulletin during an Ashes lunch break last week. 'We're always in growth mode. We're never in contentment and pause. We're never, \"Let's just milk the asset\".' This hardly needed pointing out. The summer transfer window is entering its third week and there's already been a Manchester City deal for Mateo Kovacic and a Manchester City drive to buy RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and a £90million Manchester City bid for Declan Rice . These are the hallmarks of owners with an obsessive intent to make their club better. The same can be said of Liverpool 's Fenway Sports Group, with Alexis Mac Allister through the Anfield door for a mere £35million. But over at Manchester United it's Groundhog Day. New transfer window, same old confusion. All brand, no substance. A club living in some vague hope that their hallowed name will eventually get them some players in, after their traditional midsummer game of whack-a-mole in the market. Avram and Joel Glazer are seemingly only interested in squeezing a few more million out of Manchester United United fans blocked the entrance to the megastore on Tuesday to coincide with the launch of the new kit as the club's takeover drags on Signing a quality striker was the obvious priority for United when the summer started but they made their first move for… a midfielder.. They went mid-range, for Mason Mount, because they are up to their eyes in wage payments and their own vast revenues can no longer insulate them from the risk of a spending breach. Mail Sport's Ian Herbert has questioned the motives of the Glazer family during the sale process of Manchester United But wait. They have suddenly tacked to Moises Caicedo, a different type of player and price bracket. And they're also looking at goalkeeper Andre Onana. So, where's the money for that quality striker, with a total budget of £140million? No-one knows. United have set values on many players they want to clear out and there is actually a suggestion that West Ham will take £40m plus a few of those makeweights, for Rice. Other clubs just laugh. If United had proprietors who were ruthlessly focused on the executive oversight of their club, as City and Liverpool's owners are, then Erik ten Hag might have a fully-assembled new squad for the return to training on July 9. He won't. United are, of course, marooned with football’s ultimate speculators - the Glazers. A family interested only in how they can squeeze more cash from the club, not how to keep up in a relentless competitive, strategic elite sports environment. Man City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (pictured lifting the Champions League trophy in Istanbul) has shown the obsession and desire needed to run an elite sports team Dragging out the sale of the club feels like an act of vengeance by the Glazers towards fans Custodians with an ounce of care for one of our country’s greatest sporting institutions would also see that Old Trafford is an aged, careworn place, now, desperately needing renewal. A shadow of Arsenal’s and Tottenham’s modern arenas. The lazy, semi-detached sloth of these chancers is more of a disgrace than ever this summer, given that they have their noses in the trough which has sustained them for so long - dragging out the interminable sale of United for a few million dollars more, to a point when the April deadline in that process long since became somewhere between an illusion and a practical joke. That prospective sale, to either Sheik Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani or Sir Jim Ratcliffe, belonged to the usual pre-summer optimism around United. The £5-6billion disposal would make the club the world’s most expensive. But, of course, it’s been torture - leaving the club in a state of limbo, top to bottom, with jobs, structures and to an extent even transfer strategy, uncertain - at a time when optimal clarity is needed. Meanwhile, the club’s latest financial results on Tuesday showed that borrowings from a revolving credit facility have almost doubled, to £203.7m, in a year. The US trading website Benzinga reported on Tuesday that Sheik Jassim is ahead of Ratcliffe in the race but without the remotest transparency or communication, Wall Street whispers are all United fans have to go on. There are doubts whether the sale of the club will be concluded before the window closes, let alone when the season starts. British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe (left) and Qatari Sheikh Jassim (right) are the two front-runners in the process. The fact the initial deadline was April has become a practical joke It all feels like the ultimate act of Glazer vengeance on a fanbase which manifestly detests them. United’s tendency to overpay for incoming players has obscured another chronic deficiency: their struggle to sell well. Highly rated midfield prospect Zidane Iqbal has just gone to Utrecht for a mere £800,000. But the only sale that currently matters is the one that will rescue this benighted club from the hands of those who have bled it dry for so long. Al Mubarak’s observations about not ‘milking the asset’ were no coincidence amid the drawn-out annexation of Manchester United. It was manifestly clear which club’s owners he was talking about. BEAUMONT AND CO DESERVE MORE TESTS The images my daughter sent me from Trent Bridge on Saturday told their own story of what her first day watching Test cricket, seeing Tammy Beaumont make history, meant to her. Women's cricket is making sure and steady progress but why is there only one women's Ashes Test this summer? It feels like there is the appetite for more. A DEFENSIVE ENGLAND IS NOT BLASPHEMY The England Test team's proclivity to attack at all costs has become such an article of faith that to put the case for a modicum of defence seems to have become a blasphemy. As if the two are mutually exclusive. Absolute nonsense, of course. Nasser Hussain's compelling interview with Kevin Pietersen in these pages on Saturday was a reminder, from a player you wouldn't exactly call a wall flower, that there is something that matters more than creeds and philosophies in sport. It's called winning. 'My issue is that it is an Ashes series,' Pietersen told Hussain. 'If we were playing against New Zealand or South Africa or India, it doesn't mean as much to the fan as an Ashes series.' It should be acceptable to demand a more defensive display from England after Zak Crawley boldly predicted his side would beat Australia by 150 runs in the second Test No-one's listening, though, because the bombast seems to have permeated all areas of the England realm. After defeat at Edgbaston, we were treated to this from Zak Crawley: 'We'll win the second Test. It will suit us a bit more, that Lord's pitch. So I'm confident we'll win by… I don't know, 150 runs?' If a player in the England football team had declared, ahead of a match against Germany or France, that the side would win 'I don't know, 3-0?', it's safe to assume Gareth Southgate would have taken him into a side room and robustly offered the benefit of his opinion about giving the opposition extra motivation. No-one blinked an eye at Crawley's crass pronouncement. That's the current England for you — so wrapped up in their own methodology that humility and self-effacement seem to have gone out the window. 'This England team are not about winning or losing, we're about entertainment,' Crawley concluded, contributing to the nonsensical orthodoxy that the urn is a mere incidental detail this summer.

The schedule for CWC 2023 was announced on Tuesday. Arch-rivals India and Pakistan will square off at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 this October at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The opening game of the World Cup is scheduled to place at the same venue on October 5 with a match between defending champions England and New Zealand in Ahmedabad, the ICC announced on Tuesday. “Preparations have started. We started preparations after IPL for the World Cup. We are renovating the stadium, corporate boxes. Ground conditions are excellent. Preparations will start from July 1 for the ground. We had a meeting with our curator. Eden Gardens is ready to host the World Cup. There are some patches here and there, within the next two months, we will resolve all those issues,” said Ganguly to ANI. On the WC schedule, Ganguly expressed his satisfaction, saying that they got “what we expected, what we wished for.” “We tried that we get a semifinal match this time and at the last moment, we got a semifinal match at Eden,” he said. Kolkata will host Qualifier 1 vs Bangladesh on October 28, Pakistan vs Bangladesh on October 31, India vs South Africa on November 5, England vs Pakistan on November 12 and the second semifinal on November 16. “Everyone’s first choice will be an India vs Pakistan semifinal at Eden Gardens, it would be a dream match,” he added. On the pitch, Ganguly said that the staff will go for a sporting wicket, which offers high-scoring contests and helps both bowlers and batters. “In IPL, everyone enjoyed the match since they were high scoring and the wicket condition was good. We will try maintaining it,” he added. Ganguly said that a decision on tickets price will be taken in the next couple of days. “We expect the crowd to come, we have a capacity of 65,000. Keeping this in mind, we will have a reasonable price,” he added. Lastly, he urged fans to come to the stadium to watch the matches or at least enjoy them live on TV. Ganguly said that the matches will be done smoothly with proper security for all during the Durga Puja days, which will take place during the duration of the tournament. “Last time also during international matches, Kolkata police managed this festival and an international match well. They cooperated with us. We are confident that matches will be carried out in a big way, with proper security and safety,” he said. Ahmedabad will host the tournament opener as well as the final. The other venues are Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Dharamsala, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune. Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram join Hyderabad in hosting the practice matches. Eight teams have qualified for the 46-day event through the Cricket World Cup Super League while the final two spots will be taken by the finalists of the World Cup Qualifier taking place in Zimbabwe. The tournament retains the round-robin format of last time with all teams playing against each other for a total of 45 league matches. The top four teams will qualify for the semi-finals to be played in Mumbai on 15 November and in Kolkata on 16 November. The semi-finals and the final will have reserve days.
