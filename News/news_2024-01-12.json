This will be Nagal's second main draw appearance at the Australian Open, first in three years, and fourth overall at a Grand Slam tournament. Sumit Nagal is through to 2024 Australian Open main draw Nagal, ranked 139th in the world, made the statement clear early on as he broke Molcan in his opening service game to race away to a 3-0 lead in the first set before his 26-year-old opponent broke back to level the score at 3-3 as the Indian lost his rhythm, registering 17 unforced errors in the first six games. Nagal, however, held his nerves to emerge on top in the second break point opportunity he grabbed in the 10th game as he won the opening set 6-4 in 51 minutes.

Click here Nagal stayed toe-to-toe with Molcan, who received treatment for a shoulder discomfort during the break, in the second set before breaking first in the eighth game, on his third break point opportunity in the set. However, the 26-year-old Indian showed signs of an injury concern on his hip as he called for a medical time-out and the discomfort came in his way of serving out the match. But he quickly recovered to secure a break back as Nagal wrapped up the match to win the final round of men's qualification match.

With Fisher’s 2018 anthem ‘Losing It’ blaring from the venue’s speakers, Warner and wife Candice descended onto the hallowed surface with hundreds of onlookers watching on, mostly comprised of media and Cricket NSW staff. He waved at a small group of fans in the MA Noble Stand before retiring to the sheds ahead of the Sydney Smash. Watch every match of the BBL season live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > The helicopter landed in front of the iconic Members’ Stand on the same patch of grass that displayed a painted message of ‘Thanks Dave’ during last week’s New Tear’s Test match against Pakistan. It was hoped Warner would emerge from the aircraft donning a tuxedo, James Bond style, but instead he wore Sydney Thunder kit. “He is a bit Hollywood, isn’t he? It is very Davey,” Sydney Sixers seamer Sean Abbott laughed while chatting to reporters on Thursday. “I got the Lime bike in today and I’ll be doing the same tomorrow night. So I’ll be riding out the gate there as Davey lands.” Warner had boarded the helicopter at Cessnock Airport just over 45 minutes earlier, having raced across from his brother’s wedding in the Hunter Valley. The 37-year-old left after the ceremony to ensure he could participate in Friday evening’s Big Bash League derby between the Sixers and Thunder at the SCG, which looms as a potential sellout. “If I missed my brother’s wedding, he would probably … jab me in the jaw a few times,” Abbott joked. Initially, Cricket NSW and Venues NSW were negotiating whether Warner’s helicopter could touch down at next door’s Allianz Stadium, but the plan was ultimately scrapped. “I’m glad they’re making it happen because I think everyone in the country who is a fan of cricket wants to see David Warner playing in the BBL,” Abbott continued. “I’m really looking forward to coming up against one of the best players in the world. He has been for a long time.” Warner plans for wild Thunder entrance | 01:11 Friday’s derby will be the first of Warner’s three Big Bash appearances this summer, unless the Thunder somehow qualify for the finals series, which at this stage is only a mathematical possibility. After Wednesday’s group-stage match against the Melbourne Renegades at Sydney Showground, the veteran opener will fly to the United Arab Emirates for a stint with the Dubai Capitals in the International League T20. Earlier this week, chief selector George Bailey confirmed Warner would then return home in February for the bilateral T20 series against the West Indies, missing the ILT20 finals campaign. Warner, in the final year of his two-season deal with the Thunder, compiled 99 runs in six knocks at 19.80 during last summer’s Big Bash with an underwhelming strike rate of 108.79. “He’s going to a lot of effort to come and play,” Thunder bowler Gurinder Sandhu told reporters on Wednesday. “We love having him here. Last year he was awesome for us. “He maybe didn’t score as many runs as he would have liked but he was awesome around the group and was passing on information. “I think he’s one of the better team men that we have in Cricket Australia and now all the fans get to enjoy him playing cricket. “Hopefully, he can put his best foot forward and score a hundred like he did in BBL01 playing for the Thunder. “Plus with his energy out in the field, it’ll be awesome having him out there.” The Sydney Smash, which will also feature Australian superstar Steve Smith, gets underway at the SCG on Friday at 7.15pm AEDT.","pubDate":"2024-01-12 06:09:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/34367cc5e0853dfaf5a386457f164161","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"73a65712cb5b09e9091acddf08891412","title":"Andy Murray gears up for 2024 Australian Open, opens up on 'mental side' of tennis ahead of opener","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/tennis/andy-murray-gears-up-for-2024-australian-open-opens-up-on-mental-side-of-tennis-ahead-of-opener-101705039127202.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Andy Murray opened up on his preparations for the upcoming 2024 Australian Open.","content":"Ahead of his 16th appearance at the Australian Open, Andy Murray will be looking to make an impact and challenge for the title.

Ahead of the New Year’s Test David Warner took to social media as “a last resort” after his baggy green went missing between Melbourne and Sydney with the belief being the backpack had been stolen. “Inside this backpack was my baggy green. It’s sentimental to me. It’s something I’d love to have in my hands walking out there this week,” he said. “If it’s the backpack you really wanted, I have a spare one here. You won’t get into trouble, “Please reach out to Cricket Australia or myself via my social media. I’m happy to give this to you if you return my baggy greens.” However, during day 2 of the Test the backpack with the caps reappeared reportedly in the hotel lobby but with few details released some questioned if Warner had really lost them at all. It was a subject Sunrise hosts Monique Wright and Matt Doran couldn’t help to try and get to the bottom of when Candice Warner appeared on the show with her daughters to promote a beach safety campaign. “Gosh, it was exciting last week as we were following David’s last week. Of course, a bittersweet week,” Wright said. “Then we rode the wave of emotion about the missy Baggy Greens. I could only imagine what was happening for you Candice. What happened to those Baggy Greens?” Candice took a brief pause before tip-toeing around the subject of the missing baggy greens. “It’s always busy in our household, especially the last week. It was an unbelievable week. A week of reflection and just celebration for us,” she said. “That is a question for security management. At the end of the day he got his Baggy Greens back and that is the main thing.” Not wanting to left Candice off the hook that easy Doran tried to get some more information but Warner once again presented a straight bat. “Oh Candice, you’ve got to forgive me probing a little bit more. Australia is captivated by this mystery, can you give us any sense of what went on?” he asked “Again, like I said, that is up to management and stuff like that. But we are here today for Nutri Grain and for Surf Life Saving Australia and the girls cannot wait for this weekend’s racing at Maroubra Beach.” Warner is expected to be in action at the Big Bash tonight chartering in a helicopter to fly-in from his brother’s wedding.","pubDate":"2024-01-12 05:49:58","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-13197446/a8c9637596111ebb8d1993009acd9e6c4ddd0e91-16x9-x0y313w6000h3375.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"32fc3befb824e7701ebb612595d4bdcf","title":"NZ vs PAK: COVID-19 hits New Zealand's team as Mitchell Santner ruled out of first T20I","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/12-Jan-2024/nz-vs-pak-covid-19-hits-new-zealand-s-team-as-mitchell-santner-ruled-out-of-first-t20i","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["Web Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand’s star all-rounder Mitchell Santner has been ruled out of the first T20I against Pakistan after testing positive for Covid-19.","content":"New Zealand’s star all-rounder Mitchell Santner has been ruled out of the first T20I against Pakistan after testing positive for Covid-19. “Mitchell Santner won’t travel to Eden Park this evening for the opening KFC T20I against Pakistan after testing positive for COVID earlier today.

This will be Nagal's second main draw appearance at the Australian Open, first in three years, and fourth overall at a Grand Slam tournament. Sumit Nagal is through to 2024 Australian Open main draw Nagal, ranked 139th in the world, made the statement clear early on as he broke Molcan in his opening service game to race away to a 3-0 lead in the first set before his 26-year-old opponent broke back to level the score at 3-3 as the Indian lost his rhythm, registering 17 unforced errors in the first six games. Nagal, however, held his nerves to emerge on top in the second break point opportunity he grabbed in the 10th game as he won the opening set 6-4 in 51 minutes.

Click here Nagal stayed toe-to-toe with Molcan, who received treatment for a shoulder discomfort during the break, in the second set before breaking first in the eighth game, on his third break point opportunity in the set. However, the 26-year-old Indian showed signs of an injury concern on his hip as he called for a medical time-out and the discomfort came in his way of serving out the match. But he quickly recovered to secure a break back as Nagal wrapped up the match to win the final round of men's qualification match.

With Fisher’s 2018 anthem ‘Losing It’ blaring from the venue’s speakers, Warner and wife Candice descended onto the hallowed surface with hundreds of onlookers watching on, mostly comprised of media and Cricket NSW staff. He waved at a small group of fans in the MA Noble Stand before retiring to the sheds ahead of the Sydney Smash. Watch every match of the BBL season live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > The helicopter landed in front of the iconic Members’ Stand on the same patch of grass that displayed a painted message of ‘Thanks Dave’ during last week’s New Tear’s Test match against Pakistan. It was hoped Warner would emerge from the aircraft donning a tuxedo, James Bond style, but instead he wore Sydney Thunder kit. “He is a bit Hollywood, isn’t he? It is very Davey,” Sydney Sixers seamer Sean Abbott laughed while chatting to reporters on Thursday. “I got the Lime bike in today and I’ll be doing the same tomorrow night. So I’ll be riding out the gate there as Davey lands.” Warner had boarded the helicopter at Cessnock Airport just over 45 minutes earlier, having raced across from his brother’s wedding in the Hunter Valley. The 37-year-old left after the ceremony to ensure he could participate in Friday evening’s Big Bash League derby between the Sixers and Thunder at the SCG, which looms as a potential sellout. “If I missed my brother’s wedding, he would probably … jab me in the jaw a few times,” Abbott joked. Initially, Cricket NSW and Venues NSW were negotiating whether Warner’s helicopter could touch down at next door’s Allianz Stadium, but the plan was ultimately scrapped. “I’m glad they’re making it happen because I think everyone in the country who is a fan of cricket wants to see David Warner playing in the BBL,” Abbott continued. “I’m really looking forward to coming up against one of the best players in the world. He has been for a long time.” Warner plans for wild Thunder entrance | 01:11 Friday’s derby will be the first of Warner’s three Big Bash appearances this summer, unless the Thunder somehow qualify for the finals series, which at this stage is only a mathematical possibility. After Wednesday’s group-stage match against the Melbourne Renegades at Sydney Showground, the veteran opener will fly to the United Arab Emirates for a stint with the Dubai Capitals in the International League T20. Earlier this week, chief selector George Bailey confirmed Warner would then return home in February for the bilateral T20 series against the West Indies, missing the ILT20 finals campaign. Warner, in the final year of his two-season deal with the Thunder, compiled 99 runs in six knocks at 19.80 during last summer’s Big Bash with an underwhelming strike rate of 108.79. “He’s going to a lot of effort to come and play,” Thunder bowler Gurinder Sandhu told reporters on Wednesday. “We love having him here. Last year he was awesome for us. “He maybe didn’t score as many runs as he would have liked but he was awesome around the group and was passing on information. “I think he’s one of the better team men that we have in Cricket Australia and now all the fans get to enjoy him playing cricket. “Hopefully, he can put his best foot forward and score a hundred like he did in BBL01 playing for the Thunder. “Plus with his energy out in the field, it’ll be awesome having him out there.” The Sydney Smash, which will also feature Australian superstar Steve Smith, gets underway at the SCG on Friday at 7.15pm AEDT.","pubDate":"2024-01-12 06:09:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/34367cc5e0853dfaf5a386457f164161","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"73a65712cb5b09e9091acddf08891412","title":"Andy Murray gears up for 2024 Australian Open, opens up on 'mental side' of tennis ahead of opener","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/tennis/andy-murray-gears-up-for-2024-australian-open-opens-up-on-mental-side-of-tennis-ahead-of-opener-101705039127202.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Andy Murray opened up on his preparations for the upcoming 2024 Australian Open.","content":"Ahead of his 16th appearance at the Australian Open, Andy Murray will be looking to make an impact and challenge for the title.

AP Celebrations around David Warner’s farewell from Test cricket will continue as the flamboyant opener will arrive at the iconic SCG by a helicopter to play in a Big Bash League (BBL) match for Sydney Thunders. Flying in straight from his brother’s wedding in the Hunter Valley, the 37-year-old’s chopper will touch down on the outfield near the ‘Thanks Dave’ logo, which was painted for his last Test. “He’s going to take a lot of effort to come and play for us,” Thunder quick Gurinder Sandhu was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo . Warner pulled the curtains down on a glorious Test career in front of his home crowd at the SCG last week, guiding Australia to a convincing win in the third Test with a fluent half-century. “We love having him here. Last year he was awesome for us, maybe didn’t score as many runs as he would have liked but around the group and passing on knowledge was awesome to have him around. He’s one of the better team men. All the fans get to enjoy him playing cricket.” Warner has already announced retirement from ODIs but will be available for T20Is and T20 leagues across the globe. Sydney Thunder will play Sydney Sixer in a local derby here on Friday. Before the start of last season, Warner signed a two-year deal with Thunder as Cricket Australia sought to get international stars back into the tournament.

Ahead of the New Year’s Test David Warner took to social media as “a last resort” after his baggy green went missing between Melbourne and Sydney with the belief being the backpack had been stolen. “Inside this backpack was my baggy green. It’s sentimental to me. It’s something I’d love to have in my hands walking out there this week,” he said. “If it’s the backpack you really wanted, I have a spare one here. You won’t get into trouble, “Please reach out to Cricket Australia or myself via my social media. I’m happy to give this to you if you return my baggy greens.” However, during day 2 of the Test the backpack with the caps reappeared reportedly in the hotel lobby but with few details released some questioned if Warner had really lost them at all. It was a subject Sunrise hosts Monique Wright and Matt Doran couldn’t help to try and get to the bottom of when Candice Warner appeared on the show with her daughters to promote a beach safety campaign. “Gosh, it was exciting last week as we were following David’s last week. Of course, a bittersweet week,” Wright said. “Then we rode the wave of emotion about the missy Baggy Greens. I could only imagine what was happening for you Candice. What happened to those Baggy Greens?” Candice took a brief pause before tip-toeing around the subject of the missing baggy greens. “It’s always busy in our household, especially the last week. It was an unbelievable week. A week of reflection and just celebration for us,” she said. “That is a question for security management. At the end of the day he got his Baggy Greens back and that is the main thing.” Not wanting to left Candice off the hook that easy Doran tried to get some more information but Warner once again presented a straight bat. “Oh Candice, you’ve got to forgive me probing a little bit more. Australia is captivated by this mystery, can you give us any sense of what went on?” he asked “Again, like I said, that is up to management and stuff like that. But we are here today for Nutri Grain and for Surf Life Saving Australia and the girls cannot wait for this weekend’s racing at Maroubra Beach.” Warner is expected to be in action at the Big Bash tonight chartering in a helicopter to fly-in from his brother’s wedding.","pubDate":"2024-01-12 05:49:58","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-13197446/a8c9637596111ebb8d1993009acd9e6c4ddd0e91-16x9-x0y313w6000h3375.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"32fc3befb824e7701ebb612595d4bdcf","title":"NZ vs PAK: COVID-19 hits New Zealand's team as Mitchell Santner ruled out of first T20I","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/12-Jan-2024/nz-vs-pak-covid-19-hits-new-zealand-s-team-as-mitchell-santner-ruled-out-of-first-t20i","keywords":["sports"],"creator":["Web Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand’s star all-rounder Mitchell Santner has been ruled out of the first T20I against Pakistan after testing positive for Covid-19.","content":"New Zealand’s star all-rounder Mitchell Santner has been ruled out of the first T20I against Pakistan after testing positive for Covid-19. “Mitchell Santner won’t travel to Eden Park this evening for the opening KFC T20I against Pakistan after testing positive for COVID earlier today.

Sumit Nagal is through to 2024 Australian Open main draw Nagal, ranked 139th in the world, made the statement clear early on as he broke Molcan in his opening service game to race away to a 3-0 lead in the first set before his 26-year-old opponent broke back to level the score at 3-3 as the Indian lost his rhythm, registering 17 unforced errors in the first six games.

With Fisher’s 2018 anthem ‘Losing It’ blaring from the venue’s speakers, Warner and wife Candice descended onto the hallowed surface with hundreds of onlookers watching on, mostly comprised of media and Cricket NSW staff. He waved at a small group of fans in the MA Noble Stand before retiring to the sheds ahead of the Sydney Smash. Watch every match of the BBL season live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > The helicopter landed in front of the iconic Members’ Stand on the same patch of grass that displayed a painted message of ‘Thanks Dave’ during last week’s New Tear’s Test match against Pakistan. It was hoped Warner would emerge from the aircraft donning a tuxedo, James Bond style, but instead he wore Sydney Thunder kit. “He is a bit Hollywood, isn’t he? It is very Davey,” Sydney Sixers seamer Sean Abbott laughed while chatting to reporters on Thursday. “I got the Lime bike in today and I’ll be doing the same tomorrow night. So I’ll be riding out the gate there as Davey lands.” Warner had boarded the helicopter at Cessnock Airport just over 45 minutes earlier, having raced across from his brother’s wedding in the Hunter Valley. The 37-year-old left after the ceremony to ensure he could participate in Friday evening’s Big Bash League derby between the Sixers and Thunder at the SCG, which looms as a potential sellout. “If I missed my brother’s wedding, he would probably … jab me in the jaw a few times,” Abbott joked. Initially, Cricket NSW and Venues NSW were negotiating whether Warner’s helicopter could touch down at next door’s Allianz Stadium, but the plan was ultimately scrapped. “I’m glad they’re making it happen because I think everyone in the country who is a fan of cricket wants to see David Warner playing in the BBL,” Abbott continued. “I’m really looking forward to coming up against one of the best players in the world. He has been for a long time.” Warner plans for wild Thunder entrance | 01:11 Friday’s derby will be the first of Warner’s three Big Bash appearances this summer, unless the Thunder somehow qualify for the finals series, which at this stage is only a mathematical possibility. After Wednesday’s group-stage match against the Melbourne Renegades at Sydney Showground, the veteran opener will fly to the United Arab Emirates for a stint with the Dubai Capitals in the International League T20. Earlier this week, chief selector George Bailey confirmed Warner would then return home in February for the bilateral T20 series against the West Indies, missing the ILT20 finals campaign. Warner, in the final year of his two-season deal with the Thunder, compiled 99 runs in six knocks at 19.80 during last summer’s Big Bash with an underwhelming strike rate of 108.79. “He’s going to a lot of effort to come and play,” Thunder bowler Gurinder Sandhu told reporters on Wednesday. “We love having him here. Last year he was awesome for us. “He maybe didn’t score as many runs as he would have liked but he was awesome around the group and was passing on information. “I think he’s one of the better team men that we have in Cricket Australia and now all the fans get to enjoy him playing cricket. “Hopefully, he can put his best foot forward and score a hundred like he did in BBL01 playing for the Thunder. “Plus with his energy out in the field, it’ll be awesome having him out there.” The Sydney Smash, which will also feature Australian superstar Steve Smith, gets underway at the SCG on Friday at 7.15pm AEDT.","pubDate":"2024-01-12 06:09:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/34367cc5e0853dfaf5a386457f164161","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"73a65712cb5b09e9091acddf08891412","title":"Andy Murray gears up for 2024 Australian Open, opens up on 'mental side' of tennis ahead of opener","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/tennis/andy-murray-gears-up-for-2024-australian-open-opens-up-on-mental-side-of-tennis-ahead-of-opener-101705039127202.html","keywords":["sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Andy Murray opened up on his preparations for the upcoming 2024 Australian Open.","content":"Ahead of his 16th appearance at the Australian Open, Andy Murray will be looking to make an impact and challenge for the title.

Warner pulled the curtains down on a glorious Test career in front of his home crowd at the SCG last week, guiding Australia to a convincing win in the third Test with a fluent half-century. “We love having him here. Last year he was awesome for us, maybe didn’t score as many runs as he would have liked but around the group and passing on knowledge was awesome to have him around. He’s one of the better team men.

Ahead of the New Year’s Test David Warner took to social media as “a last resort” after his baggy green went missing between Melbourne and Sydney with the belief being the backpack had been stolen. “Inside this backpack was my baggy green. It’s sentimental to me. It’s something I’d love to have in my hands walking out there this week,” he said. “If it’s the backpack you really wanted, I have a spare one here. You won’t get into trouble, “Please reach out to Cricket Australia or myself via my social media. I’m happy to give this to you if you return my baggy greens.” However, during day 2 of the Test the backpack with the caps reappeared reportedly in the hotel lobby but with few details released some questioned if Warner had really lost them at all. It was a subject Sunrise hosts Monique Wright and Matt Doran couldn’t help to try and get to the bottom of when Candice Warner appeared on the show with her daughters to promote a beach safety campaign. “Gosh, it was exciting last week as we were following David’s last week. Of course, a bittersweet week,” Wright said. “Then we rode the wave of emotion about the missy Baggy Greens. I could only imagine what was happening for you Candice. What happened to those Baggy Greens?” Candice took a brief pause before tip-toeing around the subject of the missing baggy greens. “It’s always busy in our household, especially the last week. It was an unbelievable week. A week of reflection and just celebration for us,” she said. “That is a question for security management. At the end of the day he got his Baggy Greens back and that is the main thing.” Not wanting to left Candice off the hook that easy Doran tried to get some more information but Warner once again presented a straight bat. “Oh Candice, you’ve got to forgive me probing a little bit more. Australia is captivated by this mystery, can you give us any sense of what went on?” he asked “Again, like I said, that is up to management and stuff like that. But we are here today for Nutri Grain and for Surf Life Saving Australia and the girls cannot wait for this weekend’s racing at Maroubra Beach.” Warner is expected to be in action at the Big Bash tonight chartering in a helicopter to fly-in from his brother’s wedding.","pubDate":"2024-01-12 05:49:58","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-13197446/a8c9637596111ebb8d1993009acd9e6c4ddd0e91-16x9-x0y313w6000h3375.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"}]}
