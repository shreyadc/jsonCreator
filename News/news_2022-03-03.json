Kohli, who had been given rest in the recently-concluded T20I series, will become the sixth Indian cricketer to play 100 Test matches -- the others being Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and VVS Laxman. On the other hand, Shreyas Iyer is likely to be a part of the team after his three consecutive fifties in the 3-0 T20I series clean sweep against Sri Lanka. Here is how we think India will line up against Sri Lanka in the opening Test in Mohali: Rohit Sharma: The new Test skipper is likely to open the innings and will hope to give India a good start. Rohit missed the Test series in South Africa that ended in January and will hope to make his mark here. Mayank Agarwal: With KL Rahul not available, Mayank is likely to be the first choice to open India's batting alongside Rohit. Virat Kohli: The former India captain hasn't hit an international ton since 2019 and will look to break that hoodoo on his 100th Test match. Shreyas Iyer: After a phenomenal debut last year, Shreyas proved that he can do well in the longer format as well. He is expected to feature here given his current form. Hanuma Vihari: With his calm presence at the crease, Vihari is staking his claim for a regular place and will hope to make the best of this opportunity. Rishabh Pant: Returning to the side after missing the T20I series, Pant will be keen to do well with the bat in the series against the visiting Sri Lanka side. Ravichandran Ashwin: The veteran spinner can be lethal on his day and can contribute with the bat as well, making him a key part of the side. Ravindra Jadeja: With his all-round abilities, Jadeja, like Ashwin, has the kind of experience that makes it difficult to drop him from the side. Mohammed Shami: The experienced pacer will hope to make the most out of the conditions in Mohali and put serious pressure on the Lankans. Promoted Jasprit Bumrah: Leader of the Indian pace attack, Bumrah is India's most lethal weapon with the ball and will be key to the team's chances here. Mohammed Siraj: After doing well during his extended run in the Test side last year, Siraj is expected to keep his place in the team.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/nolbp7f_virat-kohli-afp_625x300_03_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How ‘Mr Cricket’ Mike Hussey fell in love with KFC SuperCoach AFL","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/afl/how-mr-cricket-mike-hussey-fell-in-love-with-kfc-supercoach-afl-c-5916557","keywords":null,"creator":["Mike Hussey"],"video_url":null,"description":"He was at the top of international cricket for years but Mike Hussey has finished as high as 13th overall in KFC SuperCoach AFL.

I cannot wait for the series to begin, with Pat Cummins leading this Australian team into its next phase. Australia certainly have the talent and leadership to win a Test series abroad for the first time since 2016. Regardless of the result, I am excited not just for this team, but for the series itself. Conditions in Pakistan are different to those elsewhere on the subcontinent, and Australia face a home team brimming with talent. That international cricket is beginning to return to the country, after it came to a shuddering halt in 2009 , is not just great for Pakistan but for cricket more broadly. For 75 years, cricket has been entwined with Pakistan’s national identity, binding more than 220 million people together. Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Javed Miandad are some of the greatest cricketers of the modern era and a source of pride for Pakistanis. For the game to have remained strong in the absence of international cricket at home is testament to their love for the game. I consider myself fortunate to have been a part of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) with Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators. The popularity and frenzied support of this league is proof of the game’s good health in the country. Osman Samiuddin sums it up in the title of his history of Pakistan cricket, The Unquiet Ones. Pakistan skipper Babar Azam and counterpart Pat Cummins with the Benaud-Qadir Trophy. Credit: AP While it may be at once dramatic and frenetic – or maybe because of that – I can honestly say that playing in Pakistan was one of the high points of a cricketing career that took me all over the world. Like those players now in Pakistan, I was initially a little nervous when I arrived for the first week of the PSL finals in 2019. That anxiety was soon put to rest by the love and support not just of the Quetta Gladiators fans, but from all the Pakistan cricket supporters, who embraced the overseas players. It was something I’d never experienced before. They genuinely love the game and cricket is a cause for celebration. Much to the credit of the incredibly hard work of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), it was also an experience during which I always felt safe. That season reached its crescendo in a final in front of a capacity crowd at the National Stadium in Karachi, which we went on to win by eight wickets against arch-rivals Peshawar Zalmi. Running a victory lap after the match in front of a stadium full of such passionate fans was, without doubt, one of the best moments I’ve ever experienced in cricket. It will stay with me for my entire life. All that said, I do appreciate there are significant differences in travelling as an individual athlete as opposed to part of a national team. As president of the Australian Cricketers Association, I have been part of consultations regarding the tour, including briefings from a pre-tour visit to Pakistan in December last year. The arrangements in place, which will be ongoing, are the world’s very best standard. It had to be for Cricket Australia to endorse the tour. The PSL aside, cricket fans in Pakistan have been starved of world-class cricket. This is not just an important tour Australia, but a special time for cricket. That Todd Greenberg and Nick Hockley – the CEOs of the ACA and Cricket Australia respectively – are travelling with the team demonstrates that the players and team staff are not being asked to do anything they wouldn’t be prepared to do themselves. It is a great show of confidence.

I cannot wait for the series to begin, with Pat Cummins leading this Australian team into its next phase. Australia certainly have the talent and leadership to win a Test series abroad for the first time since 2016. Regardless of the result, I am excited not just for this team, but for the series itself. Conditions in Pakistan are different to those elsewhere on the subcontinent, and Australia face a home team brimming with talent. That international cricket is beginning to return to the country, after it came to a shuddering halt in 2009 , is not just great for Pakistan but for cricket more broadly. For 75 years, cricket has been entwined with Pakistan’s national identity, binding more than 220 million people together. Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Javed Miandad are some of the greatest cricketers of the modern era and a source of pride for Pakistanis. For the game to have remained strong in the absence of international cricket at home is testament to their love for the game. I consider myself fortunate to have been a part of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) with Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators. The popularity and frenzied support of this league is proof of the game’s good health in the country. Osman Samiuddin sums it up in the title of his history of Pakistan cricket, The Unquiet Ones. Pakistan skipper Babar Azam and counterpart Pat Cummins with the Benaud-Qadir Trophy. Credit: AP While it may be at once dramatic and frenetic – or maybe because of that – I can honestly say that playing in Pakistan was one of the high points of a cricketing career that took me all over the world. Like those players now in Pakistan, I was initially a little nervous when I arrived for the first week of the PSL finals in 2019. That anxiety was soon put to rest by the love and support not just of the Quetta Gladiators fans, but from all the Pakistan cricket supporters, who embraced the overseas players. It was something I’d never experienced before. They genuinely love the game and cricket is a cause for celebration. Much to the credit of the incredibly hard work of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), it was also an experience during which I always felt safe. That season reached its crescendo in a final in front of a capacity crowd at the National Stadium in Karachi, which we went on to win by eight wickets against arch-rivals Peshawar Zalmi. Running a victory lap after the match in front of a stadium full of such passionate fans was, without doubt, one of the best moments I’ve ever experienced in cricket. It will stay with me for my entire life. All that said, I do appreciate there are significant differences in travelling as an individual athlete as opposed to part of a national team. As president of the Australian Cricketers Association, I have been part of consultations regarding the tour, including briefings from a pre-tour visit to Pakistan in December last year. The arrangements in place, which will be ongoing, are the world’s very best standard. It had to be for Cricket Australia to endorse the tour. The PSL aside, cricket fans in Pakistan have been starved of world-class cricket. This is not just an important tour Australia, but a special time for cricket. That Todd Greenberg and Nick Hockley – the CEOs of the ACA and Cricket Australia respectively – are travelling with the team demonstrates that the players and team staff are not being asked to do anything they wouldn’t be prepared to do themselves. It is a great show of confidence. Like the players, I am sure Pakistan for them will be the experience of a lifetime and that the series – a contest between two great cricket nations – will have been well worth the 24-year wait.

Then, a novice tour manager made a decision which saved world cricket. It was 1979. Australia's cricketers were in India. Bob Merriman was their tour manager. He wasn't initially meant to be there. But Merriman soon was the central figure in a flashpoint in which the lives of Australia's cricketers were threatened and relations imperiled between the sport's powers. The largely untold tale involves Kerry Packer and Don Bradman, Australian and Indian governments and their emissaries, Pakistani extremists, the disputed territory of Kashmir, India's army, and cricketers such as Kim Hughes and Jim Higgs. And Merriman. He had never been overseas before being called-up to manage the team a month before departure when the wife of incumbent manager Sam Loxton fell ill. Merriman, if he ultimately made a different decision, has little doubt of the ramifications. \"The relationship with India ... would have been just destroyed forever,\" Merriman told AAP on Thursday. \"And that would have meant in subsequent years ... the only relationships we would have had in cricket would have probably been New Zealand and England. \"Because India from there on, from 1980, 81, maybe 82, they dominated world cricket in organisational structure. \"They had West Indies covered, they had South Africa covered, they had Zimbabwe covered.

The tour from August to November, in the maddening Indian summer heat, was a \"goodwill tour\", Merriman said. Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket and the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) had just struck peace - with a caveat from the media mogul. Instead of India touring in the Australia summer of 1979/80, Packer insisted on hosting renowned drawcards England and the West Indies. \"So a side deal had to be done with India to go and play six Tests in India at that time of the year,\" Merriman said. \"It was a goodwill tour to try and square off the fact we had knocked them back.\" On August 21, 1979, the Australians left for Madras. They arrived a day late - their Air India plane blew an engine after a Singapore stopover. On landing in Madras, Merriman was asked by Indian official if the team was still going to Srinagar, Kashmir, for their scheduled tour opener from September 1. \"I said of course we are,\" Merriman said. What he didn't know was Australia's government had told Indian counterparts that the team wouldn't be going to Srinagar. The team had been threatened with death by the Pakistan Liberation Organisation if they travelled to Kashmir. \"What became obvious was that Andrew Peacock - the minister for foreign affairs in the Fraser government at the time - had got this message somehow that if we went to Srinagar our safety wouldn't be guaranteed and we would be attacked,\" Merriman said. \"He passed that on to the Australian Cricket Board and the chairman of the day was Bob Parish and he said we wouldn't go. \"Nobody told me.\" For more than a week, the Australian cricketers sweltered at training in oppressive Madras heat. \"The humidity was shocking. Even (legspinner) Jim Higgs couldn't last four overs in the heat and Hoggy (paceman Rodney Hogg) was lucky to get two balls,\" Merriman said. \"It was a difficult place to stay.\" All the while, Merriman absorbed information about the Srinagar threat from everyone from the Indian prime minister's office to Australia's high commission to AAP's touring journalist, John Coomber. Was the threat credible? \"That's the unanswered question,\" he said. \"Certainly the Australian officials in Canberra gave it high quality to convince Peacock not to go - and the difficulty was undoing that advice. The direction from the foreign affairs department was don't go. \"To be quite honest with you, I was uncertain what was going on because sitting in Madras with all the advice I was getting from the (Indian government) advisers and the Australian high commission in Delhi, it didn't seem to marry up with what was coming out of Canberra.\" There was also the substantial ACB backdrop, of Australia the cricket nation needing to re-pay India. \"(ACB chairman) Parish said to me 'look, we have got to do something to help the Indians, they supported us during World Series Cricket and Peacock is saying don't go - we have got to find a solution,\" Merriman said. Merriman called in the players for a meeting. They unanimously voted to go to Srinagar. \"They'd had a gutful of sitting in the heat in Madras, practising in terrible weather,\" he said. \"They said 'we just want to go and play cricket', so I could go back to the board and say 'the team want to go, I think we should go'. \"The emergency committee of the board at the time was Parish, Don Bradman and Tim Caldwell.

The Australian side has been in New Zealand preparing for the World Cup, which starts on Saturday, for several weeks. Cricket Australia confirmed on Thursday morning that Gardner, 24, who has been a shining star in the warm-up matches, tested positive to Covid-19 on a Rapid Antigen Test and follow-up PCR test. New Zealand health regulations mean the two-time T20 World Cup winner will have to isolate for 10 days - ruling her out of Saturday’s clash with England and the March 8 match against Pakistan.

All other players and coaching staff have since returned negative test results. Captain Meg Lanning said it was not ideal for Gardner or the team. “(Gardner) is quite devastated at what has happened over the last 24 hours, but it is the situation we are all living with and there is always a possibility that we can get Covid-19,” Lanning said. “We have all been doing as much as we can to avoid it and (Gardner) has done all the right things.” Gardner proved she had come to play in the recent warm-up match against New Zealand, hitting 60 off 32 balls - including four sixes and six fours. Lanning said there was no doubt it was a big loss for the team. “She is a real x-factor for us and when she comes in it changes the game for us, whether that is with the bat, ball or in the field,” the captain said. “It is disappointing that she will miss the first few games but we have to move on and work with that. A bonus is that everyone else is so far okay.” Fresh off the Ashes series win the Aussie women have played their fair share of cricket against England in the lead up to Saturday’s opener. “Tournament play is very different and what has happened in the past is really irrelevant,” Lanning said. “We are looking forward to the clash with England, there is always a lot of passion and fire and this time around will be no different.” Cricket Australia is yet to confirm who will step up to replace Gardner. The team is due to travel to Hamilton on Thursday night ahead of Saturday’s World Cup opening round, which will start at noon (AEDT).

The 2011 Argus Review recommended the coach become a selector in an expanded role, but Lee believes there should be no overlap between coaching and selection. Fox Cricket’s Lee, who was the latest guest on the Follow-On podcast, said his views were not a criticism of Andrew McDonald, who has taken the reins for the Pakistan tour on an interim basis.

From what I’m hearing and seeing, the guys enjoy him. He’s a calm character.” Ash Gardner tests positive to COVID | 00:43 Lee compared the role of the captain to a CEO of a business and though he believes Pat Cummins workload will be tested in Pakistan, he trusts his fellow New South Welshman to relish the challenge of an away tour in foreign conditions. “The captain should definitely have a huge say in what happens. If you are the captain of the Australian cricket team, you are pretty much the CEO of the team. You are the one calling the shots out there in the trenches. “You need to make sure that you get the team that you want. Or at least have a massive say anyway. “I think the captain should definitely be a selector. I’m not sure about the vice-captain. That can be almost like a half-vote with the captain. I’d take that responsibility off the coach.” ‘WASN’T SPINNING’: Lyon’s massive selection hint as Aussies toss up first Test team Smith ready to return from concussion | 02:22 Unlike many of his former teammates, Lee is backing the Aussies to win the three-match series and said the tourists deserve the favourites tag. Speaking on SEN this week, McDonald suggested the Aussies will take three specialist quicks into the first Test. Lee praised Boland’s Ashes campaign but could not find room for him in the starting XI. “It’s a good problem to have,” he said. “We have got this conveyor belt of fast bowlers which is great for the Aussies. “Starc, Cummins, Hazlewood pick themselves and then Boland will have to fight his way in. I can’t see him being in the attack if they are going to go with three pace bowlers and a spinner.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket World Cup: Australia loses star all-rounder Ash Gardner for opening match after Covid positive","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/icc-womens-world-cup/cricket-world-cup-australia-loses-star-allrounder-ash-gardner-for-opening-match-after-covid-positive/news-story/3c50f44e2a64f6b733aa3af31252e618","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia will be without superstar all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner for its first two World Cup clashes after she tested positive to Covid-19 in New Zealand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 01:55:00","full_description":"Australia will be without superstar all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner for its first two World Cup clashes after she tested positive to Covid-19 in New Zealand.

She could come in to contention for Australia’s third match against hosts New Zealand on March 13 at Wellington’s Basin Reserve. All remaining Australian players and support staff have tested negative following subsequent RATs. The Aussies, raging favourites to win the World Cup, were set to go ahead with existing plans to travel to Hamilton on Thursday night ahead of the side’s opening match against England on Saturday. Australia’s players aren’t in a quarantine bubble in New Zealand despite the country being in the grips of its worst Covid-wave, recording more than 22,000 cases this week. Players were able to move about freely after being released early from quarantine, having spent seven days in a Christchurch hotel. Fearing the prospect of Covid wiping out bulk numbers of players the International Cricket Council altered playing conditions for the tournament allowing teams to use substitute fielders from within support staff if necessary to complete matches. Teams only need a minimum of nine fit players for games to go ahead. There are also provisions to change the tournament fixture to accommodate teams should it be necessary. “From a COVID-19 perspective, we need to be a little bit flexible, as far as the way in which we manage the game to take into account these unique circumstances,” the ICC’s head of events Chris Tetley said last week. “And if they have female substitutes from within their management team, we would allow two substitutes to play – non-batting, non-bowling – to enable a game to take place. We’ll be asking teams to show maximum flexibility and we’ll be as flexible as possible if the need arises to fulfil our objective, which is to get the games on.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Chahar set to miss first half of IPL season","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/chahar-set-to-miss-first-half-of-ipl-season-374655","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi, March 2Chennai Super Kings (CSK) pacer Deepak Chahar is set to miss first half of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) due to a right quadriceps injury which he sustained during the third and final T20 match against West Indies in Kolkata.According to a BCCI sources, Chahar is likely to be out for eight weeks.\"Chahar is out for at least eight weeks, which means he will miss half of IPL 2022,\" the BCCI source said.The IPL 2022 starts on March 26 and CSK are still waiting for a final report from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru where the pacer is recuperating.Meanwhile, all the IPL teams will start training in the city from March 14 or 15 onwards and five practice venues have been identified. —","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 01:33:44","full_description":"PTI New Delhi, March 2 Chennai Super Kings (CSK) pacer Deepak Chahar is set to miss first half of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) due to a right quadriceps injury which he sustained during the third and final T20 match against West Indies in Kolkata.

A generation ago, Sunil Gavaskar gave up captaincy of his own volition at 35 and retired from cricket at 38. Kapil Dev never captained after age 28 and retired at 35. More recently, Sourav Ganguly lost captaincy at 33, Rahul Dravid gave it up at 34 and Sachin Tendulkar relinquished it at 31.But then we have Anil Kumble, made captain at 37. He won a series at home against Pakistan, made a bigger impact in Australia as a leader on the field — and some righteous plainspeak off it. But his tenure didn't last even one year, for by the time he played his final Test, he was done as a player — his last two Test matches yielded returns of 0/160 and 3/126, and the three batsmen he dismissed were Nos. 7, 9 and 10 of Australia in New Delhi.Kumble performed his role very well, even as his body, after decades of wear and tear, was giving up; crucially, the young Mahendra Singh Dhoni had shown remarkable coolness and acumen in leading India by then — at the T20 World Cup in 2007 and, even more impressively, in the 50-over CB Series in Australia in 2008.Sharma's inningsSourav Ganguly, Dhoni and Kohli left a long-lasting impression with their distinct leadership styles. Ganguly and Kohli were extremely expressive and passionate, but Dhoni often gave the impression of being indifferent — the way he simply sauntered away from the leadership role in the middle of a gruelling Test series in Australia cemented that impression.In terms of his on-field persona, Sharma, a carefree character, is going to be more in the Dhoni mould than the Ganguly or Kohli mould.But the most important question is — how much time would he have to leave his stamp on the job?Chetan Sharma, the chairman of selectors, said that Rohit Sharma's tenure would be used to groom a younger player for the top job.\"We want to groom future captains under Rohit. He is the No 1 cricketer of our country. Today's professional cricketers manage their body and Rohit has no problem at all and he is absolutely okay...\" Chetan Sharma said two weeks ago.It's curious that he should have mentioned fitness — Rohit Sharma indeed has had problems with injuries, and even someone of the stature of Gavaskar argues that he's not the best candidate to lead the team in all formats because of his history of injuries.Sharma's ascension to the leadership role has come in the twilight of his career — maybe he'll flicker all the more bright for that.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 01:33:26","full_description":"Tribune News Service Rohit Mahajan Chandigarh, March 2 On Friday, Rohit Sharma takes over as India’s captain in the longest format from a man who’s India’s most successful Test captain — and who’s one year Sharma’s junior.

Kumble performed his role very well, even as his body, after decades of wear and tear, was giving up; crucially, the young Mahendra Singh Dhoni had shown remarkable coolness and acumen in leading India by then — at the T20 World Cup in 2007 and, even more impressively, in the 50-over CB Series in Australia in 2008. Sharma’s innings Sourav Ganguly, Dhoni and Kohli left a long-lasting impression with their distinct leadership styles. Ganguly and Kohli were extremely expressive and passionate, but Dhoni often gave the impression of being indifferent — the way he simply sauntered away from the leadership role in the middle of a gruelling Test series in Australia cemented that impression. In terms of his on-field persona, Sharma, a carefree character, is going to be more in the Dhoni mould than the Ganguly or Kohli mould. But the most important question is — how much time would he have to leave his stamp on the job? Chetan Sharma, the chairman of selectors, said that Rohit Sharma’s tenure would be used to groom a younger player for the top job. “We want to groom future captains under Rohit. He is the No 1 cricketer of our country. Today’s professional cricketers manage their body and Rohit has no problem at all and he is absolutely okay...” Chetan Sharma said two weeks ago. It’s curious that he should have mentioned fitness — Rohit Sharma indeed has had problems with injuries, and even someone of the stature of Gavaskar argues that he’s not the best candidate to lead the team in all formats because of his history of injuries. Sharma’s ascension to the leadership role has come in the twilight of his career — maybe he’ll flicker all the more bright for that.","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/3/2022_3$largeimg_538435860.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women's Cricket World Cup team guide","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/womens-cricket-world-cup-team-guide-c-5912915","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben McKay"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy helps Australian Associated Press preview the Women's World Cup, which begins this weekend in New Zealand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 01:01:58","full_description":"A LOOK AT THE EIGHT WOMEN'S WORLD CUP SIDES:- Australia wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy provides her thoughts on the eight sides competing for the World Cup in New Zealand over the next month.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam and Australia captain Pat Cummins on Wednesday unveiled the Benaud-Qadir Trophy at the Pindi Cricket Stadium ahead of the first Test, which commences on Friday. The Benaud-Qadir Trophy will be presented to the winning side at the headquarters of Pakistan cricket in Lahore, where the three-Test series will culminate. Benaud and Qadir were two skilful, distinguished and immensely respected cricketers of different eras as they served the game with honour, pride and distinction. Benaud got wrist-spin bowling noticed and recognised as an attacking and wicket-taking option, an art that was subsequently taken to the next level by Qadir with some incredible performances against high-quality batters at a time when express fast bowlers were ruling the roost. Benaud captained Australia on the team’s first full tour to Pakistan in 1959 and won the series 2-0, while Qadir played in 11 Tests against Australia in which he took 45 wickets, including 33 wickets in two three-Test series in 1982 and 1988 against Kim Hughes and Allan Border’s sides, respectively. Individually, in 63 Tests from 1952 to 1964, Benaud took 248 wickets, whereas Qadir took to Test cricket in 1977 and finished in 1990 with 236 wickets in 67 Tests. For their respective heroics, achievements and accomplishments, Benaud was inducted in the ICC Hall of Fame in 2009, while Qadir was included in the PCB Hall of Fame in 2021. PCB Chief Executive Officer Faisal Hasnain said: “There can be no better way to celebrate and mark the revival of Pakistan-Australia Test rivalry in Pakistan by launching the trophy in the names of two absolute legends and icons of this great game – Richie Benaud and Abdul Qadir. These two gentlemen remain a flavour of all eras and ages as their contributions towards cricket in general and wrist-spin bowling in particular are second to none. “The launch of the Benaud-Qadir Trophy will add further context and spice to the Pakistan-Australia Test series, which historically have been well-contested and hard-fought. I am confident that players from either side will draw further inspiration from this initiative and would want to be the first to put a hand on the trophy. Meanwhile, Pakistan cricket fans are looking forward to the opportunity of seeing two outstanding sides battling out on the field in a bid to win the inaugural Benaud-Qadir Trophy. “The launch of Benaud-Qadir Trophy is a joint-initiative of the PCB and CA that clearly demonstrates the strong and cordial relationship between the two cricket boards. The PCB looks forward to working very closely with the CA in the years to come. “I would like to thank and pass on my gratitude to the families of Richie Benaud and Abdul Qadir, who very generously and graciously allowed us to launch the prestigious trophy in their names. This initiative not only reflects the love, value and respect for our great game but for each other’s countries, people, culture and heritage.” Cricket Australia Chief Executive Officer Nick Hockley: “This Test series is an exciting and historic occasion with Australia touring Pakistan for the first time in 24 years. Given that context, it is fitting that we can honour two genuine legends of the game, Richie Benaud and Abdul Qadir, by inaugurating a trophy the two sides will play for with those legendary names on it. Australia men’s captain Pat Cummins: “To be able to compete for the Benaud-Qadir Trophy for the first time is a huge honour. As current players, we really are standing on the shoulders of these greats of the past who helped to grow and popularize the game in years gone by, and if my team can collect that trophy at the end of this series then it really would be the perfect end to the Test part of this historic tour.” Captain Babar Azam: “The game is today healthy, wealthy and strong because of such individuals and their legacy, as such, we must always recognise and acknowledge their contributions and services. “I am honoured that I will be leading the Pakistan team in the Benaud-Qadir Trophy, we will try and give performances that will be a tribute to these two legends who will always remain legends of the game.” Before the Benaud-Qadir Trophy, Pakistan and Australia have played 25 Test series with Australia winning 13 and Pakistan winning seven. When Pakistan last hosted Australia in 1998, Mark Taylor’s side won the series 1-0, while Sarfaraz Ahmed’s men won 1-0 in Pakistan’s last home series in the United Arab Emirates in 2018. The last Test series between the two sides was played in Australia in 2019, which was won 2-0 by Australia.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Premier Cricket: Hamish McKenzie’s seven wickets steers Subiaco-Floreat into semifinals","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/premier-cricket-hamish-mckenzies-seven-wickets-steers-subiaco-floreat-into-semifinals-c-5868867","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"Hamish McKenzie has put WA selectors on notice after another barnstorming performance on elimination final weekend.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 01:00:00","full_description":"Hamish McKenzie has continued his season-long purple patch with the ball, taking seven wickets to bowl Subiaco-Floreat into the Premier Cricket semifinals. Fresh from claiming man-of-the-match honours in last weekend’s one-day final, the left-arm wrist spinner helped his side to a comfortable eight-wicket win over Midland-Guildford. Top-of-the-table South Perth also booked their spot in the semis after eliminating Melville with a five-wicket win, while Perth overcame Willetton thanks to a Jonathan Wells century. McKenzie was the star of the show for the Lions as they skittled their opponents for 177, finishing with 7-45 from 22 overs to take his wicket tally to 63 for the season in all forms of the game. After being sent in to bat, Midland-Guildford put on 51 for the opening wicket before three wickets fell for just six runs, including that of Keaton Critchell (34). James Godfrey (30), Brayden Brehaut (36) and Jordan Mast (32) led the fightback as they nudged their total to 5-170 before McKenzie took over the game. McKenzie took the final five wickets at the cost of just seven runs as the lower order crumbled, before Ben Tredget (70) and Jayden Goodwin (42) led Subiaco-Floreat to the required total in under 64 overs. At Richardson Park, ladder-leaders South Perth won the toss and elected to field, bowling Melville out for just 146 from 80 overs. Despite the efforts of Kieran Coyne and Brad Turner (26 each), Melville’s hopes of doubling up in the wake of their Twenty20 triumph were left in tatters as Hilton Cartwright took 4-21 from nine overs. Mark Turner and Bryce Jackson ensured South Perth did not have it all their way in the run chase, as they combined to reduce the hosts to 3-23 early. However, Cameron Gannon’s half-century and an unbeaten 47 from Timothy Hale were enough to get South Perth over the line. Perth produced the best fightback of the weekend as they successfully chased down Willetton’s 233 on their way to a seven-wicket victory at Burrendah Park. After electing to bat, Cam Bancroft (57) and Iszak Milentis (46) combined for an 84-run opening stand, but they lost captain Aaron Hardie for just four. Steady mid-order contributions from D’Arcy Short (23), Shayne Wornes (30) and John Sanders (28) were enough to guide Willetton past 230, with Ethan Carrington impressing with 3-26 from 17 overs with the ball. However, Perth captain Wells led from the front with a tremendous, unbeaten knock of 106 from 219 balls, forming fruitful partnerships with Samuel Fanning (39) and later Sean Roberts (59) to lead his side to victory late in the day’s play. As the highest-ranked loser in week one of the finals, Willetton secured a semifinal spot, but will have to do it the hard way with a trip to Floreat Park to face Subiaco-Floreat. Meanwhile, South Perth and Perth will meet in the other semifinal, with the local derby to be played at Richardson Park. Both two-day semifinals will be played this weekend.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5868867/448748dd2f330cf482a9faf47a9c2f0edb8e78ee-16x9-x0y283w1773h997.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Craven Cricket League secretary hails cup change","link":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/19959808.craven-cricket-league-secretary-hails-cup-change/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CHANGING the Manorlands Plate from a T20 competition to the Hundred format has paid dividends big time.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-03 01:00:00","full_description":"CHANGING the Manorlands Plate from a T20 competition to the Hundred format has paid dividends big time. What is seen as the Mewies Solicitors Craven League’s other knockout competition after the Wynn Cup and Cowling Cup only attracted seven entries last year. But switching each innings to 100 balls rather than 120 has more than doubled the Plate entries to 15. “I am absolutely delighted,” said Craven League secretary Peter Foster, whose brainchild the change of format was. “I wanted to put some interest back into grass-roots cricket after two years in which we have lost players to golf and we have lost players to families. “I wanted players to feel that excitement again about the start of the cricket season.” Foster watched several Hundred games on television last summer, but it was his visit to Headingley to watch a match in the flesh that changed his mind over the potential of the Hundred. He said: “I am a traditionalist at heart, so I was sceptical beforehand, but that all changed once the match got under way with the atmosphere and excitement. “Cricketers nowadays want to get home. They don’t want to be in the field for seven hours in a day.” Of the 15 entries, Airedale, Bingley Congs, Gargrave, Denholme, Oakworth and Skipton CI took part last year. However, there are nine newcomers for the competition that raises vital money for Manorlands Hospice, the Oxenhope-based Sue Ryder home. They are Foulridge, Sutton, Wilsden, Barrowford, Haworth, Riddlesden, Keighley, Ingrow and Bradley. Matches, which are mutually arranged before a deadline for each round, can be played in an evening or on Sundays, and teams care encouraged to raise money on matchdays for the charity. The finals day is on Sunday, August 28 at Keighley Cricket Club. Manorlands Plate – First round: Foulridge v Airedale, Bingley Congs v Gargrave, Sutton v Wilsden, Barrowford v Haworth, Riddlesden v Keighley, Denholme v Oakworth, Skipton CI v Ingrow. Bye: Bradley. Matches to be played before Thursday, June 30.","image_url":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/13523649/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"thetelegraphandargus","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
