Nigeria won the toss and elected to bat. Usual suspects Paul Pam and Selim Saliu opened the batting order for Nigeria, putting up an excellent partnership to score a 100 for the team, before Pam was sent to the stands in the 27th over. Pam’s dismissal was the twick Sierra Leone needed to dismiss the hosts successfully in the next 20 overs, limiting Nigeria to 184 runs, all out in 47.4 overs. The second innings meant Nigeria needed to defend the score against a strong-willed Sierra Leonean side, with captain John Bangura steering the ship.

From the captaincy to the top order conundrum and the middle order jigsaw puzzle, there are questions littered through the defending champion’s squad. Here are five burning questions ahead of Australia’s final five T20s against the Windies and England before their World Cup defence gets underway. Watch Australia v West Indies. Every T20 Live & Exclusive to Fox Sports on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Aaron Finch’s position in the Australian team is still up for debate. Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images IS AARON FINCH LOCKED AND LOADED AS AUSTRALIA’S WORLD CUP SKIPPER? With five matches left, it seems unlikely Australia will make a change of captaincy at this late stage. George Bailey backed his out of sorts captain to lead Australia to a maiden T20 World Cup crown last year and he was rewarded. While Finch’s output with the bat left some questions around his form, questions that still exist, the fact he managed to lead Australia to glory put a lifetime of currency in the bank. Should it have? You could argue no, and if Australia fail to win this year’s tournament and he struggles, that will be a mark the selection board carries against them during its tenure. Hitherto, Australia’s selection panel under Bailey have not put a foot wrong from the decision to back Finch, then appoint Pat Cummins captain and strong selections from Travis Head to Usman Khawaja during the Ashes. Even during their 1-0 away series win against Pakistan, Australia’s selectors got it right. But Finch is their biggest punt to date. On the slower wickets of the subcontinent, Finch has been repeatedly found out. On the quicker wickets of Australia, Finch’s technique will be tested. Marsh & Starc set to return! | 02:25 Only a series of single-figure scores, perhaps in every remaining match ahead of their World Cup opener on October 22, will change anything. Even then, they will go back to the ODI World Cups in 2015 and 2019 when Finch scored a mountain of runs when it counted. The reluctance to change the captaincy revolves around Finch’s calm head. In T20 cricket, which moves at a rate of a Japanese bullet train, clear thinking, particularly in the field, when bowlers are up against it and bowling plans and fields are vital, is paramount. Australia’s selectors believe this is where Finch shines. IS THE DOOR SHUT ON CAM GREEN’S WORLD CUP DREAM? It says something about what a home World Cup means when Pat Cummins said the 2015 victory at the MCG rates as one of his greatest moments in cricket. Why? Cummins did not even play in the final, instead he held the drinks. Yet, the significance of a full house at the MCG in a World Cup final was not lost on the fast bowler. That is why Cameron Green will be desperate to play in the World Cup. Should he? Well, the next five matches could well answer that question. Green plays a shot a ball in crazy 50 | 02:20 With Finch and David Warner likely locked and loaded at the top of the order, could the all-rounder play elsewhere? Absolutely, and that is why Marcus Stoinis is particularly vulnerable. Like Finch, the class of ‘21 has the currency and Australia’s selectors will likely want to back those who won in the UAE. But the reality is Stoinis has struggled since, particularly in ODI cricket, while he rarely bowls. Stoinis will miss the matches against the West Indies but must be given every warm-up match to find his feet though because he is a match-winner. Red hot Green retained in T20 squad | 00:44 He played vital knocks against South Africa in the pool stage last year and Pakistan in the semi-final, where alongside Matthew Wade he saw Australia home. Green, as he showed in India, where he scored two half-centuries at the top of the order, is versatile and his all-round ability, as well as his excellent hands, is international class. WHAT NOW FOR TIM DAVID? If it was not already known, potential has been confirmed. Indeed, Tim David can be a world beater. Ricky Ponting has been pushing his case for two years and now the world knows what David - the 26-year-old, who was born in Singapore - can do. His 54 from 27 deliveries in the third T20 was crucial. After two quick hits in the opening two matches, David was given a chance and showed that what comes off the bat is as good as the sound it makes in the nets. His innings included four sixes, while he finished with a strike-rate of 200. If you’re doing that in the middle-orders, when the field is up, you’re doing something right. But his innings came when Warner, as well as Marcus Stoinis and Mitch Marsh, were missing. Watch Australia v West Indies. Every T20 Live & Exclusive to Fox Sports on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > David bludgeons maiden T20I half century | 01:01 It means that David is likely fighting for a spot alongside Stoinis and Marsh, unless Australia somehow decides to back getting four overs out of the duo and possibly dropping a specialist bowler. COULD AUSTRALIA DROP A BOWLER AND IF SO, WHO? In the UAE, Australia predominantly played three quicks - Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins - and specialist spinner Adam Zampa. They relied on getting more than useful overs out of Glenn Maxwell, and occasionally from Marsh and Stoinis. Four of those bowlers are specialists, while Maxwell is more than handy. It means that Marsh and Stoinis, both who are capable but injury prone, often go unused. Yet, could Australia consider dropping one of their specialist quicks to get another batter into the mix? Quite possibly yes, and if they did then Cummins would likely be the one under the gun. Hazlewood has emerged as Australia’s best short-form bowler over the past 16 months, having starred in the past two IPLs. Clutch India hold their nerve in decider | 03:18 Starc’s left-arm option and ability to swing and produce the goods with his yorker means he is often considered a lock. Cummins, however, can still go the journey and recently struggled in India. Across the three matches in India, he took two wickets and went for 110 runs, an economy of 11. Hazlewood, too, went at 11 an over, but his form has been irresistible in recent years. WHY SMITH’S FORM NEEDS TO CONTINUE Because of the nature of random T20 series played during the winter months of Australia, Smith’s stunning return has gone unnoticed. But alongside Green, Smith has been one of the nation’s best in recent months. He might have missed out in the latter two games in India, but he started the series with a swift 35. Before that, he smashed New Zealand and Zimbabwe around on decks where most of Australia’s batting line-up struggled. Australia punish India in T20 opener | 01:52 Smith provides Australia balance. From Warner to Wade, Marsh to Stoinis, Australia has a group of dashers that plays to everything that T20 cricket is about. The game is more nuanced than that though, with manipulation of the field and subtlety just as important. At times, pace between the wickets, particularly when conditions call on it, are just as important as a bludgeoning six over the ropes. It is why Smith’s return to form is important because he can do that better than anyone in the world.

Going to be only the second international match to be played at the Carrara Oval, the venue will be hosting a T20I after almost four years. Part of the only international match here, T20I defending champions Australia will have eyes on a larger prize than their second win here. While its only T20I till date was also the first T20 to be played here, the stadium has since hosted 15 Big Bash League matches across four different seasons and three Women’s T20Is. With any batter yet to bring up a T20I half-century at the Carrara Oval, highest run-scorers among players taking part in this series are Glenn Maxwell (38) and Aaron Finch (7). Similarly, no Australian bowler part of the current squad has ever dismissed a batter in a T20I played at the Carrara Oval. Taking all T20s into consideration, Maxwell (276) continues to be the highest run-scorer at this venue followed by Nicholas Pooran (81) and Ashton Agar (65) among players part of the current squads are concerned. If the same filter is applied to bowlers, Australia spinner Adam Zampa (9) and all-rounder Daniel Sams (3) are the highest T20 wicket-takers at this stadium. A 10-over rain-curtailed match, inaugural Carrara T20I had witnessed Australia scoring 87/7 in response to South Africa’s 108/6. The record for highest T20 innings total at the Carrara Oval belongs to Sydney Sixers for amassing 194/9 in 19.5 overs against Melbourne Stars on Boxing Day 2020. The same also remains the highest successful T20 run-chase here. What a deck!😍 — Windies Cricket (@windiescricket) A total of 19 T20s are yet to witness the 200-run mark being crossed in a T20 at the Carrara Oval.

We want to keep getting better as a team – Rohit Sharma Photo Credit: (BCCI) During the post-match presentation ceremony, Rohit Sharma said that Team India need to get better as a unit. He said: “As a team we said at the beginning, no matter what happens with the result – there’s always room for improvement. We want to keep getting better as a team. Teams have been quite challenging, they can challenge in all departments. Something we have been talking about at length.” Rohit Sharma added that the Indian team will have to make big improvements in the bowling department ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022. He also said that giving the role clarity to the players in the squad is his job. He elaborated: “We need to look at a lot of things. Surya’s form is a concern (laughs). We need to work on our bowling. We played against two quality sides, we came across tough challenges. We need to see what better we can do. We are working towards that, guys need a lot of clarity, it’s my job to make sure it happens. It’s a work in progress, we need to keep working and keep finding answers to it.” Rohit Sharma further talked about India’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 squad and said that several players have never played in Australian conditions and that’s the reason they have decided to travel to Australia early to get an idea of the conditions. He said: “Lot of the guys haven’t been to Australia, that’s why we are going there early. We want to play on the bouncy pitches of Perth, we want to see what we can do there. Only 7,8 members of the squad have been to Australia, so we have organised a few practice games. We need to understand what combination we can play.” Rohit Sharma further talked about pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah’s absence from India’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 squad and said: “Bumrah is out of the World Cup, so we need to find a bowler who has the experience of bowling in Australia. Not sure who that bowler is going to be, we will see once we travel to Australia, we’ll find it out there.” Jasprit Bumrah.

Temba Bavuma-led’s side would be happy as the team showed a lot of character across all the departments. The catching in the 3rd T20I match was fantastic as they displayed acrobatic fielding. India on the other hand would be having mixed feelings as in the 1st two T20Is they were quite dominating. The biggest positive of the series was the form of Suryakumar Yadav. The batter who is now known to be Mr.360 has shown that he can thrash any opponent on his given day. Suryakumar Yadav. PC-AFP. Suryakumar had decimated Aussies and the way he toyed with South African bowlers is an indication that he is not going to change his ultra-aggressive approach by any means. The right-handed batter would take a lot of confidence from this series; especially his half-century in the 1st T20I match on a grassy pitch was amazing. Suryakumar Yadav would be hoping that he continues his form in ICC T20 World Cup in Australia. The batter hasn’t been in Australia before; it won’t be wrong to say that the conditions for him would be alien. It would be interesting to see how he fares on fast and bouncy pitches and those long boundaries where hitting won’t be easy by means. I didn’t check the stats- Suryakumar Yadav During the presentation, he was asked whether he knew that he had smashed 50 sixes in a calendar year. He responded: “Not really, I didn’t check the stats. But I think that was the demand of the game. My friends send these things (stats and numbers) on whatsapp, I don’t follow it.” He was asked about batting at the No.5 position after Dinesh Karthik. He asserted: “The thought process was the same, I just wanted to enjoy. I had to take a step back and build a partnership with him. Didn’t work today. DK needed some game time, and I think the way he batted, my number 4 is in trouble.” Suryakumar Yadav.

Thus, both India and South Africa will play their first ODI at this venue on Thursday. Overall a decent enough pitch for the batters, the black soil pitch at this surface does provide the pacers the extra zip and bounce off the surface, with the spinners also likely to come into the game during the latter stage. Most recently, during the three T20 matches of the ongoing Legends League Cricket 2022 at this venue, the average score was a rather paltry 144.6, with the pacers taking full advantage of the pitch condition upfront.
