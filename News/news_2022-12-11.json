After an impressive start to his career in the international game since debuting in 2020, the Black Caps fast bowler had his 2022 season cut short due to a back injury suffered during the side’s tour of England in June. Jamieson left the tour after sustaining the injury and hasn’t been sighted on the pitch since. Speaking to Newstalk ZB’s Jason Pine, the 27-year-old said he remained without a set timeline to return but was hopeful he wouldn’t be on the sidelines for too much longer. “It’s a question I’d love to know as well. Certainly not too far away; hopefully early in the new year,” Jamieson said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “Everything is tracking pretty good. We’re cautiously optimistic of where things are at the moment. We’ve had quite a big body of work over the last few months. I’m certainly feeling pretty good and, when the time comes, I’ll be raring to go for sure.” He will be hoping to get back on the pitch before the end of the Kiwi summer – particularly given he has again put his name forward for the IPL auction on December 23, after withdrawing last season. It is expected there will be plenty of interest in the Kiwi quick at the auction after he set his base price at 1 crore (NZ$194,000). Should he return soon, he may be able to prove his health and move into contention for a return to the Black Caps for their January series’ against Pakistan and India, while opportunities against England (February) and Sri Lanka (March) are also on the horizon. “We’ve taken a bit of a cautious approach to it, just making sure that when we get back out on the park, we do that in a sustainable way and come back ready and firing for what may lay ahead.” Jamieson said he was realistic in the fact he might have to deal with back issues at some point in his career, such is the territory that comes with being a fast bowler, and has made the most of his break. He said while he had been healthy in that area up to this point of his career, given the amount of cricket that was being played these days, something was bound to give eventually. “It’s certainly a key part when you’re trying to bowl as much as we do at times; it just something you’re at peace with, really – it takes a fair bit of load when you’re bowling and these can pop up. “It’s been a challenge; it certainly hasn’t just been smooth sailing the whole way. There have been times I’ve been watching the boys out there and have wished to be out there and all of that sort of stuff. But I was pretty clear early on; how many times do you get a blessing where you get to take time to have a rest and put some time into your game? We’re constantly going; constantly moving all the time and to be able to spend some time at home, spend time with family and put an extended amount of time into your game is a blessing. I’ve tried to stay focused on that; tried to stay focused on the bigger picture. It’s been a great couple of years and hopefully, there’s a few more to come.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME.

It appears hope for the best is the answer.","content":"The opener has made headlines this week after declaring he will not be appealing his leadership ban because hearings would be made public.But Warner’s form on the field has come under increasing scrutiny after he struggled against a weakened West Indies bowling attack in the two-match series.Watch Australia v West Indies. Every test match live and ad-break in play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >While Usman Khawaja has looked solid and Marnus Labuschagne, Travis Head and Steve Smith have scored centuries, Warner has produced scores of 5, 48, 21 and 28 from his four innings.Warner hasn’t scored a Test century since January 2020 against New Zealand — 1074 days ago — and his last ton away from home was against Bangladesh in 2017.“I didn’t realise it was that lean, to be honest,” Ricky Ponting said on Channel 7 of Warner’s century drought. “Coming on for two years for a Test match century. Four half centuries in his last 26 innings.”With a fearsome South African fast bowling attack on Australian soil and tours of India and England on the horizon, Warner will be hoping to improve his form quickly.“You talk about how things are getting tougher for Warner with the attack the South Africans have got,” Ponting added. “Well, it’s never easy in India either. We know what wickets we will get there. We will get turning pitches. No doubt. It’s never been easy for any Australian batsman going there and trying to play in those conditions. “Then on the back of that, what’s after that? The Ashes, in England as well. We will get conditions that will suit (Stuart) Broad, (James) Anderson and (Ollie) Robinson.”Warner has flagged next year’s Ashes tour of England as a potential finish line to his Test career, while the 36-year-old’s strong white ball form could see him play ODIs and T20s for a couple more years.But Warner’s underwhelming form in red ball cricket has raised a dilemma for Australian cricket. If and when Warner and Khawaja hang up the gloves, who will replace them?Will Pucovski was seen as the next long term opener for Australia but the Victorian prodigy has stepped away from cricket for personal reasons with no timeline on his return.“Henry Hunt from South Australia and Tim Ward, he really impressed me last year,” ex-Australian paceman Merv Hughes said on Triple M.“But they seemed miles off until Pucovski got injured. Everyone was just thinking and hoping that Pucovski would come back in and that hasn’t been the case. So it’s really opened the door.”“To be absolutely frank, there’s not a lot that can replace either Usman Khawaja or David Warner going forward at the moment,” former Australian captain Mark Taylor added.(Marcus) Harris is in the squad but not playing that well. (Matt) Renshaw’s going all right in Shield cricket but neither of them are playing anywhere near as well as Warner and Khawaja at the moment. And yet both those guys are 36 years old. “So there’s going to be some changes at some stages over the next 12-24 months for Australian cricket. It’s important from an Australian cricket point of view that we find some replacements for both Khawaja and Warner.”Khawaja turns 36 next week and the clock will soon be ticking on the veteran duo’s partnership at the top of the order.“With Khawaja and Warner at their age, they could both leave the game at the same time, although Khawaja’s looking a bit more comfortable at this stage then Warner is,” Hughes said.With 24 Test centuries to his name, Warner will go down as one of Australia’s greatest ever openers.But his lean spell could soon give selectors a serious headache.“He hasn’t made a hundred for a long time,” Hughes said.“My personal belief is he’s not wound up against the West Indies but he’s going to need to wind up against South Africa. “The thing you’re starting to see with David Warner is he’s starting to struggle a little bit more with that short ball,” Taylor said.“That’s an area he’s going to be tested by South Africa. That’s going to be a big series for him because he’s not made the runs in recent times that I’m sure he would like and Australia would like.”Australia is on track to claim a 2-0 series win over West Indies before taking on South Africa in a three-match series.","pubDate":"2022-12-10 23:50:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France Highlights: France march onto semi-finals, beat England 2-1","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/fifa-world-cup-2022-england-vs-france-highlights-france-march-onto-semi-finals-beat-england-2-1-11788151.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France Highlights: France march onto semi-finals, beat England 2-1","content":"FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France Highlights: France march onto semi-finals, beat England 2-1 FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France, Highlights: Full time!

Playing only his 10th ODI, the 24-year-old displayed fearless batting as he shattered Chris Gayle’s record of fastest (138 balls) double century in the format when he took just 126 balls to the milestone. India posted a huge 409 for eight. He was out for 210 in the 36th over of the Indian innings. “I got out with 15 (14.1) overs left. I could have got 300 also,” Kishan told the broadcasters ‘SonyLiv’ at the innings break. The Jharkhand left-hander became the fourth Indian batter to score a double hundred. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has scored it thrice including his highest ODI score of 264 while Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have scored once each. “I am blessed to hear my name between such legends. The wicket was too good to bat on. My intent was very clear — if the ball is there, I’ll go for it,” he revealed about his strategy. His record-breaking knock came in the company of Virat Kohli and Kishan credited the star India batter to “calm him down” when he was approaching his maiden century. —PTI Could have got to 300, says Ishan Kishan added by Press Trust of India on 12:26 am December 11, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-10 18:56:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Boland’s 3 wickets put Australia in control against Windies","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/11/bolands-3-wickets-put-australia-in-control-against-windies/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Adelaide: Pace bowler Scott Boland took three wickets in an over on Saturday to put Australia in command of the second cricket test against West Indies.

Australia bowled out West Indies for 214 on Day 3 before declaring its second innings on 199-6 early in the last session, setting the visitors a target of 497 to win with more than two days remaining in the day-night match at the Adelaide Oval. Boland (3-9) then entered the attack in the sixth over and snared three second-innings wickets without conceding a run to have the tourists reeling on 15-3. He took a wicket with his first ball, having skipper Kraigg Brathwaite (3) caught behind with a delivery that straightened. Boland also trapped Shamarh Brooks (0) lbw with a delivery that moved back off the seam two balls later and had Jermaine Blackwood (0) caught low at gully by Cameron Green. Left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc (1-11) picked up an unexpected wicket when Tagenarine Chanderpaul, after scoring a watchful 17 from 28 balls, feathered a catch down the legside to wicketkeeper Alex Carey. It was given not out by the on-field umpire but the Australians reviewed, despite Starc and Carey seemingly not convinced there was an edge, and got the reward as West Indies slipped to 21-4 in the 9th over. Devon Thomas and Jason Holder each scored eight to help West Indies reach 38-4 at stumps. It was an eventful day, with West Indies resuming on 102-4 and losing two wickets before adding a run as they quickly surrendered a first-innings lead of 297. Great hope Chanderpaul (47) was run out off the fourth ball of the day when he prodded into space, took off, turned around and was caught short by a Starc direct hit. Nathan Lyon finished with 3-57 while Starc ended up with 2-48 after having Holder caught behind for a duck and dismissing Roston Chase off a hook shot for 34. The Australians showed attacking intent from the start with openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja putting on 77 in 14 overs before Chase slowed things down. Chase, who was wicketless in 30 first-innings overs, took a wicket with his first ball second time around when Warner (28) dragged one back onto his stumps. He claimed another victim two balls later with some genuine turn, when left-hander Khawaja (45) edged to wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva. Chase then took an excellent, low catch at ankle height in the gully to remove Marnus Labuschagne for 31 at the end of the middle session, with Australia on 136-3. It was the first time in four innings this series that Labuschagne didn’t reach a century. Stand-in captain Steve Smith (35) and Travis Head (38 not out) kept the run-rate flowing before Australia declared in a bid to pick up wickets under the lights with the pink ball. The hosts will resume Sunday needing six wickets for a two-test sweep ahead of a three-match series against South Africa starting next weekend. —PTI Boland’s 3 wickets put Australia in control against Windies added by Press Trust of India on 12:22 am December 11, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-10 18:52:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France LIVE Score: Stage set for blockbuster clash as Kane, Mbappe face-off","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/football-quarter-final-england-vs-france-live-score-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-latest-updates-al-bayt-stadium-11788151.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France LIVE Score: Stage set for blockbuster clash as Kane, Mbappe face-off","content":"FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France LIVE Score: Stage set for blockbuster clash as Kane, Mbappe face-off FIFA World Cup 2022, England vs France LIVE Score: Hello and welcome to our LIVE coverage of the FIFA World Cup quarter-final clash between England and France, set to take place at the Al Bayt Stadium.

FirstCricket Staff December 10th, 2022 23:20:31 IST Top-order batter Karun Nair remains one of only two Indians with a Test triple-hundred. AP Ishan Kishan smashed his way into the record books and brought himself back into Team India’s plans for the 2023 World Cup at home with a slam-bang 210 off just 131 deliveries against Bangladesh on Saturday. Kishan’s whirlwind knock not only brought joy back into the lives of Indian cricket fans after their mixed run in recent assignments, helping them collect a sizeable consolation win over the Bangla Tigers, but it also inspired many, including cricketers struggling to revive their international careers such as Karun Nair. Talking points: Kishan heats up opening conundrum, Kohli’s 72nd ton and more Much like Kishan, who had been sidelined from India’s white-ball plans despite his immense potential as the Men in Blue opted to give chances to Rishabh Pant and Dinesh Karthik, Karnataka batter Nair has found himself dropped from the senior team despite being only one of the two Indians with a Test triple-century. “Dear cricket, give me one more chance,” Nair wrote in an emotional tweet, ending it with the ‘crossed-finger’ emoji. Dear cricket, give me one more chance.🤞🏽 — Karun Nair (@karun126) December 10, 2022 The post has since received thousands of retweets and likes and several supportive replies, with former India cricketer Dodda Ganesh writing: “Stay strong, Karun. You will be back. You are still a quality batsman.” Nair made his India debut during the tour of Zimbabwe in the summer of 2016, featuring in two ODIs, and went on to make his Test debut against England at home later that year. During the fifth Test in Chennai against the Englishmen, the Karnataka right-hand batter would become only the second Indian after Virender Sehwag to score a triple hundred in Tests, bringing up the coveted milestone with a boundary and remaining unbeaten on 303 as the hosts declared on 759, later winning the match by an innings and 75 runs. Nair would then feature in the Test series against Australia, but was dropped from the side after the fourth and final Test in Dharamsala and has not represented the country ever since.

FirstCricket Staff December 10th, 2022 21:37:45 IST Virat Kohli and Ishan Kishan stitched a 290-run second-wicket stand to lay the foundation for India's match-winning 409-run total. AP Stand-in India skipper KL Rahul was all praise for both Ishan Kishan and Virat Kohli after Men in Blue registered a thumping 227-run consolation win in the third ODI against Bangladesh in Chattogram on Saturday. Kishan sent out a strong message to the selectors and the Indian team management that had relegated him to the sidelines in the team’s recent white-ball assignments with a 131-ball 210, becoming only the fourth Indian to go past the 200-mark in ODI cricket after Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, and Rohit Sharma. Read: Twitter hails ‘Special Saturday’ as Kishan, Kohli star in India’s thumping win Kishan shared a 290-run second-wicket stand with Kohli, who scored an ODI century after more than three years as India posted a humongous 409/8 on the board. “Brilliant to see how Virat and Ishan batted. The way Kishan started, he was looking aggressive from ball one. He got an opportunity and grabbed it with both hands. “Getting a double hundred in ODIs isn’t done often. Batters were really brave, and we decided to do the same with the ball,” said Rahul, who took over the reigns after Rohit Sharma’s injury. Bangladesh, in reply, were never in the hunt as they lost wickets from the word go and were hardly given the room to accelerate or build momentum-shifting partnerships by a disciplined bowling attack. The Bangla Tigers, who had pulled off victories from the jaws of defeat in the first two one-dayers in Dhaka, were bundled out for 182, suffering their second-largest ODI defeat as a result.

FirstCricket Staff December 10th, 2022 21:29:19 IST Ishan Kishan broke multiple records with his double century. AP India smashed hosts Bangladesh in the final ODI of the three-match series with an emphatic 227-run win after posting a mammoth 409 runs in the first innings. Ishan Kishan (210) and Virat Kohli (113) were the standout performers as the duo stitched a 290-run partnership for the second wicket and almost took Bangladesh out of the contest. Though inconsequential, the win resulted in India creating multiple new records with the bat. However, India will have a lot to ponder after the series defeat, and cannot let the emphatic win take over the emotions and forget about the series loss. Here are some important talking points from the match: Ishan Kishan’s innings increases the headache for the opening position Ishan Kishan became the youngest player, the fourth Indian, and the fastest to score a 200 in 126 deliveries. In Numbers | Ishan Kishan’s 200 that broke multiple records The southpaw smashed 24 boundaries and 10 maximums in his innings. Interestingly, his first 100 runs came at a relatively slow pace from 85 deliveries, while his next hundred runs came in a blistering 41 deliveries. While Kishan achieved the milestone of third highest score by an Indian in ODIs, he also created more confusion for the opening position. The selectors seem to pursue Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma as the first-choice openers but Dhawan has not done any good to his chances after scoring 18 runs in three games. On the other hand, Shubman Gill has already been knocking at the doors with excellent consistency in whatever chances he has been allowed in ODIs. Kishan’s double century will only increase the headache for the selectors and Rahul Dravid. Ishan Kishan: ‘Could have got 300’ Virat Kohli’s century teases return to form in all formats Star batter Virat Kohli broke his century fast and registered an ODI century after 1214 days, ie more than three years. Kohli was constantly under the radar for the absence of centuries since 2019 and a lack of runs in all the formats. However, he came back to his imperious best during the T20 Asia Cup with a string of fifties and capped it with a century against Afghanistan. Kohli also continued his form in the T20 World Cup ending as the highest run-getter but failed to contribute in the first two ODIs as India lost an ODI series in Bangladesh for a second time. With 113 off 91 deliveries in Chattogram on Saturday, Kohli has scored centuries in two formats of the game this year and holds a chance to complete 2022 with a century in each format. Liton Das: Virat Kohli’s and Ishan Kishan’s knocks cost us the game Washington Sundar gives another all-round option to Indian selectors Washington Sundar has contributed in a marvelous manner both with the bat and the ball in the recent ODIs. Sundar played a useful hand scoring 37 runs in the third ODI, taking his overall tally to 67 in three games. He also batted to the rescue of Indian batters in the previous series against New Zealand scoring 51 and 37 not out in two games. Ishan Kishan’s astounding batting performance got everyone talking! 👌 👌 Some high praises in there for the record setter 👏 👏 Scorecard 👉 https://t.co/HGnEqugMuM #TeamIndia | #BANvIND | @ishankishan51 pic.twitter.com/ikoxs2daqg — BCCI (@BCCI) December 10, 2022 Sundar also managed to bag six wickets in the three ODIs against Bangladesh and displayed his worth as an all-rounder in the absence of Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya. While India have been struggling to find fast bowling all-rounders, they have plenty in the spin department and Sundar can be added to the group of top players who are on the international circuit. However, it will be worthwhile to see the opportunities he gets once Jadeja and Pandya return to action. Mehidy Hasan’s heroics for Bangladesh While India dominated the third ODI, the victory shall not get over the fact that Bangladesh defeated India in the first two ODIs and won their second consecutive ODI series. Mehidy Hasan was primarily responsible for guiding his side home and was rightly given the Player of the Series award as well. Mehidy stitched a brilliant partnership with Mustafizur Rahman for the 10th wicket and won the match for Bangladesh after they had lost all hopes, requiring 51 runs. Twitter Reactions | ‘Special Saturday’ as Kishan, Kohli star in Men in Blue’s thumping 227-run win As if that was not enough, the spin all-rounder scored a match-winning hundred in the second ODI and salvaged Bangladesh’s innings with a 148-run seventh-wicket partnership after they were stuttering at 69/6 at the 19-overs mark. Mehidy’s heroics has ensured that Bangladesh continued their golden run in the ODIs and bagged home another series.

Playing only his 10th ODI, the 24-year-old displayed fearless batting as he shattered Chris Gayle’s record of fastest (138 balls) double century in the format when he took just 126 balls to the milestone. India posted a huge 409 for eight. He was out for 210 in the 36th over of the Indian innings. “I got out with 15 (14.1) overs left. I could have got 300 also,” Kishan told the broadcasters ‘SonyLiv’ at the innings break. The Jharkhand left-hander became the fourth Indian batter to score a double hundred. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has scored it thrice including his highest ODI score of 264 while Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have scored once each. “I am blessed to hear my name between such legends. The wicket was too good to bat on. My intent was very clear — if the ball is there, I’ll go for it,” he revealed about his strategy. His record-breaking knock came in the company of Virat Kohli and Kishan credited the star India batter to “calm him down” when he was approaching his maiden century. “I was batting with Virat bhai, and he was spot on with which bowlers I needed to select [to target]. I was on 95 and wanted to bring up the hundred with a six but he calmed me down, saying it was my first hundred, get it in singles as it’s your first,” he said. In fact, Kishan said that he was tempted to hit Mustafizur Rahaman for a six if he had bowled a slow cutter but he went and told Kohli that “please remind me that I need to take singles” as he didn’t want let the opportunity of a double pass by. Kishan is very close to Suryakumar Yadav, who has told him to bat before the start of the game. “I had a chat with Surya bhai – he said when you bat before the game, you see the ball well. I didn’t take too much pressure on myself. Just wanted to make use of the opportunity,” Kishan said. Kishan said the wicket was perfect for stroke-making, and it provided him the perfect platform to showcase his big-hitting skills. “I think it was a perfect wicket to bat on. Perfect situation for me as well. Was looking to watch the ball properly and go with the flow,” he said. “After looking at the wicket, I knew it was going to play well. Was trying to smash the loose balls.” He also lauded the contributions of his senior teammates and support staff. “I think when you have so many senior players in the team. We have been doing conversations. Here at the international stage, you try to get a lot when you get a few. I got a lot of help from the support staff. I was just picking the ball and the bowlers.

FirstCricket Staff December 10th, 2022 21:22:36 IST Ishan Kishan and Virat Kohli brought India back on their feet after the early dismissal of Shikhar Dhawan with a 290-run second-wicket stand. AP India were back to winning ways on Saturday, registering a thumping 227-run victory over Bangladesh in the third and final ODI at Chattogram, finishing with a consolation win before they turn their attention to the two-Test series. The Men in Blue had suffered narrow defeats in Dhaka, by one wicket and five runs respectively, to surrender yet another ODI series in Bangladesh after having lost by a 2-1 margin under MS Dhoni’s leadership in 2015. On Saturday, however, the Indian team lived up to its full potential as it dominated the hosts both with bat and ball to walk away with one of their biggest victories ever. Read: ‘Could have got 300,’ says Ishan Kishan after record-breaking knock Opener Ishan Kishan made the most of the opportunity handed to him on the day after having spent a lot of time on the sidelines in India’s recent assignments, smashing 210 to power the visitors a commanding 409/8 after being invited to bat by Bangladeshi skipper Litton Das. Not only did he bring up his maiden international hundred, he also ended up breaking West Indian great Chris Gayle’s six-year-old record for the fastest double-hundred in ODIs. The Indian bowling department, which was guilty of letting the Bangla Tigers off the hook from dominant positions in the first two games, was equally clinical as they struck at regular intervals to bundle the hosts out for 182. All-rounder Shardul Thakur was the pick of the Indian bowlers with 3/30, while Axar Patel (2/22) and Umran Malik (2/43) snared two wickets each. Read: Kishan’s fastest 200 and other stats from India’s solid batting display India’s performance, especially the fireworks produced by India and Mumbai Indians keeper-bat Kishan, drew praises on social media especially microblogging website Twitter. We take a look at some of the most interesting of those reactions here: I cannot put into words what I’m feeling right now but I’ll try. I’m overwhelmed by the love, the messages, the wishes. This is an innings that will stay in my heart forever, a day that I won’t forget, and these moments that I’ll always carry with me.

(AP Photo/Surjeet Yadav) Bangladesh suffered a heavy defeat to India in the third and final ODI in Chattogram on Saturday, and the hosts’ skipper Litton Das admitted that Virat Kohli’s and Ishan Kishan’s match-winning knocks were what cost them the match. India rode on a century from Virat Kohli (113) and Ishan Kishan (210) to post a mammoth total of 409/8 after being asked to bat first, but in reply, Bangladesh were bundled out for just 182 inside 34 overs. Despite India’s victory in the third ODI, Bangladesh still managed to win the series 2-1, having won the opening two matches. India were missing permanent skipper Rohit Sharma, and were captained by KL Rahul. Rahul himself managed only eight runs, but Kohli and Kishan’s knocks were vital. “The way Ishan and Virat batted, that cost us the game. The way Ishan batted, hats off to him. Our bowlers tried our best but there was no way out on this wicket. Had we been chasing 330-340, it would have been a different ball game. They are a good side. We played good cricket and will help our confidence,” said Litton Das at the post-match presentation ceremony at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. The two teams will next lock horns in a two-Test series, starting on 14 December at the same venue in Chattogram. It remains to be seen if Rohit Sharma will be available for the Test series.

FP Sports December 10, 2022 19:21:20 IST File image of Nita Ambani. Nita Ambani, India’s International Olympic Committee (IOC) member and Founder Chairperson of Reliance Foundation, on Saturday congratulated legendary athlete PT Usha on becoming the president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). One of India’s most successful athletes and a flag-bearer of Indian sports globally, PT Usha was elected as the President of IOA, on Saturday along with a new Executive Council. With this, PT Usha becomes the first woman President in the history of IOA. Congratulating PT Usha, Nita Ambani said it was a landmark moment for Indian sport and a giant leap forward in strengthening India’s Olympic movement. “It gives me immense joy to welcome Smt. PT Usha as the first woman President of the Indian Olympic Association. I remember watching her with pride as she represented our country and won laurels for India. She has been a towering inspiration to millions as an athlete, and I am sure she will shine in this new role as well. Our women athletes have led the charge in making India a global sporting powerhouse, and I’m delighted to see so many women representatives now in IOA’s Executive Council,” said Nita Ambani. “I congratulate all newly elected IOA members and look forward to partnering with them. This is a landmark moment for Indian sport and a giant leap forward in strengthening the Olympic Movement in our country,” she added. Mrs Ambani has been a strong endorser of making India a multi-sport nation with an ‘athlete first’ policy and the importance of the contribution by women both on and off the field. Reliance Foundation has been working extensively towards the holistic development of athletes to support them with 360-degree initiatives which include providing world-class sporting facilities, coaching and best-in-class assistance in sports science and medicine. The elections were held as part of IOA’s newly amended constitution which was presented to the IOA General Body in a Special General Meeting on November 10. Among its amendments are steps to introduce greater athlete representation with 8 sportspersons of outstanding merit (SOMs) and greater representation for women in various administrative and voting positions. Smt. Ambani had lauded the amendments and the greater representation of athletes and women in the newly amended IOA constitution.

India’s victory in a dead rubber was effectively set up by left-handed opener Ishan Kishan smashing the fastest double hundred in the history of men’s ODI cricket in 126 balls, breaking the previous record of 138-ball double-century by West Indies’ Chris Gayle in the 2015 ODI World Cup against Zimbabwe in Canberra. Also Read Records broken by Men in Blue in today’s match against Bangladesh When he got out for 210 off 131 balls, converting his maiden ODI ton into a double-hundred, Kishan had more records against his name — the highest individual score by a batter in men’s ODIs in Bangladesh, as well as the highest score by an Indian batter outside of the home. His 210 is also the third-highest individual score by an Indian men’s batter in this format. Kishan, 24, also became the fourth Indian to hit a double hundred in ODIs after Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma as well as the seventh men’s batter overall to achieve the feat, alongside Gayle, Martin Guptill and Fakhar Zaman. He’s also the youngest to hit a double hundred in menis ODI cricket. Kishan also added 290 runs for the second wicket with Virat Kohli, who made his 44th ODI hundred, and his first in the format since August 2019, also his 72nd international hundred, through a 91-ball 113 as India made 409/8 in their 50 overs. Chasing 410 was always going to be difficult for Bangladesh. Axar Patel broke the 33-run opening stand on the first ball of the fifth over when Anamul Haque holed out to long-off. Three overs later, Litton Das hit straight to the mid-off fielder off Mohammed Siraj. Axar got his second wicket as Mushfiqur Rahim went for the sweep but was castled. Eight overs later, Yasir Ali was trapped lbw by Umran Malik in a successful review by India. Shakib Al Hasan was accumulating runs in his steady flow but chopped onto his stumps off Kuldeep Yadav. As Mahmudullah was trapped lbw by Washington Sundar and burnt a review while Mehidy Hasan Miraz didn’t produce any heroics with the bat, the result was all but a foregone conclusion as India registered a crushing victory. Brief scores: India 409/8 in 50 overs (Ishan Kishan 210, Virat Kohli 113; Shakib Al Hasan 2-68, Ebadot Hossain 2-80) beat Bangladesh 182 all out in 34 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 43, Litton Das 29; Shardul Thakur 3-30, Axar Patel 2-22) by 227 runs Follow Us : Tags Bangladesh India ODI Related News IND v BAN, 3rd ODI: Ishan Kishan double hundred, Virat Kohli century propel India to 409/8 IPL over India’s pride?

Hakim Ziyech-starring Arabian nation stunned Spain in the round-of-16 on penalties to reach the last eight stages for the first time while Portugal walloped Switzerland 6-1. Read below for complete match preview Not only was the five-time world player of the year relegated to the bench, his replacement — 21-year-old Gonçalo Ramos — scored a hat trick to leave Santos with quite the selection dilemma against Morocco. FIFA World Cup: Fixtures | Results | Points Table | Squads | Records “I hope he won’t (play),” Morocco coach Walid Regragui said Friday of Ronaldo. “As a coach I know he’s one of the best players in history and so I’d be delighted if he didn’t play.” The announcement of Portugal’s team about 90 minutes before the game at Al Thumama Stadium is keenly awaited as Ronaldo prepares to play in the quarterfinals of the World Cup for just the second time in his glittering career. Santos declined to share selection thoughts Friday for what he said would be a different kind of game to the one against Switzerland, while noting that “90% of the questions” are about Ronaldo at Portugal’s pregame news conferences. One inevitable question Santos faced was about reports in national media that Ronaldo threatened to leave the World Cup after being told he was benched. Not true, the coach said. “He has never told me that he wanted to leave the national team,” Santos said through an interpreter. “Cristiano obviously wasn’t very happy about it. He told me ‘Do you really think it’s a good idea?’” Portugal is at this stage for only the third time after 1966 and 2006, perhaps surprising given the talent to have come from the country down the years. Four years ago, Portugal lost in the round of 16 to Uruguay, though a group-stage game against Morocco was “possibly the most difficult match” the team faced, Santos said Friday. “We won 1-0 but we had to suffer a lot to win that match,” he said. “My players know that.” As for Morocco, the nation is in uncharted territory after becoming only the fourth African country to reach the quarterfinals at soccer’s biggest tournament, after Cameroon (1990), Senegal (2002) and Ghana (2010). None of them reached the semifinals. Morocco is also the only team from outside Europe or South America to make it to the last eight in Qatar. The team’s penalty-shootout victory over Spain in the last 16 sparked wild celebrations not just among its many fans in Qatar and at home. The excitement extended to the Moroccan diaspora of around 5 million people spread mostly around Europe, which has united behind the World Cup run of the team nicknamed the “Atlas Lions.” Morocco fans poured into the streets of European cities to celebrate the team’s passage to the quarterfinals, which came after Morocco advanced from a group containing second-ranked Belgium and 2018 runner-up Croatia. “We haven’t got carried away by the euphoria,” Regragui said. “We’ve just surprised a few people and surprised a few algorithms who expected Belgium to get through … and expected Spain to get through. We are not satisfied with where we have come so far.” Regragui, who was born in France, and 14 of the 26 players in the squad were born abroad — the highest proportion for any team at a World Cup being held in the Middle East for the first time in the tournament’s 92-year history. The Arab world’s standard bearer, Morocco is in the quarterfinals on merit, too. The team has only conceded one goal — and that was an own-goal against Canada — and is proving so well-organized, with a sturdy back four headlined by Achraf Hakimi, a dedicated midfield anchored by Sofyan Amrabat, two mercurial wingers in Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal, and a striker in Youssef En-Nesyri, who occupies defenses with his relentless work rate. Three key players might be struggling to be healthy enough to play against Portugal, though. Amrabat said he played with a back injury requiring painkilling injections in the match against Spain, during which captain Romain Saiss finished the game with his leg bandaged up after treatment, and fellow center back Nayef Aguerd hobbled off in tears with an apparent thigh injury. “Yes, they are tired, yes, we have injuries. We are not going to hide it and we are not going to complain,” Regragui said. “We are here on a mission.” Portugal doesn’t appear to have such problems, with Santos’ squad depth so impressive that he could afford to leave players like Ronaldo, João Cancelo and Rúben Neves on the bench against Switzerland after they started every group game. Even if he is among the substitutes again, Ronaldo — playing in what is likely his last World Cup — is expected to see some time on the field. Given the drama constantly surrounding him, he’s sure to be a talking point whatever happens.

Many records have been broken in a century such as double century in ODI cricket at a young age, fastest double century, first international double century. Virat Kohli at the other end ended his century drought since August 2019 with 11 brilliant fours and 2 sixes off 91 balls. And that six shot for century is really a class type, you can see it if you cross your front leg and lift it over square leg. Stunning shot. With this, Kohli broke Ricky Ponting’s century record with his 72nd international century, now only ahead of him is legendary Sachin Tendulkar. If Kohli and Ishan Kishan combined to achieve a partnership of 280 runs in about 30 overs, the level of action of Ishan Kishan can be estimated. The Indian team reached a huge score of 409/8 in 50 overs. Bangladesh team won the toss and chose to field first, but Liton Das dropped the catch as soon as Virat came to the wicket, that’s where they made a big mistake. Virat Kohli led Ishan Kishan beautifully, he decided to support him and took a nice single, giving him more strike and encouraging him to bat, which was a big inspiration for Ishan Kishan’s carnage of Bangladesh bowling today. Ishan Kishan was widely mocked and mocked for doing nothing in the last IPL series when he was auctioned for Rs 15 crore. But this greatest ODI innings, the all-time greatest ODI innings, is proof that he never lost faith in his abilities. Shikhar Dhawan’s stint in the Indian team came to an end today. His scores in these 3 ODIs are 7, 8, and 3. Kohli joins Ishan Kishan at 15/1. Already Ishan Kishan had brilliantly scored 30 runs off the off side with 5 boundaries. The score was 49/1 after 11 overs and was going slowly. Ishan Kishan started his aggressive action from the 12th over. Ebadat Hussain comes in and hits him at point for a cut shot boundary. Then a leg bye for 4 runs, then a short pitched ball that flies over deep midwicket on a pull shot for a six. 18 runs in this over alone to hit another short pitched ball into a tennis shot for a straight boundary. Ishan scored his half-century in 49 balls after Shakib knocked the ball away. After that, Ishan Kishan started hitting wherever and whenever, and Bangladesh’s bowling blossomed. Ishan Kishan blasted Duskin Ahmed for a six in his 2nd bullshot, and Abeeb Ahmed hit a terrific sweep shot at the end to bring up his century in 83 balls with a boundary. As Satam saw another new frenzy entered his body. Ebadat hits Hussain at deep square leg for a six. Then he edged Shakib Al Hasan to empty extra-cover for a boundary and came down in the same over for a six at midwicket. Then again in the same over with his front leg out for a frantic six over midwicket. 20 runs came in the 27th over. In the next over, counter-spinner King Kohli scored his half-century off 54 balls. Ishan Kishan, who came on strike after being bowled by Mehdi Hasan, hit him with a slow sweep shot to deep square leg for a big six to easily reach the milestone of 150 off 103 balls. That means a century in 83 balls and a milestone 150 in the next 20 balls!! Next ball he hit a straight bat for a boundary to celebrate his 150. Now Ishaan Kishan became more aggressive in the attack no matter where it was put, Ebadat Hussain hit a slow delivery for a one-handed boundary punt style. Mehdi comes in and knocks him on his knees for another six over deep midwicket. A boundary as the straight ball breaks again and then an inside out extra cover boundary in the same over. India 246/1 at the end of 30th over. Ishan Kishan made 179 off 113 balls with 20 fours and 9 sixes. Mustafizur hit the ball with a shot for an upper cut boundary over third man to reach the highest ODI score of Ganguly, Dhoni and Kohli with 183. Then Ishan Kishan reached 197 runs after hitting 2 boundaries in Duskin Ahmed’s over. Next, Ishan Kishan took a single off length yorker Mustafizur and scored a world record double century in 126 balls. It was only the 36th over when Tuskin hit another six and a boundary for 210 runs. If he had played 50 overs, Ishan Kishan would have become the first man to score a triple century in ODI cricket. Curiosity piqued… But in the same over, Duskin’s length ball was lifted straight and caught inches short of the boundary line. Ishan Kishan has shown that this is how Bangladesh should bowl, and if we had fielded him with the same attitude in the first 2 matches, we would not have lost this series. It was disastrous for the Indian team to go there and lose when the likes of Afghanistan’s Gurbaz and Ibrahim Sadran turned Bangladesh’s bowling upside down but Ishan Kishan overturned it with this double century. It should be said that this innings is a combination of action by Chris Gayle, Sehwag, Adam Gilchrist and Jayasuriya. If they play, the opponents will struggle to set the field and give up in the end, today, when Ishan Kishan suddenly started hitting, the Bangladesh team suddenly woke up and was stunned. Hit wherever you put it. What can be done if it is hit anyway? This is how Bangladesh should bowl. Sehwag immediately praised Ishan Kishan’s innings and wrote on his Twitter page, “This is how you should play!! Brilliant Ishan Kishan. Such an approach will do the Indian team a lot of good,” he said. The king of action has said that this is the game! Ishaan Kishan should dance like this! He can no longer be dropped from the team and left on the bench.","pubDate":"2022-12-10 12:58:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Records broken by Men in Blue in today’s match against Bangladesh","link":"https://telanganatoday.com/records-broken-by-men-in-blue-in-todays-match-against-bangladesh","keywords":["Cricket","News","Sport","Ishan Kishan","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Telangana Today"],"video_url":null,"description":"An under-fire Indian team after losing its first two ODI matches to Bangladesh has clawed its way back.

The team India rode on Ishan Kishan’s maiden double century and Virat Kohli’s 44th century to establish a mammoth total of 409 runs on the scoreboard and shatter a slew of records along the way. Virat became the highest run scorer for India against Bangladesh in ODIs as he amassed 807 runs in 15 matches against the neighbors. The record was previously held by Rohit Sharma, with 807 runs from 15 innings. Besides, he also became the highest run-getter for Men in Blue against Bangladesh across all three formats (T20I, ODI, & Test). Virat Kohli also made history by becoming the fastest player to score 44 centuries in ODIs. The 290-run partnership between Virat Kohli and Ishan Kishan is the third-highest partnership for India in ODIs. Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid hold the record for stitching the highest run partnership of 331 for India. Ishan Kishan is now the seventh batsman in the world and the fourth Indian to score a double century in the history of international cricket. In the past, players like Sachin Tendulkar (200*), Rohit Sharma (264, 209 & 208*), Virender Sehwag (219), Marti Guptill (237*), Chris Gayle (215), and Fakhar Zaman (210), have scored double centuries for their respective teams. The southpaw also became the youngest (24 years) and the fastest cricketer (200 off 126 balls) to score a double ton in world cricket. Team India posted their fourth-highest total in ODIs – 409. This is the 6th time India has gone past the 400-run mark in ODIs, with India’s highest score being 418.","pubDate":"2022-12-10 12:48:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
