Ellis charged 40 yards towards mid-wicket and was engulfed by his jumping and rejoicing team-mates. There were bangs and explosions as the pyrotechnics were let off. Hampshire and everybody in the crowd thought they had won by four runs. But suddenly people noticed that umpire Graham Lloyd – son of former England coach David ‘Bumble’ Lloyd – had his arm extended for a no-ball.

He and Tom Hartley were able to scamper only a bye and Lancashire really had won this time by one run.  Lancashire thought the ball should still have been alive to allow the chance of a second bye to tie the match. But the umpires ruled the ball dead as Hampshire players were pulling stumps out the ground. Lancashire captain Dane Vilas said: “The umpires use technology for everything else so we’d have liked them to ask for a replay to see if we completed two runs.” Hampshire’s James Vince finally lifts the trophy aloft after an amazing climaxGetty Most read in Cricket TOP BOY Reece Topley gets best England ODI figures EVER to down India at Lord's MOR THE MERRIER Jos Buttler gives Eoin Morgan two bottles of wine worth £880 COW CORNER Watch hilarious fake IPL held on FARM as scammers arrested for conning bettors HIT FOR SIX Chaos at England Test match vs New Zealand as fight breaks out in stands A SPIN OFF All the TV info and fixtures for England's 2022 schedule THORPE HOSPITAL DASH Legendary England batsman in hospital after falling seriously ill Hampshire captain James Vince insisted: “Dane came onto the field and was questioning the umpires. But they weren’t going to run two to the wicketkeeper so I’m not sure what he meant.” Ellis added: “My heart sank when I saw the umpire’s arm sticking out – we’d been celebrating for 30 seconds. But James got us all together, let us take a breath and made sure everyone was aware of the situation.” If the scores had been level, Lancashire would have won because they scored more runs in the power play. The first decider – number of wickets lost – was level at eight down for each team.  Hampshire really should not have been in the frame because Lancashire rushed to 72-1 in the eighth over chasing a modest target of 152.  But Vince has at his disposal the best bowling attack in the tournament and they started taking wickets and suffocating runs.  They join Leicestershire as the only counties to win the domestic T20 event three times. Hampshire did not have any England players missing while Lancashire were able to include Matt Parkinson and Phil Salt, who were released by England from the one-day international squad. But Jos Buttler and Liam Livingstone had to stay in Manchester preparing for today’s series-decider against India.

Parkinson has been around the England squad for a number of years but receives only limited opportunities. And he has been dumped from the 50-over and T20s squad to face South Africa over the next fortnight with Adil Rashid returning from the Hajj pilgrimage. England think Parkinson bowls too slowly but he was quick enough to dismiss four of Hampshire’s best batsmen – including Aussie Ben McDermott, who plundered 62 from 35 balls. Parkinson also took 1-18 from three overs in the high-scoring semi-final against Yorkshire when the Red Rose men chased 205 for victory with eight balls to spare.  Hampshire beat Somerset by 37 runs in the other semi-final.","pubDate":"2022-07-16 22:45:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs ENG 3rd ODI: Suryakumar Yadav opens up on Rohit Sharma's impact on his career, says THIS","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-eng-3rd-odi-suryakumar-yadav-opens-up-on-rohit-sharmas-impact-on-his-career-says-this-2486170.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Asked about his mind set, Suryakumar Yadav said he approaches 50-over cricket the same way as he goes about batting in T20s.","content":"IND vs ENG 3rd ODI 2022: India batter Suryakumar Yadav has emerged as one of India's brightest talent from domestic cricket. He did well in domestic scene for a long time but it was only after his exploits in the Indian Premer League (IPL) that he came into limelight. Back in 2011, it was the current captain Rohit Sharma who said good things about him, a tweet that went viral soon after Suryakumar smashed his maiden T20 ton vs England in the third T20I. He has great camaraderie with Rohit and on Saturday, on the eve of the third and last ODI vs England, he spoke about it with the media in detail. He said that the skipper has helped him a lot with his batting since his domestic cricket days. Apart from sharing the Indian dressing room, both Rohit and Suryakumar represented Mumbai in domestic cricket and play for the same IPL side, Mumbai Indians. \"Camaraderie has been really good. He's been watching me and talking about my cricket since I played domestic cricket,\" Suryakumar said on the eve of the third ODI between India and England.

I would like to pay back that confidence by scoring runs and winning the game for the team.\" Asked about his mind set, Suryakumar said he approaches 50-over cricket the same way as he goes about batting in T20s. \"My mind set is the same in ODI, I try to bat similar to how I do in T20. Playing the natural game is important and there is an advantage in one days that five fielders are inside the circle so the intent is always to score runs.

After almost two months of high-octane battle between 18 English county sides, the day for the grand finale has arrived, and it is Lancashire who would take on Hampshire at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham in just a few minutes from now. During the semi-final clashes – both of which were held today itself at Edgbaston, Lancashire got the better of Yorkshire during the first semi-final, while Hampshire prevailed against Somerset during the second, to progress towards the grand finale which would also take place today itself. A couple of fine half-century knocks by Tom Kohler-Cadmore (66 off 44) and Jordan Thompson (50 off 18) did help Yorkshire post 204/7 in their 20 Overs, but the total was just not enough for Lancashire as their skipper Dane Vilas (63* off 36) and opener Keaton Jennings (75 off 51) played gem of knocks despite the scoreboard pressure to chase the target down in 18.4 Overs, and provide their side a chance to lift the title for the second time in history. Later in the day, the Somerset batters succumbed to the scoreboard pressure as all they could manage was to post 153 on the board, en route the target of 191 handed by Hampshire. 19-year-old Tom Prest (64 off 46) played the match-winning knock for Hampshire, who would now give it their all to lift the title for the third time in 20 editions of the tournament.

Sunday at Old Trafford in Manchester will see both England and India take the field to decide who ends this trip on a high: hosts on visitors.With less than 18 months to go for the 2023 Men's Cricket World Cup to be hosted by India, the three-match series has been a medium for England to see how they are standing in life post Eoin Morgan's retirement and what they would need more to firm up their plans for a title defence in the subcontinent. After being blown away by Jasprit Bumrah's six-fer at The Oval, England gave the same treatment to India at Lord's through tall left-arm quick Reece Topley's 6-24, with good support from fellow left-arm quick David Willey and lower-order runs of Willey as well as Moeen Ali rescuing them from a top-six meltdown after Yuzvendra Chahal struck in middle overs. They would like for Jason Roy to find his mojo back at the top. For India, the opening pair of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan chased down 111 at The Oval without breaking a sweat. But at Lord's, where England had helpful conditions, they were just unable to break free, as the hosts made swift inroads to bounce back in the series. The pressure from Topley and Willey was such that Rishabh Pant got out for a two-ball duck off a full toss from pacer Brydon Carse trying to make a case for himself as a middle-overs enforcer. The scrutiny lens on talismanic batter Virat Kohli is set to go up a notch, too. Kohli's prolonged lean patch has been the burning question and a matter of intense debate among cricket followers, especially with a Men's T20 World Cup in Australia just three months away. Another low score at Manchester will increase the decibel levels on Kohli's lean patch, who has been without an international century since November 2019.

It is delicately poised at 1-1 after comprehensive victories for both sides at the Oval and Lord’s, respectively. England produced a sublime performance with the ball to win by 100 runs in the last game. All of the hosts’ bowlers were good, but Reece Topley was the standout, finishing with career-best figures of 6/24 – an England ODI record. Buttler’s side had looked to be short of runs after scoring 246 but it proved to be more than enough, and it was the perfect response to their crushing defeat at the Oval. India had cruised to a ten-wicket win after bowling the home side out for 110. So it all comes down to this match to decide who will be the winner of this series in which ball has dominated bat, but with Old Trafford known to favour batters, can the narrative change? The third ODI between England and India will take place on Tuesday, July 17. The action at Old Trafford is set to get underway at 11am. The third ODI will be broadcast on and Sky Sports Cricket with coverage starting at 10:30am. The match will also be available on NowTV through a day pass or a monthly subscription. Updates will also be live on talkSPORT throughout the day. To tune in to talkSPORT or talkSPORT 2 through the website, click HERE for the live stream .

This would mean Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes would play. Stokes will sit out the T20s against South Africa, so expect to see him involved one more time for the limited-overs side this summer. Meanwhile, India have a plethora of options, both bowling and batting and could choose to rotate their squad. Virat Kohli has struggled badly in England, so Sharma might decide to take the former captain out of the firing line. But both teams have no injuries to worry about, so fans should see some great players on display, no matter what. England white-ball captain Jos Buttler: “Today the positivity we showed with the bat is actually what enabled us to get up to the score that we did. “I think we can bat better. Absolutely we can, but instead of playing it safe and allowing the bowlers to just settle in on a length, we actually were proactive and played some positive shots, which I think earned us a few extra runs than potentially we may have got. “That’s something we’ve tried to do as a team for a long time, play with a certain level of intensity and positivity when we bat. We could have got more, but we know that there’s a hell of a lot of experience in the batting line-up, and I have so much trust in whoever’s in the middle, to make the right call at the time, and the whole dressing room will always back those guys. “It’s always been a real strength of the team that we have a lot of allrounders, a lot of our bowlers are very capable batsman. So that’s been a theme for the team, it allows us to be more positive because we know we bat deep into our team. “We felt like we were a few short at the halfway stage, but very much in the game if we could take early wickets, and I thought we bowled outstandingly well, the guys set the tone at the top and we all followed.” 888sport – Get 100% Bonus up to £100* – CLAIM HERE £/$/€10 min deposit using promo code “TOP100” • The bonus will be applied once the full deposit amount has been wagered at least twice with cumulative odds of 1.50 or greater • To withdraw any winnings from your bonus, you must wager the bonus amount up to 5 times­ • All deposit and bonus wagering requirements must be completed within 60 days • This offer may not be combined with any other offer • Wagering limit of £/$/€50 per bet Applies • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & full T&Cs apply. 18+ Begambleaware.org SEE MORE FREE BET OFFERS HERE","pubDate":"2022-07-16 15:41:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli \"Didn't Score 70 Tons Playing Candy Crush\": Ex-Pakistan Star's Out Of The Box Take On St.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9jcmlja2V0L3ZpcmF0LWtvaGxpLWRpZG50LXNjb3JlLTcwLXRvbnMtcGxheWluZy1jYW5keS1jcnVzaC1leC1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zdGFycy1vdXQtb2YtdGhlLWJveC10YWtlbi1vbi1zdGFyLTMxNjQ2NDjSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC92aXJhdC1rb2hsaS1kaWRudC1zY29yZS03MC10b25zLXBsYXlpbmctY2FuZHktY3J1c2gtZXgtcGFraXN0YW4tc3RhcnMtb3V0LW9mLXRoZS1ib3gtdGFrZW4tb24tc3Rhci0zMTY0NjQ4L2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli \"Didn't Score 70 Tons Playing Candy Crush\": Ex-Pakistan Star's Out Of The Box Take On St..  NDTV SportsDon't pull Virat Kohli down, those 70 hundreds weren't scored in aunt's backyard: Shoaib Akhtar  Times of India'No normal player can score 70 centuries.

After humbling England with a 10-wicket defeat in the first of the three-match ODI series at The Oval, team India were overpowered in the second ODI at the Lord’s, suffering a massive 100-run defeat, to take the high-octane series into the decider on Sunday at the Emirates Old Trafford in Manchester. While the bowlers turned up with impressive back-to-back performances, it was the famous Indian batting line-up that led them down, as English left-arm pacer Reece Topley with his six-wicket haul, went on to register the record of notching-up the best ever figures by an England bowler in ODI cricket. The final action of India’s all-format tour to England would take place in Manchester tomorrow, with team India, led by Rohit Sharma, having their eyes on their first ODI bilateral series win on England soil since 2014.

Also, with the venue set to host its first ODI since September 2020 tomorrow, one can expect runs on offer aplenty, with teams having posted scores in excess of 290 six times in the last nine ODIs here. Having said that, during the ongoing T20 Blast matches at this ground, teams have not gone on to post humongous scores while batting first, thereby suggestive of decent enough purchase for the bowlers on this wicket as well. Also, akin the first two ODIs of this series, the pacers would get the required purchase on this pitch especially with the new ball in hand, but would find it hard to stop the run flow once the batters get their eye in. All in all, the batters are the ones who would enjoy their time out their in the middle, with teams batting first having won eight of the last nine ODIs at this venue.","pubDate":"2022-07-16 15:22:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs PAK 1st Test Day 1 Highlights: Pakistan Lose Two Wickets On First Day After Sri Lanka Got All Out For 2 - Cricket Country News","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcmlja2V0Y291bnRyeS5jb20vbmV3cy9oaWdobGlnaHRzLXNyaS1sYW5rYS12cy1wYWtpc3Rhbi0xc3QtdGVzdC0yMDIyLWdhbGxlLXBhay1sb3NlLXR3by13aWNrZXRzLWluLWZpcnN0LWlubmluZ3Mtb24tZGF5LW9uZS1hZnRlci1zbC1nb3QtYWxsLW91dC1mb3ItMjIyLXJ1bnMtMTAzMTQ2MtIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SL vs PAK 1st Test Day 1 Highlights: Pakistan Lose Two Wickets On First Day After Sri Lanka Got All Out For 2  Cricket Country NewsSri Lanka vs Pakistan, 1st Test, Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka, 2022  CricbuzzSL vs PAK 1st Test Day 1 Highlights: Pakistan Finish On 24/2 At Stumps, Trail By 198 Runs  India.comSri Lanka vs Pakistan, 1st Test: Hosts hit back after Shaheen Afridi takes four wickets on Day 1 - Firstcricket News  Firstpost'Stronger' Dinesh Chandimal says family, friends got him through tough times  Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-16 14:58:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli goes for a stroll in London park, meets fans and clicks pics ahead of IND vs ENG 3rd ODI - check here","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/virat-kohli-goes-for-a-stroll-in-london-park-meets-fans-and-clicks-pics-ahead-of-ind-vs-eng-3rd-odi-check-here-2486143.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former India captain Virat Kohli is going through a tough period right now in international cricket with runs not coming from his bat.

The team was still in London though till Saturday and it seems they will take the bus early morning on Sunday or late in the evening on Saturday itself for Manchester. The reason we got to know that Indian team was in London only till Saturday was because Virat Kohli was seen taking a stroll at the St Jame's Park in London in the morning. Some pics were shared by a fan on his social media. Kohli met some fans and showed no tantrums when asked for a few pictures to be clicked. He smiled and made the day for some Indian fans in London. Take a look at the pics below. Team India will take on England in the 3rd ODI and the match starts at 3.30 pm IST with the toss set to take place at 3 pm IST. The three-match series is currently tied at 1-1 and both teams will be giving their all to come on top. India captain Rohit Sharma has told the press a number of times that Kohli's form is not a big worry for India. He feel Kohli is a great player and at some point, will get his form back. However, deep down, he must be hoping that his predecessor finds his mojo back in the third ODI. Kohli, on Saturday morning, posted a cryptic tweet as if to tell his critics that his days are not over yet. It was an inspiring quote on not giving up. Kohli has been receiving huge criticism from the likes of Kapil Dev and other former cricketers. Kapil Dev had even gone on record saying that Virat should be dropped from the T20 team if the management feels he is not getting the runs.","pubDate":"2022-07-16 14:57:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Marcus Smith’s stunning 55-yard try sees England complete series win over Australia with tight 21-17 comeback victory in the third Test","link":"https://talksport.com/sport/rugby-union/1151471/marcus-smith-england-rugby-australia-third-test/","keywords":["Rugby Union","Sport","Australia Rugby","England Rugby","England Rugby League","Rugby"],"creator":["Connor Andrews"],"video_url":null,"description":"Marcus Smith’s stunning try helped England claim a Test series victory over Australia with a 21-17 win at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Eddie Jones’ side didn’t have it all their own way, though, having to hold on to take the series 2-1 . Smith’s converted try in the 55th minute of the match gave England plenty of breathing room with a 21-10 lead before a late scare. Folau Fainga’a cut the deficit 11 minutes later to pile pressure onto the home side, who managed to hold on resiliently unlike their first Test collapse. England were 10-3 down towards the end of the first half after Tom Wright’s try, but Freddie Steward pegged the hosts back before Smith’s scintillating 55-yard run. Steward, alongside fellow rookie Tommy Freeman provided a constant threat for the home side, with the Wallabies struggling to contain their pace and smart running lines. It may have marked a changing of the guard of sorts for Jones, who hooked veteran scrum-half Danny Care in the 37th minute after a series of errors, and the decision was rewarded by Jack van Poortvliet. And despite a tricky end to proceedings, the win still marks a significant achievement for England, who take the Ella-Mobbs Cup home to Twickenham with them. Speaking on his stellar performance, Smith said: “It’s a special feeling, such a historic ground, the SCG, and to beat Australia here, and to do it with this group of boys makes it even better. “We’ve bonded so tight over the last few weeks and we were up against it, there was a lot of pressure on us but we backed it up and we delivered and we’ll enjoy tonight. Speaking on his try he added: “I don’t really know what happened! “I just saw the ball bounce and I just thought pick my knees up and sprint as hard as I can. “I thought I was gonna get caught by [Marika] Koroibete but I managed to get there at the end so I enjoyed that one.” 888sport – Get 100% Bonus up to £100* – CLAIM HERE £/$/€10 min deposit using promo code “TOP100” • The bonus will be applied once the full deposit amount has been wagered at least twice with cumulative odds of 1.50 or greater • To withdraw any winnings from your bonus, you must wager the bonus amount up to 5 times­ • All deposit and bonus wagering requirements must be completed within 60 days • This offer may not be combined with any other offer • Wagering limit of £/$/€50 per bet Applies • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & full T&Cs apply. 18+ Begambleaware.org SEE MORE FREE BET OFFERS HERE","pubDate":"2022-07-16 14:07:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Aussie 'smack talk' fuel behind England win","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/rugby/2022-wallabies-vs-england-third-test-smack-talk-fuels-english-win-over-australia/c19a40a0-75e7-4058-b00d-37e858317899","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"England captain Courtney Lawes says the war of words with the Wallabies boosted the team's motivation.","content":"Visiting captain Courtney Lawes says England's win in the Test series decider against the Wallabies was fuelled by the home side \"talking smack\" in the build-up to the finale.

The amount of casualties they've had alone… they did a great job,\" Lawes said. \"They really put us to the test tonight.

That motivated us a bit but the boys stuck together, stuck to our guns. \"We didn't fire that many shots tonight unfortunately but we found a way to win, that's the big improvement.\" Ellis Genge echoed Lawes' sentiment, thriving on the fighting talk. \"Typically the English are better as underdogs,\" said Genge. \"It was hard for us to get up again but they came out in the press and said a bit of smack and it got us up for the last one. Unreal.\" It's the second straight series that England has won touring Australia after a 3-0 whitewash in 2016. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper was humble in defeat, conceding his side didn't do enough to edge out England. \"To come back from 1-0 down, close out the series, you've got to take your hat off to them,\" said Hooper. \"I don't think we were clinical. We created good opportunities tonight, just not good enough to execute them and finish them. \"Obviously we saw, in our review, some opportunity there to move the ball around and affect them. \"There were some areas that hurt us, big moments, right before half time them getting that try obviously a bit of a scrappy ball there where Marcus [Smith] goes the half of the field. \"Some pleasing elements, but this really hurts.\" The Wallabies faced an uphill battle throughout the series, entering every match with at least one high-profile omission due to injury. Hooper hailed the efforts of his team despite the difficult situation. \"I'm forever proud of our group,\" he said. \"We grinded, we played some good footy, we didn't execute how we wanted, but there's so much grit in this group, there's been a lot of adversity. \"I mean, no excuses, we put ourselves in a chance to win it tonight. A shame we couldn't do it here. \"It was a magnificent evening to play rugby in front of a full house. We really enjoyed the crowd's involvement in the game, sorry we couldn't give them a win.\" The Wallabies turn their focus to the Rugby Championship where they'll face New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina each twice across August and September.

But instead of folding as they did in the first Test, on this occasion England showed the resolve to keep the Wallabies out despite sustained late pressure, with Luke Cowan-Dickie and Courtney Lawes combining to secure a critical late turnover. Until play became tighter in the closing stages, full-back Steward and wing Freeman operated as England’s most dangerous players, using their pace, size and clever running lines to good effect. There were shades of 2016 when veteran scrum-half Danny Care was hooked in the 37th minute as the price for an error-ridden display that included a charged-down kick, knock-on and missed tackle. Jones had seen enough and removed Care in the same way he had withdrawn Luther Burrell and Teimana Harrison in the first and third Tests six years ago. On this occasion the change was rewarded with another solid shift from Jack van Poortvliet. It could be the last time Care is seen in an England jersey given he has only just returned following nearly four years in international exile, and the same fate could face Guy Porter after his defensive shortcomings were exposed. Otherwise it was a pleasing day for England, whose scruffy end-of-season performance failed to take the shine off a significant achievement that takes the newly created Ella-Mobbs Cup to Twickenham. Australia had promised to fly out of the blocks after conceding early leads in the first two Tests and they backed up their words with actions as they grabbed the lead through a Noah Lolesio penalty before creating a half-chance down the right. Both sides made errors freely throughout the first half and it was a mistake that cost them a certain try when Nick Frost split a tricky pass from Taniela Tupou as England’s defence began to shake. By now Freeman was starting to cause the Wallabies problems and when Farrell found the posts England were off the mark. Just as Jones’ men were starting hit their stride, however, they were picked apart by a mesmerising try that began when Porter failed to tackle Marika Koroibete in midfield, providing the space for Nic White and Tom Wright to combine until the latter went over. Porter missed a tackle on Reece Hodge and then Koroibete charged through Care as England waved opposition runners through, although a second Farrell penalty at least kept them in the chase. Jones had run out of patience with Care’s error-ridden display and replaced him with Van Portvliet; shortly afterwards Freeman began to run amok out wide until Steward pierced the home defence. Freeman continued to cause problems in the third quarter and England were beginning to take control with a breakaway try from Smith strengthening their position. Moments after sending Ollie Chessum into space with a short pass, Smith leapt on Lolesio’s fumble which was in part a result of interference from Luke Cowan-Dickie and showed his pace to sprint over. Crucial tackles from Van Poortvliet and Steward kept Australia out but the line eventually cracked when replacement hooker Fainga’a burrowed over. England’s lead was now 21-17 but despite the onslaught they were facing, they showed impressive resilience to sweep over the finishing line.","pubDate":"2022-07-16 13:07:46","image_url":"https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjk0ZTA5NDAxLWJmZjYtNDA3NS04YzVkLWY5NDVmMDE2Y2FiMTo3MzFlOTE4ZS03ZTMxLTQ3ZmUtOTRkOS1mNjNlZTk1NTk2M2Y=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"scotsman","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"EXCLUSIVE | Learning from Virat Kohli to hitting maiden 50 in IPL, Here's glimpse of Anuj Rawat's RCB journey","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/exclusive-learning-from-virat-kohli-to-hitting-maiden-50-in-ipl-here-s-glimpse-of-anuj-rawat-s-rcb-journey-2022-07-16-792602","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Anuj Rawat was picked for Rs 3.4 crore by Royal Challengers on the first day of the IPL Mega Auction.

The 22-year-old played eight games for the red army in this year's cricket league. But the match against Mumbai Indians, where he smashed 66 off 42 balls and led RCB closer to victory is what got everyone talking about the rising star. I belong to Ramnagar, Uttarakhand. Looking at my father playing cricket locally, my interest in the game grew. I started learning from him and at the age of nine, I told my father that I want to join the academy as I wanted to play this game forever. First of all, to get selected in the playing squad of Ranji was a different feeling altogether. When I scored 71 runs, I was extremely happy. There were senior players like in the team who encouraged and praised me after the innings. It was my dream as a child to play for the red squad. I was happy at that time, but my parents were happier. We celebrated at our home as there were restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It was my fourth match for the team and it was important for me to put a good score on the board. When I hit a half-century and took the team closer to the win, it was a wonderful moment. I became Man Of the Match and all the players on my team and the coaches appreciated it. They motivated me in the nets as well. Whenever I used to hit the gym, senior players including , , , and , always used to be there keeping themselves busy with one or the other exercise. I learned from Kohli a lot. According to him, no matter how the game ends, you should follow your fitness routine day in and day out. If you are consistence, you will get the desired results. The atmosphere was rare. The entire staff and players were sitting together and cheering for Mumbai. There was a celebration on every boundary and wicket. Looking at the senior players enjoying and rooting, we got more motivated that we want to win no matter what. Irrespective of wickets or drawbacks during the match, we should not stop trying to win the match at any point. How can we bounce back without leaving a slight chance? These are a few examples of what we discussed in the huddles. Yes, there are struggles. But I learned from our former captain, Virat Kohli that wherever you are you should respect that instead of thinking about the lows. There are many people out there who want to be there in your place, you should be grateful and be willing to improve and put the effort to go higher. I feel that there is no fan base like RCB and there are no loyal fans like them. Our supporters were chanting RCB during DC vs MI match and even during Ranji when Rajat Patidar was playing.

That score made it 21-10 to England but the hosts still had a couple of shots to play and replacement hooker Folau Fainga’a made it a nail-biting finish with his score.

Earlier this week, South Africa pulled out of a three-match bilateral ODI against Australia in January as it clashes with their new domestic T20 competition, the third time they will be attempting to have a successful franchise T20 League. The next cycle of the Future Tours Programme (FTP), for 2024-31, which shows the schedule of teams playing bilateral series against each other and at what venues, is set to be confirmed in the upcoming week during the annual conference of the ICC at Birmingham. \"Growth of franchise cricket is impacting the already crammed international cricket calendar. The PCB is concerned about this development and wants the ICC to formulate a strategy on this issue,\" said PCB Chief Executive Faisal Hasnain in a statement. \"We have sent a proposal to the ICC, which they have added to their meeting agenda. Two other boards have also conveyed their apprehensions to the ICC on this matter and urged the ICC to create a working group to debate on the expansion of franchise-based T20 leagues,\" added Hasnain. Talking about the confirmation of the FTP, in the context of Pakistan recently starting to host international cricket at home, Hasnain remarked, \"Finalising the Future Tours Programme (FTP) is very important for us. \"This will give us certainty about which teams will be visiting us and which countries we will be touring. 80 per cent of the FTP has already been agreed upon and the remaining 20 per cent will be completed in the upcoming meeting.\" The upcoming ICC Annual Conference in Birmingham also marks the first time the meeting will happen after a Covid-19 pandemic caused a stoppage. \"The annual conference presents a unique opportunity for networking with representatives of the world cricket. \"We are planning several initiatives that involve fellow members and meetings have already been set up on the sidelines with other boards to collectively enhance our common interest,\" concluded Hasnain. --IANS nr/akm (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","pubDate":"2022-07-16 12:11:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220716/thumb-122071600517.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
