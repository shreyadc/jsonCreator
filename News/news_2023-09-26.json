The general body was apprised about BCCI earning more than 38 per cent from annual revenue generated by the ICC and also Rs 67 crore (approx) per match earning from media rights during the next cycle of bilateral series. \"All routine decisions happened. The list of names for the cricket committees and the sub-committees will be prepared by the office bearers as entrusted by the House. As far as IPL GC is concerned, IPL chairman Arun Dhumal and Avishek Dalmiya were supposed to be elected and it happened on expected lines,\" a state unit representative told PTI. It has also been learnt that Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer will continue as per his contract which is due to expire next year. \"The Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer will continue till June, 2024. He will serve his full contract,\" the state unit source said. The board members were also apprised about the new budget and the profit that BCCI made in the last financial year. Former India left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha will no longer be Indian Cricketers' Association's representative in the Apex Council. \"The ICA will have its election and then choose their new representative.\" There were talks about removal of Salil Ankola from the national selection panel as chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, who is also from Mumbai, is already a part of the panel.
