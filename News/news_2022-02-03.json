The Hoops might have been three goals to the good at the interval – the magisterial Reo Hatate marking his derby debut with a brace before Liel Abada snaffled a third. But if it wasn’t for Rangers’ evergreen shot-stopper, it could have been a cricket score by half-time.  “It’s gonna be a special night at Paradise” | Big Celtic vs Rangers Preview with Ryan118BridTV8170“It’s gonna be a special night at Paradise” | Big Celtic vs Rangers Preview with Ryan118949349949349centerUCqUPn73T2WxGyzCdtLe8m7g67 Hail Hail (Youtube)https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng3RIc-bAXurA5yt1Vj63uuVOBD1RQ9n6j_XKhD=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj13872 McGregor, who turned 40 on Monday, brilliantly denied a Filipe Jota snapshot. And, on another day, the unfortunate Giorgios Giakoumakis could have had a hat-trick if it wasn’t for the Scot’s typically feline reflexes.  Will Celtic now take back Rangers’ crown? “I’m very proud of the lads, I thought our first half was outstanding,” beams Postecoglou.  “We scored our three goals but the football we played was just brilliant and we could have had a few more.  GLASGOW, SCOTLAND – FEBRUARY 02: Reo Hatate of Celtic celebrates with his team-mates after scoring his team’s second goal during the Cinch Scottish Premiership match between Celtic FC and Rangers FC at on February 02, 2022 in Glasgow, Scotland. “Allan McGregor was outstanding in their goa. In the second half we had to defend a bit more but even then I think we showed that side of, that we can defend if we need to.  “Full credit to the players, it’s a big game and we knew the consequences. There was pressure on us, there’s been pressure on us all along, but I just thought they handled it superbly.”  Delivering Rangers just their second league defeat since pre-COVID times, Postecoglou’s scintillating Celtic have now leapfrogged their city rivals in the Scottish Premiership table. What’s more, they now have a goal difference advantage of 10 as January signing Hatate followed up his long-range thunderbolt against Hearts with two more outside-of-the-box efforts in front of a raucous Parkhead crowd.  GLASGOW, SCOTLAND – FEBRUARY 02: Reo Hatate of Celtic celebrates with team-mate Callum McGregor after scoring his team’s second goal during the Cinch Scottish Premiership match between Celtic FC and Rangers FC at on February 02, 2022 in Glasgow, Scotland.

Having won the toss and batting first, India amassed 5-290 with a 204-run third-wicket partnership between captain Yash Dhull and vice-captain Shaik Rasheed turning the match on its head. Australia's run chase never materialised as wickets fell at regular intervals before they were dismissed for 194 in the 42nd over at Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua. Australia will round out their tournament against Afghanistan for third place on Saturday (AEDT). India, who have accounted for Australia in the past three editions of the your tournament, will play England in the final. The match started brightly for Australia as they dismissed both openers within the first 13 overs and restricted the run rate. Dhull and Rasheed then set about taking the game away from the Australians as they dominated the bowlers and piled on the runs. Their onslaught only came to end when Dull was run out in unusual circumstances for run-a-ball 110 -- at the non-striker's end as Jack Nisbet got a fingertip to a Rasheed straight drive. Rasheed followed his captain back to the sheds on the next delivery for 94, as Jack Sinfield grasped a sharp chance at backward point. India went from 2-37 when Dhull and Rasheed joined forces to 2-241. Dinesh Bana put the finishing touches to India's innings by bludgeoning 20 runs off four deliveries, with two sixes and two fours, with the 50th over bowled by Tom Whitney going for 27. Nisbet was the pick of the Australian attack with 2-41 while William Salzmann (2-57) was the other wicket taker. Australia's innings started disastrously with run machine Teague Wyllie out lbw for one in the second over. A partnership of 68 between Campbell Kellaway (30) and Corey Miller (38) proved to be the best the Aussies could muster as their wickets within two runs led to a collapse from 1-71 in the 17th over to 4-83. With the required run-rate beyond seven an over the task became insurmountable with India's spinners Vicky Ostwal (3-42) and Nishant Sindhu (2-25) ripping through the batting order. A half-century from Lachlan Shaw maintained some respectability on the scoreboard but his 51 from 66 balls and the efforts of No.9 Sinfield (20) and No.10 Whitney (19) simply delayed the inevitable.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5545854/32565e29cabafce7775afbde1fd9ae6ad16eade6-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashley Giles sacked as England team director after dismal Ashes campaign - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL2ZlYi8wMi9jcmlja2V0LWVuZ2xhbmQtZWNiLWFzaGVzLWFzaGxleS1naWxlcy1hbmRyZXctc3RyYXVzc9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashley Giles sacked as England team director after dismal Ashes campaign  The GuardianAshley Giles sacked as England managing director after Ashes series defeat  Sky SportsAshley Giles SACKED as managing director of England's men's cricket after disastrous Ashes campaign  Daily MailNasser Hussain sympathises with Ashley Giles but says departure to be expected  Evesham JournalAshley Giles set for ECB exit as part of Ashes fallout  The CricketerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-02 21:18:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussies crushed in World Cup semi-final as India ‘future looks secured’ after EPIC ‘comeback’ - Fox Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__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?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Aussies crushed in World Cup semi-final as India ‘future looks secured’ after EPIC ‘comeback’  Fox SportsAussie U19s fall short against powerhouse India side  cricket.com.auRecent Match Report - India U19 vs Aust U19 2nd Semi-Final 2021/22  ESPNcricinfoTARGETING 5TH TITLE: India face Australian challenge  NEWS9 liveConnolly leaning on Scorchers teammate ahead of U19 semi  cricket.com.auView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-02 20:48:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England boss sacked after Ashes humiliation","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/england-cricket-boss-sacked-after-ashes-humiliation/news-story/d828f66b645ddd827dc9b21e2c651d2d","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In the great tradition of England’s Ashes tours of Australia, a woeful summer abroad is ending the careers of senior cricket figures back in the mother country.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-02 20:42:00","full_description":"In the great tradition of England’s Ashes tours of Australia, a woeful summer abroad is ending the careers of senior cricket figures back in the mother country. News emerged Thursday morning (AEDT) managing director of England men’s cricket Ashley Giles “stepped down” from his position as he paid the price for the team’s woeful 4-0 Ashes series loss in Australia. The humiliating reverse against their oldest rivals followed a poor 2021 where England lost nine of their 15 Tests and were beaten in the semi-finals of the World Twenty20. Widespread reports, including from Sky Sports, claimed Giles was sacked before given the opportunity to step down of his own volition. Attention is now turning towards head coach Chris Silverwood and batting coach Graeme Thorpe — who are also under pressure to retain their positions. Decisions on their futures are expected to be announced in coming days. Giles’ departure was handled as delicately as possible. “Ashley Giles is standing down as managing director, England men’s cricket,” said an England and Wales Cricket Board statement. The 48-year-old was appointed at the end of 2018, replacing former England captain Andrew Strauss, who will now take over on an interim basis ahead of next month’s three-Test series in the West Indies. “Off the back of a disappointing men’s Ashes this winter we must ensure we put in place the conditions across our game to enable our Test team to succeed,” said ECB chief executive Tom Harrison in a statement. Former England left-arm spinner Giles’ position was widely regarded as untenable following the Ashes defeat, where for all the problems of touring Australia amid the Covid-19 pandemic, he was criticised for giving under-pressure head coach Chris Silverwood sole authority for picking the side after being behind the sacking of national selector Ed Smith. Wednesday’s statement saw both Giles and the ECB acknowledge the highlights of his reign, which included a maiden 50-over world title in 2019, rising to the top of the top of the Twenty20 rankings and a current position of fourth in the Test standings. It added Strauss will “put in place arrangements for the forthcoming West Indies tour, while the search begins for a full-time replacement.” Giles and Silverwood submitted their report on the Ashes campaign to Strauss, the chairman of the ECB cricket committee, last week. Strauss made his recommendations to a full ECB board meeting on Thursday (AEDT). Several pundits, including former England captain Mike Atherton, have questioned whether Silverwood can stay on as coach after a series of questionable selection decisions during the Ashes. “I’d like to thank everyone for the support they’ve given me, particularly all the staff and the players, as well as the board for giving me this opportunity,” said Giles in his statement. “The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging and I’m proud of what we’ve been able to deliver in the toughest of circumstances. This has undoubtedly protected the future of the game in England and Wales.” He went on to add: “I wish all our players and staff great success for the future. “I’m now looking forward to spending some time with my family before looking at the next challenge.” Harrison, meanwhile, thanked Giles by saying: “He’s highly respected throughout the game and has made a huge contribution to the ECB and England men’s cricket.” It is becoming a predictable end to England’s tours of Australia, following a general theme most recently exhibited by Mitchell Johnson ending the careers of senior English players in his iconic 2013-14 Ashes series — and Nathan Lyon famously declaring in 2017 he wanted to “end the careers” of some English players. — with AFP Australia and England played out an intense Test match in the nation’s capital, but the home side is set for a big boost in the ODIs. There are 47 Australians in the final pool for the Indian Premier League auction and a trio are set for a huge payday. AFL icon turned pundit and broadcaster Kane Cornes sparked a passionate debate after making some critical claims on live radio.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England boss sacked after Ashes humiliation","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/england-cricket-boss-sacked-after-ashes-humiliation/news-story/d828f66b645ddd827dc9b21e2c651d2d","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In the great tradition of England’s Ashes tours of Australia, a woeful summer abroad is ending the careers of senior cricket figures back in the mother country.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-02 20:42:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Covid hits India team ahead of Windies series; Dhawan, others test positive","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/covid-hits-india-team-ahead-of-windies-series-dhawan-others-test-positive-122020300003_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A COVID-19 outbreak hit the Indian cricket team on Wednesday as three main players tested positive for the virus during their mandatory isolation period before the start of West Indies series.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-02 20:31:00","full_description":"A COVID-19 outbreak hit the Indian cricket team on Wednesday as three main players -- senior opener Shikhar Dhawan, reserve opener Ruturaj Gaikwad and middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer -- tested positive for the virus during their mandatory isolation period before the start of West Indies series. Four other persons, including net bowler Navdeep Saini, have also tested positive for COVID-19. Saini is also on standby list. The remaining three who tested positive for the virus are non-playing members -- fielding coach T Dilip, security liaison officer B Lokesh and masseur Rajeev Kumar. \"The All-India Senior Selection Committee has added Mayank Agarwal to India's ODI squad after seven members, including three players of Team India (Senior Men) tested positive for COVID-19 following three rounds of RT-PCR testing,\" BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement. The Indian team assembled in Ahmedabad on January 31 for the upcoming white-ball series against the West Indies and were going through a three-day isolation period post their break from the South Africa series. The series starts in Ahmedabad on February 6 with India's 1000th ODI match but it is now a foregone conclusion that the trio will be missing the series as they will have to undergo a week-long isolation and then return with two negative RT-PCR tests. Shah gave a lowdown of the sequence of positive cases in the India camp. \"Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan and fast bowler Navdeep Saini's (standby player) RT-PCR tests conducted on Monday (January 31st) have returned positive results,' Shah stated in the release. \"Fielding Coach T. Dilip and Security Liaison Officer B. Lokesh's RT-PCR tests conducted on Monday (January 31st) have returned positive results. Batsman Ruturaj Gaikwad's RT-PCR test conducted on Tuesday (February 1st) has returned a positive result. He had tested negative during the first round of testing on Monday,\" the release further stated. \"Batsman Shreyas Iyer and Sports Massage Therapist Rajeev Kumar's RT-PCR tests conducted on Wednesday (February 2nd) have returned positive results. Both had tested negative in the first two rounds of testing.\" The BCCI medical team is handling the positive cases and the infected persons will remain in isolation till complete recovery is attained. \"The players are largely asymptomatic and hopefully will be fine by the end of the isolation period. You feel bad for Shikhar as he might have to miss the series and he is not a part of T20 squad,\" an official said. Even more disappointing is young Ruturaj Gaikwad's case as this is the second time in one and a half years that he has tested positive for COVID-19. \"If you remember, Ruturaj had tested positive in UAE during the 2020 IPL and went through hell. He had a 14-day quarantine back then and missed first part of the season in the Emirates. This is the second time he has tested positive,\" the official added. It is confirmed that captain Rohit Sharma, senior players like Virat Kohli and coach Rahul Dravid have all tested negative as of Wednesday. \"They have returned negative as of today.\" All those who tested negative will complete their mandatory isolation on Thursday. They will enter the bubble, if they test negative again on Thursday. \"The testing protocol set by BCCI medical team is for every day RT-PCR as RAT (Rapid Antigen Test) is often not conclusive. Although teams are supplied with RAT kits in case any player shows symptoms and wants to do a self test,\" the official said. It is expected that M Shahrukh Khan, R Sai Kishore, Rishi Dhawan, who are stand byes for the series, will now get a look-in to be in the squad. As far as Rohit Sharma's opening partner is concerned, Mayank's inclusion makes it clear that team management is not looking at Ishan Kishan or Venkatesh Iyer for the slot. It must be noted that all the players had tested negative in RT-PCR when they embarked on their journey to Ahmedabad from their respective cities. \"The members were asked to report in Ahmedabad on 31st January 2022 for the upcoming three-match ODI and T20I series against West Indies. Every member was also asked to undergo an RT-PCR test at home before embarking on their journey to Ahmedabad and the travel was undertaken only after testing negative,\" the BCCI said.

The former Test spinner has paid the price for a disastrous Ashes series, which ended in a 4-0 defeat, and followed a poor 2021 where England lost nine of their 15 Tests and suffered a semi-final defeat in the T20 World Cup in November. Giles was appointed at the end of 2018, replacing Sir Andrew Strauss, who has agreed to step in on an interim basis and put arrangements in place for next month's three-Test series in the West Indies, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Wednesday. An ECB statement read: \"Ashley Giles is standing down as Managing Director, England Men's Cricket. \"Ashley is leaving after three years in the role during which England Men became 50-over World Champions and are currently ranked the world's best T20I side, 2nd in ODIs and 4th for Tests. \"Sir Andrew Strauss has agreed to step into the role on an interim basis and will put in place arrangements for the forthcoming West Indies Tour, while the search begins for a full-time replacement.\" Giles and head coach Chris Silverwood submitted their report on England's Ashes failures to chair of the ECB cricket committee and former captain Strauss last week. Strauss has made his recommendations to the board at a meeting on Wednesday and Silverwood's future, as well as batting coach Graham Thorpe, has yet to be decided. Giles said: \"The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging and I'm proud of what we've been able to deliver in the toughest of circumstances.

Giles was appointed at the end of 2018, replacing Sir Andrew Strauss, who has agreed to step in on an interim basis and put arrangements in place for next month's three-Test series in the West Indies, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Wednesday. An ECB statement read: \"Ashley Giles is standing down as Managing Director, England Men's Cricket. \"Ashley is leaving after three years in the role during which England Men became 50-over World Champions and are currently ranked the world's best T20I side, 2nd in ODIs and 4th for Tests. \"Sir Andrew Strauss has agreed to step into the role on an interim basis and will put in place arrangements for the forthcoming West Indies Tour, while the search begins for a full-time replacement.\" Giles and head coach Chris Silverwood submitted their report on England's Ashes failures to chair of the ECB cricket committee and former captain Strauss last week. Strauss has made his recommendations to the board at a meeting on Wednesday and Silverwood's future, as well as batting coach Graham Thorpe, has yet to be decided. Giles said: \"The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging and I'm proud of what we've been able to deliver in the toughest of circumstances. This has undoubtedly protected the future of the game in England and Wales. \"Despite these challenges, over the past three years, we have become 50-over world champions, the top ranked T20I side in the world, we remain (the) fourth ranked Test team and our under-19s have just reached the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years.\" ECB chief executive officer Tom Harrison added: \"I'm extremely grateful to Ashley for his commitment and contribution to England men's cricket over the last three years. \"He's highly respected throughout the game and has made a huge contribution to the ECB and England men's cricket.\"","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5545242/58d954edbbc9e89650df37d3affe1991d4279052-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI warm up match: Will India vs West Indies ODI series be postponed?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ind-vs-wi-warm-up-match-will-india-vs-west-indies-odi-series-be-postponed/","keywords":["Cricket","India Cricket Team","India","West Indies","West Indies tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies ODI series: India and West Indies are scheduled to play a three-match ODI series from February 6.

India’s first international fixture in 2022 at home is only three days away from now as West Indies’ tour of India will commence with a three-match ODI series in Ahmedabad. While the Narendra Modi Stadium was slated to host the first ODI, Jaipur and Kolkata were in line to host the second and third ODI respectively as per the original plan. However, a third wave of COVID-19 forced the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) to move the whole ODI and T20I series in Ahmedabad and Kolkata respectively. Irrespective of the format of the first match, visiting teams playing a warm-up match against a state or an A side before the first international fixture is becoming a thing of the past especially in the COVID era. Arrived in Ahmedabad India safe and sound! Let’s get this series going. pic.twitter.com/DPhBr6oK6f — NickyP (@nicholas_47) February 2, 2022 In times when teams have to undergo a mandatory quarantine period, multi-format professionals expected to play as per tightly-knit schedules don’t really have the time to play warm-up matches. Hence, there won’t be one before India vs West Indies ODIs either. Will India vs West Indies ODI series postponed? In addition to being a historic occasion where the hosts will become the first-ever team to play their 1,000th ODI, it will also be the first match when Rohit Sharma will lead India as a regular captain and not a stand-in captain. Sharma, who has led India in 10 ODIs and 22 T20Is till date, is quite likely to begin this journey without dependable opening partner Shikhar Dhawan. With batting trio of Dhawan, Shreyas Iyer and Ruturaj Gaikwad among seven members of the Indian contingent who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Ahmedabad, they are unlikely to take part in the first match on Sunday. Instead, there are high chances of Sharma opening the batting with Mayank Agarwal for the first time in an ODI. While a COVID outburst such as this had it in it for the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) to postpone the start of the series by 3-4 days, no mention of the same has been made in their official statement for now. With Agarwal included as a replacement, the series could be conducted as per the original schedule with players joining the squad before the second ODI depending on individual recovery.

Several networks, such as Sony Sports Network, global giants Disney Star Network, Reliance-Viacom 18 and Amazon among others, are in the fray to grab the IPL Media Rights.The Indian cricket board will sell the television and digital telecast rights of the IPL for four years -- between 2023 and 2027 -- through an e-auction likely in the last week of March. The Invitation to Tender (ITT) could be floated before February 10. The e-auction will then be conducted within 45 days of floating the ITT. Reports suggest the BCCI could earn almost three times the sum it grossed for the 2018-2022 cycle when Star India bought the rights for more than INR 16,347 crore. Before Star India, Sony Pictures Network had held media rights for a decade for a sum of INR 8,200 crore. While it nearly doubled when Star India took over the media rights in 2018, the BCCI now expects the sum to triple in the 2023-27 cycle. Reports say it could be in the range of INR 40,000 to 45,000 crores. It is estimated that the windfall from the sale of IPL media rights could be much more than BCCI president Sourav Ganguly's prediction of Rs 35,000 crore. A top BCCI official was quoted as saying by Inside Sport on Wednesday, \"Indian cricket is up for a bumper harvest from the sale of new cycle of IPL Rights. Don't be surprised if it touches (Rs) 40,000 to 45,000 crore. Let's wait for the magic to unfold.\" The BCCI could release the IPL media rights tender to coincide with the IPL 2022 mega auction scheduled in Bengaluru on February 12 to 13. Disney Star Network has stated that they are more than keen to bid for the rights for the next cycle. \"Sports business for us is in an investment mode and we won't shy away from investing heavily. We are going to be bullish on all rights renewals including IPL,\" K Madhavan, president of The Walt Disney Co India and Star India told the website. With several names in the fray, grabbing the media rights could lead to a bidding war. Two more entities, Reliance-Viacom 18 and Amazon, are likely to apply along with Sony Sports Network. Sony too has expanded after its merger with Zee and clinching the IPL property could give a huge boost to the network. Reliance-Viacom 18 could signal their entry into the big Indian cricket market with an ambitious bid for the IPL media rights, while Amazon Prime have already declared their intention to wholeheartedly go for the IPL rights, having started streaming cricket events. Other big names doing the rounds for digital streaming include Facebook and Google. The offshoot of the potential windfall is that IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings (CSK) has become the country's first sports Unicorn with its market cap touching a high of Rs 7,600 crores and its share in the grey market trading in the Rs 210-225 price band.","pubDate":"2022-02-02 19:27:33","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/02/02/500x300_1198850-ipl.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashley Giles steps down from England role after Ashes disaster with Andrew Strauss in on interim basis","link":"https://metro.co.uk/2022/02/02/ashley-giles-steps-down-from-england-role-with-andrew-strauss-stepping-on-interim-basis-16038372/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashley Giles","England cricket","The Ashes"],"creator":["Tony Mogan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Giles pays the price after woeful campaign Down Under.","content":"Giles pays the price for woeful England campaign (Picture: Getty) Ashley Giles has left his role as the England cricket team director following the humiliating Ashes campaign in Australia.

Seven members of the Indian cricket team and team management have tested positive for COVID-19 four days before the first ODI against West Indies in Ahmedabad. As reported just over an hour ago, batters Shikhar Dhawan, Shreyas Iyer and Ruturaj Gaikwad and standby fast bowler Navdeep Saini have returned positive COVID-19 tests. According to an official release by the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India), Dhawan and Saini’s tests were conducted on January 31, the day when the Indian contingent arrived in Ahmedabad. While Gaikwad’s test was conducted on February 1, Iyer’s test was conducted on February 2. In addition to these four players, fielding coach T. Dilip, security liaison officer B. Lokesh and sports massage therapist Rajeev Kumar have also contacted the virus. All the seven positive patients will have to self-isolate in their hotel rooms for seven days before rejoining the squad. The development has all but ruled them out of the first ODI scheduled to be played on February 6 at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Mayank Agarwal ODI stats With vice-captain Lokesh Rahul also resting for the first ODI, India were only left with five batting specialists including wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant. In such a situation, the team management was bound to call for replacements. While all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer and wicket-keeper batter Ishan Kishan, both of whom were part of the ODI squad during the recently concluded South Africa tour, were expected to be included, the selectors have handed a comeback to batter Mayank Agarwal. “The All-India Senior Selection Committee has added Mayank Agarwal to India’s ODI squad after seven members, including three players of Team India (Senior Men) tested positive for COVID-19 following three rounds of RT-PCR testing,” BCCI said in a statement. Agarwal, 30, had last played an ODI during the tour of Australia more than 14 months ago. Despite not playing a List A match since then, Agarwal earning a comeback is outright perplexing. The decision is quite similar to the selectors including spinner Kuldeep Yadav for this series in spite of him not playing any competitive match since getting dropped from the national team last year. In his five-match ODI career, Agarwal has scored 86 runs at an average and strike rate of 17.20 and 103.61 respectively. If the aforementioned triad misses the Ahmedabad ODI, expect Agarwal to open the batting with captain Rohit Sharma for the first time in an ODI. It is noteworthy that it will be Agarwal’s first ODI at home.

The Indian cricket team has coped a massive blow in the form of a COVID-19 outspread in their team hotel in Ahmedabad. An 18-member squad had reached Ahmedabad on January 31 to quarantine for three days before training for a three-match ODI series against West Indies. Having said that, there have been reports of multiple players and members of the support staff returning positive COVID-19 tests on Wednesday. Yet to make an official announcement regarding the same, BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) will conduct another round of tests on Thursday morning before taking a final call on the matter. It is not for the first time that Indian cricketers have contacted the virus. From Indian Premier League 2021 Phase 1 to India’s tour of Sri Lanka last year, the virus has played spoilsport for Indian players in the past well. International cricket aside, the recently concluded 11th season of the Big Bash League had suffered drastically due to dozens of positive COVID-19 cases across teams throughout its runtime. Covid in Indian cricket team If reports doing the rounds are to be believed, batters Shikhar Dhawan, Shreyas Iyer and Ruturaj Gaikwad and fast bowler Navdeep Saini (reserve player) have contacted the virus among players in Ahmedabad. Additionally, a few members of the support staff have also tested positive. Having said that, an official confirmation from the BCCI with respect to the positive members is awaited. With the first ODI scheduled to be played from February 6, the aforementioned players are unlikely to take part as all positive patients are required to complete a seven-day isolation period. Another option with the BCCI is to postpone the series by 3-4 days to ensure these players’ participation after recovery. The same would require some brainstorming as there’s already a lot of uncertainty around the fixtures of the succeeding Sri Lanka’s tour of India 2022. It is worth mentioning that white-ball vice-captain Lokesh Rahul has already been rested for the first ODI. Assuming that the trio of Dhawan, Iyer and Gaikwad miss the first ODI, the team management would be highly likely to seeking batting replacements. All-rounder Venkatesh Iyer and wicket-keeper batter Ishan Kishan, both of whom were part of the ODI squad on South Africa tour last month, should be front-runners to be called in for the first ODI.
