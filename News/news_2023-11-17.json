The Wesley College Old Boys Union (OBU), led by its effervescent President Captain Navin De Silva, along with Methodist Church President Reverend Ebenezer Joseph, its officials and Wesley College Principal Avanka Fernando officially commenced the Wesley College Restoration Project, at Campbell Park. This ambitious initiative is part of the school's Sesquicentennial celebration which falls on 2 March 2024. This is another milestone in the progressive journey of the Old Boys Union who has undertaken this project of restoring its 120 year old Pavilion, probably one of the Oldest Pavilions amongst Schools in Sri Lanka. Heading this Project as Project Chairman Ivor Maharoof along with able team comprising Treasurer S.Renganathan, Project Secretary Shehan Sheriff and Restoration Building Team lead by K.Dayaparan, Senior Old Boys Lucky Goonathilake, Lalith Wijesinghe, Gerard fernando, Air Vice Marshal Sampath Wickermeratne, Maj Gen Indu Samarakoon, Maithri Vithanage, Shiraz Jaldin- Wesley Sports Administrator, Architect Murad Ismail, Structural Engineer Ajith Vandebona and Quantity Surveyor Ravi Wijesekera they will coordinate closely with the Methodist Church Architect and Structural Engineers during the restoration. Since its inception in 1900, the Pavilion has cradled the cherished memories of countless Wesley College scholars. Now, it stands on the precipice of decay, a dire situation necessitating immediate intervention. The Pavilion's significance as an heritage building , beloved by every Wesleyite to have passed through the school's gates, underscores the urgency to preserve it. In the spirit of Wesley College's rich architectural heritage, the committee has enlisted the talents of the renowned architect, Murad Ismail. With his unparalleled skills, he has willingly accepted the arduous task of designing the restoration. The Pavilion's history dates back to its acquisition by Wesley College from the Tamil Union Cricket & Athletic Club at Campbell Park in 1940. Believed to have been constructed in 1900, the Pavilion is poised to celebrate its 124th anniversary in 2024. The Pavilion was inaugurated on 19 January 1940 by the esteemed old boy, Minister of Labour, Industries and Commerce G.C.S. Corea at the time. Throughout the years, Wesley's Pavilion has been graced by some of Sri Lanka's cricketing legends, including the iconic Mahadevan Sathasivam and a plethora of Wesley College's own cricketing greats. Furthermore, legendary cricketers from rival schools, such as the Gunasekera brothers, Clive Inman, and Michael Tissera, have left their mark on this historic Pavilion. Beyond cricket, generations of Wesley sportsmen in rugby, athletics, soccer, and hockey have found solace and inspiration within these hallowed walls. As a testament to their shared history, every Wesleyite has, at some point, walked through the sacred Pavilion, which stands as a timeless symbol of Wesley's distinguished heritage. The Wesley College Pavilion Restoration Project is not merely a venture; it's a significant and heart-warming endeavour that represents a collective call to all the Wesleyite in every corner of the Globe, to join and together, rekindle 124 years of sporting legacy, ensuring that Wesley College continues to inspire future generations of Wesleyites.","pubDate":"2023-11-16 21:30:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"50f7a1991e854460adb2c950843989cd","title":"Babar Azam resigns as Pakistan captain in all formats","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Babar-Azam-resigns-as-Pakistan-captain-in-all-formats/23-755281","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Pakistan’s Babar Azam has stepped down as captain across all formats of the game following the team’s league-stage exit at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The Pakistan Cricket Board have subsequently announced that Shaheen Shah Afridi will take over as T20I captain and Shan Masood will be the Pakistan Test captain. A decision on the ODI captaincy will be made in due course. The PCB also confirmed that there will be a sizeable change to the coaching staff heading into the tours of Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. “The PCB has changed the portfolio of the entire coaching staff including Director Cricket Mickey Arthur,” a statement read. “All coaches will continue to work in National Cricket Academy while PCB will announce the new coaching staff in due course for the upcoming series in Australia and New Zealand.” Babar has been the multi-format Pakistan captain since 2020, taking on the ODI and Test roles a year after he took charge of the T20 side. But Pakistan’s disappointing campaign at the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India has led to the 29-year-old stepping down with immediate effect. “I vividly remember the moment when I received the call from PCB to lead Pakistan in 2019,” Babar said in a statement released on his social media channels. “Over the past four years, I’ve experienced many highs and lows on and off the field, but I wholeheartedly and passionately aimed to maintain Pakistan’s pride and respect in the cricket world. Reaching the number 1 spot in the white-ball format was a result of the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management, but I’d like to express my gratitude to passionate Pakistan cricket fans for their unwavering support during this journey. Today, I am stepping down as the captain of Pakistan in all formats. It’s a difficult decision but I feel it is a right time for this call.” Pakistan lost five matches during the 2023 tournament, finishing outside of the semi-final qualification places. And Babar was largely off form with the bat, scoring 320 runs in his nine innings and having a top score of just 74. The former top-ranked ODI batter in the world, who averages 56.72 in the format with 19 centuries to his name, says he will continue to be available to play for Pakistan in all formats going forward and will offer his support to whoever takes over as skipper. “I will continue to represent Pakistan as a player in all three formats. I am here to support the new captain and the team with my experience and dedication. I want to express my sincere thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board for entrusting me with this significant responsibility.” The PCB say that Babar “was asked to continue as Test captain” after being relieved of his duties in the white-ball formats, but opted to step down across all formats. “Babar Azam is truly a world-class player and we want him to continue to thrive as a player,” Zaka Ashraf, Chairman of the PCB Management Committee, said. “He is one of the best batters Pakistan has ever produced. He is our asset, and we will continue to support him. His batting prowess is a testament to his dedication and skill. He is a role model for the present generation. “We want to see him grow as a great batter and now without his additional burden of the captaincy, he can focus more on his performances to reach even greater heights. We respect his decision and will continue to back him.”","pubDate":"2023-11-16 21:30:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"80cb539cab83d074895d3ea800648b58","title":"‘Great spectacle of cricket’ – Australia relishing World Cup final against India","link":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/sport/national/23929610.great-spectacle-cricket---australia-relishing-world-cup-final-india/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia booked their place in Sunday’s showpiece against in-form hosts India with a three-wicket win over South Africa.","content":"Australia’s Mitchell Starc was looking forward to “a great spectacle of cricket” after his side book their spot in the World Cup final against hosts India.

The intensity is only going to be dialled up when they take on undefeated home favourites India in Ahmedabad on Sunday, with up to 100,000 locals ready to roar their nation on at the Narendra Modi Stadium. And it is a prospect Starc is ready to embrace. “It’s certainly going to be a big occasion, a World Cup Final in India. It’s going to be loud,” he said. “I think it’s just going to be a great spectacle of cricket, no doubt. There’s going to be a lot of passion there. Certainly, everyone in our changing room is looking forward to it. “I don’t think either changing room is new to big occasions. You want to take on the best and that’s why we play the game. They’ve been the best team in the tournament so far and we both find ourselves in the final.

While he and Hazlewood established a stranglehold over the batters, Travis Head and David Warner went on the attack as they raided 60 runs off the first six. On both occasions, damage was done that could not be clawed back by the Proteas. “We’ve seen throughout the tournament how tough the first 10 overs can be at certain times…when you’re willing to take the game on like that, sometimes you take a little bit of luck with you,” he said. “It certainly went to plan with the ball today and the way we set up with the bat is to really be aggressive, take the game on and the freedom to give those guys to go out and play the way they like to.” Losing coach Rob Walter gave South Africa credit for battling back into contention after their early collapse, making 212 on the back of David Miller’s 101, and insisted the age-old tag of ‘chokers’ was no longer fitting. “It’s obviously gutting to lose a semi-final but beyond that, I’m incredibly proud of the fight shown by the lads,” he said. “I guess you need to define what a ‘choke’ is. For me, a choke is losing a game that you’re in a position to win. In this instance, we were behind the eight ball right from the word go and we actually fought our way back into the competition and put up a score that gave us a chance. “For me there’s nothing even remotely close to a choke that happened out there today.

The victors meet unbeaten India in the final at Ahmedabad on Sunday after Australia scored 7/215 with 16 balls to spare in reply to South Africa’s 212 on a difficult, worn and weary pitch. Australia’s captain Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc celebrate their win in their semi-final match against South Africa. Credit: AP “I was pretty calm, I think Patty was pretty calm as well, and whilst it was pretty close we had plenty of time,” bowling and batting hero Mitchell Starc said after the match. “Nice to squeeze past and make it to a final.” Australia’s target was 213, just one short of what South Africa unsuccessfully chased during their most famous of semi-final chokes at Edgbaston during the 1999 World Cup. They are yet to qualify for a World Cup final. Cummins has shown a knack for finishing big matches, hitting the winning runs in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston earlier this year and during his first Test in South Africa 12 years ago. He also held up an end for Glenn Maxwell to score his brilliant 201 not out against Afghanistan last week in a victory that assured Australia’s semi-final place. Starc, unbeaten on 16 from 38 balls, was with Cummins at the end. He was 14 not out from 29 balls. “It’s why we play the game, to take on the best,” Starc said of Sunday’s final against unbeaten India. Starc is one of five players in the team who were part of the 2015 triumph over New Zealand at the MCG. Cummins and Mitchell Marsh were in the squad. South Africa’s struggles began despite winning the toss and batting first, when they have played their most explosive cricket in this tournament. Instead, they collapsed to 4/24 in 11.5 overs against the Test quality bowling of Starc (3/34) and Hazlewood (2/12) on a pitch which began with early moisture after being under covers. “I think our power play was probably what got us on our way. Other key moments throughout the day with bat and ball, but to start the game like that with Joshy and I, power play wickets have probably been not our strong suit throughout the tournament, so it was nice to have the power play 2-18 (after 10 overs).” Australia’s Glenn Maxwell reacts after being bowled out. Credit: AP By contrast Travis Head, who was at his most wild and damaging, hammering 62 in just 48 balls with nine fours and two sixes. He and David Warner (29 in 18 balls with four sixes) swished and swatted their way to 0/24 in just 3.3 overs on the way to an opening partnership of 60 in 6.1 overs. It was an attempt to nullify an increasingly uncertain pitch and ensure Australia were well ahead of the run rate should the cyclone forming in the Bay of Bengal arrive to spoil the party. A washout would have seen South Africa go through to the final after finishing second above Australia on run rate. Such were the pitch conditions, it was telling that South Africa bowled more overs of spin than pace. Warner was bowled by part-time off-spinner Aiden Markram’s first ball and Head later went bowled by Keshav Maharaj’s initial delivery. In between Mitch Marsh was brilliantly caught by a flying Rassie van der Dussen in the covers for a six-ball duck slashing at a short ball from Kagiso Rabada.

This time the umpire’s call went in South Africa’s favour. Maxwell went from hero to almost zero in little more than a week. Appearing in his first match since his heroic 201 not out against Afghanistan, Maxwell was beaten first ball by Shami, survived a review for caught behind off a reverse sweep, and perished to what may well have been the worst shot of his career. Loading He aimed a furious hack at a delivery from Shamsi which kept a little low and bowled him for one. Smith (30 in 62 balls) had an equally wild swing against a short of a length ball from Gerald Coetzee that went straight up in the air. It appeared that Inglis (28 in 49 balls) would usher Australia home with Starc’s help, but he was yorked by Coetzee and bowled. South Africa desperately needed a hero and David Miller proved the man. His 101 from 116 balls not only held South Africa’s innings together, he was able to put pressure back on Cummins and the Australians by strategically hitting Adam Zampa out of the attack and taking to Cummins at times. Zampa – the leading bowler in the World Cup with 22 wickets before Mohammed Shami claimed seven in Wednesday’s semi-final against New Zealand to go to 23 – conceded 55 from his seven overs including six sixes.

Despite missing the first half of the league stage matches, Shami has played a vital role in his team's journey towards the final. In the semifinal against New Zealand, Shami took 7/57 in 9.5 overs at an economy rate of 5.79. This is India's best bowling spell in ICC Cricket World Cup history, overtaking Ashish Nehra's 6/23 against England in 2003. Shami's figures are also the fifth-best in World Cup history, with Australia's Glenn McGrath's 7/15 against Namibia in 2003 being the best. A key aspect of Shami's domination is how brilliant he has been against left-arm batters. Though Shami has been a batter's nightmare, it is the left-arm batters he has thrived against. In his WC run this year, Shami has bowled 52 deliveries to left-arm batters. He has conceded just 32 runs against them. Shami's eight out of his 23 wickets in the tournament have been left-handers. The bowler has claimed wickets of Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner and Devon Conway of New Zealand, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali of England, Charith Asalanka of Sri Lanka among the left-handed batters. In six WC 2023 games, Shami has taken 23 wickets at an average of 9.13 and a strike rate of 10.91. His best figures are 7/57. He is the highest wicket-taker in the tournament so far. The pace veteran also completed 50 World Cup wickets, becoming only the seventh bowler to do so. Shami is also the fastest to get there, reaching the milestone in just 17 innings, surpassing Mitchell Starc's (Australia) record of 19 innings. The highest wicket-taker in WC history is Australia's Glenn McGrath with 71 wickets in 39 matches in his World Cup career. Shami now has four five-wicket hauls in Cricket World Cup history, the highest by any bowler. Australian left-arm quick Starc has dropped to second spot with three five-wicket hauls. Advertisement Earlier, on Wednesday, India opted to bat first and scored 397/4 in their 50 overs. Skipper Rohit Sharma (47 in 29 balls, with four boundaries and four sixes) and Shubman Gill (80 in 66 balls, with eight fours and three sixes) delivered a fine start with a 71-run opening stand. Virat Kohli (117 in 113 balls, nine fours and two sixes) posted his 50th ODI ton, while Shreyas Iyer (105 in 70 balls, with four boundaries and eight sixes) scored his second-successive WC century, helping India post a massive score. KL Rahul also delivered a 20-ball cameo of 39 runs, with five fours and two sixes. Tim Southee (3/100) was the pick of the bowlers for the Kiwis. Trent Boult (1/86) also got a wicket. In the chase of 398, Kiwis lost two early wickets. But an 181-run partnership between Daryl Mitchell (134 in 119 balls, with nine fours and six sixes) and skipper Kane Williamson (69 in 73 balls, with eight centuries and a six) kept Kiwis alive and Indian bowlers sweating for answers. Glenn Phillips also played a valuable knock of 41. However, a two-wicket over by Shami changed the game and Men in Blue bowled exceptionally in the death overs to restrict NZ to 327 in 48.5 overs. Besides Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj got a wicket apiece. Shami was adjudged as the 'Player of the Match' for his dream spell.","pubDate":"2023-11-16 18:22:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"73e932add0ec8d28ccf7cd84012b63b5","title":"Sports Minister orders inquiry into allegations made by chief cricket selector","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Sports-Minister-orders-inquiry-into-allegations-made-by-chief-cricket-selector/23-755283","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has requested the Sports Ministry’s Special Investigation Unit for the Prevention of Sports Offences to investigate the recent allegations of corruption made by Sri Lanka’s Cricket Selection Committee Chief Pramodya Wickramasinghe.

The Wesley College Old Boys Union (OBU), led by its effervescent President Captain Navin De Silva, along with Methodist Church President Reverend Ebenezer Joseph, its officials and Wesley College Principal Avanka Fernando officially commenced the Wesley College Restoration Project, at Campbell Park. This ambitious initiative is part of the school's Sesquicentennial celebration which falls on 2 March 2024. This is another milestone in the progressive journey of the Old Boys Union who has undertaken this project of restoring its 120 year old Pavilion, probably one of the Oldest Pavilions amongst Schools in Sri Lanka. Heading this Project as Project Chairman Ivor Maharoof along with able team comprising Treasurer S.Renganathan, Project Secretary Shehan Sheriff and Restoration Building Team lead by K.Dayaparan, Senior Old Boys Lucky Goonathilake, Lalith Wijesinghe, Gerard fernando, Air Vice Marshal Sampath Wickermeratne, Maj Gen Indu Samarakoon, Maithri Vithanage, Shiraz Jaldin- Wesley Sports Administrator, Architect Murad Ismail, Structural Engineer Ajith Vandebona and Quantity Surveyor Ravi Wijesekera they will coordinate closely with the Methodist Church Architect and Structural Engineers during the restoration. Since its inception in 1900, the Pavilion has cradled the cherished memories of countless Wesley College scholars. Now, it stands on the precipice of decay, a dire situation necessitating immediate intervention. The Pavilion's significance as an heritage building , beloved by every Wesleyite to have passed through the school's gates, underscores the urgency to preserve it. In the spirit of Wesley College's rich architectural heritage, the committee has enlisted the talents of the renowned architect, Murad Ismail. With his unparalleled skills, he has willingly accepted the arduous task of designing the restoration. The Pavilion's history dates back to its acquisition by Wesley College from the Tamil Union Cricket & Athletic Club at Campbell Park in 1940. Believed to have been constructed in 1900, the Pavilion is poised to celebrate its 124th anniversary in 2024. The Pavilion was inaugurated on 19 January 1940 by the esteemed old boy, Minister of Labour, Industries and Commerce G.C.S. Corea at the time. Throughout the years, Wesley's Pavilion has been graced by some of Sri Lanka's cricketing legends, including the iconic Mahadevan Sathasivam and a plethora of Wesley College's own cricketing greats. Furthermore, legendary cricketers from rival schools, such as the Gunasekera brothers, Clive Inman, and Michael Tissera, have left their mark on this historic Pavilion. Beyond cricket, generations of Wesley sportsmen in rugby, athletics, soccer, and hockey have found solace and inspiration within these hallowed walls. As a testament to their shared history, every Wesleyite has, at some point, walked through the sacred Pavilion, which stands as a timeless symbol of Wesley's distinguished heritage. The Wesley College Pavilion Restoration Project is not merely a venture; it's a significant and heart-warming endeavour that represents a collective call to all the Wesleyite in every corner of the Globe, to join and together, rekindle 124 years of sporting legacy, ensuring that Wesley College continues to inspire future generations of Wesleyites.","pubDate":"2023-11-16 21:30:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"50f7a1991e854460adb2c950843989cd","title":"Babar Azam resigns as Pakistan captain in all formats","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Babar-Azam-resigns-as-Pakistan-captain-in-all-formats/23-755281","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Pakistan’s Babar Azam has stepped down as captain across all formats of the game following the team’s league-stage exit at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The Pakistan Cricket Board have subsequently announced that Shaheen Shah Afridi will take over as T20I captain and Shan Masood will be the Pakistan Test captain. A decision on the ODI captaincy will be made in due course. The PCB also confirmed that there will be a sizeable change to the coaching staff heading into the tours of Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. “The PCB has changed the portfolio of the entire coaching staff including Director Cricket Mickey Arthur,” a statement read. “All coaches will continue to work in National Cricket Academy while PCB will announce the new coaching staff in due course for the upcoming series in Australia and New Zealand.” Babar has been the multi-format Pakistan captain since 2020, taking on the ODI and Test roles a year after he took charge of the T20 side. But Pakistan’s disappointing campaign at the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India has led to the 29-year-old stepping down with immediate effect. “I vividly remember the moment when I received the call from PCB to lead Pakistan in 2019,” Babar said in a statement released on his social media channels. “Over the past four years, I’ve experienced many highs and lows on and off the field, but I wholeheartedly and passionately aimed to maintain Pakistan’s pride and respect in the cricket world. Reaching the number 1 spot in the white-ball format was a result of the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management, but I’d like to express my gratitude to passionate Pakistan cricket fans for their unwavering support during this journey. Today, I am stepping down as the captain of Pakistan in all formats. It’s a difficult decision but I feel it is a right time for this call.” Pakistan lost five matches during the 2023 tournament, finishing outside of the semi-final qualification places. And Babar was largely off form with the bat, scoring 320 runs in his nine innings and having a top score of just 74. The former top-ranked ODI batter in the world, who averages 56.72 in the format with 19 centuries to his name, says he will continue to be available to play for Pakistan in all formats going forward and will offer his support to whoever takes over as skipper. “I will continue to represent Pakistan as a player in all three formats. I am here to support the new captain and the team with my experience and dedication. I want to express my sincere thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board for entrusting me with this significant responsibility.” The PCB say that Babar “was asked to continue as Test captain” after being relieved of his duties in the white-ball formats, but opted to step down across all formats. “Babar Azam is truly a world-class player and we want him to continue to thrive as a player,” Zaka Ashraf, Chairman of the PCB Management Committee, said. “He is one of the best batters Pakistan has ever produced. He is our asset, and we will continue to support him. His batting prowess is a testament to his dedication and skill. He is a role model for the present generation. “We want to see him grow as a great batter and now without his additional burden of the captaincy, he can focus more on his performances to reach even greater heights. We respect his decision and will continue to back him.”","pubDate":"2023-11-16 21:30:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"80cb539cab83d074895d3ea800648b58","title":"‘Great spectacle of cricket’ – Australia relishing World Cup final against India","link":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/sport/national/23929610.great-spectacle-cricket---australia-relishing-world-cup-final-india/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia booked their place in Sunday’s showpiece against in-form hosts India with a three-wicket win over South Africa.","content":"Australia’s Mitchell Starc was looking forward to “a great spectacle of cricket” after his side book their spot in the World Cup final against hosts India.

The intensity is only going to be dialled up when they take on undefeated home favourites India in Ahmedabad on Sunday, with up to 100,000 locals ready to roar their nation on at the Narendra Modi Stadium. And it is a prospect Starc is ready to embrace. “It’s certainly going to be a big occasion, a World Cup Final in India. It’s going to be loud,” he said. “I think it’s just going to be a great spectacle of cricket, no doubt. There’s going to be a lot of passion there. Certainly, everyone in our changing room is looking forward to it. “I don’t think either changing room is new to big occasions. You want to take on the best and that’s why we play the game. They’ve been the best team in the tournament so far and we both find ourselves in the final. That’s what World Cups are about.” Starc’s skipper, Cummins, was equally enthused about the prospect having been part of Australia’s last ODI world champion squad on home soil eight years ago. “The stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided, but we’ve got to embrace it,” he said. “The 2015 World Cup was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, I can’t wait.” Starc agreed with the idea that over the course of a hard-fought contest against South Africa, Australia’s victory lay in their aggression during the powerplay overs. While he and Hazlewood established a stranglehold over the batters, Travis Head and David Warner went on the attack as they raided 60 runs off the first six. On both occasions, damage was done that could not be clawed back by the Proteas. “We’ve seen throughout the tournament how tough the first 10 overs can be at certain times…when you’re willing to take the game on like that, sometimes you take a little bit of luck with you,” he said. “It certainly went to plan with the ball today and the way we set up with the bat is to really be aggressive, take the game on and the freedom to give those guys to go out and play the way they like to.” Losing coach Rob Walter gave South Africa credit for battling back into contention after their early collapse, making 212 on the back of David Miller’s 101, and insisted the age-old tag of ‘chokers’ was no longer fitting. “It’s obviously gutting to lose a semi-final but beyond that, I’m incredibly proud of the fight shown by the lads,” he said. “I guess you need to define what a ‘choke’ is. For me, a choke is losing a game that you’re in a position to win. In this instance, we were behind the eight ball right from the word go and we actually fought our way back into the competition and put up a score that gave us a chance. “For me there’s nothing even remotely close to a choke that happened out there today.

That’s what World Cups are about.” Starc’s skipper, Cummins, was equally enthused about the prospect having been part of Australia’s last ODI world champion squad on home soil eight years ago. “The stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided, but we’ve got to embrace it,” he said. “The 2015 World Cup was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, I can’t wait.” Starc agreed with the idea that over the course of a hard-fought contest against South Africa, Australia’s victory lay in their aggression during the powerplay overs. While he and Hazlewood established a stranglehold over the batters, Travis Head and David Warner went on the attack as they raided 60 runs off the first six. On both occasions, damage was done that could not be clawed back by the Proteas. “We’ve seen throughout the tournament how tough the first 10 overs can be at certain times…when you’re willing to take the game on like that, sometimes you take a little bit of luck with you,” he said. “It certainly went to plan with the ball today and the way we set up with the bat is to really be aggressive, take the game on and the freedom to give those guys to go out and play the way they like to.” Losing coach Rob Walter gave South Africa credit for battling back into contention after their early collapse, making 212 on the back of David Miller’s 101, and insisted the age-old tag of ‘chokers’ was no longer fitting. “It’s obviously gutting to lose a semi-final but beyond that, I’m incredibly proud of the fight shown by the lads,” he said. “I guess you need to define what a ‘choke’ is. For me, a choke is losing a game that you’re in a position to win. In this instance, we were behind the eight ball right from the word go and we actually fought our way back into the competition and put up a score that gave us a chance. “For me there’s nothing even remotely close to a choke that happened out there today. It’s a serious contest between two good teams, number two and three in the tournament.”","pubDate":"2023-11-16 19:41:48","image_url":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/resources/images/17454781/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"northwaleschronicle","source_priority":2822327,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4bb4adddc632f5a27b5926a99b97650d","title":"Australia to meet India in final after tense victory over South Africa","link":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-to-meet-india-in-final-after-tense-victory-over-south-africa-20231117-p5ekou.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Malcolm Conn"],"video_url":null,"description":"Captain Pat Cummins’ side will meet the raging hot favourites at Ahmedabad on Sunday after a dramatic three-wicket victory on a difficult pitch.","content":"Australia are chasing a sixth World Cup title after captain Pat Cummins hit the winning runs in a dramatic three-wicket victory over a heart-broken South Africa in Kolkata on Thursday night. The victors meet unbeaten India in the final at Ahmedabad on Sunday after Australia scored 7/215 with 16 balls to spare in reply to South Africa’s 212 on a difficult, worn and weary pitch. Australia’s captain Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc celebrate their win in their semi-final match against South Africa. Credit: AP “I was pretty calm, I think Patty was pretty calm as well, and whilst it was pretty close we had plenty of time,” bowling and batting hero Mitchell Starc said after the match. “Nice to squeeze past and make it to a final.” Australia’s target was 213, just one short of what South Africa unsuccessfully chased during their most famous of semi-final chokes at Edgbaston during the 1999 World Cup. They are yet to qualify for a World Cup final. Cummins has shown a knack for finishing big matches, hitting the winning runs in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston earlier this year and during his first Test in South Africa 12 years ago. He also held up an end for Glenn Maxwell to score his brilliant 201 not out against Afghanistan last week in a victory that assured Australia’s semi-final place. Starc, unbeaten on 16 from 38 balls, was with Cummins at the end. He was 14 not out from 29 balls. “It’s why we play the game, to take on the best,” Starc said of Sunday’s final against unbeaten India. Starc is one of five players in the team who were part of the 2015 triumph over New Zealand at the MCG. Cummins and Mitchell Marsh were in the squad. South Africa’s struggles began despite winning the toss and batting first, when they have played their most explosive cricket in this tournament. Instead, they collapsed to 4/24 in 11.5 overs against the Test quality bowling of Starc (3/34) and Hazlewood (2/12) on a pitch which began with early moisture after being under covers. “I think our power play was probably what got us on our way. Other key moments throughout the day with bat and ball, but to start the game like that with Joshy and I, power play wickets have probably been not our strong suit throughout the tournament, so it was nice to have the power play 2-18 (after 10 overs).” Australia’s Glenn Maxwell reacts after being bowled out. Credit: AP By contrast Travis Head, who was at his most wild and damaging, hammering 62 in just 48 balls with nine fours and two sixes. He and David Warner (29 in 18 balls with four sixes) swished and swatted their way to 0/24 in just 3.3 overs on the way to an opening partnership of 60 in 6.1 overs. It was an attempt to nullify an increasingly uncertain pitch and ensure Australia were well ahead of the run rate should the cyclone forming in the Bay of Bengal arrive to spoil the party. A washout would have seen South Africa go through to the final after finishing second above Australia on run rate. Such were the pitch conditions, it was telling that South Africa bowled more overs of spin than pace. Warner was bowled by part-time off-spinner Aiden Markram’s first ball and Head later went bowled by Keshav Maharaj’s initial delivery. In between Mitch Marsh was brilliantly caught by a flying Rassie van der Dussen in the covers for a six-ball duck slashing at a short ball from Kagiso Rabada. Gerald Coetzee of South Africa celebrates after dismissing Steven Smith. Credit: Getty Images Having survived a review on four, Labuschagne wasn’t so fortunate on 18 when he missed a reverse sweep against Shamsi and umpire Richard Kettleborough agreed with the appeal. This time the umpire’s call went in South Africa’s favour. Maxwell went from hero to almost zero in little more than a week. Appearing in his first match since his heroic 201 not out against Afghanistan, Maxwell was beaten first ball by Shami, survived a review for caught behind off a reverse sweep, and perished to what may well have been the worst shot of his career. Loading He aimed a furious hack at a delivery from Shamsi which kept a little low and bowled him for one. Smith (30 in 62 balls) had an equally wild swing against a short of a length ball from Gerald Coetzee that went straight up in the air. It appeared that Inglis (28 in 49 balls) would usher Australia home with Starc’s help, but he was yorked by Coetzee and bowled. South Africa desperately needed a hero and David Miller proved the man. His 101 from 116 balls not only held South Africa’s innings together, he was able to put pressure back on Cummins and the Australians by strategically hitting Adam Zampa out of the attack and taking to Cummins at times. Zampa – the leading bowler in the World Cup with 22 wickets before Mohammed Shami claimed seven in Wednesday’s semi-final against New Zealand to go to 23 – conceded 55 from his seven overs including six sixes.

Despite missing the first half of the league stage matches, Shami has played a vital role in his team's journey towards the final. In the semifinal against New Zealand, Shami took 7/57 in 9.5 overs at an economy rate of 5.79. This is India's best bowling spell in ICC Cricket World Cup history, overtaking Ashish Nehra's 6/23 against England in 2003. Shami's figures are also the fifth-best in World Cup history, with Australia's Glenn McGrath's 7/15 against Namibia in 2003 being the best. A key aspect of Shami's domination is how brilliant he has been against left-arm batters. Though Shami has been a batter's nightmare, it is the left-arm batters he has thrived against. In his WC run this year, Shami has bowled 52 deliveries to left-arm batters. He has conceded just 32 runs against them. Shami's eight out of his 23 wickets in the tournament have been left-handers. The bowler has claimed wickets of Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner and Devon Conway of New Zealand, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali of England, Charith Asalanka of Sri Lanka among the left-handed batters. In six WC 2023 games, Shami has taken 23 wickets at an average of 9.13 and a strike rate of 10.91. His best figures are 7/57. He is the highest wicket-taker in the tournament so far. The pace veteran also completed 50 World Cup wickets, becoming only the seventh bowler to do so. Shami is also the fastest to get there, reaching the milestone in just 17 innings, surpassing Mitchell Starc's (Australia) record of 19 innings. The highest wicket-taker in WC history is Australia's Glenn McGrath with 71 wickets in 39 matches in his World Cup career. Shami now has four five-wicket hauls in Cricket World Cup history, the highest by any bowler. Australian left-arm quick Starc has dropped to second spot with three five-wicket hauls. Advertisement Earlier, on Wednesday, India opted to bat first and scored 397/4 in their 50 overs. Skipper Rohit Sharma (47 in 29 balls, with four boundaries and four sixes) and Shubman Gill (80 in 66 balls, with eight fours and three sixes) delivered a fine start with a 71-run opening stand. Virat Kohli (117 in 113 balls, nine fours and two sixes) posted his 50th ODI ton, while Shreyas Iyer (105 in 70 balls, with four boundaries and eight sixes) scored his second-successive WC century, helping India post a massive score. KL Rahul also delivered a 20-ball cameo of 39 runs, with five fours and two sixes. Tim Southee (3/100) was the pick of the bowlers for the Kiwis. Trent Boult (1/86) also got a wicket. In the chase of 398, Kiwis lost two early wickets. But an 181-run partnership between Daryl Mitchell (134 in 119 balls, with nine fours and six sixes) and skipper Kane Williamson (69 in 73 balls, with eight centuries and a six) kept Kiwis alive and Indian bowlers sweating for answers. Glenn Phillips also played a valuable knock of 41. However, a two-wicket over by Shami changed the game and Men in Blue bowled exceptionally in the death overs to restrict NZ to 327 in 48.5 overs. Besides Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj got a wicket apiece. Shami was adjudged as the 'Player of the Match' for his dream spell.","pubDate":"2023-11-16 18:22:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"73e932add0ec8d28ccf7cd84012b63b5","title":"Sports Minister orders inquiry into allegations made by chief cricket selector","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Sports-Minister-orders-inquiry-into-allegations-made-by-chief-cricket-selector/23-755283","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has requested the Sports Ministry’s Special Investigation Unit for the Prevention of Sports Offences to investigate the recent allegations of corruption made by Sri Lanka’s Cricket Selection Committee Chief Pramodya Wickramasinghe.

The Wesley College Old Boys Union (OBU), led by its effervescent President Captain Navin De Silva, along with Methodist Church President Reverend Ebenezer Joseph, its officials and Wesley College Principal Avanka Fernando officially commenced the Wesley College Restoration Project, at Campbell Park. This ambitious initiative is part of the school's Sesquicentennial celebration which falls on 2 March 2024. This is another milestone in the progressive journey of the Old Boys Union who has undertaken this project of restoring its 120 year old Pavilion, probably one of the Oldest Pavilions amongst Schools in Sri Lanka. Heading this Project as Project Chairman Ivor Maharoof along with able team comprising Treasurer S.Renganathan, Project Secretary Shehan Sheriff and Restoration Building Team lead by K.Dayaparan, Senior Old Boys Lucky Goonathilake, Lalith Wijesinghe, Gerard fernando, Air Vice Marshal Sampath Wickermeratne, Maj Gen Indu Samarakoon, Maithri Vithanage, Shiraz Jaldin- Wesley Sports Administrator, Architect Murad Ismail, Structural Engineer Ajith Vandebona and Quantity Surveyor Ravi Wijesekera they will coordinate closely with the Methodist Church Architect and Structural Engineers during the restoration. Since its inception in 1900, the Pavilion has cradled the cherished memories of countless Wesley College scholars. Now, it stands on the precipice of decay, a dire situation necessitating immediate intervention. The Pavilion's significance as an heritage building , beloved by every Wesleyite to have passed through the school's gates, underscores the urgency to preserve it. In the spirit of Wesley College's rich architectural heritage, the committee has enlisted the talents of the renowned architect, Murad Ismail. With his unparalleled skills, he has willingly accepted the arduous task of designing the restoration. The Pavilion's history dates back to its acquisition by Wesley College from the Tamil Union Cricket & Athletic Club at Campbell Park in 1940. Believed to have been constructed in 1900, the Pavilion is poised to celebrate its 124th anniversary in 2024. The Pavilion was inaugurated on 19 January 1940 by the esteemed old boy, Minister of Labour, Industries and Commerce G.C.S. Corea at the time. Throughout the years, Wesley's Pavilion has been graced by some of Sri Lanka's cricketing legends, including the iconic Mahadevan Sathasivam and a plethora of Wesley College's own cricketing greats. Furthermore, legendary cricketers from rival schools, such as the Gunasekera brothers, Clive Inman, and Michael Tissera, have left their mark on this historic Pavilion. Beyond cricket, generations of Wesley sportsmen in rugby, athletics, soccer, and hockey have found solace and inspiration within these hallowed walls. As a testament to their shared history, every Wesleyite has, at some point, walked through the sacred Pavilion, which stands as a timeless symbol of Wesley's distinguished heritage. The Wesley College Pavilion Restoration Project is not merely a venture; it's a significant and heart-warming endeavour that represents a collective call to all the Wesleyite in every corner of the Globe, to join and together, rekindle 124 years of sporting legacy, ensuring that Wesley College continues to inspire future generations of Wesleyites.","pubDate":"2023-11-16 21:30:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"50f7a1991e854460adb2c950843989cd","title":"Babar Azam resigns as Pakistan captain in all formats","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Babar-Azam-resigns-as-Pakistan-captain-in-all-formats/23-755281","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Pakistan’s Babar Azam has stepped down as captain across all formats of the game following the team’s league-stage exit at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The Pakistan Cricket Board have subsequently announced that Shaheen Shah Afridi will take over as T20I captain and Shan Masood will be the Pakistan Test captain. A decision on the ODI captaincy will be made in due course. The PCB also confirmed that there will be a sizeable change to the coaching staff heading into the tours of Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. “The PCB has changed the portfolio of the entire coaching staff including Director Cricket Mickey Arthur,” a statement read. “All coaches will continue to work in National Cricket Academy while PCB will announce the new coaching staff in due course for the upcoming series in Australia and New Zealand.” Babar has been the multi-format Pakistan captain since 2020, taking on the ODI and Test roles a year after he took charge of the T20 side. But Pakistan’s disappointing campaign at the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India has led to the 29-year-old stepping down with immediate effect. “I vividly remember the moment when I received the call from PCB to lead Pakistan in 2019,” Babar said in a statement released on his social media channels. “Over the past four years, I’ve experienced many highs and lows on and off the field, but I wholeheartedly and passionately aimed to maintain Pakistan’s pride and respect in the cricket world. Reaching the number 1 spot in the white-ball format was a result of the collective efforts of players, coaches, and management, but I’d like to express my gratitude to passionate Pakistan cricket fans for their unwavering support during this journey. Today, I am stepping down as the captain of Pakistan in all formats. It’s a difficult decision but I feel it is a right time for this call.” Pakistan lost five matches during the 2023 tournament, finishing outside of the semi-final qualification places. And Babar was largely off form with the bat, scoring 320 runs in his nine innings and having a top score of just 74. The former top-ranked ODI batter in the world, who averages 56.72 in the format with 19 centuries to his name, says he will continue to be available to play for Pakistan in all formats going forward and will offer his support to whoever takes over as skipper. “I will continue to represent Pakistan as a player in all three formats. I am here to support the new captain and the team with my experience and dedication. I want to express my sincere thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board for entrusting me with this significant responsibility.” The PCB say that Babar “was asked to continue as Test captain” after being relieved of his duties in the white-ball formats, but opted to step down across all formats. “Babar Azam is truly a world-class player and we want him to continue to thrive as a player,” Zaka Ashraf, Chairman of the PCB Management Committee, said. “He is one of the best batters Pakistan has ever produced. He is our asset, and we will continue to support him. His batting prowess is a testament to his dedication and skill. He is a role model for the present generation. “We want to see him grow as a great batter and now without his additional burden of the captaincy, he can focus more on his performances to reach even greater heights. We respect his decision and will continue to back him.”","pubDate":"2023-11-16 21:30:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"80cb539cab83d074895d3ea800648b58","title":"‘Great spectacle of cricket’ – Australia relishing World Cup final against India","link":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/sport/national/23929610.great-spectacle-cricket---australia-relishing-world-cup-final-india/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia booked their place in Sunday’s showpiece against in-form hosts India with a three-wicket win over South Africa.","content":"Australia’s Mitchell Starc was looking forward to “a great spectacle of cricket” after his side book their spot in the World Cup final against hosts India. Starc helped Australia conquer South Africa in the semi-final at Eden Gardens, claiming three for 34 and holding up his end in a vital partnership with captain Pat Cummins during the closing moments of a tense chase. In the end Australia squeaked home by three wickets in a low-scoring encounter, with Starc’s new-ball burst doing a huge amount of heavy lifting. The Finalists are confirmed 🙌🏻 India 🆚 Australia 🏟️ Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad 👌🏻 | — BCCI (@BCCI) He set the tone for the day by removing Proteas skipper Temba Bavuma in the first over, then dismissed Aiden Markram as he and Josh Hazlewood reduced their opponents to 24 for four. The intensity is only going to be dialled up when they take on undefeated home favourites India in Ahmedabad on Sunday, with up to 100,000 locals ready to roar their nation on at the Narendra Modi Stadium. And it is a prospect Starc is ready to embrace. “It’s certainly going to be a big occasion, a World Cup Final in India. It’s going to be loud,” he said. “I think it’s just going to be a great spectacle of cricket, no doubt. There’s going to be a lot of passion there. Certainly, everyone in our changing room is looking forward to it. “I don’t think either changing room is new to big occasions. You want to take on the best and that’s why we play the game. They’ve been the best team in the tournament so far and we both find ourselves in the final. That’s what World Cups are about.” Starc’s skipper, Cummins, was equally enthused about the prospect having been part of Australia’s last ODI world champion squad on home soil eight years ago. “The stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided, but we’ve got to embrace it,” he said. “The 2015 World Cup was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, I can’t wait.” Starc agreed with the idea that over the course of a hard-fought contest against South Africa, Australia’s victory lay in their aggression during the powerplay overs. While he and Hazlewood established a stranglehold over the batters, Travis Head and David Warner went on the attack as they raided 60 runs off the first six. On both occasions, damage was done that could not be clawed back by the Proteas. “We’ve seen throughout the tournament how tough the first 10 overs can be at certain times…when you’re willing to take the game on like that, sometimes you take a little bit of luck with you,” he said. “It certainly went to plan with the ball today and the way we set up with the bat is to really be aggressive, take the game on and the freedom to give those guys to go out and play the way they like to.” Losing coach Rob Walter gave South Africa credit for battling back into contention after their early collapse, making 212 on the back of David Miller’s 101, and insisted the age-old tag of ‘chokers’ was no longer fitting. “It’s obviously gutting to lose a semi-final but beyond that, I’m incredibly proud of the fight shown by the lads,” he said. “I guess you need to define what a ‘choke’ is.

The intensity is only going to be dialled up when they take on undefeated home favourites India in Ahmedabad on Sunday, with up to 100,000 locals ready to roar their nation on at the Narendra Modi Stadium. And it is a prospect Starc is ready to embrace. “It’s certainly going to be a big occasion, a World Cup Final in India. It’s going to be loud,” he said. “I think it’s just going to be a great spectacle of cricket, no doubt. There’s going to be a lot of passion there. Certainly, everyone in our changing room is looking forward to it. “I don’t think either changing room is new to big occasions. You want to take on the best and that’s why we play the game. They’ve been the best team in the tournament so far and we both find ourselves in the final. That’s what World Cups are about.” Starc’s skipper, Cummins, was equally enthused about the prospect having been part of Australia’s last ODI world champion squad on home soil eight years ago. “The stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided, but we’ve got to embrace it,” he said. “The 2015 World Cup was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, I can’t wait.” Starc agreed with the idea that over the course of a hard-fought contest against South Africa, Australia’s victory lay in their aggression during the powerplay overs. While he and Hazlewood established a stranglehold over the batters, Travis Head and David Warner went on the attack as they raided 60 runs off the first six. On both occasions, damage was done that could not be clawed back by the Proteas. “We’ve seen throughout the tournament how tough the first 10 overs can be at certain times…when you’re willing to take the game on like that, sometimes you take a little bit of luck with you,” he said. “It certainly went to plan with the ball today and the way we set up with the bat is to really be aggressive, take the game on and the freedom to give those guys to go out and play the way they like to.” Losing coach Rob Walter gave South Africa credit for battling back into contention after their early collapse, making 212 on the back of David Miller’s 101, and insisted the age-old tag of ‘chokers’ was no longer fitting. “It’s obviously gutting to lose a semi-final but beyond that, I’m incredibly proud of the fight shown by the lads,” he said. “I guess you need to define what a ‘choke’ is. For me, a choke is losing a game that you’re in a position to win.

The victors meet unbeaten India in the final at Ahmedabad on Sunday after Australia scored 7/215 with 16 balls to spare in reply to South Africa’s 212 on a difficult, worn and weary pitch. Australia’s captain Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc celebrate their win in their semi-final match against South Africa. Credit: AP “I was pretty calm, I think Patty was pretty calm as well, and whilst it was pretty close we had plenty of time,” bowling and batting hero Mitchell Starc said after the match. “Nice to squeeze past and make it to a final.” Australia’s target was 213, just one short of what South Africa unsuccessfully chased during their most famous of semi-final chokes at Edgbaston during the 1999 World Cup. They are yet to qualify for a World Cup final. Cummins has shown a knack for finishing big matches, hitting the winning runs in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston earlier this year and during his first Test in South Africa 12 years ago. He also held up an end for Glenn Maxwell to score his brilliant 201 not out against Afghanistan last week in a victory that assured Australia’s semi-final place. Starc, unbeaten on 16 from 38 balls, was with Cummins at the end. He was 14 not out from 29 balls. “It’s why we play the game, to take on the best,” Starc said of Sunday’s final against unbeaten India. Starc is one of five players in the team who were part of the 2015 triumph over New Zealand at the MCG. Cummins and Mitchell Marsh were in the squad. South Africa’s struggles began despite winning the toss and batting first, when they have played their most explosive cricket in this tournament. Instead, they collapsed to 4/24 in 11.5 overs against the Test quality bowling of Starc (3/34) and Hazlewood (2/12) on a pitch which began with early moisture after being under covers. “I think our power play was probably what got us on our way. Other key moments throughout the day with bat and ball, but to start the game like that with Joshy and I, power play wickets have probably been not our strong suit throughout the tournament, so it was nice to have the power play 2-18 (after 10 overs).” Australia’s Glenn Maxwell reacts after being bowled out. Credit: AP By contrast Travis Head, who was at his most wild and damaging, hammering 62 in just 48 balls with nine fours and two sixes. He and David Warner (29 in 18 balls with four sixes) swished and swatted their way to 0/24 in just 3.3 overs on the way to an opening partnership of 60 in 6.1 overs. It was an attempt to nullify an increasingly uncertain pitch and ensure Australia were well ahead of the run rate should the cyclone forming in the Bay of Bengal arrive to spoil the party. A washout would have seen South Africa go through to the final after finishing second above Australia on run rate. Such were the pitch conditions, it was telling that South Africa bowled more overs of spin than pace. Warner was bowled by part-time off-spinner Aiden Markram’s first ball and Head later went bowled by Keshav Maharaj’s initial delivery. In between Mitch Marsh was brilliantly caught by a flying Rassie van der Dussen in the covers for a six-ball duck slashing at a short ball from Kagiso Rabada. Gerald Coetzee of South Africa celebrates after dismissing Steven Smith. Credit: Getty Images Having survived a review on four, Labuschagne wasn’t so fortunate on 18 when he missed a reverse sweep against Shamsi and umpire Richard Kettleborough agreed with the appeal. This time the umpire’s call went in South Africa’s favour. Maxwell went from hero to almost zero in little more than a week. Appearing in his first match since his heroic 201 not out against Afghanistan, Maxwell was beaten first ball by Shami, survived a review for caught behind off a reverse sweep, and perished to what may well have been the worst shot of his career. Loading He aimed a furious hack at a delivery from Shamsi which kept a little low and bowled him for one. Smith (30 in 62 balls) had an equally wild swing against a short of a length ball from Gerald Coetzee that went straight up in the air. It appeared that Inglis (28 in 49 balls) would usher Australia home with Starc’s help, but he was yorked by Coetzee and bowled. South Africa desperately needed a hero and David Miller proved the man. His 101 from 116 balls not only held South Africa’s innings together, he was able to put pressure back on Cummins and the Australians by strategically hitting Adam Zampa out of the attack and taking to Cummins at times. Zampa – the leading bowler in the World Cup with 22 wickets before Mohammed Shami claimed seven in Wednesday’s semi-final against New Zealand to go to 23 – conceded 55 from his seven overs including six sixes.

Despite missing the first half of the league stage matches, Shami has played a vital role in his team's journey towards the final. In the semifinal against New Zealand, Shami took 7/57 in 9.5 overs at an economy rate of 5.79. This is India's best bowling spell in ICC Cricket World Cup history, overtaking Ashish Nehra's 6/23 against England in 2003. Shami's figures are also the fifth-best in World Cup history, with Australia's Glenn McGrath's 7/15 against Namibia in 2003 being the best. A key aspect of Shami's domination is how brilliant he has been against left-arm batters. Though Shami has been a batter's nightmare, it is the left-arm batters he has thrived against. In his WC run this year, Shami has bowled 52 deliveries to left-arm batters. He has conceded just 32 runs against them. Shami's eight out of his 23 wickets in the tournament have been left-handers. The bowler has claimed wickets of Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner and Devon Conway of New Zealand, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali of England, Charith Asalanka of Sri Lanka among the left-handed batters. In six WC 2023 games, Shami has taken 23 wickets at an average of 9.13 and a strike rate of 10.91. His best figures are 7/57. He is the highest wicket-taker in the tournament so far. The pace veteran also completed 50 World Cup wickets, becoming only the seventh bowler to do so. Shami is also the fastest to get there, reaching the milestone in just 17 innings, surpassing Mitchell Starc's (Australia) record of 19 innings. The highest wicket-taker in WC history is Australia's Glenn McGrath with 71 wickets in 39 matches in his World Cup career. Shami now has four five-wicket hauls in Cricket World Cup history, the highest by any bowler. Australian left-arm quick Starc has dropped to second spot with three five-wicket hauls. Advertisement Earlier, on Wednesday, India opted to bat first and scored 397/4 in their 50 overs. Skipper Rohit Sharma (47 in 29 balls, with four boundaries and four sixes) and Shubman Gill (80 in 66 balls, with eight fours and three sixes) delivered a fine start with a 71-run opening stand. Virat Kohli (117 in 113 balls, nine fours and two sixes) posted his 50th ODI ton, while Shreyas Iyer (105 in 70 balls, with four boundaries and eight sixes) scored his second-successive WC century, helping India post a massive score. KL Rahul also delivered a 20-ball cameo of 39 runs, with five fours and two sixes. Tim Southee (3/100) was the pick of the bowlers for the Kiwis. Trent Boult (1/86) also got a wicket. In the chase of 398, Kiwis lost two early wickets. But an 181-run partnership between Daryl Mitchell (134 in 119 balls, with nine fours and six sixes) and skipper Kane Williamson (69 in 73 balls, with eight centuries and a six) kept Kiwis alive and Indian bowlers sweating for answers. Glenn Phillips also played a valuable knock of 41. However, a two-wicket over by Shami changed the game and Men in Blue bowled exceptionally in the death overs to restrict NZ to 327 in 48.5 overs. Besides Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj got a wicket apiece. Shami was adjudged as the 'Player of the Match' for his dream spell.","pubDate":"2023-11-16 18:22:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
