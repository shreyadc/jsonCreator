The Age reports that Indian Premier League teams are taking steps to see if cricket is ripe for a dramatic overhaul, in the same way that LIV Golf has changed the golfing landscape in 2022. LIV Golf split the sport in two this year with lucrative sign-on fees, big prize money, and a reduced playing schedule that convinced many players to leave the sport’s traditional tours. Cricket could be in the early stages of its own upheaval with wealthy IPL franchises said to be plotting how they can dominate the landscape for all 12 months. Watch Australia v England. Every T20 Live & Exclusive to Fox Sports on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > According to The Age , representatives of IPL franchises have had informal discussions with Australian cricketers, via their agents, about taking up 12-month deals. A source familiar with the situation told the publication that $5 million could be the amount needed to sway a prominent Australian cricketer. That would be more than double what Australia’s highest earner, Pat Cummins, makes as Test and ODI captain. Australia puts Sri Lanka to the sword | 04:02 Australia has a number of players that would be major assets and, no doubt, key targets for IPL franchises as they continue their expansion across the globe. Cummins would be highly-sought after, as would David Warner and Glenn Maxwell who are marketable figures with a wealth of IPL experience. The IPL is not looking to expand to a lengthy season but rather some of its franchises are buying or creating clubs in other leagues across the globe. For example, Kolkata Knight Riders own the Trinbago Knight Riders in the Caribbean Premier League, Abu Dhabi in the upcoming UAE International League, and will have a Los Angeles-based team in to-be-launched Major League Cricket. Players could therefore be contracted to the one franchise, and play across their suite of teams around the world. Agents say that there is yet to be genuine interest from their Australian clients, according to The Age , although that could change as players get closer to retirement. Earlier this year, Cricket Australia was faced with its first major player conflict when Warner reportedly asked for permission to play in the UAE league, which overlaps with the Big Bash League. CA eventually stepped in with Warner offered an attractive Sydney Thunder contract, but prior to the deal, Australia legend Adam Gilchrist warned about the serious knock-on effect at stake. “This is the big kicker, isn’t it, of possibly being the step towards being contracted to the club before or over country for the predominant amount of cricket you play,” Gilchrist said on SEN at the time. Will England rest players for Aussies? | 00:59 “There will be other players on the radar, it’s all part of this, I guess, global dominance that these IPL franchises are starting to create given they own a number of teams in the Caribbean Premier League. “If he rides off into the sunset and says, ‘sorry Australian cricket, I’m going to become a gun for hire for my Indian franchise team in various tournaments’, you can’t question him on that, that’s his prerogative and he’s done everything he needs to get the profile and get that market value. “It’s the new younger player coming in that starts to make those noises where it’ll be really challenging.” Although it didn’t come to fruition, Gilchrist proposed the potential for Warner to become Australia’s first player to turn down a central contract and only play for a match fee, as Trent Boult has done for New Zealand. “He goes and plays wherever he wants but says, ‘I’m available for every Test match, for every one-day international and every T20 international’ by way of example, ‘I’ll be there for you in national colours’,” Gilchrist said. “‘But other than that, I’m going to play my club, my franchise cricket, wherever I want to knowing that none of those big tournaments will be clashing with international cricket’.” Meanwhile, Michael Vaughan spoke out against the emergence of franchise leagues in July, when Ben Stokes announced he would be retiring from ODIs. “Bilateral ODI/T20 series will have to go if all the boards around the world are desperate for there own franchise tournaments!” he tweeted. “Something has to give ... it shouldn’t be players retiring from one format aged 31.","pubDate":"2022-10-26 23:04:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rangers spared cricket score in Naples as worst ever Champions League record edges closer","link":"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/rangers/rangers-spared-cricket-score-in-naples-as-worst-ever-champions-league-record-edges-closer-3895040","keywords":["Rangers","Football","Sport"],"creator":["Andrew Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"It says everything about the hideousness of this Champions League tilt for Rangers that their latest hiding may elicit a degree of relief from the under-pressure Giovanni van Bronckhorst.","content":"It was a given that the Ibrox side would be slain by Napoli in the Diego Maradona stadium, and so be potentially only 90 minutes away from a pointless campaign that would represent the worst group showing of any team in the competition's history. Yet, few gave them a chance of avoiding another battering in the bracket of the 7-1 loss to Liverpool last time out. In that sense, escaping with a 3-0 in Naples – and there was a sizeable element of fortune in their avoidance of far heavier punishment – made for an evening that didn't serve up all the indignities practically expected of it. Not so much a crumb of comfort, perhaps, as a half crumb. But something before they have to avoid defeat in next week’s final group encounter at home to Ajax. Never mind the must-win league clash at Aberdeen on Saturday at Ibrox. Context is required. The chasm in levels ensured the contest, as it was, at times had the appearance of Champions League team against Sunday league team. Napoli, though, are a genuinely elite side at their zenith - as evidenced by claiming a club-record 12th straight victory to eclipse the 11 such sequence in the fabled Maradona era. With their bounding, bustling attacking verve, they have filleted Liverpool and Ajax in Group A, and with Giovanni Simeone bagging a five-minute double with hardly a quarter of an hour played, a cricket score seemed set to ensue. Even as they had rested a raft of their big beasts. It didn't because, however fragile van Bronckhorst's team have become, unlike the lop-sided losses in previous group outings, they didn't become toe-curlingly feckless or forlorn. They stuck at their tasks as best they could; with their myriad limitations. As Napoli, in taking their tally in the competition to 19 goals, undoubtedly dropped off. Yet, but for Alfredo Morelos' continued impression of being attached to an invisible truck, they might even have netted. The Colombian falling short in failing to draw more than a comfortable save from Alex Meret when given a chance to break forward at the end of the first, before not being on it when only required to touch in a ball flashed across the box early in the second. Advertisement In a rare start, and first outing in the competition, Ridvan Yilmaz was purposeful, and central as Rangers rallied in the second period. Meanwhile, Malik Tillman showed application and craft to create a few glimpses in the box. It would have been easy to capitulate – Rangers have shown they have that in them – following a nightmarish start. That resulted in an 11th minute opener after Simeone dissected Ben Davies and Leon King to bring down smartly a sumptious curling right-wing cross from Giovanni Di Lorenzo before clubbing it in at the far corner of Allan McGregor's net. Fed from the other side by Mario Rui dropping an inch-perfect cross on his head as the visiting centre-backs were again exposed, Simeone himself seemed on his way to three. As it was, only Napoli arrived at that figure in the 80th minutes through Leo Ostigard snapping his neck muscles to generate incredible power into a header from a corner. The 19th goal Rangers have conceded in Group A, any loss to Ajax would mean a negative goal difference unrivalled by any pointless team in the tournament. Want to join the conversation?

It is with sincere thanks to the difference in Australian time zones that fans around the world will get to see as many as three World Cup matches in a single day. In spite of being a working Thursday, the day will provide enough opportunities for fans in different countries to watch at least one match according to their time zones and preferred slot. Having said that, the second match of the day in the form of the first-ever is expected to entice the maximum attention not only because of the Indian cricket team but also because of a in Sydney during the evening. Sydney, whose 12 T20Is (five won and lost each by teams batting first and second) in the past have returned equal results, will be hosting matches only for the second time in this tournament. First Super 12 match last week, the first T20 World Cup 2022 match at this venue had resulted in an for the home team. All in all, the iconic SCG has hosted a total of 64 Men’s T20s over the years. In all these matches, 200-run mark in an innings has been touched or surpassed on only nine occasions. Unlike many other venues, highest T20 innings total at this venue had been registered in an international match. Readers must note that the two highest run-chases in Sydney T20s belong to India. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that no team has ever chased in excess of 200 runs in a successful T20 run-chase here.","pubDate":"2022-10-26 19:13:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Somewhere we all know what will happen after this World Cup”: Dinesh Karthik’s father hints at son’s retirement after T20 World Cup 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-somewhere-we-all-know-what-will-happen-after-this-world-cup-dinesh-karthiks-father-hints-at-sons-retirement-after-t20-world-cup-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","dinesh karthik","ICC T20 World Cup 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dinesh Karthik’s father hints at son’s retirement following the ongoing T20 World Cup despite making a stellar comeback in the Indian team.

On the back of consistent performances in domestic Cricket, Karthik did make made a return to the Indian team after seven long years in the year 2017, and even went on to play the 2019 ODI World Cup, but the rise of a certain Rishabh Pant during this phase, again forced him to remain out of contention for national call-up. But here we are again, come October 2022, this 37-year-old wicket-keeper batter was not only selected ahead of Pant in India’s playing XI during the ongoing T20 World Cup opener versus Pakistan, but also has been assigned a specific role in the team – that of a finisher. Dinesh Karthik’s father Krishna Kumar, has flown to Sydney, the city where India will next face Netherlands in the ‘Super 12’ stage of the World Cup, to watch his son play for team India once again, and help the side lift the long-awaited format silverware. During an interaction with a pragmatic Krishna Kumar perhaps senses that this might well be Dinesh’s last visit Down Under in the capacity of a team India player, and which has acted as a motivation for him to watch his son in the country for a few days. As per Karthik’s father, the fact that his son is playing for his country at the age of 37 itself is a ‘miracle’, and feels that his selection in the 2023 ODI World Cup next year will only act as a bonus. “For me, seeing him play at the age of 37, itself is a miracle. If he plays in the next year’s ODI World Cup, it will be a bonus for us. At the same time I’m a practical man, somewhere we all know what will happen after this World Cup … so we all decided to fly and see him play in Australia,” remarked Krishna Kumar. Karthik’s return back as a T20 finisher in team India, had a lot to do with his unbelievable strike rate of 220.00 for his IPL franchise RCB during the death Overs in the tournament this year. He scored a total of 242 runs after playing mere 110 deliveries from Overs 16-20 in IPL 2022, at a stupendous average of 80.66.","pubDate":"2022-10-26 19:12:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL changed my cricket, helped me evolve: Stoinis","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-changed-my-cricket-helped-me-evolve-stoinis/article66058315.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        PTI  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Generally tentative against spin, Marcus Stoinis scored 59 off 18 against the Sri Lankan spinners to ensure a confidence-boosting win for the defending champions","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-26 18:26:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Playing against one of the best teams is surreal: Edwards","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/playing-against-one-of-the-best-teams-is-surreal-edwards/article66058423.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Sports Bureau  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"We will play our best brand of cricket and we will do everything we can to win this game, says the Netherlands skipper","content":"Hoping for the best: Skipper Scott Edwards, left, reckons his batting line-up will rise to the occasion against India. | Photo Credit: AFP Pragmatism and hope were the twin attributes that defined the Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards during a pre-match press-conference at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) here on Wednesday evening. Lined up to play India in the ICC T20 World Cup Super 12 game on Thursday, Edwards said: “I don't think there are many people out there expecting us to win.

The India versus Pakistan clash which took place last Sunday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is the only contest in the ongoing T20 World so far which went down the wire, with India nearly miraculously getting the better of their neighbours on the final delivery. Come yet another World Cup match involving Pakistan, the Asian country is yet again dominating the headlines although for a rather bizarre non-cricketing reason involving the ever-famous TV character ‘Mr. Bean’. Ahead of Pakistan’s next T20 World Cup clash against Zimbabwe on Thursday at the Perth Stadium, Pakistan Cricket’s official Twitter handle posted some pictures of their players training in the nets. As a reply to the aforementioned Twitter post, a certain Ngugi Chasura, possibly a fan from Zimbabwe, angrily sort of vowed to ‘settle the matter’ against Pakistan on Thursday, while also suggesting the Pakistani fans to pray that rains save their team from getting defeated. PAK Bean: What is the matter all about? When a couple of Pakistan Twitter users tried to get into the crux of the matter and the reason for the person’s anger, the latter hilariously revealed that Pakistan had sent a person impersonating as Mr. Bean or the legendary British actor Rowan Atkinson in one of Zimbabwe’s’ local events, while accusing him of ‘stealing’ people’s money during his visit to the African nation.

Gorman and club stalwart Lindsay Pankhurst, who dominated with the ball, emerged as the key figures as the defending premiers enjoyed a first win of the season at Wallace Park. After openers Ash Malec (19) and Rob Head (48) put on 66, Hannans lost 2-5 at one point before Gorman showcased his batting for the second consecutive match that featured nine fours and a six. After compiling 40 in a losing round one effort against North Kalgoorlie, Gorman defied the Viewers’ attack for 151 minutes and 109 balls in Hannans’ 8-228. Head was also impressive compiling 48 off 35 balls with seven fours and two sixes. Prash Nagaraja grabbed 4-36 for Lake View, but they were dismissed for 112 in 34.5 overs on Pankhurst’s brilliant 6-27. It was a career-best spell from Pankhurst, a former wicket-keeper whose previous best bowling was 4-12 nine years ago. Pankhurst, who has been an A-grade captain and player-coach in a long career with Hannans, is just three shy of the 150-game milestone. Recruit Matt Carter and fellow opener Mark Williams put on 41 — Carter leading the way with an aggressive 40 off 48 balls. But the Viewers again proved to be their own worst enemy, losing 7-30, with Luke Boxhall’s 15 the next-highest score among the side’s 112 in 34.5 overs. Lake View have opened the season with two defeats after failing to bat out 35 overs in either match. Since winning the A-grade flag in 2016-17, the Viewers have endured five consecutive last-place finishes. However, they have made efforts to improve by appointing former Perth first-grade player Dave Roberts as captain-coach and acquired high-profile recruits Carter and Boxhall from North Kalgoorlie and Hannans, respectively. Boxhall won last season’s O’Shaughnessy Medal as the competition’s leading player. Hannans are in pursuit of a third flag in four seasons.

Bennell’s 102, carved from 104 balls in 142 minutes and highlighted by five fours and six sixes, guided last season’s runners-up to 8-251. It was an innings lauded by Great Boulder player-coach Dylan Hinchliffe after Bennell equalled club stalwart Todd Altus’ five A-grade centuries, but in remarkably fewer matches. Bennell, who has returned to Great Boulder after a season in Bunbury, also boasts three centuries for Norths where he originally played after his Goldfields arrival for the 2017-18 season. “To put that into perspective, the club record is five (centuries) and it took Todd 367 games to make them and yesterday (Saturday) was Bev’s 30th A-grade game,” Hinchliffe said. “Rushy (Josh Rushmore) has probably been the best all-round cricketer here over the past 10 years and he’s made three (centuries) and Bev’s made five in 30 games, plus a few for North Kalgoorlie before that. “You look back at some of the legends of Great Boulder, blokes like Dave Sheehan, Biffer Thomas and Mel Gallagher — these guys all played 200 games and made three and four hundreds. “It will be a great story when he breaks the record and I’d expect that to be in the next couple of months.” Bennell’s highest EGCA score is 138 against Norths in round 13 of the 2019-20 season and from two matches of this campaign, he has compiled 183 runs at 91.50. “You want to say that it (Bennell’s consistency) is unbelievable but it’s not, in the sense he produces it so often,” Hinchliffe said. “It almost becomes an expectation (because) you just sit back sometimes and shake your head.” Bennell’s latest ton was backed by Rushworth’s 33 off 48 balls and recruit Nick Fitzgerald, whose 36 from the No.7 spot came off 33 deliveries and included four boundaries and a six. “Nick is new to the club this season, has set really high standards at practice and has probably been our best trainer over the course of the pre-season and the first two rounds of the regular season,” Hinchliffe said. “We had a good chat about what we see his role being in the team and it couldn’t have worked out much better than it did. “Nick’s originally from Bunbury, played a bit for Perth Cricket Club in the WACA competition and as a school teacher, had been in Kalgoorlie-Boulder for a while without actually playing cricket. “He’s been another one who has fallen in our laps — we got a bit lucky with Nick and he’s been a great addition to the club so far.” Norths opener Trent Mais top-scored for 28 in reply, but the side was bundled out for 74 in 31.2 overs as Liam Johnson grabbed 3-8 and Vaibhav Khangaomer 2-14. Great Boulder have opened the season with two wins while Norths, after beating Hannans in the season-opener a week earlier, slipped to 1-1. Meanwhile, Norths’ members and supporters are mourning the death earlier this month of life member Marilyn Turner, who was matriarch of one of the club’s most prominent families. The club’s under-17 team, including Mrs Turner’s grandchildren Georgie and Fletcher, wore black arm bands last weekend in her honour. A date for Mrs Turner’s funeral has yet to be confirmed.

Bennell, who has returned to Great Boulder after a season in Bunbury, also boasts three centuries for Norths where he originally played after his Goldfields arrival for the 2017-18 season. “To put that into perspective, the club record is five (centuries) and it took Todd 367 games to make them and yesterday (Saturday) was Bev’s 30th A-grade game,” Hinchliffe said. “Rushy (Josh Rushmore) has probably been the best all-round cricketer here over the past 10 years and he’s made three (centuries) and Bev’s made five in 30 games, plus a few for North Kalgoorlie before that. “You look back at some of the legends of Great Boulder, blokes like Dave Sheehan, Biffer Thomas and Mel Gallagher — these guys all played 200 games and made three and four hundreds. “It will be a great story when he breaks the record and I’d expect that to be in the next couple of months.” Bennell’s highest EGCA score is 138 against Norths in round 13 of the 2019-20 season and from two matches of this campaign, he has compiled 183 runs at 91.50. “You want to say that it (Bennell’s consistency) is unbelievable but it’s not, in the sense he produces it so often,” Hinchliffe said. “It almost becomes an expectation (because) you just sit back sometimes and shake your head.” Bennell’s latest ton was backed by Rushworth’s 33 off 48 balls and recruit Nick Fitzgerald, whose 36 from the No.7 spot came off 33 deliveries and included four boundaries and a six. “Nick is new to the club this season, has set really high standards at practice and has probably been our best trainer over the course of the pre-season and the first two rounds of the regular season,” Hinchliffe said. “We had a good chat about what we see his role being in the team and it couldn’t have worked out much better than it did. “Nick’s originally from Bunbury, played a bit for Perth Cricket Club in the WACA competition and as a school teacher, had been in Kalgoorlie-Boulder for a while without actually playing cricket. “He’s been another one who has fallen in our laps — we got a bit lucky with Nick and he’s been a great addition to the club so far.” Norths opener Trent Mais top-scored for 28 in reply, but the side was bundled out for 74 in 31.2 overs as Liam Johnson grabbed 3-8 and Vaibhav Khangaomer 2-14. Great Boulder have opened the season with two wins while Norths, after beating Hannans in the season-opener a week earlier, slipped to 1-1. Meanwhile, Norths’ members and supporters are mourning the death earlier this month of life member Marilyn Turner, who was matriarch of one of the club’s most prominent families. The club’s under-17 team, including Mrs Turner’s grandchildren Georgie and Fletcher, wore black arm bands last weekend in her honour. A date for Mrs Turner’s funeral has yet to be confirmed.

England suffered a shock defeat in their T20 World Cup opener in Australia, as Ireland claimed another momentous victory over the Three Lions. Ireland beat England back in 2011 edition of the World Cup and have now enjoyed another famous victory, winning by five runs under the DLS [Duckworth-Lewis-Stern] method, when a downpour at the MCG cut short the match. It’s the latest big result for the Irish at this tournament, having claimed a win over West Indies by nine wickets to knock out the two-time champions and set up this clash with England in Melbourne. It was not the start England were hoping for, with Jos Buttler’s men one of the favourites for the tournament. And talkSPORT host Jacobs launched into a scathing rant about England’s performance, as he also took aim at DLS. “It was an astonishingly poor performance,” said the Hawksbee and Jacobs host. “Ireland and Scotland only play well against England. Every other game they just can’t be bothered. “Why don’t you play like that in every game? It drives me mad. I can’t stand it in football teams and I can’t stand it in national teams. It’s annoying. “If you are good enough to play that well, you should be able to play like that in every game and not just against England. “That means they must be below their level in every other game then. “Duckworth-Lewis should banned in T20. You’ve got Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone, two of the best six hitters in the world cricket… it’s pathetic. “It doesn’t work in T20 cricket. Get rid of it. If it’s rained off then give one point each. “They [Ireland] won’t win another game this tournament, you just know that.” Former Ireland International Niall O’Brien also joined Hawksbee and Jacobs and even he wasn’t safe from Andy’s rant. “We are never shy of a bit of rain in Ireland, so glad we took a bit to Ireland,” O’Brien said. Jacobs added: “Your two best players were Tony O’Duckworth and Brendan O’Lewis. Tremendous.”","pubDate":"2022-10-26 17:34:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Michael Yardy appointed as England men’s U-19 head coach","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/michael-yardy-appointed-england-men-u19-head-coach-ecb/article66058303.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Team Sportstar  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Former all-rounder Yardy takes the position vacated by Richard Dawson, who has joined Matthew Mott’s coaching team for the senior men’s white-ball cricket side.","content":"Former England all-rounder Michael Yardy has been appointed as the head coach of the England Men’s U19 team, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Wednesday.

Known as ‘Baby AB’ due to his uncanny resemblance with the South African legendary cricketer AB de Villiers’s style of batting, Dewald Brevis has trudged a path of ascendency since his remarkable batting performance during the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup in West Indies this year. Impressed by his potential, he was also roped in by the five-time IPL franchise Mumbai Indians (MI) during the mega auction that took place a month later, where he played seven matches for the franchise, and turned up with a few eye-catching innings, like the one versus Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Pune, which made him a household name. Even during this year’s Caribbean Premier League (CPL), he turned the Cricket fans’ attention towards him, when he smashed 5 Sixes off the six deliveries he faced while playing for the St Kitts and Nevis Patriots at Guyana. On the social media platform Twitter, the 19-year-old was yet again the point of discussion, when an argument of sorts broke out between the legendary South African batter Herschelle Gibbs and South Africa’s Performance Analyst from 2010-2021, regarding whether or not he deserves a place in the Proteas national side at the earliest. Dewald Brevis IPL salary During the mega auction ahead of IPL’s 15th edition this year, Dewald Brevis was roped in at a hefty amount of INR 3 Crores. Having registered himself for the auction at the base price of INR 20 Lakhs, Brevis finally became part of the MI squad, after the likes of Punjab Kings (PBKS) and later the four-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) also showed keen interest to rope in this rising Proteas talent in their squad. What is the net worth of Baby AB de Villiers? As per reports, Dewald Brevis’ net worth is to the tune of $2 million in the year 2022, which roughly translates to around INR 16 Crore.

Questions were raised against Hardik's fitness when he was seen having cramps towards the end of India's chase against Pakistan at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday. While he could not score as freely as he would have liked to, Hardik played a fine second fiddle to Virat Kohli, who eventually helped India cross the line. Kohli remained unbeaten on 82 off 53 balls as India defeated Pakistan by four wickets on the final delivery of the game. India are due to take on Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Thursday (Oct. 27) in their Super 12 fixture. Clearing any doubts about Hardik's chances of making it to India's playing XI against the Dutchmen, Mhambrey said,: \"He (Hardik Pandya) is alright. He is fit to play.\" \"We are not going to rest anyone. I think we have a momentum going in the tournament, you need individuals to be in the form as well,\" Mhambrey added in the press conference on the eve of the match. The Indian bowling coach also said that Hardik deserved the credit for Kohli's match-winning knock against Pakistan. While Kohli anchored the innings and hammered Pakistan bowlers, Hardik stood at the other end to support the former India captain. \"Hardik wants to play all matches. We are not looking at whom to rest. He is an important player for us, he is bowling as well as batting for us. Other than that, his attitude on the ground like in the last match (against Pakistan) he played a crucial innings. \"Yes, Virat finished the match for us but at such a stage if you want an experienced player to take the match to the end then the pressure will obviously shift on the opposition. So, I think Hardik deserves a lot of credit for Virat's performance. When he went in to bat the conditions were different I think 4 wickets had already fallen. It was not an easy phase. I think the experience that Hardik brings in is irreplaceable,\" added Mhambrey further. In the first innings against Pakistan, Hardik also picked up three wickets and finished with figures of 3 for 30 in his quota of four overs.","pubDate":"2022-10-26 16:05:01","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/10/26/500x300_1318006-t20-world-cup.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Netherlands pitch report tomorrow match Sydney: SCG pitch report for T20 World Cup Super 12 match","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-india-vs-netherlands-pitch-report-tomorrow-match-sydney-scg-pitch-report-for-t20-world-cup-super-12-match/","keywords":["Cricket","ICC T20 World Cup 2022","India","Netherlands","Sydney Cricket Ground"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Netherlands pitch report tomorrow match Sydney: The SCG will host its second and third match of the ongoing T20 World Cup tomorrow.

As for the Netherlands, who lost their first ‘Super 12’ encounter against Bangladesh by 9 runs, will be wary of the threat this Indian side possess, and will give it their all to make sure they aren’t the red carpets to be walked on by the star Indian players. Interestingly, the two teams will be up against each other for the first time in the T20 format, having only met each other twice, during the 2003 and the 2011 ODI World Cup. India vs Netherlands pitch report tomorrow match Sydney The Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) will first host the Bangladesh versus South Africa World Cup match earlier in the day. Thus, India will take on the Dutch on a used pitch at the venue tomorrow four hours later. Last Saturday, Australia took on New Zealand during the first match of the ‘Super 12’ stage at this very venue, when the Kiwis piled on 200 runs on the scoreboard batting first, to annihilate the defending champions by 89 runs. Expect the batters to have a day out yet again at the SCG on Thursday as well, with the slowness of the used pitch likely to bring the spinners into play during the middle-Overs. Across the 11 T20Is at this venue so far, the average score is 169 runs, which further attests to the expected nature of this surface.

India vs Netherlands ICC T20 World Cup 2022 match in Sydney on Thursday will be the 23rd match of the tournament, 11th in Super 12s, third at this venue and second for both the teams in this particular round. The match is scheduled to begin immediately after the conclusion of Match 22 between South Africa and Bangladesh in the afternoon. With rain predicted to pour over the SCG in the first match, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the start time of the second match gets delayed. Having said that, weather forecast for India-Netherlands contest is quite supportive of live action to happen. Readers must note that both India and Netherlands have started this round in contrasting manner. While India were involved in a nail-biting cliffhanger against Pakistan which will be remembered for ages, Netherlands had ended up on the losing side in a low-profile match against Bangladesh. India vs Netherlands T20 head to head records It is worth mentioning that this match will mark the first-ever instance of these two teams facing each other in a T20I. Therefore, there are no head-to-head records for an India-Netherlands T20I. Historically, India and Netherlands have faced each other in a couple of ODIs during ICC Cricket World Cup 2003 and ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. India, who had emerged as the victorious side on both the occasions, will have sight on a third consecutive victory against Netherlands across formats. India batter Virat Kohli and Netherlands batter Tom Cooper are the only two cricketers to have played that match 11 years ago. As far as taking part in T20Is at the Sydney Cricket Ground is concerned, India have won three and lost one out of their four matches in the past here. Netherlands, on the other hand, will be playing at this iconic venue for the first time tomorrow.
