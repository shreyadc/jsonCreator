Four teams will compete in this inaugural edition on the basis of the single league format. The interesting part is that every team will be allowed to include four to five foreign players for the first edition, meaning 16 to 20 foreign players are expected to compete in the inaugural league. Besides that, the best of locals will be seen in action that could well be organised with the last part of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2023,” a source within the Board said. The PCB is currently considering two windows for the inaugural edition of the women league with the first one is to organise it with the PSL in late March 2023. “The 2023 PSL is expected to start from late February 2023 and will run till late March. One option available for the PCB is to organise the inaugural edition of the women’s league with the last part of PSL. Seven matches will be played in the first edition that could well be played parallel with the last seven matches of the PSL —meaning the day would start with the women’s league match followed by the men’s PSL match late in the evening. It is believed that such a format will add extra spice in the league and would help in introducing the women’s format to the general public,” the source said. The same format was used by the ICC for women T20I World Cup from 2012 to 2016, therefore it may well be a success as well. Once the Women’s World Cup got popular, the ICC separated it from the men’s edition from 2016 onward. Moreover, the PCB also believes that it would help in saving extra expenditures. “By organising the inaugural edition with the men’s event, the PCB expects to save a huge amount that otherwise would have to be spent on broadcasting and marketing of the event. On one hand it will help in instantly introducing the women league and on the other it would help save extra expenditure,” the source said. The second window comes in May 2023 when the New Zealand team will be in Pakistan to play five ODIs and as many T20Is and the League could well be organised during that tour too. One good thing, as per source, about the May window is that the majority of leading international women players would be easily available for the League. However, the source said that the weather in May usually turns very hot which should be considered. In the women PSL, it will be mandatory for all four teams to include two under-19 players in the line-up. “Once all the details are finalised we would be in a position to name teams. The inaugural women franchise team names however will be different from the one we have for PSL and for the Junior League. What we want is to make the women’s league a real brand and for that we will have to use the best available options to make an immediate impression,” the source added.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"We played stupid cricket: Rahul wants his batters to play more smartly","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/05/01/we-played-stupid-cricket-rahul-wants-his-batters-to-play-more-smartly/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pune: “We played stupid cricket with the bat,” said Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul after eking out a 20-run win over Punjab Kings in a low-scoring IPL game.

LSG managed 153 for 8 before their bowlers rallied to restrict Punjab to 133 for eight. “I was disappointed and fuming at the end of the first innings. Stupid cricket with the bat,” Rahul said at the post match presentation. “We need to get better with the bat. Half-time, when Quinny and Deepak were batting. They paced it really really well to get to 60 in 9 overs on a tricky wicket. Had we batted smartly, we could have gotten to 180-190. “I think we just need to be smarter in reading the game. If we could have not played too many shots we could have done better. We have been good on the field and good with the ball. Just need to keep repeating the good things.” After an underwhelming show with the bat, LSG bowlers put up a spirited display as pacer Dushmantha Chameera (2/17) and Krunal Pandya (2/11) grabbed two wickets each. “The way we responded with the ball was phenomenal. Krunal has been brilliant throughout the tournament. This season he has really worked on his bowling. Bowling economically is important but he has been giving us two three wickets in the middle overs,” Rahul added. Meanwhile, a disappointed Punjab Kings skipper Mayank Agarwal rued the dismal batting effort. “I think we just kept losing wickets. We had batsmen who were set and we kept getting out. So many soft dismissals for us. It is disappointing and we have to face the truth. We didn’t bat well enough and we were below par with the bat.” —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-04-30 21:02:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Virat Kohli Fires Back To Form With Fifty vs Gujarat Titans, Twitter Goes Berserk - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9ndC12cy1yY2ItdmlyYXQta29obGktZmlyZXMtYmFjay10by1mb3JtLXdpdGgtZmlmdHktdnMtZ3VqYXJhdC10aXRhbnMtdHdpdHRlci1nb2VzLWJlcnNlcmstMjkzNDYwONIBiQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9ndC12cy1yY2ItdmlyYXQta29obGktZmlyZXMtYmFjay10by1mb3JtLXdpdGgtZmlmdHktdnMtZ3VqYXJhdC10aXRhbnMtdHdpdHRlci1nb2VzLWJlcnNlcmstMjkzNDYwOC9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Virat Kohli Fires Back To Form With Fifty vs Gujarat Titans, Twitter Goes Berserk  NDTV SportsLive match blog - RCB vs Titans 43rd Match 2022 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfoGT vs RCB: Revealed - Why Anuj Rawat Is Keeping Wickets For RCB Instead Of Dinesh Karthik  Cricket AddictorLive Cricket Score: GT v RCB, Match 43, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzGT vs RCB Preview, Game Day | IPL 2022  Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-30 19:01:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"David Mumbai Indians: Tim David international team which country","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-david-mumbai-indians-tim-david-international-team-which-country/","keywords":["Cricket","IPL 2022","Mumbai Indians","Indian Premier League","IPL","MI","Tim David"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"David Mumbai Indians: The Singapore-born cricketer was roped in by the Mumbai Indians at a hefty amount of INR 8.25 Crore ahead of IPL 2022.

Staying right till the end, his 20* runs off nine deliveries did prove to be quite handy for MI to register their presence in the ‘W’ column of the points table, despite having lost the opportunity to book their berth for the Playoffs.

The 26-year-old Singapore-born batter, who is renowned for his big hits in the various T20 franchise leagues, made his international debut for Singapore in July 2019.

Tim David international team which country Bereft of any First-Class Cricket experience, Tim David has played 14 T20Is for Singapore. The middle-order batter, however, has made his mark across various T20 franchise leagues in the world including the BBL, CPL, PSL, and the T20 Blast, batting with a remarkable strike rate of around 160. He, however is eligible and available for selection in the Australian national Cricket team, as the International Cricket Council (ICC) rules make him eligible for representing Australia, despite him having played for Singapore.   The post David Mumbai Indians: Tim David international team which country appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-04-30 18:35:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, RR vs MI Highlights: Mumbai Indians Down RR To Register First Win Of The Season - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaXBsLTIwMjItcnItdnMtbWktbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLXJhamFzdGhhbi1yb3lhbHMtdnMtbXVtYmFpLWluZGlhbnMtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS0yOTM0ODgw0gGAAWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaXBsLTIwMjItcnItdnMtbWktbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLXJhamFzdGhhbi1yb3lhbHMtdnMtbXVtYmFpLWluZGlhbnMtbGl2ZS1zY29yZS0yOTM0ODgwL2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, RR vs MI Highlights: Mumbai Indians Down RR To Register First Win Of The Season  NDTV SportsIPL 2022, RR vs MI Highlights: Mumbai break losing streak, win by 5 wickets  The Indian ExpressRR vs MI Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Royals vs Mumbai, Indian Premier League 2022, 44th Match  ESPNcricinfoRR vs MI: Mumbai Indians end 8-match losing streak, get maiden IPL 2022 win  Hindustan TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-30 18:11:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Three top US athletes invest in Rajasthan Royals","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/three-top-us-athletes-invest-in-rajasthan-royals/articleshow/91219063.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Though the details of the investment haven’t been disclosed, the deal is yet another reminder of the potential of T20 cricket, and the attraction of the IPL, the most popular T20 league in the world, among investors.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-30 17:19:31","image_url":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-1200,imgsize-2889133,resizemode-4,msid-91219063/three-top-us-athletes-invest-in-rajasthan-royals.jpg","source_id":"economictimes_indiatimes","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, RR vs MI Live Score Updates: SKY, Tilak Varma keep Mumbai alive - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLXJyLXZzLW1pLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtb25saW5lLTc4OTUwMDgv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, RR vs MI Live Score Updates: SKY, Tilak Varma keep Mumbai alive  The Indian ExpressRR vs MI Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Royals vs Mumbai, Indian Premier League 2022, 44th Match  ESPNcricinfoReady for RR vs MI | Mumbai Indians  Mumbai IndiansIPL 2022: Match 44, RR vs MI Match Prediction – Who will win today’s IPL match between RR vs MI?  CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-30 17:19:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Umran Malik, the pacer who can rattle batters at speeds of 150 kmph","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/umran-malik-the-pacer-who-can-rattle-batters-at-speeds-of-150-kmph/articleshow/91218852.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Malik has the pace.

The new director of England men’s cricket is starting a great repeal of his policies and coaching structure, however, with the ailing Test team given immediate priority. After a single all-format coach under Giles, one lumped with selection in the final throes of the old regime, come two as-yet unnamed head coaches for Test and white-ball cricket; budgets permitting, separate coaching teams too. Key said the two chiefs will probably rarely cross paths and the search for a new national selector, a role described as “antiquated” by Giles after making Ed Smith redundant last year, is also under way. Rob Key hints at open door for Alex Hales to make England return Read more Split head coaches should probably have come sooner but then Giles was burned back in the day, the junior white-ball partner to Andy Flower’s Test supremo from late 2012 to early 2014. Giles felt he got second dibs on resources, Flower power was ultimately at its greatest and, by the end, after England were whitewashed in the Ashes and flunked a World T20 in Bangladesh, both men at least agreed it hadn’t worked. Key, however, is prepared to try again and looking ahead to next winter – a solid block of touring from September to March that features trips to Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh and the small matter of a T20 World Cup in Australia – his hand has practically been forced. Communication will be a paramount and Key will play King Solomon if there is a dispute over who gets what. It is clear the Test side will come first after last year’s well-intended but inflexible rotation shemozzle. “We know that the T20 World Cup is there on the schedule,” said Key. “But at the moment the focus is solely getting this Test team up and running. That can go all the way through to the end of the South Africa series [in September] I think. There will be series in white-ball cricket [a short tour of the Netherlands in June, plus the visits of India and South Africa in July] where you have the mainstay of the squad but not the absolute best XI. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing. “You have to make it clear to the coaches when they take this job. You might be the white-ball coach, but that does not mean having the luxury of the multi-format cricketers every single game. That’s not a bad thing because there is a chance we could sustain that set-up for longer by younger players coming in. We can still hit the World Cup all guns blazing.” Ben Stokes has been appointed England Test captain to replace Joe Root. Photograph: Andrew Fosker/Seconds Left/Shutterstock England’s national teams are starting to become increasingly separated. With Moeen Ali retired from Test cricket and Dawid Malan and Jos Buttler also out of the frame, it leaves Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood as the main multi-format players. Saqib Mahmood may also be coveted by both head coaches in time but Jofra Archer is unlikely to play Tests this summer, his return from elbow surgery due to start in limited-overs cricket. Ravi Shastri: ‘Rob Key will develop a thick skin. Every day you are judged’ | Ali Martin Read more Another reason for Key splitting the role is to broaden his options. The franchise T20 world offers highly paid roles with plenty of time at home and so to compete, the work-life balance for an England job must be similarly appealing. The Test role, he believes, should be hugely attractive regardless, despite five successive winless series for the first time in the team’s 145-year history. “We all think it would be great to take on the white-ball team,” he said. “They won the World Cup and are one of the best teams in [Twenty20 cricket]. But actually the red-ball team, if you are a coach and your ambition is to improve players and teams, there’s no better [project] to take on than England.” Interviews for the head coach roles will begin on 9 May and one of the first questions a panel of Key, Tom Harrison and Andrew Strauss will ask Test candidates is how they intend to complement Stokes. Appointing the captain first, he said, provides clarity here and any coach worth their salt should adapt to meet the all-rounder’s needs, covering off any weaknesses and ensuring he is not overburdened. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford and Simon Katich appear to be vying for this role, while Key said Eoin Morgan, the limited-overs captain, will have a strong say in identifying the head coach from his experiences in the white-ball world. Unless Paul Collingwood is Morgan’s man here, it looks increasingly likely that both appointments will hail from overseas. “The majority of the names coming at you will be overseas coaches,” Key said. “[But] that can’t be right. That is a fault of the system. How many English coaches of the national side have we had in 30 years? Two or three? We have to sort that out.” Giles said the same when he hired Chris Silverwood, describing the lack of domestic options – bar his chosen man, obviously – as a “sorry state of affairs”. Once Key is done overhauling his predecessor’s England set-up, he will need to address a subject on which they agree.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef9755f9d82771af6980380b1affcc08aacfd1d2/0_151_5292_3177/master/5292.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5813eaf77a5d8a587681bb7a0a475f51","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"GT vs RCB, IPL 2022 Highlights: Tewatia, Miller fire Gujarat to 5th straight victory - India Today","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3Nwb3J0cy9pcGwtMjAyMi9zdG9yeS9ndC12cy1yY2ItbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1pcGwtdG9kYXktbWF0Y2gtdXBkYXRlcy1ndWphcmF0LXZzLWJhbmdhbG9yZS1tdW1iYWktMTk0MzgyMS0yMDIyLTA0LTMw0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL3Nwb3J0cy9pcGwtMjAyMi9zdG9yeS9ndC12cy1yY2ItbGl2ZS1zY29yZS1pcGwtdG9kYXktbWF0Y2gtdXBkYXRlcy1ndWphcmF0LXZzLWJhbmdhbG9yZS1tdW1iYWktMTk0MzgyMS0yMDIyLTA0LTMw?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"GT vs RCB, IPL 2022 Highlights: Tewatia, Miller fire Gujarat to 5th straight victory  India TodayLive Cricket Score: GT v RCB, Match 43, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIPL 2022, GT vs RCB Highlights: David Miller, Rahul Tewatia Power GT To 6-Wicket Win Over RCB  NDTV SportsGT vs RCB: Revealed - Why Anuj Rawat Is Keeping Wickets For RCB Instead Of Dinesh Karthik  Cricket AddictorLive match blog - RCB vs Titans 43rd Match 2022 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-30 16:41:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 | Fifty-plus goalie; Anushka Sharma cheering and celebrating","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/ipl-2022-fifty-plus-goalie-anushka-sharma-cheering-and-celebrating/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","India","IPL","IPL 2022","The world","world"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: Former Royal Challengers Bangalore captain and star Virat Kohli has recorded his first fifty in the current IPL season.

Shimron Hetmyer walks out to bat. 14.1 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Mumbai find a wicket at a crucial time. A length ball, around middle, Sams rolls his fingers on it. Daryl Mitchell looks to heave it but splices it in the air and inside the ring where the birthday boy, Rohit Sharma at covers takes it. Even Daryl Mitchell was struggling with his innings and he takes the long walk back to the pavilion now. 13.6 overs (0 Run) This one is short and around off, it skids through. Buttler positions to pull this but gets a bottom edge and it drops on the off side. A superb spell from Kumar Kartikeya in his first outing. He finishes with figures of 4-0-19-1. 13.5 overs (1 Run) Another single as this time Daryl Mitchell hits it to long on. 13.4 overs (1 Run) Fuller and on middle. Buttler works it to long on for a single. Halt in play. There seems to be some issue with the sight screen behind the keeper.

Mitchell hits it to long on for a single. 13.2 overs (0 Run) Fuller, on middle, leg spinner. Mitchell looks to heave as he clears his front leg but misses. 13.1 overs (1 Run) Tossed up, quicker and on off. Buttler skips down and pushes it to covers for a single. Strategic break! Mumbai have bowled well so far and they have managed to keep Buttler quiet. The pitch seems to be a bit on the slower side and hence, Buttler would want to bat deep and take his side to a respectable total. Mumbai will need to keep chipping away with wickets as Rajasthan do have some power-hitters to follow as well. 12.6 overs (1 Run) Angling on the pads. Buttler flicks it off his pads and to square leg for a single. 12.5 overs (1 Run) Pitches it up, outside off, drilled down to long off for a single. 12.4 overs (1 Run) Full on off, pushed to sweeper cover for a single. 12.3 overs (1 Run) A slower short ball, on middle.

Mitchell misses his glance. 12.2 overs (0 Run) Length and outside off, punched to covers. 12.1 overs (1 Run) A low dipping full toss, on leg, Jos turns it on the leg side for a single. Daniel Sams (2-0-15-0) comes back to bowl. 11.6 overs (1 Run) Flatter ball, outside off, Buttler fetches it to long on for one more. Another superb over from the debutant. 11.5 overs (0 Run) A loopy ball, on middle. Buttler defends it back to the bowler. 11.4 overs (0 Run) Flighted, full and around off. Buttler smashes it hard but straight to the extra-cover fielder. The umpires are just checking for a no ball but Kumar Kartikeya has his foot behind the line. 11.3 overs (1 Run) Slightly short and spinning around off. Mitchell tucks it to deep mid-wicket for a single. 11.2 overs (1 Run) Bit of width given, outside off. Buttler drives it to sweeper cover for a single. 11.1 overs (0 Run) Tossed up, on middle. Buttler drops it to covers. 10.6 overs (1 Run) Outside off. Buttler opens the face of the bat and guides it to backward point for a run. 10.5 overs (0 Run) A length ball, outside off, stays a bit low. Buttler looks to cut but gets a bottom edge to the keeper on a bounce. 10.5 overs (1 Run) Wide! Buttler again tries to scoop this one but the line is down the leg side and he misses it. A wide given. 10.4 overs (0 Run) On a length and outside off. A pre-meditated scoop from Buttler as he shuffles across but fails to connect any bat on it. 10.3 overs (0 Run) Short in length and slanting around middle. Buttler looks to pull again but this time gets hit on the left thigh. 10.2 overs (2 Runs) Short of a length and on middle. Buttler pulls it to deep square leg for an easy couple. 10.1 overs (1 Run) A length ball on off, it is hit to mid-wicket for a single.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637869484676787672.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 making the right 'pitch' for thrilling contests","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-making-the-right-pitch-for-thrilling-contests-589952","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"The curators have left a considerable amount of grass on pitches of all four stadiums to prevent them from cracking early and watering it well to maintain perfect playing conditions.","content":"New Delhi: In the era of continuous cricket, nobody wants to witness regular high-scoring or low-scoring matches.

With Sharma not being asked about the rationale behind these changes, they appear to be made to provide opportunities to other players in what has been a flop campaign for the most successful IPL franchise.

Padikkal leans back to upper cut but misses. Mumbai will be really disappointed with the fielding already. 2.5 overs (0 Run) Fuller and on off, pushed to mid off. 2.4 overs (4 Runs) DROPPED AND FOUR! Tim David puts down a dolly! Short of a length, outside off. Padikkal this time tries to ramp it away but the ball goes off the upper half of the bat and to deep backward point where Tim David has enough time to settle down but makes a meal of it. Just where Daniel Sams made a mistake. A boundary. 2.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! This time uses his feet! On a length and around off.

Buttler has a poke at it but misses. 1.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! CHANCE! Short of a length and targeting Buttler's head. He looks to pull but gets a top edge to deep square leg. Sams there, misjudges the flight of the ball as he runs forward and then realizes he has made a blunder. He leaps and runs back but to no avail. The ball lands right in-between the ropes and the ground. The third umpire has a view and calls it a boundary. Boundary-check! The umpires have sent the decision upstairs and they are checking whether the ball landed directly on the boundary cushion. It seems that the ball landed just in front of the boundary cushion and the umpire signals a boundary. 1.3 overs (0 Run) Fuller ball around off. Buttler drives it crisply but straight to the cover fielder. 1.2 overs (0 Run) A length ball on off. Buttler hops and taps it to cover. 1.1 overs (0 Run) A widish yorker to start for Bumrah and there is late swing as well. Buttler wildly swings at it but misses. Who will bowl from the other end?

Padikkal square drives it straight to the fielder in the deep for a single. 0.1 over (1 Run) Sams start with a fuller delivery, shaping on the pads. Buttler flicks it to deep square leg for a single. We are set for the game to begin! The match officials have made their way out to the middle. They are followed by the players of Mumbai and Rajasthan's opening batters, Jos Buttler and Devdutt Padikkal. Daniel Sams will start with the ball. Let's go... The players of both sides have lined up and they are giving a round of applause in the memory of the former Rajasthan skipper, Shane Warne. \">Rajasthan players will be wearing a special jersey 'SW23' for this game against Mumbai, as a tribute to their former player and coach, Shane Warne. Sanju Samson, the skipper of Rajasthan, says that they are happy to set a target. Adds that they have been playing some brilliant cricket and they will look to continue doing that. Informs that they are unchanged heading into this game. Rohit Sharma, the skipper of Mumbai, says they will bowl first, as the nature of the pitch suits their game as well. Informs there are two changes. Adds that the preparation happens before the tournament, it's just ticking the boxes and the focus is to win the game while enjoying it. Feels they should stick together as a team. Rajasthan (Unchanged Playing XI) - Jos Buttler, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (C/WK), Daryl Mitchell, Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Sen.

TOSS - Mumbai have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first. Rajasthan are flying high this season with a wonderful squad and some match-winning players in them. They are on a three-game winning streak and also had the upper hand when these two sides met earlier this season. Will they do the double or will Mumbai find a breakthrough? We will find out soon. Stay tuned for further updates. The last time Mumbai played it was Sachin Tendulkar's birthday but the result was again unconventional. Today it's the Hitman, Rohit Sharma's birthday and although the season already looks gloomy, Mumbai will hope that the skipper would give a return gift to his team by registering their first win of the season. Super Saturday means a double dose of entertainment and the second match is between two teams who are travelling in unparalleled ways, it is Rajasthan vs Mumbai. One team is at the top half of the points table, while the other is hanging down with a sullen look. On that note, a very warm welcome to our coverage. Who are you cheering for tonight? ...

Shahbaz gets rid of Gill. The spinner bowls this one touch back of the length around middle and leg and Gill goes on the backfoot to try and negotiate that towards the on side but couldn't connect. The bowler and wicket-keeper appeal and the on-field umpire raises his finger. The batter takes the review but it's three reds and he has to walk back. 18:16 (IST)SIX! FREE HIT and Shahbaz bowls a full toss around middle and leg and Gill smashes that for a maximum to deep mid-wicket.  18:12 (IST)FOUR!

He has kept the batters silent. But the Titans have had a decent start. 18:00 (IST)After 6 overs,Gujarat Titans 46/0 ( Wriddhiman Saha (W) 27 , Shubman Gill 17)Another good over for the Titans as Siraj leaks away some runs in that one. 17:59 (IST)FOUR! Another back of the length ball from Siraj and Saha picks that one so well and places that through the on side for another boundary in the over. 17:57 (IST)FOUR! A good shot from Saha. Siraj bowls that back of the length, outside off and the right-hander goes over covers for a boundary. 17:54 (IST)After 5 overs,Gujarat Titans 34/0 ( Wriddhiman Saha (W) 18 , Shubman Gill 16)Brilliant over from Hazlewood. He has kept it really tight. 17:49 (IST)After 4 overs,Gujarat Titans 30/0 ( Wriddhiman Saha (W) 16 , Shubman Gill 14)The Titans had got a boundary on the very first ball but Shahbaz has made a good comeback in that over. 17:47 (IST)FOUR! Another change in the bowling. Shahbaz bowls this full and Saha drives that through the covers for a boundary. 17:46 (IST)After 3 overs,Gujarat Titans 23/0 ( Wriddhiman Saha (W) 10 , Shubman Gill 13)A good first over from Hazlewood as he keeps things tight. 17:41 (IST)After 2 overs,Gujarat Titans 18/0 ( Wriddhiman Saha (W) 6 , Shubman Gill 12)The Titans are off to a fine start. Both the batters are not letting go any opportunity of scoring runs. 17:40 (IST)FOUR! Easy picking for the batter at the moment. Siraj bowls that length ball on to his pads and Gill places that nicely towards the backward square leg region for a boundary. 17:36 (IST)After 1 overs,Gujarat Titans 10/0 ( Wriddhiman Saha (W) 5 , Shubman Gill 5)Good and aggressive start to the proceedings for Gujarat Titans.  17:36 (IST)FOUR! Second one of the over. Length ball from Maxwell around the middle and off stump line and Gill slogs that one away for a boundary towards the on square leg boundary. 17:34 (IST)FOUR! Short and wide and Saha just cuts that away through the off-side for boundary. A good way to start the over. 17:33 (IST)Maxwell has the ball to start the proceedings while Gill and Saha open the innings for Titans. 17:32 (IST)Dinesh Karthik is not taking the field and Anuj Rawat will be keeping the wickets. 17:23 (IST)Some fine batting from Lomror who has scored some crucial runs in the final over. RCB would feel that they have a genuine chance of defending this one. Good news for Kohli fans too as the former skipper notched up his first fifty of the season. Not to forget, Rajat Patidar who chipped in with an exceptional knock. His aggressive striking certainly gave Kohli a bit of room to get his eye in before going for his strokes. A good effort from the RCB batting considering the way they had performed in the past two matches. Now, it's all up to the bowlers. 17:20 (IST)WICKET! A wicket to wrap the innings as Lomror once again plays that outside off stump, length ball in the air but couldn't really time it well and this time Miller takes the catch. Lomror is OUT for 16 off 8 as RCB put 170/6 in 20 overs on the scoresheet. 17:18 (IST)FOUR! This time he shuffles across the stumps and scoops that length ball, outside off over short fine leg for four. 17:18 (IST)A bit of a confusion there in the middle. Lomror once again takes the aerial route on the delivery bowled outside off and Miller takes a catch in the deep. However, the batter feels that the ball has hit the cable and the on-field umpires go upstairs. The replays show that Lomror was pretty right in his judgement. it's a DEAD BALL.17:13 (IST)SIX! What a shot from Lomror. Length ball from Joseph and the batter just throws the kitch sink on it and hammers it over long on for a MAXIMUM. RCB need some more of those. 17:09 (IST)After 19 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 155/5 ( Shahbaz Ahmed 1 , Mahipal Lomror 4)RCB lose an important wicket in that over as Maxwell gets dismissed for 33 off 18. 17:09 (IST)FOUR! Another full toss from Ferguson who bowls that outside off and Lomror drives that through the covers. 17:07 (IST)WICKET! RCB lose another one as Rashid Khan takes a blinder. Ferguson bowls a full toss dipping down on the batter and Maxwell tries to go over mid-off but couldn't really connect his stroke as the ball goes in the air. Rashid takes a fine catch.17:06 (IST)FOUR! Ferguson bowls that one fuller in length and way outside off and Maxwell places that nicely towards the third man region. 17:04 (IST)After 18 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 144/4 ( Glenn Maxwell 27 , Shahbaz Ahmed 1)RCB lose Karthik in that one but Maxwell continue with his stroke play. 17:02 (IST)FOUR! Maxwell is unstoppable at the moment. Plays that switch-hit with perfection and hammers that back of the length ball for a four. 17:01 (IST)WICKET! Another one bites the dust as Rashid strikes and removes Dinesh Karthik. The batter goes across the line a bit on that length ball around the middle stump but msicues his stroke and that's gone straight up in the air. Shami who is stationed at short fine leg takes a sitter. 16:57 (IST)After 17 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 136/3 ( Glenn Maxwell 21 , Dinesh Karthik (W) 1)SIX! A maximum to finish that one. Maxwell pulls that short one from Shami and the right-handed batter has started to accelerate now. 16:55 (IST)WICKET! Kohli DEPARTS. Shami bowls a perfect yorker on the off stump line and Kohli who tries to give himself some room completely misses it. The ball hits the off stump and the batter has to walk back for 58. 16:53 (IST)SIX! Maxwell finally connects one. Shami bowls that in the slot and the batter smashes that away for maximum over deep mid-wicket.  Gujarat Titans vs Royal Challengers Bangalore live score streaming, IPL 2022: Gujarat Titans have started to accelerate.PREVIEW: Royal Challengers Bangalore will be looking to shrug off their recent defeats when they lock horns with Gujarat Titans for the first time in this season of the Indian Premier League.Coming into this match, Gujarat Titans are at the top of the points table with seven wins and one loss while the Royal Challengers Bangalore are fifth with five wins and four losses.Wriddhiman Saha was superb for the Gujarat Titans in the last match and now they would want the likes of Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya to make vital contributions.On the other hand, the Royal Challengers Bangalore have not had the expected results from their top order.

He showed the spirit of cricket by walking off the field at MCA Stadium in Pune in the last game.The incident happened in the fourth ball of the 13th over when the South African batter tried to hit Sandeep Sharma's delivery but managed only a faint edge. De Kock tried to cut the ball away off the back foot behind point but it went straight to Jitesh Sharma’s gloves, due to the nick from his bat.Looking at this, bowler Sandeep Sharma shouted for the wicket but, the on-field umpire did not agree or give an out. Without much hesitation, de Kock walked back to the dugout and did not bother about the umpire’s decision.Sharma appreciated de Kock’s true gesture and was seen giving a pat on his back for his good sportsman spirit.Watch the video here: In the match, de Kock was looking as a strong contender top-scored for LSG with 46 off 37 balls. The southpaw somehow stabilised the Giants' innings after they lost captain KL Rahul’s wicket early. De Kock also shared an 85-run partnership alongside batter Deepak Hooda. They both helped LSG put up a decent total against Punjab’s quality pace attack. After fans spotted De Kock’s sportsmanship, they were highly impressed and hailed him for his act. Here are some reactions: LSG now holds the third spot on the points table. So far in the tournament, they have won six out of nine matches. They will lock horns with Delhi Capitals in their next match on Sunday. ","pubDate":"2022-04-30 11:34:45","image_url":"https://images.firstpost.com/fpimages/380x285/fixed/jpg/2022/04/VRP00173-1.jpg","source_id":"firstpost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 GT vs RCB Live Score Updates: Shami cleans up Kohli, Bangalore 3 down - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLWd0LXZzLXJjYi1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtNzg5NDYyNi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 GT vs RCB Live Score Updates: Shami cleans up Kohli, Bangalore 3 down  The Indian ExpressGT vs RCB Preview, Game Day | IPL 2022  Royal Challengers BangaloreGujarat Titans vs Royal Challengers Bangalore Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022  Cricket AddictorGT vs RCB Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for IPL 2022, Match 43  SportskeedaIPL 2022, GT vs RCB Live Score: Virat Kohli Falls After Fifty As RCB Eye Strong Finish  NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-30 11:26:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gujarat Titans vs Royal Challengers Bangalore Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/gujarat-titans-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-live-score-over-match-43-t20-16-20-updates-2934622","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Gujarat Titans vs Royal Challengers Bangalore from Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai.

Ends by saying that the team should be able to chase it down. Gujarat have some big names in their bowling lineup but it was Pradeep Sangwan who got the big wicket of Faf du Plessis in his first over early in the game. Wickets did not come in the middle phase but Gujarat bowlers never let the game drift away from them. Sangwan came back to break the second wicket partnership and after that wickets kept falling at regular intervals. The death bowling was spot on from Gujarat bowlers apart from the last over from Alzarri Joseph who was expensive today. Overall, Gujarat have done pretty well here. Sangwan was the pick of the bowlers for them as he gave away just 19 runs and took two wickets in his four overs. Bangalore came into this game on the back of two consecutive lacklustre batting performances and needed a good start to their innings. However, their skipper, Faf du Plessis went early without troubling the scorers and Bangalore needed someone to step up. Rajat Patidar joined Kohli and both started building a partnership. The youngman Rajat was the aggressor while Kohli also went about his business at a decent rate. However, the 99 runs partnership was broken in the 15th over as Rajat departed after his fifty and soon Kohli too followed him after getting to his first fifty of the season. Maxwell played a handy cameo in the end but Bangalore failed to get the kick on they needed in the death overs on this high-scoring ground. Fine finish by young Mahipal Lomror in the last over of the innings. It has taken Bangalore to 170 but is this enough? It's an afternoon game and Bangalore have a fighting score on the board. Brabourne is a high-scoring ground and Gujarat bowlers will be pretty pleased with their efforts. Coming into the last 6 overs, Bangalore had 9 wickets in hand and they would have hoped for a better finish in the death overs. Bangalore though have a good bowling lineup themselves and runs on the board can always be crucial and let's see how things pan out. 19.6 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! No cables involved this time and Alzarri Joseph has something to rejoice about. This is in the slot again, around off. Mahipal Lomror looks to launch it over the long on fence but only gets the height and not the distance. David Miller settles under it at the long on fence and takes a good catch. Bangalore end with 170/6! 19.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Cheeky from Lomror and this is a very handy knock from him. Length ball, around off. Lomror shuffles across and gets it over the man at short fine leg for a boundary. 19.4 overs (2 Runs) SAFE! Full and straight, Mahipal Lomror whips it firmly towards the cow corner fence. Lockie Ferguson races to his left from long on and cuts it off. The batters push hard for two and they seem to have made it. The umpires do go upstairs but the replay shows that Shahbaz Ahmed is well in. Mahipal Lomror has been caught here but the umpires are checking whether the ball has hit the cable on the way or not? Yes, it has. So Mahipal Lomror survives and it will be a dead ball! The umpires check for the second time because it is not the cable of the spidercam but some other satellite cable. The decision though remains the same. 19.4 overs (1 Run) WIDE! This is spilled way beyond the tramline and Lomror is unable to reach it. Wide called. 19.3 overs (6 Runs) SIX! In the slot and dispatched! On off, Mahipal Lomror is deep in his crease and smokes it high and handsome over the long on fence for a welcome biggie. 19.2 overs (1 Run) A loopy full toss from Joseph, this is angled well wide of the off stump. Ahmed has to reach out and can only pick up a single towards deep point. 19.1 overs (1 Run) Around the hips, Mahipal Lomror tucks it away towards square leg for a run. Alzarri Joseph will bowl the last over. 18.6 overs (1 Run) Leg bye! Ferguson angles this one into the left=hander from 'round the wicket. Lomror makes a bit of room but gets cramped and the ball comes off his pads. The ball goes behind the stumps and a leg bye is stolen. 18.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Another full toss from Ferguson and this time he does get punished. Around off and this is slapped away to the right of the man at extra cover for a boundary. 18.4 overs (0 Run) A yorker this time, on off. Lomror digs it out. Mahipal Lomror is the next man in. 18.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! TAKEN! Rashid Khan with a stunner to dismiss Glenn Maxwell! Lockie Ferguson serves a low full toss on middle stump and Maxwell clears his front leg looking to go big leg side. The bat turns in his hands a bit and Maxwell ends up lofting it towards the extra cover region. Rashid backtracks and dives to his left to take a brilliant catch over his head. Maxwell has to go and this could make a sizeable difference in the final total. 18.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Nicely done! Full and wide this time, Glenn Maxwell squeezes it behind square on the off side and the ball runs away to the backward point fence. 18.1 overs (2 Runs) Ferguson starts off with a slower delivery, floated wide of off stump. Maxwell drills it to the right of mid off and the fielder over there fumbles a bit as he puts in the dive. The batters race back for the second. Lockie Ferguson is back on. Three overs for 26 runs so far. 17.6 overs (1 Run) On middle, Maxwell pushes it down to long on for a single and will keep strike for the next over. 17.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Glenn Maxwell with a signature switch hit. Flatter and on off, Maxwell gets in position early and hits it flat, the ball goes one bounce into the cover fence. 17.4 overs (1 Run) Full and wide, Shahbaz Ahmed drives it to sweeper cover for a single. Shahbaz Ahmed is the next batter in. 17.3 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! The plan to hold back Rashid Khan has worked wonders for Gujarat and the dangerman Dinesh Karthik departs early. This is on a shorter length and on middle stump. It is the googly and Karthik looks to pull it aerially off the back foot. The ball goes off the top edge and Mohammad Shami takes a dolly of a catch at short fine leg. 17.2 overs (1 Run) Rashid floats it up a bit on middle stump. Maxwell makes room and hits it down to long off for a run. 17.1 overs (1 Run) Down the leg side, Karthik paddles it towards short fine leg for a quick single. 16.6 overs (6 Runs) SIX! Glenn Maxwell gets hold of another one and this has ended up being a productive over for Bangalore. Banged in halfway and Maxwell has muscled the pull shot all the way over the square leg fence for a biggie. 15 off it. 16.5 overs (1 Run) On a good length, around off. Karthik eases it off the back foot through covers and gets off the mark with a single. Dinesh Karthik is the next man in. 16.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! Cleaned up! Just when Virat Kohli needed to up the ante, Mohammad Shami has undone him with a good yorker. Kohli premeditates and moves way past the leg stump. Shami goes full and on off stump. Kohli fails to reach the ball and it goes on to hit the base of off stump. Kohli has to depart after a well-compiled innings and this is yet another timely wicket for Gujarat. 16.3 overs (1 Run) Length again, around off and at 141.3 kph. Maxwell slogs it towards deep mid-wicket for a run. 16.2 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BOOM! Fullish delivery, in the slot around middle. Glenn Maxwell is deep in his crease waiting for it and whacks it well over the mid-wicket fence for a huge hit. 16.1 overs (1 Run) Just short of a length, around off and this is hit down the ground for just a single. The batters thought about the second but decide against it. Mohammad Shami (3-0-24-0) is back on. 15.6 overs (0 Run) Top over from Joseph, just 4 runs off it. Length ball, around off and Glenn Maxwell attempts the reverse hit but makes no connection. Bangalore need boundaries and they need a lot of them. 15.5 overs (1 Run) Short ball, a bit slower and on off stump. Kohli uses his wrists to pull it behind square on the leg side for one. 15.4 overs (1 Run) Leg bye! This is good bowling from Joseph. Maxwell looks to make a bit of room leg side but Joseph follows him. The ball hits Maxwell on the body and rolls onto the off side. They scamper through for a leg bye. 15.3 overs (1 Run) Pacy delivery, around the top of off and Kohli whips it towards deep mid-wicket for a run. 15.2 overs (1 Run) Back of a length, outside off. This is played towards third man for just a single. 15.1 overs (0 Run) Good start from Joseph, a short ball banged in on middle and leg. Maxwell moves past the leg stump and lets it go.","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637869345372997301.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: 'Stupid cricket with the bat,' KL Rahul reacts to LSG's win over PBKS","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-stupid-cricket-with-the-bat-kl-rahul-reacts-to-lsgs-win-over-pbks-740465","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"LSG defeated PBKS by 20 runs in IPL 2022Krunal Pandya was MoM for 2 for 11LSG next take on DC on Sunday","content":"‘Stupid cricket with the bat,’ KL Rahul reacts to LSG’s win over PBKS‘Stupid cricket with the bat,’ KL Rahul reacts to LSG’s win over PBKSLucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper KL Rahul on Friday revealed that he was left \"fuming\" after his side played \"stupid cricket with the bat\" against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022.LSG managed just 153 runs on the board in 20 overs.

Over the last couple of years, Sharma has grown into his role for Team India, becoming the captain in all three formats. However, his Indian Premier League (IPL) team MI is not doing well in the 2022 edition as it is placed last in the 10-team league. On Sharma's special day, wishes poured him from all quarters. The cheekiest of the lot however came from Sharma's long-time India teammate Yuzvendra Chahal , who is playing for Rajasthan Royals, in the IPL 2022. In response to Chahal's birthday wish to Sharma on Instagram, which included a series of photographs of the two cricketer, the India captain's wife Ritika Sajdeh came up with some equally brilliant response that won the internet. A post shared by Yuzvendra Chahal (@yuzi_chahal23) \"The love & respect for my Rohitaa Shramaa will always be constant on & off field Found my bade bhaiya Wishing you lifetime of happiness, amazing games & good health Happy birthday Hitman,\" Chahal wrote on Instagram. \"The last picture got me your photos are more romantic than mine,\" Sajdeh replied to the post. And then Chahal came up with this. \"I'm sure bhabhi my wife also has the same thing to say,\" he wrote. Chahal and Sharma off the field camaraderie is well known. The two have often been known to indulge in jokes, but Sajdeh on Saturday took it to the next level. Promoted Rohit Sharma was appointed India's white-ball skipper last year and then took over reins in the longest format this year after Virat Kohli stepped down as the Test skipper. The 35-year-old holds the record for registering highest individual score in ODIs after playing a knock of 264 against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Rohit's first double ton in ODIs came against Australia in 2013. He then later scored two more against Sri Lanka. Rohit is also the first batter to hit five centuries in a single World Cup, achieving the feat in 2019 where India made it to the semi-finals.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-04/ng28ugco_chahal-rohit-instaram_120x90_30_April_22.jpg","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
