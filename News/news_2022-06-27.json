During the first T20I of the ongoing India‚Äôs tour of Ireland at The Village Cricket Ground, Malahide in Dublin, India comprehensively defeated Ireland by 7 wickets, in what was a rain curtailed 12 Overs-a side encounter. En route the target of 109 in 12 Overs, the Southpow batter Ishan Kishan (26 off 11), who took the field alongside his new opening batting pair of Deepak Hooda (47* off 29) went hammer and tongs right from the get-go to post 30 runs for the first wicket off mere 2.4 Overs. With even Suryakumar Yadav (0 off 1) following him on the very next delivery towards the hut, there was no stopping the Indian batting order today, all of who had made up their minds to go for the kill right away. Hooda, was joined by skipper Hardik Pandya (24 off 12), both of who took the game away from Ireland‚Äôs hands, to reach the target with 15 deliveries to spare. Earlier, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, continuing with his good form from the recently concluded South Africa series, picked up a wicket-maiden off the very first Over of his day, to get his name registered in the list of highest wicket-takers in the Powerplay in T20I history. However, it was Yuzvendra Chahal, with his magnificent bowling figures of 3-0-11-1, who was the pick of the Indian bowlers, and fittingly received the ‚ÄòPlayer of the match‚Äô award.

And it absolutely typified the surge of self-belief and aggression sweeping through this new-look England team. Root played exactly the same shot with the same result ‚Äì six runs ‚Äì off Tim Southee during his century in the previous Test at Trent Bridge. By the close of day four of the Third Test at Headingley, England were making light work of chasing 296 for victory in their second innings. They have rattled along at more than four-an-over, reached 183-2 and are poised for a 3-0 series whitewash. Remember, they were 55-6 on day two and in desperate trouble. Root finished 55 not out and Ollie Pope built on his century in the Second Test with 81 not out. They have put on 132 for the third wicket and England need only a further 113 runs. Admission is free on Monday and another full house is expected. England‚Äôs latest exhibition of dazzling batting came after Jack Leach completed a ten-wicket match haul for the first time in Test cricket. SUN BINGO GET ¬£50 BONUS & 50 FREE SPINS TODAY Like Root and most of the other players, Leach appears liberated under the new regime and the confidence being shown in him by captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Leach took the final three wickets in New Zealand‚Äôs second innings and England, after hunting down 278 and 299 in the first two Tests, were not remotely daunted by the target. In fact, they appeared to regard it as a breeze. There was an early wobble, but that wasn‚Äôt going to halt the torrent of runs. Zak Crawley was dropped on nought in Trent Boult‚Äôs first over when Southee at second slip got a finger to an edge but could not hold on. Crawley was then mainly to blame for the run out of opening partner Alex Lees. Crawley thought his cover drive had penetrated the inner ring of fielders but Kane Williamson produced a diving stop and threw the ball on the bounce to the bowler‚Äôs end. Boult had the anticipation and athleticism to dash to the stumps, gather the ball and remove the bails with Lees stranded. Crawley did manage four boundaries in one Boult over but generally looked sketchy and it was little surprise when he mis-hit a drive against spinner Michael Bracewell to mid-off. Crawley‚Äôs poor form is one of the few areas of concern for Stokes and McCullum. But he is likely to keep his place for the Test against India at Edgbaston on Friday. New Zealand reviewed lbw decisions against Root from successive balls by Southee. But both had the look of desperation and the impact with Root‚Äôs pad was outside off stump. Pope found his stride and Root was in little difficulty. They were driving, guiding, pulling and reversing, the full box of tricks. And the Blackcaps suffered from novice spinner Bracewell struggling to find any sort of consistency and being plundered at more than six an over. Earlier, England had their third wicketkeeper of the match when Ben Foakes, already missing on Saturday because of a stiff back, tested positive for Covid. Sam Billings, who should have been playing for Kent against Surrey, was summoned from his home in London, arrived in Leeds at 2am and became England‚Äôs first Covid sub. He took over the gloves from Jonny Bairstow and will bat No.7 if needed. The prolific duo of Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell ‚Äì a hell of a pair of players ‚Äì completed their fourth century stand of the series and England looked like they might be chasing way beyond 300. Mitchell was eventually lbw to the impressive Matthew Potts and finished the series with 538 runs at an average of 107.6. They are remarkable numbers for a man who played in the First Test only because of injuries to others. But the Kiwis lost their last five wickets for 52 runs. Bracewell hit Leach for one six but, attempting a repeat two balls later, holed out to deep mid-wicket. Leach cleaned up New Zealand‚Äôs tail and completed his second five-for of the match. Potts took three wickets and bowled superbly, as did Stuart Broad , who didn‚Äôt take a wicket but had a couple of catches dropped and beat the bat countless times.","pubDate":"2022-06-26 19:44:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"EN-W vs SA-W Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for One-off Test Match","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/england-women-vs-south-africa-women-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-one-off-test?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Sahil Jain"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"England Women will lock horns against South Africa Women in a one-off Test match at The Cooper Associates County Ground, Taunton on Monday, June 27.

Meanwhile, this will be South Africa Women‚Äôs first Test match since November 2014, and as such, they'll be eager to make a mark.

However, the pacers are expected to get some movement with the new ball and the spinners could also get some joy out of the pitch as the game progresses. Wicketkeeper Amy Ellen Jones has batted four times in Test cricket, mustering 82 runs, including one half century. She also has an impressive 11 catches to her name. Batters Laura Wolvaardt is one of the premier batters for South Africa Women and has been consistent in the shorter formats. All-rounders Marizanne Kapp can have a huge impact with both bat and ball. The seam-bowling all-rounder could be the player to watch out for. Nat Sciver might be a key player for England.

The ownership structure of clubs remains a significant issue in the BBL, with both Cricket NSW and Queensland vocal in backing the private ownership move this week. All eight clubs are currently owned by CA and run by state bodies, despite the debate of privatisation lingering for a decade amid interest from the sub-continent. Indian Premier League clubs have already invested in leagues in the Caribbean, South Africa and UAE, with the Emirates' competition clashing with the BBL and offering more lucrative returns. The argument is that a similar model would allow the Big Bash to enhance its financial pulling power to players, in a bid to better attract star overseas talent. Khawaja, an Australian Cricketers' Association director, has backed the move. \"I personally think the BBL, if it wants to grow and be fair dinkum about it, we do need to think about privatising it,\" said Khawaja, speaking in Australia's Test camp in Sri Lanka. \"The BBL has been set up as a really good tournament for a long time but I genuinely think that's the next evolution. \"And I've had chats with Nick Hockley about this - I literally chatted to him about it two weeks ago - and I think he's on a very similar page. \"At some stage CA's got to let go of the reins a little bit. \"If that means doing it over a five-year plan, the ball's got to start rolling sooner rather than later. \"Because ... If we're not careful we're going to be left behind, and you don't want to do that because the BBL is a great product.\" CA has long toyed with the idea of privatisation, with the greatest fear being grassroots cricket feeling the pain and clubs being less willing to blood youngsters. Khawaja's comments came just days after CA introduced an overseas player draft for next year, with top-tier international talent to be paid around $340,000 while not required to stay for the whole tournament. The Test veteran is, however, concerned that the league's salary cap means local players will be paid less, despite being available for the whole tournament. \"You've got lots of great local players who also should be on similar amounts to what the overseas players are, but they can't be because of the salary cap,\" Khawaja said. \"The only way you're going to increase the salary cap is to privatise it. \"Privatisation also brings in a lot of great things from outside, because once there's money at stake for owners, they'll try to do their best to give everything for that franchise. \"Right now it's sort of going and progressing, but I don't think it's innovating as much as it should be as far as the franchises themselves.\"","pubDate":"2022-06-26

On the final day, Mumbai could only manage 269 in their second innings, leaving MP with a paltry target of 108, and they did it in style as Pandit won a record sixth national title as a coach. Sarfaraz Khan (45), who finished the season with 18 short of 1000 runs and young Suved Parkar (51) tried their bit, but with the need to attack at every opportunity, MP‚Äôs Kumar Kartikeya (4/98) and the other bowlers knew that wickets would come their way. While chasing, there were some hiccups, but with just over 100 to get, it was a stroll in the park for the MP team. As they completed the victory, Pandit was flooded with memories (not happy ones), which he hasn‚Äôt been able to erase for over two decades and despite winning five trophies as a coach. It was here at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in the summer of 1999 when MP, despite a first-innings lead of 75, failed to win the game as Pandit, a proud captain, finished his playing career in tears. Before the final, he spoke to PTI about divine intervention and circle of life and during the five days, sat in one corner with a white towel on his lap. He has again proved to be an ‚ÄòAlchemist‚Äô, after guiding Vidarbha to four trophies (successive Ranji and Irani Cup), with a team that didn‚Äôt have superstars. The Yash Dubeys, Himanshu Mantris, Subham Sharmas, Gourav Yadavs or Saransh Jains aren‚Äôt players who would give you the feeling that they are India prospects, the classy Rajat Patidar being an exception. But they gave enough indication that they aren‚Äôt ready to concede even a micro millimetre without a good scrap. They gave the Mumbai men a lesson in perfect execution of tactic with dollops of ‚ÄòKhadoos‚Äô cricket, which many thought was a patent of the 41-time champions. MP‚Äôs win once again proved that the Ranji Trophy is often won by sides which don‚Äôt have too many superstars or India prospects with ambition or wherewithal to play top-flight cricket. It happened with Rajasthan when they had Hrishikesh Kanitkar, Akash Chopra during their triumph while Vidarbha had Wasim Jaffer and Ganesh Sathish guiding a bunch of youngsters. In MP, there was no Avesh Khan or Venkatesh Iyer and had only an emerging potential star in Patidar, yet they followed Pandit‚Äôs ‚ÄòGurukul‚Äô style of ‚ÄòMy Way or HighWay‚Äô coaching philosophy to emerge triumphant. Since 2010, the Ranji Trophy, barring Karnataka‚Äôs dominance for a few seasons and Mumbai winning it once, it has been won by teams like Rajasthan (twice), Vidarbha (twice), Saurashtra (once) and Madhya Pradesh, who would never be in contention in the past. This shows that cricket has moved from the Shivaji Park, Azad Maidan or Cross Maidan in Mumbai, from the National Stadium in Delhi or the state-of-the-art camps in Bengaluru or Kolkata, to the hinterlands. Bhopal‚Äôs Yash Dubey, who had problems with his eye-sight during teenage years or Sultanpur‚Äôs Kumar Kartikeya, who hadn‚Äôt gone back home for nine years or Hoshangabad‚Äôs Gourav Yadav, who would beat Prithvi Shaw‚Äôs bat many times just for fun are men, who haven‚Äôt had it easy. When the Ranji Trophy started, the Madhya Pradesh cricket team wasn‚Äôt even formed and it was back then known as Holkar, a princely state from the British era, which produced the country‚Äôs finest cricketers ‚Äì the charismatic Mushtaq Ali ‚Äî or the first ever captain of the Indian cricket team ‚Äî the great CK Nayudu. Holkar was a formidable team till the 1950s before it was rechristened as Madhya Bharat and subsequently Madhya Pradesh. MP, over the years, have produced some fine cricketers ‚Äì spinners Narendra Hirwani and Rajesh Chauhan ‚Äî who had brief but eventful international careers. Amay Khurasiya, who had finished his cricket some years before the IPL, where he would have been a rocking success. And then there was the peerless Devendra Bundela, who was one of those unlucky middle-order batters, who played in the 1990s and 2000s when Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman were in their pomp. But as a Ranji team, it never looked menacing save the occasional final they played 23 summers back under Pandit‚Äôs captaincy. However, this was a team that had enough self-belief and was ready to punch above its weight. They did it with aplomb through five days. The Ranji Trophy deserves to be in the MPCA cabinet for the next one year. ‚ÄîPTI ¬† ¬† Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-06-26 18:50:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Always felt I left something back here 23 years ago: Pandit","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/06/27/always-felt-i-left-something-back-here-23-years-ago-pandit/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bengaluru: Carrying the weight of a defeat that hurt more than most for over two decades, one couldn‚Äôt fault Chandrakant Pandit for those moistened eyes as he folded his hands as a mark of respect towards the Mumbai dressing room.

After Rajat Patidar ran the most important single in the history of Madhya Pradesh cricket, it completed a cycle for head coach Pandit, 23 years after his failure to win the state side‚Äôs maiden Ranji Trophy title as a player. ‚ÄúEvery trophy gives satisfaction but this one is special.

When you think of Joe Root, you think of class, panache, and the ability to leave balls. But, Joe Root played a shot that stunned everyone at the stadium, home and even the bowler himself. Yes, you read that right. In the ongoing Test between England and New Zealand, Root got down on one knee, and reverse swept Neil Wagner, a fast bowler, over third man for a six. As far as the match is concerned, England need 113 runs on the final day of the test to win the game. Chasing 296, England lost both their openers early, and it looked like New Zealand were in the game. But, then Joe Root and Pope came together, stitched an unbeaten 132-run partnership, and played with a mix of caution and aggression to get England to 183/2 at the end of day 4. Surprisingly, New Zealand weren't disciplined with the ball in hand and kept giving away too many runs. They missed Ajaz Patel, as the pitch definitely had something in it for the spinners. Although England just need 113 runs, things can change pretty quickly in a test match, so don't count NZ out just yet. But yes, England still have the likes of Bairstow and Stokes and will start as favourites.

After a turbulent few years, the new regime of McCullum and Stokes has been one that has preached positive and attacking cricket, once again coming to fruition on day four at Headingley with Jack Leach (5-66) taking his second five-wicket haul before Ollie Pope (81no) took control with the bat in the evening session. While originally maintaining scepticism about the new brand of English Test cricket, Hussain conceded that he had been wrong about England fans being solely focused on getting a winning result. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I was the first to pull Keysy (Rob Key) up on it when he said we are going to play in a different style and a different brand and I said these fans just want a winning brand and a winning style and I got it wrong,\" said Hussain. \"These fans want to see this style of cricket and winning is a bonus if they go 3-0 up and win all three like this. \"But what we are seeing from these fans, they are loving what they are seeing out in the middle. \"The brand and style of cricket is important.\" Coming into the series, Pope was under pressure taking up the number three spot in the batting order but has proven his worth and heads into the morning session on day five with his third Test hundred in his sights. For Sky Sports' Simon Doull, new Test coach McCullum's attitude will have been a vital component in giving the Surrey batsman the confidence to attack on the international stage in the same way he does at county level. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I just think he has a bit more confidence,\" added Doull. \"We talk about that 100 at Nottingham, he exudes confidence at the county level, he struts like a few other Surrey players who have gone before him. \"He struts at the county level and he bullies and bosses it but he hasn't quite found that on the international level. \"It is not about ability, it is all around attitude and belief and knowing that he is not going to be dropped if he has a couple of failures. \"I just know that Brendon McCullum will be saying those types of things to these types of players - don't worry about getting dropped next week, or next month or the month after that. \"That is not what this is about, if you can't enjoy what is happening right here, right now.\" The praise for England's new style of play came from within the dressing room too, spin bowler Leach revealing that it is Stokes' confidence in his players that is giving everyone the freedom to play in such an attacking way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"Great day for the boys,\" said Leach. \"The way we batted there was unbelievable and a great day. \"It was very special here at Headingley, I had good memories from 2019 and first game back here and I enjoyed it. \"I want to be contributing to wins so I am really enjoying working with Stokesy. \"So I say what about mid-on back and he says nope. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"It is really attacking and I am enjoying bowling like that as well. \"[Under Stokes] it's really attacking and I am really enjoying bowling attackingly. \"Stokesy's confidence in his decisions but also us as players - I have never experienced anything like it. It is very special to be a part of and that is credit to Stokesy and Baz (Test coach Brendon McCullum) for setting that up.\" Watch day five of the third LV= Insurance Test between England and New Zealand, at Headingley, live on Sky Sports Cricket with coverage starting at 10.15am and play getting underway at 11am, on Monday.","pubDate":"2022-06-26 18:35:00","image_url":"https://e2.365dm.com/22/06/1920x1080/skysports-pa-ollie-pope-england_5802470.jpg?20220615103603","source_id":"skysports","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland vs India Live Score Ball by Ball, Ireland vs India 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ireland-vs-india-live-score-over-1st-t20i-t20-6-10-updates-3103079","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Ireland vs India from Malahide Cricket Club Ground, Dublin.

There‚Äôs something about The Oval that, despite its size, it feels more intimate than the other Test grounds on a day of county cricket.

During the fourth day of the third Test of the ongoing New Zealand‚Äôs tour of England in Leeds, former England captain Joe Root was brave enough to reverse sweep New Zealand fast bowler Neil Wagner under surprising circumstances. It all happened on the last delivery of the 22nd over when Root got into position just at the right time to play a rare risk-involving shot to hit Wagner for a six over third man. Root, who became an instant source of amazement for playing such an innovative shot, soon exchanged smiles with the bowler who perhaps expressed surprise at being hit in such a manner by a quintessential Test match batter. It is noteworthy that this is not the first time Root has played such a shot in this series. It was during the fourth day of the second Test in Nottingham that Root had reverse-scooped Tim Southee for a six to astonish former captain Sir Alastair Cook. Coming in to bat at No. 4 in the 12th over, Root has put together a 70-run third-wicket partnership alongside batter Ollie Pope. While Pope has completed a personal half-century, Root appears set to reach one in a 296-run chase . In spite of losing opening batters Alex Lees (9) and Zac Crawley (25), Pope and Root‚Äôs positive display of batting has ensured that England finish Day 4 with a significant advantage in their hand.

The Yorkshire crowd were in fine voice on the Western Terrace as they enjoyed another impressive display from the home side - who have already won the three-match series over New Zealand . But that excitable atmosphere boiled over on the evening of day four as the cameras caught a few individuals fighting inside the ground. A man in an old England shirt could be seen trying to throw punches at another man sitting behind him in the stands. Commentator and former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull was heard saying on Sky Sports : \"Bit of biffo on the Western Terrace there.\" Reacting to the scenes in the stands, one social media user said: \"No one seeing or caring about Crawley's wicket because they were watching a fight in the stands instead. God bless the Western Terrace.\" Another added: \"The simple answer is, if you don't like this sort of thing, then don't buy a ticket on the Western Terrace. \"After all, it is not as if that part of the ground doesn't have a reputation for this sort of thing.\" And a third said: \"Oh the Western Terrace have woken up. Must‚Äôve been that twelfth beer‚Ä¶\" Meanwhile on the pitch, England are 113 runs away from claiming a 3-0 series victory over New Zealand ahead of the final day's play. SUN BINGO GET ¬£50 BONUS & 50 FREE SPINS TODAY With new captain Ben Stokes leading the side, England beat New Zealand at both Lord's and Trent Bridge. They then closed day three of the Third Test with New Zealand on 168-5 - the visitors leading by just 137 runs - after Jonny Bairstow hit a sensational 162 for the hosts. Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell put on a partnership worth more than 100 to hand New Zealand back the ascendency. But Matt Potts and Jack Leach then quickly removed the tail to give England a more than reachable target of 296 to win. Alex Lees and Zack Crawley fell relatively early on but Ollie Pope and Joe Root then guided them to 183-2 at close of play.","pubDate":"2022-06-26 17:04:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IRE vs IND: Fast bowler Umran Malik makes his India debut in 1st T20I","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/ire-vs-ind-fast-bowler-umran-malik-makes-his-india-debut-in-1st-t20i-750618","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Umran Malik picked up 22 wickets in IPL 2022India and Ireland are set to play 2 T20Is in DublinThe start of the first T20I has been delayed due to rain","content":"IRE vs IND: Fast bowler Umran Malik makes his India debut in 1st T20I Umran Malik, the fast bowler from Jammu and Kashmir, has made his international debut in the first T20I between India and Ireland.

He won the toss and opted to bowl in the first T20I on Sunday. \"We are going to bowl. We would have loved to bat, but looking at the weather we felt bowling would be better. It is nice to be in Ireland. Have fans here and feels like playing at home. It is an absolute honour to lead India. Any cricket who starts playing dreams of leading the country and I am very lucky to be leading my country. My role is simple. Just back them (the players) and ask them to play with freedom and express themselves,\" Hardik said at the toss on Sunday. The start of the game has been delayed by rain in Dublin. Malik was also picked for India's recently concluded series against South Africa. However, he did not get a game.

Veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik, who has reinvented himself as a finisher in India's current white-ball setup, led the praises for Pandit, comparing him to the iconic Manchester United manager Ferguson who has won 13 Premier League Championships with the Red Devils. \"Lovely pictures @BCCI, Couldn't be happier for CHANDU sir. Amazing, Understanding personality traits, Preparing them accordingly, Using them tactically to win championships. ALEX FERGUSON of RANJI trophy #GOAT,\" Karthik tweeted. India ace off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin hailed Pandit's success and wrote: \"Chandrakant Pandit. That's the tweet.\" Centuries from Yash Dubey, Shubham Sharma and Rajat Patidar in the first innings derailed Mumbai who were all out for 269 in their second innings. Sharma and Patidar then chased down 108 in 29.5 overs to make it a historic day for Madhya Pradesh. \"Many congratulations to Madhya Pradesh on winning the Ranji Trophy . Great focus and determination to beat 41-time champion Mumbai. MP deserves all the laurels and glory, have some bright talent and this is truly a historic day for them,\" wrote former India opener Virender Sehwag. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri also acknowledged Pandit's feat: \"To go across 3 states and win Ranji trophies is a remarkable achievement and a true reflection of his dedication and commitment to the job. Well done Chandu,\" Shastri said. Veteran leg-spinner Amit Mishra also congratulated the MP head coach for the massive achievement. \"What a journey for this legend Chandrakar Pandit..Lost the Ranji Final in 1999 as a captain but won it today as a coach. Life gives you everything but in its own sweet time. Really happy for MP captain Aditya Shrivastav and the whole MP team for winning first Ranji Cup ever,\" Mishra tweeted. The Ranji Trophy was held in two phases on either side of the IPL and BCCI secretary Jay Shah acknowledged the tremendous effort it took for MP to win the title. \"Congratulations Madhya Pradesh on winning the #RanjiTrophy2022! We've witnessed some terrific performances throughout the season. Great efforts by everyone @BCCI for ensuring another successful Ranji season amidst the pandemic,\" Shah wrote. MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also praised the performance of the side. \"We are the champions,\" Chouhan's congratulatory note read.

During the first T20I of the ongoing India‚Äôs tour of Ireland in Dublin, India captain Hardik Pandya has won the toss and chose to bowl. The welcoming development came after Rishabh Pant losing five tosses in a row against South Africa at home earlier this month. ‚ÄúWe are going to bowl. We would have loved to bat but looking at the weather , we felt bowling would be better. Nice to be in Ireland. Have fans here and feels like playing at home. Absolute honour to lead India. Any cricket who starts playing dreams of leading the country and I am very lucky to be leading my country,‚Äù Pandya told BT Sport at the toss. Much like Pandya, Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie also wanted to bowl first due to the same reason. In what is going to be only the fourth T20I between Ireland and India, Barbirnie pointed out excitement among his players. ‚ÄúProbably would have bowled because of the weather around. Guys are excited for this series. Really important to play against one of the best teams in the world,‚Äù Balbirnie told BT Sport at the toss. India, who had last faced South Africa in Bengaluru, have made three changes to their Playing XI from that match. Batters Suryakumar Yadav and Deepak Hooda and debutant fast bowler Umran Malik have replaced batter Shreyas Iyer, Pant and pacer Harshal Patel from that XI. While Iyer and Pant are missing this tour due to their involvement in the parallel tour of England, Patel has been left out despite being the highest wicket-taker in South Africa T20Is in order to hand an opportunity to Malik. Congratulations #UmranMalik for team india debut üáÆüá≥ #ultimategoal ‚Äî Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) June 26, 2022 Readers must note that Pandya is leading India for the first time just like Pant had led India for the first time against South Africa. The same has only been possible due to the absence of captain Rohit Sharma and vice-captain KL Rahul. While Sharma is in England alongside Iyer and Pant, Rahul was ruled out of both the tours due to a groin injury .","pubDate":"2022-06-26 16:30:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs New Zealand, 3rd Test, New Zealand tour of England, 2022 - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzM4MzMyL2VuZ2xhbmQtbG9zZS1vcGVuZXJzLWluLWNoYXNl0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England vs New Zealand, 3rd Test, New Zealand tour of England, 2022¬†¬†Cricbuzz3rd Test: England 113 runs away from series sweep against New Zealand¬†¬†Times of IndiaEngland strike late against New Zealand to seize control of Headingley test¬†¬†Hindustan TimesLive Cricket Score - England vs New Zealand, 3rd Test, Day 4 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzEngland chase 296 to win 3rd Test against New Zealand¬†¬†Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-26 16:29:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs IRE: Sanju Samson ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§á‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§≤‡•á‡§µ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π ‡§§‡•ã ‡§´‡•Ç‡§ü‡§æ ‡§´‡•à‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ, ‡§∏‡•ã‡§∂‡§≤ ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ê‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∞‡§ø‡§è‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ireland-vs-india-1st-t20i-sanju-samson-out-from-playing-xi-fans-trolled-bcci-on-social-media-dublin-2155061","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sanju Samson Dublin Ireland vs India 1st T20I:</strong> ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§∞‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§° ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§ü‡•Ä20 ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§°‡§¨‡§≤‡§ø‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§á‡§Ç‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡§æ‡§¨‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡•ç‡§∏‡§Æ‡•à‡§® ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§® ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§á‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§≤‡•á‡§µ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§á‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§≤‡•á‡§µ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§´‡•à‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•ã‡§∂‡§≤ ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§´‡•à‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•á ‡§ã‡§∑‡§≠ ‡§™‡§Ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§•-‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Ü‡§à ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§á‡§Ç‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§°‡§¨‡§≤‡§ø‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ü‡•Ä20 ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ú ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡•á‡§ó‡•Ä. ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡§æ‡§¨‡§≤‡§æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§ú‡§π ‡§∏‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•Å‡§Ü ‡§π‡•à.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§á‡§Ç‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡•á ‡§°‡§¨‡§≤‡§ø‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ü‡•Ä20 ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§ã‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï‡§µ‡§æ‡§°‡§º, ‡§à‡§∂‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∂‡§®, ‡§¶‡•Ä‡§™‡§ï ‡§π‡•Å‡§°‡•ç‡§°‡§æ, ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§µ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§á‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§≤‡•á‡§µ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§á‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•Ä. ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§´‡•à‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§´‡•à‡§®‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Ü‡§à ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§π‡§æ‡§•‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ. ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Ü‡§à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ã‡§∑‡§≠ ‡§™‡§Ç‡§§ &nbsp;‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">‡§ó‡•å‡§∞‡§§‡§≤‡§¨ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Ü‡§à‡§™‡•Ä‡§è‡§≤ 2022 ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§® ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ç ‡§®‡•á ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§á‡§Ç‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§Ü‡§ñ‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•Ä20 ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§´‡§∞‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä 2022 ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ. ‡§ú‡§¨‡§ï‡§ø ‡§Ü‡§ñ‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§®‡§°‡•á ‡§Æ‡•à‡§ö ‡§ú‡•Å‡§≤‡§æ‡§à 2021 ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ. ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡•á‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§Æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•å‡§ï‡§æ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Sanju Samson isn&rsquo;t good enough to play in a 2nd india 11 now ?<br />He&rsquo;s literally much better t20 player than some Indian batsman who r going to feature in wc <br />U can&rsquo;t expect him to avg 50 <br />He isn&rsquo;t some kind of statpadder <br />Plays t20 the way it should be played .<br />wtf <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SanjuSamson?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SanjuSamson</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/P28UDKbV0f\">pic.twitter.com/P28UDKbV0f</a></p> &mdash;

During the first T20I of the ongoing India‚Äôs tour of Ireland at The Village, Malahide in Dublin, the match has failed to commence at the stipulated time due to rain. With the pitch under cover, the rain Gods decided to make an appearance minutes before the Toss. However, with the rain halting in a few minutes as well, the Toss did take place after a 10-minute delay, with the same going in favour of the debutant Indian skipper Hardik Pandya, who decided to bowl first looking at the dense cloud cover. While the Jammu and Kashmir pacer Umran Malik will mark his debut in Indian colours today, pacer Conor Olphert will make his maiden international appearance for Ireland. However, the bad news for the aforementioned debutants, and the eager fans in general is that, the rain is back again at the venue of play, which means that we are in for a delayed start. While the downpour has been inconsistent in the past hour of so at The Village Ground, Malahide, the present update it that it is a heavy downpour, but might also just last for some minutes, courtesy of a strong wind that is blowing across the stadium.

Having said that, with a cloud cover of 89%, the sun is likely to peep out from them just a tad by the next hour, which might help the play to start the least. With a 66% rain forecast in the next couple of hours (6-7 pm local time) as well, fans are in for a for a start-stop day for sure, with the match officials highly likely to reduce the number of Overs, if at all the rain relents.","pubDate":"2022-06-26 16:05:42","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Highlights Score India vs Leicestershire 4-Day Warm Up Match Day 4 Highlights Updates: Match Drawn - Cricket Country News","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMi9AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcmlja2V0Y291bnRyeS5jb20vbmV3cy9oaWdobGlnaHRzLWluZGlhLXZzLWxlaWNlc3RlcnNoaXJlLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtc3RyZWFtaW5nLWNyaWNrZXQtaW5kLXZzLWxlaWMtdXBkYXRlcy13YXJtLXVwLW1hdGNoLWRheS00LW9uLWhvdHN0YXItc3RyZWFtLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtY3JpY2tldC1tYXRjaC12aXJhdC1rb2xoaS1yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtci1hc2h3aW4tamFkZWphLWhhbnVtYS12aWhhci0xMDI3ODEz0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Highlights Score India vs Leicestershire 4-Day Warm Up Match Day 4 Highlights Updates: Match Drawn¬†¬†Cricket Country NewsRecent Match Report - Indians vs Leics Tour Match 2021-2022¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Leicestershire, Tour Match, Day 4 Highlights: Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant Star As Tour Match ..¬†¬†NDTV Sports'Is it warm-up or gully cricket?': Twitter amazed at India's bizarre tactics¬†¬†Hindustan TimesLive Score India vs Leicestershire 4-Day Warm Up Match Day 4 Live Updates: Match Drawn¬†¬†Cricket Country NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-26 16:00:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Ireland 1st T20I Live Score Updates: Rain returns again, start delayed - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS12cy1pcmVsYW5kLTFzdC10MjBpLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy03OTkyNDc2L9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Ireland 1st T20I Live Score Updates: Rain returns again, start delayed¬†¬†The Indian ExpressMatch Preview - Ireland vs India, India in Ireland 2022, 1st T20I¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIND vs IRE Live Cricket Score 1st T20I Latest Updates: Start Delayed Due to Rain After Hardik Pandya Elects¬†¬†News18India vs Ireland 1st T20 Weather Update: Rain to play spoilsport in Sunday`s encounter at Dublin?¬†¬†Zee NewsIndia vs Ireland 1st T20I 2022 Live Score: Umran Malik makes debut as favourites India take on Ireland¬†¬†Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-26 15:56:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs New Zealand LIVE: Cricket score and updates from third Test as Alex Lees and Zak Crawley both out","link":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/england-vs-zealand-live-cricket-085937728.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-26 15:54:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
