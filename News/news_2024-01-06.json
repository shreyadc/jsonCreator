After Josh Hazlewood (4-16) ran through Pakistan on day three, the tourists offered a brief resistance on Saturday morning before they were all out for 115. While Mohammad Rizwan (28) and Aamir Jamal (18) put on 42 for the eighth wicket, Pakistan folded quickly once Nathan Lyon had the former caught at leg slip. Lyon also bowled Hasan Ali to end the innings, finishing with figures of 3-36. The target gives Warner a realistic hope of being at the crease to hit the winning runs, in what would be a fitting end to the 37-year-old's 112-Test career. He will open alongside close friend Usman Khawaja, who his relationship with dates back to pre-teen days playing together for South-Eastern in junior representative cricket. Warner had earlier led the team onto the field to start the day, while \"Thanks Dave\" with his trademark leap also painted on the ground in front of the Members Stand. There are still some hurdles for Australia to clear to claim the 3-0 clean sweep, with small targets having proven notoriously tricky in the past at the SCG. Pakistan were bowled out for 139 chasing 176 against Australia in Sydney in 2010, while Australia famously failed to run down 117 against South Africa in 1994.

How cool,” Ian Smith said on Fox Cricket. “Take it all in everybody. A cricketing career dedicated to that Baggy Green on his head, may well end today.” Before play, Warner spoke to Fox Cricket’s Mark Howard, who asked the outgoing star what it was like to play his farewell Test in front of a home crowd. “It’s amazing. I did say six months ago that this would be ideal,” Warner said. Over the years, I haven’t been everyone’s cup of tea but for me, I’ve played the game as hard as I can and trying to do my best for the team. “Hopefully I’ve regained that trust and belief from everyone.” Warner was typically honest in the chat with Howard, stressing that all he wanted to do was play for Australia with “pride and passion”.

Warner was a central figure in the infamous ball-tampering scandal in 2018, where he copped a year suspension from first class cricket. He also had an off-field run-in with South African keeper Quinton de Kock, stemming from personal sledging claims. “I think a lot of people don’t get to see or meet or know the person. From when I first started, I was that chirpy little fella that was out there,” Warner said. “That was my role in the team. my role in the team was to go out there and get under the batter’s skin and the opposition’s skin and yeah, it did boost me a little bit because they came at me when I batted. “But they saw it early days. and I think your first impression, you don’t get a second chance at that and you know, I’ve tried to rebuild that trust and faith.” Warner says he has no doubt changed his approach in his later years, attributing a self-imposed drinking ban. David Warner walks onto SCG at the start of Day 4 Source: FOX SPORTS “I went two years where i was being called the Reverend, I stopped drinking for two and a half years and really enjoyed that time,” he said. “I think people wanted the old bull back, but for me, it was going out there and playing with pride and passion. and there’s other ways to go about it. I’ve toned it down a hell of a lot and that’s the real person that I am. “I think the game’s changed a lot as well. you’re playing with a lot of the guys you’re playing against. there’s no need to go out there and be really chirpy and aggressive, there’s other ways to do that. If I had my time again and I knew that, I probably would show a little bit more patience with myself and I’d bite my tongue a little bit more.” Day 4 sets up perfectly for Warner to be the hero in his swansong Test match, with the Aussies set a total of 130 to win.","pubDate":"2024-01-06 00:13:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/187125447546607a226b151c9276918c","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"a62a1cc20415c5da96d585ab666b8c20","title":"BBL's Harper cleared of fracture after training mishap","link":"https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/8478038/bbls-harper-cleared-of-fracture-after-training-mishap/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Sam Harper has been cleared of a fracture and soft-tissue damage after being struck in the head at Melbourne Stars training and hospitalised.

Harper will now undergo a series of medical tests and won't feature for the Stars in Saturday night's BBL match against the Sydney Sixers at the MCG. The former Melbourne Renegades player - who has a history of concussions - was sidelined for several weeks in 2017. It followed South Australia 's Jake Lehmann accidentally hitting him in the head with his bat when Harper was behind the stumps for Victoria. Harper spent almost a month in a dark hospital room afterwards and initially needed a walking frame. He labelled it 'the worst three weeks' of his life. In 2020, Harper was also taken to hospital after he hit his head on the ground in a freak collision with Hobart Hurricanes player Nathan Ellis while playing for the Renegades in the Big Bash.

That may have been the case, but conveniently ignores the presence of Lyon unmoving in his way. 20m ago 18.05 EST 27th over: Pakistan 69-7 (Rizwan 7, Jamal 0) Hazlewood is immediately onto his probing line and length, putting the ball in the right areas ready for the pitch to do the rest. No wickets, but there’s a half-shout for LBW as Rizwan falls over to the offside, saved by an inside edge onto his pad. And that inside edge has hurt the Pakistan batter with the ball jarring his left knee, making it awkward for him to run the first single of the morning. 25m ago 18.00 EST Right, onto the matter in hand of a Test match. The two sides are out in the middle. Josh Hazlewood has the ball, Mohammad Rizwan is on strike. 26m ago 17.58 EST Speaking of box office, international cricket no longer has two of the most watchable, and quotable, stars of the modern era with Warner chasing Broad outside off-stump into retirement. 32m ago 17.53 EST As Barney Ronay wrote ahead of the series, one thing Warner has been the entirety of his career is box office. Love or loath him, he will be missed. We look forward to the thoughts next year of Jayden Goodbloke, who makes self-aware jokes and doesn’t seem insane, powered by rage or unhealthily obsessed with the meaning of a green hat. For now it is time to treasure a last great summer of Dave. We will miss David Warner and his main villain energy. He made cricket feel epic | Barney Ronay Read more 34m ago 17.51 EST Relive where it all began back in 2009 at the MCG. Warner was such an unknown he was listed as a right-hand batter by Channel 9 on his first on-screen graphic. He was also nearly run out for one in the first over. 42m ago 17.43 EST Has there been a more contentious cricketer in modern history? It has been impossible not to hold an opinion about David Warner at every stage throughout his extraordinary career. Moreover, for many of us that opinion has changed frequently and dramatically as the opener has repeatedly found himself at the centre of the action on and off the field. As the introduction to this Geoff Lemon piece from late 2022 demonstrates, in just one paragraph it’s easy to form many competing opinions of the man simultaneously. Over a long career, David Warner has presented many versions of himself. The short-form bludgeoner of his T20 debut in 2009 gave way to the studious opener of his first Test century on a Hobart greentop in 2011. The raucous presence known as The Bull who was suspended from the 2013 Ashes gave way to the contemplative Reverend by 2015, schooling teammates on the power of positive thinking, before returning to his most confrontational mode before the Ashes in 2017. The instigator of the sandpaper ball-tampering plot in 2018 served a year’s playing ban, ran the well-worn path of public redemption via on-field success, and has since presented himself as an elder statesman with an accordingly impeccable disciplinary record. Narrative spins in David Warner’s favour but that is to forget the reasons behind his ban | Geoff Lemon Read more 51m ago 17.34 EST It looks like there’ll be a decent crowd in early at the SCG, many of them presumably in attendance to salute the retiring David Warner. There is a long line of members, stretching back well past NRL HQ Day 4 @scg @fo pic.twitter.com/vsGeENT7Q7 — John C Moriarty (@JohnCMoriarty) January 5, 2024 55m ago 17.30 EST It is dry in Sydney today with temperatures in the low 20s, kept in check by an easterly breeze. No risk of rain or bad light pushing us into Sunday. The pitch proved treacherous yesterday with inconsistent bounce, plenty of turn, and frequent puffs of dust as the ball burst through the surface. Day 4️⃣ at the SCG #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/LSBr6EwMWx — 7Cricket (@7Cricket) January 5, 2024 1h ago 17.22 EST If you want to catch up on yesterday’s action, read all about it here: Josh Hazlewood sparks Pakistan collapse to reclaim momentum for Australia on day three Read more 1h ago 17.17 EST Preamble Jonathan Howcroft Hello everybody and welcome to day four of the third Test between Australia and Pakistan from the SCG. We’ll be underway in Sydney at 10am AEDT. It is almost certainly the final day’s play of the series, and with it, the final day in the Test career of David Warner. Josh Hazlewood’s late triple-wicket maiden yesterday evening means Australia are poised to complete a 3-0 series sweep, and be in a position to chair Warner from his home ground with the send-off he has long craved. Pakistan will resume on 68/7 – a lead of 82 – reliant on first innings heroes Mohammad Rizwan and Aamer Jamal to set Australia a troublesome total to chase. Anything over 100 could be nervy, anything over 200 challenging, on an uneven pitch that encouraged 15 wickets to fall on Friday. I’ll be around for the opening half of the day, and if we get much beyond lunch Geoff Lemon will take the reins. While I’m on, feel free to drop me an email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com . David Warner will bat for Australia for the final time in Test cricket today.

The Canadian men will be centre stage June 1 when they take on the U.S. at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Dallas in the opening match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. And millions will be watching when Canada takes on India and Pakistan in subsequent Group A matches. \"That group pretty much has the most eyeballs,\" Zafar said. \"We couldn't have asked for a better group … That's huge for us.\" Also extremely challenging. India is currently ranked No. 1 in the world in the 20-over game while Pakistan is No. 4, Ireland No. 12 and Canada No. 20. Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. Playing the tournament opener is the icing on the cake for Zafar. The Canada-U. S. rivalry is considered the oldest in international cricket, given the two met in what is thought to be the first international cricket match in 1844, 33 years prior to England’s meeting against Australia. Canada won the two-innings match by 23 runs that day at the St. George’s Cricket Club in Manhattan. The West Indies, which is co-hosting the 55-game tournament with the U.S., opens June 2 against Papua New Guinea at the Guyana National Stadium. Led by Zafar, the Canadian men qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. Zafar, an all-rounder whose forte is as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, hopes the tournament will shine a spotlight on the Canadian team and inspire a new generation of cricketers back home. \"You couldn't ask for a better platform than the T20 World Cup,\" he said. Group B is made up of defending champion England, Australia, Namibia, Scotland and Oman. Group C consists of New Zealand, the West Indies, Afghanistan, Uganda and Papua New Guinea while Group D is South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Netherlands and Nepal. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Rivals India and Pakistan will face off June 9 in a 34,000-seat modular stadium some 50 kilometres east of downtown Manhattan in Nassau County. Eight matches will be played at the venue. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians leave at the end of the month for Hong Kong and then Nepal for pre-tournament camps ahead of a 50-over tournament in Dubai. They are scheduled to return in early March when they will turn their focus to the 20-over game. --- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.

After Josh Hazlewood (4-16) ran through Pakistan on day three, the tourists offered a brief resistance on Saturday morning before they were all out for 115. While Mohammad Rizwan (28) and Aamir Jamal (18) put on 42 for the eighth wicket, Pakistan folded quickly once Nathan Lyon had the former caught at leg slip. Lyon also bowled Hasan Ali to end the innings, finishing with figures of 3-36. The target gives Warner a realistic hope of being at the crease to hit the winning runs, in what would be a fitting end to the 37-year-old's 112-Test career. He will open alongside close friend Usman Khawaja, who his relationship with dates back to pre-teen days playing together for South-Eastern in junior representative cricket. Warner had earlier led the team onto the field to start the day, while \"Thanks Dave\" with his trademark leap also painted on the ground in front of the Members Stand. There are still some hurdles for Australia to clear to claim the 3-0 clean sweep, with small targets having proven notoriously tricky in the past at the SCG. Pakistan were bowled out for 139 chasing 176 against Australia in Sydney in 2010, while Australia famously failed to run down 117 against South Africa in 1994.

How cool,” Ian Smith said on Fox Cricket. “Take it all in everybody. A cricketing career dedicated to that Baggy Green on his head, may well end today.” Before play, Warner spoke to Fox Cricket’s Mark Howard, who asked the outgoing star what it was like to play his farewell Test in front of a home crowd. “It’s amazing. I did say six months ago that this would be ideal,” Warner said. Over the years, I haven’t been everyone’s cup of tea but for me, I’ve played the game as hard as I can and trying to do my best for the team. “Hopefully I’ve regained that trust and belief from everyone.” Warner was typically honest in the chat with Howard, stressing that all he wanted to do was play for Australia with “pride and passion”. Stars issue Harper update | 00:15 MATCH CENTRE: Live stats, scorecard, and more DAY 3 REPORT: Eleven wickets in BONKERS session as Hazlewood’s late explosion puts Aussies on top However, the outgoing star lamented the way he used his aggression out in the middle at times throughout his career. Warner was a central figure in the infamous ball-tampering scandal in 2018, where he copped a year suspension from first class cricket. He also had an off-field run-in with South African keeper Quinton de Kock, stemming from personal sledging claims. “I think a lot of people don’t get to see or meet or know the person. From when I first started, I was that chirpy little fella that was out there,” Warner said. “That was my role in the team. my role in the team was to go out there and get under the batter’s skin and the opposition’s skin and yeah, it did boost me a little bit because they came at me when I batted. “But they saw it early days. and I think your first impression, you don’t get a second chance at that and you know, I’ve tried to rebuild that trust and faith.” Warner says he has no doubt changed his approach in his later years, attributing a self-imposed drinking ban. David Warner walks onto SCG at the start of Day 4 Source: FOX SPORTS “I went two years where i was being called the Reverend, I stopped drinking for two and a half years and really enjoyed that time,” he said. “I think people wanted the old bull back, but for me, it was going out there and playing with pride and passion. and there’s other ways to go about it. I’ve toned it down a hell of a lot and that’s the real person that I am. “I think the game’s changed a lot as well. you’re playing with a lot of the guys you’re playing against. there’s no need to go out there and be really chirpy and aggressive, there’s other ways to do that. If I had my time again and I knew that, I probably would show a little bit more patience with myself and I’d bite my tongue a little bit more.” Day 4 sets up perfectly for Warner to be the hero in his swansong Test match, with the Aussies set a total of 130 to win.","pubDate":"2024-01-06 00:13:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/187125447546607a226b151c9276918c","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"a62a1cc20415c5da96d585ab666b8c20","title":"BBL's Harper cleared of fracture after training mishap","link":"https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/8478038/bbls-harper-cleared-of-fracture-after-training-mishap/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Sam Harper has been cleared of a fracture and soft-tissue damage after being struck in the head at Melbourne Stars training and hospitalised.

Harper suffered a laceration on his chin and neck after being struck by a ball as he attempted to play a ramp shot at training on Friday. The 27-year-old was attended by team medical staff before being taken to a Melbourne hospital, where he stayed overnight. \"Harper will be monitored by doctors over the coming days,\" a statement from the Stars read. Harper has a history of concussions and was sidelined for several weeks in 2017 after being accidentally struck in the head with a bat.

Harper will now undergo a series of medical tests and won't feature for the Stars in Saturday night's BBL match against the Sydney Sixers at the MCG. The former Melbourne Renegades player - who has a history of concussions - was sidelined for several weeks in 2017. It followed South Australia 's Jake Lehmann accidentally hitting him in the head with his bat when Harper was behind the stumps for Victoria. Harper spent almost a month in a dark hospital room afterwards and initially needed a walking frame. He labelled it 'the worst three weeks' of his life. In 2020, Harper was also taken to hospital after he hit his head on the ground in a freak collision with Hobart Hurricanes player Nathan Ellis while playing for the Renegades in the Big Bash.

Rizwan cannot resist chasing a delivery flighted by Lyon well wide of off stump, and almost drags on an inside edge. He survives, and Pakistan’s lead grows to 94. 4m ago 18.21 EST 31st over: Pakistan 77-7 (Rizwan 10, Jamal 5) Hazlewood continues to hit the right areas but the pitch is behaving, for now, and this form pair are not attempting anything reckless. 8m ago 18.17 EST 30th over: Pakistan 76-7 (Rizwan 9, Jamal 5) The pitch is still waking up after its morning roll, making the most dangerous Lyon delivery the one that doesn’t turn too much, threatening the outside edge, not the bat-pad. After Rizwan scampers a single, Lyon gets one to hold its line and beat Jamal’s lope forward in exactly that fashion. 11m ago 18.13 EST 29th over: Pakistan 75-7 (Rizwan 8, Jamal 5) Jamal cuts hard behind point for the first boundary of the morning. Hazlewood has yet to channel the magic of Friday evening. The Australian’s Peter Lalor is on Channel Seven’s TV coverage, flying the kite that Steve Smith is increasingly open to the prospect of replacing Warner at the top of the order. 15m ago 18.10 EST 28th over: Pakistan 71-7 (Rizwan 8, Jamal 1) Nathan Lyon opens from the Randwick end and Pakistan milk a couple of singles without alarm. Warner makes his presence known from slip while he still can, complaining Rizwan was running down the pitch. That may have been the case, but conveniently ignores the presence of Lyon unmoving in his way. 20m ago 18.05 EST 27th over: Pakistan 69-7 (Rizwan 7, Jamal 0) Hazlewood is immediately onto his probing line and length, putting the ball in the right areas ready for the pitch to do the rest. No wickets, but there’s a half-shout for LBW as Rizwan falls over to the offside, saved by an inside edge onto his pad. And that inside edge has hurt the Pakistan batter with the ball jarring his left knee, making it awkward for him to run the first single of the morning. 25m ago 18.00 EST Right, onto the matter in hand of a Test match. The two sides are out in the middle. Josh Hazlewood has the ball, Mohammad Rizwan is on strike. 26m ago 17.58 EST Speaking of box office, international cricket no longer has two of the most watchable, and quotable, stars of the modern era with Warner chasing Broad outside off-stump into retirement. 32m ago 17.53 EST As Barney Ronay wrote ahead of the series, one thing Warner has been the entirety of his career is box office. Love or loath him, he will be missed. We look forward to the thoughts next year of Jayden Goodbloke, who makes self-aware jokes and doesn’t seem insane, powered by rage or unhealthily obsessed with the meaning of a green hat. For now it is time to treasure a last great summer of Dave. We will miss David Warner and his main villain energy. He made cricket feel epic | Barney Ronay Read more 34m ago 17.51 EST Relive where it all began back in 2009 at the MCG. Warner was such an unknown he was listed as a right-hand batter by Channel 9 on his first on-screen graphic. He was also nearly run out for one in the first over. 42m ago 17.43 EST Has there been a more contentious cricketer in modern history? It has been impossible not to hold an opinion about David Warner at every stage throughout his extraordinary career. Moreover, for many of us that opinion has changed frequently and dramatically as the opener has repeatedly found himself at the centre of the action on and off the field. As the introduction to this Geoff Lemon piece from late 2022 demonstrates, in just one paragraph it’s easy to form many competing opinions of the man simultaneously. Over a long career, David Warner has presented many versions of himself. The short-form bludgeoner of his T20 debut in 2009 gave way to the studious opener of his first Test century on a Hobart greentop in 2011. The raucous presence known as The Bull who was suspended from the 2013 Ashes gave way to the contemplative Reverend by 2015, schooling teammates on the power of positive thinking, before returning to his most confrontational mode before the Ashes in 2017. The instigator of the sandpaper ball-tampering plot in 2018 served a year’s playing ban, ran the well-worn path of public redemption via on-field success, and has since presented himself as an elder statesman with an accordingly impeccable disciplinary record. Narrative spins in David Warner’s favour but that is to forget the reasons behind his ban | Geoff Lemon Read more 51m ago 17.34 EST It looks like there’ll be a decent crowd in early at the SCG, many of them presumably in attendance to salute the retiring David Warner.

No risk of rain or bad light pushing us into Sunday. The pitch proved treacherous yesterday with inconsistent bounce, plenty of turn, and frequent puffs of dust as the ball burst through the surface.

We’ll be underway in Sydney at 10am AEDT. It is almost certainly the final day’s play of the series, and with it, the final day in the Test career of David Warner. Josh Hazlewood’s late triple-wicket maiden yesterday evening means Australia are poised to complete a 3-0 series sweep, and be in a position to chair Warner from his home ground with the send-off he has long craved. Pakistan will resume on 68/7 – a lead of 82 – reliant on first innings heroes Mohammad Rizwan and Aamer Jamal to set Australia a troublesome total to chase. Anything over 100 could be nervy, anything over 200 challenging, on an uneven pitch that encouraged 15 wickets to fall on Friday. I’ll be around for the opening half of the day, and if we get much beyond lunch Geoff Lemon will take the reins. While I’m on, feel free to drop me an email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com . David Warner will bat for Australia for the final time in Test cricket today.

The Canadian men will be centre stage June 1 when they take on the U.S. at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Dallas in the opening match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. And millions will be watching when Canada takes on India and Pakistan in subsequent Group A matches. \"That group pretty much has the most eyeballs,\" Zafar said. \"We couldn't have asked for a better group … That's huge for us.\" Also extremely challenging. India is currently ranked No. 1 in the world in the 20-over game while Pakistan is No. 4, Ireland No. 12 and Canada No. 20. Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. Playing the tournament opener is the icing on the cake for Zafar. The Canada-U. S. rivalry is considered the oldest in international cricket, given the two met in what is thought to be the first international cricket match in 1844, 33 years prior to England’s meeting against Australia. Canada won the two-innings match by 23 runs that day at the St. George’s Cricket Club in Manhattan. The West Indies, which is co-hosting the 55-game tournament with the U.S., opens June 2 against Papua New Guinea at the Guyana National Stadium. Led by Zafar, the Canadian men qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. Zafar, an all-rounder whose forte is as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, hopes the tournament will shine a spotlight on the Canadian team and inspire a new generation of cricketers back home. \"You couldn't ask for a better platform than the T20 World Cup,\" he said. Group B is made up of defending champion England, Australia, Namibia, Scotland and Oman. Group C consists of New Zealand, the West Indies, Afghanistan, Uganda and Papua New Guinea while Group D is South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Netherlands and Nepal. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Rivals India and Pakistan will face off June 9 in a 34,000-seat modular stadium some 50 kilometres east of downtown Manhattan in Nassau County. Eight matches will be played at the venue. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians leave at the end of the month for Hong Kong and then Nepal for pre-tournament camps ahead of a 50-over tournament in Dubai. They are scheduled to return in early March when they will turn their focus to the 20-over game. --- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.

After Josh Hazlewood (4-16) ran through Pakistan on day three, the tourists offered a brief resistance on Saturday morning before they were all out for 115. While Mohammad Rizwan (28) and Aamir Jamal (18) put on 42 for the eighth wicket, Pakistan folded quickly once Nathan Lyon had the former caught at leg slip. Lyon also bowled Hasan Ali to end the innings, finishing with figures of 3-36. The target gives Warner a realistic hope of being at the crease to hit the winning runs, in what would be a fitting end to the 37-year-old's 112-Test career. He will open alongside close friend Usman Khawaja, who his relationship with dates back to pre-teen days playing together for South-Eastern in junior representative cricket. Warner had earlier led the team onto the field to start the day, while \"Thanks Dave\" with his trademark leap also painted on the ground in front of the Members Stand. There are still some hurdles for Australia to clear to claim the 3-0 clean sweep, with small targets having proven notoriously tricky in the past at the SCG.

How cool,” Ian Smith said on Fox Cricket. “Take it all in everybody. A cricketing career dedicated to that Baggy Green on his head, may well end today.” Before play, Warner spoke to Fox Cricket’s Mark Howard, who asked the outgoing star what it was like to play his farewell Test in front of a home crowd. “It’s amazing. I did say six months ago that this would be ideal,” Warner said. Over the years, I haven’t been everyone’s cup of tea but for me, I’ve played the game as hard as I can and trying to do my best for the team. “Hopefully I’ve regained that trust and belief from everyone.” Warner was typically honest in the chat with Howard, stressing that all he wanted to do was play for Australia with “pride and passion”.

Warner was a central figure in the infamous ball-tampering scandal in 2018, where he copped a year suspension from first class cricket. He also had an off-field run-in with South African keeper Quinton de Kock, stemming from personal sledging claims. “I think a lot of people don’t get to see or meet or know the person. From when I first started, I was that chirpy little fella that was out there,” Warner said. “That was my role in the team. my role in the team was to go out there and get under the batter’s skin and the opposition’s skin and yeah, it did boost me a little bit because they came at me when I batted. “But they saw it early days. and I think your first impression, you don’t get a second chance at that and you know, I’ve tried to rebuild that trust and faith.” Warner says he has no doubt changed his approach in his later years, attributing a self-imposed drinking ban. David Warner walks onto SCG at the start of Day 4 Source: FOX SPORTS “I went two years where i was being called the Reverend, I stopped drinking for two and a half years and really enjoyed that time,” he said. “I think people wanted the old bull back, but for me, it was going out there and playing with pride and passion. and there’s other ways to go about it. I’ve toned it down a hell of a lot and that’s the real person that I am. “I think the game’s changed a lot as well. you’re playing with a lot of the guys you’re playing against. there’s no need to go out there and be really chirpy and aggressive, there’s other ways to do that. If I had my time again and I knew that, I probably would show a little bit more patience with myself and I’d bite my tongue a little bit more.” Day 4 sets up perfectly for Warner to be the hero in his swansong Test match, with the Aussies set a total of 130 to win.","pubDate":"2024-01-06 00:13:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/187125447546607a226b151c9276918c","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"a62a1cc20415c5da96d585ab666b8c20","title":"BBL's Harper cleared of fracture after training mishap","link":"https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/story/8478038/bbls-harper-cleared-of-fracture-after-training-mishap/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Sam Harper has been cleared of a fracture and soft-tissue damage after being struck in the head at Melbourne Stars training and hospitalised.

Harper will now undergo a series of medical tests and won't feature for the Stars in Saturday night's BBL match against the Sydney Sixers at the MCG. The former Melbourne Renegades player - who has a history of concussions - was sidelined for several weeks in 2017. It followed South Australia 's Jake Lehmann accidentally hitting him in the head with his bat when Harper was behind the stumps for Victoria. Harper spent almost a month in a dark hospital room afterwards and initially needed a walking frame. He labelled it 'the worst three weeks' of his life. In 2020, Harper was also taken to hospital after he hit his head on the ground in a freak collision with Hobart Hurricanes player Nathan Ellis while playing for the Renegades in the Big Bash.

Warner was such an unknown he was listed as a right-hand batter by Channel 9 on his first on-screen graphic. He was also nearly run out for one in the first over. 42m ago 17.43 EST Has there been a more contentious cricketer in modern history? It has been impossible not to hold an opinion about David Warner at every stage throughout his extraordinary career. Moreover, for many of us that opinion has changed frequently and dramatically as the opener has repeatedly found himself at the centre of the action on and off the field. As the introduction to this Geoff Lemon piece from late 2022 demonstrates, in just one paragraph it’s easy to form many competing opinions of the man simultaneously. Over a long career, David Warner has presented many versions of himself. The short-form bludgeoner of his T20 debut in 2009 gave way to the studious opener of his first Test century on a Hobart greentop in 2011. The raucous presence known as The Bull who was suspended from the 2013 Ashes gave way to the contemplative Reverend by 2015, schooling teammates on the power of positive thinking, before returning to his most confrontational mode before the Ashes in 2017. The instigator of the sandpaper ball-tampering plot in 2018 served a year’s playing ban, ran the well-worn path of public redemption via on-field success, and has since presented himself as an elder statesman with an accordingly impeccable disciplinary record. Narrative spins in David Warner’s favour but that is to forget the reasons behind his ban | Geoff Lemon Read more 51m ago 17.34 EST It looks like there’ll be a decent crowd in early at the SCG, many of them presumably in attendance to salute the retiring David Warner. There is a long line of members, stretching back well past NRL HQ Day 4 @scg @fo pic.twitter.com/vsGeENT7Q7 — John C Moriarty (@JohnCMoriarty) January 5, 2024 55m ago 17.30 EST It is dry in Sydney today with temperatures in the low 20s, kept in check by an easterly breeze. No risk of rain or bad light pushing us into Sunday. The pitch proved treacherous yesterday with inconsistent bounce, plenty of turn, and frequent puffs of dust as the ball burst through the surface. Day 4️⃣ at the SCG #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/LSBr6EwMWx — 7Cricket (@7Cricket) January 5, 2024 1h ago 17.22 EST If you want to catch up on yesterday’s action, read all about it here: Josh Hazlewood sparks Pakistan collapse to reclaim momentum for Australia on day three Read more 1h ago 17.17 EST Preamble Jonathan Howcroft Hello everybody and welcome to day four of the third Test between Australia and Pakistan from the SCG. We’ll be underway in Sydney at 10am AEDT. It is almost certainly the final day’s play of the series, and with it, the final day in the Test career of David Warner. Josh Hazlewood’s late triple-wicket maiden yesterday evening means Australia are poised to complete a 3-0 series sweep, and be in a position to chair Warner from his home ground with the send-off he has long craved. Pakistan will resume on 68/7 – a lead of 82 – reliant on first innings heroes Mohammad Rizwan and Aamer Jamal to set Australia a troublesome total to chase. Anything over 100 could be nervy, anything over 200 challenging, on an uneven pitch that encouraged 15 wickets to fall on Friday. I’ll be around for the opening half of the day, and if we get much beyond lunch Geoff Lemon will take the reins. While I’m on, feel free to drop me an email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com . David Warner will bat for Australia for the final time in Test cricket today.

The Canadian men will be centre stage June 1 when they take on the U.S. at the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Dallas in the opening match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. And millions will be watching when Canada takes on India and Pakistan in subsequent Group A matches. \"That group pretty much has the most eyeballs,\" Zafar said. \"We couldn't have asked for a better group … That's huge for us.\" Also extremely challenging. India is currently ranked No. 1 in the world in the 20-over game while Pakistan is No. 4, Ireland No. 12 and Canada No. 20. Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. Playing the tournament opener is the icing on the cake for Zafar. The Canada-U. S. rivalry is considered the oldest in international cricket, given the two met in what is thought to be the first international cricket match in 1844, 33 years prior to England’s meeting against Australia. Canada won the two-innings match by 23 runs that day at the St. George’s Cricket Club in Manhattan. The West Indies, which is co-hosting the 55-game tournament with the U.S., opens June 2 against Papua New Guinea at the Guyana National Stadium. Led by Zafar, the Canadian men qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. Zafar, an all-rounder whose forte is as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, hopes the tournament will shine a spotlight on the Canadian team and inspire a new generation of cricketers back home. \"You couldn't ask for a better platform than the T20 World Cup,\" he said. Group B is made up of defending champion England, Australia, Namibia, Scotland and Oman. Group C consists of New Zealand, the West Indies, Afghanistan, Uganda and Papua New Guinea while Group D is South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Netherlands and Nepal. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Rivals India and Pakistan will face off June 9 in a 34,000-seat modular stadium some 50 kilometres east of downtown Manhattan in Nassau County. Eight matches will be played at the venue. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians leave at the end of the month for Hong Kong and then Nepal for pre-tournament camps ahead of a 50-over tournament in Dubai. They are scheduled to return in early March when they will turn their focus to the 20-over game. --- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.
