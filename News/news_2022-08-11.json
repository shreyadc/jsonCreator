Taylor, who is of Samoan heritage, describes racist locker room \"banter\" and casually racist comments from some New Zealand team officials. “Cricket in New Zealand is a pretty white sport,” Taylor writes in his book, entitled “Black & White.\" “For much of my career I’ve been an anomaly, a brown face in a vanilla line-up. That has its challenges, many of which aren’t readily apparent to your teammates or the cricketing public.” The 38-year-old Taylor said many people assumed he was of Maori or Indian heritage because Pacific Island representation in New Zealand cricket is so rare. He said locker room banter sometimes was racist and hurtful but he was concerned that raising the issue might make the situation worse. “In many ways dressing-room banter is the barometer,” Taylor writes. “A teammate used to tell me ‘you’re half a good guy Ross but which half is good? You don’t know what I’m referring to.’ I was pretty sure I did. “Other players also had to put up with comments that dwelt on their ethnicity. In all probability a (white New Zealander) listening to those sorts of comments would think ‘oh, that’s okay, it’s just a bit of banter.' “But he’s hearing it as white person and it’s not directed at people like him. So there’s no pushback; no one corrects them. “Then the onus falls on the targets. You wonder if you should pull them up but worry that you’ll create a bigger problem or be accused of playing the race card by inflating harmless banter into racism. It’s easier to develop a thick skin and let it slide, but is that the right thing to do?” Taylor says a former manager and coach of the New Zealand team made comments that were unintentionally racist. The manager told Taylor’s wife, Victoria, that in his experience players of Maori and Pacific Island heritage have problems managing money and offered his assistance. Taylor said former national coach Mike Hesson once told him ‘my cleaner’s Samoan. She’s a lovely lady, hard-working, very trustworthy.' “All I could say was ‘oh, cool,’ Taylor wrote. “I have no doubt that (the officials) and the guys who engaged in the ‘banter’ would be dismayed to learn that their remarks landed with a thud. “Let me be clear: I don’t think for one minute that they were coming from a racist perspective. I think they were insensitive and lacked the imagination and empathy to put themselves in the other person’s shoes. “What to them is a bit of harmless banter is actually confronting for the targets because it tells them they’re seen as being different. Instead of the message being ‘you’re one of us, mate,’ it is, in effect, ‘you’re one of them’.” A New Zealand Cricket spokesperson told the New Zealand Herald newspaper that the national body “deplores racism, is a staunch supporter of the New Zealand Human Rights Commission’s Give Nothing to Racism campaign and is deeply disappointed Ross has been exposed to this type of behavior.” ___ More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports The Associated Press","pubDate":"2022-08-10 22:59:57","image_url":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2022/08/20220810180856-62f43869cc7a4fb6fb926f32jpeg.jpg;w=960","source_id":"burnabynow","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“History Maker”: Will Smeed cricketer registers highest score in The Hundred after scoring first-ever century","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-history-maker-will-smeed-cricketer-registers-highest-score-in-the-hundred-after-scoring-first-ever-century/","keywords":["Cricket","Birmingham Phoenix","Southern Brave","The Hundred","Will Smeed"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Will Smeed cricketer: The rookie Birmingham Phoenix batter has become the first player to score a century in The Hundred.

The Hundred has received its first centurion in the form of rookie Birmingham Phoenix batter Will Smeed. It was during the eighth match of the second season of The Hundred between Birmingham Phoenix and Southern Brave at Edgbaston that Smeed managed to reach the three-figure mark to etch his name in history. Opening the batting with Chris Benjamin (17), Smeed hit the first ball of the match off George Garton for a boundary to get going. It was right after captain Moeen Ali’s (16) dismissal’s on the 36th delivery that Smeed took the onus upon himself to hit pacer James Fuller for consecutive boundaries. Attacking Garton again, Smeed hit him for a couple of sixes right before the halfway mark. It was on the 59th ball of the innings that Smeed hit spinner Jake Lintott for a six to complete a 25-ball half-century in Birmingham today. With batter Liam Livingstone (21) batting at a strike rate of 105, Smeed hit sixes off Fuller and Lintott before hitting Tymal Mills for a four and a six towards the end of the innings. It was on the penultimate delivery of the innings that Smeed ran a couple of runs off Brave pacer Chris Jordan to complete a 49-ball ton. Smeed, 20, scoring 101* (50) with the help of eight fours and six sixes at a strike rate of 202 came in a one-man show propelling Phoenix to 176/4 in their 100-ball quota. Smeed, who had made a name for himself whilst representing Quetta Gladiators in Pakistan Super League 2022, is yet to play first-class cricket. Smeed’s maiden T20 century has come in his 48th innings in the format. The right-handed batter has surpassed teammate Livingstone to register the highest individual score in The Hundred .

Kohli and a fit-again KL Rahul on Monday returned to a 15-member Indian squad for the Asia Cup scheduled to be held in Dubai and Sharjah from August 27 to September 11. Kohli is enduring his worst slump in form and has not scored a century in international cricket since November 2019. His last assignment was the England tour where he could manage just 76 runs from six innings across formats, which included the rescheduled fifth Test, two ODIs and as many T20s in July. The former skipper was rested for limited over West Indies tour and the upcoming ODIs against Zimbabwe. “It is unfortunate what Virat is going through right now at the moment, but he is a quality player,” said Jayawardene in the latest episode of The ICC Review show. “I believe Virat has the tools to come out of it (the form slump). He has done that in the past as well and I’m sure he’ll come through this. Class is permanent and form is temporary.” Rahul, who did not feature in the T20 series against the West Indies due to COVID-19 and then underwent a sports hernia surgery, will be back as vice-captain during the Asia Cup. Jayawardene feels lack of game time could be a problem for Rahul as he gears up for the tournament. “That (Rahul’s lack of cricket) would be a concern for India. He has been out for a little while since the IPL, so having game time is quite crucial especially out there in the middle. “The sooner he can get some game time and get that confidence back, the better. It will help him, as well as the national team.” The former Sri Lankan skipper feels India should go with a left-handed opener, preferably Rishabh Pant, with the right-handed Rohit Sharma in case Rahul doesn’t make an impressive return to the game. Pant had opened twice in T20Is against England in July. “Even though he (Pant) hasn’t done that (open the batting) much in domestic cricket, he has the capacity to do that. Wherever he bats, you’re not going to change his game. He is going to be a very natural player so yes, it is an option (for Pant to open).” —PTI   Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-08-10 18:32:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘We want to create our bench strength’: Team India skipper Rohit Sharma ahead of Asia Cup, World T20","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/08/11/we-want-to-create-our-bench-strength-team-india-skipper-rohit-sharma-ahead-of-asia-cup-world-t20/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: With cricket being played round the year, India captain Rohit Sharma feels having a solid bench strength is paramount, and the team is striving to build one with an eye on the future.

Since their shock group-stage elimination in the last T20 World Cup, India have been experimenting with their squads, with injury and workload management also playing a part in it. “We play lot of cricket, so there will be injuries and workload management, so we have to rotate players,” Rohit said on Star Sports show ‘Follow the Blues’. “But it gives our bench strength to go and play the game, which is why we could try so many other guys who are ready to take that international stage and perform,” he added. “We want to create our bench strength, we want to make sure that India’s future is in safe hands. That’s the planning that we are trying to have.” Rohit is now gearing up to lead India in the upcoming edition of the T20 showpiece in Australia, but before that, they have the Asia Cup to deal with. He said the objective should be to get better as a team everyday. “I don’t know what next to expect but for me particularly, it’s just about getting better every day as a team,” said Rohit. “No matter if you win or lose the series, that cannot take priority. What should take priority is if we are getting better as a team.” “The team’s goal is important and then obviously parts in it where the individuals come into play and play the role in the team’s success. But whatever the team is trying to do, the individuals need to buy into that thought process and work towards that direction.” While Rohit succeeded Virat Kohli as India’s all-format captain, India also had a new coach at the end of last year’s T20 World Cup, with Ravi Shastri making way for Rahul Dravid, who was the captain when Rohit made his ODI debut. Rohit spoke about the conversations they have had since taking over the reins of the Indian cricket team. “When he became the coach here, we met and sat together in a room for a while and decided how we want to take this team forward,” Rohit said. “He was pretty much on the same thought process as me. That made it easier for me to give out a clear message to the boys because the coach and captain always need to be on the same page for the team to move in the same direction.” “One thing we have decided and have in common is we want to send the right messages and we don’t want to create any confusion in the group.” “That’s something we spoke about and of course, we wanted to change the style of cricket as well. We wanted to play in a certain way in all three formats and he was ready to accept all of that,” Rohit said. —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-08-10 18:31:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Trent Boult released from New Zealand contract, wants to spend more time at home","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/08/10/trent-boult-released-from-new-zealand-contract-wants-to-spend-more-time-at-home/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"DUBAI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday expressed sadness at the sudden demise of former international umpire Rudi Koertzen.

The-73-year-old, who officiated in 331 international matches in a career stretching from 1992 to 2010, died in a car accident in South Africa on Tuesday. “Rudi was among the best umpires of his generation and one players had utmost respect for. He officiated in international games for close to two decades and the ICC relied on him for some big matches during this period,” ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said in a release. “Rudi was also very popular among his contemporaries and always willing to help. His contribution to cricket will be remembered for years to come. We send our condolences to his family and friends at his tragic death.” Koertzen was on his way back home from Cape Town after a weekend of golf when the fatal accident happened. Three others were also killed in the crash in Riversdale. One of the original members of the ICC Elite Panel of Umpires when it was formed in 2002, Koertzen is third in the list of Test umpires in terms of number of match appointments, having officiated in 108 matches. He is second in the list for ODIs with 209 matches and stood in 14 T20Is. Koertzen was the TV umpire for the finals of the World Cups of 2003 and 2007 and an on-field umpire for the finals of the ICC Champions Trophy tournaments in 2004 and 2006. He was also the fourth umpire for the final of the T20 World Cup 2010 in Bridgetown.

After the successful conduction of the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, wherein Women’s T20 Cricket was introduced for the first time ever, women Cricketers from different countries would now face each other while representing their respective franchises in ECB’s 100-ball tournament – ‘The Hundred’. With the men’s Hundred already underway, the Women’s Hundred is set to commence from tomorrow onwards, with the defending champions Oval Invincibles scheduled to take on Northern Superchargers in the tournament opener at the Kennington Oval in London. For the first time ever, women cricketers were drafted in the eight squads alongside the men, as The Hundred Overseas Wildcard Draft aimed at bringing gender parity into the sport. Resultantly, 16 additional cricketers from seven countries were selected during the process in June this year, including the Indian all-rounder Deepti Sharma. As against five Indian women cricketers last time around, the second edition of The Hundred will feature only three Indian players plying their trades for their respective franchises. The Southpaw star opener will once again represent the Southern Brave for the second successive season of The Hundred. Apart from Mandhana, Australia’s Tahlia McGrath, Molly Strano and Amanda-Jade Wellington are the other overseas players in the Braves’ squad this season. Mandhana will take the field brimming with confidence after her exploits in the Commonwealth Games, where she finished the championship as the third-highest run-scorer, with a couple of half-centuries. She is likely to open the innings alongside England’s Danni Wyatt. Akin Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues too would play for Northern Superchargers for the second successive season. Jemimah’s performance last year was one of the talking points of the season, as she emerged as the highest run-getter for the Superchargers, and the tournament’s second-highest run-scorer overall.

These are the big four teams dominating cricket left, right and centre. Pakistan blows hot and cold. Bangladesh threatened a meteoric rise but failed to live up to any expectations. Sri Lanka looks like staging a comeback, but the question of whether they'll ever be able to come close to the Sangakara era remains. Afghanistan is relatively new. They have the passion, hunger and a quality side that can upset big teams. But that's that. Nothing more. That brings us down to the West Indies. The good old West Indies add flavour to an otherwise dull cricketing recipe. Big hits, outrageous celebrations, a strong attitude, resilience, an in-your-face style of play and many other qualities define the West Indies team of today. Cricket, as with all other sports in the world, needs to sell tickets at the end of the day. The T20 format, so to say, is the money spinner for the game, and West Indies boasts of the biggest superstars of the game. To put things in perspective, Caribbean players are the soul of T20 cricket. , BBL or PSL - they are everywhere and performing. But the irony is that West Indies - the two-time T20 champions, find themselves playing qualification matches for the T20 World Cup down-under. Players like Russell, Narine, and more are either unavailable for selection or playing franchise cricket. One can't blame them. The monetary aspect of it all is hard to ignore. But so is the sorry state of West Indies cricket. It is almost jittery to think that the island nation once ruled the world of cricket. The importance of everything coming together for the West Indies cannot be overstated. The world of cricket needs them to return. Oh, how the mighty have fallen, and taken with it, the very soul of the game. The competition. The world doesn't need the Marshalls or the Garners. They just need the existing ones to come together and play as one. Play as men in maroon.

While Ngarava remained unbeaten on 34* (27), Nyauchi was bowled by Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman after scoring 26 (31). The duo hitting a combined total of nine fours and two sixes between them pushed Zimbabwe to 151 in 32.2 overs in a 257-run chase. It was in the 24th over itself that Ngarava cleared his intentions by hitting Bangladesh spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz for two fours and a six. In the last five overs before their partnership was brought to a halt, Ngarava and Nyauchi hit at least one boundary to not give up in spite of a miraculous task lying in front of them. A 105-run victory was Bangladesh’s joint 15th biggest win (by runs) overall, seventh biggest against Zimbabwe, joint sixth highest away from home, third biggest in Zimbabwe and second biggest in Harare in the history of ODIs. 10th wicket partnership record in ODI history S.

Only the eighth bilateral T20I series (second in West Indies) between West Indies and New Zealand, it will be played some 20 months after their last encounter in this format. While West Indies have won a lone bilateral T20I series against New Zealand, the Kiwis have registered four series wins in the past. Readers must note that West Indies’ last bilateral T20I series win against this opposition had come a decade ago. Having last hosted international cricket in January this year, Jamaica will be hosting a T20I after more than half-a-decade. With the venue hosting only three T20Is till date, there aren’t a lot of T20I records regarding this venue and players taking part in this series. Been part of all the three Jamaica T20Is in the past, West Indies have won two and lost one match at this venue. New Zealand, on the other hand, will be playing their first-ever T20I here on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Raiphi received another boost when he was offered the role of chief coach of the Puducherry Ranji Trophy team. A former Kerala captain, Raiphi played a few matches for Puducherry and helped the side to qualify for the elite group before ending his first-class career. After his retirement, Raiphi dabbled into cricket coaching even though he kept the link with Puducherry cricket as one of its selectors for the last two seasons. Now as a chief coach, Raiphi is keen to bring a difference to the young side which will be playing in the elite division this season. \"More than the results, I am keener on the process of making Puducherry a good side. It is an evolving side and naturally, the progression is more important than the results. More than the short-term success I am looking at the holistic development of the side,'' said Raiphi, who will be making his debut as the coach of a senior team. “After retiring as a player three years ago, I was involved in coaching. I was mentoring a lot of young players and was also acting as a consultant for various cricket academies across the State. I was also one of the coaches at the Rajasthan Royals High-Performance Centre. “However, this is my first job as a full-time coach of a senior team. It is a new challenge but having been associated with Puducherry cricket for the last three years, I know the vision and dreams and I am comfortable working with the association,” he added. “Though it is a new association, Puducherry already has excellent infrastructure and other allied facilities. They have a good league structure and there are enough tournaments for the players to gain exposure. It has got a T10, T20, and 50 overs league. So it is only a matter of time for players to make their mark and soon we will be having more local players representing Puducherry in the Ranji Trophy,’‘ Raiphi signed off.

After the concept became a hit in countries like India, Australia and England, even South Africa and UAE have gone ahead with new franchise T20 leagues of their own. IPL franchise owners control majority of the teams in the two leagues. The abundance of franchise cricket has meant that players from around the world are getting a chance to play in multiple lucrative T20 leagues. However, active Indian players have so far not been allowed to play in any of the foreign leagues. Former Indian cricket team captain Sunil Gavaskar , in his column for Sportstar, touched upon the issue of the unavailability of Indian players in foreign leagues. \"Some overseas former players have said that the Indian players should be allowed to play the Big Bash or the Hundred. Basically, they want their leagues to have more sponsorship etc. They are concerned about their cricket, which is totally understandable,\" Gavaskar wrote. \"But when Indian cricket looks to protect its cricket by ensuring that their players stay fresh for their matches and thus restricting them from playing overseas, that is not acceptable to the guys from the 'old powers'. They are talking only about the Indian players being made available for their country's leagues but not the support staff or others who also can do a wonderful job as the cricketing world has found out over the last half dozen years or so.\" He added that Indian players might be allowed to play in foreign leagues, especially in the UAE and SA T20 leagues, because majority of the teams there are owned by Indian enterprises Promoted \"The limit on what the players can earn and the small change as prize money makes the bigger fees and big prize money at the UAE and South African leagues a more attractive proposition,\" he wrote. \"The composition of the teams in these two new leagues is mainly the franchises that have teams in the IPL and hence the media in the 'old powers' has started blaming the IPL. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has nothing to do with these leagues but in all probability may allow some Indian players to play there. Of course, India will be playing international matches during this time and the cream of talent in Indian cricket will be playing for India and not in these leagues. Their franchises, though, may want them to play the odd game if there is a gap between the international matches.\"","pubDate":"2022-08-10 13:47:38","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/414oee78_sunil-gavaskar-pti-650_650x400_08_March_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies vs New Zealand 1st T20I Live Telecast Channel name in India and USA: When and where to watch WI vs NZ Jamaica T20I?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1st-t20i-live-telecast-channel-name-in-india-and-usa-when-and-where-to-watch-wi-vs-nz-jamaica-t20i/","keywords":["Cricket","New Zealand","New Zealand tour of West Indies 2022","West Indies"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"West Indies vs New Zealand 1st T20I Live Telecast: The SportsRush presents before you the timing and live streaming details of 1st WI vs NZ T20I.

This was Gulbarga side’s first win in the competition as even a five-wicket haul for D. Avinash wasn’t enough to get the Strikers over the line. Batting first, Shivamogga Strikers lost Stallin Hoover off the second delivery of the innings, before Rohan Kadam and Siddharth thwarted Gulbarga Mystics’ attack. Both Rohan and Siddharth were watchful to start with, before picking up the pace, just after the powerplay, with the spinners being taken to the cleaners briefly. Rohan scored 53 from 41 deliveries, smashing three boundaries and two sixes while Siddharth at the other end also added 53 from 51 balls, collecting four boundaries and a six during his stay. The duo put on a solid 108-run stand to not only steady the ship but also laid the platform for a flourish in the final overs of the innings. However, B.R. Sharath (9), R. Smaran (3) failed to capitalise, leaving captain K. Gowtham (23) and D. Avinash (20) to do some heavy lifting, with four sixes between the two of them.  For Gulbarga, C.A. Karthik picked 3 wickets as the Strikers posted 175/8. In response, the Mystics got off to a quick start with Devdutt Padikkal holding down one end while Jeswath Acharya went on the attack. Padikkal was the first to depart for 9 in the 5th over, after which Jeswath and Rohan Patil went about building the innings. However, Jeswath could not kick on and was dismissed for 30 from 17 deliveries. Rohan Patil managed to add 28 to the cause before captain Manish Pandey and Krishnan Shrijith stitched together a 32-run stand before the latter made the walk back to the pavilion. While Manish was around the Mystics had every chance of making the chase, but he lost another partner soon as Manoj Bhandage was sent back for 5. And a few deliveries later, Bangalore Mohith followed suit for 1, leaving the Mystics in a spot of bother. In the 18th over, Manish completed his fifty, with the game on a knife edge. But right after, there was another a twist as Manish was dismissed for 50 from 36 deliveries. However, Ritesh Bhatkal wasn’t giving in and the equation came down to 4 needed in the final over. C.A. Karthik finished off the game with a boundary, giving the Mystics a much-needed win. Brief Scores — Shivamogga Strikers: 175/8 in 20 overs (Rohan Kadam 53, Siddharth 53, Karthik CA 3/30, V. Kaverappa 2/48) lost by 3 wickets against Gulbarga Mystics: 177/7 in 19.1 overs (Manish Pandey 50, Jeswath Acharya 30, D. Avinash 5/40, Rajvir Wadhwa 1/8). Hubli Tigers defeat Bengaluru Blasters The Hubli Tigers’ captain Abhimanyu Mithun was in fine touch last evening, playing with panache, as he hammered 51*off 22 deliveries to lead his side over the line by 4 wickets against the Bengaluru Blasters, by the VJD method. Just when all seemed lost, Mithun stepped up to the plate with an innings that will be long remembered in the history of Karnataka cricket. Abhimanyu Mithun of Hubli Tigers in action against Bengaluru Blasters yesterday. Put into bat first, the Bengaluru Blasters lost L.R. Chethan in the second over, before captain Mayank Agarwal took charge, along with K.V. Aneesh. The duo put on a quick 18-run stand before Aneesh departed for 14. Mayank had Suraj Ahuja (20) for company and even though they found it tough to get the momentum going against the Hubli bowling, they put on 45 crucial runs, to give the Blasters a solid platform at the midway stage. Mayank by now was starting to get his strokes going and it could have spelt danger for Hubli, who though pegged the Blasters back with the wicket of Aniruddha Joshi (8). Restricted by the regular fall of wickets, the captain looked to up the ante but fell for 43, just as the team’s 100 was approaching. J. Suchith (12*) and Shivkumar Rakshith (15*) added a crucial 25 runs before rain forced an early close of the first innings. For the Tigers, Saurabh Srivastav picked a couple of wickets as the Blasters managed 119/5 in 16 overs. Chasing 137 in 16 overs, the Tigers had a quiet start, much like the trend so far in the tournament, losing Luvnith Sisodia (6), Liyan Khan (6) and Tushar Singh (0) in the first three overs of the innings. B.U. Shiva Kumar and Shishir Bhavane (16) steadied the ship over the next few overs, before the latter was dismissed looking to score quickly in the 7th over with the score on 48. Shiva Kumar was the next to depart for 30, which meant the Tigers had lost half their side. Sagar Solanki then added 13 more to the cause, keeping his side in the mix in what was turning out to be a thriller. But that’s when captain Abhimanyu Mithun got into the act and clobbered a couple of sixes in the 13th over, relieving some pressure for the Tigers. Mithun continued to hammer the bowling, as the crowds cheered on. The Tigers skipper smashed 51 off 22 deliveries, hitting five sixes and two boundaries. Mithun finished off the chase with a boundary. Brief Scores — Bengaluru Blasters: 119/5 in 16 overs (Mayank Agarwal 43, Suraj Ahuja 20, Saurabh Srivastav 2/31) lost by 4 wickets against Hubli Tigers: 139/6 (Abhimanyu Mithun 51*, B.U.

India have tried several opening partners with Rohit in the T20 format, with the recent ones being Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav. Jayawardene said that India always tries to bring in the next generation of cricketers, and he said that Rishabh Pant can be an option to open with Rohit in the Asia Cup. He said that Pant has the capacity to do that. “India is always trying to bring that next generation of cricketers,” Mahela Jayawardene on the ICC Review Podcast. “The Zimbabwe tour is a good opportunity for those guys to get a hit out there. (On Pant opening the innings) It is an option, even though he hasn’t done much in domestic cricket. But he has the capacity to do that.” Rohit bats, Rishabh watches #TeamIndia | #WIvIND | @ImRo45 | @RishabhPant17 pic.twitter.com/1twNyIrvhF — BCCI (@BCCI) August 5, 2022 Although, KL Rahul is back in the side, and he is certain to open with Rohit, but India can take a punt with Rishabh to maintain the left-right combination. He recently opened in the T20Is against England as well. It is interesting to note that Pant boasts some great numbers as an opener on the domestic circuit. In 2018, Rishabh Pant scored the 2nd fastest century in the history of T20 cricket, where he completed his century in just 32 balls. As an opener, he smashed 116 runs in 38 balls against Himachal Pradesh while playing for Delhi.

The fact that the selectors can field two or even three squads at once is a testament to the kind of depth and reserves the country boasts of. Although the team is making massive strides every match, the fact remains that the transition period isn't far as and are clearly towards the end of their careers, at least in the limited-overs set-up. Don't be surprised if their journey from the 2023 ODI World Cup to the 2024 T20 World Cup turns out to be their last dance, their swansong. Their impending retirement from the game warrants a question - Is Team India ready for a life without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. From the looks of it, the team has plenty of options, as , , Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan, Sanju Samson and probably many more are raring to get hold of the brass ring and take it to places it has never been. However, what Rohit and Virat bring to the table is far more than batsmanship. It's their leadership and experience that make them invaluable. The batters mentioned above have all the qualities to be world beaters, to be the next big thing in Indian cricket, and when the time finally comes, they will be. It has always been the case. took on the baton from Sunil Gavaskar, and Virat and Rohit took it from the master blaster. When these two finally ride into the sunset, the vacuum created would be of a level not seen before. The only thing would be the way they'll be treated when they finally hang their boots. The number of trolls, criticism, and hate these two have faced for some time now has been on a whole other level. Everyone is replaceable. The Kishans, the Gaikwads, and the Shaws will take care of cricket. But, there is a greater story at play here. A story greater than cricket. Team India may be ready for life after Kohli and Rohit, but their treatment towards the fag end of their careers will govern the future of Indian cricket, and fans, as they have always been, will be at the centre of it all.","pubDate":"2022-08-10 11:21:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Manjrekar Explains Why \"Avesh Is Slightly Behind\" Arshdeep In T20 WC Race","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sanjay-manjrekar-explains-why-avesh-is-slightly-behind-arshdeep-in-t20-wc-race-3242801","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Indian cricket team player Sanjay Manjrekar has now given his opinion on the two young pacers, who comewith different skillsets.","content":"With the announcement of India's Asia Cup T20I squad, there is enough indication about the players who will be closely watched going into the T20 World Cup.

The fast bowler, who has picked up 317 wickets in Tests, 169 wickets in ODIs, and 62 scalps in T20Is for New Zealand, had several conversations with the national board before the two said parties reached an agreement. Boult, who is currently ranked No. 1 in the ICC ODI bowlers' rankings, said it has been a \"really tough decision\" but \"the time is right to move into this next phase\". \"I still have a big desire to represent my country and feel I have the skills to deliver at the international level. However, I respect the fact that not having a national contract will affect my chances of selection. Ultimately this decision is about my wife Gert and our three young boys,\" Boult was quoted in the press release, as saying. \"Family has always been the biggest motivator for me and I feel comfortable with putting it first and preparing ourselves for life after cricket.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Trent Boult (@trrrent_) Still have big desire to represent New Zealand, says Trent BoultBoult, who made his international debut in 2011, is aware that the move will diminish his chances of playing for the New Zealand cricket team. \"I still have a big desire to represent my country and feel I have the skills to deliver at the international level. However, I respect the fact that not having a national contract will affect my chances of selection. \"Having said that, as a fast bowler I know I have a limited career span, and I feel the time is right to move into this next phase,\" added Boult, who has represented the BlackCaps over 200 times across formats. Meanwhile, NZC said it respected Boult's decision. \"We respect Trent's position. He's been completely honest and up-front with us about his reasoning and, while we're sad to be losing him as a fully-contracted player, he leaves with our best wishes and our sincere thanks. \"Trent's made a massive contribution to the BLACKCAPS since his Test debut in late 2011 and is now considered one of the best multi-format cricketers in the world. We're very proud of what he's achieved. \"We've had several conversations and I know Trent understands that, in terms of selection, NZC will continue to make a priority of those players with either central or domestic contracts,\" said chief executive David White. Boult, who has been a regular face in the Indian Premier League (IPL), likely earns far less than those from the other bigger cricketing nations. As of now, he only plays for the Indian T20 league but is clearly looking to change that. Boult has picked up 92 wickets in 78 games in the IPL across eight seasons, having represented Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Mumbai Indians (MI), and Delhi Capitals (DC).

In a written statement, Lanning laid emphasis on wanting to spend time focusing on herself after a “busy couple of years”. Lanning, who leads Australia across formats, has been arguably the best captain in Women’s cricket powering her team to victories in three T20I World Cups, one ODI World Cup and one Commonwealth Games. “After a busy couple of years, I’ve made the decision to take a step back to enable me to spend time focusing on myself. I’m grateful for the support of CA [Cricket Australia] and my teammates and ask that my privacy is respected during this time,” read Lanning’s statement. Obsessed?

Second-highest run-scorer in the format, it goes without saying that Lanning has had a significant amount of workload at the highest level of late. “We’re proud of Meg for acknowledging that she needs a break and will continue to support her during this time,” Shawn Flegler, Cricket Australia’s head of performance, women’s cricket, said in a statement. Although because of contrasting reasons, Lanning, 30, has become the second high-profile cricketer today after New Zealand Men’s fast bowler Trent Boult to take a break amid a peaking career. One of the reasons for Boult to forgo his central contract with NZC (New Zealand Cricket) was to spend time with his family . On the other hand, not a lot is known about Lanning’s personal life. With no news ever erupting with respect to her marriage, it is safe to assume that Lanning is unmarried. Additionally, there’s no information or social media post about her dating life either.","pubDate":"2022-08-10 10:08:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The Spin | Buttler’s service in ODIs spoiled by injuries and overstuffed schedule","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/10/buttlers-service-in-odis-cricket-spoiled-by-injuries-and-overstuffed-schedule","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Tim de Lisle"],"video_url":null,"description":"England’s new white-ball captain also hasn’t done himself many favours by multi-tasking and sticking with Jason RoyWelcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter.

To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below: One day a book will be written about the crazy world of cricket administration in the early 21st century. A fair chunk of it will be devoted to the domestic scene in England, where the men in suits seriously expect fans to follow four different formats at the same time – and the poor old players are like the staff of a 24-hour supermarket. One chapter could home in on a single month in the life of England’s players: July 2022. A month when they were required to play a deciding Test against one of cricket’s superpowers, India, followed by four white-ball series in 25 days. A series a week! Lunacy, thy name is ECB. An overstuffed schedule is like long Covid, a malaise with tentacles. This particular idiocy – not all the board’s fault, as it was partly a knock-on from India flouncing out of that fifth Test last year – led Ben Stokes to retire from 50-over internationals. The man who did most to win the World Cup for England, after Eoin Morgan, won’t be there to defend it. De Kock dazzles before rain ruins England v South Africa ODI decider Read more It also gave Jos Buttler a nightmare start as England’s white-ball captain following Morgan’s abrupt retirement. Those four series in 25 days were Buttler’s first four as official captain. The thing about a baptism of fire is that you only have to face it once. Buttler – along with Matthew Mott, the new coach, who had only come up against the Netherlands – had to get through four of them. No wonder he lost three series and drew the other one. In a tight corner like that, you need your big guns firing. Buttler had to manage without England’s top four one-day international bowlers – Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood (all injured) and Adil Rashid (on leave for the first six games, making a pilgrimage to Mecca). Reece Topley rose to the challenge so well that he may well keep his place even when Woakes and Wood return, but the other seamers, bar Chris Jordan, looked like the second-stringers they are. Jason Roy walks off after losing his wicket against South Africa in their T20 match in Cardiff Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images The batting was powerful on paper, with a reunion of the so-called fab five – Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Stokes and Buttler. But three of them (the middle three) were knackered from playing four Tests in five weeks. Stokes’s style of play is sheer electricity, which burns a lot of fuel. The one-day specialists, Roy and Buttler, struggled too, on sticky pitches. And here Buttler, who deserves every sympathy on most of these fronts, made two miscalculations. One was his handling of Roy, so out of form it was painful to watch. This was like when Roy played his only Test series, the 2019 Ashes. He was all bottom hand, timing the ball so badly that his opponents may well have wanted to keep him in. Even his strike rate went to pieces, plummeting from 130 to 80. Roy was doing all he could to be dropped and England had a ready-made replacement in Phil Salt. But Buttler opted to show faith, even when it was clearly of the blind variety. There will be advantages to that, as others feel more secure when they have a bad trot. And it’s great that we have moved on from the bad old days of Alec Bedser and two-flops-and-you’re-out. But this wasn’t doing the team, or Roy, any good. Stokes and Brendon McCullum are taking the same approach with Zak Crawley in the Test side. He at least isn’t painful to watch: a Crawley innings is lovely while it lasts, which is usually around half an hour. And he did make a vital 46 in his last Test knock , laying the platform for Bairstow’s latest rip-roaring run chase. But the bottom line is that Crawley is unlikely to make it as a Test opener because he keeps steering the seamer’s stock ball to second slip. ‘I just would have felt like an impostor’: Morgan confirms England retirement Read more Buttler’s other mis-step was something that often trips up a captain: his handling of himself. He opted to carry on opening the batting for the Twenty20 team. And why not, you may ask – as an opener for Rajasthan Royals, he’s a superstar. Yes, but he’s not the captain there. He’s not even the keeper. And doing all three jobs well is almost impossible. Just ask Alec Stewart, who tried it for England in 1998-99. In 20 games as captain-keeper-opener, culminating in a calamitous World Cup, Stewart averaged only 18 rather than his usual 40. He was often fluent, especially batting second, when his eye was already in and he’d got the measure of the pitch. But he seldom lasted long, because he needed a breather. Exactly the same thing kept happening to Buttler last month. When England needed a captain’s innings, he could offer only a cameo. In Stewart’s time there wasn’t another English keeper who could score fast. These days there are three – Bairstow, Sam Billings and Salt (who keeps for Manchester Originals, ahead of Buttler, his captain there). It’s blindingly obvious that the roles need sharing out: Bairstow has to open, or keep, or both, freeing Buttler to be the boss and either an explosive opener or, more realistically, an expert finisher – like MS Dhoni with added smiles. Even a decade into their careers, with a World Cup winner’s medal on each man’s mantelpiece, there’s still a whiff of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard about Buttler and Bairstow. In another 10 years’ time, they’ll probably be managing mid-table counties.","pubDate":"2022-08-10 10:00:13","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c349fdb504485a82ebc2a8e4cee012739b707ab/0_42_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8dc1b17091dfe7ded4aa2ce18bec425","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
