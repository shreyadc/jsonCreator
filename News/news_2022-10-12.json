Matthew Pavlich has a solution.","content":"* Matthew Pavlich is a Nine sports presenter and co-founder of PickstarIt is said that respect is earned, honesty appreciated, trust gained and loyalty is returned. This is true in life, as much as it is in sport.And as the clock ticks to the end of the AFL player trading period on Wednesday, we are seeing the loyalty aspect of the aforementioned quote being played out in front of our eyes. Or the lack of it. READ MORE: Live coverage of AFL trade periodREAD MORE: Roos backlash as tradition dumpedREAD MORE: $1m-a-season megastar locks in new club﻿It seems more than ever, young AFL players who get drafted from interstate are requesting trades back home. Last year's number one draft pick, Jason Horne-Francis, is returning to South Australia to play with Port Adelaide after just one season at the Kangaroos. His trade is part of a four-team, mega-deal that is being described as the biggest in league history.Twenty-two-year-old Izak Rankine is also going home to South Australia, signing with the Adelaide Crows from Gold Coast, while Tanner Bruhn, the first overall pick in the draft back in 2020, is headed from Greater Western Sydney to his hometown Geelong. And there is Luke Jackson who returns to Perth to play with the Dockers after three seasons and a premiership with the Demons.It begs the question, why are clubs struggling to retain interstate draftees? Is there a systemic problem? Or perhaps it simply comes down to personal situations and that little thing called COVID-19 that separated people for long periods over the past three years. That being said, it does hint at a bigger problem with the current draft age. For me, it has always been too young. Several younger players have had issues settling into their new surroundings and accepting the challenges of being away from their families, friends and familiar environments. Is the draft pulling them into a career too early in their own personal journey?Now that the AFL is through the pandemic and has signed a new $4.5 billion media rights deal to set up the long-term success of the game, it is time to review and potentially remodel the grass roots and feeder system.With this player exodus, all the great things that come with being loyal and committing yourself to one cause, one group of people, one team is being forgotten. It is being undervalued.My own playing career is perhaps contradictory to this more common trend of players beginning their careers interstate, but eventually returning home. I was an interstate draftee from South Australia to Western Australia as a 17-year-old. It was tough, I missed home terribly and struggled to assimilate early in my career to an elite AFL environment. It was lonely and I longed for the end of the season to get back and see family and friends. Meeting new people at uni and away from the game helped, but I went through plenty of soul searching and had times where I thought it was all too hard.There were opportunities to move home to either the Crows or Power at the end of my first contract in 2002, but ultimately, I decided I had unfinished business at Fremantle. Later offers also came from Carlton, Collingwood and the Gold Coast, but again it just didn't quite feel right. We all have our reasons for staying or going. For me, it was about finishing what I started and seeing it through with my teammates and the broader Docker brethren. Besides missing out on an elusive premiership, there is so much I am grateful for staying at the one club. That loyalty I showed, is still being returned to me in spades. It was hard and stressful and challenging, but I had an amazing career and will be forever thankful of the experiences of being drafted interstate.For players, the trade period is about opportunity and getting some control over their own destiny. On average, an AFL player has about five years on a list. Careers are short and it makes sense to try and maximise their opportunity while they can.For fans, it's about the possibility that comes with a new season - or the nerves induced by a top star leaving town. Just like in soccer's transfer market or the big money drafts and trade windows in the NBA, NFL or franchise cricket, the conversation drives interest and attention, with everyone in the sport aiming to capitalise. From the club's perspective, it is a chance to continue to contend at the top of the ladder or begin to rebuild. But losing these youngsters so soon after using high draft picks to get them, brings its own frustrations with player development and team plans being derailed. This year's trading has seen some massive contracts being offered to younger players. An offer of more than five years - for any player - let alone a 19 or 20-year-old is too much. It makes players too comfortable, not incentivising them to push and do the work required to stay at the top and keep improving. This is a complicated situation but the league will know it has to give and take - to find the right trade-offs - if it is to find a balance that works for the game as a whole.We're talking here about teenagers under immense public scrutiny. It can be a lot to go through when the family, friends and support are hundreds of miles away. But they should also be aware of the good that comes with staying loyal and seeing it through.For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!","pubDate":"2022-10-11 23:20:33","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/10/459451/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Marsh rules himself out of captaincy","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/marsh-rules-himself-out-of-captaincy/video/a18e5f165928d49253df506187e34f3e","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: All rounder Mitchell Marsh has ruled himself out of ODI captaincy for Australia.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-11 22:45:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Crucial days loom in Warner leadership ban","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/crucial-days-loom-in-warner-leadership-ban-c-8520215","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey and Alex Mitchell"],"video_url":null,"description":"David Warner's leadership ban will be back on the agenda ahead of two days of meetings between Cricket Australia bosses in Hobart.","content":"David Warner could learn this week if he stands any chance of overturning his leadership ban as two days of meetings between cricket's powerbrokers loom. Warner's ban is likely to be discussed at Thursday's annual general meeting with the states, and is again expected to be a talking point at a Cricket Australia (CA) board meeting on Friday. The veteran's leadership status will be one of several talking points, in tandem with Australia's next men's one-day captain following Aaron Finch's retirement. TV rights negotiations are also likely to be on the agenda, with the current deal up after the 2023-24 summer, while a new pay deal for players is also due next year. In addition, officials must determine whether Australia will play Afghanistan in three ODIs next March, after CA last year made their concerns clear about facing the nation while it remains under Taliban rule. Two vacancies must also be filled on the CA board. Cricket Victoria chairman David Maddocks favoured to replace the outgoing Mel Jones, while Michelle Tredenick has also resigned. But it is the status of Warner and his lifetime leadership ban that will draw the most attention out of the high-powered Hobart meetings. Warner has repeatedly stated this year that he wants to talk with CA over the matter, after he was handed the ban in the wake of the 2018 ball-tampering affair. Only one director, John Harnden, remains from that time. He is up for re-election this week. Finch and Test captain Pat Cummins have voiced their opinion that Warner should be able to hold a leadership position again, while his case will also be helped by his return to the Big Bash. Players have said Warner remains an informal leader in the national set-up, with Mitch Marsh declaring as much earlier this week. \"I love Davey, certainly batting with him over the last 18 months, spending a lot of time with him, we've become great mates off the field,\" Marsh said on Tuesday. \"He's certainly got a lot of energy around our team, brings everyone together, books golf for everyone. \"He's actually our team manager, people probably don't know that. He's a great leader among our group. \"As far as all the (Cricket Australia) decisions go, I certainly steer clear of all those conversations. But he's a great man to have in the squad.\" Warner would shape as a potential option for the one-day captaincy or vice-captaincy if his ban is lifted, but the process would not be straightforward before the next game in the format on November 17. If CA's board do opt to consider going down that path, they will need to rewrite their own code of conduct which does not allow for a player to appeal a punishment once it has been handed down. Consultation would also be required with newly appointed ethics commissioner Dr Simon Longstaff, who led the cultural review into CA following the sandpaper-gate scandal.","pubDate":"2022-10-11 21:01:58","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8520215/00326d8fc7a6b1592e1e1a637ec54cbedf059c7d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jammu Zone lifts U-19 boys Inter-Zonal Cricket title","link":"https://www.thenorthlines.com/jammu-zone-lifts-u-19-boys-inter-zonal-cricket-title/","keywords":["Jammu","Sports"],"creator":["Northlines"],"video_url":null,"description":"NL Correspondent Jammu, Oct 11: Getting the better of Gandhi Nagar Zone by 30 runs in the summit clash, Jammu Zone lifted the title trophy of the Under-19 boys Inter- Zonal Cricket Tournament, organised by the Department of Youth Services and Sports, District Jammu at Khel Gaon, near here today.

After hectic parleys and back-channel discussions in the past one week, it was decided that the 67-year-old from Bengaluru would be the 36th BCCI president. Jay Shah, son of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, will continue as BCCI secretary for his second consecutive term. Shah is also expected to replace Ganguly as India’s representative at the all powerful ICC Board. “An influential minister in the central government played a key role in deciding the positions in the Board set up,” a BCCI source told PTI. Binny, though, is a surprise choice to head the BCCI. However, hints were dropped that his name will crop up for some position when Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) named him as its representative at BCCI AGM instead of secretary Santosh Menon. “Roger is one of the finest human beings and a thorough gentleman, who has graced the field for India. Plus he is also a World Cup hero and has a squeaky clean image. He had resigned from selection committee as his son Stuart back then was in contention to be in Indian team,” said another BCCI source. “He is the right choice for the job,” the source added. The only Congressman in the BCCI cabinet is Rajeev Shukla, who will continue as vice president. Sports minister Anurag Thakur’s younger brother Arun Singh Dhumal, who is currently the treasurer, will now become IPL chairman, replacing Brijesh Patel. Influential Maharashtra BJP leader Ashish Shelar will be the new treasurer which means that he won’t become Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president. He was supposed to take up the role with support from Sharad Pawar faction. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s close aide Devajit Saikia will replace Jayesh George as the new joint secretary. Binny will officially take charge of BCCI on October 18 at the AGM in Mumbai. There won’t be any election to any post as all candidates will be chosen unopposed. All the people in the fray, including Shah, Shukla are in Mumbai and will file nomination papers on Tuesday. Whether BCCI will contest for the ICC chairmanship hasn’t been decided as yet. The medium pacer was one of the architects of India’s historic World Cup triumph in 1983. In eight games, he took 18 wickets, the highest in that edition of prestigious tournament. Ganguly, who reached Mumbai on Monday evening, had a lot of meetings with the powers that be in New Delhi. Ganguly was keen to continue as BCCI president but he was told that there is no precedence of giving a second term to the Board chief. “Sourav was offered IPL chairmanship but he politely declined the offer. His logic was that he cannot accept becoming head of a sub-committee in BCCI after heading the same institution,” the BCCI source said. Binny is a rather surprise choice to head the BCCI. However, hints were dropped that he will get some position when Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) named him as its representative at BCCI AGM instead of secretary Santosh Menon. “Roger is one of the finest human beings and a thorough gentleman, who has graced the field for India.

Surprisingly only 18 players have made it to the main list which is two less than what was announced last year. The total number of players who have been extended a contract has gone up from 27 to 30 as compared to last year. Surprisingly two of their mainstays Dawid Malan and are missing out. Roy has continued to remain in a rough patch and it was almost certain that he would miss out. As far as Malan is concerned, things have been pretty weird. The left-handed batter had broken back in the Test squad when the last contracts were announced but as of now, he finds himself on the sidelines. Roy, on the other hand, has been extremely poor and as of now, he averages 24.20 in ODIs and 19.04 in T20s. In his previous six appearances for England, Roy managed to score just 78 odd runs. Things look pretty bleak for Malan too as he still is not England's choice for the 50-over format. Apart from Malan and Roy, Surrey opener Rory Burns too has been ignored by the cricket board. English wicketkeeper-batsman Ben Foakes has earned his first central contract owing to a spectacular show in the English summer against sides like New Zealand, South Africa, and India. The prolific batter Liam Livingstone has made it to the main list for the first time. The other player now without a deal is , who retired from international cricket in June. The English Cricket Board has also shown a lot of faith in speedster Jofra Archer and have continued to feature him on their main list despite a prolonged elbow injury. The number of increment contracts has increased from four to six, but players like Chris Jordan, Tom Curran, and Dom Bess haven't received any kind of ECB deal. David Willey has been added to the list and features the likes of Harry Brook, Matthew Potts, and Reece Topley. Each one of them have earned their first central contract. The omission of Malan and Jordan have come as a surprise as they continue to feature in the white ball games in almost every format. Surprisingly both are a part of England's T20 World Cup squad that is stationed in Australia as of now.","pubDate":"2022-10-11 17:56:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Bolo Tara Ra ra”: VVS Laxman credits Shikhar Dhawan for building camaraderie among Indian cricketers","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-bolo-tara-ra-ra-vvs-laxman-credits-shikhar-dhawan-for-building-camaraderie-among-indian-cricketers/","keywords":["Cricket","India","Shikhar Dhawan","South Africa","South Africa tour of India 2022","vvs laxman"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"VVS Laxman credits Shikhar Dhawan: The former Indian batter uploaded a behind the scenes video of India’s celebratory dance.

Dhawan, who is asked to lead in ODIs in the absence of first-choice players in this day and age of India sending two teams for as many tournaments, usually captains players who are way junior to him in terms of both age and experience. While Dhawan will turn 37 in less than a couple of months, some of his teammates have just started or are yet to start their careers at the highest level. Dhawan, however, leaves no stone unturned in creating an enjoyable and lively environment for one and all. The same is quite evident from India’s celebratory videos, at least. Speaking of celebratory videos, it’s a unique trend started by Dhawan where he and his teammates take part in a brief dance video after a series victory. With him leading India to three wins in as many series as captain, fans have seen Dhawan and others not just following social media trends but nailing them as well. With India defeating South Africa 2-1 in Delhi today, it isn’t surprising by any means that a celebratory video of Indian cricketers has already gone viral across social media platforms. Dhawan, who is an avid follower of Punjabi music, shortlisted veteran singer Daler Mehndi’s super-hit song titled (1995) as the song to dance on today. Former India batter VVS Laxman, who is a stand-in head coach of the men’s team in the absence of regular coach Rahul Dravid, took to his social media platform Twitter account to share a BTS video of Dhawan teaching dance steps to the teammates. “. @SDhawan25 leading the team not just on the field, but off the field as well,” Laxman wrote to start his tweet. . leading the team not just on the field, but off the field as well.

Quick to react, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and accused it of acting in “political vendetta” against one of West Bengal’s biggest sporting icons. “Another example of political vendetta. Son of @AmitShah can be retained as Secretary of #BCCI. But @SGanguly99 can’t be. Is it because he is from the State of @MamataOfficial or he didn’t join @BJP4India? We are with you Dada!,” Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen tweeted. The tweet by a senior Trinamool leader is an attempt to suggest Mr. Ganguly has been side-lined since he is from West Bengal, thereby attempting to raise the plank of “Bengali nationalism”, an issue which the party used successfully in the 2021 Assembly polls. Also read | Roger Binny set to be elected unopposed as BCCI president Earlier this year, in May, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had dinner at Mr. Ganguly’s Kolkata residence along with other senior BJP leaders from the State. The very next day, on May 8, Mr. Ganguly was heard describing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as “ kaacher manus “ (someone very close to him). Mr. Ganguly was also present at a grand event organised by the West Bengal Government on September 1 to thank UNESCO for including ‘Durga Puja in Kolkata’ in its list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Not only has Mr. Ganguly met Ms. Banerjee a number of times at the State Secretariat, he was also much sought after in the earlier Left Front regime, and its then former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee never missed an opportunity to meet him. The left-handed batsman always found himself on the right side of the Left regime, and had Ministers like Asok Bhattacharya publicly proclaiming themselves a fan of the former Indian captain. Recently, Mr. Bhattacharya, who seemed upset with both the BJP and TMC for reaching out to Mr. Ganguly and using him politically, had said that such overtures were putting pressure on the cricketing legend. Considering the popularity that Mr. Ganguly enjoys in West Bengal, there has always been speculation over his entry into politics. Sources in the BJP said the party leadership had been trying to rope Mr. Ganguly into its fold as far back as the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. According to a senior BJP leader, Mr. Ganguly was offered any seat of his choice in the State in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, which the cricketer considered too much of a risky shot. Following the BJP’s performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when it won 18 of the 42 parliamentary seats in West Bengal, and the party seriously thought it had a chance at unseating Ms. Banerjee, Mr. Ganguly was seen as their best bet. In January 2021, when he fell ill, wishes poured in from the BJP hierarchy, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As the 2021 Assembly polls drew nearer and a number of Bengali stalwarts, including actor Mithun Chakraborty, joined the saffron camp, the BJP leadership patiently waited for Mr. Ganguly to step out of his crease and hit a six for the party. Mr. Ganguly, who had been the BCCI president since October 2019, however, sensed the political mood and remained non-committal towards both the BJP and the Trinamool. After the party’s 2021 West Bengal Assembly poll debacle, the BJP’s central leadership appears to have lost interest in the politics of the State and there are hardly any visits by its central leaders. The developments at the BCCI meeting in Mumbai indicate that the BJP leadership may have given up on its wait for Mr. Ganguly. Meanwhile, there is speculation that Mr. Ganguly may be eyeing a key post at the International Cricket Council.

At the Jaipuria Vidyalaya Ground, asked to bat, Delhi posted 167 for seven and easily stopped Manipur at 96 for seven for a 71-run victory. Opener Hiten Dalal (47, 27b, 7x4, 1x6) set a blistering pace during the opening stand of 59 with Anuj Rawat. Later, Himmat Singh smashed six boundaries in his seven-ball unbeaten 25. In response, Manipur was never in the hunt but all credit to the team for batting out 20 overs against an attack that included Ishant Sharma, Navdeep Saini, Nitish Rana and Lalit Yadav.

Put in, Punjab rode on Anmolpreet Singh’s 50 (40b, 5x4, 1x6) and a fitting finish by Sanvir Singh (55 not out, 19b, 3x4. 5x6) to reach 174 for four. In response, Hyderabad folded for 115 in 18.4 overs. Tilak Varma top-scored with 50 (38b, 6x4, 1x6) while Punjab’s Abhishek Sharma (three for 22) and Baltej Singh (three for 22) finished with identical analyses.

Leading India for the first time at home, Dhawan has managed to maintain his unbeaten series streak as captain. Having won seven and lost two matches as captain, all three series wins under Dhawan have come against different opposition and countries. “I am proud of the boys, the way they played in the series. The way they carried the responsibility and showed maturity,” Dhawan told during the post-match presentation ceremony crediting a young squad for a series win. The 36-year old player highlighted how his comparatively inexperienced teammates stuck to the “process” without getting pressurized by the opposition after losing the first ODI in Ranchi last week. Not the best of series for Dhawan with the bat in hand, the left-handed batter scored a total of 25 runs at an average and strike rate of 8.33 and 50 respectively. Not been able to find his mojo across three innings, Dhawan admitted to not playing according to his potential but also shared a desire of contributing in the future. “I’m enjoying the journey. Of course, I will still love to keep performing consistently for whatever team I play. This series, I couldn’t perform but I was very very happy that all the young boys stepped up and showed great character,” Dhawan said. With India scheduled to next play a three-match ODI series in New Zealand next month, Dhawan would be eager to score his . In 11 ODIs in New Zealand on three separate trips over the years, Dhawan has scored 373 runs at an average of 37.30 and a strike rate of 81.79 with the help of a century and two half-centuries.","pubDate":"2022-10-11 14:59:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bumrah best in the world in white-ball cricket: Chris Morris","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/t20-world-cup/bumrah-boom-boom-best-in-world-white-ball-chris-morris-t20-world-cup-2022-australia-india-squad-depth/article65997811.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        P.

He may have retired but the fans remember those deadly yorkers and big hits at the Indian Premier League (IPL). “It is always good to be in India and it’s a place close to my heart,” the former South African all-rounder tells Sportstar . “I have spent so much time in India and every time you get that cricket vibe.” He says it feels different as a commentator. “It is quite nice arriving in India and not worrying about having to bowl,” he smiles. “I have so many nice memories about playing at the IPL.” He remains the most expensive player in IPL history. Rajasthan Royals had spent Rs. 16.25 crore on him ahead of the 2021 season. He also played for Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Daredevils and Royal Challengers Bangalore in his long stint in the IPL, which began in 2013. Though his primary task was to bowl, he has to his credit some stunning knocks in the IPL, the 32-ball 82 not out for Delhi against Gujarat Lions in 2016 one of them. “It is one of my favourite memories as we were (58 for four when I came in, chasing 173),” he says. “But it would have been better if we hadn’t lost by one run.” Morris believes the IPL is more about the quality of cricket. “People talk about its financial rewards but that is a completely separate story,” he says. “Show me one cricketer who doesn’t want to play in the IPL and I will tell him he is a liar.” Looking ahead to the T20 World Cup in Australia, Morris feels there are a few teams who look really good. “New Zealand are such good World Cup performers, India have always been there and South Africa could also do really well,” he says. “New Zealand, South Africa, India and Australia are my top four. You can’t count England out; they are playing unbelievably well. And Afghanistan or Bangladesh could surprise you.” He thinks India will miss Jasprit Bumrah in Australia. “He is a massive loss,” says Morris. “He is Boom Boom for a reason. He is the best in the world in white-ball cricket in my opinion. But other bowlers are putting their hands up. There is one thing that India never struggles with and that is depth.“ Read more stories on T20 World Cup.","pubDate":"2022-10-11 14:48:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mitchell Marsh confirms he is 'not in race' for Australia's ODI captaincy","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/mitchell-marsh-confirms-he-is-not-in-race-for-australias-odi-captaincy-764988","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Aaron Finch retired from ODIs earlier this yearCricket Australia are yet to announce their new ODI captainDavid Warner is one of the top contenders for the role","content":"Mitchell Marsh confirms he is ‘not in race’ for Australia’s ODI captaincyMitchell Marsh confirms he is ‘not in race’ for Australia’s ODI captaincyAustralia all-rounder Mitchell Marsh has confirmed that he is not in the race to become the country's next ODI skipper.While Aaron Finch is still Australia's T20I captain, his retirement from the 50-over format has opened up the position of the national team's ODI captain. Cricket Australia has been delaying announcing Finch's successor. The 30-year-old Marsh, who has plenty of domestic captaincy experience under his belt, having led both Western Australia and Perth Scorchers, has been considered one of the contenders for the ODI captaincy role. But Marsh has ended the rumours by saying \"captaincy is not on my radar at the moment.\"\"Probably not to be honest, I'm out of the race. I've had to get the body right for this World Cup. The World Cup is such an exciting prospect for all of us, to worry about that sort of stuff [captaincy] is just not on my radar at the moment.\"Cricket Australia has a decision to make after the World Cup...it's really not something I've thought about,\" Marsh said on Tuesday, according to ESPNCricinfo.Marsh, whose career has been marred with injuries, had the best year of his cricketing life in 2021, when he finished as Australia's leading run-scorer in the T20Is with 627 runs in 21 games, including six fifties, at an average of 36.88 and strike rate of close to 130. He was a vital figure in the Australian side that won the T20 World Cup in 2021, which was the country's maiden title in the shortest format. With the 50-over World Cup just a year away, one name that has been doing the rounds for Australia's ODI captaincy is David Warner. However, the veteran batsman is still facing a life-long ban from any kind of leadership role from Cricket Australia. Recent reporters have suggested that the national board could lift the ban in the coming months. David Warner is a 'great leader': Mitchell MarshWhen Marsh was asked if he'd endorse Warner for the job, the Western Australian cricketer said that he prefers to 'steer clear of all those conversations' but insisted that the southpaw is a 'great leader'.\"He's a great leader among our group. As far as all the decisions go, I certainly steer clear of all those conversations. But he's a great man to have in the squad,\" added Marsh. Marsh recently missed Australia's ODI series against New Zealand and T20Is in India due to an ankle injury. While he has just returned to the side, the 30-year-old cricketer is still not 100% fit and is featuring in the team as a specialist batsman. The Perth Scorchers star confirmed that he's hoping to get back to bowling in a week or so, around the time when the Aussies play their T20WC warm-up fixtures.\"The body's feeling good at this stage. Hopefully, I'll be right to bowl in the first warm-up game but with Stoin [Marcus Stoinis] back bowling now, it's a bit of luxury we can work as a team and really build towards the World Cup,\" said Marsh. If Marsh returns to bowling that would take Australia's tally of bowlers to seven, four specialist bowlers, along with three all-rounders (Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, and Glenn Maxwell). Marsh went on to say that the reigning champions are blessed to boast such flexibility ahead of the upcoming edition of the T20 World Cup. \"We're going to get four overs out of us; some days it's me, some days Stoin, and some days Maxi [Glenn Maxwell]. The best T20 teams in the world over the last five, six years, have that flexibility...we're almost a team within a team,\" the all-rounder added further. Australia are a part of Group 1 in the Super 12s, along with New Zealand, England, and Afghanistan. Finch and Co are scheduled to begin their title defense on Oct. 22 when they lock horns against BlackCaps at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).","pubDate":"2022-10-11 14:37:42","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/10/11/500x300_1315879-mitchell-marsh.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 WC: INOX signs deal with ICC to live screen India matches in cinemas","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/t20-wc-inox-signs-deal-with-icc-to-live-screen-india-matches-in-cinemas-122101101111_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Leading multiplex chain INOX Leisure Ltd will live screen all matches to be played by India at the upcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 in its cinema halls across the country.

India captain Shikhar Dhawan was seen trying to put a smile on his opening partner Shubman Gill’s face after winning the recently concluded third ODI against South Africa in Delhi. Gill, who witnessed India sealing a 100-run chase less than six balls after his dismissal, admitted to being disappointment due to the same. Having done all the hard work, Gill not only missed an opportunity to return back to the pavilion unbeaten but also missed out on a fourth ODI half-century. “Quite disappointed by the way I got out. But all learning from the series. The way we were down [after the first ODI] and the way we came back was tremendous. The bowlers did a great job in this series. Really pleasing series for us,” Gill told Star Sports right after the match concluded in Delhi today. How good is Gill! Just exudes different class when he bats. — Sanjay Manjrekar (@sanjaymanjrekar) October 11, 2022 Wanting to play across the line to a Lungi Ngidi delivery, Gill didn’t manage to make any contact with the ball only to be found wanting in front of the stumps. Nevertheless, the 23-year old player departed after scoring a stroke-filled 49 (57) at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. Shubman Gill set sights on Asia Cup 2023 cricket in Pakistan Gill, who rightly pointed out this Indian team’s character and intent for winning two back-to-back matches in order to avoid a series loss, expressed excitement with respect to two multi-team ODI tournaments to be played in the next 12 months. Having started to press his case as a reserve opening batter in a full-strength Indian ODI squad on the back of scoring 579 runs in 12 innings at an average and strike rate of 57.90 and 102.65 respectively, an ambitious Gill has set sights on Asia Cup 2023 and ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. “Exciting times for us with the 50-over Asia Cup coming up. And [with] the World Cup being here in India [next year], definitely a lot of excitement around,” Gill mentioned.

Sourav Ganguly, who held the position for three years, will make way for Binny at the Board's AGM on Oct. 18. Binny is expected to be elected as the next BCCI chief unopposed, while Union Sports Minister Anurag Thakur's brother Arun Dhumal is set to be IPL Chairman, replacing Brijesh Patel, the BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla told reporters on Tuesday. Jay Shah will retain his position as the BCCI secretary.Meanwhile, Jay Shah, son of Amit Shah, will also replace Ganguly as India's representative at the all-powerful ICC Board.\"I have filed nomination for the post of vice-president, Roger Binny has filed nomination for the president, Jay Shah has filed for secretary and Ashish Shelar for treasurer. As of now, the situation is that all will be appointed unopposed,\" said Shukla while interacting with the media.The decision to make Binny the 36th BCCI chief was taken after hectic rounds of discussions over the last one week. Former BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah also said that nominations for all the posts have been filed. \"I do not think there will be an election,\" he added.All office bearers from various parts of the country from different associations filed nominations for different positions on the board at the BCCI meeting held on Tuesday at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai.

While Ganguly was keen to continue as BCCI President, he was told that there is no precedence of giving a second term to the Board president.\"Sourav was offered IPL chairmanship but he politely declined the offer. His logic was that he cannot accept becoming head of a sub-committee in BCCI after heading the same institution,\" the BCCI source said.\"Roger is one of the finest human beings and a thorough gentleman, who has graced the field for India. Plus he is also a World Cup hero and has a squeaky-clean image. He resigned from the selection committee as his son Stuart back then was in India contention,\" the BCCI source added.After Ganguly rejected IPL chairmanship, the board offered the role to Dhumal, who has been known to be one of the most efficient men in the last BCCI cabinet.","pubDate":"2022-10-11 14:23:12","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/10/11/500x300_1315878-roger-binny.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India v South Africa | 3rd ODI | The match in 5 - SuperSport","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9d1d3X0hTam1MZVnSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India v South Africa | 3rd ODI | The match in 5  SuperSportKuldeep's four hand India series as South Africa fall for 99  ReutersIND vs SA LIVE Cricket Match Streaming: When and Where to watch ODI match, check score online today  HT TechIndia Opt To Bowl Against South Africa In ODI Decider  Barron'sIndia v South Africa 3rd ODI tip-off: India likely to remain unchanged, Malan likely to sit out if Bavuma returns, Ngidi for Fortuin  The Indian ExpressView Full Coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-11 13:49:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Man of the Series IND vs SA ODIs: Who won India vs South Africa Man of the Series award in today’s 3rd ODI?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-man-of-the-series-ind-vs-sa-odis-who-won-india-vs-south-africa-man-of-the-series-award-in-todays-3rd-odi/","keywords":["Cricket","India","Mohammed Siraj","South Africa","South Africa tour of India 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Man of the Series IND vs SA: The Indian fast bowler won a series award for the first time in his international career today.

India beat South Africa in the third ODI to clinch a three-match series 2-1. A 100-run chase was sealed by the hosts with 7 wickets and 30.5 overs remaining in their innings. A primary reason why this victory will boost the morale of several rookie players is them coming back from behind to register a series win at the Arun Jaitley Stadium today. India, who had lost the Test and ODI series in South Africa at the start of the year, have defeated them in both the white-ball formats at home towards the end of 2022. While a five-match T20I series between the two teams around the mid of the year had ended in a draw, all eyes will be on India vs South Africa ICC T20 World Cup 2022 match as the same will bring an end to them playing a large number of matches across formats against each other in this calendar year. Man of the Series IND vs SA While India spinner Kuldeep Yadav won the Player of the Match award for his bowling figures of 4.1-1-18-4 in the third ODI in Delhi, fast bowler Mohammed Siraj pinned down batter Shreyas Iyer (191 runs at an average and strike rate of 191 and 111.69 respectively) to win the Player of the Series award. Second-highest wicket-taker in the series behind Yadav (6), Siraj won a maiden series award in international cricket for picking five wickets in three matches at an average of 20.80, an economy rate of 4.52 and a strike rate of 27.6. “Performing against a good team gives you a lot of confidence. I had to take the responsibility. I try to figure out the right lengths at the start of the innings,” Siraj told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony.

The Giants' 27-22 win over the Packers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the fifth NFL game out of six played there to be decided by a single score. The only one that wasn't was the Carolina Panthers' 37-26 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week Six of the 2019 season.

Gabe Davis hauled in a 98-yard touchdown reception from Allen on 3rd-and-10 on Buffalo's first drive, tying the longest scrimmage touchdown in Bills history.
