A source close to the development told IANS that ICC has reached this decision after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) remained firm on its stance of not traveling to India. The official confirmation from the governing body will come soon.‘Since the ICC released its statement earlier this week and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) appears adamant about not travelling to India, Scotland is set to replace Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup. An official confirmation is expected very soon,” ICC sources told IANS on Saturday.Bangladesh earlier informed the ICC that they would not travel to India due to security concerns amid deteriorating relations between the two nations and requested that their matches be relocated to Sri Lanka. However, the ICC reiterated that the T20 World Cup will proceed as per schedule, with Bangladesh’s matches to be played in India.This follows the BCCI's direction to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release pacer Mustafizur Rahman for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 amid prevailing political tensions between the two countries.ICC also gave a 24-hour deadline to BCB for conveying its final decision on playing the tournament as planned.Scotland is the top-ranked team not to have qualified for the global event and is the first option to replace Bangladesh after the country decided to stick to its position of not travelling to India, even after a vote on this issue yielded a 14-2 verdict against them in the ICC.Scotland will now be placed in Group C in the preliminary stage of the tournament. They will play against the West Indies on February 7, Italy on February 9, and England on February 14 in Kolkata. Scotland will play its final group stage game in Mumbai against Nepal on February 17.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["news","cricket","sports"],"creator":["odisha tv bureau"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-01-24 12:24:27","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-01-24 12:47:53","image_url":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1280x960/odishatv/media/media_files/2026/01/04/icc-t20-wc-2026-2026-01-04-21-57-07.jpeg","video_url":null,"source_id":"odishatv","source_name":"Odisha Tv","source_priority":62016,"source_url":"https://odishatv.in","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/odishatv.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"1d4d7274d7010821f7d65777ee3b9c2e","link":"https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401736/tigresses-beat-ireland-to-seal-4th-straight-win-to","title":"Tigresses beat Ireland to seal 4th straight win to top group phase","description":"Bangladesh Women continued their dominant run in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifiers, securing their fourth consecutive victory with a nine-run win over Ireland in their final Group A match at the Mulapani Cricket Ground in Nepal on SaturdayDetails","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["cricket","bangladesh women’s cricket","icc women's cricket world cup","bangladesh women’s cricket team","bangladesh cricket"],"creator":["tribune report"],"language":"english","country":["bangladesh"],"category":["top","sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-01-24 12:23:44","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-01-24 12:45:59","image_url":"https://ecdn.dhakatribune.net/contents/cache/images/800x450x1/uploads/media/2026/01/24/83fd481bae7497effaf6727e98b170d1-6974b9b3afd07.jpg?jadewits_media_id=58740","video_url":null,"source_id":"dhakatribune","source_name":"Dhaka Tribune","source_priority":38460,"source_url":"https://www.dhakatribune.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/dhakatribune.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"a2db24369112d00ed26d8ad1519a9bf8","link":"https://apnlive.com/sports-news/bangladesh-removed-t20-world-cup-scotland-replacement/","title":"Bangladesh removed from T20 World Cup after declining India travel, Scotland to step in","description":"Bangladesh were axed from the T20 World Cup after failing to confirm travel to India within the ICC deadline, with Scotland set to take their place.The post Bangladesh removed from T20 World Cup after declining India travel, Scotland to step in appeared first on APN News.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["cricket news","international cricket news","latest sports news","india sri lanka hybrid model","t20 world cup 2026","scotland cricket","t20 world cup","icc decision","bangladesh cricket"],"creator":["amit@apnlive.com"],"language":"english","country":["india"],"category":["top","sports"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-01-24 12:23:06","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-01-24 12:58:01","image_url":"https://apnlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jay-shah.png","video_url":null,"source_id":"apnlive","source_name":"Apn","source_priority":684243,"source_url":"https://www.apnlive.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/apnlive.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"8bf010865b6d3c4ad6e4a898ab0f1283","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/explained-what-led-icc-to-remove-bangladesh-from-the-t20-world-cup/articleshow/127394669.cms","title":"Explained: What led ICC to remove Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup","description":"The ICC has replaced Bangladesh with Scotland in the 2026 T20 World Cup after the Bangladesh Cricket Board refused to travel to India.
