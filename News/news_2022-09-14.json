The new kit, Australia’s first uniform to feature a First Nations design at a cricket World Cup, also incorporates the colours of the Aboriginal flag and Torres Strait Islander flag. “We are very proud to be wearing a First Nations themed kit for the upcoming T20 World Cup and to also be the first cricket team to do so at a world event,” Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc said. “The First XI team is an important part of cricket’s history and we are honoured that through this kit we will share their story and celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures on the world stage.” The new uniform is designed by Kirrae Whurrong woman Aunty Fiona Clarke, in collaboration with Butchulla and Gubbi Gubbi woman Courtney Hagen. Australia begins its World Cup defence against New Zealand at the SCG on October 22. Captain Aaron Finch has been backed in as skipper despite retiring from one-day cricket after a horror run of form. “He certainly starts the tournament, no doubt about that,” Australian legend Adam Gilchrist said on Tuesday. “And I guess they’ll just manage it from there. If he and the selectors feel that it’s proving to be a handbrake or an issue for the team in tournament play, I’m sure they’ll just monitor it and see.”  ","pubDate":"2022-09-13 23:41:57","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8231919/aa38ae234261a618d34ce44bde99fdb7f5c8eda6-16x9-x0y790w2048h1152.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia’s World Cup uniform revealed","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-will-wear-a-first-nations-inspired-uniform-when-it-defends-its-t20-world-cup-title/news-story/a951ea28564c6c6d8623d103a6b518ab","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","NewsWire","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian players will wear a uniform inspired by cricket’s connection to First Nations people and culture when they defend their T20 World Cup title on home soil next month.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-13 23:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warner hopeful Cricket Australia will lift leadership ban","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/warner-hopeful-cricket-australia-will-lift-leadership-ban/video/8eeb9b67866ed701c970ed5dc3d139f2","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Following the retirement of ODI captain Aaron FInch, David Warner remains hopeful Cricket Australia will lift the leadership ban they placed on him following sandpapergate.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-13 22:09:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Gilchrist backs Finch to find form ahead of World Cup","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/gilchrist-backs-finch-to-find-form-ahead-of-world-cup/video/40bcaa5c03016f9d922c1f678882b597","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Despite a lean run of form, for wicket keeper Adam Gilchrist is backing T20 captain Aaron Finch to find form ahead of the World Cup.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-13 22:09:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Perry breaks world record for longest bowling run up","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/perry-breaks-world-record-for-longest-bowling-run-up/video/93b6bb5e484e16e0e53e45598d1ececb","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CRicket: To commemorate the longest Summer of cricket on Fox Sports, Aussie star Ellyse Perry has broken the world record for the longest bowling run up.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-13 22:00:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Roosters plan drastic action on 'reckless' duo","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/the-mole-news-2022-roosters-jared-waerea-hargreaves-victor-radley-aggression-knights-halves/e5d36318-9acf-403b-acbd-7403da2594a9","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"T﻿HE MOLE: The Roosters are set to propose unique penalties for firebrand forwards who 'crossed the line'.","content":"Furious Roosters officials will put bad boys Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Victor Radley through the club's own form of anger management over the summer. The pair crossed the line in Sunday's brutal clash with the Rabbitohs , spending three stints in the sin bin between them for cheap shots. Club insiders largely blame the duo's brain explosions for their loss to Souths that sent them spinning out of the comp. READ MORE: NRL comes down hard on star's Queen slur ﻿READ MORE: Warner's bombshell claim about cricket leadership ban READ MORE: Eagles left fuming by star's trade request﻿ Both sail close to the wind with the way they play and with referees and the Bunker taking a zero tolerance approach to foul play these days, they are fast becoming a liability. A week earlier, with Radley missing and Waerea-Hargreaves getting little game time, the Roosters beat South Sydney comfortably. In that game the Roosters played with controlled aggression whereas in the final, both players lost their heads and the Rabbitohs took full advantage. Roosters coach Trent Robinson is about to begin his season review and is certain to give the pair a severe tongue lashing for their reckless performances last Sunday. Stream the NRL premiership 2022 live and free on 9Now Both can be fine players, but have short fuses and will need to learn to channel their anger to remain effective in the NRL. They have the whole summer to think about how they blew it against South Sydney - and how they must cool it to stay relevant in the big games. Something is going on at Newcastle regarding their halves. Still looking for a replacement for Mitchell Pearce, whose move to France this year left a gaping hole in their playmaking, the club has offered both their current halves, Jake Clifford and Adam Clune, to English clubs. It can mean only one thing - they have a halfback either signed or in mind for 2023. Could it be a last desperate play to snare Luke Brooks from the Tigers ? The Tigers aren't budging on Brooks at the moment, but if the Knights throw in some cash to sweeten the deal, that may change. The Knights have signed Tyson Gamble from Brisbane, but he is not a realistic 26-game-a-season NRL playmaker… more of a handy back-up. The Bulldogs have continued their impressive build-up for next season by signing two of the best young players in the Roosters system. Phil Gould's men have poached Roosters Jersey Flegg captain and back-rower Jake Preston and prop Zac Montgomery for next season. Preston, aged 20, and Montgomery, 19, both had impressive seasons in the Roosters team that finished on top of the Flegg ladder. The Roosters lost a thrilling semi-final 24-22 against the Knights last weekend but have another chance to book a grand final spot when they face Penrith Panthers in the preliminary final. Rugby league will have its own Lebron in 2023! Parramatta has signed a giant prop from the Broncos system, Lebron Tuala. And while standing at a towering two metres, he is just shy of NBA legend LeBron James (2.06m). The teenage middle forward is only 18 and still growing, with good judges rating him a fine prospect. At 118 kilograms, he has plenty of bulk as well and moves swiftly for a big kid. Tuala made a strong impression playing for Norths Devils in the Mal Meninga Cup this season, where he was spotted by Eels scouts. Blessed with a strong running game and a hard hitter in defence, he's definitely one to watch out for over the next couple of seasons.

The remarks by the apex court were made during the hearing on the Board's plea seeking to amend its constitution concerning the tenure of its office bearers including its President Sourav Ganguly and Secretary Jay Shah by doing away with the mandatory cooling-off period between tenures of office bearers across state cricket associations and the BCCI. The top court, which said that the cooling off period will not be scrapped between the tenures of office bearers as \"the purpose of the cooling off period is that there should be no vested interest,\" said it will continue with the hearing Wednesday and pass order. While the submission was being made, the bench said \"BCCI is an autonomous body. We cannot micro-manage its functioning.\" As per the constitution adopted by the BCCI, an office bearer has to undergo a three-year cooling-off period between two consecutive terms in either the state association or the BCCI or both combined. At the outset, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for BCCI, told a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli, that the game of cricket is substantially streamlined in the country. He submitted that the apex court has said that when the bye-laws will go into functional preparedness, some changes could be made with the leave of the court. He said that the BCCI is an autonomous body and all the changes have been considered by the AGM of the cricket body. Mehta said, \"As the constitution exists today, there is a cooling off period. If I am an office bearer of the state cricket association for one term and BCCI for another consecutive term, then I have to go for a cooling off period\". He added that both bodies are different and their rules are also different and two consecutive tenures of the office bearer are too short to develop leadership at the grassroots level. The Solicitor General said, \"Leadership develops at the grassroots level and it remains in the state association. By the time, his time comes for being elevated to the BCCI; he has to go for a mandatory three-year cooling-off period. One cannot become a member of the BCCI if he is not an active member of the state association\". He said, adding that holding of the post in state association by a BCCI office bearer should not be considered for the cooling-off period. “We are engaging in discussion and not passing any judgement. Social media thinks that whatever we say in court that’s judgement but that is just a dialogue to elicit a response and better understanding of facts”. The bench said that so an office bearer of the state association cannot hold a post in BCCI, without undergoing three years cooling-off period as per the existing constitution. Mehta said that the concern of the court is that no one should perennially be in-charge in the cricket body and that concern has been taken care of by suggesting cooling off period, after two consecutive terms in BCCI, so that experience of \"worthy administrators\" does not go waste. He said that the second amendment is concerning the restriction of 70 years of age in the governing council for representation to the International Cricket Council, which the BCCI wants to be gone. The bench said, \"Why should we have people above 70 years, let young people represent the country in ICC? We are not saying that people above the age of 70 years have not done exemplary work, but it’s a sport. We have our Attorney General, who is above 70, there are some doctors above 70 who are doing exemplary work in their field\". Mehta said, \"ICC is a council where it is decided, which country gets how much funds. There are heavy negotiations among the veterans from the cricket bodies across the world. My young man will have to deal with these veterans, who have 30-40 years of experience in dealing with cricket\". He added that there is nowhere restriction on the age for ICC representation in any part of the world. The bench said, \"Do you mean to say that Cricket Australian Board or England and Wales Cricket Board do not have any age restrictions for ICC representation? Show us the material on record. We don't have any material before us with regard to that. You place it\". No, the bench said that it would continue its hearing on Wednesday and asked amicus curiae senior advocate Maninder Singh to collate all the details. The bench said it will pass the order. Singh suggested that if a person has served one term of three years as an office bearer of a state association, and then he goes on to serve as an office bearer in BCCI, then he should be allowed to serve for two consecutive terms of six years in the cricket body without having to go mandatory three years cooling off period. The BCCI, in its proposed amendment, has sought the abolition of a cooling-off period for its office bearers which would enable Sourav Ganguly and Jay Shah to continue in office as President and Secretary despite them having completed six years at respective state cricket associations.

After the underwhelming performance of Team India in the recently concluded Asia cup, concerns have been expressed over the performance of Indian batters in the middle overs in the meeting. Apart from this, a BCCI official has also given a statement to PTI on the selection of Sanju Samson and Rishabh Pant. It has also been stated that Sanju Samson will get a chance in the upcoming South Africa series. BCCI announced teams for the T20 series against South Africa and Australia along with the T20 World Cup squad on Monday. Apart from the South Africa T20Is, the men in blue will play three ODIs against the Proteas. The matches will be played on October 6, 9, and 11. According to a BCCI source, Sanju Samson will get a place in the team for the ODI series. Along with this, Pant's inclusion in the team was also explained to him. \"Sanju in any case will be playing the ODIs against South Africa as selectors will maintain the continuity from the Zimbabwe tour. Also, there were never any discussions on dropping Pant. He is the only left-hander we have at the top and he can win a match on his day,\" : BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah along with the national selection committee also discussed the poor performance of the national team during the continental championship. \"Yes, the Asia Cup performance was discussed. But obviously, more than problems, the focus is on solutions and what are the things that need to be improved during the T20 World Cup,\" a senior BCCI official added.

Here’s a crucial update David Warner has revealed that it was not just the Sandpaper Gate in 2018 that might have led to his leadership ban from the Australian cricket board. Australia's limited-overs captain Aaron Finch retired from ODI cricket recently, giving the national side enough time to choose a replacement keeping in mind the Cricket World Cup in 2023, which will be played in India. With vice-captain Pat Cummins, who is also the Test captain, reportedly not wanting to take up an added workload to his workload, a few circles of Australian cricket have recommended Warner's name for the captain's position. Warner, once a favourite to become the white-ball captain, fell down in the pecking order after the Sandpaper Gate 2018 during Australia's tour of South Africa. \"Unfortunately a lot of the events before 2018 were with the board. The MOU stuff [pay dispute] and all that There was a lot of stuff that was things got over and above in terms of more than the Cape Town stuff,\" Warner told reporters on Tuesday. Post the incident in Cape Town, the Australian cricket board slapped then-skipper Steve Smith and his deputy Warner with a year's ban each from international and domestic cricket. While Smith was suspended from any leadership role for a year, Warner was banned from the same indefinitely. \"There was more to it. I think that's where my decision, the penalty that was handed down was more of stuff that was happening before that. I think at the end of the day it's about what questions do they [the board] want to ask me,\" Warner said. David Warner: Any opportunity to captain Australia is a privilege The explosive southpaw went on to add that he is very much interested in hearing what the new Australia Cricket Board has to say. \"That's where the conversation starts and then we can lead from there. It's almost a completely new board from when 2018 happened. I would be interested to see and hear what their thoughts are. \"But any opportunity you get asked to captain, it's a privilege. For my circumstances, that's in Cricket Australia's hands.

He used a quote from Sri Lanka's fielding coach, Anton Roux, to highlight how players put smiles on the faces of their countrymen amid a heavy economic crisis in the island nation and showcased their fighting spirit and toughness by chasing and defending targets in some tense, nail-biting matches after a loss to Afghanistan in the tournament opener. \"Shoutout to @OfficialSLC for a wonderful achievement! In the words of one of their Coaches @Rooster55555, \"tough times don't last, but tough people do\". Congrats guys,\" tweeted de Villiers. Shoutout to @OfficialSLC for a wonderful achievement!

They have won the title previously in 1986, 1997, 2004, 2008 and 2014. They are the second-most successful team in tournament history next to India, which has won seven titles. Coming to the Asia Cup final, Sri Lanka was put to bat first by Pakistan. The island nation fought their way back into the game from being 42/5 in the powerplay. Bhanuka Rajapaksa (71*) and Wanindu Hasaranga (36) had a 58-run stand that took Sri Lanka to 170/6 in their 20 overs. Pakistan lost two early wickets while chasing 171 and were at 22/2. Then, Mohammad Rizwan (55) and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) formed a 61-run stand to stabilize the innings. In death overs, Sri Lanka once again swung the match in their favour through a spell by Hasaranga (3/27). Pakistan was bundled out for 147 and lost by 23 runs. Pramod Madushan (4/34) also did a lot of damage in powerplay and death overs, helping his side secure the Asia Cup title. Promoted Rajapaksa got 'Man of the Match' award for his brilliant 71*.

Australia thrashed England 4-0 in the 2021-22 Ashes, winning the Tests in Brisbane, Melbourne, and Hobert, while the New Year's Test in Sydney ended in a draw, avoiding a white-wash of the English side Down Under. The recent Ashes defeat was one of the major reasons behind the change in leadership. Under Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum, England have won six of their last seven Tests. \"At the start of April, if you had said they had a chance to win back the Ashes next year we would have said there was no way they could do it. But, on the back of a remarkable summer of Test cricket, it is clear: England can regain the urn next summer,\" Vaughan wrote in his column for the Daily Telegraph. Australia are ranked No. 1 in the ICC Test Rankings and they have the best win percentage in the longest format this year. In seven Tests, the Aussies have won three, drawn, as many and lost just one. England, on the other hand, have won six in 12 Tests and all the wins have come under Stokes and McCullum. \"Australia will respect the aggressive way that England have played this summer. And they will fear it too, knowing that England can attack and are so dangerous from all positions,\" added Vaughan. England's recent aggressive approach has sent the opposition a clear message that the English side can win in any given situation. \"The leadership group of Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum has been so clear in releasing the shackles of any pressure on the field. They have sent a clear message to the opposition that they are out to win, from any position. \"If they want to be the best team in the world for a period then they will have to play more consistently and combine that flair they have displayed all summer with that toughness and shrewdness,\" Vaughan further added. The next edition of The Ashes will be played in England in 2023. The last time Australia travelled to England – in 2019 – they managed to draw the series 2-2. The hosts most recently defeated South Africa 2-1 at home.","pubDate":"2022-09-13 15:29:06","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/09/13/500x300_1312192-michael-vaughan.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Scotland launches racism investigation","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/scotland-launches-racism-investigation-c-8229457","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket Scotland has set up an investigation into individual complaints of racism which emerged from a recent damning review.","content":"Cricket Scotland has established an independent process for investigating individual complaints of racism. Tuesday's announcement follows the recent damning review into racism within both the sport and governing body. Sports law firm Harper MacLeod will work in conjunction with race equality charity Sporting Equals and campaign group Running Out Racism to review and investigate complaints. Cricket Scotland revealed that the work is already under way and will take \"some months\". A total of 68 individual concerns were referred for further investigation following Plan4Sport's independent review of allegations of racism within the organisation. These included 31 allegations of racism against 15 people, two clubs and one regional association. Some cases were also referred to Police Scotland and Children First. The report uncovered widespread institutional racism within Cricket Scotland, whose entire board stepped down on the eve of publication in July. The allegations included racial abuse, use of inappropriate language, favouritism towards white children from public schools and a lack of a transparent selection process. Cricket Scotland's interim chief executive Gordon Arthur said the announcement marked an important milestone. \"Only when we have investigated fully, will we be able to decide what action might be taken in individual circumstances, to bring closure on these issues. \"It may be that a number of referrals can be satisfactorily resolved without the need of in-depth investigations and others may take a longer period of time to resolve. \"There are also a significant number to cover, which means not all will be able to commence at the same time. We would therefore ask that the process is respected to enable each investigation to reach conclusion.\" Waqqas Ashraf, of Running Out Racism, welcomed the thought that Cricket Scotland had put into the process. \"Key to building trust in future changes first starts with dealing robustly with past issues,\" he added. \"We will do all we can to support those contributing to the investigations, to help ensure they are treated with compassion and fairness through the process.\" Meanwhile, former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq is poised to give further evidence to a parliamentary select committee later this year. He spoke candidly about his experience of racist abuse during his two stints at the county last November. It is understood that members of the Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) committee are keen to hear from Rafiq and Yorkshire chair Lord Patel again. The committee is thought to be especially keen to hear from Rafiq about a campaign to vilify him since his first appearance before them. Rafiq is also due to appear as a witness at Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) hearings in November or December. It is understood Rafiq would be prepared to appear again, if asked. In June, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that Yorkshire and \"a number of individuals\" had been charged following an investigation into Rafiq's allegations of racism, and into how Yorkshire had handled them.","pubDate":"2022-09-13 15:04:57","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8229457/d7c587972648b7c4b2e021d858c4fc77c14bb31d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BCCI To Unveil Team India's New Jersey For T20 World Cup 2022 - ICC CRICKET SCHEDULE","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljY2NyaWNrZXRzY2hlZHVsZS5jb20vYmNjaS10by11bnZlaWwtdGVhbS1pbmRpYXMtbmV3LWplcnNleS1mb3ItdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIyL9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"BCCI To Unveil Team India's New Jersey For T20 World Cup 2022  ICC CRICKET SCHEDULEHarsha Bhogle reviews India's T20 World Cup 2022 Squad  Cricbuzz3 Reasons Why Mohammed Shami Was Not Included In India Squad For T20 World Cup 2022  Cricket AddictorExpresso National and International Sports News Update at 1:30 pm 13th September, 2022  The Indian ExpressIt was R Ashwin vs Mohammed Shami in selection meeting, then Dravid-Rohit made the big call: Report  Times NowView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-13 14:58:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"David Warner willing to look past torn relations with Cricket Australia for captaincy shot: It’s a new board","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/david-warner-willing-to-look-past-torn-relations-with-cricket-australia-for-captaincy-shot-it-s-a-new-board-1999854-2022-09-13?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Warner willing to look past torn relations with CA for captaincy shot","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-13 13:40:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Is it fair to ditch Shikhar Dhawan?
