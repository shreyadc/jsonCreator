The T20 series will be held in Lahore and Faisalabad from March 5-8. The visitors were received here at the Jinnah International Airport by the ODI series organising committee comprising Imran Sheikh, Asif Azeem, Majid Khan and Shiraz Asif. This is the first time that the South African blind side is visiting Pakistan. Just hours after arrival of the touring party, the trophy for the ODI series was unveiled here at the Pearl Continental during a news conference which was attended by both the teams. Pakistan Blind Cricket Council (PBCC) president Sultan Shah told a news conference that this was the first tour of South Africa to Pakistan. Pakistan have visited South Africa three times. He also thanked sponsors and Sindh government for their assistance for the series. The ODI series matches will be held on February 28, March 1 and March 3. The first game of the T20 series will be held at Lahore on March 5. Faisalabad will host the second and third T20 games on March 7 and March 8. Pakistan captain Nisar Ali said that it would be a good series. “South Africa is a good side and matches will be very good,” Nisar told the news conference. “Our team is strong and our players will deliver. I hope results will be in our favour,” Nisar said. “The series will help to prepare for the World Cup to be held in November. We have given chance to youngsters so that they could showcase their talent which will help us to prepare the brigade as per plans,” Nisar said. “We held a six-day camp in Lahore and the boys trained well,” he said. South Africa skipper Asanda Isaac Bidla said that the tour would help them learn. “Pakistan is a top side and playing with them will help us prepare for the World Cup,” Isaac said. “We have also prepared well. In our team there are a few youngsters who are part of our future plan and I am very much confident that our boys will deliver their best and surprise Pakistan,” Isaac said. Both teams will hold their practice sessions at the Southend Club Cricket Stadium on Sunday (today). South Africa assistant coach Frikkie Schoeman told ‘The News’ that they held a three-day training camp for the series. “We held just a three-day camp for the series. It’s not enough but the issue is finances as sponsors are least interested in blind cricket,” Schoeman said in an informal talk. “There is immense talent in South Africa and the boys are eager to play cricket and want to learn,” said Schoeman, who resides in Pretoria. He said he was happy to be in Pakistan for the first time.

Out near the boundary, if you like. But it’s worth bearing with Martin Buckle and Ranil Mendis. The game, after all, is Canada’s forgotten national sport. And after two-plus pandemic years of cordoned-off playgrounds, bans on contact sports and learning from the kitchen table, the joy of physical education likely feels a little forgotten too. Its importance, however, hasn’t been. Multiple medical studies and social surveys during the pandemic have warned of the immediate and long-term implications of COVID-19 disruptions on the physical activity of Canadian youth. One study found that less than five per cent of the country’s children were meeting movement behaviour guidelines during the pandemic. Which is why Buckle and Mendis got to work. “A lot of challenges that kids may have been facing with sports and staying active, well, they didn’t actually start from such a good place,” Buckle told the Star. “The pandemic screwed things up doubly. Now we have redouble our efforts.” In truth, the pair had been putting in the work for years. The pandemic merely gave them the breathing room to finally figure out how to redouble efforts. They set up the Ontario Schools Cricket Association (OSCA) in 2020. It was partly an exercise in rebranding. Mendis and Buckle are both immigrants to Canada. They’re also management accountants. The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, or CIMA, brought them together in the same way the British-based professional body has brought so many newcomers here together: on a cricket oval. “CIMA, it’s 102 years old and historically was quite popular in Commonwealth countries — 97 per cent of our members in Canada are immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth nations,” said Buckle, originally from England. “One of the few things we have in common, apart from double-entry bookkeeping, is cricket.” But in the mid-2000s, an annual social and networking cricket match began morphing into something bigger. Mendis, who emigrated from Sri Lanka and worked in Toronto City Hall at the time, invited then-mayor David Miller and police chief Bill Blair along to iron out budgetary differences with ball and bat. Rob Ford surprised CIMA by continuing the tradition. Doug Ford came along too, and pressured the organizers to get the city’s kids involved. Buckle and Mendis set up an East Toronto Schools vs. West competition which hadn’t even run its course before schools from farther afield were pleading to join. Peel, Durham, Hamilton, Niagara, even Ottawa. By 2019, Ford, now in Queen’s Park, had agreed to call the competition the Premier’s Cup School Cricket Championship. Over 8,000 schoolchildren were taking part. “We’re supposed to be a bunch of accountants organizing events for our members and now we have this massive schools tournament on our hands,” laughed Buckle. “Our betters in London were not too happy. They love that we’re doing this and love that it’s super positive, but get a little nervous that we’re now a cricket organization with an accounting institute on the side!” Both are struck by the irony of the pandemic allowing them the space to finally focus efforts and launch the OSCA while exacerbating the need for the kind of active outlet they’d offered, particularly among schoolgirls. That same pandemic study found that while 6.5 per cent of Canadian boys were meeting activity standards, just 2.8 per cent of girls were. “Our objective is not necessarily to promote the game for the good of cricket. Instead we are using the game to promote physical activity for the kids,” said Mendis. “It’s about getting out there.” As restrictions again loosen and physical education classes get back to something closer to normal, the OSCA has run a competition in schools to help design its new logo. It will be unveiled in late March, when there will be a formal changeover from CIMA with the organization’s president flying in from Britain for a hoped relaunch of the Premier’s Cup. But both men know there is much to do. Having gone virtual with teacher training during the pandemic, recruiting more coaches, particularly those from non-cricket backgrounds, is a focus. So too is equipment, Buckle is hoping that stories such as an Ottawa phys-ed teacher who had his school’s woodwork class make cricket bats can be a thing of the past. Mahendra Ram is a chemistry teacher at York Memorial C.I. and also the TDSB’s girls cricket co-ordinator. He has seen the impact that CIMA’s work had on the girls’ side of the game as it boomed pre-pandemic, bringing in not just those of cricketing powerhouse South Asian heritage, but girls from all backgrounds. When Mendis helped bring Pakistan’s iconic women’s captain Sana Mir in for a visit, Toronto schoolgirl players were awestruck. Now there’s a fresh generation to first recruit, then inspire. “I’m hoping that we can start where we left off, but that’s the dream,” Ram, who emigrated from Guyana in the 1980s, told the Star. “The reality is that a lot of the players have graduated in the last three years, and so most coaches are starting from scratch. That’s where OSCA’s contribution is going to make this impact: that we have new teachers comfortable with a sport that they didn’t play and are passionate to coach it.” Once declared Canada’s national sport by Sir John A. Macdonald, recreational adult cricket has been booming in the GTA for some time and defying the climate in the process. The city caused a stir in 2019 when a $2.2-billion master plan pointed to changing demographics as it prioritized the sport (and others) over hockey with five new cricket pitches in the proposal. Brampton and Mississauga have already poured money into outdoor and indoor venues. “If Brampton invests hundreds of thousands of dollars in a new cricket facility, we want to fill it with kids,” said Buckle, “while making sure girls are involved with the game. We know that Canada’s women’s soccer team, hockey team, rugby team are among the best in the world, but the girls who should be playing cricket aren’t playing. “If Canada one day become one of the best women’s cricket teams in the world … that’d be awesome, but that’s not the idea. The idea is that those girls are missing out right now, and we have to find a way to get them interested and happy and healthy.” Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

The all-important ICC Women’s World Cup 2022 is just a few days away. Teams are getting into shape ahead of the main tournament by playing a series of warm-up games beginning on February 27 and ending on March 2, two days before the World Cup kicks off. Australia will be high on confidence. They dismantled England in the Ashes, and won the three-match ODI series 3-0. They’ve been in supreme form in almost every department. Meanwhile, West Indies looked ordinary in their last outing against South Africa. They lost the ODI series 2-1, and will need to put up better performances.

The track is expected to be pretty batting-friendly, and high scores are common. Pacers might find some help in the initial stages. Both teams will probably look to bat first after winning the toss. Alyssa Healy is one of the most destructive batters in women’s cricket, and it’s extremely difficult to stop her once she gets going. She has scored 2130 runs at an average of 33.80 and a strike rate of 99.39 in 85 ODIs. Beth Mooney is an experienced player who exudes a lot of confidence at the top of the order for Australia. She has amassed 1420 runs from 45 games at an average close to 45. She has two centuries in this format. Meanwhile, Deandra Dottin is one of the biggest stars in the West Indies team. She is a brilliant all-rounder who has amassed 3528 runs and has collected 69 wickets in 135 ODI games. Tahila McGrath was in devastating form during the recent series against England, where she was awarded the Player of the Series in the ODIs. She has scored 227 runs, and has also collected 11 wickets in as many ODIs. Meanwhile, Hayley Matthews is another player you must have in your Dream11 Fantasy team. She has amassed 1504 runs in her ODI career of 61 games. She has also scalped 68 wickets in the format. Jess Jonassen has plenty of experience, and is a bankable player for Australia.

Their 66-run, sixth wicket partnership, dominated by a half-century to de Grandhomme, lifted New Zealand to 157 for five at stumps in reply to South Africa's 364. Playing with the lights on during a gloomy afternoon at Hagley Oval, South Africa had New Zealand at five for 91 before de Grandhomme joined Mitchell in the middle. The burly all-rounder favoured attack as the best defence and was not out at 54 off 61 deliveries at stumps, with the more circumspect Mitchell on 29. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) Right then, South Africa have finally arrived in New Zealand. They were only physically present in the first Test but now they are physically, mentally and skillfully in New Zealand. The visitors are in the driver's seat and it's just a matter of breaking the current partnership. They still have a handy lead and one hour of disciplined bowling on the morning of Day 3 will further strengthen their chances in this Test match. For New Zealand, their hopes are pinned big time on Colin de Grandhomme and Daryl Mitchell. Another hour of Colin's blitz with the bat will be enough to bring this match in the balance. Plenty to look forward to on Sunday. Don't forget to join us. The first ball will be at 3.30 am IST (10 pm GMT, previous day) but as usual, our build-up will begin in advance. Until we meet again, it's goodbye and cheers! Summarizing Day 2 - At the start of the day's play, South Africa had the advantage but that didn't last for long. The Kiwi bowlers turned up with full force and picked wickets at regular wickets. As many as four wickets went down in the morning session for just 60 runs and the hosts managed to restore some parity. Just when it appeared that the Proteas would get bundled out under 325, the pair of Marco Jansen and Keshav Maharaj joined forces. It was an assault from them on the strategy of Neil Wagner to bowl short as they took him to the cleaners and combined for a 62-run stand which catapulted South Africa's total above 350. Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen then made life tough for the Kiwi batters and hunted down 5 wickets together. The former, in particular, was very lethal in his spell after Tea and was too hot to handle. An excellent second half of the final session for the Kiwis but in totality, the day has belonged to the touring party once more! The bowlers of South Africa put out a clinical show and decimated the top half of New Zealand's batting. They bowled according to the plan and got good support from the surface as well under overcast conditions (with the floodlights on). However, after the arrival of Colin de Grandhomme at the crease, things changed drastically. With the hosts reeling, Colin decided to throw caution to the wind and it paid off. His counter-punch stopped South Africa's charge and stole the momentum away a bit. Currently, he is involved in a 66-run stand with Daryl Mitchell and together, they have brought the deficit down to 207 runs. Full and around middle, angling in, Daryl Mitchell brings down a straight bat and pushes it towards mid on. With that, it's time for STUMPS ON DAY 2! SHOUT FOR AN LBW! The umpire shakes his head. Dean Elgar smiles. He has already wasted two reviews. Takes chance and goes for it. DRS time. Lutho Sipamla delivers it on a length, around off and it nips back in off the seam. Daryl Mitchell strides forward to defend but seems to have missed the ball. He is pinged on the pads, they put in an unsuccessful appeal. The third umpire finds a big INSIDE EDGE on the UltraEdge. South Africa have exhausted all their reviews now. Fullish and close to off, Daryl Mitchell plays it nice and late and pushes it away with an angled bat to backward point. Edgy! Pitches it up and around off, at 126 kph, Daryl Mitchell gets forward to defend but it gathers the inside edge and rolls to mid-wicket. Goes very full with his length, around off at 125.9 kph, Daryl Mitchell drives it down to mid on. Serves it on a length and around off, Daryl Mitchell is solidly behind the line as he blocks it to safety. Last over of the day's play... Quicker one, full and around leg, Colin pushes it down to mid on. Loopy and full, around middle, Colin de Grandhomme presses forward and blocks it from the middle of the bat. Full and around off, driven down to mid off and Colin de Grandhomme wanted a run. He was sent back by his partner. EDGY! Keshav Maharaj bowls it slower through the air and gets good grip and spin. Lands it on middle, it turns away with extra bounce, Colin de Grandhomme wants to defend but it takes the outer edge and runs wide of first slip for a couple of runs. A flatter arm ball around off, at 90.1 kph, Colin tries to defend but gets an inside edge onto the pads. Floated and full, drifting in around leg, Colin de Grandhomme defends it back to the bowler. Fullish and on off, angling in, Daryl Mitchell forces it down to mid on. 2 more overs left in the day's play! A tempter from Lutho Sipamla. Delivers it on a driving length outside off, Daryl Mitchell presses forward and then allows it through. In the corridor outside off, on a length and holding its line, Daryl Mitchell shoulders arms after covering his stumps. Fuller and on off, Daryl Mitchell drives it back towards the bowler who makes a half stop.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/ql7ue67g_south-africa-afp_625x300_26_February_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Sri Lanka: India vs Sri Lanka 2022 Live Cricket Score, Live Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/india-vs-sri-lanka-live-score-over-2nd-t20i-t20-16-20-updates-2791810","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between India vs Sri Lanka from Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, Dharamsala.

But once the spinners came into the attack. Shreyas Iyer took the bowlers for a ride. The bowlers could not keep things tight in the middle and ended up leaking away aplenty. By the end of the innings, it also looked like Sri Lanka dropped shoulders in the field. In the end, they could not falter the Indian batting attack. Lahiru Kumara picked up a brace. What a brilliant show with the blade by Shreyas Iyer. He held the key for India during the chase and got his side over the line with the help of some knocks by Samson and Jadeja from the other end. India lost two wickets inside the Powerplay. One would've thought India would be in a lot of trouble with the ball swinging ferociously. But Shreyas Iyer applied himself really well and it looked like as if he was batting on some other deck. First, he built a solid stand with Sanju Samson to steady the ship and later, stitched another solid stand with Ravindra Jadeja to take a 2-nil lead in the series. OH MY GOD! What an incredible chase by the Indian batters. At one point, it looked like India would slip out but a stand of 58 runs off 26 deliveries for the fourth wicket, made sure to seal the series for the hosts.

Like elsewhere in the region, like Mohali, we use Bermuda grass.

We have about 64 per cent. In comparison, the pitch at Perth has 75 per cent!”, remarked Chauhan during an interaction with ‘The Hindu’ in 2011. As far as the boundary length is concerned, at 70 yards, it is bigger than the minimum requirement of 65 yards (59.43 m) on either side of the pitch. While the Midwicket to Midwicket boundary area covers a distance of 140 yards (128 meters), it is 120 yards (109.72 m) from one sightscreen to the other. Having said that, the boundary length may vary across either side (off-side and on-side) of the center pitch, given that matches may be played on different pitches situated adjacent to each other of the center one.

So stiff, a certain Mahendra Singh Dhoni missed out. It was the third edition of the tournament, which India went on to win, for the first time. In the 11 editions since, India has been the champion in four, the latest triumph coming early this month in Antigua. It has been the runner-up on three occasions and has contested the last four finals. Clearly, India is the superpower in junior cricket. But its campaign this time around ran into rough weather when five of its players, including captain Yash Dhull and vice-captain Shaik Rasheed, tested positive for Covid-19 during the tournament. That the Indian team overcame this handicap and went on to win the cup is remarkable. It also gives us a clue to the answer of the question: Why is India so good at junior cricket? If a team can cope with the unavailability of five players, including the skipper and his deputy who are among the side’s key batters, it shows not just character and resilience; it also shows the sheer depth of talent in the squad, and in the country. Coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar is justifiably proud of the way the Indian team survived the crisis and bounced back. “In all my years as a coach, of various teams, I had never come across a situation like this, when you lose five players — and important ones at that — at one go,” he tells The Hindu. “Yes, sometimes you lose a player or two to injury and that’s normal. But what happened in Antigua was a different experience that taught me something new. Quick decisions had to be taken.” Kanitkar, a former India batter, reveals that V.V.S. Laxman played a major role during that tough time in Antigua. The former Test star was with the Indian team shortly after taking over as the head of cricket at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). “After the players tested positive for Covid-19, a lot of things had to be done outside cricket, like all the communication with the ICC and the BCCI and I didn’t have the phone with me as I was not allowed to [as a coach],” says Kanitkar. “Laxman did all that, as even the manager was affected by the virus. He also did a lot of throw-downs for the boys — more than us — though he didn’t have to.” Kanitkar and Laxman go back a long way. They played together for India Under-19 on a tour of England. “The players of my generation didn’t have the kind of exposure that today’s kids have,” he says. “There wasn’t this much coverage of junior cricket either, those days.” Things had improved by the time Ajay Ratra won the tight race for the wicketkeeper’s gloves, ahead of Dhoni, for the new millennium’s first Under-19 World Cup, held in Sri Lanka. Twenty two years later, he recalls vividly India’s first triumph in cricket’s most important tournament for juniors. “It means a lot to me that I was part of the Indian team that won the Under-19 World Cup for the first time,” says Ratra, who like Kanitkar took up coaching after playing for the senior Indian team. “It wasn’t easy at all to make it to the Indian team that year, so I was happy when I was selected.” Mahendra Rajdev was a part of that under-19 selection committee. “Our job was tough, as we watched a lot of talented youngsters that season,” he says on the sidelines of the Ranji Trophy match between Kerala and Meghalaya at Rajkot’s Saurashtra Cricket Association Ground, where he is the curator. “I remember we had a lot of discussions when we decided on the wicketkeeper; apart from Dhoni, we had also considered Pallav Vora.” “And there was Pradeep Chawla, too,” adds Ratra. “It was a very good Indian team that went to Sri Lanka. We had players like Yuvraj Singh, Mohammad Kaif, who was the captain, Ravneet Ricky, Y. Venugopal Rao and Reetinder Sodhi. I had come across Yuvraj in the Under-16 section as well, as we were in the same zone; he was playing for Punjab and I for Haryana. He was a special talent blessed with great timing and hitting ability.” Ratra says the team was well-coached by Roger Binny. “We fielded the same eleven for all the eight matches in the tournament,” he points out. “Every player contributed and there were some unforgettable performances like the 58 off 25 balls from Yuvraj in the semifinal against Australia.” In that Australian side were Michael Clarke, Mitchell Johnson, Shane Watson, Nathan Hauritz and Ed Cowan. Graeme Smith, Brendon McCullum, Ian Bell, Jacques Rudolph, Marlon Samuels, Danish Kaneria and Albie Morkel also featured in that World Cup. Several of Indian cricket’s big names too have played in the Under-19 World Cup over the last couple of decades. The list includes Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, K.L. Rahul, Irfan Pathan, Shikhar Dhawan, Parthiv Patel, Cheteshwar Pujara, Prithvi Shaw, Shubman Gill, Piyush Chawla, Dinesh Karthik, Ishant Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson and Ishan Kishan. From this year’s World Cup-winning squad, Dhull, who made two hundreds on his Ranji Trophy debut, and Raj Bawa, who picked up a wicket with his first ball in First Class cricket, have already graduated to the senior level with ease. Not surprisingly, the Under-19 stars struck it rich at the IPL auction too, with Bawa and Rajvardhan Hangargekar being bought for ₹2 crore and ₹1.5 crore by Punjab Kings and Chennai Super Kings respectively. Delhi Capitals paid ₹50 lakh for Dhull, while Aneeshwar Gautam (Royal Challengers Bangalore) and Vicky Ostwal (Capitals) were snapped up for ₹20 lakh each. It will be interesting to see how these youngsters progress over the next few years. Not every star at the Under-19 World Cup has gone on to shine on bigger stages. “We have seen quite a few young cricketers failing to replicate their success at the senior level,” says Sujith Somasunder, former India opener who is heading education at the NCA. “Take the case of Unmukt Chand, for instance. He led India to victory at the 2012 World Cup. And everyone expected him to lead the senior Indian team, too.” He didn’t even make the team. A few months ago, he retired from Indian cricket, at the age of 28. “When there are big expectations from others, and from yourself, you are bound to be weighed down by them, when you fail,” says Sujith, who is doing his PhD in sports psychology. “It can be painful at any age, but more so when you are in your teens. We at the NCA are going to address the issue and we will prepare our trainees mentally, too.” The NCA, Kanitkar believes, has played a major role in India becoming the biggest force in junior cricket. “Another reason I feel is that our boys are very dedicated and want to excel,” he says. “The wide pool of talent, which you could find across the country, is a major factor, too.” The number of games, domestic and international, that an Under-19 player gets to play is another reason. The BCCI has built a strong structure for age-group cricket in the country. And how did the boy who edged out Dhoni fare at the 2000 World Cup? He had the highest number of dismissals (19) among all the wicketkeepers.

He hopes the openers give a good start. Informs there are two changes. Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, is in for a chat. He says they will bowl first. Mentions they just need to have the score in front of them, no other idea behind it. Says it does not depend on wins and losses, it depends on what the team wants.

PITCH REPORT - Ajit Agarkar says although it was raining for a long time, the ground staff have done a terrific job. Says the pitch looks in good condition and with lovely grass cover, the ball will come good on the bat. Deep Dasgupta adds the ground is longer on the one side and even the pitch looks good to bat. Ends, It will be interesting to see what the captains will choose. Sri Lanka need their batters to step up if they are to level the series. In the first game, it was only Charith Asalanka who got a good start. Although they do have an experienced bowling pack, they have taken a blow in the spin department with the loss of Maheesha Theekshana due to an injury. There might be some new faces in this game. The visitors have a poor T20I record against India and they would be eyeing to turn their luck around. Also, the conditions are overcast here so rain might play a part. But we hope that it stays away from the action. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates. With the bench strength that India possesses, their squad in the first game never looked like it was missing some big names. The skipper, Rohit Sharma used his bowlers really well and allowed Deepak Hooda and Venkatesh Iyer some time with the ball that did not go in vain. Also, the top order went all guns-blazing and would hope they continue in the same manner. Until Ruturaj Gaikwad is fit to play, we should expect the same 11 for the hosts. Hello and a warm welcome to the second ODI between India and Sri Lanka. The hosts have taken a 1-nil lead in the series. But now the conditions would be very different as both teams head to Dharamsala. India performed really well and got over the line convincingly by a 62-run margin. ...

He is leading Leatherback Giants in this competition. The team also has a slew of young players, including Sion Hackett, Christopher Vincent and Aaron Alfred.

Match: Leatherback Giants vs Blue Devils, Trinidad T10 Blast, 2022. Date and Time: February 26, 2022; 08:00 PM IST. Venue: Brian Lara Stadium, Trinidad. The track at the Brian Lara Stadium is well-balanced and conducive to batters, but pacers could see some movement with the new ball. Spinners could also hae some turn from the surface, especially in the second innings. So batting second would be a good idea on this track. Nicholas Pooran: He had a good time in the previous series, and is well known for his blistering hitting. Pooran has scored 433 runs in 17 T10 games at an average of 57.50. Lendl Simmons: He is well-known for his big hits, and has experience in the format. Simmons has 167 runs to his name in eight T10 games at an average of 20.87. That makes him a must-have in your Dream11 fantasy team for this game. Rayad Emrit : The experienced all-rounder has picked up 13 wickets at an average of 22.67 in 15 T10 games. Emrit could prove to be a valuable pick in your Dream11 fantasy team for this game. Sion Hackett: Hackett has looked in good form with the ball in recent games, and could be a key pick in your fantasy team. Namir Suepaul (LBG). Terrance Hinds (LBG). Amir Jangoo (LBG). Iraq Thomas - 238 runs in 21 ODI games; batting average: 14.00. Khary Pierre – 17 runs and seven wickets in 10 T20I games; bowling average: 38.04. Crystian Thurton – 85 runs in four games; batting average: 21.25.

The team are on a 10-game winning-run in T20Is, and will look to make that 11 when they face Sri Lanka in the second T20I at the HPCA Cricket Stadium in Dharamsala on Saturday. India swept aside Sri Lanka in the first T20I by a hefty margin of 62 runs in Lucknow. However, India's hopes of clinching yet another T20I series could be hampered by the forecast of thunderstorm and light showers in Dharamsala. As per Accuweather, Dharamsala is likely to experience rain around the afternoon and evening. The match could also be delayed due to wet outfield. The temperature is likely to fluctuate between 4 to 8 degrees. The forecast also predicts that the rain might stop by the time the match starts. However, there are some chances of a couple of afternoon showers. Accuweather has also predicted 82 percentage of cloud cover, with 81 per cent precipitation. Team India are on the cusp of joining arch-rivals Pakistan in an elite list of teams in T20I cricket.

The action now shifts to Himachal, Dharamshala for an important game as Sri Lanka need to win if they want to stay in the contest. There is only one department where India will look to improve, fielding. Ishan Kishan's astonishing knock of 89 was a big statement by the youngster. While Shreyas Iyer showed why he was picked in the T20 squad as well in the first game. Sri Lanka would be disappointed from their first game performance and they will be looking to start fresh in the second. With the series on the line, Sri Lanka need to win this one else they can also endup like the West Indies. The Dasun Shanaka led side came from different conditions, they were playing in Australia before this and didn't get much settle into the Indian pitches conditions. Sri Lanka got carried away with an inexperienced batting lineup as the target of 200 in the first game was a bit too much for them. While Lanka's bowling attack did show some good signs at the start but Ishan Kishan, Rohit Sharma and later Shreyas Iyer took them to the cleaners. To sumup, Sri Lanka would be hoping to get a better performance in the second T20I and not let India dominate them in all departments.

Today's weather at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala. Afternoon showers are expected to ensue quite a few times on Saturday, February 26 before the start of the match. This will make the conditions swing and help the bowlers as at times when it will not rain, the cloud cover would still persist. What is the pitch report for today's India vs Sri Lanka match? The pitch at Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala would definitely have more pace and bounce than what was on offer in Lucknow. It will be high scoring venue no doubt as the ball will come onto the bat nicely. However, since the temperatures would be down to single-digit from 07:00 pm onwards, the time of the start of the match, the ball is likely to swing in the initial overs as there would also be cloud cover.","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220226/thumb-122022600554.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli's 100th Test To Be Played Behind Closed Doors - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvdmlyYXQta29obGlzLTEwMHRoLXRlc3QtdG8tYmUtcGxheWVkLWJlaGluZC1jbG9zZWQtZG9vcnMtMjc5MDgyM9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvdmlyYXQta29obGlzLTEwMHRoLXRlc3QtdG8tYmUtcGxheWVkLWJlaGluZC1jbG9zZWQtZG9vcnMtMjc5MDgyMy9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli's 100th Test To Be Played Behind Closed Doors  NDTVSports.comIndia vs Sri Lanka: Virat Kohli's 100th Test to be played behind closed doors in Mohali  India TodayIND vs SL: Will crowd be allowed for Virat Kohli's 100th Test for India in Mohali?  Hindustan TimesVirat Kohli’s 100th Test match will be behind closed doors: Punjab Cricket Association  The Indian ExpressVirat Kohli's 100th Test to be played behind closed doors: Punjab Cricket Association  Times NowView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-26 08:30:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
