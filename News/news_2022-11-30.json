Fox has decided to end his year in Melbourne, in bayside Melbourne too, Warne territory, hoping he has enough juice in the tank to challenge for an Australian Open win that would be a fitting tribute to his great mate. As the Test season begins for the first time in nearly 30 years without Warne involved as a player or commentator, Fox conceded his world too was different now knowing those messages for a game, usually in London, would no longer come. But even the thought of those calls from nowhere brought a big smile to Fox‚Äôs face as he remembered what a ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù Warne, who loved telling the story of his hole in one at Augusta, was. ‚ÄúI mean, if you spoke to him enough, he was obsessed with golf. I think he‚Äôs a member of more golf clubs than anyone. He probably played more golf than probably I did,‚Äù Fox said. ‚ÄúAnd it was his competition. Obviously, (he) couldn‚Äôt give up the competition side of his life, and that was his competition when cricket finished.‚ÄúIt meant a lot this year to win at Dunhill, and I would have loved for him to be there. He absolutely loved that event. ‚ÄúLast year we finished second as a team and I‚Äôd birdied the last hole at Kingsbarns the day before to get us in the team cut and me in the pro cut and he was absolutely buzzing about that.‚ÄúHe was so excited to play on Sunday and we did have probably a few too many vodka Red Bulls that Saturday night, but he was just such a huge golf fan.‚ÄùMore than that, Warne was a huge Fox supporter, and as so many of Warne‚Äôs friends recalled upon his death, he enjoyed their successes too. ‚ÄúAnytime I did well on something I‚Äôd get a message from him and to have one of your idols do that was amazing. To be able to call him a mate was an honour,‚Äù Fox said. ‚ÄúIt was pretty emotional week at Dunhill, and I don‚Äôt know if I believe in that stuff, but I kind of felt like he was there somehow that week looking down, helping out.‚ÄúEverything just felt nice and calm out on the golf course. And that was kind of what he was like, right? No matter what was going on elsewhere, he‚Äôd get on the pitch and he‚Äôd just turn it on and that‚Äôs kind of what it felt like that week for me.‚ÄùThey didn‚Äôt often win as a pairing though, including in a showdown with former English tennis great Tim Henman on one of those occasions Fox was invited into the Warne world, that world where he knew everyone. ‚ÄúIt was always cool to get a message from Warnie when he was in the UK and say, ‚ÄòHey, I‚Äôm playing golf at Greenwood or we‚Äôre playing golf at Sunningdale‚Äô, and he‚Äôd ask me to join,‚Äù Fox said. ‚ÄúWe played Sunningdale with Tim Henman and another one of his good mates Terry Crawley (father of English batter Zac), who is off scratch, and Henman‚Äôs off plus four and me and Warnie got absolutely wiped, they hammered us.‚ÄúHe (Warne) always had a few bets going and he just absolutely loved it.‚ÄúHe had so much time for everyone and I experienced that first hand and I was lucky enough to be to be one of those people able to call him a mate.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-11-30 00:04:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs NZ 3rd ODI: Desperate India hope for full game in final match","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/30/ind-vs-nz-3rd-odi-desperate-india-hope-for-full-game-in-final-match/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"CHRISTCHURCH: Frustrated by the fickle weather, a desperate Indian team would pray for a rain-free final ODI against New Zealand in its bid to finish on an even keel in a series that neither had context nor any major takeaways.

There is forecast of scattered showers in Christchurch and nothing can be more irritating than playing a series where the Gen-Next of Indian cricket hardly got any game time to show their prowess. Out of five white-ball games that also includes three-match T20I series, two matches (one T20I and one ODI) didn‚Äôt yield any result and one game (T20I) was curtailed significantly and ended in a tie due to Duckworth-Lewis method. With the series in line, Shikhar Dhawan and his men would aim to put up an impactful performance at the picturesque Hagley Oval ground, which has traditionally helped the seam bowlers and has an average score in the 230 range in the past few years. The Indian batting in first Powerplay (first 10 overs) has been much talked about and even though skipper Dhawan has been a prolific ODI opener over the years, even he understands that to secure his place for the next World Cup, his approach needs a sea change. His young opening partner Shubman Gill, however, has shown more intent in shot selection with scores of 50 and 45 not out in the two games. So has Indian cricket‚Äôs current blue-eyed boy Suryakumar Yadav, whose three sixes in a short 12.5 overs of play at the Seddon Park, did send the Indian supporters into raptures. But the bigger challenge for Indian batting line-up will be to put up an above par score against New Zealand on a ground where swing bowlers have ruled the roost in the past few ODI games. And for that, not just the openers or Surya but the likes of Rishabh Pant also needs to step up and be counted. Rishabh‚Äôs ODI record is pretty impressive but currently, the runs have dried up since the tour of England (primarily in 20 over cricket) and he is one player, who needs to fire in order to ensure that Indian middle-order looks competitive against a quality Black Caps attack. Rishabh‚Äôs presence and lack of bowling options among the specialist batters also effectively mean that Sanju Samson has to once again sit out, like the last game where Deepak Hooda, because of his all-round skills, was preferred over the immensely popular cricketer from Kerala. Since the last match was a wash-out, it will be interesting if interim head coach VVS Laxman decides to shuffle with the playing XI, especially the bowling attack where Kuldeep Yadav is yet to get an opportunity. But to leave out either Yuzvendra Chahal or Washington Sundar will be doing them a disservice. Shardul Thakur looked pedestrian in the opening ODI in Auckland and, in all likelihood, Arshdeep Singh, Deepak Chahar and the fiery Umran Malik will continue to lead the pace attack. For the New Zealand pacers Matt Henry, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson, there couldn‚Äôt be a better venue to exploit the frailties in India‚Äôs batting to the fullest. Similarly, the Indian bowling attack would get a conducive bowling track to ask some probing questions to the likes of Tom Latham and Kane Williamson, who have proved to be the thorn in flesh during the last game.

Jammu pace sensation Malik is one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket alongside South African Anrich Nortje and Englishman Mark Wood to name a few, who regularly hit 150 kmph. Arshdeep is more of a swing bowler, who normally, when in rhythm, hits around early 130 kmph mark. Both the IPL performers made their ODI debut against New Zealand in the opening game in Auckland and the Punjab man wants the partnership to continue forever. ‚ÄúIt is always good to bowl alongside Umran and he is also fun-loving so the dressing room atmosphere remains nice,‚Äù Arshdeep said ahead of the third and final ODI against New Zealand, here on Wednesday. ‚ÄúAs far as bowling is concerned, I get a lot of benefit from Umran‚Äôs bowling as batters need to adjust heavily from 155 kmph to 135 kmph. And they get deceived by pace and we enjoy bowling with each other. I expect we are able to continue this partnership for longest time,‚Äù he said. Having made a name in T20Is, Arshdeep doesn‚Äôt want to change too much while playing the 50-over format. ‚ÄúMy way of bowling is attack at the start and defensive at the end in T20Is. Not very different in ODIs for me and wherever I get a chance, I will try to do well.‚Äù ‚ÄòFans have a right to criticise‚Äô Arshdeep in his short career has already seen the ugly side of fandom when he was mercilessly trolled on social media after India‚Äôs loss to Pakistan in an Asia Cup game in Dubai. A drunk fan had also abused him while he was getting into the team bus. But showing maturity beyond years, the 23-year-old said that he has learnt to take everything in his stride. ‚ÄúIf you do well, you get love and praise and when you don‚Äôt, the fans have the right to criticise us. They also love the game and the team. You will get love and brickbats both along the way but key is to accept both with equal humility,‚Äù Arshdeep said. Recently in Australia, he got a lot of support and there were quite a number of devoted Arshdeep fans, who would have his photographs printed on their T-shirts. ‚ÄúIt feels great to see (people wearing T-shirt with his photo) and pen lyrics dedicated to him but focus is always on the game, good or bad, one needs to conduct one‚Äôs self well,‚Äù he said. For him staying in the moment is the most important thing. ‚ÄúWhen you play the game, you want to enjoy rather than think that I want to be the main bowler of the side. You want to stay in the moment rather than think where I will be one year down the line. If you stay in present, it helps you as a player,‚Äù said Arshdeep, who has 33 wickets in 21 T20Is. About the rain-affected series, he said that some things are beyond anyone‚Äôs control. ‚ÄúWeather is not in our control and even during breaks one needs to be mentally prepared. We need to follow the process and there should be no let up in preparation,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄîPTI Umran Malik‚Äôs speed helps me to deceive batters with lesser pace: Arshdeep Singh added by Press Trust of India on 12:30 am November 30, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India ‚Üí Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-11-29 19:00:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"More players might give central contracts for T20 leagues, hints NZ pacer Southee","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/30/more-players-might-give-central-contracts-for-t20-leagues-hints-nz-pacer-southee/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Christchurch: The assortment of T20 leagues, including the cash-rich IPL has entirely changed the landscape of cricket with more and more players inclined to forego their national contracts in lure of lucrative overseas deals, feels New Zealand pacer Tim Southee.

There was a debate over who scored Portugal‚Äôs first goal in the match. In this context Adidas has ensured that with the help of technology. On the one hand, Ronaldo decided to celebrate scoring a goal. On the other hand, the referees ruled that it was a goal scored by Bruno. Some fans are calling this goal as ‚ÄòHair of God‚Äô. As such, Adidas has jumped into the fray and given the verdict. The ‚ÄòAl Rahla‚Äô ball being played in this series is manufactured by Adidas. Therefore, the company said that it was either Ronaldo or Bruno Fernandes who scored the goal with the help of technology. For the first time in the history of the Football World Cup, the ball being played in the current series is fitted with sensor technology. The technology is said to help referees greatly with VAR technology. It is reported that the umpires can detect even the lightest touches by the players with the sensor on the ball. Now it is confirmed by this sensor. A snicko meter determines whether the ball has hit the bat in cricket. That‚Äôs how this sensor works. When Bruno touched the ball it was clearly visible on the sensor. But the ball is neutral when it crosses Ronaldo. Adidas said it was Bruno‚Äôs goal. Adidas has announced that its technology [thanks to the sensor in the ball] has shown that Cristiano Ronaldo did not touch the ball on the Portugal goal.

The 19-year-old is looking forward to playing the historic Test series against England on home soil. The Three Lions have travelled to Pakistan after 17 years for red-ball cricket. Ahead of the first game of the three-match series, Shah discussed the upcoming fixture during a press conference. He seemed quite excited to perform in front of veteran pacer James Anderson and termed the English bowler ‚Äúa legend.‚ÄùWhile being asked about the reason behind Anderson‚Äôs long cricketing career, Shah showered immense praise on his dedication towards the game. The 40-year-old quick is going to appear in his 176th Test in Rawalpindi on 1 December. According to the youngster, it was only ‚Äúhard work‚Äù that helped him come a long way.Shah explained, ‚ÄúBeing a fast bowler, I know how difficult it is, so it is a massive achievement. He is a legend, and we can gain a lot from him. Whenever we meet, we talk about this. You can only guess how much effort he is putting in since he is still playing at the age of 40.‚ÄùThe reporter further probed the topic by asking Shah‚Äôs view on the ‚Äúpace vs skill‚Äù debate stating that Anderson still has the skills, even though his speed has decreased. Cutting short the question, the cricketer came up with a hilarious reply, ‚ÄúBrother, I only have 30 percent English.

He knows everything. He knows how to take wickets because he has played cricket everywhere in the world. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs one of the best bowlers in the world,‚Äù the Pakistan prodigy further added.At this age, Naseem Shah has already featured in 13 Tests and has fetched a total of 33 scalps. He earned his maiden Test call-up back in 2019 in Australia despite featuring in just five first-class games. His exceptional display of pace and swing during the T20 World Cup in Australia earned him much popularity. However, he only managed to pick up three wickets in Pakistan‚Äôs run till the final.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Now, the speedster has once again made headlines, this time for the startling revelations in his autobiography Sultan: A Memoir.The left-arm pacer‚Äôs book, which was released earlier this month, includes some explosive claims about Akram‚Äôs former teammate and current Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ramiz Raja. According to Akram, Ramiz Raja fielded in the slips only due to the ‚Äúrank‚Äù system. The Sultan of Swing, as Akram is fondly called, also lambasted his teammate‚Äôs fielding skills.Ramiz Raja and Wasim Akram were part of Imran Khan‚Äôs 1992 World Cup-winning unit and played together for over a decade.Describing his fielding skills in a Test against New Zealand, Akram wrote, ‚ÄúThe first over the next day was delivered by Asif Faridi, a local quick; I was thrown the new ball for the second. I was in my fourth over when John Wright, New Zealand‚Äôs captain, nicked to Ramiz at second slip. For all his batting kill, Ramiz was at slip for reasons of rank, because his father was a commissioner and because he‚Äôd attended Aitchison College ‚Äì he dropped more than he caught, frankly.‚ÄùThis is not the only shocking disclosure made by Akram in his. In his autobiography, the left-arm pacer had also slammed the attitude of former Pakistan captain Saleem Malik during their careers. Akram revealed that Malik used to treat him ‚Äúlike a servant‚Äù and made him clean his boots and clothes.‚ÄúHe would take advantage of my junior status. He was negative, selfish and treated me like a servant. He demanded I massage him, he ordered me to clean his clothes and boots,‚Äù Akram alleged about Saleem Malik.Malik has responded to the claims and added that he was trying to contact Akram to find out why he had written such negative things about him. ‚ÄúIf I was narrow minded, I would not have given him the chance to bowl.

However, the rain gods are showing no respite to fans as after the second ODI got abandoned in Hamilton, there is a very high chance that the final match of the series will also face the same fate.Notably, out of five white-ball games that also include three-match T20I series, two matches (one T20I and one ODI) didn‚Äôt yield any result and one game (T20I) was curtailed significantly and ended in a tie due to Duckworth-Lewis method.Once again, there‚Äôs bad news for cricket fans as the third ODI is expected to be marred by rain.

K Shrinwas Rao November 29th, 2022 17:30:21 IST The BCCI will sell the women‚Äôs IPL franchises and the broadcast rights by way of a closed bid. BCCI The BCCI, looking to auction five franchises for the upcoming women‚Äôs T20 league starting March 2023 by way of a closed tender, has kept the base price at Rs 400 crore (USD 50m approx.). The cricket board has arrived at this decision by taking into account the value of the costliest franchise that was sold back in 2007-08 ‚Äì Mumbai Indians at USD 111.9m (approx. Rs 446 cr) at Rs 40 / dollar. ‚ÄúThe benchmark had to be set somewhere and the BCCI had been gathering a bit of market intelligence on this, keeping in mind the demand and market interest,‚Äù those in the know of developments say. The Board expects the franchise to be sold between Rs 1000 and Rs 1500 crore, or even more, depending on the kind of interest the auction generates once the tender document is out. However, nobody is ready yet to speak about these expectations on record. ‚ÄúThe winning franchise will pay the ownership fees to the BCCI over a period of five years in equal instalments and continue to own the property for perpetuity, like in the men‚Äôs IPL,‚Äù add those in the know. If the value of the US dollar from 15 years ago is taken into consideration, the current base price (Rs 400 cr) set by the cricket board is slightly lesser than the value at which the costliest franchise (Mumbai Indians) was sold in the Indian Premier League (IPL) back in 2007-08 (Rs 446 cr / US$111.9m). BCCI could be looking to raise anywhere between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8000 crore. BCCI In doing so, the BCCI could be looking to raise anywhere between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8000 crore (in the range of a billion dollars) from the sale of these five franchises. Cricket board could be missing a few tricks The BCCI has asked the existing men‚Äôs IPL team owners to participate in the bidding but the tender process is open to any and all investors who meet the cricket board‚Äôs minimum eligibility criteria. There is no guarantee whatsoever that should the bid of an existing IPL franchise owner and a new investor match, any preference shall be given to the existing franchise owner. In doing this, the BCCI could be missing out on a few tricks. Here‚Äôs what some industry executives have to say on the matter: If men‚Äôs IPL franchise owners are allowed to bid for women‚Äôs franchises too, profits from men‚Äôs IPL can be reinvested in the women‚Äôs game. For a newcomer, this will clearly be a loss-making enterprise for a while. So, will it be sustainable in the longer run? By not giving men‚Äôs IPL franchise owners a preference, the BCCI is potentially losing an opportunity on the learnings that existing team owners have had over the course of time, IPs, operational synergies, the traction that can be generated from existing businesses that can be beneficial to women‚Äôs cricket and more. Long-term running of a franchise, ensuring good infrastructure, building of a brand, etc, can be done in a far smoother manner if existing franchises are involved. Further, as a reference point, BCCI can take into consideration that the English Premier League‚Äôs women‚Äôs leg ‚Äì the Women‚Äôs Super League ‚Äì has all 12 EPL club owners. In women‚Äôs NBA in the US, the existing clubs were given first rights of refusal in their region and when the women‚Äôs teams were handed out, four NBA clubs took the rights reserved while four other teams were bought by individuals owning clubs in the NFL. ‚ÄúThe BCCI should have a very strict and specific technical bid in this case. If an existing franchise owner and a new investor were to put in the same financial bid, the technical bid should allow the bidder with more experience in this space to prevail. It will be good for the women‚Äôs league on the longer run,‚Äù industry voices say. For the record, the BCCI will sell the women‚Äôs IPL franchises and the broadcast rights by way of a closed bid and not an e-auction.

FirstCricket Staff November 29th, 2022 14:34:09 IST File image of Mohammad Kaif. Sportzpics India‚Äôs quest for an ICC trophy got longer when they fell short in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup. Rohit Sharma-captained India were beaten by England in a one-sided contest in the last-four. Now, focus has already shifted to the ODI World Cup, to be held next year, in India. With that in mind, one aspect that is being keenly observed is the team selection. To make it an even more challenging task, the Chetan Sharma-led selection committee was sacked , and a new body is yet to be appointed. They will have the onus to select a group of 15-20 players who can end India‚Äôs nine year ICC trophy drought. But before that happens, former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has asked for players to be backed and patience from the think tank. ‚ÄúWhy is Bhuvneshwar Kumar not in the squad, I have no clue. He‚Äôs a good bowler, but not part of the squad. In the search for new players, we are losing out on the old ones. There‚Äôs a saying: in search of diamonds, we lost the gold,‚Äù Kaif said on Amazon Prime Video . ‚ÄúYou had good players in the squad so this shouldn‚Äôt be the case. If you‚Äôre backing someone, please do it nicely. The preparation starts from here, there‚Äôs no time for experiments. The months will pass, and suddenly you‚Äôll find yourself approaching the World Cup. So, you decide on the players and keep backing them,‚Äù he added. Kaif urged for Umran Malik to be backed especially after omission from the T20 World Cup. ‚ÄúUmran Malik, the extra pace that we often talk about, (Jasprit) Bumrah got injured at the T20 World Cup, there was no one with that kind of pace. The three pacers ‚Äì Arshdeep (Singh), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and (Mohammed) Shami all three of them bowl nearly at the same pace. In the World Cup, we missed someone, who can bowl 145 cases per hour. Someone like Umran Malik, definitely, back him from here on,‚Äù Kaif concluded. Read all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.
