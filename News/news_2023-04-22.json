FirstCricket Staff April 22nd, 2023 4:21:50 IST MS Dhoni at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai during Match 29 of IPL 2023 between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad. Sportzpics Chennai Super Kings (CSK) skipper MS Dhoni dropped a major hint over his future in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Friday, stating that he indeed was in the ‚Äúlast phase of his career‚Äù. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap‚Äã Dhoni made the statement that has since set social media abuzz following CSK‚Äôs seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. ‚ÄúAll said and done, it‚Äôs the last phase of my career, however long I play. After two years, the fans have had the opportunity to come here and watch, feels good to be here. Crowd has given us a lot of love and affection,‚Äù Dhoni said in the post-match presentation after Chennai collected their fourth win of the season in six matches. In his own style, @msdhoni describes yet another successful day behind the stumps üëè And along with it, shares a special Rahul Dravid story and admiration for @sachin_rt üòÉ #TATAIPL | #CSKvSRH pic.twitter.com/4gL8zU9o9v ‚Äî IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 21, 2023 Dhoni, who brought the curtains down on a glittering international career in 2020, continues to ply his trade in the premier T20 league and remains the undisputed leader of the ‚ÄòYellow Army‚Äô, whom he has led to four title victories. MSD had briefly passed captaincy to all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja at the start of the 2022 season, but eventually reinstated himself following a string a poor results. The 41-year-old additionally described his catch to dismiss his Sunrisers counterpart Aiden Markram as ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù given that he managed to pull it off despite being in an awkward position. ‚ÄúI was in such a wrong position. Just because we wear gloves, people think it‚Äôs easy. I felt it was a fantastic catch. Long time back I still remember one game ‚Äì Rahul Dravid was keeping and he caught one like that. Once you get old, that‚Äôs the only time you get experience. Unless you‚Äôre Sachin paaji and start playing at 16-17. Definitely old, can‚Äôt shy away from that,‚Äù Dhoni added in the post-match chat with Harsha Bhogle. SRH skipper Markram, meanwhile, expressed disappointment over the ‚ÄòOrange Army‚Äô getting restricted to a sub-par total and going on to suffer a second defeat in a row that has ensured they stay ninth in a 10-team table. ‚ÄúWe had the plans but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt execute them. It is about taking on the bowlers in the powerplay, we need to stick to our aggressive approach. We have to look in and see how to get better with the bat, one or two guys need to put their hands up with the bat,‚Äù the South African said. As for Jadeja, who bagged the Player of the Match award for his haul of 3/22, the plan at Chepauk was to not bowl too full and aim for the stumps. ‚ÄúComing to Chennai, looking at the wicket gives me a lot of happiness. You know it‚Äôs going to turn. I had in my mind to not bowl too full. Important to keep wicket to wicket. CSK fans always support us, no matter we win or lose,‚Äù said the left-arm spinner.

Kodwa was present as the City of Cape Town and Netball South Africa commenced its 100-days countdown to the Netball World Cup in July. The Netball World Cup will be taking place from 28 July to 8 August at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). Kodwa, who previously served as deputy minister of state security, was appointed as the new sports minister in March and succeeded Nathi Mthethwa. In his new capacity, Kodwa is eager to drive, among other codes, women's cricket as 2023 has been dubbed 'the year for women in sport'. \"Our support to all the federations was very clear. It goes towards women's development, whether it's cricket or whether it's any other federation that we support,\" Kodwa told reporters in Cape Town on Wednesday. \"We are very specific about it because women's sport is not getting supported by commercial partners as men do.\" In February, South Africa hosted a successful Women's T20 World Cup, with the Proteas women reaching their first ICC World Cup final. African champions Banyana Banyana will also compete in the FIFA Women's World Cup from 20 July to 20 August in Australasia. The national netball team will look to go one better than silver after finishing runners-up to Australia in England in 1995.

We need special moments. It's only sport that brings about special moments,\" he said. \"Since 2010, something has disappeared and that feeling is here, so we need to embrace the moment. \"Hosting and bidding is part of our central theme because, as a country, it not only gives us revenue, but also it takes South Africa across the Atlantic Sea,\" he added. \"Sport tourism is an economic driver in many countries. And in South Africa, hosting and bidding is but one of the things that we're going to emphasise on.\" ALSO READ | Plummer remains integral part of Netball SA's plans, despite World Cup swansong Zodwa wants to stamp his own authority in his new role and hopes to put an emphasis on development as he looks to the future. \"My emphasis is school sport and it is a foundation of a better nation. Most successful countries in sport have got a good foundation of school sport,\" said Kodwa. \"Some of the international sport personalities are a product of school sport. That's why even our national team's sometimes not performing well is because we have not built most. \"We are building the future. We are emphasising school sports because your best national teams will come from there.\"","pubDate":"2023-04-21 20:55:39","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/mi-vs-pbks-head-to-head-weather-report-live-streaming-tv-channel-ipl-2023-12488642.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season","content":"Cricket MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season Mumbai Indians vs Punjab Kings: Check out live streaming detail, weather report and head-to-head stats ahead of the MI vs PBKS match.

The 41-year-old additionally described his catch to dismiss his Sunrisers counterpart Aiden Markram as ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù given that he managed to pull it off despite being in an awkward position. ‚ÄúI was in such a wrong position. Just because we wear gloves, people think it‚Äôs easy. I felt it was a fantastic catch. Long time back I still remember one game ‚Äì Rahul Dravid was keeping and he caught one like that. Once you get old, that‚Äôs the only time you get experience. Unless you‚Äôre Sachin paaji and start playing at 16-17. Definitely old, can‚Äôt shy away from that,‚Äù Dhoni added in the post-match chat with Harsha Bhogle. SRH skipper Markram, meanwhile, expressed disappointment over the ‚ÄòOrange Army‚Äô getting restricted to a sub-par total and going on to suffer a second defeat in a row that has ensured they stay ninth in a 10-team table. ‚ÄúWe had the plans but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt execute them. It is about taking on the bowlers in the powerplay, we need to stick to our aggressive approach. We have to look in and see how to get better with the bat, one or two guys need to put their hands up with the bat,‚Äù the South African said. As for Jadeja, who bagged the Player of the Match award for his haul of 3/22, the plan at Chepauk was to not bowl too full and aim for the stumps. ‚ÄúComing to Chennai, looking at the wicket gives me a lot of happiness. You know it‚Äôs going to turn. I had in my mind to not bowl too full. Important to keep wicket to wicket. CSK fans always support us, no matter we win or lose,‚Äù said the left-arm spinner.

Kodwa was present as the City of Cape Town and Netball South Africa commenced its 100-days countdown to the Netball World Cup in July. The Netball World Cup will be taking place from 28 July to 8 August at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). Kodwa, who previously served as deputy minister of state security, was appointed as the new sports minister in March and succeeded Nathi Mthethwa. In his new capacity, Kodwa is eager to drive, among other codes, women's cricket as 2023 has been dubbed 'the year for women in sport'. \"Our support to all the federations was very clear. It goes towards women's development, whether it's cricket or whether it's any other federation that we support,\" Kodwa told reporters in Cape Town on Wednesday. \"We are very specific about it because women's sport is not getting supported by commercial partners as men do.\" In February, South Africa hosted a successful Women's T20 World Cup, with the Proteas women reaching their first ICC World Cup final. African champions Banyana Banyana will also compete in the FIFA Women's World Cup from 20 July to 20 August in Australasia. The national netball team will look to go one better than silver after finishing runners-up to Australia in England in 1995.

We need special moments. It's only sport that brings about special moments,\" he said. \"Since 2010, something has disappeared and that feeling is here, so we need to embrace the moment. \"Hosting and bidding is part of our central theme because, as a country, it not only gives us revenue, but also it takes South Africa across the Atlantic Sea,\" he added. \"Sport tourism is an economic driver in many countries. And in South Africa, hosting and bidding is but one of the things that we're going to emphasise on.\" ALSO READ | Plummer remains integral part of Netball SA's plans, despite World Cup swansong Zodwa wants to stamp his own authority in his new role and hopes to put an emphasis on development as he looks to the future. \"My emphasis is school sport and it is a foundation of a better nation. Most successful countries in sport have got a good foundation of school sport,\" said Kodwa. \"Some of the international sport personalities are a product of school sport. That's why even our national team's sometimes not performing well is because we have not built most. \"We are building the future. We are emphasising school sports because your best national teams will come from there.\"","pubDate":"2023-04-21 20:55:39","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/mi-vs-pbks-head-to-head-weather-report-live-streaming-tv-channel-ipl-2023-12488642.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season","content":"Cricket MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season Mumbai Indians vs Punjab Kings: Check out live streaming detail, weather report and head-to-head stats ahead of the MI vs PBKS match.

skipper MS Dhoni admits he's in 'last phase of career' after win over SRH Dhoni made the statement that has since set social media abuzz following CSK's seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. FirstCricket Staff April 22nd, 2023 4:21:50 IST MS Dhoni at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai during Match 29 of IPL 2023 between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad. Sportzpics Chennai Super Kings (CSK) skipper MS Dhoni dropped a major hint over his future in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Friday, stating that he indeed was in the ‚Äúlast phase of his career‚Äù. IPL 2023: Full coverage | Points table | Schedule | Results | Orange Cap | Purple Cap‚Äã Dhoni made the statement that has since set social media abuzz following CSK‚Äôs seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. ‚ÄúAll said and done, it‚Äôs the last phase of my career, however long I play. After two years, the fans have had the opportunity to come here and watch, feels good to be here. Crowd has given us a lot of love and affection,‚Äù Dhoni said in the post-match presentation after Chennai collected their fourth win of the season in six matches. In his own style, @msdhoni describes yet another successful day behind the stumps üëè And along with it, shares a special Rahul Dravid story and admiration for @sachin_rt üòÉ #TATAIPL | #CSKvSRH pic.twitter.com/4gL8zU9o9v ‚Äî IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 21, 2023 Dhoni, who brought the curtains down on a glittering international career in 2020, continues to ply his trade in the premier T20 league and remains the undisputed leader of the ‚ÄòYellow Army‚Äô, whom he has led to four title victories. MSD had briefly passed captaincy to all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja at the start of the 2022 season, but eventually reinstated himself following a string a poor results. The 41-year-old additionally described his catch to dismiss his Sunrisers counterpart Aiden Markram as ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù given that he managed to pull it off despite being in an awkward position. ‚ÄúI was in such a wrong position. Just because we wear gloves, people think it‚Äôs easy. I felt it was a fantastic catch. Long time back I still remember one game ‚Äì Rahul Dravid was keeping and he caught one like that. Once you get old, that‚Äôs the only time you get experience. Unless you‚Äôre Sachin paaji and start playing at 16-17. Definitely old, can‚Äôt shy away from that,‚Äù Dhoni added in the post-match chat with Harsha Bhogle. SRH skipper Markram, meanwhile, expressed disappointment over the ‚ÄòOrange Army‚Äô getting restricted to a sub-par total and going on to suffer a second defeat in a row that has ensured they stay ninth in a 10-team table. ‚ÄúWe had the plans but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt execute them. It is about taking on the bowlers in the powerplay, we need to stick to our aggressive approach. We have to look in and see how to get better with the bat, one or two guys need to put their hands up with the bat,‚Äù the South African said. As for Jadeja, who bagged the Player of the Match award for his haul of 3/22, the plan at Chepauk was to not bowl too full and aim for the stumps. ‚ÄúComing to Chennai, looking at the wicket gives me a lot of happiness. You know it‚Äôs going to turn. I had in my mind to not bowl too full. Important to keep wicket to wicket. CSK fans always support us, no matter we win or lose,‚Äù said the left-arm spinner.

Kodwa was present as the City of Cape Town and Netball South Africa commenced its 100-days countdown to the Netball World Cup in July. The Netball World Cup will be taking place from 28 July to 8 August at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). Kodwa, who previously served as deputy minister of state security, was appointed as the new sports minister in March and succeeded Nathi Mthethwa. In his new capacity, Kodwa is eager to drive, among other codes, women's cricket as 2023 has been dubbed 'the year for women in sport'. \"Our support to all the federations was very clear. It goes towards women's development, whether it's cricket or whether it's any other federation that we support,\" Kodwa told reporters in Cape Town on Wednesday. \"We are very specific about it because women's sport is not getting supported by commercial partners as men do.\" In February, South Africa hosted a successful Women's T20 World Cup, with the Proteas women reaching their first ICC World Cup final. African champions Banyana Banyana will also compete in the FIFA Women's World Cup from 20 July to 20 August in Australasia. The national netball team will look to go one better than silver after finishing runners-up to Australia in England in 1995.

We need special moments. It's only sport that brings about special moments,\" he said. \"Since 2010, something has disappeared and that feeling is here, so we need to embrace the moment. \"Hosting and bidding is part of our central theme because, as a country, it not only gives us revenue, but also it takes South Africa across the Atlantic Sea,\" he added. \"Sport tourism is an economic driver in many countries. And in South Africa, hosting and bidding is but one of the things that we're going to emphasise on.\" ALSO READ | Plummer remains integral part of Netball SA's plans, despite World Cup swansong Zodwa wants to stamp his own authority in his new role and hopes to put an emphasis on development as he looks to the future. \"My emphasis is school sport and it is a foundation of a better nation. Most successful countries in sport have got a good foundation of school sport,\" said Kodwa. \"Some of the international sport personalities are a product of school sport. That's why even our national team's sometimes not performing well is because we have not built most. \"We are building the future. We are emphasising school sports because your best national teams will come from there.\"","pubDate":"2023-04-21 20:55:39","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/mi-vs-pbks-head-to-head-weather-report-live-streaming-tv-channel-ipl-2023-12488642.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season","content":"Cricket MI vs PBKS Live Streaming, IPL 2023: When and where to watch the Match 31 of IPL season Mumbai Indians vs Punjab Kings: Check out live streaming detail, weather report and head-to-head stats ahead of the MI vs PBKS match.
