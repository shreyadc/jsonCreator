Whenever an ICC tournament starts, all the eyes are on the big guns like England, India and Australia, but New Zealand always sneaks in and plays a brand of cricket that impresses everyone. However, they have not been able to convert those performances into silverware. The Blackcaps are playing a lot of white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup, and they will be looking to go one step ahead this time around. Currently, they are playing the T20I series in West Indies, and the way in which they are playing on those wickets has been outstanding. Gary Stead hails the importance of Jimmy Neesham and Daryl Mitchell Gary Stead, New Zealand head coach has highlighted the importance of having great finishers in the side. All-rounder Jimmy Neesham has been excellent for the side in recent months as the finisher, and he has played well in the ongoing series against West Indies as well. Daryl Mitchell, who opened for New Zealand in the last T20 World Cup has also been given the middle-order responsibilities with Devon Conway going up the order. The emergence of Michael Bracewell has also been terrific for the Blackcaps ahead of the World Cup. Stead has called it a great luxury to have in the team. “It’s a nice luxury when you look around,” Stead said. “Guys like Jimmy Neesham, the way he finished that first game was fantastic, coming in and scoring 33 off 15. Daryl Mitchell showed his power in the second game, striking at 200 or a little bit more as well. We’ve got Michael Bracewell, who played the last game who adds power, and [we’re] yet to see Mitchell Santner.” Runs on the board in the 2nd T20I!

Phillips has been brilliant in the shorter formats, and he is now performing well in the international circuit as well. He has scored three fifties in the last seven T20Is. Apart from batting, he can bowl, he can do wicket-keeping, and he is brilliant on the field as well. “Glenn’s batting’s been fantastic, he’s got good power, but then you couple that with what he can do in the field, it’s pretty special as well,” Stead added.   The post “It’s a nice luxury when you look around”: Gary Stead hails the importance of Jimmy Neesham and Daryl Mitchell ahead of T20 World Cup 2022 appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-08-14 06:30:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Hat-trick hero King banishes Birmingham agony in Manchester","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/08/14/cricket-hat-trick-hero-king-banishes-birmingham-agony-in-manchester","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Australia's Alana King claimed the first hat-trick in the history of women's competition at The Hundred on Saturday, a fortnight after the feat narrowly eluded her in the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.

Northern Superchargers will be up against London Spirit in the league match of the Hundred 2022 at the Headingley Stadium in Leeds. London Spirit have won all three of their games in the tournament, whereas the Superchargers have won one of their three games. The batters of the London Spirit are in fine form with the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Kieron Pollard and Eoin Morgan, whereas the bowling has been led by Jordan Thompson. This team is playing well above the expectations. Northern Superchargers, on the other hand, have struggled to get the results in their favour. The batting of the side is not performing that well, and the form of Faf du Plessis has been a bit of concern for the side. In the bowling department, they have some good names, but they are not able to take regular wickets. The Headingley Stadium in Leeds, which serves as the home ground to County side Yorkshire has been a decent wicket to bat on, and the history suggests the same as well. This ground has hosted some high-scoring encounters in the past. The batters will get the rewards of their stroke playing as there is an even amount of bounce on the wicket, and they can play their shots accordingly. With shorter ground dimensions, it is very easy to clear the ropes, whereas the outfield of this stadium is very fast well.

Northern Superchargers were up against Trent Rockets at this very ground recently, where the pacers of the Trent Rockets were at their best. So, it is a good batting track overall, but the pacers will be vital. The average 1st innings score in the 4 The Hundred games last here was 161 runs, whereas the average 1st innings score in the T20 domestic games played here is 179 runs. Both captains would be looking to bowl first upon winning the toss in this match.","pubDate":"2022-08-14 05:37:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after meeting PM Modi: Feels like entire country is supporting us - India Today","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvc3RvcnkvaGFybWFucHJlZXQta2F1ci1nZXRzLWVtb3Rpb25hbC1hZnRlci1tZWV0aW5nLXBtLW1vZGktMTk4Nzc4OS0yMDIyLTA4LTE00gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after meeting PM Modi: Feels like entire country is supporting us  India TodayCommonwealth Games Indian Contingent Meets PM Narendra Modi At His Home  NDTV SportsFor Indian women cricket's latest star, PM praise: 'peace of Shimla, smile of mountains'  The Indian Express‘Golden era': PM Modi on CWG accolades, India @75 and ‘power of tricolour’  Hindustan TimesNikhat gifts PM Modi boxing gloves, Hima gives traditional gamocha  The HinduView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-14 04:54:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How Smith can shed 'sellout' tag amid LIV links","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/golf/news-2022-cam-smith-branded-a-sellout-over-liv-golf-links/22c77708-8c57-4787-913f-247521a44b7d","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia's Cam Smith has been branded a \"sellout\" over links to LIV Golf, but there's one way he can turn it into a win.","content":"Australia's Cam Smith has been forced to battle hecklers calling him a \"sellout\" amid links to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series as he battled in the third round of the St Jude Championship . Smith shot a 67 in the third round to find himself tied for third spot on 199 with American pair Will Zalatoris and Trey Mullinax. He is two strokes behind the leader, J.J. Spaun (197) and one behind the second-placed Sepp Straka. Speculation is rife over Smith's future in the game, with the Australian widely expected to sign a reported $143 million deal with LIV, and his potential defection has not been lost on those in the crowd in Memphis watching him play.

Public opinion on Smith has soured drastically in recent weeks due to his refusal to shut down links to the Saudi-backed rebel tour, despite him winning his first major just a month earlier. While an official move to LIV Golf could see Smith officially made into a villain by the public, former Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor said the Queensland-native could potentially turn it into a win. \"There's no doubt there's a bit of reputational damage at the moment ... but I want to go in and bat for him,\" Taylor said on Nine's Sports Sunday . \"It's a lot tougher for the non-Americans with this LIV Golf. As an Australian golfer or a South African golfer, you've got to make the big move to the (United) States to become a PGA Tour regular. \"That's what Adam Scott has done, that's what Greg Norman did many years ago, so it's tougher for those guys to commit full-time to the PGA Tour when there's another option which is also talking about moving events to Australia. \"If Cameron Smith moves to LIV, yes there will be some reputational damage, but I think he can make it work for him. \"LIV are already talking about having three tournaments in Australia and the Australian golf tour is nowhere near what it used to be. This influx of money from LIV will be great for Australian golf. I'd love to see Cameron Smith buy into it. \"If I was his manager, I'd say, 'Well if you're going to sign up for this amount of money, put 10-20 per cent of it into Australian golf and buy in and get Australian golf back to where it used to be. \"If he does that, it'll be a win for him and a win for Australian golf. I think eventually LIV, the PGA, they'll get back together in some form or another and I think it'll be a win-win for him and Australian golf.\" Smith has so far shot down questions from multiple journalists regarding a potential defection, notably after his Open win last month, but said earlier this week that he is \"ready to cop some heat\" . \"That's just their job - that's what they're there to do. They're there to sell stories and I'm sure they've had a few looks at it the last few days,\" he told Sky Sports of questions regarding the LIV tour. \"You know I'm ready to cop some heat ... but like I said I'm here to win the FedEx Cup Playoffs -

He wrote on his social media pages that it was the \"one and only source of sports news!\" Gambling is illegal in Bangladesh and he was forced to cancel the deal after the BCB president, Nazmul Hassan, issued an ultimatum ordering him to choose between the national team and Betwinner. Shakib captained Bangladesh to seven wins and 14 defeats in 21 T20Is until he was banned for two years -- one of them suspended -- in 2019 after he failed to record corrupt approaches. Shakib, who also returned as Test captain in July, replaces wicketkeeper-batsman Nurul Hasan as Bangladesh´s T20 skipper.

Modi on Saturday hosted the Indian contingent at his residence to felicitate the players here. The Indian athletes produced a sensational show in Birmingham, claiming 61 medals, including 22 gold, 16 silver and 23 bronze. “The real assessment of this performance can’t be made with just number of medals, our athletes competed neck-to-neck. There may have been a difference of 1s or 1cm but we will make that up I am confident of that,” Modi said during his speech. “It is just a start and we are not going to just sit quietly, golden period of Indian sports is knocking on the doors.” “We have the responsibility of making a sporting system which is the best in the world, inclusive, diverse and dynamic. No talent should be left out as they are all assets.” While India produced a dominating show in badminton, wrestling and weightlifting, the athletes also did well in athletics, judo and lawn bowl, where they won India’s first-ever medal in the Games. “Not only are we strengthening the sports that we have been strong in but have also left a mark in new sports. In hockey we trying to get our legacy back,” Modi said. “Since last time, we have won medals in four new sports, from lawn bowls to athletics, our performance has been spectacular. This performance will help increase youth’s interest in new sports. We have to improve our performance in new sports.” The Indian team also won a silver in women’s T20 cricket which was introduced for the first time at the CWG. “Under Harmanpreet’s (Kaur) leadership, India has produced a fantastic performance in cricket. All players have done well but no one had the antidote to Renuka’s (Thakur) swing bowling. It is not a small feat to be the top wicket taker among the greats.” Modi also noted that the achievements of the athletes coincided with the celebrations of India’s 75th independence day. The felicitation program was attended by most of the CWG-returned athletes, including the wrestlers, weightlifters, boxers, shuttlers and table-tennis players. Modi also congratulated the chess players who competed and won medals at the Olympiad which was hosted in Chennai. —PTI ‘Golden age of Indian sports has just begun’: PM Modi added by Press Trust of India on 12:35 am August 14, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-08-13 19:05:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test cricket won’t die in my lifetime but who’ll be playing it, asks Ian Chappell","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/08/14/test-cricket-wont-die-in-my-lifetime-but-wholl-be-playing-it-asks-ian-chappell/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: Australian great Ian Chappell is certain Test cricket “won’t die” in his lifetime but wondered whether the best players would play it in the future amid the proliferation of T20 leagues.

The former Australia captain believed that international cricket faces a real challenge of retaining players in the face of rapid expansion of T20 leagues around the world. “(Test cricket) won’t die in my lifetime. But who’ll be playing it? That’s the big question,” Chappell was quoted as saying by ‘Wide World of Sports’. “If you haven’t got your best players, is Test cricket worth watching? The answer is probably no. Test cricket is a good game, but it’s got to be well played,” he added. Chappell also spoke about the issue of Chris Lynn seeking a No-objection Certificate (NOC) from Cricket Australia to play in the UAE’s ILT20. Lynn has registered himself as a marquee player in the ILT20 but will require a No-objection Certificate (NOC) from CA to play in the league, something he may not get as the Australian cricket board also runs the Big Bash League at the same time. Chappell said if he were at Lynn’s place he would take CA to court in the event he is not given an NOC. “To me, you then go back to the World Series Cricket days, where they took the board to court over restraint of trade. Is it a restraint of trade? “In Chris Lynn’s case, if he hasn’t got a contract with Cricket Australia or Cricket Queensland, what’s to stop him? If I was Chris Lynn and I wanted to play in the UAE I’d take them to court. I don’t think Cricket Australia would have a hope in hell. “It’s got to be a restraint of trade. You’re not contracting him, but you’re not letting him play either,” Chappell said. Coming back to the challenge cricket is facing, Chappell felt the expansion of T20 leagues at a rapid pace will cause huge damage to Test cricket and its future. “I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. For starters, if you’re being realistic you can only play Test cricket between about eight teams. “West Indies have got a problem because they can’t afford to pay their players. Sri Lanka have a reasonable infrastructure but big political problems, and South Africa is similar. Whoever thought of giving Afghanistan and Ireland Test status is off their rocker. But you know why it’s been done, it’s so those countries get a vote. “To me this whole issue has been coming for quite a while, and I have no sympathy for the administrators.” Chappell, who played 75 Tests for Australia, added, “I think a lot of the older players will get offers from that area, and that will be a real challenge for nations like Australia who have a lot of good players, and also for nations that can’t afford to pay their players the best rates.” “Then you’ve got the problem of the IPL franchises owning teams in different leagues around the world.

He was laughing and they weren't hard slaps but I'm not sure that it was entirely play-acting.

While the IPL is pretty unsentimental, there is loyalty towards long-serving players and I probably would have had a longer IPL career as a one-franchise player.

Despite having retired from international Cricket in August 2020, former India captain MS Dhoni continues to be part of discussions amongst his countless fans with the slightest of his mentions by a Cricket expert/ former Cricketer, or after any of his activities off-the-field, as part of his personal life. Recently fans expressed their joy, when Dhoni had, for mere few seconds appeared during the Instagram group video chat by the present Indian cricketers involving Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, and Suryakumar Yadav. Now, a recent, rare activity by the 41-year-old across one of his social media handles, has yet again garnered the attention of the fans, thereby making him the centre of attraction the entire day. Just a couple of days shy of the red-letter day on August 15, the entire country is celebrating what is known as the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav to mark 75 years of India’s independence from the British rule. The occasion has led to an initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has urged the citizens to put the ‘Tiranga’ (Tricolour) as the profile picture of their social media accounts between August 2 and 15. Following suit, MS Dhoni changed his Instagram profile picture or the display picture (DP) to the Indian Tricolour, with a quote written underneath it in Sanskrit which meant: ‘I’m blessed to be a Bharatiya (Indian)’. Thala logged in Instagram after one and half year just to change his Instagram profile picture into a Tiranga 🇮🇳 That’s the true Indian spirit. #MSDhoni pic.twitter.com/wTkU3DPq8I — Lucky Gupta 🇮🇳 (@theluckygupta) August 13, 2022 Logged in Instagram after two years – changed dp to tricolour – logged out A true patriot.

File | Photo Credit: MOORTHY RV Australian legend Ricky Ponting feels Mohammed Shami's strength lies in the longest format and there are better quick bowlers in India's T20 set up, weighing in on his absence from the Asia Cup squad. India have picked Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Avesh Khan and Arshdeep Singh as the three specialist fast bowlers with all-rounder Hardik Pandya being the fourth pacer in the 15-member squad. \"He's (Shami) been a very, very good bowler for India for a long time now. If you look at his strengths, his Test cricket is probably where he thrives the most,\" Ponting, a two-time World Cup-winning captain, said in the latest episode of The ICC Review. \"I think there are better fast bowlers in Indian T20 cricket than Shami and they've only named three (for the Asia Cup). So if there's potentially four named in the squad he might be the fourth man in.\" With Jasprit Bumrah and Harshal Patel nursing injuries, many felt Shami might be included to share the new-ball duties during the Asia Cup. \"I would think they'll probably only have the four quicks coming to Australia. They’ll still want to bring a lot of spin here even though the wickets are probably not that conducive,\" Ponting said. The Asia Cup will be held in Dubai and Sharjah from August 27 to September 11 and Ponting picked India as the favourites to win the tournament. \"It's always hard to go past India in any tournament, not just an Asia Cup, but I think every time we talk about the T20 World Cup which is coming up, I think that India will be right in the thick of it there,\" the 47-year-old said. \"Their depth is definitely better than the other teams and I think India will win the Asia Cup.\" Arch-rivals India and Pakistan haven't competed in a bilateral series for nearly a decade now. \"To be totally honest it's one that we've been starved of, haven't we … looking back the last 15 or 20 years,\" Ponting said. \"As a cricket lover like I am and a cricket observer, any time those sorts of battles come up it's almost always nice to sit back and watch because everything just goes up a notch, doesn't it? \"When I think about rivalries, Australia and England and Ashes cricket is the pinnacle I've always thought of for our Test match game. I'm sure India and Pakistanis will say the same about that and the actual rivalry would be the pinnacle of Test match cricket for those two countries as well.\" Ponting believes India have the depth to prevail over Pakistan. \"I'll stick with India to win that clash against Pakistan.

He was his country’s first Test captain, scoring a fantastic 121 against India in the drawn match at Harare. Thirty years later, Houghton, in his second spell as a coach of Zimbabwe, is ready to take on India with his new ‘fearless brand of cricket.’ Houghton, 64, took over from Lalchand Rajput and immediately produced the results. Zimbabwe secured its first ODI series over a fellow top-tier team since 2017 when it chased down 291 in the second ODI against Bangladesh. They also won the T20I series 2-1 for its first-ever T20 series win over a top-tier team. The Indian Express caught up with Houghton, who had probably played the best knock of the 1987 World Cup (142 off 137 against New Zealand), spoke at length about cricket in Zimbabwe, its decline, the future of international cricket, and the upcoming three-match ODI series against India.

What are your expectations from your team, and what kind of cricket do you want them to play against India? Let’s not disrespect the Bangladesh cricket team because they are a good side, particularly in white ball cricket. We are playing good attacking cricket. We are enjoying playing the aggressive brand of cricket, and it had led to some recent success. It will be a good test for us, considering the strength of India. The series will tell us whether we are progressing or if it was just a flash in the pan. Fearless cricket has become a new buzzword these days, with ‘Bazball’ in England being a trendsetter, you have spoken about instilling fearlessness in the Zimbabwe players. Can you define what precisely this fearless cricket is? I don’t set to relate what we are doing to what Brendon McCullum has done with England’s Test team. For me, fearless cricket is when cricketers express themselves in the middle, no matter who the opposing team is. Advertisement Zimbabwean coach Dave Houghton greets Bangladesh players on the second day of the One-Day International cricket match between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh at Harare Sports Club in Harare, Zimbabwe, Sunday, Aug, 7, 2022. (AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi) It worried me when I took over this side; the players I have seen playing some breathtaking shots in the local cricket were too scared to play similar strokes while playing for the national side. They were too afraid to play reverse sweep or improvise because they were worried about the repercussions of getting dropped in the next game. That was the fear that I am trying to get rid of. In cricket, you live and die by your success individually as well as the team. So that responsibility is still there, but they won’t be lambasted in the change room because they have played a rash shot. And if you are that fearful, you can never progress. So that is the fearlessness I am trying to instil in this team. What is the difference between fearlessness and foolishness, and how do you explain this to your boys? Advertisement There is a fine line. They will only learn the difference between fearless and reckless with experience. It is not what coaches have told you in the team meeting; one must use their senses during the game and learn from others, be it the teammates or the opposition. You’ve been involved with Zimbabwe cricket for almost half a century. From being a competitive side in the 90s, it declined drastically, and after that, they failed to produce players with the same skill sets. It was a very experienced team. A lot of the players played in that era, including me; we got to play more international cricket. We didn’t even have domestic cricket back then, other club cricket. We learnt at the international scene. By the time we got to 1999, and we had a couple of good additions too, Murray Goodwin coming back from Australia, Neil Johnson from South Africa. Shortly after that, players left the country; there was a collapse in cricket around 2003. A lot of people retired; some went off to play in England. And we had to start again. And in the restart, the board started first-class cricket, which is now known as franchise cricket. It took them a long time to start producing their homegrown talent. People like Sikandar Raja, Craig Ervine, and Sean Williams are the product of the aftermath of the collapse. From its traditional white strongholds, how far has the game spread to the average Zimbabwean? Now you can see the influx of young players coming through the first-class system. That’s the big difference between now and how it was in the mid-2000 and early 2010s. The late 90s side had a good 13-14 players, but there was no depth, and that’s why the collapse happened. But things have changed now. Advertisement T20 franchise tournaments have become the most preferred option for cricketers now. Do you think ODI cricket, the bilateral series, will soon be a thing of the past? Tough to guess. Everyone is guessing. But in my own opinion, I think cricket has almost reversed itself, instead of having so much international cricket throughout the year. I believe cricket will probably end up like football. There would be more franchise-based competition globally, and there will be only a three-month window for International cricket. Advertisement Can you name a few promising youngsters from your team whom you think are capable of playing in the overseas T20 leagues in the future? Wessly Madhevere: Top order batter, very, very exciting prospect. An all-format cricketer and he is only 21. He is a stylish right-handed batsman and bowls some decent off-spin, and is an excellent fielder as well. Advertisement Tony Munyonga: A right-handed middle-order batter, played a couple of brilliant cameos against Bangladesh in the recently-concluded series. He is a finisher, and I look forward to seeing him excel in that role. Blessing Muzarabani: We are without Blessing, which is disappointing. He suffered a thigh muscle tear during the ICC T20 Men’s World Cup qualifier. But a top-class bowler. Victor Nyauchi: Another outstanding seam bowler. Slightly wrong-footed but can surprise the batters with the extra pace and bounce.

However, he certainly believes some of the best players in the world will be lured to choose lucrative T20 leagues instead of the longest format of the game. With the announcement of two new T20 leagues to be played in the UAE and South Africa, there has been a huge debate over whether players will choose club over country. The decision of Ben Stokes to withdraw from ODI cricket and Trent Boult from New Zealand's central contract has given further air to this debate. Speaking to Wide World of Sports on Saturday, here's what Ian Chappell had to say about the future of Test cricket: Ian Chappell also spoke about the cricket boards like that of the West Indies, who have had payment issues with their players for quite some time now. The 78-year-old reckons such issues will always make it difficult for these boards to hold on to world-class players as they would often prefer to earn more money. On this, Chappell stated: Ian Chappell also stressed how the schedule of the aforementioned T20 leagues might clash with that of the Big Bash League (BBL) . In such a scenario, the Australian players will need to make a choice between the two leagues.
