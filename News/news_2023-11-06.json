On his 35th birthday, Kohli made an unbeaten 101 as tournament hosts and favourites India racked up 326 for five after choosing to bat at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens. South Africa’s powerful batting unit were then bundled out for just 83 - the joint-second-lowest total in their history - as left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja picked up five for 33, including the in-form Heinich Klaasen leg-before for a single. But it was Kohli who stole the show, equalling Tendulkar’s mark from astonishing 175 innings fewer, and earning a congratulatory tweet from the Little Master, who urged him to break the record ‘in the next few days’. India’s last remaining group match is against the Netherlands on Sunday, and they are now guaranteed to go through to the semi-finals as group winners. Virat Kohli hit his 49th ODI century as India thrashed South Africa at the Cricket World Cup Well played Virat. It took me 365 days to go from 49 to 50 earlier this year. I hope you go from 49 to 50 and break my record in the next few days. Congratulations!! #INDvSA pic.twitter.com/PVe4iXfGFk — Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) November 5, 2023 ‘It’s all too much to take in for now,’ said Kohli. ‘It’s a huge honour to equal my hero’s record. He’s perfection with the bat. It’s an emotional moment. I know the days I have watched him on TV. To receive appreciation from him means a lot to me.’ India don’t yet know the identity of their oppponents in the last four, with Australia, New Zealand, Afghanistan and Pakistan all in the mix as the tournament’s marathon group stage enters its final week. South Africa are already through. But the manner in which the Indians dismantled the biggest-hitting team in the World Cup - Marco Jansen top-scored with just 14 - has laid down a marker ahead of the knockout stages. And a nation of 1.4 billion will be demanding Kohli wraps things up with No 50.

Speaking after England’s elimination was finally confirmed by Saturday’s 33-run defeat by Australia in Ahmedabad , the 36-year-old Moeen said the time had come to move forward with a new 50-over team - and volunteered himself as one of the seniors to make way. ‘Everything good comes to an end, and maybe the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it as players because we thought we’d be performing well,’ he said. ‘But I just think everything good comes to an end at some point. ‘If I was in charge, I’d play the younger guys after this. I’d just start again, and I’m sure they’re going to do that. It’s common sense more than anything. You want that fearless approach back, and it’s a great time to start again. ‘I’m going to speak to Jos and Motty and see what they want from me. If they say “look, we’re going to go with younger players and start again”, then I’m more than happy. I get it.’ England vice captain Moeen Ali has admitted he may have to step away from England duty following the World Cup England's exit was confirmed after their defeat to Australia - their sixth loss in seven games Moeen said he will speak to captain Jos Buttler (right) and coach Matthew Mott (left) to see what their plans are for him going forward England’s next 50-over assignment after the World Cup will be a three-match series in the West Indies, starting in early December - a tour that includes five T20 internationals as part of the build-up to next summer’s World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean. And while Moeen agrees England must undergo a one-day overhaul, he believes many of the players who have underperformed so badly here in India will be in the 20-over party. First, though, Jos Buttler’s team must try to salvage the bare minimum from a World Cup in which they have lost six of their seven matches, most by thumping margins. They will look to beat both the Netherlands and Pune to guarantee qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy The 33-run defeat to Australia means England remain bottle of the group stage with two points And that means beating the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday and Pakistan in Kolkata on Saturday to ensure the top-eight finish that would guarantee qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Failure to reach world cricket’s second-most prestigious 50-over event will not help Matthew Mott’s prospects of staying on as coach, and Moeen admitted: ‘We’ve got to turn up properly as players. They are two massive games coming up. ‘I know how important the Champions Trophy is in terms of experience at a world event, especially with potentially younger players coming in. It’s very important we make sure we qualify.’ Asked if he could recall a tour or series where England had played so poorly for so long, Moeen - who took part in the equally miserable 2015 World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand - said: ‘No, not at all. I think in 2015 we didn’t expect to do much, but this one we expected to be in a better position than we are now. We’ve just been rubbish throughout – batting, bowling and fielding.’ Share or comment on this article: England vice captain Moeen Ali admits he may have to move aside and let the youngsters in after dismal World Cup defence: 'I'd start again and I'm sure they will do that' e-mail Add comment Comments 4 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Kohli's 49th ODI hundred paved the way for India's 326 for five on a slightly diffident Eden Gardens pitch, which proved way over the par in the end. \"If you look at how we have played in the last three games, we have adapted better. Today, we needed Kohli to go out there and play to the situation. We then knew we had to keep it in the right areas (with the ball) and let the pitch do the rest,\" said Rohit during the post-match presentation. Rohit was quite chuffed with the way middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer and pacer Mohammed Shami repaid the management's faith in this World Cup. Iyer made an outstanding 77 off 87 balls while Shami picked a wicket that swelled his tally in the tournament to 15. Rohit said he would have kept his faith in them even if they did not come out with such performances. \"Even if the faith hadn't been repaid (by Shreyas and Shami), I would have still stuck to them. We need to keep the trust. It can't be done every day. For Shami to comeback the way he has, shows the mindset. The last two games have shown what Iyer is capable of,\" he noted. Upfront, Rohit has made a riveting alliance with his partner Shubman Gill but the skipper said their aggressive approach was not premeditated. \"Gill and myself have been batting together for a majority of time now. We let the instincts take over. We don't pre-plan anything. We just assess and play accordingly,\" he said. Ravindra Jadeja too made a statement of his skills while making a quick 29 off 15 balls that gave India some late steam and then he returned to pick up a five-wicket haul (5/33). Rohit lauded Jadeja for his all-round effort. Advertisement \"Today was a classical case as to what Jadeja is for us. He came out at the death and scored vital runs. Then picked up wickets. He knows his role and knows the expectations from him.\" India have now won an unprecedented eight matches in a row in the World Cup, but Rohit did not give in for hyperboles. \"Not to get too ahead of ourselves has been the talk in the dressing room. We have a couple of big games coming up. We don't want to change anything.\" South Africa captain Temba Bavuma said his side failed to adapt on this day. \"We know the challenge, know the narrative around us while chasing. Didn't do it any justice today. When we talk about it as a batting group, gotta be honest,\" he said. \"The first ten overs with the ball made it a challenge. We did do quite well after that. Biggest challenge was taking wickets and India built big stands. The conditions are the biggest learning. \"Wicket played as we suspected it to play - expected it to deteriorate but we didn't adapt well. It will be up to us to adapt our skills accordingly,\" he said.

Jadeja said the Eden Gardens track offered more turn in the afternoon when the South African spinners bowled, compared to the evening when Indian bowlers operated. India's forever ‘Most Valuable Player' (MVP) himself left an impact on the game by scoring an unbeaten 29 not out and taking 5 for 33 but it was the peerless Kohli, who was adjudged the Player of the Match award for his record-equalling unbeaten 101. \"I think this will be very special for Virat himself. It was a very tough pitch and at times, it seemed that even 260-270 looked par,\" Jadeja said at post-match conference. \"He rotated the strike and at stage when runs dried up and their spinners were bowling well, to rotate strike and remain not out while taking score beyond 300, it takes effort,\" he said. The pitch, Jadeja believed, became easier for batting later as he tried to put Kohli's ton in perspective. \"When they bowled, there was more help from the track, there was more turn on offer and wicket didn't have bounce also. If you ask for my opinion, the pitch became easier for batting in the evening compared to afternoon, may be not easy but okay for batting. \"But in the afternoon, it was a slow turner. You couldn't hit big shots. Credit how Virat handled their spinners. We always had an idea that Kolkata is a low bounce track that aids spinners. We knew wicket would play slow.” Rohit's decision to bat first was a calculated one as Indian team wanted to assess how things may pan out if India play their semi-final in Kolkata and need to bowl under lights. \"We wanted to challenge ourselves, had we bowled at afternoon, we wouldn't have given so many runs. We wanted to see how we could bowl if dew sets in and if knock-outs, if we get such a situation,\" Jadeja said.","pubDate":"2023-11-05 18:39:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7ad1064d75bb534b4e548c821ed122bb","title":"Writing was on the wall – Moeen Ali accepts time is up on golden generation","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23903131.writing-wall---moeen-ali-accepts-time-golden-generation/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England’s World Cup defence is over with two group games remaining after six defeats from seven.","content":"Vice-captain Moeen Ali has urged England to rebuild their ageing team after the World Cup, claiming “the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it”.

Ashes rivals Australia became the latest side to turn them over on Sunday, finally confirming the early exit that had long been on the cards, joining New Zealand, Afghanistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and India in a growing list. England are knocked out as Australia continue their march towards a semi-final spot ⚡ 📝: — ICC Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) For the last three games England have fielded a side comprised entirely of over-thirties and prospects of a radical overhaul will surely prove irresistible. Back in 2015 Eoin Morgan led a similar renewal, strikingly calling time on the vastly experienced James Anderson and Stuart Broad. And Moeen, the oldest player in the squad at 36, realises that time has caught up with them. “I just think everything good comes to an end at some point,” he said. “Maybe the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it as players because we thought we’d be performing well. “I think if I was in charge I’d play the younger guys, I’d just start again and I’m sure they’re going to do that. It’s common sense more than anything. You want that fearless approach and it’s a great time to start again.” Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root are among the stalwarts who have publicly said they want to carry on in 50-over cricket, but Moeen appears ready to step away with no grudges. “I’m obviously going to speak to Jos Buttler and Motty (head coach Matthew Mott) and see what they want from me, whether they want me around or whatever,” he said. “I don’t know. If they say, ‘look we’re going to go with younger players and start again’ then I’m more than happy. I get it, I understand and like I said, everything good comes to an end at some point.” England could choose to start the regeneration process immediately, with Harry Brook (24), Sam Curran (25), Gus Atkinson (25) and Brydon Carse (28) all waiting in the wings in the current squad. Bringing Brook back into a top six that has repeatedly fallen short appears the most obvious move but England may find it hard to shrug off their conservatism by making wholesale changes against the Netherlands on Wednesday. The game in Pune is not only a must-win in terms of basic pride but also critical if England are to keep alive their hopes of finishing in the top eight and securing a place in the Champions Trophy in 2025. Buttler said he would need time to “digest” the latest defeat before making a call on team selection, but did not rule out another show of faith in the old guard. “The guys who we were selecting have been top players for a long time and time kind of says that at some point they’ll get back to being the best,” he said. Moeen, despite his readiness to slip into the shadows, stands ready to play if required. “Like always, you pick the best players who you think are going to win the game,” he said. “We obviously haven’t been playing well and I’m sure they’re going to talk and decide on who they want to play. We’ve got to turn up properly as players. These are two massive games coming up. “I know how important the Champions Trophy is in terms of experience at a world event because you get that experience for the next World Cup, especially with potentially younger players coming in. It’s very important we as players make sure we qualify.”","pubDate":"2023-11-05 18:07:00","image_url":"https://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/resources/images/17409918/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"southwalesguardian","source_priority":1703505,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"548a1c3d48e28fbfdb0ec5ab60d802a0","title":"Virat Kohli : मी त्यांना टीव्हीवर पाहत मोठा झालो, सचिनसोबत कधीच बरोबरी करू शकत नाही; विराट कोहली भावूक","link":"https://marathi.abplive.com/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-reaction-after-man-of-the-match-on-49th-odi-century-record-equal-with-sachin-tendulkar-1225844","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":["एबीपी माझा स्पोर्ट्स डेस्क"],"video_url":null,"description":"कोलकाता : क्रिकेटच्या मैदानावर आपल्या धडाकेबाज फलंदाजीने क्रिकेट चाहत्यांच्या मनावर विराट कोहली (Virat Kohli) सध्या राज्य करत आहे. मात्र, विराट कोहलीच्या मनात सचिन तेंडुलकरबद्दल (Sachin Tendulkar) प्रचंड आदर आहे. आज दक्षिण आफ्रिकेविरुद्धच्या सामन्यात विराटने 49 वे शतक झळकावत सचिनच्या विक्रमाशी बरोबरी केली. सामना संपल्यानंतर सचिन तेंडुलकरसोबत बरोबरी करू शकत नसल्याचे विराटने प्रांजळपणे सांगितले. विराटच्या या प्रतिक्रियेचे सध्या कौतुक होत आहे.  कोहलीच्या एकदिवसीय कारकिर्दीतील 49 व्या शतकाच्या जोरावर  टीम इंडियाने पाच विकेट्सवर 326 धावा उभारल्या. त्यानंतर दक्षिण आफ्रिकेचा डाव 27.1 षटकात 83 धावांवर गुंडाळत मोठा विजय नोंदवला. विराटने काय म्हटले? विराट कोहलीला सामनावीराच्या पुरस्काराने गौरवण्यात आले. त्यावेळी बोलताना विराटने म्हटले की, 'माझ्या हिरोच्या विक्रमाची बरोबरी करणे हा खूप मोठा सन्मान आहे. फलंदाजीच्या बाबतीत तो 'परफेक्ट' ठरला आहे. तो एक भावनिक क्षण आहे. मी कुठून आलो ते दिवस मला माहित आहेत, मला ते दिवस माहित आहेत जेव्हा मी त्यांना टीव्हीवर पाहिले होते. त्यांच्याकडून कौतुक मिळणे माझ्यासाठी खूप महत्त्वाचे आहे, असे विराटने म्हटले.  Virat Kohli said, \"to equal my hero - Sachin Tendulkar's record is an emotional moment for me.

South Africa was supposedly the stiffest challenge yet, the second on the points table, attack-minded batsmen and all-bases covered bowling bunch, yet they were rendered utterly wretched, hopelessly hopeless, so abysmally humiliated that it would a freakish conjunction of stars to stop India’s march to lifting the World Cup. Follow all the action from the Cricket World Cup 2023 on our special World Cup section. You can also find the latest stats , like the top scorer and the highest wicket-taker of the current edition, upcoming World Cup fixtures and the points table on the site. South Africa’s coach Rob Walters was at a loss of words to capture the excellence of India. “What should I say? All I can say is that this is a hell of a team. Hell of a team.” He was asked whether the pitch that offered assistance for the spinners surprised them. He thought hard and replied: “The scoreboard says it all. There are no two ways about it.” Advertisement The scoreboard, an old-fashioned manual one, read: India 326 for 5; South Africa 83. A 243-run victory in what was perceived as the biggest match of the tournament. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) Four weeks into the tournament, no box remains to be ticked; no base required to be covered, no force seemingly strong enough to stop them, no group driven enough to stall them. Their transformation was ludicrously swift and magical. A couple of months ago, even at the start of the tournament, no one expected India to be outright favourites. There were cracks and crevices, doubts about the form and fitness of individuals, suspicion of their combination. Yet in the space of a month, they have emerged as the most rounded, ruthless, and driven side. An unbreakable winning machine, functioning by an alignment of supremely-skilled cricketers at the peak of their prowess, feeding off their own motivation as well as riding the rousing support of the home crowd. No other Indian team has won eight games in a World Cup, let alone winning eight on the spin. No other Indian team, even the 2011, blazed the aura of fear and halo of intimidation than this team. Few other Indian teams had a readymade answer to every tricky question thrown at them. Few other teams in this edition have made winning look so effortless, or executed their plans as clinically as the merry band of Rohit Sharma . View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) The punches India flung were so powerful that South Africa were knocked out several times in the Eden ring. But mercilessly, India pulled them again to feet and shower more blows on their already battered minds. Also Read | World Cup: Why Virat Kohli is king of the 50-over game First was Rohit, who launched an unabashed assault on their new-ball pair, Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen. The Indian captain knew that the pitch would be difficult to bat on after the new ball loses its sheen and the spinners stride in. So Rohit threw caution to the wind, taking India to 61 runs in five overs. The onslaught was not preplanned but instinctive, he would say during the presentation. He departed, but Kohli and Gill sustained the momentum till the 10th over. Keshav Maharaj produced a ripper made in left-arm spinner’s heaven that castled Gill. The ball had begun to rip, grip and turn. But no situation flusters them. Advertisement But so experienced is the batting, so deep their understanding of the game so prepared are they with the plans that they know the right responses. So Virat Kohli dropped the anchor, sucking the blood out of South Africa’s resolve, drop by drop, leaving them lifeless. Shreyas Iyer played along, stifling his attacking impulses, but not out of fear but retreating only to leap longer and further. The early storm weathered, he became the storm himself, whipping fear and fury. The first 34 balls yielded 11 runs. In the next 53 balls, he cracked 66 on a track where Maharaj extracted staggering side-spin, where the odd ball spat viciously. Kohli would play the selfless side-kick role. He bit his ego, eschewed the big shots and calmly dragged them along. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) He would later dwell on the game-situation simulation during the nets. “We had a lot of practice sessions before the Asia Cup. In those sessions Shreyas and I invariably batted together, because we knew we were Nos 3 and 4. In the middle I told him,‘This is the partnership, this is the partnership.” This was the partnership. They added 134 runs, 51 runs more than South Africa mustered. Ravindra Jadeja ’s late blitz stormed India to a total their opponent coach reckoned was “at least 70-80 runs more than we had thought.” Most Read 1 When Gulzar sat silently with Tabu for one hour, offered her Maachis after that: ‘This relationship impacted my life the most’ 2 New Zealand vs Pakistan, World Cup 2023 Highlights: Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam take PAK to 21-run win via DLS method 3 ‘I want to have the same things these guys are having’: Wasim Akram slams Hasan Raza’s statement on Indian bowlers being given different balls to bowl 4 Sunny Deol says he doesn’t like how Shah Rukh Khan has turned actors into a ‘commodity’, Salman has made them into ‘bodybuilders’ 5 Around Town: This 87-year-old restaurant in Mumbai continues to be a favourite of politicians, officers of Customs and narcotics bureau See More The chase was over before it even began. It’s now an inevitability — India’s seamers running the top-order ragged, making them see sixes and sevens. This was a batting line-up that has stacked five 350-plus totals in the previous seven games. But here, they were ruthlessly dismembered. Just 10 balls into the game, Mohammed Siraj disarrayed the stumps of the highest run-getter of the series, Quinton de Kock. His captain and opening partner, Temba Bavuma would not last long. Half an hour later, the match was effectively over, with South Africa losing the top six for 59 runs. There is no respite, or breathing space. Threat comes in various forms. You endure the seamers, the spinners would chasten you. Sharma introduced Jadeja as early as ninth over, and by the time he was into his ninth over, he had five wickets to his name. With the ball spinning —not as much as it did in daylight —Jadeja did Jadeja things. He would land the ball on length within the stumps and spin it either way, mix the pace, shuffle the trajectories and points of release. Three of his wickets were bowleds; one was leg before the wicket. His all-rounder performance could go unnoticed and unsung, but Rohit would praise him: “Jadeja has been really good. Big match-winner. He keeps doing the job, goes under the radar but today is a classic case of what he does – score late runs and take wickets.” Also Read ‘I hope you go from 49 to 50 and break my record’: Sachin Tendulkar react... ‘Human rights or 2 points’: Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq takes a dig at Au...

This is a team that is hitting higher notes with every game.

On his 35th birthday, Kohli made an unbeaten 101 as tournament hosts and favourites India racked up 326 for five after choosing to bat at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens. South Africa’s powerful batting unit were then bundled out for just 83 - the joint-second-lowest total in their history - as left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja picked up five for 33, including the in-form Heinich Klaasen leg-before for a single. But it was Kohli who stole the show, equalling Tendulkar’s mark from astonishing 175 innings fewer, and earning a congratulatory tweet from the Little Master, who urged him to break the record ‘in the next few days’. India’s last remaining group match is against the Netherlands on Sunday, and they are now guaranteed to go through to the semi-finals as group winners.

To receive appreciation from him means a lot to me.’ India don’t yet know the identity of their oppponents in the last four, with Australia, New Zealand, Afghanistan and Pakistan all in the mix as the tournament’s marathon group stage enters its final week. South Africa are already through. But the manner in which the Indians dismantled the biggest-hitting team in the World Cup - Marco Jansen top-scored with just 14 - has laid down a marker ahead of the knockout stages. And a nation of 1.4 billion will be demanding Kohli wraps things up with No 50.

Speaking after England’s elimination was finally confirmed by Saturday’s 33-run defeat by Australia in Ahmedabad , the 36-year-old Moeen said the time had come to move forward with a new 50-over team - and volunteered himself as one of the seniors to make way. ‘Everything good comes to an end, and maybe the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it as players because we thought we’d be performing well,’ he said. ‘But I just think everything good comes to an end at some point. ‘If I was in charge, I’d play the younger guys after this. I’d just start again, and I’m sure they’re going to do that. It’s common sense more than anything. You want that fearless approach back, and it’s a great time to start again. ‘I’m going to speak to Jos and Motty and see what they want from me. If they say “look, we’re going to go with younger players and start again”, then I’m more than happy. I get it.’ England vice captain Moeen Ali has admitted he may have to step away from England duty following the World Cup England's exit was confirmed after their defeat to Australia - their sixth loss in seven games Moeen said he will speak to captain Jos Buttler (right) and coach Matthew Mott (left) to see what their plans are for him going forward England’s next 50-over assignment after the World Cup will be a three-match series in the West Indies, starting in early December - a tour that includes five T20 internationals as part of the build-up to next summer’s World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean. And while Moeen agrees England must undergo a one-day overhaul, he believes many of the players who have underperformed so badly here in India will be in the 20-over party. First, though, Jos Buttler’s team must try to salvage the bare minimum from a World Cup in which they have lost six of their seven matches, most by thumping margins. They will look to beat both the Netherlands and Pune to guarantee qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy The 33-run defeat to Australia means England remain bottle of the group stage with two points And that means beating the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday and Pakistan in Kolkata on Saturday to ensure the top-eight finish that would guarantee qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Failure to reach world cricket’s second-most prestigious 50-over event will not help Matthew Mott’s prospects of staying on as coach, and Moeen admitted: ‘We’ve got to turn up properly as players. They are two massive games coming up. ‘I know how important the Champions Trophy is in terms of experience at a world event, especially with potentially younger players coming in. It’s very important we make sure we qualify.’ Asked if he could recall a tour or series where England had played so poorly for so long, Moeen - who took part in the equally miserable 2015 World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand - said: ‘No, not at all. I think in 2015 we didn’t expect to do much, but this one we expected to be in a better position than we are now.

Kohli's 49th ODI hundred paved the way for India's 326 for five on a slightly diffident Eden Gardens pitch, which proved way over the par in the end. \"If you look at how we have played in the last three games, we have adapted better. Today, we needed Kohli to go out there and play to the situation. We then knew we had to keep it in the right areas (with the ball) and let the pitch do the rest,\" said Rohit during the post-match presentation. Rohit was quite chuffed with the way middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer and pacer Mohammed Shami repaid the management's faith in this World Cup. Iyer made an outstanding 77 off 87 balls while Shami picked a wicket that swelled his tally in the tournament to 15. Rohit said he would have kept his faith in them even if they did not come out with such performances. \"Even if the faith hadn't been repaid (by Shreyas and Shami), I would have still stuck to them. We need to keep the trust. It can't be done every day. For Shami to comeback the way he has, shows the mindset. The last two games have shown what Iyer is capable of,\" he noted. Upfront, Rohit has made a riveting alliance with his partner Shubman Gill but the skipper said their aggressive approach was not premeditated. \"Gill and myself have been batting together for a majority of time now. We let the instincts take over. We don't pre-plan anything. We just assess and play accordingly,\" he said. Ravindra Jadeja too made a statement of his skills while making a quick 29 off 15 balls that gave India some late steam and then he returned to pick up a five-wicket haul (5/33). Rohit lauded Jadeja for his all-round effort. Advertisement \"Today was a classical case as to what Jadeja is for us. He came out at the death and scored vital runs. Then picked up wickets. He knows his role and knows the expectations from him.\" India have now won an unprecedented eight matches in a row in the World Cup, but Rohit did not give in for hyperboles. \"Not to get too ahead of ourselves has been the talk in the dressing room. We have a couple of big games coming up. We don't want to change anything.\" South Africa captain Temba Bavuma said his side failed to adapt on this day. \"We know the challenge, know the narrative around us while chasing. Didn't do it any justice today. When we talk about it as a batting group, gotta be honest,\" he said. \"The first ten overs with the ball made it a challenge. We did do quite well after that. Biggest challenge was taking wickets and India built big stands. The conditions are the biggest learning. \"Wicket played as we suspected it to play - expected it to deteriorate but we didn't adapt well. It will be up to us to adapt our skills accordingly,\" he said.

Jadeja said the Eden Gardens track offered more turn in the afternoon when the South African spinners bowled, compared to the evening when Indian bowlers operated. India's forever ‘Most Valuable Player' (MVP) himself left an impact on the game by scoring an unbeaten 29 not out and taking 5 for 33 but it was the peerless Kohli, who was adjudged the Player of the Match award for his record-equalling unbeaten 101. \"I think this will be very special for Virat himself. It was a very tough pitch and at times, it seemed that even 260-270 looked par,\" Jadeja said at post-match conference. \"He rotated the strike and at stage when runs dried up and their spinners were bowling well, to rotate strike and remain not out while taking score beyond 300, it takes effort,\" he said. The pitch, Jadeja believed, became easier for batting later as he tried to put Kohli's ton in perspective. \"When they bowled, there was more help from the track, there was more turn on offer and wicket didn't have bounce also. If you ask for my opinion, the pitch became easier for batting in the evening compared to afternoon, may be not easy but okay for batting. \"But in the afternoon, it was a slow turner. You couldn't hit big shots. Credit how Virat handled their spinners. We always had an idea that Kolkata is a low bounce track that aids spinners. We knew wicket would play slow.” Rohit's decision to bat first was a calculated one as Indian team wanted to assess how things may pan out if India play their semi-final in Kolkata and need to bowl under lights. \"We wanted to challenge ourselves, had we bowled at afternoon, we wouldn't have given so many runs. We wanted to see how we could bowl if dew sets in and if knock-outs, if we get such a situation,\" Jadeja said.","pubDate":"2023-11-05 18:39:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7ad1064d75bb534b4e548c821ed122bb","title":"Writing was on the wall – Moeen Ali accepts time is up on golden generation","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23903131.writing-wall---moeen-ali-accepts-time-golden-generation/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England’s World Cup defence is over with two group games remaining after six defeats from seven.","content":"Vice-captain Moeen Ali has urged England to rebuild their ageing team after the World Cup, claiming “the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it”.

And Moeen, the oldest player in the squad at 36, realises that time has caught up with them. “I just think everything good comes to an end at some point,” he said. “Maybe the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it as players because we thought we’d be performing well. “I think if I was in charge I’d play the younger guys, I’d just start again and I’m sure they’re going to do that. It’s common sense more than anything. You want that fearless approach and it’s a great time to start again.” Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root are among the stalwarts who have publicly said they want to carry on in 50-over cricket, but Moeen appears ready to step away with no grudges. “I’m obviously going to speak to Jos Buttler and Motty (head coach Matthew Mott) and see what they want from me, whether they want me around or whatever,” he said. “I don’t know. If they say, ‘look we’re going to go with younger players and start again’ then I’m more than happy. I get it, I understand and like I said, everything good comes to an end at some point.” England could choose to start the regeneration process immediately, with Harry Brook (24), Sam Curran (25), Gus Atkinson (25) and Brydon Carse (28) all waiting in the wings in the current squad. Bringing Brook back into a top six that has repeatedly fallen short appears the most obvious move but England may find it hard to shrug off their conservatism by making wholesale changes against the Netherlands on Wednesday. The game in Pune is not only a must-win in terms of basic pride but also critical if England are to keep alive their hopes of finishing in the top eight and securing a place in the Champions Trophy in 2025. Buttler said he would need time to “digest” the latest defeat before making a call on team selection, but did not rule out another show of faith in the old guard. “The guys who we were selecting have been top players for a long time and time kind of says that at some point they’ll get back to being the best,” he said. Moeen, despite his readiness to slip into the shadows, stands ready to play if required. “Like always, you pick the best players who you think are going to win the game,” he said. “We obviously haven’t been playing well and I’m sure they’re going to talk and decide on who they want to play.

South Africa was supposedly the stiffest challenge yet, the second on the points table, attack-minded batsmen and all-bases covered bowling bunch, yet they were rendered utterly wretched, hopelessly hopeless, so abysmally humiliated that it would a freakish conjunction of stars to stop India’s march to lifting the World Cup.

You can also find the latest stats , like the top scorer and the highest wicket-taker of the current edition, upcoming World Cup fixtures and the points table on the site. South Africa’s coach Rob Walters was at a loss of words to capture the excellence of India. “What should I say? All I can say is that this is a hell of a team. Hell of a team.” He was asked whether the pitch that offered assistance for the spinners surprised them. He thought hard and replied: “The scoreboard says it all. There are no two ways about it.” Advertisement The scoreboard, an old-fashioned manual one, read: India 326 for 5; South Africa 83. A 243-run victory in what was perceived as the biggest match of the tournament. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) Four weeks into the tournament, no box remains to be ticked; no base required to be covered, no force seemingly strong enough to stop them, no group driven enough to stall them. Their transformation was ludicrously swift and magical. A couple of months ago, even at the start of the tournament, no one expected India to be outright favourites. There were cracks and crevices, doubts about the form and fitness of individuals, suspicion of their combination. Yet in the space of a month, they have emerged as the most rounded, ruthless, and driven side. An unbreakable winning machine, functioning by an alignment of supremely-skilled cricketers at the peak of their prowess, feeding off their own motivation as well as riding the rousing support of the home crowd. No other Indian team has won eight games in a World Cup, let alone winning eight on the spin. No other Indian team, even the 2011, blazed the aura of fear and halo of intimidation than this team. Few other Indian teams had a readymade answer to every tricky question thrown at them. Few other teams in this edition have made winning look so effortless, or executed their plans as clinically as the merry band of Rohit Sharma . View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) The punches India flung were so powerful that South Africa were knocked out several times in the Eden ring. But mercilessly, India pulled them again to feet and shower more blows on their already battered minds. Also Read | World Cup: Why Virat Kohli is king of the 50-over game First was Rohit, who launched an unabashed assault on their new-ball pair, Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen. The Indian captain knew that the pitch would be difficult to bat on after the new ball loses its sheen and the spinners stride in. So Rohit threw caution to the wind, taking India to 61 runs in five overs. The onslaught was not preplanned but instinctive, he would say during the presentation. He departed, but Kohli and Gill sustained the momentum till the 10th over. Keshav Maharaj produced a ripper made in left-arm spinner’s heaven that castled Gill. The ball had begun to rip, grip and turn. But no situation flusters them. Advertisement But so experienced is the batting, so deep their understanding of the game so prepared are they with the plans that they know the right responses. So Virat Kohli dropped the anchor, sucking the blood out of South Africa’s resolve, drop by drop, leaving them lifeless. Shreyas Iyer played along, stifling his attacking impulses, but not out of fear but retreating only to leap longer and further. The early storm weathered, he became the storm himself, whipping fear and fury. The first 34 balls yielded 11 runs. In the next 53 balls, he cracked 66 on a track where Maharaj extracted staggering side-spin, where the odd ball spat viciously. Kohli would play the selfless side-kick role. He bit his ego, eschewed the big shots and calmly dragged them along. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ICC (@icc) He would later dwell on the game-situation simulation during the nets. “We had a lot of practice sessions before the Asia Cup. In those sessions Shreyas and I invariably batted together, because we knew we were Nos 3 and 4. In the middle I told him,‘This is the partnership, this is the partnership.” This was the partnership. They added 134 runs, 51 runs more than South Africa mustered. Ravindra Jadeja ’s late blitz stormed India to a total their opponent coach reckoned was “at least 70-80 runs more than we had thought.” Most Read 1 When Gulzar sat silently with Tabu for one hour, offered her Maachis after that: ‘This relationship impacted my life the most’ 2 New Zealand vs Pakistan, World Cup 2023 Highlights: Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam take PAK to 21-run win via DLS method 3 ‘I want to have the same things these guys are having’: Wasim Akram slams Hasan Raza’s statement on Indian bowlers being given different balls to bowl 4 Sunny Deol says he doesn’t like how Shah Rukh Khan has turned actors into a ‘commodity’, Salman has made them into ‘bodybuilders’ 5 Around Town: This 87-year-old restaurant in Mumbai continues to be a favourite of politicians, officers of Customs and narcotics bureau See More The chase was over before it even began. It’s now an inevitability — India’s seamers running the top-order ragged, making them see sixes and sevens. This was a batting line-up that has stacked five 350-plus totals in the previous seven games. But here, they were ruthlessly dismembered. Just 10 balls into the game, Mohammed Siraj disarrayed the stumps of the highest run-getter of the series, Quinton de Kock. His captain and opening partner, Temba Bavuma would not last long. Half an hour later, the match was effectively over, with South Africa losing the top six for 59 runs. There is no respite, or breathing space. Threat comes in various forms. You endure the seamers, the spinners would chasten you. Sharma introduced Jadeja as early as ninth over, and by the time he was into his ninth over, he had five wickets to his name. With the ball spinning —not as much as it did in daylight —Jadeja did Jadeja things. He would land the ball on length within the stumps and spin it either way, mix the pace, shuffle the trajectories and points of release. Three of his wickets were bowleds; one was leg before the wicket. His all-rounder performance could go unnoticed and unsung, but Rohit would praise him: “Jadeja has been really good. Big match-winner. He keeps doing the job, goes under the radar but today is a classic case of what he does – score late runs and take wickets.” Also Read ‘I hope you go from 49 to 50 and break my record’: Sachin Tendulkar react... ‘Human rights or 2 points’: Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq takes a dig at Au...

On his 35th birthday, Kohli made an unbeaten 101 as tournament hosts and favourites India racked up 326 for five after choosing to bat at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens. South Africa’s powerful batting unit were then bundled out for just 83 - the joint-second-lowest total in their history - as left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja picked up five for 33, including the in-form Heinich Klaasen leg-before for a single. But it was Kohli who stole the show, equalling Tendulkar’s mark from astonishing 175 innings fewer, and earning a congratulatory tweet from the Little Master, who urged him to break the record ‘in the next few days’. India’s last remaining group match is against the Netherlands on Sunday, and they are now guaranteed to go through to the semi-finals as group winners.

He’s perfection with the bat. It’s an emotional moment. I know the days I have watched him on TV. To receive appreciation from him means a lot to me.’ India don’t yet know the identity of their oppponents in the last four, with Australia, New Zealand, Afghanistan and Pakistan all in the mix as the tournament’s marathon group stage enters its final week. South Africa are already through. But the manner in which the Indians dismantled the biggest-hitting team in the World Cup - Marco Jansen top-scored with just 14 - has laid down a marker ahead of the knockout stages. And a nation of 1.4 billion will be demanding Kohli wraps things up with No 50.

Speaking after England’s elimination was finally confirmed by Saturday’s 33-run defeat by Australia in Ahmedabad , the 36-year-old Moeen said the time had come to move forward with a new 50-over team - and volunteered himself as one of the seniors to make way. ‘Everything good comes to an end, and maybe the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it as players because we thought we’d be performing well,’ he said. ‘But I just think everything good comes to an end at some point. ‘If I was in charge, I’d play the younger guys after this. I’d just start again, and I’m sure they’re going to do that. It’s common sense more than anything. You want that fearless approach back, and it’s a great time to start again. ‘I’m going to speak to Jos and Motty and see what they want from me. If they say “look, we’re going to go with younger players and start again”, then I’m more than happy. I get it.’ England vice captain Moeen Ali has admitted he may have to step away from England duty following the World Cup England's exit was confirmed after their defeat to Australia - their sixth loss in seven games Moeen said he will speak to captain Jos Buttler (right) and coach Matthew Mott (left) to see what their plans are for him going forward England’s next 50-over assignment after the World Cup will be a three-match series in the West Indies, starting in early December - a tour that includes five T20 internationals as part of the build-up to next summer’s World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean. And while Moeen agrees England must undergo a one-day overhaul, he believes many of the players who have underperformed so badly here in India will be in the 20-over party. First, though, Jos Buttler’s team must try to salvage the bare minimum from a World Cup in which they have lost six of their seven matches, most by thumping margins. They will look to beat both the Netherlands and Pune to guarantee qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy The 33-run defeat to Australia means England remain bottle of the group stage with two points And that means beating the Netherlands in Pune on Wednesday and Pakistan in Kolkata on Saturday to ensure the top-eight finish that would guarantee qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Failure to reach world cricket’s second-most prestigious 50-over event will not help Matthew Mott’s prospects of staying on as coach, and Moeen admitted: ‘We’ve got to turn up properly as players. They are two massive games coming up. ‘I know how important the Champions Trophy is in terms of experience at a world event, especially with potentially younger players coming in. It’s very important we make sure we qualify.’ Asked if he could recall a tour or series where England had played so poorly for so long, Moeen - who took part in the equally miserable 2015 World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand - said: ‘No, not at all. I think in 2015 we didn’t expect to do much, but this one we expected to be in a better position than we are now. We’ve just been rubbish throughout – batting, bowling and fielding.’ Share or comment on this article: England vice captain Moeen Ali admits he may have to move aside and let the youngsters in after dismal World Cup defence: 'I'd start again and I'm sure they will do that' e-mail Add comment Comments 4 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

Kohli's 49th ODI hundred paved the way for India's 326 for five on a slightly diffident Eden Gardens pitch, which proved way over the par in the end. \"If you look at how we have played in the last three games, we have adapted better. Today, we needed Kohli to go out there and play to the situation. We then knew we had to keep it in the right areas (with the ball) and let the pitch do the rest,\" said Rohit during the post-match presentation. Rohit was quite chuffed with the way middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer and pacer Mohammed Shami repaid the management's faith in this World Cup. Iyer made an outstanding 77 off 87 balls while Shami picked a wicket that swelled his tally in the tournament to 15. Rohit said he would have kept his faith in them even if they did not come out with such performances. \"Even if the faith hadn't been repaid (by Shreyas and Shami), I would have still stuck to them. We need to keep the trust. It can't be done every day. For Shami to comeback the way he has, shows the mindset. The last two games have shown what Iyer is capable of,\" he noted. Upfront, Rohit has made a riveting alliance with his partner Shubman Gill but the skipper said their aggressive approach was not premeditated. \"Gill and myself have been batting together for a majority of time now. We let the instincts take over. We don't pre-plan anything. We just assess and play accordingly,\" he said. Ravindra Jadeja too made a statement of his skills while making a quick 29 off 15 balls that gave India some late steam and then he returned to pick up a five-wicket haul (5/33). Rohit lauded Jadeja for his all-round effort. Advertisement \"Today was a classical case as to what Jadeja is for us. He came out at the death and scored vital runs. Then picked up wickets. He knows his role and knows the expectations from him.\" India have now won an unprecedented eight matches in a row in the World Cup, but Rohit did not give in for hyperboles. \"Not to get too ahead of ourselves has been the talk in the dressing room. We have a couple of big games coming up. We don't want to change anything.\" South Africa captain Temba Bavuma said his side failed to adapt on this day. \"We know the challenge, know the narrative around us while chasing. Didn't do it any justice today. When we talk about it as a batting group, gotta be honest,\" he said. \"The first ten overs with the ball made it a challenge. We did do quite well after that. Biggest challenge was taking wickets and India built big stands. The conditions are the biggest learning. \"Wicket played as we suspected it to play - expected it to deteriorate but we didn't adapt well.

It was a very tough pitch and at times, it seemed that even 260-270 looked par,\" Jadeja said at post-match conference. \"He rotated the strike and at stage when runs dried up and their spinners were bowling well, to rotate strike and remain not out while taking score beyond 300, it takes effort,\" he said. The pitch, Jadeja believed, became easier for batting later as he tried to put Kohli's ton in perspective. \"When they bowled, there was more help from the track, there was more turn on offer and wicket didn't have bounce also. If you ask for my opinion, the pitch became easier for batting in the evening compared to afternoon, may be not easy but okay for batting. \"But in the afternoon, it was a slow turner. You couldn't hit big shots. Credit how Virat handled their spinners. We always had an idea that Kolkata is a low bounce track that aids spinners. We knew wicket would play slow.” Rohit's decision to bat first was a calculated one as Indian team wanted to assess how things may pan out if India play their semi-final in Kolkata and need to bowl under lights. \"We wanted to challenge ourselves, had we bowled at afternoon, we wouldn't have given so many runs. We wanted to see how we could bowl if dew sets in and if knock-outs, if we get such a situation,\" Jadeja said.","pubDate":"2023-11-05 18:39:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7ad1064d75bb534b4e548c821ed122bb","title":"Writing was on the wall – Moeen Ali accepts time is up on golden generation","link":"https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/sport/national/23903131.writing-wall---moeen-ali-accepts-time-golden-generation/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England’s World Cup defence is over with two group games remaining after six defeats from seven.","content":"Vice-captain Moeen Ali has urged England to rebuild their ageing team after the World Cup, claiming “the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it”.

And Moeen, the oldest player in the squad at 36, realises that time has caught up with them. “I just think everything good comes to an end at some point,” he said. “Maybe the writing was on the wall and we just didn’t see it as players because we thought we’d be performing well. “I think if I was in charge I’d play the younger guys, I’d just start again and I’m sure they’re going to do that.

If they say, ‘look we’re going to go with younger players and start again’ then I’m more than happy. I get it, I understand and like I said, everything good comes to an end at some point.” England could choose to start the regeneration process immediately, with Harry Brook (24), Sam Curran (25), Gus Atkinson (25) and Brydon Carse (28) all waiting in the wings in the current squad.

The game in Pune is not only a must-win in terms of basic pride but also critical if England are to keep alive their hopes of finishing in the top eight and securing a place in the Champions Trophy in 2025. Buttler said he would need time to “digest” the latest defeat before making a call on team selection, but did not rule out another show of faith in the old guard. “The guys who we were selecting have been top players for a long time and time kind of says that at some point they’ll get back to being the best,” he said. Moeen, despite his readiness to slip into the shadows, stands ready to play if required. “Like always, you pick the best players who you think are going to win the game,” he said. “We obviously haven’t been playing well and I’m sure they’re going to talk and decide on who they want to play.

South Africa’s coach Rob Walters was at a loss of words to capture the excellence of India. “What should I say? All I can say is that this is a hell of a team. Hell of a team.” He was asked whether the pitch that offered assistance for the spinners surprised them. He thought hard and replied: “The scoreboard says it all. There are no two ways about it.” Advertisement The scoreboard, an old-fashioned manual one, read: India 326 for 5; South Africa 83.

Their transformation was ludicrously swift and magical. A couple of months ago, even at the start of the tournament, no one expected India to be outright favourites. There were cracks and crevices, doubts about the form and fitness of individuals, suspicion of their combination. Yet in the space of a month, they have emerged as the most rounded, ruthless, and driven side. An unbreakable winning machine, functioning by an alignment of supremely-skilled cricketers at the peak of their prowess, feeding off their own motivation as well as riding the rousing support of the home crowd. No other Indian team has won eight games in a World Cup, let alone winning eight on the spin. No other Indian team, even the 2011, blazed the aura of fear and halo of intimidation than this team. Few other Indian teams had a readymade answer to every tricky question thrown at them. Few other teams in this edition have made winning look so effortless, or executed their plans as clinically as the merry band of Rohit Sharma .

But mercilessly, India pulled them again to feet and shower more blows on their already battered minds.

The Indian captain knew that the pitch would be difficult to bat on after the new ball loses its sheen and the spinners stride in. So Rohit threw caution to the wind, taking India to 61 runs in five overs. The onslaught was not preplanned but instinctive, he would say during the presentation. He departed, but Kohli and Gill sustained the momentum till the 10th over. Keshav Maharaj produced a ripper made in left-arm spinner’s heaven that castled Gill. The ball had begun to rip, grip and turn. But no situation flusters them. Advertisement But so experienced is the batting, so deep their understanding of the game so prepared are they with the plans that they know the right responses. So Virat Kohli dropped the anchor, sucking the blood out of South Africa’s resolve, drop by drop, leaving them lifeless. Shreyas Iyer played along, stifling his attacking impulses, but not out of fear but retreating only to leap longer and further. The early storm weathered, he became the storm himself, whipping fear and fury. The first 34 balls yielded 11 runs. In the next 53 balls, he cracked 66 on a track where Maharaj extracted staggering side-spin, where the odd ball spat viciously. Kohli would play the selfless side-kick role. He bit his ego, eschewed the big shots and calmly dragged them along.

In those sessions Shreyas and I invariably batted together, because we knew we were Nos 3 and 4. In the middle I told him,‘This is the partnership, this is the partnership.” This was the partnership. They added 134 runs, 51 runs more than South Africa mustered. Ravindra Jadeja ’s late blitz stormed India to a total their opponent coach reckoned was “at least 70-80 runs more than we had thought.” Most Read 1 When Gulzar sat silently with Tabu for one hour, offered her Maachis after that: ‘This relationship impacted my life the most’ 2 New Zealand vs Pakistan, World Cup 2023 Highlights: Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam take PAK to 21-run win via DLS method 3 ‘I want to have the same things these guys are having’: Wasim Akram slams Hasan Raza’s statement on Indian bowlers being given different balls to bowl 4 Sunny Deol says he doesn’t like how Shah Rukh Khan has turned actors into a ‘commodity’, Salman has made them into ‘bodybuilders’ 5 Around Town: This 87-year-old restaurant in Mumbai continues to be a favourite of politicians, officers of Customs and narcotics bureau See More The chase was over before it even began. It’s now an inevitability — India’s seamers running the top-order ragged, making them see sixes and sevens. This was a batting line-up that has stacked five 350-plus totals in the previous seven games. But here, they were ruthlessly dismembered. Just 10 balls into the game, Mohammed Siraj disarrayed the stumps of the highest run-getter of the series, Quinton de Kock. His captain and opening partner, Temba Bavuma would not last long. Half an hour later, the match was effectively over, with South Africa losing the top six for 59 runs. There is no respite, or breathing space. Threat comes in various forms. You endure the seamers, the spinners would chasten you. Sharma introduced Jadeja as early as ninth over, and by the time he was into his ninth over, he had five wickets to his name. With the ball spinning —not as much as it did in daylight —Jadeja did Jadeja things. He would land the ball on length within the stumps and spin it either way, mix the pace, shuffle the trajectories and points of release. Three of his wickets were bowleds; one was leg before the wicket. His all-rounder performance could go unnoticed and unsung, but Rohit would praise him: “Jadeja has been really good. Big match-winner. He keeps doing the job, goes under the radar but today is a classic case of what he does – score late runs and take wickets.” Also Read ‘I hope you go from 49 to 50 and break my record’: Sachin Tendulkar react... ‘Human rights or 2 points’: Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq takes a dig at Au...

Read aloud the margin of India’s wins —by six wickets, eight wickets, seven wickets, seven wickets, by four wickets, 100 runs, 302 runs and 243 runs. This is a team that is hitting higher notes with every game. Like Walters admitted, “a hell of a team” or a screeching unstoppable truck speeding along an expressway.","pubDate":"2023-11-05 18:00:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress","source_priority":1386,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
