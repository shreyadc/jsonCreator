A lackluster display of bowling from India‚Äôs three experienced bowlers cost team India big time, as they failed to defend the challenging total of 181/7 in 20 Overs. As for the Dasun Shanaka-led Sri Lankan side, their record run chases ‚Äì 184 versus Bangladesh in a must-win encounter, and 176 against Afghanistan in the first ‚ÄòSuper 4‚Äô game of the tournament, has instilled a fresh sense of self-belief, especially in their batting department, which has taken the fearless approach to good effect so far. The pace bowling department in particular, has led to furrowed foreheads for both the teams‚Äô think-tanks, but their batting performances have been the biggest positives, which would hope to come good yet again.

The presence of grass will however mean that the pacers will come into play especially with the new ball, and batting will get easier as the match progresses, with scores in excess of 180 being scored on five of the previous six innings at this venue. The evening temperature will be around 35 degrees celsius, which might mean that the humidity might not bring in the dew factor into play, thus making it an even contest with both bat and ball throughout.","pubDate":"2022-09-05 20:55:53","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The formula for Sri Lanka to beat India at the Asia Cup - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvaW5kLXZzLXNsLWFzaWEtY3VwLTIwMjItdGhlLWZvcm11bGEtZm9yLXNyaS1sYW5rYS10by1iZWF0LWluZGlhLWF0LXRoZS1hc2lhLWN1cC0xMzMyNjcz0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc3RvcnkvaW5kLXZzLXNsLWFzaWEtY3VwLTIwMjItdGhlLWZvcm11bGEtZm9yLXNyaS1sYW5rYS10by1iZWF0LWluZGlhLWF0LXRoZS1hc2lhLWN1cC0xMzMyNjczP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The formula for Sri Lanka to beat India at the Asia Cup¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Sri Lanka Prediction- Who Will Win Today's Match Between IND And SL, Asia Cup 2022, Super 4, Match 3¬†¬†Cricket AddictorAsia Cup 2022: India Vs Sri Lanka Super 4 Match Weather Forecast And Pitch Report¬†¬†ICC CRICKET SCHEDULEMatch Preview - India vs Sri Lanka, Asia Cup 2022, 9th Match, Super Four¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoIndia v SL | Asia Cup | Preview¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-05 19:53:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CEP vs SIN Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing XIs, Player Stats, Pitch Report for National T20 Cup 2022, Match 13","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/cep-vs-sin-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-xis-player-stats-pitch-report-national-t20-cup-2022-match-13?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Adarsh Tabhane"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-05 19:45:43","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/09/1df2f-16623999222378-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Sri Lanka T20 previous match: IND vs SL last 10 T20 match result list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-india-vs-sri-lanka-t20-previous-match-ind-vs-sl-last-10-t20-match-result-list/","keywords":["Cricket","Asia Cup 2022","India","Sri Lanka"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Sri Lanka T20 previous match: India will face Sri Lanka today in a must-win match of Asia Cup 2022 ‚ÄòSuper 4‚Äô stage.

A poor bowling performance from the three experienced Indian bowlers, and a brilliant display of attacking batting approach by the Pakistani batters, paved the way for Pakistan‚Äôs victory ‚Äì their second in the previous three T20Is against them. As for Sri Lanka, their record run chases ‚Äì 184 versus Bangladesh in a must-win encounter, and 176 against Afghanistan in the first ‚ÄòSuper 4‚Äô game of the tournament, has lifted their spirits higher than ever heading into their face-off against India today at the Dubai International Stadium. It is the pace bowling aspect of both the teams, which have particularly emerged to be their cause of worry, and the batters will look to take full advantage of this very vulnerable side of the opposition to turn the match in their favour. Team India last played Sri Lanka in February this year at home, in a three-match T20I series. The Rohit Sharma-led side had managed to clean sweep the series 3-0, with a six-wicket victory during the final T20I at Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh. In the last 10 T20Is between these two sides, team India has had the upper hand, winning seven matches while losing three of them.

Opening the innings after Somerset put Gloucestershire into bat Harris made 159, his highest score of the season and his third century of the campaign. Hitting 17 fours and a six in his 263-ball stay Harris helped Glos to 320-6 at the close of the first of four days' play at Taunton. Harris began his season in England's west country with two centuries in April, 136 against Yorkshire and 124 against Surrey, both at home ground Bristol. But since then big scores had been elusive, though he made four 50s in eight innings in the 50-over competition in August. However, this century lifted his Championship average this season to 44 from 36 and comes at a good time. The Australian selectors' minds are very much on white-ball cricket at present as the T20 World Cup preparations gear up, but further down the track there are home Test series against West Indies and South Africa starting in late November. Finishing the English season strongly will set Harris up as he returns to West Australia and bids to regain his Test place. Harris was dropped after the fourth Ashes Test in January, being the batter to make way when Travis Head regained his place after a bout of COVID-19 as Usman Khawaja had become undroppable. He failed to make the XI for the Tests in Pakistan and was omitted from the squad that toured Sri Lanka. At 30, without a century in 14 Tests, he does not have time on his side. On Monday Harris and Ben Charlesworth (56) put on an opening stand of 126 while 21-year-old Ollie Price (52) provided further support against a Somerset attack featuring Sajid Khan. The Pakistan off-spinner gave Harris his one moment of anxiety, on 33, when he survived a sharp chance to George Bartlett at short-leg. At lunch Harris was 47 no and he soon brought up a 99-ball half-century. After a rain break the left-hander hit Sajid over his head for the day's only six. A late cut for four off Sajid took Harris to his 22nd first class hundred, off 174 balls. Wickets began to fall at the other end, with the new ball having a impact, but Harris batted serenely on before, with eight balls of the day remaining, he edged a back-foot shot off Jack Brooks to Lewis Gregory at slip.

The 2022 drivers‚Äô market saw the biggest controversy in Oscar Piastri and McLaren vying against Alpine in front of the Contract Regulations Board (CRB). The two teams were fighting for the services of the Australian race driver. Alpine argued that Piastri had an obligation to serve them, but McLaren argued that they had an agreement with him since July. Ultimately, the Woking-based team won the trial in front of the CRB. This means Piastri will be competing for McLaren from the 2023 season after the board found McLaren‚Äôs agreement only the valid one. On top of that, Alpine also had to compensate Piastri and McLaren for over $420,000. Thus, it was an embarrassing and expensive affair for the French team. Seeing this, Mercedes‚Äôs boss Toto Wolff is not pleased with the judgement. He claims that it has set a precedent for drivers to violate agreements, and now, teams will lawyer up to have a firmer hold over their drivers‚Äô contracts. ‚ÄúWe invest human resources that go to the go-kart tracks, to the junior formulas, and in some cases, it‚Äôs little money, some cases it‚Äôs more,‚Äù he said in the interview. ‚ÄúTo know now that a precedent has been set that if you‚Äôre clever you can manoeuvre yourself out is something that‚Äôs clearly not good for the industry.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, we will be employing even more lawyers for even stricter contracts.

On the other hand, recent reports have suggested that Piastri didn‚Äôt like Alpine‚Äôs plan to send him to Williams for a couple of years and call him back. For him, McLaren‚Äôs offer was more viable and lucrative. Further, Piastri‚Äôs agent Mark Webber has attacked the Renault-powered team.

While a single, unfortunate slip-up can not be the sole reason for a team‚Äôs loss in a team sport, impulsive, knee-jerk reactions might lead the emotionally invested followers of the game to blame a particular player for not ideally getting his/her basics right at a crucial juncture of a match, more so especially if it is a Cricket match between India and Pakistan. While constructive criticisms should always be welcomed, there is no space for people or trolls, as what these lot are known as, to pass gross remarks and comments questioning a player‚Äôs loyalty and integrity towards his team, as was the case with Arshdeep, who hails from the Indian Sikh community, which is a minority in the country.

Teeming with slow-moving Friday traffic, the street features as many kebab restaurants as pizzerias. If Milan is one of the fashion capitals of the world, Armani and Versace must have missed this part of town. The people waiting outside the tattoo parlor take numbers like they are at a deli counter. Taped to the walls are six red-and-black mock-ups of tattoos with words like ‚ÄúMilan Forever‚Äù and ‚ÄúAC Milan 1899.‚Äù Tattoos that would normally cost 150 euros are free, sponsored by the club. Many of the fans waiting in line say they already have the logo inked, so they opt for more symbolic renditions like the year of the club‚Äôs founding. ‚ÄúPeople put Milan on their skin because they have Milan in their heart,‚Äù says Andrea Costa, owner of Spektrum Tattoo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than getting a boyfriend or girlfriend‚Äôs name tattooed on your arm, because Milan will never betray you.‚Äù Tattooed geckos and scorpions crawl up Costa‚Äôs face; his body is a Rosetta Stone of runes and ink. Costa, 47, dips a needle into red ink, and when he scribbles on a Milan fan, one cannot tell if it is ink or blood. Costa has tattooed recent club icons like Robinho and Gianluigi Donnarumma; he hangs out with club legends like Marco van Basten and Filippo Inzaghi on vacation. And while Costa jokes that the club chose him for this project because he‚Äôs ‚Äúthe fastest tattoo artist in Milan,‚Äù Spektrum Tattoo holds a special place in AC Milan‚Äôs recent history.

The nature and irony of a derby is that while it is steeped in decades of history and tradition, its glory is fleeting and its memory can be short. Its bragging rights go to the side that won the last scrap. Its currency is revelry or resentment. When asked if he would ever tattoo an Inter Milan logo, Costa says, ‚ÄúSure, but I‚Äôll make them pay double for it.‚Äù Unlike most derbies, Milan‚Äôs rivalry is not broken up by neighborhoods or locations, but by families. You are born into AC Milan or Inter like you are given a last name. The hatred is Montague and Capulet. ‚ÄúMy husband, my son, my family‚Äîall Milan fans,‚Äù says Rossella Durante, who waits for a tattoo of a heart holding the club‚Äôs crest in honor of her father. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather die than see them support Inter.‚Äù It is 24 hours until the Milan derby, where 90 minutes will often seem like a matter of life and death for millions. The most important figure in the Milan derby is neither Zlatan nor Maldini, not Zanetti nor Meazza, for whom the San Siro stadium is named after. Covered in more than 6,000 sheets of gold and adorned with a star-studded halo, she is three years older than the United States and stands at atop the tallest spire of the Duomo, the landmark Gothic cathedral at the center of Milan. She is called the Madonnina‚Äîthe little Madonna‚Äîand she lends her namesake to the match, called the Derby della Madonnina. The old Milanese tradition says that no building can be taller than the Madonnina, which stands 356 feet above the city. When a taller skyscraper is built, the architects often affix a replica Madonnina to the highest point. Except during World War II, when the Madonnina was covered with a tarp so as not to be a target for bombing, she has seen the city flip between red and blue since the first official Milan derby in 1909. Both clubs were born out of the Milan Cricket and Football Club, founded in 1899 by a group that included English ex-pats. AC Milan still carries the anglicized version of the city‚Äôs name rather than the Italian (Milano) as part of that tradition. Italians omit the AC‚Äîthey are simply Milan. Its founders wanted players to compete like devils, so they chose red for fire and black for the fear it hoped to instill in its opponents. Nine years later, a group of founding members left over a disagreement concerning the club‚Äôs stance on foreign players. Those members founded Internazionale, taking its Nerazzurri colors from the gold stars and the blue-black night when it was founded. The colors of the Milan derby are unmistakable. IMAGO/LaPresse More than a century later, AC Milan and Inter Milan have tallied 19 league titles apiece. The next title will earn them a second star on its jersey, one for every 10 Scudetti. However, Inter Milan holds the official head-to-head matchup with 85 wins to AC Milan‚Äôs 79. The list of players to play for both sides could fill a Hall of Fame: Ronaldo, Andrea Pirlo, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, Roberto Baggio, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Christian Vieri. But it is a pair of brothers who best represent the ethos of the derby. In 1971, Giuseppe Baresi successfully tried out for Inter Milan and would go on to make more than 500 appearances for the club. His younger brother, Franco, was turned away. The next year, Franco signed with AC Milan. It was his destiny, he says, a pair of brothers separated by two years and one color. ‚ÄúInter wanted to wait a little longer to sign me because they thought I still needed to grow,‚Äù Franco Baresi tells Sports Illustrated . ‚ÄúMaybe they were going to wait until the next year. Instead, Milan was more in a rush.‚Äù When Franco turned 18, just after his senior debut for AC Milan, he moved into an apartment in Milan. Waiting for him was a familiar face who also shared the same office at San Siro, and for a handful of years the brothers lived together as rivals and roommates. ‚ÄúDuring the week [of the derby] we would still have to see each other,‚Äù Franco says. ‚ÄúWhoever won would pay for dinner.‚Äù While Giuseppe was the first to reach stardom as a versatile and tenacious defensive midfielder, it was Franco who would become a national legend. The younger Baresi made more than 700 appearances and spent 15 years as captain of AC Milan, finished second in Ballon d‚ÄôOr voting in 1989, won the World Cup in 1982 and eventually captained the Italian national team. However, the most iconic image of his career may very well be him and his brother shaking hands at midfield in four years worth of Milan derbies, each Baresi brother a captain representing half of a city. The Baresi brothers shake hands before a Derby della Madonnina. IMAGO/Buzzi ‚ÄúDuring the derby week, you run into people on the street who would hold you accountable for it,‚Äù Franco says. ‚ÄúTwo brothers in two important clubs‚Äîthat was exciting. It was more than just adversaries, because I had my brother on the other side.‚Äù In the end, the dinners mostly came out even. From Franco‚Äôs AC Milan debut in 1978 to Giuseppe‚Äôs departure from Inter in 1992, Inter recorded 10 wins, nine draws and nine losses in the Derby della Madonnina. ‚ÄúBetween us there was always a lot of respect,‚Äù Franco says. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt change our relationship. ‚Ä¶ Sometimes he was happier, sometimes I was.‚Äù While their midfield handshakes continue to be iconic, it may be one of the few times when the Milan derby was cordial. What often awaited was hellfire. Three hours before Saturday‚Äôs derby and the streets around San Siro are consumed by a silent rush. A tide of red and blue is flowing toward the stadium, and everyone is trying to hitch a ride. Taxis don‚Äôt bother stopping. The retro rickety trams, a vestige of the old Milan that can also be found as far as San Francisco, are packed so tightly that people at the edge have to be pulled back to avoid falling out when the doors open. Inter fans share Vespas with AC Milan fans, taking swigs of Birra Moretti before passing it down the line at red lights. Pubs are not part of the pre-game experience like in England. If you‚Äôre looking to sing songs about the days of old and get drunk on cheap-ish beer, you can save yourself the trip and head straight to San Siro. Fans are already piling into the stadium, spiraling up the iconic box-spring exterior staircases that invoke an optical illusion. One hour to go and the Curvas are full. It is an AC Milan home game, but each group of ultras sticks to the side it calls home: the Curva Nord (the North End) for Interista, the Curva Sud for Milanista. Insults are volleyed back and forth like the needle of a metronome. The Curva Nord waves an army of flags to the tune of a persistent drum beat through to the final whistle; its leaders stand on the dangerous side of a rail that is supposed to keep them from falling 40 feet down to the field. The Curva Sud prefers to employ flailing limbs and middle fingers as their weapons of choice. It is a good thing Saturday is for the derby, because on Sunday they can at least confess their sins to the Madonnina. Thirty minutes before kickoff, each side unfurls breathtaking tifos that stretch the entire length of each curva and up to San Siro‚Äôs top stratum. AC Milan stuns with a mural-like portrait of a celebratory Milanista next to a crying Interista with the caption: ‚ÄúThe Milanese tradition.‚Äù Inter‚Äôs reads ‚ÄúI who loves only you,‚Äù adding nerazzurri colors to a famous Italian couple featured in Francesco Hayez‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Kiss‚Äù painting. AC Milan then jabs with ‚ÄúI, champion. You, crybaby.‚Äù Inter‚Äôs retort is simple and eloquent: ‚ÄúSTRONZI‚Äù (A--holes). Milan fans echo it, spitting their venom at Hakan √áalhanoƒülu, who did the unforgivable by leaving AC Milan for Inter Milan before last season. It all feels like a red carpet or fashion runway, a megaton Medieval Times theme park with red knights and blue knights. All the songs feature curse words screamed louder than the other lyrics and the air smells like general body odor, hand-rolled cigarettes and the gunpowder of flares. And it is then that you realize while there is a game being played out on the ground, there is also one in the sky. The air is simply electric and there is nowhere for the current to go until the goals begin flowing. Inter strikes first in the 21st minute, Milan equalizes seven minutes later. Each side turns into Tolkien Orcs crawling over each other when the ball hits the back of the net. The conceding side employs a gesture with their arms that looks like an elephant flapping its trunk, as if to say, ‚ÄúYeah, so what?‚Äù A 13-minute stretch featuring three goals at the start of the second half tests the Richter scale. Giroud. Le√£o. D≈æeko. Pandora‚Äôs Box is open and San Siro is Michelangelo‚Äôs The Last Judgment: bodies strewn, hellish scenes abound, the speaking of tongues. And then the choirs ring out from the heavens at San Siro, filling the stadium with song, and your ears guide your eyes upward despite the goals. Worship, gratitude, praise, damnation‚Äîlike a church. During the match, somewhere in the ground-level stadium boxes, Donald Trump‚Äôs Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and far-right Italian politician Matteo Salvini watch on, surrounded by security‚Äîwhat a pity to be so powerful that you have to stay inside while an entire city pours its soul out in the fifth derby in a calendar year. The Rossoneri win 3‚Äì2, champions of Serie A and kings of Milan. The Madonnina is theirs. The hellfire is spent. The past scripts of the derby fuel its present theatre, but the stage where future derbies will unfold is about to change. Milan already has the Duomo, but if all goes to plan it will soon have The Cathedral . Populous, the architectural firm behind Wembley Stadium and the new Yankee Stadium, has been tasked with building it. Partly inspired by the Duomo‚Äôs facade, the designs are stellar, a mix between a Star Wars base and Central Park. Carbon neutral with 22 acres of green space and recreational centers open to the public, The Cathedral is an attempt at incorporating a new stadium into the fabric of an old community‚Äîsomething that San Siro with its moat of parking lots has never done. The preliminary goal has been to open by 2027, but the Italian bureaucracy is famous for turning aspiration into regret. The project, which will reportedly cost around $1 billion, will be privately owned and financed by both clubs, a rarity in Italian soccer. In Europe‚Äôs top five leagues, there are only two stadiums that host two top-flight teams: San Siro and Rome‚Äôs Stadio Olimpico (AS Roma and Lazio), Italy‚Äôs two biggest stadiums. In an economic sense, the paths of AC Milan and Inter intertwine in the space where they share a playing surface, and that success is symbiotic. The current stadium is listed as the host of the opening ceremony for the 2026 Winter Olympics; after that, its precise future is not as certain. The San Siro is making way for The Cathedral later this decade. IMAGO/Sportimage AC Milan confirmed that while all options are still on the table, including the possibility of choosing a different site, San Siro will be demolished under the current plan agreed to by both clubs with ‚Äúthe possibility of keeping some vestiges that represent the legacy of the current stadium.‚Äù According to the club, the plan is for The Cathedral to be built beside the current stadium so that no temporary playing site would be needed‚Äîwhen ready, the clubs can flip the switch and move next door. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòtradition‚Äô and the iconic status of the Meazza stadium are intrinsically linked to the legendary stories and successes that both AC Milan and Inter have achieved on the pitch,‚Äù AC Milan president Paolo Scaroni tells Sports Illustrated in a statement. ‚ÄúIf the clubs go elsewhere, their heritage will remain alive and will be renewed in their new facility, making the new stadium equally special and iconic.‚Äù But the plan has already upset large portions of their fan bases who hold onto the nostalgia of San Siro. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad to hear about San Siro,‚Äù says Durante with a new tattoo wrapped in cellophane. ‚ÄúThe thought of seeing it torn down makes me shudder. It‚Äôs always nice to try something new, but San Siro is San Siro.‚Äù A new group of American owners will have a say in where the derby goes from here. RedBird Capital, led by Gerry Cardinale, completed its acquisition of the club last week in a deal reportedly worth $1.2 billion. Investment also came from a group featuring LeBron James and Drake as passive investors, while a minority stake goes to the New York Yankees , which will use its YES Network to showcase AC Milan to the U.S. market. The next day, U.S. men‚Äôs national team star Sergi√±o Dest arrived at the club , on loan from Barcelona and on the bench to witness the derby. Whatever the future holds for the derby‚Äîwherever it is played and whoever plays in it‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs best to heed the advice of one of its finest actors. For Franco Baresi, San Siro legend, memories cannot just be confined to a place‚Äîthey require the energy that colors the scene with moments of magic and joy. ‚ÄúFor me, [San Siro] was home for 20 years,‚Äù Baresi says. ‚ÄúNo one will ever forget what San Siro is and has been for the story of Milan and Inter. ‚Ä¶ It is a great joy.‚Äù More Soccer Coverage:","pubDate":"2022-09-05 16:31:40","image_url":"http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMTIwNzA1Njc5MTA3NDEw/ac-milan-tifo-derby-teams.jpg","source_id":"si","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúA bowling average of 16.94‚Äù: Oscar Piastri choosing F1 over cricket was wise decision","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/f1-news-a-bowling-average-of-16-94-oscar-piastri-choosing-f1-over-cricket-was-wise-decision/","keywords":["Cricket","F1","McLaren","Oscar Piastri"],"creator":["Vachan Nandakumar Giriyapur"],"video_url":null,"description":"Oscar Piastri used to play cricket at the Brighton Cricket Club back in Australia, and his stats are atrocious; choosing F1 was probably wise.

Her father,¬†Richard Williams, is to be credited for coaching Serena and her sister Venus at an early age in tennis. Known to be a strict coach, his training helped Serena and Venus develop impeccable athleticism since childhood.

She began at a young age and quickly rose to prominence. In 1994, her sister Venus Williams gave a smashing play, but her father Richard had even higher conviction about Serena‚Äôs career. The biggest breakthrough in Serena‚Äôs career happened at the¬†U.S. Open in 1999. 17-year-old Serena won her first of the total 23 Grand Slam singles titles with outstanding numbers.¬† However, the extraordinary triumph was just the beginning.

However, there is a lot more than just coaching and smashing tours that make her the woman loved by one and all. Serena Williams is not only a champion of the courts but a champion for equality. She is the first black woman to be the No. 1 tennis player, among many other firsts. However, she is an inspiration outside court too. An advocate for the equality of black women, she invests in women of color founders. She has also been a vocal advocate for equal pay for women tennis players. Serena has also boldly stood up for the Black Lives Matter movement and body positivity. During a press conference, she once quoted: ‚ÄúThe day I stop fighting for equality and for people that look like you and me will be the day I‚Äôm in my grave.‚Äù What Serena‚Äôs Grand Success Teaches the Aspiring Athletes? The biggest learning that one can take from William‚Äôs career is to not focus on achieving perfection from day one. Instead, Williams believes that aspiring athletes should develop a solid foundation first. This means starting with the basics, like proper training and nutrition, before moving on to more advanced techniques and strategies. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) Perhaps, the most valuable thing that Serena reminds young women is that anything is possible with hard work and a good mindset. She reminds us that it‚Äôs never too late to set goals and achieve great things. Don‚Äôt be afraid to aim high, dream big, and fearlessly pursue your dreams. This grand success is the outcome of her unwavering determination, focus, and selflessness ‚Äî all key ingredients for becoming an elite athlete. But most important is the duty to stand up for something far bigger than just success ‚Äî the service to those not an equal pedestal to achieve something grand. It is one thing to be the greatest sports person and the other to be an exemplary human being. Williams teaches how to be both. We lack better words to describe you. You are inspiration to our girls and mothers. We love you. Just can‚Äôt wait to see you prospering in your new chapter.SERENA WILLAMS ‚Äòdkoded‚Äò The post All Hail The Queen.

Kohli, who had been struggling to score runs over the last couple of years, now has scored two back-to-back half-centuries for India, including his 44-ball 60 that went in vain in Team India's defeat on Sunday. During the post-match conference, Kohli was asked if he received support from anyone in the cricket fraternity when he was going through a difficult phase in his career before his return to Asia Cup. After the T20 World Cup last year in the UAE, Kohli gave up the T20I captaincy before he was sacked as the ODI skipper as well. \"When I left Test captaincy, I got a message from only one person, with whom I played in the past. It was MS Dhoni. A lot of people have my number, a lot of people give me suggestions, a lot of people talk about my game on TV. But out of those people who had my number, I didn't get a message from anyone else barring Dhoni,\" Kohli said. \"You have respect, you have a genuine connection with a few people and it looks like that (Dhoni messaging him). It's two-way security, I don't want anything from them nor do they want anything from me. I don't feel insecure with them, nor do they feel insecure with me,\" the former India captain added.\"After Ieft test captainship, Dhoni called me, no one else did\" - Kohli. @imVkohli as honest as he can be. And @msdhoni you are a living legend. On nd off the field. #INDvsPAK #ViratKohli #MSD #icc pic.twitter.com/HS0AE2RZew‚Äî Nepal Maity (@nepalmaity) September 4, 2022 Last year, Kohli revealed that after he quit as India's T20I captain, there was a lack of communication between him, the selection committee, and the administrators over his stepping down as T20I captain and his removal as ODI captain.In fact, Kohli had also contradicted BCCI president Sourav Ganguly's claims about the former captain asking the star batsman to not step down as T20I captain. While announcing his decision to quit T20I captaincy, Kohli mentioned in his social media post that he wanted to continue as ODI and Test captain. \"When I communicated with the BCCI first about quitting T20I captaincy, I told them that this is my point of view, these are the reasons for my decision, it was received quite well. No one took offence, no one had any hesitation. No one told me that I should not leave the T20I captaincy,\" Kohli said in another startling press conference in December 2021. Kohli made these comments a few days after Ganguly had told the media that he had personally asked the Delhi cricketer not to step down as captain in T20I cricket.","pubDate":"2022-09-05 14:07:17","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/09/05/500x300_1310943-virat-kohli.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Sri Lanka LIVE: Cricket score and updates from Asia Cup","link":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/india-sri-lanka-live-stream-score-updates-b2160117.html","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Sports Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Follow all the action from Dubai International Cricket Stadium","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-05 14:00:28","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/06/06/13/newFile-4.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Pakistan: It was Chetan Sharma back then, it's Arshdeep Singh now","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/india-vs-pakistan-it-was-chetan-sharma-back-then-it-s-arshdeep-singh-now-122090501005_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Arshdeep Singh can do with a warm hug from Chetan Sharma.

Not from the current chairman of national selection committee but the wiry, whippy Chetan Sharma, who instead of becoming the \"toast\" had become the virtual \"roast\" of the nation 36 summers back just like it happened with Punjab lad on fateful Sunday night. Coincidentally, in case of Chetan, that match was also played in the UAE but not at the newly-constructed gigantic concrete structure that Dubai International Stadium is but the more informal Sharjah Cricket Stadium where VIP ticket holders could eavesdrop on the adjacent dressing room chatter or drop in a handwritten note with a landline number. Chetan intended to bowl a yorker to Javed Miandad, who was the 'King of Sharjah' back then and it became a full-toss. Back in those Doordarshan days, it used to be basic coverage and only now that IPL matches have been shown live from at Sharjah Stadium, we realise that it is a ridiculously small ground where sixes can be hit for fun. It was one bad ball for Chetan in that 1986 Austral- Asia Cup final, where he was simply unlucky to miss the length. Cut to 2022, Asif Ali's heave turns into a skier and Arshdeep, who would otherwise catch it \"11 out of 10 times\" drops a sitter, much to the dismay of his teammates. The two matches have been held 36 years apart but the boorish mindset of the masses to accept a simple human error had scarred Chetan for life back then and one can only hope that Sunday's missed catch doesn't create a deep gash in the mind of an impressionable 23-year-old, who, if all goes well, is certain to be one of the best T20 death bowlers in world cricket in near future. The Indian public back then didn't spare Chetan and despite being one of those rare Indian bowlers to have a five-for in a Lord's Test and recording the first ever hat-trick in ODI World Cup, people remember that single delivery. Attack on Arshdeep, termed \"Khalistani\" ------------------------------------------------ On Sunday night, what followed on social media after Arshdeep's missed catch couldn't be put in any mild terms. Deplorable, disgusting and shameful are the words that come to mind while sifting through the social media accounts of so-called fans, who are calling Arshdeep names. In fact, such was the vitriol, that some fans hacked and edited his wikipedia page, adding the objectionable term \"Khalistani\" by his name. The hacker changed Arshdeep's named to Major Arshdeep Singh Langra and then Major Arshdeep Singh Bajwa. While the corrective measures were taken and the page was restored to its original form, the matter hasn't gone unnoticed as far as government of India is concerned. Rajeev Chandraksekhar, Union Minister of State for Entrepreneurship, Skill Development, Electronics & Technology, took cognisance of the matter and tweeted: \"No intermerdiary operatng in India can permit this type of misinformation n deliberate efforts to incitement n userharm - violates our govts expectation of Safe & Trusted Internet.\" Obviously, there were a lot of sane voices too but in the world of billion tweets, facebook and instagram posts per second, it is difficult to always differentiate between the good, the bad and the ugly. The fans forgot that the same man, within minutes of dropping that catch, gathered his faculties and showed his temperament to get the same Asif leg before with a perfectly pitched blockhole delivery. They forgot that he had only seven runs to defend and in the T20 Universe of 2022, that was just a cakewalk. They forgot that even Hardik Pandya, Yuzvendra Chahal and Bhuvneshwar Kumar had an off-day. \"I remember when I played my first game against Pakistan (Champions Trophy, 2009), I was dismissed by Shahid Afridi. That entire night, I kept staring at the ceiling and thought I might never play for India again,\" senior pro Virat Kohli, recollected a pressure moment from his career and how Arshdeep will have to take it in his stride. It's not the match but the moment -------------------------------------- Funnily, less than a year after that 1986 match in Sharjah, there was another ODI in Kolkata where Saleem Malik literally pummelled the Indian attack to score 72 off just 35 balls. Maninder Singh, the talented left-arm spinner, was taken to cleaners with utter disdain, but he never faced the public wrath. Waqar Younis, one of the greatest pacers of all time, was smashed by Ajay Jadeja in the 1996 quarter-finals in Bengaluru but it was Wasim Akram, whose house in Karachi was stoned. He had to remain in Lahore as the public mood was against him, having missed the important game due to an injury. It gives a sense that more than poor outings, people remember moments. A last ball six, a dropped catch at the death or a missed knock-out match invokes stronger emotions than getting out for a duck or being hit for 80 in 10 overs. At the end of the day, sport is all about moments and the moments do remain in subconscious mind of fans. Some years back, distinguished cricket writer Osman Samiuddin had penned a book -- \"The Unquiet Ones\" based on Pakistan cricket. It had an anecdote about a train journey during one of Pakistan's tours of India before brakes were put on bilateral contests. During that journey, some of the well-known Pakistani journalists were travelling in the same compartment with Chetan, who by then was a TV analyst. After some pleasantries exchanged, one Pakistani journalist gathered enough courage to start a conversation, something on these lines. \"Chetan bhai, ak baat puchni thi (wanted to ask you a question)..... Apparently, before he could complete his question, Chetan knew what was coming and replied: \"Yaar full-toss ho gaya thaa (It became a full toss)....\" It's the same with Arshdeep. Pressure situation, decibels reaching crescendo and a human error. May be 20 years down the line, Arshdeep could laugh and say, 'Oh!, wo ball nikal gaya tha hath se (it slipped out of my hands).' In the end, it was never a \"war\", like some TV channels would want you to believe. It's just a game. It was and it will remain one.

Although the other two fixtures were postponed, Australia was awarded the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy for winning the first match in Sydney by 71 runs . Another three ODIs were scheduled for January this year before the Black Caps were forced to pull the plug due to the New Zealand Government‚Äôs strict quarantine requirements. But now that the pandemic has, for the most part, been resolved, Australia and New Zealand can finally contend for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy in a bilateral ODI series for the first time since February 2017. Aaron Finch of Australia and Kane Williamson of New Zealand shake hands.

Meanwhile, Kane Williamson‚Äôs Kiwis, currently the top-ranked ODI team in the world, are coming off a 2-1 series victory against the West Indies. The Blacks Caps are in impeccable form, winning 11 of their 12 Super League matches to effectively secure their place in next year‚Äôs World Cup in India. New Zealand arrives in Queensland with a full-strength squad, headlined by veteran quicks Trent Boult and Tim Southee. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a fantastic unit, they have been for a long time,‚Äù Australian white-ball captain Finch told reporters in Cairns. ‚ÄúThey continue to be one of the benchmarks in world cricket in all three formats of the game and the fact that they‚Äôre number one in ODI cricket at the moment is testament to that. ‚ÄúThey are always close battles whatever the format ‚Ä¶ they go the distance generally.‚Äù But the Australians, ranked fifth on the ODI standings, are without talented all-rounder Mitchell Marsh, who suffered an ankle injury during the Zimbabwe series, and paceman Pat Cummins, who has been rested. Aaron Finch of Australia speaks with coach Andrew McDonald. Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images ‚ÄúAlways a really tough challenge, they are very clinical, certainly in their own backyards,‚Äù Black Caps captain Williamson, who missed the last two ODIs against the West Indies with a quad injury, said on Monday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to be over here and playing in another Chappell-Hadlee series as well. ‚ÄúThere are three one-dayers in a pretty quick time and that for us as a white-ball unit is a lot to gain from.‚Äù Cazalys Stadium has not hosted an international cricket match in 18 years, so there‚Äôs an element of uncertainty about conditions heading into the series. These New Zealand fixtures may feel inconsequential due to its spring timeslot and regional setting, but the two nations are not scheduled to face each other in a bilateral ODI series under the Men‚Äôs Future Tours Progamme for 2023-27. Whoever wins this series could keep the trophy for several years.

One dropped catch doesn‚Äôt define ability. We need to unite as a cricket loving nation & support youngsters instead of criticising them. More power to you Arshdeep Singh,‚Äù Yuvraj Singh tweeted.

More power to you @arshdeepsinghh ‚Äî Yuvraj Singh (@YUVSTRONG12) September 5, 2022 Arshdeep has been getting a lot of stick on social media after their dropped catch and many experts have come in his support. Although, it has to be said that the dropped catch was not the reason for India losing the match. Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled an expensive 19th over, whereas Hardik Pandya and Yuzvendra Chahal also bowled expensive spells.

The first ODI of New Zealand‚Äôs tour of Australia 2022 will be played in Cairns tomorrow. A three-match ODI series between Trans-Tasman rivals will witness the return of international cricket in Cairns after as many as 18 years. Set to be an ODI between these two teams after almost 30 months, this is going to be Australia and New Zealand‚Äôs 21st bilateral ODI series against each other. Out of their previous 20 series, Australia have won 11 as compared to just five wins by New Zealand. While the remaining four series had ended in a draw, readers must note that New Zealand have never won an ODI series of more than one match in Australia. ALSO READ: Australia vs New Zealand Head-to-Head in ODIs Slated to be part of the ongoing ICC World Cup Super League, this series will present an opportunity to both these teams to strengthen their respective positions on the points table. With both the teams likely to take the field with almost full-strength squads, fans can expect three engrossing matches this week. Australia vs New Zealand 1st ODI Live Telecast Channel in India and Australia Sony Sports Network will be televising New Zealand‚Äôs tour of Australia 2022 in India. Much like the recently concluded Zimbabwe‚Äôs tour of Australia, fans will be able to watch this series with just one English commentary panel. Indians fans must note that they highly likely to watch this series on Sony SIX and that no other Sony Sports channel will televise these matches. Online users in India can stream the series on Sony‚Äôs streaming application named Sony LIV. It is worth mentioning that fans no longer have the option of watching the match on Airtel Xstream app as Sony Network‚Äôs channels are no longer available on this platform. As far as the local fans fans in Australia are concerned, they will be able to watch Cairns ODIs on the tried and tested Fox Sports. Kayo Sports will be streaming this series for Australian fans. For those who don‚Äôt know, Kayo is offering a 14-day trial version for new subscribers. Fans of the Black Caps will have to switch to Sky Sport NZ to watch this tour.
