That's all from us! Aaron Rodgers may be desperately working to return from injury but after today's game he may not want to. Hopes of seeing the quarterback playoffs took a huge blow as it looks like the Jets won't even be seeing the postseason themselves. Meanwhile, Micke McDaniel will be heading back to SoFlo on Cloud Nine as his Dolphins helped their chances of taking a home field advantage into the postseason. 23:05 FINAL: Dolphins 34-13 Jets It's the same old story in New York. The Jets's switch of Tim Boyle for zach Wilson has reaped no rewards. It's a new quarterback but same old offensive issues in East Rutherford. Meanwhile, the dangerous Dolphins improved to 8-3. 22:55 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 34-13 Jets Most of the crowd has filed out into the parking lot by this point. Miami piles on the misery for New York by following up the Jets' first offensive touchdown of the game by scoring just one minute later. Mosert puts the icing on the cake of an impressive performance for the Dolphins by running it in for a 34-yard touchdown and his second of the game. He even has time to taunt New York's Tony Adams by slowing his pace and sending the defensive back zig zagging right on the line. 22:52 Holland heads to the medical tent Meanwhile, Jevon Holland - the hero of the game's Hell Mary - has entered the medical tent and has been listed as questionable to return with a knee injury. 22:47 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 27-13 Jets The Jets forced another Tua Tagovailoa turnover in the fourth quarter when he fumbled and Ashytn Davis recovered. It's Jets possession and Garrett Wilson tries to haul in a pass in the end zone but is well covered by Elliott and it's ruled incomplete. But the Jets manage to set up first-and-goal on the next play. This time Boyle does manage to find Wilson in the end zone for the Jets' first offensive touchdown of the game. It's only taken them 55 minutes... 22:43 Umpire left bloodied at skirmish Umpire Carl Paganelli appears to have been caught on the mouth and left with a cut during that scuffle between Mosley and Clemons. The referee was seen spitting blood following the skirmish. Clemons was ejected for making contact with an official but it's unclear if Paganelli's injury resulted from Clemons' contact. 22:36 Dolphins interception Well, that was at least some sign of life from the Jets. Boyle manages to string together a 17-play, seven-minute play before makes the interception. Well, it was good while it lasted. For those of you still keepig count, that brings the Jets' tally to six punts and two interceptions through eight offensive possesions. 22:31 Phillips carted off in tears On the replay, Phillips appears to have torn something after a pass rush step and could be looking at a season-ending injury. The 24-year-old is in tears as he taken off the field on the back of the golf cart. 22:26 Jaelan Phillips is down The Dolphins lineback has gone down on the field and remains down. It does not look good for Phillips with the entire sideline on the field to check on hgim and th cart has come out. He's now carted off with what appears to be a lower leg injury. The MetLife turf claims yet another victim. 22:11 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 27-6 Jets Tagovailoa hands off to Mostert, who weaves his wy through the Jets defense and into the end zone to open the Dolphins' final quarter with a rushing touchdown. It rounds off a 15-play, 92-yard drive that lasted nine minutes and sees them go up three scores. And tensions are clearly runmning high for New York now as the extra point sparks a scuffle. C.J. Mosley and Micheal Clemons are flagged for personal fouls, with Clemons' penalty also enforced because it occurrs against an official. 22:10 End of the third quarter Not too much to report from the third quarter. Well, nothing Jets fans will want to hear anyway. The Dolphins dominated possession, having the ball for 13 minutes of the quarter and they'll have a first-and-10 from the Jets' 14-yard line when the fourth quarter begins. The Jets... well do I really need to say? 22:06 Tua is playing through the pain Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa suffers GRUESOME cut on his arm WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was left bloodied in the NFL's first ever Black Friday game, after suffering a gruesome cut on his right arm. Mail Online 21:58 Jets start their second half in the same woeful fashion as the first Boos are echoing around MetLife Stadium now as Jets fans are forced to suffer through yet another woeful drive that ends in, you guessed it, another punt. That's the sixth of the game. The Jets’ first drive after halftime lasted just three plays, including Wilkins' brutal sack on Boyle before New York punts once again. New York's seven offensive possessions have ended with punts and the interception for a six pick return. Where's Zach Wilson? At least he could get them within goal range... sometimes. 21:48 FIELD GOAL! Dolphins 20-6 Jets It's a Dolphins drive to start the third quarter but Bryce Huff records a sack on Tagolvailoa to force a Jason Sanders field goal. Sanders' 54-yard attempt is straight down the middle and the Dolphins extend their lead to 20-6. Miami traveled seven plays and 39 yards in just under four minutes, including a Jaylen Waddle 32-yard connection on third down. 21:42 Safe to say Jevon Holland enjoyed that one... 21:40 HALFTIME: Dolphins 17-6 Jets Crushing end to the first half for the hosts. Just as the Jets looked to have clawed their way back into the game with Echols' pick six handing them a lifeline, Tom Boyle's intercepted Hail Mary knocks them back once again. New quarterback, same old problems for New York. 21:27 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 17-6 Jets Unbelievable scenes at MetLife Stadium as the Dolphins swiftly follow up the Jets' pick-six with one of their own. The Jets attempt a Hail Mary with two seconds left on the clock in the second quarter... which turns into a 99-yard pick-six for the Dolphins. Boyle launches it down the field in a desperate attempt to find someone - anyone - in the end zone, and he finds exactly the wrong person as Holland intercepts the ball before charging the entire length of the field. New York flails around the field as they fail to stop Holland and he cruises into the end zone. Crushing blow for the Jets defense, who have their pick six rewarded by their offense throwing one. 21:19 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 10-6 Jets The Jets are finally on the board. I repeat, the Jets are FINALLY on the board. Echols picks off Tua, who tries to find Berrios, and walks it into the end zone to score the first touchdown for the Jets. They fail to close the gap further however, as Zuerlein misses the kick. In his defense, he's not had much practice kicking extra points this season. MetLife Stadium finally has something to cheer about... it's been a while. 21:07 And the calls from Jets fans for Zach Wilson's return have already begun 21:06 Jets punt... AGAIN Jaelan Phillips catches Boyle by surprise, breaking through the Jets' o-line and gets a hand to the quarterback's pass to tip it at the line pof scrimmage He can't quite reel in the ball for the interception... but the drive ends with a fourth consecutive punt. 20:59 Take a look at the first TD of the game 20:54 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 10-0 Jets Tagovailoa finds Hill for the receving touchdown to extend the Dolphins' lead to 10-0. Hill hauls in the ball and evades the tackle from Jordan Whitehead, sending the safety sprawling and jogs into the end zone. It marks the wide receiver's 10th receiving touchdown of the season and he celebrates by handing the scoring ball to his new wife, Keeta, in the stands. 20:51 Aaron Rodgers all smiles on the sidelines 20:49 End of the first quarter The Jets' third drive starts with a five yard loss after Breece Hall dropped a handoff from Tim Boyle, they fumbled on first down and recovered. On third-and-ten, Brownlee was flagged for a false start and at the end of the first quarter the Dolphins still lead 3-0 - and have barely been threatened by the Jets. 20:47 Tua hits the 3,000-yard mark Tua Tagovailoa hits the 3,000-yard mark for the seocnd consecutive season. The quarterback becomes the first Dolphins player not called Dan Marino to throw for 3,000-plus yards in the first 11 games of a season. 20:40 FIELD GOAL! Dolphins 3-0 Jets There's finally some points on the board! After the previous decision to go for it on fourth down failed, McDaniel opts for a different approach. On a fourth-and-1 from the Jets’ 20-yard line, the Dolphins go for a 38-yard field goal which is safely through the posts. 20:38 New York punts The Dolphins offense may not be soring any points - yet - but the defense nearly does. aelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb nearly sack Tim Boyle in the end zone for a safety. The Jets QB manages to heave the ball away to keep the Jets drive alive - just - but a couple of plays later New York punts AGAIN. 20:33 Jets force the turnover Tagovailoa can't lead the Dolphins into the endzone and on fourth-and-goal, Mike McDaniel opts to go for it. But Hill can't make the catch with the ball slipping through his hands. The Jets force the turnover, taking over from their own five-yard line. 20:30 Tua playing through a slash to his arm Tua is proving just how tough he is as the Miami quarterback is spotted playing on despite bearing a deep gash on his right arm. It's not clear how the signal caller sustained the cut but he has been sporting since the first drive. It looks like the lefty is missing a chunk out of his arm - right in the middle of his tattoo sleeve. 20:27 Sauce saves the TD Sauce Gardner bails out the Jets with great on-on-one coverage with Hill in the end zone to prevent th Dolphins touchdown on fourth down. 20:21 Hill comes hopping off Reed is fortunate just to catch up with him before managing to bring him down with a tackle from behind. Hill comes hobbling off and looks to be in some pain on the sideline. But Dolphins fans can rest easy as Hill sits out just the on play before he comes running back on. He had a quick exam on his left foot before being given the all clear to return. Medicare express. 20:20 Robert Saleh throws a challenge flag The Jets head coach has gone early with his challenge. Saleh has challenged a five-yard catch from Raheem Mostert, which was originally ruled a catch, with Mostert havign recoevered his own fumble. But the gamble pays off as the clall is overruled, saving Saleh from looking like a fool with such an early challenge in the first quarter. The catch was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass. Dolphins now have second-and-ten from their own 26-yard line. 20:14 Dolphins take over Tim Boyle's first start since 2021 featured one first down and the Jets first drive is over. On a third-and-long the Jets fail to convert in a critical spot - story of the season - and the hosts are forced to punt, which doesn't even cross the 50 yard line. Now it's Tua Tagovailoa's turn to come out with the Dolphins taking over from their own 15-yard line. 20:08 Jets' First Down Boyle, who is chanelling his inner Aaron Rodgers with a hard count, finds Brownlee, who is getting a chance today due to Lazard's healthy scratch, on 3&2. There's a flag on the play, offisde for the Dolphins' defense. And that is a Jets' first down! 20:05 We're underway! And it's the Jets who receive as Tim Boyle begins his first drive as New York's starting QB... but the hosts' first play only makes it one yard. 19:53 Where it all went wrong for Wilson... How it all went wrong for Zach Wilson with the New York Jets For Zach Wilson, the 2023 season was supposed to be a kind of football rehab. Instead the New York Jets quarterback has been tossed back into the fire, where his struggles only worsened. Mail Online 19:49 Miami's MetLife takeover The Dolphins fans have hit the Big Apple in their droves today as they look to have overtaken MetLife Stadium. 19:42 Zach Wilson doesn't believe he's 'scapegoated' for New York Jets' offensive woes Tim Boyle will be suiting up as QB1 for New York this afternoon after Zach Wilson was demoted. But Wilson doesn't think he's being 'scapegoated' by his demotion to the teams' third-string. 'I don't think I was scapegoated. Absolutely not,' Wilson said Tuesday. 'You've got to look at the situation. We're not scoring touchdowns.' 'Regardless of what I'm doing, my job as a quarterback is to help us score points,' Wilson continued. 'I can sit here and say I've had a bunch of growth and tremendous whatever this year, but if you're not scoring touchdowns, it doesn't matter.' 19:30 Aaron Rodgers is in the house The quarterback is once again at MetLife Stadium to cheer on his teammates from the sideline. The veteran has been sidelined since Week 1 when he tore his Achilles just four plays into his Jets debut. Rodgers, dressed in all black, was seen striding into the stadium a couple of hours before the game starts as he makes a desperate attempt to return to the field for the postseason - or even before! 19:27 $44m man Allen Lazard listed as INACTIVE Allen Lazard is a shock inactive for the Jets to face the Dolphins. The $44million man, who is a favorite of Aaron Rodgers, was not listed on the team's injury report heading into the game. The move raises some eyebrows with the Jets benching the wideout after splashing out in the summer to bring him to the Big Apple and reunite him with Rodgers. The inactive opens the door to opportunities for Irvin Charles and Jason Brownlee To no one's surprise, Zach Wilson is also inactive for today's game after his demotion to third-string quarterback earlier this week. OL Mekhi Becton, DL Carl Lawson, OL Austin Deculus, and Sam Eguavoen are also listed as the Jets' other inactives. 19:19 Bomb threat hours before game The shopping mall located next to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey was evacuated due to a bomb threat just hours before the Jets play the Miami Dolphins in the NFL's first-ever Black Friday game. At around 8:15am on Friday morning, New Jersey State Police issued a public safety alert that told visitors in the American Dream Mall, including employees, to evacuate. Then, in a post on X - formerly known as Twitter - New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy wrote that police were investigating a threat and shoppers should evacuate 'out of an abundance of caution.' However, around an hour later, he updated citizens and told them law enforcement said there was 'no imminent threat' and the mall was allowed to reopen. Shopping mall next to MetLife Stadium evacuated due to a bomb threat At around 8:15am on Friday morning, New Jersey State Police issued a public safety alert that told visitors in the American Dream Mall, including employees, to evacuate.

Good afternoon and welcome to DailyMail.com's coverage of the AFC East showdown between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets. This afternoon's game is making history as it marks the NFL's first Black Friday game. The hosts head into the Week 12 matchup in desparate need of a win after losing its last three. Tim Boyle steps in at quarterback for the Jets after struggling Zach Wilson was benched during their previous game against the Buffalo Bills and demoted to third-string by head coach Robert Saleh. Meanwhile, the Dolphins are the clear favorites to win, sitting top of the AFC East with a 7-3 record. Stick around as we bring you all the buildup, updates and live score from MetLife Stadium.

Queensland state’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles on Friday confirmed the A$2.7 billion (U.S.$1.8 billion) redevelopment of the stadium, widely known as the Gabba, would go ahead after the government accepted a project validation report. Miles said the project would increase the seating capacity of the stadium to 50,000 and connect the Gabba, which has been the state’s cricket headquarters for more than a century, with a new underground rail station. A local primary school will be relocated to make way for the stadium's bigger footprint. Cricket teams and the Brisbane Lions, a leading club in the Australian Football League, will also be temporarily relocated during the building phase. Miles said construction would take four years, starting after the Gabba hosts an Ashes cricket test against England in late 2025, and be completed in 2030. “That project validation report assessed four possible options for the Gabba and identified that a demolition and rebuild provided the best possible outcome, the best value outcome for the city,” Miles said. \"It will be a well connected stadium but most importantly, it will trigger the urban renewal that we want to see ... it will be one of the best parts of the city to live in.” Brisbane was selected as the 2032 Olympic host in July 2021 without a rival bid, making it the third Australian city to host the Summer Games after Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. The Brisbane bid was described by the IOC at the time as “a passion-driven, athlete-centric offer from a sports-loving nation.” Events will be staged across Queensland state, including the Gold Coast, which hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The Queensland state government is the main backer of the games, along with local councils from Brisbane and surrounding cities and with financial support from Australia's federal government. The Brisbane bid said the hosts already had 84% of stadiums and event venues in place to fit the IOC’s modern demand of avoiding excessive spending and potential white-elephant projects. Initial plans called for an upgrade for the Gabba.","pubDate":"2023-11-24 21:16:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"japantoday","source_priority":27031,"country":["japan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"173071f899c989dedc59155ef4cc03a0","title":"Sport | CSA slaps DA's 'quotas' claim for six: It's an attempt to gain political mileage","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/cricket/proteas/csa-slaps-das-quotas-claim-for-six-its-an-attempt-to-gain-political-mileage-20231124","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket South Africa flat-batted the Democratic Alliance's pronouncements on transformation targets, saying the party was looking to gain political mileage.","content":"Cricket South Africa came out strongly against the Democratic Alliance's statement on transformation targets, saying the party's portrayal of targets is an attempt to gain political mileage. South Africa's official opposition party voiced their concerns and disregard about transformation targets this week in a statement as CSA's boys' and girls' youth weeks loom. The DA complained about the enforcement of targets at the upcoming Under-19 Khaya Majola Week in Makhanda, which runs from 16-21 December.

CSA said the use of the term \"quotas\" detracted from the positive impact transformation targets have had on the sport. \"We believe, however, that the DA's portrayal of our initiatives is an attempt to gain political mileage and does not accurately reflect our long-term vision for the sport,\" the body said in a statement in response to detailed questions from News24. \"Our approach should not be misinterpreted as mere 'quotas'. Instead, these are carefully considered development targets that aim to rectify historical imbalances and nurture a more inclusive and diverse environment within cricket.

Nkwe credited schools for taking the lead in transformation matters. \"I think there's a lack of education around the importance of transforming the sport,\" Nkwe said. \"When it comes up every so often, we do gear and avail ourselves to educate, but we know the rate at which our world is growing, and there are things we need to get right. \"We've realised that we can't stop educating people for a better understanding, and we go over and above in that path. \"The schools have been brilliant and key in this regard.\"","pubDate":"2023-11-24 19:36:30","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1212/ac70762e750c4ba2b628cc74e3a57e48.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8875fe0c2f25f40cd79da120579012b4","title":"Women's Premier League Auction To Be Held In Mumbai On December 9","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/womens-premier-league-auction-to-be-held-in-mumbai-on-december-9-4604123","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The players' auction ahead of the 2024 edition of the Women's Premier League (WPL) will be held on December 9 in Mumbai, the BCCI announced on Friday.","content":"The players' auction ahead of the 2024 edition of the Women's Premier League (WPL) will be held on December 9 in Mumbai, the BCCI announced on Friday.

That's all from us! Aaron Rodgers may be desperately working to return from injury but after today's game he may not want to. Hopes of seeing the quarterback playoffs took a huge blow as it looks like the Jets won't even be seeing the postseason themselves. Meanwhile, Micke McDaniel will be heading back to SoFlo on Cloud Nine as his Dolphins helped their chances of taking a home field advantage into the postseason. 23:05 FINAL: Dolphins 34-13 Jets It's the same old story in New York. The Jets's switch of Tim Boyle for zach Wilson has reaped no rewards. It's a new quarterback but same old offensive issues in East Rutherford. Meanwhile, the dangerous Dolphins improved to 8-3. 22:55 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 34-13 Jets Most of the crowd has filed out into the parking lot by this point. Miami piles on the misery for New York by following up the Jets' first offensive touchdown of the game by scoring just one minute later. Mosert puts the icing on the cake of an impressive performance for the Dolphins by running it in for a 34-yard touchdown and his second of the game. He even has time to taunt New York's Tony Adams by slowing his pace and sending the defensive back zig zagging right on the line. 22:52 Holland heads to the medical tent Meanwhile, Jevon Holland - the hero of the game's Hell Mary - has entered the medical tent and has been listed as questionable to return with a knee injury. 22:47 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 27-13 Jets The Jets forced another Tua Tagovailoa turnover in the fourth quarter when he fumbled and Ashytn Davis recovered. It's Jets possession and Garrett Wilson tries to haul in a pass in the end zone but is well covered by Elliott and it's ruled incomplete. But the Jets manage to set up first-and-goal on the next play. This time Boyle does manage to find Wilson in the end zone for the Jets' first offensive touchdown of the game. It's only taken them 55 minutes... 22:43 Umpire left bloodied at skirmish Umpire Carl Paganelli appears to have been caught on the mouth and left with a cut during that scuffle between Mosley and Clemons. The referee was seen spitting blood following the skirmish. Clemons was ejected for making contact with an official but it's unclear if Paganelli's injury resulted from Clemons' contact. 22:36 Dolphins interception Well, that was at least some sign of life from the Jets. Boyle manages to string together a 17-play, seven-minute play before makes the interception. Well, it was good while it lasted. For those of you still keepig count, that brings the Jets' tally to six punts and two interceptions through eight offensive possesions. 22:31 Phillips carted off in tears On the replay, Phillips appears to have torn something after a pass rush step and could be looking at a season-ending injury. The 24-year-old is in tears as he taken off the field on the back of the golf cart. 22:26 Jaelan Phillips is down The Dolphins lineback has gone down on the field and remains down. It does not look good for Phillips with the entire sideline on the field to check on hgim and th cart has come out. He's now carted off with what appears to be a lower leg injury. The MetLife turf claims yet another victim. 22:11 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 27-6 Jets Tagovailoa hands off to Mostert, who weaves his wy through the Jets defense and into the end zone to open the Dolphins' final quarter with a rushing touchdown. It rounds off a 15-play, 92-yard drive that lasted nine minutes and sees them go up three scores. And tensions are clearly runmning high for New York now as the extra point sparks a scuffle. C.J. Mosley and Micheal Clemons are flagged for personal fouls, with Clemons' penalty also enforced because it occurrs against an official. 22:10 End of the third quarter Not too much to report from the third quarter. Well, nothing Jets fans will want to hear anyway. The Dolphins dominated possession, having the ball for 13 minutes of the quarter and they'll have a first-and-10 from the Jets' 14-yard line when the fourth quarter begins. The Jets... well do I really need to say? 22:06 Tua is playing through the pain Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa suffers GRUESOME cut on his arm WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was left bloodied in the NFL's first ever Black Friday game, after suffering a gruesome cut on his right arm. Mail Online 21:58 Jets start their second half in the same woeful fashion as the first Boos are echoing around MetLife Stadium now as Jets fans are forced to suffer through yet another woeful drive that ends in, you guessed it, another punt. That's the sixth of the game. The Jets’ first drive after halftime lasted just three plays, including Wilkins' brutal sack on Boyle before New York punts once again. New York's seven offensive possessions have ended with punts and the interception for a six pick return. Where's Zach Wilson? At least he could get them within goal range... sometimes. 21:48 FIELD GOAL! Dolphins 20-6 Jets It's a Dolphins drive to start the third quarter but Bryce Huff records a sack on Tagolvailoa to force a Jason Sanders field goal. Sanders' 54-yard attempt is straight down the middle and the Dolphins extend their lead to 20-6. Miami traveled seven plays and 39 yards in just under four minutes, including a Jaylen Waddle 32-yard connection on third down. 21:42 Safe to say Jevon Holland enjoyed that one... 21:40 HALFTIME: Dolphins 17-6 Jets Crushing end to the first half for the hosts. Just as the Jets looked to have clawed their way back into the game with Echols' pick six handing them a lifeline, Tom Boyle's intercepted Hail Mary knocks them back once again. New quarterback, same old problems for New York. 21:27 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 17-6 Jets Unbelievable scenes at MetLife Stadium as the Dolphins swiftly follow up the Jets' pick-six with one of their own. The Jets attempt a Hail Mary with two seconds left on the clock in the second quarter... which turns into a 99-yard pick-six for the Dolphins. Boyle launches it down the field in a desperate attempt to find someone - anyone - in the end zone, and he finds exactly the wrong person as Holland intercepts the ball before charging the entire length of the field. New York flails around the field as they fail to stop Holland and he cruises into the end zone. Crushing blow for the Jets defense, who have their pick six rewarded by their offense throwing one. 21:19 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 10-6 Jets The Jets are finally on the board. I repeat, the Jets are FINALLY on the board. Echols picks off Tua, who tries to find Berrios, and walks it into the end zone to score the first touchdown for the Jets. They fail to close the gap further however, as Zuerlein misses the kick. In his defense, he's not had much practice kicking extra points this season. MetLife Stadium finally has something to cheer about... it's been a while. 21:07 And the calls from Jets fans for Zach Wilson's return have already begun 21:06 Jets punt... AGAIN Jaelan Phillips catches Boyle by surprise, breaking through the Jets' o-line and gets a hand to the quarterback's pass to tip it at the line pof scrimmage He can't quite reel in the ball for the interception... but the drive ends with a fourth consecutive punt. 20:59 Take a look at the first TD of the game 20:54 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 10-0 Jets Tagovailoa finds Hill for the receving touchdown to extend the Dolphins' lead to 10-0. Hill hauls in the ball and evades the tackle from Jordan Whitehead, sending the safety sprawling and jogs into the end zone. It marks the wide receiver's 10th receiving touchdown of the season and he celebrates by handing the scoring ball to his new wife, Keeta, in the stands. 20:51 Aaron Rodgers all smiles on the sidelines 20:49 End of the first quarter The Jets' third drive starts with a five yard loss after Breece Hall dropped a handoff from Tim Boyle, they fumbled on first down and recovered. On third-and-ten, Brownlee was flagged for a false start and at the end of the first quarter the Dolphins still lead 3-0 - and have barely been threatened by the Jets. 20:47 Tua hits the 3,000-yard mark Tua Tagovailoa hits the 3,000-yard mark for the seocnd consecutive season. The quarterback becomes the first Dolphins player not called Dan Marino to throw for 3,000-plus yards in the first 11 games of a season. 20:40 FIELD GOAL! Dolphins 3-0 Jets There's finally some points on the board! After the previous decision to go for it on fourth down failed, McDaniel opts for a different approach. On a fourth-and-1 from the Jets’ 20-yard line, the Dolphins go for a 38-yard field goal which is safely through the posts. 20:38 New York punts The Dolphins offense may not be soring any points - yet - but the defense nearly does. aelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb nearly sack Tim Boyle in the end zone for a safety. The Jets QB manages to heave the ball away to keep the Jets drive alive - just - but a couple of plays later New York punts AGAIN. 20:33 Jets force the turnover Tagovailoa can't lead the Dolphins into the endzone and on fourth-and-goal, Mike McDaniel opts to go for it. But Hill can't make the catch with the ball slipping through his hands. The Jets force the turnover, taking over from their own five-yard line. 20:30 Tua playing through a slash to his arm Tua is proving just how tough he is as the Miami quarterback is spotted playing on despite bearing a deep gash on his right arm. It's not clear how the signal caller sustained the cut but he has been sporting since the first drive. It looks like the lefty is missing a chunk out of his arm - right in the middle of his tattoo sleeve. 20:27 Sauce saves the TD Sauce Gardner bails out the Jets with great on-on-one coverage with Hill in the end zone to prevent th Dolphins touchdown on fourth down. 20:21 Hill comes hopping off Reed is fortunate just to catch up with him before managing to bring him down with a tackle from behind. Hill comes hobbling off and looks to be in some pain on the sideline. But Dolphins fans can rest easy as Hill sits out just the on play before he comes running back on. He had a quick exam on his left foot before being given the all clear to return. Medicare express. 20:20 Robert Saleh throws a challenge flag The Jets head coach has gone early with his challenge. Saleh has challenged a five-yard catch from Raheem Mostert, which was originally ruled a catch, with Mostert havign recoevered his own fumble. But the gamble pays off as the clall is overruled, saving Saleh from looking like a fool with such an early challenge in the first quarter. The catch was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass. Dolphins now have second-and-ten from their own 26-yard line. 20:14 Dolphins take over Tim Boyle's first start since 2021 featured one first down and the Jets first drive is over. On a third-and-long the Jets fail to convert in a critical spot - story of the season - and the hosts are forced to punt, which doesn't even cross the 50 yard line. Now it's Tua Tagovailoa's turn to come out with the Dolphins taking over from their own 15-yard line. 20:08 Jets' First Down Boyle, who is chanelling his inner Aaron Rodgers with a hard count, finds Brownlee, who is getting a chance today due to Lazard's healthy scratch, on 3&2. There's a flag on the play, offisde for the Dolphins' defense. And that is a Jets' first down! 20:05 We're underway! And it's the Jets who receive as Tim Boyle begins his first drive as New York's starting QB... but the hosts' first play only makes it one yard. 19:53 Where it all went wrong for Wilson... How it all went wrong for Zach Wilson with the New York Jets For Zach Wilson, the 2023 season was supposed to be a kind of football rehab. Instead the New York Jets quarterback has been tossed back into the fire, where his struggles only worsened. Mail Online 19:49 Miami's MetLife takeover The Dolphins fans have hit the Big Apple in their droves today as they look to have overtaken MetLife Stadium. 19:42 Zach Wilson doesn't believe he's 'scapegoated' for New York Jets' offensive woes Tim Boyle will be suiting up as QB1 for New York this afternoon after Zach Wilson was demoted. But Wilson doesn't think he's being 'scapegoated' by his demotion to the teams' third-string. 'I don't think I was scapegoated. Absolutely not,' Wilson said Tuesday. 'You've got to look at the situation. We're not scoring touchdowns.' 'Regardless of what I'm doing, my job as a quarterback is to help us score points,' Wilson continued. 'I can sit here and say I've had a bunch of growth and tremendous whatever this year, but if you're not scoring touchdowns, it doesn't matter.' 19:30 Aaron Rodgers is in the house The quarterback is once again at MetLife Stadium to cheer on his teammates from the sideline. The veteran has been sidelined since Week 1 when he tore his Achilles just four plays into his Jets debut. Rodgers, dressed in all black, was seen striding into the stadium a couple of hours before the game starts as he makes a desperate attempt to return to the field for the postseason - or even before! 19:27 $44m man Allen Lazard listed as INACTIVE Allen Lazard is a shock inactive for the Jets to face the Dolphins. The $44million man, who is a favorite of Aaron Rodgers, was not listed on the team's injury report heading into the game. The move raises some eyebrows with the Jets benching the wideout after splashing out in the summer to bring him to the Big Apple and reunite him with Rodgers. The inactive opens the door to opportunities for Irvin Charles and Jason Brownlee To no one's surprise, Zach Wilson is also inactive for today's game after his demotion to third-string quarterback earlier this week. OL Mekhi Becton, DL Carl Lawson, OL Austin Deculus, and Sam Eguavoen are also listed as the Jets' other inactives. 19:19 Bomb threat hours before game The shopping mall located next to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey was evacuated due to a bomb threat just hours before the Jets play the Miami Dolphins in the NFL's first-ever Black Friday game. At around 8:15am on Friday morning, New Jersey State Police issued a public safety alert that told visitors in the American Dream Mall, including employees, to evacuate. Then, in a post on X - formerly known as Twitter - New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy wrote that police were investigating a threat and shoppers should evacuate 'out of an abundance of caution.' However, around an hour later, he updated citizens and told them law enforcement said there was 'no imminent threat' and the mall was allowed to reopen. Shopping mall next to MetLife Stadium evacuated due to a bomb threat At around 8:15am on Friday morning, New Jersey State Police issued a public safety alert that told visitors in the American Dream Mall, including employees, to evacuate.

Queensland state’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles on Friday confirmed the A$2.7 billion (U.S.$1.8 billion) redevelopment of the stadium, widely known as the Gabba, would go ahead after the government accepted a project validation report. Miles said the project would increase the seating capacity of the stadium to 50,000 and connect the Gabba, which has been the state’s cricket headquarters for more than a century, with a new underground rail station. A local primary school will be relocated to make way for the stadium's bigger footprint. Cricket teams and the Brisbane Lions, a leading club in the Australian Football League, will also be temporarily relocated during the building phase. Miles said construction would take four years, starting after the Gabba hosts an Ashes cricket test against England in late 2025, and be completed in 2030. “That project validation report assessed four possible options for the Gabba and identified that a demolition and rebuild provided the best possible outcome, the best value outcome for the city,” Miles said. \"It will be a well connected stadium but most importantly, it will trigger the urban renewal that we want to see ... it will be one of the best parts of the city to live in.” Brisbane was selected as the 2032 Olympic host in July 2021 without a rival bid, making it the third Australian city to host the Summer Games after Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. The Brisbane bid was described by the IOC at the time as “a passion-driven, athlete-centric offer from a sports-loving nation.” Events will be staged across Queensland state, including the Gold Coast, which hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The Queensland state government is the main backer of the games, along with local councils from Brisbane and surrounding cities and with financial support from Australia's federal government. The Brisbane bid said the hosts already had 84% of stadiums and event venues in place to fit the IOC’s modern demand of avoiding excessive spending and potential white-elephant projects. Initial plans called for an upgrade for the Gabba.","pubDate":"2023-11-24 21:16:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"japantoday","source_priority":27031,"country":["japan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"173071f899c989dedc59155ef4cc03a0","title":"Sport | CSA slaps DA's 'quotas' claim for six: It's an attempt to gain political mileage","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/cricket/proteas/csa-slaps-das-quotas-claim-for-six-its-an-attempt-to-gain-political-mileage-20231124","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket South Africa flat-batted the Democratic Alliance's pronouncements on transformation targets, saying the party was looking to gain political mileage.","content":"Cricket South Africa came out strongly against the Democratic Alliance's statement on transformation targets, saying the party's portrayal of targets is an attempt to gain political mileage. South Africa's official opposition party voiced their concerns and disregard about transformation targets this week in a statement as CSA's boys' and girls' youth weeks loom. The DA complained about the enforcement of targets at the upcoming Under-19 Khaya Majola Week in Makhanda, which runs from 16-21 December. READ | SA U19 skipper's pro-Israeli award comments to form part of CSA board meeting discussions The DA didn't zoom in on a particular case but explained how targets are a \"discriminatory CSA policy smacks of political influence from the hopeless, soul-destroying ANC government\". CSA said the use of the term \"quotas\" detracted from the positive impact transformation targets have had on the sport. \"We believe, however, that the DA's portrayal of our initiatives is an attempt to gain political mileage and does not accurately reflect our long-term vision for the sport,\" the body said in a statement in response to detailed questions from News24. \"Our approach should not be misinterpreted as mere 'quotas'. Instead, these are carefully considered development targets that aim to rectify historical imbalances and nurture a more inclusive and diverse environment within cricket.

READ | Laura Wolvaardt confirmed as full-time Proteas Women captain Nkwe, a former first-class cricketer before moving into the coaching path, said the lack of education around transformation also often led to unnecessary statements. Nkwe credited schools for taking the lead in transformation matters. \"I think there's a lack of education around the importance of transforming the sport,\" Nkwe said. \"When it comes up every so often, we do gear and avail ourselves to educate, but we know the rate at which our world is growing, and there are things we need to get right. \"We've realised that we can't stop educating people for a better understanding, and we go over and above in that path. \"The schools have been brilliant and key in this regard.\"","pubDate":"2023-11-24 19:36:30","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1212/ac70762e750c4ba2b628cc74e3a57e48.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8875fe0c2f25f40cd79da120579012b4","title":"Women's Premier League Auction To Be Held In Mumbai On December 9","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/womens-premier-league-auction-to-be-held-in-mumbai-on-december-9-4604123","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The players' auction ahead of the 2024 edition of the Women's Premier League (WPL) will be held on December 9 in Mumbai, the BCCI announced on Friday.","content":"The players' auction ahead of the 2024 edition of the Women's Premier League (WPL) will be held on December 9 in Mumbai, the BCCI announced on Friday.

That's all from us! Aaron Rodgers may be desperately working to return from injury but after today's game he may not want to. Hopes of seeing the quarterback playoffs took a huge blow as it looks like the Jets won't even be seeing the postseason themselves. Meanwhile, Micke McDaniel will be heading back to SoFlo on Cloud Nine as his Dolphins helped their chances of taking a home field advantage into the postseason. 23:05 FINAL: Dolphins 34-13 Jets It's the same old story in New York. The Jets's switch of Tim Boyle for zach Wilson has reaped no rewards. It's a new quarterback but same old offensive issues in East Rutherford. Meanwhile, the dangerous Dolphins improved to 8-3. 22:55 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 34-13 Jets Most of the crowd has filed out into the parking lot by this point. Miami piles on the misery for New York by following up the Jets' first offensive touchdown of the game by scoring just one minute later. Mosert puts the icing on the cake of an impressive performance for the Dolphins by running it in for a 34-yard touchdown and his second of the game. He even has time to taunt New York's Tony Adams by slowing his pace and sending the defensive back zig zagging right on the line. 22:52 Holland heads to the medical tent Meanwhile, Jevon Holland - the hero of the game's Hell Mary - has entered the medical tent and has been listed as questionable to return with a knee injury. 22:47 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 27-13 Jets The Jets forced another Tua Tagovailoa turnover in the fourth quarter when he fumbled and Ashytn Davis recovered. It's Jets possession and Garrett Wilson tries to haul in a pass in the end zone but is well covered by Elliott and it's ruled incomplete. But the Jets manage to set up first-and-goal on the next play. This time Boyle does manage to find Wilson in the end zone for the Jets' first offensive touchdown of the game. It's only taken them 55 minutes... 22:43 Umpire left bloodied at skirmish Umpire Carl Paganelli appears to have been caught on the mouth and left with a cut during that scuffle between Mosley and Clemons. The referee was seen spitting blood following the skirmish. Clemons was ejected for making contact with an official but it's unclear if Paganelli's injury resulted from Clemons' contact. 22:36 Dolphins interception Well, that was at least some sign of life from the Jets. Boyle manages to string together a 17-play, seven-minute play before makes the interception. Well, it was good while it lasted. For those of you still keepig count, that brings the Jets' tally to six punts and two interceptions through eight offensive possesions. 22:31 Phillips carted off in tears On the replay, Phillips appears to have torn something after a pass rush step and could be looking at a season-ending injury. The 24-year-old is in tears as he taken off the field on the back of the golf cart. 22:26 Jaelan Phillips is down The Dolphins lineback has gone down on the field and remains down. It does not look good for Phillips with the entire sideline on the field to check on hgim and th cart has come out. He's now carted off with what appears to be a lower leg injury. The MetLife turf claims yet another victim. 22:11 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 27-6 Jets Tagovailoa hands off to Mostert, who weaves his wy through the Jets defense and into the end zone to open the Dolphins' final quarter with a rushing touchdown. It rounds off a 15-play, 92-yard drive that lasted nine minutes and sees them go up three scores. And tensions are clearly runmning high for New York now as the extra point sparks a scuffle. C.J. Mosley and Micheal Clemons are flagged for personal fouls, with Clemons' penalty also enforced because it occurrs against an official. 22:10 End of the third quarter Not too much to report from the third quarter. Well, nothing Jets fans will want to hear anyway. The Dolphins dominated possession, having the ball for 13 minutes of the quarter and they'll have a first-and-10 from the Jets' 14-yard line when the fourth quarter begins. The Jets... well do I really need to say? 22:06 Tua is playing through the pain Miami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa suffers GRUESOME cut on his arm WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was left bloodied in the NFL's first ever Black Friday game, after suffering a gruesome cut on his right arm. Mail Online 21:58 Jets start their second half in the same woeful fashion as the first Boos are echoing around MetLife Stadium now as Jets fans are forced to suffer through yet another woeful drive that ends in, you guessed it, another punt. That's the sixth of the game. The Jets’ first drive after halftime lasted just three plays, including Wilkins' brutal sack on Boyle before New York punts once again. New York's seven offensive possessions have ended with punts and the interception for a six pick return. Where's Zach Wilson? At least he could get them within goal range... sometimes. 21:48 FIELD GOAL! Dolphins 20-6 Jets It's a Dolphins drive to start the third quarter but Bryce Huff records a sack on Tagolvailoa to force a Jason Sanders field goal. Sanders' 54-yard attempt is straight down the middle and the Dolphins extend their lead to 20-6. Miami traveled seven plays and 39 yards in just under four minutes, including a Jaylen Waddle 32-yard connection on third down. 21:42 Safe to say Jevon Holland enjoyed that one... 21:40 HALFTIME: Dolphins 17-6 Jets Crushing end to the first half for the hosts. Just as the Jets looked to have clawed their way back into the game with Echols' pick six handing them a lifeline, Tom Boyle's intercepted Hail Mary knocks them back once again. New quarterback, same old problems for New York. 21:27 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 17-6 Jets Unbelievable scenes at MetLife Stadium as the Dolphins swiftly follow up the Jets' pick-six with one of their own. The Jets attempt a Hail Mary with two seconds left on the clock in the second quarter... which turns into a 99-yard pick-six for the Dolphins. Boyle launches it down the field in a desperate attempt to find someone - anyone - in the end zone, and he finds exactly the wrong person as Holland intercepts the ball before charging the entire length of the field. New York flails around the field as they fail to stop Holland and he cruises into the end zone. Crushing blow for the Jets defense, who have their pick six rewarded by their offense throwing one. 21:19 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 10-6 Jets The Jets are finally on the board. I repeat, the Jets are FINALLY on the board. Echols picks off Tua, who tries to find Berrios, and walks it into the end zone to score the first touchdown for the Jets. They fail to close the gap further however, as Zuerlein misses the kick. In his defense, he's not had much practice kicking extra points this season. MetLife Stadium finally has something to cheer about... it's been a while. 21:07 And the calls from Jets fans for Zach Wilson's return have already begun 21:06 Jets punt... AGAIN Jaelan Phillips catches Boyle by surprise, breaking through the Jets' o-line and gets a hand to the quarterback's pass to tip it at the line pof scrimmage He can't quite reel in the ball for the interception... but the drive ends with a fourth consecutive punt. 20:59 Take a look at the first TD of the game 20:54 TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 10-0 Jets Tagovailoa finds Hill for the receving touchdown to extend the Dolphins' lead to 10-0. Hill hauls in the ball and evades the tackle from Jordan Whitehead, sending the safety sprawling and jogs into the end zone. It marks the wide receiver's 10th receiving touchdown of the season and he celebrates by handing the scoring ball to his new wife, Keeta, in the stands. 20:51 Aaron Rodgers all smiles on the sidelines 20:49 End of the first quarter The Jets' third drive starts with a five yard loss after Breece Hall dropped a handoff from Tim Boyle, they fumbled on first down and recovered. On third-and-ten, Brownlee was flagged for a false start and at the end of the first quarter the Dolphins still lead 3-0 - and have barely been threatened by the Jets. 20:47 Tua hits the 3,000-yard mark Tua Tagovailoa hits the 3,000-yard mark for the seocnd consecutive season. The quarterback becomes the first Dolphins player not called Dan Marino to throw for 3,000-plus yards in the first 11 games of a season. 20:40 FIELD GOAL! Dolphins 3-0 Jets There's finally some points on the board! After the previous decision to go for it on fourth down failed, McDaniel opts for a different approach. On a fourth-and-1 from the Jets’ 20-yard line, the Dolphins go for a 38-yard field goal which is safely through the posts. 20:38 New York punts The Dolphins offense may not be soring any points - yet - but the defense nearly does. aelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb nearly sack Tim Boyle in the end zone for a safety. The Jets QB manages to heave the ball away to keep the Jets drive alive - just - but a couple of plays later New York punts AGAIN. 20:33 Jets force the turnover Tagovailoa can't lead the Dolphins into the endzone and on fourth-and-goal, Mike McDaniel opts to go for it. But Hill can't make the catch with the ball slipping through his hands. The Jets force the turnover, taking over from their own five-yard line. 20:30 Tua playing through a slash to his arm Tua is proving just how tough he is as the Miami quarterback is spotted playing on despite bearing a deep gash on his right arm. It's not clear how the signal caller sustained the cut but he has been sporting since the first drive. It looks like the lefty is missing a chunk out of his arm - right in the middle of his tattoo sleeve. 20:27 Sauce saves the TD Sauce Gardner bails out the Jets with great on-on-one coverage with Hill in the end zone to prevent th Dolphins touchdown on fourth down. 20:21 Hill comes hopping off Reed is fortunate just to catch up with him before managing to bring him down with a tackle from behind. Hill comes hobbling off and looks to be in some pain on the sideline. But Dolphins fans can rest easy as Hill sits out just the on play before he comes running back on. He had a quick exam on his left foot before being given the all clear to return. Medicare express. 20:20 Robert Saleh throws a challenge flag The Jets head coach has gone early with his challenge. Saleh has challenged a five-yard catch from Raheem Mostert, which was originally ruled a catch, with Mostert havign recoevered his own fumble. But the gamble pays off as the clall is overruled, saving Saleh from looking like a fool with such an early challenge in the first quarter. The catch was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass. Dolphins now have second-and-ten from their own 26-yard line. 20:14 Dolphins take over Tim Boyle's first start since 2021 featured one first down and the Jets first drive is over. On a third-and-long the Jets fail to convert in a critical spot - story of the season - and the hosts are forced to punt, which doesn't even cross the 50 yard line. Now it's Tua Tagovailoa's turn to come out with the Dolphins taking over from their own 15-yard line. 20:08 Jets' First Down Boyle, who is chanelling his inner Aaron Rodgers with a hard count, finds Brownlee, who is getting a chance today due to Lazard's healthy scratch, on 3&2. There's a flag on the play, offisde for the Dolphins' defense. And that is a Jets' first down! 20:05 We're underway! And it's the Jets who receive as Tim Boyle begins his first drive as New York's starting QB... but the hosts' first play only makes it one yard. 19:53 Where it all went wrong for Wilson... How it all went wrong for Zach Wilson with the New York Jets For Zach Wilson, the 2023 season was supposed to be a kind of football rehab. Instead the New York Jets quarterback has been tossed back into the fire, where his struggles only worsened. Mail Online 19:49 Miami's MetLife takeover The Dolphins fans have hit the Big Apple in their droves today as they look to have overtaken MetLife Stadium. 19:42 Zach Wilson doesn't believe he's 'scapegoated' for New York Jets' offensive woes Tim Boyle will be suiting up as QB1 for New York this afternoon after Zach Wilson was demoted. But Wilson doesn't think he's being 'scapegoated' by his demotion to the teams' third-string. 'I don't think I was scapegoated. Absolutely not,' Wilson said Tuesday. 'You've got to look at the situation. We're not scoring touchdowns.' 'Regardless of what I'm doing, my job as a quarterback is to help us score points,' Wilson continued. 'I can sit here and say I've had a bunch of growth and tremendous whatever this year, but if you're not scoring touchdowns, it doesn't matter.' 19:30 Aaron Rodgers is in the house The quarterback is once again at MetLife Stadium to cheer on his teammates from the sideline. The veteran has been sidelined since Week 1 when he tore his Achilles just four plays into his Jets debut. Rodgers, dressed in all black, was seen striding into the stadium a couple of hours before the game starts as he makes a desperate attempt to return to the field for the postseason - or even before! 19:27 $44m man Allen Lazard listed as INACTIVE Allen Lazard is a shock inactive for the Jets to face the Dolphins. The $44million man, who is a favorite of Aaron Rodgers, was not listed on the team's injury report heading into the game. The move raises some eyebrows with the Jets benching the wideout after splashing out in the summer to bring him to the Big Apple and reunite him with Rodgers. The inactive opens the door to opportunities for Irvin Charles and Jason Brownlee To no one's surprise, Zach Wilson is also inactive for today's game after his demotion to third-string quarterback earlier this week. OL Mekhi Becton, DL Carl Lawson, OL Austin Deculus, and Sam Eguavoen are also listed as the Jets' other inactives. 19:19 Bomb threat hours before game The shopping mall located next to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey was evacuated due to a bomb threat just hours before the Jets play the Miami Dolphins in the NFL's first-ever Black Friday game. At around 8:15am on Friday morning, New Jersey State Police issued a public safety alert that told visitors in the American Dream Mall, including employees, to evacuate. Then, in a post on X - formerly known as Twitter - New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy wrote that police were investigating a threat and shoppers should evacuate 'out of an abundance of caution.' However, around an hour later, he updated citizens and told them law enforcement said there was 'no imminent threat' and the mall was allowed to reopen. Shopping mall next to MetLife Stadium evacuated due to a bomb threat At around 8:15am on Friday morning, New Jersey State Police issued a public safety alert that told visitors in the American Dream Mall, including employees, to evacuate. Mail Online 19:17 Tis the season... In honor of Black Friday, the Jets have switched out their usual green home uniforms for all black ones, including a mean matching helmet 19:13 Welcome! Good afternoon and welcome to DailyMail.com's coverage of the AFC East showdown between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets. This afternoon's game is making history as it marks the NFL's first Black Friday game. The hosts head into the Week 12 matchup in desparate need of a win after losing its last three. Tim Boyle steps in at quarterback for the Jets after struggling Zach Wilson was benched during their previous game against the Buffalo Bills and demoted to third-string by head coach Robert Saleh. Meanwhile, the Dolphins are the clear favorites to win, sitting top of the AFC East with a 7-3 record. Stick around as we bring you all the buildup, updates and live score from MetLife Stadium.

Queensland state’s Deputy Premier…","content":"The cricket stadium that Brisbane Olympics backers pitched as the centerpiece venue for the 2032 Summer Games is set to be demolished and rebuilt. Queensland state’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles on Friday confirmed the A$2.7 billion (U.S.$1.8 billion) redevelopment of the stadium, widely known as the Gabba, would go ahead after the government accepted a project validation report. Miles said the project would increase the seating capacity of the stadium to 50,000 and connect the Gabba, which has been the state’s cricket headquarters for more than a century, with a new underground rail station. A local primary school will be relocated to make way for the stadium's bigger footprint. Cricket teams and the Brisbane Lions, a leading club in the Australian Football League, will also be temporarily relocated during the building phase. Miles said construction would take four years, starting after the Gabba hosts an Ashes cricket test against England in late 2025, and be completed in 2030. “That project validation report assessed four possible options for the Gabba and identified that a demolition and rebuild provided the best possible outcome, the best value outcome for the city,” Miles said. \"It will be a well connected stadium but most importantly, it will trigger the urban renewal that we want to see ... it will be one of the best parts of the city to live in.” Brisbane was selected as the 2032 Olympic host in July 2021 without a rival bid, making it the third Australian city to host the Summer Games after Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. The Brisbane bid was described by the IOC at the time as “a passion-driven, athlete-centric offer from a sports-loving nation.” Events will be staged across Queensland state, including the Gold Coast, which hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The Queensland state government is the main backer of the games, along with local councils from Brisbane and surrounding cities and with financial support from Australia's federal government. The Brisbane bid said the hosts already had 84% of stadiums and event venues in place to fit the IOC’s modern demand of avoiding excessive spending and potential white-elephant projects. Initial plans called for an upgrade for the Gabba.","pubDate":"2023-11-24 21:16:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"japantoday","source_priority":27031,"country":["japan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"173071f899c989dedc59155ef4cc03a0","title":"Sport | CSA slaps DA's 'quotas' claim for six: It's an attempt to gain political mileage","link":"https://www.news24.com/sport/cricket/proteas/csa-slaps-das-quotas-claim-for-six-its-an-attempt-to-gain-political-mileage-20231124","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket South Africa flat-batted the Democratic Alliance's pronouncements on transformation targets, saying the party was looking to gain political mileage.","content":"Cricket South Africa came out strongly against the Democratic Alliance's statement on transformation targets, saying the party's portrayal of targets is an attempt to gain political mileage. South Africa's official opposition party voiced their concerns and disregard about transformation targets this week in a statement as CSA's boys' and girls' youth weeks loom. The DA complained about the enforcement of targets at the upcoming Under-19 Khaya Majola Week in Makhanda, which runs from 16-21 December. READ | SA U19 skipper's pro-Israeli award comments to form part of CSA board meeting discussions The DA didn't zoom in on a particular case but explained how targets are a \"discriminatory CSA policy smacks of political influence from the hopeless, soul-destroying ANC government\". CSA said the use of the term \"quotas\" detracted from the positive impact transformation targets have had on the sport. \"We believe, however, that the DA's portrayal of our initiatives is an attempt to gain political mileage and does not accurately reflect our long-term vision for the sport,\" the body said in a statement in response to detailed questions from News24. \"Our approach should not be misinterpreted as mere 'quotas'. Instead, these are carefully considered development targets that aim to rectify historical imbalances and nurture a more inclusive and diverse environment within cricket.

READ | Laura Wolvaardt confirmed as full-time Proteas Women captain Nkwe, a former first-class cricketer before moving into the coaching path, said the lack of education around transformation also often led to unnecessary statements. Nkwe credited schools for taking the lead in transformation matters. \"I think there's a lack of education around the importance of transforming the sport,\" Nkwe said. \"When it comes up every so often, we do gear and avail ourselves to educate, but we know the rate at which our world is growing, and there are things we need to get right. \"We've realised that we can't stop educating people for a better understanding, and we go over and above in that path. \"The schools have been brilliant and key in this regard.\"","pubDate":"2023-11-24 19:36:30","image_url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1212/ac70762e750c4ba2b628cc74e3a57e48.jpg","source_id":"news24","source_priority":1882,"country":["south africa"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"8875fe0c2f25f40cd79da120579012b4","title":"Women's Premier League Auction To Be Held In Mumbai On December 9","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/womens-premier-league-auction-to-be-held-in-mumbai-on-december-9-4604123","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The players' auction ahead of the 2024 edition of the Women's Premier League (WPL) will be held on December 9 in Mumbai, the BCCI announced on Friday.","content":"The players' auction ahead of the 2024 edition of the Women's Premier League (WPL) will be held on December 9 in Mumbai, the BCCI announced on Friday.
