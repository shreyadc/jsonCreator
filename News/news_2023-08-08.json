Swimmer Young set a new time of 24.47 seconds to win bronze. The old record was held by Epeli Rabua when he set it at 25.85 seconds in 2018. Female swimmer Anahira Mccutcheon clocked a time of 29.16s in the 50m butterfly and finished 13th at the championships. According to coach Ester Malani the swim results on Day 1 were fantastic. Both swimmers are based overseas with 17-year-old Young in the United States and 13-year-old Mccutcheon in New Zealand. Malani said their preparation was good. Meanwhile, Team Fiji cyclists Don Younger and Aiden Caine finished 25th and 28th respectively in their first event, the men’s Individual Time trial at The Brian Lara Cricket Stadium.

The Rangers and Scotland legend is holding court in an east London pub and is in fine form as he reflects on a punditry and co-commentary career that, whether he wants to dispute it or not, has made him one of the most liked - and sought-after - in the game. Being crowned Pundit of the Year at the British Sports Journalism Awards back in March was a sign of how successfully McCoist has established himself at the top of the game , but it is not something he is ever ready to take for granted. ‘My older boys are very much on social media and I am trying to hang on by joining Instagram and kidding myself I'm 19 or 20 again! But they keep me up to speed and they'll let me know when things aren't going my way. Ally McCoist is taking his talents to TNT Sports ahead of the new Premier League season The much-loved pundit and co-commentator has established himself as one of the best in the business He has former quite the relationship with Laura Woods, who will be the lead presenter for the channel's coverage ‘If [fans are] happy and have been complimentary they keep me in touch with what has been said. You're only a couple of mistakes away from falling off that cliff. I am very lucky, very lucky.’ TNT Sports is McCoist’s latest venture, another string to a bow that has already seen him land gigs at Sky Sports, ITV, ViaPlay Sports and on the radio with talkSPORT. It was there that he teamed up with Laura Woods on the talkSPORT breakfast show Monday through Wednesday for three years. In what perhaps initially seemed an unlikely duo on paper from the off, they immediately clicked, so much so that McCoist was holding back tears on the day she announced her departure. Now they will reunite at TNT Sports with Woods poached to be host of the rebranded channel and McCoist could not be any happier. ‘She's magic, she's fantastic,’ the TNT Sports pundit and co-commentator says, lighting up when asked about Woods. 'Genuinely we absolutely hit it off immediately. She's a great girl who is very, very good at what she does. ‘She absolutely knows her stuff, whether it is football - she’s a big Arsenal fan - and boxing she's really knowledgable. She'd let me lead occasionally for the cricket and the irony of that won't be lost on you lot with a Scotsman leading on the cricket! She was getting into the cricket as well and is knowledgeable on her rugby so listen, the reason she is where she is is because she's very good, that's the bottom line. ‘Am I biased? Of course I'm biased but she is very good and this is going to be perfect for her, this is an ideal opportunity for her to kick on and I think she'll grab it.’ McCoist speaks highly of Woods, who he said is 'a great girl who is very, very good at what she does' Woods will take to screens to cover a Premier League game on the channel for the first time this weekend ‘Remarkable’ is another word he uses for Woods. In fact, he uses a series of superlatives to describe a colleague he now sees as a close friend. ‘She’s great, great fun. Great to be around. There’s no airs and graces.’ One of the most striking things about sitting down with McCoist is how deferential he is when it comes to the figures behind his success. There is plenty of praise for stats gurus - the ‘anoraks’ as he calls them - that prep him for commentary with a bible of match stats; there are the ‘great’ people he has worked alongside, whether that be presenters or a lead commentator, and yet his refusal to believe much of the hype around himself only adds to his likeability. McCoist, 60, has never been a stranger when it comes to the media, whether that was as a team captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport from 1996 to 2007, being the voice of EA Sports’ FIFA video game series until 2005 alongside John Motson, or since 2010, becoming the voice for fans in the commentary booth or on the touchline as a pundit. The Rangers and Scotland icon has a crystal clear hierarchy though when it comes to enjoying the game. McCoist is humble, insisting he is 'very, very lucky' that fans enjoy his broadcasting work ‘I still say playing is the best by some distance,’ McCoist says. ‘I loved the coaching and management side as well, however, [commentary] is by far and away the next best thing. ‘Sitting, on the halfway line, arguably the best seats in the house, watching the best players and the best teams in the world. There’s your answer. ‘It’s magic. Fantastic. It’s an opportunity that everybody would love to have. We all love the game but being able to comment on it, talk about it, all the best players, I can't tell you how much I love it.’ McCoist is now landing some of the game’s biggest assignments, one of which was the World Cup final in Qatar. The 60-year-old has admitted playing tops broadcasting, but commentary 'is by far and away the next best thing' Champions League co-commentary is on the agenda for the season ahead... but a trip to Cheltenham is not! ‘That is probably the nearest buzz I've had to playing again... brilliant,’ he adds. For now he shows no desire to slow it down despite his hectic workload - not least with wife Vivien actively encouraging to have him out of the house - but with Champions League co-commentary on the agenda for this forthcoming season it seems like his annual pilgrimage to Cheltenham may be one sporting pastime that will have to fall by the wayside. ‘I’m afraid it looks like I’ll be missing Cheltenham,’ he says with that famed chuckle, taking us back to where we started. ‘I don’t mind missing the odd Champion’s Hurdle…’ TNT Sports is the ultimate home for sports fans.

Last month, the ICC amended its Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel after Australian opener Usman Khawaja contacted ICC general manager Wasim Khan about revising the sanctions for slow over-rates. Under the new regulations, teams are fined five per cent of their match fee and one WTC point for every over they fail to bowl in the allotted time, capping fines to 50 per cent. Australia was fined ten WTC points and 50 per cent of their match fee for slow over-rates during England’s first innings in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, England lost 19 WTC points for over-rate transgressions at Edgbaston, Lord’s and The Oval, collectively penalised about $198,000 in match fees across the five-Test campaign. Teams received 12 WTC points for a victory and four points for a draw during the Ashes series. “Don’t even get the chance to bowl in the second innings at Manchester due to two days of rain and the ICC still issue fines and take 10 WTC points of us for slow over rates,” Khawaja tweeted last week . “That makes a lot of sense …” Speaking to the Daily Mail this week, Broad argued the ICC’s over-rate penalties needed further revision. “It diminishes the relevance of the World Test Championship, to be honest,” he told the publication. “It’s been one of the most entertaining series of all time and for England to come out with nine points from a possible 60, the system’s wrong and needs looking at.” Broad retired from international cricket after the fifth Ashes Test, finishing his 16-year career with 4309 runs and 847 wickets.

The Australians missed the 2021 WTC final due to poor over-rates during the 2020 Boxing Day Test against India. Speaking to reporters last month, Australian captain Pat Cummins explained why teams were struggling to get through their overs during the Ashes. “It feels like there’s different plans every second over, or every over, every couple of balls. One batter might have a totally different plan to another one,” Cummins said. “So there’s lots of field movement. A lot more fast-bowling overs than there ever has been. “This series is maybe that little bit higher-pressure, and it’s not only the fielding side but you see the batters taking that little bit of extra time.”","pubDate":"2023-08-07 21:36:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zak Crawley vows to stay humble after personal feats in Ashes which saw him finish as England's leading run-scorer","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12382459/Zak-Crawley-vows-stay-humble-personal-feats-Ashes-saw-finish-Englands-leading-run-scorer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The opener, whose place in Ben Stokes' side had been called into question, silenced his critics by plundering 480 runs at an average of 53 in the drawn series against Australia.","content":"Zak Crawley vows to stay humble after personal feats in Ashes which saw him finish as England's leading run-scorer Zak Crawley has insisted he feels 'like the same bloke' despite his Ashes success The opener managed 480 runs at an average of 53 in the series against Australia Now his attention has turned to the Hundred, which he sees as equally important By Henry Clark For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:30, 7 August 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Zak Crawley insists his Ashes success will not go to his head despite a stellar series which saw him finish as England’s leading run-scorer.

The Reds flew out of the blocks and raced into a 2-0 lead after 10 minutes. First Mohamed Salah poked in from Dominik Szoboszlai's corner, before the Egyptian fed Diogo Jota after winning the ball high up the pitch. But Jurgen Klopp 's side were caught out on the break not long after. A ball over the top of Liverpool's high line was met by Mathias Honsak, and he kept his cool to slot past Alisson to halve the deficit. Luis Diaz restored Liverpool's two-goal lead just before the hour mark, flicking in Szoboszlai's corner with a fine finish, reasserting Liverpool's ability and options in attack. Liverpool will now prepare to take on Chelsea in their Premier League opener on Sunday. Liverpool finished their pre-season campaign with a win over Bundesliga side Darmstadt Mohamed Salah was on the scoresheet for Liverpool, poking in the opener early on Diogo Jota added a second in the opening 10 minutes as Salah won the ball up the pitch The match was being played at Preston North End's Deepdale Stadium due to work being done on the Anfield pitch, but Liverpool supporters travelled in their thousands to watch the game. Darmstadt, however, also took several fans, who were in full voice ahead of their side's first year back in the Bundesliga since 2017. The game looked as if it could be a cricket score early on when Liverpool raced into a lead, with Darmstadt struggling to get up to the speed of the match. Salah was gifted an opening goal when new signing Szoboszlai's cross made its way into the middle of the six yard box. The forward got ahead of his marker and poked home, before his high pressing won the ball from former Norwich defender Christoph Zimmermann, who didn't appear too pleased to have received the ball from his goalkeeper. Salah dispossessed him and fed fellow forward Jota, who had all the time in the world to pick his spot and curl past Marcel Schuhen. When it looked as if Liverpool would run away with things early on, their high line was caught out once again and Honsak ran onto a long ball over the top and slotted home, much to the dismay of Klopp. Luis Diaz scored Liverpool's third of the game with a fine flick from a Dominik Szoboszlai corner Jurgen Klopp was left frustrated at the goal Liverpool conceded but saw his side win again They managed to slow the game down, however, with Alexis Mac Allister starring in a defensive midfield role as the Reds continue to search for a solution to that position. Their latest bid for Southampton's Romeo Lavia was rejected by Southampton on Monday . The second half started slow, but Luis Diaz showed Liverpool's attacking talent when he flicked in with the side of his foot from his side's latest corner. Starting in front of the goalkeeper, the wide man ran from goal and flicked the ball in into the back of the net to calm nerves around the score line. The game finished 3-1, with the Reds now fully focused on Sunday's Premier League opener at Stamford Bridge as they look to return to the Champions League.

This will be Inzamam’s second tenure as the chief selector, having been given the same role in 2016, which he left after his term finished three years later in 2019. Inzamam led Pakistan in 31 Test matches, winning 11 and losing 11 while nine ended in draw. He also led Pakistan in 87 ODIs with 51 wins and 33 losses while three matches ended with no result. Inzamam will head a selection committee that also includes Mickey Arthur, Grant Bradburn and also a secretary Hasan Cheema, who is dealing with data analysts for the Pakistan team. No other former Pakistani player was named on the committee which was headed by Haroon Rasheed, who was part of the former Management Committee. Rasheed was appointed as the selection committee chief in January of this year, following the removal of Muhammad Wasim from the same role in December 2022. However, Rasheed stepped down from the position last month. A source had said next week would be important because if Arthur and Bradburn are removed from the selection process, they might not be happy as they accepted coaching positions only after getting firm assurances from previous PCB head Najam Sethi that they would have a say in selection matters. Arthur is yet to physically join the team as he has been busy with his coaching assignment with English County side Derbyshire but he is scheduled to take charge of the team in the latter part of the Asia Cup and will be available for the World Cup in India and during the side’s tour to Australia later this year. Inzamam has worked with Arthur during his previous tenure, which saw Pakistan lift the 2017 Champions Trophy triumph before failing to qualify for the semi-finals of 2019 ICC World Cup.","pubDate":"2023-08-07 20:17:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymailnews","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket legend Sachin in SL","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Cricket-legend-Sachin-in-SL/108-264747","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar visited Sri Lanka today as a UNICEF ambassador for global humanitarian efforts.","content":"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar visited Sri Lanka today as a UNICEF ambassador for global humanitarian efforts.

Prasad, who noted India's below-par performances in white-ball cricket in the recent past a week ago, continued from where he left off saying that there is no point brushing aside the lack of results from the Men in Blue in both ODIs and T20Is while adding that the intensity and hunger to win has to be far greater than what he saw on the field. Prasad made his point by referring to the instance in the match when leg-spinner had broken open the game with twin strikes in the 16th over of the innings. After which, skipper Hardik Pandya didn't give an over to Chahal as he hoped that his pacers Arshdeep Singh and Mukesh Kumar would do the job in the 18th and the 19th over, which wasn't to be as the pair of Alzarri Joseph and Akeal Hosein scored 26 runs in the last four overs to win the game for their side. Taking to Twitter (X), Prasad wrote, \"Very very ordinary. No point in brushing it aside. After the 2007 T20 World Cup, started and we haven’t won a T20 World Cup in 7 attempts since, making only 1 finals. The intensity and hunger to win needs to be far more .

Six-hitting and strokeplay were not what got Yuvraj his plaudits, instead, it was his match-winning feats in pressure situations, playing the situation by smartly handling the middle overs, manipulating fields and milking bowlers, delaying the attack for a final flourish or setting the stage for finishers. Exactly two months prior to their opening game in the upcoming 50-over World Cup, the Indian think tank must ask itself, following untimely injuries to KL Rahul , Rishabh Pant , and Shreyas Iyer , whether they have any batsmen who may be able to play even a few of the many roles Yuvraj played for India the last time they triumphed at this stage at home. Perhaps it is an attribute of the growing presence of T20 cricket that batting in the middle overs in ODI cricket, especially on slow wickets, has become more of a struggle in recent times. Players who developed their talents in the T20-age have never emphasised or experienced the importance of playing the ‘boring’ middle overs that set up the finish. Navigating long spells of spin, finding gaps in the field, rotating strike, and building partnerships are all age-old attributes for a generation in which middle-order batting has been negated to the role of pinch-hitting. The art of building and pacing an innings is fading. This, perhaps, explains India’s many experiments that have failed to find a settled batsman at No. 4 or even 5. Over their last nine ODIs, India have tried six different batsmen at No. 4. Among them are the likes of Axar Patel , Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav, all of whom are more suited to batting in different positions in the shortest format. Injuries to KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer have forced the Indian think tank to look out for a batter who may be able to play even a few of the many roles Yuvraj played for India the last time they won a World Cup at home. (File) “If your openers are out early, you need to build a partnership. (Middle order) batsmen are not simply flamboyant strokemakers that occupy the crease and start hitting. He has to absorb pressure, leave a few balls, and create a partnership. It’s a difficult job, somebody has to be experienced over there,” Yuvraj said in a recent appearance on the Cricket Basu Youtube channel. The lack of those abilities has manifested itself in India’s recent experiments. How many average over 50 in middle overs? Advertisement In all ODIs India have played since 2020, between the 16th and 40th over, only three Indian middle-order batsmen have averaged over 50. Two of them, Sanju Samson (impressively averaging 141 striking at 113 in nine innings) and Ravindra Jadeja , have got a majority of those runs playing lower down the order at 6 or 7. Only KL Rahul, perhaps due to his natural position being that of an opener and his experience in Tests, has put up solid numbers batting in the middle overs. Question marks over Rahul’s form have not disappeared in the buildup to this World Cup, but the numbers (and lack of other options) point to how desperately India may need him back from the thigh injury he suffered during the IPL. Averaging 95.67 in the middle overs, and 57.75 overall, in ODIs since 2020, Rahul has proven that long-form temperament and ability to build partnerships continues to have relevance in limited-overs cricket. In 16 innings, he only lost his wicket in the middle overs six times and peppered in a few match-winning innings too. In India’s most recent home ODI series, a 2-1 defeat to Australia, it was Rahul that shone. Under pressure after his ouster from the T20 and Test team, he walked into a slow Mumbai track at 16-3 in the fifth over as India looked like they may struggle to chase down a meagre 188, and hit a match-winning 91-ball 75, stitching partnerships with Hardik Pandya and Jadeja, expertly manipulating fields, rotating strike, turning singles into doubles, and finding the odd boundary. Confusion at 4 Advertisement It can’t be. Surely not again? After spending the entirety of their 2019 World Cup campaign having to face questions regarding the lack of a set batsman at No. 4, India find themselves without a credible option in the same position four years on. Pant and Rahul’s performances in the longest format, and Iyer making the No. 4 spot his own during ODIs in the last few years, meant India had a pack to choose from. But if none are able to recover in time to get some playing time ahead of the World Cup, India now find themselves scrambling to make the best of what is left. Maybe this is a follow-on effect from the incredibly long rope Suryakumar was handed higher up the order, team management hoping he can make his T20 form work in all formats. Since 2020, he is the only batsman outside of Rahul, Iyer, and Pant to have been given double-digit opportunities at No. 4 or No. 5. His return has been dismal, averaging 25 in 16 innings with a sub-100 strike rate. As reported earlier in these pages, just as he had done in the last two ODIs against West Indies, Suryakumar is now expected to play the finisher role lower down the order. Among the others, neither Samson nor Ishan Kishan have set the world alight in the six opportunities they have gotten in those positions since. Even if a case is to be made for the returning, perhaps maturing Pandya to be played higher up the order at No. 5, the two-down spot will effectively be a lottery if none of the three injured batsmen return. Recent concerns regarding India – especially around international assignments – have been the lack of depth in their fast bowling. But with a variety of accomplished spinners on Indian turners, the biggest problem area may end up being the middle order.

If those concerns are not resolved, we will struggle, especially in pressure games. Don’t experiment in pressure games,” Yuvraj said. “The skill work to bat in the middle order is very different from that of an opener. Is there anybody there (in the team management) who is working around the guys that will be playing in the middle order? That’s the question mark – the middle order is not ready, so someone will have to make them ready.” Also Read Watch: Tilak Varma dedicates the celebration after scoring his maiden T20...

The Rangers and Scotland legend is holding court in an east London pub and is in fine form as he reflects on a punditry and co-commentary career that, whether he wants to dispute it or not, has made him one of the most liked - and sought-after - in the game. Being crowned Pundit of the Year at the British Sports Journalism Awards back in March was a sign of how successfully McCoist has established himself at the top of the game , but it is not something he is ever ready to take for granted. ‘My older boys are very much on social media and I am trying to hang on by joining Instagram and kidding myself I'm 19 or 20 again! But they keep me up to speed and they'll let me know when things aren't going my way. Ally McCoist is taking his talents to TNT Sports ahead of the new Premier League season The much-loved pundit and co-commentator has established himself as one of the best in the business He has former quite the relationship with Laura Woods, who will be the lead presenter for the channel's coverage ‘If [fans are] happy and have been complimentary they keep me in touch with what has been said. You're only a couple of mistakes away from falling off that cliff. I am very lucky, very lucky.’ TNT Sports is McCoist’s latest venture, another string to a bow that has already seen him land gigs at Sky Sports, ITV, ViaPlay Sports and on the radio with talkSPORT. It was there that he teamed up with Laura Woods on the talkSPORT breakfast show Monday through Wednesday for three years. In what perhaps initially seemed an unlikely duo on paper from the off, they immediately clicked, so much so that McCoist was holding back tears on the day she announced her departure. Now they will reunite at TNT Sports with Woods poached to be host of the rebranded channel and McCoist could not be any happier. ‘She's magic, she's fantastic,’ the TNT Sports pundit and co-commentator says, lighting up when asked about Woods. 'Genuinely we absolutely hit it off immediately. She's a great girl who is very, very good at what she does. ‘She absolutely knows her stuff, whether it is football - she’s a big Arsenal fan - and boxing she's really knowledgable. She'd let me lead occasionally for the cricket and the irony of that won't be lost on you lot with a Scotsman leading on the cricket! She was getting into the cricket as well and is knowledgeable on her rugby so listen, the reason she is where she is is because she's very good, that's the bottom line. ‘Am I biased? Of course I'm biased but she is very good and this is going to be perfect for her, this is an ideal opportunity for her to kick on and I think she'll grab it.’ McCoist speaks highly of Woods, who he said is 'a great girl who is very, very good at what she does' Woods will take to screens to cover a Premier League game on the channel for the first time this weekend ‘Remarkable’ is another word he uses for Woods. In fact, he uses a series of superlatives to describe a colleague he now sees as a close friend. ‘She’s great, great fun. Great to be around. There’s no airs and graces.’ One of the most striking things about sitting down with McCoist is how deferential he is when it comes to the figures behind his success. There is plenty of praise for stats gurus - the ‘anoraks’ as he calls them - that prep him for commentary with a bible of match stats; there are the ‘great’ people he has worked alongside, whether that be presenters or a lead commentator, and yet his refusal to believe much of the hype around himself only adds to his likeability. McCoist, 60, has never been a stranger when it comes to the media, whether that was as a team captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport from 1996 to 2007, being the voice of EA Sports’ FIFA video game series until 2005 alongside John Motson, or since 2010, becoming the voice for fans in the commentary booth or on the touchline as a pundit. The Rangers and Scotland icon has a crystal clear hierarchy though when it comes to enjoying the game. McCoist is humble, insisting he is 'very, very lucky' that fans enjoy his broadcasting work ‘I still say playing is the best by some distance,’ McCoist says. ‘I loved the coaching and management side as well, however, [commentary] is by far and away the next best thing. ‘Sitting, on the halfway line, arguably the best seats in the house, watching the best players and the best teams in the world. There’s your answer. ‘It’s magic. Fantastic. It’s an opportunity that everybody would love to have. We all love the game but being able to comment on it, talk about it, all the best players, I can't tell you how much I love it.’ McCoist is now landing some of the game’s biggest assignments, one of which was the World Cup final in Qatar. The 60-year-old has admitted playing tops broadcasting, but commentary 'is by far and away the next best thing' Champions League co-commentary is on the agenda for the season ahead... but a trip to Cheltenham is not! ‘That is probably the nearest buzz I've had to playing again... brilliant,’ he adds. For now he shows no desire to slow it down despite his hectic workload - not least with wife Vivien actively encouraging to have him out of the house - but with Champions League co-commentary on the agenda for this forthcoming season it seems like his annual pilgrimage to Cheltenham may be one sporting pastime that will have to fall by the wayside. ‘I’m afraid it looks like I’ll be missing Cheltenham,’ he says with that famed chuckle, taking us back to where we started. ‘I don’t mind missing the odd Champion’s Hurdle…’ TNT Sports is the ultimate home for sports fans.

Last month, the ICC amended its Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel after Australian opener Usman Khawaja contacted ICC general manager Wasim Khan about revising the sanctions for slow over-rates. Under the new regulations, teams are fined five per cent of their match fee and one WTC point for every over they fail to bowl in the allotted time, capping fines to 50 per cent. Australia was fined ten WTC points and 50 per cent of their match fee for slow over-rates during England’s first innings in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, England lost 19 WTC points for over-rate transgressions at Edgbaston, Lord’s and The Oval, collectively penalised about $198,000 in match fees across the five-Test campaign. Teams received 12 WTC points for a victory and four points for a draw during the Ashes series. “Don’t even get the chance to bowl in the second innings at Manchester due to two days of rain and the ICC still issue fines and take 10 WTC points of us for slow over rates,” Khawaja tweeted last week . “That makes a lot of sense …” Speaking to the Daily Mail this week, Broad argued the ICC’s over-rate penalties needed further revision. “It diminishes the relevance of the World Test Championship, to be honest,” he told the publication. “It’s been one of the most entertaining series of all time and for England to come out with nine points from a possible 60, the system’s wrong and needs looking at.” Broad retired from international cricket after the fifth Ashes Test, finishing his 16-year career with 4309 runs and 847 wickets.

The Australians missed the 2021 WTC final due to poor over-rates during the 2020 Boxing Day Test against India. Speaking to reporters last month, Australian captain Pat Cummins explained why teams were struggling to get through their overs during the Ashes. “It feels like there’s different plans every second over, or every over, every couple of balls. One batter might have a totally different plan to another one,” Cummins said. “So there’s lots of field movement. A lot more fast-bowling overs than there ever has been. “This series is maybe that little bit higher-pressure, and it’s not only the fielding side but you see the batters taking that little bit of extra time.”","pubDate":"2023-08-07 21:36:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zak Crawley vows to stay humble after personal feats in Ashes which saw him finish as England's leading run-scorer","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12382459/Zak-Crawley-vows-stay-humble-personal-feats-Ashes-saw-finish-Englands-leading-run-scorer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The opener, whose place in Ben Stokes' side had been called into question, silenced his critics by plundering 480 runs at an average of 53 in the drawn series against Australia.","content":"Zak Crawley vows to stay humble after personal feats in Ashes which saw him finish as England's leading run-scorer Zak Crawley has insisted he feels 'like the same bloke' despite his Ashes success The opener managed 480 runs at an average of 53 in the series against Australia Now his attention has turned to the Hundred, which he sees as equally important By Henry Clark For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:30, 7 August 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Zak Crawley insists his Ashes success will not go to his head despite a stellar series which saw him finish as England’s leading run-scorer.

The Reds flew out of the blocks and raced into a 2-0 lead after 10 minutes. First Mohamed Salah poked in from Dominik Szoboszlai's corner, before the Egyptian fed Diogo Jota after winning the ball high up the pitch. But Jurgen Klopp 's side were caught out on the break not long after. A ball over the top of Liverpool's high line was met by Mathias Honsak, and he kept his cool to slot past Alisson to halve the deficit. Luis Diaz restored Liverpool's two-goal lead just before the hour mark, flicking in Szoboszlai's corner with a fine finish, reasserting Liverpool's ability and options in attack. Liverpool will now prepare to take on Chelsea in their Premier League opener on Sunday. Liverpool finished their pre-season campaign with a win over Bundesliga side Darmstadt Mohamed Salah was on the scoresheet for Liverpool, poking in the opener early on Diogo Jota added a second in the opening 10 minutes as Salah won the ball up the pitch The match was being played at Preston North End's Deepdale Stadium due to work being done on the Anfield pitch, but Liverpool supporters travelled in their thousands to watch the game. Darmstadt, however, also took several fans, who were in full voice ahead of their side's first year back in the Bundesliga since 2017. The game looked as if it could be a cricket score early on when Liverpool raced into a lead, with Darmstadt struggling to get up to the speed of the match. Salah was gifted an opening goal when new signing Szoboszlai's cross made its way into the middle of the six yard box. The forward got ahead of his marker and poked home, before his high pressing won the ball from former Norwich defender Christoph Zimmermann, who didn't appear too pleased to have received the ball from his goalkeeper. Salah dispossessed him and fed fellow forward Jota, who had all the time in the world to pick his spot and curl past Marcel Schuhen. When it looked as if Liverpool would run away with things early on, their high line was caught out once again and Honsak ran onto a long ball over the top and slotted home, much to the dismay of Klopp. Luis Diaz scored Liverpool's third of the game with a fine flick from a Dominik Szoboszlai corner Jurgen Klopp was left frustrated at the goal Liverpool conceded but saw his side win again They managed to slow the game down, however, with Alexis Mac Allister starring in a defensive midfield role as the Reds continue to search for a solution to that position. Their latest bid for Southampton's Romeo Lavia was rejected by Southampton on Monday . The second half started slow, but Luis Diaz showed Liverpool's attacking talent when he flicked in with the side of his foot from his side's latest corner. Starting in front of the goalkeeper, the wide man ran from goal and flicked the ball in into the back of the net to calm nerves around the score line. The game finished 3-1, with the Reds now fully focused on Sunday's Premier League opener at Stamford Bridge as they look to return to the Champions League.

This will be Inzamam’s second tenure as the chief selector, having been given the same role in 2016, which he left after his term finished three years later in 2019. Inzamam led Pakistan in 31 Test matches, winning 11 and losing 11 while nine ended in draw. He also led Pakistan in 87 ODIs with 51 wins and 33 losses while three matches ended with no result. Inzamam will head a selection committee that also includes Mickey Arthur, Grant Bradburn and also a secretary Hasan Cheema, who is dealing with data analysts for the Pakistan team. No other former Pakistani player was named on the committee which was headed by Haroon Rasheed, who was part of the former Management Committee. Rasheed was appointed as the selection committee chief in January of this year, following the removal of Muhammad Wasim from the same role in December 2022. However, Rasheed stepped down from the position last month. A source had said next week would be important because if Arthur and Bradburn are removed from the selection process, they might not be happy as they accepted coaching positions only after getting firm assurances from previous PCB head Najam Sethi that they would have a say in selection matters. Arthur is yet to physically join the team as he has been busy with his coaching assignment with English County side Derbyshire but he is scheduled to take charge of the team in the latter part of the Asia Cup and will be available for the World Cup in India and during the side’s tour to Australia later this year. Inzamam has worked with Arthur during his previous tenure, which saw Pakistan lift the 2017 Champions Trophy triumph before failing to qualify for the semi-finals of 2019 ICC World Cup.","pubDate":"2023-08-07 20:17:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymailnews","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket legend Sachin in SL","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Cricket-legend-Sachin-in-SL/108-264747","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar visited Sri Lanka today as a UNICEF ambassador for global humanitarian efforts.","content":"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar visited Sri Lanka today as a UNICEF ambassador for global humanitarian efforts.

Prasad, who noted India's below-par performances in white-ball cricket in the recent past a week ago, continued from where he left off saying that there is no point brushing aside the lack of results from the Men in Blue in both ODIs and T20Is while adding that the intensity and hunger to win has to be far greater than what he saw on the field. Prasad made his point by referring to the instance in the match when leg-spinner had broken open the game with twin strikes in the 16th over of the innings. After which, skipper Hardik Pandya didn't give an over to Chahal as he hoped that his pacers Arshdeep Singh and Mukesh Kumar would do the job in the 18th and the 19th over, which wasn't to be as the pair of Alzarri Joseph and Akeal Hosein scored 26 runs in the last four overs to win the game for their side. Taking to Twitter (X), Prasad wrote, \"Very very ordinary. No point in brushing it aside. After the 2007 T20 World Cup, started and we haven’t won a T20 World Cup in 7 attempts since, making only 1 finals. The intensity and hunger to win needs to be far more .

Six-hitting and strokeplay were not what got Yuvraj his plaudits, instead, it was his match-winning feats in pressure situations, playing the situation by smartly handling the middle overs, manipulating fields and milking bowlers, delaying the attack for a final flourish or setting the stage for finishers. Exactly two months prior to their opening game in the upcoming 50-over World Cup, the Indian think tank must ask itself, following untimely injuries to KL Rahul , Rishabh Pant , and Shreyas Iyer , whether they have any batsmen who may be able to play even a few of the many roles Yuvraj played for India the last time they triumphed at this stage at home. Perhaps it is an attribute of the growing presence of T20 cricket that batting in the middle overs in ODI cricket, especially on slow wickets, has become more of a struggle in recent times. Players who developed their talents in the T20-age have never emphasised or experienced the importance of playing the ‘boring’ middle overs that set up the finish. Navigating long spells of spin, finding gaps in the field, rotating strike, and building partnerships are all age-old attributes for a generation in which middle-order batting has been negated to the role of pinch-hitting. The art of building and pacing an innings is fading. This, perhaps, explains India’s many experiments that have failed to find a settled batsman at No. 4 or even 5. Over their last nine ODIs, India have tried six different batsmen at No. 4. Among them are the likes of Axar Patel , Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav, all of whom are more suited to batting in different positions in the shortest format. Injuries to KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer have forced the Indian think tank to look out for a batter who may be able to play even a few of the many roles Yuvraj played for India the last time they won a World Cup at home. (File) “If your openers are out early, you need to build a partnership. (Middle order) batsmen are not simply flamboyant strokemakers that occupy the crease and start hitting. He has to absorb pressure, leave a few balls, and create a partnership. It’s a difficult job, somebody has to be experienced over there,” Yuvraj said in a recent appearance on the Cricket Basu Youtube channel. The lack of those abilities has manifested itself in India’s recent experiments. How many average over 50 in middle overs? Advertisement In all ODIs India have played since 2020, between the 16th and 40th over, only three Indian middle-order batsmen have averaged over 50. Two of them, Sanju Samson (impressively averaging 141 striking at 113 in nine innings) and Ravindra Jadeja , have got a majority of those runs playing lower down the order at 6 or 7. Only KL Rahul, perhaps due to his natural position being that of an opener and his experience in Tests, has put up solid numbers batting in the middle overs. Question marks over Rahul’s form have not disappeared in the buildup to this World Cup, but the numbers (and lack of other options) point to how desperately India may need him back from the thigh injury he suffered during the IPL. Averaging 95.67 in the middle overs, and 57.75 overall, in ODIs since 2020, Rahul has proven that long-form temperament and ability to build partnerships continues to have relevance in limited-overs cricket. In 16 innings, he only lost his wicket in the middle overs six times and peppered in a few match-winning innings too. In India’s most recent home ODI series, a 2-1 defeat to Australia, it was Rahul that shone. Under pressure after his ouster from the T20 and Test team, he walked into a slow Mumbai track at 16-3 in the fifth over as India looked like they may struggle to chase down a meagre 188, and hit a match-winning 91-ball 75, stitching partnerships with Hardik Pandya and Jadeja, expertly manipulating fields, rotating strike, turning singles into doubles, and finding the odd boundary. Confusion at 4 Advertisement It can’t be. Surely not again? After spending the entirety of their 2019 World Cup campaign having to face questions regarding the lack of a set batsman at No. 4, India find themselves without a credible option in the same position four years on. Pant and Rahul’s performances in the longest format, and Iyer making the No. 4 spot his own during ODIs in the last few years, meant India had a pack to choose from. But if none are able to recover in time to get some playing time ahead of the World Cup, India now find themselves scrambling to make the best of what is left. Maybe this is a follow-on effect from the incredibly long rope Suryakumar was handed higher up the order, team management hoping he can make his T20 form work in all formats. Since 2020, he is the only batsman outside of Rahul, Iyer, and Pant to have been given double-digit opportunities at No. 4 or No. 5. His return has been dismal, averaging 25 in 16 innings with a sub-100 strike rate. As reported earlier in these pages, just as he had done in the last two ODIs against West Indies, Suryakumar is now expected to play the finisher role lower down the order. Among the others, neither Samson nor Ishan Kishan have set the world alight in the six opportunities they have gotten in those positions since. Even if a case is to be made for the returning, perhaps maturing Pandya to be played higher up the order at No. 5, the two-down spot will effectively be a lottery if none of the three injured batsmen return. Recent concerns regarding India – especially around international assignments – have been the lack of depth in their fast bowling. But with a variety of accomplished spinners on Indian turners, the biggest problem area may end up being the middle order.

If those concerns are not resolved, we will struggle, especially in pressure games. Don’t experiment in pressure games,” Yuvraj said. “The skill work to bat in the middle order is very different from that of an opener. Is there anybody there (in the team management) who is working around the guys that will be playing in the middle order? That’s the question mark – the middle order is not ready, so someone will have to make them ready.” Also Read Watch: Tilak Varma dedicates the celebration after scoring his maiden T20...

The Rangers and Scotland legend is holding court in an east London pub and is in fine form as he reflects on a punditry and co-commentary career that, whether he wants to dispute it or not, has made him one of the most liked - and sought-after - in the game. Being crowned Pundit of the Year at the British Sports Journalism Awards back in March was a sign of how successfully McCoist has established himself at the top of the game , but it is not something he is ever ready to take for granted. ‘My older boys are very much on social media and I am trying to hang on by joining Instagram and kidding myself I'm 19 or 20 again! But they keep me up to speed and they'll let me know when things aren't going my way. Ally McCoist is taking his talents to TNT Sports ahead of the new Premier League season The much-loved pundit and co-commentator has established himself as one of the best in the business He has former quite the relationship with Laura Woods, who will be the lead presenter for the channel's coverage ‘If [fans are] happy and have been complimentary they keep me in touch with what has been said. You're only a couple of mistakes away from falling off that cliff. I am very lucky, very lucky.’ TNT Sports is McCoist’s latest venture, another string to a bow that has already seen him land gigs at Sky Sports, ITV, ViaPlay Sports and on the radio with talkSPORT. It was there that he teamed up with Laura Woods on the talkSPORT breakfast show Monday through Wednesday for three years. In what perhaps initially seemed an unlikely duo on paper from the off, they immediately clicked, so much so that McCoist was holding back tears on the day she announced her departure. Now they will reunite at TNT Sports with Woods poached to be host of the rebranded channel and McCoist could not be any happier. ‘She's magic, she's fantastic,’ the TNT Sports pundit and co-commentator says, lighting up when asked about Woods. 'Genuinely we absolutely hit it off immediately. She's a great girl who is very, very good at what she does. ‘She absolutely knows her stuff, whether it is football - she’s a big Arsenal fan - and boxing she's really knowledgable. She'd let me lead occasionally for the cricket and the irony of that won't be lost on you lot with a Scotsman leading on the cricket! She was getting into the cricket as well and is knowledgeable on her rugby so listen, the reason she is where she is is because she's very good, that's the bottom line. ‘Am I biased? Of course I'm biased but she is very good and this is going to be perfect for her, this is an ideal opportunity for her to kick on and I think she'll grab it.’ McCoist speaks highly of Woods, who he said is 'a great girl who is very, very good at what she does' Woods will take to screens to cover a Premier League game on the channel for the first time this weekend ‘Remarkable’ is another word he uses for Woods. In fact, he uses a series of superlatives to describe a colleague he now sees as a close friend. ‘She’s great, great fun. Great to be around. There’s no airs and graces.’ One of the most striking things about sitting down with McCoist is how deferential he is when it comes to the figures behind his success. There is plenty of praise for stats gurus - the ‘anoraks’ as he calls them - that prep him for commentary with a bible of match stats; there are the ‘great’ people he has worked alongside, whether that be presenters or a lead commentator, and yet his refusal to believe much of the hype around himself only adds to his likeability. McCoist, 60, has never been a stranger when it comes to the media, whether that was as a team captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport from 1996 to 2007, being the voice of EA Sports’ FIFA video game series until 2005 alongside John Motson, or since 2010, becoming the voice for fans in the commentary booth or on the touchline as a pundit. The Rangers and Scotland icon has a crystal clear hierarchy though when it comes to enjoying the game. McCoist is humble, insisting he is 'very, very lucky' that fans enjoy his broadcasting work ‘I still say playing is the best by some distance,’ McCoist says. ‘I loved the coaching and management side as well, however, [commentary] is by far and away the next best thing. ‘Sitting, on the halfway line, arguably the best seats in the house, watching the best players and the best teams in the world. There’s your answer. ‘It’s magic. Fantastic. It’s an opportunity that everybody would love to have. We all love the game but being able to comment on it, talk about it, all the best players, I can't tell you how much I love it.’ McCoist is now landing some of the game’s biggest assignments, one of which was the World Cup final in Qatar. The 60-year-old has admitted playing tops broadcasting, but commentary 'is by far and away the next best thing' Champions League co-commentary is on the agenda for the season ahead... but a trip to Cheltenham is not! ‘That is probably the nearest buzz I've had to playing again... brilliant,’ he adds. For now he shows no desire to slow it down despite his hectic workload - not least with wife Vivien actively encouraging to have him out of the house - but with Champions League co-commentary on the agenda for this forthcoming season it seems like his annual pilgrimage to Cheltenham may be one sporting pastime that will have to fall by the wayside. ‘I’m afraid it looks like I’ll be missing Cheltenham,’ he says with that famed chuckle, taking us back to where we started. ‘I don’t mind missing the odd Champion’s Hurdle…’ TNT Sports is the ultimate home for sports fans.

Last month, the ICC amended its Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel after Australian opener Usman Khawaja contacted ICC general manager Wasim Khan about revising the sanctions for slow over-rates. Under the new regulations, teams are fined five per cent of their match fee and one WTC point for every over they fail to bowl in the allotted time, capping fines to 50 per cent. Australia was fined ten WTC points and 50 per cent of their match fee for slow over-rates during England’s first innings in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, England lost 19 WTC points for over-rate transgressions at Edgbaston, Lord’s and The Oval, collectively penalised about $198,000 in match fees across the five-Test campaign. Teams received 12 WTC points for a victory and four points for a draw during the Ashes series. “Don’t even get the chance to bowl in the second innings at Manchester due to two days of rain and the ICC still issue fines and take 10 WTC points of us for slow over rates,” Khawaja tweeted last week . “That makes a lot of sense …” Speaking to the Daily Mail this week, Broad argued the ICC’s over-rate penalties needed further revision. “It diminishes the relevance of the World Test Championship, to be honest,” he told the publication. “It’s been one of the most entertaining series of all time and for England to come out with nine points from a possible 60, the system’s wrong and needs looking at.” Broad retired from international cricket after the fifth Ashes Test, finishing his 16-year career with 4309 runs and 847 wickets.

The Australians missed the 2021 WTC final due to poor over-rates during the 2020 Boxing Day Test against India. Speaking to reporters last month, Australian captain Pat Cummins explained why teams were struggling to get through their overs during the Ashes. “It feels like there’s different plans every second over, or every over, every couple of balls. One batter might have a totally different plan to another one,” Cummins said. “So there’s lots of field movement. A lot more fast-bowling overs than there ever has been. “This series is maybe that little bit higher-pressure, and it’s not only the fielding side but you see the batters taking that little bit of extra time.”","pubDate":"2023-08-07 21:36:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zak Crawley vows to stay humble after personal feats in Ashes which saw him finish as England's leading run-scorer","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12382459/Zak-Crawley-vows-stay-humble-personal-feats-Ashes-saw-finish-Englands-leading-run-scorer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The opener, whose place in Ben Stokes' side had been called into question, silenced his critics by plundering 480 runs at an average of 53 in the drawn series against Australia.","content":"Zak Crawley vows to stay humble after personal feats in Ashes which saw him finish as England's leading run-scorer Zak Crawley has insisted he feels 'like the same bloke' despite his Ashes success The opener managed 480 runs at an average of 53 in the series against Australia Now his attention has turned to the Hundred, which he sees as equally important By Henry Clark For The Daily Mail Updated: 22:30, 7 August 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Zak Crawley insists his Ashes success will not go to his head despite a stellar series which saw him finish as England’s leading run-scorer.

The Reds flew out of the blocks and raced into a 2-0 lead after 10 minutes. First Mohamed Salah poked in from Dominik Szoboszlai's corner, before the Egyptian fed Diogo Jota after winning the ball high up the pitch. But Jurgen Klopp 's side were caught out on the break not long after. A ball over the top of Liverpool's high line was met by Mathias Honsak, and he kept his cool to slot past Alisson to halve the deficit. Luis Diaz restored Liverpool's two-goal lead just before the hour mark, flicking in Szoboszlai's corner with a fine finish, reasserting Liverpool's ability and options in attack. Liverpool will now prepare to take on Chelsea in their Premier League opener on Sunday. Liverpool finished their pre-season campaign with a win over Bundesliga side Darmstadt Mohamed Salah was on the scoresheet for Liverpool, poking in the opener early on Diogo Jota added a second in the opening 10 minutes as Salah won the ball up the pitch The match was being played at Preston North End's Deepdale Stadium due to work being done on the Anfield pitch, but Liverpool supporters travelled in their thousands to watch the game. Darmstadt, however, also took several fans, who were in full voice ahead of their side's first year back in the Bundesliga since 2017. The game looked as if it could be a cricket score early on when Liverpool raced into a lead, with Darmstadt struggling to get up to the speed of the match. Salah was gifted an opening goal when new signing Szoboszlai's cross made its way into the middle of the six yard box. The forward got ahead of his marker and poked home, before his high pressing won the ball from former Norwich defender Christoph Zimmermann, who didn't appear too pleased to have received the ball from his goalkeeper. Salah dispossessed him and fed fellow forward Jota, who had all the time in the world to pick his spot and curl past Marcel Schuhen. When it looked as if Liverpool would run away with things early on, their high line was caught out once again and Honsak ran onto a long ball over the top and slotted home, much to the dismay of Klopp. Luis Diaz scored Liverpool's third of the game with a fine flick from a Dominik Szoboszlai corner Jurgen Klopp was left frustrated at the goal Liverpool conceded but saw his side win again They managed to slow the game down, however, with Alexis Mac Allister starring in a defensive midfield role as the Reds continue to search for a solution to that position. Their latest bid for Southampton's Romeo Lavia was rejected by Southampton on Monday . The second half started slow, but Luis Diaz showed Liverpool's attacking talent when he flicked in with the side of his foot from his side's latest corner. Starting in front of the goalkeeper, the wide man ran from goal and flicked the ball in into the back of the net to calm nerves around the score line. The game finished 3-1, with the Reds now fully focused on Sunday's Premier League opener at Stamford Bridge as they look to return to the Champions League.

This will be Inzamam’s second tenure as the chief selector, having been given the same role in 2016, which he left after his term finished three years later in 2019. Inzamam led Pakistan in 31 Test matches, winning 11 and losing 11 while nine ended in draw. He also led Pakistan in 87 ODIs with 51 wins and 33 losses while three matches ended with no result. Inzamam will head a selection committee that also includes Mickey Arthur, Grant Bradburn and also a secretary Hasan Cheema, who is dealing with data analysts for the Pakistan team. No other former Pakistani player was named on the committee which was headed by Haroon Rasheed, who was part of the former Management Committee. Rasheed was appointed as the selection committee chief in January of this year, following the removal of Muhammad Wasim from the same role in December 2022. However, Rasheed stepped down from the position last month. A source had said next week would be important because if Arthur and Bradburn are removed from the selection process, they might not be happy as they accepted coaching positions only after getting firm assurances from previous PCB head Najam Sethi that they would have a say in selection matters. Arthur is yet to physically join the team as he has been busy with his coaching assignment with English County side Derbyshire but he is scheduled to take charge of the team in the latter part of the Asia Cup and will be available for the World Cup in India and during the side’s tour to Australia later this year. Inzamam has worked with Arthur during his previous tenure, which saw Pakistan lift the 2017 Champions Trophy triumph before failing to qualify for the semi-finals of 2019 ICC World Cup.","pubDate":"2023-08-07 20:17:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"dailymailnews","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket legend Sachin in SL","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Cricket-legend-Sachin-in-SL/108-264747","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar visited Sri Lanka today as a UNICEF ambassador for global humanitarian efforts.","content":"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar visited Sri Lanka today as a UNICEF ambassador for global humanitarian efforts.

Prasad, who noted India's below-par performances in white-ball cricket in the recent past a week ago, continued from where he left off saying that there is no point brushing aside the lack of results from the Men in Blue in both ODIs and T20Is while adding that the intensity and hunger to win has to be far greater than what he saw on the field. Prasad made his point by referring to the instance in the match when leg-spinner had broken open the game with twin strikes in the 16th over of the innings. After which, skipper Hardik Pandya didn't give an over to Chahal as he hoped that his pacers Arshdeep Singh and Mukesh Kumar would do the job in the 18th and the 19th over, which wasn't to be as the pair of Alzarri Joseph and Akeal Hosein scored 26 runs in the last four overs to win the game for their side. Taking to Twitter (X), Prasad wrote, \"Very very ordinary. No point in brushing it aside. After the 2007 T20 World Cup, started and we haven’t won a T20 World Cup in 7 attempts since, making only 1 finals. The intensity and hunger to win needs to be far more .

Six-hitting and strokeplay were not what got Yuvraj his plaudits, instead, it was his match-winning feats in pressure situations, playing the situation by smartly handling the middle overs, manipulating fields and milking bowlers, delaying the attack for a final flourish or setting the stage for finishers. Exactly two months prior to their opening game in the upcoming 50-over World Cup, the Indian think tank must ask itself, following untimely injuries to KL Rahul , Rishabh Pant , and Shreyas Iyer , whether they have any batsmen who may be able to play even a few of the many roles Yuvraj played for India the last time they triumphed at this stage at home. Perhaps it is an attribute of the growing presence of T20 cricket that batting in the middle overs in ODI cricket, especially on slow wickets, has become more of a struggle in recent times. Players who developed their talents in the T20-age have never emphasised or experienced the importance of playing the ‘boring’ middle overs that set up the finish. Navigating long spells of spin, finding gaps in the field, rotating strike, and building partnerships are all age-old attributes for a generation in which middle-order batting has been negated to the role of pinch-hitting. The art of building and pacing an innings is fading. This, perhaps, explains India’s many experiments that have failed to find a settled batsman at No. 4 or even 5. Over their last nine ODIs, India have tried six different batsmen at No. 4. Among them are the likes of Axar Patel , Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav, all of whom are more suited to batting in different positions in the shortest format. Injuries to KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer have forced the Indian think tank to look out for a batter who may be able to play even a few of the many roles Yuvraj played for India the last time they won a World Cup at home. (File) “If your openers are out early, you need to build a partnership. (Middle order) batsmen are not simply flamboyant strokemakers that occupy the crease and start hitting. He has to absorb pressure, leave a few balls, and create a partnership. It’s a difficult job, somebody has to be experienced over there,” Yuvraj said in a recent appearance on the Cricket Basu Youtube channel. The lack of those abilities has manifested itself in India’s recent experiments. How many average over 50 in middle overs? Advertisement In all ODIs India have played since 2020, between the 16th and 40th over, only three Indian middle-order batsmen have averaged over 50. Two of them, Sanju Samson (impressively averaging 141 striking at 113 in nine innings) and Ravindra Jadeja , have got a majority of those runs playing lower down the order at 6 or 7. Only KL Rahul, perhaps due to his natural position being that of an opener and his experience in Tests, has put up solid numbers batting in the middle overs. Question marks over Rahul’s form have not disappeared in the buildup to this World Cup, but the numbers (and lack of other options) point to how desperately India may need him back from the thigh injury he suffered during the IPL. Averaging 95.67 in the middle overs, and 57.75 overall, in ODIs since 2020, Rahul has proven that long-form temperament and ability to build partnerships continues to have relevance in limited-overs cricket. In 16 innings, he only lost his wicket in the middle overs six times and peppered in a few match-winning innings too. In India’s most recent home ODI series, a 2-1 defeat to Australia, it was Rahul that shone. Under pressure after his ouster from the T20 and Test team, he walked into a slow Mumbai track at 16-3 in the fifth over as India looked like they may struggle to chase down a meagre 188, and hit a match-winning 91-ball 75, stitching partnerships with Hardik Pandya and Jadeja, expertly manipulating fields, rotating strike, turning singles into doubles, and finding the odd boundary. Confusion at 4 Advertisement It can’t be. Surely not again? After spending the entirety of their 2019 World Cup campaign having to face questions regarding the lack of a set batsman at No. 4, India find themselves without a credible option in the same position four years on. Pant and Rahul’s performances in the longest format, and Iyer making the No. 4 spot his own during ODIs in the last few years, meant India had a pack to choose from. But if none are able to recover in time to get some playing time ahead of the World Cup, India now find themselves scrambling to make the best of what is left. Maybe this is a follow-on effect from the incredibly long rope Suryakumar was handed higher up the order, team management hoping he can make his T20 form work in all formats. Since 2020, he is the only batsman outside of Rahul, Iyer, and Pant to have been given double-digit opportunities at No. 4 or No. 5. His return has been dismal, averaging 25 in 16 innings with a sub-100 strike rate. As reported earlier in these pages, just as he had done in the last two ODIs against West Indies, Suryakumar is now expected to play the finisher role lower down the order. Among the others, neither Samson nor Ishan Kishan have set the world alight in the six opportunities they have gotten in those positions since. Even if a case is to be made for the returning, perhaps maturing Pandya to be played higher up the order at No. 5, the two-down spot will effectively be a lottery if none of the three injured batsmen return. Recent concerns regarding India – especially around international assignments – have been the lack of depth in their fast bowling. But with a variety of accomplished spinners on Indian turners, the biggest problem area may end up being the middle order.

If those concerns are not resolved, we will struggle, especially in pressure games. Don’t experiment in pressure games,” Yuvraj said. “The skill work to bat in the middle order is very different from that of an opener. Is there anybody there (in the team management) who is working around the guys that will be playing in the middle order? That’s the question mark – the middle order is not ready, so someone will have to make them ready.” Also Read Watch: Tilak Varma dedicates the celebration after scoring his maiden T20...
