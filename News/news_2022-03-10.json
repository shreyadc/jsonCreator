The WA Cricket Foundation initiative brought together five different teams to take part in the round-robin competition at Kent Street Senior High School over the weekend. Teams representing the WA Intellectual Disability, Hard of Hearing and Blind XI took the field alongside outfits from the Perth Scorchers Culture Cup competition and South Perth Junior Cricket Club. Players from the South Perth under-15s and the culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds got to experience the game through the lens of the teams from the Inclusion Academy, such as wearing vision-impairing goggles to understand how those with a vision impairment played cricket. WA Cricket community cricket general manager Jo Davis said the cancellation of the National Cricket Inclusion Championships, which was set to go ahead this month, had left a vacuum which the new tournament had hoped to fill. “It was really about bringing the players together and allowing them to play the game, engage with each other and have fun together,” she said. “We pulled this together as an important step to still give these players something to look forward to and I think we’ll really aim to make this a regular part of our calendar because we had some fantastic feedback.” Davis said they aimed to not just provide a positive participation experience, but also develop pathways for athletes living with a disability to play the game at the highest level. “We’ve got a really strong commitment to our inclusion and diversity programs and we’re well supported by our WA Cricket Foundation, so that’s allowed us to start to build a full pathway for people with disabilities,” she said. “Right from our StarBlast program for kids to our Integrated Cricket League and then this academy and WA teams allows those players showing real potential to have that next step when otherwise they wouldn’t. “They all take it very seriously and look forward to travelling to those national camps, so this didn’t quite replicate the championships, but it played a really important role in filling the void of them.”","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5978770/0654214efb4aaefa155bab22b1a82dc2f1e802ec-16x9-x0y120w2304h1296.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shane Warne body arrives at Bangkok airport for flight back to Australia","link":"https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/2277015/shane-warne-body-arrives-at-bangkok-airport-for-flight-back-to-australia","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The body of cricketer Shane Warne arrived at Don Mueang airport on Thursday to be flown back to Australia where the cricket superstar is to receive a state funeral.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:54:00","full_description":"The body of cricketer Shane Warne arrived at Don Mueang airport on Thursday to be flown back to Australia where the cricket superstar is to receive a state funeral.

Dr Peter Brukner, the former team doctor of the Australian men’s cricket team, said Warne likely had heart disease towards the end of his life. Warne’s family have revealed he had been suffering with heart troubles and asthma in the weeks leading up to his death, and had also completed a 14-day liquid only diet. Brukner now says Warne’s issues were predictable. “Warnie, if he had heart disease, which sounds like he did, you know, that didn’t happen overnight in Thailand,” he said in an interview with Triple M Perth. “It’s been happening for 20, 30 years from smoking, poor diet, etc, etc.” It comes just days after Warne’s close friend and former teammate Ian Healy also spoke of his fears of Warne dying young . The Aussie wicketkeeping great, a former teammate of the magical leg-spinner, means no disrespect and has been left devastated by Warne’s sudden death of a suspected heart attack on Saturday morning. Shane Warne had more to celebrate than any other cricketer. Picture: Mike Keating. HS25. Source: News Corp Australia However, Healy said he was not shocked when he first learned of the tragic news. Healy travelled the world with the 52-year-old national icon — and witnessed first hand the hurricane he could be both on and off the field. Warne’s battles with the scales have been a constant interest of fans even following his career. He recently lost 14kg as part of a fasting diet, but announced this week he wanted to lose weight. He posted four days ago that he had started “operation shred” to lose the weight he had put on since his previous health kick. It is this yoyo dieting and his at one time commonly-known susceptibility to vices, including drinking and smoking, that left Healy fearing the “Spin King” would die young. Healy said he was worried Warne would have been battling cancer at a young age. “An early passing didn’t surprise me for Warnie,” Healy told The Today Show. “He didn’t look after his body that well. He yo-yoed up and down. King of Moomba Shane Warne. Tim Carrafa. Source: News Corp Australia “He didn’t put much sunscreen on. I thought it would have become skin issues for him over time, but not at 52. And he would have been full of beans right to the end, I bet.” Brukner said Warne’s death should be a wake up call for men to monitor their health and to undergo an annual check-up through a GP. “The issue with these things is you don’t develop heart disease in a minute. It’s a very gradual process,” he said. Despite his knowledge of Warne’s health complications, Brukner said he is still shocked. “Just unbelievable,” he said. “None of us can really believe it, can we? He was a larger than life character.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Feature of Warne’s coffin is absolute class","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/fitting-detail-in-first-photo-of-shane-warnes-coffin/news-story/80cee42734670679dc65d2d3618d691f","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The first pictures of Shane Warne’s coffin have emerged as the cricket legend’s body is flown to Australia on Thursday evening.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:08:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ramiz promises viewers exciting cricket","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940123-ramiz-promises-viewers-exciting-cricket","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: The Rawalpindi pitch which had been prepared for the first Test between Pakistan and Australia invited a huge criticism for being too benign and dead with all the five days went dour.

The fans have also shown frustration with the tame draw as on the surface only 14 wickets fell inside five days. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ That immense criticism about the pitch behaviour 'forced' the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja to issue a statement of 'hope' that the series in coming days will be fascinating. \"I totally understand a draw cannot be a good advertisement for Test cricket. In five days results should have come and in these days 90 percent Test matches get results,\" Ramiz said. However, he said there were two to three things which he wanted to put up with. \"The first thing is when I took charge as the PCB chief, my statement made headlines on pitches when I said that pitches need to be massively redone. \"When I came in September, the cricket season was in progress and it took almost five to six months to prepare one pitch. Off-season you will see [the difference] as we are bringing soil from Australia. Here we are also experimenting and have prepared some soil through soil experts and we will redo 50 to 60 pitches throughout Pakistan. We will do this when our season closes in March-April,\" Ramiz said. However, the PCB chief pointed out that being hosts they should play according to their strength. \"Look, it is a three-match Test series so there is a lot of cricket left and we don't want to play in the lap of Australia by making a fast and bouncy pitch. It is necessary when we play at home we should play according to our strength,\" he emphasised. \"Unfortunately we had limited resources in fast bowling as Hasan Ali and Faheem got unfit. There was a brand new opening pair. Abdullah Shafique had played two or three matches and it was thought that he would be able to click against a strong Australian attack. Similarly, Imam-ul-Haq was staging a comeback too. Therefore when your bowling and opening pair is disturbed and raw so you get chances according to that. He added that Australia is a world powerhouse so \"we give them respect and so quickly we could not go in experimental mode considering our strength,\" he explained. He said the performance in Rawalpindi, though, has instilled a lot of confidence in the Pakistan team. \"Still I know that the performance has instilled a lot of confidence in Pakistan. Batting, especially, showed that and in bowling too a spinner took six wickets. These are bright points. But fans should understand that we will try our level best to have a result-oriented series but it is not easy to prepare pitches overnight,\" he said. \"We are to beat Australia and prepare our strategy carefully, adding that the ball should reverse and their spinners could perform and in the same way their batting could get advantage to play on low-bouncy tracks. He asked fans to witness the series with the belief that it will get interesting. \"Look, it's our huge achievement that Australia have come here and I hope this series will be very interesting. Don't jump the gun, there is a lot of cricket to come,\" he signed off.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Premier Cricket: South Perth and Subiaco-Floreat book grand final clash","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/local-news/perthnow-western-suburbs/premier-cricket-south-perth-and-subiaco-floreat-book-grand-final-clash-c-5972695","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Smith"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Premier Cricket grand final will be a meeting of this season’s two most dominant teams after South Perth and Subiaco-Floreat punched their tickets to the big dance.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:00:00","full_description":"The Premier Cricket grand final will be a meeting of this season’s two most dominant teams after South Perth and Subiaco-Floreat punched their tickets to the big dance. The pair, who finished first and second respectively in the regular season, overcame staunch opposition in their semifinals to book their spots in this weekend’s grand final, which will take place at the WACA Ground on Saturday and Sunday. South Perth overcame local rivals Perth by just two runs in incredible circumstances, while Subiaco-Floreat edged out Willetton in a heart-stopping one-wicket win. In a wicket-filled game, both South Perth and Perth amazing ended up batting twice across the two days, after they combined for just 166 runs in their first innings. After electing to bat, South Perth soon found themselves under a heap of pressure as they crumbled to 5-33 as Connor Blaxall-Hill (3-18) and Josh Nicholas (3-26) tore through the top order. Timothy Hale (51) was the lone shining light for the hosts as he helped his side reach 7-104, but his dismissal was the first of three quickfire wickets that brought their innings to a close at 111. Any confidence Perth had was quickly erased as their star top-order fell to 3-5 as South Perth’s bowlers found similar success, eventually taking just 21 overs to bowl them out for a meagre 55 as Cameron Gannon (4-16) and Liam Dallimore (4-24) wreaked havoc. Gifted a second chance, South Perth found the going tough once again in their second innings, but managed 160, thanks in part to some lower-order resistance led by Alex Bevilaqua (26) and Eric Botha (19). Needing 217 for victory, Perth overcame a couple of early wickets to reach 3-81, but the wicket of Jonathan Wells (47) triggered a mini-collapse that saw them fall to 6-110. Blaxall-Hill (54), Liam Guthrie (35) and Josh Nicholas (31 not out) threatened to steal an incredible victory, but they fell agonisingly short of the target by stumps, finishing on 8-214. In the other semi-final, Willetton won the toss and decided to bat, which looked a good move as Cam Bancroft (77) and Aaron Hardie (74) propelled them to 3-221. However, Bancroft’s dismissal was followed by a slew of quick wickets as D’Arcy Short (30) joined him in the pavillion shortly after and it went downhill from there. Christopher Hansberry was on fire with the ball as he took 7-41, including seven in a row, as Willetton crumbled to all out for 245. Subiaco-Floreat started in a similarly positive manner, as Ben Tredget and Jayden Goodwin both made half centuries and Tim Monteleone reached 49 to help them to 2-194. But like Willetton, the Lions found the going tough as play wore on as Waheguru Dhillon (5-117) got on top of the middle order to reduce them to 5-230. It looked like Subiaco-Floreat would breeze to the total before four wickets in the space of eight runs turned the game on its head, but Michael Hart (16 from 14) was on hand to guide them into the grand final with one wicket remaining.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-5972695/47213a692b2b54cae9b4e2892bdc27bdf3f28b6e-16x9-x0y282w2140h1204.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Teams reach Karachi for second Test","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940125-teams-reach-karachi-for-second-test","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Pakistan and Australia cricket teams on Wednesday landed here to face each other in the second Test of the three-match series which will begin at the National Stadium from Saturday.The Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed that both teams had reached Karachi team hotel.According to sources,...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:00:00","full_description":"KARACHI: Pakistan and Australia cricket teams on Wednesday landed here to face each other in the second Test of the three-match series which will begin at the National Stadium from Saturday. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that both teams had reached Karachi team hotel. According to sources, both teams had to wait at the airport for security clearance because of VIP movement as Prime Minister Imran Khan spent a busy day here on Wednesday due to his political engagements. Because of this issue the PCB also postponed the virtual news conference of the batting coach Mohammad Yousuf which was scheduled at 5:30 pm. Tight security arrangements have been made around the hotel where the teams are staying. The wicket has been prepared for the second Test which has now gained a lot of significance after the first Test at the Pindi Cricket Stadium ended in a tame draw on the batting-friendly track which invited immense criticism from experts. Only 14 wickets fell during the five-day engagement which was also hit at some stages by inclement weather. This will be after 24 years that both sides will face each other here at the National Stadium. They last played here from October 15-19 in 1998. That match ended in a draw. Australia scored 280 and 290 while Pakistan made 252 and 262-5. On the tour three matches were played and Australia won the series 1-0, having won the first Test at Rawalpindi by an innings and 99 runs. Peshawar Test also ended in a draw. National Stadium has been lucky for the hosts as eight Tests have been played between the two nations and of them Pakistan won five. Three ended in a draw. After dour proceedings at the Pindi Stadium due to the lifeless track it will be interesting to see how National Stadium wicket behaves. It is expected to help spinners. Both teams will hold their practice sessions on Thursday (today).","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rafiq fears he's 'unemployable' after speaking out","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940129-rafiq-fears-he-s-unemployable-after-speaking-out","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LONDON: Azeem Rafiq fears he may have become “unemployable” within cricket after speaking out about the racism he suffered during his two spells at Yorkshire.Former off-spinner Rafiq, 31 accused Yorkshire of failing to deal adequately with the abuse he suffered at the northern county,...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:00:00","full_description":"LONDON: Azeem Rafiq fears he may have become “unemployable” within cricket after speaking out about the racism he suffered during his two spells at Yorkshire. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Former off-spinner Rafiq, 31 accused Yorkshire of failing to deal adequately with the abuse he suffered at the northern county, saying he had been driven to thoughts of suicide.

They also prompted the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to announce a new initiative to tackle racism within the game. Rafiq, however, said Tuesday he was worried his candour had come at a price. “I feel like people are scared to be connected to me, because I will continue to fight for the truth,” he told the PA news agency at the Include Summit in Birmingham. “I sit here as a 31-year-old, potentially unemployable, potentially (without) any hope of being around the game in the future, a game that I’ve loved for the majority of my life. “Something that I thought, after letting off the burden that I’ve been carrying for a long time, that I’d be able to love again and start going back towards and follow my passion within it.” Rafiq added: “My passion away from playing is coaching...So that was one thing that I always wanted to do and the other thing was within a media, broadcasting. “I just don’t know how I can come back when the game is still not accepting the reality. Of course I’d love to (come back).” But Rafiq, who has said he and his family have received threats to their physical safety, said cricket was still not treating the issue or racism seriously. “It wants to put this across as Azeem Rafiq’s experience,” he said. “It’s not, it’s the experience of thousands of others.” Rafiq was also unconvinced by the ECB’s latest scheme to combat racism. “The whole action plan is really difficult for me to have any faith in it because we’ve seen it before,” he said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Faheem to miss Karachi Test due to Covid","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940120-faheem-to-miss-karachi-test-due-to-covid","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Pakistan all-rounder Faheem Ashraf will miss the second Test against Australia after testing positive for Covid-19, the Pakistan Cricket Board said Wednesday.The 28-year-old all-rounder missed the drawn first Test in Rawalpindi due to a hamstring injury.\"Ashraf has tested positive for...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:00:00","full_description":"KARACHI: Pakistan all-rounder Faheem Ashraf will miss the second Test against Australia after testing positive for Covid-19, the Pakistan Cricket Board said Wednesday. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ The 28-year-old all-rounder missed the drawn first Test in Rawalpindi due to a hamstring injury. \"Ashraf has tested positive for Covid-19 in his on-arrival test at the Karachi team hotel,\" the PCB said in a statement. \"He will now undergo a five-day isolation.\" The second Test starts on Saturday in Karachi.

The fans have also shown frustration with the tame draw as on the surface only 14 wickets fell inside five days. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ That immense criticism about the pitch behaviour 'forced' the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja to issue a statement of 'hope' that the series in coming days will be fascinating. \"I totally understand a draw cannot be a good advertisement for Test cricket. In five days results should have come and in these days 90 percent Test matches get results,\" Ramiz said. However, he said there were two to three things which he wanted to put up with. \"The first thing is when I took charge as the PCB chief, my statement made headlines on pitches when I said that pitches need to be massively redone. \"When I came in September, the cricket season was in progress and it took almost five to six months to prepare one pitch. Off-season you will see [the difference] as we are bringing soil from Australia. Here we are also experimenting and have prepared some soil through soil experts and we will redo 50 to 60 pitches throughout Pakistan. We will do this when our season closes in March-April,\" Ramiz said. However, the PCB chief pointed out that being hosts they should play according to their strength. \"Look, it is a three-match Test series so there is a lot of cricket left and we don't want to play in the lap of Australia by making a fast and bouncy pitch. It is necessary when we play at home we should play according to our strength,\" he emphasised. \"Unfortunately we had limited resources in fast bowling as Hasan Ali and Faheem got unfit. There was a brand new opening pair. Abdullah Shafique had played two or three matches and it was thought that he would be able to click against a strong Australian attack. Similarly, Imam-ul-Haq was staging a comeback too. Therefore when your bowling and opening pair is disturbed and raw so you get chances according to that. He added that Australia is a world powerhouse so \"we give them respect and so quickly we could not go in experimental mode considering our strength,\" he explained. He said the performance in Rawalpindi, though, has instilled a lot of confidence in the Pakistan team. \"Still I know that the performance has instilled a lot of confidence in Pakistan. Batting, especially, showed that and in bowling too a spinner took six wickets. These are bright points. But fans should understand that we will try our level best to have a result-oriented series but it is not easy to prepare pitches overnight,\" he said. \"We are to beat Australia and prepare our strategy carefully, adding that the ball should reverse and their spinners could perform and in the same way their batting could get advantage to play on low-bouncy tracks. He asked fans to witness the series with the belief that it will get interesting. \"Look, it's our huge achievement that Australia have come here and I hope this series will be very interesting. Don't jump the gun, there is a lot of cricket to come,\" he signed off.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BCB rests Shakib from international cricket till April 30","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940132-bcb-rests-shakib-from-international-cricket-till-april-30","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"DHAKA: Bangladesh Cricket Board announced on Wednesday that they will rest all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan from all cricket until April 30 after the star sought to withdraw from the upcoming tour of South Africa.“Shakib told us he was mentally fatigued and physically stressed,” Bangladesh...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:00:00","full_description":"DHAKA: Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced on Wednesday that they will rest all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan from all cricket until April 30 after the star sought to withdraw from the upcoming tour of South Africa. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ “Shakib told us he was mentally fatigued and physically stressed,” Bangladesh Cricket Board operations chief Jalal Yunus told reporters in Dhaka. “He does not want to go to South Africa. Considering his (lack of) interest, we thought he should be given rest.” There was no immediate comment from Shakib but the 34-year-old at the weekend had said he needed a break and would like to skip the tour. After a string of poor performances in the home series against Afghanistan, Shakib on Sunday said he felt like a “passenger” in the team and was not in the right mental state to play. He made the comments before leaving for the United Arab Emirates on a personal trip. “If I get a break, if I get my interest back, I can play with more ease,” he added. Shakib scored just 14 runs in two T20 matches against Afghanistan last week and took two wickets. In the three-match ODI series he scored a total of 60 runs and claimed just five wickets. He had already been named in the squads for both the Test and ODI series in South Africa. But he said: “I don’t think I should be in the South Africa tour with such a mentality. I want to meet everyone’s expectations when I am playing. “There’s no guarantee of my best performance. I don’t want to waste the time or someone’s spot. “Playing in this way, as a passenger, it will be like betraying or cheating my teammates and the country,” he added. Shakib skipped Bangladesh’s previous Test series against New Zealand and reportedly asked for leave to play in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. But he went unsold in the IPL auction, paving the way for his return to the Test side. In 2021, Shakib played only three of Bangladesh’s seven Test matches.The Bangladesh team on Thursday will fly to South Africa, where they will play three ODIs and two Tests in March and April.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jadeja tops Test all-rounder rankings after Mohali heroics","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940130-jadeja-tops-test-all-rounder-rankings-after-mohali-heroics","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: India’s Ravindra Jadeja has returned as the world’s number one-ranked all-rounder after his stand-out effort with bat and ball against Sri Lanka, the International Cricket Council said Wednesday.Jadeja, a left-hand batsman and left-arm spinner, hit an unbeaten 175 and took a...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 01:00:00","full_description":"NEW DELHI: India’s Ravindra Jadeja has returned as the world’s number one-ranked all-rounder after his stand-out effort with bat and ball against Sri Lanka, the International Cricket Council said Wednesday. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Jadeja, a left-hand batsman and left-arm spinner, hit an unbeaten 175 and took a match tally of nine wickets as India hammered Sri Lanka inside three days on Sunday to lead the two-match series 1-0. “It’s not the first time that the Indian spinner has topped the all-rounder rankings, and his move to the summit comes as little surprise after a stunning individual showing during the first test against Sri Lanka in Mohali,” the ICC said. The 33-year-old Jadeja overtook fellow Indian Ravichandran Ashwin and West Indies’ Jason Holder to top the table with 406 rating points. Holder, who is in action against England in Antigua, slipped to second in the rankings, with Ashwin third. Ashwin also had a memorable match as he overtook Indian great Kapil Dev’s tally of 434 wickets to become the second-highest wicket-taker in India behind Anil Kumble (619 scalps). Bangladesh star Shakib Al Hasan remains at fourth position while England’s Ben Stokes moves a place up to fifth above Mitchell Starc of Australia. In the batting chart, Virat Kohli moved into the top five after a 45 in the previous Test — his 100th.

The MCC said it found through research that the ban over this period had little or no impact on the amount of swing that bowlers were getting. Polishing the ball with sweat will still be permitted. “The new laws will not permit the use of saliva on the ball, which also removes any grey areas of fielders eating sugary sweets to alter their saliva to apply to the ball,” the MCC said in a statement. “Using saliva will be treated the same way as any other unfair methods of changing the condition of the ball.” The Lord’s-based MCC, the sole authority on the laws of cricket since it was founded in 1787, said that Players can still use sweat to shine the ball under the rule changes that come into effect in October 1. The “Mankad” out involves a bowler choosing to whip off the bails when a non-striker steps out of the crease instead of completing his delivery to the batter on strike. While legal, the dismissal, named after India bowler Vinoo Mankad who ran out Australia’s Bill Brown in similar fashion in 1947, has been considered against the spirit of the game. The MCC said that although the wording of the law would remain the same, it would move from Law 41 (Unfair play) to Law 38 (Run out). In other changes, the MCC said when a batter is out caught, the new player in will come in at the end the striker was at and face the next ball, even if the batters cross while the ball was in the air, unless it is the end of an over. The new laws make permanent a ban on applying saliva to the ball due to health reasons, implemented when men’s cricket resumed after a Covid-19 suspension in July 2020.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warne state funeral set for March 30 at MCG","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/940124-warne-state-funeral-set-for-march-30-at-mcg","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"SYDNEY: Australian cricket superstar Shane Warne will be honoured with a state funeral at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the evening of March 30, the Victorian state government said Wednesday.Warne died at the age of 52 on the Thai holiday island of Koh Samui on Friday.

A state funeral for the legendary leg-spinner will be held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with tickets open to the public, said a statement by the Victorian government. Warne “didn’t just inspire a cricketing generation - he defined it,” it said. Further details were still being finalised, the state government added. “There’s nowhere in the world more appropriate to farewell Warnie than the ‘G’,” said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. “Victorians will be able to pay tribute to Shane and his contribution (to) our state, and his sport, at a memorial service at the MCG on the evening of March 30th,” he said in a statement.

Warne’s body will arrive in Australia on Thursday night and it was transported to Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok on Thursday morning ahead of his return home, Thai police confirmed The 52-year-old’s coffin was seen draped in an Australian flag as it was moved onto a private flight ahead of his return home. The moving spectacle of seeing Warne’s body decorated in the Aussie flag is a fitting tribute to the cricket legend who took 708 test wickets for his country and played in 145 tests for the baggy green. Warne’s body underwent an autopsy at Bangkok Police Station’s mortuary, where it was confirmed by police that he died of natural causes — a suspected heart attack. Warne’s state funeral will take place on March 30 , after a private family service is expected to be held towards the end of next week. Discussions into the service’s organisation have begun, with immediate plans on hold until Warne’s body is back on Australian soil. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews previously said the public service would be an opportunity for the state to pay tribute to one of its biggest sporting icons. “It will be an opportunity for Victorians to pay tribute to his contribution to his sport, to our state and the country,” he said. The MCG’s Great Southern Stand will be renamed the S.K. Warne Stand in the spin king’s honour. “I’ve just informed the Warne family that the government will rename the Great Southern Stand at the MCG — the place he took his hat-trick and 700th wicket — to honour Shane and his contribution to the game,” Mr Andrews said when he made the announcement. “The S.K. Warne Stand will be a permanent tribute to an amazing Victorian.” Warne was staying in a private villa with three friends, including one who performed CPR after finding him unresponsive when he did not show up for dinner. Police Colonel Yuthana Sirisombat, director of Bo Phut Provincial Police Station in Koh Samui, said Warne had experienced chest pains before his trip to Thailand. Citing interviews with family, he revealed Warne had a history of heart disease and asthma. Warne’s family have revealed he had been suffering with heart troubles and asthma in the weeks leading up to his death, and had also completed a 14-day liquid only diet. PCB chairman Ramiz Raja has insinuated that the lifeless Rawalpindi pitch was intentionally prepared to nullify Australia’s bowlers. Shane Warne’s former doctor has spoken publicly for the first time to reveal the complications to the cricket legend’s health. The grieving son of cricket legend Shane Warne has been consoled by his new girlfriend after the King of Spin’s death that shocked the

He was really good with that and it was what you really admired about him, his sense of history.\" Wessels and Warne were the opposing coaches for the final of the inaugural IPL season in 2008, with Warne's Rajasthan side getting the victory in a match that went down to the final ball of the 20th over. \"We actually chatted a lot during that IPL and it was always fun,\" Wessels recalled. \"We ended up playing them in the final and it was a great game. Even during the game we were interacting and that was fantastic. \"We spent a fair bit of time together there, and also on the commentary circuit.\" The loss of Marsh at the age of 74, a week after he suffered a heart attack, followed by Warne's death later that day, meant Australia lost two legends of the game in little more than 12 hours. \"I've always had so much time for Rod Marsh and Dennis Lillee, not just for the way they treated me in the early stages of World Series Cricket, but also when I made my Test debut for Australia,\" Wessels said. \"They made a real effort to make me feel welcome and ease me into the side and into the setup. I've always had a great appreciation for those two, they were absolutely awesome. \"Rod's passing was a real shock, to lose both Rod and Warne within 24 hours is just horrible.\" For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/03/415315/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Zealand Women vs India Women, 8th Match, ICC Womens World Cup 2022 - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vY3JpY2tldC1jb21tZW50YXJ5LzMyNDUyL2xpdmUtaW5kaWEtZHJvcC12ZXJtYS1vcHQtdG8tYm93bNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand Women vs India Women, 8th Match, ICC Womens World Cup 2022  CricbuzzIndia vs New Zealand Live Score, Women’s World Cup 2022: Vastrakar strikes in first over to remove Devine; NZ W 2 down  Hindustan TimesAmy Satterthwaite speaks ahead of New Zealand v India in Women's World Cup 2022  Cricket WorldICC Women's World Cup, India Women vs New Zealand Women, Live Cricket Score, Live Updates: Skipper Sohpie Devine Departs, India On Top  NDTV SportsNew Zealand (Women) vs. India (Women) Predictions, Betting Tips & Odds │10 MARCH, 2022  Telecom AsiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 00:47:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket great Warne begins final journey home to Australia","link":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/cricket-great-warne-begins-final-003609667.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-10 00:36:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warne’s doctor: Attack was long time coming","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/shane-warnes-doctor-says-attack-was-a-long-time-coming/news-story/83218d68da6bf2a821fd556c6d7a8013","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shane Warne’s former doctor has revealed the cricket legend’s heart problems were coming for a long time.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 23:30:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England bowlers toil against West Indies in Antigua heat but Mark Wood and Ben Stokes drag Joe Root’s men back into Test","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/17901097/england-west-indies-report-stokes-wood-root/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport","England Cricket"],"creator":["Martin Lipton"],"video_url":null,"description":"NO Anderson.

Bairstow and Woakes extended their partnership to 71 before the Warwickshire all-rounder gloved a Jayden Seales lifter to keeper Joshua Da Silva for 28 valuable runs.

Wood went for a single when his attempted pull off Alzarri Joseph ended up in the hands of backward point.

Now it was about how England bowled with the new ball. The answer — terribly. Windies openers Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell milked the initial burst and were rarely troubled even if, post-lunch, England bowled slightly better lines.

And when Woakes successfully urged a review after Jermaine Blackwood was caught off edge and thigh pad at gully, they were right back in it at 127-4. The relief on Woakes’ face was palpable. He had been clattered to the boundary twice more in his comeback over and was going at a run a ball.

Already boasting arguably the best pace attack in the world, Australia could have dominated on a seaming wicket — a chance the PCB was not willing to take. “I understand the frustration of the fans,” Ramiz said in a video posted on PCB’s Twitter account, and translated by ESPNCricinfo . “Undoubtedly, it would have been very good if we had a result but this is a three-Test series and we need to understand that a lot of cricket still remains to be played. “Just for the heck of it, we can’t prepare a fast pitch or a bouncy pitch and put the game in Australia’s lap. “It’s important that when we play at home, we play to our strengths. We also had limited resources, unfortunately. “Our opening-ball pair was disturbed because Hasan Ali and Faheem were both unfit. Similarly, we had a brand-new opening pair — Abdullah Shafique had only played 2-3 matches, and we were keeping a worrisome eye on his form, and whether he could handle such a good bowling attack or not. Imam-ul-Haq was also making a comeback.” Rod Marsh offered state funeral in WA | 00:23 Australia captain Pat Cummins said after play that it was not a “traditional” wicket for Rawalpindi, where seamers have typically performed well. As such, Australia went with a pace-heavy attack, only for Pakistan to roll out just the two seamers in a clear sign that the wicket wasn’t going to play as expected. The second Test in Karachi is expected to be a more lively affair with spin likely to be a much bigger factor on a dry wicket. “We need to beat Australia and we need to prepare our strategy accordingly,” Ramiz said. “The strategy is for low-bouncy tracks where reverse can happen, where LBW and bowled will be in play, where our spinners can show their performance and where the batters, who have grown up on low-bounce pitches, can utilise that advantage.” He added: “I hope that this series, going forward, will become more interesting but only one match is done, so don’t jump the gun, there’s a lot of cricket to be played.” Australia has never won a Test in Karachi.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shane Warne looked relaxed as he walked back to his room hours before he died","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/shane-warne-looked-relaxed-as-he-walked-back-to-his-room-hours-before-he-died-c-5999924","keywords":null,"creator":["Lauren Ferri"],"video_url":null,"description":"The final images of cricket legend Shane Warne’s life have been captured on CCTV footage, which shows his last steps.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 21:53:32","full_description":"The final images of Shane Warne moments before he died of a heart attack show the cricketing legend appearing happy and relaxed as he strolled through his luxurious Thailand villa. The 52-year-old’s final steps walking through the lobby of the Samujana Villa on the island of Koh Samui were captured on CCTV, as he carried new shirts from his favourite local tailor. A short video captured Warne dressed casually in black shorts, a white T-shirt and a cap with several new shirts draped over his arm. He seemed relaxed as he returned to the villa about 1.30pm, where he was staying with his business manager Andrew Neophitou and three friends. It is believed Warne had ventured out and spent almost an hour at the Briony Tailor where he was fitted for new suits. Just hours later at 5.15pm, the sports legend was found face down and unresponsive on his bed following a heart attack. Warne’s family have revealed he had been suffering with heart troubles and asthma in the weeks leading up to his death, and had also completed a 14-day liquid only diet. Thai police confirmed the 52-year-old’s body will be flown home from Thailand on Thursday morning as it was revealed his public memorial will be held on March 30. The 52-year-old’s body was transferred to Bangkok where it underwent an autopsy and is currently being held at Bangkok Police Station’s mortuary. He will now be flown by private jet from Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok at 8am local time, and will arrive in Australia by Thursday evening. Warne’s state funeral will take place on March 30, after a private family service is expected to be held towards the end of next week. Discussions into the service’s organisation have begun, with immediate plans on hold until Warne’s body is back on Australian soil. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews previously said the public service would be an opportunity for the state to pay tribute to one of its biggest sporting icons. “It will be an opportunity for Victorians to pay tribute to his contribution to his sport, to our state and the country,” he said. The MCG’s Great Southern Stand will be renamed the S.K. Warne Stand in the spin king’s honour. “I’ve just informed the Warne family that the government will rename the Great Southern Stand at the MCG — the place he took his hat-trick and 700th wicket — to honour Shane and his contribution to the game,” Mr Andrews said when he made the announcement. “The S.K. Warne Stand will be a permanent tribute to an amazing Victorian.”","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5999924/2a879fcf8d86093b5098e058f812d4913a1b547e-16x9-x226y0w1447h814.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tragic final photo of Shane Warne shows legend walking through villa hours before death - The Mirror","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0L3NoYW5lLXdhcm5lLWF1c3RyYWxpYS10aGFpbGFuZC1kZWF0aC0yNjQyOTg5ONIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tragic final photo of Shane Warne shows legend walking through villa hours before death  The MirrorShane Warne's entourage: The four men at Koh Samui Samujana villas on night cricketer died  Daily MailMelbourne Cricket Ground to host state funeral for Shane Warne  The TimesHaunting final pic of Shane Warne shows cricket legend walking through Thai villa just hours before his...  The SunShane Warne death: Elizabeth Hurley shares sweet message to his daughter Summer  Daily MailView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 21:20:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Two spinners ‘likely’ for second Test in Karachi","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/two-spinners-likely-for-second-test-in-karachi/video/61687191e65774ff4fa8a403b2678aad","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Andrew McDonald has stated it's likely Australia will field two spinners when they face Pakistan in Karachi for the second Test.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 21:09:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rod Marsh offered state funeral in Western Australia","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/rod-marsh-offered-state-funeral-in-western-australia/video/03e9faf7127475b8f58151f9d4481ad8","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Rod Marsh's family have been offered a state memorial service in Western Australia by the state government.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-09 21:09:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
