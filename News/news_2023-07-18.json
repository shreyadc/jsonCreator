Australia lead the series 2-1 ahead of the next instalment at Old Trafford with pressure on Ben Stokes' side to level the series. Mail Sport’s NASSER HUSSAIN outlines the areas they need to get right. Hold on! The first thing England need to do is catch better. A lot of people have been focusing on Jonny Bairstow , but the team in general have not caught well — and it’s one of the reasons they’re 2-1 down, not 2-1 up, or even 3-0 up. A total of 17 dropped catches and missed stumpings have cost England 447 runs in the first three Tests. That doesn’t even factor in wickets with no-balls, with Stuart Broad overstepping as he bowled Usman Khawaja at Edgbaston proving costly. It’s hard enough taking 20 wickets against a side as good as Australia, without needing to create 25 or 26 chances per game. Things have to improve in Manchester. England must improved their fielding in Manchester after dropping 17 catches in three Tests The focus has been on Jonny Bairstow but England have not caught well as a team to date Go for it, Jonny There’s no getting away from the fact that it is a big game for Bairstow. It is right that England have stuck with him, and he often responds when he has a point to prove. The 10-day break will have done him a lot of good, because he looked a bit scrambled at Headingley. When he was batting, his bottom hand started coming through a bit strongly because he was tense, and he left a catch to Harry Brook at short leg that he would normally have gone for. That told me his confidence was a bit low. Jonny is at his best when he’s being positive, with both bat and gloves. He has to go for every catch and bat with an attacking mindset. He’s the kind of guy who reads everything and loves proving people wrong. England will be stronger if he’s firing on all cylinders. Bairstow must have an attacking mindset with both the bat and gloves during the fourth Test Percentage game England have lost a lot of wickets to the short ball in this series, and while you don’t want them to put the shot away entirely, there are times when they might play the percentages better. At Headingley, for example, it made sense to take on the bouncers if you were hitting towards the Western Terrace, which had the shorter boundary. It was the same when Ben Stokes got going on the last day at Lord’s and hit towards the Tavern. But if you’ve got four men out waiting for the miscue, and you’re hitting towards the longer boundary, just be careful. You may hit one or two sixes, but the chances are you won’t hang around for long. England have to be smarter at times. Follow the leader Stokes has set an example these last two Tests that others might like to follow. Last summer, he really went at the bowling, because he wanted to send his team-mates the message that it was OK to take chances. He was laying the groundwork for how he wanted England to play. But at Lord’s and Headingley, he reined himself in for a while, then played his shots — they were two perfect examples of reading the situation. England have spent a year establishing this mindset and it has generally served them well. But Stokes has shown there is room for caution too. Ben Stokes has set the example for England by playing the situation during the last two Tests Keep Marnus quiet People talk about the fact that England have limited Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne to one score above 50. But, for me, Labuschagne is the major concern for Australia, because Smith has made two hundreds in his last four games, starting with the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval. Labuschagne is still scratching around for his rhythm . He’s changed guard from off stump to middle, then back to off, and he keeps playing himself in, then getting out to soft dismissals. The busiest man in Manchester will be Australia’s batting coach Michael Di Venuto, giving him all those throwdowns. It will help England’s task if they keep getting David Warner early — if Labuschagne’s coming in against the new ball at 20 for one, rather than against the old ball at 100 for one, Australia’s task will be that much harder. And Warner, for all his struggles against Stuart Broad , remains the kind of player who will go at you. He is still capable of getting Australia off to a flyer. If he succeeds, Labuschagne’s chances improve. Marnus Labuschagne is seeking rhythm but could pose a threat if the batsman finds his form Murphy’s law Whoever ends up bowling Australia’s off-breaks — be it the youngster Todd Murphy or the part-timer Travis Head — England will have to go after him and put more overs into the legs of the Aussie seamers. Pat Cummins is playing his fifth Test in a row here and Mitchell Starc his third — that will matter if it goes to a decider at the Oval. If Murphy plays, England can’t let him settle. They allowed him to get through his first five overs for five runs at Headingley before Stokes took him down. The same goes for Head, who does have nine Test wickets and showed at Lord’s he can do a job, but he offers nothing to fear. England cannot allow spinner Todd Murphy to settle if Australia decide to play the youngster Cross fingers England have to pray it doesn’t rain in Manchester, because they must win the final two Tests to regain the urn. And if the pitch has something in it, like Headingley did, then an attack of Jimmy Anderson, Broad, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood is a match for anyone .

Todd Murphy could be left out by Australia, who may instead pack their side with seam bowling and batting depth, knowing a draw would be enough for them to retain the Ashes . The move would be both a reflection of Australia's lack of faith in a spinner they barely used in the third Test at Headingley and their conservatism in picking both all-rounders in Mitch Marsh and the returning Cameron Green. Australia will make their final decision on Tuesday, with a poor weather forecast also influencing their thinking, but it would be a contentious move at a ground that traditionally takes spin the longer a Test goes on. Murphy came in for the injured Nathan Lyon at Headingley but bowled only 9.3 overs in the Test and was used for just two overs on what became the last day as England chased down 251 to win by three wickets and reduce their Ashes deficit to 2-1 with two to play. Australia will decide whether to leave out Todd Murphy and play without a specialist spinner Murphy bowled just 9.3 overs during Australia's defeat against England in the third Ashes Test England's Moeen Ali believes teams must include at spinner in their XI's at Old Trafford And it is a move that would not be favoured by Moeen Ali, who was named in England's XI as both off-spinner and No3 batsman. 'You have to play a spinner in a Test no matter where but especially at Old Trafford,' said Moeen on Monday. 'It's not always easy, from a captain's point of view, to use somebody who's new to the side but Todd has got a lot of potential. 'It's easy when you've got someone like Nathan Lyon but it will be a test of Pat Cummins captaincy to see how he uses Todd if he plays here.' If Murphy does not play Australian spin will be in the hands of part-timers Travis Head and Steve Smith.

Haddin, who played 66 Tests and was part of three Ashes tours from 2009 to 2015, agreed with Lyon’s combative attitude. “That’s the theatre of an Ashes campaign,” he said. Alex Carey caused a furore 15 minutes before lunch on the final day of the Lord’s Test when he threw Bairstow’s stumps down as the batsman walked out of his crease believing it was the end of an over. However the umpires had not called over and he was given out. The Australians were booed and abused for the remainder of the Test, including the Lord’s Long Room, in unprecedented scenes walking past Marylebone Cricket Club members and as they climbed the stairs to the players’ dining room. Alex Carey celebrates his stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s; an incident that caused tension in the Ashes series. Credit: Reuters Usman Khawaja called security twice and David Warner also clashed with members. Three members have been suspended as investigations continue into what was a major embarrassment for the exclusive MCC. Haddin explained that at Lord’s, teams share the same lunchroom. “You have lunch side by side with one buffet so if something’s happened you can make eye contact with someone across from you if it gets a bit controversial. Did you cross paths with Jonny in the lunchroom?” Haddin asked Lyon. “There were a few Australian guys and a few English guys in the lunchroom and I hobbled up on my crutches and stood in the middle of it and tried to calm things down a little bit,” Lyon said with obvious humour. England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow clashed with Australian players in the Lord’s lunchroom after his controversial runout, according to injured spinner Nathan Lyon. Credit: Reuters “You would not have calmed it down,” Haddin laughed. Lyon claimed the Australians were taken aback by the booing and abuse of the MCC members, who have the privilege of having players walk past them indoors coming on and off the field. Lord’s is the only place in the world where this takes place. “The emotions in the room were quite remarkable,” said Lyon, who suffered a serious calf injury earlier in the match and will have a three-month recovery program. Loading “Everyone was gobsmacked but found it’s hilarious because you walk through that Long Room and you’re more chance of getting sued than punched. So you look at it like that and all these guys abusing you and you’re like ‘what’s going on here?’ It was quite funny in all respects.” He was delighted when Carey ran out Bairstow with the match in the balance and England captain Ben Stokes beginning to unwind. “I was in the change room and I just erupted. I was like ‘how good. Suck eggs. That’s out every day of the (week)’,” Lyon recalled. “It was actually quite interesting. Jamie Cox, who used to be part of South Australian cricket and an (Australian) selector and obviously Tasmanian cricketer, he’s now over at the MCC, and I was out the back at Lord’s talking to him. I actually had an older lady come up to me in tears,” said Lyon. “She was an English lady in tears from the main Members’ area, and she said ‘I’ve got to go home. I just want to apologise to you Australian cricketers for the way everyone has reacted inside Lord’s’. “I just told her don’t worry about it, we’re all OK, we’re not worried about getting sledged. But it hit home for me that Ashes cricket can affect so many people in different ways and just the actions of people can hit so many different people as well. It was a nice moment but an awkward moment with the lady in genuine tears about it all.” Watch every ball of the 2023 Ashes series live and exclusive on Channel 9 and 9Now.

The elegant opener has not taken her foot off the gas since then and has represented India in 4 Tests, 78 ODIs, and 119 T20Is. She took centre stage after demonstrating her batting skills in the 2017 ICC World Cup. The teenager was instrumental in taking India to the World Cup finals, where they were defeated by England by 9 runs. Mandhana is now a senior member of the squad and has established herself as a pillar of the Indian women’s cricket team. As the star opener Mandhana celebrates her 27th birthday, here is a look at her records and achievements. Mandhana became the third-quickest Indian to score 1000 runs in T20Is. She was also the tenth-fastest batter in women’s cricket history to achieve this feat. The Mumbai batter took just 49 innings to break the 1000-run mark. In February 2019, the Mumbai batter set the record for the fastest T20I fifty by an Indian player. Mandhana achieved her half-century against New Zealand in just 24 balls. Mandhana became the first player in ODI history to score ten consecutive fifty or more while chasing. Her remarkable run began in 2018 when she batted second and hit 67 runs off 53 deliveries against Australia Woman. The opener was named the ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year in 2018 and 2021. Mandhana also got a half-century on her Test debut in India’s historic Test victory over England. In 2021, again in a Test match against England Mandhana along with her opening partner Shafali Verma put up a partnership of 167 which is the fourth-highest in the history of women’s Test cricket. She and Australia’s Elyse Perry are the only players to have won the ‘Rachael Heyhoe-Flint Award’ twice. Mandhana was also named the ICC’s ODI Player of the Year in 2018 after amassing the highest points in the calendar year.

These were just few of the words and phrases side-mouthed about Usman Khawaja when he was unceremoniously dropped from the Australian team following a narrow 2019 loss to England at Headingley and ahead of the Ashes decider at Old Trafford. Usman Khawaja after being dropped for the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trfford in 2019. Credit: Getty Unkindly and unfairly, they were not just coming from outside the dressing room. There is undoubtedly something poetic about Khawaja returning to Manchester for another decider in 2023 as just about the first man picked in Pat Cummins’ side. He is the world’s leading opening batter over the past two years and a figure of genuine gravitas . “Coming back to Headingley, last time was tough times. It was the toughest point of my career,” Khawaja said. “I thought my career was pretty much over then. My wife [Rachel] was joking about it the other day. She was sitting up in a shopping mall at Leeds and she was saying last time I was here, it wasn’t a good time. She was a part of it too. Loading “The team vibe is very different to last time we were here. If I look back the last two years, the vibe’s been awesome, I’ve been loving it. There’s a lot of onus and respect and accountability on the players, and players being the professionals we are, we really leave no stone unturned as individuals, so every time we go out there to play cricket we’re ready. So, we’ll be ready again. “It’s funny how things work out. You get to come back to England and actually play at Old Trafford this time. It’s a very different vibe. The team is in a different place. I am really now just enjoying it.” For an example of Khawaja’s greater cachet, take the dry but undoubtedly critical question he raised about over-rates and their penalties in Test matches. Australia missed the inaugural World Test Championship final because of slow over-rates during a period when Khawaja was out of the team. In typically frank and insightful fashion at Australia’s main training session on Sunday, Khawaja recalled how he started a conversation with the International Cricket Council’s cricket manager, Wasim Khan, that has led to a revision of the system to better reward teams that – as Australia and England have done – play entertaining cricket. “I was pretty frustrated with what was happening,” Khawaja said of a fines system that was leaving players on both sides with little if any of their match fees left. “I’m an ACA board member, so I do look at what’s [happening] around cricket. I just thought someone has to find a way to speak to the ICC about it. “We had played three games, and they’d been three really good games with results [and] entertainment – the WTC [final] was the highest-watched Test match ever or something like that. Just really good stuff. And we were getting fined 80 per cent of our match fee. It’s a lot of money. “Just really frustrating as a player. You are giving it your all out there, providing entertainment, then you are getting stung for it. [I] just felt like I needed to speak and Wasim was really good, got him on text, called him, we talked. He took the feedback.” From there, the conversation broadened to Cummins, Australia’s coach Andrew McDonald and other teams. Loading “Patty talked to him, Andrew McDonald talked to him, and, to his [Khan’s] credit, it wasn’t just listening and no action,” Khawaja said. “Actions happened within one or two weeks. They came back to us; there was a bit of compromise. “We are trying to go as fast as we can. It’s the conditions that make it hard for us. If you are in India we are never behind the over-rate, [because we have] two spinners going at it. We were getting results, that’s what was frustrating. I think England were frustrated with it, too. “Wasim Khan actually listening to the players, getting the feedback and finding the compromise, it’s the first time I’ve been involved that something like that has happened at ICC [level]. I think it’s a really good step forward.” Khawaja has made similar interventions in Australia in order to aid the cause of greater diversity in the game, and was also an outspoken voice in support of the 2022 tour of Pakistan when some players and staff were wavering on the idea of going. Usman Khawaja captained Australia against Derbyshire in 2019. Credit: Getty Images Now aged 36, it seems unlikely Khawaja will captain Australia – outside the one tour game when he led the team against Derbyshire in 2019, just a couple of days before he was dropped for the Manchester Test. But he is making his mark with the broad support of his team. Throughout this Ashes series, Khawaja has been calm at the crease, accumulating runs without once falling into the trap of trying to play at England’s faster tempo. “I’d love to win the Ashes. It’s something all of us would love to do,” he said. “But I am so process-focussed now, it doesn’t bother me any more. I go about my process and what I can do for the team. Loading “If I do that well enough and consistently enough, and the other guys do that, we can be the better team and win the Ashes. And if we do that, that’s when I’ll look back and celebrate and really enjoy.“ Might Khawaja, with all his past setbacks, be a key part of Australia’s first side to win the Ashes in England since 2001?

What’s been heartening is how England have made Australia revisit their approach, which is testament to the ethos and brand of cricket this side are playing. It’s what makes rivalries in sport so special. You are constantly pushing each other to be better. The announcement of equal prize money for ICC events was a big moment for women’s cricket and if there were any questions over equal pay then this series has certainly made a case for that. With record ticket sales at Test-match grounds and viewing numbers through the roof – Headingley’s men’s Test got an average 965,000 viewers on Sky while 795,000 watched the women’s T20 at Lords last Saturday. For the sport itself – despite questions being raised over interest in the game and the popularity of Test cricket – the Ashes has only grown cricket’s fanbase due to exciting performances from both the men’s and women’s teams. Parallels can be drawn heading into the men’s fourth Test, in that composure and ruthlessness were always the missing pieces of the puzzle for England to unlock their winning potential. By getting over the line at Headingley the men now have even more belief to overcome Australia. At the start of the Ashes, it was all about demystifying their opponent and playing without fear. Now, they have a fighting chance to win. The narrative around Jimmy Anderson and his return to home turf at Old Trafford is how it was always meant to be. A much-needed breather for England’s greatest wicket-taker will have allowed him to fine-tune his bowling and return full of energy . I look forward to seeing the crowd get behind him at his home ground, especially bowling from his own end. British mum dies alone in Turkish hospital after £2,000 gastric sleeve surgery Ronan Keating’s brother Ciaran Keating dies after car crash Rolling Stones star’s ‘accidental’ death called into question by unearthed statement It’s been a long road back for Chris Woakes but he has brought calm and steel to this team. And when you consider what Mark Wood brings , the answer pretty simple – he is electrifying. It was abundantly clear how much he unsettled the Australian batters during the third Test with his extra pace. It’s the sheer will and madness of the man (pictured) which adds to everything he does. Now England have a 96mph weapon, it will lift the side even more. England’s decision to keep Moeen Ali at No.3 is no bad thing – the side have nothing to lose with him being there, and they might get more from Harry Brook at five. Much has been said about Stuart Broad and his continued dominance over David Warner, and from experience as a former bowler, when you get into someone’s head, you feel you can get them out every delivery. As a batter sometimes you have to park your ego and ask your partner to face the majority of those balls until the bowler tires. Cricket is a team game and Usman Khawaja might have to take one for them in an effort to break the cycle and allow Warner to flourish. Jonny Bairstow has remained a hot topic of debate with England deciding to retain him for the remainder of the series, rather than replacing him with Ben Foakes who is no doubt the better gloveman. With the loyalty they have shown, they will be hoping at some point that will be repaid with interest. The pressure is now on both sides to outperform one another again this week, as England battle to level the playing field at 2-2 and give this series that grand finale it so deserves. As we head to Old Trafford, I’m sure fans and media alike will once again remember the late, great Shane Warne, who made his indelible mark on the Ashes 30 years ago, with the legendary ‘Ball of the Century’. It was the ball that changed his life and inspired countless others. We miss him. As a tribute to the great man, IG has been giving fans at every Test ground the chance to face an over of Shane Warne and other great overs in Ashes history.

Australia lead the series 2-1 ahead of the next instalment at Old Trafford with pressure on Ben Stokes' side to level the series. Mail Sport’s NASSER HUSSAIN outlines the areas they need to get right. Hold on! The first thing England need to do is catch better. A lot of people have been focusing on Jonny Bairstow , but the team in general have not caught well — and it’s one of the reasons they’re 2-1 down, not 2-1 up, or even 3-0 up. A total of 17 dropped catches and missed stumpings have cost England 447 runs in the first three Tests. That doesn’t even factor in wickets with no-balls, with Stuart Broad overstepping as he bowled Usman Khawaja at Edgbaston proving costly. It’s hard enough taking 20 wickets against a side as good as Australia, without needing to create 25 or 26 chances per game. Things have to improve in Manchester. England must improved their fielding in Manchester after dropping 17 catches in three Tests The focus has been on Jonny Bairstow but England have not caught well as a team to date Go for it, Jonny There’s no getting away from the fact that it is a big game for Bairstow. It is right that England have stuck with him, and he often responds when he has a point to prove. The 10-day break will have done him a lot of good, because he looked a bit scrambled at Headingley. When he was batting, his bottom hand started coming through a bit strongly because he was tense, and he left a catch to Harry Brook at short leg that he would normally have gone for. That told me his confidence was a bit low. Jonny is at his best when he’s being positive, with both bat and gloves. He has to go for every catch and bat with an attacking mindset. He’s the kind of guy who reads everything and loves proving people wrong. England will be stronger if he’s firing on all cylinders. Bairstow must have an attacking mindset with both the bat and gloves during the fourth Test Percentage game England have lost a lot of wickets to the short ball in this series, and while you don’t want them to put the shot away entirely, there are times when they might play the percentages better. At Headingley, for example, it made sense to take on the bouncers if you were hitting towards the Western Terrace, which had the shorter boundary. It was the same when Ben Stokes got going on the last day at Lord’s and hit towards the Tavern. But if you’ve got four men out waiting for the miscue, and you’re hitting towards the longer boundary, just be careful. You may hit one or two sixes, but the chances are you won’t hang around for long. England have to be smarter at times. Follow the leader Stokes has set an example these last two Tests that others might like to follow. Last summer, he really went at the bowling, because he wanted to send his team-mates the message that it was OK to take chances. He was laying the groundwork for how he wanted England to play. But at Lord’s and Headingley, he reined himself in for a while, then played his shots — they were two perfect examples of reading the situation. England have spent a year establishing this mindset and it has generally served them well. But Stokes has shown there is room for caution too. Ben Stokes has set the example for England by playing the situation during the last two Tests Keep Marnus quiet People talk about the fact that England have limited Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne to one score above 50. But, for me, Labuschagne is the major concern for Australia, because Smith has made two hundreds in his last four games, starting with the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval. Labuschagne is still scratching around for his rhythm . He’s changed guard from off stump to middle, then back to off, and he keeps playing himself in, then getting out to soft dismissals. The busiest man in Manchester will be Australia’s batting coach Michael Di Venuto, giving him all those throwdowns. It will help England’s task if they keep getting David Warner early — if Labuschagne’s coming in against the new ball at 20 for one, rather than against the old ball at 100 for one, Australia’s task will be that much harder. And Warner, for all his struggles against Stuart Broad , remains the kind of player who will go at you. He is still capable of getting Australia off to a flyer. If he succeeds, Labuschagne’s chances improve. Marnus Labuschagne is seeking rhythm but could pose a threat if the batsman finds his form Murphy’s law Whoever ends up bowling Australia’s off-breaks — be it the youngster Todd Murphy or the part-timer Travis Head — England will have to go after him and put more overs into the legs of the Aussie seamers. Pat Cummins is playing his fifth Test in a row here and Mitchell Starc his third — that will matter if it goes to a decider at the Oval. If Murphy plays, England can’t let him settle. They allowed him to get through his first five overs for five runs at Headingley before Stokes took him down. The same goes for Head, who does have nine Test wickets and showed at Lord’s he can do a job, but he offers nothing to fear. England cannot allow spinner Todd Murphy to settle if Australia decide to play the youngster Cross fingers England have to pray it doesn’t rain in Manchester, because they must win the final two Tests to regain the urn. And if the pitch has something in it, like Headingley did, then an attack of Jimmy Anderson, Broad, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood is a match for anyone .

Todd Murphy could be left out by Australia, who may instead pack their side with seam bowling and batting depth, knowing a draw would be enough for them to retain the Ashes . The move would be both a reflection of Australia's lack of faith in a spinner they barely used in the third Test at Headingley and their conservatism in picking both all-rounders in Mitch Marsh and the returning Cameron Green. Australia will make their final decision on Tuesday, with a poor weather forecast also influencing their thinking, but it would be a contentious move at a ground that traditionally takes spin the longer a Test goes on. Murphy came in for the injured Nathan Lyon at Headingley but bowled only 9.3 overs in the Test and was used for just two overs on what became the last day as England chased down 251 to win by three wickets and reduce their Ashes deficit to 2-1 with two to play. Australia will decide whether to leave out Todd Murphy and play without a specialist spinner Murphy bowled just 9.3 overs during Australia's defeat against England in the third Ashes Test England's Moeen Ali believes teams must include at spinner in their XI's at Old Trafford And it is a move that would not be favoured by Moeen Ali, who was named in England's XI as both off-spinner and No3 batsman. 'You have to play a spinner in a Test no matter where but especially at Old Trafford,' said Moeen on Monday. 'It's not always easy, from a captain's point of view, to use somebody who's new to the side but Todd has got a lot of potential. 'It's easy when you've got someone like Nathan Lyon but it will be a test of Pat Cummins captaincy to see how he uses Todd if he plays here.' If Murphy does not play Australian spin will be in the hands of part-timers Travis Head and Steve Smith.

Haddin, who played 66 Tests and was part of three Ashes tours from 2009 to 2015, agreed with Lyon’s combative attitude. “That’s the theatre of an Ashes campaign,” he said. Alex Carey caused a furore 15 minutes before lunch on the final day of the Lord’s Test when he threw Bairstow’s stumps down as the batsman walked out of his crease believing it was the end of an over. However the umpires had not called over and he was given out. The Australians were booed and abused for the remainder of the Test, including the Lord’s Long Room, in unprecedented scenes walking past Marylebone Cricket Club members and as they climbed the stairs to the players’ dining room.

Credit: Reuters Usman Khawaja called security twice and David Warner also clashed with members. Three members have been suspended as investigations continue into what was a major embarrassment for the exclusive MCC. Haddin explained that at Lord’s, teams share the same lunchroom. “You have lunch side by side with one buffet so if something’s happened you can make eye contact with someone across from you if it gets a bit controversial. Did you cross paths with Jonny in the lunchroom?” Haddin asked Lyon. “There were a few Australian guys and a few English guys in the lunchroom and I hobbled up on my crutches and stood in the middle of it and tried to calm things down a little bit,” Lyon said with obvious humour. England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow clashed with Australian players in the Lord’s lunchroom after his controversial runout, according to injured spinner Nathan Lyon. Credit: Reuters “You would not have calmed it down,” Haddin laughed. Lyon claimed the Australians were taken aback by the booing and abuse of the MCC members, who have the privilege of having players walk past them indoors coming on and off the field. Lord’s is the only place in the world where this takes place. “The emotions in the room were quite remarkable,” said Lyon, who suffered a serious calf injury earlier in the match and will have a three-month recovery program. Loading “Everyone was gobsmacked but found it’s hilarious because you walk through that Long Room and you’re more chance of getting sued than punched. So you look at it like that and all these guys abusing you and you’re like ‘what’s going on here?’ It was quite funny in all respects.” He was delighted when Carey ran out Bairstow with the match in the balance and England captain Ben Stokes beginning to unwind. “I was in the change room and I just erupted. I was like ‘how good. Suck eggs. That’s out every day of the (week)’,” Lyon recalled. “It was actually quite interesting. Jamie Cox, who used to be part of South Australian cricket and an (Australian) selector and obviously Tasmanian cricketer, he’s now over at the MCC, and I was out the back at Lord’s talking to him. I actually had an older lady come up to me in tears,” said Lyon. “She was an English lady in tears from the main Members’ area, and she said ‘I’ve got to go home. I just want to apologise to you Australian cricketers for the way everyone has reacted inside Lord’s’. “I just told her don’t worry about it, we’re all OK, we’re not worried about getting sledged. But it hit home for me that Ashes cricket can affect so many people in different ways and just the actions of people can hit so many different people as well. It was a nice moment but an awkward moment with the lady in genuine tears about it all.” Watch every ball of the 2023 Ashes series live and exclusive on Channel 9 and 9Now.

The elegant opener has not taken her foot off the gas since then and has represented India in 4 Tests, 78 ODIs, and 119 T20Is. She took centre stage after demonstrating her batting skills in the 2017 ICC World Cup. The teenager was instrumental in taking India to the World Cup finals, where they were defeated by England by 9 runs. Mandhana is now a senior member of the squad and has established herself as a pillar of the Indian women’s cricket team. As the star opener Mandhana celebrates her 27th birthday, here is a look at her records and achievements. Mandhana became the third-quickest Indian to score 1000 runs in T20Is. She was also the tenth-fastest batter in women’s cricket history to achieve this feat. The Mumbai batter took just 49 innings to break the 1000-run mark. In February 2019, the Mumbai batter set the record for the fastest T20I fifty by an Indian player. Mandhana achieved her half-century against New Zealand in just 24 balls. Mandhana became the first player in ODI history to score ten consecutive fifty or more while chasing. Her remarkable run began in 2018 when she batted second and hit 67 runs off 53 deliveries against Australia Woman. The opener was named the ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year in 2018 and 2021. Mandhana also got a half-century on her Test debut in India’s historic Test victory over England. In 2021, again in a Test match against England Mandhana along with her opening partner Shafali Verma put up a partnership of 167 which is the fourth-highest in the history of women’s Test cricket. She and Australia’s Elyse Perry are the only players to have won the ‘Rachael Heyhoe-Flint Award’ twice. Mandhana was also named the ICC’s ODI Player of the Year in 2018 after amassing the highest points in the calendar year.

These were just few of the words and phrases side-mouthed about Usman Khawaja when he was unceremoniously dropped from the Australian team following a narrow 2019 loss to England at Headingley and ahead of the Ashes decider at Old Trafford. Usman Khawaja after being dropped for the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trfford in 2019. Credit: Getty Unkindly and unfairly, they were not just coming from outside the dressing room. There is undoubtedly something poetic about Khawaja returning to Manchester for another decider in 2023 as just about the first man picked in Pat Cummins’ side. He is the world’s leading opening batter over the past two years and a figure of genuine gravitas . “Coming back to Headingley, last time was tough times. It was the toughest point of my career,” Khawaja said. “I thought my career was pretty much over then. My wife [Rachel] was joking about it the other day. She was sitting up in a shopping mall at Leeds and she was saying last time I was here, it wasn’t a good time. She was a part of it too. Loading “The team vibe is very different to last time we were here. If I look back the last two years, the vibe’s been awesome, I’ve been loving it. There’s a lot of onus and respect and accountability on the players, and players being the professionals we are, we really leave no stone unturned as individuals, so every time we go out there to play cricket we’re ready. So, we’ll be ready again. “It’s funny how things work out. You get to come back to England and actually play at Old Trafford this time. It’s a very different vibe. The team is in a different place. I am really now just enjoying it.” For an example of Khawaja’s greater cachet, take the dry but undoubtedly critical question he raised about over-rates and their penalties in Test matches. Australia missed the inaugural World Test Championship final because of slow over-rates during a period when Khawaja was out of the team. In typically frank and insightful fashion at Australia’s main training session on Sunday, Khawaja recalled how he started a conversation with the International Cricket Council’s cricket manager, Wasim Khan, that has led to a revision of the system to better reward teams that – as Australia and England have done – play entertaining cricket. “I was pretty frustrated with what was happening,” Khawaja said of a fines system that was leaving players on both sides with little if any of their match fees left. “I’m an ACA board member, so I do look at what’s [happening] around cricket. I just thought someone has to find a way to speak to the ICC about it. “We had played three games, and they’d been three really good games with results [and] entertainment – the WTC [final] was the highest-watched Test match ever or something like that. Just really good stuff. And we were getting fined 80 per cent of our match fee. It’s a lot of money. “Just really frustrating as a player. You are giving it your all out there, providing entertainment, then you are getting stung for it. [I] just felt like I needed to speak and Wasim was really good, got him on text, called him, we talked. He took the feedback.” From there, the conversation broadened to Cummins, Australia’s coach Andrew McDonald and other teams. Loading “Patty talked to him, Andrew McDonald talked to him, and, to his [Khan’s] credit, it wasn’t just listening and no action,” Khawaja said. “Actions happened within one or two weeks. They came back to us; there was a bit of compromise. “We are trying to go as fast as we can. It’s the conditions that make it hard for us. If you are in India we are never behind the over-rate, [because we have] two spinners going at it. We were getting results, that’s what was frustrating. I think England were frustrated with it, too. “Wasim Khan actually listening to the players, getting the feedback and finding the compromise, it’s the first time I’ve been involved that something like that has happened at ICC [level]. I think it’s a really good step forward.” Khawaja has made similar interventions in Australia in order to aid the cause of greater diversity in the game, and was also an outspoken voice in support of the 2022 tour of Pakistan when some players and staff were wavering on the idea of going. Usman Khawaja captained Australia against Derbyshire in 2019. Credit: Getty Images Now aged 36, it seems unlikely Khawaja will captain Australia – outside the one tour game when he led the team against Derbyshire in 2019, just a couple of days before he was dropped for the Manchester Test. But he is making his mark with the broad support of his team. Throughout this Ashes series, Khawaja has been calm at the crease, accumulating runs without once falling into the trap of trying to play at England’s faster tempo. “I’d love to win the Ashes. It’s something all of us would love to do,” he said. “But I am so process-focussed now, it doesn’t bother me any more. I go about my process and what I can do for the team. Loading “If I do that well enough and consistently enough, and the other guys do that, we can be the better team and win the Ashes. And if we do that, that’s when I’ll look back and celebrate and really enjoy.“ Might Khawaja, with all his past setbacks, be a key part of Australia’s first side to win the Ashes in England since 2001?

It’s been an incredible series and I echo Heather Knight’s words that it is the greatest of all time. For the skill levels, competitiveness, last-over thrillers, crowds and visibility it’s hard to argue against that. For that same reason, it was one deserving of a grand finale and Nat Sciver-Brunt, who played so magnificently, really should have had a fairytale ending. Yet, despite the loss, they can still draw the series by winning today and it’s perhaps befitting of two sides who have battled it out brilliantly over the last month . What’s been heartening is how England have made Australia revisit their approach, which is testament to the ethos and brand of cricket this side are playing. It’s what makes rivalries in sport so special. You are constantly pushing each other to be better. The announcement of equal prize money for ICC events was a big moment for women’s cricket and if there were any questions over equal pay then this series has certainly made a case for that. With record ticket sales at Test-match grounds and viewing numbers through the roof – Headingley’s men’s Test got an average 965,000 viewers on Sky while 795,000 watched the women’s T20 at Lords last Saturday. For the sport itself – despite questions being raised over interest in the game and the popularity of Test cricket – the Ashes has only grown cricket’s fanbase due to exciting performances from both the men’s and women’s teams. Parallels can be drawn heading into the men’s fourth Test, in that composure and ruthlessness were always the missing pieces of the puzzle for England to unlock their winning potential. By getting over the line at Headingley the men now have even more belief to overcome Australia. At the start of the Ashes, it was all about demystifying their opponent and playing without fear. Now, they have a fighting chance to win. The narrative around Jimmy Anderson and his return to home turf at Old Trafford is how it was always meant to be. A much-needed breather for England’s greatest wicket-taker will have allowed him to fine-tune his bowling and return full of energy . I look forward to seeing the crowd get behind him at his home ground, especially bowling from his own end. British mum dies alone in Turkish hospital after £2,000 gastric sleeve surgery Ronan Keating’s brother Ciaran Keating dies after car crash Rolling Stones star’s ‘accidental’ death called into question by unearthed statement It’s been a long road back for Chris Woakes but he has brought calm and steel to this team. And when you consider what Mark Wood brings , the answer pretty simple – he is electrifying. It was abundantly clear how much he unsettled the Australian batters during the third Test with his extra pace. It’s the sheer will and madness of the man (pictured) which adds to everything he does. Now England have a 96mph weapon, it will lift the side even more. England’s decision to keep Moeen Ali at No.3 is no bad thing – the side have nothing to lose with him being there, and they might get more from Harry Brook at five. Much has been said about Stuart Broad and his continued dominance over David Warner, and from experience as a former bowler, when you get into someone’s head, you feel you can get them out every delivery. As a batter sometimes you have to park your ego and ask your partner to face the majority of those balls until the bowler tires. Cricket is a team game and Usman Khawaja might have to take one for them in an effort to break the cycle and allow Warner to flourish. Jonny Bairstow has remained a hot topic of debate with England deciding to retain him for the remainder of the series, rather than replacing him with Ben Foakes who is no doubt the better gloveman. With the loyalty they have shown, they will be hoping at some point that will be repaid with interest. The pressure is now on both sides to outperform one another again this week, as England battle to level the playing field at 2-2 and give this series that grand finale it so deserves. As we head to Old Trafford, I’m sure fans and media alike will once again remember the late, great Shane Warne, who made his indelible mark on the Ashes 30 years ago, with the legendary ‘Ball of the Century’. It was the ball that changed his life and inspired countless others. We miss him. As a tribute to the great man, IG has been giving fans at every Test ground the chance to face an over of Shane Warne and other great overs in Ashes history. If you think you have what it takes, I’d urge you to head along and have a go at the ‘IG Net Gains Arena’ AR simulator – every run scored will contribute towards the Net Gains Fund, which will be investing in new public net facilities across the country.

Australia lead the series 2-1 ahead of the next instalment at Old Trafford with pressure on Ben Stokes' side to level the series. Mail Sport’s NASSER HUSSAIN outlines the areas they need to get right. Hold on! The first thing England need to do is catch better. A lot of people have been focusing on Jonny Bairstow , but the team in general have not caught well — and it’s one of the reasons they’re 2-1 down, not 2-1 up, or even 3-0 up. A total of 17 dropped catches and missed stumpings have cost England 447 runs in the first three Tests. That doesn’t even factor in wickets with no-balls, with Stuart Broad overstepping as he bowled Usman Khawaja at Edgbaston proving costly. It’s hard enough taking 20 wickets against a side as good as Australia, without needing to create 25 or 26 chances per game. Things have to improve in Manchester. England must improved their fielding in Manchester after dropping 17 catches in three Tests The focus has been on Jonny Bairstow but England have not caught well as a team to date Go for it, Jonny There’s no getting away from the fact that it is a big game for Bairstow. It is right that England have stuck with him, and he often responds when he has a point to prove. The 10-day break will have done him a lot of good, because he looked a bit scrambled at Headingley. When he was batting, his bottom hand started coming through a bit strongly because he was tense, and he left a catch to Harry Brook at short leg that he would normally have gone for. That told me his confidence was a bit low. Jonny is at his best when he’s being positive, with both bat and gloves. He has to go for every catch and bat with an attacking mindset. He’s the kind of guy who reads everything and loves proving people wrong. England will be stronger if he’s firing on all cylinders. Bairstow must have an attacking mindset with both the bat and gloves during the fourth Test Percentage game England have lost a lot of wickets to the short ball in this series, and while you don’t want them to put the shot away entirely, there are times when they might play the percentages better. At Headingley, for example, it made sense to take on the bouncers if you were hitting towards the Western Terrace, which had the shorter boundary. It was the same when Ben Stokes got going on the last day at Lord’s and hit towards the Tavern. But if you’ve got four men out waiting for the miscue, and you’re hitting towards the longer boundary, just be careful. You may hit one or two sixes, but the chances are you won’t hang around for long. England have to be smarter at times. Follow the leader Stokes has set an example these last two Tests that others might like to follow. Last summer, he really went at the bowling, because he wanted to send his team-mates the message that it was OK to take chances. He was laying the groundwork for how he wanted England to play. But at Lord’s and Headingley, he reined himself in for a while, then played his shots — they were two perfect examples of reading the situation. England have spent a year establishing this mindset and it has generally served them well. But Stokes has shown there is room for caution too. Ben Stokes has set the example for England by playing the situation during the last two Tests Keep Marnus quiet People talk about the fact that England have limited Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne to one score above 50. But, for me, Labuschagne is the major concern for Australia, because Smith has made two hundreds in his last four games, starting with the World Test Championship final against India at the Oval. Labuschagne is still scratching around for his rhythm . He’s changed guard from off stump to middle, then back to off, and he keeps playing himself in, then getting out to soft dismissals. The busiest man in Manchester will be Australia’s batting coach Michael Di Venuto, giving him all those throwdowns. It will help England’s task if they keep getting David Warner early — if Labuschagne’s coming in against the new ball at 20 for one, rather than against the old ball at 100 for one, Australia’s task will be that much harder. And Warner, for all his struggles against Stuart Broad , remains the kind of player who will go at you. He is still capable of getting Australia off to a flyer. If he succeeds, Labuschagne’s chances improve. Marnus Labuschagne is seeking rhythm but could pose a threat if the batsman finds his form Murphy’s law Whoever ends up bowling Australia’s off-breaks — be it the youngster Todd Murphy or the part-timer Travis Head — England will have to go after him and put more overs into the legs of the Aussie seamers. Pat Cummins is playing his fifth Test in a row here and Mitchell Starc his third — that will matter if it goes to a decider at the Oval. If Murphy plays, England can’t let him settle. They allowed him to get through his first five overs for five runs at Headingley before Stokes took him down. The same goes for Head, who does have nine Test wickets and showed at Lord’s he can do a job, but he offers nothing to fear. England cannot allow spinner Todd Murphy to settle if Australia decide to play the youngster Cross fingers England have to pray it doesn’t rain in Manchester, because they must win the final two Tests to regain the urn. And if the pitch has something in it, like Headingley did, then an attack of Jimmy Anderson, Broad, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood is a match for anyone .

Todd Murphy could be left out by Australia, who may instead pack their side with seam bowling and batting depth, knowing a draw would be enough for them to retain the Ashes . The move would be both a reflection of Australia's lack of faith in a spinner they barely used in the third Test at Headingley and their conservatism in picking both all-rounders in Mitch Marsh and the returning Cameron Green. Australia will make their final decision on Tuesday, with a poor weather forecast also influencing their thinking, but it would be a contentious move at a ground that traditionally takes spin the longer a Test goes on. Murphy came in for the injured Nathan Lyon at Headingley but bowled only 9.3 overs in the Test and was used for just two overs on what became the last day as England chased down 251 to win by three wickets and reduce their Ashes deficit to 2-1 with two to play. Australia will decide whether to leave out Todd Murphy and play without a specialist spinner Murphy bowled just 9.3 overs during Australia's defeat against England in the third Ashes Test England's Moeen Ali believes teams must include at spinner in their XI's at Old Trafford And it is a move that would not be favoured by Moeen Ali, who was named in England's XI as both off-spinner and No3 batsman. 'You have to play a spinner in a Test no matter where but especially at Old Trafford,' said Moeen on Monday. 'It's not always easy, from a captain's point of view, to use somebody who's new to the side but Todd has got a lot of potential. 'It's easy when you've got someone like Nathan Lyon but it will be a test of Pat Cummins captaincy to see how he uses Todd if he plays here.' If Murphy does not play Australian spin will be in the hands of part-timers Travis Head and Steve Smith.

Haddin, who played 66 Tests and was part of three Ashes tours from 2009 to 2015, agreed with Lyon’s combative attitude. “That’s the theatre of an Ashes campaign,” he said. Alex Carey caused a furore 15 minutes before lunch on the final day of the Lord’s Test when he threw Bairstow’s stumps down as the batsman walked out of his crease believing it was the end of an over. However the umpires had not called over and he was given out. The Australians were booed and abused for the remainder of the Test, including the Lord’s Long Room, in unprecedented scenes walking past Marylebone Cricket Club members and as they climbed the stairs to the players’ dining room. Alex Carey celebrates his stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord’s; an incident that caused tension in the Ashes series. Credit: Reuters Usman Khawaja called security twice and David Warner also clashed with members. Three members have been suspended as investigations continue into what was a major embarrassment for the exclusive MCC. Haddin explained that at Lord’s, teams share the same lunchroom. “You have lunch side by side with one buffet so if something’s happened you can make eye contact with someone across from you if it gets a bit controversial. Did you cross paths with Jonny in the lunchroom?” Haddin asked Lyon. “There were a few Australian guys and a few English guys in the lunchroom and I hobbled up on my crutches and stood in the middle of it and tried to calm things down a little bit,” Lyon said with obvious humour. England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow clashed with Australian players in the Lord’s lunchroom after his controversial runout, according to injured spinner Nathan Lyon. Credit: Reuters “You would not have calmed it down,” Haddin laughed. Lyon claimed the Australians were taken aback by the booing and abuse of the MCC members, who have the privilege of having players walk past them indoors coming on and off the field. Lord’s is the only place in the world where this takes place. “The emotions in the room were quite remarkable,” said Lyon, who suffered a serious calf injury earlier in the match and will have a three-month recovery program. Loading “Everyone was gobsmacked but found it’s hilarious because you walk through that Long Room and you’re more chance of getting sued than punched. So you look at it like that and all these guys abusing you and you’re like ‘what’s going on here?’ It was quite funny in all respects.” He was delighted when Carey ran out Bairstow with the match in the balance and England captain Ben Stokes beginning to unwind. “I was in the change room and I just erupted. I was like ‘how good. Suck eggs. That’s out every day of the (week)’,” Lyon recalled. “It was actually quite interesting. Jamie Cox, who used to be part of South Australian cricket and an (Australian) selector and obviously Tasmanian cricketer, he’s now over at the MCC, and I was out the back at Lord’s talking to him. I actually had an older lady come up to me in tears,” said Lyon. “She was an English lady in tears from the main Members’ area, and she said ‘I’ve got to go home. I just want to apologise to you Australian cricketers for the way everyone has reacted inside Lord’s’. “I just told her don’t worry about it, we’re all OK, we’re not worried about getting sledged. But it hit home for me that Ashes cricket can affect so many people in different ways and just the actions of people can hit so many different people as well. It was a nice moment but an awkward moment with the lady in genuine tears about it all.” Watch every ball of the 2023 Ashes series live and exclusive on Channel 9 and 9Now.

The elegant opener has not taken her foot off the gas since then and has represented India in 4 Tests, 78 ODIs, and 119 T20Is. She took centre stage after demonstrating her batting skills in the 2017 ICC World Cup. The teenager was instrumental in taking India to the World Cup finals, where they were defeated by England by 9 runs. Mandhana is now a senior member of the squad and has established herself as a pillar of the Indian women’s cricket team. As the star opener Mandhana celebrates her 27th birthday, here is a look at her records and achievements. Mandhana became the third-quickest Indian to score 1000 runs in T20Is. She was also the tenth-fastest batter in women’s cricket history to achieve this feat. The Mumbai batter took just 49 innings to break the 1000-run mark. In February 2019, the Mumbai batter set the record for the fastest T20I fifty by an Indian player. Mandhana achieved her half-century against New Zealand in just 24 balls. Mandhana became the first player in ODI history to score ten consecutive fifty or more while chasing. Her remarkable run began in 2018 when she batted second and hit 67 runs off 53 deliveries against Australia Woman. The opener was named the ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year in 2018 and 2021. Mandhana also got a half-century on her Test debut in India’s historic Test victory over England. In 2021, again in a Test match against England Mandhana along with her opening partner Shafali Verma put up a partnership of 167 which is the fourth-highest in the history of women’s Test cricket. She and Australia’s Elyse Perry are the only players to have won the ‘Rachael Heyhoe-Flint Award’ twice. Mandhana was also named the ICC’s ODI Player of the Year in 2018 after amassing the highest points in the calendar year.

Four years later, he returns to Old Trafford a new man - an opening batsman, and leader of an Australian team that has a different “vibe” to it.","content":"Manchester: ”Soft”, “selfish”, “not suited to England”. These were just few of the words and phrases side-mouthed about Usman Khawaja when he was unceremoniously dropped from the Australian team following a narrow 2019 loss to England at Headingley and ahead of the Ashes decider at Old Trafford. Usman Khawaja after being dropped for the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trfford in 2019. Credit: Getty Unkindly and unfairly, they were not just coming from outside the dressing room. There is undoubtedly something poetic about Khawaja returning to Manchester for another decider in 2023 as just about the first man picked in Pat Cummins’ side. He is the world’s leading opening batter over the past two years and a figure of genuine gravitas . “Coming back to Headingley, last time was tough times. It was the toughest point of my career,” Khawaja said. “I thought my career was pretty much over then. My wife [Rachel] was joking about it the other day. She was sitting up in a shopping mall at Leeds and she was saying last time I was here, it wasn’t a good time. She was a part of it too. Loading “The team vibe is very different to last time we were here. If I look back the last two years, the vibe’s been awesome, I’ve been loving it. There’s a lot of onus and respect and accountability on the players, and players being the professionals we are, we really leave no stone unturned as individuals, so every time we go out there to play cricket we’re ready. So, we’ll be ready again. “It’s funny how things work out. You get to come back to England and actually play at Old Trafford this time. It’s a very different vibe. The team is in a different place. I am really now just enjoying it.” For an example of Khawaja’s greater cachet, take the dry but undoubtedly critical question he raised about over-rates and their penalties in Test matches. Australia missed the inaugural World Test Championship final because of slow over-rates during a period when Khawaja was out of the team. In typically frank and insightful fashion at Australia’s main training session on Sunday, Khawaja recalled how he started a conversation with the International Cricket Council’s cricket manager, Wasim Khan, that has led to a revision of the system to better reward teams that – as Australia and England have done – play entertaining cricket. “I was pretty frustrated with what was happening,” Khawaja said of a fines system that was leaving players on both sides with little if any of their match fees left. “I’m an ACA board member, so I do look at what’s [happening] around cricket. I just thought someone has to find a way to speak to the ICC about it. “We had played three games, and they’d been three really good games with results [and] entertainment – the WTC [final] was the highest-watched Test match ever or something like that. Just really good stuff. And we were getting fined 80 per cent of our match fee. It’s a lot of money. “Just really frustrating as a player. You are giving it your all out there, providing entertainment, then you are getting stung for it. [I] just felt like I needed to speak and Wasim was really good, got him on text, called him, we talked. He took the feedback.” From there, the conversation broadened to Cummins, Australia’s coach Andrew McDonald and other teams. Loading “Patty talked to him, Andrew McDonald talked to him, and, to his [Khan’s] credit, it wasn’t just listening and no action,” Khawaja said. “Actions happened within one or two weeks. They came back to us; there was a bit of compromise. “We are trying to go as fast as we can. It’s the conditions that make it hard for us. If you are in India we are never behind the over-rate, [because we have] two spinners going at it. We were getting results, that’s what was frustrating. I think England were frustrated with it, too. “Wasim Khan actually listening to the players, getting the feedback and finding the compromise, it’s the first time I’ve been involved that something like that has happened at ICC [level]. I think it’s a really good step forward.” Khawaja has made similar interventions in Australia in order to aid the cause of greater diversity in the game, and was also an outspoken voice in support of the 2022 tour of Pakistan when some players and staff were wavering on the idea of going. Usman Khawaja captained Australia against Derbyshire in 2019. Credit: Getty Images Now aged 36, it seems unlikely Khawaja will captain Australia – outside the one tour game when he led the team against Derbyshire in 2019, just a couple of days before he was dropped for the Manchester Test. But he is making his mark with the broad support of his team. Throughout this Ashes series, Khawaja has been calm at the crease, accumulating runs without once falling into the trap of trying to play at England’s faster tempo. “I’d love to win the Ashes. It’s something all of us would love to do,” he said. “But I am so process-focussed now, it doesn’t bother me any more. I go about my process and what I can do for the team. Loading “If I do that well enough and consistently enough, and the other guys do that, we can be the better team and win the Ashes. And if we do that, that’s when I’ll look back and celebrate and really enjoy.“ Might Khawaja, with all his past setbacks, be a key part of Australia’s first side to win the Ashes in England since 2001?

It’s been an incredible series and I echo Heather Knight’s words that it is the greatest of all time. For the skill levels, competitiveness, last-over thrillers, crowds and visibility it’s hard to argue against that. For that same reason, it was one deserving of a grand finale and Nat Sciver-Brunt, who played so magnificently, really should have had a fairytale ending. Yet, despite the loss, they can still draw the series by winning today and it’s perhaps befitting of two sides who have battled it out brilliantly over the last month . What’s been heartening is how England have made Australia revisit their approach, which is testament to the ethos and brand of cricket this side are playing. It’s what makes rivalries in sport so special. You are constantly pushing each other to be better. The announcement of equal prize money for ICC events was a big moment for women’s cricket and if there were any questions over equal pay then this series has certainly made a case for that. With record ticket sales at Test-match grounds and viewing numbers through the roof – Headingley’s men’s Test got an average 965,000 viewers on Sky while 795,000 watched the women’s T20 at Lords last Saturday. For the sport itself – despite questions being raised over interest in the game and the popularity of Test cricket – the Ashes has only grown cricket’s fanbase due to exciting performances from both the men’s and women’s teams. Parallels can be drawn heading into the men’s fourth Test, in that composure and ruthlessness were always the missing pieces of the puzzle for England to unlock their winning potential. By getting over the line at Headingley the men now have even more belief to overcome Australia. At the start of the Ashes, it was all about demystifying their opponent and playing without fear. Now, they have a fighting chance to win. The narrative around Jimmy Anderson and his return to home turf at Old Trafford is how it was always meant to be. A much-needed breather for England’s greatest wicket-taker will have allowed him to fine-tune his bowling and return full of energy . I look forward to seeing the crowd get behind him at his home ground, especially bowling from his own end. British mum dies alone in Turkish hospital after £2,000 gastric sleeve surgery Ronan Keating’s brother Ciaran Keating dies after car crash Rolling Stones star’s ‘accidental’ death called into question by unearthed statement It’s been a long road back for Chris Woakes but he has brought calm and steel to this team. And when you consider what Mark Wood brings , the answer pretty simple – he is electrifying. It was abundantly clear how much he unsettled the Australian batters during the third Test with his extra pace. It’s the sheer will and madness of the man (pictured) which adds to everything he does. Now England have a 96mph weapon, it will lift the side even more. England’s decision to keep Moeen Ali at No.3 is no bad thing – the side have nothing to lose with him being there, and they might get more from Harry Brook at five. Much has been said about Stuart Broad and his continued dominance over David Warner, and from experience as a former bowler, when you get into someone’s head, you feel you can get them out every delivery. As a batter sometimes you have to park your ego and ask your partner to face the majority of those balls until the bowler tires. Cricket is a team game and Usman Khawaja might have to take one for them in an effort to break the cycle and allow Warner to flourish. Jonny Bairstow has remained a hot topic of debate with England deciding to retain him for the remainder of the series, rather than replacing him with Ben Foakes who is no doubt the better gloveman. With the loyalty they have shown, they will be hoping at some point that will be repaid with interest. The pressure is now on both sides to outperform one another again this week, as England battle to level the playing field at 2-2 and give this series that grand finale it so deserves. As we head to Old Trafford, I’m sure fans and media alike will once again remember the late, great Shane Warne, who made his indelible mark on the Ashes 30 years ago, with the legendary ‘Ball of the Century’. It was the ball that changed his life and inspired countless others. We miss him. As a tribute to the great man, IG has been giving fans at every Test ground the chance to face an over of Shane Warne and other great overs in Ashes history. If you think you have what it takes, I’d urge you to head along and have a go at the ‘IG Net Gains Arena’ AR simulator – every run scored will contribute towards the Net Gains Fund, which will be investing in new public net facilities across the country.
