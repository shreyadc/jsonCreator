Fernando, 26, has taken 35 wickets in 12 Tests at an average of 28.97 and is set for his first spell in county cricket, bolstering Notts seam-bowling options for the last few weeks of the season. “Asitha has already shown his talent on the international stage, and we believe he has the skillset needed to be successful in English conditions,” Notts Head Coach Peter Moores, said. “We're excited to have him with us, and he will add much needed depth to our bowling resources until the end of the season.” “We've had some misfortune with injuries and we're still in the situation of not having our full complement of seamers available. This has meant greater workloads for a smaller number of bowlers, and Asitha can help ease that pressure over the course of our run-in.” Nottinghamshire are currently seventh in the table out of 10 teams. Former Sri Lanka Captain Gamini Goonesena was the other Lankan cricketer to play for Nottinghamshire in the fifties.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 22:54:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","source_priority":1390226,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"b50911ff008cc67534b538f4818ab560","title":"Ticket prices slashed after poor spectator turn out at Asia Cup matches","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Ticket-prices-slashed-after-poor-spectator-turn-out-at-Asia-Cup-matches/23-752825","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Following the poor turn-up at matches of the ongoing Asia Cup especially when home country Sri Lanka played Bangladesh at the R.

Frustrated supporters branded the club ‘incompetent’ after being told that the Old Trafford Megastore was waiting on the arrival of the required letter to spell out the star signing’s surname. Højlund arrived from Atalanta at the start of August. But fans who tried to buy the 20-year-old’s shirt as late as Friday were told that they were awaiting the arrival of the ‘unique o’ and promised an update on Wednesday. While some may see the issue as trivial, one United follower says it is indicative of how club officials cannot get ‘the most basic’ things right, with the embarrassing situation coming in what has been a dreadful month for the Premier League giants with issues both on and off the field. ‘It’s incompetence,’ the fan, who was unable to get the shirt with the 20-year-old’s name on the back as a birthday present for a relative, said. ‘The big summer signing and you still can’t get a shirt with his name on it because nobody saw fit to get the Danish ‘ø Man United's club shop was unable to sell shirts bearing the name of Rasmus Højlund for more than a month The club did not have any Danish ‘øs’ in stock, so were unable to sell the shirt to fans United insist that the ‘øs’ arrived on Thursday and added that the shirts are now on sale Your browser does not support iframes.

Dementia fund ‘an insult’ The announcement of a new dementia fund last week received a favourable response across football. However, not everyone believes that the move, led by the Premier League and Professional Footballers’ Association, goes far enough. An initial £1m has been made available to help former players and their families who are struggling with neurodegenerative diseases and will include payments for care home costs. The fund, one of the demands in the Daily Mail’s ‘Enough is Enough’ campaign, is meant to provide support while a new charity is set up to act as a long-term vehicle and was described by Maheta Molango, chief executive of the PFA, as ‘an important step forward’. But John Stiles, son of World Cup winner Nobby who passed away having suffered from dementia in 2020, is not impressed. Stiles, a key voice in Mail Sport’s drive, has written to both Molango and Premier League chief exec Richard Masters. He says he is ‘sickened to see that a mere £1m has been allocated to the interim fund’ and describes the sum as ‘desultory and an insult to the players and their families dead and dying’. Stiles fears the fund is a ‘cheap and nasty deal’, adding it is ‘not good enough’. Nobby Stiles suffered from dementia and his son, John, has written to Premier League CEO Richard Masters over the dementia fund Becks turns to one of his own David Beckham has turned to one of his own to help Salford City - the club he co-owns with a number of fellow Class of 92 stars.

In-game interview plot In-game interviews with Premier League stars could soon become commonplace if broadcasters get their way. International partners have told league bosses they want them to improve access while matches are taking place and have made a number of proposals that they want to be part of the deal for the next cycle of rights. Alongside cameras in dressing rooms, broadcasters want to be able to speak to players moments after they have been substituted, in a move they feel will greatly enhance coverage. In theory, clubs would have to provide a player to speak from the bench on a set number of occasions with the hope that viewers would hear from someone who has made a match-changing contribution. The prospect received a lukewarm response, Agenda understands, when it was relayed to clubs last week. Clubs would have to provide a player to speak from the bench on a set number of occasions as broadcasters want in-game interviews to become commonplace London law firm to launch specialist reputation consultancy Schillings - the renowned London law firm well known for their specialism in defamation - are to launch a new specialist reputation consultancy. However, the company has not got off to the best start. A press release, announcing the birth of the new venture, named Victoria O’Byrne as a founding partner and stated that she was ‘communications director’ at the London 2012 Olympics. That claim may well come as a surprise to the formidable Jackie Brock-Doyle CBE - who actually held that title. Indeed, O’Byrne – who was actually head of media and external affairs for the Olympic Park legacy company - was the comms chief for the NHS’ disastrous Covid Test and Trace operation. But after £35bn of public funds was spent without success that period of her career strangely fails to merit a mention. Cricket likely to be added to 2028 Olympic games There is growing consternation in the United States that cricket will be added to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics at the expense of the national sports of baseball and softball. The decision, following intense negotiations between the IOC and LA28, was expected on Friday but has been delayed. LA28 are fully aware that baseball/softball would be a guaranteed sell-out at the Games and that cricket may struggle to attract stadium audiences. However, the IOC are thought to be desperate to get cricket onto the programme to kick-start an India bid for the 2036 Games. Tapping into the vast Indian market is understood to be high on the IOC’s agenda and could well see baseball/softball marginalised - despite commitment from top league MLB for their best players to participate.

The Cumbrian might have fallen just short of a maiden ODI ton but, having registered his first fifty of the summer at domestic or international level in Friday’s series opener at Cardiff after a winter in which he battled ankle and knee injuries, the 30-year-old is finding some fluency ahead of next month’s World Cup. 💬 \"I want to be able to push this white-ball team to victories and thankfully, today was one of those days.\" 🎙️ @LiamL489 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) His innings, remarkably the first time he has batted for 50 deliveries or more at international level, ushered England to 226 for seven, enough for a 79-run victory after New Zealand were skittled for 147. “It’s weird, I’ve won (T20) World Cup (last November) but probably had the worst year of my career for form and had two bad injuries,” Livingstone said. “This is something I’ve been crying out for. Unfortunately, there’s a reason why there’s not many lower-order hitters that have mastered the art of the game – it’s a pretty difficult role to do. “If you get on a roll, it’s pretty nice. But you get yourself in a bit of a rut, it’s quite hard to get out of. It’s probably the first time in my career where I’ve had two months of struggling. “I’ve put in a lot of work behind the scenes to try and go back to knowing what I can do and that’s win games for England. Thankfully I’ve done that.” After being blown away in Cardiff on Friday, this was an impressive response from England, especially after losing Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes within the space of eight Trent Boult deliveries. In his 100th ODI, the left-arm seamer exploited bowler-friendly conditions after rain had delayed the start time and led to the contest being reduced to 34 overs per side at Southampton and England needed every ounce of their batting depth to dig them out of the perilous position of eight for three. Livingstone strode out at number seven after just 12.1 overs and was strong all around the ground, while he took a particular liking to Tim Southee, with six of his 10 boundaries – nine fours and a six – coming off the New Zealand Test captain. Livingstone recognised he owed a debt of gratitude to Curran, who was a useful foil as he contributed 42 off 35 deliveries before lapping to short third in the final over. “I don’t think consolidation is a word we use in the dressing room,” Livingstone said. “We’ve just got to see what we think is best in that situation. If in doubt, take the aggressive option. “We knew it wasn’t going to be the easiest pitch but it was just about getting to a score we felt we could defend. “My initial role was to just get used to the conditions and bat with Mo and then try and put on a partnership with Sammy. “To have someone like Sam Curran batting at eight in any team in world cricket is pretty nice. Something we pride ourselves on is the depth we’ve got, we’ve got a lot of batting for days like this when things don’t go right up top. “It’s a pretty rare occasion we end up 50 for five because of the quality we’ve got in our team. It’s always nice that when it does happen, you can put your hand up and win a game for England.” New Zealand were going along nicely on 111 for three but Reece Topley’s dismissal of captain Tom Latham induced a collapse, which saw the Black Caps lose their last seven wickets for 36 runs in 39 balls. Topley, whose dismissal of Latham was his first wicket in five ODIs, then snared middle-order duo Glenn Phillips and Rachin Ravindra in his next over to finish with three for 27 in seven impressive overs. Daryl Mitchell, whose brutal unbeaten ton set up an eight-wicket win at Sophia Gardens, overturned being given out on nought to bludgeon 57 off 52 balls. But he became Moeen Ali’s 100th ODI wicket which saw New Zealand slide quickly to defeat in the second of four matches as they were all out in 26.5 overs. “I thought our bowlers were exceptional,” Livingstone added. “They learnt from how New Zealand bowled and pretty much nailed the game plan.”","pubDate":"2023-09-10 20:19:46","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17211807/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"24c988ad8c4b6f8d8e416582e5001e90","title":"Liam Livingstone makes innings he was ‘crying out for’ as England level series","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23780058.liam-livingstone-makes-innings-crying-for-england-level-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The all-rounder scored an unbeaten 95 as England drew level in their ODI series against New Zealand","content":"England stumbled to 55 for five at the Ageas Bowl but were bailed out by Livingstone, who shared a restorative 48-run stand with Moeen Ali before putting on a decisive 112 in 77 balls with Sam Curran.

Livingstone (95no off 78 balls) hit his highest score in ODIs to help the hosts to overcome a top-order collapse on Sunday (Monday AEST) and set New Zealand a target of 227 in 34 overs, after persistent rain had shortened the match and delayed the toss. \"It wasn't quite a rescue mission. We pride ourselves on our depth,\" said Livingstone, who also scored 52 in the first ODI in Cardiff. \"Lean couple of months but the other day in Cardiff did me a world of good. I just needed one innings.\" New Zealand started their chase poorly, losing opener Finn Allen in the second ball of their innings, and wickets continued to fall at a steady pace as David Willey (3-34) and Reece Topley (3-27) took three apiece. The visitors' main source of runs was again Daryl Mitchell (57), who added a half-century to his ton from the first ODI, but once he departed after holing out to mid-off, there was little New Zealand could do as they were bowled out with eight overs remaining. Put in to bat earlier on Sunday, England were left reeling at 4-28 in the eighth over as Trent Boult ripped through their top order, taking the wickets of Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes. Captain Jos Buttler (30) and Moeen Ali (33) did well to steady the ship, before Livingstone combined for a 112-run partnership with Sam Curran to rescue England and power them to a competitive total at the Rose Bowl. \"Delighted, from the position we found ourselves in, it's a credit to the way we want to play. It was a fantastic partnership,\" Buttler said. \"Livingstone and Curran at seven and eight are within their rights to want to bat higher up. Great start for us with the ball and we carried that on throughout the whole bowling innings.\" The third ODI of the four-match series will be played at The Oval on Wednesday. The series is crucial for both sides' preparations as they look ahead to next month's World Cup in India.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 19:22:23","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11862353/944851f6d3f263826180d04ad691b5ce832651bb-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"af6e8deb280ef9a013d6b904d41f022b","title":"Liam Livingstone leads recovery as England beat New Zealand to level ODI series","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23780024.liam-livingstone-leads-recovery-england-beat-new-zealand-level-odi-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"David Willey and Reece Topley both took three wickets as New Zealand were beaten by 79 runs.","content":"England were reeling on eight for three after Trent Boult expertly exploited bowler-friendly conditions early on, while the hosts lurched to 55 for five before being bailed out by Livingstone and Sam Curran. The pair put on 112 for the seventh wicket in 77 balls, the cornerstone of England’s 226 for seven in a 34-over contest, enough to secure a 79-run win as Reece Topley and David Willey took three wickets each. England draw level in the series after an incredible fightback 🙌 | 📝: — ICC (@ICC) After being blown away in Cardiff on Friday, this was an impressive response from England, especially after losing Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes within the space of eight deliveries from Boult after they were asked to bat first in overcast conditions. Livingstone, who registered his first fifty of the summer in the Welsh capital, was fluent all around the ground at Southampton in what was remarkably his first innings of 50 or more deliveries in an innings for England, while Sam Curran, with 42 off 35 balls, proved a capable foil. Despite being without Adil Rashid because of mild calf tightness – with three and a half weeks until the start of their World Cup campaign in India, England insisted his absence was precautionary – Jos Buttler’s side showed more of a cutting edge with the ball than they had done in the series opener. After rain led to a three-hour delay and a shortened contest, Boult wreaked havoc in his first ODI in a year in an opening spell of 3-1-3-3, first squaring up Bairstow, whose leading edge on another day might have landed safely but on this occasion was superbly plucked one-handed out the air by Mitchell Santner. Root was beaten by a fuller inswinging delivery two balls later and given lbw, wisely declining a review as the Yorkshireman trudged off for his fourth duck in his last 10 ODIs, while Boult followed up a double wicket maiden by snaring an advancing Stokes, who clothed the left-armer to mid-off. Buttler briefly rallied, offsetting Boult’s rhythm with three fours of varying quality down the ground in an over yielding 15, but England’s early luck was encapsulated by their captain dragging a Santner long hop on to his leg stump for 30 off 25 balls. Santner clenched his teeth at his fortune. England were in a tailspin after 12.1 overs as Livingstone joined Moeen Ali, who drove lustily in a 48-run rebuilding job before expertly slog sweeping Rachin Ravindra for the first six. Moeen departed for 33, the ball after taking England to 100, slashing ungainly at Tim Southee as Glenn Phillips took a fine grab. From 55-5 to 226-7 👏 Livingstone 🤝 Curran Catch up on our innings here 👇 — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Livingstone enjoyed facing up to Southee, with six of his nine fours coming off the seamer, including three in an over – two through power and one via careful placement. Curran proved a more than handy ally, heaving spin duo Ravindra and Santner for sixes, while Livingstone, who got the benefit of the doubt after missing a big hit at Phillips as a review showed the ball would only have trimmed leg stump, rocked back and pulled mightily into the stands off Matt Henry. Livingstone was unable to convert a fine innings into three figures, with Curran departing in the final over after lapping to short third to end their stand. Willey struck with the second ball of New Zealand’s reply, snaking through the defences of Finn Allen and knocking back middle stump while Devon Conway, an unbeaten centurion in Cardiff, made a scratchy 14 before driving loosely and edging behind to give Gus Atkinson his maiden ODI wicket. FIRST ODI WICKET! ☝️ A brilliant bit of bowling from Gus Atkinson 💥 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Mitchell overturned being given out on nought but Will Young was stopped on his tracks on 33 by Willey’s direct hit. Topley then followed up a parsimonious opening five-over spell by ending a 56-run union between Mitchell and New Zealand captain Tom Latham, who hung his bat out uncertainly and edged behind to Buttler. Having claimed his first wicket in five ODIs, Topley swung the game in England’s favour in his next over by taking a return catch off Phillips before Ravindra wafted to slip two balls later. Topley finished with impressive figures of three for 27 in seven overs. Mitchell, as he had done at Sophia Gardens in a brutal unbeaten hundred, bristled with intent and after going to 50 at just better than a run-a-ball, he launched Moeen back over his head for six. However, he perished for 57 off 52 deliveries after clubbing a full toss to mid-off from the very next ball. New Zealand’s hopes vanished with his departure and Willey claimed the last two wickets in quick succession as the tourists were all out for 147 in 26.5 overs.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 19:06:10","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17212024/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"9e7f4f091226e7d51c46f5456338e459","title":"Vishwa Fernando: Durham sign Sri Lanka seamer for County Championship run-in","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Vishwa-Fernando:-Durham-sign-Sri-Lanka-seamer-for-County-Championship-run-in/315-266996","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Durham have signed Sri Lanka international seamer Vishwa Fernando for their final two County Championship matches of the season.","content":"Durham have signed Sri Lanka international seamer Vishwa Fernando for their final two County Championship matches of the season.

Frustrated supporters branded the club ‘incompetent’ after being told that the Old Trafford Megastore was waiting on the arrival of the required letter to spell out the star signing’s surname. Højlund arrived from Atalanta at the start of August. But fans who tried to buy the 20-year-old’s shirt as late as Friday were told that they were awaiting the arrival of the ‘unique o’ and promised an update on Wednesday. While some may see the issue as trivial, one United follower says it is indicative of how club officials cannot get ‘the most basic’ things right, with the embarrassing situation coming in what has been a dreadful month for the Premier League giants with issues both on and off the field. ‘It’s incompetence,’ the fan, who was unable to get the shirt with the 20-year-old’s name on the back as a birthday present for a relative, said. ‘The big summer signing and you still can’t get a shirt with his name on it because nobody saw fit to get the Danish ‘ø Man United's club shop was unable to sell shirts bearing the name of Rasmus Højlund for more than a month The club did not have any Danish ‘øs’ in stock, so were unable to sell the shirt to fans United insist that the ‘øs’ arrived on Thursday and added that the shirts are now on sale Your browser does not support iframes.

Dementia fund ‘an insult’ The announcement of a new dementia fund last week received a favourable response across football. However, not everyone believes that the move, led by the Premier League and Professional Footballers’ Association, goes far enough. An initial £1m has been made available to help former players and their families who are struggling with neurodegenerative diseases and will include payments for care home costs. The fund, one of the demands in the Daily Mail’s ‘Enough is Enough’ campaign, is meant to provide support while a new charity is set up to act as a long-term vehicle and was described by Maheta Molango, chief executive of the PFA, as ‘an important step forward’. But John Stiles, son of World Cup winner Nobby who passed away having suffered from dementia in 2020, is not impressed. Stiles, a key voice in Mail Sport’s drive, has written to both Molango and Premier League chief exec Richard Masters. He says he is ‘sickened to see that a mere £1m has been allocated to the interim fund’ and describes the sum as ‘desultory and an insult to the players and their families dead and dying’. Stiles fears the fund is a ‘cheap and nasty deal’, adding it is ‘not good enough’. Nobby Stiles suffered from dementia and his son, John, has written to Premier League CEO Richard Masters over the dementia fund Becks turns to one of his own David Beckham has turned to one of his own to help Salford City - the club he co-owns with a number of fellow Class of 92 stars.

In-game interview plot In-game interviews with Premier League stars could soon become commonplace if broadcasters get their way. International partners have told league bosses they want them to improve access while matches are taking place and have made a number of proposals that they want to be part of the deal for the next cycle of rights. Alongside cameras in dressing rooms, broadcasters want to be able to speak to players moments after they have been substituted, in a move they feel will greatly enhance coverage. In theory, clubs would have to provide a player to speak from the bench on a set number of occasions with the hope that viewers would hear from someone who has made a match-changing contribution. The prospect received a lukewarm response, Agenda understands, when it was relayed to clubs last week. Clubs would have to provide a player to speak from the bench on a set number of occasions as broadcasters want in-game interviews to become commonplace London law firm to launch specialist reputation consultancy Schillings - the renowned London law firm well known for their specialism in defamation - are to launch a new specialist reputation consultancy. However, the company has not got off to the best start. A press release, announcing the birth of the new venture, named Victoria O’Byrne as a founding partner and stated that she was ‘communications director’ at the London 2012 Olympics. That claim may well come as a surprise to the formidable Jackie Brock-Doyle CBE - who actually held that title. Indeed, O’Byrne – who was actually head of media and external affairs for the Olympic Park legacy company - was the comms chief for the NHS’ disastrous Covid Test and Trace operation. But after £35bn of public funds was spent without success that period of her career strangely fails to merit a mention. Cricket likely to be added to 2028 Olympic games There is growing consternation in the United States that cricket will be added to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics at the expense of the national sports of baseball and softball. The decision, following intense negotiations between the IOC and LA28, was expected on Friday but has been delayed. LA28 are fully aware that baseball/softball would be a guaranteed sell-out at the Games and that cricket may struggle to attract stadium audiences. However, the IOC are thought to be desperate to get cricket onto the programme to kick-start an India bid for the 2036 Games. Tapping into the vast Indian market is understood to be high on the IOC’s agenda and could well see baseball/softball marginalised - despite commitment from top league MLB for their best players to participate.

The Cumbrian might have fallen just short of a maiden ODI ton but, having registered his first fifty of the summer at domestic or international level in Friday’s series opener at Cardiff after a winter in which he battled ankle and knee injuries, the 30-year-old is finding some fluency ahead of next month’s World Cup. 💬 \"I want to be able to push this white-ball team to victories and thankfully, today was one of those days.\" 🎙️ @LiamL489 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) His innings, remarkably the first time he has batted for 50 deliveries or more at international level, ushered England to 226 for seven, enough for a 79-run victory after New Zealand were skittled for 147. “It’s weird, I’ve won (T20) World Cup (last November) but probably had the worst year of my career for form and had two bad injuries,” Livingstone said. “This is something I’ve been crying out for. Unfortunately, there’s a reason why there’s not many lower-order hitters that have mastered the art of the game – it’s a pretty difficult role to do. “If you get on a roll, it’s pretty nice. But you get yourself in a bit of a rut, it’s quite hard to get out of. It’s probably the first time in my career where I’ve had two months of struggling. “I’ve put in a lot of work behind the scenes to try and go back to knowing what I can do and that’s win games for England. Thankfully I’ve done that.” After being blown away in Cardiff on Friday, this was an impressive response from England, especially after losing Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes within the space of eight Trent Boult deliveries. In his 100th ODI, the left-arm seamer exploited bowler-friendly conditions after rain had delayed the start time and led to the contest being reduced to 34 overs per side at Southampton and England needed every ounce of their batting depth to dig them out of the perilous position of eight for three. Livingstone strode out at number seven after just 12.1 overs and was strong all around the ground, while he took a particular liking to Tim Southee, with six of his 10 boundaries – nine fours and a six – coming off the New Zealand Test captain. Livingstone recognised he owed a debt of gratitude to Curran, who was a useful foil as he contributed 42 off 35 deliveries before lapping to short third in the final over. “I don’t think consolidation is a word we use in the dressing room,” Livingstone said. “We’ve just got to see what we think is best in that situation. If in doubt, take the aggressive option. “We knew it wasn’t going to be the easiest pitch but it was just about getting to a score we felt we could defend. “My initial role was to just get used to the conditions and bat with Mo and then try and put on a partnership with Sammy. “To have someone like Sam Curran batting at eight in any team in world cricket is pretty nice. Something we pride ourselves on is the depth we’ve got, we’ve got a lot of batting for days like this when things don’t go right up top. “It’s a pretty rare occasion we end up 50 for five because of the quality we’ve got in our team. It’s always nice that when it does happen, you can put your hand up and win a game for England.” New Zealand were going along nicely on 111 for three but Reece Topley’s dismissal of captain Tom Latham induced a collapse, which saw the Black Caps lose their last seven wickets for 36 runs in 39 balls. Topley, whose dismissal of Latham was his first wicket in five ODIs, then snared middle-order duo Glenn Phillips and Rachin Ravindra in his next over to finish with three for 27 in seven impressive overs. Daryl Mitchell, whose brutal unbeaten ton set up an eight-wicket win at Sophia Gardens, overturned being given out on nought to bludgeon 57 off 52 balls. But he became Moeen Ali’s 100th ODI wicket which saw New Zealand slide quickly to defeat in the second of four matches as they were all out in 26.5 overs. “I thought our bowlers were exceptional,” Livingstone added. “They learnt from how New Zealand bowled and pretty much nailed the game plan.”","pubDate":"2023-09-10 20:19:46","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17211807/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"24c988ad8c4b6f8d8e416582e5001e90","title":"Liam Livingstone makes innings he was ‘crying out for’ as England level series","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23780058.liam-livingstone-makes-innings-crying-for-england-level-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The all-rounder scored an unbeaten 95 as England drew level in their ODI series against New Zealand","content":"England stumbled to 55 for five at the Ageas Bowl but were bailed out by Livingstone, who shared a restorative 48-run stand with Moeen Ali before putting on a decisive 112 in 77 balls with Sam Curran.

Livingstone (95no off 78 balls) hit his highest score in ODIs to help the hosts to overcome a top-order collapse on Sunday (Monday AEST) and set New Zealand a target of 227 in 34 overs, after persistent rain had shortened the match and delayed the toss. \"It wasn't quite a rescue mission. We pride ourselves on our depth,\" said Livingstone, who also scored 52 in the first ODI in Cardiff. \"Lean couple of months but the other day in Cardiff did me a world of good. I just needed one innings.\" New Zealand started their chase poorly, losing opener Finn Allen in the second ball of their innings, and wickets continued to fall at a steady pace as David Willey (3-34) and Reece Topley (3-27) took three apiece. The visitors' main source of runs was again Daryl Mitchell (57), who added a half-century to his ton from the first ODI, but once he departed after holing out to mid-off, there was little New Zealand could do as they were bowled out with eight overs remaining. Put in to bat earlier on Sunday, England were left reeling at 4-28 in the eighth over as Trent Boult ripped through their top order, taking the wickets of Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes. Captain Jos Buttler (30) and Moeen Ali (33) did well to steady the ship, before Livingstone combined for a 112-run partnership with Sam Curran to rescue England and power them to a competitive total at the Rose Bowl. \"Delighted, from the position we found ourselves in, it's a credit to the way we want to play. It was a fantastic partnership,\" Buttler said. \"Livingstone and Curran at seven and eight are within their rights to want to bat higher up. Great start for us with the ball and we carried that on throughout the whole bowling innings.\" The third ODI of the four-match series will be played at The Oval on Wednesday. The series is crucial for both sides' preparations as they look ahead to next month's World Cup in India.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 19:22:23","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11862353/944851f6d3f263826180d04ad691b5ce832651bb-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"af6e8deb280ef9a013d6b904d41f022b","title":"Liam Livingstone leads recovery as England beat New Zealand to level ODI series","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23780024.liam-livingstone-leads-recovery-england-beat-new-zealand-level-odi-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"David Willey and Reece Topley both took three wickets as New Zealand were beaten by 79 runs.","content":"England were reeling on eight for three after Trent Boult expertly exploited bowler-friendly conditions early on, while the hosts lurched to 55 for five before being bailed out by Livingstone and Sam Curran. The pair put on 112 for the seventh wicket in 77 balls, the cornerstone of England’s 226 for seven in a 34-over contest, enough to secure a 79-run win as Reece Topley and David Willey took three wickets each. England draw level in the series after an incredible fightback 🙌 | 📝: — ICC (@ICC) After being blown away in Cardiff on Friday, this was an impressive response from England, especially after losing Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes within the space of eight deliveries from Boult after they were asked to bat first in overcast conditions. Livingstone, who registered his first fifty of the summer in the Welsh capital, was fluent all around the ground at Southampton in what was remarkably his first innings of 50 or more deliveries in an innings for England, while Sam Curran, with 42 off 35 balls, proved a capable foil. Despite being without Adil Rashid because of mild calf tightness – with three and a half weeks until the start of their World Cup campaign in India, England insisted his absence was precautionary – Jos Buttler’s side showed more of a cutting edge with the ball than they had done in the series opener. After rain led to a three-hour delay and a shortened contest, Boult wreaked havoc in his first ODI in a year in an opening spell of 3-1-3-3, first squaring up Bairstow, whose leading edge on another day might have landed safely but on this occasion was superbly plucked one-handed out the air by Mitchell Santner. Root was beaten by a fuller inswinging delivery two balls later and given lbw, wisely declining a review as the Yorkshireman trudged off for his fourth duck in his last 10 ODIs, while Boult followed up a double wicket maiden by snaring an advancing Stokes, who clothed the left-armer to mid-off. Buttler briefly rallied, offsetting Boult’s rhythm with three fours of varying quality down the ground in an over yielding 15, but England’s early luck was encapsulated by their captain dragging a Santner long hop on to his leg stump for 30 off 25 balls. Santner clenched his teeth at his fortune. England were in a tailspin after 12.1 overs as Livingstone joined Moeen Ali, who drove lustily in a 48-run rebuilding job before expertly slog sweeping Rachin Ravindra for the first six. Moeen departed for 33, the ball after taking England to 100, slashing ungainly at Tim Southee as Glenn Phillips took a fine grab. From 55-5 to 226-7 👏 Livingstone 🤝 Curran Catch up on our innings here 👇 — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Livingstone enjoyed facing up to Southee, with six of his nine fours coming off the seamer, including three in an over – two through power and one via careful placement. Curran proved a more than handy ally, heaving spin duo Ravindra and Santner for sixes, while Livingstone, who got the benefit of the doubt after missing a big hit at Phillips as a review showed the ball would only have trimmed leg stump, rocked back and pulled mightily into the stands off Matt Henry. Livingstone was unable to convert a fine innings into three figures, with Curran departing in the final over after lapping to short third to end their stand. Willey struck with the second ball of New Zealand’s reply, snaking through the defences of Finn Allen and knocking back middle stump while Devon Conway, an unbeaten centurion in Cardiff, made a scratchy 14 before driving loosely and edging behind to give Gus Atkinson his maiden ODI wicket. FIRST ODI WICKET! ☝️ A brilliant bit of bowling from Gus Atkinson 💥 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Mitchell overturned being given out on nought but Will Young was stopped on his tracks on 33 by Willey’s direct hit. Topley then followed up a parsimonious opening five-over spell by ending a 56-run union between Mitchell and New Zealand captain Tom Latham, who hung his bat out uncertainly and edged behind to Buttler. Having claimed his first wicket in five ODIs, Topley swung the game in England’s favour in his next over by taking a return catch off Phillips before Ravindra wafted to slip two balls later. Topley finished with impressive figures of three for 27 in seven overs. Mitchell, as he had done at Sophia Gardens in a brutal unbeaten hundred, bristled with intent and after going to 50 at just better than a run-a-ball, he launched Moeen back over his head for six. However, he perished for 57 off 52 deliveries after clubbing a full toss to mid-off from the very next ball. New Zealand’s hopes vanished with his departure and Willey claimed the last two wickets in quick succession as the tourists were all out for 147 in 26.5 overs.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 19:06:10","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17212024/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"9e7f4f091226e7d51c46f5456338e459","title":"Vishwa Fernando: Durham sign Sri Lanka seamer for County Championship run-in","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Vishwa-Fernando:-Durham-sign-Sri-Lanka-seamer-for-County-Championship-run-in/315-266996","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Durham have signed Sri Lanka international seamer Vishwa Fernando for their final two County Championship matches of the season.","content":"Durham have signed Sri Lanka international seamer Vishwa Fernando for their final two County Championship matches of the season.

While some may see the issue as trivial, one United follower says it is indicative of how club officials cannot get ‘the most basic’ things right, with the embarrassing situation coming in what has been a dreadful month for the Premier League giants with issues both on and off the field. ‘It’s incompetence,’ the fan, who was unable to get the shirt with the 20-year-old’s name on the back as a birthday present for a relative, said. ‘The big summer signing and you still can’t get a shirt with his name on it because nobody saw fit to get the Danish ‘ø Man United's club shop was unable to sell shirts bearing the name of Rasmus Højlund for more than a month The club did not have any Danish ‘øs’ in stock, so were unable to sell the shirt to fans United insist that the ‘øs’ arrived on Thursday and added that the shirts are now on sale Your browser does not support iframes.

Dementia fund ‘an insult’ The announcement of a new dementia fund last week received a favourable response across football. However, not everyone believes that the move, led by the Premier League and Professional Footballers’ Association, goes far enough. An initial £1m has been made available to help former players and their families who are struggling with neurodegenerative diseases and will include payments for care home costs. The fund, one of the demands in the Daily Mail’s ‘Enough is Enough’ campaign, is meant to provide support while a new charity is set up to act as a long-term vehicle and was described by Maheta Molango, chief executive of the PFA, as ‘an important step forward’. But John Stiles, son of World Cup winner Nobby who passed away having suffered from dementia in 2020, is not impressed. Stiles, a key voice in Mail Sport’s drive, has written to both Molango and Premier League chief exec Richard Masters. He says he is ‘sickened to see that a mere £1m has been allocated to the interim fund’ and describes the sum as ‘desultory and an insult to the players and their families dead and dying’. Stiles fears the fund is a ‘cheap and nasty deal’, adding it is ‘not good enough’. Nobby Stiles suffered from dementia and his son, John, has written to Premier League CEO Richard Masters over the dementia fund Becks turns to one of his own David Beckham has turned to one of his own to help Salford City - the club he co-owns with a number of fellow Class of 92 stars.

In-game interview plot In-game interviews with Premier League stars could soon become commonplace if broadcasters get their way. International partners have told league bosses they want them to improve access while matches are taking place and have made a number of proposals that they want to be part of the deal for the next cycle of rights. Alongside cameras in dressing rooms, broadcasters want to be able to speak to players moments after they have been substituted, in a move they feel will greatly enhance coverage. In theory, clubs would have to provide a player to speak from the bench on a set number of occasions with the hope that viewers would hear from someone who has made a match-changing contribution. The prospect received a lukewarm response, Agenda understands, when it was relayed to clubs last week. Clubs would have to provide a player to speak from the bench on a set number of occasions as broadcasters want in-game interviews to become commonplace London law firm to launch specialist reputation consultancy Schillings - the renowned London law firm well known for their specialism in defamation - are to launch a new specialist reputation consultancy. However, the company has not got off to the best start. A press release, announcing the birth of the new venture, named Victoria O’Byrne as a founding partner and stated that she was ‘communications director’ at the London 2012 Olympics. That claim may well come as a surprise to the formidable Jackie Brock-Doyle CBE - who actually held that title. Indeed, O’Byrne – who was actually head of media and external affairs for the Olympic Park legacy company - was the comms chief for the NHS’ disastrous Covid Test and Trace operation. But after £35bn of public funds was spent without success that period of her career strangely fails to merit a mention. Cricket likely to be added to 2028 Olympic games There is growing consternation in the United States that cricket will be added to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics at the expense of the national sports of baseball and softball. The decision, following intense negotiations between the IOC and LA28, was expected on Friday but has been delayed. LA28 are fully aware that baseball/softball would be a guaranteed sell-out at the Games and that cricket may struggle to attract stadium audiences. However, the IOC are thought to be desperate to get cricket onto the programme to kick-start an India bid for the 2036 Games. Tapping into the vast Indian market is understood to be high on the IOC’s agenda and could well see baseball/softball marginalised - despite commitment from top league MLB for their best players to participate.

But you get yourself in a bit of a rut, it’s quite hard to get out of. It’s probably the first time in my career where I’ve had two months of struggling. “I’ve put in a lot of work behind the scenes to try and go back to knowing what I can do and that’s win games for England. Thankfully I’ve done that.” After being blown away in Cardiff on Friday, this was an impressive response from England, especially after losing Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes within the space of eight Trent Boult deliveries. In his 100th ODI, the left-arm seamer exploited bowler-friendly conditions after rain had delayed the start time and led to the contest being reduced to 34 overs per side at Southampton and England needed every ounce of their batting depth to dig them out of the perilous position of eight for three. Livingstone strode out at number seven after just 12.1 overs and was strong all around the ground, while he took a particular liking to Tim Southee, with six of his 10 boundaries – nine fours and a six – coming off the New Zealand Test captain. Livingstone recognised he owed a debt of gratitude to Curran, who was a useful foil as he contributed 42 off 35 deliveries before lapping to short third in the final over. “I don’t think consolidation is a word we use in the dressing room,” Livingstone said. “We’ve just got to see what we think is best in that situation. If in doubt, take the aggressive option. “We knew it wasn’t going to be the easiest pitch but it was just about getting to a score we felt we could defend. “My initial role was to just get used to the conditions and bat with Mo and then try and put on a partnership with Sammy. “To have someone like Sam Curran batting at eight in any team in world cricket is pretty nice. Something we pride ourselves on is the depth we’ve got, we’ve got a lot of batting for days like this when things don’t go right up top. “It’s a pretty rare occasion we end up 50 for five because of the quality we’ve got in our team. It’s always nice that when it does happen, you can put your hand up and win a game for England.” New Zealand were going along nicely on 111 for three but Reece Topley’s dismissal of captain Tom Latham induced a collapse, which saw the Black Caps lose their last seven wickets for 36 runs in 39 balls. Topley, whose dismissal of Latham was his first wicket in five ODIs, then snared middle-order duo Glenn Phillips and Rachin Ravindra in his next over to finish with three for 27 in seven impressive overs. Daryl Mitchell, whose brutal unbeaten ton set up an eight-wicket win at Sophia Gardens, overturned being given out on nought to bludgeon 57 off 52 balls. But he became Moeen Ali’s 100th ODI wicket which saw New Zealand slide quickly to defeat in the second of four matches as they were all out in 26.5 overs. “I thought our bowlers were exceptional,” Livingstone added. “They learnt from how New Zealand bowled and pretty much nailed the game plan.”","pubDate":"2023-09-10 20:19:46","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17211807/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"24c988ad8c4b6f8d8e416582e5001e90","title":"Liam Livingstone makes innings he was ‘crying out for’ as England level series","link":"https://www.times-series.co.uk/sport/national/23780058.liam-livingstone-makes-innings-crying-for-england-level-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The all-rounder scored an unbeaten 95 as England drew level in their ODI series against New Zealand","content":"England stumbled to 55 for five at the Ageas Bowl but were bailed out by Livingstone, who shared a restorative 48-run stand with Moeen Ali before putting on a decisive 112 in 77 balls with Sam Curran.

Livingstone (95no off 78 balls) hit his highest score in ODIs to help the hosts to overcome a top-order collapse on Sunday (Monday AEST) and set New Zealand a target of 227 in 34 overs, after persistent rain had shortened the match and delayed the toss. \"It wasn't quite a rescue mission. We pride ourselves on our depth,\" said Livingstone, who also scored 52 in the first ODI in Cardiff. \"Lean couple of months but the other day in Cardiff did me a world of good. I just needed one innings.\" New Zealand started their chase poorly, losing opener Finn Allen in the second ball of their innings, and wickets continued to fall at a steady pace as David Willey (3-34) and Reece Topley (3-27) took three apiece. The visitors' main source of runs was again Daryl Mitchell (57), who added a half-century to his ton from the first ODI, but once he departed after holing out to mid-off, there was little New Zealand could do as they were bowled out with eight overs remaining. Put in to bat earlier on Sunday, England were left reeling at 4-28 in the eighth over as Trent Boult ripped through their top order, taking the wickets of Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes. Captain Jos Buttler (30) and Moeen Ali (33) did well to steady the ship, before Livingstone combined for a 112-run partnership with Sam Curran to rescue England and power them to a competitive total at the Rose Bowl. \"Delighted, from the position we found ourselves in, it's a credit to the way we want to play. It was a fantastic partnership,\" Buttler said. \"Livingstone and Curran at seven and eight are within their rights to want to bat higher up. Great start for us with the ball and we carried that on throughout the whole bowling innings.\" The third ODI of the four-match series will be played at The Oval on Wednesday. The series is crucial for both sides' preparations as they look ahead to next month's World Cup in India.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 19:22:23","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11862353/944851f6d3f263826180d04ad691b5ce832651bb-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"af6e8deb280ef9a013d6b904d41f022b","title":"Liam Livingstone leads recovery as England beat New Zealand to level ODI series","link":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/national/23780024.liam-livingstone-leads-recovery-england-beat-new-zealand-level-odi-series/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"David Willey and Reece Topley both took three wickets as New Zealand were beaten by 79 runs.","content":"England were reeling on eight for three after Trent Boult expertly exploited bowler-friendly conditions early on, while the hosts lurched to 55 for five before being bailed out by Livingstone and Sam Curran. The pair put on 112 for the seventh wicket in 77 balls, the cornerstone of England’s 226 for seven in a 34-over contest, enough to secure a 79-run win as Reece Topley and David Willey took three wickets each. England draw level in the series after an incredible fightback 🙌 | 📝: — ICC (@ICC) After being blown away in Cardiff on Friday, this was an impressive response from England, especially after losing Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes within the space of eight deliveries from Boult after they were asked to bat first in overcast conditions. Livingstone, who registered his first fifty of the summer in the Welsh capital, was fluent all around the ground at Southampton in what was remarkably his first innings of 50 or more deliveries in an innings for England, while Sam Curran, with 42 off 35 balls, proved a capable foil. Despite being without Adil Rashid because of mild calf tightness – with three and a half weeks until the start of their World Cup campaign in India, England insisted his absence was precautionary – Jos Buttler’s side showed more of a cutting edge with the ball than they had done in the series opener. After rain led to a three-hour delay and a shortened contest, Boult wreaked havoc in his first ODI in a year in an opening spell of 3-1-3-3, first squaring up Bairstow, whose leading edge on another day might have landed safely but on this occasion was superbly plucked one-handed out the air by Mitchell Santner. Root was beaten by a fuller inswinging delivery two balls later and given lbw, wisely declining a review as the Yorkshireman trudged off for his fourth duck in his last 10 ODIs, while Boult followed up a double wicket maiden by snaring an advancing Stokes, who clothed the left-armer to mid-off. Buttler briefly rallied, offsetting Boult’s rhythm with three fours of varying quality down the ground in an over yielding 15, but England’s early luck was encapsulated by their captain dragging a Santner long hop on to his leg stump for 30 off 25 balls. Santner clenched his teeth at his fortune. England were in a tailspin after 12.1 overs as Livingstone joined Moeen Ali, who drove lustily in a 48-run rebuilding job before expertly slog sweeping Rachin Ravindra for the first six. Moeen departed for 33, the ball after taking England to 100, slashing ungainly at Tim Southee as Glenn Phillips took a fine grab. From 55-5 to 226-7 👏 Livingstone 🤝 Curran Catch up on our innings here 👇 — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Livingstone enjoyed facing up to Southee, with six of his nine fours coming off the seamer, including three in an over – two through power and one via careful placement. Curran proved a more than handy ally, heaving spin duo Ravindra and Santner for sixes, while Livingstone, who got the benefit of the doubt after missing a big hit at Phillips as a review showed the ball would only have trimmed leg stump, rocked back and pulled mightily into the stands off Matt Henry. Livingstone was unable to convert a fine innings into three figures, with Curran departing in the final over after lapping to short third to end their stand. Willey struck with the second ball of New Zealand’s reply, snaking through the defences of Finn Allen and knocking back middle stump while Devon Conway, an unbeaten centurion in Cardiff, made a scratchy 14 before driving loosely and edging behind to give Gus Atkinson his maiden ODI wicket. FIRST ODI WICKET! ☝️ A brilliant bit of bowling from Gus Atkinson 💥 | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Mitchell overturned being given out on nought but Will Young was stopped on his tracks on 33 by Willey’s direct hit. Topley then followed up a parsimonious opening five-over spell by ending a 56-run union between Mitchell and New Zealand captain Tom Latham, who hung his bat out uncertainly and edged behind to Buttler. Having claimed his first wicket in five ODIs, Topley swung the game in England’s favour in his next over by taking a return catch off Phillips before Ravindra wafted to slip two balls later. Topley finished with impressive figures of three for 27 in seven overs. Mitchell, as he had done at Sophia Gardens in a brutal unbeaten hundred, bristled with intent and after going to 50 at just better than a run-a-ball, he launched Moeen back over his head for six. However, he perished for 57 off 52 deliveries after clubbing a full toss to mid-off from the very next ball. New Zealand’s hopes vanished with his departure and Willey claimed the last two wickets in quick succession as the tourists were all out for 147 in 26.5 overs.","pubDate":"2023-09-10 19:06:10","image_url":"https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17212024/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"andoveradvertiser","source_priority":6475270,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"9e7f4f091226e7d51c46f5456338e459","title":"Vishwa Fernando: Durham sign Sri Lanka seamer for County Championship run-in","link":"https://www.dailymirror.lk/cricket/Vishwa-Fernando:-Durham-sign-Sri-Lanka-seamer-for-County-Championship-run-in/315-266996","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Durham have signed Sri Lanka international seamer Vishwa Fernando for their final two County Championship matches of the season.","content":"Durham have signed Sri Lanka international seamer Vishwa Fernando for their final two County Championship matches of the season.
