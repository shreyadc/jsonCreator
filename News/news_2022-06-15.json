The 27-year-old walked off the field late on day three during England's first innings and played no part in their run chase on Tuesday as a Jonny Bairstow century powered the hosts to a five-wicket win for a 2-0 lead in the series. \"Jamieson will return home to New Zealand after an MRI scan revealed a stress-reaction to his lower left back,\" NZC said in a statement. \"Coach Gary Stead expected he would require four to six weeks of rest before beginning a rehabilitation program targeting a potential return to play in September or October.\" Jamieson has been a key figure for the Black Caps, picking up 72 wickets in 16 matches since making his debut two years ago. Blair Tickner, who is uncapped at test level, has been called up as his replacement. New Zealand's backup wicket-keeper Cam Fletcher has also been ruled out of the tour due to a hamstring strain, with Dane Cleaver coming into the squad. The third test gets underway at Headingley on June 23.

Windward Islands Women started the season well, but were unable to maintain momentum and have since lost three games in a row. Pearl Etienne and Afy Fletcher have done well for them, but they don't have anyone else's backing. Guyana Women, on the other hand, are struggling in the competition but earned a much-needed win in their previous game.

With the year 2022 about to touch its halfway mark, it is an apt time to analyse which batters have called the shots in the best possible manner this year especially in Test cricket. England, who have already played seven Tests this year, have three out of the Top Five highest run-scorers in the form in 2022. While it is no surprise that Australia batter Usman Khawaja continues to enjoy the top spot after making an outstanding Test comeback last summer, Bangladesh wicket-keeper batter Liton Das at the third spot also speaks highly about the kind of year he’s had with respect to red-ball cricket. With England scheduled to play five more Test matches this summer, expect more players from their setup dominating the charts across divisions. The same will provide enough opportunities to in-form batters namely Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes to further strengthen their positions in the below mentioned list. This has got to be one of the greatest free tickets in the history of sport. What an extraordinary feat from Bairstow and Stokes. — Richard Osman (@richardosman) June 14, 2022 Having scored three Test centuries this year, Bairstow already has the second-highest number of centuries in 2022. However, he has really benefited from playing a titular role in recording the highest successful run chase at Trent Bridge against New Zealand on Tuesday. As far as Indian cricketers are concerned, their highest Test run-scorer in 2022 is wicket-keeper batter Rishabh Pant (329) followed by the likes of Ravindra Jadeja (201), Virat Kohli (189), Shreyas Iyer (186) and Hanuma Vihari (184).

Houghton, 64, will start next month when Zimbabwe host the T20 World Cup qualifiers. Predecessor Lalchand Rajput, a former India international, moved to the role of technical director in what Zimbabwe Cricket called a \"reshuffle\" of its coaching team. Houghton will be assisted by former South Africa international Lance Klusener, who will return to the post of batting coach that he filled from 2016-18. Klusener had been Afghanistan's head coach until the end of last year. Houghton is tasked with turning around Zimbabwe's dwindling fortunes. His appointment came on the day Zimbabwe lost another match, to Afghanistan by 35 runs in a T20 in Harare. That completed a clean sweep of all six limited-overs games for the tourists. Teenage left-arm spinner Noor Ahmad took 4-10 on his international debut. The 17-year-old Ahmad was pivotal as Zimbabwe was restricted to 9-90 in 20 overs chasing Afghanistan's modest 8-125. Afghanistan thus added a 3-0 T20 series win to a 3-0 victory in the one-day internationals. \"We are delighted to be bringing in Dave and we count ourselves fortunate and privileged to be able to appoint such a vastly experienced and highly respected Head Coach at a time we are looking to improve our on-field performances,\" said Zimbabwe Cricket Director of Cricket Hamilton Masakadza. Houghton is a legendary figure in the country's cricket, captaining the first Zimbabwe test side and scoring 121 in that match against India in Harare in 1992/93.

While Bairstow admitted to having treated the recently concluded Day 5 of the second England vs New Zealand Test match as a “one-day game”, his stroke-filled ninth Test century made it look like a T20 fixture. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the 16th over with his team needing 243 runs in 64.4 overs, Bairstow and captain Ben Stokes’ match-winning 121-ball 179-run fifth-wicket partnership powered England to a victory with 22 overs remaining in the day.

Just one of those things, when you get in that kind of mood, you just got to go with it. We know the power we’ve got in the middle order. Today was our day, and what a day it’s been. Thanks so much for coming [to a packed house in Nottingham]. We saw it as a one-day game,” Bairstow told Sky Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony. Jonny Bairstow shares diet during tea break on Day 5 of Trent Bridge Test Perhaps taking inspiration from head coach Brendon McCullum, who holds the record for fastest Test century, Bairstow scored a second-fastest century for an English batter to win his fourth match award (after four years) in 85 Tests. @englandcricket!!! — Kate Cross (@katecross16) June 14, 2022 “The brand of cricket we’re looking to play, days like these are very exciting. If this is happening now, let’s see what will happen in the next few months. It’s going to be a journey. Sky is the limit,” Bairstow said. In what was Bairstow’s third century of 2022, he particularly attacked the Kiwi bowlers in the evening session scoring 93 (44) post the tea break. “Cheese and ham toastie and a coffee,” Bairstow answered about his meal during the tea break and hilariously vowed to repeat it for the rest of his career.

However, with a rare bilateral limited Overs series loss at home on the cards, the Rishabh Pant-led side did bounce back in some style, with a resounding 48-run victory in the third T20I at Vishakhapatnam. With a couple of more victories required to seal the series, action would now shift towards the Western part of the country – at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot, Gujarat, where both the teams would face each other on June 17 (Friday).

Rajkot Cricket Stadium pitch report With 153 being the lowest score in the three T20Is at this venue so far, expect another high scoring contest at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium between these two sides on Friday. As far as the pitch condition is concerned, the one at Rajkot is highly likely to be a flat one, with a score in excess of the 180-run mark a necessity for the bowlers to defend.

Chasing a 180-run target, all South Africa could manage was 131/10 in 19.1 overs. While several South African batters got to individual starts, none of them could convert his innings into a substantial one much like the first two matches. More than their batting, the Indian bowling stood tall on its potential at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. Captain Rishabh Pant (4) judiciously using spinner Yuzvendra Chahal resulted in him dismissing key middle-order batters namely Rassie van der Dussen (1), Dwaine Pretorius (20) and Heinrich Klaasen (29) giving away just 20 runs in the process. Post match scenes: pic.twitter.com/8uFLmesIHV — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) June 14, 2022 South Africa, who constantly lost wickets after the powerplay, weren’t in an ideal position to move towards a formidable target. While Harshal Patel was the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of 3.1-0-25-4, Chahal was awarded with his fourth T20I match award – first in two years. “I bowled a lot of sliders and bowled quicker in the previous matches. Today, I changed my seam position. Spinning and getting the ball to dip are my strengths. Today I tried to get it to turn and bowl slower. When batters try to reverse-sweep, it becomes tough for the bowlers. But now I have a second plan and set fields accordingly,” Chahal told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony.","pubDate":"2022-06-14 17:28:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket - Chahal, Harshal power India to convincing T20 win over South Africa","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/15/cricket---chahal-harshal-power-india-to-convincing-t20-win-over-south-africa","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MUMBAI, India (Reuters) - Legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal and seamer Harshal Patel helped India to a convincing 48-run win over South Africa in the third Twenty20 International at Visakhapatnam on Tuesday to keep the hosts' hopes of success alive in the five-match series.

On ‘Day 5’ of the second Test match between England and New Zealand at the Trent Bridge in Nottingham, scintillating knocks from wicket-keeper batter Jonny Bairstow (136) and skipper Ben Stokes (75*) paved way for a record five-wicket win for the England side, as they take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Handed a target of 299 runs with 72 Overs yet to be bowled in the final day, England were in no mood to mere play out the Overs, and went for the target right away with the Southpaw batter Alex Lees (44) commencing the chase with a handful of boundaries. They were in a spot of bother after their best batter Joe Root (3) headed back to the pavilion after a rare single digit score under his belt, during the 16th Over of the chase itself. However, with 160 runs required off the final session and six wickets in the bank, Jonny Bairstow decided to unleash his beast mode to smash the second-fastest Test century by an English batter, and stitched a 179-run stand alongside Stokes for the 5th wicket at 8.87 runs per Over, to chase down these runs within mere 16 Overs into the session. Bairstow, for his phenomenal ton at the strike rate of 147.83 was awarded the ‘Player of the Match’. England wicket-keeper batter Jos Buttler, took to his social media handle to hail and congratulate the team under the new skipper Ben Stokes, as the latter seals a Test series victory in only his maiden appearance as full time skipper in the longest format.

It was a 179-run match-winning fifth-wicket partnership between Bairstow (136) and captain Ben Stokes (75*) which powered England to a victory on Tuesday. In spite of injuring his ankle while batting, Stokes continued in the middle hitting 10 fours and four sixes at a strike rate of 107.14 spoke highly of his temperament.

Well, he didn't stop after the 100, he kept on going, and added 36 more runs to his tally before getting out to delivery by Boult. The fact that he played at a strike rate of 147 odd in a test match speaks volumes of the importance of this inning. He didn't just hit the 2nd fastest 100 by an Englishman, but the context of the game when he arrived and how he took it upon himself to do what he ultimately did says a lot about Bairstow's character and influence on the eventual outcome of the match. No doubt, Bairstow played one of the greatest match-turning knocks in test cricket, and this one, will be remembered for a long time. Let's name it the Barstow Bashing at Trent Bridge.","pubDate":"2022-06-14

बड़े स्टार","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/wwe/wwe-superstars-could-return-to-money-in-the-bank-2022-2146256","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WWE ने अपने अगले पीपीवी Money in the Bank 2022 को लेकर तैयारी शुरू कर दी है. ये WWE के सबसे बड़े शो में से एक हैं. ऐसे में WWE किसी भी तरह की कोई भी कमी नहीं छोड़ना चाहती है. इस इवेंट में फैंस को &nbsp;कई सिंगल्स और टैग टीम मैचों के अलावा मनी इन द बैंक (Money in the Bank) लैडर मैच देखने को मिलेगा. इसके अलवा WWE इस इवेंट को और ज्यादा रोमांचक बनाने के लिए WWE कुछ बड़े सरप्राइज भी प्लान करके बैठा है. तो आइये जानते हैं कि Money in the Bank 2022 इवेंट में कौन से स्टार्स वापसी कर सकते हैं:&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>शार्लेट फ्लेयर</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">शार्लेट फ्लेयर काफी समय से इन रिंग एक्शन से दूर हैं. उन्होने अपना आखिरी मुकाबला &nbsp;WrestleMania Backlash में लड़ा था. इस दौरान उन्हें रोंडा राउजी के खिलाफ SmackDown विमेंस चैंपियनशिप मैच में हार का सामना करना पड़ा था. ऐसे में अब जब वो अपनी शादी और हनीमून से भी वापसी आ गई तो फैंस उनकी वापसी का बेसब्री से इंतजार कर रहे हैं. उन्हें अभी तक उनके टाइटल मैच का रिमैच नहीं मिला है. ऐसे में वो Money in the Bank पीपीवी में आ कर इस मैच की बी डिमांड कर सकती हैं.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>रैंडी ऑर्टन</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">रैंडी इस समय बैक इंजरी की वजह से इन रिंग एक्शन से दूर हैं. इसके अलावा WWE उन्हें Summerslam पीपीवी इवेंट में बुक करना चाहती है. ऐसे में उनके लिए Money in the Bank में वापसी करना सबसे बेहतर रहेगा. जहां पर वो रोमन रेंस या फिर उसोज पर हमला कर सकते है. उनके इस हमले के बाद उनके और रोमन रेंस के बीच फ्यूड शुरू हो सकता है. जिसे WWE समरस्लैम में बुक कर सकता है.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>ब्रॉक लैसनर</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ब्रॉक लैसनर इस समय भी WWE के सबसे बाद स्टार है. उनका होना किसी भी इवेंट को और ज्यादा यादगार बना सकता है. वो आखिरी बार &nbsp;WrestleMania 38 इवेंट में नजर आए थे. ऐसे में अगर &nbsp;WWE Money in the Bank को यादगार बनाना चाहती हैं तो वो लैसनर को भी इस मैच में बुक कर सकते हैं.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align:

जगन्नाथ की रथयात्रा शुरू होगी. इस यात्रा से पहले हिंदू और मुस्लिम समुदाय के खिलाड़ी साथ में टीम बनाकर संवेदनशील जगहों पर क्रिकेट मैच खेलेंगे. दरअसल, ऐसा इसलिए किया जा रहा है कि दोनों समुदायों के बीच सामाजिक सौहार्द स्थापित हो. अहमदाबाद पुलिस के मुताबिक, भगवान जगन्नाथ की रथयात्रा के रास्ते में पड़ने वाले संवेदनशील इलाकों के लोगों को मिलाकर क्रिकेट टीम बनाई जाएगी.</p> <p style=\"text-align:

चाहती है. दरअसल, हाल ही में पैंगबर मोहम्मद के खिलाफ कथित टिप्पणी को लेकर देश में माहौल तनावपूर्ण बना हुआ है. इस वजह से सामाजिक सौहार्द को बनाये रखना पुलिस के लिए बड़ी चुनौती है.</p> <p

से मैच खेलेंगे. दरअसल, पुलिस दोनों समुदायों के बीच मैच के जरिए सामाजिक सौहार्द, सहयोग की भावना बेहतर बनाने के अलावा शांति स्थापित करने की कोशिश कर रही है.</p> <p style=\"text-align:

England have now lead the three-match series 2-0 with one to play after what Nasser Hussain described one of their “best-ever Test wins”. Bairstow marmalised the tourists’ attack – missing Kyle Jamieson through injury – with 14 fours and SEVEN sixes in a sensational display of hitting.

Alex Lees exploded out of the blocks, but could only watch on as Ollie Pope (18) and, crucially, Joe Root (three) fell in quick succession. The opener himself later fell for 44 with England 93-4, still needing over 200 runs to win at a rate of over 4.5 per over. But Bairstow and Stokes combined for a ludicrous partnership of 179, with the assault after the tea break utter scintillating.

The No5 missed out on the fastest century by an England batsman by a single ball. Gilbert Jessop still holds the record with a 76-ball on in 1902 – with coach Brendon McCullum the world-record holder after smashing a 54-ball ton in his last-ever Test. Bairstow eventually fell after being caught behind 27 runs shy of victory. He was given a fully-deserved standing ovation from the packed Trent Bridge crowd. England understandably slowed down after Bairstow’s dismissal but ultimately cruised past their target of 299 with time to spare for the loss of just five wickets with Ben Foakes and Stokes at the crease.
