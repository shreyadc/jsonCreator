The star fullback suffered what was thought to be a season-ending shoulder injury in round 11, but two weeks ago declared his rehab was going well and he was eyeing a shock return before year's end. But Manly will now tell Turbo to just concentrate on getting himself right for 2023.

One of the game's genuine match-winners, Trbojevic was superb last season, winning the Dally M Medal, and started this year strongly before his shoulder was dislocated in an awkward tackle. The most talked about player in rugby league this week - young Panthers utility Jaeman Salmon - is in danger of being lost to the club at the end of the season. But his likely exit has nothing to do with Ricky Stuart's epic spray in the press conference after Penrith's win over Canberra. Stream the NRL premiership 2022 live and free on 9Now It all comes down to opportunity - like Sean O'Sullivan, Salmon has had a frustrating time playing behind the Panthers' gun halves Nathan Cleary and Jarome Luai. O'Sullivan saw the writing on the wall and signed with the Dolphins for next year, while Salmon is a free agent and has been in talks with at least one rival Sydney-based club. Tigers fans are probably feeling nervous after star signing Isaiah Papali'i appeared to consider back-tracking on his deal to join the club in media interviews on Monday. \"I've got a season to finish off and then I can worry about all that after,\" he said. \"When it does come time to have that talk (with the Tigers), we'll definitely have that talk behind the scenes.\" But the Tigers are prepared to play hardball to ensure Papali'i honours the deal he signed, which has been registered with the NRL. The club has let three backrowers go for next season to be able to afford Papali'i and if he doesn't come, their pack will be a shambles. For that reason alone, the Tigers won't even consider releasing the powerhouse forward. There's been plenty of talk linking former Eels tryscoring sensation Bevan French to Newcastle next season, but Wigan won't let the speedy utility go without a fight. French wants to return to Australia after four years in England where he has proved himself a fan favourite. Last month, he set a new Super League record by scoring seven tries during a 60-0 win over Hull FC. Wigan will throw more money at French than the Knights are prepared to pay, leaving him with the old dilemma - money or happiness.

New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >It was symbolic of the lasting impact a visit like this can have, as Boland — himself only the second Aboriginal man to play Test cricket in 140 years — took the ICC Twenty20 World Cup trophy held by Australia, to boys and girls who must become part of cricket’s future.“I think it’s the best way we can grow the game. There’s so many opportunities to grow the game in communities like this when you come out here and there are kids who probably haven’t played that much cricket in their life,” Boland told News Corp.“The kids were smacking balls into the bushes and I spoke to a couple of the kids and they said they had a great day.“If they started enjoying it just from the little interactions we had today and then take it back to school and play with their friends, that’s the best way we can build cricket in different parts of Australia.“Helping someone who doesn’t have any interest in cricket at the start, learn to enjoy the game, there’s real satisfaction in that.“I’m sure there would be heaps of Aboriginal girls and boys playing tennis because of Ash Barty, and hopefully I can be the same and help keep growing cricket and encourage more boys and girls to play our great game.”Uluru is a family name rather than a geographical site, and Boland sat with family elders on Tuesday to hear their story or “Tjukurpa” — which translates in English to behaviours to live by.The elders emphasised how they do not dwell on the past, but focus on the future — and although it might seem quite a leap for a man with a Test bowling average of 8 to not look back, the message struck a real chord for three-Test hero Boland.“It’s a pretty good lesson for me and something I should do more and focus on what’s ahead,” said Boland.“Because if you get stuck in the past you can get chewed up pretty quickly.”Australian cricket great Shane Watson and his nine-year-old son Will — a huge Boland fan — also made the journey to Uluru as the ICC men’s Twenty20 World Cup trophy makes its pilgrimage around the country before Australia kicks off its campaign on October 22 at the SCG against New Zealand, with tickets already on sale.Watson said Boland’s extraordinary story was an inspiration, but also a challenge to the game to do better.“It’s sad in a way that there are still a number of parts of Australia where cricket’s not really played,” Watson said.“It’s extremely disappointing that cricket hasn’t been able to really venture into Indigenous communities. We see the incredible athletes in the AFL and NRL, and it’s shocking to hear that only two men (Boland and Jason Gillespie) with Indigenous background have played Test cricket for Australia.“Being here at Uluru with Scott, knowing his heritage, it’s very special to be able to share that experience with him.“That’s the beauty of the tour, to bring the World Cup trophy which the Aussies are defending champions, to areas where cricket isn’t necessarily played and spread the game of cricket.”Boland only discovered his Aboriginal ancestry in his young 20s but the way he has embraced it is an inspiration to thousands of kids and families around Australia, according to Nyangatjara College teacher, Mel Hargraves.“I think it’s so great that he’s owning it and celebrating it because there was a lot of oppression — people didn’t speak about it, and his own family didn’t really speak about it,” said Hargraves.“Everyone goes on about how everyone is ‘claiming it’ (Aboriginality) so they can do this and that, but they’re not talking about the people who are either ashamed of it or can’t speak up because of their families. I think he is setting a really good example of positively embracing his history and identifying.“The community here are big AFL fanatics, so it’s huge for successful Indigenous sports people to come here from other codes, because you just never know, you just might expose someone to something where they go, ‘wow.’“Scott has donated all his gear here which the kids will love.”","pubDate":"2022-08-09 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Here's list of top 5 run-scorers and wicket-takers in history of Asia Cup","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/here-s-list-of-top-5-run-scorers-and-wicket-takers-in-history-of-asia-cup-2022-08-09-798741","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Asia Cup is one of the prestigious tournaments in the world of cricket which started back in 1984.

With cricket being played around the year, Rohit feels having a solid bench strength is paramount. Since their shock group-stage elimination in the last T20 World Cup, India have been experimenting with their squads, with injury and workload management also playing a part in it. \"We play a lot of cricket, so there will be injuries and workload management, so we have to rotate players,\" Rohit said on the Star Sports show 'Follow the Blues'. \"But it gives our bench strength to go and play the game, which is why we could try so many other guys who are ready to take that international stage and perform,\" he added. \"We want to create our bench strength, we want to make sure that India's future is in safe hands. That's the plan that we are trying to have.\" Rohit is now gearing up to lead India in the upcoming edition of the T20 showpiece in Australia, but before that, they have the Asia Cup to deal with. He said the objective should be to get better as a team every day. \"I don't know what next to expect but for me particularly, it's just about getting better every day as a team,\" said Rohit. \"No matter if you win or lose the series, that cannot take priority. What should take priority is if we are getting better as a team. \"The team's goal is important and then obviously parts in it where the individuals come into play and play the role in the team's success. But whatever the team is trying to do, the individuals need to buy into that thought process and work towards that direction.\" While Rohit succeeded Virat Kohli as India's all-format captain, India also had a new coach at the end of last year's T20 World Cup, with Ravi Shastri making way for Rahul Dravid, who was the captain when Rohit made his ODI debut. Rohit spoke about the conversations they have had since taking over the reins of the Indian cricket team. \"When he became the coach here, we met and sat together in a room for a while and decided how we want to take this team forward,\" Rohit said. \"He was pretty much on the same thought process as me. That made it easier for me to give out a clear message to the boys because the coach and captain always need to be on the same page for the team to move in the same direction. \"One thing we have decided and have in common is we want to send the right messages and we don't want to create any confusion in the group. \"That's something we spoke about and of course, we wanted to change the style of cricket as well. We wanted to play in a certain way in all three formats and he was ready to accept all of that,\" Rohit said.

After yet another successful Ranji Trophy season post the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the Madhya Pradesh side lift the coveted trophy for the first time in the tournament’s history, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the schedule for the 2022-23 season of its premier longest format tournament on Monday. The upcoming domestic season is scheduled to commence from December 13. with the grand finale scheduled to take place on February 20, 2023. However, differing from the status quo this time around, the apex board has decided that there would be two winners – one from the elite group and the other from the plate group. The rationale for the change is to avoid mismatch in terms of quality between the sides during the knock-out stage, as was case during Jharkhand versus Nagaland pre-quarter-final of the Ranji Trophy this year. The development has meant that unlike the previous seasons, where all of the 38 domestic sides battled it out for one title each year, the upcoming season starting December this year, would witness two Ranji Trophy sides being crowned as the winners. This means that the topper from the plate group will not be crossing over to take on an elite group team for a pre-quarter final match as it used to be earlier, as they would play a tournament of their own. Instead, the six Plate group teams will play each other once, after which the top-4 sides would qualify for the semi-finals. The two finalists will be promoted to the Elite group in the 2023-24 season. As for the Elites, the 32 teams will be divided into four groups of eight teams each. After each side plays against the seven other teams in their respective groups, top-two teams will directly qualify for the quarter-final stage. Also, the bottom-two teams from all the four elite groups combined, based on points and quotient, will be relegated to plate group next season.","pubDate":"2022-08-09 17:40:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I am playing only one format: Shikhar Dhawan opens up on his future in Indian cricket team","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/i-am-playing-only-one-format-shikhar-dhawan-opens-up-on-his-future-in-indian-cricket-team-2495426.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Dhawan will soon be leading India in an away series in Zimbabwe, and is also likely to lead against South Africa at home in October, when the first team will be off to Australia for the T20 World Cup.","content":"Behind Shikhar Dhawan’s cheerful exterior lies an intensely “spiritual man” who has made peace with representing India in only one format. Approaching his 37th birthday, Dhawan has made a pledge to himself. “Till the time I am playing for India, I would like to be an asset and not a liability,” Dhawan told PTI in an exclusive interaction after leading India to an ODI series victory in the West Indies. From the start of 2020 till the end of West Indies series, Dhawan has played 22 ODIs and scored 975 runs with 10 half-centuries, the highest by an Indian batter by a distance. “I am a calm, matured person. The performance is a reflection of my experience,” Dhawan said when he was reminded of his phenomenal numbers. Shikhar Dhawan said (in PTI)\"I have very good bond with Rohit Sharma. I speak to Rohit as he is the main leader. So when it comes to continuity, you need to discuss and consult with him\". pic.twitter.com/6Y4xAE1f2Z — Rohit Sharma Fanclub India (@Imro_fanclub) August 9, 2022 “My basics have been pretty strong and I have put in a lot of work to improve my technique. Understanding a format is also very important. I understand the dynamics of ODI format and that has helped me a lot,” he added when probed further. So what is the process to remain consistent in ODIs at a time when bilateral T20Is are gaining precedence. Besides, there is also considerable gap between two 50-over series? “I never let this feeling creep into my system that “Oh God, I am playing only one format or I am playing an ODI series after a long time. Will my body respond well to the rigours of international cricket or will it not? Frankly speaking, I don’t like entertaining these thoughts,” the senior opener gave a peek into his thought process. “I view it like this. If I am playing a format after a gap of two months or three months, it always gives me a chance to remain fresh and come into battle fully fit, and with enough time to work on my game.” For Dhawan, it is important to value what he has rather than cribbing about what he doesn’t. “I am always counting my blessings and if I am playing one format for India, I should try and make the most of it and give it my all. I am a very positive person. You won’t find a negative bone in my body,” he smiled. Dhawan feels that fitness wise, he is getting better with age. “I think now, at 36, I am fitter than ever before and also skill-wise, I have gotten better. Gym sessions, skill sessions, running and yoga, these four things are core aspects of my training,” he added. Of late, Dhawan hasn’t played red ball cricket at first-class level and does get a lot of time apart from the IPL, where he is able to work on his game, something that has really helped him. “When I am not playing matches, I train at my own academy in Gurgaon. I mostly do my net sessions there. I try and hire some quality net bowlers. Also in and around Gurgaon, you have some good facilities and a lot of net bowlers who are ready to come and bowl to you.” “As a leader, you need to get best out of people with a smile” Dhawan will soon be leading India in an away series in Zimbabwe, and is also likely to lead against South Africa at home in October, when the first team will be off to Australia for the T20 World Cup. While he completely understands that it is a makeshift role, the veteran of 155 ODIs with nearly 6500 runs is enjoying every moment of it. “As a leader, my first instinct is to go with a bowler’s plan. I ask them what’s the plan and what exactly would they want in the fielding set-up. At the highest level, everyone is a hardcore professional, who are there because they know their job well.” He comes into the picture, with his plan B, only when the bowlers have failed to execute their plans. “But yes, if their plan doesn’t work, obviously there needs to be a Plan ‘B’ and me coming into the picture. If a bowler is hit for a few boundaries, he is bound to be under pressure and that’s the time the captain needs to put an arm around his shoulder. But then also politely nudge him that ‘listen your plan isn’t working, so why don’t you try my plan for a change?'” A captain only grows into a role with time as one understands the core principles of man management, so very necessary at the elite level. “As a leader, when you start interacting with players, after a passage of time, you get a fair idea of how they react to situations. “No two players are same and the way you handle each of them will also be different — with some you need to be a slightly lenient, with some you need to be a bit more pushy. That’s the beauty of a leader. You have to give them love and extract the best out of them.” While he understands that he is more of a stand-in captain, Dhawan does communicate with his opening partner and regular skipper, Rohit Sharma, when the latter takes a break. “Obviously, I speak to Rohit as he is the main leader. So when it comes to continuity, you need to discuss and consult with him. Team’s vision is paramount for all of us.” “Have had good communication with Rahul bhai” Head coach Rahul Dravid is big on communication, something that has helped Dhawan in expressing his ideas. “It’s always a two-way street between captain and coach, and same is the case between me and Rahul bhai. Whatever decision is taken is a collective one,” he said. “In meetings, every individual is given freedom to express his opinion and once we get multiple opinion, we come together and decide what’s best. In this way, you empower people to think and at the same time decide what’s best for the team,” he reasoned. Setbacks and spiritualism For Dhawan, “balance on and off the field” is very important, in theory and in practice. “I have been a balanced person all my life. If you look at my career, I played the U-19 World Cup in 2004 where I was the highest scorer. But then, I had to wait for nine years before I made my Test debut (2013, Mohali),” Dhawan recollected his years of wait despite being a heavy scorer in domestic cricket. “From junior India to Test cap, it took me almost a decade and it couldn’t have happened, if I wouldn’t have been patient and remained positive.” In the last four years, he has learnt playing the flute, and in fact, got a lot of traction on social media for his rendition of the Jagjit Singh classic ‘Hothon se chulo tum, mera geet amar kar do’. Playing flute is a stress-buster for him and practising spiritualism after facing some personal setbacks has given his life new meaning. “In my personal life also, I have seen ups and downs, and I have been able to come through those rough times because of spirituality. I listen to the teachings of spiritual gurus like Shivani didi and Gaur Gopal Das. Listening to their teachings brings in a certain sense of calmness in me,” he said. He signed off with his life’s philosophy. “To have a blessed life, you need to have a blessed mind first.”","pubDate":"2022-08-09 17:03:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Last Asia Cup winner: Who had won last season of Asia Cup final in 2018?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-last-asia-cup-winner-who-had-won-last-season-of-asia-cup-final-in-2018/","keywords":["Cricket","asia cup","asia cup 2018"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Last Asia Cup winner 2018: An edition of Asia Cup will kick-start after a long four-year gap later this month.

Asia Cup 2022 will be played between August 27 – September 11 across a couple of venues in the UAE. It will be for the fourth time in the history of Asia Cup that it will be played in the UAE. In what is going to be the 15th edition of the Asia Cup, readers must note that it was originally scheduled to be played in Pakistan. Following several postponements due to COVID-19 pandemic, PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) had swapped hosting rights with SLC (Sri Lanka Cricket). However, the ongoing political turmoil in Sri Lanka forced the administrators to shift Asia Cup 2022 to the UAE. Set to be played after a four-year gap, it will be the third time when Asia Cup will be played after these many years. Two previous similar instances were registered between 1991-1995 and 2000-2004. Additionally, it is noteworthy that it will only be for the second time when an Asia Cup will be played as a T20I competition. Last Asia Cup winner 2018 Table-toppers in Asia Cup 2018 Super Four stage, India and Bangladesh had qualified for the final match of the tournament ahead of Pakistan and Afghanistan four years ago. A comparatively low-scoring thriller had witnessed India sealing a 223-run chase on the last ball of the match. Captain Rohit Sharma’s decision to field first had been followed by his bowlers bundling out Bangladesh for 222 in 48.3 overs. Had it not been for batter Litton Das’ maiden international century, Bangladesh would’ve struggled to even cross the 200-run mark. While several Indian batters achieved personal starts but neither of them could play an archetype big-match innings. The Indian batters not hurrying with respect to the chase had found them in a position where they needed to score 6 runs in the last over with three wickets in hand. All-rounder Kedar Jadhav sneaking a leg-bye as a last-ball finish had powered India to their seventh Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

As per Koerzen’s son and reports from the South African media, the former renowned umpire lost his life in the car crash while driving from Cape Town to Despatch in Eastern Cape in South Africa, where he lived with his family. Along with him, three other people were also fatally injured in a head-on collision near Riversale. Koertzen had officiated in his first international assignment back in the year 1992, and was appointed as a full-time International Cricket Council (ICC) umpire five years later in 1997. Quite a respected figure across Cricket circles, the South African official, officiated in the capacity of an umpire and match referee across a total of 128 Tests, 250 ODIs and 19 T20Is. With a combined 331 matches across formats, Koertzen was only the second umpire after Steve Bucknor, to officiate in more than 200 ODIs and 100 Tests. He had also played the role of the third umpire during the 2003 and 2007 World Cup finals, and decided to bid adieu to his umpiring career in 2010. Renowned figures from the sport took to their respective social media handles to pay their respect to the former South African umpire, minutes after they heard about his unfortunate demise.

Apart from the 74-run stand between Beth and captain Meg Lanning, Australia wasn't allowed to break free as India conceded only 36 runs in the last five overs, taking five scalps. India were splendid in their fielding, making tight stops, taking brilliant catches and effecting terrific run-outs. With the ball, Renuka Thakur and Sneh Rana took two wickets each while Deepti Sharma and Radha Yadav had a wicket apiece. However, chasing a target of 162 India kept losing wickets in the middle after skipper Harmanpreet Kaur scored a brilliant fifty. Ashleigh Gardner and Megan Schutt were top performers for Aussies with the ball. Schutt picked two wickets while Gardner claimed three. Australia were just too good for India as they are now the CWG champions and World Cup champions as well. India were brilliant in the semifinal but the Aussies were a slight better than them in final.","pubDate":"2022-08-09 15:39:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"Would Not Have Gone With...\": Ex-India Captain On India's Asia Cup Squad","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/would-not-have-gone-with-ex-india-captain-on-player-who-could-have-been-excluded-from-asia-cup-squad-3240535","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The much-anticipated Asia Cup cricket tournament will take place from August 27 this year.","content":"Former Indian skipper and ex-chairman of the selection committee Krishnamachari Srikkanth said that had he been the chairman of selectors currently, pacer Mohammed Shami would have been a part of Men in Blue's squad for upcoming Asia Cup 2022, which will take place from August 27 onwards. The All-India Senior Selection Committee on Monday announced the 14-members squad for the upcoming Asia Cup. The much-anticipated Asia Cup cricket tournament will take place from August 27 this year. \"In my team, Shami was literally there. If I was the Chairman of the selection committee, I think Shami would have been there and probably, I would not have gone with Ravi Bishnoi . But I still believe that Axar Patel was a serious contender in my team. It would have been a big toss-up between Axar Patel and Ashwin,\" said Srikkanth during the show 'Follow The Blues' on Star Sports. Srikkanth opines that the squad is good but needs one more medium pacer. He feels bad for Axar Patel, who could not make it to the squad. \"I am very happy for Deepak Hooda - he can bowl a bit, he is a good hitter and he's a good striker of the ball. What I like about Deepak Hooda is that he is a good striker of the ball, he is a flirter. Otherwise, this squad is a fantastic squad, only feel bad for Axar Patel. I still believe that he's a good bowling all-rounder, may be in Australia conditions. I am not going for just the Asia Cup, but yes, this must be a blueprint for the ICC T20 World Cup also,\" he added. Former Indian wicketkeeper and ex-chief of selectors Kiran More also said that the event will be special for Virat Kohli since he needs to make a comeback. \"It has been too many innings. The other batsmen also have been performing really well. Overall, the squad looks good, and well-balanced. There are good all-rounders too - R Ashwin has been batting well. Definitely, Axar Patel has been performing well throughout the year too. I like the team combination and I was really happy with Ravi Bishnoi's selection. It brought a variation to the team. According to me, this is a good team. I am also happy for Arshdeep Singh. He has been performing well in the IPL against West Indies, where he was the Player of the Series and bowled well. We were in search of a left-arm bowler, who we have found in Arshdeep Singh,\" he added. Asia Cup will start from August 27 and end on September 11. The much-anticipated match between India and Pakistan will take place on August 28. The 15th edition of the tournament will be played in the UAE between six teams (main event). Defending champions India are also the most successful team, having won the trophy seven times. While the last edition of the tournament was held in an ODI format, this edition will feature the T20 format. The six teams are divided into two groups with India, Pakistan and a qualifying team in Group A; and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan forming Group B. Each team plays the other once in the group stage with the top two teams from each group advancing to the Super 4 round. The top 2 teams from Super 4 will qualify for the final. India's squad for Asia Cup: Rohit Sharma (Captain), KL Rahul (vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav , Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Dinesh Karthik (wicket-keeper), Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja , R. Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal , Ravi Bishnoi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , Arshdeep Singh and Avesh Khan . Promoted The star pacer of India Jasprit Bumrah and Harshal Patel were not available for selection owing to injuries. They are currently undergoing rehab at the NCA in Bengaluru. Three players - Shreyas Iyer , Axar Patel and Deepak Chahar have been named as standbys.","pubDate":"2022-08-09 15:28:12","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-02/9mdfprp_indian-cricket-team-record-in-t20i_625x300_19_February_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Maybe it could be the reason”: Shikhar Dhawan opines on why he is not part of T20I India team for Asia Cup","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-maybe-it-could-be-the-reason-shikhar-dhawan-opines-on-why-he-is-not-part-of-t20i-india-team-for-asia-cup/","keywords":["Cricket","Asia Cup 2022","Shikhar Dhawan"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shikhar Dhawan opines on the probable reason for his exclusion from team India in the T20I format ahead of the imminent Asia Cup 2022.

A mainstay in team India’s ODI set-up as an opening batter, Shikhar Dhawan, most recently led the side to a dominant 3-0 victory in the three-match ODI series versus the West Indies during the recently concluded tour of the Caribbean. His couple of half-centuries during the first and the last ODIs were instrumental in India’s third consecutive ODI series victory, including clean sweeps against the Windies in both the home and away series. However, having last played a T20I back in July 2021, the Southpaw batter was, along expected lines, not part of the team India squad set to travel to the UAE to partake in the upcoming Asia Cup later this month. During an interaction with the Indian media outlet The Indian Express, Shikhar Dhawan opened up on his views regarding the future of the ODI format, and also on the probable reason(s) on why he is no longer a name to be considered in the T20I set up. When questioned whether is it due to the brand of cricket that he plays wherein he builds up his innings, rather than going for the big hits right from the get-go that is the reason for him not being selected in the shortest format, Dhawan seemed to be uncertain on the same. “I honestly don’t know about it, maybe it could be the reason. I don’t want to go deep about it. I have not played T20 for India for a long time now, I don’t know where I see myself. I look to make the most out of every opportunity I am getting. Be it IPL, domestic cricket, or ODI, I just want to do well, and that is the only thing under my control,” exclaimed Dhawan. The 36-year-old will lead team India yet again during their upcoming tour of Zimbabwe for the three-match ODI series as their next international assignment.","pubDate":"2022-08-09 15:21:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"TBT Sports: Chapples cricket","link":"https://www.tbnewswatch.com/video/tbt-sports/tbt-sports-chapples-cricket-5675450","keywords":null,"creator":["TBnewsWatch.com Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"TBT Sports: Chapples cricket","content":"TBT Sports: Chapples cricket","pubDate":"2022-08-09 15:18:28","image_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57cOtaXjI7E/0.jpg","source_id":"tbnewswatch","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shikhar Dhawan 'positive about playing just one format': 'You won't find a negative bone in my body'","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/shikhar-dhawan-positive-about-playing-just-one-format-you-wont-find-a-negative-bone-in-my-body-757069","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shikhar Dhawan has not played a Test since 2018Dhawan recently captained India in ODIs in West IndiesHe is set to lead India again in Zimbabwe","content":"Dhawan recently captained India in ODIs in West Indies Shikhar Dhawan has said he is \"positive\" about playing just one format for India before adding \"you won't find a negative bone in my body.\" The soon-to-turn 37 years old Dhawan last played a Test in 2018 and a T20I in 2021. Dhawan has captained India in the ODIs quite a few times over the last year or so, with the latest stint being during the tour of the Caribbean. Dhawan led India to a 3-0 win over West Indies and is will lead India once again in their upcoming tour of Zimbabwe, where the Men in Blue are scheduled to play three ODIs. \"I never let this feeling creep into my system that 'Oh God, I am playing only one format or I am playing an ODI series after a long time. Will my body respond well to the rigours of international cricket or will it not?' Frankly speaking, I don't like entertaining these thoughts. \"I view it like this. If I am playing a format after a gap of two months or three months, it always gives me a chance to remain fresh and come into battle fully fit, and with enough time to work on my game,\" Dhawan said in an interview with PTI. For the senior opener, it is important to value what he has rather than complain about what he doesn't. \"I am always counting my blessings and if I am playing one format for India, I should try and make the most of it and give it my all. I am a very positive person. You won't find a negative bone in my body,\" Dhawan smiled. No Indian batsman has scored more runs for India in the 50-over format than Dhawan over the last two years. The opening batter has scored 975 ODI runs since January 2020 and is well ahead of second-placed KL Rahul with 745 runs. Out of form, Virat Kohli is in third place with 735 runs. However, among the said three batsmen, only Rahul has recorded an ODI century in the last two years. \"I am a calm, mature person. The performance is a reflection of my experience. My basics have been pretty strong and I have put in a lot of work to improve my technique. Understanding a format is also very important. I understand the dynamics of the ODI format and that has helped me a lot,\" added Dhawan further. 9 years on, the bond is still strong 💪 @ImRo45 Congratulations to the Team India for the spectacular victory ✌️ #IndVsEng #ODISeries pic.twitter.com/eWiQvCP3zq It is a two-way street between captain and coach, says Dhawan Speaking about working with head coach Rahul Dravid, Dhawan said that he shares great communication with the latter. \"It's always a two-way street between captain and coach, and the same is the case between me and Rahul bhai. Whatever decision is taken is a collective one. In meetings, every individual is given the freedom to express his opinion and once we get multiple opinions, we come together and decide what's best. In this way, you empower people to think and at the same time decide what's best for the team,\" Dhawan added. Dhawan feels that fitness-wise, he is getting better with age. \"I think now, at 36, I am fitter than ever before, and also skill-wise, I have gotten better. Gym sessions, skill sessions, running and yoga, these four things are core aspects of my training,\" the 36-year-old Indian cricketer said further. Dhawan has not played a First-Class game for Delhi in the last three years and therefore gets a lot of time apart from IPL, where he is able to work on his game and that has really worked in his favour. \"When I am not playing matches, I train at my own academy in Gurgaon. I mostly do my net sessions there. I try and hire some quality net bowlers. Also in and around Gurgaon, you have some good facilities and a lot of net bowlers who are ready to come and bowl to you,\" the southpaw added. Who are we?

I ask them what's the plan and what exactly would they want in the fielding set-up. At the highest level, everyone is a hardcore professional, who is there because they know their job well. But yes, if their plan doesn't work, obviously there needs to be a Plan 'B' and me coming into the picture. \"If a bowler is hit for a few boundaries, he is bound to be under pressure and that's the time the captain needs to put an arm around his shoulder. But then also politely nudge him that 'listen your plan isn't working, so why don't you try my plan for a change?\" Dhawan explained.","pubDate":"2022-08-09 14:52:32","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/08/09/500x300_1307164-shikhar-dhawan.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli Asia Cup records: Virat Kohli T20 matches Asia Cup all match list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-virat-kohli-asia-cup-records-virat-kohli-t20-matches-asia-cup-all-match-list/","keywords":["Cricket","asia cup","Asia Cup 2022","India","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli Asia Cup records: The former Indian captain will return to representative cricket with Asia Cup 2022.

English test captain Ben Stokes’ career has been full of highs and lows, and to cricket fans’ delight, a documentary has been made on the same. Stokes took a break due to mental fitness last year, and he suffered a lot of injury setbacks as well. However, he is enjoying a brilliant spell as test captain. Stokes was named the captain of the test side ahead of the New Zealand series after the resignation of Joe Root. Under his captaincy, the English team is doing great in the red-ball format. Ben Stokes’ documentary “Phoenix from the Ashes” will be available on Amazon Prime Video from 26 August 2022. Prime Video recently released the trailer of the documentary, and the 3-minute trailer has been loved by fans around the world. Prime Video took permission from the ECB to take interviews of the players, and Joe Root & Stuart Broad are seen in the trailer as well. Academy Award-winning director Sam Mendes has teamed up with Prime Video and Ben Stokes to show the highs and lows of the incredible career of England’s test captain. The film is being made by production company Whisper, and it is being said Ben Stokes and the team have been working continuously for the last 18 months on the same. This documentary will not only cover the highs of his career but even his Bristol brawl is also covered in the documentary. Yes I’ve been filming a documentary….you can watch it and see how shit has been for me (pretty interesting tbh)…..orrrrrrr you don’t have to watch it,so please stop having your opinion before you know what I’ve gone in to in the doc…..I’ve had a blast doing it so far 😃😃😃😃 — Ben Stokes (@benstokes38) February 11, 2022 “One thing I want to try and do with this is to get a side across to people that is quite tough to do in the image that we give across on TV,” said Stokes. “I still think it’s crazy sat here that there’s a documentary being done about me.

Scotland will take on United Arab Emirates in the inaugural game of the ICC Cricket World Cup League Two 2019-23 match, which will be played at Mannofield Park in Aberdeen. Both sides know the importance of this tournament, and they would want to start on a winning note. Scotland would want to take the advantage of their home conditions against the UAE side. Richie Berrington will lead the Scottish side, and he would want the players like George Munsey and Kyle Coetzer to fire. The pacers of the side will again be eager to do well at home. UAE will have to punch above their weights to do well in this match. Mannofield Park Aberdeen pitch report Mannofield Park in Aberdeen is hosting an international game after a spell of almost three years. The last international game at this ground was an ODI match between PNG and Oman in August 2019. This ground has favoured the pacers in the past, and the batting has been really tough on this very track. A fresh pitch is expected to be used in this match. The pacers get a visible amount of swing in the initial overs, and the batters will have a tough time out there. This pitch provides an extra bit of bounce which the pacers can optimize. A total of 17 ODIs have been played at this ground, where the average 1st innings ODI score has been 221 runs. New Zealand have posted the highest score on this ground (402-2), whereas Scotland has posted the lowest total (101-10). If the batters can negate the initial overs, they can score runs on this track. The boundaries of this ground are quite small, whereas the outfield of the ground is also quite fast, which is favourable for the batters. This ground is again expected to assist the pacers, and both captains would prefer to bowl first after winning the toss.

The likes of Ben Stokes, Wasim Akram, R Ashwin and a slew of cricketers don’t detect any pulse in it but what does the man inextricably linked with the format, Shikhar Dhawan , think about it? It’s the only format he plays for India. He gets the format, its ebbs and flows, the moments to seize, the moments to bide one’s time. “I really enjoy playing ODI cricket. It’s an art and still has charm. I love playing it. Like Test and T20 have their values, ODI cricket is also exciting. I really like it,” Dhawan told The Indian Express . Not a surprise considering he has scored 6493 runs with a healthy average of 45.40 from 155 ODIs with 17 tons and 37 fifties. But why does the man who has had successful seasons as an opener in IPL doesn’t get to play the T20 format for India?

Subscribe Now to get 66% OFF Is it because his batting is in a similar mould to a Virat Kohli , KL Rahul , and Rohit Sharma to an extent? That they all build up their innings rather than whack the ball from the go? Dhawan says he is clueless about the reason why he doesn’t get selected. “I honestly don’t know about it, maybe it could be the reason. I don’t want to go deep about it… I have not played T20 for India for a long time now, I don’t know where I see myself. I look to make the most out of every opportunity I am getting. Be it IPL, domestic cricket, or ODI, I just want to do well, and that is the only thing under my control.” Dhawan also offered support to Virat Kohli, who is going through a low patch of runs. His last hundred came in 2019. He stepped down from ODI captaincy, was removed from T20 leadership role, and combined with the fallow run of form, speculations have grown about his future. Advertisement “Virat is just one inning away and he is a champion player. I am sure he will come back soon. Once he starts going, there is no stopping for him,” Dhawan says. Kohli’s exit paved the way for Rohit Sharma as a captain and Ravi Shastri’s tenure ended with Rahul Dravid taking over as the coach. How does Dhawan see the changes in the dressing room atmosphere? “Yes, every individual is different, their energy is also different. When Ravi Bhai was there, the atmosphere was different. Rahul Bhai has a different atmosphere. I had a great bonding with Ravi Bhai back then and I would say my chemistry is excellent with Rahul Bhai too. I really enjoy working with him.” Advertisement On August 5, Dhawan opened his sports education company Da One Sports. The academy, he says, will focus on training at the grassroots and elite levels. They will also be developing 4 centers of excellence, along with educating 500 coaches with the help of a coach education program. “I feel Cricket has given me so much and I want to pass my knowledge and experience to the younger generation. I believe that if we put in the best of our efforts, ‘hum sab apne dreams ko reality mein convert kar sakte hain.’ We are selecting the best coaches from all over India to ensure good quality training. I trust every individual who is a part of ‘Da One Sports’ to come together with a common goal of making India a superpower nation in Sports.” Explained by The Indian Express Do not just read the news.
