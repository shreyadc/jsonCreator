He was at Headingley last week undergoing assessment, leaving on crutches. England’s inspirational Test captain is booked for surgery on his left knee in the coming days in a bid to overcome a long-standing issue — he did not bowl a ball in the final three matches of the summer Ashes. Suggestions are that the fresh damage is not a major concern, but he is already in a race to recover in time to join up with England’s pre-tour training camp early next year. During the World Cup, Stokes spoke positively about his post-op recovery being between five to seven weeks, saying: ‘I don’t think the surgery is going to have any hindrance on me taking part in India.’ But it could delay his return to bowling until deeper into the five matches, which start in Hyderabad on January 25 and conclude in Dharamsala in March.

I hope they win the World Cup against Australia India have the same magic as some of sports greats and should win World Cup Virat Kohli deserves to be a two-time World Cup winner given his career South Africa could be ones to watch at the next World Cup in Africa in four years By Stuart Broad For The Mail On Sunday Published: 22:30, 18 November 2023 | Updated: 22:30, 18 November 2023 e-mail View comments India winning the World Cup is a bit like Brazil winning football’s equivalent. There is a bit of magic to it. And personally, I think it would be great for the game if India come out on top against Australia in Ahmedabad because it will inspire the next generation of cricket’s powerhouse, just as their 2011 triumph did. An Indian victory is the most marketable outcome for the sport — comparable to when Usain Bolt used to line up for the 100 metres. All of athletics’ stakeholders wanted him to win because it leads to bigger sponsorship, bigger TV rights, greater exposure for the sport. Given the career Virat Kohli has had, making 50 ODI hundreds, he deserves to be a double World Cup winner in his own country, too. Yes, England went into the competition as champions. But they were never going to retain their title. There was a lack of clarity in their campaign, via constant changes in personnel, and they didn’t have the firepower with the ball to compete with this beast of an India team. And let’s face it, if you’re not first, you’re last in World Cups. Virat Kohli will be looking to help India to World Cup victory when they face Australia The trophy that both India and Australia will be looking to lift when they meet on Sunday The only team that could upset India in the final could be Pat Cummins' Australian side India are so powerful in their own conditions that I would say they would win this final 95 times out of 100. You only need look down their line-up to gauge their strength: they’ve got a top six all of whom can score match-winning hundreds, while any of their bowlers can take a five-for. They’re the only team in the World Cup that you can say that about. Australia are probably the only opponents — I would have said Pakistan pre-tournament — that could potentially upset India because they possess the bowling attack to blow the outstanding top order of the home side away. Australia’s route to producing a shock in my view is win the toss, bowl, hope the ball nips around and for Mitchell Starc to get it right, hit Rohit Sharma on the shin, and Josh Hazelwood following up by nicking off Kohli. If they could cook up a situation of early wickets like that, placing India under pressure and limiting them to something like 220, you would expect Australia to knock the runs off. But you only have to look at the rhythm of modern World Cups to work out which way things were going to go on the Subcontinent. The 2011 event was held in India; India won it. In 2015, it was in Australia; Australia won it. In 2019, it was in England; England won it. Basically, whoever you dish the next World Cup out to becomes a major favourite and so if I was a South African player, I would be looking at things, thinking, ‘I can definitely play another four years, here’. They will never have a better chance than in 2027. What I want most of all today is a spectacle. There was a real hoo-ha about the pitch for India’s semi-final win over New Zealand in Mumbai and 99 per cent of world cricket would tell you that it’s not that hard to get a fresh pitch for such a big game. Equally, if you’re a stadium that can get the rights to hold a World Cup semi- final, you should be able to produce a fresh pitch. South Africa could be ones to watch in the next World Cup when it's played on African soil England went into the competition as champions - but they were never going to retain their title (pictured, Ben Stokes) You could tell Kane Williamson was frustrated by the way he answered questions at the toss, saying: ‘We’d have liked to have had a bat on a used pitch.’ That’s about as niggly as New Zealand get. However, if a team can score 400 on it and at the halfway stage the chasing team are in with a chance of knocking off the runs, there can be no criticism of the actual pitch produced. It would have been a different story if it had been a 220 plays 150 scenario. Ultimately, the surface was a belter. About 50 times better than the one served up for the second semi in Kolkata, in fact. That one was a new-ball bowler’s dream, and you could see the surprise on the South African batters’ faces when it was nipping and bouncing. Then, when the spinners came on, it turned square. My one wish for Sunday is that it is an occasion when we are able to talk about the brilliance of the cricket on display.

Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin know the feeling of winning the ODI World Cup and Rohit Sharma himself was in the thick of things at the ‘Bull Ring’ in Johannesburg when India won their maiden T20 World Cup in 2007. But the final on Sunday will be completely different. It won’t just be a mere cricket tournament that needs to be won but also caring about the emotions of all those invested in the game. Rohit and his mates have time and again said that they don’t care about the outside noise but it is this outside noise that has made the game and this team relevant. All the stakeholders — the fans, who treat these players as ‘Demi Gods’, the broadcasters who spend a bomb buy Indian cricket telecast rights and the sponsors, who support the game — all want the game to thrive and survive. When Kapil Dev’s toothy grin at the Lord’s balcony melted fans’ hearts in 1983, it was the beginning and no one knew which direction the road ahead will lead us to. When Dhoni hit that winning six in 2011 World Cup final, it was more about a final reiteration that the ‘Mecca of Cricket’ has shifted long back and everyone needed to take a bow and accept Indian domination. Circa 2023, Indian cricket team will not just be looking to win a third ODI global title but also look at saving the ’50-over format’ which has been battling identity crisis for at least five years now. An Indian victory will give the format the injection it needs. Australia is the only team to have achieved title triumph with 11 wins in a row — in 2003 and 2007 — and Rohit indeed has a date with history since if the team gets the win on Sunday, it will only be the second side ever side to do so. A near flawless effort The skipper (550 runs @124 SR) has led from the front, literally walking the talk, with his aggressive in-your-face batting that has set the platform for Virat Kohli (711 @90 plus SR) to be the ‘run machine’ that everyone is so used to seeing. Shubman Gill has battled dengue and corresponding fatigue to show his class time and again. Shreyas Iyer has fought his short ball demons to score a semi-final hundred. He has conquered his head and thus was able to win hearts. But the man who has made a huge difference to India’s campaign is Mohammed Shami. The ‘Amroha Express’ has made this team enjoy an aura of invincibility with his 23-wicket show after initial exclusion from the playing XI. Shami is once again proving that old adage correct that batters win you games but bowlers can win you tournaments. Shami has put this team right there. There is KL Rahul’s composure, Ravindra Jadeja’s invaluable all-round game, Suryakumar Yadav’s x-factor and Kuldeep Yadav’s innate ability to create self-doubts in the minds of the batters. And there is Jasprit Bumrah, who is ‘toe-crusher on call’ and can pluck a David Warner or Steve Smith out for fun. The pitch, made of black soil, will be a slow turner but expecting Indian team to go with a third spinner in Ashwin looks like utmost luxury as of now. Not ugly Aussies but lethal as always Post Sandpaper Gate, Australians team has undergone a tectonic cultural shift but five-time World champions know the art of winning on big days. Australia is possibly the only team that can actually put India under immense pressure. “They’ve certainly played really well this World Cup. I think we certainly didn’t – I don’t think we scored par in that first game but we’re one catch away from potentially being in front of that game,” Cummins referred to the dropped catch of Virat Kohli which became the turning point during the league game between two teams, which was also their opening match. Cummins knows that 130,000 one-sided spectators would be rooting for India but he would harp on the fact that his team won an ODI series in India, earlier this year. “We won an ODI series here early on in the year. There’s lots of moments we can draw on where we’ve had success against, you know, a really good Indian side.” So who will win tomorrow? Ruthless Indians or nice Australians. It remains a multi-billion dollar question. Squads: India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (vc and wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Ravichandran Ashwin, Shardul Thakur, Ishan Kishan and Prasidh Krishna. Australia: Pat Cummins, David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey (wk), Sean Abbott.

They have won bilateral tournaments for fun and yet succumbed to defeats in most of these knockout fixtures by a massive margin. This time around, India finds itself in an ODI World Cup final for the first time in 12 years. The last time they made the final, they won the trophy. On that occasion too, the World Cup was staged at their own backyard — the second time it was ever won by a host nation, after Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup jointly hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka but with the titular contest happening in Pakistan. Australia won it when they were the co-hosts in 2015 with the final in Melbourne, and England in 2019 with the final at Lord's, London.

Speaking to Sportskeeda, Gambhir said he doesn’t see a place for Ashwin in the starting XI, insisting that India should not tinker with what has worked for them. “I don't think so (on Ashwin playing the final). I don't see a place for him and why would you even tinker with what is working for you. What better performance can you expect from your five bowlers,” said Gambhir. ð¸ð¸ Finale ready! â³ We're less than 24 hours away from the summit clash ðï¸ | | | — BCCI (@BCCI) He went on to say that it’s time to praise India’s bowling unit for delivering under pressure. Indian bowlers have picked a total of 95 wickets in the ODI World Cup, with Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Sirah , Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja constituting 85 of those dismissals. “After Hardik's injury, we have spoken that with just five specialist bowlers, teams will look to target one or two of them. However, that hasn't happened because of the quality of the five bowlers. We have spoken a lot about batters and I feel it is time to praise the bowlers for delivering under pressure,” Gambhir added. India booked a spot in their fourth ODI World Cup final, while Australia reached the final of the competition for a record-extending eighth occasion. The Men in Blue were immaculate in the league stage, winning all nine of their matches, to top the points table. Meanwhile, Australia recovered from losses against India and South Africa in their opening two league games to go on a seven-match winning streak to finish in third place in the group-stage.

22:31, 18 November 2023 | Updated: 22:41, 18 November 2023 e-mail View comments Ben Stokes has given England a new injury scare ahead of January’s Test tour of India after twisting his ankle during fitness testing. He was at Headingley last week undergoing assessment, leaving on crutches. England’s inspirational Test captain is booked for surgery on his left knee in the coming days in a bid to overcome a long-standing issue — he did not bowl a ball in the final three matches of the summer Ashes. Suggestions are that the fresh damage is not a major concern, but he is already in a race to recover in time to join up with England’s pre-tour training camp early next year. During the World Cup, Stokes spoke positively about his post-op recovery being between five to seven weeks, saying: ‘I don’t think the surgery is going to have any hindrance on me taking part in India.’ But it could delay his return to bowling until deeper into the five matches, which start in Hyderabad on January 25 and conclude in Dharamsala in March.

I hope they win the World Cup against Australia India have the same magic as some of sports greats and should win World Cup Virat Kohli deserves to be a two-time World Cup winner given his career South Africa could be ones to watch at the next World Cup in Africa in four years By Stuart Broad For The Mail On Sunday Published: 22:30, 18 November 2023 | Updated: 22:30, 18 November 2023 e-mail View comments India winning the World Cup is a bit like Brazil winning football’s equivalent. There is a bit of magic to it. And personally, I think it would be great for the game if India come out on top against Australia in Ahmedabad because it will inspire the next generation of cricket’s powerhouse, just as their 2011 triumph did. An Indian victory is the most marketable outcome for the sport — comparable to when Usain Bolt used to line up for the 100 metres. All of athletics’ stakeholders wanted him to win because it leads to bigger sponsorship, bigger TV rights, greater exposure for the sport. Given the career Virat Kohli has had, making 50 ODI hundreds, he deserves to be a double World Cup winner in his own country, too. Yes, England went into the competition as champions. But they were never going to retain their title. There was a lack of clarity in their campaign, via constant changes in personnel, and they didn’t have the firepower with the ball to compete with this beast of an India team. And let’s face it, if you’re not first, you’re last in World Cups. Virat Kohli will be looking to help India to World Cup victory when they face Australia The trophy that both India and Australia will be looking to lift when they meet on Sunday The only team that could upset India in the final could be Pat Cummins' Australian side India are so powerful in their own conditions that I would say they would win this final 95 times out of 100. You only need look down their line-up to gauge their strength: they’ve got a top six all of whom can score match-winning hundreds, while any of their bowlers can take a five-for. They’re the only team in the World Cup that you can say that about. Australia are probably the only opponents — I would have said Pakistan pre-tournament — that could potentially upset India because they possess the bowling attack to blow the outstanding top order of the home side away. Australia’s route to producing a shock in my view is win the toss, bowl, hope the ball nips around and for Mitchell Starc to get it right, hit Rohit Sharma on the shin, and Josh Hazelwood following up by nicking off Kohli. If they could cook up a situation of early wickets like that, placing India under pressure and limiting them to something like 220, you would expect Australia to knock the runs off. But you only have to look at the rhythm of modern World Cups to work out which way things were going to go on the Subcontinent. The 2011 event was held in India; India won it. In 2015, it was in Australia; Australia won it. In 2019, it was in England; England won it. Basically, whoever you dish the next World Cup out to becomes a major favourite and so if I was a South African player, I would be looking at things, thinking, ‘I can definitely play another four years, here’. They will never have a better chance than in 2027. What I want most of all today is a spectacle. There was a real hoo-ha about the pitch for India’s semi-final win over New Zealand in Mumbai and 99 per cent of world cricket would tell you that it’s not that hard to get a fresh pitch for such a big game. Equally, if you’re a stadium that can get the rights to hold a World Cup semi- final, you should be able to produce a fresh pitch. South Africa could be ones to watch in the next World Cup when it's played on African soil England went into the competition as champions - but they were never going to retain their title (pictured, Ben Stokes) You could tell Kane Williamson was frustrated by the way he answered questions at the toss, saying: ‘We’d have liked to have had a bat on a used pitch.’ That’s about as niggly as New Zealand get. However, if a team can score 400 on it and at the halfway stage the chasing team are in with a chance of knocking off the runs, there can be no criticism of the actual pitch produced. It would have been a different story if it had been a 220 plays 150 scenario. Ultimately, the surface was a belter. About 50 times better than the one served up for the second semi in Kolkata, in fact. That one was a new-ball bowler’s dream, and you could see the surprise on the South African batters’ faces when it was nipping and bouncing. Then, when the spinners came on, it turned square. My one wish for Sunday is that it is an occasion when we are able to talk about the brilliance of the cricket on display.

Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin know the feeling of winning the ODI World Cup and Rohit Sharma himself was in the thick of things at the ‘Bull Ring’ in Johannesburg when India won their maiden T20 World Cup in 2007. But the final on Sunday will be completely different. It won’t just be a mere cricket tournament that needs to be won but also caring about the emotions of all those invested in the game. Rohit and his mates have time and again said that they don’t care about the outside noise but it is this outside noise that has made the game and this team relevant. All the stakeholders — the fans, who treat these players as ‘Demi Gods’, the broadcasters who spend a bomb buy Indian cricket telecast rights and the sponsors, who support the game — all want the game to thrive and survive. When Kapil Dev’s toothy grin at the Lord’s balcony melted fans’ hearts in 1983, it was the beginning and no one knew which direction the road ahead will lead us to. When Dhoni hit that winning six in 2011 World Cup final, it was more about a final reiteration that the ‘Mecca of Cricket’ has shifted long back and everyone needed to take a bow and accept Indian domination. Circa 2023, Indian cricket team will not just be looking to win a third ODI global title but also look at saving the ’50-over format’ which has been battling identity crisis for at least five years now. An Indian victory will give the format the injection it needs. Australia is the only team to have achieved title triumph with 11 wins in a row — in 2003 and 2007 — and Rohit indeed has a date with history since if the team gets the win on Sunday, it will only be the second side ever side to do so. A near flawless effort The skipper (550 runs @124 SR) has led from the front, literally walking the talk, with his aggressive in-your-face batting that has set the platform for Virat Kohli (711 @90 plus SR) to be the ‘run machine’ that everyone is so used to seeing. Shubman Gill has battled dengue and corresponding fatigue to show his class time and again. Shreyas Iyer has fought his short ball demons to score a semi-final hundred. He has conquered his head and thus was able to win hearts. But the man who has made a huge difference to India’s campaign is Mohammed Shami. The ‘Amroha Express’ has made this team enjoy an aura of invincibility with his 23-wicket show after initial exclusion from the playing XI. Shami is once again proving that old adage correct that batters win you games but bowlers can win you tournaments. Shami has put this team right there. There is KL Rahul’s composure, Ravindra Jadeja’s invaluable all-round game, Suryakumar Yadav’s x-factor and Kuldeep Yadav’s innate ability to create self-doubts in the minds of the batters. And there is Jasprit Bumrah, who is ‘toe-crusher on call’ and can pluck a David Warner or Steve Smith out for fun. The pitch, made of black soil, will be a slow turner but expecting Indian team to go with a third spinner in Ashwin looks like utmost luxury as of now. Not ugly Aussies but lethal as always Post Sandpaper Gate, Australians team has undergone a tectonic cultural shift but five-time World champions know the art of winning on big days. Australia is possibly the only team that can actually put India under immense pressure. “They’ve certainly played really well this World Cup. I think we certainly didn’t – I don’t think we scored par in that first game but we’re one catch away from potentially being in front of that game,” Cummins referred to the dropped catch of Virat Kohli which became the turning point during the league game between two teams, which was also their opening match. Cummins knows that 130,000 one-sided spectators would be rooting for India but he would harp on the fact that his team won an ODI series in India, earlier this year. “We won an ODI series here early on in the year. There’s lots of moments we can draw on where we’ve had success against, you know, a really good Indian side.” So who will win tomorrow? Ruthless Indians or nice Australians. It remains a multi-billion dollar question. Squads: India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (vc and wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Ravichandran Ashwin, Shardul Thakur, Ishan Kishan and Prasidh Krishna. Australia: Pat Cummins, David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey (wk), Sean Abbott.

Tick. Tick!!! As the clock keeps ticking and time for the first ball to be bowled the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 final draws near, hearts of many a million Indians fans are beating faster. For Australia, it pretty much a usual day in the office. It's the thirteenth edition of the ODI World Cup and their eighth appearance in the final. What's the big deal, they could very well turn up and say. Sporting success is not unusual to an Aussie sports lover. The same, however, cannot be said about India. Australia with a population of over 2.6 crore (March 2023), as per the Australian Bureau Of Statistics, have 546 Olympic medals to their credit. India, the world's most populous country with over 140 crore people, have only 35 Olympic medals to celebrate. We have a lot of work to do before we can all ourselves a sporting nation. Aspiring to be one, Yes. But not quite there yet. Cricket, though, is one sport in which India has done well. But then there is no world title won by the men's team for many years now even in a sport in which it is one of the powerhouses, and one that is compared to being a religion in this part of world. It has been a heartbreak across formats ever since their ICC Champions Trophy victory in 2013. The T20 World Cup final in 2014, the ODI World Cup semifinal in 2015, the T20 World Cup semifinal in 2016, the ICC Champions Trophy final in 2017, the ODI World Cup semifinal in 2019, the group-stage matches against Pakistan and New Zealand in T20 World Cup 2021, the T20 World Cup 2022 semifinal, the ICC World Test Championship finals in both the cycles, 2019-21 and 2021-23 — India lost them all, coming close in mostly all these competitions barring one but then going on to lose when it mattered the most.  What has made these defeats difficult to forget is the fact that the team had shown no signs of it in the build-up to these events. They have won bilateral tournaments for fun and yet succumbed to defeats in most of these knockout fixtures by a massive margin. This time around, India finds itself in an ODI World Cup final for the first time in 12 years. The last time they made the final, they won the trophy. On that occasion too, the World Cup was staged at their own backyard — the second time it was ever won by a host nation, after Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup jointly hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka but with the titular contest happening in Pakistan. Australia won it when they were the co-hosts in 2015 with the final in Melbourne, and England in 2019 with the final at Lord's, London.

Tick. Tick!!! As the clock keeps ticking and time for the first ball to be bowled the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 final draws near, hearts of many a million Indians fans are beating faster. For Australia, it pretty much a usual day in the office. It's the thirteenth edition of the ODI World Cup and their eighth appearance in the final. What's the big deal, they could very well turn up and say. Sporting success is not unusual to an Aussie sports lover. The same, however, cannot be said about India. Australia with a population of over 2.6 crore (March 2023), as per the Australian Bureau Of Statistics, have 546 Olympic medals to their credit. India, the world's most populous country with over 140 crore people, have only 35 Olympic medals to celebrate. We have a lot of work to do before we can all ourselves a sporting nation. Aspiring to be one, Yes. But not quite there yet. Cricket, though, is one sport in which India has done well. But then there is no world title won by the men's team for many years now even in a sport in which it is one of the powerhouses, and one that is compared to being a religion in this part of world. It has been a heartbreak across formats ever since their ICC Champions Trophy victory in 2013. The T20 World Cup final in 2014, the ODI World Cup semifinal in 2015, the T20 World Cup semifinal in 2016, the ICC Champions Trophy final in 2017, the ODI World Cup semifinal in 2019, the group-stage matches against Pakistan and New Zealand in T20 World Cup 2021, the T20 World Cup 2022 semifinal, the ICC World Test Championship finals in both the cycles, 2019-21 and 2021-23 — India lost them all, coming close in mostly all these competitions barring one but then going on to lose when it mattered the most. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-6601185-5\"); }); What has made these defeats difficult to forget is the fact that the team had shown no signs of it in the build-up to these events.

Indian bowlers have picked a total of 95 wickets in the ODI World Cup, with Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Sirah , Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja constituting 85 of those dismissals. “After Hardik's injury, we have spoken that with just five specialist bowlers, teams will look to target one or two of them. However, that hasn't happened because of the quality of the five bowlers. We have spoken a lot about batters and I feel it is time to praise the bowlers for delivering under pressure,” Gambhir added.

22:31, 18 November 2023 | Updated: 22:41, 18 November 2023 e-mail View comments Ben Stokes has given England a new injury scare ahead of January’s Test tour of India after twisting his ankle during fitness testing. He was at Headingley last week undergoing assessment, leaving on crutches. England’s inspirational Test captain is booked for surgery on his left knee in the coming days in a bid to overcome a long-standing issue — he did not bowl a ball in the final three matches of the summer Ashes. Suggestions are that the fresh damage is not a major concern, but he is already in a race to recover in time to join up with England’s pre-tour training camp early next year. During the World Cup, Stokes spoke positively about his post-op recovery being between five to seven weeks, saying: ‘I don’t think the surgery is going to have any hindrance on me taking part in India.’ But it could delay his return to bowling until deeper into the five matches, which start in Hyderabad on January 25 and conclude in Dharamsala in March.

I hope they win the World Cup against Australia India have the same magic as some of sports greats and should win World Cup Virat Kohli deserves to be a two-time World Cup winner given his career South Africa could be ones to watch at the next World Cup in Africa in four years By Stuart Broad For The Mail On Sunday Published: 22:30, 18 November 2023 | Updated: 22:30, 18 November 2023 e-mail View comments India winning the World Cup is a bit like Brazil winning football’s equivalent. There is a bit of magic to it. And personally, I think it would be great for the game if India come out on top against Australia in Ahmedabad because it will inspire the next generation of cricket’s powerhouse, just as their 2011 triumph did. An Indian victory is the most marketable outcome for the sport — comparable to when Usain Bolt used to line up for the 100 metres. All of athletics’ stakeholders wanted him to win because it leads to bigger sponsorship, bigger TV rights, greater exposure for the sport. Given the career Virat Kohli has had, making 50 ODI hundreds, he deserves to be a double World Cup winner in his own country, too. Yes, England went into the competition as champions. But they were never going to retain their title. There was a lack of clarity in their campaign, via constant changes in personnel, and they didn’t have the firepower with the ball to compete with this beast of an India team. And let’s face it, if you’re not first, you’re last in World Cups. Virat Kohli will be looking to help India to World Cup victory when they face Australia The trophy that both India and Australia will be looking to lift when they meet on Sunday The only team that could upset India in the final could be Pat Cummins' Australian side India are so powerful in their own conditions that I would say they would win this final 95 times out of 100. You only need look down their line-up to gauge their strength: they’ve got a top six all of whom can score match-winning hundreds, while any of their bowlers can take a five-for. They’re the only team in the World Cup that you can say that about. Australia are probably the only opponents — I would have said Pakistan pre-tournament — that could potentially upset India because they possess the bowling attack to blow the outstanding top order of the home side away. Australia’s route to producing a shock in my view is win the toss, bowl, hope the ball nips around and for Mitchell Starc to get it right, hit Rohit Sharma on the shin, and Josh Hazelwood following up by nicking off Kohli. If they could cook up a situation of early wickets like that, placing India under pressure and limiting them to something like 220, you would expect Australia to knock the runs off. But you only have to look at the rhythm of modern World Cups to work out which way things were going to go on the Subcontinent. The 2011 event was held in India; India won it. In 2015, it was in Australia; Australia won it. In 2019, it was in England; England won it. Basically, whoever you dish the next World Cup out to becomes a major favourite and so if I was a South African player, I would be looking at things, thinking, ‘I can definitely play another four years, here’. They will never have a better chance than in 2027. What I want most of all today is a spectacle. There was a real hoo-ha about the pitch for India’s semi-final win over New Zealand in Mumbai and 99 per cent of world cricket would tell you that it’s not that hard to get a fresh pitch for such a big game. Equally, if you’re a stadium that can get the rights to hold a World Cup semi- final, you should be able to produce a fresh pitch. South Africa could be ones to watch in the next World Cup when it's played on African soil England went into the competition as champions - but they were never going to retain their title (pictured, Ben Stokes) You could tell Kane Williamson was frustrated by the way he answered questions at the toss, saying: ‘We’d have liked to have had a bat on a used pitch.’ That’s about as niggly as New Zealand get. However, if a team can score 400 on it and at the halfway stage the chasing team are in with a chance of knocking off the runs, there can be no criticism of the actual pitch produced. It would have been a different story if it had been a 220 plays 150 scenario. Ultimately, the surface was a belter. About 50 times better than the one served up for the second semi in Kolkata, in fact. That one was a new-ball bowler’s dream, and you could see the surprise on the South African batters’ faces when it was nipping and bouncing. Then, when the spinners came on, it turned square. My one wish for Sunday is that it is an occasion when we are able to talk about the brilliance of the cricket on display.

Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin know the feeling of winning the ODI World Cup and Rohit Sharma himself was in the thick of things at the ‘Bull Ring’ in Johannesburg when India won their maiden T20 World Cup in 2007. But the final on Sunday will be completely different. It won’t just be a mere cricket tournament that needs to be won but also caring about the emotions of all those invested in the game. Rohit and his mates have time and again said that they don’t care about the outside noise but it is this outside noise that has made the game and this team relevant. All the stakeholders — the fans, who treat these players as ‘Demi Gods’, the broadcasters who spend a bomb buy Indian cricket telecast rights and the sponsors, who support the game — all want the game to thrive and survive. When Kapil Dev’s toothy grin at the Lord’s balcony melted fans’ hearts in 1983, it was the beginning and no one knew which direction the road ahead will lead us to. When Dhoni hit that winning six in 2011 World Cup final, it was more about a final reiteration that the ‘Mecca of Cricket’ has shifted long back and everyone needed to take a bow and accept Indian domination. Circa 2023, Indian cricket team will not just be looking to win a third ODI global title but also look at saving the ’50-over format’ which has been battling identity crisis for at least five years now. An Indian victory will give the format the injection it needs. Australia is the only team to have achieved title triumph with 11 wins in a row — in 2003 and 2007 — and Rohit indeed has a date with history since if the team gets the win on Sunday, it will only be the second side ever side to do so. A near flawless effort The skipper (550 runs @124 SR) has led from the front, literally walking the talk, with his aggressive in-your-face batting that has set the platform for Virat Kohli (711 @90 plus SR) to be the ‘run machine’ that everyone is so used to seeing. Shubman Gill has battled dengue and corresponding fatigue to show his class time and again. Shreyas Iyer has fought his short ball demons to score a semi-final hundred. He has conquered his head and thus was able to win hearts. But the man who has made a huge difference to India’s campaign is Mohammed Shami. The ‘Amroha Express’ has made this team enjoy an aura of invincibility with his 23-wicket show after initial exclusion from the playing XI. Shami is once again proving that old adage correct that batters win you games but bowlers can win you tournaments. Shami has put this team right there. There is KL Rahul’s composure, Ravindra Jadeja’s invaluable all-round game, Suryakumar Yadav’s x-factor and Kuldeep Yadav’s innate ability to create self-doubts in the minds of the batters. And there is Jasprit Bumrah, who is ‘toe-crusher on call’ and can pluck a David Warner or Steve Smith out for fun. The pitch, made of black soil, will be a slow turner but expecting Indian team to go with a third spinner in Ashwin looks like utmost luxury as of now. Not ugly Aussies but lethal as always Post Sandpaper Gate, Australians team has undergone a tectonic cultural shift but five-time World champions know the art of winning on big days. Australia is possibly the only team that can actually put India under immense pressure. “They’ve certainly played really well this World Cup. I think we certainly didn’t – I don’t think we scored par in that first game but we’re one catch away from potentially being in front of that game,” Cummins referred to the dropped catch of Virat Kohli which became the turning point during the league game between two teams, which was also their opening match. Cummins knows that 130,000 one-sided spectators would be rooting for India but he would harp on the fact that his team won an ODI series in India, earlier this year. “We won an ODI series here early on in the year. There’s lots of moments we can draw on where we’ve had success against, you know, a really good Indian side.” So who will win tomorrow? Ruthless Indians or nice Australians. It remains a multi-billion dollar question. Squads: India: Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (vc and wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Ravichandran Ashwin, Shardul Thakur, Ishan Kishan and Prasidh Krishna. Australia: Pat Cummins, David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey (wk), Sean Abbott.

What's the big deal, they could very well turn up and say. Sporting success is not unusual to an Aussie sports lover. The same, however, cannot be said about India. Australia with a population of over 2.6 crore (March 2023), as per the Australian Bureau Of Statistics, have 546 Olympic medals to their credit. India, the world's most populous country with over 140 crore people, have only 35 Olympic medals to celebrate. We have a lot of work to do before we can all ourselves a sporting nation. Aspiring to be one, Yes. But not quite there yet. Cricket, though, is one sport in which India has done well. But then there is no world title won by the men's team for many years now even in a sport in which it is one of the powerhouses, and one that is compared to being a religion in this part of world. It has been a heartbreak across formats ever since their ICC Champions Trophy victory in 2013. The T20 World Cup final in 2014, the ODI World Cup semifinal in 2015, the T20 World Cup semifinal in 2016, the ICC Champions Trophy final in 2017, the ODI World Cup semifinal in 2019, the group-stage matches against Pakistan and New Zealand in T20 World Cup 2021, the T20 World Cup 2022 semifinal, the ICC World Test Championship finals in both the cycles, 2019-21 and 2021-23 — India lost them all, coming close in mostly all these competitions barring one but then going on to lose when it mattered the most.  What has made these defeats difficult to forget is the fact that the team had shown no signs of it in the build-up to these events. They have won bilateral tournaments for fun and yet succumbed to defeats in most of these knockout fixtures by a massive margin. This time around, India finds itself in an ODI World Cup final for the first time in 12 years. The last time they made the final, they won the trophy. On that occasion too, the World Cup was staged at their own backyard — the second time it was ever won by a host nation, after Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup jointly hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka but with the titular contest happening in Pakistan. Australia won it when they were the co-hosts in 2015 with the final in Melbourne, and England in 2019 with the final at Lord's, London.

All of that is now a thing of the past with a few hours remaining for the start of the titular contest.The team under Rohit Sharma has beaten New Zealand twice in this tournament itself. They defeated them once in the group stage and once in the semis to become the first team to reach the final. They have won 10 matches in a row, broken their previous record of most wins in a row in a single edition of a World Cup, and dominated every other opposition on their way to the final. All but one jinx now remains to be broken, which would decide their fate in the tournament — the Richard Kettleborough curse.

India is all set to face Australia in the final of the 2023 World Cup at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday, November 19. Speaking to Sportskeeda, Gambhir said he doesn’t see a place for Ashwin in the starting XI, insisting that India should not tinker with what has worked for them. “I don't think so (on Ashwin playing the final). I don't see a place for him and why would you even tinker with what is working for you. What better performance can you expect from your five bowlers,” said Gambhir. ð¸ð¸ Finale ready! â³ We're less than 24 hours away from the summit clash ðï¸ | | | — BCCI (@BCCI) He went on to say that it’s time to praise India’s bowling unit for delivering under pressure. Indian bowlers have picked a total of 95 wickets in the ODI World Cup, with Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Sirah , Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja constituting 85 of those dismissals. “After Hardik's injury, we have spoken that with just five specialist bowlers, teams will look to target one or two of them. However, that hasn't happened because of the quality of the five bowlers. We have spoken a lot about batters and I feel it is time to praise the bowlers for delivering under pressure,” Gambhir added. India booked a spot in their fourth ODI World Cup final, while Australia reached the final of the competition for a record-extending eighth occasion. The Men in Blue were immaculate in the league stage, winning all nine of their matches, to top the points table. Meanwhile, Australia recovered from losses against India and South Africa in their opening two league games to go on a seven-match winning streak to finish in third place in the group-stage. Rohit’s men went on to beat New Zealand by 70 runs in the first semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on November 15, while the Aussies saw off South Africa in the second semi-final at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on November 16.","pubDate":"2023-11-18 18:19:11","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"75749220f7e2063d95408aaf723ae39b","title":"Amid skyrocketed airfares for Ahmedabad, special World Cup train turns boon","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/amid-skyrocketed-airfares-for-ahmedabad-special-world-cup-train-turns-boon-2464692-2023-11-18?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Amid skyrocketed airfares for Ahmedabad, special World Cup train turns boon","content":"Listen to Story Cricket enthusiasts embarked on a special train today from New Delhi to Ahmedabad, eager to witness the ICC World Cup 2023 final.

રહેશે. દિવસનું મહત્તમ તાપમાન 33 ડિગ્રી સેલ્સિયસ અને લઘુત્તમ તાપમાન 17 ડિગ્રી સેલ્સિયસ રહી શકે છે. આઈસીસીના નિયમો અનુસાર, જો ફાઈનલ મેચ નિર્ધારિત તારીખે ન થઈ શકે તો તે રિઝર્વ ડે પર રમાશે. જો રિઝર્વ ડે પર પણ વરસાદ પડે અને મેચ સંપૂર્ણપણે ધોવાઈ જાય તો બંને ટીમોને સંયુક્ત વિજેતા જાહેર કરવામાં આવે છે.","pubDate":"2023-11-18
