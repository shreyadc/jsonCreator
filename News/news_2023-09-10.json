Flintoff, 45, returned to the public eye on Friday for the first time since being hospitalised with facial injuries and broken ribs suffered in a crash while filming a new series of Top Gear last December, with the shoot now suspended pending a health and safety review into the incident. Working in an unpaid capacity , the 2005 Ashes hero will be part of England's backroom team for their ODIs against New Zealand this month. Keen to follow in his footsteps and become an all-rounder capable of national treasure status, Liam Livingstone is loving being back in Flintoff's presence. The pair played together in two T20s for Lancashire's Second team during 'Freddie's' short-lived comeback in 2014 after retiring five years previously, and Livingstone is desperate to soak up more of his wealth of experience. Andrew Flintoff's facial injuries, health update and Richard Hammond's four-word response Andrew Flintoff update after Top Gear horror crash left England legend badly injured \"It's incredible to have him,\" the Lancashire star beamed. \"He's obviously been one of my heroes growing up. To have someone of his experience lingering around the dressing room is great for all the lads. \"When you see someone like Fred around, it's always good to chat. Especially while you’re batting: there's three and a half hours to pick the brains of someone who’s been there and done it. \"He's probably a national hero, everybody loves that Fred's joining us and I’m sure he’ll enjoy it as much himself. Over the next week or so, I'm sure he'll have plenty of laughs inside there.\" Have your say! Should Andrew Flintoff continue as a coach for England? Join the debate in the comments section . Andrew Flintoff remains patched up ( Image: Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Popperfoto via Getty Images) Flintoff isn't expected to continue with England beyond the ODIs clashes with New Zealand, the first of which England lost by eight wickets as they prepare to defend their World Cup crown. Ahead of the match, the 45-year-old was seen with visible scars on his face and tape on his nose while leading fielding drills with England's players in Cardiff. Captain Jos Buttler said it was \"great\" to have Flintoff around, adding: \"He's obviously an England legend and it's just nice to have him around the group. He's not been brought in with any specific role, just to be around and observe. A few of the lads can pick his brains a little bit and he's settled in really well. It's great to have him with us. Just for this series.\" After being involved in a crash on December 13, Flintoff received medical care at the scene before being taken to hospital for further treatment. In March, the BBC made an apology to Flintoff and said that it'd continue to support him during his recovery.

It was a sentiment fuelled by the ABC’s famous Australia Story profile on the Bennetts on May 3, 1999, when rugby league’s greatest coach opened up like never before, showing his softer side as he and Trish spoke of the challenges of raising two disabled kids, Justin and Katherine.It was one of the most watched stories in Australian Story history. ABC producer Vanessa Gorman said Bennett reached “saintlike proportions” as Australians shed tears at the sight of tungsten-tough Wayne stroking his disabled son Justin’s hair.So when Bennett confirmed he was leaving Trish, to begin a relationship with a mystery woman, later revealed as Dale Cage, 22 years his junior, the halo had slipped.“That’s the whole key to it. Wayne Bennett was never supposed to do that, OK?” he says in his authorised biography, penned by leading sports journalist Andrew Webster.Asked if the Judgement was hard to take, Bennett says: “No. Not hard to take at all.“Those in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. We’re all entitled to make our own decisions, OK?“If I made a decision that you think I shouldn’t have made, that’s not your business.“You can use your own judgement on this.“The journos have absolutely nothing on me. I’m not a punter. I’m not a drinker, I’m not a womaniser who has been in fights, blues, whatever.“But in that moment (when he left Trish), there was a sense that this guy’s human.“This guy is human so let’s give it to him now.“It was way over the top.“The people writing the stories had a shitload in their own closet. That’s the murky world we live in at times and I had to accept it and get on with life.”THE AFFAIRFor the first time, Bennett confirms what was suspected – that he began a physical relationship with Cage while still married to Trish.Bennett reveals he first met Cage late in 2013. He was coach of Newcastle. She was practice manager at a nearby office run by Newcastle doctor Neil Halpin, who would treat injured Knights players.The Knights had suddenly stopped paying Halpin for his services. The NRL club was on the brink of bankruptcy.Knights staff told Bennett about Halpin’s “cranky secretary” who had refused appointment because Newcastle weren’t paying their bills, so the coach tried to sort out the mess.“I’m here to see Dale,” Bennett recalls in the book.“Well, you found her,” she shot back. “But you might have to make an appointment because I’m going to lunch.”“Oh, you’re Dale.”“Yes.”“You’re not what I was expecting.”“What were you expecting?”“Someone who was old and cranky.”Webster writes Bennett joined her for lunch. The super coach, then 63, was, according to Cage, 41 at the time, “taken aback by my confidence”.Four days later, Halpin’s bill was paid.In the months that followed, Bennett would regularly pop up in Halpin’s waiting room holding two coffees.“From then on, we became best friends,” Cage recalls. “There was an instant connection.”THE FALLOUTIn the book, Webster writes: “For years, Bennett had moralised about people’s behaviour, but in the eyes of many people, particularly those with an axe to grind, his unfaithfulness to Trish was the lowest of acts.“For many, a switch had been flicked: Wayne Bennett, coach and former Father of the Year, was now just a man with a dirty secret, and the dirty secret was plastered all over the front of the Sunday rags.“What about this bloke?” one of his former players said to the author. “It’s a disgrace that he has done this to Trish.”When Bennett was sacked by Brisbane two years after his marriage breakdown became public, there was a view his off-field love dramas were impacting his work. Broncos insiders often referenced the Wayne soap opera. But Bennett hits out at suggestions his affair tainted his commitment to coaching.“Dale was a distraction to everybody because nobody thought I’d do what I did,” he said.“But it never stopped me from coaching.“We made the 2015 grand final – I was taking her out then. We made the semi-finals the year after. The preliminary final the year after that. The Broncos didn’t like Dale, but they all knew Trish well. I get it.“There were staff there who had been divorced. I wasn’t Robinson Crusoe. But there’s different rules for Wayne. There always has been. Wayne’s never been in that other place; he’s always been judged differently. That’s OK. He’s handled it.“My players didn’t care. There was one person who put himself in that place of being the judge and jury.“That’s the only person I can think of.”Bennett refuses to name that person but the finger is often pointed at former Broncos boss White, the man who sacked the super coach by voicemail in December 2018.The pair were friends for 34 years. A devout Catholic who attends mass every Sunday, White is married to long-time wife Angela, who remains a close friend of Trish Bennett.But White refutes suggestions he sacked Bennett partly because of his off-field dramas.“I’m not the moral police,” he says in the book. “I never made a moral judgement. I thought I was good support (for Wayne). He’s completely misinterpreted that.”THE OTHER WOMANIn the book, Webster describes Bennett and Cage as the ‘Brangelina’ of Brisbane.The pair made their first public appearance at Brisbane restaurant Montrachet in March 2017, six months after Bennett announced his marriage with Trish was over.“I was called a homewrecker,” Cage says. “They also misreported my age. I copped a lot of abuse online at the time and it’s still happening.“No-one has asked me for my side of the story. It’s been really weird.“All this stuff has been printed and said about me and I’m thinking, ‘Why has nobody rung me to fact-check or get my side of the story. Not one person. Maybe they were too scared to call me.”The Sunday Mail has made several requests since late 2016 to interview Cage. She rejected every request.Now 51, the mother of three says she struggled to come to terms with initial descriptions of her. They included secret blonde, buxom blonde, vivacious blonde and Benny’s blonde bombshell who was “a good sort, popular and fun”.“All these labels that were being thrown around about me,” Cage says.“I saw my face on the front page, the back page, the middle pages.“The buxom blonde bombshell ... I’ve never recovered from that day.“Whether it was my paranoia or not, I felt like I couldn’t walk down the street without feeling these things.”It has been reported previously that Bennett and Cage have split several times. Both insist that is rubbish. Cage was by Bennett’s side at the Redcliffe Dolphins’ inaugural NRL awards night on Thursday night.Cage believes she was never accepted by the Broncos because of the club’s loyalty to Trish. She says Bennett cannot go a single day without talking to her.“He liked me to come to matches and functions, but I wanted to stay at home and be a hermit,” Cage says.“Wayne’s very good at blocking out outside noise and just focusing on his job. But I had no idea. I was thrown into it.“People picked a side and Wayne worked out quickly who his friends were, and who wasn’t.“We can spend days together, and not do anything nor see anything, not get sick of each other.“Then when we are apart, he’ll call me three or four times a day. From the time we’ve been together, he’s called me every morning and every night.“He comes across as arrogant, but he’s definitely not that. He’s just shy – with very old-school values.”TRISH BENNETTThere are two times in the book when Wayne Bennett cries. One involves talking about his first love Trish.The author had asked Bennett if he could assist in setting up an interview with his ex-wife.“No,” Bennett said, lowering his head into his hands.He then raises his head choking back tears.“She’s a special person,” Bennett says of Trish.Seven years after the split, the pair are not legally divorced. They have a private financial agreement to ensure their three children, mainly disabled Justin, now 46, and 41-year-old Katherine, never have to struggle.It is understood Bennett and Trish still talk most days, mainly in relation to care requirements for Justin.When former Broncos chairman Don Nissen died of cancer in 2022, it was Trish who called her ex-husband to pass on the sad news. Bennett calls her ‘T’ when he answers the phone.“She is his North Star,” says Bennett’s daughter Beth.“She still is. Without her, none of this (Bennett’s remarkable coaching career) happens.”Trish’s closest friends have described her as a “saint”. In the Australian Story documentary, there is one segment where Bennett and son Justin are watching a replay of a Broncos-Souths game. Trish is beside Wayne, glasses on, behind a desk, studiously counting each tackle made by a Brisbane player and jotting it down on a piece of paper.In the book, Trish declines to discuss Bennett’s affair, but says the key to their relationship, ironically, was her honesty with him.“I tell him the truth,” she says. “I let him go away and think about it.“People don’t always tell him what he needs to hear. Sometimes, he doesn’t see the real picture.”Asked if Trish has ever spoken poorly about her father, Beth replies: “Never.”BATTLING DISABILITYIt took more than 40 years for the Bennetts to get a formal diagnosis for their disabled son Justin.In 2019, Justin was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a rare and lifelong form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life.In 1977, Justin had an allergic reaction to the whooping-cough vaccine. It was a one in 300,000 event.Trish recalls Justin being four months old when he had his first seizure, which lasted two hours.“That’s when brain damage occurred,” Wayne Bennett says. “With each seizure, he suffered more brain damage.”Today, Justin is 110kg and wheelchair bound after undergoing a hip replacement. Bennett says he has about 30 tablets a day, but since the Dravet diagnosis, the seizures have eased.During his most recent stint at the Broncos, Bennett had a mattress in his office in case Justin needed a sleep.“It’s taken a long time to diagnose the epilepsy that he has,” Trish says. “He’s had all sorts of seizures.“The worst drug for Dravet is Dilantin. Justin had been on it since he was 18 months old. It took us six months to wean him off that and since then, there’ve been no seizures.“He was given to us to look after.”Almost four years after Justin’s birth, sister Katherine arrived. She was born with arthrogryposis, a complex congenital condition that relates to thin, weak and atrophied joints and muscles throughout the body.Wayne recalls walking into the delivery room to find a “mangled mess”.“It was a shock because she was very twisted,” Trish says. “We’d never heard of the condition that she had, which is arthrogryposis. She had club feet. Her feet were sitting on her tummy. Her arms were extended because she couldn’t bend her elbows.“People say to you all the time, ‘I don’t know how you do it’. You start to worry, ‘How do I do it?’“You do it because you don’t have any choice. You want to go places but then Justin has a seizure and you can’t go. Anyway, that’s life.”Wayne adds: “Justin doesn’t care about my dramas in life. He needs his dad and he needs to play a game of cricket now, and he needs me to be silly, and he needs me to laugh and cuddle him.“I haven’t been able to come home and really brood and be sour and lock myself away. I tried to, but then Justin comes looking for me.”THE OTHER CHILDBeth Ikin (nee Bennett) is entitled to have middle-child syndrome. Now 44, the mother of four is married to former Broncos premiership-winner Ben Ikin, whose relationship with his father-in-law became highly strained after revelations of Bennett’s affair.While Justin and Katherine needed most care, Beth built a fortitude steeled by the sentiment that her famous father was wedded to two people _ Trish and rugby league.“You get to an age when you start to realise that you’re coming second,” Beth says in the book, recalling Bennett leaving the family to embark on another football camp.“There was always an open dialogue, but football was his whole world.“If he didn’t talk about that, there was nothing else to talk about.”When Bennett left the Broncos to join Souths in 2019, a Rabbitohs staffer spotted him writing on a birthday card.“This is for one of my grandkids,” Bennett said. “My daughter (Beth) doesn’t talk to me anymore, but I still send them a card so they know I care for them.”Bennett recently attended his grandson’s 21st birthday, but the super coach is not sure he will ever totally repair the cracks with Ikin.He says Beth is like “talking to myself”, but her adoration for her mother is palpable.“Maybe I can convince you to write a chapter called the X-factor and cross out the X and put a T (for Trish),” Beth says.“Without her, even if he was single, he couldn’t have done what he’s done.“We grounded him. When the pendulum shifted, and everyone loved him, he’d come home and get sledged by us.“(Mum) looked after the house, made sure it was all tickety-boo. He could fully focus knowing he had a beautiful home to come back to, knowing that he could take off without missing a beat because mum made sure it all ran properly.“The North Star.“Rugby league is where he felt safest. Because it embraced him when nothing else in his whole world did.“There was a certainty to it. You only grow out of that when you deal with your trauma, and I don’t think he has.“He did a really good job of trying to grow out of it, and separate himself from it, but I don’t think he’s dealt with it.”MAN IN THE MIRRORThe trauma to which Beth refers may have deep-seated roots in his alcoholic father Jim, who walked out on the family when Bennett was 12.It could be the trauma of Justin and Katherine. Or the trauma of a broken marriage no-one saw breaking.Whatever the trauma, it seems to drive Bennett, even today as Dolphins coach.There’s another traumatic memory that drives him, one not even Trish knows about ... until now.“I’m a policeman,” Bennett recalls.“I’m on the corner of Queen and Edward Streets in Brisbane.“I’m 20 years of age. I saw this young man selling newspapers on the corner.“He was intellectually disabled: that’s how he got some income. He had a seizure, hit the gutter and busted his face open. I was there so I had to do something, get an ambulance.“I was not to know that I was going to have an intellectually disabled son. I remember that guy every day of my life because I didn’t want my son to have nothing; to go out and do a job like that.“It’s stayed with me all these years. Still now.“All the things I have done have been for those two children of mine because I never want them to rely on the government when I’m not here.“Because the government will let them down.“Trish and myself, we’ve never let them down.“That’s the thing that’s driven me. More than anything else in my life.”The Wolf You Feed: Wayne Bennett – The Man, The Myth, The Mayhem by Andrew Webster. Macmillan Australia. RRP $36.99.

Twitter/@JayShah The focus of the cricketing community all over the world is firmly on the ICC World Cup even if the tournament is a little under a month away from kickoff. The build-up to the quadrennial mega event however, has been far from smooth for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with the announcement of the tournament schedule as well as the sale of tickets getting delayed. The World Cup schedule, which normally gets announced a year before the tournament, was announced on Tuesday, 27 June. That schedule, however, did not turn out to be the final one with several matches, including the high-profile India vs Pakistan showdown, getting rescheduled. Additionally, fans have been having a hard time purchasing match tickets, the sale of which had been delayed due to the late announcement of the schedule as well as the subsequent changes.

As a result, the BCCI has been working diligently to finalise all aspects of the tournament, including venue availability, team schedules, and other essential arrangements,” Shah said in an interview on Sportstar .

Team India are yet to play a game in the Super Fours and will hope that the rain stays away on Sunday, September 10 with the heavens opening up only in their matches so far in the tournament. The first India-Pakistan clash was washed out due to rain while the Men in Blue chased down a DLS-adjusted target in the second game against Nepal. The Sri Lanka-Bangladesh encounter remained interruption-free as even though the clouds did get dark a couple of times, the heavens didn't open up but the forecast isn't looking encouraging enough for the India-Pakistan match. The match begins at 3 PM local time in Colombo and the rain prediction stands at 92 per cent, which is the highest during the whole day. It's 91 per cent an hour before the match and it doesn't look encouraging enough for a timely start. The probability reduces to 87 per cent at 4 PM but stays in high 80s for the rest of the evening - 89 at 5 PM, 87 at 6 PM, 88 at 7 PM, 89 at 8 PM, 88 at 9 PM, 86 at 10 PM and 91 at 11 PM. If the forecast is anything to go by, we will be lucky to have any game on Sunday, September 10. Thankfully, there's a reserve day in place but the fans and the players, especially the Indian team will hope that the result is achieved on Sunday itself, given they have to play against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, September 12. Pakistan already have two points in the Super Fours and with the rest of the five games of the tournament slated to be held in Colombo, the forecast needs to get better rather quickly otherwise, there's a threat of the tournament becoming a damp squib.","pubDate":"2023-09-09 19:02:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"80cf29622edf19d3699925f66e4bdf52","title":"Ind vs Pak, Asia Cup 2023 match: India to take on Pakistan in Super 4 game today","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ind-vs-pak-super-4-asia-cup-2023-match-team-india-to-take-on-pakistan-in-super-4-game-today-sept-10-bcci-3059744","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan have already bagged two points after beating Bangladesh by 7 wickets at Lahore.","content":"Ind vs Pak, Super 4 match: Team India will play their first Super Four stage match of the Asia Cup 2023 against Pakistan in Colombo on Sunday, September 10.

Meaning she has to go bigger with each shot and narrow the margin for return, hence the swathe of unforced errors. 22:03 Sabalenka surging Well, here we go! Sabalenka wins the first two points and finally crushes them inside the lines. There's another wide forehand, 15-30. 22:01 Gauff gets the double-break!

The American is certainly the one in control here on Arthur Ashe.The sequence of Gauff's ability to reach almost-unreachable balls before Sabalenka rattles off another laser is quite incredible. On this occassion, Sabelenka wins the point and saves the break. 21:48 Wild start to the third set Sabalenka's play is both equally mesmerizing and perplexing. Thrashes a forehand winner for 15-0, fires an overhead into the net. Then, a crushing backhand cross-court for 30-15 before a sloppy shot into the net. And here we have 30-30 21:45 Brave effort from Gauff After Sabalenka won the first set in 40 minutes, despite a litany on unforced errors, Gauff roared back claiming the second in 44. 21:44 Gauff takes second set 6-3 Sabalenka cannot overcome Gauff's retrieval skills as well this set.

The Belarussian makes Gauff serve for it. 21:32 Gauff holds, leading 5-2 Gauff refuses to let Sabalenka in on this service game - she leads 40-15 and closes it out.

Flintoff, 45, returned to the public eye on Friday for the first time since being hospitalised with facial injuries and broken ribs suffered in a crash while filming a new series of Top Gear last December, with the shoot now suspended pending a health and safety review into the incident. Working in an unpaid capacity , the 2005 Ashes hero will be part of England's backroom team for their ODIs against New Zealand this month. Keen to follow in his footsteps and become an all-rounder capable of national treasure status, Liam Livingstone is loving being back in Flintoff's presence. The pair played together in two T20s for Lancashire's Second team during 'Freddie's' short-lived comeback in 2014 after retiring five years previously, and Livingstone is desperate to soak up more of his wealth of experience. Andrew Flintoff's facial injuries, health update and Richard Hammond's four-word response Andrew Flintoff update after Top Gear horror crash left England legend badly injured \"It's incredible to have him,\" the Lancashire star beamed. \"He's obviously been one of my heroes growing up. To have someone of his experience lingering around the dressing room is great for all the lads. \"When you see someone like Fred around, it's always good to chat. Especially while you’re batting: there's three and a half hours to pick the brains of someone who’s been there and done it. \"He's probably a national hero, everybody loves that Fred's joining us and I’m sure he’ll enjoy it as much himself. Over the next week or so, I'm sure he'll have plenty of laughs inside there.\" Have your say! Should Andrew Flintoff continue as a coach for England? Join the debate in the comments section . Andrew Flintoff remains patched up ( Image: Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Popperfoto via Getty Images) Flintoff isn't expected to continue with England beyond the ODIs clashes with New Zealand, the first of which England lost by eight wickets as they prepare to defend their World Cup crown. Ahead of the match, the 45-year-old was seen with visible scars on his face and tape on his nose while leading fielding drills with England's players in Cardiff. Captain Jos Buttler said it was \"great\" to have Flintoff around, adding: \"He's obviously an England legend and it's just nice to have him around the group. He's not been brought in with any specific role, just to be around and observe. A few of the lads can pick his brains a little bit and he's settled in really well. It's great to have him with us. Just for this series.\" After being involved in a crash on December 13, Flintoff received medical care at the scene before being taken to hospital for further treatment. In March, the BBC made an apology to Flintoff and said that it'd continue to support him during his recovery.

Labuschagne was even quicker, reaching his second one-day international century off 80 balls.Both his hundreds have been made in the country of his birth. He hit 108 in Potchefstroom in March 2020.“The boys at the top got us off to a lightning start and put pressure on the bowlers,” said Labuschagne, who said the fact that he had not been selected for the World Cup was “not in my control - I am concentrating on enjoying my cricket and playing as well as I can.” It was Australia’s third-highest total in the 50-overs format and the fourth-highest conceded by South Africa.“They were on top of us from ball one,” admitted Bavuma.","pubDate":"2023-09-09 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","source_priority":608587,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c7adb3542b9332c2697d0f023aa363c2","title":"Wayne’s regret: Super coach’s tears over marriage breakdown","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/nrl/wayne-bennetts-new-book-tears-shed-for-broken-marriage/news-story/2ea74b69df02b42a9e5859184ffa8c21","keywords":["Books","Dolphins","NRL News"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rugby league super coach Wayne Bennett has broken his silence on the breakdown of his 42-year marriage and his secret affair, shedding tears as he described ex-wife Trish as a “special person”.","content":"Bennett’s revelations come as his new long-term partner, Dale Cage, opened up on her own heartache, claiming she has been labelled a homewrecker and a victim of social-media abuse for the past seven years.In his new book, The Wolf You Feed, released on Monday, Bennett speaks for the first time about his bust-up with Trish, his two years of infidelity with Dale, and their roles in Australian sport’s bizarre love triangle.The 73-year-old also shares intimate details of meeting Dale, the strength of Trish in largely caring for their two heavily-disabled kids and the repercussions of broken family bonds over the affair that shocked a nation.“Nobody thought I’d do what I did,” Bennett says candidly.His daughter Beth speaks with candour about her father’s obsession with rugby league, while Trish takes aim at former Broncos CEO Paul White for his role in the super coach’s sacking at Brisbane in 2018 amid the Bennett family fallout.It’s a complex story with raw, complex threads, none more so than the relationship triumvirate that is Wayne, Trish and Dale.THE BENNETT BOMBSHELLIn September 2016, Bennett announced he and Trish were separating after more than four decades of marriage.They were seemingly Australia’s unbreakable couple. It was a sentiment fuelled by the ABC’s famous Australia Story profile on the Bennetts on May 3, 1999, when rugby league’s greatest coach opened up like never before, showing his softer side as he and Trish spoke of the challenges of raising two disabled kids, Justin and Katherine.It was one of the most watched stories in Australian Story history. ABC producer Vanessa Gorman said Bennett reached “saintlike proportions” as Australians shed tears at the sight of tungsten-tough Wayne stroking his disabled son Justin’s hair.So when Bennett confirmed he was leaving Trish, to begin a relationship with a mystery woman, later revealed as Dale Cage, 22 years his junior, the halo had slipped.“That’s the whole key to it. Wayne Bennett was never supposed to do that, OK?” he says in his authorised biography, penned by leading sports journalist Andrew Webster.Asked if the Judgement was hard to take, Bennett says: “No. Not hard to take at all.“Those in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. We’re all entitled to make our own decisions, OK?“If I made a decision that you think I shouldn’t have made, that’s not your business.“You can use your own judgement on this.“The journos have absolutely nothing on me. I’m not a punter. I’m not a drinker, I’m not a womaniser who has been in fights, blues, whatever.“But in that moment (when he left Trish), there was a sense that this guy’s human.“This guy is human so let’s give it to him now.“It was way over the top.“The people writing the stories had a shitload in their own closet. That’s the murky world we live in at times and I had to accept it and get on with life.”THE AFFAIRFor the first time, Bennett confirms what was suspected – that he began a physical relationship with Cage while still married to Trish.Bennett reveals he first met Cage late in 2013. He was coach of Newcastle. She was practice manager at a nearby office run by Newcastle doctor Neil Halpin, who would treat injured Knights players.The Knights had suddenly stopped paying Halpin for his services. The NRL club was on the brink of bankruptcy.Knights staff told Bennett about Halpin’s “cranky secretary” who had refused appointment because Newcastle weren’t paying their bills, so the coach tried to sort out the mess.“I’m here to see Dale,” Bennett recalls in the book.“Well, you found her,” she shot back. “But you might have to make an appointment because I’m going to lunch.”“Oh, you’re Dale.”“Yes.”“You’re not what I was expecting.”“What were you expecting?”“Someone who was old and cranky.”Webster writes Bennett joined her for lunch. The super coach, then 63, was, according to Cage, 41 at the time, “taken aback by my confidence”.Four days later, Halpin’s bill was paid.In the months that followed, Bennett would regularly pop up in Halpin’s waiting room holding two coffees.“From then on, we became best friends,” Cage recalls. “There was an instant connection.”THE FALLOUTIn the book, Webster writes: “For years, Bennett had moralised about people’s behaviour, but in the eyes of many people, particularly those with an axe to grind, his unfaithfulness to Trish was the lowest of acts.“For many, a switch had been flicked: Wayne Bennett, coach and former Father of the Year, was now just a man with a dirty secret, and the dirty secret was plastered all over the front of the Sunday rags.“What about this bloke?” one of his former players said to the author. “It’s a disgrace that he has done this to Trish.”When Bennett was sacked by Brisbane two years after his marriage breakdown became public, there was a view his off-field love dramas were impacting his work. Broncos insiders often referenced the Wayne soap opera. But Bennett hits out at suggestions his affair tainted his commitment to coaching.“Dale was a distraction to everybody because nobody thought I’d do what I did,” he said.“But it never stopped me from coaching.“We made the 2015 grand final – I was taking her out then. We made the semi-finals the year after. The preliminary final the year after that. The Broncos didn’t like Dale, but they all knew Trish well. I get it.“There were staff there who had been divorced. I wasn’t Robinson Crusoe. But there’s different rules for Wayne. There always has been. Wayne’s never been in that other place; he’s always been judged differently. That’s OK. He’s handled it.“My players didn’t care. There was one person who put himself in that place of being the judge and jury.“That’s the only person I can think of.”Bennett refuses to name that person but the finger is often pointed at former Broncos boss White, the man who sacked the super coach by voicemail in December 2018.The pair were friends for 34 years. A devout Catholic who attends mass every Sunday, White is married to long-time wife Angela, who remains a close friend of Trish Bennett.But White refutes suggestions he sacked Bennett partly because of his off-field dramas.“I’m not the moral police,” he says in the book. “I never made a moral judgement. I thought I was good support (for Wayne). He’s completely misinterpreted that.”THE OTHER WOMANIn the book, Webster describes Bennett and Cage as the ‘Brangelina’ of Brisbane.The pair made their first public appearance at Brisbane restaurant Montrachet in March 2017, six months after Bennett announced his marriage with Trish was over.“I was called a homewrecker,” Cage says. “They also misreported my age. I copped a lot of abuse online at the time and it’s still happening.“No-one has asked me for my side of the story. It’s been really weird.“All this stuff has been printed and said about me and I’m thinking, ‘Why has nobody rung me to fact-check or get my side of the story. Not one person. Maybe they were too scared to call me.”The Sunday Mail has made several requests since late 2016 to interview Cage. She rejected every request.Now 51, the mother of three says she struggled to come to terms with initial descriptions of her. They included secret blonde, buxom blonde, vivacious blonde and Benny’s blonde bombshell who was “a good sort, popular and fun”.“All these labels that were being thrown around about me,” Cage says.“I saw my face on the front page, the back page, the middle pages.“The buxom blonde bombshell ... I’ve never recovered from that day.“Whether it was my paranoia or not, I felt like I couldn’t walk down the street without feeling these things.”It has been reported previously that Bennett and Cage have split several times. Both insist that is rubbish. Cage was by Bennett’s side at the Redcliffe Dolphins’ inaugural NRL awards night on Thursday night.Cage believes she was never accepted by the Broncos because of the club’s loyalty to Trish. She says Bennett cannot go a single day without talking to her.“He liked me to come to matches and functions, but I wanted to stay at home and be a hermit,” Cage says.“Wayne’s very good at blocking out outside noise and just focusing on his job. But I had no idea. I was thrown into it.“People picked a side and Wayne worked out quickly who his friends were, and who wasn’t.“We can spend days together, and not do anything nor see anything, not get sick of each other.“Then when we are apart, he’ll call me three or four times a day. From the time we’ve been together, he’s called me every morning and every night.“He comes across as arrogant, but he’s definitely not that. He’s just shy – with very old-school values.”TRISH BENNETTThere are two times in the book when Wayne Bennett cries. One involves talking about his first love Trish.The author had asked Bennett if he could assist in setting up an interview with his ex-wife.“No,” Bennett said, lowering his head into his hands.He then raises his head choking back tears.“She’s a special person,” Bennett says of Trish.Seven years after the split, the pair are not legally divorced. They have a private financial agreement to ensure their three children, mainly disabled Justin, now 46, and 41-year-old Katherine, never have to struggle.It is understood Bennett and Trish still talk most days, mainly in relation to care requirements for Justin.When former Broncos chairman Don Nissen died of cancer in 2022, it was Trish who called her ex-husband to pass on the sad news. Bennett calls her ‘T’ when he answers the phone.“She is his North Star,” says Bennett’s daughter Beth.“She still is. Without her, none of this (Bennett’s remarkable coaching career) happens.”Trish’s closest friends have described her as a “saint”. In the Australian Story documentary, there is one segment where Bennett and son Justin are watching a replay of a Broncos-Souths game. Trish is beside Wayne, glasses on, behind a desk, studiously counting each tackle made by a Brisbane player and jotting it down on a piece of paper.In the book, Trish declines to discuss Bennett’s affair, but says the key to their relationship, ironically, was her honesty with him.“I tell him the truth,” she says. “I let him go away and think about it.“People don’t always tell him what he needs to hear. Sometimes, he doesn’t see the real picture.”Asked if Trish has ever spoken poorly about her father, Beth replies: “Never.”BATTLING DISABILITYIt took more than 40 years for the Bennetts to get a formal diagnosis for their disabled son Justin.In 2019, Justin was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a rare and lifelong form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life.In 1977, Justin had an allergic reaction to the whooping-cough vaccine. It was a one in 300,000 event.Trish recalls Justin being four months old when he had his first seizure, which lasted two hours.“That’s when brain damage occurred,” Wayne Bennett says. “With each seizure, he suffered more brain damage.”Today, Justin is 110kg and wheelchair bound after undergoing a hip replacement. Bennett says he has about 30 tablets a day, but since the Dravet diagnosis, the seizures have eased.During his most recent stint at the Broncos, Bennett had a mattress in his office in case Justin needed a sleep.“It’s taken a long time to diagnose the epilepsy that he has,” Trish says. “He’s had all sorts of seizures.“The worst drug for Dravet is Dilantin. Justin had been on it since he was 18 months old. It took us six months to wean him off that and since then, there’ve been no seizures.“He was given to us to look after.”Almost four years after Justin’s birth, sister Katherine arrived. She was born with arthrogryposis, a complex congenital condition that relates to thin, weak and atrophied joints and muscles throughout the body.Wayne recalls walking into the delivery room to find a “mangled mess”.“It was a shock because she was very twisted,” Trish says. “We’d never heard of the condition that she had, which is arthrogryposis. She had club feet. Her feet were sitting on her tummy. Her arms were extended because she couldn’t bend her elbows.“People say to you all the time, ‘I don’t know how you do it’. You start to worry, ‘How do I do it?’“You do it because you don’t have any choice. You want to go places but then Justin has a seizure and you can’t go. Anyway, that’s life.”Wayne adds: “Justin doesn’t care about my dramas in life. He needs his dad and he needs to play a game of cricket now, and he needs me to be silly, and he needs me to laugh and cuddle him.“I haven’t been able to come home and really brood and be sour and lock myself away. I tried to, but then Justin comes looking for me.”THE OTHER CHILDBeth Ikin (nee Bennett) is entitled to have middle-child syndrome. Now 44, the mother of four is married to former Broncos premiership-winner Ben Ikin, whose relationship with his father-in-law became highly strained after revelations of Bennett’s affair.While Justin and Katherine needed most care, Beth built a fortitude steeled by the sentiment that her famous father was wedded to two people _ Trish and rugby league.“You get to an age when you start to realise that you’re coming second,” Beth says in the book, recalling Bennett leaving the family to embark on another football camp.“There was always an open dialogue, but football was his whole world.“If he didn’t talk about that, there was nothing else to talk about.”When Bennett left the Broncos to join Souths in 2019, a Rabbitohs staffer spotted him writing on a birthday card.“This is for one of my grandkids,” Bennett said. “My daughter (Beth) doesn’t talk to me anymore, but I still send them a card so they know I care for them.”Bennett recently attended his grandson’s 21st birthday, but the super coach is not sure he will ever totally repair the cracks with Ikin.He says Beth is like “talking to myself”, but her adoration for her mother is palpable.“Maybe I can convince you to write a chapter called the X-factor and cross out the X and put a T (for Trish),” Beth says.“Without her, even if he was single, he couldn’t have done what he’s done.“We grounded him. When the pendulum shifted, and everyone loved him, he’d come home and get sledged by us.“(Mum) looked after the house, made sure it was all tickety-boo. He could fully focus knowing he had a beautiful home to come back to, knowing that he could take off without missing a beat because mum made sure it all ran properly.“The North Star.“Rugby league is where he felt safest. Because it embraced him when nothing else in his whole world did.“There was a certainty to it. You only grow out of that when you deal with your trauma, and I don’t think he has.“He did a really good job of trying to grow out of it, and separate himself from it, but I don’t think he’s dealt with it.”MAN IN THE MIRRORThe trauma to which Beth refers may have deep-seated roots in his alcoholic father Jim, who walked out on the family when Bennett was 12.It could be the trauma of Justin and Katherine. Or the trauma of a broken marriage no-one saw breaking.Whatever the trauma, it seems to drive Bennett, even today as Dolphins coach.There’s another traumatic memory that drives him, one not even Trish knows about ... until now.“I’m a policeman,” Bennett recalls.“I’m on the corner of Queen and Edward Streets in Brisbane.“I’m 20 years of age. I saw this young man selling newspapers on the corner.“He was intellectually disabled: that’s how he got some income. He had a seizure, hit the gutter and busted his face open. I was there so I had to do something, get an ambulance.“I was not to know that I was going to have an intellectually disabled son. I remember that guy every day of my life because I didn’t want my son to have nothing; to go out and do a job like that.“It’s stayed with me all these years.

FirstCricket Staff Last Updated:September 10, 2023 00:47:15 IST File image of BCCI secretary Jay Shah. Twitter/@JayShah The focus of the cricketing community all over the world is firmly on the ICC World Cup even if the tournament is a little under a month away from kickoff. The build-up to the quadrennial mega event however, has been far from smooth for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with the announcement of the tournament schedule as well as the sale of tickets getting delayed. The World Cup schedule, which normally gets announced a year before the tournament, was announced on Tuesday, 27 June. That schedule, however, did not turn out to be the final one with several matches, including the high-profile India vs Pakistan showdown, getting rescheduled. Additionally, fans have been having a hard time purchasing match tickets, the sale of which had been delayed due to the late announcement of the schedule as well as the subsequent changes.

As a result, the BCCI has been working diligently to finalise all aspects of the tournament, including venue availability, team schedules, and other essential arrangements,” Shah said in an interview on Sportstar . In order to manage the massive demand for tickets in the cricket-mad nation, the BCCI has decided to release another 4,00,000 tickets after speaking with state associations. The “general sale of tickets” for all matches in the tournament had gone live from 8 pm on Friday, 8 September and those for the semi-finals and final will go live from Friday, 15 September.

The scale and diversity of India require meticulous planning, coordination, and execution to ensure the tournament’s success and seamless experience for players, fans, and stakeholders,” Shah added.

Team India are yet to play a game in the Super Fours and will hope that the rain stays away on Sunday, September 10 with the heavens opening up only in their matches so far in the tournament. The first India-Pakistan clash was washed out due to rain while the Men in Blue chased down a DLS-adjusted target in the second game against Nepal. The Sri Lanka-Bangladesh encounter remained interruption-free as even though the clouds did get dark a couple of times, the heavens didn't open up but the forecast isn't looking encouraging enough for the India-Pakistan match. The match begins at 3 PM local time in Colombo and the rain prediction stands at 92 per cent, which is the highest during the whole day. It's 91 per cent an hour before the match and it doesn't look encouraging enough for a timely start. The probability reduces to 87 per cent at 4 PM but stays in high 80s for the rest of the evening - 89 at 5 PM, 87 at 6 PM, 88 at 7 PM, 89 at 8 PM, 88 at 9 PM, 86 at 10 PM and 91 at 11 PM. If the forecast is anything to go by, we will be lucky to have any game on Sunday, September 10. Thankfully, there's a reserve day in place but the fans and the players, especially the Indian team will hope that the result is achieved on Sunday itself, given they have to play against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, September 12. Pakistan already have two points in the Super Fours and with the rest of the five games of the tournament slated to be held in Colombo, the forecast needs to get better rather quickly otherwise, there's a threat of the tournament becoming a damp squib.","pubDate":"2023-09-09 19:02:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"80cf29622edf19d3699925f66e4bdf52","title":"Ind vs Pak, Asia Cup 2023 match: India to take on Pakistan in Super 4 game today","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ind-vs-pak-super-4-asia-cup-2023-match-team-india-to-take-on-pakistan-in-super-4-game-today-sept-10-bcci-3059744","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan have already bagged two points after beating Bangladesh by 7 wickets at Lahore.","content":"Ind vs Pak, Super 4 match: Team India will play their first Super Four stage match of the Asia Cup 2023 against Pakistan in Colombo on Sunday, September 10.

Gauff looked all at sea in the first set but battled back to win 2-6 6-3 6-2. She has raced up to the stands to celebrate with her mother, father and other family members. Tremendous scenes for those American and otherwise. It's hard to believe she's just 19 years of age. 22:24 Coco Gauff wins the US Open! Arthur Ashe rises to its feet as Gauff leads 40-0. Abd of course, it's a ridiculous retrieval backhand down the line to win. 22:23 Two points away Sabalenka hunches over after another unforced error, Gauff now within three points. Make that two. 22:20 Gauff breaks right back, leads 5-2 A double fault, sheesh. Gauff now has a chance to break right back - with two break points.

The American has a 15-30 lead here. 22:17 Evenly poised Gauff certainly looks more tentative menawhile Sabelnka is still going for the big shots. 15-15 all. Those points encapsulating the jekel and hyde nature of the No. 2 seed. 22:16 Sabalenka breaks - trails 4-2! Well, well, well. Gauff hits a wide forehand and Sabalenka has a break back. She still trails by a break of course, and 4-2 in the third. 22:14 Play now back underway Gauff and Sabalenka tied at 15-15. 22:12 Sabalenka takes medical timeout Sabelenka has now taken a medical timeout and is getting some work done on her inner thigh. Meanwhile, Gauff is back on court practicing her serve ahead of the sixth game of the final set. If anything else, while there may be an injury here, the Belarussian has time to collect her thoughts and recalibrate. 22:09 Sabalenka closes it to 4-1 Sabalenka shows some signs of life, as she holds serve to close the gap to 4-1. The Belarussian is down two breaks. 22:05 Gauff rallies to hold serve, leads 4-0 Gauff wins three points in a row to lead 4-0, as much of the Arthur Ashe crowd rises to its feet. 22:04 How has this match turned around? The challenge for Sabelnka is Gauff is now comfortable with the pace and power. Meaning she has to go bigger with each shot and narrow the margin for return, hence the swathe of unforced errors. 22:03 Sabalenka surging Well, here we go! Sabalenka wins the first two points and finally crushes them inside the lines. There's another wide forehand, 15-30. 22:01 Gauff gets the double-break! She leads 3-0 in the third Another unforced error for Sabalenka brings Gauff within three games of a US Open title. What an unbelievable turnaround since the first set. 21:59 Break point for Gauff Sabalenka battles back to 30-30 but hits wide on a backhand to give Gauff a chance for a second break. 21:57 Ashe is rising The Arthur Ashe crowd is reaching fever pitch as we speak. And no wonder as Gauff has a 0-30 lead! 21:56 Gauff breezes to 2-0 lead Gauff just rolls through her service game to take a 2-0 lead. Sabalenka has the game and will to fight back, will it begin now? 21:52 Gauff breaks Sabalenka and leads 1-0! Antoher forehand error, the 20th for Sabalenka, gives Gauff another break point. And with authority Gauff breaks as Arthur Ashe erupts. 21:50 Sabalenka survives... for now Gauff has Sabalenka stretching and now a break point. The momentum has most definitely turned. The American is certainly the one in control here on Arthur Ashe.The sequence of Gauff's ability to reach almost-unreachable balls before Sabalenka rattles off another laser is quite incredible. On this occassion, Sabelenka wins the point and saves the break. 21:48 Wild start to the third set Sabalenka's play is both equally mesmerizing and perplexing. Thrashes a forehand winner for 15-0, fires an overhead into the net. Then, a crushing backhand cross-court for 30-15 before a sloppy shot into the net. And here we have 30-30 21:45 Brave effort from Gauff After Sabalenka won the first set in 40 minutes, despite a litany on unforced errors, Gauff roared back claiming the second in 44. 21:44 Gauff takes second set 6-3 Sabalenka cannot overcome Gauff's retrieval skills as well this set. Two set points for Gauff - and she takes it! Now, she takes it before heading down the tunnel for what looks to be a bathroom break! 21:39 Sabalenka holds! She trails 5-3 Sabalenka races to 30-0 before a sweet Gauff forehand gets here on the board. The Belarussian makes Gauff serve for it. 21:32 Gauff holds, leading 5-2 Gauff refuses to let Sabalenka in on this service game - she leads 40-15 and closes it out. She is in a promising position to level it at a set apiece. 21:29 Sabalenka holds thanks to the shot of the day! Gauff leads 4-2 I said earlier Gauff had the best shot of the day, forget that! Wow, what a point by these women, Gauff looked to have somehow won the point with a lob before Sabalenka answered with a forehand lob on the turn to perfectly to have a chance of closing this game. And she does! 21:23 Gauff holds on to lead 4-1 It's that forehand again for Sabalenka. So often, it's been a weapon but also her kryptonite. She hits into the net and Gauff can close out her serve here. The Belarussian hits long and Gauff crucially keeps the break. 21:22 The breaths did not work! Sabalenka now with a chance to break! The emotional Belarussian takes a few moments to compose herself before hitting a wild forehand to bring back deuce. 21:21 Chance for Sabalenka here Sabalenka gets the luckiest of bounces off the net and somehow stayed in before rattling a forehand at Gauff who cannot return it. She's up 15-30 but hits one of her powerful strokes longer. 21:18 Gauff breaks and leads 3-1! Sabalenka goes long and now finally has an opening. Break point for the American. The No. 2 seed goes way long on the first serve and misses the second too! Gauff leads 3-1. 21:16 Coco with the shot of the day! Another tense battle here in the fourth service game of the second set. Sabalenka with the chance to closr it out at 40-30 - and she can't! Gauff somehow tracks the ball down and fires a bullet cross-court backhand to bring up deuce. 21:11 Gauff holds and leads the second 2-1 Just as Gauff was looking like running away with the service game, Sabelnka rattles off a forehand. No matter, she wins it the very next point. 21:08 Sabalenka holds and it's 1-1 The Belarussian holds. 21:07 Sabalenka rolling on serve Sabalenka shows how unstoppable she can be with a tremendous cross-court forehand for a 30-15 lead. A way off forehand from Gauff gives Sabalenka the chance to bring parity to the second set. 21:04 Gauff somehow holds to lead 1-0 Gauff is really struggling but Sabalenka can't capitalize on two break points. Three straight points for Gauff and she wins her first service game on a Sabalenka error. Big let-off. 21:01 Second set underway! 21:00 Hear the Belarussian roar 20:57 Sabalenka takes the first set 6-2! And she takes it as Gauff hits into the net! Storming performance from the Belarussian early. 20:56 Set point Sabalenka Sabalenka has two sets points after a cheeky finish at the net. Gauff wins one back in large part thanks to a net cord. 20:52 Sabalenka breaks - and leads 5-2! A lackluster shot from Gauff lands in the net and Sabalenka will serve for the set 20:52 Break points for the Belarussian Sabalenka races to a 15-40 lead on Gauff's serve. Goes without saying, she's in real strife here in the first set. 20:50 Sabalenka 4-2 Gauff The Belarussian screams 'come on' after holding serve. As one would imagine, the crowd quietens. 20:48 Adv Sabalenka The first ace of the match 116mph from Sabalenka! Back to Deuce we go. What a rally that was from the ladies, and it's Sabalenka with the advantage after a big overhead. 20:46 Break point for Gauff Finally, something of real quality! Sabalenka drills a forehand into the far corner with Gauff no chance -- Deuce. The Belarussian goes long on a forehand and it's break point #2 for Gauff. 20:45 Sabalenka 3-2 Gauff A lot of errors from both players throughout this service game and the match more broadly.-- 30-30. And now Gauff has break point - couldn't, could she? 20:43 Sabalenka 3-2 Gauff Sabalenka continues to tally up the errors, and is furious at a forehand which ended up in the net. She reallies for 15-15 20:39 Sabalenka breaks again! She'll get another chance as Gauff hits long. Third break point chance for the Belarussian. Gauff can't contend with the power and is broken for the second time this set! 20:38 Sabalenka misses from point blank The longer the points go, the likelier Gauff seems to win them. Fifth game posied evenly here at 30-30 - and Gauff gifts a break point chance with a backhand into the net. The American delivers a beastly forehand of her own to make it 40-40. Wow!! Sabalenka again had the break in her hand but once more volleys into the net. 20:34 Gauff breaks! 2-2 She's blown one with a sloppy forehand. 30-40 in favor of Gauff. Sabalenka had Gauff on toast but couldn't clear the net and we're level! 20:32 Break point chances Talk about struggles - now, it's Sabalenka who trials 0-30 after a dobule fault. Of course, it's a crushing forehand to bring her to 15-30. Another double fault!! Gauff with two break points here! 20:28 Sabalenka 2-1 Gauff Gauff goes to 30-0 up before an error welcomes Sabalenka in. That door is slammed shut by a whipped forehand down the line for 40-15. A Sabalenka forehand into the net and that's game for Gauff. 20:26 Sabalenka 2-0 Gauff And Sabalenka breezes through her first service game. Gauff's only point came on a double fault from the No. 2. 20:25 1-0 Sabalenka Sabalenka's striking of a ball is definitely her superpower and it's showing early. Gauff is definitely struggling with the pace, down 30-0 on the Belarussian's serve. 20:22 Break! Sabalenka 1-0 Sabalenka silences the crowd with a devastating forehand and takes the earliest of breaks! 20:21 Break point blown by Sabalenka Gauff loses the first but ties at 15-15 after a Sabalenka error, bringing an expectedly large roar from the Ashe crowd. Coco balloons a forehand into the air, almost looking like a tribute to a college football punt. Sabalenka hits another unforced error to bring it to 30-30. Break point for Sabalenka as Gauff struggles to settle. Wow, Sabalenka can't hit a backhand volley over the net and blows it. 20:17 We're underway - Gauff to serve!

Flintoff, 45, returned to the public eye on Friday for the first time since being hospitalised with facial injuries and broken ribs suffered in a crash while filming a new series of Top Gear last December, with the shoot now suspended pending a health and safety review into the incident. Working in an unpaid capacity , the 2005 Ashes hero will be part of England's backroom team for their ODIs against New Zealand this month. Keen to follow in his footsteps and become an all-rounder capable of national treasure status, Liam Livingstone is loving being back in Flintoff's presence. The pair played together in two T20s for Lancashire's Second team during 'Freddie's' short-lived comeback in 2014 after retiring five years previously, and Livingstone is desperate to soak up more of his wealth of experience. Andrew Flintoff's facial injuries, health update and Richard Hammond's four-word response Andrew Flintoff update after Top Gear horror crash left England legend badly injured \"It's incredible to have him,\" the Lancashire star beamed. \"He's obviously been one of my heroes growing up. To have someone of his experience lingering around the dressing room is great for all the lads. \"When you see someone like Fred around, it's always good to chat. Especially while you’re batting: there's three and a half hours to pick the brains of someone who’s been there and done it. \"He's probably a national hero, everybody loves that Fred's joining us and I’m sure he’ll enjoy it as much himself. Over the next week or so, I'm sure he'll have plenty of laughs inside there.\" Have your say! Should Andrew Flintoff continue as a coach for England? Join the debate in the comments section . Andrew Flintoff remains patched up ( Image: Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Popperfoto via Getty Images) Flintoff isn't expected to continue with England beyond the ODIs clashes with New Zealand, the first of which England lost by eight wickets as they prepare to defend their World Cup crown. Ahead of the match, the 45-year-old was seen with visible scars on his face and tape on his nose while leading fielding drills with England's players in Cardiff. Captain Jos Buttler said it was \"great\" to have Flintoff around, adding: \"He's obviously an England legend and it's just nice to have him around the group. He's not been brought in with any specific role, just to be around and observe. A few of the lads can pick his brains a little bit and he's settled in really well. It's great to have him with us. Just for this series.\" After being involved in a crash on December 13, Flintoff received medical care at the scene before being taken to hospital for further treatment. In March, the BBC made an apology to Flintoff and said that it'd continue to support him during his recovery.

Labuschagne was even quicker, reaching his second one-day international century off 80 balls.Both his hundreds have been made in the country of his birth. He hit 108 in Potchefstroom in March 2020.“The boys at the top got us off to a lightning start and put pressure on the bowlers,” said Labuschagne, who said the fact that he had not been selected for the World Cup was “not in my control - I am concentrating on enjoying my cricket and playing as well as I can.” It was Australia’s third-highest total in the 50-overs format and the fourth-highest conceded by South Africa.“They were on top of us from ball one,” admitted Bavuma.","pubDate":"2023-09-09 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","source_priority":608587,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c7adb3542b9332c2697d0f023aa363c2","title":"Wayne’s regret: Super coach’s tears over marriage breakdown","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/nrl/wayne-bennetts-new-book-tears-shed-for-broken-marriage/news-story/2ea74b69df02b42a9e5859184ffa8c21","keywords":["Books","Dolphins","NRL News"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rugby league super coach Wayne Bennett has broken his silence on the breakdown of his 42-year marriage and his secret affair, shedding tears as he described ex-wife Trish as a “special person”.","content":"Bennett’s revelations come as his new long-term partner, Dale Cage, opened up on her own heartache, claiming she has been labelled a homewrecker and a victim of social-media abuse for the past seven years.In his new book, The Wolf You Feed, released on Monday, Bennett speaks for the first time about his bust-up with Trish, his two years of infidelity with Dale, and their roles in Australian sport’s bizarre love triangle.The 73-year-old also shares intimate details of meeting Dale, the strength of Trish in largely caring for their two heavily-disabled kids and the repercussions of broken family bonds over the affair that shocked a nation.“Nobody thought I’d do what I did,” Bennett says candidly.His daughter Beth speaks with candour about her father’s obsession with rugby league, while Trish takes aim at former Broncos CEO Paul White for his role in the super coach’s sacking at Brisbane in 2018 amid the Bennett family fallout.It’s a complex story with raw, complex threads, none more so than the relationship triumvirate that is Wayne, Trish and Dale.THE BENNETT BOMBSHELLIn September 2016, Bennett announced he and Trish were separating after more than four decades of marriage.They were seemingly Australia’s unbreakable couple. It was a sentiment fuelled by the ABC’s famous Australia Story profile on the Bennetts on May 3, 1999, when rugby league’s greatest coach opened up like never before, showing his softer side as he and Trish spoke of the challenges of raising two disabled kids, Justin and Katherine.It was one of the most watched stories in Australian Story history. ABC producer Vanessa Gorman said Bennett reached “saintlike proportions” as Australians shed tears at the sight of tungsten-tough Wayne stroking his disabled son Justin’s hair.So when Bennett confirmed he was leaving Trish, to begin a relationship with a mystery woman, later revealed as Dale Cage, 22 years his junior, the halo had slipped.“That’s the whole key to it. Wayne Bennett was never supposed to do that, OK?” he says in his authorised biography, penned by leading sports journalist Andrew Webster.Asked if the Judgement was hard to take, Bennett says: “No. Not hard to take at all.“Those in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. We’re all entitled to make our own decisions, OK?“If I made a decision that you think I shouldn’t have made, that’s not your business.“You can use your own judgement on this.“The journos have absolutely nothing on me. I’m not a punter. I’m not a drinker, I’m not a womaniser who has been in fights, blues, whatever.“But in that moment (when he left Trish), there was a sense that this guy’s human.“This guy is human so let’s give it to him now.“It was way over the top.“The people writing the stories had a shitload in their own closet. That’s the murky world we live in at times and I had to accept it and get on with life.”THE AFFAIRFor the first time, Bennett confirms what was suspected – that he began a physical relationship with Cage while still married to Trish.Bennett reveals he first met Cage late in 2013. He was coach of Newcastle. She was practice manager at a nearby office run by Newcastle doctor Neil Halpin, who would treat injured Knights players.The Knights had suddenly stopped paying Halpin for his services. The NRL club was on the brink of bankruptcy.Knights staff told Bennett about Halpin’s “cranky secretary” who had refused appointment because Newcastle weren’t paying their bills, so the coach tried to sort out the mess.“I’m here to see Dale,” Bennett recalls in the book.“Well, you found her,” she shot back. “But you might have to make an appointment because I’m going to lunch.”“Oh, you’re Dale.”“Yes.”“You’re not what I was expecting.”“What were you expecting?”“Someone who was old and cranky.”Webster writes Bennett joined her for lunch. The super coach, then 63, was, according to Cage, 41 at the time, “taken aback by my confidence”.Four days later, Halpin’s bill was paid.In the months that followed, Bennett would regularly pop up in Halpin’s waiting room holding two coffees.“From then on, we became best friends,” Cage recalls. “There was an instant connection.”THE FALLOUTIn the book, Webster writes: “For years, Bennett had moralised about people’s behaviour, but in the eyes of many people, particularly those with an axe to grind, his unfaithfulness to Trish was the lowest of acts.“For many, a switch had been flicked: Wayne Bennett, coach and former Father of the Year, was now just a man with a dirty secret, and the dirty secret was plastered all over the front of the Sunday rags.“What about this bloke?” one of his former players said to the author. “It’s a disgrace that he has done this to Trish.”When Bennett was sacked by Brisbane two years after his marriage breakdown became public, there was a view his off-field love dramas were impacting his work. Broncos insiders often referenced the Wayne soap opera. But Bennett hits out at suggestions his affair tainted his commitment to coaching.“Dale was a distraction to everybody because nobody thought I’d do what I did,” he said.“But it never stopped me from coaching.“We made the 2015 grand final – I was taking her out then. We made the semi-finals the year after. The preliminary final the year after that. The Broncos didn’t like Dale, but they all knew Trish well. I get it.“There were staff there who had been divorced. I wasn’t Robinson Crusoe. But there’s different rules for Wayne. There always has been. Wayne’s never been in that other place; he’s always been judged differently. That’s OK. He’s handled it.“My players didn’t care. There was one person who put himself in that place of being the judge and jury.“That’s the only person I can think of.”Bennett refuses to name that person but the finger is often pointed at former Broncos boss White, the man who sacked the super coach by voicemail in December 2018.The pair were friends for 34 years. A devout Catholic who attends mass every Sunday, White is married to long-time wife Angela, who remains a close friend of Trish Bennett.But White refutes suggestions he sacked Bennett partly because of his off-field dramas.“I’m not the moral police,” he says in the book. “I never made a moral judgement. I thought I was good support (for Wayne). He’s completely misinterpreted that.”THE OTHER WOMANIn the book, Webster describes Bennett and Cage as the ‘Brangelina’ of Brisbane.The pair made their first public appearance at Brisbane restaurant Montrachet in March 2017, six months after Bennett announced his marriage with Trish was over.“I was called a homewrecker,” Cage says. “They also misreported my age. I copped a lot of abuse online at the time and it’s still happening.“No-one has asked me for my side of the story. It’s been really weird.“All this stuff has been printed and said about me and I’m thinking, ‘Why has nobody rung me to fact-check or get my side of the story. Not one person. Maybe they were too scared to call me.”The Sunday Mail has made several requests since late 2016 to interview Cage. She rejected every request.Now 51, the mother of three says she struggled to come to terms with initial descriptions of her. They included secret blonde, buxom blonde, vivacious blonde and Benny’s blonde bombshell who was “a good sort, popular and fun”.“All these labels that were being thrown around about me,” Cage says.“I saw my face on the front page, the back page, the middle pages.“The buxom blonde bombshell ... I’ve never recovered from that day.“Whether it was my paranoia or not, I felt like I couldn’t walk down the street without feeling these things.”It has been reported previously that Bennett and Cage have split several times. Both insist that is rubbish. Cage was by Bennett’s side at the Redcliffe Dolphins’ inaugural NRL awards night on Thursday night.Cage believes she was never accepted by the Broncos because of the club’s loyalty to Trish. She says Bennett cannot go a single day without talking to her.“He liked me to come to matches and functions, but I wanted to stay at home and be a hermit,” Cage says.“Wayne’s very good at blocking out outside noise and just focusing on his job. But I had no idea. I was thrown into it.“People picked a side and Wayne worked out quickly who his friends were, and who wasn’t.“We can spend days together, and not do anything nor see anything, not get sick of each other.“Then when we are apart, he’ll call me three or four times a day. From the time we’ve been together, he’s called me every morning and every night.“He comes across as arrogant, but he’s definitely not that. He’s just shy – with very old-school values.”TRISH BENNETTThere are two times in the book when Wayne Bennett cries. One involves talking about his first love Trish.The author had asked Bennett if he could assist in setting up an interview with his ex-wife.“No,” Bennett said, lowering his head into his hands.He then raises his head choking back tears.“She’s a special person,” Bennett says of Trish.Seven years after the split, the pair are not legally divorced. They have a private financial agreement to ensure their three children, mainly disabled Justin, now 46, and 41-year-old Katherine, never have to struggle.It is understood Bennett and Trish still talk most days, mainly in relation to care requirements for Justin.When former Broncos chairman Don Nissen died of cancer in 2022, it was Trish who called her ex-husband to pass on the sad news. Bennett calls her ‘T’ when he answers the phone.“She is his North Star,” says Bennett’s daughter Beth.“She still is. Without her, none of this (Bennett’s remarkable coaching career) happens.”Trish’s closest friends have described her as a “saint”. In the Australian Story documentary, there is one segment where Bennett and son Justin are watching a replay of a Broncos-Souths game. Trish is beside Wayne, glasses on, behind a desk, studiously counting each tackle made by a Brisbane player and jotting it down on a piece of paper.In the book, Trish declines to discuss Bennett’s affair, but says the key to their relationship, ironically, was her honesty with him.“I tell him the truth,” she says. “I let him go away and think about it.“People don’t always tell him what he needs to hear. Sometimes, he doesn’t see the real picture.”Asked if Trish has ever spoken poorly about her father, Beth replies: “Never.”BATTLING DISABILITYIt took more than 40 years for the Bennetts to get a formal diagnosis for their disabled son Justin.In 2019, Justin was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a rare and lifelong form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life.In 1977, Justin had an allergic reaction to the whooping-cough vaccine. It was a one in 300,000 event.Trish recalls Justin being four months old when he had his first seizure, which lasted two hours.“That’s when brain damage occurred,” Wayne Bennett says. “With each seizure, he suffered more brain damage.”Today, Justin is 110kg and wheelchair bound after undergoing a hip replacement. Bennett says he has about 30 tablets a day, but since the Dravet diagnosis, the seizures have eased.During his most recent stint at the Broncos, Bennett had a mattress in his office in case Justin needed a sleep.“It’s taken a long time to diagnose the epilepsy that he has,” Trish says. “He’s had all sorts of seizures.“The worst drug for Dravet is Dilantin. Justin had been on it since he was 18 months old. It took us six months to wean him off that and since then, there’ve been no seizures.“He was given to us to look after.”Almost four years after Justin’s birth, sister Katherine arrived. She was born with arthrogryposis, a complex congenital condition that relates to thin, weak and atrophied joints and muscles throughout the body.Wayne recalls walking into the delivery room to find a “mangled mess”.“It was a shock because she was very twisted,” Trish says. “We’d never heard of the condition that she had, which is arthrogryposis. She had club feet. Her feet were sitting on her tummy. Her arms were extended because she couldn’t bend her elbows.“People say to you all the time, ‘I don’t know how you do it’. You start to worry, ‘How do I do it?’“You do it because you don’t have any choice. You want to go places but then Justin has a seizure and you can’t go. Anyway, that’s life.”Wayne adds: “Justin doesn’t care about my dramas in life. He needs his dad and he needs to play a game of cricket now, and he needs me to be silly, and he needs me to laugh and cuddle him.“I haven’t been able to come home and really brood and be sour and lock myself away. I tried to, but then Justin comes looking for me.”THE OTHER CHILDBeth Ikin (nee Bennett) is entitled to have middle-child syndrome. Now 44, the mother of four is married to former Broncos premiership-winner Ben Ikin, whose relationship with his father-in-law became highly strained after revelations of Bennett’s affair.While Justin and Katherine needed most care, Beth built a fortitude steeled by the sentiment that her famous father was wedded to two people _ Trish and rugby league.“You get to an age when you start to realise that you’re coming second,” Beth says in the book, recalling Bennett leaving the family to embark on another football camp.“There was always an open dialogue, but football was his whole world.“If he didn’t talk about that, there was nothing else to talk about.”When Bennett left the Broncos to join Souths in 2019, a Rabbitohs staffer spotted him writing on a birthday card.“This is for one of my grandkids,” Bennett said. “My daughter (Beth) doesn’t talk to me anymore, but I still send them a card so they know I care for them.”Bennett recently attended his grandson’s 21st birthday, but the super coach is not sure he will ever totally repair the cracks with Ikin.He says Beth is like “talking to myself”, but her adoration for her mother is palpable.“Maybe I can convince you to write a chapter called the X-factor and cross out the X and put a T (for Trish),” Beth says.“Without her, even if he was single, he couldn’t have done what he’s done.“We grounded him. When the pendulum shifted, and everyone loved him, he’d come home and get sledged by us.“(Mum) looked after the house, made sure it was all tickety-boo. He could fully focus knowing he had a beautiful home to come back to, knowing that he could take off without missing a beat because mum made sure it all ran properly.“The North Star.“Rugby league is where he felt safest. Because it embraced him when nothing else in his whole world did.“There was a certainty to it. You only grow out of that when you deal with your trauma, and I don’t think he has.“He did a really good job of trying to grow out of it, and separate himself from it, but I don’t think he’s dealt with it.”MAN IN THE MIRRORThe trauma to which Beth refers may have deep-seated roots in his alcoholic father Jim, who walked out on the family when Bennett was 12.It could be the trauma of Justin and Katherine. Or the trauma of a broken marriage no-one saw breaking.Whatever the trauma, it seems to drive Bennett, even today as Dolphins coach.There’s another traumatic memory that drives him, one not even Trish knows about ... until now.“I’m a policeman,” Bennett recalls.“I’m on the corner of Queen and Edward Streets in Brisbane.“I’m 20 years of age. I saw this young man selling newspapers on the corner.“He was intellectually disabled: that’s how he got some income. He had a seizure, hit the gutter and busted his face open. I was there so I had to do something, get an ambulance.“I was not to know that I was going to have an intellectually disabled son. I remember that guy every day of my life because I didn’t want my son to have nothing; to go out and do a job like that.“It’s stayed with me all these years. Still now.“All the things I have done have been for those two children of mine because I never want them to rely on the government when I’m not here.“Because the government will let them down.“Trish and myself, we’ve never let them down.“That’s the thing that’s driven me. More than anything else in my life.”The Wolf You Feed: Wayne Bennett – The Man, The Myth, The Mayhem by Andrew Webster. Macmillan Australia. RRP $36.99.

FirstCricket Staff Last Updated:September 10, 2023 00:47:15 IST File image of BCCI secretary Jay Shah. Twitter/@JayShah The focus of the cricketing community all over the world is firmly on the ICC World Cup even if the tournament is a little under a month away from kickoff. The build-up to the quadrennial mega event however, has been far from smooth for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with the announcement of the tournament schedule as well as the sale of tickets getting delayed. The World Cup schedule, which normally gets announced a year before the tournament, was announced on Tuesday, 27 June. That schedule, however, did not turn out to be the final one with several matches, including the high-profile India vs Pakistan showdown, getting rescheduled. Additionally, fans have been having a hard time purchasing match tickets, the sale of which had been delayed due to the late announcement of the schedule as well as the subsequent changes.

As a result, the BCCI has been working diligently to finalise all aspects of the tournament, including venue availability, team schedules, and other essential arrangements,” Shah said in an interview on Sportstar . In order to manage the massive demand for tickets in the cricket-mad nation, the BCCI has decided to release another 4,00,000 tickets after speaking with state associations. The “general sale of tickets” for all matches in the tournament had gone live from 8 pm on Friday, 8 September and those for the semi-finals and final will go live from Friday, 15 September.

The scale and diversity of India require meticulous planning, coordination, and execution to ensure the tournament’s success and seamless experience for players, fans, and stakeholders,” Shah added.

Team India are yet to play a game in the Super Fours and will hope that the rain stays away on Sunday, September 10 with the heavens opening up only in their matches so far in the tournament. The first India-Pakistan clash was washed out due to rain while the Men in Blue chased down a DLS-adjusted target in the second game against Nepal. The Sri Lanka-Bangladesh encounter remained interruption-free as even though the clouds did get dark a couple of times, the heavens didn't open up but the forecast isn't looking encouraging enough for the India-Pakistan match. The match begins at 3 PM local time in Colombo and the rain prediction stands at 92 per cent, which is the highest during the whole day. It's 91 per cent an hour before the match and it doesn't look encouraging enough for a timely start. The probability reduces to 87 per cent at 4 PM but stays in high 80s for the rest of the evening - 89 at 5 PM, 87 at 6 PM, 88 at 7 PM, 89 at 8 PM, 88 at 9 PM, 86 at 10 PM and 91 at 11 PM. If the forecast is anything to go by, we will be lucky to have any game on Sunday, September 10. Thankfully, there's a reserve day in place but the fans and the players, especially the Indian team will hope that the result is achieved on Sunday itself, given they have to play against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, September 12. Pakistan already have two points in the Super Fours and with the rest of the five games of the tournament slated to be held in Colombo, the forecast needs to get better rather quickly otherwise, there's a threat of the tournament becoming a damp squib.","pubDate":"2023-09-09 19:02:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
