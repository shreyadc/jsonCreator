In reality, even 150,000 might be a conservative estimate, such is the great significance of the rivalry, and the rarity in which new editions are held. In 2019, about 800,000 fans applied to attend the World Cup showdown between India and Pakistan at the 26,000-seater Old Trafford. Catch the T20 World Cup Live on Kayo.

Start your free trial now > It’s not a stretch to say India vs Pakistan is sport’s greatest rivalry, given the geopolitics involved between the two warring nations, who have a combined population of nearly two billion — many of which are cricket mad. The world’s greatest rivalries are always about more than sport, and the long-lasting feud between India and Pakistan is the best proof of that.

The partition was created along religious lines with Muslim and non-Muslim majorities divided, triggering riots, a massive refugee crisis, and huge casualties estimated between 200,000 and two million people. Muslims headed towards Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs towards India, but Himalayan territory Kashmir remained a disputed region — as it still is today. India and Pakistan have waged war against each other over Kashmir three times, most notably in 1947 and 1965, although there have been many more armed conflicts. Most recently, there was gunfire and shelling between India and Pakistan forces between late 2020 and early 2021. Tensions have run high when India and Pakistan have done battle in the cricket arena as well, with one commentator calling the clashes “war minus shooting” As such, the two nations have been stopped from playing each other at home, and only face-off at World Cups or the Asia Cup. Even then, India has already determined that it will not travel to Pakistan for next year’s Asia Cup, thus putting the entire tournament in jeopardy. In response, Pakistan has threatened to go tit for tat by pulling out of the ODI World Cup, which India is due to host in the same year. India vs Pakistan could be sport’s greatest rivalry. Source: Getty Images Indian cricket board secretary Jay Shah -- who is also president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) -- said Tuesday that India “can’t” send a team to Pakistan, adding the tournament would be moved to a neutral venue. His announcement caught Pakistan by surprise, with officials warning it could “split” the international cricket community. Despite being considered one of sport’s greatest rivalries, India and Pakistan have not met on home soil in any version of the game since 2012. It is now within this renewed unrest between the two nations that they will face-off in their T20 World Cup opening fixture at the MCG on Sunday (7pm). India and Pakistan have not met on home soil in any version of the game since 2012. Source: Getty Images Shastri said that whenever India plays Pakistan, the demand for tickets is always so high that he cannot escape the optimistic demands of others. “My biggest worry — I was a player, I was a coach and now I come in as a broadcaster — I will land in Australia and the day after my phone will start buzzing for tickets,” Shastri said. “‘Can I have tickets please?’ And I tell them, ‘I am not a ticket printer. I am no longer a coach, I am no longer a player, I am not a ticket printer. Sorry, mate. I can’t help you there’.” Despite the bitterness of the rivalry, Shastri said that there is a respect between today’s players. “There’s great camaraderie there,” he said. “There’s great mutual respect. “The pressure is massive, but among the two teams there’s great mutual respect.” India wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant said he gets goosebumps playing India’s arch rivals, calling it “a different kind of feeling” to any other team. “It’s always special playing against Pakistan because there is a special hype around that match,” Pant told the official World Cup website Friday. “There are so much emotions involved, not only for us, but the fans and everyone. “It’s a different kind of feeling, a different kind of ambience when you go on to the field and when you take on the field, you see people cheering here and there. “It’s a different atmosphere and when we were singing our national anthem, I actually get goosebumps.” India lost to Pakistan at this year’s Asia Cup, and at last year’s T20 World Cup.

In a conversation, Shaheen said, “Shaheen is an attacking bowler. He likes to take wickets. He has the ability to use his pace to beat the batsmen. For that, he does a lot of swinging the ball. By doing that, the balls come straight to the batsmen and become leg-before wickets. To deal with him, the batsmen ‘V'” Let’s deal with shape strategy.

Australia’s wicket-keeper batter Josh Inglis, on his hand while playing at the Golf course, so much so that he needed to be taken to the hospital. The news meant that stars had aligned perfectly for the Aussie allrounder Cameron Green, who had impressed one and all during the away T20I series against India a few weeks ago, with a couple of top-quality knocks while opening the batting. With Green roped in as his direct replacement in the 15-member squad, the Australian squad now comprises just a lone specialist wicket-keeper batter option in Matthew Wade. During an interaction with Australia’s leg-spinner Adam Zampa came up with some hilarious reasons which made sure that the in-form Cameron Green somehow made it to the Australian T20 World Cup 2022 squad. The host initially joked around the possibility that the Aussie squad members might have stopped playing Golf altogether after what happened to Josh Inglis the other day. Zampa, in the quirky mood himself, doubled up the host’s game to exclaim that while Cameron Green is now not allowed at the Golf course, the management had earlier made sure that someone in the previous 15-member squad got injured by hook-or-crook to make way for the allrounder ahead of their opening World Cup match against New Zealand. Describing the imaginary, yet hilarious set of events that could possibly have injured at least one Aussie player, Zampa went, “Greeny’s not allowed at the Golf Course.

If Australia’s maiden T20 World Cup success last year told you anything, it was that it is very hard to qualify for the semi-finals if you lose more than one match. South Africa lost just one pool match but because of their poor net run rate missed the knockout stages. It means Australia must beat England or risk missing the knockout stages unless an upset is pulled off by the likes of Afghanistan, who boast the brilliant Rashid Khan, along the way.

Ricky Ponting continued in that proud trend in 2003 as he batted first against India in the World Cup final. That way is now long gone, with the world following the MS Dhoni way. In the lead-in matches against England, Aaron Finch won the toss and sent the opposition in to bat purely on the basis of wanting to practice their run-chases. Well, two defeats, and surely a third had rain not intervened, did not help. Nor did sending New Zealand in on what appeared to be a road. Aaron Finch’s Australian side failed to contain New Zealand. Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images Finn Allen quickly put an end to the debate of his selection over Martin Guptill, smashing Australia’s world class fast-bowling trio of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. In the end Australia was 201 to win. For a side with a number of players struggling, the runchase was always likely to prove too much and indeed it did. DID AUSTRALIA FALL INTO THE MITCH MARSH TRAP OF 2021? Australia lost one match during last year’s World Cup success: a crushing eight-wicket defeat to England. It came after Australia surprisingly dropped Mitch Marsh, who had been the best performer all year in a side that had struggled. Australia may well have lost even if Marsh played, but the decision to leave the first-drop out appeared to rock the side. Team dynamics are funny things, and the axing of one of the most popular members of the side seemed perplexing and proved to be a poor one after the dust was settled. Ultimately, Marsh returned the next game and Australia never looked back. Australia's Steve Smith was controversially dropped ahead of the final few matches ahead of the T20 World Cup. Photo: AFP Source: AFP Smith’s non-selection was hardly surprising, but it was startling in other ways. He is one of the world’s best batters - a player who less than two years ago scored consecutive centuries from 62 balls against India at the SCG - and someone who gives others confidence in the dressing sheds.. His absence was discussed heavily by World Cup winner Michael Clarke, who was flabbergasted by the decision to drop him. Clarke found support in former NRL and NSW State of Origin great Laurie Daley, who spoke about what the aura players can have. “I’ve spoken about this in footy, and I assume cricket is the same, when you look around the dressing shed or during a game, and you might be under the pump, but when you look around and you might have Steve Smith, Warner ... you’re still confident but if you haven’t got that type of player in your team, you’re sitting back wondering if you can still win,” he responded to Clarke on the Big Sports Breakfast. Clarke added: “My reason always for (including) someone like a Steve Smith in your team is because not all conditions are the same, if we lose two for not many, you’ve got one of the world’s best batsmen coming in. “Steve Smith can save you a game as well, he can find you a way of getting to 170 and have a total to defend rather than being bowled out for 100. “I still think in T20 cricket you need one of those players in your top six batsmen.” Like Marsh against England last year, Smith may not have won the match with the bat alone - but his presence, his cricket brain in the field, and presence with the pads on the edge of the ground, could have helped. Phillips flies for ALL-TIME catch! | 00:35 WHAT CHANGES, IF ANY? Australia has a quick three-day turnaround to get their campaign back on track. Sri Lanka were shocked by Namibia but you can never rule out the proud cricket nation from causing an upset. Will Australia make changes? It was a question former New Zealand wicket-keeper batter Ian Smith asked. “Where will Australia go from here?” Smith asked Shane Watson in commentary as Australia lost their ninth wicket. “This game is not over but there’s a big bench there, there’s some experience on that bench and this competition means quick decisions.” Watson, who came through a period most Australian cricketers, including himself, were afforded second chances. “One thing the Australians have done is they normally stick to what they know,” he said. “And they’re going to have to, because you can’t just allow one loss to make things go a little bit too hectic. “There’s going to be a lot of questions asked. “Australia have got to keep the path, they’ve got to stay on track with their game-plan, they committed to it quite a while ago, three or four months ago with Aaron Finch and Dave Warner at the top, they committed to Steve Smith moving out from number four and now there’s going to be some questions around whether that was the right commitment. “For me, they did make the right choices and now they’ve got to stick strong with it.” Australia’s middle-order options from Tim David (L), Marcus Stoinis (2nd L), Cameron Green (2nd r) and Mitch Marsh (R). Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images Watson is right, Australia is unlikely to make any changes but they do have options. Smith can do a job and be an insurance player in the middle while Cameron Green, who was a last-minute call up for the injured Josh Inglis, could allow Australia to be creative with their line-up. But would they take a gamble and drop one of their three quicks? Unlikely. Nathan Ellis is another player who might be considered, but as Watson said, Australia is likely to be conservative with their selection. IS IT OVER BEFORE IT REALLY STARTED Australia’s World Cup title defence dangles by a thread. In fact, it’s possible that Australia isn’t even in last chance saloon, but is already doomed for an early exit. Given only two teams progress to the semi finals from a pool of six, only one loss can have dire consequences at the World Cup. Just look at South Africa last year. The Proteas narrowly lost their first match of the tournament to Australia and, despite winning each of their remaining matches, they couldn’t recover. Their 4-1 record handed them an identical ratio to Australia and England, who topped the pool, but South Africa went home with an inferior net run rate. Australia, meanwhile, scraped through and went on to win the entire tournament. But now it’s Australia who might’ve just left its fate out of its hands - even it was to win all four of its remaining games. In truth, that’s an awfully tall order considering the form the team is in and the calibre of opponent that is to come. Aaron Finch of Australia leaves the field after being dismissed by Mitchell Santner in Sydney, Australia. Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images Australia will be expected to beat Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, although neither nation will be a walkover, while there should be an internal review that rivals Sandpapergate if Finch’s side was to lose to Ireland. Even if Australia negotiates those banana peels, there’s still the matter of playing England in Melbourne on October 28. Australia is fresh from losing 2-0 to England in a three-match series. At the last World Cup, England hammered Australia in the pool stage by eight wickets. Beating England at this point feels awfully tough for Australia unless it can rediscover the magic. Should Australia lose to England, it will need to beat Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Ireland, and hope that the loser of England vs New Zealand suffers an upset against one of the three smaller cricketing nations, and ends with a lower net run rate. DID AUSTRALIA SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT? As Australia lost its three-match series against England a week before starting the World Cup, Aaron Finch admitted Australia was fatigued. “I think the guys are probably a little bit tired at the moment,” Finch said. “The schedule has been so packed over the last six to eight weeks that we identified a couple of months ago that we wanted to make sure that we’re in a position to be peaking at the right time of the World Cup and not beforehand. “So it’s going to be important over the next couple of days to try and freshen everyone up as much as we can.” And fair enough. Australia had just played series against Zimbabwe, New Zealand and the West Indies, as well as going on a tour of India in the space of little over a month. No wonder the players were starting to feel the pinch, and the results were starting to go south. Australia has played a ton of T20 matches over the past two months. Photo: AFP Source: AFP It should also come as no surprise that just a week after that final England match, Australia still looked far from a rejuvenated unit on Saturday. Australia played another match after that England series, a warm-up match against India on Monday, before finally trying to freshen up for game one against New Zealand. It didn’t take long on Saturday to see what team was better prepared. Finn Allen had the glint in his eye and promptly smoked Mitchell Starc for 14 runs in the first over, which included a six on just the third ball. All of Australia’s bowlers were expensive on the night and, in the chase, the hosts appeared to throw in the towel early. Shane Watson said Australia looked like a spent force just three balls into the match. “Australia, you could just see their energy evaporate from the second or third ball of Mitchell Starc’s first over and they just weren’t able to get it back,” Watson said. Things won’t get much better from here either. Australia must now get on a long flight across the country to Perth and front up again on Tuesday night.","pubDate":"2022-10-22 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs IRE Dream11 Team Prediction, Match Preview, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s SL vs IRE T20 World Cup 2022 match No 15 in Blundstone, 930 AM IST, October 23","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/sl-vs-ire-dream11-team-prediction-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-sl-vs-ire-t20-world-cup-2022-match-no-15-in-blundstone-930-am-ist-october-23-2525586.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka vs Ireland Dream11 Team Prediction Sri Lanka vs Ireland T20 World Cup 2022 Match No. 15 Preview - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of SL vs IRE, Sri Lanka Dream11 Team Player List, Ireland Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":"Kusal Mendis' classy half-century helped Sri Lanka in registering a 16-run win in their ICC Men's T20 World Cup clash against the Netherlands in Geelong on Thursday after a disappointing start to their World Cup campaign.

After being asked to bat first at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), New Zealand put up 200 for 3 in 20 overs. Openers Finn Allen and Devon Conway gave the Kiwis a flying start as they reached 50 inside four overs. Allen struck three sixes and five fours in his 16-ball 42 and scored the runs at a whopping strike-rate of 262.50. Fast bowler Josh Hazlewood finally broke the opening stand in the fifth over by dismissing Allen. Conway, the eventual Player of the Match, remained unbeaten on 92 off 58 deliveries. He hit two sixes and seven fours and scored his runs at a strike rate of 158.62. New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson scored a run-a-ball 23 before Jimmy Neesham struck two sixes towards the end as he contributed with 26 off 13 balls. In reply to that, Australia lost their key batsman David Warner in the second over of their chase. Finch was the second man to go. He scored 13 off 11 balls. Glenn Maxwell, who scored a 20-ball 28, top-scored for the hosts as they were bowled out for 111 runs with 2.5 overs remaining. \"They certainly did (on the New Zealand openers), they set the tone in the first 4 overs and we didn't recover. Needed a big start, that didn't happen and we were outplayed completely. He got off to a flier (on Finn), we needed early wickets which didn't happen and when we chased, we lost too many wickets, we weren't good enough with the net run-rate taking a bad hit. We play Sri Lanka next, four games left, need to win everything and have some luck on our side,\" Finch said at the post-match presentation on Saturday. The win on Saturday marked New Zealand's first T20I win on Australian soil. It was also the BlackCaps' first win Down Under since 2011 and their first white-ball victory against Australia in Australia since February 2009. Meanwhile, New Zealand skipper Williamson praised his side, saying they were \"clinical\" in whatever they did. \"It was one of those days, an outstanding day, the openers set the tone, lots of contributions right through the batting and that was a very good score on this pitch. The bowlers then did well and were well supported in the field. Everyone know their roles in this team, we knew about the quality of their bowling (Australia's), took the game deep and we were very clinical in what we needed to do,\" said Williamson after his side's win at SCG. AUS vs NZ: Finn Allen's game compliments mine, says Devon Conway Conway heaped praise on 23-year-old Allen, saying he's a \"very explosive and fearless\" batsman. \"It was a special performance by the boys tonight. The credit has to go to Finn, how he started and got the momentum for us, pretty good performance from everyone. It (Finn's knock) was pretty special, I have seen him do it time and time again, young guy in international cricket but he's very explosive and fearless. The way Finn plays his game complements my game and I can just bat around him. The surface was very good to bat on and I thought timing the ball would give you more success. It means a lot to us, especially here at the SCG, to beat Australia on any occasion is big, we will take this momentum into the next game,\" added Conway. The Aussies have a two-day break before their next Super 12 fixture, which is against Sri Lanka at Perth Stadium on Tuesday (Oct. 25). New Zealand, on the other hand, next play on Wednesday (Oct. 26) when they face off against Afghanistan at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).","pubDate":"2022-10-22 18:04:01","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/10/22/500x300_1317463-tykt.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: Mark Wood is 'vital, we'll look after him,' says Jos Buttler after England beat Afghanistan","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/t20-world-cup-mark-wood-is-vital-well-look-after-him-says-jos-buttler-after-england-beat-afghanistan-766425","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"England defeated Afghanistan by 5 wickets on SaturdaySam Curran picked up 5 wickets in the first innings He became the first English bowler to claim a 5-for in T20Is","content":"T20 World Cup: Mark Wood is ‘vital, we’ll look after him,’ says Jos Buttler after England beat Afghanistan England captain Jos Buttler heaped praise on Mark Wood and Sam Curran after their five-wicket win over Afghanistan in T20 World Cup on Saturday. Curran, who was named the Player of the Match, became the first English men's bowler to claim a five-wicket haul in T20Is. He finished with figures of 5 for 10 in 3.4 overs as Afghanistan were bowled out for 112 in 19.4 overs at Perth Stadium. The pacing duo of Wood and Ben Stokes picked up two wickets each, while Chris Woakes also made a breakthrough in the first innings. While England would have wanted to chase it down quickly, they did struggle with the bat. Skipper Buttler was removed inside the powerplay after hitting three boundaries. Alex Hales, who was dropped twice, failed to capitalise on his earned lives. World No. 6 T20I batsman Dawid Malan, who faced 30 deliveries, managed only 18 runs, while he could not hit any boundary. While the primary Afghan spinners picked up a wicket each, their team could not stop the runs flow much because of his dropped catches and plenty of midfields. Eventually, Liam Livingstone batted calmly and with his unbeaten 29 off 21 balls, he helped England seal the game in 18.1 overs. Speaking at the post-match presentation, Buttler appreciated his side's excellent fielding effort against Afghanistan. \"Coming into the tournament, there's always a few nerves. We've been playing a lot of cricket to buld up to this point. There's a lot of anticipation. To get out there and get a win under our belt is fantastic. Fielding is a huge part of this game. It was a fantastic effort in the field. Mark Wood is always fun to keep wicket to, he's someone who can create catches like that, delighted to hang on to that. He's very vital. He's been backing up games and has been a great asset. He's in a good place and we'll try to look after him,\" said Buttler after England's win in Perth. Talking about Curran's role as a death bowler, Buttler said that the young pacer has \"got great character for that role.\" \"He's thriving with the extra responsibility. He enjoys the tough moments. He demands the ball in those situations which is a great attitude to have. The most pleasing thing about Sam is he always wants to bowl. Felt like the ball swung early, Afghanistan have a talented bowling attack, we were challenged and we had to pay respect to the bowlers. It could have been more fluent but I thought Afghanistan bowled well,\" added Buttler. ENG vs AFG: 'Enjoying my cricket at the moment,' says Sam Curran Curran, who registered the best bowling figures in T20Is by an English bowler on Saturday, said that he would try to be as adaptable as possible with the ball in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022. \"We saw the way the Afghanistan team made it quite tricky, we knew they had world-class spinners in the middle there. Nice to get the first win. Every team can beat anyone. Hopefully, we take today's confidence into Wednesday's game and then the big one against Australia on Friday. Hopefully, we can play with confidence. No better preparation than playing that many games. To come here and start with a win is obviously great. It'll be another tricky game against Ireland. I try to be as adaptable as possible (with the ball). I'm trying to get better at different phases and keep contributing. Really enjoying my cricket at the moment,\" added Curran.

It will be interesting to see the players’ combination both the teams go for, especially in view of the likely overcast conditions likely to be observed throughout the match. In case of 20-Overs-a-side contest, Mohammed Shami might come into the playing XI likely replacing Harshal Patel, who has not been at his clinical best ever since his return from injury. As for Pakistan, with Fakhar Zaman yet to recover from his knee injury, Shan Masood will likely retain his position in the playing XI tomorrow. However, will the management stick with his no.3 position in the batting order, with the opening batters’ strike rate a matter of concern? We will get to know about it in just a few hours.

A shortened game might well bring the batters from both sides exclusively in play, with teams likely to rope in an additional batter into the line-up. Having said that, none of the 14 matches in the World Cup so far have been washed out or have seen a reduction in the number of Overs so far. The fans can perhaps sleep better tonight taking note of this observation as a positive perhaps. The largest stadium in Australia, and the world’s largest Cricket stadium, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), can accommodate approximately over 1,00,00 people (including the standing room). As per verified reports, more than 90,000 tickets were sold out within a few minutes of the ticket purchase window for the Sunday clash between India and Pakistan, which might well mean that the venue might accommodate a record attendance ever in a Cricket match on Sunday.

Two-time champions West Indies were knocked out of the tournament after their heavy defeat to Ireland, with their campaign lasting just three matches. After an opening loss against Scotland in Hobart, West Indies eked out a victory over Zimbabwe before losing to Ireland in a winner-takes-it all game. “It’s a disgrace,” Ponting said at the SCG ahead of the opening Super 12s match between Australia and New Zealand here on Saturday. “It’s so bad for their cricket. They’ve got too much talent in that team and in West Indies cricket not to be able to make it through to the next stage of a World Cup. “And even one of their main players not making it to the flight to get over here for a World Cup… To me this sort of sums up probably how little these events mean to the West Indies players and if you look at the way that they played you’d say the same thing. “(Nicholas) Pooran and these guys, they’re much better players than what we’ve seen over the last couple of weeks so no doubt there’ll be some soul-searching done when they get back. “They’ll be as disappointed as anyone, it’s easy for me to stand here and say that it’s a disgrace that they haven’t made it, but they’ll be hurting as much as anybody. “They would have had big thoughts and dreams coming here and they haven’t played anywhere near well enough to even progress. So they have got some work to do.” West Indies are scheduled to return to Australia next month for a two-Test series. The West Indies, who last played a Test series in Australia in 2015-16, have not won their since 1997. “I didn’t need to see that to make me more worried about the first couple of Test matches,” Ponting said. “But what’s interesting with that, they’ve actually found a way, mainly at home I guess, in the last few years to be reasonably competitive on the Test front with Brathwaite… and Holder, he’s done a really good job in Test cricket for them. “But they’re going to have to find a few lengths if they’re going to compete against the Aussies with the current group that the Australians have got. If you just line them up on paper, there’s no way you think that they could compete. “Cricket’s a funny game, but they’re going to have to play out of their skins I think to make the first two Tests entertaining.” PTI Tags: Ricky Ponting west indies world cup Share Tweet Send Share Suggest A Correction Enter your email to get our daily news in your inbox.

Not just any other match, two neighboring countries who arguably share the in this sport will be facing each other in an ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 match. One of the for the first-ever T20 World Cup in Australia, Melbourne Cricket Ground will be hosting a T20 after eight months. Since hosting Sri Lanka for a couple of T20Is earlier this year, the sports capital of Australia hasn’t hosted any match in the shortest format. Melbourne, which has hosted a total of 98 Men’s T20s since hosting its first one in 2007, will be hosting its first-ever India-Pakistan T20I. Considering the Asian diaspora in the city, an electrifying atmosphere in a packed stadium comprising of around 1,00,000 spectators is in store for a Sunday evening. While cricketers from both the teams hardly feature in the lists of Top 50 highest run-scorers and wicket-takers in Melbourne T20s, Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf is an exception due to his . In seven T20s at this venue, Rauf has picked 11 wickets at an average of 15.73, an economy rate of 6.92 and a strike rate of 13.64. It is due to these economical numbers that Pakistan captain Babar Azam has been vocal about Rauf sharing experience and aiding in building tactics ahead of this match. In the form of sealing a 202-run target, the highest successful run-chase was registered in the second T20 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground almost 16 years ago. It wasn’t a match day but hundreds of Indian fans turned up to watch nets today at the MCG. 🇮🇳🥁👏 — BCCI (@BCCI) Home team Victoria’s efforts remain the only 200+ T20 run-chase at this venue even after so many years.

The win was possible, courtesy of a clinical bowling performance from the English bowlers led by their left-arm medium pacer Sam Curran, who not only registered his career-best bowling figures in the format, but also became only the first English bowler to pick a five-fer in the format, returning with figures of 3.4-0-10-5. With none of the five bowlers conceding more than 8 runs per Over, the Jos Buttler-led side skittled Afghanistan for a paltry 112 off 19.4 Overs. In reply, the English batters uncharacteristically looked in no hurry to chase the total down, and some disciplined by the Afghan bowlers, especially during the middle Overs, did manage to build the required pressure in the form of five crucial wickets. However, the below par target meant that England went past their total in mere 18.1 Overs. No points for guessing, it was Sam Curran, who was adjudged the ‘Player of the Match’ tonight. Sam Curran was born in June 1998 at Northampton, England, but grew up in his family farm is Rusape (a town in Zimbabwe), before migrating out to the United Kingdom where he completed his education, and pursued his career as a professional Cricketer. Interestingly, the 24-year-old’s father Kevin Curran was a former Zimbabwean allrounder, who had represented the African nation during the 1983 and 1987 World Cups. Sam’s grandfather, who also goes by the name Kevin Curran, was also a first-class Cricketer for Rhodesia (former unrecognized state in Southern Africa). Despite all of it, Sam Curran is not a South African but an English by nationality, although having migrated out of Africa in 2012. While Sam Curran was born in Northampton, his eldest brother Tom Curran was born in Cape Town, South Africa in the year 1995. Having grown up in Zimbabwe as well, Tom was eligible to play for South Africa, Zimbabwe, or England, but was selected for the English performance programme in September 2015, and finally became eligible to play for England after completing his residential qualification period in England in October 2015. Sam Curran’s elder brother Ben Curran was also born in Northampton in 1996, and presently plays domestic Cricket for the county club Northamptonshire.","pubDate":"2022-10-22 15:35:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs PAK T20 World Cup 2022: Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne pitch history and T20I records","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket-news/ind-vs-pak-t20-world-cup-2022-melbourne-cricket-ground-melbourne-pitch-history-t20i-records?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Cricket News"],"creator":["Vinay Chhabria"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-22 15:10:12","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/10/87c9c-16664366699480-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Blazing Allen writes new chapter in Trans-Tasman rivalry at World Cups - ESPNcricinfo","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuY3JpY2luZm8uY29tL3N0b3J5L3QyMC13b3JsZC1jdXAtMjAyMi1ibGF6aW5nLWZpbm4tYWxsZW4td3JpdGVzLW5ldy1jaGFwdGVyLWluLXRyYW5zLXRhc21hbi1yaXZhbHJ5LWF0LXdvcmxkLWN1cHMtMTM0MTEzMNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Blazing Allen writes new chapter in Trans-Tasman rivalry at World Cups  ESPNcricinfo\"The best catch I've ever seen\" | Instant World Cup Recap | Unplayable Podcast  cricket.com.auNew Zealand vs. Australia Prediction, Betting Tips & Odds │22 OCTOBER, 2022  Telecom AsiaLive match blog - New Zealand vs Australia 13th Match, Group 1 2022/23 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfoCricbuzz Live: T20 WC | Australia v New Zealand, Match 13, Mid-innings show  CricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-22 14:47:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Acrobatic England outclass Afghanistan in five-wicket victory","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/10/22/cricket-acrobatic-england-outclass-afghanistan-in-five-wicket-victory","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PERTH (Reuters) - England kicked off their Twenty20 World Cup campaign with a five-wicket win over Afghanistan thanks to seamer Sam Curran's haul of 5-10 and a sublime effort in the field.

Afghanistan crumbled to 112 all out in 19.4 overs after being sent in to bat. Ibrahim Zadran (32) and Usman Ghani (30) provided the only resistance before falling to Curran, who claimed his career-best figures in 3.4 overs. England chased down the modest target with 11 balls to spare, reaching 113-5 and maintaining their unblemished record at Perth Stadium after three visits. \"We do a lot of hard work on our fielding, it will be a massive factor in the tournament I think,\" man-of-the-match Curran told reporters. \"We knew it would be a tricky chase... we won in the end and that's the most important thing.\" In what was a sedate powerplay of 35-1 for Afghanistan, opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz was the first to depart, caught behind for 10 during a fiery opening spell by Mark Wood (2-23) who clocked speeds reaching 154 kph. England's bowlers continued to cramp the batsmen during the middle overs, aided by spectacular fielding by Liam Livingstone and Adil Rashid who held on to running catches off Ben Stokes (2-19) to send Hazrat Zazai (seven) and Najibullah Zadran (13) on their way. Before Curran cleaned up the tail, captain-keeper Jos Buttler joined in on the acrobatic act, completing a flying one-handed catch after captain Mohammad Nabi tickled Wood down the leg-side on three. In England's response, Alex Hales (19) was dropped twice before Fazalhaq Farooqi stuck the third chance. Nabi held a diving catch at cover to see off Dawid Malan (18) and although wickets fell regularly as England batted conservatively, they never found themselves in any real danger. Livingstone top-scored with an unbeaten 29 from 21 balls. \"We need to get better at playing the full 40 overs,\" said Afghanistan head coach Jonathan Trott. \"I'd have liked less dropped catches, less fumbles, less misfields.\" (Reporting by Joel Dubber, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Clare Fallon)","pubDate":"2022-10-22 14:43:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thestar_my","country":["malaysia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Downright absurd’ catch stuns cricket world","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/downright-absurd-glenn-phillips-lights-up-scg-with-superb-outfield-catch/news-story/d91f0ae7655a6caf479e2fe72c6cddf9","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"There weren’t many highlights during Australia’s run chase at the SCG on Saturday evening, but at least New Zealand’s Glenn Phillips gave the 34,756 Sydney spectators something to cheer.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

India versus Pakistan cricket matches are a big draw every time and the scenario is no different for Sunday's match, he said.

Captain Jos Buttler’s decision of electing to bowl first after winning the toss resulted in his bowlers and fielders joining hands to register a quintessential team effort to bundle out the opposition for 112 in 19.4 overs. An innings which lacked intent on the back of poor execution was devoid of big shots prompting Afghan batters to only manage eight fours and three sixes during their 118-ball stay in the middle at the Perth Stadium. England batter Sam Billings, who is not part of their for this World Cup, took to social media platform Twitter to express admiration for his teammates’ performance on the field. Billings, who uploaded a couple of tweets, laid emphasis on England’s fantastic fielding in the match. While all the 10 Afghan batters were dismissed after handing catches to fielders (one caught and bowled), England batter Liam Livingstone, spinner Adil Rashid and Buttler were the pick of their fielders tonight. It was just after the powerplay that Livingstone held a brilliant catch whilst running towards his right from sweeper cover to dismiss Hazratullah Zazai. In the 15th over, Rashid backtracked from mid-wicket to complete another sensational catch to dismiss Najibullah Zadran. Buttler’s chance came in the following over when he didn’t let go of an opportunity to impress by registering a one-handed stunner down the leg-side to send his counterpart Mohammad Nabi back to the pavilion.

Read full story","content":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand's Devon Conway paid tribute to his opening partner Finn Allen for the way he took on Australia's vaunted pace attack as the Black Caps romped to an 89-run victory Twenty20 World Cup on Saturday. Conway high-scored with an unbeaten 92 but he felt Allen's 16-ball 42 in his first international against Australia had put the home quicks Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins firmly on the back foot. \"I have to give a lot of credit to the way Finn played, because the way he played and the way he put them under pressure allowed me to get those balls that were slightly looser,\" the South African-born lefthander told reporters. \"In T20 cricket, if you put bowlers under pressure, no matter how good you are, it's obviously a tough gig. \"Serious effort from him today,\" he added. \"Nice and calm, nice and relaxed and focused at the same time. Special knock for him, hit the ball really cleanly and put the bowlers under serious pressure.\" With in-form England also in Super 12 Group 2 and only the top two progressing to the semi-finals, Saturday's win at the Sydney Cricket Ground was a major boost to New Zealand hopes of reaching the knockout stage. \"Nothing changes for us,\" said Conway. \"We've got a process that we try and stick to, every game is another game. \"We've just got to make got focus on the things that we can control and take each day as it comes. We don't look too far into the future ... we just box smart and look forward to the next match in Melbourne.\" New Zealand, losing finalists in Dubai last year, face Afghanistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday before matches against Sri Lanka, England and Ireland round out the Super 12.
