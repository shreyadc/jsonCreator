In the same statement issued on Thursday following a meeting of the committee members in Dubai, the MCC also called for “calm across the global game following several high-profile incidents in a relatively short space of time.” The hot-button debate generated renewed interest last September when India allrounder Deepti Sharma ran out England’s Charlie Dean for the game-clinching wicket in the 44th over of the third ODI at Lord’s which India won by 16 runs. Dean was on 47 off 80 balls at the time trying to rally her side which was chasing a target of 170. A detailed analysis conducted by ESPNcricinfo subsequently showed that Dean had left her crease early at the non-striker’s end on 72 occasions prior to being run out. Deepti received support from captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the immediate aftermath of the incident during a post-match interview, saying, “Whatever we have done, I don’t think it was any crime. It is part of the game and is an ICC rule, and I think we just need to back our player.” The MCC World Cricket Committee made clear in its statement released on Thursday that the batter is at fault in such a scenario and that “there is no precedent to require a bowler to give a warning to a batter, confirming they are completely within their right to dismiss the batter on their first occasion they break the Law.” The World Cricket Committee pointedly stated that such dismissals would not happen if non-strikers are “complying with the Law and remaining within their ground until they have seen the ball being released from the bowler’s hand.” In other words, it is the batter’s responsibility to avoid being dismissed like this, just as it is their responsibility to avoid being dismissed bowled or lbw or caught. “The bowler is not the villain here,” Committee member Kumar Sangakkara said. “Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground. If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law.” Running non-strikers out for backing up too far tends to foster the argument that it isn’t so big a mistake that it should cost a wicket. There is also a fear that normalising it would have a negative effect at grassroots level. But MCC World Cricket Committee chairman Mike Gatting disagrees. “We have seen suggestions that this method of dismissal will be attempted more and more at recreational level and there is the possibility of matches descending into chaos,” Gatting said. “Whilst attempts may increase in the short term, we would expect batters to learn their responsibilities under the Laws very quickly and drive it out of prominence.” “Our stance on this is simple – batters must not steal ground if they do not wish to be given out in this manner. Nor should they be expecting to be given a warning if they do. If all non-strikers only left the popping crease once the ball had been released, there would never be the need for such a dismissal again. “The game is in a place where it should be able to self-regulate on this dismissal but there needs to be a Law in place, as we can’t have a situation whereby batters are able to gain ground without bowlers being able to do anything about it.” The issue came under more scrutiny once again during a two week stretch in January where a spate of incidents happened across franchise cricket as well as men’s and women’s international cricket. The first incident in the sequence took place on January 3 in a Big Bash League match between Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades. Stars captain Adam Zampa attempted to remove the bails with Renegades batter Tom Rogers well outside of his crease, but umpires ruled the appeal not out deeming that Zampa had gone past the point in his delivery action “where the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball”. This specific incident resulted in the MCC releasing a statement on January 19 to make a slight adjustment in the wording of Law 38.3.In a different incident on January 10, India men’s captain Rohit Sharma chose to withdraw an appeal made after fast bowler Mohammed Shami removed the bails to catch Sri Lanka captain out of his crease in the final over of the first ODI at Guwahati in January. Shanaka was on 98 at the time and the reprieve allowed him to score a century in a match that India won a few balls later by 67 runs defending a total of 373. The incident sparked debates about whether the dismissal should be attempted only at certain moments of a match versus being fair game for the entirety of play. Just five days later, Pakistan Women’s U19 bowler Zaib-un-Nisa ran out Rwanda batter Shakila Niyomuhoza in an opening round fixture at the ICC Women’s U-19 T20 World Cup in South Africa. The run-out occurred in the final over of the first innings in which Rwanda finished on 106 for 8 before Pakistan chased the target down to win by eight wickets with 13 balls to spare. (Cricinfo) Published on By Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has won many admirers in cricket circles for giving an undertaking to the court that he will initiate constitutional reforms to Sri Lanka Cricket and keeping to his word, he has appointed a ten member committee headed by Supreme Court judge K. T. Chitrasiri. The committee will work with the ICC and come up with a new constitution for SLC that has come under fire for having too many voting clubs at the AGM. Respected former cricketer Sidath Wettimuny, who was one of the 12 petitioners who went before the court highlighting flaws in cricket administration welcomed the move by the Minister of Sports. “Hats off to the current Sports Minister for realizing that this is such a crucial matter and agreeing to bring in reforms. We have come so close to changing the constitution, but in the 11th hour those efforts were crushed . Like in 2015 when former Supreme Court Judge Prasanna Jayawardene had come up with a new constitution. The ICC had given the green light. We had the blessings of the then Prime Minister but still couldn’t push it through,” noted Wettimuny, who headed the cricket board in 2015 and worked towards the change of constitution. When the Yahapalanaya government came into power in 2015, efforts had been taken to bring in constitutional reforms to SLC with the full backing of then Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake. But with President Maithripala Sirisena taking over the Sports Ministry to the SLFP, constitutional reforms were stalled and elections were called. “Ideally we would like to see a Board which is less politically driven with less votes. A system which is free of corruption and has more transparency and accountability,” Wettimuny added. “We’ve had so many issues over the years. I have been in eight Interim Committees and they were put in place because there were problems,” stressed Wettimuny. The current voting system that is in place doesn’t allow some of the best qualified men and women to get elected at SLC AGMs. For example, Kumar Sangakkara created history by becoming the first non British MCC President. But if he contests SLC elections, he may not only lose but his own beloved NCC will stop entirely supporting him. NCC infamously split their vote at the 1996 AGM that saw the ouster of Ana Punchihewa as SLC President. Neighbours SSC aren’t a paragon of virtue either. The club that named a gate after former captain Arjuna Ranatunga months later at the SLC AGM refused to vote for him. There was a storm of protest within the club and at next SSC AGM, members turned up in numbers to ouster the Executive Committee. “We need to have a constitution that attracts top, quality, independent and respected individuals. I’m really happy we have a Minister who is happy to look at the constitution. Now we have to hope the gentlemen in the committee will come up with a good proposal,” added Wettimuny. Roshan Ranasinghe may not be a popular man among his political colleagues but his popularity among Sri Lankan cricket fans around the world is soaring. Published on By Britain’s Andy Murray reached his first ATP semi-final since June by going the distance again to beat French qualifier Alexandre Muller at the Qatar Open.Murray, 35, fought back to win 4-6 6-1 6-2 against 26-year-old Muller, who was playing in his first ATP quarter-final.The Scot will play Jiri Lehecka in the last four after the 21-year-old Czech beat top seed Andrey Rublev. “He is one of the best young players on the tour, it’ll be a big test for me,” said former world number one Murray. “He has started the year extremely well, did well at the Australian Open and hits a huge ball.” Murray, who last reached the semi-finals of a tournament at the Stuttgart Open, has long been targeting deeper runs and playing against the inexperienced Muller provided a fantastic opportunity.However, the issue for Murray in recent months has been recovering from gruelling battles in time for the next match. All of his four previous wins in 2023 had gone to a deciding set, showcasing Murray’s fighting spirit and physical endurance.This quarter-final – less than 24 hours after a long and gutsy win over Germany’s former world number two Alexander Zverev – followed the same pattern. Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, seemingly sensing a quick start would be beneficial after a short turnaround, did that by breaking for 2-0 before a careless third game allowed Muller to break back.From that point the Frenchman relaxed and showed his power on the way to winning the first set in 53 minutes. One of Murray’s trademarks is his resilience and he responded by upping his level in the second set.Playing smarter and serving strongly, he denied Muller the time he had in the opening set to pick his shots and Murray’s level remained high in the decider. “I would love to win one [title]but I have goals to achieve more than that,” Murray, who triumphed in Doha in 2008 and 2009, said. “I am putting myself in a position now to do that going into the last couple of matches. “I feel like these last few weeks are a step in the right direction and if I continue to play and compete like I am now, that I will have not just one opportunity to win a title but I will have more chances to do that in this last stage of my career.” Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev will play second seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the other semi-final. Russia’s Medvedev beat Australia’s Christopher O’Connell 6-2 4-6 7-5 while Canada’s Auger-Aliassime came through 6-4 7-6 (7-5) against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain.

Stokes decided to bowl again after dismissing the Black Caps for 209 at the Basin Reserve. Home captain Tim Southee launched a bold counter-attack on the third morning, resuming in a perilous position of 7-138, smashing 50 runs in 31 balls. That included a run of three sixes in one over from Jack Leach, with another one following as he hooked Ollie Robinson into the crowd. He was four short of his career-best 77, made on debut against England 15 years ago, when the introduction of Broad ended his fun. One ball after being dropped by Leach at fine leg he swung hard again and skied straight to Zak Crawley at midwicket. Broad swooped on his chance to bank some tidy figures, ending Tom Blundell's defiant stay on 38 when he middled a cross-bat shot straight to mid-on.

Stokes decided to bowl again after dismissing the Black Caps for 209 at the Basin Reserve. Home captain Tim Southee launched a bold counter-attack on the third morning, resuming in a perilous position of 138 for seven, smashing 50 runs in 31 balls. That included a run of three sixes in one over from Jack Leach, with another one following as he hooked Ollie Robinson into the crowd. He was four short of his career-best 77, made on debut against England 15 years ago, when the introduction of Broad ended his fun. One ball after being dropped by Leach at fine-leg he swung hard again and skied straight to Zak Crawley at midwicket. Broad swooped on his chance to bank some tidy figures, ending Tom Blundell’s defiant stay on 38 when he middled a cross-bat shot straight to mid-on.

That was the overwhelming message from skipper Sune Luus at her pre-match press conference on Saturday. The Proteas, inconsistent in the competition's group stages, were given no chance against England in Friday's semi-final at the same venue. READ | Proteas solidify hero status after rocking England in SF Yet, after a spirited performance of grit, determination and fearlessness, they emerged as six-run victors to punch their ticket to a tournament decider for the first time in South African cricket history. The tears at the end of the match showed just how much this moment meant, while the reaction from the South African public has broken new barriers. Hundreds queued outside Newlands on Saturday morning in a desperate attempt to purchase tickets. They will be sold out. \"It's been an amazing tournament so far, on and off the field. As far as cricket is concerned, we're achieving the goals that we want to, and that's awesome to see,\" Luus told media. \"Off the field, we're also doing the job we wanted to do. The goal for us was to inspire a nation and get women's cricket in South Africa on the map. We wanted to get young girls and boys in South Africa to pick up a bat, and we wanted women's sport in South Africa in general to be raised as well. \"In terms of that, we're definitely doing the job.

That's where we are as a country at the moment, and it's something very special. \"I'm hoping that once this World Cup finishes and we play normal series in South Africa, the crowds won't be any different, and the vibe and positive energy will be the same. \"It's going to be a very special feeling. We've always known we have the skill and ability to get into a final. \"No matter what happens tomorrow, it's going to be a special day for us.\" Coach Hilton Moreeng said he was delighted to finally see his charges get over the semi-final hurdle. \"It has been a long journey, and how the girls have grown and how the team has grown in stature and with every competition has been amazing to see,\" he said. \"They have shown the character that we knew they always had.

भविष्यवाणी की है। जिसको सुनकर भारतीय फैंस फूले नहीं समाएंगे।","content":"भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के पूर्व कप्तान और दिग्गज बल्लेबाज सौरव गांगुली अक्सर सुर्खियों में छाए रहते हैं। वह भारतीय क्रिकेट से जुड़े किसी न किसी मसले के चलते चर्चा में बने रहते हैं। वहीं इस समय भारत में टीम इंडिया और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच 4 मैचों की रोचक बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी खेली जा रही है। जिसके पहले दो मैच भारतीय टीम ने अपने नाम कर तहलका मचा रखा है। सीरीज का अगला मुकाबला 1 मार्च से इंदौर में खेला जाना है। जिससे पहले अब सौरव गांगुली ने ऐसी भविष्यवाणी की है जो ऑस्ट्रेलियाई खेमे को एक नजर नहीं भाएगी। भारतीय क्रिकेट कंट्रोल बोर्ड के पूर्व अध्यक्ष सौरव गांगुली ने भारत और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच जारी टेस्ट सीरीज को लेकर बहुत बड़ी भविष्यवाणी की है। उनका मानना है कि बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी में रोहित शर्मा एंड कंपनी ऑस्ट्रेलिया का सूपड़ा साफ करने वाला है। यानी 4-0 से कंगारुओं को मात देने वाला है। सौरव गांगुली ने कहा, 'मैं 4-0 देख रहा हूं। ऑस्ट्रेलिया के लिए भारत को हराना मुश्किल होगा। इन परिस्थितियों में हम बेहतर टीम हैं।' आपको बता दें कि भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम ने ऑस्ट्रेलिया को नागपुर और दिल्ली में खेले गए पहले दोनो टेस्ट मैच 3 दिन में ही हराकर करारी शिकस्त दी है। जिसके चलते भारत के पास सीरीज में 2-0 की अजय बढ़त भी है। जहां नागपुर टेस्ट में भारत ने कंगारुओं को एक पारी और 132 रनों से मात दी थी। तो वहीं दिल्ली में 6 विकेट से धूल चटाई थी। इसके अलावा भारत ने लगातार चौथी बार बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी को रिटेन भी कर लिया है। बहरहाल, अगर ऑस्ट्रेलिया को भारत के खिलाफ बीजीटी में 4-0 की हार से बचना है तो आगामी दोनों मुकाबलों में उन्हें पूरी तरह से खुद को झोंकना होगा।","pubDate":"2023-02-25

Connor Shields bagged a brace after Jack Thomson and Aaron Healy had already fired past Accies, who grabbed a consolation through substitute Dario Zanatta in the 4-1 defeat. And Rankin reckoned the drive and determination that had got them off the bottom of the Championship with victory over Inverness in midweek was sorely lacking as they were brushed aside on their home patch.

He added: \"We were looking for a spark today. \"Our subs have made a massive impact in games recently and today they didn't do it, other than Dario who came on and scored. \"I felt the subs let us down in terms of making an impact.

The sustained success of the women’s national team and the Women’s Big Bash League that underpins it coincides with the registration of five-year-old to 12-year-old female players crashing through the 20,000 mark for the first time. Peninsula Cricket Club all girls Woolworths Blast team are among the 20,000 registered female cricketers in Australia aged between five and 12. Credit: James Brickwood Australia will meet South Africa in the final in Cape Town on Sunday night (starting at midnight AEDT). Since 2010, there have been 10 women’s 50-over or T20 World Cups. Australia have now made nine finals and can claim their eighth crown with a win against the host nation. For former Australian captain and Hall of Famer Belinda Clark, the rise and rise of women’s cricket is a world away from when she started playing the game as the only girl in the entire Newcastle competition. Clark said current stars such as captain Meg Lanning , Alyssa Healy and Ellyse Perry would have been in a similar situation. “It’s highly likely that all three would have been the only girl in their team at club level, and so now you look at where we’re at,” Clark told the Herald and The Age . “Sure, girls can still play in mixed competitions, but they’ve also got an opportunity to play in all-girls competitions as well, and all-girls teams, which is a massive leap.” There is also a massive leap coming for Australia’s elite players just days after the final when the inaugural Women’s Premier League begins in India. Player of the match Ashleigh Gardner (right) celebrates Australia’s dramatic semi-final victory with Jess Jonassen and Meg Lanning.

Clark believes that the WPL will do great things for elite women’s cricket and make India into a powerhouse, as their men’s team is proving to be as they head for a third successive Test series victory over Australia. “The advantage to the players is twofold,” Clark said of the WPL. “It’s obviously financial, which is a good thing. And the stakes are raised again: there are private owners who have expectations and a broadcaster that’s paid a lot of money for the tournament. “I think any time that you’re playing with pressure applied is helpful, so that’s positive. “From an Indian perspective, they have been hesitating to actually put these tournaments on. They’ve been running the invitational challenge for a couple of years. “The fact that they got such a big impact from people that wanted clubs, the broadcasters that wanted to put it on television, I think that’s given India confidence that they’re on the right path. Belinda Clark at the unveiling of a statue in her honour at the SCG last month Credit: Flavio Brancaleone “And all those young [Indian] players are going to benefit enormously from that because before there wasn’t a lot of Indian players who played in the WBBL, or The Hundred in England. “That means those Indian players are primarily playing domestic cricket in India trying to get into the national team. “Some have had to wait a long time to get exposure, and I think this competition is just going to accelerate their development. “The younger players, they’ve already won the under-19 World Cup, so it [Indian women’s cricket] will explode.” It’s a far cry from when Clark led Australia to the 1997 World Cup title in India.

In the same statement issued on Thursday following a meeting of the committee members in Dubai, the MCC also called for “calm across the global game following several high-profile incidents in a relatively short space of time.” The hot-button debate generated renewed interest last September when India allrounder Deepti Sharma ran out England’s Charlie Dean for the game-clinching wicket in the 44th over of the third ODI at Lord’s which India won by 16 runs. Dean was on 47 off 80 balls at the time trying to rally her side which was chasing a target of 170. A detailed analysis conducted by ESPNcricinfo subsequently showed that Dean had left her crease early at the non-striker’s end on 72 occasions prior to being run out. Deepti received support from captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the immediate aftermath of the incident during a post-match interview, saying, “Whatever we have done, I don’t think it was any crime. It is part of the game and is an ICC rule, and I think we just need to back our player.” The MCC World Cricket Committee made clear in its statement released on Thursday that the batter is at fault in such a scenario and that “there is no precedent to require a bowler to give a warning to a batter, confirming they are completely within their right to dismiss the batter on their first occasion they break the Law.” The World Cricket Committee pointedly stated that such dismissals would not happen if non-strikers are “complying with the Law and remaining within their ground until they have seen the ball being released from the bowler’s hand.” In other words, it is the batter’s responsibility to avoid being dismissed like this, just as it is their responsibility to avoid being dismissed bowled or lbw or caught. “The bowler is not the villain here,” Committee member Kumar Sangakkara said. “Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground. If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law.” Running non-strikers out for backing up too far tends to foster the argument that it isn’t so big a mistake that it should cost a wicket. There is also a fear that normalising it would have a negative effect at grassroots level. But MCC World Cricket Committee chairman Mike Gatting disagrees. “We have seen suggestions that this method of dismissal will be attempted more and more at recreational level and there is the possibility of matches descending into chaos,” Gatting said. “Whilst attempts may increase in the short term, we would expect batters to learn their responsibilities under the Laws very quickly and drive it out of prominence.” “Our stance on this is simple – batters must not steal ground if they do not wish to be given out in this manner. Nor should they be expecting to be given a warning if they do. If all non-strikers only left the popping crease once the ball had been released, there would never be the need for such a dismissal again. “The game is in a place where it should be able to self-regulate on this dismissal but there needs to be a Law in place, as we can’t have a situation whereby batters are able to gain ground without bowlers being able to do anything about it.” The issue came under more scrutiny once again during a two week stretch in January where a spate of incidents happened across franchise cricket as well as men’s and women’s international cricket. The first incident in the sequence took place on January 3 in a Big Bash League match between Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades. Stars captain Adam Zampa attempted to remove the bails with Renegades batter Tom Rogers well outside of his crease, but umpires ruled the appeal not out deeming that Zampa had gone past the point in his delivery action “where the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball”. This specific incident resulted in the MCC releasing a statement on January 19 to make a slight adjustment in the wording of Law 38.3.In a different incident on January 10, India men’s captain Rohit Sharma chose to withdraw an appeal made after fast bowler Mohammed Shami removed the bails to catch Sri Lanka captain out of his crease in the final over of the first ODI at Guwahati in January. Shanaka was on 98 at the time and the reprieve allowed him to score a century in a match that India won a few balls later by 67 runs defending a total of 373. The incident sparked debates about whether the dismissal should be attempted only at certain moments of a match versus being fair game for the entirety of play. Just five days later, Pakistan Women’s U19 bowler Zaib-un-Nisa ran out Rwanda batter Shakila Niyomuhoza in an opening round fixture at the ICC Women’s U-19 T20 World Cup in South Africa. The run-out occurred in the final over of the first innings in which Rwanda finished on 106 for 8 before Pakistan chased the target down to win by eight wickets with 13 balls to spare. (Cricinfo) Published on By Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has won many admirers in cricket circles for giving an undertaking to the court that he will initiate constitutional reforms to Sri Lanka Cricket and keeping to his word, he has appointed a ten member committee headed by Supreme Court judge K. T. Chitrasiri. The committee will work with the ICC and come up with a new constitution for SLC that has come under fire for having too many voting clubs at the AGM. Respected former cricketer Sidath Wettimuny, who was one of the 12 petitioners who went before the court highlighting flaws in cricket administration welcomed the move by the Minister of Sports. “Hats off to the current Sports Minister for realizing that this is such a crucial matter and agreeing to bring in reforms. We have come so close to changing the constitution, but in the 11th hour those efforts were crushed . Like in 2015 when former Supreme Court Judge Prasanna Jayawardene had come up with a new constitution. The ICC had given the green light. We had the blessings of the then Prime Minister but still couldn’t push it through,” noted Wettimuny, who headed the cricket board in 2015 and worked towards the change of constitution. When the Yahapalanaya government came into power in 2015, efforts had been taken to bring in constitutional reforms to SLC with the full backing of then Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake. But with President Maithripala Sirisena taking over the Sports Ministry to the SLFP, constitutional reforms were stalled and elections were called. “Ideally we would like to see a Board which is less politically driven with less votes. A system which is free of corruption and has more transparency and accountability,” Wettimuny added. “We’ve had so many issues over the years. I have been in eight Interim Committees and they were put in place because there were problems,” stressed Wettimuny. The current voting system that is in place doesn’t allow some of the best qualified men and women to get elected at SLC AGMs. For example, Kumar Sangakkara created history by becoming the first non British MCC President. But if he contests SLC elections, he may not only lose but his own beloved NCC will stop entirely supporting him. NCC infamously split their vote at the 1996 AGM that saw the ouster of Ana Punchihewa as SLC President. Neighbours SSC aren’t a paragon of virtue either. The club that named a gate after former captain Arjuna Ranatunga months later at the SLC AGM refused to vote for him.

T. Chitrasiri. The committee will work with the ICC and come up with a new constitution for SLC that has come under fire for having too many voting clubs at the AGM. Respected former cricketer Sidath Wettimuny, who was one of the 12 petitioners who went before the court highlighting flaws in cricket administration welcomed the move by the Minister of Sports. “Hats off to the current Sports Minister for realizing that this is such a crucial matter and agreeing to bring in reforms. We have come so close to changing the constitution, but in the 11th hour those efforts were crushed . Like in 2015 when former Supreme Court Judge Prasanna Jayawardene had come up with a new constitution. The ICC had given the green light. We had the blessings of the then Prime Minister but still couldn’t push it through,” noted Wettimuny, who headed the cricket board in 2015 and worked towards the change of constitution. When the Yahapalanaya government came into power in 2015, efforts had been taken to bring in constitutional reforms to SLC with the full backing of then Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake. But with President Maithripala Sirisena taking over the Sports Ministry to the SLFP, constitutional reforms were stalled and elections were called. “Ideally we would like to see a Board which is less politically driven with less votes. A system which is free of corruption and has more transparency and accountability,” Wettimuny added. “We’ve had so many issues over the years. I have been in eight Interim Committees and they were put in place because there were problems,” stressed Wettimuny. The current voting system that is in place doesn’t allow some of the best qualified men and women to get elected at SLC AGMs. For example, Kumar Sangakkara created history by becoming the first non British MCC President. But if he contests SLC elections, he may not only lose but his own beloved NCC will stop entirely supporting him. NCC infamously split their vote at the 1996 AGM that saw the ouster of Ana Punchihewa as SLC President. Neighbours SSC aren’t a paragon of virtue either. The club that named a gate after former captain Arjuna Ranatunga months later at the SLC AGM refused to vote for him.

That was the overwhelming message from skipper Sune Luus at her pre-match press conference on Saturday. The Proteas, inconsistent in the competition's group stages, were given no chance against England in Friday's semi-final at the same venue. READ | Proteas solidify hero status after rocking England in SF Yet, after a spirited performance of grit, determination and fearlessness, they emerged as six-run victors to punch their ticket to a tournament decider for the first time in South African cricket history. The tears at the end of the match showed just how much this moment meant, while the reaction from the South African public has broken new barriers. Hundreds queued outside Newlands on Saturday morning in a desperate attempt to purchase tickets. They will be sold out. \"It's been an amazing tournament so far, on and off the field. As far as cricket is concerned, we're achieving the goals that we want to, and that's awesome to see,\" Luus told media. \"Off the field, we're also doing the job we wanted to do. The goal for us was to inspire a nation and get women's cricket in South Africa on the map. We wanted to get young girls and boys in South Africa to pick up a bat, and we wanted women's sport in South Africa in general to be raised as well. \"In terms of that, we're definitely doing the job. Hopefully, tomorrow will be another step towards that.\" READ | Shabnim Ismail: Proteas' leader, quicker than ever, sparking World Cup charge Luus acknowledged that the emotions of the achievement were overwhelming but spoke to the importance of keeping calm, as they did in the semi-final. \"That's a feeling you can't really put into words,\" she said. \"It's something that we never thought would happen in our country ... people standing in queues to buy tickets for a women's cricket match. That's where we are as a country at the moment, and it's something very special. \"I'm hoping that once this World Cup finishes and we play normal series in South Africa, the crowds won't be any different, and the vibe and positive energy will be the same. \"It's going to be a very special feeling. We've always known we have the skill and ability to get into a final. \"No matter what happens tomorrow, it's going to be a special day for us.\" Coach Hilton Moreeng said he was delighted to finally see his charges get over the semi-final hurdle. \"It has been a long journey, and how the girls have grown and how the team has grown in stature and with every competition has been amazing to see,\" he said. \"They have shown the character that we knew they always had. We have always come close, so it was absolutely fitting that it could happen on home soil like it did yesterday. \"I'm blessed to be part of this. We have a very talented group of players, and it's great to see them putting the performances together.\" Play on Sunday starts at 15:00.","pubDate":"2023-02-25

किसी न किसी मसले के चलते चर्चा में बने रहते हैं। वहीं इस समय भारत में टीम इंडिया और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच 4 मैचों की रोचक बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी खेली जा रही है। जिसके पहले दो मैच भारतीय टीम ने अपने नाम कर तहलका मचा रखा है। सीरीज का अगला मुकाबला 1 मार्च से इंदौर में खेला जाना है। जिससे पहले अब सौरव गांगुली ने ऐसी भविष्यवाणी की है जो ऑस्ट्रेलियाई खेमे को एक नजर नहीं भाएगी। भारतीय क्रिकेट कंट्रोल बोर्ड के पूर्व अध्यक्ष सौरव गांगुली ने भारत और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच जारी टेस्ट सीरीज को लेकर बहुत बड़ी भविष्यवाणी की है। उनका मानना है कि बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी में रोहित शर्मा एंड कंपनी ऑस्ट्रेलिया का सूपड़ा साफ करने वाला है। यानी 4-0 से कंगारुओं को मात देने वाला है। सौरव गांगुली ने कहा, 'मैं 4-0 देख रहा हूं। ऑस्ट्रेलिया के लिए भारत को हराना मुश्किल होगा। इन परिस्थितियों में हम बेहतर टीम हैं।' आपको बता दें कि भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम ने ऑस्ट्रेलिया को नागपुर और दिल्ली में खेले गए पहले दोनो टेस्ट मैच 3 दिन में ही हराकर करारी शिकस्त दी है। जिसके चलते भारत के पास सीरीज में 2-0 की अजय बढ़त भी है। जहां नागपुर टेस्ट में भारत ने कंगारुओं को एक पारी और 132 रनों से मात दी थी। तो वहीं दिल्ली में 6 विकेट से धूल चटाई थी। इसके अलावा भारत ने लगातार चौथी बार बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी को रिटेन भी कर लिया है। बहरहाल, अगर ऑस्ट्रेलिया को भारत के खिलाफ बीजीटी में 4-0 की हार से बचना है तो आगामी दोनों मुकाबलों में उन्हें पूरी तरह से खुद को झोंकना होगा।","pubDate":"2023-02-25

Connor Shields bagged a brace after Jack Thomson and Aaron Healy had already fired past Accies, who grabbed a consolation through substitute Dario Zanatta in the 4-1 defeat. And Rankin reckoned the drive and determination that had got them off the bottom of the Championship with victory over Inverness in midweek was sorely lacking as they were brushed aside on their home patch.

Hamilton's Scott Martin (L) and Queen's Park's Aaron Healy in action \"In the second half I thought we could have attacked and caused problems with the system we were in at that time, but the second goal kills the game. \"At that point the heads went down but we came back to 3-1 and at that point JP has a really good chance, and if he scores that it would have been game on. \"So I'm disappointed by that aspect. \"But the spirit that has been there the last seven or eight weeks was lacking when we went a goal down.\" Rankin also took aim at his substitutes - goalscorer Zanatta excluded - for their failure to positively impact the game. He added: \"We were looking for a spark today. \"Our subs have made a massive impact in games recently and today they didn't do it, other than Dario who came on and scored. \"I felt the subs let us down in terms of making an impact.

The sustained success of the women’s national team and the Women’s Big Bash League that underpins it coincides with the registration of five-year-old to 12-year-old female players crashing through the 20,000 mark for the first time. Peninsula Cricket Club all girls Woolworths Blast team are among the 20,000 registered female cricketers in Australia aged between five and 12. Credit: James Brickwood Australia will meet South Africa in the final in Cape Town on Sunday night (starting at midnight AEDT). Since 2010, there have been 10 women’s 50-over or T20 World Cups. Australia have now made nine finals and can claim their eighth crown with a win against the host nation. For former Australian captain and Hall of Famer Belinda Clark, the rise and rise of women’s cricket is a world away from when she started playing the game as the only girl in the entire Newcastle competition. Clark said current stars such as captain Meg Lanning , Alyssa Healy and Ellyse Perry would have been in a similar situation. “It’s highly likely that all three would have been the only girl in their team at club level, and so now you look at where we’re at,” Clark told the Herald and The Age . “Sure, girls can still play in mixed competitions, but they’ve also got an opportunity to play in all-girls competitions as well, and all-girls teams, which is a massive leap.” There is also a massive leap coming for Australia’s elite players just days after the final when the inaugural Women’s Premier League begins in India. Player of the match Ashleigh Gardner (right) celebrates Australia’s dramatic semi-final victory with Jess Jonassen and Meg Lanning. Credit: Getty Ashleigh Gardner lived up to her life-changing $558,000 price tag as the most expensive Australian in the WPL and equal second most expensive overall with a player of the match performance in the semi-final, scoring 31 from 18 balls and claiming two wickets. Clark believes that the WPL will do great things for elite women’s cricket and make India into a powerhouse, as their men’s team is proving to be as they head for a third successive Test series victory over Australia. “The advantage to the players is twofold,” Clark said of the WPL. “It’s obviously financial, which is a good thing. And the stakes are raised again: there are private owners who have expectations and a broadcaster that’s paid a lot of money for the tournament. “I think any time that you’re playing with pressure applied is helpful, so that’s positive. “From an Indian perspective, they have been hesitating to actually put these tournaments on. They’ve been running the invitational challenge for a couple of years. “The fact that they got such a big impact from people that wanted clubs, the broadcasters that wanted to put it on television, I think that’s given India confidence that they’re on the right path. Belinda Clark at the unveiling of a statue in her honour at the SCG last month Credit: Flavio Brancaleone “And all those young [Indian] players are going to benefit enormously from that because before there wasn’t a lot of Indian players who played in the WBBL, or The Hundred in England. “That means those Indian players are primarily playing domestic cricket in India trying to get into the national team. “Some have had to wait a long time to get exposure, and I think this competition is just going to accelerate their development. “The younger players, they’ve already won the under-19 World Cup, so it [Indian women’s cricket] will explode.” It’s a far cry from when Clark led Australia to the 1997 World Cup title in India.

In the same statement issued on Thursday following a meeting of the committee members in Dubai, the MCC also called for “calm across the global game following several high-profile incidents in a relatively short space of time.” The hot-button debate generated renewed interest last September when India allrounder Deepti Sharma ran out England’s Charlie Dean for the game-clinching wicket in the 44th over of the third ODI at Lord’s which India won by 16 runs. Dean was on 47 off 80 balls at the time trying to rally her side which was chasing a target of 170. A detailed analysis conducted by ESPNcricinfo subsequently showed that Dean had left her crease early at the non-striker’s end on 72 occasions prior to being run out. Deepti received support from captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the immediate aftermath of the incident during a post-match interview, saying, “Whatever we have done, I don’t think it was any crime. It is part of the game and is an ICC rule, and I think we just need to back our player.” The MCC World Cricket Committee made clear in its statement released on Thursday that the batter is at fault in such a scenario and that “there is no precedent to require a bowler to give a warning to a batter, confirming they are completely within their right to dismiss the batter on their first occasion they break the Law.” The World Cricket Committee pointedly stated that such dismissals would not happen if non-strikers are “complying with the Law and remaining within their ground until they have seen the ball being released from the bowler’s hand.” In other words, it is the batter’s responsibility to avoid being dismissed like this, just as it is their responsibility to avoid being dismissed bowled or lbw or caught. “The bowler is not the villain here,” Committee member Kumar Sangakkara said. “Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground. If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law.” Running non-strikers out for backing up too far tends to foster the argument that it isn’t so big a mistake that it should cost a wicket. There is also a fear that normalising it would have a negative effect at grassroots level. But MCC World Cricket Committee chairman Mike Gatting disagrees. “We have seen suggestions that this method of dismissal will be attempted more and more at recreational level and there is the possibility of matches descending into chaos,” Gatting said. “Whilst attempts may increase in the short term, we would expect batters to learn their responsibilities under the Laws very quickly and drive it out of prominence.” “Our stance on this is simple – batters must not steal ground if they do not wish to be given out in this manner. Nor should they be expecting to be given a warning if they do. If all non-strikers only left the popping crease once the ball had been released, there would never be the need for such a dismissal again. “The game is in a place where it should be able to self-regulate on this dismissal but there needs to be a Law in place, as we can’t have a situation whereby batters are able to gain ground without bowlers being able to do anything about it.” The issue came under more scrutiny once again during a two week stretch in January where a spate of incidents happened across franchise cricket as well as men’s and women’s international cricket. The first incident in the sequence took place on January 3 in a Big Bash League match between Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades. Stars captain Adam Zampa attempted to remove the bails with Renegades batter Tom Rogers well outside of his crease, but umpires ruled the appeal not out deeming that Zampa had gone past the point in his delivery action “where the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball”. This specific incident resulted in the MCC releasing a statement on January 19 to make a slight adjustment in the wording of Law 38.3.In a different incident on January 10, India men’s captain Rohit Sharma chose to withdraw an appeal made after fast bowler Mohammed Shami removed the bails to catch Sri Lanka captain out of his crease in the final over of the first ODI at Guwahati in January. Shanaka was on 98 at the time and the reprieve allowed him to score a century in a match that India won a few balls later by 67 runs defending a total of 373. The incident sparked debates about whether the dismissal should be attempted only at certain moments of a match versus being fair game for the entirety of play. Just five days later, Pakistan Women’s U19 bowler Zaib-un-Nisa ran out Rwanda batter Shakila Niyomuhoza in an opening round fixture at the ICC Women’s U-19 T20 World Cup in South Africa. The run-out occurred in the final over of the first innings in which Rwanda finished on 106 for 8 before Pakistan chased the target down to win by eight wickets with 13 balls to spare. (Cricinfo) Published on By Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has won many admirers in cricket circles for giving an undertaking to the court that he will initiate constitutional reforms to Sri Lanka Cricket and keeping to his word, he has appointed a ten member committee headed by Supreme Court judge K. T. Chitrasiri. The committee will work with the ICC and come up with a new constitution for SLC that has come under fire for having too many voting clubs at the AGM. Respected former cricketer Sidath Wettimuny, who was one of the 12 petitioners who went before the court highlighting flaws in cricket administration welcomed the move by the Minister of Sports. “Hats off to the current Sports Minister for realizing that this is such a crucial matter and agreeing to bring in reforms. We have come so close to changing the constitution, but in the 11th hour those efforts were crushed . Like in 2015 when former Supreme Court Judge Prasanna Jayawardene had come up with a new constitution. The ICC had given the green light. We had the blessings of the then Prime Minister but still couldn’t push it through,” noted Wettimuny, who headed the cricket board in 2015 and worked towards the change of constitution. When the Yahapalanaya government came into power in 2015, efforts had been taken to bring in constitutional reforms to SLC with the full backing of then Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake. But with President Maithripala Sirisena taking over the Sports Ministry to the SLFP, constitutional reforms were stalled and elections were called. “Ideally we would like to see a Board which is less politically driven with less votes. A system which is free of corruption and has more transparency and accountability,” Wettimuny added. “We’ve had so many issues over the years. I have been in eight Interim Committees and they were put in place because there were problems,” stressed Wettimuny. The current voting system that is in place doesn’t allow some of the best qualified men and women to get elected at SLC AGMs. For example, Kumar Sangakkara created history by becoming the first non British MCC President. But if he contests SLC elections, he may not only lose but his own beloved NCC will stop entirely supporting him. NCC infamously split their vote at the 1996 AGM that saw the ouster of Ana Punchihewa as SLC President. Neighbours SSC aren’t a paragon of virtue either. The club that named a gate after former captain Arjuna Ranatunga months later at the SLC AGM refused to vote for him. There was a storm of protest within the club and at next SSC AGM, members turned up in numbers to ouster the Executive Committee. “We need to have a constitution that attracts top, quality, independent and respected individuals. I’m really happy we have a Minister who is happy to look at the constitution. Now we have to hope the gentlemen in the committee will come up with a good proposal,” added Wettimuny. Roshan Ranasinghe may not be a popular man among his political colleagues but his popularity among Sri Lankan cricket fans around the world is soaring. Published on By Britain’s Andy Murray reached his first ATP semi-final since June by going the distance again to beat French qualifier Alexandre Muller at the Qatar Open.Murray, 35, fought back to win 4-6 6-1 6-2 against 26-year-old Muller, who was playing in his first ATP quarter-final.The Scot will play Jiri Lehecka in the last four after the 21-year-old Czech beat top seed Andrey Rublev. “He is one of the best young players on the tour, it’ll be a big test for me,” said former world number one Murray. “He has started the year extremely well, did well at the Australian Open and hits a huge ball.” Murray, who last reached the semi-finals of a tournament at the Stuttgart Open, has long been targeting deeper runs and playing against the inexperienced Muller provided a fantastic opportunity.However, the issue for Murray in recent months has been recovering from gruelling battles in time for the next match. All of his four previous wins in 2023 had gone to a deciding set, showcasing Murray’s fighting spirit and physical endurance.This quarter-final – less than 24 hours after a long and gutsy win over Germany’s former world number two Alexander Zverev – followed the same pattern. Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, seemingly sensing a quick start would be beneficial after a short turnaround, did that by breaking for 2-0 before a careless third game allowed Muller to break back.From that point the Frenchman relaxed and showed his power on the way to winning the first set in 53 minutes. One of Murray’s trademarks is his resilience and he responded by upping his level in the second set.Playing smarter and serving strongly, he denied Muller the time he had in the opening set to pick his shots and Murray’s level remained high in the decider. “I would love to win one [title]but I have goals to achieve more than that,” Murray, who triumphed in Doha in 2008 and 2009, said. “I am putting myself in a position now to do that going into the last couple of matches. “I feel like these last few weeks are a step in the right direction and if I continue to play and compete like I am now, that I will have not just one opportunity to win a title but I will have more chances to do that in this last stage of my career.” Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev will play second seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the other semi-final. Russia’s Medvedev beat Australia’s Christopher O’Connell 6-2 4-6 7-5 while Canada’s Auger-Aliassime came through 6-4 7-6 (7-5) against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain. Published on By Qualification for the 2024 T20 World Cup resumes in Buenos Aires on Saturday (February 25) as six teams gather in the Argentine capital to contest the Americas Sub-Regional Qualifier T20. Hosts Argentina are joined by Bermuda, The Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands and Panama to vie for three qualifier berths alongside Canada at the Americas regional finals, one step away from the T20 World Cup. With the United States automatically qualifying for the 2024 World Cup as co-hosts with the West Indies, combined with the replacement of the Global Qualifier with direct regional qualification, the path to the ICC’s pinnacle T20 event is less arduous than usual for lower-ranked Americas Associates. For the three teams winning through this tournament, a turn on the global stage will be just one step away as they head to the Regional Final in Bermuda at the end of September. Though there will be only one qualification spot on offer at the regional final and Canada remain firm favourites to take it, for the six teams in Buenos Aires this cycle represents a rare opportunity to make a bid for World Cup qualification should they secure a podium finish this week. In the absence of Brazil and Suriname, both of whom pulled out of the tournament, the six teams will compete in a single group, playing a simple round robin with the top three sides on the table progressing to join Canada at the four-team regional final. The only team at the tournament with a World Cup pedigree, Bermuda have slipped back into the pack somewhat since their heyday, but remain overwhelming favourites to win the tournament. Convincing wins over the hosts in two warm-up matches ahead of the tournament underlined their status, with Delray Rawlins and Kamau Leverock especially looking a cut above the grade. Argentina will fancy their chances of a top-three finish, with home conditions in their favour and a recent winning record over most of the rest of the field. An exception there is the returning Cayman Islands side however, Raymon Sealy’s team having a strong claim to the title of “best of the rest” in the region behind the USA, Canada and Bermuda. A five-nothing whitewash at the hands of the Caymans in their most recent competitive outing last year suggests that the Bahamas will be outsiders to progress, though if skipper Marc Taylor or Kervon Hinds fire they may have the next best shot at a podium finish. Belize and Panama both start as underdogs, despite boasting potentially match-winners in the likes of Bernan Stephenson or Irfan Hafejee respectively, neither have yet been able to consistently compete at regional level.","pubDate":"2023-02-26 00:01:04","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sidath welcomes move to change SLC constitution","link":"http://island.lk/sidath-welcomes-move-to-change-slc-constitution/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"by Rex Clementine Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has won many admirers in cricket circles for giving an undertaking to the court that he will initiate constitutional reforms to Sri Lanka Cricket and keeping to his word, he has appointed a ten member committee headed by Supreme Court judge K.

The current voting system that is in place doesn’t allow some of the best qualified men and women to get elected at SLC AGMs. For example, Kumar Sangakkara created history by becoming the first non British MCC President. But if he contests SLC elections, he may not only lose but his own beloved NCC will stop entirely supporting him. NCC infamously split their vote at the 1996 AGM that saw the ouster of Ana Punchihewa as SLC President. Neighbours SSC aren’t a paragon of virtue either. The club that named a gate after former captain Arjuna Ranatunga months later at the SLC AGM refused to vote for him. There was a storm of protest within the club and at next SSC AGM, members turned up in numbers to ouster the Executive Committee. “We need to have a constitution that attracts top, quality, independent and respected individuals. I’m really happy we have a Minister who is happy to look at the constitution. Now we have to hope the gentlemen in the committee will come up with a good proposal,” added Wettimuny. Roshan Ranasinghe may not be a popular man among his political colleagues but his popularity among Sri Lankan cricket fans around the world is soaring. Published on By Britain’s Andy Murray reached his first ATP semi-final since June by going the distance again to beat French qualifier Alexandre Muller at the Qatar Open.Murray, 35, fought back to win 4-6 6-1 6-2 against 26-year-old Muller, who was playing in his first ATP quarter-final.The Scot will play Jiri Lehecka in the last four after the 21-year-old Czech beat top seed Andrey Rublev. “He is one of the best young players on the tour, it’ll be a big test for me,” said former world number one Murray. “He has started the year extremely well, did well at the Australian Open and hits a huge ball.” Murray, who last reached the semi-finals of a tournament at the Stuttgart Open, has long been targeting deeper runs and playing against the inexperienced Muller provided a fantastic opportunity.However, the issue for Murray in recent months has been recovering from gruelling battles in time for the next match. All of his four previous wins in 2023 had gone to a deciding set, showcasing Murray’s fighting spirit and physical endurance.This quarter-final – less than 24 hours after a long and gutsy win over Germany’s former world number two Alexander Zverev – followed the same pattern. Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, seemingly sensing a quick start would be beneficial after a short turnaround, did that by breaking for 2-0 before a careless third game allowed Muller to break back.From that point the Frenchman relaxed and showed his power on the way to winning the first set in 53 minutes. One of Murray’s trademarks is his resilience and he responded by upping his level in the second set.Playing smarter and serving strongly, he denied Muller the time he had in the opening set to pick his shots and Murray’s level remained high in the decider. “I would love to win one [title]but I have goals to achieve more than that,” Murray, who triumphed in Doha in 2008 and 2009, said. “I am putting myself in a position now to do that going into the last couple of matches. “I feel like these last few weeks are a step in the right direction and if I continue to play and compete like I am now, that I will have not just one opportunity to win a title but I will have more chances to do that in this last stage of my career.” Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev will play second seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the other semi-final. Russia’s Medvedev beat Australia’s Christopher O’Connell 6-2 4-6 7-5 while Canada’s Auger-Aliassime came through 6-4 7-6 (7-5) against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain. Published on By Qualification for the 2024 T20 World Cup resumes in Buenos Aires on Saturday (February 25) as six teams gather in the Argentine capital to contest the Americas Sub-Regional Qualifier T20. Hosts Argentina are joined by Bermuda, The Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands and Panama to vie for three qualifier berths alongside Canada at the Americas regional finals, one step away from the T20 World Cup. With the United States automatically qualifying for the 2024 World Cup as co-hosts with the West Indies, combined with the replacement of the Global Qualifier with direct regional qualification, the path to the ICC’s pinnacle T20 event is less arduous than usual for lower-ranked Americas Associates. For the three teams winning through this tournament, a turn on the global stage will be just one step away as they head to the Regional Final in Bermuda at the end of September. Though there will be only one qualification spot on offer at the regional final and Canada remain firm favourites to take it, for the six teams in Buenos Aires this cycle represents a rare opportunity to make a bid for World Cup qualification should they secure a podium finish this week. In the absence of Brazil and Suriname, both of whom pulled out of the tournament, the six teams will compete in a single group, playing a simple round robin with the top three sides on the table progressing to join Canada at the four-team regional final. The only team at the tournament with a World Cup pedigree, Bermuda have slipped back into the pack somewhat since their heyday, but remain overwhelming favourites to win the tournament. Convincing wins over the hosts in two warm-up matches ahead of the tournament underlined their status, with Delray Rawlins and Kamau Leverock especially looking a cut above the grade. Argentina will fancy their chances of a top-three finish, with home conditions in their favour and a recent winning record over most of the rest of the field. An exception there is the returning Cayman Islands side however, Raymon Sealy’s team having a strong claim to the title of “best of the rest” in the region behind the USA, Canada and Bermuda. A five-nothing whitewash at the hands of the Caymans in their most recent competitive outing last year suggests that the Bahamas will be outsiders to progress, though if skipper Marc Taylor or Kervon Hinds fire they may have the next best shot at a podium finish. Belize and Panama both start as underdogs, despite boasting potentially match-winners in the likes of Bernan Stephenson or Irfan Hafejee respectively, neither have yet been able to consistently compete at regional level.

Published on By Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has won many admirers in cricket circles for giving an undertaking to the court that he will initiate constitutional reforms to Sri Lanka Cricket and keeping to his word, he has appointed a ten member committee headed by Supreme Court judge K. T. Chitrasiri. The committee will work with the ICC and come up with a new constitution for SLC that has come under fire for having too many voting clubs at the AGM. Respected former cricketer Sidath Wettimuny, who was one of the 12 petitioners who went before the court highlighting flaws in cricket administration welcomed the move by the Minister of Sports. “Hats off to the current Sports Minister for realizing that this is such a crucial matter and agreeing to bring in reforms. We have come so close to changing the constitution, but in the 11th hour those efforts were crushed . Like in 2015 when former Supreme Court Judge Prasanna Jayawardene had come up with a new constitution. The ICC had given the green light. We had the blessings of the then Prime Minister but still couldn’t push it through,” noted Wettimuny, who headed the cricket board in 2015 and worked towards the change of constitution. When the Yahapalanaya government came into power in 2015, efforts had been taken to bring in constitutional reforms to SLC with the full backing of then Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake. But with President Maithripala Sirisena taking over the Sports Ministry to the SLFP, constitutional reforms were stalled and elections were called. “Ideally we would like to see a Board which is less politically driven with less votes. A system which is free of corruption and has more transparency and accountability,” Wettimuny added. “We’ve had so many issues over the years. I have been in eight Interim Committees and they were put in place because there were problems,” stressed Wettimuny.

The Proteas, inconsistent in the competition's group stages, were given no chance against England in Friday's semi-final at the same venue. READ | Proteas solidify hero status after rocking England in SF Yet, after a spirited performance of grit, determination and fearlessness, they emerged as six-run victors to punch their ticket to a tournament decider for the first time in South African cricket history. The tears at the end of the match showed just how much this moment meant, while the reaction from the South African public has broken new barriers. Hundreds queued outside Newlands on Saturday morning in a desperate attempt to purchase tickets. They will be sold out. \"It's been an amazing tournament so far, on and off the field. As far as cricket is concerned, we're achieving the goals that we want to, and that's awesome to see,\" Luus told media. \"Off the field, we're also doing the job we wanted to do. The goal for us was to inspire a nation and get women's cricket in South Africa on the map.

किसी न किसी मसले के चलते चर्चा में बने रहते हैं। वहीं इस समय भारत में टीम इंडिया और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच 4 मैचों की रोचक बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी खेली जा रही है। जिसके पहले दो मैच भारतीय टीम ने अपने नाम कर तहलका मचा रखा है। सीरीज का अगला मुकाबला 1 मार्च से इंदौर में खेला जाना है। जिससे पहले अब सौरव गांगुली ने ऐसी भविष्यवाणी की है जो ऑस्ट्रेलियाई खेमे को एक नजर नहीं भाएगी। भारतीय क्रिकेट कंट्रोल बोर्ड के पूर्व अध्यक्ष सौरव गांगुली ने भारत और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के बीच जारी टेस्ट सीरीज को लेकर बहुत बड़ी भविष्यवाणी की है। उनका मानना है कि बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी में रोहित शर्मा एंड कंपनी ऑस्ट्रेलिया का सूपड़ा साफ करने वाला है। यानी 4-0 से कंगारुओं को मात देने वाला है। सौरव गांगुली ने कहा, 'मैं 4-0 देख रहा हूं। ऑस्ट्रेलिया के लिए भारत को हराना मुश्किल होगा। इन परिस्थितियों में हम बेहतर टीम हैं।' आपको बता दें कि भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम ने ऑस्ट्रेलिया को नागपुर और दिल्ली में खेले गए पहले दोनो टेस्ट मैच 3 दिन में ही हराकर करारी शिकस्त दी है। जिसके चलते भारत के पास सीरीज में 2-0 की अजय बढ़त भी है। जहां नागपुर टेस्ट में भारत ने कंगारुओं को एक पारी और 132 रनों से मात दी थी। तो वहीं दिल्ली में 6 विकेट से धूल चटाई थी। इसके अलावा भारत ने लगातार चौथी बार बॉर्डर गावस्कर ट्रॉफी को रिटेन भी कर लिया है। बहरहाल, अगर ऑस्ट्रेलिया को भारत के खिलाफ बीजीटी में 4-0 की हार से बचना है तो आगामी दोनों मुकाबलों में उन्हें पूरी तरह से खुद को झोंकना होगा।","pubDate":"2023-02-25

Connor Shields bagged a brace after Jack Thomson and Aaron Healy had already fired past Accies, who grabbed a consolation through substitute Dario Zanatta in the 4-1 defeat. And Rankin reckoned the drive and determination that had got them off the bottom of the Championship with victory over Inverness in midweek was sorely lacking as they were brushed aside on their home patch.

Hamilton's Scott Martin (L) and Queen's Park's Aaron Healy in action \"In the second half I thought we could have attacked and caused problems with the system we were in at that time, but the second goal kills the game. \"At that point the heads went down but we came back to 3-1 and at that point JP has a really good chance, and if he scores that it would have been game on. \"So I'm disappointed by that aspect. \"But the spirit that has been there the last seven or eight weeks was lacking when we went a goal down.\" Rankin also took aim at his substitutes - goalscorer Zanatta excluded - for their failure to positively impact the game. He added: \"We were looking for a spark today. \"Our subs have made a massive impact in games recently and today they didn't do it, other than Dario who came on and scored. \"I felt the subs let us down in terms of making an impact.

He could be a doubt with his injury being assessed over the weekend and Rankin says he will wrap the Australian defender in cotton wool ahead of Friday's huge clash with bottom of the table Arbroath. \"I think it was more precautionary him coming off,\" Rankin revealed. Hamilton's Dylan McGowan goes down injured \"It was a pass he received and he felt a wee twinge. I don't think he wanted to take any risks. \"Dylan hadn't played a lot of minutes in the first part of the season so his minutes we need to manage as well. Asking him to go Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday - and what I think has been seven games in the last 28 days - takes its toll. \"It [him coming off] impacted us because he has been our leader for the last seven or eight games and been a hugely influential figure, but when you look at others around him, he's led them for a long time so now they need to take responsibility and stand up. \"That's how I look at it. \"But when he came off I found the pitch quiet. Not only did we lose his voice, I felt we lost a number of voices. \"And at that stage in the game, we need characters. We need people to stand up. \"A few of us looked leggy but we need to ready to go again. \"We'll wrap a few of them up in cotton wool and be ready to go fight our corner on Friday.\" Read More Related Articles Hibs player joins Airdrie on emergency loan deal Read More Related Articles My Hearts mentor Rankin had my backing to get Accies back on track, says Smith All the latest sport news in Lanarkshire EK kid makes impact at Cricket World Cup Sophia signs 'life-changing' City deal Raith v Accies Trust Trophy final set Rovers sign striker with big potential Follow Lanarkshire Live Sport on Twitter via @LanLiveSport , like us on Facebook or find us on Instagram for the latest sports news, pictures and video.

The sustained success of the women’s national team and the Women’s Big Bash League that underpins it coincides with the registration of five-year-old to 12-year-old female players crashing through the 20,000 mark for the first time. Peninsula Cricket Club all girls Woolworths Blast team are among the 20,000 registered female cricketers in Australia aged between five and 12. Credit: James Brickwood Australia will meet South Africa in the final in Cape Town on Sunday night (starting at midnight AEDT). Since 2010, there have been 10 women’s 50-over or T20 World Cups. Australia have now made nine finals and can claim their eighth crown with a win against the host nation. For former Australian captain and Hall of Famer Belinda Clark, the rise and rise of women’s cricket is a world away from when she started playing the game as the only girl in the entire Newcastle competition. Clark said current stars such as captain Meg Lanning , Alyssa Healy and Ellyse Perry would have been in a similar situation. “It’s highly likely that all three would have been the only girl in their team at club level, and so now you look at where we’re at,” Clark told the Herald and The Age . “Sure, girls can still play in mixed competitions, but they’ve also got an opportunity to play in all-girls competitions as well, and all-girls teams, which is a massive leap.” There is also a massive leap coming for Australia’s elite players just days after the final when the inaugural Women’s Premier League begins in India.

Clark believes that the WPL will do great things for elite women’s cricket and make India into a powerhouse, as their men’s team is proving to be as they head for a third successive Test series victory over Australia. “The advantage to the players is twofold,” Clark said of the WPL. “It’s obviously financial, which is a good thing. And the stakes are raised again: there are private owners who have expectations and a broadcaster that’s paid a lot of money for the tournament. “I think any time that you’re playing with pressure applied is helpful, so that’s positive. “From an Indian perspective, they have been hesitating to actually put these tournaments on. They’ve been running the invitational challenge for a couple of years. “The fact that they got such a big impact from people that wanted clubs, the broadcasters that wanted to put it on television, I think that’s given India confidence that they’re on the right path.

When she and her Australian teammates arrived home they received a bill to help pay for the privilege. Sports news, results and expert commentary.
