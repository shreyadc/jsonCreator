And we would like to win the series 3-0. Our approach is to dominate Sri Lanka in the second match,тАЭ said Pooja Vastrakar in a pre-match press conference. тАЬI am spending a lot of time in the practice sessions, with the bowling coach and batting coach. Earlier I had no experience, now I have gained experience by talking to most of my seniors. After getting so much experience now I can go to the ground and imply those suggestions in the game,тАЭ she added. Talking about the other young bowlers in the team, Vastrakar said, тАЬWe are all young and have known each other since under-19 days. Everyone is friendly within the team, so because of this also it feels good to work with other bowlers.тАЭ Match Details Sri Lanka Women vs India Women, 2nd ODI Venue: Pallekele International Stadium, Pallekele Date & Time: July 2 at 10 AM IST Live Streaming and TV details: Fancode SL-W vs IND-W Dream 11 Prediction Wicketkeeper: Anushka Sanjeewani Batters: Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Harleen Deol, Nilakshi Silva All-rounders: Harmanpreet Kaur, Chamari Athapaththu, Deepti Sharma Bowlers: Oshadi Ranasinghe, Inoka Ranaweera, Renuka Singh Captain: Deepti Sharma Vice-Captain: Nilakshi Silva SL-W vs IND-W Probable Playing XI Sri Lanka Women: Hasini Perera, Chamari Athapaththu (c), Hansima Karunaratne, Kavisha Dilhari, Harshitha Madavi, Nilakshi de Silva, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Oshadi Ranasinghe, Rashmi de Silva, Inoka Ranaweera, Achini Kulasuriya India Women: Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Harleen Deol, Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Yastika Bhatia (wk), Richa Ghosh, Deepti Sharma, Pooja Vastrakar, Renuka Singh, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Meghna Singh","pubDate":"2022-07-04 02:05:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND-W vs SL-W 2nd ODI LIVE Streaming Details: When and Where to watch India Women vs Sri Lanka Women LIVE in India","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-w-vs-sl-w-2nd-odi-live-streaming-details-when-and-where-to-watch-india-women-vs-sri-lanka-women-live-in-india-2481204.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND-W vs SL-W 2nd ODI LIVE Streaming Details: Check When and Where to watch Harmanpreet KaurтАЩs Team India vs Sri Lanka Women Cricket Match LIVE.","content":"The Indian womenтАЩs cricket team would look for some stability from its top-order as the visitors aim to seal the three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in the second game in Pallekele on Monday (July 4). After clinching the preceding T20 series 2-1, India have taken a 1-0 lead in the ODI series by winning the low-scoring first match by four wickets. тАЬOur approach will be the same as before, we have to win the series 3-0 and dominate all the matches. Whatever plans and preparations we have we made we need to execute,тАЭ all-rounder Pooja Vastrakar said at the pre-match press conference. Despite the comfortable win, the Indian think tank would be a little concerned about the opening pair of vice-captain Smriti Mandhana and young Shafali Verma. Both the batters have got a few runs but have not been able to translate them into big scores. The duo has failed to build a decent partnership on the tour so far, denying the team from electrifying starts which it is known for. And both Mandhana and Verma would be gunning for a big score with just two matches remaining on tour. India take 1-0 lead in the 3-match series. #SLvIND #SLWomen pic.twitter.com/Oq6unm3gcA тАФ Sri Lanka Cricket (@OfficialSLC) July 1, 2022 Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur , on the other hand, seems to be relishing her role, scoring runs and providing breakthroughs with her part-time off-spin. The Indian bowlers, especially the slower ones, are simply enjoying the low and slow Sri Lankan tracks and have played a crucial role in the team's victories on the tour. Right-arm medium pacer Renuka Singh excelled with figures of 3 for 29, however, it was Deepti SharmaтАЩs off-breaks that broke Sri LankaтАЩs backbone and restricted the hosts to 171 all out in the first ODI. While the Indian bowlers have excelled on the tour, the batters have been plagued by inconsistencies. Verma, once again, squandered a promising start as the top order crumbled while chasing a modest total in the opening ODI. The middle order comprising the likes of Harmanpreet, Harleen Deol, Deepti, who showed her all-round capabilities and Pooja Vastrakar bailed India out in the opener. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, would hope skipper Chamari Athapaththu can inspire the side with the bat after a relative poor show so far.

The ECB team which will also include security and vigilance officials will inspect arrangements at three major cities of the country -- Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi -- the potential venues to host the seven-match series. The PCB wants the team to also visit Multan Stadium where Pakistan played three-match One-Day series against West Indies with immense success. The repeated full houses at the Multan Stadium during that particular series forced the PCBтАЩs think-tank to consider the venue for the England tour too. However, the ECB has yet to show any interest to consider the venue seriously. тАЬOur efforts have been to convince the ECB to send the team to Multan as well. Besides being one of the best stadiums in the country, MultanтАЩs crowd loves the game and is highly supportive of good cricket no matter from which bat the runs are flowing and who is holding the leather for quality delivery. However, it is up to the ECB to decide on the venues. It is believed that two venues from three major cities are to host the seven-match series which will be finalised at the end of teamтАЩs visit to Pakistan,тАЭ a PCB source said. England team is due to arrive here on September 15 and planned to leave in October to Australia for the World Cup T20 and a pre-Cup T20 series. Within 18 days of the teamтАЩs stay in Pakistan, England will be playing seven matches. тАЬTo hold the series on two venues is the best option available. If not Multan then Lahore and Karachi are the best available centres because of their bigger capacities. Such a series is always meant to attract the crowd and get the best possible financial return. Lahore and Karachi are the centres where we expect a better return. Pindi Stadium has a smaller capacity of around thirteen thousand spectators. So the Pindi StadiumтАЩs option would fetch little. However, the ultimate decision will be taken by the ECB on the recommendations of the visiting team.тАЭ Though the ECB has yet to communicate the security teamтАЩs arrival dates, it is believed that it would be here in the third week of July.","pubDate":"2022-07-04 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KPL-II set to begin next month in Muzaffarabad","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/971274-kpl-ii-set-to-begin-next-month-in-muzaffarabad","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The second edition of Kashmir Premier League is set to blast off next month in Muzaffarabad after the Pakistan Cricket Board issued No-Objection Certificate .According to an official of the KPL, they received NOC from the PCB after which the drafts for second edition will take place...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-04 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stokes fails to punish India for awful drops","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/stokes-fails-to-punish-india-for-awful-drops/video/eb4a242a669aafc60b860aecedf58c71","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Despite being gifted two lives by India after they dropped a couple of absolute sitters, England skipper Ben Stokes couldn't capitalize on the chances after his Indian counterpart held on to a screamer to dismiss him.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-03 23:27:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jonny Bairstow dismisses Virat Kohli spat as тАШgreat craicтАЩ at Edgbaston","link":"https://metro.co.uk/2022/07/03/jonny-bairstow-gives-his-take-on-virat-kohli-spat-at-edgbaston-16935488/","keywords":["Cricket","England cricket","Jonny Bairstow","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Phil Haigh"],"video_url":null,"description":"'It's passion, it's what you play for.'","content":"Jonny Bairstow played down his clash with Virat Kohli during EnglandтАЩs Test match with India on Sunday, saying it was тАШgreat craicтАЩ at Edgbaston.

Viewers dare not miss his controversial press conferences тАФ and remarkably, Kyrgios is now even being tipped as a potential Wimbledon champion. The astonishing prediction comes despite extraordinary scenes on No1 Court over the weekend where the 27-year-old Aussie was branded тАЬevilтАЭ and a тАЬbullyтАЭ by his opponent. Earlier in the tournament he was even fined ┬г8,000 for SPITTING at a spectator. But tennis experts say that in spite of his terrible behaviour, Kyrgios has what it takes to hold aloft the menтАЩs singles trophy and collect a cheque for ┬г2million. Kyrgios тАФ who has never progressed further than the quarter finals of any grand slam тАФ is in action again today, against 20-year-old American Brandon Nakashima. And the crowd will again expect fireworks on the court, where the bad boy can smash 140mph serves with an incredible 75 per cent accuracy. To rattle his opponents, he will even serve underarm. On Saturday, the world No40 riled Stefanos Tsitsipas so much that the Greek player repeatedly tried to hit balls at him and angrily twice deliberately smashed shots into the crowd, narrowly missing fans. After losing, No4 Wimbledon hope Stefanos complained of his opponent: тАЬItтАЩs constant bullying. He was probably a bully at school. I donтАЩt like bullies. тАЬHe has some good traits in his character, as well. But he also has a very evil side to him, which if itтАЩs exposed, can really do a lot of harm to the people around him.тАЭ Kyrgios hit back: тАЬHeтАЩs got some serious issues. тАЬIтАЩve got many friends. IтАЩm actually one of the most liked. HeтАЩs not liked. LetтАЩs just put that there. The starтАЩs unmistakable style has split pundits, with some praising his pure entertainment value and others claiming he is a stain on the game. BBC tennis analyst Laura Robson says fans are watching Kyrgios for the тАЬwrong reasonsтАЭ, hoping he will тАЬself-implodeтАЭ. Even McEnroe, now 63, has warned him over his temper, saying: тАЬI hope he sees the writing on the wall before this gets chronic.тАЭ But former British No1 Andrew Castle describes Kyrgios as тАЬpure box officeтАЭ and insists his unpredictability is what fans love about him. Later today KyrgiosтАЩs stunning fianc├йe, 21-year-old social media influencer Costeen Hatzi , and his dad George, will be among a sell-out crowd on Centre Court. His mum Nill is a member of the Malaysian royal family but gave up using the title princess when she moved to Australia and fell in love with painter and decorator George, who had emigrated from Greece. Nick gets his feisty attitude from his mum who, when he came to London in 2014 to play in his first tournament, told her son he would be beaten by Spanish ace Rafa Nadal . Kyrgios was so incensed he beat the fansтАЩ favourite in four sets тАФ his best-ever Wimbledon result. Since then controversy has followed him around the world as he battled against umpires and opponents alike. At the 2016 Australian Open he swore and complained about music coming from the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground. Fuming Kyrgios screamed at British umpire James Keothavong : тАЬMate, are you OK? ThereтАЩs music playing in the crowd. тАЬIтАЩve told you seven times. Am I hearing things? Mate, itтАЩs a circus.тАЭ As Kyrgios walked off the court after losing to Czech Tomas Berdych , he shouted at the official: тАЬYouтАЩre a terrible referee.тАЭ The previous year he goaded Stan Wawrinka at the Canadian Open by telling him that low-ranking Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis тАЬbanged your girlfriend. Sorry to tell you that, mateтАЭ. Microphones also picked up Kyrgios saying under his breath that Wawrinka, who was 30 at the time, was тАЬbanging 18-year-oldsтАЭ. His sponsor, Bonds underwear, dropped him for the outburst. He crashed out of the 2017 French Open, losing to South AfricaтАЩs Kevin Anderson , after deliberately smashing two racquets тАФ and asking a spectator for a beer mid-match. During a clash with BritainтАЩs Kyle Edmund in the 2019 Rogers Cup, Kyrgios refused to play on until he was given a white towel instead of the tournament-branded ones. When the pristine item arrived, he berated officials because they had taken 20 minutes to get it to him. Kyrgios was fined ┬г17,000 at the Italian Open after losing the plot when he was given a game penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. He threw a fold-up chair on to the court and shouted about the umpire: тАЬIтАЩm giving 100 per cent to deal with f***ing idiots like him. IтАЩm f***ing done with it.тАЭ With that he slung his bag over his shoulder and stormed off, forfeiting the match to NorwayтАЩs Casper Ruud. That same year he lashed out at Nadal at the Cincinnati Masters. He said of his opponentтАЩs slow service routine: тАЬIf Rafa plays that quick IтАЩm retiring from tennis.тАЭ Kyrgios was then denied a bathroom break. He took it anyway тАФ smashing two racquets before returning to the court. At that yearтАЩs Laver Cup he claimed he had lost concentration during his defeat to Roger Federer because he had spotted a тАЬreally hot chick in the crowdтАЭ. He said: тАЬIтАЩm being genuinely honest тАФ IтАЩd marry her right now.тАЭ Kyrgios does have a soft side. He wonтАЩt eat meat because he wants to protect animals. He has had several stunning girlfriends тАФ but his relationships have ended in acrimony too. In 2015 he dated Croatian-born tennis pro Ajla Tomljanovic , who played for Australia. Nick said: тАЬItтАЩs when IтАЩm with her that I am the happiest.тАЭ But the couple split in 2017 after Kyrgios was photographed partying with other female tennis players. He later hinted at a reunion but the romance never rekindled. For two months in 2020 he dated Russian player Anna Kalinskaya , who later told her Instagram followers: тАЬWe broke up. We arenтАЩt friends.тАЭ Kyrgios was soon making comments about wanting to sleep with good-looking fans. Though last summer he announced on Instagram тАЬHappiness is FoundтАЭ with model Chiara Passari . Yet by October police were called to a quarantine hotel in Adelaide to deal with a row between the pair. The following month she called Kyrgios a тАЬplayerтАЭ and after he sent roses as an apology she fumed: тАЬWho sends someone roses while still doing the same s***?тАЭ Passari accused him of being тАЬafraid to be aloneтАЭ after he then fell in love with interior designer Costeen Hatzi . The beautiful influencer shared her first post of Kyrgios on January 2 with a mirror selfie of them together in the bathroom тАФ after he had left the toilet seat up. Hatzi captioned it: тАЬNot a bad way to start 2022,тАЭ and added a love heart. By May he was claiming they would be married тАЬvery soonтАЭ and showing off a new tattoo in tribute to her. Kyrgios claims to not even like playing tennis but insists he is the worldтАЩs best grass-court player. And now he has the Wimbledon trophy in his sights. He says: тАЬI just want to remind everyone that IтАЩm pretty good. I think itтАЩs my best chance to win a grand slam of all the four.тАЭ His army of new fans know they will be royally entertained every step of the way. NICK KYRGIOS is great for the game. HeтАЩs box office, and why do we watch sport? Because it is unpredictable. With Kyrgios, I donтАЩt know whether I am going to see a great exhibition of shot-making or a psychological meltdown. ItтАЩs a potent combination and one that crowds adore the man for. Wimbledon scheduled him on Court 12 for his first round match and you could not move for the queue. His first victim was BritainтАЩs Paul Jubb , undone in five gruelling sets and with the customary drama. A line judge reported Kyrgios to the umpire. Cue the meltdown. He called her a тАЬsnitchтАЭ in a 15-minute press conference that was as entertaining as many matches. Messily eating sushi while talking, he could not understand why anyone would call him a hypocrite for criticising somebody doing their job while he was doing his. He also admitted spitting in the direction of a fan who was against him on court. I commentated on his match on Court Two a day later and he was simply magnificent in dismissing Filip Krajinovic . Moving to Court One led us to his confrontation with Stefanos Tsitsipas. Tsitsipas hit a ball into the crowd and Kyrgios wanted him kicked out of the tournament. The locker room might not consider it тАЬsportsmanlikeтАЭ but that will not bother the Aussie. He feels he has been victimised time and again. Tsitsipas was intent on hitting Kyrgios with a ball for the remainder of the match but missed, despite a couple of first-class opportunities. And when Kyrgios served him underarm he smacked the ball out of the arena again and was given a point penalty. Insult to injury. The crowd were lapping it up, as were the TV viewers as he made it to round four. This guy is fascinating. The reason I know this is that Mrs Castle will always tune in when he is playing. He is complex, dangerous, talented and sensitive, a potent combination, and may yet have a big say in who wins this tournament. I would love to see Kyrgios play Rafa Nadal in the semi-final. They are polar opposites тАУ and opposites donтАЩt attract.

Kyrgios was fined ┬г17,000 at the Italian Open after losing the plot when he was given a game penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. He threw a fold-up chair on to the court and shouted about the umpire: тАЬIтАЩm giving 100 per cent to deal with f***ing idiots like him. IтАЩm f***ing done with it.тАЭ With that he slung his bag over his shoulder and stormed off, forfeiting the match to NorwayтАЩs Casper Ruud. That same year he lashed out at Nadal at the Cincinnati Masters. He said of his opponentтАЩs slow service routine: тАЬIf Rafa plays that quick IтАЩm retiring from tennis.тАЭ Kyrgios was then denied a bathroom break. He took it anyway тАФ smashing two racquets before returning to the court. At that yearтАЩs Laver Cup he claimed he had lost concentration during his defeat to Roger Federer because he had spotted a тАЬreally hot chick in the crowdтАЭ. He said: тАЬIтАЩm being genuinely honest тАФ IтАЩd marry her right now.тАЭ Kyrgios does have a soft side. He wonтАЩt eat meat because he wants to protect animals. He has had several stunning girlfriends тАФ but his relationships have ended in acrimony too. In 2015 he dated Croatian-born tennis pro Ajla Tomljanovic , who played for Australia. Nick said: тАЬItтАЩs when IтАЩm with her that I am the happiest.тАЭ But the couple split in 2017 after Kyrgios was photographed partying with other female tennis players. He later hinted at a reunion but the romance never rekindled. For two months in 2020 he dated Russian player Anna Kalinskaya , who later told her Instagram followers: тАЬWe broke up. We arenтАЩt friends.тАЭ Kyrgios was soon making comments about wanting to sleep with good-looking fans. Though last summer he announced on Instagram тАЬHappiness is FoundтАЭ with model Chiara Passari . Yet by October police were called to a quarantine hotel in Adelaide to deal with a row between the pair. The following month she called Kyrgios a тАЬplayerтАЭ and after he sent roses as an apology she fumed: тАЬWho sends someone roses while still doing the same s***?тАЭ Passari accused him of being тАЬafraid to be aloneтАЭ after he then fell in love with interior designer Costeen Hatzi . The beautiful influencer shared her first post of Kyrgios on January 2 with a mirror selfie of them together in the bathroom тАФ after he had left the toilet seat up. Hatzi captioned it: тАЬNot a bad way to start 2022,тАЭ and added a love heart. By May he was claiming they would be married тАЬvery soonтАЭ and showing off a new tattoo in tribute to her. Kyrgios claims to not even like playing tennis but insists he is the worldтАЩs best grass-court player. And now he has the Wimbledon trophy in his sights. He says: тАЬI just want to remind everyone that IтАЩm pretty good. I think itтАЩs my best chance to win a grand slam of all the four.тАЭ His army of new fans know they will be royally entertained every step of the way. NICK KYRGIOS is great for the game. HeтАЩs box office, and why do we watch sport? Because it is unpredictable. With Kyrgios, I donтАЩt know whether I am going to see a great exhibition of shot-making or a psychological meltdown. ItтАЩs a potent combination and one that crowds adore the man for. Wimbledon scheduled him on Court 12 for his first round match and you could not move for the queue. His first victim was BritainтАЩs Paul Jubb , undone in five gruelling sets and with the customary drama. A line judge reported Kyrgios to the umpire. Cue the meltdown. He called her a тАЬsnitchтАЭ in a 15-minute press conference that was as entertaining as many matches. Messily eating sushi while talking, he could not understand why anyone would call him a hypocrite for criticising somebody doing their job while he was doing his. He also admitted spitting in the direction of a fan who was against him on court. I commentated on his match on Court Two a day later and he was simply magnificent in dismissing Filip Krajinovic . Moving to Court One led us to his confrontation with Stefanos Tsitsipas. Tsitsipas hit a ball into the crowd and Kyrgios wanted him kicked out of the tournament. The locker room might not consider it тАЬsportsmanlikeтАЭ but that will not bother the Aussie. He feels he has been victimised time and again. Tsitsipas was intent on hitting Kyrgios with a ball for the remainder of the match but missed, despite a couple of first-class opportunities. And when Kyrgios served him underarm he smacked the ball out of the arena again and was given a point penalty. Insult to injury. The crowd were lapping it up, as were the TV viewers as he made it to round four. This guy is fascinating. The reason I know this is that Mrs Castle will always tune in when he is playing. He is complex, dangerous, talented and sensitive, a potent combination, and may yet have a big say in who wins this tournament. I would love to see Kyrgios play Rafa Nadal in the semi-final. They are polar opposites тАУ and opposites donтАЩt attract.

Bairstow completed his third hundred in successive Tests before falling for 106 overnight Sunday to give England some hope of winning the series-decider. BairstowтАЩs latest century was the cornerstone of EnglandтАЩs 284 in reply to IndiaтАЩs 416, a deficit of 132 runs. The visitors were 3/125 at stumps on day three тАУ 257 runs ahead. BairstowтАЩs century followed scores against New Zealand of 136 at Trent Bridge and 162 at his Headingley home ground, where he also made an unbeaten 71 in the second innings. But he fell to the first ball of Mohammed ShamiтАЩs new spell when an edged drive flew to former India captain Kohli at first slip. Kohli, who earlier Sunday had been spoken to by the umpires following a verbal altercation with Bairstow, blew a kiss to celebrate. And the Poms werenтАЩt happy about it. No other England batsman made more than Sam BillingsтАЩ 36, with the wicketkeeper one of four wickets for Mohammed Siraj. But with England having chased down seemingly stiff targets of 277, 299 and 296 during a recent 3-0 whitewash of Test world champions New Zealand, there was still work for India to do with the bat. They lost Shubman Gill to just the third ball of their second innings, caught in the slips off England great James Anderson. Hanuma Vihari (22) and Kohli (20) were also removed before stumps. England had resumed in the dire position of 84-5 in a match they have to win to square this five-match series at 2-2. Against New Zealand, their first series under their new leadership duo of Stokes and red-ball coach Brendon McCullum, the team had several times hit its way out of trouble. But for all the talk of the new тАШBazballтАЩ approach, a reference to former New Zealand captain McCullumтАЩs nickname, Bairstow still played himself in against IndiaтАЩs impressive pace attack. Bairstow was 16 not out off 65 balls before, playing orthodox but powerfully hit strokes, he accelerated in scoring his next 84 runs off just 54 balls as the 32-year-old went to his fifth Test century of 2022. He brought up his latest hundred when a push off seamer Shardul Thakur was misfielded on the cover rope to give the Yorkshireman his 14th four in 119 balls. He also hit two sixes.

(Photo by Geoff Caddick / AFP) Source: Getty Images It was no more than Shami, who bowled far better than figures of 2-78 in 22 overs, deserved. All-rounder Stokes, nought not out overnight, batted in frantic fashion for 25. Already dropped on 18, when Shardul Thakur floored a routine catch at cover, Stokes was missed again on 25 when India stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah dropped a low chance at mid-off, with Thakur the unlucky bowler on this occasion. But next ball Stokes drove harder and higher, only for Bumrah, diving to his left, to hold a brilliant catch and one far harder than the chance he had missed. That catch continued an excellent all-round match for Bumrah, leading India for the first time after regular captain Rohit Sharma was sidelined by Covid-19. The tailender had smashed Stuart Broad for 29 in an over costing a total of 35 тАУ the most expensive in Test history тАУ in a flourish to a total built on hundreds from Rishabh Pant (146) and Ravindra Jadeja (104). Bumrah, in his more familiar new-ball role, then removed all of EnglandтАЩs top three. That gave him 21 wickets in the series, the most by an Indian bowler in a series in England. This decider should have been played in Manchester last September only to be postponed just hours before the start because of coronavirus concerns within the India camp. тАУ with AFP","pubDate":"2022-07-03 19:55:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jonny Bairstow ready for England to chase any India total in fifth Test","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/03/jonny-bairstow-ready-for-england-to-chase-any-india-total-in-fifth-test","keywords":["Jonny Bairstow","England v India 2021","England cricket team","India cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew at Edgbaston"],"video_url":null,"description":"тАШWhateverтАЩs set is set and weтАЩll go about it,тАЩ says YorkshiremanBairstow plays down pointed conversation with Virat KohliтАЬWhatever weтАЩre set, weтАЩll try and chase,тАЭ Jonny Bairstow said with a shrug, as England stared down the barrel of a daunting fourth-innings target in the fifth Test.India are already 257 runs ahead with just three wickets down but EnglandтАЩs centurion was supremely relaxed about the prospect, declaring: тАЬPlaying in the manner we are, youтАЩre going to lose games of cricket.тАЭ Continue reading...","content":"тАЬWhatever weтАЩre set, weтАЩll try and chase,тАЭ Jonny Bairstow said with a shrug, as England stared down the barrel of a daunting fourth-innings target in the fifth Test.

And it was a reflective as well as a relaxed Bairstow who emerged to face the media at stumps on day three, a man who has endured a good deal of strife during his decade in an England shirt and who is now determined simply to enjoy his cricket. тАЬThereтАЩs no point going over old ground,тАЭ he said when asked about some of the harder times: the defeats, the dismissals, the ceaseless shifts up and down the order. тАЬItтАЩs been an eventful journey, an enjoyable journey, with heartbreak at times.

At stumps, India are 125/3 in 45 overs, with Pujara stitching an unbeaten stand of 50 with Rishabh Pant (30 not out). Gaining a 132-run lead after Mohammed Siraj picked four wickets while Jasprit Bumrah scalped three in a second session comeback to bowl out England for 284 in 61.3 overs, with Jonny Bairstow making a belligerent 106. India will be aware that England have had chased 277, 299 and 296 in their last three games and would need to bat for as long as possible to inch closer to gaining the Pataudi Trophy. In the final session, Hanuma Vihari was enticed by Stuart Broad to drive, but the safe hands of Bairstow took the catch safely at slip. Virat Kohli got off the mark with a cover drive and replayed it when Broad returned in his next over. Pujara continued with his risk-free play and even survived a close lbw appeal when Matthew Potts rapped him on his front pad. Kohli stroked James Anderson for an impressive off-drive before Ben Stokes got one to kick up from length and took the glove edge of Kohli to wicketkeeper Sam Billings, who spilled it but Joe Root at first slip completed the catch on rebound. Pujara continued to be patient in leaving balls outside the off-stump, rotating the strike judiciously and hitting an occasional boundary. Pant, the first innings centurion, was off and running with a flick through deep mid-wicket off Broad. As EnglandтАЩs bowlers continued to feed balls to Pant straight towards the leg-stump, he picked ones and twos easily while drilling easy boundaries through mid-on and mid-wicket regions. He even resisted the temptation of hitting Joe Root big when the part-time off-spinner floated loopy deliveries outside off-stump. PujaraтАЩs work on holding one end up bore fruit when he brought up his fifty in his comeback Test with a single flicked through deep mid-wicket before Pant was deceived by low bounce on an attempted cut, which wicketkeeper Sam Billings couldnтАЩt grab, making it a day which clearly belonged to India. Earlier, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah looking threatening with the ball, beating the outer as well as inner edges of both Stokes and Bairstow multiple times. In between, Bairstow had an exchange of words with Virat Kohli, who was fielding in the slip cordon. From 34th over, England seemed to shift gears, with Stokes and Bairstow taking a boundary each off Shami and the latter welcoming Siraj with back-to-back boundaries on both sides of the wicket. Stokes had luck on his side when he skied a shot off Shami, but Shardul Thakur shelled the chance at cover, giving him a life on 18. Bairstow added salt to the wound by smashing the next two balls for boundaries. After Bairstow reached his fifty, Thakur struck in his very first over when Bumrah took a screamer of a catch, diving full length to his left at mid-off to dismiss Stokes just one ball after dropping a sitter of him. But Bairstow continued to march on, smashing short as well as full balls from Siraj and Thakur for boundaries. Post lunch, Bairstow continued from where he left for lunch, clipping Thakur in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep mid-on for a boundary. He then got his century with a crunchy back-foot punch off Thakur square through the off-side, with Jadeja slipping on the boundary and allowing the ball to cross the rope for a boundary. Bumrah and Jadeja combined to concede only six in four overs of sustained pressure. The beneficiary of that tightness was Shami, who delivered the breakthrough for India with the first ball of his spell to end BairstowтАЩs knock at 106 as he couldnтАЩt resist driving hard away from his body and gave a healthy edge to Kohli at first slip, who directed a flying kiss immediately towards him. India peppered Broad with short-pitched stuff and in an attempt to break free, he skied one high in air off Siraj, giving a simple catch to Pant. Siraj got his third scalp when Billings played on while trying to guide the ball through third man and ended EnglandтАЩs innings when Potts nicked to second slip for a low catch, with replays taking long time to decide whether the ball had hit the ground or IyerтАЩs finger was on ground before the catch. With a lead of 132, Anderson struck early, squaring up Shubman Gill up with a ball angling in from a good length and moved away late, with the extra bounce taking the shoulder edge to second slip. Despite EnglandтАЩs bowlers getting to make the ball talk, Pujara and Vihari played risk-free cricket, with the former remaining unbeaten at the end of dayтАЩs play. Brief scores: India 416 and 125/3 in 45 overs (Cheteshwar Pujara 50 not out, Rishabh Pant 30 not out; Ben Stokes 1-22, James Anderson 1-26) lead England 284 in 61.3 overs (Jonny Bairstow 106, Sam Billings 36; Mohammed Siraj 4-66, Jasprit Bumrah 3-68) by 257 runs","pubDate":"2022-07-03 19:15:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"telanganatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jonny Bairstow indispensable to England after so long as spare part | Jonathan Liew","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/03/jonny-bairstow-indispensable-to-england-after-so-long-as-spare-part","keywords":["England v India 2021","Jonny Bairstow","England cricket team","India cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Jonathan Liew at Edgbaston"],"video_url":null,"description":"Even as India tightened their grip on the fifth Test, Bairstow was beautifully unconstrainedThe sound is unique.

The bat of AB de Villiers, meanwhile, always made a delightful pock noise, however violently he was hitting it, as if he was simply helping the ball to wherever it was meant to go. England v India: fifth Test, day three тАУ as it happened Read more When Jonny Bairstow hits the ball exactly the way he wants to hit it, it sounds like music. Like a perfect chord, or a beat of the cleanest drum youтАЩve ever heard. The feet anchor in the crease, the hips square off and the forearms come through in a simple, pure swing. Nothing is wasted or excessive. The sound gives away the purity of the shot long before you can see it. And the ball simply flies, and for a while it feels as if it may never land. There have been times during the past few weeks when it seems as though Bairstow himself has been defying gravity. Clips off the legs race for four. Thick edges fly safely over the slips. Pull shots bisect the field. And even as India pressed home their advantage on day three at Edgbaston, the mood in the stands remained boisterous: a home crowd still basking in the glow of the second summer of Jonny. First the numbers, which are impressive enough: since his career-saving 113 in Sydney in January, Bairstow has made five centuries in nine Tests at an average of 68. So far this calendar year he has scored more runs than any other Test batter. None of this was inevitable. So what happened? How did we go from the pale vestige of a cricketer we glimpsed for much of 2021 to the dominant force we saw here? And тАУ just as intriguingly тАУ why now? Why not earlier? How has a cricketer of such abundant talent spent most of his career fighting entropy? On a watery Sunday morning in Birmingham we got a few clues. India were rampant, relentless, expectant in those early overs. Every ball felt like an epic. Mohammed Shami was swinging it around corners. Jasprit Bumrah was jagging the ball in both directions. With EnglandтАЩs hopes resting entirely on BairstowтАЩs partnership with Ben Stokes, Virat Kohli chose this moment to approach Bairstow and offer a few handy pointers. Bairstow is playing some of the best cricket of his career. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images We heard this song quite a lot last summer and normally it ended only one way. But here something strange happened. Bairstow sent Kohli back to slip with a condescending tap on the shoulder, returned to his crease and set about flaying IndiaтАЩs attack to all parts. Before his altercation with Kohli he was on 13 from 61 balls. After it he made 93 from 79 balls. Far from grinding England into the dirt, India had somehow managed to bring them to life. The next couple of hours were glorious. The shots were audacious, sadistic and yet executed with a clean, cold control: the cut through point, the shovel through midwicket, the lofted drive simply eased over extra cover as if he were wedging the lid off a beer bottle. But there was something else as well and we first glimpsed it on Saturday evening, when Bairstow alone looked equipped to resist IndiaтАЩs formidable pace attack. This is a transformation that predates the Stokes era and is perhaps the most striking point of difference between Bairstow and his captain: while Stokes these days comes out swinging from ball one , Bairstow has the confidence and assurance to play himself in, to get a feel for the game. Almost alone among EnglandтАЩs batters he has learned the value of positive defence: the judicious leave, the assertive block, the push for no runs that still somehow manages to convey a message of intent. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Of course, Stokes, too, has that club in his bag: after all, his greatest ever innings at Headingley in 2019 began with a rearguard of two from 66 balls. But whether for reasons of tone, tactics or boredom, Stokes has ceased bothering with all that. In a way it was somehow fitting when Bumrah got one to nip in off a length and hit Stokes painfully in the same part of the body with which he seems to do most of his thinking these days. It feels faintly ridiculous that a player with 87 Test caps has spent most of that time feeling somehow inessential: a spare part shunted up and down the order, a man constantly on the edge of things. Partly, one senses this is simply BairstowтАЩs character: a natural introversion that occasionally manifests itself as aloofness, an insecurity that is too often mistaken for a chip on the shoulder. But England are finally discovering what Bairstow can do with a little love and little licence. As he reached his century and raised his bat to the heavens, the Edgbaston crowd and England balcony rose to acclaim a player who тАУ a decade into his Test career тАУ finally feels as if he belongs.","pubDate":"2022-07-03 19:14:27","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8cbdbb998d1ffe2fcfed5fd5d3219e20b178022/252_77_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de9fefb685784a8939ec19e3d4a682bd","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Jonny Bairstow continues astonishing form with another century but England struggle and India on top in Fifth Test","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19078435/jonny-bairstow-england-india-fifth-test/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["John Etheridge"],"video_url":null,"description":"JONNY BAIRSTOW played his fourth extraordinary innings on the trot and continues to make the remarkable and historic look routine.

No England batsman has ever produced such savagery and fast-scoring across three back-to-back Test matches. BairstowтАЩs ledger at Trent Bridge, Headingley and now Edgbaston is a mind-boggling 475 runs from just 434 balls. His four innings are worth recounting individually - 136 from 93 balls, 162 from 157 balls, 71 not out from 44 balls and 106 from 140 balls. These are almost unbelievable numbers, a collection of consecutive demolition jobs unmatched by anyone in Test cricket. Bairstow has brought Twenty20 to Test matches and it is absolutely brilliant. He has been the big beneficiary of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullumтАЩs so-called \"Bazball\" aggressive approach. In fact, Bairstow is the main exponent of Bazball and is also taking an enhanced role in the on-field brains trust. And yet, despite BairstowтАЩs innings on day three of the Fifth Test, England are on course to lose to India and surrender the series 3-1 (remember, they are 2-1 down from last summer). By the close, India were 125-3 building on a first innings lead of 132 and in a position to set England a target that even Bairstow and Co might struggle to overcome. They would be even further ahead but for a funereal over-rate. A total of 15 overs were lost as the public continue to be fleeced by slow play or, as on Saturday, a shameful reluctance to start sooner after rain delays. In the morning, Bairstow took his time to become settled but, once he decided to press the accelerator, he advanced from 16 to his century in just 54 deliveries. JOIN SUN VEGAS: GET A FREE ┬г10 BONUS WITH 100s OF GAMES TO PLAY AND NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED (Ts&Cs apply) He lofted fast bowlers back over their heads for one-bounce fours, hooked for six and once deposited quick bowler Shardul Thakur into the crowd over the long mid-wicket boundary with a contemptuous clout. A spat with Virat Kohli seemed to fire him up. Stumps mics picked up Bairstow telling Kohli at slip to shut up тАУ with an expletive, of course тАУ after Kohli used fruity language to express exasperation at a play and miss. The umpires were forced to intervene and there were a few tense moments. But it ended with Kohli patting Bairstow on the arm in an apparently conciliatory fashion although the former Indian captain did blow him a kiss when he was out. Bairstow insisted the incident was nothing тАУ just two тАЬpassionateтАЭ cricketers trying to do the best for their countries. Stokes is trying to be ultra-aggressive and set the tone with the bat this summer but at times he has lurched towards slogging. Bairstow, by contrast, has been selective in the balls he tries to hit and clinical in his execution. Stokes offered two chances before he departed for 25. First, a skier that Thakur spilled at mid-wicket and then a drive to mid-off that Jasprit Bumrah fumbled. But, next ball, Bumrah held a much more difficult chance leaping to his left at mid-off. Bairstow was given out lbw on 89 but he called immediately for a replay, which showed an edge. His fifth Test century of 2022 arrived with a boundary courtesy of a misfield by the normally safe Ravi Jadeja. It occupied 119 balls тАУ not bad considering he was 16 from 65 deliveries. Bairstow was eventually caught at slip, Stuart Broad skied an attempted slog, Sam Billings dragged on and Matthew Potts edged into the slips. When India batted again, Jimmy Anderson immediately had Shubman Gill caught at second slip for the second time in the match. Hanuma Vihari edged an attempted drive to third slip and then Kohli edged a Stokes snorter and, although wicketkeeper Billings dropped the original chance, Joe Root at first slip caught the rebound. Kohli has not scored an international century in any format since November 2019. Towards the end, England were reduced to negative tactics with Root aiming his spinners way outside off stump and Anderson sending down bouncers from round the wicket. Not much sign of тАШBazballтАЩ there. Cheteshwar Pujara reached his half-century just before the close and Rishabh Pant, who scored a brilliant century in IndiaтАЩs first innings, will resume 30 not out on Monday morning with licence to seek quick runs.","pubDate":"2022-07-03 18:57:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"How many centuries of Virat Kohli: Virat Kohli total international centuries full list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-how-many-centuries-of-virat-kohli-virat-kohli-total-international-centuries-full-list/","keywords":["Cricket","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"How many centuries of Virat Kohli: Former India skipper headed back towards the dressing room after yet another failure with the bat in Tests.

During the third day of the fifth rescheduled Test match between England and India at the Edgbaston Cricket Stadium in Birmingham, former team India skipper Virat Kohli (20 off 40 deliveries) failed to convert his start to the innings yet again, to continue struggling with his poor run of form for quite some time now. KohliтАЩs brief stay at the crease commenced with some exquisite shots through the off-side with him looking comfortable and confident, and willing to play the majority of deliveries rather than leaving the ones outside the off-stump. However, it just took one delivery from Ben Stokes which led to an uneven bounce off the deck with the ball landing around the good length spot. Kohli, who went forward to defend the ball, was caught by surprise as the ball rose on him off the deck only for his ill-fate to let it brush his glove through to the wicket-keeper Sam Billings. If that wasnтАЩt it, Billings even dropped the catch, but the ball ricocheted off a part of his gloves and landed straight into Joe RootтАЩs right hand. The above development meant that the fansтАЩ arduous wait for KohliтАЩs 71st international century will have to wait for yet another day, with the 70th one coming way back in November 2019. The 33-year-old has smashed a total of 27 Test centuries (across 171 innings) and 43 ODI centuries (across 251 innings) in his legendary international career so far.","pubDate":"2022-07-03 18:48:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England vs India 5th Test, Day 3: Cheteshwar Pujara Fifty Puts India In Commanding Position - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9lbmdsYW5kLXZzLWluZGlhLTIwMjIvZW5nLXZzLWluZC01dGgtdGVzdC1kYXktMy1jaGV0ZXNod2FyLXB1amFyYS1maWZ0eS1wdXRzLWluZGlhLWluLWNvbW1hbmRpbmctcG9zaXRpb24tMzEyNDUyONIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England vs India 5th Test, Day 3: Cheteshwar Pujara Fifty Puts India In Commanding Position┬а┬аNDTV SportsIndia vs England 5th Test highlights, Day 3: India 125/3 at stumps, lead by 257 runs at Edgbaston┬а┬аTimes of IndiaWest Indies great Lara congratulates Bumrah after Indian breaks his Test record┬а┬аGulf NewsWatch: Drops A Sitter And Then Takes A Screamer - The Jasprit Bumrah-Ben Stokes Story┬а┬аNDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - England vs India, 5th Test, Day 3 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz┬а┬аCricbuzzView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-03 18:31:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pujara last 20 Test innings: Pujara last century in Test cricket date and opposition","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-pujara-last-20-test-innings-pujara-last-century-in-test-cricket-date-and-opposition/","keywords":["Cricket","Cheteshwar Pujara","England","India","India tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Cheteshwar Pujara last 20 Test innings: The Indian batter scored a hardworking half-century at Edgbaston today.

India batter Cheteshwar Pujara has celebrated his Test comeback with a hardworking half-century coming in a manner which he is fondly known among his fans. Opening the batting for the ninth time in Test cricket, Pujara hadnтАЩt even faced a ball when opening partner Shubman Gill (4) was dismissed in the first over itself by veteran England pacer James Anderson. Not affected by the same, Pujara remained unbeaten to guide India to 125/3 in 45 overs at Stumps, Day 3. Known for qualities like grit and determination, Pujara once again portrayed as to why his resolute intentions arenтАЩt easy to breach. Not taking risks like the best batters in this match, PujaraтАЩs orthodox approach saw him scoring 50* (139) with the help of five fours today. It wasnтАЩt until the last over of the day that Pujara stepped out to hit a Joe Root delivery on the leg-side to run a single and complete a well-deserved half-century. In what is his 33rd Test half-century, it is his 14th away from home, seventh against England, fifth in England, third as an opener and second in 2022.

Pujara, who hasnтАЩt scored a Test century for over three years now, would be eyeing one tomorrow. As far as PujaraтАЩs last Test century is concerned, it had come during 2019тАЩs New YearтАЩs Test against Australia when the right-hand batter had scored a match-winning 193 (373) in Sydney. Since the final match of ICC World Test Championship 2021 against New Zealand last year, Pujara has batted in 20 Test innings scoring 509 runs at an average of 28.27 including four half-centuries. Numbers which one doesnтАЩt associate with Pujara, the 34-year old batter has started in an affirmative note after being dropped from the squad for a home Test series against Sri Lanka.","pubDate":"2022-07-03 18:25:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli 'FINISHED': Twitter goes blazing as Virat departs cheaply in IND vs ENG 5th Test","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/virat-kohli-finished-twitter-goes-blazing-as-virat-departs-cheaply-in-ind-vs-eng-5th-test-2481179.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"A mixed reaction Twitter on Kohli's form trended on Twitter with half the fans opining that the right-hander should be sent back to play domestic cricket while the other half of world were supporting the talismanic batter justifying that he the unluckiest batter in the world at the moment.","content":"Virat Kohli was dismissed on 20 off 40 balls by Ben Stokes in the second innings of the fifth Test between India and England on Sunday (July 3) at Birmingham.

Kohli had something to say and Bairstow too did not hold back. After this round of sledging took place, Bairstow played 52 balls and smashed 78 runs. Before the spat with Kohli, he was on 13 off 61 balls. When the rain interrupted the first session before early lunch was called, Bairstow had scored 91 off 113 balls that included 12 fours and 2 sixes. Clearly, the Kohli sledge had an effect on Bairstow. Coming back to Virat Kohli, in the first innings he got out because he was caught in two minds of whether to leave the ball or play it. The Matthew Potts delivery nipped back into the right-hander's bat while he was leaving it and knocked over his stumps. Similarly, in the second innings, at a wicket (pitch) which is keeping the ball low, Kohli was dismissed with an extra bounce that Stokes got and shocked the right-hander who looked back at Sam Billings right after the ball kissed his gloves and travelled back to him. Billings somehow spilled the catch but Joe Root was standing right next to him who caught it right at that moment.","pubDate":"2022-07-03

Indian cricket team is touring England and playing cricket series. Both teams are currently playing a Test match at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground. In the first innings, India scored 416 runs and England scored 284 runs. India started the second innings with a lead of 132 runs. Former India captain Virat Kohli engaged in a heated war of words (sledging) with Bairstow when the England team batted in the first innings of this match. The New Zealand teammate seems to have drawn Bairstow into a frenzy by comparing the bowling of Saudi. He also told me to keep batting quietly. That moment was a game-changer. At that time Bairstow had scored just 13 runs off 61 balls. After that he scored 93 runs off 79 balls. In the end it was Kohli who caught Bairstow and dismissed him. In this case, Sehwag has criticized it now. тАЬKoli before sledged Bairstow his strike rate was just 21. But after that his strike rate was 150. Virat Kohli sledged Bairstow who was playing like Pujara unnecessarily and turned him into Rishabh Pant,тАЭ Sehwag tweeted. In the second innings, Kohli scored 20 runs off 40 balls and was bowled by Stokes.

During the third day of the fifth rescheduled Test match between England and India at the Edgbaston Cricket Stadium in Birmingham, the Indian bowling attack has bundled up the in-form English batting order for 284, to gain a 132-run lead in their second innings. Mohammed Siraj was the pick of the Indian bowlers, bagging a four-fer, including the prized wicket of former England skipper Joe Root (31). The initial dent however, was made by skipper Jasprit Bumrah, who got rid of the top-3 English batters with the new ball. The lone silver lining in the English batting line-up was their wicket-keeper batter Jonny Bairstow, who delivered with the bat yet again to smash his third consecutive Test century тАУ 106 off 140 deliveries, to bail England out of deep trouble. 8.96% of Jonny BairstowтАЩs all Test runs have come in last 20 days only. He has 5301 runs in a 10 years long career. #EngvInd тАФ Mazher Arshad (@MazherArshad) July 3, 2022 With the weather forecast for Day 4 (tomorrow) exuding optimism, a lip-smacking contest is in store for the fans, with England likely to approach the тАШBaz BallтАЩ way. Edgbaston pronunciation While team India have not found a clue to win a Test match at the Edgbaston Cricket Stadium as yet, a significant section of the Indian fans in particular, are also devoid of a clue to come up with the correct pronunciation of the word тАШEdgbastonтАЩ. The query is whether the letter тАШgтАЩ in the word is to pronounced akin an тАШeggтАЩ or like the one in тАШgenderтАЩ. To break the correct pronunciation down, the word тАШEdgbastonтАЩ goes like тАШedge-bas-tonтАЩ, with the тАШgтАЩ to be uttered like the one in тАШgenderтАЩ as mentioned above. With India in a wonderful position to win their maiden Test match at Edgbaston, hope the ones unaware would also come up with the correct pronunciation of this Cricket Stadium by the time India wins.
