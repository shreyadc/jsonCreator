only to bury home her second attempt, to loud boos from the crowd.Rosie Malone of the Hockeyroos stepped up for the first spot hit but after fluffing her lines and missing the umpire called for a retake stating that the shot clock had not started.While it was by the rules the decision was wildly contentious with former international Georgie Parker describing the decision as “amateur and unfortunate.”The crowd turned on the officials with boos ringing out.“That would be a national outrage if that happened to Australia,” - Alastair Nichoson said on Channel 7.The shootout continued with Australia’s goalkeeper Jocelyn Bartram the hero saving all three of India’s efforts to put the Hockeyroos into the gold medal match.Coach Katrina Powell’s side were forced into a re-shuffle following a scary facial injury to key defender Karri Somerville just seven minutes into the match.Somerville was felled by an errant high-ball which struck near her right eye – requiring immediate attention, and several staff members to stem the blood pouring down her face.The 23-year-old, who become an incredibly valued member of an Australian defence went 289 minutes without conceding a goal this week, is now in severe doubt to take her place in Sunday’s gold medal match.Fellow defender Penny Squibb (calf) was also unavailable for the semi-final, but is expected to play on Sunday.Australia went ahead after 10 minutes when Rebecca Greiner tapped home with a classy touch to deflect a blazing cross from Mariah Williams – who chose the perfect time to score her first goal of the tournament.As they’ve done throughout the tournament, Australia got into the grind, dominated possession and relied on their watertight defence – but struggled to come up with the end product despite creating a wealth of chances.It’s the hallmark of a team that is talented, but still developing and it came back to bite them as India levelled the scores through Vandana Katariya to force a penalty shootout.“It’s amateur and unfortunate,” said former Hockeyroo Georgie Parker.After having her first penalty saved, Malone was controversially given a second chance – due to a malfunctioning countdown on the big screen – and duly delivered.Captain Kaitlin Nobbs and Amy Lawton followed with cool finishes, while replacement keeper Jocelyn Bartram was rock solid in goal.Australia will face hosts England, after they played out a similarly tense semi-final win over New Zealand, with the hosts prevailing in a gut-wrenching penalty shootout after 60 minutes of scoreless hockey.England’s Isabelle Petter and Hannah Martin scored in the shootout, while goalkeeper Maddie Hinch was the star of the show making four saves to blank New Zealand and send the crowd at the University of Birmingham into a state of delirium.Metros Comm Games MTkicker1 ‘HISTORY FOR AUSTRALIADaniel Golubovic and Cedric Dubler have ended a century long wait for Australia but the feat did not come without a heartbreaking finish. Going into the final round of the decathlon, Golubovic knew he needed to finish the 1500m at least 23 seconds ahead of Lindon Victor and goodness did he give it a red hot crack.When the Aussie crossed the line he looked to have secured himself gold with the Granadian athlete struggling down the home straight.A painstaking wait ensued with Victor eventually crowned the decathlon champion by just 36 points having crossed the line 21 seconds behind Golubovic.It was an incredible result for both Aussie. Golubovic taking silver and Dubler the bronze.“Thank you, I had to dig for that,” Golubovic said afterwards. “It is cold out here and there is nothing in the works. Two decathlon in 12 days - I don’t recommend it.“It’s been an incredible experience, coming down and moving back to Australia and back to Brisbane during COVID, it’s been a wild few years and it’s been a long process to get here. It feels so good to be on this stage right now.”The result marks the first time in a century that Australia has had two medals in decathlon.AUSSIE INTO THE FINALAustralian sprinter Ella Connolly has qualified for the final for the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 200m.“I’m so pumped. It is crazy. It feels good,’’ she told trackside reporters.“I feel like I executed a good race. Commonwealth Games is championship racing, I needed to get top two to make the final and I am now looking forward to it.”Connolly, 22, from, Burpengary, earned an automatic spot with a lunge at the finish to beat Indian champion Hima Das by a miniscule 100th of a second in the second semifinal.Connolly, who clocked 23.41s was behind the pace set by the winner Nambian Christine Mboma, who came through off the bend to post 22.93s. The first two automatically advanced to the final.Another Queensland sprinter Jacinta Beecher clocked 23.40s in the first semifinal, but she finished in fourth spot and had to hope she was one of the fastest losers. In the end, even though she was slightly faster than Connolly, Beecher was 12 hundredths of a second off being promoted through to the final.This was because the third semifinal was won by the hot favourite Eaine Thompson-Herah in a slick time of 22.63s, dragging the rest of the field through in quick times.Thompson-Herah is the fastest qualifier, just ahead of Nigerian Favour Ofili who clocked 22.66s.Connolly said her tactics for the final are simple: “I need to get out to a good start again and hold my form in the last 100m and just stay relaxed.’’Six gold medals, a silver and a bronze. Australia’s most successful Olympian has become the most prolific Commonwealth athlete. So why her ongoing battle with the mental toll of greatness? She opens up to Will Swanton.Waiting for her final presentation ceremony, she sits on the concrete floor in a back corner of the Sandwell Aquatics Centre. Her back is to the wall and she’s knackered. She takes her final bow, sings a song, and comes over for a chat in the grandstand of the arena she’s held in the palm of her hand.She’s talking about the power of a good and proper cry. “That’s helped me,” she says, after completing a gruelling program compounded by a spotlight on her private life.“It was obviously a pretty tough week. There were lots of good parts to it. Obviously sharing it with (partner) Cody (Simpson) and having both my parents in the stands every time I raced. That was special because they couldn’t be in Tokyo.“There were so many amazing parts of the week but yes, there were tough parts as well. I’ll say it’s been a rollercoaster of emotions.”She adds: “You try to stay stable through the course of a week as big as this one, but the emotions can build up and I do let them out.“You can’t try to be a robot. I’m not a robot. You try to keep yourself together as much as you can, but yeah, there’s times when I just let it all go and have a decent cry.”READ THE FULL EXCLUSIVE HERE5:50AM ‘YOU WILL REGRET IT’: STARS SLAMMED FOR GAMES SNUBBirmingham 2022 boss Ian Reid has slammed stars who opted to skip the Commonwealth Games and insisted they will regret failing to compete at the event. Several big names opted to miss the Games, including sprint world champions Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson. Many stars cited the fact that the event in Birmingham was held so close to the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon as the reason they skipped, with Fraser-Pryce actually in attendance. Other world champions from the recent meeting in the United States that have elected to be absent from the Commonwealth Games include women’s 400m winner Shanae Miller-Uibo and Faith Kipyegon. Regardless, Reid remained defiant in the face of absent stars and declared they will regret their choice. He said: “We can’t make people come here but, if Shelly-Ann was here earlier and saw the atmosphere and the full stadium, she probably regrets it. “To have 30,000 people in Alexander Stadium for every session of athletics, the atmosphere it’s created, I can’t think of anywhere better for these athletes to be. There are some others who aren’t here but my personal opinion is they will probably regret it.” Reid’s sentiment was shared by three-time Commonwealth Games champion Daley Thompson. The Englishman won decathlon gold at the Olympics in 1980 and 1984, but won his Commonwealth titles between 1978 and 1986. 5:30AM MEDAL WITH TORN ACLAustralian wrestler Jayden Lawrence fought with a torn ACL to claim his first Commonwealth Games medal in one of the most heroic efforts of Birmingham 2022.The 27-year-old, from New South Wales, tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a bout with Pakistan’s Muhammad Inam, yet fought on in search of a breakthrough medal at his third Commonwealth Games.Competing in the men’s freestyle 86kg, Lawrence defeated South Africa’s Edward Lessing 12-11 in the bronze medal match, a result he said had been a “long time coming”.“I got the medal. It is third time lucky and it’s been a long time coming. I’ve been training really, really hard for this, given up a lot. I’m so happy,” he told Channel 7.But the real bombshell was yet to come when he revealed he was hobbled by an injury which sidelines most athletes for close to 12 months.“In the Pakistan match I got a bit injured, tore my ACL,” he cooly said. “The last two fights, wrestles sorry, battled it out.”Lawrence revealed the extent of his pain, saying he would struggle to walk five minutes after being interviewed.But asked whether he was worth it, Lawrence was in no doubt.“Bloody oath,” he said. By Erin SmithOne is a rookie, the other a veteran of the sport but that didn’t stop Aussie duo Dom Bedggood and Cassiel Rousseau soaring in the men’s synchronised 10m platform event to finish in third place. Just 1.29 points off second Canada’s Rylan Weins and Nathan Zsombor-Murray. The pair only formed earlier this year - impressing at Worlds, their first major competition, finishing seventh. Bedggood is a multi Commonwealth Games medal winner and both have among the few Aussie men to make finals in the individual 10m platform event at the Olympics. They eased into their event in Birmingham, starting with some lower difficulty rated dives before pulling out a host for tricks for their remaining four dives. At the halfway point the pair were sitting in third place and after their fourth dive were just 14.43 points off first. With the competition including Olympians and world silver medal winners England’s Matthew Lee and Noah Williams, who went on to claim gold tonight, it was always going to be a tough night off the platform. They nailed their fifth dive, their most difficult, a forward four and a half somersaults tuck to collect 84.36 points from the judges. With one dive to go the boys were sitting in third, just 13 points behind Lee and Williams. 5:01AM HOMETOWN HEROBy Jacquelin MagnayHome town hero Zharnel Hughes blasted his way into the 200m final with an impressive semifinal triumph, clocking a comfortable looking qualifying time of 21.32s in blustery conditions at the Alexander Stadium.Hughes believed he had won the Gold Coast Commonwealth 200m title four years ago but he was ruled out for impeding the athlete in the adjoining lane on the blocks. It turned out that decision was incorrect, and he has had the Birmingham title in his sights ever since.Trinidad and Tobago runner Jereem Richards also looked easy in the nexct semifinal, posting a time of 20.40, while Ghana’s Joseph Amoah, in the same heat, was pulled through in 20.51 as the third fastest. A year ago Brittany O’Brien was in tears unable to dive off the 10m platform anymore - she was ready to throw in the shammy for good.It was a suggestion from her coach that convinced her to try springboard for the first time - now she is returning from Birmingham with a silver medal around her neck. “It was a mental thing, I was having trouble getting my dives off the platform, I would just stand there and sort of cry. After having so much time off after Covid-19 lockdowns I just struggled to get back into it,” O’Brien, 24, said. “I was never really good at (springboard) in the beginning which was why I never did it. I’ve had to work really hard to get it.”O’Brien had a shaky start in the preliminary round but had the rest of the field on notice after her first few dives. She showed everyone what she could do in her fourth dive -a reverse two-and-a-half- somersault in tuck, to earn 63 points - her highest in the competition. A result that shocked even her.“That is one of my newer dives and I’ve never really hit it in a competition before so it felt really good to actually put it down tonight,” O’Brien said. A medal was all but guaranteed if she executed her fifth dive. “I was so nervous, I was shaking,” O’Brien said. “But once I went through the water I was pretty confident with my performance.”And she was right to be - the dive scored 56.25 - her second highest of the night and secured her second spot on the leaderboard. Canada’s Mia Vallee finished 12.25 points ahead to claim gold. The bronze medal went to England’s Amy Rollingson.O’Brien’s synchro partner Esther Qin, who claimed bronze in the 1m springboard at the Gold Coast, was unlucky to miss a spot on the podium.Qin had put on a solid performance during the night but came unstuck on her final dive, dropping from third to sixth. Georgia Sheehan, who won silver in this event at the Gold Coast, claimed seventh. By Eliza BarrOne of Australia’s brightest rhythmic gymnastics prospects has claimed bronze at the Commonwealth Games in a tightly contested all-around final.Alexandra Kiroi-Bogatyreva was outclassed Brit Marfa Ekimova and Cyprus champion Anna Sokolova.“It was an extremely exhausting day, not only physically but mentally, and the nerves got the better of us,” Kiroi-Bogatyreva said.“I came home with bronze and I’m happy with that.”“There were a few mistakes today, but I did clean and steady routines, the judges were happy and the coaches were happy,” Kiroi-Bogatyreva said.“As rhythmic gymnasts we’re known as perfectionists, I could give you a whole lot of things - some were shaky, some were better than the first time, but I wasn’t hoping for anything except to control my nerves and do clean, steady routines.”The 20-year old law student from Monash University in Melbourne came in as one to watch, as the Australian all-around champion.By Simeon Thomas-WilsonAustralia’s 12-year medal drought in wrestling at the Commonwealth Games has ended after Jayden Lawrence took bronze by the narrowest of margins. Australian wrestlers had not won a medal at a Commonwealth Games since Delhi in 2010, but this has changed after Lawrence pipped South African Edward Lessing in a thrilling 86kg men’s freestyle match.After bursting out of the blocks and racing to a 12-6 lead, Lawrence was pegged back by the South African who won five straight points.Both wrestlers gave all they had to try and get to 10 points clear but with the seconds ticking down it became a survival mission for Lawrence.He was just one point up with 30 seconds to go and despite Lessing throwing all he could at him Lawrence’s defence was too good as he broke Australia’s medal drought. TV RATINGS: COMM GAMES MIND BLOWING NUMBERSAustralians can’t get enough of the Commonwealth Games, with millions tuning in across the nation on television and online to watch the multi-sport event. Thanks to the time difference, Australia’s best athletes are sometimes competing in the middle of the night Australian time, but that has not deterred more than 9.9 million Australians tuning into the Channel 7’s Birmingham 2022 broadcast on TV. Seven West Media chief revenue officer Kurt Burnette said the network’s Games coverage had captivated Australians in exceptional numbers. “Our exclusive, live and free coverage of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games delivered incredible and magical moments and hours of engaging entertainment for millions of Australians,” Mr Burnette said. “(Television commercial agency) Total TV (is) showing the Games dominated viewing every day and night.”More than 1.77 million have also caught the Games online on 7Plus, where video on demand engagement is up 165 per cent from the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and live streaming up 86 per cent. Seven West Media chief digital officer Gereurd Roberts said 7Plus was soaring to new heights in 2022, with the Games smashing streaming records. 1:30AM ANOTHER MEDAL TO COMEAustralia is guaranteed another medal in lawn bowls at the Commonwealth Games after a stunning comeback win over Malaysia in the women’s pairs in Birmingham overnight.Skip Ellen Ryan - who won gold in the women’s singles - teamed up with her great friend and lead Kristina Krstic to beat the defending champions Sita Zalina and Emma Saroji 13-10.Gold medallists at the Gold Coast in 2018, the south east Asian dream pairing led 6-1 after the first ends before the Aussies caught fire and clinched a close victory at Royal Leamington Spa near Birmingham.“I was more nervous that game than I have been in my singles,” Ryan said.“It’s amazing and I can’t wait to stand on the podium with Krissie.“I just really wanted to do well for her because we got into the same Jackaroos’ team together and that’s where our friendship started.”11:35PM AGE IS BUT A NUMBERIt’s never too late to get to the Commonwealth Games, just look at George Miller who, at the ripe old age of 75 has just become the Commonwealth Games’s oldest ever gold medallist.Miller is the director for visually-impaired bowler Melanie Inness. Scotland beat Wales 16-9.11:00PM ‘NOT LEGAL’: JENNEKE DENIED RECORD IN HURDLES BLITZThe Michelle Jenneke revival continues with the Aussie through to the final and a genuine medal contender after clocking a personal record time - but it won’t count.Jenneke ran a personal best time of 12.63, three-hundredths of a second faster than she ran in the semi finals at the World Championships but due to the wind the time won’t be recorded as legal.But it was not enough to finish first with new world record holder and world champion Tobi Amusan dominating the heat to win in Games record 12.40.It was a relaxed looking Jenneke who performed a toned-down version of her signature “jiggle’ ahead of the race.Fellow Aussie Celeste Mucci also qualified for Sunday’s final, scraping in with the eighth fastest time of 12.96 seconds.“It doesn’t count as a legal time but, that’s the fastest I’ve ever covered a 100m over hurdles so really stoked,” she said afterwards.“I’m in the shape of my life. Clearly. It’s just really exciting. I still feel I’ve got a little more in the tank so we’ll see in a couple of days.“I feel I run best when I am happy and relaxed. Just soaking it all up. I’m not someone who likes to be super focussed on what I do. Even in the call room I am chatting with the officials. That’s what I do.”Amusan of Nigeria broke the women’s world record in the 100m hurdles in Oregon and a debate erupted around the shoe she wore.While not wearing the controversial shoe herself, Jenneke gave her opinion ahead of her competition in Birmingham.“I ran quite a PB in that race and ran in the same shoes that I have been running in for the last five years,” Jenneke said.“I know I can’t attribute my PB to the shoes because it’s the same shoe, the same model of shoe.“I have tried some of the newer spikes that they have coming out, the technology is amazing, and I’m sure people are faster but at the same time if you go back 10, 20 years, look at the shoes people were wearing, they were entirely different to what we were wearing five years ago. The technology is forever evolving.By Joe BartonAustralia and Sri Lanka are more familiar doing battle on the cricket pitch, and with four giants bordering on 200cm taking to the sand, you felt like each of them could do a job if given the new ball at a Gabba Test.But beach volleyball is the sport which has taken their hearts and, for the second Games in a row, Australia’s men are through to the medal matches after surviving a scare against Sri Lanka to reach Saturday’s semi-final.After conceding the first set, the pairing of Chris McHugh and Paul Burnett prevailed 16-21 21-16 15-9 to set up a semi-final with Rwanda.Australia, surprisingly, dropped the first set 21-16 against their unfancied rivals – who only scraped into the quarter-finals as one of two third-place finishers.In blustery conditions at the Smithfield arena in Birmingham, the defending champions appeared to struggle with the wind as their serves didn’t have their regular sting.It was the Aussie pair’s first dropped set of the whole Commonwealth Games, and they responded as you’d expect of the top seeded team.With the experienced McHugh cranking up his lethal right hand to fire some unreturnable winners, Australia led from the first change of ends and never looked back to take it 21-16 and force a deciding set.The final set is a race to 15 points, and Australia jumped out of the blocks beautifully to lead 8-4 and have the semi-final result within reach.A controversial video referee call to overturn an Australian point – that would’ve extended their lead to 12-8 – momentarily halted the charge, but they closed out the win just inside an hour.9:30PM AUSSIE THROUGH TO FINALReigning Commonwealth Games silver medalist and Australian record holder Brooke Buschkuehl has easily qualified for Sunday’s final in the long jump.Buschkuehl leapt 6.84m, only one centimetre behind Ghana’s Deborah Acquah, who delivered the biggest leap of the qualifying round.Buschkuehl broke the Australian record last month with a jump of 7.05 metres and is in career-best form. In the women’s 1500m Australia’s three female star middle distance runners, Jessica Hull, Abbey Caldwell and Linden Hall are all through to Sunday’s final.Australia’s chances of sweeping the road cycling golds at the Commonwealth Games has suffered a huge blow with Caleb Ewan withdrawing from the road race. Ewan, described as the “fastest man in the world” by teammates such as Luke Plapp, underwent surgery last Monday to remove a surgical plate from his collarbone - which was inserted after he crashed at the 2021 Tour de France. AusCycling had hoped that Ewan would be able to compete despite the surgery.But unsurprisingly on Friday they announced that the star sprinter would not start the road race in Warwick after it was “apparent” he was unable to race. “I’m devastated that I won’t be able to represent Australia in the green and gold this weekend, but after talking with my doctors it’s clear that I need to make the difficult decision to prioritise my health,” Ewan said. “I’ll be watching the race on television and hoping the team can get the job done for Australia.” It is a huge blow for Australia with Ewan widely expected to fight out with the Isle of Man superstar Mark Cavendish over the 160km flat course. Australia’s second best chance, young gun Kaden Groves, pulled out of the race a couple of weeks ago because of pro team commitments. It means Rohan Dennis, who won the individual time trial, Luke Durbridge, Luke Plapp, Miles Scotson and Sam Fox will be tasked with continuing Australia’s dominance on the road after a clean sweep in the time trial. All three Aussie women’s 1m springboarders are through to this morning’s final after breezing through the preliminary round. Esther Qin, who won bronze in this event at the Gold Coast Games, had the third best result in the preliminary round, scoring 266.95. Georgia Sheehan, back in the green and gold after taking time out of the sport to deal with burnout and mental health issues, took out fourth spot.Brittany O’Brien, a former platform diver who switched to springboard to reduce the toll on her body, qualified through eighth. Sam Fricker and Shixin Li are up next in the men’s 3m springboard synchronised finals. SPRINT TEEN FREAK WE’LL BE TALKING ABOUT IN 2026While all eyes were on the track in Birmingham, Australia’s next Commonwealth Games star emerged more than 8000km away.Queenslander Calab Law ran third in the world under-20 athletics championships 200m final, clocking a time of 20.48.The 18-year-old, who was already considered one of the fastest teens Australia has ever produced, ran what was described as the “race of his life” in Cali, Colombia.He finished behind only Blessing Akawasi Afrifah (Israel) and Lesile Tebogo (Botswana), who both recorded times of 19.96 secs.That mark was a new championships record and would have beaten the Commonwealth Games record of 19.97 set by Frankie Fredericks in 1994.Law’s time set a new personal best and strengthened his claims as one of Australia’s top sprint prospects after reaching the semi-finals in the 200m of the recent World Athletics Championships.Law finished 21st in the world in the Eugene event. He has previously run in the 100m but withdrew to focus on the 200m. After setting a new PB in the semi-final, he told Athletics Australia: “I did what I wanted to do, and now I’m there. I was planning to run faster than that but the rain delay felt like three hours, I had a little nap until about 30-minutes to go. I’m just relaxed naturally, I don’t put too much pressure on myself because it takes too much energy.”The final was slower than the semi-final due to a headwind. FAMILY FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES DURING CYCLING CRASH Alex Smith, The SunThe family involved in the horror cycling crash at the Commonwealth Games feared for their lives.The shocking accident came in the men’s scratch race when England’s Matt Walls collided with other riders at high speed and flew over the barriers and into the crowd.Cycling fan Hugh Colvin was spectating alongside his two children — aged five and seven — and a few family friends, when Walls catapulted over the barrier.Colvin’s wife Laura was not at the velodrome but she described the terror: “What has been hard for us to get our head around is how close this came to being a complete catastrophe.“And how close our two younger children came to being seriously injured or killed. And that has been the main thing we’ve had to reflect on over the last few days.”Colvin himself said to the BBC: “It all happened so incredibly quickly at the speed the cyclists were going.“You can see the trajectory of the bike, it came through, grazed my daughter’s shoulder, and one of the photos you can see we are obviously underneath the wheel.“Looking back at the photos it must have been within centimetres, millimetres, of our heads.”Early reports from a Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said three riders went to hospital and two injured fans only required treatment by medics on site.However, one of the family friends did go to hospital, Mrs Colvin said: “He suffered a laceration to the bone which the hospital have described as being like a machete injury.“He’s still waiting for surgery. It is the start of a long road to recovery for him.”She also revealed that Walls video-called her children to help them come to terms with what happened.‘TWERKER’ STEALS SHOW ON COMM GAMES COVERAGE A rugby fan caught the BBC cameras by surprise by twerking as she was filmed in the crowd during the Commonwealth Games.The Rugby Sevens action was interrupted as one fan showed off her dancing — and her bum.Cameras picked up three women enjoying their day out in Coventry at the Commonwealth Games.But as the fan in the middle spotted herself on the big screen, she seized her moment with both hands.After taking a swig of her drink, the supporter stood up and turned her bum to the camera before starting to twerk.While her friends were left in hysterics by the X-rated performance, the BBC team was caught completely off guard.The stunned BBC commentator said there is “plenty of dancing” going on in the crowd, before the cameras quickly cut away and back to the match action.Updates to story","pubDate":"2022-08-05 22:36:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Victoria set to pave way for more nations to host Comm Games","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/how-the-2026-victorian-commonwealth-games-will-change-the-event-for-the-future/news-story/a1fc91c3ab863e76067da4e8a778d75f","keywords":["Commonwealth Games"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Victoria’s 2026 Commonwealth Games – which will see regional cities play host to major sporting events – is set to become a model for other countries in the future.","content":"Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive Katie Sadlier told the Herald Sun African nations were showing interest in a similar style Games, with events spread across towns and cities.“The games is a huge exercise if you do it on your own in one spot, so the evolution of having the Games in several Victorian hubs is something we are very excited and open minded about,” Ms Sadlier said.“Having Australia first off the ranks to run something that isn’t on one site is really exciting and I am confident they will do a fantastic job.’’Ms Sadlier said the Victorian plan involved economic renewal as well as developing sporting centres of excellence. Commonwealth Games Australia chief executive Craig Phillips said: “We see it as an opportunity to develop a model that is sustainable and that notion that a whole nation, say for example, New Zealand could host a Games across multiple cities and towns and potentially cross border hosting. “So I think for us the significance of Victoria 2026 is, if we can make it work, and it work well, then it broadens the number of nations that could host the Games.”Small Commonwealth countries are understood to be relying on a successful delivery of the Victorian 2026 Games to allow future Games bids from a coalition of Pacific or African countries.There is also a big push to provide more qualifying slots for competitors from smaller countries to be able to compete in Victoria.Victoria’s plan of hosting up to 21 sports across four regional hubs is a fresh template for the Games organisers and is designed to give confidence for small countries, and regions to bid for future Games.comm gamesMr Phillips said the concept was to have overarching Games branding, so the international television audience saw a ‘Victoria Games’. But within that there would be scope for the regional hubs to introduce their own “flavour”.“Working with the Ballarat community for example, in embracing it so that the athletes in boxing and track and field and whatever else, have the Ballarat experience as part of the broader Victorian experience. I think that’s a great way of engaging with the community,” he said.The Victorian government is set to embark on a $2.6b upgrade of various sports facilities across the four regional hubs of Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Gippsland to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games.It is expected about 4500 athletes will compete at Victoria 2026, and there will be support staff of about 2500 as part of the 72 nation delegations.Organisers are also in intense discussion with Australia’s football codes, including the Victorian Football League and the Formula One, to avoid clashes, as the Games will be held from March 17-29, 2026. School term dates in Victoria could also be adjusted so that schoolchildren can be part of the celebrations.Geelong will host Australia’s most successful sport, swimming, as well as diving, triathlon, table tennis, hockey, gymnastics and beach volleyball.Ballarat will see track and field and boxing, while Bendigo is to host cycling, lawn bowls, weightlifting, squash and netball.Gippsland is to host badminton, some cycling and Rugby Sevens.T20 cricket is to be played across all four hubs.Under the Victorian model, the Games will split into four regional hubs, essentially each having a small Games focus, with an overarching regional messaging. Athletes will be accommodated in athlete villages built in all four areas, with the Games’ building program helping to address the regions’ social and low cost housing shortages.Athletics, swimming, lawn bowls, triathlon, table tennis and powerlifting will also include para-sports competitions.The Victorian government, which expects a $3bn boost from hosting the Games, has sent an observer team, headed by Victoria 2026 chief executive Jeroen Weimar, and including a team of police and tourism officials, across to Birmingham to look at all aspects of the logistics and behind the scenes organisation.Mr Weimar, who led the Victorian government’s Covid-19 response, told the Commonwealth Games Federation members meeting in Birmingham that he expected an additional three or four sports being added to the Victoria program.The world cycling body UCI in conjunction with Cycling Australia officials have been lobbying to have track cycling included in the Games program by upgrading the Melbourne velodrome at Darebin. The success of having the track events last week in London, but still branding them as part of the Birmingham Games, has been viewed as important. Other sports such as shooting, surf lifesaving, dragon boat racing, archery, surfing, skateboarding, and e-games have made submissions to be considered for Victoria 2026. A final decision of the Games’ sports on the Victoria program is to be made by October this year.","pubDate":"2022-08-05 22:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Canadian men overwhelm Vanuatu to win cricket one-dayer by 204 runs","link":"https://www.burnabynow.com/national-sports/canadian-men-overwhelm-vanuatu-to-win-cricket-one-dayer-by-204-runs-5665149","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"KING CITY, Ont. — Nicholas Kirton scored 108 not out as Canada recovered from a slow start at bat to overwhelm Vanuatu and win by 204 runs in ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League A play Friday.","content":"KING CITY, Ont. — Nicholas Kirton scored 108 not out as Canada recovered from a slow start at bat to overwhelm Vanuatu and win by 204 runs in ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League A play Friday. Vanuatu won the toss and elected to field in a match shortened to 38 overs from the normal 50 after overnight rain. The Canadians finished at 246 for four. Vanuatu managed just 42 runs for nine wickets in response with Canadian spin bowler Rommel Shazad taking four wickets. The Canadians has a rough start, losing openers Rayyan Pathan for seven and Dhaliwal for 10. Matthew Spoors and Shreyas Movva followed, both exiting on four runs to leave Canada at 34 for four. Kirton, batting fourth, and No. 6 Salman Nazar steadied the ship. Nazar had to retire injured after scoring 55 runs to bring Canada to 188 for four. Ravinderpal Singh followed, slugging 42 runs off just 17 balls with two fours and four sixes. Kirton finished with seven fours and five sixes in his 95-ball knock. Vanuatu opener Joshua Rasu had a rocky start to his innings, taking a ball from fast bowler Jeremy Gordon on the helmet. His 10 runs led all Vanuatu batsmen. The six-team tournament, which runs through Sunday at the Maple Leaf Cricket Club, is part of the World Cup qualifying process. The Canadians were coming off wins over Denmark, Singapore, Malaysia and Qatar with captain Navneet Dhaliwal hitting a pair of centuries. The Challenge Leagues are a 2 1/2-year competition involving 12 teams considered three steps away from the 2023 World Cup. The King City event was originally slated to be held last August but was pushed back due to the pandemic. There are two Challenge Leagues, A and B, each comprising six teams that play 15 matches each over two years. Canada is in Group A while Group B is made up of Bermuda, Hong Kong, Italy, Jersey, Kenya and Uganda. Canada leads Group A at 9-1 with the lone loss by four runs to Singapore in Kuala Lumpur last September. It will play five more matches in the next league session later this year. Vanuatu dropped to 2-7. The top team in each league at the end of the competition will secure two of the six places in the Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier Playoff to be held later in 2022, alongside the bottom four of Men’s CWC League 2. The top two teams from the playoff continue in the hunt to participate in India 2023. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 5, 2022 The Canadian Press","pubDate":"2022-08-05 21:15:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"burnabynow","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CWG 2022, India vs Australia Women's Hockey Semifinal Highlights: Australia Edge Past India In Penalty Shootout - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NvbW1vbndlYWx0aC1nYW1lcy0yMDIyL2luZGlhLXZzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS13b21lbi1ob2NrZXktc2VtaWZpbmFsLWxpdmUtdXBkYXRlcy0zMjI4OTI20gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY29tbW9ud2VhbHRoLWdhbWVzLTIwMjIvaW5kaWEtdnMtYXVzdHJhbGlhLXdvbWVuLWhvY2tleS1zZW1pZmluYWwtbGl2ZS11cGRhdGVzLTMyMjg5MjYvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"CWG 2022, India vs Australia Women's Hockey Semifinal Highlights: Australia Edge Past India In Penalty Shootout  NDTV SportsCWG 2022 India vs Australia Women's Hockey Semi-final Highlights: IND Lose in Shootout  News18CWG 2022 India Day 8 complete schedule, time in IST: India vs Australia hockey semi-final, shuttlers, wrestlers in focus - Sports News , Firstpost  FirstpostLive Score India Women vs Australia Women Hockey Semi-final, Commonwealth Games 2022 Day 8: Valiant IND Go Do  Cricket Country NewsIndia vs Australia Highlights, CWG: AUS W edge past IND W in semi-final shootout  Hindustan TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-05 21:10:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Parnell bowls S.Africa to comfortable T20 win over Ireland","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/08/06/cricket-parnell-bowls-safrica-to-comfortable-t20-win-over-ireland","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"BRISTOL, England (Reuters) - South Africa seamer Wayne Parnell claimed career-best figures of 5-30 as they cruised to a 44-run victory over Ireland and completed a clean sweep of their two-match Twenty20 International series in Bristol on Friday.

South Africa were sent in to bat and recovered from a slow start to post 182 for six in their innings, before restricting Ireland to 138 all out in 18.5 overs. Left-armer Parnell had Ireland on the back foot in the second over of their chase as he bagged two wickets before returning to remove top scorer Harry Tector (34 from 31 balls), ending any hopes Ireland had of victory. South Africa found scoring difficult in the early part of their innings but finished with a flourish to post a challenging total. They scored 128 runs from their final 10 overs as Heinrich Klaasen plundered 39 from 16 deliveries and David Miller ended with 32 not out from 20 balls. Those two scores added to a more sedate 42 from 40 balls by innings top-scorer Reeza Hendricks, who was denied a fifth sucessive half-century in 20-over internationals. South Africa have now won 16 of their last 20 matches in the shortest format - some good form heading into the T20 World Cup in Australia that starts in October.

India are currently leading the five-match series 2-1 and nothing would be more satisfying than a couple of thumping wins in front of the USA’s Indian diaspora, which is anticipating an enjoyable weekend cricket carnival. However in this current India set-up, if there is one man whose performance will be monitored more than anyone else, it has got to be Iyer. Deepak Hooda, who has used most of the opportunities handed to him, looks good to outwit Iyer at the moment as far as the big ticket T20 World Cup berth is concerned. With KL Rahul and Virat Kohli all set to be back in the playing eleven for the Asia Cup, time is certainly running out for the 27-year-old Mumbaikar, who has had scores of 0, 10 (11 balls) and 24 (27 balls) in the three games so far in the ongoing series. He looked distinctly uncomfortable against the fast and rising deliveries. While the short ball is his main problem, watching Iyer gives a feeling that he is unable to decide at what pace and which gear would he bat in a T20 game, something that’s not the case when he is taking strike in 50-over format. In head coach Rahul Dravid’s regime so far, no player has got a raw deal in terms of chances and are given long enough rope to succeed. However in case of Iyer, his T20I game hasn’t exactly yielded the results that one has seen him deliver in the ODI cricket. Even then, Dravid has given Iyer nine T20I games in last two and half months, out of which, one in Bengaluru was a wash-out and there hasn’t been a single fifty-plus score even when he got chance to come out within first 10 overs. If Iyer gets a go in the last two games, he has no option but to put his best foot forward as the Asia Cup team, in all probability, will also be the likely team for the T20 World Cup. Even if Iyer makes the cut for Asia Cup or T20 World Cup, there is a miniscule chance of him getting a first XI look-in in a jam-packed top-order. Rohit likely to be available While Suryakumar Yadav’s awe-inspiring shots left all and sundry wide-eyed, he is expected to have his skipper Rohit Sharma for company at the top of the order. In the third game in Basseterre, Rohit was forced to retire hurt with a back spasm when he was batting on 11 and it was more like a precautionary measure with a three-day gap in between games. The Indian captain would like to continue his recent good form and positive intent in the two remaining games but at the same time would have the best seat to judge the form of some of his batters. Rishabh Pant has looked good in all his short stints at the crease and wouldn’t mind having a big one in front of a packed audience at Central Broward Park Stadium. Playing Avesh a compulsion in wake of Harshal’s injury Avesh Khan has been taken to cleaners in the last two games but Dravid-Rohit pair has no other option but to continue with the profligate MP speedster as Harshal Patel hasn’t fully recovered from his rib-cage injury. Avesh throughout his career has been a bit one-dimensional with either bowling too short or too full giving batters ample time to work on the pace or play the full-blooded drive. It will be interesting to see if Kuldeep Yadav gets a game in the series and India play an extra spinner in case Harshal doesn’t get fit in time.

So inspiring was Ennis-Hill’s performance that a 10-year-old Hodgkinson decided to start running again, having taken a few months off to focus on swimming. And almost a decade to the day later, the brilliant 800m star is primed to lead a fresh medal rush this weekend.

Commonwealth Games 2022: bowls gold for 75-year-old Miller on day eight – live! Read more Meanwhile, Commonwealth Games organisers have structured Sunday’s programme in such a way that it puts the focus on women’s team sport a week after the Lionesses’ stunning European Championship victory – with the women’s hockey, netball and cricket finals all being given pride of place. Inevitably they are dubbing the day Super Sunday too. But, as they also point out, it is part of a wider trend to push women’s sport. This year the Games will become the first major multisport event to award more medals to women than men - with 136 medal events for women and 134 for men. Many of them will be handed out over a weekend soaked in anticipation, expectation and high-class rivalries. Along the way England will also hope to narrow the gap to Australia at the top of the medal table to set up a thrilling denouement to the Games, which ends on Monday. And at the vanguard of the gold medal charge will be Hodgkinson, the fearless 20-year-old from Wigan, who recently added a brilliant world 800m silver to her Olympic silver in Tokyo. Last weekend, like millions of others, she watched her schoolfriend Ella Toone score the first goal in England’s 2-1 European Championship win over Germany last week. But now she wants to put her name deeper into the mainstream too. “It’s about seizing the opportunity,” she says – and that is something she has already done better than most in her burgeoning career. England’s Keely Hodgkinson leads the way in the 800m heats. Photograph: Isaac Parkin/PA However, she says it may have taken a different path if it was not for London 2012. “I used to swim a lot at the time,” she says. “I also did athletics for a bit, and then I actually quit. But then I came back after seeing Jess being the female star of the London Olympics. I thought she was absolutely amazing. Competing at a home Olympics definitely put a lot of pressure on her, and she managed to deliver something spectacular.” Hodgkinson has not met Ennis-Hill, but last year the pair exchanged messages in which she told her what an influence she had been. Like Ennis-Hill, she possesses a fearlessness that is nearly as breathtaking as her ascent to the top of her sport. Yet she admits it was not always the case. She remembers racing in the Greater Manchester championships when she was 12 or 13 and being so nervous she wanted to pull out. “I was like ‘Dad, I am not running,’” she says. “And he had to actually bribe me with a pair of shoes. But I ended up winning. That is where my athletics career was made. Now I feel I can handle any situation. “My dad has always been a big influence on me. And he always used to say, ‘If you believe something, you can go and do it’. So that’s always just been my thinking. I just give everything, back myself, and hope I come out on top.” The weekend excitement begins at 11am on Saturday when England’s women cricketers take on India in the T20 semi-finals at Edgbaston. They are heavy favourites after winning their group ahead of New Zealand, with victory likely to see them facing Australia in Sunday’s finals. The action skips to the track at 1.10pm as the world 1500m champion Wightman takes on a high-class field which includes Kenya’s Timothy Cheruyiot and his Scottish teammate Josh Kerr, the silver and bronze medallists at last year’s Olympics. Just over an hour later all eyes will be on the NEC Arena as England’s netballers take on Australia in a rematch of the 2018 final on the Gold Coast. It is likely to be close and dramatic but the England defender Jade Clarke believes a capacity home crowd could make the difference. “The lights are off, they’ve all got their torches on,” she says. “I just feel like they’re part of the team and it just gives us a boost every time we have a dip in play or the momentum goes against us.” Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

England’s men will also face Australia in the hockey at 8.15pm, although they will be underdogs against a side looking for their seventh straight title. Then the action switches back to the track, where Hodgkinson and Hughes will hope to win a second and third track gold of the day for England. Do not be surprised if the Hodgkinson’s 800m is one of the races of the championships given that the field not only includes the world 800m bronze medallist Mary Moraa of Kenya but Muir, who won world 1500m bronze in Eugene and the Jamaican Natoya Goule, who has run 1:57.90 this year and looked sensational in her heat. Inevitably the overall quality of these Games has been mixed, to put it mildly. But across the athletics track and cricket field, netball court and hockey pitch, there should be battles royale aplenty this weekend. Time to buckle up and enjoy the ride.","pubDate":"2022-08-05 17:00:05","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03dbf88c5ce58ce097ad21b020741cafd50f6b1/0_142_6451_3871/master/6451.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f55e8ce5c132fd7a35b65cd3461440f","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs West Indies 4th T20I Preview: Iyer, Hooda To Fight For Asia Cup Berth As India Eye Series W.. - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS93ZXN0LWluZGllcy12cy1pbmRpYS0yMDIyLzR0aC10MjBpLWl5ZXItaG9vZGEtdG8tZmlnaHQtZm9yLWFzaWEtY3VwLWJlcnRoLWFzLWluZGlhLWV5ZS1zZXJpZXMtd2luLTMyMjc3NzLSAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vd2VzdC1pbmRpZXMtdnMtaW5kaWEtMjAyMi80dGgtdDIwaS1peWVyLWhvb2RhLXRvLWZpZ2h0LWZvci1hc2lhLWN1cC1iZXJ0aC1hcy1pbmRpYS1leWUtc2VyaWVzLXdpbi0zMjI3NzcyL2FtcC8x?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies 4th T20I Preview: Iyer, Hooda To Fight For Asia Cup Berth As India Eye Series W..  NDTV SportsIndia vs West Indies, IND Playing 11 vs WI (Predicted), 4th T20I, India Tour Of West Indies 2022  Cricket AddictorMiddle order defects to work on as West Indies seek series parity in Florida leg vs India cricket team | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzMatch Preview - West Indies vs India, India in West Indies 2022, 4th T20I  ESPNcricinfoIND vs WI: Shreyas Iyer, Deepak Hooda to Fight For Asia Cup Berth as India Look For Series Win  News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-05 16:59:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lauderhill Cricket Stadium records: Central Broward Regional Park Stadium T20 records and highest innings total","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-lauderhill-cricket-stadium-records-central-broward-regional-park-stadium-t20-records-and-highest-innings-total/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of West Indies 2022","West Indies"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lauderhill Cricket Stadium records: Florida will be hosting international cricket after more than seven months.

The last leg of the ongoing India’s tour of West Indies, in the form of a couple of T20Is, will be played in Florida on this weekend. The fourth and fifth T20Is between India and West Indies will not only decide the result of this series but also provide clarity with respect to India’s subsequent squads for Asia Cup 2022 and ICC T20 World Cup 2022. Hosting an international match after more than seven months, Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground will witness the third bilateral T20I series between West Indies and India.

India, on the other hand, have won two and lost one out of their four Lauderhill T20Is. Highest run-scorers in Lauderhill T20Is are Johnson Charles (182), Rohit Sharma (163), Kieron Pollard (155), Lorcan Tucker (141) and Chris Gayle (138).

He hinted that different combinations could be seen in the coming matches at the Commonwealth Games here. In other words, Ramesh Powar placed on the table the ‘evolve’ excuse ahead of the semifinal against England. The Indian eves defeated Barbados by 100 runs to qualify for the semifinals of the Birmingham CWG. Jemimah Rodrigues, who was promoted to No. 3, played a vital 56-run knock to ensure India’s victory. “We are an evolving team and processes and plans will change. We are trying to get the best out of the players,” Powar said on the eve of the semifinal against England. “We felt Jemimah is ready for the No. 3 role as she has been playing in England for a while. We thought we will take a chance with her,” Powar added. India also brought in Taniya Bhatia in place of Yastika Bhatia, who featured in the playing XI in the matches against Sri Lanka recently. “When you come into a marquee event, you are ready with the players and all 15 are available. It’s not a bilateral where you are trying out a player and see what she can do it. It is a marquee event and we want to use whatever we have in our arsenal,” Powar pointed out. “We felt Taniya could be a game changer as far as wicket-keeping is concerned as we are playing with quality bowlers. Taniya has been very good and I think keeping aspect becomes different when we pick her,” Powar added. The Indian eves are just a win away from a medal and Powar said the women have been inspired by long jumper Murali Sreeshankar’s silver-winning display. “It gave us goose-bumps. We were watching our long jumper win silver, that boy was trying so hard. Our job is to go out there and try as hard as Sreeshankar did, he was an inspiration to us,” Powar signed off.  ","pubDate":"2022-08-05 14:34:59","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Powar-and-Kaur-300x167.jpg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"It’s just not cricket – Sarah Glenn says silver or bronze would be ‘a bit weird’","link":"https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/just-not-cricket-sarah-glenn-143426063.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-05 14:34:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ahead of CWG 2022 semifinal, India women’s cricket team picks brains of hockey stars","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/commonwealth-games/news/cwg-2022-semifinal-india-womens-cricket-team-hockey-sreejesh/article65732652.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Shayan Acharya  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"After defeating Pakistan and Barbados in the group league matches and booking a semifinal berth against England on Saturday, Powar admits that the team is gearing up for the challenge.","content":"A plush hotel in the heart of Birmingham has been the ‘home’ for India’s women’s cricket team ever since it arrived in the city. While the team has missed out on living in the main Commonwealth Games village, the players and the support staff have ensured that they at least catch up with athletes from other disciplines and pick their brains. After qualifying for the semifinals and setting up a date with England, the Women in Blue went to the Games village for an interaction with the members of the Indian men’s hockey team - captain Manpreet Singh and PR Sreejesh - on Thursday. While Jemimah Rodrigues, who has played junior-level hockey for Maharashtra, put out pictures of the meeting on social media, other members of the cricket team learnt a thing or two from the hockey stars. “It’s a little bit of a regret that we could have stayed in the Village, but unfortunately, we are not staying there. But we had an interaction with Sreejesh and Manpreet and we shared a few thought processes in terms of how they handle the pressure and how to approach big games,” head coach Ramesh Powar said. “Sreejesh was very active, he interacted with the girls nicely. Manpreet was a bit busy, but Sreejesh gave us a lot of time. He made the girls dance and that was the biggest takeaway for me, it was a good interaction overall…” In the Village, the team also watched the long jump events where Murali Sreeshankar won a silver. “That gave us inspiration that the boy was trying so hard (to win a medal). Our job is to go out there and just try as hard as he did. We all were glued to the TV screen and watched it live. Him winning a silver medal gave us goosebumps,” Powar said. After defeating Pakistan and Barbados in the group league matches and booking a semifinal berth against England on Saturday, Powar admits that the team is gearing up for the challenge. In the 2017 World Cup final, India lost to England, crashing its hopes of clinching the title, while the Indian coach does not consider the CWG semifinal as a revenge match, Powar believes that the team will put its ‘best foot forward’. “At the end of the day, it is a game of cricket. It is not life and death. We will put our best foot forward and give the people of India a reason to smile,” the head coach added, making it clear that all the players are now expressing themselves and communicating better in fulfilling their roles. Against Barbados, Jemimah Rodrigues, who was promoted to number three, played a vital 56-run knock, which set the tone for India’s win. Powar admits that they are evolving as a team. “We are an evolving team and processes and plans will change. We are trying to get the best out of them...” “We felt Jemi is ready for this as she has been playing in England for a while. We thought we will take a chance on her,” he added.

Notably, several South Asian, including Indian-origin players, have represented England’s junior sides but Singh is well aware of the challenges his son will face as he seeks to transition to the top level. His son Harry opens the batting for the Lancashire 2nd XI. “It’s not easy, you need a bit of luck and lots of runs to make it at the top level. I have seen many cricketers in the 90s who used to do well in domestic cricket but they failed drastically when they represented the Indian team. As Harry grows, he will have to make those technical adjustments which every cricketer does,” RP Singh further said. Harry began playing cricket at the age of eight. He was good at football too but as he grew up, his interest in cricket kept increasing. It was then that the family decided that its lone son would play cricket under his father’s coaching. “He used to bowl fast but I know that fast bowling and opening the batting can take a lot of tolls.

Hardik Pandya’s injury halted the combination of the side and that also played a big part in the process. Chahal is still a regular in the team, whereas Kuldeep is searching for his place back in the side. Sanjay Manjrekar has voted against playing the duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal in the T20 World Cup. Yuzvendra Chahal is set to lead the Indian spin attack, and Manjrekar insists that either Axar Patel or R Ashwin will be partnering him in the T20 World Cup in Australia. “In T20 cricket where you have Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav both playing together as two spinners. Either it’ll be Axar Patel or Chahal or it’ll be Ashwin or Chahal,” Sanjay Manjrekar said to Sports 18. “I don’t see Chahal and Kuldeep getting reunited, maybe in 50 overs cricket they would.” Most ODI 4+ wicket hauls for India at opponent’s home: 5 – Jasprit Bumrah 5 – Yuzvendra Chahal 5 – Kuldeep Yadav Three current bowlers jointly at the top! #WIvIND — Kausthub Gudipati (@kaustats) July 28, 2022 Kuldeep has been out of favour from the Indian side, but he was not even a regular in IPL with Kolkata Knight Riders. However, Kuldeep was bought by Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2022, and he had an excellent season with him. He finished as the 5th highest wicket-taker of IPL 2022 with 21 wickets. Kuldeep was then selected for the 5-match T20I series against South Africa, but he got injured which forced him to miss the whole UK tour as well. He is currently with the Indian T20I team in West Indies, but he has not got his chances so far in the initial three T20Is.","pubDate":"2022-08-05 12:17:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"TV ratings: Comm Games mind blowing numbers","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2022-latest-news-results-and-medal-tally-from-day-8/news-story/1721a16f1d08e1f7f47222ebce7fa90b","keywords":["Commonwealth Games","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australians can’t get enough of the Commonwealth Games, with millions tuning in across the nation on television and online to watch the multi-sport event.","content":"Thanks to the time difference, Australia’s best athletes are sometimes competing in the middle of the night Australian time, but that has not deterred more than 9.9 million Australians tuning into the Channel 7’s Birmingham 2022 broadcast on TV. Seven West Media chief revenue officer Kurt Burnette said the network’s Games coverage had captivated Australians in exceptional numbers. “Our exclusive, live and free coverage of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games delivered incredible and magical moments and hours of engaging entertainment for millions of Australians,” Mr Burnette said. “(Television commercial agency) Total TV (is) showing the Games dominated viewing every day and night.”More than 1.77 million have also caught the Games online on 7Plus, where video on demand engagement is up 165 per cent from the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and live streaming up 86 per cent. Seven West Media chief digital officer Gereurd Roberts said 7Plus was soaring to new heights in 2022, with the Games smashing streaming records. “In the past seven days, more than 294 million minutes have been streamed across 7Plus’s 30 dedicated exclusive and free, live and replay Commonwealth Games channels,” Mr Roberts said. “7Plus’s coverage of our all-star Australian team is reaching new and existing viewers in new ways on different screens.”The Games night session has averaged 968,000 total viewers so far, including 26,000 via video on demand, and is the No.1 most watched program in its timeslot. Younger viewers in particular have taken to 7Plus, with Virtual Australia data recording 19 per cent of people aged 18 to 39 watched the sporting action exclusively on Seven Plus. OzTAM – which measures television audience engagement – shows the Seven Network is No.1 across the country, in capital cities and the 16 to 39 age range so far in 2022. “Our innovative and comprehensive coverage has delivered huge national total television shares every day it’s aired and has increased Seven’s winning lead in total people and 16 to 39s in 2022,” Mr Burnette said.Metros Comm Games MTkicker’NOT LEGAL’: JENNEKE DENIED RECORD IN HURDLES BLITZThe Michelle Jenneke revival continues with the Aussie through to the final and a genuine medal contender after clocking a personal record time - but it won’t count.Jenneke ran a personal best time of 12.63, three-hundredths of a second faster than she ran in the semi finals at the World Championships but due to the wind the time won’t be recorded as legal.But it was not enough to finish first with new world record holder and world champion Tobi Amusan dominating the heat to win in Games record 12.40.It was a relaxed looking Jenneke who performed a toned-down version of her signature “jiggle’ ahead of the race.Fellow Aussie Celeste Mucci also qualified for Sunday’s final, scraping in with the eighth fastest time of 12.96 seconds.“It doesn’t count as a legal time but, that’s the fastest I’ve ever covered a 100m over hurdles so really stoked,” she said afterwards.“I’m in the shape of my life. Clearly. It’s just really exciting. I still feel I’ve got a little more in the tank so we’ll see in a couple of days.“I feel I run best when I am happy and relaxed. Just soaking it all up. I’m not someone who likes to be super focussed on what I do. Even in the call room I am chatting with the officials. That’s what I do.”Amusan of Nigeria broke the women’s world record in the 100m hurdles in Oregon and a debate erupted around the shoe she wore.While not wearing the controversial shoe herself, Jenneke gave her opinion ahead of her competition in Birmingham.“I ran quite a PB in that race and ran in the same shoes that I have been running in for the last five years,” Jenneke said.“I know I can’t attribute my PB to the shoes because it’s the same shoe, the same model of shoe.“I have tried some of the newer spikes that they have coming out, the technology is amazing, and I’m sure people are faster but at the same time if you go back 10, 20 years, look at the shoes people were wearing, they were entirely different to what we were wearing five years ago. The technology is forever evolving.By Joe BartonAustralia and Sri Lanka are more familiar doing battle on the cricket pitch, and with four giants bordering on 200cm taking to the sand, you felt like each of them could do a job if given the new ball at a Gabba Test.But beach volleyball is the sport which has taken their hearts and, for the second Games in a row, Australia’s men are through to the medal matches after surviving a scare against Sri Lanka to reach Saturday’s semi-final.After conceding the first set, the pairing of Chris McHugh and Paul Burnett prevailed 16-21 21-16 15-9 to set up a semi-final with Rwanda.Australia, surprisingly, dropped the first set 21-16 against their unfancied rivals – who only scraped into the quarter-finals as one of two third-place finishers.In blustery conditions at the Smithfield arena in Birmingham, the defending champions appeared to struggle with the wind as their serves didn’t have their regular sting.It was the Aussie pair’s first dropped set of the whole Commonwealth Games, and they responded as you’d expect of the top seeded team.With the experienced McHugh cranking up his lethal right hand to fire some unreturnable winners, Australia led from the first change of ends and never looked back to take it 21-16 and force a deciding set.The final set is a race to 15 points, and Australia jumped out of the blocks beautifully to lead 8-4 and have the semi-final result within reach.A controversial video referee call to overturn an Australian point – that would’ve extended their lead to 12-8 – momentarily halted the charge, but they closed out the win just inside an hour.9:30PM AUSSIE THROUGH TO FINALReigning Commonwealth Games silver medalist and Australian record holder Brooke Buschkuehl has easily qualified for Sunday’s final in the long jump.Buschkuehl leapt 6.84m, only one centimetre behind Ghana’s Deborah Acquah, who delivered the biggest leap of the qualifying round.Buschkuehl broke the Australian record last month with a jump of 7.05 metres and is in career-best form. In the women’s 1500m Australia’s three female star middle distance runners, Jessica Hull, Abbey Caldwell and Linden Hall are all through to Sunday’s final.Australia’s chances of sweeping the road cycling golds at the Commonwealth Games has suffered a huge blow with Caleb Ewan withdrawing from the road race. Ewan, described as the “fastest man in the world” by teammates such as Luke Plapp, underwent surgery last Monday to remove a surgical plate from his collarbone - which was inserted after he crashed at the 2021 Tour de France. AusCycling had hoped that Ewan would be able to compete despite the surgery.But unsurprisingly on Friday they announced that the star sprinter would not start the road race in Warwick after it was “apparent” he was unable to race. “I’m devastated that I won’t be able to represent Australia in the green and gold this weekend, but after talking with my doctors it’s clear that I need to make the difficult decision to prioritise my health,” Ewan said. “I’ll be watching the race on television and hoping the team can get the job done for Australia.” It is a huge blow for Australia with Ewan widely expected to fight out with the Isle of Man superstar Mark Cavendish over the 160km flat course. Australia’s second best chance, young gun Kaden Groves, pulled out of the race a couple of weeks ago because of pro team commitments. It means Rohan Dennis, who won the individual time trial, Luke Durbridge, Luke Plapp, Miles Scotson and Sam Fox will be tasked with continuing Australia’s dominance on the road after a clean sweep in the time trial. All three Aussie women’s 1m springboarders are through to this morning’s final after breezing through the preliminary round. Esther Qin, who won bronze in this event at the Gold Coast Games, had the third best result in the preliminary round, scoring 266.95. Georgia Sheehan, back in the green and gold after taking time out of the sport to deal with burnout and mental health issues, took out fourth spot.Brittany O’Brien, a former platform diver who switched to springboard to reduce the toll on her body, qualified through eighth. Sam Fricker and Shixin Li are up next in the men’s 3m springboard synchronised finals. SPRINT TEEN FREAK WE’LL BE TALKING ABOUT IN 2026While all eyes were on the track in Birmingham, Australia’s next Commonwealth Games star emerged more than 8000km away.Queenslander Calab Law ran third in the world under-20 athletics championships 200m final, clocking a time of 20.48.The 18-year-old, who was already considered one of the fastest teens Australia has ever produced, ran what was described as the “race of his life” in Cali, Colombia.He finished behind only Blessing Akawasi Afrifah (Israel) and Lesile Tebogo (Botswana), who both recorded times of 19.96 secs.That mark was a new championships record and would have beaten the Commonwealth Games record of 19.97 set by Frankie Fredericks in 1994.Law’s time set a new personal best and strengthened his claims as one of Australia’s top sprint prospects after reaching the semi-finals in the 200m of the recent World Athletics Championships.Law finished 21st in the world in the Eugene event. He has previously run in the 100m but withdrew to focus on the 200m. After setting a new PB in the semi-final, he told Athletics Australia: “I did what I wanted to do, and now I’m there. I was planning to run faster than that but the rain delay felt like three hours, I had a little nap until about 30-minutes to go. I’m just relaxed naturally, I don’t put too much pressure on myself because it takes too much energy.”The final was slower than the semi-final due to a headwind. FAMILY FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES DURING CYCLING CRASH Alex Smith, The SunThe family involved in the horror cycling crash at the Commonwealth Games feared for their lives.The shocking accident came in the men’s scratch race when England’s Matt Walls collided with other riders at high speed and flew over the barriers and into the crowd.Cycling fan Hugh Colvin was spectating alongside his two children — aged five and seven — and a few family friends, when Walls catapulted over the barrier.Colvin’s wife Laura was not at the velodrome but she described the terror: “What has been hard for us to get our head around is how close this came to being a complete catastrophe.“And how close our two younger children came to being seriously injured or killed. And that has been the main thing we’ve had to reflect on over the last few days.”Colvin himself said to the BBC: “It all happened so incredibly quickly at the speed the cyclists were going.“You can see the trajectory of the bike, it came through, grazed my daughter’s shoulder, and one of the photos you can see we are obviously underneath the wheel.“Looking back at the photos it must have been within centimetres, millimetres, of our heads.”Early reports from a Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said three riders went to hospital and two injured fans only required treatment by medics on site.However, one of the family friends did go to hospital, Mrs Colvin said: “He suffered a laceration to the bone which the hospital have described as being like a machete injury.“He’s still waiting for surgery. It is the start of a long road to recovery for him.”She also revealed that Walls video-called her children to help them come to terms with what happened.‘TWERKER’ STEALS SHOW ON COMM GAMES COVERAGE A rugby fan caught the BBC cameras by surprise by twerking as she was filmed in the crowd during the Commonwealth Games.The Rugby Sevens action was interrupted as one fan showed off her dancing — and her bum.Cameras picked up three women enjoying their day out in Coventry at the Commonwealth Games.But as the fan in the middle spotted herself on the big screen, she seized her moment with both hands.After taking a swig of her drink, the supporter stood up and turned her bum to the camera before starting to twerk.While her friends were left in hysterics by the X-rated performance, the BBC team was caught completely off guard.The stunned BBC commentator said there is “plenty of dancing” going on in the crowd, before the cameras quickly cut away and back to the match action.Updates to story","pubDate":"2022-08-05 12:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Asia Cup: 3 times India-Pakistan teams have chance to face each other","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/asia-cup-3-times-india-pakistan-teams-have-chance-to-face-each-other/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","game","India","Pakistan","T20","T20I"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"There is a possibility that India and Pakistan cricket teams will face each other three times in the upcoming Asia Cup cricket series.

I am playing practice matches now. I am practicing in Chennai currently. My injury has been completely recovered.”Chahar said that the last few months once he got injured were very difficult. Chahar has been out of action right since February 2022 and has not played domestic cricket either.“It was a very difficult time. I had to decide if I wanted to get the surgery done once I was injured. I didn’t go for surgery as I wanted to play IPL. Subsequently, I had pain in my teeth and had to remove the wisdom tooth. I was taking three-four painkillers daily,” Chahar said.Chahar was however confident about playing IPL after recovering from these issues. “Once I started playing after these issues, I thought I will play IPL. But then a stress fracture on my back was detected. And it takes at least four-five months to recover from a stress fracture,” he explained.Chahar has been selected for the tour of Zimbabwe in August and he will look forward to making a comeback in the Indian colours.“It has been six months since I played cricket. It is very difficult to make a comeback after six months. I was looking forward to the Zimbabwe tour for quite some time now, to be back in the blues,” Chahar said.Chahar, however, said that his ultimate aim is to win the T20 World Cup down under, later in the year. But his selection for the T20 squad is uncertain considering the already tough competition amongst the fast bowlers.“I was on standby last year as well at the 2021 T20 World Cup when I thought that I will be a part of the team. It’s not in my hands if I will be on the team or not. I am working hard on my bowling as well as my batting and that is the only thing in my hands.“I will try to score runs when I get a chance to bat and will try to pick up wickets when I get an opportunity to bowl.
