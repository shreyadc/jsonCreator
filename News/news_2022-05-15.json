Symonds made 238 appearances for Australia, establishing himself as one of the best and most popular white-ball players in the world in the 2000s. He scored almost 7,000 international runs – including eight centuries – and took 165 wickets across all formats. Symonds helped Australia win the World Cup in 2003 and 2008 and went on to work for Fox Sports as a pundit after retiring from playing in 2009. His tragic passing comes just two months after Australia cricket legend Shane Warne died at the age of 52. Police say Symonds was involved in a single-car accident at 10.30pm on Saturday night at Hervey Range, west of Townsville on Queensland’s east coast, where his vehicle left the road and rolled over. Symonds, a brilliant all-rounder, helped Australia win two World Cups (Picture: Getty) Paramedics tried to revive the Australia hero but he sadly died. Symonds’ family have confirmed his death and thanked friends and fans for their sympathy and support. Australia legend Adam Gilchrist, who regularly played alongside Symonds, said on social media: ‘This really hurts.’ Former England captain Michael Vaughan added: ‘Simmo… this doesn’t feel real.’ More: Cricket'Nervous' Michael Vaughan reacts to England's appointment of Brendon McCullumIan Botham gives verdict on Ben Stokes replacing Joe Root as England Test captainEngland appoint New Zealand cricket hero Brendon McCullum as Test coach For more stories like this, check our sport page.

When I took the CEO's name, I wanted basically to say he's there to console players sitting out. Really tough for us as well when we select the teams,\" Shreyas said in the post-match press conference.Earlier this week after KKR's 52-run win over Mumbai Indians, Shreyas said it was tough to tell players that they were not in the playing XI while adding that the franchise’s coach Brendon McCullum and CEO Mysore have their say in the line-up too.\"It is really difficult (to tell players they won't play). Coach and at times, CEO is also obviously involved in team selections,\" Shreyas Iyer told official broadcaster Star Sports.The 27-year-old skipper, however, added that players took it well as they were all pumped up to win the game, where KKR made five changes to their playing XI after a humiliating 75-run loss to Lucknow Super Giants over the weekend.\"Each and every player takes it well, and they have put in their best efforts. The win was comprehensive, and when I spoke to the players, they were pumped up to win the game today,\" he said.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPL Live Score, IPL 2022 schedule, IPL 2022 Points table and Entertainment News.

Those performances earned him a Man of the Match award.KKR went upto the sixth spot post the win with 12 points but with just one match remaining for them, Shreyas Iyer and Co may not fancy their chances to the playoffs.SRH, meanwhile, stayed in eighth place following a fifth-straight defeat but unlike KKR, SRH still have two more matches in hand.Russell had a fun night out in Pune and he had few more reasons to celebrate as he achieved individual milestones. Let’s take a look at that and more here:Shreyas Iyer played his 100th IPL match during KKR’s game against SRH on Saturday. Iyer began his IPL career with Delhi Capitals (then Delhi Daredevils) in 2015 but was eventually picked up by KKR ahead of this season. He’s scored a total of 2726 runs so far.Andre Russell had reasons to relish this game as it saw him become the fastest to 2000 IPL runs in terms of balls faced. As per IPL’s official website, Russell has thus far amassed 2030 runs from 1133 balls striking at 179.17.'Dre Russ', as Russell is fondly called, joined an elite list of players to have scored 300 runs and taken 15 wickets in the same season. Shane Watson, Dwayne Bravo, Jacques Kallis, and Sunil Narine are the only others to have achieved the feat in a single IPL season before.SRH’s Umran Malik finished with figures of 3/33 against KKR. Malik scalped all three wickets inside two overs. While he removed Nitish Rana and Ajinkya Rahane in the eighth over, he got rid of Shreyas Iyer in the 10th over of the match. This also ended Umran’s wicketless run of three matches, during a time where he conceded 125 runs combined without taking a wicket.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

Joe Root, on 99, effortlessly clipped the ball away off his pads and scampered the single he needed to bring up his first century of the summer. With all the comings and goings, firings and hirings of the past few weeks it was a timely reminder from Root, as if anyone really needed one, that he is still around, still in great form and still the best red-ball batter in the country. Root lifted his helmet to reveal that beaming, mischievous smile and raised his arms to the blue skies. It was a poignant moment for the batter formerly known as the England Men’s Test Captain and an innings that will have pleased the newly formed axis of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum with the first Test of the summer looming a matter of weeks away. Yorkshire , just like England of late, needed Root’s runs, he fell to Parkinson eventually for 147 and the home side still trail Lancashire by 210 runs with first innings wickets remaining. The sun was not just shining in God’s own county but up and down the shires. In Beckenham, despite the favourable batting conditions, Kent were put under the pump by Division One leaders Surrey. Jamie Overton, bowling fast and nasty, hit Ben Compton with a short ball that clonked the opener on the head, dislodging Compton’s helmet which plopped down onto the stumps. Celebrations soon turned to confusion, not for the stricken Compton but the Surrey fielders as the umpires informed them that the batter wasn’t out due to an ECB amendment (introduced in 2020) to Law 29 that deems a batter not out if their helmet is knocked off and breaks the wicket. Compton looked rattled nevertheless and fell shortly after to Will Jacks’s off-spin. Jacks picked up four wickets as Surrey bowled Kent out for 230 and stuck them in for another go after tea by enforcing the follow-on. Zak Crawley cutting a frustrated figure as he chopped on to Jacks before the close leaving Kent on 82 for one and 359 runs adrift. Jack Leach twirled his way to eight wickets in the match as Somerset registered their second largest win in 147 years of first-class cricket, thumping Gloucestershire by an innings and 246 runs. Runs kept on flowing at Edgbaston where Warwickshire trail Northamptonshire by 203 runs, Sam Hain playing an obdurate innings to still be there at stumps on 140 off 337 balls. Durham ’s Matthew Potts became the first bowler to 30 wickets in this year’s Championship. Earlier Glamorgan ’s Marnus Labuschagne wheeled away with glee after having Ben Stokes sharply stumped off his bowling but was less happy a few hours later as the shadows crept across Chester-le-Street, Ben Raine pocketing him for 31 to leave the visitors needing 126 more with seven wickets in hand. Nottinghamshire ’s Steven Mullaney launched a blitzkrieg at Lord’s, smearing Middlesex ’s bowlers around HQ in a 58-ball hundred which allowed Notts to declare on 295 for five. Luke Fletcher then removed Mark Stoneman and Josh de Caires to leave Middlesex reeling on 2-0, a relative recovery to 69 for three leaves them facing a tough battle on day four.

Nottinghamshire’s Steven Mullaney launched a blitzkrieg at Lord’s, smearing Middlesex’s bowlers around HQ in a 58 ball hundred, upon reaching the milestone Notts declared on 295-5.

Stay tuned for the tea-time-ish scores on the doors. 5h ago 15.30 Joe Root goes to a hundred! A leg side nurdle off Matt Parkinson sees him scamper a single in the Yorkshire sun. He removes his helmet, lifts his arms in the air and beams. Well batted! 5h ago 15.14 Shhhhhhh... Joe Root is into the nineties at Headingley. Big call I know but reckon he’ll make the Test side this summer... 6h ago 15.12 Will Rhodes and Sam Hain are going nicely for Warks against Northants in Brum, they’ve put on 144 and counting since Sibley fell this morning for 52. They do still trail by 349 on first innings though, after they were Vasconcelos’d (and Young’d and Procter’d) in the first two days. 6h ago 15.02 Durham have lost a quick coupe of wickets , Borthwick didn’t get to three figures, bowled by that man Labuschagne for 90 and David Bedingham was castled by Neser in the next over. Durham are 192-6 and the Captain of England’s (men’s) Test side is at the crease. 6h ago 14.52 At Lord’s Steven Mullaney has just mullered Tim Murtagh into the stands for six. A swish and a flick off a leg side ball from the veteran seamer. Notts are racking up a commanding lead against Middlesex at HQ. And another six! Mullaney plays a magnificent lofted drive off Holman. Notts’ lead is over 400. 6h ago 14.45 At Chester-le-Street Alex Lees has been prised out by Glamorgan’s Marnus Laboooshayne for 61... but Scott Borthwick is going strong on 87* (unlucky for some/antipodeans). Mr B Stokes is the next man in should another wicket fall. 6h ago 14.36 Back to the Ben Compton Schrödinger’s cat esque helmet on/off non wicket from 12:22, Romeo has been doing some diligent digging into the detail: “Hi Jim, on Ben Compton’s helmet being knocked off and it hitting the stumps, he was not out not due to a change in the Laws of Cricket but to an ECB Playing Regulation which was introduced in 2020 for the BWT. Law 29 – The wicket is down 29.1 Law 29 shall apply except that: Law 29.1.1.4 is replaced by: by the striker’s person or by any part of his/her clothing or equipment being worn, or by any part of the striker’s clothing or equipment becoming detached from his/her person. However, any detached equipment shall not include the striker’s protective helmet, or any part thereof, as defined in Appendix A2.3. Appendix A2.3 is replaced by: A protective helmet is headwear made of hard material and designed to protect the head, neck and/or the face. For the purposes of interpreting these Laws of Cricket, such a description will include faceguards, grilles and neck guards. https://resources.ecb.co.uk/ecb/document/2021/05/18/985f0615-44e0-434b-b4be-ca60e01418cc/Playing-conditions-LV-Insurance-County-Championship-180521.pdf (page 21). So it wouldn’t apply to a cap but you can’t wear a cap in the CC any more.” So now we know, ta v much Romeo, I tip my cap/helmet to you.

They are now six wickets down and trail by a whopping 537 runs. The follow on target of 521 looks a looooooong way away. JOverton is bowling with real venom and Will Jacks looks as if he could get a wicket with every ball, a posse of cream-clad hyenas surrounding the bat. 7h ago 13.40 Men in white coats are starting to appear on my many screens, I’m going to stretch my legs and make a brew, keep an eye on things for me won’t you? 7h ago 13.36 Cheese and pickle sarnie time as I cast my eye around the stream highlights, this has made me chuckle over my cheddar: Absolute seed. 😮‍💨🤌 @TomBaildog 🌹 #RedRoseTogether pic.twitter.com/9XnKe4kXmF — Lancashire Cricket (@lancscricket) May 14, 2022 7h ago 13.23 Lunchtime Scores Division Two Durham 311 & 140/3 (47) Glamorgan 365 Durham lead by 86 runs with 7 wickets remaining Nottinghamshire 415 & 113/3 (30) Middlesex 195 Nottinghamshire lead by 333 runs with 7 wickets remaining Leicestershire 210 & 11/0 (6) Sussex 450 Leicestershire trail by 229 runs with 10 wickets remaining Worcestershire 368 Derbyshire 381/6 (106) Derbyshire lead by 13 runs with 4 wickets remaining Updated at 13.27 BST 7h ago 13.19 Lunchtime Scores Division One Northamptonshire 597/6 dec Warwickshire 162/3 (73) Warwickshire trail by 435 runs with 7 wickets remaining Lancashire 566/9 dec Yorkshire 171/5 (52) Yorkshire trail by 395 runs with 5 wickets remaining Somerset 591/7 dec Gloucestershire 186/8 (74) Gloucestershire trail by 405 runs with 2 wickets remaining Surrey 671/9 dec Kent 116/5 (48) Kent trail by 555 runs with 5 wickets remaining Updated at 13.31 BST 8h ago 12.58 Luke Fletcher giving the stattos something to purr over...

In the meantime, the esteemed Gary Naylor has popped up in my inbox: “Jim -it’s obvious, just now, that Matt Parkinson spins the ball hardest and Jamie Overton bowls the ball fastest. If neither is picked at Lord’s, it will be a travesty - it’s not like they’re trying to break into a settled, successful team.” The non-selection of Parkinson has been a particular head-scratcher, I reckon he’ll get a go this summer under the Ben/Brendon axis. Matty Parkinson in the wickets again 🌪 He is the leading wicket-taker for spinners in Division One #LVCountyChamp pic.twitter.com/Zscfn9UfLu — LV= Insurance County Championship (@CountyChamp) May 14, 2022 Updated at 12.49 BST 8h ago 12.22 I’ve got eyes on Joe vs Jimmy but also on Beckenham where Jamie Overton is bowling with some real gusto, with ‘gas’ as the kids might say. There’s drama as he clocks Ben Compton on the helmet and the Kent batters’ lid comes clean off and plops onto the stumps. Surrey celebrarte the wicket (and show some cursory concern for Compton) but Compton is given NOT OUT. Something to do with the helmet not being on his person as it broke the stumps which I think is a recent rule change? As I type this up from a few moments ago, Compton has been snared by Will Jacks for 47, the off spinner has picked up a brace this morning.

That’s the main story from this round of the County Champo, and indeed the previous rounds too, largely dry weather and true pitches have seen the scoreboard’s up and down the land a’clattering. There have been hundreds, double hundreds and even records tumbling in this round alone, heck there’s even a few batters in with a whiff of a chance of notching up 1000 runs before the end of May, something of a run-scoring grail for the willow wielders. Jim here on this sunny Saturday, stepping in for Tanya as she has a well deserved day off. I’ll be popping up with updates and interesting tid-bits from around the grounds throughout the day. As ever I’ll be reliant on your eyes and ears so please do keep me company and get in touch below the line, on email or the twitters.

During the 61st match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the MCA Stadium in Pune, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) have handed the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) their fifth consecutive defeat by 54 runs, to still stay in contention for the race towards the playoffs. En route a healthy target of 178, on what was a challenging pitch to bat on, the SRH skipper Kane Williamson (9 off 17) yet again struggled to get going, while providing his side a poor start, having posted mere 31/1 after the end of the Powerplay. Apart from the youngster Abhishek Sharma (43 off 28) – the only SRH batter to have looked at ease during his stay at the crease, no other player in their batting line-up could stay in there in a bid to stitch a partnership, nor could come up with some lusty blows for an Over or two, as all they could garner and post was 123/8 in their 20 Overs. Andre Russell, with his figures of 4-0-22-3 was the pick of the KKR bowlers, as he put up a proper all-round show, while also smashing an unbeaten 49* off 28 deliveries in the first innings as well. KKR vs SRH man of the match Courtesy of an all-round effort in a must-win match for KKR, there were no points for guessing that it was Andre Russell, who was fittingly awarded the ‘Player of the Match’ for today’s encounter. Coming in to bat with his team struggling at 94/5 after 11.3 Overs, Russell, made sure he played with caution in his initial few deliveries, and kept on believing in his hitting prowess to turn the game with a powerful finish. With Washington Sundar bowling the final Over of the innings, the Windies giant, smashed the off-spinner for three sixes to collect 20 runs in total, as KKR managed to post an above-par total of 177/6 on a relatively sluggish track.

His 17-ball 9 today was symbolic of the lean patch that he finds himself in at the moment while his team has been going from bad to worse as they end up suffering a fifth defeat on the trot, though they still have two games left in the league stage. The Knight Riders though, are starting to peak at the right time as they pull off a second win in a row with a margin in excess of 50 runs, their 54-run thrashing of the Sunrisers also their third win in their last four outings, which takes them past Punjab Kings to the sixth spot on the points table with a game in hand.

The required rate though, still is in excess of 10.22:14 (IST)After 7 overs,Sunrisers Hyderabad 37/1 ( Abhishek Sharma 22 , Rahul Tripathi 5)IPL 2022 Live Score, KKR vs SRH: Varun Chakravarthy introduced on the other side of the powerplay.

Quite the powerplay spell this from the senior pacer, who returns to the XI after being benched in Kolkata’s last two games. He has given away just 10 from the three overs he’s bowled so far. Williamson, meanwhile, is struggling at the moment, having collecting just 9 off 15, and will really have to start swinging his bat anytime now.21:52 (IST)After 3 overs,Sunrisers Hyderabad 17/0 ( Abhishek Sharma 11 , Kane Williamson (C) 6)IPL 2022 Live Score, KKR vs SRH: Another chance goes begging in this over, this time Umesh failing to collect one off his own bowling after Williamson clobbers the ball in his direction.

Starts off well with a single off each of the first two balls, before his execution goes horribly wrong as Dre Russ ends up smashing three sixes in the last four deliveries — all of which come off full tosses that hard-hitting batters like Russell feast on.20 runs smashed in the last over as Kolkata Knight Riders finish on 177/5 after opting to bat.

An under-pressure Bhuvi also ends up conceding a couple of wides, attempting to bowl it well outside off to keep it out of Dre Russ’ reach. He ensures he doesn’t finish wicketless today, removing Billings in the penultimate delivery. Six runs and a wicket from his final over of the evening as he signs off with figures of 1/27.21:16 (IST)IPL 2022 Live Score, KKR vs SRH: OUT! Bhuvneshwar has a wicket today after all, as he foxes Billings with a slower bouncer in his penultimate ball of the evening.

Seven runs and a wicket from the over.20:37 (IST)IPL 2022 Live Score, KKR vs SRH: OUT! What a ball from Natarajan! It's a searing yorker that Rinku fails to bring his bat down to in time. The umpire though, takes his own time in raising his finger. Bit of confusion though following the dismissal as non-striker Sam Billings signalled for the review, and not the batter in question Rinku, and the umpire doesn't take Billings' signal into account as the timer runs out. Both umpires then have to explain the situation thoroughly to the two KKR batters. Good for Kolkata though, as the ball would've been hitting the base of the stumps, and burned the review.

Bowls a snorter to Iyer in the second delivery, a 148 kmph bouncer aimed at the batter’s helmet which Iyer attempted to ramp over the keeper in vain. The KKR skipper collects a boundary off the third, driving it down the ground past the bowler. Umran strikes back two balls later, collecting his third wicket in two overs as Iyer falls for 15. Five runs and a wicket from the over. KKR once again looking shaky as the reach 83/4 at the halfway stage.20:25 (IST)IPL 2022 Live Score, KKR vs SRH: OUT! What a spell this is turning out to be from Malik, as he gets rid of the Knight Riders skipper this time!

And he starts off with a delivery nearly measuring 147 clicks. And he starts off his spell with a bang, removing both set batters Rana and Rahane in a space of four deliveries with Shashank Singh taking the catch on both occasions to tilt the balance of the game back in the Sunrisers’ favour.

Spin introduced for the first time with Washington Sundar taking over from Natarajan. Starts off with a couple of dots before Rahane goes for an aerial chip over extra cover, just for one, once again struggling to make it to the other end. He decides to take the aerial route in the fifty delivery, clobbering the ball over long on after getting one in the slot from Sundar.

The decision is being taken keeping in mind India's marquee tour of England. They could also be rested for the two T20s against Ireland, which will be played ahead of the England tour. It is understood that Shikhar Dhawan and Gujarat Titans (GT) skipper could be handed leadership goals for the home series against South Africa and also against England in two T20Is. The touring South Africa squad is expected to be announced on May 22, when the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 will be in its business end. The five-match T20I series between India and South Africa is scheduled to go underway on June 9 in Delhi, with the remaining games being held at Cuttack, Visakhapatnam, Rajkot and Bengaluru respectively. \"All the senior India players will get at least three and half weeks of complete rest. Rohit, Virat, KL, Rishabh and Jasprit will all directly go to England for the 'fifth Test' following the white-ball series. We need all our key players to remain fresh for the England series,\" a senior unnamed BCCI source told PTI. It is believed that all the senior players, who play across formats for India, will not be part of the next seven T20 Internationals, as per the BCCI's workload management. Asked about captaincy, the source said: \"The selectors have a couple of choices. Shikhar Dhawan, as he has already captained India in absence of Virat, Rohit and Rahul during last year's Sri Lanka series. But Hardik Pandya's impressive captaincy for Gujarat Titans hasn't gone unnoticed. So it will be a close call,\" he added. Moshin Khan could edge Umran Malik to bag India call up Umran Malik has produced consistently pace of around 150kmph for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the ongoing tournament. However, the BCCI believes that he is too raw and more time with India A could help him improve. While he remains in the mix with death overs specialist Arshdeep Singh, the bowler who could be a 'Dark Horse' is Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) fast bowler Mohsin Khan. \"Our pace bowling department is set and selectors might not experiment too much. But yes, Mohsin has impressed almost everyone with his pace, bounce and swing in this edition. He does have a chance. Having said that, not ruling out Umran or Arshdeep either, but Mohsin might just be slightly ahead,\" the source further added. It is understood that most of the players who were a part of the T20 series against Sri Lanka and the West Indies earlier this year will be retained by Team India irrespective of their current IPL form. While, Suryakumar Yadav or Ravindra Jadeja's injury needs to be monitored and Deepak Chahar, who has been out of action due to various injuries, will also not be available. The likes of Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer, and Deepak Hooda along with Dhawan and Hardik are set to be the core of the batting unit. Sanju Samson could also be retained and there could be at the max one left-field selection in the squad. In the pace bowling unit, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Prasidh Krishna, Harshal Patel, and Avesh Khan are all expected to be selected, along with the IPL's stellar spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal. Kuldeep Yadav is also expected to make the cut.","pubDate":"2022-05-14 18:03:27","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/05/14/500x300_1292176-rohit.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Rinku Singh protests against umpire's decision as DRS controversy headlines KKR vs SRH game","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ipl-2022-rinku-singh-protests-against-umpires-decision-as-drs-controversy-headlines-kkr-vs-srh-game-10674831.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Rinku Singh protests against umpire's decision as DRS controversy headlines KKR vs SRH game","content":"A drama unfolded when Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) took on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in an IPL 2022 league match on Saturday.

Billings did signal for a DRS call but Rinku, being the batter in action, failed to make the required signal to the umpires within the stipulated 10 seconds. And with the two KKR batters having a chat, umpire Anil Kumar Chaudhary walked to the batters to say they cannot take the review anymore.Billings would go on to contribute 34 runs while Andre Russell’s unbeaten 49 led KKR to 177/6 from 20 overs, meaning SRH need 178 runs to win the contest.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

India’s Thomas Cup team had made it to the quarter-finals of the prestigious tournament after over 25 years and instead of preparing for the next day’s match, chief coach Vimal Kumar was trying to figure out how to change the team’s return flight ticket due to their extended stay.Sixteen years later, Vimal Kumar had in a pre-departure interview insisted that the men could create history. By reaching the semi-finals of the prestigious tournament for the first time ever, the bunch of 10 racquet wielding warriors have already written their names in the annals of Indian badminton history.But the journey from 2006 was anything but smooth. In the last 14 years, the men’s team made it to the last eight a couple of times but no one really considered them a medal prospect despite India boasting of over half a dozen men’s singles players in the top-50 in world ranking.Though badminton is an individual sport, team championships like the Thomas Uber Cup need a collective effort from the entire team and just relying on three singles players to pull off a heist was never a realistic possibility.The traditional badminton powerhouses boast of a squad that provides them the ability to win all five matches on their day and the lack of depth in that area had definitely hurt Indian chances in the past. The absence of even the top singles players due to injuries or simply taking a break, knowing that the team did not really had a chance only made matters worse.But anyone who had followed Indian badminton over the last two decades knew that a special performance was just a heartbeat away and all it needed was a bit of luck and a lot of self-belief.The men had spent over a decade in the towering shadow of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu’s achievements on the big stage and the girls had even taken India to two Uber Cup bronze medals with the help of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa back in 2014 and 2016.But 2022 had a completely different complexion since the start. Srikanth and Sen started the year as World Championships silver and bronze medallists respectively, HS Prannoy finally finding the rhythm and the consistency he had been craving for years and the doubles combination of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty bagged the India Open crown and had been consist for the past couple of years.This meant that when the Indian team left for Thailand, they knew that they had at least four opportunities to score those three valuable points required to clinch a tie. However, they did hit a stumbling block in their first real challenge when they lost 2-3 against Chinese Taipei in the Group stage.But the form of Srikanth and Prannoy would have given the team management hope as both of them were quite clinical in their victories and if either Sen or Satwik-Chirag could win them a point, the opponents were always going to chase the match.Though Sen, the highest ranked Indian in the line-up, hasn’t been able to win in the team’s last three outings, one cannot ignore his contribution to this dream run. The youngster has been facing some of the world’s best players as a No. 1 player and beating them was never going to be easy. But it is also a fact that his dream run in the last eight months put him in that position and also ensured that India’s experienced campaigners got a shot at the next the best bunch.But in a tournament of this stature, this is probably just a miniscule advantage that top players need to pounce on and Srikanth, Prannoy have done just that when it mattered. Even Chirag and Satwik did not allow the five match points that they lost over the course of two games against their Danish opponents to affect their moral despite the scrutiny.And all that was possible because the bunch was motivated to leave a mark and were willing to go that extra mile.Prannoy had a nasty slip in the first game of the do-or-die match in the semi-final against Denmark’s Rasmus Gemke and injured his ankle. In normal circumstances, a player may think of giving up to ensure that the injury isn’t aggravated with a long season ahead. But he decided to push himself and not bother about the consequences.“Maybe yeah [that the win was more mental than physical]. Mentally, there was a lot of things going on today. After the slip, it was hurt a lot more than usual, I was not able to lunge properly. I was wondering what to do, thought I will try to manage somehow. In the mind it was always that: ‘I should not give up.’ Just tried whatever I could, praying that the pain doesn’t aggravate,” he said after the match.The team camaraderie was also on display through out the quarterfinals against Malaysia and the semi-finals as the players went all-out cheering their teammates, even dousing the intensity of the din created by the Malaysian fans in the last eight stage.Shetty put words to those feelings after the semi-final triumph when he said, “We want to win it for the team. We are giving everything we have on the court and also off it. You can see, I’ve lost my voice shouting. It was the same against Malaysia yesterday. We had to match them with our voices.”After a well-deserved day’s rest, they will have to once again come out all guns blazing against defending champions Indonesia on Sunday and they would probably have to make much more noise against the far more vociferous Indonesian fans as the group chases a position of immortality in India’s badminton universe.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

Hyderabad are back with the playing XI that brought them some success this season. They are bowling first and will be raring to go as Hyderabad players walk out to the middle. Venkatesh Iyer and Ajinkya Rahane are the openers for Kolkata. Bhuvneshwar Kumar will start with the ball for Hyderabad. Here we go... The captain of Hyderabad, Kane Williamson says they played on the surface earlier so they were looking to bat first as well. Informs that there are three changes, T Natarajan, Washington Sundar and Marco Jansen come in. Adds that every game carries point, they haven't been at their best in the past few games but they want to turn things around now. Shreyas Iyer, the skipper of Kolkata, says that they will bat first and tells that the record in the previous games here has seen the team winning after batting first and it suits them as well. Mentions that Umesh and Sam Billings come in. Says that they had ups and downs in the tournament and they made changes this season that they do not want to. States that they have gone back to their core team and they had a good start with the ball and bat in the Powerplay in the last game. Hyderabad (Playing XI) - Abhishek Sharma, Kane Williamson (C), Rahul Tripathi, Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran (WK), Shashank Singh, Washington Sundar (In place of Jagadeesha Suchith), Marco Jansen (In place of Fazalhaq Farooqi), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan (In place of Kartik Tyagi), Umran Malik. Kolkata (Playing XI) - Venkatesh Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane, Nitish Rana, Shreyas Iyer (C), Sam Billings (WK) (In for Sheldon Jackson), Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Sunil Narine, Tim Southee, Varun Chakaravarthy, Umesh Yadav (In for Pat Cummins). TOSS - Up goes the coin and it lands in the favor of Kolkata. They have elected to BAT first! Pitch report - Deep Dasgupta is down near the pitch. He says that the pitch has a fair bit of grass and it is lively as well. It looks quite firm and in the last few games spinners had some help on this pitch but he feels that there will not be much help today. Mentions that while the bowlers have enjoyed on this ground in the last few games, the batters will have the last laugh here. Hyderabad, on the other hand, have been doing things in clusters this season. They went on a five-match winning streak earlier this season but since then fallen off the radar with four losses on the trot. The injuries to T Natarajan and Washington Sundar have been a big problem for them and that has made their bowling vulnerable which was their stronger suit earlier. They are, however, expected to be back for this game. They registered a comfortable win against Kolkata earlier this season and would be looking to find a similar form to get back to winning ways. Can they knock Kolkata out of the competition? We shall find out. Toss and team sheets in a while. Kolkata have been pretty inconsistent this season both in terms of results and their team combination. The constant chopping and changing have not helped their cause but they will be happy with their performance in the last game with Venkatesh Iyer and Varun Chakaravarthy, their retained players showing some form. Pat Cummins has been ruled out for the remainder of the season and will be interesting to see how Kolkata go about their business in this must-win game. Hello and a warm welcome to our coverage as Pune get ready to host its final game of this season of the Indian T20 League. It is a crucial encounter as Kolkata will be up against Hyderabad in game number 61 of the season. A loss for Kolkata will end their playoff hopes while a loss for Hyderabad will also put them on the verge of elimination. ...

He announced himself to the grand stage with a gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Through his lengthy career, he added four more Olympic medals (two silver and two bronze), 10 World Championship medals - five in 100m - and is a three-time Diamond League champion in 100m. He set a time of 9.74 seconds in 100m in 2015 - record for a man over the age of 30.But there's an asterisk too. In 2001, he was banned from international competition for two years after testing positive for amphetamines. In 2006, he was banned for eight years for a positive dope test. Reports claimed it was for \"testosterone or its precursor.\"There is also the point in his life where he enjoyed a healthy rivalry with sprint legend Usain Bolt. A rivalry that he admits spurred him on and there was never frustration to see the Jamaican seemingly go past the finish line with utter ease.Having retired now at 40 years old, Gatlin has started to focus on coaching and in being an inspiration for the future generation. As ambassador for the World TCS 10K in Bengaluru, he wishes to leave a legacy that goes beyond just the track. Gatlin spoke virtually to Firstpost.Excerpts:Q. Athletics has had this battle between track and field. Yulimar Rojas, Armand Duplantis dominated in 2020, Karsten Warholm and Elaine Thompson in 2021. What do you make of this internal battle where track athletes dominate media limelight?Gatlin: I can't take things away from any past athletes who have been on the grand stage and have done things that these young athletes are doing right now. It's just that they're doing it in large numbers. You have world records being broken in 400 meter hurdles (men), 400 meter hurdles (women), in pole vault, the world record in women's 100m being a threat. Over eight men in the 100 meters are running stellar times.So you look across the board, everyone is basically clicking on all cylinders, and they're running very fast and competing very well. It's amazing, because I think it's a spark of inspiration. You know, everybody wants to etch their name in history and they're out there doing it.Q. Do rivalries make the sport better and bring in more eyeballs? Or does dominance also play an important role?Gatlin: Both. Depends on the field or the event we're talking about. If there's one person that is just amazing, pretty much head and shoulders over everybody. It's amazing, beautiful to watch.But the thing that audience really loves is competition. The head-to-head competition. Who's going to come out on top? You won last time, who is going to win this time? It gives a better storyline.And I think from an athletes perspective, it keeps you on your toes, it makes you motivated. Sometimes you go out to practice, you don't want to go and you think about that head-to-head competition and say 'No, I got to do one more rep', 'I gotta get better on the track one more time because I got to be ready for this competition.'Q. Speaking of rivalries. Was it ever frustrating to compete alongside Bolt?Gatlin: No not at all. It's inspiring. I can look at him and say, 'I want to be just like that'. Well, if I want to be just like that, or better, then I have to work hard to figure out how I can be at that level. When the gun goes off, we're starting at the same starting line.So what makes that athlete better than me, and then work towards that, and figure out what their weaknesses are too. And then also try to capitalise on that strategy.If you just stop at being frustrated, because someone's in front of you, you will never be in front of anybody, because you're too worried about what they're doing.With Bolt, I had to create a strategy where I was putting more emphasis on my top end speed later in the race, instead of trying to get out from the pack.Q. And what was your strategy when it came to Usain Bolt?Gatlin: With him, I had to create a whole different strategy. 99% of the world, I could run a certain way that I had been running through my career. But with him, I had to create a strategy where I was putting more emphasis on my top end speed later in the race, instead of trying to get out from the pack.Usain's key point is the last 20 meters of the race. That's where we know that he shines at most. So I learned along the way, trial and error, that I had to combat that. I had to go out there and say 'no matter if I'm in front or behind, the race really lies in the last 20 meters.'Q. How do we move on from Usain Bolt? How does athletics survive his retirement?Gatlin: The sport is self sustaining. It's not like, there's not going to be other characters. People were watching before Bolt was Bolt. When Bolt came along, he brought something different, a different flavour, gave a sense of excitement to the sport.So there will be more. It may not be just like how Usain did it. But it'll be something that'll draw the attention of the fans and the audience. It takes a little time, a little patience. You have to realise that these athletes are training day in day out, they're under a lot of pressure. They want to be the best for themselves but also for their sponsors, family and their country. So watching them grow, take it all in, because that's a rare moment as well, when you see the growth of an athlete right in front of you.Q. How do you grow athletics? How do you make it beyond just the four years of Olympics?Gatlin: Invest more into the athletes' characters. Average audience probably knows, two to three runners out of a race. You have five-six other runners that they probably don't even know who it is.I think the sport should be able to do the athletes more justice and be able to create better character development. So the audience can be more invested in those runners.If the audience already knows two to three athletes, highlight the ones who show true potential. Bear in mind, everyone loves an underdog. Everyone loves to say that 'I was there in the beginning'. Those are one of the key elements to be able to make a sport grow and be loved and adored by the audience.Q. India has had a long line of great athletes. Now we have an Olympic gold medallist (Neeraj Chopra). How much of a difference does it make for the youngsters?Gatlin: Inspiration. Perfect example, Usain. Before he came along, Jamaica had great sprinters but he stepped it up to another level. It was inspirational. A lot of other athletes and sprinters thought they could do the same thing.And that's the same case in point in this situation. Now you have an Olympic gold medalist in javelin, he has done something that no one in the history of India has done. But it has sparked inspiration for the next generation to believe that they can be another javelin thrower or even steeplechase runner or a long jumper or a triple jumper.Look to the other athletes, find inspiration, grow from there. Young athletes look up to the older athletes, and the older athletes have the obligation to show them clarity to be the best they can be not only for themselves, but for the country.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
