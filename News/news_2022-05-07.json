During the 51st match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, Gujarat Titans (GT) Southpaw batter Sai Sudharsan had to head back towards the pavilion courtesy of him getting Out Hit Wicket against the Mumbai Indians (MI). It all happened on the last delivery of the 16th Over being bowled by Kieron Pollard, while GT were en route to the target of 178 runs handed by the MI. Known for taking the pace off his deliveries via the off-cutters, Pollard, while bowling one, banged the ball short outside the off-stump of the left-handed Sudharsan. In his bid to pull the delivery with all his might, the 20-year-old went through with his short too early, as all he could manage was to swing his bat into thin air. However, in the process he got one of his hand off the grip with his body going off-balance and the bat ultimately hitting the stumps. pic.twitter.com/bNYJDcY10q ‚Äî Jemi_forlife (@jemi_forlife) May 6, 2022 The aforementioned mode of dismissal in Cricket is known as the Hit Wicket.

There are in fact, many unfortunate ways with which a batter can be ruled Out as Hit Wicket.

We slid into a booth at Wagner‚Äôs Pharmacy, a century-old place in Louisville‚Äôs South End that has transitioned over the years into a no-frills diner and gift shop. It is located across the street from Churchill Downs, feeding horsemen and racing fans soup and sandwiches and eggs and bacon. The place is a shrine to the sport, and to the Kentucky Derby specifically. This was the perfect‚Äîand perfectly cheeky‚Äîlocation to discuss Bingham‚Äôs new book, My Old Kentucky Home: The Astonishing Life and Reckoning of an Iconic American Song . It is an unflinching, brilliantly written study of the song that is synonymous with the Derby‚Äîthe one that will bring as many as 150,000 horse racing fans to their feet at Churchill on Saturday, many with tears in their eyes, as they boozily sing along to Stephen Foster‚Äôs 1853 tune. How many of those 150,000 know that ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù is steeped in racism? Whitewashed and inauthentically presented as Southern sentimentalism? Packaged as a paean to soft-edged nostalgia, when in reality its lyrics tell a tale of a slave being taken from his family and sold downriver to die on a sugarcane plantation? It's not just that racist terms for Black people had to be changed to ‚Äúpeople‚Äù in the latter half of the 20th century, in varying stages by various institutions, to make the singing more palatable. It‚Äôs not just the second and third verses, rarely sung, that paint an increasingly bleak picture of a displaced slave‚Äôs existence. It‚Äôs more than that. It‚Äôs everything else that the song became: a mainstay of minstrel shows produced and performed by white people in blackface, a symbol of the romanticized ‚ÄúLost Cause‚Äù version of the Confederacy, a one-size-fits-all prop for patriotism, and the underpinning of a Kentucky state park and tourist attraction based almost entirely on fraudulent narrative. Despite the song‚Äôs controversial lyrics, Churchill Downs continues to have it be part of its Kentucky Derby pageantry. Jamie Rhodes/USA TODAY Sports Read Bingham‚Äôs book, and some Derby goers may never stand and sing ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù again. The 58-year-old Louisville native, historian, author and lecturer at Bellarmine University certainly won‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it can be wrong to love a song, but I do believe we commit wrongs when we do not understand what we claim to love,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúRefusing to look closely at uncomfortable aspects of history has hurt this nation and may be its undoing. ‚Ä¶ Nearly 170 years ago, Foster copyrighted Black loss for white pleasure, comfort, and distraction. Over time, American society erected ‚ÄòMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äô as a sonic monument‚Äîimpressive, opaque, and also contested‚Äîto white feeling and white forgetting, to a nation‚Äôs own segregated memory.‚Äù That is the largely ignored baggage weighing upon the official Kentucky state song, and its inextricable tie to the state‚Äôs signature cultural/sporting event. The fact that is being brought to our attention by a woman with the last name ‚ÄúBingham‚Äù adds another layer of resonance. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it can be wrong to love a song, but I do believe we commit wrongs when we do not understand what we claim to love.‚Äù ‚Äî Emily Bingham The Binghams are one of the most prominent families in Louisville history. Three generations of Binghams ran a local media empire, with controlling ownership of The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times newspapers, two radio stations and a TV station. The quality of the journalism and the civic pride in those media outlets were both high. (Disclosure: I worked for The Courier-Journal for 17 years, but did not start there until after the Binghams sold the paper to Gannett.) The media empire was dissolved in the 1980s, but the family name still carries cachet locally. For a scion of one Louisville institution to take on another Louisville institution (Churchill Downs and the Derby) is an eyebrow raiser. But it‚Äôs in line with the Bingham family‚Äôs progressive newspapering, and with a years-long inability to reconcile Kentucky‚Äôs continued embrace of a song about a terrible period in U.S. history. ‚ÄúIn South Africa they don‚Äôt sing songs about apartheid before a cricket game,‚Äù Bingham says. ‚ÄúIn Germany they don‚Äôt sing songs about the Holocaust before a soccer match. How did it come to have this kind of weight in our sport and our state?‚Äù The answer is a progressive layering of falsehoods, sidesteps, rationalizations and capitulations to capitalism. Foster, considered by many to be the father of American pop music but struggling badly to make a living at the time, produced a catchy melody and wrote lyrics derived from the novel, Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin . The song became a fixture of traveling minstrel shows, wherein white actors performed demeaning Black stereotypes that somehow were hailed as ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù depictions. After the Civil War, part of the false interpretation and marketing of the song was the notion that slaves were happy in their station and grateful to their benevolent white owners. Thus, in the repurposing of Foster‚Äôs song, the slave sold downriver missed his carefree existence in Kentucky. This was an element of the post-Reconstruction softening of what the Confederacy was and what it stood for, part of redirecting memory toward the ‚ÄúLost Cause‚Äù and away from the reality of America‚Äôs Original Sin. Later in the country‚Äôs history, the song was expropriated altogether as white Old South experience. Idyllic plantation life was the presumptive backdrop, which gained traction in part thanks to the extraordinary creative license taken with My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown, Ky. The tourist attraction once sold the demonstrably false story line that Foster wrote ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù there at the restored Federal Hill mansion, where it‚Äôs more likely the Pittsburgh native spent no more than a few hours of his adult life in the state, and that stopover was 50 miles away in Louisville. Amid all the misunderstanding and misrepresentation, Bingham‚Äôs goal is to put a light of truth on what the song was. She wants readers to understand how it is part of a cultural patchwork that has deeply troubled Blacks‚Äîand Black Kentuckians, specifically. ‚ÄúWhat I would love this book to do is to take something that is in so many people‚Äôs hearts, that they have positive feelings about, and understand that those feelings are just the tip of a systemic iceberg of things we don‚Äôt realize that have been contributing‚Äîover years, over generations‚Äîto a continuation of inequity,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThis is a microcosmic example of one song being systematized and put on a pedestal in a way we enshrine something that‚Äôs hurtful and a story that doesn‚Äôt tell us who we are. We have to keep peeling those layers back. We have to acknowledge things that have happened.‚Äù Emily Bingham‚Äôs book studies the song that is synonymous with the Kentucky Derby: ‚ÄòMy Old Kentucky Home.‚Äô Courtesy of Emily Bingham Circling back to the Kentucky Derby: Matt Winn, the irrepressible marketer who helped turn Churchill into a cathedral of American sport, first linked the Derby and ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù in a powerful partnership in 1931. The song was nearly 80 years old then, but it gained fresh currency as the Derby became one of the signature sporting events of spring. Since then, the bonds between horse race and song have deepened. In 2020 in the immediate aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and in a city torn asunder after the death of Breonna Taylor, the Kentucky Derby was postponed to Labor Day weekend by the coronavirus pandemic. Given the context of the time, Bingham was hopeful Churchill Downs would choose that moment to not play ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù before the Derby. The racetrack chose a different path‚Äîkeeping the song but having it played by a bugler in front of a near-empty grandstand, with virtually no one there to sing the troubling lyrics. Churchill has made several public efforts to promote greater diversity and inclusion in horse racing. It wasn‚Äôt always in need of improvement in that area‚Äîthe sport was dominated by Black jockeys in the late 1800s, when the Derby was in its early years. But today, Black participation is scant. Among the initiatives was an announcement this week that Churchill and the Kentucky government are partnering with the Ed Brown Society, which promotes opportunities for people of color to participate in the racing industry through jobs and internships. The financial commitment is a tangible step, but don‚Äôt expect it to be accompanied by a symbolic disassociation with ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the state song,‚Äù Churchill Downs Incorporated CEO Bill Carstanjen says. ‚ÄúIt has been for over 100 years. It‚Äôs overwhelmingly supported by our fans. It‚Äôs part of the tradition, part of the fabric of the event. We plan to continue playing it with our signature event.‚Äù Emily Bingham isn‚Äôt attending this year‚Äôs race in person, opting instead to watch at home with her 10-year-old niece. She will not be standing when ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù is played.","pubDate":"2022-05-06 16:33:33","image_url":"http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MjkyMzM1NzY1Mzk4ODgy/usatsi_10045158.jpg","source_id":"si","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: 'Pollard ka replacement tayyar hai', Twitter lauds Tim David's blistering knock against GT","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ipl-2022-pollard-ka-replacement-tayyar-hai-twitter-lauds-tim-davids-blistering-knock-against-gt-10641401.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: 'Pollard ka replacement tayyar hai', Twitter lauds Tim David's blistering knock against GT","content":"Mumbai Indians' Tim David set the Brabourne Stadium on fire as he hammered a 21-ball 44 to propel MI to 177/6 in the 51st match of IPL 2022 between MI and Gujarat Titans.Striding in at 119/4 after Kieron Pollard's dismissal, David got Mumbai back on track with a blistering knock.

Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma appears to have found some form after an elongated rough patch in the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League. Sharma, 35, had scored 155 runs in nine innings at an average and strike rate of 17.22 and 123.01 respectively in this season before frequently hitting boundaries in their 10th IPL 2022 match against Gujarat Titans at the Brabourne Stadium. A contest between the top and bottom-ranked team at the points table was started by Gujarat captain Hardik Pandya inviting Mumbai in to bat first after winning the toss. In spite of losing nine matches this season, MI stuck with their opening pair yet again to witness Sharma calling the shots against the likes of Mohammed Shami and Alzarri Joseph. It was on the first two deliveries off the second over that Sharma hit consecutive boundaries off Joseph to become an instant source of amazement for the fans. Sharma, who hit a six on the last delivery of the same over, ramped Shami in the following over for another eye-catching six. Joseph, who had made his IPL debut for Indians back in the day, continued to leak boundaries against his former captain as Sharma hit two more fours in the fourth over. Ranveer Singh IPL team Sharma putting up a show at the Cricket Club of India earned him applause from ace actor Ranveer Singh, who is present at the venue for this match. on the pitch & ‚Ñù in the stand! ‡§´‡•Å‡§≤ ‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à! #OneFamily #DilKholKe #MumbaiIndians #GTvMI @RanveerOfficial pic.twitter.com/Ug9ZCZFxY2 ‚Äî Mumbai Indians (@mipaltan) May 6, 2022 , ? #GTvMI | #AavaDe pic.twitter.com/S0ceEZwSYA ‚Äî Gujarat Titans (@gujarat_titans) May 6, 2022 Ranveer Singh is celebrating all Rohit shot like us, he is a big Mumbai Indians and Rohit fan pic.twitter.com/CPtvp5zfZY ‚Äî Jyran (@Jyran45) May 6, 2022 ¬† The post Ranveer Singh IPL team: Rohit Sharma cheered by Ranveer Singh cricket match Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians at Brabourne Stadium appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-05-06 14:46:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Explained: What is Boris Becker guilty of and where will he be jailed?","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/explained-what-is-boris-becker-guilty-of-and-where-will-he-be-jailed-10641841.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Explainers"],"video_url":null,"description":"Explained: What is Boris Becker guilty of and where will he be jailed?","content":"Boris Becker was one of the finest finds of tennis back in the 80s when he shook the tennis world by winning the coveted Wimbledon trophy at just 17. However, after over 35 years ‚Äì in which he won six Grand Slams, then coached Novak Djokovic after a famous commentary stint with BBC ‚Äì the retired German star will be mostly and infamously be remembered for how he messed it up off the court as he is sentenced to jail after being found guilty in his bankruptcy case in 2017.How a young Boris Becker rose to prominence Becker's meteoric rise in the tennis world dates back to 1985 when he won the Wimbledon only to retain it the next year. His exploits soon earned him the nickname ‚ÄòBoom Boom‚Äô at the All England Club due to his fast serve and the young German only grew stronger by winning the Major on the grass for the third time in 1989. Continuing with his great form while rubbing shoulders with greats such as Ivan Lendl, and John McEnroe among others, Becker later won the US Open that year as well.French Open was the only court where he didn‚Äôt taste success (three semi-final appearances) but he did win the Australian Open twice in 1991 and 1996. His 1991 triumph in Melbourne also took him to the top of the rankings for the first time in his career.By 1996 Becker struggled to maintain his form at the top and preferred playing Australian Open and Wimbledon for the rest of his tennis career but didn‚Äôt see much success except for his last Major title in Melbourne that year. He finally called time on his career in 1999 after winning 49 singles titles and amassing a career-saving of a whopping $50 million (Rs 384 crore).Post-retirement, he became a decorated commentator with BBC before returning to the court in 2013 as World No.1 Djokovic‚Äôs coach. The duo won six Grand Slams together before parting ways in 2016.He also made headlines for his tangled private life since he retired from playing -- including a daughter conceived in a brief but now famous encounter with a Russian model at a London restaurant.When did he go bankrupt and what caused it? The German filed for bankruptcy in 2017 as he owed private bank Arbuthnot Latham around $4.6 million (Rs 35.37 crore approximately) for buying a property in Spain and defaulted on the repayment by over two years. He also urged the bank to give him a grace period of four weeks before filing a lawsuit against him as he intended to sell the property for repayment. His request, however, was denied by the bank. The failure of repayment to Arbuthnot Latham wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident of his downfall.His autobiography, released in 2003 by the title 'The Player', gave the public a peek into Becker's extravagant lifestyle that involved a string of female conquests.In fact, in 2002 a Munich court sentenced Becker to a two-year suspended prison sentence and fined him for tax evasion for an amount estimated up to ¬£10 million (Rs 90.95 crore). This came right after the divorce with his first wife Barbara in 2001 after he was accused of infidelity following his infamous encounter with a Russian woman which made headlines in 1999 as she conceived a daughter. The divorce, and his costly lifestyle, took a serious toll on his career savings.Becker then went on to marry his long-time girlfriend and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg in 2010 before the marriage hit rock bottom followed by separation in 2018.What was he accused of by the prosecution?After being declared bankrupt in 2017, the prosecution alleged that Becker has been dishonest in giving details of his assets, including a failure to reveal a declaration of debt worth $866,500 (Rs 6.66 crore) and shares in a tech firm. He was also accused of concealing details of properties worth $2.3 million (Rs 17.68 crore) and the trophies he won during his tennis career.‚ÄúIt is the prosecution case ... that in various ways he effectively hid from, or made unavailable to, those responsible for identifying the assets,\" said prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley. ‚ÄúThe prosecution say Mr. Becker did this both before and after the date of his bankruptcy agreement by not disclosing, not providing, or delivering up, or removing assets or things of value.‚ÄùWhat efforts did Becker make for repayment of the huge debt? Becker made an attempt to gather funds by holding an auction that sold his trophies and kits from the playing days. The memorabilia included his 1989 US Open trophy, which was the most expensive purchase at $185,735. In all, he put 82 items for sale and it fetched him $920,000 (Rs 7.07 crore approx.). The amount was deemed futile in comparison to the debt of $4.6 million.What was he finally convicted for?Becker was convicted on four charges under the Insolvency act by the court as he was found guilty of illicitly transferring large amounts of money to other accounts and hiding assets after he was declared bankrupt. This included a transfer of a large amount from his business accounts to other accounts, including that of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Lily. The jury did acquit him on 20 other counts, including concealment of trophies he won during his playing days.What will be the quantum of his incarceration and where will Becker serve it? Judge Deborah Taylor handed down a sentence of two and a half years of jail term for Becker and the German will serve half the sentence before he is eligible for parole. Becker is serving the quantum of his punishment at HMP Wandsworth Prison, which is an overcrowed category B prison in the UK and goes by the name Wanno. It is ironically located just 3.2 km from the All England Club.What awaits Becker after serving his sentence?There's no end to agony for the German tennis star as reports have emerged that he could be deported from the UK after serving his sentence as he doesn't have British citizenship.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
