Evans and Brady have only been playing together for about one and a half seasons, but that’s been enough time for Evans to realize just what you’re getting when you play with Tom Brady. Evans has been one of Brady’s top targets in their time together along with receiver Chris Godwin, hauling in a 1,000 yard season last year and on pace to do the same this year too. Chris Godwin has been the Buccaneers’ top receiver this year, but that doesn’t take away from Evans’ immense value. Evans’ big frame and excellent hands make him an elite red-zone target. He has 10 touchdowns on the year already with five games left to play.

Well, you’ve probably heard all about it, but he’s the all time leader in passing yards, both in the regular season and playoffs, he’s the all time leader in passing touchdowns, and his seven Super Bowl victories are more than any NFL team. His combined regular season and postseason passing yard total also exceeds 100,000 (counting college), the only player to do so. He’s passed for 82,975 yards in the regular season and 12,449 in the playoffs, and 5,351 yards in college for a total of 100,775 yards. The next closest is Drew Brees at 97,516 yards. That gap is incredible, and it’s only set to get bigger and bigger as Brady has made no clear intentions of when he’s going to retire. The Buccaneers quarterback just keeps on going and going. He was also recently named the Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year. Mike Evans made sure to give his Hall of Fame quarterback his dues for the award and also spoke up on the kind of teammate Brady is. “He puts in the work, and he makes sure we’re all putting in the work,” said Evans. “You can’t half-a** anything with Tom, and that’s why he’s been so great.” MIKE EVANS IS NOW YOUR BUCS ALL-TIME LEADING TOUCHDOWN SCORER pic.twitter.com/MGX5437HF7 — PFF Fantasy Football (@PFF_Fantasy) November 23, 2021 Tom Brady currently leads the league in passing yards and touchdown and has the Buccaneers at 9-3, making him the favorite for the NFL MVP at this point in the year.

Warner defends the second well and even looks for a single. Woakes is then too straight and Warner nerdles him wide of mid-on to get off strike. Harris is on-strike - I’m not sure if this is new but he appears to have developed a little back-and-across hop-step trigger movement. It’s less prominent for the shuffle than it is for the jump. Whatever the case, he leaves the remaining few. There seems enough movement for an edge. Can England find it? 2nd over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 1, Harris 3) It’s Robinson at the other end and he’s beating Harris outside off immediately. Perfect length, perfect shape. Harris is inside the line of it but that’s exactly where Robinson will want to stay. The second is in the same spot - it takes the outside half of Harris’s blade, neither forward nor back. England have three slips and a gully, and Robinson beats Harris again . The Australian opener is playing down the line but this is encouraging for the Ashes debutant. The only gripe? it’s slow: high 120s at this point. It’s a maiden to finish, an excellent start for Robinson. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 1, Harris 3) First ball, Warner pushes it into a gap at cover and hares off, he’s home safe, Stokes shies at the stumps and it strikes Warner, but no harm done. So Warner’s busy early. It’s Harris next, and he’s on the back foot to Woakes who’s a fraction short, though the carry looks good. Woakes adjusts, pitches up, and Harris drives through cover for two. The final ball is overpitched and Harris pushes it to cover for another run. The players are out there. It looks sunny, excellent for batting, the Queensland-coloured seats are popping. I expect Australia to assess the pitch, and if true enough, to counterpunch. Woakes is at the top of his mark... An early start today, we’re underway in two minutes. Some messages coming in: Conor writes: “Hi Sam, felt a Christmas eve-like excitement last night and decided to pull an all-nighter with my assignments and BT sport open side by side. Booked a study space in the silent study room, and was practically bouncing in my seat for the first ball. No word of a lie that I let out an expletive that came from the depths of my soul. My whole life this last three months has been one big head tilt into the offside. My hopes, dreams, eudemonic wellbeing all came undone in the space of one leg stump half volley. “how good”. Not very.” I’m sorry brother. And Brendan via Twitter: “It may be a sunny warm morning perfect for batting, but England have 2 bowlers with a total of over 1100 test wickets, in their squad. That levels it up surely...oh wait.Robinson has to have a miracle innings today.” There’s a fair bit of consternation over the omissions of both Anderson and Broad. I was of the same view as Pat Cummins (why wouldn’t you be at this point?) that I expected they’d pick one. But I thought the selections were positive and proactive. We’ll soon find out if they were, and retroactively adjust our opinions accordingly. Prominent Australian broadcaster Gerard Whateley is grilling CA CEO Nick Hockley on-air before play for SEN Radio. Though he doesn’t elicit much. A crass summary as I see it: Where will the fifth Test be played? Still thinking about it. Did the Prime Minister’s intervention in favour of Hobart carry any weight? Yes it’s a prestigious Test, isn’t it? Are you happy with how CA handled the Tim Paine controversy? I respect Tim. Will you reconsider David Warner’s leadership ban? No one has raised it with us. And here’s Barney Ronay on Josh Hazlewood... While you wait (and contemplate the inherent fairness of cricketing conditions), here are a couple of typically excellent pieces following yesterday’s events. This was Geoff capturing the vibe inside the Gabba... More weather talk. It’s important to gather more than one source - here is our colleague Geoff Lemon on the ground in Brisbane.

Obviously. pic.twitter.com/ofWu3Bn7Ju Good morning, afternoon, evening everyone, Wherever you land in the Ashes divide, yesterday was nothing short of visceral. A day of explosion and drama, unevenly distributed. After rolling England for 147 on a green one with cloud overhead, it feels much of Australia already senses a drubbing in the offing. Of course, this is how we do things here, building then riding the wave momentum – slightly confected – feeding the stereotype of a snarling Australian unit manhandling a feeble England outfit on a dangerous Gabba wicket. All of a sudden, the omission of Anderson and Broad is conflated with a poor batting display – all of it endemic of a touring party for whom “the wheels have fallen off”. And so on. All of this before England has had a chance to bowl. Ultimately, Australia assuredly exploited some favourable conditions yesterday, and England will have its chance today. The series is essentially two sessions old, and chest-out Australians are only ever a problem or two away from trouble. All eyes will be on Woakes and Robinson, the favoured seam-up metronomes who’ll be counted on to match the unerring lines, lengths and angles of Cummins and Starc. For all the noise and pageantry yesterday, it was the relentlessness of the skipper and former vice that wrought the damage. Should Woakes and Robinson be able to do similar, with catches held, England will wrestle their way back in. No doubt Australia will be brighter and bolder with the bat, so the margins already feel small. I’ve not done this round for a little while, so be gentle.

Clarke though added that if they are both fit enough to play it was a “horrible selection”. “You talk about the mental side of the game, just the fact Broady has had Davey Warner’s measure,” he added. “Can you imagine the confidence Davey Warner has now, knowing his number one concern for the series isn’t there? I could honestly not believe Broady wasn’t in the XI, unless him and Anderson are injured and they just don’t want to tell us.” Australia will look to capitalise on its scintillating bowling performance when it starts with the bat on day two of the Ashes against England at the Gabba. Play was called off after tea on day one of the first Test, but not before Australia, led by new captain Pat Cummins, bowled the visitors out for 147 - the lowest first innings total of an Ashes series since 1997.

I think it’s the wrong call because when you think about those guys being the guys who would get the most use out of this wicket. Don’t save them for the pink ball Test. This would have been a good wicket. “I think there has to be a bit more behind the scenes than what we’re hearing...” The reaction from over in England has certainly been fierce , with Michael Vaughan labelling it “the worst opening day in Ashes history” in a column for The Telegraph . “It’s sad to say after being bowled out for 147 on the opening day of a Test series, but the batting from England didn’t surprise me,” he wrote. “When there’s no movement or spin the batting line-up is dangerous. But whenever there’s movement or bounce or spin this England team haven’t batted well at all.It’s been the same for a few years now. “The batting unit haven’t been able to cope with any conditions that are not perfect. They haven’t been able to soak up the pressure of a moving ball and avoid losing wickets in clusters. “Yes, the bowling from Australia was very good. But ultimately when a team continues to collapse you have to question the technique and, more importantly, the mentality of the batmen.” STEAMROLLED: Every English wicket | 03:06 READ MORE The tactical ‘stroke of genius’ and record spell that silenced a big Cummins doubt ‘Missed a trick’: Aussie greats rip into England’s woeful Warner blunder ‘Turned uphill battle into Everest’: Ashes debacle sends fuming England fans off to bed Australia will be hoping for as fierce a start at the crease as the side enjoyed with the ball, which saw an under-fire Mitchell Starc (2-35) send opener Rory Burns walking with the first ball of the series.

While the two main teams are busy battling it out in the Ashes, it's now time for the second-string Australian and English sides to lock horns. Both teams have several brilliant players, including the likes of Mitchell Marsh, Ashton Agar and Tom Abell, who would love to prove their worth in the unofficial Test. AU-A XI Matt Renshaw, Henry Hunt, Bryce Street, Nic Maddinson, Mitchell Marsh, Jos Inglis, Ashton Agar, Michael Neser, Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Mark Steketee EN-A XI Alex Lees, Harry Brook, Robert Yates, James Bracey, Tom Abell, Ben Foakes, Josh Bohannon, Matt Parkinson, Mason Crane, Saqib Mahmood, Liam Norwell AU-A vs EN-A, One-off Unofficial Test Date and Time: 9th December, 2021, 5:30 AM IST Venue: Ian Healy Oval, Brisbane The pitch at the Ian Healy Oval in Brisbane is expected to assist the fast bowlers, who will enjoy the bounce and carry the surface has to offer. Batters will have their work cut out and need to be at their very best. Wicketkeeper Josh Inglis is a talented wicketkeeper-batter who will be a good pick for your fantasy team. Batters Nic Maddinson has impressed thoroughly in red-ball cricket, having amassed 6245 runs in 97 first-class matches. He is expected to strengthen the Australian middle order. Harry Brook will be the player to watch out for as far as England are concerned. He boasts a great record, with Brook scoring more than 2000 runs in 47 first-class games. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh was the star of the show for Australia in the final of the T20 World Cup. The all-rounder has plenty of experience in international cricket and adds a lot of value to the Australian team. Marsh has scored 5256 runs and picked up 161 wickets in 103 first-class games.

Having announced the 18-member Indian team Test squad for the tour of South Africa set to commence from December 26 at Centurion, the BCCI have also raised quite a many eyebrows by announcing Rohit Sharma as the team’s new ODI captain, after already taking over as the team’s T20I captain last month. Virat Kohli, thus, has decided to end his stint as Team India captain in White ball Cricket altogether. The move comes as a surprise given the board has not yet come up with the 3-match ODI squad for the tour, but have gone all the way to disclose who the next skipper of the side would be. Moreover, the richest Cricket board has not come up with reason(s) mentioning what propelled them to arrive at the decision. There is no word from Kohli either. This comes as a surprise because, Kohli, at the time of him announcing his decision to quit as T20I captain for both his franchise RCB and Team India, had explicitly mentioned that he would continue to lead the side in the ODIs and Tests. On the flip side, given that it was his decision to quit T20I captaincy, Kohli perhaps had to make up his mind regarding giving up the ODI captaincy as well, as perhaps the idea of split captaincy within the two White ball formats would have made little sense to him. Thank you Captain @imVkohli for leading #TeamIndia through an emphatic and aggressive era in white-ball cricket! Your brand of cricket will be a template for the future to follow. #PlayBold #ThankYouCaptainKohli pic.twitter.com/BxtmWcklT5 — Royal Challengers Bangalore (@RCBTweets) December 8, 2021 Virat Kohli ODI and Test captaincy record ODI Virat Kohli has the best winning percentage of 70.43 amongst all the former captains of the Indian Cricket team. Kohli has led India in 95 ODIs, winning 65 of them while losing 27 matches. Talking about his dominance, under him Team India has lost only 4 bilateral ODI series out of 19, winning a total of 15 of them. At home, Kohli has lost just a single ODI series out of 9 in totality. During Kohli’s tenure, Team India have won the bilateral ODI series in Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe. As far as the ICC tournaments are concerned, the 33-year-old has led India to two ICC events. They finished runner-ups in the 2017 ICC Champions trophy losing against Pakistan in the finals, and two years hence, reached the semi-finals in the 2019 50-Over World Cup. Kohli has batted at a ridiculous average of 72.65 in the 95 ODIs he has lead team India in. During this phase (as captain), he has struck a total of 21 centuries (off 43) while amassing more than 5000 runs. Only former Australia cricket team captain Ricky Ponting (22) has registered more hundreds as captain in ODIs than Kohli. Tests In Test matches, where Kohli has been leading Team India since 2014, the 33-year-old boasts of a win percentage of 59.09. He has led Team India in a total of 66 Tests till date, and has won 39 of them, losing 16, while drawing 11. He has a healthy Win/Loss ratio of 2.43. Off 109 innings (across 66 matches) he has played in Tests as captain, Kohli has amassed a total of 5703 runs at an average of 55.37. He has smashed 20 centuries and 17 half-centuries in the process.         The post Virat Kohli ODI and Test captaincy record: What is Virat Kohli’s record as ODI and Test captain of Team India? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-08 18:40:01","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Cummins leads the way as Oz skittle out England for 147","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/cummins-leads-the-way-as-oz-skittle-out-england-for-147-718780","keywords":["Sports,Today NewsPaper,Cricket"],"creator":["The Hans India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia captain Pat Cummins made a cracking start to his captaincy stint with a five-wicket haul as the hosts skittled out England for just 147 on day one of first Ashes Test at The Gabba here on Wednesday.","content":"Cummins leads the way as Oz skittle out England for 147Cummins leads the way as Oz skittle out England for 147Brisbane: Australia captain Pat Cummins made a cracking start to his captaincy stint with a five-wicket haul as the hosts skittled out England for just 147 on day one of first Ashes Test at The Gabba here on Wednesday.At tea, Australia were the happier side of the two, with all pacers ending with wickets against their name.

Playing his first Test as the newly inducted skipper of the Australian Test side, Pat Cummins (13.1-3-38-5) then went on a carnage, bagging his sixth five-wicket haul in Tests. He along with Hazlewood (13-4-42-2) kept inducing the outside edges of the English top-order to reduce them to 5/61 at one point in time. A half-century partnership for the 6th wicket between Jos Buttler (39 off 58) and Ollie Pope (35 off 79) meant England huffed and puffed towards the ultimate total of 147/10 in 50.1 Overs in their first innings.

The BCCI has finally announced an 18-member squad for Team India’s upcoming tour of South Africa. The squad has only been announced for the three-match Test series set to commence with the Boxing Day Test at Centurion’s Supersport Park. As far as the ODIs are concerned, the squad for the same would be announced on a later date. While some prominent names have failed to make the cut mostly due to injury, the biggest news which has invited debates and discussions galore amongst the fans and experts of the game is regarding Virat Kohli, who has been replaced by Rohit Sharma as the skipper of Team India in ODIs as well. With the ODI squad yet to be the announced, the move by BCCI to make the decision public, and on top of that without any statement of clarity from either Kohli or the board on reason(s) for the move rightly invites room for criticism. Rohit Sharma new ODI captain: Why Virat Kohli is leaving captaincy in the ODIs? It is worth mentioning that Kohli, at the time of him announcing his decision to quit as T20I captain for both his franchise RCB and Team India, had explicitly mentioned that he would continue to lead the side in the ODIs and Tests. However, as per earlier reports from November this year, The BCCI wanted to relieve Kohli of the captaincy burden in limited-overs cricket so that he can focus on his batting and return to his dominant form. But, if the above reasoning of the BCCI makes little sense if one looks at the numbers. Kohli has batted at a ridiculous average of 72.65 in the 95 ODIs he has lead team India in. During this phase (as captain), he has struck a total of 21 centuries (0ff 43) while amassing more than 5000 runs. On the flip side, given that it was his decision to quit T20I captaincy, Kohli perhaps had to make up his mind regarding giving up the ODI captaincy as well, as perhaps the idea of split captaincy within the two White ball formats would have made little sense to him. This split in the captaincy could well be a master stroke because it could liberate Virat Kohli but it is critical that it is managed with sensitivity & care. Rohit and Virat are proud, mature Indian players first and I am certain, they will handle the shared responsibility well — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) December 8, 2021 Anyway, with the matter still ambiguous, coupled with the absence of statements of clarity regarding the reasoning for the decision arrival point, one can only come up with conjectures. Having said that, the BCCI can certainly do better in terms of transparency before its biggest stakeholders- the fans.           The post Rohit Sharma new ODI captain: Why Virat Kohli is leaving captaincy in ODI for India? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2021-12-08 16:29:14","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Rohit Sharma Named India's White-ball Captain: Here's How The World Reacted - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvcm9oaXQtc2hhcm1hLW5hbWVkLWFzLWluZGlhcy1vZGktdDIwaS1jYXB0YWluLWhvdy10aGUtd29ybGQtcmVhY3RlZC0yNjQyODM20gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9yb2hpdC1zaGFybWEtbmFtZWQtYXMtaW5kaWFzLW9kaS10MjBpLWNhcHRhaW4taG93LXRoZS13b3JsZC1yZWFjdGVkLTI2NDI4MzYvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Rohit Sharma Named India's White-ball Captain: Here's How The World Reacted  NDTVSports.comInjured Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel out of South Africa tour; Rohit Sharma named ODI captain | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzBreaking news live updates: BCCI announces 18-member squad for the upcoming 3-match Test series against South Africa  Times of IndiaRohit takes over from Kohli as ODI captain, replaces Rahane as Test vice-captain  ESPNcricinfoIND vs SA: India's Test Squad vs South Africa To Be Announced Soon; ODI Squad To Be Delayed - Reports  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2021-12-08 16:18:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Rohit's elevation signals significant development in Indian cricket","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/rohit-sharma-named-india-odi-captain-virat-kohli/article37902892.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["S.

Kohli led India in all three formats until the Twenty20 World Cup last month, after which he relinquished 20-overs captaincy which went to Rohit. Many expected Kohli, who remains the test captain, to lead India in the 50-overs World Cup on home soil in 2023 but the board opted for a single white-ball skipper. \"The All-India Senior Selection Committee ... decided to name Mr Rohit Sharma as the captain of the ODI & T20I teams going forward,\" board secretary Jay Shah said in a statement. Under Kohli, India reached the semi-finals of the 50-overs World Cup in 2019 but could not advance beyond the group stage at this year's T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. In further indication of Rohit's growing stature within the team, the 34-year-old also replaced fellow Mumbai player Ajinkya Rahane as vice-captain of the test side. Rahane is part of the 18-member squad that will travel to South Africa but must snap his woeful run of form to maintain his place in the side. Beginning on Dec. 26, India are scheduled to play three tests in South Africa, followed by three one-day internationals. Rohit, who was rested for the home series against New Zealand, returns to the test side, along with fellow opener KL Rahul, first-choice wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and fast bowlers Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. Opener Shubman Gill and spin-bowling all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel missed out with injuries. India test squad: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma (vice captain), KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj.

Meanwhile, the BCCI, who had been severely criticized by fans and experts for dropping Hanuma Vihari in the home series against New Zealand, have finally made amends to include him in the Test squad, after him exhibiting some decent run of form in the ongoing India A’s 3-match Test series against South Africa ‘A’. Ravindra Jadeja, Shubman Gill and Axar Patel miss out due to injuries In what has come as a serious blow to the Indian contingent, left-handed all rounders Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja have been ruled out of the tour due to injuries. Jadeja missed the second Test against New Zealand in Mumbai due to a swelling in the forearm. But, as per recent reports, he has had a ligament tear, which might take months to heal if he undergoes surgery. Axar, on the other hand, has reportedly suffered a stress fracture. Shubman Gill will, on the other hand miss the tour due to a shin injury which has resurfaced. He also had received some heavy blows during New Zealand’s first innings against India at Mumbai, and had come down the order, below Virat Kohli to bat in the second innings as against the opening slot.

It can be forgotten if you bat first and get it wrong but rarely if you bowl.\"While the outcome for Root was cruel, given that Australian captain Pat Cummins said he would've chosen to bat as well, that didn't spare the English skipper from criticism.\"Play what is in front of you,\" Scyld Berry wrote in The Telegraph.\"And a Test match can never be won in a session but it can be lost in one: another saying which is still valid even in this age of data. But Root seems to have ignored both of these eternal verities.\"Despite the criticism levelled at Root's call to bat first, another ex-England captain, Michael Atherton said \"definitive judgment must wait\".\"Root's justification — that the softer than usual pitch would dent, become quicker and therefore harder to bat on as the game progressed — demands our consideration and will only be proved right or wrong over the next few days. Still, at the close, he probably wished his time over again,\" Atherton wrote in The Times.\"There was certainly enough movement off the surface, combined with the heavy cloud cover, to have justified bowling. The psychology of the decision is fascinating and may have played its part. Bowl first and mess it up, and the captain takes the flak, as Hutton did and Hussain continues to do, even though it is almost two decades now since he sent Australia on their way in the 2002-03 series. It is the batsmen, not the captain, who get the blame if a captain bats first and it goes wrong.\"The Daily Mail's Lawrence Booth described Root's decision to bat first as \"bold\" and \"probably foolhardy\".\"There was only one way for England to lose the Test on the first day, and that was by batting in helpful conditions against Australia's world-class attack,\" he wrote.The other English decision, one which can't be pinned on Root alone, was the one to leave out both James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Berry called it \"colossally bad planning\".\"England's head coach Chris Silverwood had said that players in the Ashes series should not be expected to do something new, like make their Test debut,\" he wrote.\"And here we have [Chris] Woakes and [Ollie] Robinson taking the new ball for England for the first time together. Best of luck, lads.\"READ MORE: Robinson backed to turn first Test on its head by Aussie greatREAD MORE: What Steve Smith told Shane Warne after public criticismFormer England captain Michael Vaughan was similarly scathing of the English brains trust's decision to leave both veteran seamers out of the attack.\"They've had four years to plan, there have been no late injuries — we've known about Jofra Archer and Olly Stone for months, and everyone else is fit,\" he wrote in The Telegraph.\"You need combinations and camaraderie as a team and unit - knowing who bowls well together and when. And how can they have that when they've never bowled together?\"Broad had to play. He's fit and firing. What was the point of playing Broad and Jimmy Anderson for so many Tests together in the build-up to the Ashes if they weren't going to play at least one of them this Test? Why didn't they try, for a few Test matches over the last few years, an attack without Broad and Anderson? There's been many of us crying out for it. But for them both to be fit and not to play the first Test on a green top is staggering.\"\"To compound the sense of yet more Pommie haplessness at a ground where they have won twice in 20 attempts since the Second World War, the mid-afternoon drinks were carried on by Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, both said to be fit yet neither required – other than to mix the cordial,\" Booth wrote in the Daily Mail.\"If England, who wanted to find room for the left-arm spin of Jack Leach, really can afford to leave out 1,156 Test wickets' worth of experience and knowhow, then good luck to them.\"Once the play started, it took just one ball for Australia to get on top, with England opener Rory Burns inexplicably missing a half-volley on leg stump off Mitchell Starc.\"The first ball of the Ashes series set a wretched tone for England as they endured a depressingly familiar tough day at the Gabba that crushed spirits and derailed years of planning,\" wrote Nick Hoult in The Telegraph.\"Burns's legs were akimbo as he was bowled by Starc, providing a comic illustration of what happens when batsmen so short of match practice are thrust into batting first on a green pitch against such a top-class seam attack.\"The duck on Day 1 made it six in Burns' last 16 innings, and there are serious doubts over whether his unorthodox technique can survive on Australian pitches.\"Burns' tragicomic haplessness is the very image of England's self-sabotage,\" wrote The Telegraph's Chief Sports Writer, Oliver Brown.\"Burns' brain-fade will live in infamy. It was an unforgettable piece of sporting theatre.\"For an opener still struggling to justify his place, now with six ducks to his name in his 16 innings this year, it brought the grisliest humiliation.\"Nowhere was England's agony more graphically illustrated than in the plight of Burns. It is one of cricket's insoluble mysteries that Burns has amassed 31 Test caps for his country, given that he averages just 32: a figure that even Harmison, his fellow author of Brisbane calamity, has described as 'nowhere near good enough'.\"Hussain said Burns' dismissal was symptomatic of the left-hander being a nervous starter.\"The Surrey opener's frailty when under pressure is that his front foot goes across to the off side far too much,\" he wrote.\"Burns went so far across – the freeze frame at the moment Starc delivers the ball shows his front foot at least six inches from where it should be – he left his leg-stump exposed and immediately with that wicket the pressure was ramped up on England.\"\"The ugly duckling of our batting, Rory Burns, bowled around his legs was awful,\" former England opener Geoffrey Boycott said on a podcast for The Telegraph.\"It was as bad as Steve Harmison bowling the first ball of that Test match in Brisbane to Freddie Flintoff at second slip.\"You remember it? Yeah, none of us have forgotten it, and none of us will forget Rory Burns getting bowled around his legs first ball. You can get out, but there's ways of getting out.\"All in all, the opening day of the series could have not gone more differently for the two skippers, with Root's horror show at the coin toss followed up by his first duck of the calendar years.Meanwhile, Cummins became the first Aussie skipper to take a five-wicket haul on his Test captaincy debut in 127 years.\"The most important wicket, of course, was that of Root not just for this first Test but also the series,\" Hussain wrote.\"The England captain basically tried to remodel his game after the last Ashes because Cummins and Josh Hazlewood had got him out so many times.

Despite coming into the series as underdogs, the off-field drama in the Australian camp had given England some belief in the lead-up to the Gabba Test. Just a day into the series, a ruthless Australian side snatched that sense of belief right out of England's souls. AS IT HAPPENED: Ruthless Australia rolls England on opening day of the Ashes The trouble for England began before a single delivery was bowled, with captain Joe Root 's decision to bat first on a green top putting an undercooked batting line-up at the mercy of Australia's pace attack. Root's curious call at the coin toss immediately earned comparisons to former England skipper Nasser Hussain's infamous decision to bowl first in the opening Test of the 2002-03 series, one that England wound up losing 4-1. Hussain admitted he \"wanted Root, as an England fan, to lose the toss\". \"I could see the mind-games unfolding in front of me in the build-up to it,\" the former England captain wrote in his Daily Mail column. \"He would have known that idiots like me have bowled first at the Gabba and been remembered for it for the rest of their career. It can be forgotten if you bat first and get it wrong but rarely if you bowl.\" While the outcome for Root was cruel, given that Australian captain Pat Cummins said he would've chosen to bat as well, that didn't spare the English skipper from criticism. \"Play what is in front of you,\" Scyld Berry wrote in The Telegraph . \"And a Test match can never be won in a session but it can be lost in one: another saying which is still valid even in this age of data. But Root seems to have ignored both of these eternal verities.\" Despite the criticism levelled at Root's call to bat first, another ex-England captain, Michael Atherton said \"definitive judgment must wait\". \"Root's justification — that the softer than usual pitch would dent, become quicker and therefore harder to bat on as the game progressed — demands our consideration and will only be proved right or wrong over the next few days. Still, at the close, he probably wished his time over again,\" Atherton wrote in The Times . \"There was certainly enough movement off the surface, combined with the heavy cloud cover, to have justified bowling. The psychology of the decision is fascinating and may have played its part. Bowl first and mess it up, and the captain takes the flak, as Hutton did and Hussain continues to do, even though it is almost two decades now since he sent Australia on their way in the 2002-03 series. It is the batsmen, not the captain, who get the blame if a captain bats first and it goes wrong.\" The Daily Mail 's Lawrence Booth described Root's decision to bat first as \"bold\" and \"probably foolhardy\". \"There was only one way for England to lose the Test on the first day, and that was by batting in helpful conditions against Australia's world-class attack,\" he wrote. The other English decision, one which can't be pinned on Root alone, was the one to leave out both James Anderson and Stuart Broad . Berry called it \"colossally bad planning\". \"England's head coach Chris Silverwood had said that players in the Ashes series should not be expected to do something new, like make their Test debut,\" he wrote. \"And here we have [Chris] Woakes and [Ollie] Robinson taking the new ball for England for the first time together. Best of luck, lads.\" READ MORE: Robinson backed to turn first Test on its head by Aussie great READ MORE: What Steve Smith told Shane Warne after public criticism Former England captain Michael Vaughan was similarly scathing of the English brains trust's decision to leave both veteran seamers out of the attack. \"They've had four years to plan, there have been no late injuries — we've known about Jofra Archer and Olly Stone for months, and everyone else is fit,\" he wrote in The Telegraph . \"You need combinations and camaraderie as a team and unit - knowing who bowls well together and when. And how can they have that when they've never bowled together? \"Broad had to play. He's fit and firing. What was the point of playing Broad and Jimmy Anderson for so many Tests together in the build-up to the Ashes if they weren't going to play at least one of them this Test? Why didn't they try, for a few Test matches over the last few years, an attack without Broad and Anderson? There's been many of us crying out for it. But for them both to be fit and not to play the first Test on a green top is staggering.\" \"To compound the sense of yet more Pommie haplessness at a ground where they have won twice in 20 attempts since the Second World War, the mid-afternoon drinks were carried on by Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, both said to be fit yet neither required – other than to mix the cordial,\" Booth wrote in the Daily Mail . \"If England, who wanted to find room for the left-arm spin of Jack Leach, really can afford to leave out 1,156 Test wickets' worth of experience and knowhow, then good luck to them.\" Once the play started, it took just one ball for Australia to get on top, with England opener Rory Burns inexplicably missing a half-volley on leg stump off Mitchell Starc . \"The first ball of the Ashes series set a wretched tone for England as they endured a depressingly familiar tough day at the Gabba that crushed spirits and derailed years of planning,\" wrote Nick Hoult in The Telegraph . \"Burns's legs were akimbo as he was bowled by Starc, providing a comic illustration of what happens when batsmen so short of match practice are thrust into batting first on a green pitch against such a top-class seam attack.\" The duck on Day 1 made it six in Burns' last 16 innings, and there are serious doubts over whether his unorthodox technique can survive on Australian pitches. \"Burns' tragicomic haplessness is the very image of England's self-sabotage,\" wrote The Telegraph 's Chief Sports Writer, Oliver Brown. \"Burns' brain-fade will live in infamy. It was an unforgettable piece of sporting theatre. \"For an opener still struggling to justify his place, now with six ducks to his name in his 16 innings this year, it brought the grisliest humiliation. \"Nowhere was England's agony more graphically illustrated than in the plight of Burns. It is one of cricket's insoluble mysteries that Burns has amassed 31 Test caps for his country, given that he averages just 32: a figure that even Harmison, his fellow author of Brisbane calamity, has described as 'nowhere near good enough'.\" Hussain said Burns' dismissal was symptomatic of the left-hander being a nervous starter. \"The Surrey opener's frailty when under pressure is that his front foot goes across to the off side far too much,\" he wrote. \"Burns went so far across – the freeze frame at the moment Starc delivers the ball shows his front foot at least six inches from where it should be – he left his leg-stump exposed and immediately with that wicket the pressure was ramped up on England.\" \"The ugly duckling of our batting, Rory Burns, bowled around his legs was awful,\" former England opener Geoffrey Boycott said on a podcast for The Telegraph . \"It was as bad as Steve Harmison bowling the first ball of that Test match in Brisbane to Freddie Flintoff at second slip. \"You remember it? Yeah, none of us have forgotten it, and none of us will forget Rory Burns getting bowled around his legs first ball. You can get out, but there's ways of getting out.\" All in all, the opening day of the series could have not gone more differently for the two skippers, with Root's horror show at the coin toss followed up by his first duck of the calendar years. Meanwhile, Cummins became the first Aussie skipper to take a five-wicket haul on his Test captaincy debut in 127 years . \"The most important wicket, of course, was that of Root not just for this first Test but also the series,\" Hussain wrote. \"The England captain basically tried to remodel his game after the last Ashes because Cummins and Josh Hazlewood had got him out so many times. So for Australia to get him for a duck after all the success Root has had since then was massive. \"It was noticeable Cummins brought himself on the moment Root came to the crease because he has dismissed him seven times before in two Ashes series.\" \"Every England captain wants to start an Ashes series well, but for Root there were echoes of Andrew Flintoff, as captain, who fell for a duck in 2006-07,\" Atherton wrote.
