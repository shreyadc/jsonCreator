The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Beakley was settled out of court by CA, who sacked its long-term employee amid the fallout from Justin Langer’s resignation. Neither Beakley’s lawyer, or CA, were able to discuss the matter with the publication due to a confidentiality agreement. Watch Every Game of The 2022 Indian Premier League Finals on Kayo.

The Daily Telegraph reported at the time that players were angered by the decision, and may have questioned Oliver if it was a power move by CA to show who was in charge. It came at a time that questions were being asked over the amount of power players had after Langer was pushed aside at the request of some senior figures. Oliver reportedly proposed that Langer be awarded a two-year contract renewal, but he was only offered a six-month extension, which he turned down. Beakley’s departure followed that of Langer, and team manager Gavin Dovey.","pubDate":"2022-05-23 21:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SMA vs WAR Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Pondicherry T10 2022 Match 16","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/sma-vs-war-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-pondicherry-t10-2022-match-16?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Sahil Jain"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-23 19:10:57","image_url":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/03/938e2-16482333895985-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WT20 Challenge 2022: SPN vs TRL - Vastrakar scalps 4 wickets, Deol and Punia take brilliant catches; Watch","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/women-s-t20-challenge-2022-supernovas-vs-trailblazers-pooja-vastrakar-scalps-4-wickets-harleen-deol-and-priya-punia-take-brilliant-catches-watch-2022-05-24-778826","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pooja Vastrakar scalped four wickets, giving just 12 runs in her best haul in T20 cricket as Supernovas registered a 49-run win over Trailblazers in the opening match of the Women's T20 Challenge on Monday.

During the first match of the ongoing fourth season of Women’s T20 Challenge between Supernovas and Trailblazers in Pune, Supernovas beat Trailblazers by 49 runs to register a clinical victory. Chasing a 164-run target, Trailblazers couldn’t capitalize on a blazing start as a proper batting collapse saw them getting reduced from 63/1 to 114/9 in 20 overs. Captain Smriti Mandhana’s (34) departure sucked all momentum out of their innings witnessing them losing six wickets for 10 runs in less than five overs. Match-winning bowling figures of 4-0-12-4 by Pooja Vastrakar played a primary role behind the aforementioned destruction. Apart from Vastrakar, overseas spin-duo of Sophie Ecclestone and Alana King picked a couple of wickets each at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium tonight. Top-scoring after electing to bat first, Supernovas captain Harmanpreet Kaur scored 37 (29) with the help of four fours in the first innings. Kaur was well-assisted by top-order contributions from Harleen Deol (35) and Deandra Dottin (32). An all-female four-member panel comprising of on-field umpires Janani Narayanan and Vrinda Rathi and match referee GS Lakshmi acted as match officials in this match. Readers must note that Narayanan and Rathi were inducted to International Panel of ICC Development Umpires in 2020. While Narayanan had officiated in a couple of WODIs in Harare last year, Rathi is yet to officiate in an international match. The pair belongs to Chennai and Mumbai respectively.

Trailblazers have their first wicket as Deandra Dottin's entertaining innings comes to an end. Punia pushed the ball towards square leg and sent her partner back after taking a couple of steps forward, but Dottin was already halfway down the track by then, and was well short of the non-striker's end when Sharmin Akhter broke the stumps with a superb throw.

Supernovas are off to a superb start after opting to bat.19:48 (IST)After 3 overs, Supernovas 29/0 ( Priya Punia 9 , Deandra Dottin 20) Big over for the Supernovas with Renuka conceding 14 off her second. Dottin collects back-to-back fours in the second and third deliveries — both hit down the ground — and collects another off the last ball, dispatching another overpitched delivery through the midwicket region.19:45 (IST)After 2 overs, Supernovas 15/0 ( Priya Punia 8 , Deandra Dottin 7) Rajeshwari Gayakwad introduced from the other end.

Punia clobbers the ball over long on for a six off the last ball. Eight off the first over.19:38 (IST)Priya Punia and Deandra Dottin walk out to open the Supernovas innings as Renuka Singh gears up to bowl the first over of the innings.19:11 (IST)Teams:Supernovas: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Deandra Dottin, Priya Punia, Sune Luus, Harleen Deol, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Sophie Ecclestone, Alana King, Chandu V, Pooja Vastrakar, Meghna Singh.Trailblazers: Smriti Mandhana (c), Poonam Yadav, Jemimah Rodrigues, Hayley Matthews, Richa Ghosh (wk), Sophia Dunkley, Arundhati Reddy, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Salma Khatun, Renuka Singh, Sharmin Akhter.19:04 (IST)TOSS: Supernovas win the toss, and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur opts to bat.

Two days later, the Trailblazers square off against Velocity in the final group game before the top two sides meet in the summit clash on Saturday, one day before the IPL 2022 final takes place.India Test and ODI skipper Mithali Raj, meanwhile, is among the notable absentees from the tournament this year. Raj was earlier the captain of the Velocity franchise, which finished runners-up in the 2019 edition. Also absent this year is senior India pacer Jhulan Goswami, who had earlier represented the Trailblazers.Squads:Supernovas: Harmanpreet Kaur (captain), Taniya Bhatia, *Alana King, Ayush Soni, Chandu V, *Deandra Dottin, Harleen Deol, Meghna Singh, Monica Patel, Muskan Malik, Pooja Vastrakar, Priya Punia, Rashi Kanojia, *Sophie Ecclestone, *Sune Luus, Mansi Joshi.Trailblazers: Smriti Mandhana (captain), Poonam Yadav, Arundhati Reddy, *Hayley Matthews, Jemimah Rodrigues, Priyanka Priyadarshini, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Renuka Singh, Richa Ghosh, S.

It would not have been easy for the Gujarat Titans glovesman to return to the venue, where he made a dream Ranji debut with a hundred in 2007, but won't play for the state after a run-in with the establishment. Saha is seeking an exit from Bengal domestic cricket after a CAB official questioned his commitment for state Ranji tam. \"Here, I'm representing Gujarat so my home ground is Motera Stadium, I believe in that. Since I'm no longer with KKR, the Eden is not my home,\" Saha said in a virtual media interaction ahead of their IPL Qualifier One clash against Rajasthan Royals. While he called Motera his home ground, ironically, not a single match of the ongoing IPL has been played in Ahmedabad till now. Asked whether he would be seen playing for Bengal at the Eden again, the 37-year-old said: \"I'm not able to answer the second part of your question.\" \"I might have played a lot of games here in the past but I'm here to play an away game,\" Saha said. The veteran stumper Saha was at loggerheads with the establishment of Cricket Association of Bengal after they named him for the Ranji Trophy quarter final against Jharkhand without his consent. Saha was annoyed that CAB assistant secretary Debabrata Das questioned his commitment after he pulled out of Ranji league stage. Saha is peeved that his state association has not supported him during his 'tough times'. He has verbally sought an no-objection certificate (NOC) from CAB to quit Bengal. Not thinking about team selection: Saha ========================== Saha is currently enjoying a purple patch with the bat in the IPL with 312 runs from nine matches, including three half-centuries. He was not picked for the Indian Test team with head coach Rahul Dravid conveying him that they were looking for a younger second keeper along Rishabh Pant. A furious Saha had then vented his ire at both BCCI President Sourav Ganguly and Dravid. So it came as no surprise that Saha was not picked in the squad for the one-off series deciding Test against England in Edgbaston in June. Saha said he does not want to think much about Team India selection anymore and his repeated snubs. \"It's always team first for me and not individual performance. I don't think about (India team) selection as we are here to play the Qualifier One. All our focus is on the match,\" Saha said on the eve of their IPL Qualifier One against Rajasthan Royals at Eden Gardens. \"My main target always is to contribute in batting, keeping in every match that I play in and take the team over the line. That's my first priority and it's always a bonus to reach a personal milestone -- fifty or 100.\" Saha relishing batting in top order ===================== Talking about his rich vein of form, Saha said he's relishing batting at the top. \"The role given to me here suits me the best. I love to go all out, and take some risks in the first six overs,\" he said. \"I've played in the qualifier, IPL final in the past. I'm aware of the environment, but it's just another match for us.

A report in cricket.com.au said on Monday that Australian greats such as Ian Healy, Adam Gilchrist, Darren Lehmann, Jimmy Maher and former women’s team head coach Matthew Mott will be among those who will speak at the memorial. “Andrew Symonds’ life will be celebrated by former teammates with a no-jacket, no-tie memorial service in Townsville on Friday, almost two weeks after the cricket star’s death,” said the report. The report added that the Riverway Stadium event will be live-streamed at the Gabba, the late cricketer’s old home ground with Queensland. Symonds was driving on Hervey Range Road, near Alice River Bridge in Queensland when his vehicle left the roadway and rolled. Emergency services attempted to revive the former cricketer but he died of his injuries. Symonds averaged 40.61 with the bat from 26 Tests for his country, but was perhaps best known for his exploits in white-ball cricket. He featured in 198 ODIs — scoring six centuries and 30 half-centuries — while also contributing 133 wickets with his handy off-spin and gentle medium pace.

Gujarat Titans' players enter the field during Match 67 of the IPL 2022 between the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Gujarat Titans at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 19 May 2022. Sportzpics for IPL In a live chatroom session CricChat Season 2, talking about the three franchises that have made it to the IPL 2022 playoffs, Kartik said, “They are the new boys, but the players and people involved have been present for a long time. They have handled the post before. The auction plays a very important role and Gujarat Titans, Lucknow Super Giants and Rajasthan Royals did very well there.” He emphasised the importance of decisions taken on the auction day and singled out Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya for their stellar performances this season. “At the end of the day, the decisions taken on the auction day are the most important for team selection,” he said. He corelated Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings’ struggle this season to the franchises' weak performance on the auction day. “For example, Bumrah doesn’t have consistent support in bowling. Super King’s bowlers have performed well but overall, it’s been difficult for them,” he said. Talking about former captain Virat Kohli, Kartik said he is one of those players who is “always ready when the bell rings.” “You can’t keep such players out of the squad for tournaments like the T20 World Cup because they have earned the right to be there for what they are and what they can do at the end moment,” he added. He said the IPL has only become fiercer over the years and predicts an upward trend in the upcoming years. He also spoke about his IPL tenure when he played for four teams: Kolkata Knight Riders, Pune Warriors, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Kings XI Punjab. When asked about India’s lagging performance at big events like the T20 World Cup, Kartik said, “Yes, when we last won the World Cup in 2007, we hadn’t really embraced the format and were viewing it reluctantly. Then IPL changed a lot in terms of our mentality and skill level, which has made a huge difference, but the answer to this has to be given on many different levels. Superficially speaking, my sympathy is with the team as some things have gone against us, costing us the entire tournament.” During the session, Murali reminisced about his time in Australia in 2004-05, when he ran through the Australian batting on a dustbowl, gaining seven wickets in the match to bowl India to a win, which is considered one of the best moments of his cricketing career. For Kartik, playing for India was one of the most challenging yet most rewarding experiences. “I was competing for one spot against so many other good spinners, although I had come from a very small association,” he said.

As a result, Daniil Medvedev could displace Novak Djokovic at the top of the charts. FP Explainers May 23, 2022 18:47:30 IST File image of the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, AP Wimbledon, considered as the most prestigious tournament in tennis, was stripped of ranking points by ATP, WTA and ITF in a move that threatens the pull for the third major of the year. The decision is in response to Wimbledon banning Russian and Belarusian players following the invasion of Ukraine. Wimbledon's decision ruled out a swathe of top players, including men's World No 2 Daniil Medvedev, last year's women's semi-finalist Aryna Sabalenka as well as two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka. Expectedly, the decisions from both sides have its supporters and critics. Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had termed Wimbledon's decision to bar Russian and Belarusian players as \"unfair\". Now, former Ukraine pro Sergiy Stakhovsky hit out at ATP Tour for \"standing on the side of the invaders and murderers.\" To say that I am disappointed in @atptour would be understatement.. Never would expect that anyone can stand on the side of invaders and murderers… but it seems to me that even my fellow players feel sorry for invaders and collaborants from rus/blr..1/2 — Sergiy Stakhovsky (@Stako_tennis) May 20, 2022 Players which in 85 days where not able to produce any clear message of condemnation of invasion into Ukraine. Shameful day in tennis.2/2 — Sergiy Stakhovsky (@Stako_tennis) May 20, 2022 What did ATP and WTA have to say in their decision-making? \"It is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022,\" said an ATP statement . \"Our rules and agreements exist in order to protect the rights of players as a whole. Unilateral decisions of this nature, if unaddressed, set a damaging precedent for the rest of the Tour. \"Discrimination by individual tournaments is simply not viable.\" Meanwhile WTA chief executive Steve Simon said that his organisation believed \"that individual athletes participating in an individual sport should not be penalised solely because of their nationalities or the decisions made by the governments of their countries.\" \"As a result of the All England Tennis Club's position that it will not honour its obligation to use the WTA Rankings for entry into Wimbledon, and proceed with a partial field not based on merit, the WTA has made the difficult decision to not award ranking points for this year's Wimbledon,\" he added. Unlike Wimbledon, the warm-up events in Britain have retained their ranking points. ATP and WTA chose not to strip points from the lead-in events because other European tournaments were still open to Russian and Belarusian players during those three weeks of the season. The WTA did announce that it was putting the tournaments in Nottingham, Birmingham and Eastbourne on probation because of the ban. Have Wimbledon said anything? Wimbledon chiefs at the All England Club labelled the move by the ATP and WTA as \"disproportionate\" . \"We believe these decisions to be disproportionate in the context of the exceptional and extreme circumstances of this situation and the position we found ourselves in, and damaging to all players who compete on tour,\" said AELTC in a statement not long after the ATP, WTA and ITF's communications were announced. The open ended nature of ATP and Wimbledon's statement suggested a resolution could be reached. \"We remain hopeful of further discussions with Wimbledon leading to an acceptable outcome for all concerned,\" said the ATP. While Wimbledon said they'd consider their options and make an announcement in due course. How does this affect Wimbledon and the players? When World No 1 Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2021, he earned 2,000 points. Without ranking points, Wimbledon is reduced to a high-profile exhibition event. Medvedev, World No 2, is now in excellent position to displace Djokovic after Wimbledon because the Serb loses 2000 points without it being replaced. The Russian, who reached the Round of 16 at Wimbledon last year, will only lose 180 points. There is a reason Wimbledon is probably the most known tennis competition. Points or no points, there are things way bigger than tennis and in these hard times, Wimbledon is on the right side and will stay with its perfect reputation👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 As for the rest, it’s their choice https://t.co/ULaw8cqIDd — Alex Dolgopolov (@TheDolgo) May 20, 2022 Players are interested in tournaments by variety of factors with prize money and ranking points chief to them. Without the ranking points, a large number of players could be making long expensive trips without long term benefits and squandering their ability to fight for points from last year. Without ranking points, many players could give the tournament a miss thus affecting the marketability, attendance and quality of the 2022 edition of the Championships. Has this happened to Wimbledon before? Yes. In 1973, 81 players boycotted the Wimbledon tournament. The impasse was reached after Niki Pilić refused to play for Yugoslavia against New Zealand in the Davis Cup. As a result, International Lawn Tennis Federation, an amateur tennis governing body, suspended Pilic from Wimbledon. This came just a year after the formation of the ATP and much to the surprise of the governing bodies, 80 more men joined in the protest and supported Pilic. This included the two most-recent champions John Newcombe and Stan Smith. As a result, a large number of qualifiers and lucky losers made up the draw. The player movement solidified the importance of the ATP. But Wimbledon saw its second-highest attendance of any fortnight during that period. How have the players reacted to the decision? \"I think when you are backed into a corner and that's all you can do, I think that's why the decision was made, and I support it,\" said former US Open champion Sloane Stephens. She also refused to divulge the conversations that happened before the announcement was made. Casper Ruud, who won the clay court tournament last week in Geneva, said it was unfair on the grass court specialists. \"Wimbledon is not where I make most of my points, so for me, it's doesn't matter too much when you think about the points but for other players it's of course unfair that they cannot even get the chance,\" said Ruud. \"The ATP is trying to do their best for the players. Wimbledon made a decision that I'm not happy with, but that's their decision and I have to respect them,\" said Joao Sousa who reached the final in Geneva.

A total of 70 matches were played since March 26 and this year's cricketing extravaganza was no different than its predecessors -- bringing out the highest quality of cricket almost every single evening over the last one and a half months. Restricted to just 4 venues due to Covid, the groundsmen at the Wankhede Stadium, Brabourne Stadium, DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai and Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune did a fantastic job to ensure that the pitches, which had to be reused, did not bring down the quality of cricket. Balls disappearing into the stands, stumps cartwheeling and fielders defying gravity, taking supernatural catches -- almost every match in the league phase was a blockbuster movie in itself, giving goosebumps and bringing out a wide range of emotions from the fans. Read Also IPL 2022 Playoffs: Super Over could determine winner in case of disruptions A Super Over could decide IPL 15's champions should rain gods play spoilsport and no play is possible in regulation time. And now with the league phase of the 15th edition done and dusted, we have the last four teams standing -- Gujarat Titans , Rajasthan Royals , Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bangalore, who will lock horns in the playoffs, starting May 24, in an attempt to lay their hands on the coveted trophy. With the matches of the league phase restricted to just 4 stadiums in Maharashtra, there were initial concerns that the pitches being used multiple times and the dew factor might play a huge role in the results of the contests. And during the initial phase it was pretty clear that the captains were indeed exploiting the toss results, opting to bowl first every single time so that the dew might trouble the opposition bowlers while they were chasing. At first, it was a given that the captain who would win the toss would bowl first, but over time the mentality and the strategy of the teams changed as they realised that it was not the sure shot way to victory. Also the dew factor abated quite a bit. The question here is, was opting to bowl after winning the toss really worth it? How crucial was the toss throughout the league stage of the tournament? Did it really help teams while chasing? Or was it just a myth that was eventually busted? How did the bowlers overcome the hurdle of dew and successfully defended totals? TimesofIndia.com here provides you with all the answers. Data compiled over 70 matches will help give you a fair idea of how the tournament progressed and what possibly lies ahead during the playoffs. To begin with, here's a look at some interesting numbers (from the completed league stage): * Number of matches where the teams who won the toss, chose to bowl and won - 27 * Number of matches where the teams who won the toss, chose to bowl and lost - 29 * Number of matches where the teams who won the toss, chose to bat and won - 7 * Number of matches where the teams who won the toss, chose to bat and lost - 7 Overall numbers: * Number of times when captains won the toss and opted to bowl in the league stage - 56 * Number of times when captains won the toss and opted to bat in the league stage - 14 So, keeping these numbers in mind, winning the toss and opting to bowl was the preferred choice initially for all skippers, but that trend clearly changed over the course of the tournament. Yes, the first four straight games were won by teams chasing, but it was Match 5 between Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad when the former won the first match of the season, defending a target.

All the hue and cry about the dew was mostly during the first half of the tournament. And as the matches went on, the groundsmen ensured that the dew factor was taken care of as they spread chemicals and took other measures to curtail dew during the night. Out of the 35 matches in the first half of the tournament, only 15 were won by the teams chasing which is less than 43 percent of the matches. Taking the wickets having fallen into consideration, 214 wickets fell in the first innings while 220 wickets fell in the second innings overall in the first 35 games of the league stage. In the next 35 games, teams won only 14 out of the 35 matches batting second, which was one less than the first half. And again during this period, 222 wickets fell in the second innings as compared to 213 in the first. Read Also IPL 2022: Top ICC officials to arrive in India for playoffs A couple of top officials of the International Cricket Council are coming to watch the IPL playoffs in Kolkata and Ahmedabad in the coming week, at the invitation of the BCCI, essentially to \"discuss the upcoming media rights of the ICC\" with their counterparts in the Indian Board. While the numbers show that, dew did not have a major impact but it took the captains almost half of the league phase to realise that batting first after winning the toss was not a bad option at all. It was in Match 35 when for the first time Gujarat Titans skipper Hardik Pandya won the toss and opted to bat in an afternoon match. But for a captain to bat first in an evening match, the wait went on till Match 48, Hardik again took a bold decision to bat first. Although Gujarat lost that game, Hardik wanted to put himself and his team out of the comfort zone of chasing after winning the toss, purely to keep everyone in the GT camp ready for the eventuality of losing the toss and having to bat first. Subsequently the ratio of teams winning the toss and batting first vis a vis bowling first changed and towards the latter part of the league phase captains were willingly opting to set targets. * Looking at this from another angle - a total of 869 wickets fell in the 70 matches of the league phase. Out of this 427 wickets were taken in the first innings (49.13%) while 442 were taken in the second (50.86%). * Instances of bowlers winning Man of the Match awards in first 35 matches - 14 * Instances of bowlers winning Man of the Match awards from Match 36 to 70 - 15 Out of the 70 matches played in the league phase, bowlers won the Man of the Match awards on 29 occasions overall and there is not much to differentiate between the two halves of the tournament (the first 35 games played and the 35 games played after that). The first and only hat-trick of the season so far, came while defending the target (Yuzvendra Chahal) while the likes of Wanindu Hasaranga, Avesh Khan and many others also excelled while bowling second. Overall percentage of teams winning the toss, bowling first and winning - 38.57% Overall percentage of teams winning the toss, bowling first and losing - 41.42% Overall percentage of teams winning the toss, batting first and winning - 10% Overall percentage of teams winning the toss, batting first and losing - 10% Now that it has been established that the teams were successfully able to defend targets in more that 40 percent of the matches overall (afternoon and evening matches) here's how bowlers adapted to the conditions. Wide yorkers were one of the most used deliveries during the league phase of the tournament. To go with that, the bowlers outsmarted the batters, with varied pace in their bowling. With the conditions assisting the batters, the bowlers managed pretty well with the wet ball (when there was dew), outthinking the batters on several occasions. Although there were a few high-scoring encounters as well where the batters completely decimated the bowlers, targets in excess of 190 were not very regular sightings. With the knockouts scheduled in Kolkata and Ahmedabad, dew at this time of the year should no longer be a factor as temperatures have been soaring in the high 40s across east and north India. It's the rain factor, especially in the two playoff matches in Kolkata that could make a difference, with a possible Super Over being used to decide the winner if needed.","pubDate":"2022-05-23 12:33:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: BCCI issues fresh Playoffs guidelines, Super over can decide result; Know details","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-bcci-issues-fresh-playoffs-guidelines-super-over-can-decide-result-know-details-gt-vs-rr-rcb-vs-lsg-qualifiers-eliminators-2022-05-23-778734","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In the ongoing season of the cricket league, playoffs are scheduled to be played in iconic Eden Gardens, Kolkata.

During the first day of the second Test of the ongoing Sri Lanka’s tour of Bangladesh in Mirpur, former Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim and wicket-keeper batter Litton Das not only joined hands to put together a rescue act but also managed to enter the record books. Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque (9) electing to bat first after winning the toss appeared to have backfired initially as his team was reduced to 24/5 in the seventh over. Senior batters in Tamim Iqbal (0) and Shakib Al Hasan (0) not managing to score a run between them were part of a batting collapse in the morning session today. Rahim and Das, who had shared a 201-run fourth-wicket partnership in the first Test in Chattogram, were in the middle of a 253-run sixth-wicket partnership at Stumps, Day 1. Rahim, who will resume batting from 115* (252) tomorrow, scored his ninth Test century. In what is his second consecutive century, it is his fifth at home, fourth at No. 5 third at this venue and against Sri Lanka. Rahim, whose previous two Test centuries at the Shere Bangla National Stadium have ]been double hundreds, would be looking forward to his third one here on Day 2.

For now, Rahim and Das’ partnership is the 21st highest sixth-wicket partnership in Test cricket. Fifth-highest Test partnership for Bangladesh , it is the highest sixth-wicket stand for two Bangladeshi batters. It was like an international dialling code competition: 00890. But then Rahim and Das put on a magnificent unbroken 253 run stand. Not long after beating the Kiwis, the Bangladeshis are showing that they are a very competitive Test side, home and away, who do not panic at all. — Iceland Cricket (@icelandcricket) May 23, 2022","pubDate":"2022-05-23 12:15:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Kusal Mendis taken to Dhaka hospital after complaining of chest pain","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/kusal-mendis-taken-to-dhaka-hospital-after-complaining-of-chest-pain-sri-lanka-vs-bangladesh-2022-05-23-778728","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kusal Mendis, the Sri Lankan batsman was taken to a hospital in Dhaka after experiencing chest pains during the opening day of the second cricket Test against Bangladesh on Monday.","content":", the Sri Lankan batsman was taken to a hospital in Dhaka after experiencing chest pains during the opening day of the second cricket Test against Bangladesh on Monday.

Mendis scored 54 off 131 balls in the first innings in the drawn first test, followed by a quick 48 in the second stint.","pubDate":"2022-05-23 12:11:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women's T20 Challenge 2022: Teams, venue, schedule and all you need to know","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/women-s-t20-challenge-2022-teams-venue-schedule-and-all-you-need-to-know-122052301235_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Women's T20 Challenge 2022: Here is your guide to the three-team and four-match long tournament hosted for women cricketers by BCCI as part of promoting women's cricket in the country through the IPL","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-23 11:55:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220523/thumb-122052301235.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Trailblazers vs Supernovas, Women's T20 Challenge LIVE Score: Mandhana vs Harmanpreet; Predicted Playing XI, Preview, Squads","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/ipl/ipl-news/trailblazers-vs-supernovas-womens-t20-challenge-ipl-wipl-live-score-match-2022/article38496909.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["Team Sportstar"],"video_url":null,"description":"Supernovas vs Trailblazers LIVE Score, Women's T20 Challenge: Check out the live score, updates and highlights of today's WT20C match from the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-23 11:45:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Karthik terms India recall for T20Is vs South Africa ‘most special comeback’","link":"https://www.orissapost.com/karthik-terms-india-recall-for-t20is-vs-south-africa-most-special-comeback/","keywords":["Sports","Dinesh Karthik","Mumbai Indians","Rahul Dravid","rohit sharma"],"creator":["Post News Network"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: Wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik last played a T20I for India in February 2019 against Australia, months before his last appearance in the national colours came during the semifinal loss to eventual runners-up New Zealand in the ODI World Cup in England.

Now, almost three years later, Karthik scripted yet another comeback into the Indian team, this time for the five-match T20I series against South Africa in June, on the back of scintillating finishing touches for Royal Challengers Bangalore in league stage of IPL 2022, amassing 287 at an average of 57.40 and strike-rate of 191.33. It was no surprise that Karthik termed his re-entry into the national side as “most special comeback” of his career, coming against all odds. “Very happy, very, very satisfying, must say that this has been probably my most special comeback, because a lot of people had given up on me. For me to come back and do what I did, practice the way I did with my coach (Abhishek) Nayar, so many special things that have happened in the lead-up to the auction, and how I practised post that,” said Karthik in a video posted by the franchise on their social media accounts. Karthik expressed gratitude to Bangalore head coach Sanjay Bangar and director of cricket Mike Hesson for entrusting him with finishing duties. “A lot of credit also to Sanjay Bangar and Mike Hesson, I think the clarity that they gave me to execute the role that I wanted to do, in many ways (I am) indebted to RCB for picking me and giving me that role, believing in me and then me coming out here and trying to do my best for this team RCB. All in all, a very, very happy feeling. I am very excited overall.” Karthik, set to turn 37 next week, was quick in crediting the selection committee, skipper Rohit Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid for selecting him and the skillsets he brings to the team despite many young contenders present in the country. “Look, I think a lot of credit must go to the selectors, Rohit (Sharma) and (Rahul) Dravid, because these days you have so many young boys putting up their hands for selection. To see the skillset that is there and to believe that this is the guy we need for the (Men’s T20) World Cup, it is a very, very humbling feeling. I know the journey is still there to the World Cup but being a part of the scheme of things and giving an opportunity for me to showcase my skills, I am very proud of it.” Despite picking up the commentator’s mic during India’s Test tour of England and World Test Championship final, Karthik’s self-belief and never giving up on making a comeback into the national fold resulted in dishing out consistent performances and eventually, he was rewarded with the call-up for T20Is against the Proteas on Sunday. “I think I started believing for a long time now, I was always believing but people around me gave me the feel that you should not dream too much. I took up the role of a commentator for a bit and obviously that made it look like I was no more interested in trying to come back to the Indian team. But I have always said that for me, playing in the Indian team is the priority. Because I had time, I did it (commentary) and I am very excited about it (on being in India’s T20I team),” concluded the right-hander.  ","pubDate":"2022-05-23 10:44:54","image_url":"https://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dinesh-Karthik-300x169.jpg","source_id":"orissapost","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women's T20 Challenge 2022: Trailblazers vs Supernovas, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Live streaming details","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/women-s-t20-challenge-2022-trailblazers-vs-supernova-fantasy-cricket-tips-dream-11-live-streaming-details-match-no-1-2022-05-23-778701","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Women's T20 Challenge 2022: Trailblazers vs Supernovas, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Live streaming details Match Details Trailblazers vs Supernovas","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-23 10:34:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
