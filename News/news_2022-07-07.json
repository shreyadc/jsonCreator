In the first Test of the South Africa tour, India had set the home team a target of 305 and won.\"It's been disappointing for us,\" Dravid said. \"I mean we had a couple of opportunities in South Africa as well and here as well. I just think it's something we need to look at, something we need to probably work on.\"We have been very good at that over the last few years, in terms of taking wickets and winning those Test matches. But, yeah, we haven't been able to do that over the last few months. It's been disappointing for us. I mean we had a couple of opportunities in South Africa as well and here as well. I just think it's something we need to look at. —Rahul Dravid, India Coach\"We have been very good at that over the last few years, in terms of taking wickets and winning those Test matches,\" Dravid added. \"But, yeah, we haven't been able to do that over the last few months. It could be a variety of factorshellip; It could be maybe we just need to maintain that intensity, maintain that level of fitness, or maintain that level of performance right through a Test match.\"In the three defeats, India had gone in with pace-heavy attacks, picking up combinations from among Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur and Umesh Yadav. They used only one spinner in these Tests, Ravichandran Ashwin in South Africa and Ravindra Jadeja here in Birmingham.In retrospect, after Thakur's modest returns in the Birmingham Test, and listless bowling in the fourth innings, analysts wondered if Ashwin, with his variation, would have been more useful in Birmingham.Dravid said India opted for Thakur over Ashwin because they thought the wicket would help pace bowlers through the game. \"It is always not easy to leave someone like Ashwin out in a Test match,\" Dravid said. \"But having said that, when we looked at the wicket on the first day, it had a pretty good even covering of grass. We felt that there was enough in it for the fast bowlers.\"\"It's easy to look back on the fifth day and say it would have been nice to have a second spinner in the fourth innings, but again it didn't really turn to justify that,\" he added.Poor battingDravid said the failure of the batsmen in the second innings, in which the top-order flopped again before the team lost the last seven wickets for 92 runs, hurt the team most. He said this had happened in South Africa as well.\"In the second innings, we have not batted as well,\" Dravid said. \"If you look at all the third innings of these two Test matches overseas and this one, the batting has also probably not been up to scratch. In both areas, we have sort of started the Test matches well but we haven't been able to finish well. Yeah, we need to get better at that and certainly need to improve.\"\"They played well over the five days. We had our opportunities, we played well over the first three days. We couldn't maintain that,\" he added. \"That's why Test cricket is hard. And that's why Test cricket means that you have got to be able to keep putting those performances right through the five days. We were not able to do that and they did that better than us and they deserved to win this Test match.\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-07 02:37:42","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/7/2022_7$largeimg_1063912207.JPG","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Women eye series sweep in Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/women-eye-series-sweep-in-sri-lanka-410239","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Pallekele, July 6A confident India will look to complete the formalities and assert their supremacy by completing a whitewash of Sri Lanka in the third and final women's ODI here tomorrow.Playing ODI cricket for the first time since the talismanic Mithali Raj retired, India won the first two games in contrasting fashion to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.The visitors had bagged the preceding T20I series 2-1.

Indian women cricket team will look to complete a 3-0 whitewash in the ODI series after already winning the series 2-0 with a comprehensive 10-wicket win in the second ODI on Monday. Young Indian opener Shafali Verma, who is known for her big-hitting prowess, says she is making a conscious effort to improve her strike rotation to become a better cricketer. The 18-year-old slammed a run-a-ball 71 not out, her career-best score in ODIs, in an unbroken 174-run partnership with Smriti Mandhana (94 not out) as India decimated the hosts by 10 wickets here on Monday to take a unassailable 2-0 lead in the three match series. The 18-year-old has not been able to maintain consistency in her performances, especially in the 50-over format. “Having seen my past matches, I thought I lacked in taking singles, so I’ve worked on it. I’m trying to be better as I feel taking singles is very important to build your innings in ODIs,” Shafali said on the eve of the third and final ODI of the series. “If it’s a good ball, it’s about taking singles and rotating the strike. If you keep rotating strike, scoring boundaries become easy. I’m also working a lot on my fitness.” In the preceding T20 series, Shafali failed to convert her starts and got out for 31, 17 and 5 in the three matches. But in the ODIs, she scored her first half-century in the format since the one against South Africa in the World Cup in March. With a modest target in sight, the duo focused on taking singles and twos as they kept piling misery on the Lankan attack.

The visitors already have a winning 2-0 lead in the series. Shafali Verma (71 not out) had struck a huge 174-run stand with opener Smriti Mandhana (94 not out) to win the second ODI by ten wickets after bundling SL out for just 173 runs. “When we play in ODIs, we have to work on fitness and taking singles. I have been working on that. I watched some of my matches and found that I lack in taking singles. I felt that I should work more on rotating the strike and have done that. I did that in T20Is (against Sri Lanka) – taking singles of good balls. I was looking to play longer innings. I want to better myself,” said Verma in a press conference ahead of the final ODI.

After a poor start as an opener, she played in the middle order alongside the likes of Ellyse Perry, Alyssa Healy, Ashleigh Gardner and Nicole Bolton. “I learnt that you can take singles, and single-doubles can then lead to a lot of boundaries,” she said. The batter has a great equation with her opening partner Smriti Mandhana, with who she has opened 14 times in the format. The duo has stitched together five fifty-run stands before their huge stand in the second ODI. Verma said that the opener always supports her on and off the field. “She tells me my mistakes and where we can improve as a pair. We enjoy talking to each other on the field and there’s good bonding and are looking to have more partnerships,” she added.

It was the latest example of ‘Bazball’ in action, with a seven-wicket win in Birmingham England’s fourth successful chase in as many Tests under a new leadership duo of coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes following a 3-0 whitewash of Test world champions New Zealand. That series saw England chase down seemingly stiff targets of 277, 299 and 296. No England side, however, had previously made more to win in the fourth innings of a Test than 359, when Stokes’ brilliant century secured a thrilling victory over Australia at Headingley three years ago. But with Joe Root (142 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (114 not out) sharing an unbroken partnership of 269, that mark was overhauled with ease at Edgbaston as England ended a five-match series all square at 2-2. Yet as well as former England captain Root and Bairstow batted, they are in-form and experienced internationals. Arguably the greatest revelation about England’s latest run-chase was how they attacked it from the start, with Alex Lees and Zak Crawley, both of whom had been struggling for runs, sharing a century opening stand in 19.5 overs -- the fastest in England Test history. Stokes said England’s approach was down to a change in attitude from a team that had won just one of its 17 previous Tests prior to the New Zealand series. “When you’ve got real clarity in what you want to achieve as a team and how you want to play it makes things a lot easier,” said Stokes. “We know what we were going to do -- we knew we were always going to go out and try and chase that down from the get-go. “A great way to explain is that teams are perhaps better than us, but teams won’t be braver than us. “(England spinner) Jack Leach said that to me and it is a great way to sum things up at the moment,” the all-rounder added. Scoring runs quickly in Test cricket is nothing new. A celebrated West Indies team once chased down a target of 342 inside a day to beat England by nine wickets at Lord’s, with opener Gordon Greenidge making an unbeaten double century. And the successful Australia teams of the late 1990s and early 2000s looked to score at a rate of four per over in order to give their bowlers as much time as possible to take the 20 wickets needed to win a Test. But on Tuesday, England were scoring at a rate of nearly five an over, with the way Root reverse scooped medium-pacer Shardul Thakur for six a sign of how T20 shot-making, unknown to previous generations, is influencing the longer game. Former New Zealand captain McCullum was credited for being the inspiration behind England’s rise from white-ball no-hopers to 2019 50-over World Cup winners and England clearly hope he will have a similar effect now he is directly involved with the Test side. Four matches is a small sample size, however, and had Rishabh Pant stayed in for just a little longer in India’s second innings, Stokes may have been granted a wish where he “almost wanted them to get 450 (ahead), to see what we did.” India coach Rahul Dravid, one of the best batsmen of his era, was impressed by England but said the way Pant had scored a typically dynamic 146, in a first innings where Ravindra Jadeja also made a hundred, proved Stokes’ side did not have a copyright on attacking play. “When your players are doing well, are in good form, then you can play really positively, can take the game forward,” said Dravid. “We also showed when Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja were playing in the first innings -- we played pretty positive cricket. “But when two positive players or attacking players are in good form, and can play such a big innings, and that happens in three to four matches continuously it looks good for cricket and also for them.”","pubDate":"2022-07-07 00:56:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Team leaves for Sri Lanka","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/972120-team-leaves-for-sri-lanka","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Pakistan cricket team departed for Sri Lanka for a two-match Test series in the early hours of Wednesday.The national Test squad led by Babar Azam will play a three-day warm-up match from July 11.The first Test will begin on July 16 in Galle.

Aravinda, known for aggressive batting during an illustrious career that included a 1996 World Cup triumph, likened the current T20 leagues to English domestic cricket in the latter part of the last century, which attracted top players from all around the world to learn their craft and gain experience. “It’s like the county cricket of those days which gave the English cricketers the advantage,” the 56-year-old, who played for English county Kent in the 1990s, told AFP. “The IPL, Big Bash or in England the Hundred and T20 Blitz, those are tournaments which allow players to develop.” The Indian Premier League started in 2008 and has spawned copycat tournaments around the world. But it remains the biggest draw with a recent media rights auction valuing the IPL at a whopping $6.2 billion, or $15 million per match, making it bigger in those terms than football’s English Premier League which is valued at $11 million per match. Aravinda said India should enable smaller nations to share in the riches generated to grow the game, raise global playing standards and improve skill levels, something that would ultimately benefit the IPL.","pubDate":"2022-07-07 00:56:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Khawaja wants to see multi-cultural change","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/khawaja-wants-to-see-multi-cultural-change-c-7433666","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Usman Khawaja believes the key to getting more players from multi-cultural backgrounds into elite level cricket in Australia is a more diverse coaching set up.","content":"Usman Khawaja wants to see an Australian cricket landscape where the 32 per cent of registered local multi-cultural players are represented. Not just in the crowd, but at an elite level on the field. And most importantly, in the coaching ranks. \"Because the fact is, Australia is a very multi-cultural place,\" Khawaja told AAP. \"It has a lot of different people from different backgrounds and different beliefs. \"Part of it is just showing the world that, because it's hard for them to see because we have a very white-dominated cricket team. \"Which is funny because that's not what the general population looks like. It's not even what the sport looks like.\" Of all registered club cricketers in Australia, 32 per cent - or 126,500 - were either born overseas or had parents immigrate to Australia. Khawaja hopes this year's Twenty20 World Cup can be the start of highlighting the need to better support the entire demographic of the sport. Friday marks 100 days to the start of the tournament, where the Pakistan-born Khawaja is a multi-cultural ambassador. So far, 85 per cent of tickets have been sold to Australian residents, but a match involving Australia does not feature in the top-four selling games. India's clash with Pakistan at the MCG on October 23 tops the list, followed by India against South Africa, India against a qualifier and then the November 13 final. \"It's an opportunity to show the world what Australia is about, where we are heading and where we want to head,\" Khawaja said. \"Even when I was younger there were a lot of guys I played with from sub-continent backgrounds. \"They were there in the system ... it's just about trying to give them the best chance to succeed in the future.\" Khawaja has long been the voice championing for more multi-cultural sport at the top level. Encouraged to become more vocal when he moved to Queensland in 2012, Khawaja admits he felt like he went back in time after previously growing up in Sydney and regularly visiting Melbourne. Of the 464 men to play Test cricket for Australia, Khawaja is one of just 26 to have started their lives overseas. When it comes to players from Asia, that number drops to Khawaja being one of five after Bransby Cooper, Rex Sellers (both India), Stephen O'Keefe (Malaysia) and Dav Whatmore (Sri Lanka). A man of Islamic faith, Khawaja is the one and only Muslim in Australia's Test history. It's a situation he is constantly reminded of after being told by fans on the street they now support Australia because they have someone who represents them. But the 35-year-old has long made the point he wants to see change. And crucial to that, as far as Khawaja is concerned, is in coaching. CA does not have records on the diversity in its coaching ranks, but the suggestion is it does not meet that of the playing numbers. Particularly at an elite or premier cricket level. \"Cricket is one of those games that has a lot of things that are dictated in real life,\" Khawaja said. \"The journey, going through the system that aren't fully under your control. \"Whether people understand it or not, there is always going to be biases towards individuals. \"If you have predominantly white coaches and selectors, they will gravitate naturally to the whiter community. \"That's not because they are racist, it's just because they grow up and see a kid who reminds them of their son or daughter. It's a natural bias they have.\" Khawaja does have hope that will change. He sees a more diverse and accepting Australia in 2022, and is now on working committees set up by CA. The opening batter believes there is more of a desire to have worked-out plans now than in the past, where it was more of a scatted approach. But ultimately as he puts it, coaches select other coaches to work with. And there has to be a significant shift in the system at some point to help develop young cricketers from a similar background as his. \"Sometimes a coach does need to be a father figure,\" Khawaja said. \"Having a lot of coaches come through the system not understand what I was going through growing up or in my early 20s. \"You spend so much time playing the game, being around it. You spent more time than not on the field or in the nets, and they need to be able to relate. \"If you don't relate to certain individuals or players or don't have the people in the right places you can relate to, it's very hard. \"Sometimes you can be lost in the system because people don't understand what you are going through.\"","pubDate":"2022-07-06 22:01:50","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-7433666/9e2c5ef9c9b2d40d80af8bc97826b219cfff05ba-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Happy Birthday Mahi Bhai: Suresh Raina, CSK, Mohammad Kaif and others post best birthday wishes for MS Dhoni","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-happy-birthday-mahi-bhai-suresh-raina-csk-mohammad-kaif-and-others-post-best-birthday-wishes-for-ms-dhoni/","keywords":["Cricket","chennai super kings","csk","Dhoni birthday","India","MS Dhoni","MS Dhoni birthday","Suresh Raina"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Happy Birthday Mahi Bhai: The legendary Indian captain started receiving heartening birthday wishes on his 41st birthday.

Legendary Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has turned 41 today. Not a surprise by any means, Dhoni started receiving heartening birthday wishes from his teammates, fans and well-wishers just as the clock struck 12. Dhoni, who continues to enjoy a heavy and loyal fan base despite retiring from international cricket almost a couple of years ago, is almost certain of being in the limelight throughout the day today. While wishes have already started to pour in from across the globe, expect more cricketers taking to their respective social media accounts to wish Dhoni on his 41st birthday. In his 538 appearances at the highest level, Dhoni had amassed 17,266 runs at an average and strike rate of 44.96 and 79.07 respectively. In addition to scoring 16 centuries and 108 half-centuries, Dhoni also has the record of third-most dismissals (829) for a wicket-keeper across formats. Dhoni, who will go down as one of the most impact-generating captains in cricket, had led India on a mammoth 332 occasions (60 Tests, 200 ODIs and 72 T20Is) across formats. One and only captain to win the ICC World Twenty20, ICC Cricket World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy under his tenure, Dhoni’s never-ending accomplishments make him an absolute legend of this game. Dhoni, who continues to lead Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, was last seen in action during IPL 2022 earlier this year. With this IPL season being one of their worsts, Dhoni has confirmed returning to IPL 2023 . Readers must note that it was after winning IPL 2021 that Dhoni had hinted at playing in front of their fans at the MA Chidambaram Stadium before bidding adieu to the biggest T20 tournament in the world. Dada taught us youngsters how to win and Dhoni made it into a habit. Two great leaders from different eras born just a day apart.

Going by the aforementioned recent T20I numbers at this venue, there is expected to be an even contest between bat and the ball today, although it is the batters who are likely to dictate terms throughout the match proceedings.","pubDate":"2022-07-06 15:40:32","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rose Bowl cricket ground weather: Southampton cricket ground weather forecast 1st T20 India vs England","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rose-bowl-cricket-ground-weather-southampton-cricket-ground-weather-forecast-1st-t20-india-vs-england/","keywords":["Cricket","England","India","India tour of England 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rose Bowl cricket ground weather: The SportsRush presents before you the weather prediction for the first ENG vs IND T20I.

Separated by a solitary day in between, England and India will switch from whites to coloured jerseys as the rescheduled fifth Test match will be followed by the first T20I in Southampton tomorrow. However, none of the 22 players from both the teams who took part in the recently concluded Birmingham Test will be playing the first T20I on Thursday. While England have already announced a completely different 14-member squad for a three-match series, India’s 18-member squad for the first T20I will undergo as many as five changes before the second and third T20Is to be played on Saturday and Sunday respectively. The first three days of the Edgbaston Test were affected by rain shortening the morning session on a continual basis. The last two days of the match, on the contrary, had witnessed uninterrupted play. ALSO READ: Will Rohit Sharma play the first England vs India T20I in Southampton?

Named successor to Eoin Morgan last week in England's new white-ball era under Australian coach Matthew Mott, Buttler is set for his first assignment with three Twenty20s in four days against India, starting on Thursday in Southampton. Buttler has plenty of confidence in the current 50-over champions despite Morgan's absence. Morgan was the architect of England's transformation from no-hopers to trailblazers and Buttler, so integral to their uptick in fortunes, sees no point in diverting from that wildly successful formula. \"There's a really clear way we want to play our cricket and I think that will outlast me and everyone,\" said Buttler. \"It will be much of the same and, if anything, can we take that to new levels? That's what we'll always be challenging ourselves on. A big part of the team is not to set boundaries and not to have limitations. \"There's big expectations on the group now that that's where we believe we're good enough to be. Absolutely we deserve that through all the hard work we've put in. \"Winning tournaments isn't just as simple as that (but) it's going into them with the expectation of being able to compete and get to semi-finals and finals, that's where we're at as a team.\" While Buttler will resume his opening partnership with Jason Roy, Morgan's international retirement creates a vacancy in the middle order, although his spot is expected to be taken by big-hitting Liam Livingstone. England claimed their fourth successive Test win earlier this week, making mincemeat of what should have been been a lofty 378-run target, which was chased down with seven wickets to spare against India. An adventurous approach akin to what the white-ball side have been doing has been embraced by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum following a poor run of results over the preceding 12 months. While he has been blown away by what he has witnessed, Buttler, discarded following a poor Ashes series last winter, reiterated that his priority is not on a Test recall. \"It's not a question that needs to be answered at the minute for me,\" added Buttler, who is without Stokes and Jonny Bairstow for the T20 series because of their Test commitments. \"I'm very focused on this and there's not many spaces available in that team, is there? \"They're playing brilliantly well and it's great to watch. Being made captain of this team in T20s and ODIs needs full focus and a lot of energy. That's where all my focus is at the minute.\"","pubDate":"2022-07-06 15:24:22","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-7432018/b5d7646c1e617c78cbc2c565a65a3f76d1b9e133-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MSD Birthday: larger-than-life celebration for larger-than-life cricketer","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/msd-birthday-41-feet-cutout-made-by-fans-to-celebrate-mahendra-singh-dhoni-s-birthday-msd-2022-07-06-790174","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"When it comes to the most successful skipper of all time, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, his fans celebrate him in a way that is larger than life.

Dhoni does not play international cricket now, but not even for a day do his fans forget to celebrate him or his achievements in international cricket. According to 's fans, if cricket is a religion then Dhoni is their God, that is the stature of MS Dhoni. The boy from Ranchi who started to play cricket for fun went on to achieve heights in the game that no other skipper in history has. The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) stalwart is the only captain in the history of the game to win three major ICC events which include the Champions Trophy (2013), the T20 World Cup (2007), and the fabled ICC ODI World Cup (2011). The six with which he sealed the match will always remain fresh in the memories of Indian cricket fans and every cricket lover all across the globe. The Indian legend turns 41 on July 7, 2022, Thursday and his fans all across the globe have started their celebrations for his birthday. This time his fans have ensured that they make his birthday special and have a 41 feet cutout made to honor the ex-India captain in Vijayawada. The huge cutout depicts Dhoni hitting that legendary six in the 2011 World Cup final which he played against Nuwan Kulasekara. \"Dhoni finishes off in style, a magnificent strike into the crowd, India lift the World Cup after 28 years and it is an Indian captain, who has been magnificent in the night of the finals\", gasped former Indian coach Ravi Shastri when MSD played this shot and sealed the World Cup victory for team India. As per reports, the former India captain is now in London where he will celebrate his 41st birthday along with his family.","pubDate":"2022-07-06 15:20:58","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Steve Smith on England's Baz Ball approach: Intrigued to see how long it lasts","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/steve-smith-on-englands-baz-balls-approach-intrigued-to-see-how-long-it-lasts-752218","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"England have a new Test coach in Brendon McCullumUnder him, they have won all their four TestsEngland recently defeated India by 7 wickets at Edgbaston","content":"Steve Smith on England’s Baz Ball’s approach: Intrigued to see how long it lasts Former Australia captain Steve Smith has termed England's new approach to Test cricket, which is famously labelled as the 'Baz Ball', \"exciting\" but has questioned its sustainability. Following the 4-0 loss in The Ashes Down Under last summer, England have bounced back in style under new Test coach Brendon ('Baz') McCullum, producing four consecutive 250-plus fourth-innings totals at astonishing run-rates. The English side has won all their four games under the new coach and captain McCullum and Ben Stokes. They kickstarted the English summer with a 3-0 whitewash of World Test Championship (WTC) winners New Zealand. After that, they defeated a star-studded India by seven wickets in the rescheduled fifth Test to draw the five-match series 2-2. \"Guys just keep joking about it – I think Ronnie (Australia's coach Andrew McDonald) has had enough of hearing about 'Baz-ball' to be honest – it's good fun to joke about,\" a laughing Smith said after he finally finished his net session on Wednesday, according to cricket.com.au. Despite Australia chasing their consecutive series wins in Asia for the first time in 16 years, it is England that are in the limelight. \"It's been exciting. I'm just intrigued to see how long it lasts if it's sustainable. If you come in on a wicket that's got some grass on it and Josh Hazlewood, (Pat) Cummins, and (Mitchell) Starc are rolling in at you, is it going to be the same? I'm intrigued by it all … Is it going to work every time? I don't know,\" added Smith. With another edition of The Ashes due to be played next year, the Aussies are keeping a close watch on their arch-rivals. Speaking about Root, who recently recorded his 29th Test century, one more than Smith, the Australian batsman said,\" He's played a few more Tests than me!\" Root averages 50.76 having played 121 Tests, while Smith has a superior average of 59.37 having played just 86 Tests. Last week, Australia thrashed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets at Galle International Stadium in the first Test, which could have ended in two days if not for rain. \"We went at a good pace in the first Test – if you were sitting there not playing your shots or looking to score, you were probably going to get out eventually. So it was 'get them before they get us',\" said Smith, who just managed to score six as Australia did not bat for the second time in the first Test. A post shared by Steve Smith (@steve_smith49) Steve Smith: I hate getting run out Smith's innings came to an early end in Galle after a mix-up with opening batsman Usman Khawaja that saw the former get run out. \"I hate getting run out. I think anyone does, particularly given the conditions and just gifting them a wicket, one of the most experienced players. I was pretty upset. That happens in the game, I got over it pretty quickly, had to keep moving forward and that's part of the game. \"I spoke to 'Uz' straight after, it was pretty chilled, so mix-ups happen and we keep moving on,\" added Smith, who did not shy to show his anger to Khawaja on the field when the mix-up happened. The second Test between Australia and Sri Lanka, which is also going to be played in Galle, is scheduled to begin on Friday (June 8). Pat Cummins and Co are 1-0 up in the two-match Test series.","pubDate":"2022-07-06 15:14:09","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/07/06/500x300_1301543-steve-smith.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"\"Like Keeping Your Ferrari Parked In Garage\": Ex-India Selector On Edgbaston Test Playing XI - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9lbmdsYW5kLXZzLWluZGlhLTIwMjIvbGlrZS1rZWVwaW5nLXlvdXItZmVycmFyaS1wYXJrZWQtaW4tZ2FyYWdlLWV4LWluZGlhLXNlbGVjdG9yLW9uLWVkZ2Jhc3Rvbi10ZXN0LXBsYXlpbmcteGktMzEzMzk4N9IBlQFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9lbmdsYW5kLXZzLWluZGlhLTIwMjIvbGlrZS1rZWVwaW5nLXlvdXItZmVycmFyaS1wYXJrZWQtaW4tZ2FyYWdlLWV4LWluZGlhLXNlbGVjdG9yLW9uLWVkZ2Jhc3Rvbi10ZXN0LXBsYXlpbmcteGktMzEzMzk4Ny9hbXAvMQ?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"\"Like Keeping Your Ferrari Parked In Garage\": Ex-India Selector On Edgbaston Test Playing XI  NDTV Sports'Never thought I would say it but…': Lloyd on what 'cost' India Test vs England  Hindustan TimesDid India Miss Ravichandran Ashwin And Failed to Choose Right Combination at Edgbaston?  News18Sarfaraz Khan Should Be Given An Opportunity, Shubman Gill Should Be Tried In Middle Order: Wasim Jaffer  Cricket AddictorENG v IND, 5th Test | India looked flat on Day 5 morning, belief to pull it off wasn’t there: Ravi Shastri  India TodayView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-06 15:05:44","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"AndyHire Evening League leaders Folkton & Flixton earn victory at Heslerton","link":"https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/sport/cricket/andyhire-evening-league-leaders-folkton-flixton-earn-victory-at-heslerton-3758637","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["Andy Bloomfield"],"video_url":null,"description":"Folkton & Flixton remained top of the Scarborough & District Evening Cricket League Division A after their 20-run win at Heslerton.","content":"Josh Branch bagged two wickets for Folkton & Flixton Opener Jadon Wilson hit 30 and Jake Hatton 30no as Flixton posted 99-8 from 12 overs, Harry Edwards bagging 3-19 and Kristian Wilkinson and Matty Webster taking two wickets apiece.
