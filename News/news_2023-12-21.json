Alyssa Healy calls the coin correctly in her first official outing as Captain and she decides to have first use of the Wankhede pitch. 25m ago 22.34 EST Preamble James Wallace Hello and welcome to a slice of modern cricketing history. Despite all of the progress across the women’s game over the last few years, Test matches are still largely rarer than hen’s dentures. This game at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is a case in point - it has been nigh on forty years since India hosted Australia in a women’s Test match on home soil, a time long before any of the players in the current squads were born. That four Test series way back in 1984 ( nineteeneightyfourrrr ) ended in a stalemate and the two nations last duked it out in the longest format in Carrara in 2021, a day/night Test with a pink ball that also ended in a draw. And yet, despite what I’ve just typed, Harmanpreet’s India face the challenge of playing the mighty Australia under a new leader -Meg Lanning has handed the gilded reins to Alyssa Healy - just four days after completing a Test match on home soil against England. The Test against England was a thumping victory for the home side but this contest promises to be a whole lot tighter. Healy is looking to start a new era of dominance across formats for the green and gold and gave a perky press conference a day out from the start of the match that showed no signs of nerves whilst paying homage to her predecessor: They are unbelievably huge shoes to fill in replacing Meg Lanning,” Healy said yesterday. “The success she had as not only a player but as a leader of the Australian cricket team is fairly unmatched right around the men’s and women’s game. Big shoes to fill on my part but one that’s really exciting to me. Bring it on, India is a big challenge!” India have the advantage of home conditions but Australia are no slouches in the spin department with the likes of Ash Gardner, Jess Jonassen and Alana King at their disposal. The match offers up an intriguing battle between two gun sides tussling for a rare (and standalone) red ball gong ahead of the six white ball matches that make up the multi-format aspect of the tour to come over the coming weeks. I’m here with you for the first half of the day before Tanya swoops in to guide you home later. Play gets underway at 9.30am local time which is an eyebag inducing 4am (!) here in London. I’ll be back shortly, likely jacked up on caffeine, to bring you news of the teams and the toss.

Our job is to combat that,” Australia vice captain Tahlia McGrath said about her opponent ahead of their clash in the one-off Test which begins on Thursday. That kind of ruthlessness does not happen overnight, especially for a side that until recently was emerging from the shadow of two of the biggest personalities to ever play the game - Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami - more the latter in case of the bowling arsenal. “It’s a big difference in height to start with and we can’t fill those shoes. To fill that gap, it’s going to take time,” India’s bowling coach Troy Cooley said in the run-up to the Test. Goswami, even at 39 (how old she was when she retired), spearheaded India’s pace attack. She took charge with the new ball and her testing line and length often left opponents rooted to the crease. She enjoyed tempting batters around the off stump, her height allowing her to generate extra bounce. Her cutters and yorkers made for great highlight reel fodder and she finished her career with a massive haul of milestones to her name. So how do young bowlers, who have perhaps been alive only as long as Goswami actively played international cricket, take on the utterly unenviable task of carrying forward a team after her? A day before India took on England in the one-off Test at Navi Mumbai, the side had a busy practice session. While the batters got down to their warmups and routines rather swiftly, the bowling core was huddled up around coach Troy Cooley. Over 30 minutes went by, but the huddle was as tight as ever. Cooley then emerged with a piece of paper too tiny for reporters to decode even with the best binoculars in the press box. The spinners followed Cooley, primarily a pace bowling coach, followed the notes pinned to the nets and went about their drills. The former Aussie pacer was rarely left alone. The players, from Rajeshwari Gayakwad to Renuka Singh Thakur, went up to him with notes on the run-up, angles and lines. It was an academic pursuit from head to tail that went on for the course of India’s training schedule, not just on said day, but through the course of the Test match. “For me to be able to come in as a bowling coach and work with more spinners than seamers was a challenge when I entered the job,” Cooley said sheepishly ahead of the one-off Test against Australia. “However, I thoroughly loved it. I am learning a lot from the spinners. We’ve got a lot of good spin coaches at the National Cricket Academy who are happy to share ideas and I am happy to learn on the job. The bowling unit here works very well together. The bowlers are very selfless in how they look to match plans,” the 58-year-old explained. Perhaps having a teacher who is keen and visibly excited to learn helps this pack, looking to flesh out a fresh legacy under skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. Deepti Sharma, after her five-wicket haul on day two, credited bowling partnerships for her success. There was a time when she was the spin half of the new ball rotation alongside Goswami or more recently Renuka. In the Test against England, she was Harmanpreet’s final bowling change, getting the ball only in the 26th over. She made up for lost time, taking her maiden Test fifer in five and a half overs. Deepti had Sneh Rana constantly in her ear, giving her inputs on how the wicket behaved when she had the ball and what worked and didn’t work for her. They identified a set number of patches along the wicket and bowled into those areas to generate maximum turn. This wasn’t an all-spin gala. In England’s second innings, Pooja Vastrakar decided to make the day her own. While Renuka has been India’s first-choice new ball bowler, Vastrakar made a case for her to be given more seam bowling responsibility early on with a vicious spell that helped India wrap up the English innings in the first half of day three. Her evolution makes her former coach WV Raman beam with pride. While commentating, Raman spoke about how Pooja’s control over the ball got better when the shine came off, which could be why Harmanpreet held off for a bit before unleashing her on a down-and-out visiting side. “Pooja, I felt, has always been a reluctant lead bowler. The performances show otherwise. She needs to put in the work consistently and also comes to terms with the fact mentally that she has all the makings of a lead bowler. Look at how she dismissed two of the best batters in the women’s game right now - Heather Knight and Nat Sciver Brunt,” Raman told after the Test. Cooley, like everyone else who has been following her career trajectory for a while, alludes her confidence to better fitness. “Pooja had a sore knee. She came back well through rehab. She worked on improving her run-up and got the most of it. Now she’s more balanced at the crease. She’s getting a more natural tendency to get into the stumps and trouble the batters. She’s got enough pace and variations to be a good red ball bowler,” Cooley said. The Australian also has praise for Renuka, who dismantled England with key dismissals in the top order to get the ball rolling for the rest of the foot soldiers to finish the job. Renuka tends to be reliant on angling the ball into and away from the batter but Cooley believes her tool box has gotten a bit bigger. “Not only does she swing the ball back in naturally, but now she also has a ball that straightens and a ball that leaves the right hander. It’s great to see her using angles. I like how she’s putting together her deliveries. Her tool box is quite big now but she’s certainly using those tools in a strategic and tactical manner,” Cooley explained. Pooja Vastrakar | Photo Credit: Sportzpics for BCCI Once the Test was one and hands were shaken, the Indian contingent’s celebrations truly began. Fans went up for autographs, family members stood around documenting and soaking in every moment. Meanwhile, Cooley had quietly started assembling his band of bowlers. Those who played, those who didn’t were all rounded up for a ‘bowlers’ photograph. Wide smiles, bear hugs and poses of different kinds followed. Picture perfect as those prints maybe, the biggest takeaway for this side will be the workings of a well-oiled machine primed to march on with confidence. That will help, given India now goes up against Australia which can field up to nine bowling options if it requires. The Aussies may not prove to be as much of a pushover as England did, but Cooley knows better than to over or underestimate his opponent and his own contingent. “Whenever someone says never to me, I always think we can do the opposite,” the coach said, as Aussie as ever! Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in The Jungle Book, “For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.” From an organised coaching setup and clear plans for oneself and who one goes against, to remarkably talented individuals who are eager to use every opportunity to push the peripheries of a game a little further than it was, India is more than ready to challenge the traditional rulers of the wild and perhaps even win.

It looked as if they had bought the ‘wrong player’. The IPL franchise had bought uncapped 32-year-old batting all-rounder Shashank Singh, but it might not have been intentional. When the next player was called, the franchise appeared to raise an issue with auctioneer Mallika Sagar, but were told the bid had already been done, and could not be altered. Those behind the Punjab Kings looked as though they had mistaken Shashank for someone else, nevertheless, he is set to join up with the franchise for a base price of 20 lakh (around £19,000). When Shashank’s name came up, Preity Zinta raised the paddle following a quick discussion with her team, as no other franchise bid for him, the hammer came down and he was sold. The IPL team issued a statement saying it was only a matter of confusion, posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying: “Punjab Kings would like to clarify that Shashank Singh was always on our target list. The confusion was due to 2 players of the same name being on the list. We are delighted to have him on board and see him contribute to our success.” Punjab Kings raised the issue, but the auctioneer stood firm, insisting that the hammer came down and the player has been added to the team roster. It might have been the ‘mini auction’ with just 77 spots left to fill, the bigger auction with more available places is not due to take place until ahead of the 2025 tournament, but there was no shortage of interest. It was a lengthy process and the record fee for a cricketer was broken not once but twice in quick succession, first by Sunrisers Hyderabad signing Pat Cummins, then Mitchell Starc to the Kolkata Knight Riders for £2.3m. Starc had not played in the competition for eight years, but after an intense round of bidding the fee was paid, and the IPL moved further away from the competition of other franchise leagues. The IPL has been valued as the second-most valuable sporting league in the world, behind the NFL, beating even the Premier League.","pubDate":"2023-12-21 03:45:09","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/12/20/11/GettyImages-95871758.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ea91481581cfa319c469937952468481","title":"Milestone man Hughes targets more BBL, Shield recall","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/milestone-man-hughes-targets-more-bbl-shield-recall-c-12979389","keywords":null,"creator":["Jasper Bruce"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sydney Sixers veteran Daniel Hughes is on the cusp of playing his 100th BBL game and is hopeful some good form in his milestone match bodes well for the future.","content":"Daniel Hughes hopes his 100th BBL game can be another step towards retaining a regular spot in the Sydney Sixers' best XI and forcing his way back into the NSW Sheffield Shield side. When the Sixers host the Adelaide Strikers on Friday, the 34-year-old batter will become the 16th man to reach 100 BBL games, having debuted for the Sixers in the summer of 2012/13. Hughes was a member of the Sixers sides that won the BBL final in 2020 and 2021, but it has not all been smooth sailing for the left-handed opener. Hughes found himself without a contract after a two-year stint with the Sydney Thunder ended in 2015 and was the odd man out at the selection table last summer, playing only three BBL games. But with an unbeaten 60, Hughes guided the Sixers to victory over the Hobart Hurricanes in their last start, his first match of the tournament. Hughes is hopeful that knock, and another big one in his milestone match, can help him become a regular of the XI once again this summer. \"I think so,\" Hughes said. \"With this club, there's always good players sitting on the bench or waiting to come in. \"So every time you go out there, you try and perform at your best. I've just got to keep trying to score runs and do what I can for the team. \"I know last year was frustrating for me, not being in the team. \"'Shippy' (coach Greg Shipperd) and Moises (Henriques, Sixers captain) would come to me at every game and say, 'Look, we haven't found a spot for you this game but always be ready'. \"Even last game, 'Moey' got a little bit emotional when I came back in the team. He just said, 'I'm glad to see you do well, you're always team-first, you do anything you can for the team'.\" Hughes is hopeful he can parlay good BBL form into a recall for the Blues, who dropped him for the last game before the Sheffield Shield went on break. \"I'll definitely be using the Big Bash to score runs and try get back in the Shield team,\" he said. A Cowra kid who made good in the big smoke, Hughes said reaching 100 games in the BBL was \"a dream come true\". \"Even when I moved to Sydney I didn't think I was coming down here to play professional cricket,\" he said. \"I was a greenkeeper to start with, I just moved down here to see how far I could go in club cricket and play first grade. \"I'm just honoured to put this shirt on.\"","pubDate":"2023-12-21 03:37:40","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-12979389/11f9df4751433cd5499c1a122771a2ccbeb4a1a5-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3e36f1bff461cd7d77db70708139025c","title":"Rahul Dravid Son: राहुल द्रविड़ के बेटे समित ने बिखेरा जलवा, अंडर-19 की इस ट्रॉफी में खेल दी 98 रनों की पारी","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/rahul-dravid-son-samit-playing-under-19-cooch-behar-trophy-2023-24-from-karnataka-and-scored-98-runs-against-jammu-and-kashmir-2565606","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["मोहम्मद अलफैज"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Samit Dravid In Cooch Behar Trophy 2023-24:</strong> भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के पूर्व दिग्गज बल्लेबाज़ और मौजूदा हेड कोच राहुल द्रविड़ अपने शानदार खेल के लिए दुनियाभर में जाने जाते थे. अब उनका बेटा समित क्रिकेट के मैदान पर पिता के नक्शे कदम पर चलता हुआ दिख रहा है. समित इन दिनों बीसीसीआई की ओर से आयोजित अंडर-19 कूच बेहार ट्रॉफी खेल रहे हैं. समित टूर्नामेंट में कर्नाटक टीम का हिस्सा हैं. टूर्नामेंट में जम्मू एंड कश्मीर के खिलाफ खेले गए मुकाबले में समित ने 98 रनों की पारी खेली और टीम को जीत दिलाने में योगदान दिया.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">जम्मू एंड कश्मीर के खिलाफ खेले गए मुकाबले में समित ने 159 गेंदों में 98 रन स्कोर किए, जिसमें 13 चौके और 1 छक्का शामिल रहा. हालांकि समित शतक से चूक गए. मुकाबला जम्मू कश्मीर के होस्टल ग्राउंड पर खेला गया, जिसमें कर्नाटक ने बेहद ही शानदार जीत दर्ज की.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">मेज़बान जम्मू एंड कश्मीर ने एक पारी और 130 रनों से मुकाबला गंवाया. मैच में पहले बैटिंग करते हुए जम्मू एंड कश्मीर की टीम 170 रनों पर ऑलआउट हो गई. इसके बाद पहली पारी में बैटिंग के उतरी कर्नाटक की टीम ने 5 विकेट पर 480 रन बनाए और पारी घोषित कर दी. फिर दूसरी पारी के लिए उतरी जम्मू एंड कश्मीर 130 रनों पर ही ऑलआउट हो गई. इस तरह कर्नाटक ने सिर्फ एक पारी खेल जम्मू एंड कश्मीर को एक पारी और 130 रनों से हराया.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>समित की बैटिंग की वायरल हुई वीडियो</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">सोशल मीडिया पर समित की बैटिंग की वीडियो तेज़ी से वायरल हो रही है, जिसमें वो कुछ बेहद ही खूबसूरत शॉट्स खेलते हुए दिख रहे हैं. बैटिंग में समित का अंदाज़ काफी क्लासिक और सूझबूझ वाला दिख रहा है. वीडियो में समित एकदम शांत अंदाज़ में बैटिंग कर रहे हैं.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Samit Dravid, Rahul Dravid&rsquo;s son, at Jammu while playing for Karnataka in Cooch Behar Trophy (U19) against J&amp;K.

When the Sixers host the Adelaide Strikers on Friday, the 34-year-old batter will become the 16th man to reach 100 BBL games, having debuted for the Sixers in the summer of 2012/13. Hughes was a member of the Sixers sides that won the BBL final in 2020 and 2021, but it has not all been smooth sailing for the left-handed opener. Hughes found himself without a contract after a two-year stint with the Sydney Thunder ended in 2015 and was the odd man out at the selection table last summer, playing only three BBL games. But with an unbeaten 60, Hughes guided the Sixers to victory over the Hobart Hurricanes in their last start, his first match of the tournament. Hughes is hopeful that knock, and another big one in his milestone match, can help him become a regular of the XI once again this summer. \"I think so,\" Hughes said. \"With this club, there's always good players sitting on the bench or waiting to come in. \"So every time you go out there, you try and perform at your best.

However, No. 7 was unavailable for Gill at the time. “My jersey number is 77 and the reason behind getting the number 77 was, when I played the Under-19 World Cup, I wanted to take the number 7 but it was not available, so I took two 7s,” Gill told .

Singh, a slow left-arm orthodox spinner, had taken a couple of wickets in the final against Australia and helped India win the U-19 World Cup. However, at the highest level, Jersey Number 7 is more deeply attached to two-time World Cup winner .

No particular player from their squad that season used to wear Jersey Number 7. Had Gill wanted, he could’ve fulfilled his desire of wearing 7 back then.

Alyssa Healy calls the coin correctly in her first official outing as Captain and she decides to have first use of the Wankhede pitch. 25m ago 22.34 EST Preamble James Wallace Hello and welcome to a slice of modern cricketing history. Despite all of the progress across the women’s game over the last few years, Test matches are still largely rarer than hen’s dentures. This game at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is a case in point - it has been nigh on forty years since India hosted Australia in a women’s Test match on home soil, a time long before any of the players in the current squads were born. That four Test series way back in 1984 ( nineteeneightyfourrrr ) ended in a stalemate and the two nations last duked it out in the longest format in Carrara in 2021, a day/night Test with a pink ball that also ended in a draw. And yet, despite what I’ve just typed, Harmanpreet’s India face the challenge of playing the mighty Australia under a new leader -Meg Lanning has handed the gilded reins to Alyssa Healy - just four days after completing a Test match on home soil against England. The Test against England was a thumping victory for the home side but this contest promises to be a whole lot tighter. Healy is looking to start a new era of dominance across formats for the green and gold and gave a perky press conference a day out from the start of the match that showed no signs of nerves whilst paying homage to her predecessor: They are unbelievably huge shoes to fill in replacing Meg Lanning,” Healy said yesterday. “The success she had as not only a player but as a leader of the Australian cricket team is fairly unmatched right around the men’s and women’s game. Big shoes to fill on my part but one that’s really exciting to me. Bring it on, India is a big challenge!” India have the advantage of home conditions but Australia are no slouches in the spin department with the likes of Ash Gardner, Jess Jonassen and Alana King at their disposal. The match offers up an intriguing battle between two gun sides tussling for a rare (and standalone) red ball gong ahead of the six white ball matches that make up the multi-format aspect of the tour to come over the coming weeks. I’m here with you for the first half of the day before Tanya swoops in to guide you home later. Play gets underway at 9.30am local time which is an eyebag inducing 4am (!) here in London.

Our job is to combat that,” Australia vice captain Tahlia McGrath said about her opponent ahead of their clash in the one-off Test which begins on Thursday. That kind of ruthlessness does not happen overnight, especially for a side that until recently was emerging from the shadow of two of the biggest personalities to ever play the game - Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami - more the latter in case of the bowling arsenal. “It’s a big difference in height to start with and we can’t fill those shoes. To fill that gap, it’s going to take time,” India’s bowling coach Troy Cooley said in the run-up to the Test. Goswami, even at 39 (how old she was when she retired), spearheaded India’s pace attack. She took charge with the new ball and her testing line and length often left opponents rooted to the crease. She enjoyed tempting batters around the off stump, her height allowing her to generate extra bounce. Her cutters and yorkers made for great highlight reel fodder and she finished her career with a massive haul of milestones to her name. So how do young bowlers, who have perhaps been alive only as long as Goswami actively played international cricket, take on the utterly unenviable task of carrying forward a team after her? A day before India took on England in the one-off Test at Navi Mumbai, the side had a busy practice session. While the batters got down to their warmups and routines rather swiftly, the bowling core was huddled up around coach Troy Cooley. Over 30 minutes went by, but the huddle was as tight as ever. Cooley then emerged with a piece of paper too tiny for reporters to decode even with the best binoculars in the press box. The spinners followed Cooley, primarily a pace bowling coach, followed the notes pinned to the nets and went about their drills. The former Aussie pacer was rarely left alone. The players, from Rajeshwari Gayakwad to Renuka Singh Thakur, went up to him with notes on the run-up, angles and lines. It was an academic pursuit from head to tail that went on for the course of India’s training schedule, not just on said day, but through the course of the Test match. “For me to be able to come in as a bowling coach and work with more spinners than seamers was a challenge when I entered the job,” Cooley said sheepishly ahead of the one-off Test against Australia. “However, I thoroughly loved it. I am learning a lot from the spinners. We’ve got a lot of good spin coaches at the National Cricket Academy who are happy to share ideas and I am happy to learn on the job. The bowling unit here works very well together. The bowlers are very selfless in how they look to match plans,” the 58-year-old explained. Perhaps having a teacher who is keen and visibly excited to learn helps this pack, looking to flesh out a fresh legacy under skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. Deepti Sharma, after her five-wicket haul on day two, credited bowling partnerships for her success. There was a time when she was the spin half of the new ball rotation alongside Goswami or more recently Renuka. In the Test against England, she was Harmanpreet’s final bowling change, getting the ball only in the 26th over. She made up for lost time, taking her maiden Test fifer in five and a half overs. Deepti had Sneh Rana constantly in her ear, giving her inputs on how the wicket behaved when she had the ball and what worked and didn’t work for her. They identified a set number of patches along the wicket and bowled into those areas to generate maximum turn. This wasn’t an all-spin gala. In England’s second innings, Pooja Vastrakar decided to make the day her own. While Renuka has been India’s first-choice new ball bowler, Vastrakar made a case for her to be given more seam bowling responsibility early on with a vicious spell that helped India wrap up the English innings in the first half of day three. Her evolution makes her former coach WV Raman beam with pride. While commentating, Raman spoke about how Pooja’s control over the ball got better when the shine came off, which could be why Harmanpreet held off for a bit before unleashing her on a down-and-out visiting side. “Pooja, I felt, has always been a reluctant lead bowler. The performances show otherwise. She needs to put in the work consistently and also comes to terms with the fact mentally that she has all the makings of a lead bowler. Look at how she dismissed two of the best batters in the women’s game right now - Heather Knight and Nat Sciver Brunt,” Raman told after the Test. Cooley, like everyone else who has been following her career trajectory for a while, alludes her confidence to better fitness. “Pooja had a sore knee. She came back well through rehab. She worked on improving her run-up and got the most of it. Now she’s more balanced at the crease. She’s getting a more natural tendency to get into the stumps and trouble the batters. She’s got enough pace and variations to be a good red ball bowler,” Cooley said. The Australian also has praise for Renuka, who dismantled England with key dismissals in the top order to get the ball rolling for the rest of the foot soldiers to finish the job. Renuka tends to be reliant on angling the ball into and away from the batter but Cooley believes her tool box has gotten a bit bigger. “Not only does she swing the ball back in naturally, but now she also has a ball that straightens and a ball that leaves the right hander. It’s great to see her using angles. I like how she’s putting together her deliveries. Her tool box is quite big now but she’s certainly using those tools in a strategic and tactical manner,” Cooley explained. Pooja Vastrakar | Photo Credit: Sportzpics for BCCI Once the Test was one and hands were shaken, the Indian contingent’s celebrations truly began. Fans went up for autographs, family members stood around documenting and soaking in every moment. Meanwhile, Cooley had quietly started assembling his band of bowlers. Those who played, those who didn’t were all rounded up for a ‘bowlers’ photograph. Wide smiles, bear hugs and poses of different kinds followed. Picture perfect as those prints maybe, the biggest takeaway for this side will be the workings of a well-oiled machine primed to march on with confidence. That will help, given India now goes up against Australia which can field up to nine bowling options if it requires. The Aussies may not prove to be as much of a pushover as England did, but Cooley knows better than to over or underestimate his opponent and his own contingent. “Whenever someone says never to me, I always think we can do the opposite,” the coach said, as Aussie as ever! Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in The Jungle Book, “For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.” From an organised coaching setup and clear plans for oneself and who one goes against, to remarkably talented individuals who are eager to use every opportunity to push the peripheries of a game a little further than it was, India is more than ready to challenge the traditional rulers of the wild and perhaps even win.

It looked as if they had bought the ‘wrong player’. The IPL franchise had bought uncapped 32-year-old batting all-rounder Shashank Singh, but it might not have been intentional. When the next player was called, the franchise appeared to raise an issue with auctioneer Mallika Sagar, but were told the bid had already been done, and could not be altered. Those behind the Punjab Kings looked as though they had mistaken Shashank for someone else, nevertheless, he is set to join up with the franchise for a base price of 20 lakh (around £19,000). When Shashank’s name came up, Preity Zinta raised the paddle following a quick discussion with her team, as no other franchise bid for him, the hammer came down and he was sold. The IPL team issued a statement saying it was only a matter of confusion, posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying: “Punjab Kings would like to clarify that Shashank Singh was always on our target list. The confusion was due to 2 players of the same name being on the list. We are delighted to have him on board and see him contribute to our success.” Punjab Kings raised the issue, but the auctioneer stood firm, insisting that the hammer came down and the player has been added to the team roster. It might have been the ‘mini auction’ with just 77 spots left to fill, the bigger auction with more available places is not due to take place until ahead of the 2025 tournament, but there was no shortage of interest. It was a lengthy process and the record fee for a cricketer was broken not once but twice in quick succession, first by Sunrisers Hyderabad signing Pat Cummins, then Mitchell Starc to the Kolkata Knight Riders for £2.3m. Starc had not played in the competition for eight years, but after an intense round of bidding the fee was paid, and the IPL moved further away from the competition of other franchise leagues. The IPL has been valued as the second-most valuable sporting league in the world, behind the NFL, beating even the Premier League.","pubDate":"2023-12-21 03:45:09","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/12/20/11/GettyImages-95871758.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ea91481581cfa319c469937952468481","title":"Milestone man Hughes targets more BBL, Shield recall","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/milestone-man-hughes-targets-more-bbl-shield-recall-c-12979389","keywords":null,"creator":["Jasper Bruce"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sydney Sixers veteran Daniel Hughes is on the cusp of playing his 100th BBL game and is hopeful some good form in his milestone match bodes well for the future.","content":"Daniel Hughes hopes his 100th BBL game can be another step towards retaining a regular spot in the Sydney Sixers' best XI and forcing his way back into the NSW Sheffield Shield side. When the Sixers host the Adelaide Strikers on Friday, the 34-year-old batter will become the 16th man to reach 100 BBL games, having debuted for the Sixers in the summer of 2012/13. Hughes was a member of the Sixers sides that won the BBL final in 2020 and 2021, but it has not all been smooth sailing for the left-handed opener. Hughes found himself without a contract after a two-year stint with the Sydney Thunder ended in 2015 and was the odd man out at the selection table last summer, playing only three BBL games. But with an unbeaten 60, Hughes guided the Sixers to victory over the Hobart Hurricanes in their last start, his first match of the tournament. Hughes is hopeful that knock, and another big one in his milestone match, can help him become a regular of the XI once again this summer. \"I think so,\" Hughes said. \"With this club, there's always good players sitting on the bench or waiting to come in. \"So every time you go out there, you try and perform at your best. I've just got to keep trying to score runs and do what I can for the team. \"I know last year was frustrating for me, not being in the team. \"'Shippy' (coach Greg Shipperd) and Moises (Henriques, Sixers captain) would come to me at every game and say, 'Look, we haven't found a spot for you this game but always be ready'. \"Even last game, 'Moey' got a little bit emotional when I came back in the team. He just said, 'I'm glad to see you do well, you're always team-first, you do anything you can for the team'.\" Hughes is hopeful he can parlay good BBL form into a recall for the Blues, who dropped him for the last game before the Sheffield Shield went on break. \"I'll definitely be using the Big Bash to score runs and try get back in the Shield team,\" he said. A Cowra kid who made good in the big smoke, Hughes said reaching 100 games in the BBL was \"a dream come true\". \"Even when I moved to Sydney I didn't think I was coming down here to play professional cricket,\" he said. \"I was a greenkeeper to start with, I just moved down here to see how far I could go in club cricket and play first grade. \"I'm just honoured to put this shirt on.\"","pubDate":"2023-12-21 03:37:40","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-12979389/11f9df4751433cd5499c1a122771a2ccbeb4a1a5-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3e36f1bff461cd7d77db70708139025c","title":"Rahul Dravid Son: राहुल द्रविड़ के बेटे समित ने बिखेरा जलवा, अंडर-19 की इस ट्रॉफी में खेल दी 98 रनों की पारी","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/rahul-dravid-son-samit-playing-under-19-cooch-behar-trophy-2023-24-from-karnataka-and-scored-98-runs-against-jammu-and-kashmir-2565606","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["मोहम्मद अलफैज"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Samit Dravid In Cooch Behar Trophy 2023-24:</strong> भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम के पूर्व दिग्गज बल्लेबाज़ और मौजूदा हेड कोच राहुल द्रविड़ अपने शानदार खेल के लिए दुनियाभर में जाने जाते थे. अब उनका बेटा समित क्रिकेट के मैदान पर पिता के नक्शे कदम पर चलता हुआ दिख रहा है. समित इन दिनों बीसीसीआई की ओर से आयोजित अंडर-19 कूच बेहार ट्रॉफी खेल रहे हैं. समित टूर्नामेंट में कर्नाटक टीम का हिस्सा हैं. टूर्नामेंट में जम्मू एंड कश्मीर के खिलाफ खेले गए मुकाबले में समित ने 98 रनों की पारी खेली और टीम को जीत दिलाने में योगदान दिया.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">जम्मू एंड कश्मीर के खिलाफ खेले गए मुकाबले में समित ने 159 गेंदों में 98 रन स्कोर किए, जिसमें 13 चौके और 1 छक्का शामिल रहा. हालांकि समित शतक से चूक गए. मुकाबला जम्मू कश्मीर के होस्टल ग्राउंड पर खेला गया, जिसमें कर्नाटक ने बेहद ही शानदार जीत दर्ज की.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">मेज़बान जम्मू एंड कश्मीर ने एक पारी और 130 रनों से मुकाबला गंवाया. मैच में पहले बैटिंग करते हुए जम्मू एंड कश्मीर की टीम 170 रनों पर ऑलआउट हो गई. इसके बाद पहली पारी में बैटिंग के उतरी कर्नाटक की टीम ने 5 विकेट पर 480 रन बनाए और पारी घोषित कर दी. फिर दूसरी पारी के लिए उतरी जम्मू एंड कश्मीर 130 रनों पर ही ऑलआउट हो गई. इस तरह कर्नाटक ने सिर्फ एक पारी खेल जम्मू एंड कश्मीर को एक पारी और 130 रनों से हराया.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>समित की बैटिंग की वायरल हुई वीडियो</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">सोशल मीडिया पर समित की बैटिंग की वीडियो तेज़ी से वायरल हो रही है, जिसमें वो कुछ बेहद ही खूबसूरत शॉट्स खेलते हुए दिख रहे हैं. बैटिंग में समित का अंदाज़ काफी क्लासिक और सूझबूझ वाला दिख रहा है. वीडियो में समित एकदम शांत अंदाज़ में बैटिंग कर रहे हैं.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Samit Dravid, Rahul Dravid&rsquo;s son, at Jammu while playing for Karnataka in Cooch Behar Trophy (U19) against J&amp;K.

Following a successful U-19 World Cup campaign, Gill continued wearing his jersey number 77 at the time of his IPL debut for KKR in 2018. No particular player from their squad that season used to wear Jersey Number 7. Had Gill wanted, he could’ve fulfilled his desire of wearing 7 back then. However, he simply carried on with Jersey Number 77 because of his accomplishments at the U-19 level.

Alyssa Healy calls the coin correctly in her first official outing as Captain and she decides to have first use of the Wankhede pitch. 25m ago 22.34 EST Preamble James Wallace Hello and welcome to a slice of modern cricketing history. Despite all of the progress across the women’s game over the last few years, Test matches are still largely rarer than hen’s dentures. This game at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is a case in point - it has been nigh on forty years since India hosted Australia in a women’s Test match on home soil, a time long before any of the players in the current squads were born. That four Test series way back in 1984 ( nineteeneightyfourrrr ) ended in a stalemate and the two nations last duked it out in the longest format in Carrara in 2021, a day/night Test with a pink ball that also ended in a draw. And yet, despite what I’ve just typed, Harmanpreet’s India face the challenge of playing the mighty Australia under a new leader -Meg Lanning has handed the gilded reins to Alyssa Healy - just four days after completing a Test match on home soil against England. The Test against England was a thumping victory for the home side but this contest promises to be a whole lot tighter. Healy is looking to start a new era of dominance across formats for the green and gold and gave a perky press conference a day out from the start of the match that showed no signs of nerves whilst paying homage to her predecessor: They are unbelievably huge shoes to fill in replacing Meg Lanning,” Healy said yesterday. “The success she had as not only a player but as a leader of the Australian cricket team is fairly unmatched right around the men’s and women’s game. Big shoes to fill on my part but one that’s really exciting to me. Bring it on, India is a big challenge!” India have the advantage of home conditions but Australia are no slouches in the spin department with the likes of Ash Gardner, Jess Jonassen and Alana King at their disposal. The match offers up an intriguing battle between two gun sides tussling for a rare (and standalone) red ball gong ahead of the six white ball matches that make up the multi-format aspect of the tour to come over the coming weeks. I’m here with you for the first half of the day before Tanya swoops in to guide you home later. Play gets underway at 9.30am local time which is an eyebag inducing 4am (!) here in London. I’ll be back shortly, likely jacked up on caffeine, to bring you news of the teams and the toss.

Our job is to combat that,” Australia vice captain Tahlia McGrath said about her opponent ahead of their clash in the one-off Test which begins on Thursday. That kind of ruthlessness does not happen overnight, especially for a side that until recently was emerging from the shadow of two of the biggest personalities to ever play the game - Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami - more the latter in case of the bowling arsenal. “It’s a big difference in height to start with and we can’t fill those shoes. To fill that gap, it’s going to take time,” India’s bowling coach Troy Cooley said in the run-up to the Test. Goswami, even at 39 (how old she was when she retired), spearheaded India’s pace attack. She took charge with the new ball and her testing line and length often left opponents rooted to the crease. She enjoyed tempting batters around the off stump, her height allowing her to generate extra bounce. Her cutters and yorkers made for great highlight reel fodder and she finished her career with a massive haul of milestones to her name. So how do young bowlers, who have perhaps been alive only as long as Goswami actively played international cricket, take on the utterly unenviable task of carrying forward a team after her? A day before India took on England in the one-off Test at Navi Mumbai, the side had a busy practice session. While the batters got down to their warmups and routines rather swiftly, the bowling core was huddled up around coach Troy Cooley. Over 30 minutes went by, but the huddle was as tight as ever. Cooley then emerged with a piece of paper too tiny for reporters to decode even with the best binoculars in the press box. The spinners followed Cooley, primarily a pace bowling coach, followed the notes pinned to the nets and went about their drills. The former Aussie pacer was rarely left alone. The players, from Rajeshwari Gayakwad to Renuka Singh Thakur, went up to him with notes on the run-up, angles and lines. It was an academic pursuit from head to tail that went on for the course of India’s training schedule, not just on said day, but through the course of the Test match. “For me to be able to come in as a bowling coach and work with more spinners than seamers was a challenge when I entered the job,” Cooley said sheepishly ahead of the one-off Test against Australia. “However, I thoroughly loved it. I am learning a lot from the spinners. We’ve got a lot of good spin coaches at the National Cricket Academy who are happy to share ideas and I am happy to learn on the job. The bowling unit here works very well together. The bowlers are very selfless in how they look to match plans,” the 58-year-old explained. Perhaps having a teacher who is keen and visibly excited to learn helps this pack, looking to flesh out a fresh legacy under skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. Deepti Sharma, after her five-wicket haul on day two, credited bowling partnerships for her success. There was a time when she was the spin half of the new ball rotation alongside Goswami or more recently Renuka. In the Test against England, she was Harmanpreet’s final bowling change, getting the ball only in the 26th over. She made up for lost time, taking her maiden Test fifer in five and a half overs. Deepti had Sneh Rana constantly in her ear, giving her inputs on how the wicket behaved when she had the ball and what worked and didn’t work for her. They identified a set number of patches along the wicket and bowled into those areas to generate maximum turn. This wasn’t an all-spin gala. In England’s second innings, Pooja Vastrakar decided to make the day her own. While Renuka has been India’s first-choice new ball bowler, Vastrakar made a case for her to be given more seam bowling responsibility early on with a vicious spell that helped India wrap up the English innings in the first half of day three. Her evolution makes her former coach WV Raman beam with pride. While commentating, Raman spoke about how Pooja’s control over the ball got better when the shine came off, which could be why Harmanpreet held off for a bit before unleashing her on a down-and-out visiting side. “Pooja, I felt, has always been a reluctant lead bowler. The performances show otherwise. She needs to put in the work consistently and also comes to terms with the fact mentally that she has all the makings of a lead bowler. Look at how she dismissed two of the best batters in the women’s game right now - Heather Knight and Nat Sciver Brunt,” Raman told after the Test. Cooley, like everyone else who has been following her career trajectory for a while, alludes her confidence to better fitness. “Pooja had a sore knee. She came back well through rehab. She worked on improving her run-up and got the most of it. Now she’s more balanced at the crease. She’s getting a more natural tendency to get into the stumps and trouble the batters. She’s got enough pace and variations to be a good red ball bowler,” Cooley said. The Australian also has praise for Renuka, who dismantled England with key dismissals in the top order to get the ball rolling for the rest of the foot soldiers to finish the job. Renuka tends to be reliant on angling the ball into and away from the batter but Cooley believes her tool box has gotten a bit bigger. “Not only does she swing the ball back in naturally, but now she also has a ball that straightens and a ball that leaves the right hander. It’s great to see her using angles. I like how she’s putting together her deliveries. Her tool box is quite big now but she’s certainly using those tools in a strategic and tactical manner,” Cooley explained. Pooja Vastrakar | Photo Credit: Sportzpics for BCCI Once the Test was one and hands were shaken, the Indian contingent’s celebrations truly began. Fans went up for autographs, family members stood around documenting and soaking in every moment. Meanwhile, Cooley had quietly started assembling his band of bowlers. Those who played, those who didn’t were all rounded up for a ‘bowlers’ photograph. Wide smiles, bear hugs and poses of different kinds followed. Picture perfect as those prints maybe, the biggest takeaway for this side will be the workings of a well-oiled machine primed to march on with confidence. That will help, given India now goes up against Australia which can field up to nine bowling options if it requires. The Aussies may not prove to be as much of a pushover as England did, but Cooley knows better than to over or underestimate his opponent and his own contingent. “Whenever someone says never to me, I always think we can do the opposite,” the coach said, as Aussie as ever! Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in The Jungle Book, “For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.” From an organised coaching setup and clear plans for oneself and who one goes against, to remarkably talented individuals who are eager to use every opportunity to push the peripheries of a game a little further than it was, India is more than ready to challenge the traditional rulers of the wild and perhaps even win.

It looked as if they had bought the ‘wrong player’. The IPL franchise had bought uncapped 32-year-old batting all-rounder Shashank Singh, but it might not have been intentional. When the next player was called, the franchise appeared to raise an issue with auctioneer Mallika Sagar, but were told the bid had already been done, and could not be altered. Those behind the Punjab Kings looked as though they had mistaken Shashank for someone else, nevertheless, he is set to join up with the franchise for a base price of 20 lakh (around £19,000). When Shashank’s name came up, Preity Zinta raised the paddle following a quick discussion with her team, as no other franchise bid for him, the hammer came down and he was sold. The IPL team issued a statement saying it was only a matter of confusion, posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying: “Punjab Kings would like to clarify that Shashank Singh was always on our target list. The confusion was due to 2 players of the same name being on the list. We are delighted to have him on board and see him contribute to our success.” Punjab Kings raised the issue, but the auctioneer stood firm, insisting that the hammer came down and the player has been added to the team roster. It might have been the ‘mini auction’ with just 77 spots left to fill, the bigger auction with more available places is not due to take place until ahead of the 2025 tournament, but there was no shortage of interest. It was a lengthy process and the record fee for a cricketer was broken not once but twice in quick succession, first by Sunrisers Hyderabad signing Pat Cummins, then Mitchell Starc to the Kolkata Knight Riders for £2.3m. Starc had not played in the competition for eight years, but after an intense round of bidding the fee was paid, and the IPL moved further away from the competition of other franchise leagues. The IPL has been valued as the second-most valuable sporting league in the world, behind the NFL, beating even the Premier League.","pubDate":"2023-12-21 03:45:09","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/12/20/11/GettyImages-95871758.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","source_priority":290,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"ea91481581cfa319c469937952468481","title":"Milestone man Hughes targets more BBL, Shield recall","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/milestone-man-hughes-targets-more-bbl-shield-recall-c-12979389","keywords":null,"creator":["Jasper Bruce"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sydney Sixers veteran Daniel Hughes is on the cusp of playing his 100th BBL game and is hopeful some good form in his milestone match bodes well for the future.","content":"Daniel Hughes hopes his 100th BBL game can be another step towards retaining a regular spot in the Sydney Sixers' best XI and forcing his way back into the NSW Sheffield Shield side. When the Sixers host the Adelaide Strikers on Friday, the 34-year-old batter will become the 16th man to reach 100 BBL games, having debuted for the Sixers in the summer of 2012/13. Hughes was a member of the Sixers sides that won the BBL final in 2020 and 2021, but it has not all been smooth sailing for the left-handed opener. Hughes found himself without a contract after a two-year stint with the Sydney Thunder ended in 2015 and was the odd man out at the selection table last summer, playing only three BBL games. But with an unbeaten 60, Hughes guided the Sixers to victory over the Hobart Hurricanes in their last start, his first match of the tournament. Hughes is hopeful that knock, and another big one in his milestone match, can help him become a regular of the XI once again this summer. \"I think so,\" Hughes said. \"With this club, there's always good players sitting on the bench or waiting to come in. \"So every time you go out there, you try and perform at your best.
