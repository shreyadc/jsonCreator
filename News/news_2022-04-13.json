Gujarat Titans next face Rajasthan Royals at the DY Patil on Thursday.","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/04/12/500x300_1286600-rashid-khan.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Shivam Dube, Robin Uthappa And Maheesh Theekshana Set Up CSK's 23-Run Over RCB - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2lwbC0yMDIyL2lwbC0yMDIyLXNoaXZhbS1kdWJlLXJvYmluLXV0aGFwcGEtYW5kLW1haGVlc2gtdGhlZWtzaGFuYS1zZXQtdXAtY3Nrcy0yMy1ydW4tb3Zlci1yY2ItMjg4MzM5N9IBhAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9pcGwtMjAyMi1zaGl2YW0tZHViZS1yb2Jpbi11dGhhcHBhLWFuZC1tYWhlZXNoLXRoZWVrc2hhbmEtc2V0LXVwLWNza3MtMjMtcnVuLW92ZXItcmNiLTI4ODMzOTcvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: Shivam Dube, Robin Uthappa And Maheesh Theekshana Set Up CSK's 23-Run Over RCB¬†¬†NDTV SportsCSK v RCB: Game Day Preview | IPL 2022¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreLive match blog - Super Kings vs RCB 22nd Match 2022 - Cricket Insights¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoHerald: CSK spoil Goan Suyash's dream debut¬†¬†Herald GoaVirat Kohli and Faf Du Plessis at practice before CSK v RCB | IPL 2022¬†¬†Royal Challengers BangaloreView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-12 18:31:25","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CSK vs RCB Man of the Match 2022: Who is the Man of the Match today IPL match between Chennai and Bangalore?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-csk-vs-rcb-man-of-the-match-2022-who-is-the-man-of-the-match-today-ipl-match-between-chennai-and-bangalore/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","RCB","chennai super kings","csk","Indian Premier League","Royal Challengers Bangalore","Shivam Dube"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"CSK vs RCB Man of the Match: The all-rounder from Chennai Super Kings won his maiden Indian Premier League match award tonight.

This is the Chennai we all were familiar with. What a dominating performance by the men in yellow. Maheesh Theekshana stood out amongst the bowlers for Chennai. He grabbed four wickets and most of them came when the game was being taken away from them. It was an evening filled with mixed emotions for Mukesh Choudhary. A moment to savour as he took the wicket of Virat Kohli, but a night to forget with a couple of dropped catches in the field. Things could've gotten worse for Chennai but the experience of Dwayne Bravo came to the rescue, once he sent back Dinesh Karthik in the 18th over. All smiles for the people in yellow. They will try to capitalize on the winning momentum by their side. It is never easy to chase down a huge target. Bangalore started out with a strategy of keeping the wickets in hand which would come in handy deep into the innings. The opening pair failed to find boundaries in the opening overs but did rack up runs at a good rate by running the hard yards. Although the plan took a U-turn, once Faf du Plessis perished. There was a mini collapse for Bangalore as they were four wickets down within 7 overs. The middle-order put up a solid counterpunch, which got hopes high for Bangalore but it wasn't enough. Suyash Prabhudessai and Shahbaz Ahmed did trouble the yellow army but Maheesh Theekshana got the better of the pair. In the end, it was a huge ask from Dinesh Karthik, he put a good cameo but could not provide his side with another match-winning knock. What an enthralling match. The South Indian derby always delivers an entertaining contest. Nevertheless, Chennai continue their domination over Bangalore in the Indian T20 League. They also get their first win of the season. 19.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Mohammed Siraj ends the innings in fine fashion. Full length, on off. Mohammed Siraj drills it down the ground for a boundary.

Akash Deep looks to flick this away, but the ball goes off the leading edge towards cover. Ambati Rayudu keeps his eyes on the ball, dives full-stretch to his right and takes a spectacular one-handed catch there! Bangalore are now 8 down! 15.3 overs (0 Run) Quicker, outside off, shorter ball. Akash Deep taps it towards point. Strategic break! Dinesh Karthik holds the key for Bangalore but the task is too big for him to do alone and with the lower-order batters walking in, chances of any support from the other end are slim. But cricket is a funny game, so we can't rule anything out. Chennai have the game by the scruff of the neck and would hope to grab their first win of the season. Akash Deep is the new batter in for Bangalore. 15.2 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Ravindra Jadeja brings himself into the attack and strikes and he grabs his second wicket of the match.

During the 22nd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore in Navi Mumbai, Chennai Super Kings opening batter Robin Uthappa put together a 165-run partnership for the third wicket alongside all-rounder Shivam Dube (95*) to power his team to 216/4 in 20 overs. Opening the batting with Ruturaj Gaikwad (17), it wasn‚Äôt until the last ball of the fifth over when Uthappa hit his first boundary of the match. Not faced much of the strike not just in the powerplay but the first 10 overs as well, Uthappa made it for the same to make the most of time spent in the middle. Having scored 27 (25) until then, it was in the 13th over that Uthappa hit as many as three sixes off Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder Glenn Maxwell to turn the tables with respect to his strike rate. In the 15th over, Uthappa hit a four and a six off pacer Akash Deep to bring up a 33-ball half-century. Uthappa, who hit a six off Josh Hazlewood in the following over, followed it with two sixes and a four against Mohammed Siraj. It was on the first delivery of the penultimate over when Uthappa hit Wanindu Hasaranga for a dominating six down the ground to surpass his previous best IPL score. In what is Uthappa‚Äôs 27th IPL half-century, it is his third for Super Kings and second this season.

He says that he was keeping things simple, and he is used to this ground and he was disciplined in his batting. Mentions that MS Dhoni told him to keep calm and watch the last delivery and play accordingly. Says that it's been dry today, not much dew and that is good for them. Adds that Robin Uthappa and he were trying to attack the shorter side of grounds and were picking the right bowlers to hit. Not the best day on the field for Bangalore! They were on top at the end of the Powerplay. But post that, it's been only Chennai. All the bowlers were taken to the cleaners tonight. It's been tough for them. Josh Hazlewood was exceptional in his first two overs, but coming back for his second spell even he was hit all over. Wanindu Hasaranga did manage to grab two wickets but it was all too late for them. They have a mountain to climb from here now. A clinical performance from Chennai!

Carnage, absolute carnage! It was raining boundaries! This is exactly what they needed! After a disappointing start, they have put a mammoth total of 216 on the board. Bangalore needs something special now to chase this down. 19.6 overs (1 Run) It is in the air but Shivam Dube does not connect it cleanly this time. He looks at the heaven in agony but nonetheless he gets a single off it. It is full and outside off. Shivam Dube lofts it towards long off. He could not clear the fence this time. Faf du Plessis though drops the catch in the deep and the batters take single. Chennai end with 216/4 on the scoreboard. 19.5 overs (2 Runs) A low full toss, on leg. Shivam Dube chips it to deep mid-wicket, although it lands safely. The batters take two. Shivam Dube on 94. Can he get a six off one delivery to rack his first ever Indian T20 League ton. 19.4 overs (6 Runs) SIX! ALL THE WAY! Shivam Dube moves to 92. Can he make his ton with two balls remaining.

Chennai have lost two wickets till now, but Robin Uthappa and Shivam Dube have looked solid till now. They have done well to steady the ship, and can probably carry on the same way for a few more overs. Bangalore will be looking to grab a few quick wickets and put some pressure back on the opposition. Also, Shahbaz Ahmed comes into the attack. 8.6 overs (1 Run) Shorter, outside off. Shivam Dube cuts it to sweeper cover for a single. Another good over for Chennai, 8 runs off it. 8.5 overs (0 Run) This is angled into the pads.

This will surely ease down some nerves of the debutant, Suyash Prabhudessai. He wastes no time in introducing himself. Coming to the delivery - It is short and outside off. Moeen Ali cuts it to the right of backward point. Suyash Prabhudessai makes a full-stretched dive to that side.

The ball goes to short third man off his thigh pads. They cross for a leg bye. Chennai are 35/1 at the end of the Powerplay! 5.5 overs (6 Runs) SIX! BANG! Robin Uthappa takes the aerial route now. It is overpitched, and on off. Robin Uthappa stands tall, lofts it over the bowler's head and sends it over the long off fence. 5.4 overs (0 Run) A loud appeal for lbw but turned down! Full length, outside off. Robin Uthappa walks across and tries to flick it away but misses. He gets struck on the pads. Clearly outside the line. 5.3 overs (1 Run) Good length, on middle and leg.

Mentions, there is some knowledge shared but Chennai knows his game really well. Further says that it looks like playing against his brothers. Mentions a youngster is set to make his debut. Chennai (Unchanged Playing XI) - Robin Uthappa, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Moeen Ali, Shivam Dube, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (WK), Ravindra Jadeja (C), Dwayne Bravo, Chris Jordan, Maheesh Theekshana, Mukesh Choudhary. Bangalore (Playing XI) - Faf du Plessis (C), Anuj Rawat, Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Shahbaz Ahmed, Wanindu Hasaranga, Suyash Prabhudessai (In for Harshal Patel), Josh Hazlewood (In for David Willey), Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep. TOSS - Bangalore have won the toss and they have elected to BOWL first. PITCH REPORT - Graeme Swann is near the pitch. He says that this is the same pitch that was used last night, and it is very very dry. Adds that the pitch will support spin and while it's not the best for seamers. Mentions that around 170-180 should be a good score. Toss has also played an important factor in this edition. Ravindra Jadeja has not had the best of lucks with toss as well. We have witnessed the teams bowling first come out on top on most of the occasions at this venue and we could see the team winning the toss chase a target here. Stay tuned for the all important toss and other updates as well. Chennai have some great quality in their ranks, but they have not clicked just yet. They are surely missing out on the services of their ace bowler Deepak Chahar and they will be hoping he returns to the side as soon as possible. But for now, they will want players like Ruturaj Gaikwad to step up. He has not displayed his true magic yet and it is time for him to provide Chennai with the desired start. After losing their opening game, Bangalore have fought back well and have managed to win 3 back-to-back games. They are performing as a unit and will want to carry on the momentum. It will be interesting to see how Faf du Plessis plays against his former team. Also, Bangalore could be without their bowler Harshal Patel. Who would replace him? We will know soon! Hello and a warm welcome folks to match number 22 of the Indian T20 League where Bangalore will lock horns with Chennai. Bangalore are coming into this game at the back of a victory and will be heading into this game high on confidence. While Chennai are yet to win a game in this tournament, nothing seems to be working for them right but they need to turn things around before it gets too late for them. Get ready for the battle of the south! Like every other game, this too promises to be a cracker. ...

Openers tend to dominate white-ball cricket and the trend is no different in the IPL as well. Prithvi Shaw leads the charts when it comes to smashing the most number of fours. The young batter from Delhi Capitals is playing this season with a point to prove and has made a solid start.In 4 innings so far, he has scored 160 runs and as has always been the case with Prithvi, he takes off in the powerplay overs. So far, he has creamed 21 fours in 4 innings and is the joint leader in this metric along with Quinton de Kock ‚Äì the Lucknow Super Giants opener.Ishan Kishan has been the lone bright spot in an otherwise miserable start to the campaign for the Mumbai Indians and he comes in at the third spot with 20 fours in 4 innings. Gujarat Titans have made a brilliant start to their campaign in their debut season and have won 3 games. Their retention before the mega auctions, Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya, both of whom have been consistent for Gujarat Titans, have hit 18 fours in 4 innings each.If the first 2 weeks of the IPL is anything to go by, dew has played a part, but in the recent few matches, spinners too have come into their own and this next phase could be an interesting watch.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPl Live Score UpdateLatest IPL Schedule 2022, and , IPl 2022 Points tableEntertainment News here.

Their batting is powered by Jos Buttler at the top of the order. The England wicket-keeper batter has already notched up a century this season and he also tops the charts as far as the six hitters are concerned. In four matches so far, Buttler has scored 218 runs and this includes 15 fours and 15 sixes.He is then followed by Shimron Hetmyer, another Rajasthan Royals player who made the difference in the last match against the Lucknow Super Giants. Coming in the middle order, Hetmyer has taken up the responsibility of finishing the innings. He played a superb hand in taking Rajasthan to a decent total against Lucknow.In four matches so far, Hetmyer has already smacked 14 sixes and has scored 168 runs at an amazing strike-rate of around 179. This batting power has made Rajasthan an advantage in this season.Liam Livingstone is finally justifying his tag as an explosive batter in the IPL.

This is Santadeep Dey , bringing you all the action as it unfolds at the venue. CSK vs RCB LIVE COMMENTARY Stay tuned! The live coverage begins at 7:30PM IST. CSK vs RCB MATCH PREVIEW The clash between Royal Challengers and Chennai Super Kings is one of the marquee matches in the Indian Premier League. While expectations are always high, the records are lopsided in favour of the Super Kings. However, when the two sides meet here at the DY Patil Stadium on Tuesday, the Royal Challengers, led by ex CSK star Faf du Plessis, will start as firm favourites. After failing to defend a high score in the first match against Punjab Kings, RCB has done well to bounce back with a hat-trick of wins. In the last match against Mumbai Indians, the bowlers did well to take six wickets after the PowerPlay for just 29 runs, thus restricting the opponent to a modest total before Anuj Rawat and Virat Kohli chased down the target comfortably. While the team will miss the services of pacer Harshal Patel who left the bubble after the game on Saturday due to a bereavement in the family, it received a boost with pacers Josh Hazlewood and Jason Behrendorff starting training on Monday. The Super Kings, under new skipper Ravindra Jadeja, had a disastrous start to its title defence campaign with four straight losses. Their concern is the absence of effective wicket-taking bowlers, especially with the new ball, while dew has blunted its spin attack. The men in yellow also will need the likes of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Ambati Rayudu to step up sooner than later to give themselves a chance in the tournament. - S.
