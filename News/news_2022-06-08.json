Former team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday, invested in a Chennai-based drone startup ‚Äì Garuda Aerospace, and is also set to become its brand ambassador and shareholder. This drone manufacturing company has the primary role to offer the best possible farming solutions, with a total of about 400 drones and 500 pilots up their sleeve. Agnishwar Jayaprakash, founder CEO of Garuda Aerospace hailed it as his dream-come-true moment, and heartily welcomed him to the Garuda Aerospace family. ‚ÄúMahi Bhai is the epitome of dedication and I firmly believe that having Captain Cool on our cap table adds tremendous value, which will motivate our team to perform better,‚Äù exclaimed Jayaprakash. ‚ÄúI am happy to be a part of Garuda Aerospace and look forward to witness their growth story with the unique drone solutions they have to offer,‚Äù said MS Dhoni as quoted in the startup‚Äôs statement. As per Jayaprakash, his company is on the path to become India‚Äôs first ever drone unicorn startup, whose manufacturing facilities were recently inaugurated by India‚Äôs incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The exact amount invested by the legendary cricketer has however, not been disclosed by either parties. Dhoni recently graced the Cricket field, with him being midway appointed the captaincy of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings (CSK) after having decided to hand over the responsibility to the flamboyant Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, before the commencement of IPL 2022. However, after a spree of losses, Jadeja decided to no longer shoulder the responsibility which was hampering his own performances with both bat and the ball. Another good news for the CSK fans is that their very own ‚ÄòThala‚Äô has also confirmed his availability for next year‚Äôs IPL season as well, in the capacity of a player.","pubDate":"2022-06-07 19:13:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia vs Sri Lanka, 1st T20I Highlights: Australia beat Sri Lanka by 10 wickets","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/aus-vs-sl-1st-t20i-live-cricket-score-watch-sri-lanka-tour-of-australia-2022-live-update-highlight-live-streaming-online-10769431.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia vs Sri Lanka, 1st T20I Highlights: Australia beat Sri Lanka by 10 wickets","content":"Australia won the toss and elected to field first against Sri Lanka in the first Twenty20 at R.

When the top Test playing nations like New Zealand and then England were criticized by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the enthusiastic Pakistan Cricket fans for cancelling their away series against Pakistan, it was the West Indies, who despite having been dented by a few COVID-19 cases in their camp before the start of the limited-Overs series, had decided to compete against the Babar Azam-led side. However, after the COVID-19 cases count went up to nine in squad by the end of the three-match series, there was no other option for both the Cricket boards, but to postpone it to the month of June. Thus, the series which was supposed to end by December 2021, will now resume from June 8 onwards, with a three-match ODI series, in the city of Multan. While West Indies, under their new limited-Overs skipper Nicholas Pooran, are coming on the back of a 3-0 ODI series victory against the Netherlands, Pakistan would play an ODI after almost two months, having last defeated Australia 2-1 during the ODI series in March-April.

McCullum as new England coach has given Adil Rashid (34-year-old spinner) hopes of returning to the Test squad after being sidelined for more than three years now. The leg-spinner last played a Test for England against the West Indies at Barbados in January 2019, and feels that with the new setup of coach McCullum and skipper Ben Stokes, it could be \"exciting times\" for the longest form of cricket in the country. Rashid has continued to prosper in limited-overs cricket, winning the World Cup and becoming England's leading T20 wicket-taker, but he continues to be on the fringes of Test cricket, though that could change as he and all-rounder Moeen Ali have been \"tapped up\" by McCullum, according to Daily Mail. \"It's always exciting when something new comes along,\" Rashid was quoted as saying in the report. This will never get old! Happy birthday, Adil Rashid... pic.twitter.com/jC92Sq7DIi ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) February 17, 2020 \"Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes both like to be positive and attacking. That drives me on and it's very exciting. Brendon's reached out to me -- just a text to check how things are. I've not closed the door on Test cricket. I've not retired, or anything like that. It's something that's still there. It's everyone's dream to play Test cricket and I'm no different.\" Recently Moeen Ali, who retired from Test cricket last year to prolong his white-ball career, too had said that he was not averse to coming out of retirement if the new England Test coach so desired. Rashid was dropped from the England side after playing his 19th Test, against the West Indies at Barbados in January 2019, as he returned forgettable figures of none for 117 in the team's loss. Pace bowler Stuart Broad replaced him in Antigua. Rashid then began his preparations for the World Cup at home and the rest is history. But his Test aspirations were ignited when McCullum \"tapped\" Rashid and Moeen after taking over the England job from Chris Silverwood recently. \"He's (Moeen) like a brother to me. It's definitely a conversation we'd have, and that would inspire me. It (Test return) could happen. But for us to get to that point, a lot else has got to happen too,\" added Rashid. \"But things have changed. There are exciting times ahead... For me, the door isn't closed,\" he said.

During a recent interaction however, the 28-year-old made an interesting revelation as to which cricketer he always looked up to while growing up. During an interaction with the SG Podcast, the flamboyant all-rounder named former team India opening batter Wasim Jaffer as his favourite cricketer. While Pandya admitted to have likeness for the greats of the game like Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis, Virat Kohli et al, it is the legendary batter from Mumbai who had caught his attention the most amidst the well-renowned stars. ‚ÄúLike everyone, I had favourite cricketers. I liked Jacques Kallis, Virat, Sachin sir. There are so many greats that you can‚Äôt pick. My favourite cricketer was actually Wasim Jaffer. I used to love watching him bat.

Jaffer is fondly remembered by the ardent Indian Cricket fans, primarily for his double hundreds against West Indies and Pakistan, and his magnificent ton against a top-quality South African bowling line-up in Cape Town (2007). A domestic giant as well, the former classy right-hander had, a couple of years ago, even went on to become the first player in Ranji Trophy history to score 12,000 runs in the competition for Mumbai and Vidarbha.","pubDate":"2022-06-07 16:47:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‚ÄúLewis Hamilton getting overshadowed by cricket at Silverstone‚Äù- How England‚Äôs World Cup victory spoiled seven time World Champion‚Äôs after race party","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/f1-news-lewis-hamilton-getting-overshadowed-by-cricket-at-silverstone-how-englands-world-cup-victory-spoiled-seven-time-world-champions-after-race-party/","keywords":["F1","British GP","Lewis Hamilton","Mercedes"],"creator":["Somin Bhattacharjee"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lewis Hamilton won the 2019 British Grand Prix in Silverstone but the crowd was more focused elsewhere during the after race celebrations. 14th July 2019 was a historic day for sports in England.

Speaking ahead of India's first T20I against South Africa, Dravid on Tuesday also confirmed that the players, who were part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 final on May 29, were given an extra day's rest. \"I just met Hardik a couple of hours ago. For the guys who played the final, we gave them an extra day off. But I think his leadership was very impressive right through the IPL. He performed very well. In this sense, you don't have to be designated as a leader to be part of any leadership group. It's not only about Hardik being designated in a position. At this point in time, it's really about its good from our perspective that he has started bowling again. \"We know what that does for us, and what his bowling can add to our depth. It's about ensuring that we can get the best out of him as a cricketer, in terms of bowling, batting, and fielding, and in terms of what happens ahead, it depends on many factors. The selectors will take that decision, in terms of what happens in the future,\" said Dravid in the pre-match conference on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the BCCI selectors have also picked up Arshdeep Singh and Umran Malik after their impressive performances in the IPL 2022. Would love to see Umran Malik turn into good red-ball bowler, says Rahul Dravid Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) pacer Umran consistently amazed all with his pace that was never seen before in Indian cricket. While that sure has caught Dravid's eye, the head coach expects the Jammu and Kashmir fast bowler to turn into a fine red-ball bowler as well. \"It is exciting. He certainly bowled quick and with pace. Another thing that has been interesting for me watching the IPL from the outside is the number of Indian bowlers bowling fast.

There would be times where we would have to rest our big players,\" Dravid said at the pre-match press conference in Delhi on Tuesday.All three were part of the IPL 2022, with Rohit's MI, where Bumrah also plays, suffering a league-stage exit. RCB, meanwhile, missed out on the final after going down to RR in Qualifier 2.The first T20I will be played at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi on Thursday.Dravid urged the Indian top-order to deliver. \"We are looking for good starts. We know our top 3. If it is high scoring games, we would want them to maintain that strike rate throughout but there would be tricky matches too. We have the kind of quality at top 3, who can deliver,\" continued the former India batter.Unlike the Indian team, South Africa have named a star-studded squad with Temba Bavuma leading the side. GT‚Äôs IPL 2022 winner David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Marco Jansen and Quinton de Kock are some of the big names who will take part in the upcoming series.India, meanwhile, will be led by KL Rahul, and SRH‚Äôs Umran Malik, who shone with his ball and pace finds place in the squad, so does Arshdeep Singh. Hardik Pandya will be looking to utilise his all-round abilities, while Dinesh Karthik too returns to the T20I side after a prolonged absence.The first T20I will be followed by four more matches on 12, 14, 17 and 19 June.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

While Sri Lanka have forged a decent side comprising promising youngsters, world champions Australia have also toured with an almost full strength squad.

During England's win over New Zealand in the first Test at Lord's, Root surpassed the 10,000-mark in the longest format. Among the English batters, Root is the second leading run-scorer after Alastair Cook, who ended his career with over 12,000 runs in Tests. Root became the 14th cricketer and the second Englishman after Cook to achieve the record. Courtesy of Root's 115 in the second innings, which was his 26th Test century, England sealed the game by five wickets and went 1-0 up in the three-match Test series. Praising Root, Vaughan called the former England captain the country's \"best ever\" Test batsman. \"Joe Root is England's best ever - now Sachin Tendulkar should watch out. For me, Joe Root stands alongside Graham Gooch as England's greatest batsman, and the way he is going he could surpass Sachin Tendulkar's record for the most Test runs. \"He is still 6000 short of Sachin's total but he is only 31 and if James Anderson can play until he is 40, then I think Joe can too. He loves batting that much. He is driven. He is a cricket badger. You have to have it in you to wake up every morning and think about batting,\" Vaughan wrote in his column for The Telegraph. Joe Root's Test average in each year of his career2012: 932013: 34.482014: 97.122015: 60.212016: 49.232017: 50.842018: 41.212019: 372020: 42.182021: 612022: 44 #ENGvNZ pic.twitter.com/LCFZXOC9i6 Earlier, former Australian batsman Mark Taylor said that if Root continued the same rhythm, he can easily go past the 15,000-mark without breaking much sweat. \"Root has a minimum of five years left in him, so I think Tendulkar's record is very achievable. Root is batting as I have ever seen him bat over the last 18 months to two years. He is in the prime of his career, so there are 15,000 runs-plus for him if he stays healthy,\" Taylor told Sky Sports. Root took 169 days fewer than Tendulkar to reach the 10,000-run landmark. The former Indian batter was 31 years and 326 days when he reached 10,000 Test runs, but went on to play even after his 40th birthday. Tendulkar, who holds the record for most Test runs, finished his career with 15,921 runs in 200 Tests. No other batter has even touched the 14,000-mark to date apart from the Master Blaster. Meanwhile, former England captain Alastair Cook did not get into the debate of whether Root can break Tendulkar's record, but he showed his appreciation of Root's achievements. \"I was so glad I was here to witness that - an unbelievable knock by an unbelievable player. He is the most complete England batsman in all forms,\" said Cook. The second Test between England and New Zealand is due to begin on Friday (June 10) at Trent Bridge, Nottingham.","pubDate":"2022-06-07 14:48:49","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/06/07/500x300_1296571-michael-vaughan.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka cricket coach 2022: Full list of Sri Lanka cricket support staff for Australia series","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sri-lanka-cricket-coach-2022-full-list-of-sri-lanka-cricket-support-staff-for-australia-series/","keywords":["Cricket","SL vs AUS","SLC","Sri Lanka"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka cricket coach 2022: The SportsRush brings you the list of the support staff of the Sri Lankan national team.

It is worth mentioning that the same has been done as a mark of respect and tribute towards former Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds. Symonds, 46, died at the scene after being a lone occupant in a single-vehicle car crash near Townsville last month. Tonight is the first time when Australia are playing international cricket since Symonds‚Äô unfortunate and shocking demise. Symonds, who played 238 matches across formats between 1998-2009 for Australia, will be primarily remembered as a dual World Cup-winner due to his involvement in the 2003 and 2007 Australian squad. An outright entertainer on a cricket ground, Symonds left behind a family of three including wife Laura, son Billy and daughter Chloe. The tragic incident had invited reactions from former cricketer such as Adam Gilchrist , Shane Watson , Brian Lara and many others.","pubDate":"2022-06-07 14:12:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why is Pat Cummins not playing today‚Äôs 1st T20I between Sri Lanka and Australia in Colombo?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-why-is-pat-cummins-not-playing-todays-1st-t20i-between-sri-lanka-and-australia-in-colombo/","keywords":["Cricket","Australia","Australia tour of Sri Lanka 2022","Pat Cummins","Sri Lanka"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Why is Pat Cummins not playing vs Sri Lanka: Australia are playing international cricket in Sri Lanka after six years.

After Shahbaz Ahmed ramped Sushant Mishra (two for 122) for six over the third man following the dismissal of Abhishek Porel (68, 111b, 11x4), who was strangled down leg, the Jharkhand dugout geed up the fielders with a round of applause in the 175th over of the innings. Earlier, a similar spectacle had transpired an hour into the day‚Äôs play. Between these bouts of cheers, Bengal ran the bowlers ragged. Porel and Manoj Tiwari (54 n.o., 146b, 3x4, 1x6), pairing for a 109-run stand for the fifth wicket, looked poised for a rousing end to the day with the third new ball yielding 46 runs in 11 overs. Porel, who reached his third fifty in his maiden Ranji Trophy season, cut and drove the pacers and spinners in equal measure. Overcoming his jitters with the short ball, in particular, Tiwari struck his first boundary after facing 95 balls before reaching his fifty with a crisp cover-drive for four. FOLLOW: Ranji Trophy Quarterfinals, Day 2 Highlights: Karnataka slips to 100/8 at Stumps Earlier, Sudip Kumar Gharami 186(380b, 21x4, 1x6) and Anustup Majumdar 117(194b, 15x4) built on the overnight score of 310 for one with their stonewalling, which yielded 99 runs in 35 overs in the first session. Majumdar reached the three-figure mark with a couple of fours after Ashish Kumar troubled him initially by moving the ball both ways. Rahul Shukla, however, was inaccurate from the start, straying on the pads to allow two fours in the second over of the day. After a backbreaking spell, Shahbaz Nadeem finally tasted success, drawing Majumdar‚Äôs outside edge by beating him in the air and ending a 243-run stand. Abhishek Raman (61, 109b 8x4, 1x6), who retired hurt on 41 on day one, showed intent from the get-go by stepping out and depositing off-spinner Utkarsh Singh over long-on for six before he was consumed by his aggression, stranded outside his crease by a flighted delivery by Anukul Roy. The day belonged to young Gharami, who shifted gears after an assuring first session. A bottom-handed whip through mid-wicket and a wild slash to the third man boundary betrayed a sense of hurry to complete a double ton. However, he was given out caught behind trying to flick down leg-side ‚Äì 14 runs short, shock and disbelief writ large and a rousing ovation from his teammates.","pubDate":"2022-06-07 13:38:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ranji Trophy 2021-22: Mumbai debutant Suved Parkar joins elite list with double century against Uttarakhand","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ranji-trophy-2021-22-mumbai-debutant-suved-parkar-joins-elite-list-with-double-century-against-uttarakhand-10769321.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"Ranji Trophy 2021-22: Mumbai debutant Suved Parkar joins elite list with double century against Uttarakhand","content":"Mumbai's Suved Parkar achieved a memorable feat on Day two of the Ranji Trophy quarter-final against Uttarakhand on Tuesday.

He remembers all my opponents by their name and always has important notes to share,‚Äù says Sarita.Rahul himself is no novice to wrestling as the six-time national champion has multiple international medals to his name (including two Asian Championship and three Commonwealth Championship medals).The husband-wife duo, married in 2017, competed together in international and national arena until 2018 when Rahul‚Äôs constant struggles with injuries forced him to call time on his career at just 29.‚ÄúOur elders suggested that it would be better if one of us pursued wrestling with the other being the helping hand,‚Äù says Rahul, who reached the airport at 6 AM in the morning to receive her wife. ‚ÄúSince I was 29 back then and Sarita was 23, it seemed logical for me to help her out as she had a long wrestling career in front of her. Today when she has become World No. 1, I couldn‚Äôt be more happy and proud. I am living my incomplete dreams to her.‚ÄùSetting sights on Olympics and WorldsHowever, despite her supremacy, 59kg being a non-Olympic category means there‚Äôs only so much she can do beyond a certain level. In fact, the World Championship gold medal would be the apex of her success in the category. Will that be enough?‚ÄúJi bilkul nahi (Certainly not)!‚Äù says Sarita. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more important than an Olympic gold medal and all this hard work is for that ultimate dream. That‚Äôs why this will be the last of me competing in the 59 kg category. I have another World Ranking series to participate in 10-day time in Italy. After that, I will likely solely focus on 57kg category.\"This doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt care about World Championship because I still want to be the first Indian woman to win World Championship gold medal but I wish to do so in the 57kg category.‚ÄùSwitching to 57kg comes with a separate set of challenges and the biggest one would be clearing the domestic circuit hurdle as she would have to face the likes of Anshu Malik and Pooja Dhanda. Sarita is familiar with the two competitors as the former also ended her 2022 Commonwealth Games ambition recently. Facing off in the 57kg national trials last month, Anshu got better of Sarita twice to book her Birmingham ticket. But a closer look at the result suggests that Sarita has a case and it is Anshu who will have to worry about her Olympic ambitions.The duo faced each other twice at the trials in Pune with Anshu defeating Sarita by the narrowest of margins on both occasions; 6-5 in round-robin and 2-1 in the final. While the round-robin encounter saw Anshu pull off a four-point move to make her a worthy winner, it was the final encounter that tested the 20-year-old young prodigy's might. Picking two single points within the first half, Anshu dug deep in her defence to battle an aggressive Sarita for the last 3 minutes of the bout (Watch the video of the final bout in the link below). The refereeing decisions that day came under question as Anshu faced no caution for her ultra-defensive approach but Sarita holds no grudge.‚ÄúKhel me to haar jeet hote rehta hai (One either wins or loses in sports) and Anshu is not the sole competitor in the category. There is Pooja and others as well and I am taking nobody lightly. My objective is very clear, I have to work so hard that any refereeing decision or external factors won‚Äôt decide if I am going to win or not. It‚Äôs Olympic gold or nothing for me,‚Äù concludes Sarita.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Australia batter Marnus Labuschagne has signed off from his third County Championship season to join the national squad in Sri Lanka for a multi-format tour starting with a three-match T20I series from tonight. Not part of the T20I squad, Labuschagne will take part in a five-match ODI series followed by a two-match Test series scheduled to be played between June 14 ‚Äì July 12 across Kandy, Pallekele and Galle. Much like Labuschagne, Australia Test captain will also join the squad for the ODIs and Tests after being rested for the T20Is. Labuschagne, 27, took to social media platform Twitter to thank Glamorgan for providing him with an opportunity to ply his trade in both the first-class and T20 format. In five County Championship Division Two 2022 matches, Labuschagne scored 377 runs at an average of 41.88 with the help of a century and two half-centuries. Labuschagne‚Äôs 10 wickets in this County season came at an average and strike rate of 28.70 and 47.9 respectively. As far as the ongoing season of Vitality Blast is concerned, Labuschagne scored only 118 runs in five innings at an average and strike rate of 23.60 and 132.58 respectively. Thanks to everyone at @GlamCricket for another season.

Labuschagne, who had made his County debut in 2019 right before Ashes 2019, had missed the subsequent season due to COVID-19. Having said that, the club later signed Labuschagne for two more seasons. Set to play international cricket for the first time in Sri Lanka, Labuschagne had recently hinted at wanting to replicate former England captain Joe Root‚Äôs heroics in the island nation.","pubDate":"2022-06-07 11:57:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs South Africa: Tabraiz Shamsi shares hilarious update on Delhi weather ahead of 1st T20I","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-south-africa-tabraiz-shamsi-shares-hilarious-update-on-delhi-weather-ahead-of-1st-t20i-10768441.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa: Tabraiz Shamsi shares hilarious update on Delhi weather ahead of 1st T20I","content":"New Delhi, as well as its surrounding areas, has been reeling under heat waves for the last few weeks.
