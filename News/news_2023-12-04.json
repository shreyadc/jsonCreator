Johnson has questioned Warner’s “hero send-off” and opened up old wounds from Sandpapergate as the 37-year-old opener prepares to bow out of Test cricket in January. “It’s been five years and Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal,” Warner wrote. “Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.” Johnson and Warner are former teammates and he also played with Bailey. But it is not the first time Johnson has had a crack at Warner. Ahead of the tour of England, Johnson said Warner’s Test form was not “up to scratch” and did not think he should be selected. That prompted a reaction from Warner’s wife Candice, who called Johnson irrelevant. “It doesn’t surprise me because he doesn’t have a lot to do with media anymore and I feel like the only way he gets a headline is by using David’s name,’’ she said at the time. “Everyone takes his comments with a grain of salt. They don’t have a lot of merit.” Warner has scored just one Test century since January, 2020, and others — including former captain and respected commentator Ricky Ponting — . But speaking after the squad for the first Test against Pakistan was named on Sunday, Bailey said Warner’s ability to put the opposition under pressure with his batting is “pretty special and not to be taken lightly”. Bailey said it would be impossible to replace Warner as an opener, comparing it to when leg-spinner Shane Warne retired. “I’d put David in that category, the way he’s opened the batting for Australia for such a long period,” Bailey said. Johnson also had a shot at Bailey, saying he was too close to the players as a selector. That prompted an ice-cold response from Bailey. “I’ve been sent little snippets of it ... I hope he’s OK,” Bailey said. “My only question would be ... if someone can show me how being distant and unaware of what players are going through and what the plans are with their team and the coaching staff, how that’s more beneficial, I’d be all ears,” Bailey said. Warner has expressed a desire to finish his red-ball career at home when Australia face Pakistan in the third and final Test of the series at the SCG. He and Johnson played together for Australia for more than five years, including in the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash and the 2015 ODI World Cup victory. “As we prepare for David Warner’s farewell series, can somebody please tell me why?” Johnson wrote in The West Australian. “Why a struggling Test opener gets to nominate his own retirement date. “And why a player at the centre of one of the biggest scandals in Australian cricket history warrants a hero’s send-off?” Johnson’s attack on Warner comes two years after he savaged Pat Cummins in his same newspaper column amid the fallout from Justin Langer’s exit as Australian coach. The 42-year-old’s relationship with his fast-bowling brethren Cummins and Mitchell Starc has not been the same since. Johnson took 313 wickets in 73 Tests for Australia, retiring in November 2015.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:52:32","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12777159/3cc07da33db1b2819d68dd17d415dd7d2b085128-16x9-x0y2w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3370bcb957d03d4c2e43979823b7afb6","title":"“Virat Kohli has to show he is a better option in T20Is”: Sanjay Manjrekar","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/12/virat-kohli-has-to-show-he-is-a-better-option-in-t20is-sanjay-manjrekar/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The News Mill","content":"Amid a debate on whether batting stalwart Virat Kohli should feature in India’s squad for the T20I World Cup next year, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said he needs to perform well in the shortest format to show that he is a better option than the youngsters. Kohli, who was the top run-getter in the ODI World Cup earlier this year, is currently on a break from limited-overs cricket after India’s defeat to Australia in the final. Speaking on Star Sports, Manjrekar said the India skipper will face competition from Hardik Pandya when it comes to selection for the shortest format going forward. “Virat Kohli will have to show that he is a better option than the youngsters who are playing currently, and Rohit Sharma as T20 batter and captain vs Hardik Pandya, the T20 batter, all-rounder and captain,” Manjrekar said. Ahead of the upcoming T20I World Cup, the 58-year-old also asked the team management to pick the squad on form and not reputation. “Who knows what’s in store in life? I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I believe the approach should be extremely simple. We have played a lot of World Cups and haven’t been able to win them. We are maybe playing slightly different cricket in the final stages of World Cups. When something goes out of your hand, simplify it. Pick your team based on form close to the World Cup,” he added. Before the start of the 2024 T20 World Cup, India will look to play more 20-over matches to give themselves the best chance of winning the tournament. The ‘Men In Blue’ on Sunday won the last match of the ongoing T20I series against Australia in Bengaluru, taking the series 4-1. Led by Shreyas Iyer (53 runs from 37 balls) and all-rounder Axar Patel (31 off 21 balls), who came together for a solid partnership, the hosts posted 160 on the board. After a rollicking start, the Aussies fell away in the chase, losing wickets at regular intervals. However, Aussie skipper Matthew Wade (36 runs from 23 balls) brought the equation down to 10 off 4 balls but Arshdeep bowled a splendid last over to take hosts to a narrow win.

After unveiling Morris, dubbed the “wild thing” in a 14-man Test squad for the series against Pakistan which begins on December 14, Bailey suggested the first-choice attack of Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pay Cummins were expected to be “fit and firing” despite a heavy World Cup workload. Both Morris and Scott Boland have been included amid an expectation they could be called upon if not against Pakistan then maybe the two matches which follow against the West Indies. Bailey said selectors were keen to exploit the “unique talent” possessed by Morris, but are conscious of his progress having taken 11 Sheffield Shield wickets this season coming off a stress fracture injury which sidelined him during the Australian winter. Exactly when Morris will make his test debut remains unclear but the fondness selectors hold for him cannot be denied. “We clearly like the skillset there and have done for quite a little while,” he said. “An unfortunate injury for him over the winter and he’s had to work had to get back playing and he’s feeling really good. (He’s a) bull at a gate in terms of wanting to get out there playing, as all players are. “Where we’re at with him at the moment is trying to get him to work backwards a little bit and try and get his mindset (right) with him if an opportunity arises during the summer, (figuring out) what does that look like for him to be at his absolute best and cherry ripe and respecting the fact he has come back off a back stress fracture which is clearly a debilitating and challenging injury to get over. “But we’re thrilled to see how he’s progressed through the games with Western Australia, I think he’s got better and better each opportunity and I know he’s referenced in the past how much he loves being around the Australian team and particularly around those senior fast bowlers. “... It’s a unique skillset (he has), there’s lots of areas where players can get better and improve but having that raw speed is pretty unique.” Bailey was also keen to point that they didn’t just see Morris as a potential replacement for Starc, should be get injured. He said there was a scenario where they would play together, which could be a fearsome new ball attack with extreme pace at both ends. “There’s potential for it, interestingly with quicks everyone tends to look at it as a bunch and if one comes out then there’s a running line that one comes in,” he said. “But I think much like a batting line-up, for the team as a whole it’s about how that functions and what you want from each bowler, depending on the surface that you’re on and who you’re playing against and what you actually need from the team. “Clearly both of those guys are our quickest bowlers so there’s some similarities there, but I think as Lance continues to develop there’s no reason why they couldn’t play in the same team.”","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:12:03","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-12777579/7a189abdb44b9e3e7bd3ff14c4072f5adc2bf531-16x9-x0y192w2047h1151.jpg","source_id":"thewest","source_priority":106740,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7cf9802677cb63fc8fe18e122c0f2699","title":"Australian skipper Matthew Wade spits fire at last-over blunder in defeat to India","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-skipper-matthew-wade-spits-fire-at-last-over-blunder-in-defeat-to-india-c-12774301","keywords":null,"creator":["Justin Chadwick"],"video_url":null,"description":"Matthew Wade was still fuming after the match, unable to wrap his head around what went down in India.","content":"Australia captain Matthew Wade has been left fuming at a late umpiring blunder as India secured a dramatic six-run victory in the fifth and final in Bengaluru. Allrounder Aaron Hardie (1-21) and spinner Tanveer Sangha (1-26) had produced strong displays with the ball as Australia restricted India to 8-160 on Sunday night (Monday AEDT). In reply, Ben McDermott (54 off 36 balls) provided the early fireworks before Australia fell in a hole, needing 32 runs off 17 balls and with only three wickets in hand. Wade (22 off 15) changed the equation in the blink of an eye with three consecutive boundaries off the bowling of Avesh Khan. Australia needed 10 runs off the final over - bowled by paceman Arshdeep Singh. It was from there that the wheels fell off completely for Australia - in some instances through no fault of their own. Singh’s first delivery was a bouncer that clearly sailed over Wade’s head. Wade was left incredulous - and incensed - when no wide was called by the square leg umpire, with the veteran gesturing angrily at the non-call. “Matthew Wade’s not happy with that. He’s quite cross with that decision,” the commentator said. Australian great Matthew Hayden added: “You can see why he was upset. That was definitely a wide, way over his head there.” The next ball was a yorker that Wade could only bunt for no run, and he holed out on the third delivery of the over when he was caught in the deep. A Jason Behrendorff single meant Australia needed nine runs off the final two balls. But their victory hopes were ended when the central umpire couldn’t get out of the way in time when Nathan Ellis bludgeoned the fifth delivery straight back down the ground. It meant instead of a registering a boundary, Australia could only scamper through for a single, their hopes over as they went on to finish at 8-154. The result enabled India to wrap up a 4-1 series win. “It’s hard to wrap my head around at the moment after not being able to get us home,” Wade said of the loss. “I thought we bowled relatively well. We kept them to a total that probably should have been chased at this ground. It’s pretty disappointing. “It would have been nice to get the result tonight. I think 3-2 would have been a reflection of where the series was at. “It would’ve been nice to get the result, but we keep learning, and I thought Ben McDermott bounced back, and Behrendorff, Dwarshuis and Sangha all made an impact in tough conditions.” India slumped to 4-55 after 9.1 overs before handy knocks from Shreyas Iyer (53 off 37 balls) and Axar Patel (31 off 21) lifted the home side to a defendable total. Australian paceman Ben Dwarshuis snared 2-5 from his first two overs, but he copped some punishment from that point on to finish with 2-30. Australia’s run chase started off strongly, with Travis Head (28 off 18 balls) and McDermott in the thick of the action. McDermott struck five sixes during his blistering knock - one of which he launched 98 metres and out of the stadium. But each time Australia looked like they had the game in their control, a clump of wickets would follow. Mukesh Kumar snared the scalps of Matt Short (16) and Dwarshuis (0) in consecutive deliveries as Australia crumpled to 7-129, and Wade was unable to lift the team over the line despite producing some clutch boundaries. Axar Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 1-14 off four overs, but Singh was the hero after conceding just three runs from the final over.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:04:37","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12774301/496525223dce11b896c6e418e56ef076b717eb90-16x9-x0y0w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"edd00ec60fae29d2a32b9ea49b95d003","title":"Clue to Lanning’s future as T20 league nears","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/meg-lanning-retained-by-delhi-capitals-ahead-of-wpl-auction/news-story/1666f540cc08966ec47c72f04cf8d4d3","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","Sport news and galleries","Womens Cricket"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"Meg Lanning has been retained by her Indian T20 franchise Delhi Capitals in a sign the batting great will continue to play cricket next year.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

The first one-day international of what has become a new white-ball beginning after England’s World Cup capitulation was a case of more of the same for a captain who insisted before this game that his leadership would not be defined by two shocking months in India . Fact is, there was a strong case for Buttler to stand down after the World Cup and concentrate on batting that made him the greatest white-ball talent in England’s history. After all, England were so bad in India that Buttler and coach Matthew Mott should consider themselves fortunate that both lived to fight another white-ball day, starting with a tour of the Caribbean that has suddenly assumed far greater importance than expected. It is understandable Buttler did not want to go out on such a low as captain, particularly as he only has to get through until June before defending the Twenty20 World Cup title England won in his first tournament in charge last year. Jos Buttler still looked nothing like his old self in England’s opening defeat against West Indies His out of character, timid contribution of three to England’s 325 brought back bad memories But his out of character, timid contribution of just three to England’s 325 brought back painful recent memories of a World Cup that, statistically, was even worse than the watershed tournament of 2015 that led to their white-ball revolution in the first place. In truth, this was still not the aggressive, no fear, dynamic batting that took England under Eoin Morgan from rock bottom to World Cup winners in 2019 and the dominant white-ball force in international cricket for close to a decade. The start certainly was. There were very much echoes of the way Jason Roy and Alex Hales, and then Jonny Bairstow, launched that new era eight years ago in the way Phil Salt and Will Jacks went about England’s innings after Buttler won the toss yesterday. It is perhaps no coincidence that neither was in India but they carried on where they left off against Ireland at the end of last summer and set off in such an explosive manner that a recuperative total of 400 looked the very least of England’s ambitions. And it was significant England went for this pairing rather than the Test opening partnership of Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett that followed them in the order in Antigua in the absence of the rested Joe Root and Bairstow. Investment has to be made in Salt and Jacks right up until the next World Cup and certainly in the 10 remaining one-day internationals that represent England’s only 50-over fixtures ahead of the Champions Trophy in 2025. Investment has to be made in Phil Salt (L) and Will Jacks right up until the next World Cup Both are desperately unlucky not to have been among the 29 players handed England central-contracts by Rob Key ahead of the World Cup but both have huge futures in this team, in the one-day side and the T20 one that will defend the short-form crown. Otherwise England’s batting was unconvincing and still largely lacking in the bravery and conviction that became second nature under Morgan and in the early days of Buttler’s captaincy before it all came crashing down in such spectacular fashion. It was interesting to hear Sir Alastair Cook saying in the TNT Sports studio on Sunday that his England captaincy only really came into its own after the toxic 5-0 Ashes defeat in 2013-14. Before then, Cook said, he was merely carrying on Sir Andrew Strauss’s work. There was nothing like the divisions in the camp in India that marred Cook’s tour of Australia 10 years ago but Buttler is carrying on now after a similar low. And England’s total on Sunday was put in perspective by Shai Hope as he inspired West Indies to a dramatic four-wicket victory with seven balls to spare with an unbeaten century. Clearly, there is much work still to do for the captain yet.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Tim Paine said exactly what we’re all thinking after Mitchell Johnson dropped a bomb on Australian cricket. The former fast-bowler sent shockwaves across the cricketing world when he took a personal swipe at David Warner and the opening batter’s plans to retire. The Ashes destroyer’s explosive column in The West Australian said “arrogance” was behind Warner’s declaration he will retire after one final New Year’s Test in Sydney. The BBL is back! Watch every match live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. Join Kayo now and start streaming instantly > Johnson, who was teammates with Warner for five years, even suggested the infamous sandpaper scandal was a reason for Warner to be denied a “hero’s farewell” when his batting form has not been up to scratch. Warner, 37, is determined to play the first three Tests of the summer against Pakistan and bow out in front of his home crowd at the SCG, but he only passed 50 twice as he averaged 29 with the bat over his 10 Ashes innings this winter. Somewhat lost in the fire of Johnson’s attack on Warner, was a separate swipe Johnson took at George Bailey, a national selector. Johnson said Bailey, who only retired from cricket in 2016, was too close to Warner and other members of the Aussie squad to make the tough call to drop Warner. Johnson said Bailey’s handling of Paine’s exit from the Aussie Test captaincy was further proof the former Tasmanian batter’s position was compromised. Tim Paine. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images. “When then-captain Tim Paine’s career was ending over the sexting controversy, chairman of selectors George Bailey said he didn’t want to be part of deciding Paine’s fate because the pair were close friends,” Johnson wrote in the column. “Bailey said he would leave it to then coach Justin Langer and fellow selector Tony Dodemaide to work it out. “The handling of Warner in recent years, who played with Bailey in all three forms, raises the question of whether Bailey was simply too quickly out of playing and into the job and too close to some of the players. “I also wonder what the role of the head selector is these days. It seems to have moved to be a part of the inner sanctum, rather than standing aside from it. There are now throw downs for the players, golfing together and celebrating wins to all hours.” In a surprising twist, Paine said on his Hobart SEN breakfast radio show on Monday morning he enjoyed reading large parts of Johnson’s comments. While speaking in support of Johnson’s decision to share his blunt opinions, Paine also dropped in a sly dig about Johnson’s comments losing their objectivity because of how personal he got with Warner. Mitchell Johnson and Candice Warner and David Warner. Paine said he couldn’t add anything when asked about the relationship between Warner and Johnson — but said exactly what we all think after reading the newspaper article. “I think if you read between the lines, him and Davey Warner clearly don’t get along,” Paine said. “So it’s a bit easier for him to fire a few shots at him. “They’re just different people. I have nothing to shed on that. They’re just different. I’m only reading between the lines. Just reading that tells me that they probably don’t get along. But again some of his points about his (Warner’s) stats and his position in the team and him getting a little bit of extra time were probably ruined by the personal nature of it. “And bringing sandpaper back into it. And saying David being a person who used his leadership role for power. I played with David and he certainly didn’t do that. “I thought the article was pretty good. There were a lot of questions that people wanted to ask and it created a lot of interest and a lot of thought, even from someone like me. “I thought he just went a bit too far on some things that it ruined it for me. The George stuff, I just found it a bit unnecessary.” Paine even defended Bailey’s decision to stand down from the decision that axed Paine as captain, despite that move ultimately adding to the push from senior figures for Paine to be dumped from the team. “If you go through what he (Johnson) said he raised some pretty valid points,” Paine said. “The George stuff I didn’t love. I thought that was a bit unnecessary. Mitchell Johnson unleashed hell. AAP Image/Richard Wainwright. He went on to say of Johnson’s attack on Bailey: “That’s a valid question. He obviously thinks he does. I don’t. I work with George and I think anyone who knows George would never question his integrity or his professionalism or his ability to do that job. I think he’s done an amazing job if you look at the success they’ve had as a team.” Paine said Warner has enough credits in the bank to be given the first shot opening the batting in the First Test against Pakistan — but said Warner should be dropped if he struggles to score runs. Earlier, Johnson turned a flamethrower on Warner, re-igniting his feud with the batter and his wife Candice. A war of words between Johnson and Candice Warner was one of the most surprising beefs of 2023 after the West Australian called for Warner to be dropped from Australia’s Ashes tour in the UK this year as a result of his poor form. Candice hit back at the criticism by saying Johnson was only using her husband’s name to get a headline. Johnson responded again by calling Candice’s support of her husband “cringe”. The feud has exploded again with Johnson now launching a seemingly unprovoked attack on the batsman. Mitchell Johnson with wife Jessica Bratich Johnson and daughter Rubika Ann on the final day of his Test career. Warner first made the call in June — putting Aussie selectors in the hot seat about dropping him from the team with the finish line in sight. Johnson said Warner hasn’t earned it. “Does this really warrant a swan song, a last hurrah against Pakistan that was forecast a year in advance as if he was bigger than the game and the Australian cricket team,” Johnson wrote.

Number 11 batter Gus Atkinson was the only other England batter who did not reach double figures in the first of three ODIs, where the tourists set a target of 326 in their first match since the World Cup. A superb century from Windies captain Shai Hope guides the hosts to victory. Scorecard: — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Speaking after the Windies overhauled England’s total with four wickets and seven balls to spare in an exciting crescendo, Buttler remains optimistic he can turn his fortunes around quickly. “I feel good, I just keep managing to get out,” he said. “It’s disappointing, frustrating and gone on for a lot longer than I would have liked but there’s only myself who can score my own runs. “I’m not going to score any if I hide away and don’t get out there. You keep working hard, you keep putting the effort in and trust that it will turn around.” Buttler is widely-regarded as one of England’s greatest white-ball batters ever and his lean patch has coincided with his side’s listing fortunes – this was their seventh loss in 10 ODIs. England are at the start of a new cycle and there were positives as openers Will Jacks and Phil Salt, neither of whom were selected for the World Cup group stage exit, put on 77 in 8.2 overs. Harry Brook top-scored with 71 off 72 balls, Sam Curran and Brydon Carse put on 66 in 38 balls to lift England to 325 all out – the highest total in ODIs at this venue, a record that lasted a few hours. Rehan Ahmed was the pick of the attack with two for 40 but Curran recorded the most expensive figures by an England bowler in an ODI as he leaked an eye-watering 98 in 9.5 overs. Curran and Carse were unable to stop an onslaught from Windies captain Shai Hope and Romario Shepherd, who put on 89 in 51 balls to turn the tide after the hosts had slipped to 213 for five. Hope clattered three sixes in four balls off Curran to end proceedings, finishing on 109 not out, while Shepherd crunched seven boundaries in his 28-ball stay before being dismissed two shy of fifty. “There’s some young guys in that team who have not played loads and loads of one-day cricket, they’ll learn a lot from this,” Buttler said of a side that had five individuals with fewer than 10 ODI appearances. “A lot of stuff we did really, really well; not well enough to win the game in the end but guys will be better for the experience, learn plenty from that and come back for the next one. “I thought we played really well, I thought the two guys at the top set the tone really well. We were positive and aggressive and put the pressure on the West Indies at the start. “We just didn’t quite close it out. There’s no need to panic, we’ve done a lot of things really well, there’s guys who have gained experience from this and we look forward to the next one (on Wednesday).” The Windies are also at the outset of a new era, having failed to qualify for the World Cup, but it was Hope, a champion performer who reached 5,000 ODI runs in his knock, who was their star on Sunday. “This definitely gives us confidence for the rest of the series,” Hope said. “We’ve got to make sure the guys believe they can win in any situation. It’s great we can start this way.”","pubDate":"2023-12-03 22:53:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f340b761dfb88db34d6ad8b83c41b95c","title":"UK cricket fans react to Mitch Johnson’s dig at David Warner","link":"https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/british-cricket-fans-react-to-mitch-johnsons-furious-column-attacking-david-warners-likely-farewell-test-match/news-story/8d55c4320e2fb864dd6d811a4f3834cd","keywords":["Sport","Australia","cricket","David Warner","Mitchell Johnson","Outburst","rant","sport","Test Cricket"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"British cricket fans have lapped up Mitchell Johnson’s furious outburst at David Warner in a newspaper column published over the weekend.","content":"The former Australian fast bowler penned his scathing attack on Warner’s likely farewell from Test cricket at the New Year’s Test at the SCG for The West Australian. In the column Johnson questioned why Warner deserved a “hero’s send-off” after his form in recent years. “As we prepare for David Warner’s farewell series, can somebody please tell me why?” Johnson wrote. “Why a struggling Test opener gets to nominate his own retirement date. “And why a player at the centre of one of the biggest scandals in Australian cricket history warrants a hero’s send-off?” Johnson continued his attack citing his former teammate’s role in the infamous ball tampering scandal in 2018 which saw him banned for 12 months. \"It's been five years and David Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal. \"He has a decent overall record and some say is one of our greatest opening bats. But his past three years in Test cricket have been ordinary, with a batting average closer to what a tailender would be happy with. \"Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.\" Warner has been a perennial enemy to England and the nation’s cricket fans were loving Johson’s furious outburst on social media. “Never thought highly of Mitchell Johnson until this moment!!!!” wrote one fan. “Wild I find myself agreeing with Johnson, first time EVER!” added another. A third commented: “Mitch I’ve finally found a reason to love you! Absolutely spot on… he’s a cheat and should be remembered as so.” “Well said should never have been allowed back in the Australian side nor Steve smith either,” wrote another. The comments came as Warner was named in the 14 man squad to play in the first Test match against Pakistan on December 14 in Perth where Johnson is likely to run into the players as he commentates for Triple M. Warner has previously stated he will hang up the baggy green after the New Year’s Test in Sydney and his selection in the first Test of the three match series against Pakistan all but guarantees he will get a farewell in front of his home fans. Johnson and Warner played alongside each other for several years including Australia’s 2013/14 Ashes whitewash and 2015 Word Cup victory. Johnson’s column also included an attack on chairman of selectors George Bailey – also a former teammate – for appearing to show favouritism to Warner. \"The handling of Warner in recent years, who played with Bailey in all three forms, raises the question of whether Bailey was simply too quickly out of playing and into the job and too close to some of the players,” Johnson wrote. Upon the announcement of the squad Bailey was asked about the column and he brushed it off insisting Warner was in the best 11 players in the country. “I’ve been sent little snippets of it – I hope he’s OK. I’ve got no idea (if he is),” Bailey said. Johnson played 73 Test matches for Australia taking 313 wickets and averaged 22.2 with the bat. Warner has played 109 Tests and scoring 8,487 runs at an average of 44.43 and currently is the seventh highest Test match run scorer for Australia and second highest opener just 138 runs behind Matthew Hayden.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 22:53:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","source_priority":13361,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"fc2c6ac8dbda43692c1dc1a147662494","title":"Feud between Warners and Mitchell Johnson explodes as selector George Bailey hits back","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/feud-between-warners-and-mitchell-johnson-explodes-as-selector-george-bailey-hits-back-c-12777159","keywords":null,"creator":["Cameron Noakes"],"video_url":null,"description":"There is no love lost between these former teammates.","content":"Australian chairman of selectors George Bailey has responded to that tore strips off David Warner and questioned his selection in the Test team. Johnson has questioned Warner’s “hero send-off” and opened up old wounds from Sandpapergate as the 37-year-old opener prepares to bow out of Test cricket in January. “It’s been five years and Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal,” Warner wrote. “Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.” Johnson and Warner are former teammates and he also played with Bailey. But it is not the first time Johnson has had a crack at Warner. Ahead of the tour of England, Johnson said Warner’s Test form was not “up to scratch” and did not think he should be selected. That prompted a reaction from Warner’s wife Candice, who called Johnson irrelevant. “It doesn’t surprise me because he doesn’t have a lot to do with media anymore and I feel like the only way he gets a headline is by using David’s name,’’ she said at the time. “Everyone takes his comments with a grain of salt. They don’t have a lot of merit.” Warner has scored just one Test century since January, 2020, and others — including former captain and respected commentator Ricky Ponting — . But speaking after the squad for the first Test against Pakistan was named on Sunday, Bailey said Warner’s ability to put the opposition under pressure with his batting is “pretty special and not to be taken lightly”. Bailey said it would be impossible to replace Warner as an opener, comparing it to when leg-spinner Shane Warne retired. “I’d put David in that category, the way he’s opened the batting for Australia for such a long period,” Bailey said. Johnson also had a shot at Bailey, saying he was too close to the players as a selector. That prompted an ice-cold response from Bailey. “I’ve been sent little snippets of it ... I hope he’s OK,” Bailey said. “My only question would be ... if someone can show me how being distant and unaware of what players are going through and what the plans are with their team and the coaching staff, how that’s more beneficial, I’d be all ears,” Bailey said. Warner has expressed a desire to finish his red-ball career at home when Australia face Pakistan in the third and final Test of the series at the SCG. He and Johnson played together for Australia for more than five years, including in the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash and the 2015 ODI World Cup victory. “As we prepare for David Warner’s farewell series, can somebody please tell me why?” Johnson wrote in The West Australian. “Why a struggling Test opener gets to nominate his own retirement date. “And why a player at the centre of one of the biggest scandals in Australian cricket history warrants a hero’s send-off?” Johnson’s attack on Warner comes two years after he savaged Pat Cummins in his same newspaper column amid the fallout from Justin Langer’s exit as Australian coach. The 42-year-old’s relationship with his fast-bowling brethren Cummins and Mitchell Starc has not been the same since. Johnson took 313 wickets in 73 Tests for Australia, retiring in November 2015.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:52:32","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12777159/3cc07da33db1b2819d68dd17d415dd7d2b085128-16x9-x0y2w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3370bcb957d03d4c2e43979823b7afb6","title":"“Virat Kohli has to show he is a better option in T20Is”: Sanjay Manjrekar","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/12/virat-kohli-has-to-show-he-is-a-better-option-in-t20is-sanjay-manjrekar/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The News Mill","content":"Amid a debate on whether batting stalwart Virat Kohli should feature in India’s squad for the T20I World Cup next year, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said he needs to perform well in the shortest format to show that he is a better option than the youngsters. Kohli, who was the top run-getter in the ODI World Cup earlier this year, is currently on a break from limited-overs cricket after India’s defeat to Australia in the final. Speaking on Star Sports, Manjrekar said the India skipper will face competition from Hardik Pandya when it comes to selection for the shortest format going forward. “Virat Kohli will have to show that he is a better option than the youngsters who are playing currently, and Rohit Sharma as T20 batter and captain vs Hardik Pandya, the T20 batter, all-rounder and captain,” Manjrekar said. Ahead of the upcoming T20I World Cup, the 58-year-old also asked the team management to pick the squad on form and not reputation. “Who knows what’s in store in life? I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I believe the approach should be extremely simple. We have played a lot of World Cups and haven’t been able to win them. We are maybe playing slightly different cricket in the final stages of World Cups. When something goes out of your hand, simplify it. Pick your team based on form close to the World Cup,” he added. Before the start of the 2024 T20 World Cup, India will look to play more 20-over matches to give themselves the best chance of winning the tournament. The ‘Men In Blue’ on Sunday won the last match of the ongoing T20I series against Australia in Bengaluru, taking the series 4-1. Led by Shreyas Iyer (53 runs from 37 balls) and all-rounder Axar Patel (31 off 21 balls), who came together for a solid partnership, the hosts posted 160 on the board. After a rollicking start, the Aussies fell away in the chase, losing wickets at regular intervals. However, Aussie skipper Matthew Wade (36 runs from 23 balls) brought the equation down to 10 off 4 balls but Arshdeep bowled a splendid last over to take hosts to a narrow win.

Only nine international player spots remain up for grabs, with 17 Australian players nominated for the auction among a pool of 165. Garth, the former Irish quick who was named player of the series when Australia thrashed the West Indies in three T20 games in October, nominated for the highest price bracket of 50 lakh ($A90,000) along with only one other player – West Indian star Deandra Dottin. Litchfield could be in line for a six-figure payday after displaying her versatility with a series of explosive innings at No.6 against the West Indies, while Melbourne Stars left-arm spinner Sophie Day nominated for the lowest base price (about $18,000) and could be scooped up after she was the leading WBBL wicket-taker.

After unveiling Morris, dubbed the “wild thing” in a 14-man Test squad for the series against Pakistan which begins on December 14, Bailey suggested the first-choice attack of Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pay Cummins were expected to be “fit and firing” despite a heavy World Cup workload. Both Morris and Scott Boland have been included amid an expectation they could be called upon if not against Pakistan then maybe the two matches which follow against the West Indies. Bailey said selectors were keen to exploit the “unique talent” possessed by Morris, but are conscious of his progress having taken 11 Sheffield Shield wickets this season coming off a stress fracture injury which sidelined him during the Australian winter. Exactly when Morris will make his test debut remains unclear but the fondness selectors hold for him cannot be denied. “We clearly like the skillset there and have done for quite a little while,” he said. “An unfortunate injury for him over the winter and he’s had to work had to get back playing and he’s feeling really good. (He’s a) bull at a gate in terms of wanting to get out there playing, as all players are. “Where we’re at with him at the moment is trying to get him to work backwards a little bit and try and get his mindset (right) with him if an opportunity arises during the summer, (figuring out) what does that look like for him to be at his absolute best and cherry ripe and respecting the fact he has come back off a back stress fracture which is clearly a debilitating and challenging injury to get over. “But we’re thrilled to see how he’s progressed through the games with Western Australia, I think he’s got better and better each opportunity and I know he’s referenced in the past how much he loves being around the Australian team and particularly around those senior fast bowlers. “... It’s a unique skillset (he has), there’s lots of areas where players can get better and improve but having that raw speed is pretty unique.” Bailey was also keen to point that they didn’t just see Morris as a potential replacement for Starc, should be get injured. He said there was a scenario where they would play together, which could be a fearsome new ball attack with extreme pace at both ends. “There’s potential for it, interestingly with quicks everyone tends to look at it as a bunch and if one comes out then there’s a running line that one comes in,” he said. “But I think much like a batting line-up, for the team as a whole it’s about how that functions and what you want from each bowler, depending on the surface that you’re on and who you’re playing against and what you actually need from the team. “Clearly both of those guys are our quickest bowlers so there’s some similarities there, but I think as Lance continues to develop there’s no reason why they couldn’t play in the same team.”","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:12:03","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-12777579/7a189abdb44b9e3e7bd3ff14c4072f5adc2bf531-16x9-x0y192w2047h1151.jpg","source_id":"thewest","source_priority":106740,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7cf9802677cb63fc8fe18e122c0f2699","title":"Australian skipper Matthew Wade spits fire at last-over blunder in defeat to India","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-skipper-matthew-wade-spits-fire-at-last-over-blunder-in-defeat-to-india-c-12774301","keywords":null,"creator":["Justin Chadwick"],"video_url":null,"description":"Matthew Wade was still fuming after the match, unable to wrap his head around what went down in India.","content":"Australia captain Matthew Wade has been left fuming at a late umpiring blunder as India secured a dramatic six-run victory in the fifth and final in Bengaluru. Allrounder Aaron Hardie (1-21) and spinner Tanveer Sangha (1-26) had produced strong displays with the ball as Australia restricted India to 8-160 on Sunday night (Monday AEDT). In reply, Ben McDermott (54 off 36 balls) provided the early fireworks before Australia fell in a hole, needing 32 runs off 17 balls and with only three wickets in hand. Wade (22 off 15) changed the equation in the blink of an eye with three consecutive boundaries off the bowling of Avesh Khan. Australia needed 10 runs off the final over - bowled by paceman Arshdeep Singh. It was from there that the wheels fell off completely for Australia - in some instances through no fault of their own. Singh’s first delivery was a bouncer that clearly sailed over Wade’s head. Wade was left incredulous - and incensed - when no wide was called by the square leg umpire, with the veteran gesturing angrily at the non-call. “Matthew Wade’s not happy with that. He’s quite cross with that decision,” the commentator said. Australian great Matthew Hayden added: “You can see why he was upset. That was definitely a wide, way over his head there.” The next ball was a yorker that Wade could only bunt for no run, and he holed out on the third delivery of the over when he was caught in the deep. A Jason Behrendorff single meant Australia needed nine runs off the final two balls. But their victory hopes were ended when the central umpire couldn’t get out of the way in time when Nathan Ellis bludgeoned the fifth delivery straight back down the ground. It meant instead of a registering a boundary, Australia could only scamper through for a single, their hopes over as they went on to finish at 8-154. The result enabled India to wrap up a 4-1 series win. “It’s hard to wrap my head around at the moment after not being able to get us home,” Wade said of the loss. “I thought we bowled relatively well. We kept them to a total that probably should have been chased at this ground. It’s pretty disappointing. “It would have been nice to get the result tonight. I think 3-2 would have been a reflection of where the series was at. “It would’ve been nice to get the result, but we keep learning, and I thought Ben McDermott bounced back, and Behrendorff, Dwarshuis and Sangha all made an impact in tough conditions.” India slumped to 4-55 after 9.1 overs before handy knocks from Shreyas Iyer (53 off 37 balls) and Axar Patel (31 off 21) lifted the home side to a defendable total. Australian paceman Ben Dwarshuis snared 2-5 from his first two overs, but he copped some punishment from that point on to finish with 2-30. Australia’s run chase started off strongly, with Travis Head (28 off 18 balls) and McDermott in the thick of the action. McDermott struck five sixes during his blistering knock - one of which he launched 98 metres and out of the stadium. But each time Australia looked like they had the game in their control, a clump of wickets would follow. Mukesh Kumar snared the scalps of Matt Short (16) and Dwarshuis (0) in consecutive deliveries as Australia crumpled to 7-129, and Wade was unable to lift the team over the line despite producing some clutch boundaries. Axar Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 1-14 off four overs, but Singh was the hero after conceding just three runs from the final over.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:04:37","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12774301/496525223dce11b896c6e418e56ef076b717eb90-16x9-x0y0w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"edd00ec60fae29d2a32b9ea49b95d003","title":"Clue to Lanning’s future as T20 league nears","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/meg-lanning-retained-by-delhi-capitals-ahead-of-wpl-auction/news-story/1666f540cc08966ec47c72f04cf8d4d3","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","Sport news and galleries","Womens Cricket"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"Meg Lanning has been retained by her Indian T20 franchise Delhi Capitals in a sign the batting great will continue to play cricket next year.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

Meg Lanning (right) enjoys a chat with Alyssa Healy before their sides met during the inaugural season of the WPL. Picture: BCCI The 31-year-old, who captained Delhi in the inaugural WPL season, is set to rejoin the side along with Brisbane Heat pair Jess Jonassen and Laura Harris. Six of the 15 Australians who played in last year’s tournament were released by their franchises ahead of the auction, including Sutherland, Georgia Wareham and Kim Garth. Only nine international player spots remain up for grabs, with 17 Australian players nominated for the auction among a pool of 165. Garth, the former Irish quick who was named player of the series when Australia thrashed the West Indies in three T20 games in October, nominated for the highest price bracket of 50 lakh ($A90,000) along with only one other player – West Indian star Deandra Dottin. Sydney Thunder left-hander Phoebe Litchfield looms as the most sought after Australian player at Saturday’s WPL auction. Picture: Phil Hillyard Litchfield could be in line for a six-figure payday after displaying her versatility with a series of explosive innings at No.6 against the West Indies, while Melbourne Stars left-arm spinner Sophie Day nominated for the lowest base price (about $18,000) and could be scooped up after she was the leading WBBL wicket-taker. Fellow spinners Alana King and Amanda-Jade Wellington have also nominated and could attract clubs. Ash Gardner and Beth Mooney were retained by the Gujarat Giants, while Ellyse Perry will continue at Royal Challengers Bangalore. WBBL-winning captain Tahlia McGrath, Alyssa Healy and Grace Harris will all reunite with the Uttar Pradesh Warriorz.

The first one-day international of what has become a new white-ball beginning after England’s World Cup capitulation was a case of more of the same for a captain who insisted before this game that his leadership would not be defined by two shocking months in India . Fact is, there was a strong case for Buttler to stand down after the World Cup and concentrate on batting that made him the greatest white-ball talent in England’s history. After all, England were so bad in India that Buttler and coach Matthew Mott should consider themselves fortunate that both lived to fight another white-ball day, starting with a tour of the Caribbean that has suddenly assumed far greater importance than expected. It is understandable Buttler did not want to go out on such a low as captain, particularly as he only has to get through until June before defending the Twenty20 World Cup title England won in his first tournament in charge last year. Jos Buttler still looked nothing like his old self in England’s opening defeat against West Indies His out of character, timid contribution of three to England’s 325 brought back bad memories But his out of character, timid contribution of just three to England’s 325 brought back painful recent memories of a World Cup that, statistically, was even worse than the watershed tournament of 2015 that led to their white-ball revolution in the first place. In truth, this was still not the aggressive, no fear, dynamic batting that took England under Eoin Morgan from rock bottom to World Cup winners in 2019 and the dominant white-ball force in international cricket for close to a decade. The start certainly was. There were very much echoes of the way Jason Roy and Alex Hales, and then Jonny Bairstow, launched that new era eight years ago in the way Phil Salt and Will Jacks went about England’s innings after Buttler won the toss yesterday. It is perhaps no coincidence that neither was in India but they carried on where they left off against Ireland at the end of last summer and set off in such an explosive manner that a recuperative total of 400 looked the very least of England’s ambitions. And it was significant England went for this pairing rather than the Test opening partnership of Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett that followed them in the order in Antigua in the absence of the rested Joe Root and Bairstow. Investment has to be made in Salt and Jacks right up until the next World Cup and certainly in the 10 remaining one-day internationals that represent England’s only 50-over fixtures ahead of the Champions Trophy in 2025. Investment has to be made in Phil Salt (L) and Will Jacks right up until the next World Cup Both are desperately unlucky not to have been among the 29 players handed England central-contracts by Rob Key ahead of the World Cup but both have huge futures in this team, in the one-day side and the T20 one that will defend the short-form crown. Otherwise England’s batting was unconvincing and still largely lacking in the bravery and conviction that became second nature under Morgan and in the early days of Buttler’s captaincy before it all came crashing down in such spectacular fashion. It was interesting to hear Sir Alastair Cook saying in the TNT Sports studio on Sunday that his England captaincy only really came into its own after the toxic 5-0 Ashes defeat in 2013-14. Before then, Cook said, he was merely carrying on Sir Andrew Strauss’s work. There was nothing like the divisions in the camp in India that marred Cook’s tour of Australia 10 years ago but Buttler is carrying on now after a similar low. And England’s total on Sunday was put in perspective by Shai Hope as he inspired West Indies to a dramatic four-wicket victory with seven balls to spare with an unbeaten century. Clearly, there is much work still to do for the captain yet.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Tim Paine said exactly what we’re all thinking after Mitchell Johnson dropped a bomb on Australian cricket. The former fast-bowler sent shockwaves across the cricketing world when he took a personal swipe at David Warner and the opening batter’s plans to retire. The Ashes destroyer’s explosive column in The West Australian said “arrogance” was behind Warner’s declaration he will retire after one final New Year’s Test in Sydney. The BBL is back! Watch every match live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. Join Kayo now and start streaming instantly > Johnson, who was teammates with Warner for five years, even suggested the infamous sandpaper scandal was a reason for Warner to be denied a “hero’s farewell” when his batting form has not been up to scratch. Warner, 37, is determined to play the first three Tests of the summer against Pakistan and bow out in front of his home crowd at the SCG, but he only passed 50 twice as he averaged 29 with the bat over his 10 Ashes innings this winter. Somewhat lost in the fire of Johnson’s attack on Warner, was a separate swipe Johnson took at George Bailey, a national selector. Johnson said Bailey, who only retired from cricket in 2016, was too close to Warner and other members of the Aussie squad to make the tough call to drop Warner. Johnson said Bailey’s handling of Paine’s exit from the Aussie Test captaincy was further proof the former Tasmanian batter’s position was compromised. Tim Paine. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images. “When then-captain Tim Paine’s career was ending over the sexting controversy, chairman of selectors George Bailey said he didn’t want to be part of deciding Paine’s fate because the pair were close friends,” Johnson wrote in the column. “Bailey said he would leave it to then coach Justin Langer and fellow selector Tony Dodemaide to work it out. “The handling of Warner in recent years, who played with Bailey in all three forms, raises the question of whether Bailey was simply too quickly out of playing and into the job and too close to some of the players. “I also wonder what the role of the head selector is these days. It seems to have moved to be a part of the inner sanctum, rather than standing aside from it. There are now throw downs for the players, golfing together and celebrating wins to all hours.” In a surprising twist, Paine said on his Hobart SEN breakfast radio show on Monday morning he enjoyed reading large parts of Johnson’s comments. While speaking in support of Johnson’s decision to share his blunt opinions, Paine also dropped in a sly dig about Johnson’s comments losing their objectivity because of how personal he got with Warner. Mitchell Johnson and Candice Warner and David Warner. Paine said he couldn’t add anything when asked about the relationship between Warner and Johnson — but said exactly what we all think after reading the newspaper article. “I think if you read between the lines, him and Davey Warner clearly don’t get along,” Paine said. “So it’s a bit easier for him to fire a few shots at him. “They’re just different people. I have nothing to shed on that. They’re just different. I’m only reading between the lines. Just reading that tells me that they probably don’t get along. But again some of his points about his (Warner’s) stats and his position in the team and him getting a little bit of extra time were probably ruined by the personal nature of it. “And bringing sandpaper back into it. And saying David being a person who used his leadership role for power. I played with David and he certainly didn’t do that. “I thought the article was pretty good. There were a lot of questions that people wanted to ask and it created a lot of interest and a lot of thought, even from someone like me. “I thought he just went a bit too far on some things that it ruined it for me. The George stuff, I just found it a bit unnecessary.” Paine even defended Bailey’s decision to stand down from the decision that axed Paine as captain, despite that move ultimately adding to the push from senior figures for Paine to be dumped from the team. “If you go through what he (Johnson) said he raised some pretty valid points,” Paine said. “The George stuff I didn’t love. I thought that was a bit unnecessary. Mitchell Johnson unleashed hell. AAP Image/Richard Wainwright. He went on to say of Johnson’s attack on Bailey: “That’s a valid question. He obviously thinks he does. I don’t. I work with George and I think anyone who knows George would never question his integrity or his professionalism or his ability to do that job. I think he’s done an amazing job if you look at the success they’ve had as a team.” Paine said Warner has enough credits in the bank to be given the first shot opening the batting in the First Test against Pakistan — but said Warner should be dropped if he struggles to score runs. Earlier, Johnson turned a flamethrower on Warner, re-igniting his feud with the batter and his wife Candice. A war of words between Johnson and Candice Warner was one of the most surprising beefs of 2023 after the West Australian called for Warner to be dropped from Australia’s Ashes tour in the UK this year as a result of his poor form. Candice hit back at the criticism by saying Johnson was only using her husband’s name to get a headline. Johnson responded again by calling Candice’s support of her husband “cringe”. The feud has exploded again with Johnson now launching a seemingly unprovoked attack on the batsman. Mitchell Johnson with wife Jessica Bratich Johnson and daughter Rubika Ann on the final day of his Test career. Warner first made the call in June — putting Aussie selectors in the hot seat about dropping him from the team with the finish line in sight. Johnson said Warner hasn’t earned it. “Does this really warrant a swan song, a last hurrah against Pakistan that was forecast a year in advance as if he was bigger than the game and the Australian cricket team,” Johnson wrote.

Number 11 batter Gus Atkinson was the only other England batter who did not reach double figures in the first of three ODIs, where the tourists set a target of 326 in their first match since the World Cup. A superb century from Windies captain Shai Hope guides the hosts to victory. Scorecard: — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Speaking after the Windies overhauled England’s total with four wickets and seven balls to spare in an exciting crescendo, Buttler remains optimistic he can turn his fortunes around quickly. “I feel good, I just keep managing to get out,” he said. “It’s disappointing, frustrating and gone on for a lot longer than I would have liked but there’s only myself who can score my own runs. “I’m not going to score any if I hide away and don’t get out there. You keep working hard, you keep putting the effort in and trust that it will turn around.” Buttler is widely-regarded as one of England’s greatest white-ball batters ever and his lean patch has coincided with his side’s listing fortunes – this was their seventh loss in 10 ODIs. England are at the start of a new cycle and there were positives as openers Will Jacks and Phil Salt, neither of whom were selected for the World Cup group stage exit, put on 77 in 8.2 overs. Harry Brook top-scored with 71 off 72 balls, Sam Curran and Brydon Carse put on 66 in 38 balls to lift England to 325 all out – the highest total in ODIs at this venue, a record that lasted a few hours. Rehan Ahmed was the pick of the attack with two for 40 but Curran recorded the most expensive figures by an England bowler in an ODI as he leaked an eye-watering 98 in 9.5 overs. Curran and Carse were unable to stop an onslaught from Windies captain Shai Hope and Romario Shepherd, who put on 89 in 51 balls to turn the tide after the hosts had slipped to 213 for five. Hope clattered three sixes in four balls off Curran to end proceedings, finishing on 109 not out, while Shepherd crunched seven boundaries in his 28-ball stay before being dismissed two shy of fifty. “There’s some young guys in that team who have not played loads and loads of one-day cricket, they’ll learn a lot from this,” Buttler said of a side that had five individuals with fewer than 10 ODI appearances. “A lot of stuff we did really, really well; not well enough to win the game in the end but guys will be better for the experience, learn plenty from that and come back for the next one. “I thought we played really well, I thought the two guys at the top set the tone really well. We were positive and aggressive and put the pressure on the West Indies at the start. “We just didn’t quite close it out. There’s no need to panic, we’ve done a lot of things really well, there’s guys who have gained experience from this and we look forward to the next one (on Wednesday).” The Windies are also at the outset of a new era, having failed to qualify for the World Cup, but it was Hope, a champion performer who reached 5,000 ODI runs in his knock, who was their star on Sunday. “This definitely gives us confidence for the rest of the series,” Hope said. “We’ve got to make sure the guys believe they can win in any situation. It’s great we can start this way.”","pubDate":"2023-12-03 22:53:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f340b761dfb88db34d6ad8b83c41b95c","title":"UK cricket fans react to Mitch Johnson’s dig at David Warner","link":"https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/british-cricket-fans-react-to-mitch-johnsons-furious-column-attacking-david-warners-likely-farewell-test-match/news-story/8d55c4320e2fb864dd6d811a4f3834cd","keywords":["Sport","Australia","cricket","David Warner","Mitchell Johnson","Outburst","rant","sport","Test Cricket"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"British cricket fans have lapped up Mitchell Johnson’s furious outburst at David Warner in a newspaper column published over the weekend.","content":"The former Australian fast bowler penned his scathing attack on Warner’s likely farewell from Test cricket at the New Year’s Test at the SCG for The West Australian.

But his past three years in Test cricket have been ordinary, with a batting average closer to what a tailender would be happy with. \"Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.\" Warner has been a perennial enemy to England and the nation’s cricket fans were loving Johson’s furious outburst on social media. “Never thought highly of Mitchell Johnson until this moment!!!!” wrote one fan. “Wild I find myself agreeing with Johnson, first time EVER!” added another. A third commented: “Mitch I’ve finally found a reason to love you! Absolutely spot on… he’s a cheat and should be remembered as so.” “Well said should never have been allowed back in the Australian side nor Steve smith either,” wrote another. The comments came as Warner was named in the 14 man squad to play in the first Test match against Pakistan on December 14 in Perth where Johnson is likely to run into the players as he commentates for Triple M. Warner has previously stated he will hang up the baggy green after the New Year’s Test in Sydney and his selection in the first Test of the three match series against Pakistan all but guarantees he will get a farewell in front of his home fans. Johnson and Warner played alongside each other for several years including Australia’s 2013/14 Ashes whitewash and 2015 Word Cup victory. Johnson’s column also included an attack on chairman of selectors George Bailey – also a former teammate – for appearing to show favouritism to Warner. \"The handling of Warner in recent years, who played with Bailey in all three forms, raises the question of whether Bailey was simply too quickly out of playing and into the job and too close to some of the players,” Johnson wrote. Upon the announcement of the squad Bailey was asked about the column and he brushed it off insisting Warner was in the best 11 players in the country. “I’ve been sent little snippets of it – I hope he’s OK. I’ve got no idea (if he is),” Bailey said. Johnson played 73 Test matches for Australia taking 313 wickets and averaged 22.2 with the bat. Warner has played 109 Tests and scoring 8,487 runs at an average of 44.43 and currently is the seventh highest Test match run scorer for Australia and second highest opener just 138 runs behind Matthew Hayden.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 22:53:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","source_priority":13361,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"fc2c6ac8dbda43692c1dc1a147662494","title":"Feud between Warners and Mitchell Johnson explodes as selector George Bailey hits back","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/feud-between-warners-and-mitchell-johnson-explodes-as-selector-george-bailey-hits-back-c-12777159","keywords":null,"creator":["Cameron Noakes"],"video_url":null,"description":"There is no love lost between these former teammates.","content":"Australian chairman of selectors George Bailey has responded to that tore strips off David Warner and questioned his selection in the Test team. Johnson has questioned Warner’s “hero send-off” and opened up old wounds from Sandpapergate as the 37-year-old opener prepares to bow out of Test cricket in January. “It’s been five years and Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal,” Warner wrote. “Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.” Johnson and Warner are former teammates and he also played with Bailey. But it is not the first time Johnson has had a crack at Warner. Ahead of the tour of England, Johnson said Warner’s Test form was not “up to scratch” and did not think he should be selected. That prompted a reaction from Warner’s wife Candice, who called Johnson irrelevant. “It doesn’t surprise me because he doesn’t have a lot to do with media anymore and I feel like the only way he gets a headline is by using David’s name,’’ she said at the time. “Everyone takes his comments with a grain of salt. They don’t have a lot of merit.” Warner has scored just one Test century since January, 2020, and others — including former captain and respected commentator Ricky Ponting — . But speaking after the squad for the first Test against Pakistan was named on Sunday, Bailey said Warner’s ability to put the opposition under pressure with his batting is “pretty special and not to be taken lightly”. Bailey said it would be impossible to replace Warner as an opener, comparing it to when leg-spinner Shane Warne retired. “I’d put David in that category, the way he’s opened the batting for Australia for such a long period,” Bailey said. Johnson also had a shot at Bailey, saying he was too close to the players as a selector. That prompted an ice-cold response from Bailey. “I’ve been sent little snippets of it ... I hope he’s OK,” Bailey said. “My only question would be ... if someone can show me how being distant and unaware of what players are going through and what the plans are with their team and the coaching staff, how that’s more beneficial, I’d be all ears,” Bailey said. Warner has expressed a desire to finish his red-ball career at home when Australia face Pakistan in the third and final Test of the series at the SCG. He and Johnson played together for Australia for more than five years, including in the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash and the 2015 ODI World Cup victory. “As we prepare for David Warner’s farewell series, can somebody please tell me why?” Johnson wrote in The West Australian. “Why a struggling Test opener gets to nominate his own retirement date. “And why a player at the centre of one of the biggest scandals in Australian cricket history warrants a hero’s send-off?” Johnson’s attack on Warner comes two years after he savaged Pat Cummins in his same newspaper column amid the fallout from Justin Langer’s exit as Australian coach. The 42-year-old’s relationship with his fast-bowling brethren Cummins and Mitchell Starc has not been the same since. Johnson took 313 wickets in 73 Tests for Australia, retiring in November 2015.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:52:32","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12777159/3cc07da33db1b2819d68dd17d415dd7d2b085128-16x9-x0y2w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"3370bcb957d03d4c2e43979823b7afb6","title":"“Virat Kohli has to show he is a better option in T20Is”: Sanjay Manjrekar","link":"https://thenewsmill.com/2023/12/virat-kohli-has-to-show-he-is-a-better-option-in-t20is-sanjay-manjrekar/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","ANI"],"creator":["ANI"],"video_url":null,"description":"The News Mill","content":"Amid a debate on whether batting stalwart Virat Kohli should feature in India’s squad for the T20I World Cup next year, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said he needs to perform well in the shortest format to show that he is a better option than the youngsters. Kohli, who was the top run-getter in the ODI World Cup earlier this year, is currently on a break from limited-overs cricket after India’s defeat to Australia in the final. Speaking on Star Sports, Manjrekar said the India skipper will face competition from Hardik Pandya when it comes to selection for the shortest format going forward. “Virat Kohli will have to show that he is a better option than the youngsters who are playing currently, and Rohit Sharma as T20 batter and captain vs Hardik Pandya, the T20 batter, all-rounder and captain,” Manjrekar said. Ahead of the upcoming T20I World Cup, the 58-year-old also asked the team management to pick the squad on form and not reputation. “Who knows what’s in store in life? I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I believe the approach should be extremely simple. We have played a lot of World Cups and haven’t been able to win them. We are maybe playing slightly different cricket in the final stages of World Cups. When something goes out of your hand, simplify it. Pick your team based on form close to the World Cup,” he added. Before the start of the 2024 T20 World Cup, India will look to play more 20-over matches to give themselves the best chance of winning the tournament. The ‘Men In Blue’ on Sunday won the last match of the ongoing T20I series against Australia in Bengaluru, taking the series 4-1. Led by Shreyas Iyer (53 runs from 37 balls) and all-rounder Axar Patel (31 off 21 balls), who came together for a solid partnership, the hosts posted 160 on the board. After a rollicking start, the Aussies fell away in the chase, losing wickets at regular intervals.

After unveiling Morris, dubbed the “wild thing” in a 14-man Test squad for the series against Pakistan which begins on December 14, Bailey suggested the first-choice attack of Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pay Cummins were expected to be “fit and firing” despite a heavy World Cup workload. Both Morris and Scott Boland have been included amid an expectation they could be called upon if not against Pakistan then maybe the two matches which follow against the West Indies. Bailey said selectors were keen to exploit the “unique talent” possessed by Morris, but are conscious of his progress having taken 11 Sheffield Shield wickets this season coming off a stress fracture injury which sidelined him during the Australian winter. Exactly when Morris will make his test debut remains unclear but the fondness selectors hold for him cannot be denied. “We clearly like the skillset there and have done for quite a little while,” he said. “An unfortunate injury for him over the winter and he’s had to work had to get back playing and he’s feeling really good. (He’s a) bull at a gate in terms of wanting to get out there playing, as all players are. “Where we’re at with him at the moment is trying to get him to work backwards a little bit and try and get his mindset (right) with him if an opportunity arises during the summer, (figuring out) what does that look like for him to be at his absolute best and cherry ripe and respecting the fact he has come back off a back stress fracture which is clearly a debilitating and challenging injury to get over. “But we’re thrilled to see how he’s progressed through the games with Western Australia, I think he’s got better and better each opportunity and I know he’s referenced in the past how much he loves being around the Australian team and particularly around those senior fast bowlers. “... It’s a unique skillset (he has), there’s lots of areas where players can get better and improve but having that raw speed is pretty unique.” Bailey was also keen to point that they didn’t just see Morris as a potential replacement for Starc, should be get injured. He said there was a scenario where they would play together, which could be a fearsome new ball attack with extreme pace at both ends. “There’s potential for it, interestingly with quicks everyone tends to look at it as a bunch and if one comes out then there’s a running line that one comes in,” he said. “But I think much like a batting line-up, for the team as a whole it’s about how that functions and what you want from each bowler, depending on the surface that you’re on and who you’re playing against and what you actually need from the team. “Clearly both of those guys are our quickest bowlers so there’s some similarities there, but I think as Lance continues to develop there’s no reason why they couldn’t play in the same team.”","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:12:03","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-12777579/7a189abdb44b9e3e7bd3ff14c4072f5adc2bf531-16x9-x0y192w2047h1151.jpg","source_id":"thewest","source_priority":106740,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7cf9802677cb63fc8fe18e122c0f2699","title":"Australian skipper Matthew Wade spits fire at last-over blunder in defeat to India","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-skipper-matthew-wade-spits-fire-at-last-over-blunder-in-defeat-to-india-c-12774301","keywords":null,"creator":["Justin Chadwick"],"video_url":null,"description":"Matthew Wade was still fuming after the match, unable to wrap his head around what went down in India.","content":"Australia captain Matthew Wade has been left fuming at a late umpiring blunder as India secured a dramatic six-run victory in the fifth and final in Bengaluru. Allrounder Aaron Hardie (1-21) and spinner Tanveer Sangha (1-26) had produced strong displays with the ball as Australia restricted India to 8-160 on Sunday night (Monday AEDT). In reply, Ben McDermott (54 off 36 balls) provided the early fireworks before Australia fell in a hole, needing 32 runs off 17 balls and with only three wickets in hand. Wade (22 off 15) changed the equation in the blink of an eye with three consecutive boundaries off the bowling of Avesh Khan. Australia needed 10 runs off the final over - bowled by paceman Arshdeep Singh. It was from there that the wheels fell off completely for Australia - in some instances through no fault of their own. Singh’s first delivery was a bouncer that clearly sailed over Wade’s head. Wade was left incredulous - and incensed - when no wide was called by the square leg umpire, with the veteran gesturing angrily at the non-call. “Matthew Wade’s not happy with that. He’s quite cross with that decision,” the commentator said. Australian great Matthew Hayden added: “You can see why he was upset. That was definitely a wide, way over his head there.” The next ball was a yorker that Wade could only bunt for no run, and he holed out on the third delivery of the over when he was caught in the deep. A Jason Behrendorff single meant Australia needed nine runs off the final two balls. But their victory hopes were ended when the central umpire couldn’t get out of the way in time when Nathan Ellis bludgeoned the fifth delivery straight back down the ground. It meant instead of a registering a boundary, Australia could only scamper through for a single, their hopes over as they went on to finish at 8-154. The result enabled India to wrap up a 4-1 series win. “It’s hard to wrap my head around at the moment after not being able to get us home,” Wade said of the loss. “I thought we bowled relatively well. We kept them to a total that probably should have been chased at this ground. It’s pretty disappointing. “It would have been nice to get the result tonight. I think 3-2 would have been a reflection of where the series was at. “It would’ve been nice to get the result, but we keep learning, and I thought Ben McDermott bounced back, and Behrendorff, Dwarshuis and Sangha all made an impact in tough conditions.” India slumped to 4-55 after 9.1 overs before handy knocks from Shreyas Iyer (53 off 37 balls) and Axar Patel (31 off 21) lifted the home side to a defendable total. Australian paceman Ben Dwarshuis snared 2-5 from his first two overs, but he copped some punishment from that point on to finish with 2-30. Australia’s run chase started off strongly, with Travis Head (28 off 18 balls) and McDermott in the thick of the action. McDermott struck five sixes during his blistering knock - one of which he launched 98 metres and out of the stadium. But each time Australia looked like they had the game in their control, a clump of wickets would follow. Mukesh Kumar snared the scalps of Matt Short (16) and Dwarshuis (0) in consecutive deliveries as Australia crumpled to 7-129, and Wade was unable to lift the team over the line despite producing some clutch boundaries. Axar Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 1-14 off four overs, but Singh was the hero after conceding just three runs from the final over.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 23:04:37","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-12774301/496525223dce11b896c6e418e56ef076b717eb90-16x9-x0y0w1304h734.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"edd00ec60fae29d2a32b9ea49b95d003","title":"Clue to Lanning’s future as T20 league nears","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/meg-lanning-retained-by-delhi-capitals-ahead-of-wpl-auction/news-story/1666f540cc08966ec47c72f04cf8d4d3","keywords":["Breaking News","Cricket news and galleries","National Breaking News","Sport news and galleries","Womens Cricket"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"Meg Lanning has been retained by her Indian T20 franchise Delhi Capitals in a sign the batting great will continue to play cricket next year.","content":"Cricket Don't miss out on the headlines from Cricket.

The first one-day international of what has become a new white-ball beginning after England’s World Cup capitulation was a case of more of the same for a captain who insisted before this game that his leadership would not be defined by two shocking months in India . Fact is, there was a strong case for Buttler to stand down after the World Cup and concentrate on batting that made him the greatest white-ball talent in England’s history. After all, England were so bad in India that Buttler and coach Matthew Mott should consider themselves fortunate that both lived to fight another white-ball day, starting with a tour of the Caribbean that has suddenly assumed far greater importance than expected. It is understandable Buttler did not want to go out on such a low as captain, particularly as he only has to get through until June before defending the Twenty20 World Cup title England won in his first tournament in charge last year. Jos Buttler still looked nothing like his old self in England’s opening defeat against West Indies His out of character, timid contribution of three to England’s 325 brought back bad memories But his out of character, timid contribution of just three to England’s 325 brought back painful recent memories of a World Cup that, statistically, was even worse than the watershed tournament of 2015 that led to their white-ball revolution in the first place. In truth, this was still not the aggressive, no fear, dynamic batting that took England under Eoin Morgan from rock bottom to World Cup winners in 2019 and the dominant white-ball force in international cricket for close to a decade. The start certainly was. There were very much echoes of the way Jason Roy and Alex Hales, and then Jonny Bairstow, launched that new era eight years ago in the way Phil Salt and Will Jacks went about England’s innings after Buttler won the toss yesterday. It is perhaps no coincidence that neither was in India but they carried on where they left off against Ireland at the end of last summer and set off in such an explosive manner that a recuperative total of 400 looked the very least of England’s ambitions. And it was significant England went for this pairing rather than the Test opening partnership of Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett that followed them in the order in Antigua in the absence of the rested Joe Root and Bairstow. Investment has to be made in Salt and Jacks right up until the next World Cup and certainly in the 10 remaining one-day internationals that represent England’s only 50-over fixtures ahead of the Champions Trophy in 2025. Investment has to be made in Phil Salt (L) and Will Jacks right up until the next World Cup Both are desperately unlucky not to have been among the 29 players handed England central-contracts by Rob Key ahead of the World Cup but both have huge futures in this team, in the one-day side and the T20 one that will defend the short-form crown. Otherwise England’s batting was unconvincing and still largely lacking in the bravery and conviction that became second nature under Morgan and in the early days of Buttler’s captaincy before it all came crashing down in such spectacular fashion. It was interesting to hear Sir Alastair Cook saying in the TNT Sports studio on Sunday that his England captaincy only really came into its own after the toxic 5-0 Ashes defeat in 2013-14. Before then, Cook said, he was merely carrying on Sir Andrew Strauss’s work. There was nothing like the divisions in the camp in India that marred Cook’s tour of Australia 10 years ago but Buttler is carrying on now after a similar low. And England’s total on Sunday was put in perspective by Shai Hope as he inspired West Indies to a dramatic four-wicket victory with seven balls to spare with an unbeaten century. Clearly, there is much work still to do for the captain yet.

Followed categories will be added to My News. Tim Paine said exactly what we’re all thinking after Mitchell Johnson dropped a bomb on Australian cricket. The former fast-bowler sent shockwaves across the cricketing world when he took a personal swipe at David Warner and the opening batter’s plans to retire. The Ashes destroyer’s explosive column in The West Australian said “arrogance” was behind Warner’s declaration he will retire after one final New Year’s Test in Sydney. The BBL is back! Watch every match live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. Join Kayo now and start streaming instantly > Johnson, who was teammates with Warner for five years, even suggested the infamous sandpaper scandal was a reason for Warner to be denied a “hero’s farewell” when his batting form has not been up to scratch. Warner, 37, is determined to play the first three Tests of the summer against Pakistan and bow out in front of his home crowd at the SCG, but he only passed 50 twice as he averaged 29 with the bat over his 10 Ashes innings this winter. Somewhat lost in the fire of Johnson’s attack on Warner, was a separate swipe Johnson took at George Bailey, a national selector. Johnson said Bailey, who only retired from cricket in 2016, was too close to Warner and other members of the Aussie squad to make the tough call to drop Warner. Johnson said Bailey’s handling of Paine’s exit from the Aussie Test captaincy was further proof the former Tasmanian batter’s position was compromised. Tim Paine. Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images. “When then-captain Tim Paine’s career was ending over the sexting controversy, chairman of selectors George Bailey said he didn’t want to be part of deciding Paine’s fate because the pair were close friends,” Johnson wrote in the column. “Bailey said he would leave it to then coach Justin Langer and fellow selector Tony Dodemaide to work it out. “The handling of Warner in recent years, who played with Bailey in all three forms, raises the question of whether Bailey was simply too quickly out of playing and into the job and too close to some of the players. “I also wonder what the role of the head selector is these days. It seems to have moved to be a part of the inner sanctum, rather than standing aside from it. There are now throw downs for the players, golfing together and celebrating wins to all hours.” In a surprising twist, Paine said on his Hobart SEN breakfast radio show on Monday morning he enjoyed reading large parts of Johnson’s comments. While speaking in support of Johnson’s decision to share his blunt opinions, Paine also dropped in a sly dig about Johnson’s comments losing their objectivity because of how personal he got with Warner. Mitchell Johnson and Candice Warner and David Warner. Paine said he couldn’t add anything when asked about the relationship between Warner and Johnson — but said exactly what we all think after reading the newspaper article. “I think if you read between the lines, him and Davey Warner clearly don’t get along,” Paine said. “So it’s a bit easier for him to fire a few shots at him. “They’re just different people. I have nothing to shed on that. They’re just different. I’m only reading between the lines. Just reading that tells me that they probably don’t get along. But again some of his points about his (Warner’s) stats and his position in the team and him getting a little bit of extra time were probably ruined by the personal nature of it. “And bringing sandpaper back into it. And saying David being a person who used his leadership role for power. I played with David and he certainly didn’t do that. “I thought the article was pretty good. There were a lot of questions that people wanted to ask and it created a lot of interest and a lot of thought, even from someone like me. “I thought he just went a bit too far on some things that it ruined it for me. The George stuff, I just found it a bit unnecessary.” Paine even defended Bailey’s decision to stand down from the decision that axed Paine as captain, despite that move ultimately adding to the push from senior figures for Paine to be dumped from the team. “If you go through what he (Johnson) said he raised some pretty valid points,” Paine said. “The George stuff I didn’t love. I thought that was a bit unnecessary. Mitchell Johnson unleashed hell. AAP Image/Richard Wainwright. He went on to say of Johnson’s attack on Bailey: “That’s a valid question. He obviously thinks he does. I don’t. I work with George and I think anyone who knows George would never question his integrity or his professionalism or his ability to do that job. I think he’s done an amazing job if you look at the success they’ve had as a team.” Paine said Warner has enough credits in the bank to be given the first shot opening the batting in the First Test against Pakistan — but said Warner should be dropped if he struggles to score runs. Earlier, Johnson turned a flamethrower on Warner, re-igniting his feud with the batter and his wife Candice. A war of words between Johnson and Candice Warner was one of the most surprising beefs of 2023 after the West Australian called for Warner to be dropped from Australia’s Ashes tour in the UK this year as a result of his poor form. Candice hit back at the criticism by saying Johnson was only using her husband’s name to get a headline. Johnson responded again by calling Candice’s support of her husband “cringe”. The feud has exploded again with Johnson now launching a seemingly unprovoked attack on the batsman. Mitchell Johnson with wife Jessica Bratich Johnson and daughter Rubika Ann on the final day of his Test career. Warner first made the call in June — putting Aussie selectors in the hot seat about dropping him from the team with the finish line in sight. Johnson said Warner hasn’t earned it. “Does this really warrant a swan song, a last hurrah against Pakistan that was forecast a year in advance as if he was bigger than the game and the Australian cricket team,” Johnson wrote. More Coverage India dumps on Aussies in final T20 loss Kyrgios never read Shane Warne’s letter “It’s been five years and Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal. “Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.” Johnson also took an extraordinary shot at Warner’s farewell tour by suggesting fans in Sydney will have to bring cuts of sandpaper to wave in the same way fans famously waved red hankies to honour Steve Waugh in his final Test.

Number 11 batter Gus Atkinson was the only other England batter who did not reach double figures in the first of three ODIs, where the tourists set a target of 326 in their first match since the World Cup. A superb century from Windies captain Shai Hope guides the hosts to victory. Scorecard: — England Cricket (@englandcricket) Speaking after the Windies overhauled England’s total with four wickets and seven balls to spare in an exciting crescendo, Buttler remains optimistic he can turn his fortunes around quickly. “I feel good, I just keep managing to get out,” he said. “It’s disappointing, frustrating and gone on for a lot longer than I would have liked but there’s only myself who can score my own runs. “I’m not going to score any if I hide away and don’t get out there. You keep working hard, you keep putting the effort in and trust that it will turn around.” Buttler is widely-regarded as one of England’s greatest white-ball batters ever and his lean patch has coincided with his side’s listing fortunes – this was their seventh loss in 10 ODIs. England are at the start of a new cycle and there were positives as openers Will Jacks and Phil Salt, neither of whom were selected for the World Cup group stage exit, put on 77 in 8.2 overs. Harry Brook top-scored with 71 off 72 balls, Sam Curran and Brydon Carse put on 66 in 38 balls to lift England to 325 all out – the highest total in ODIs at this venue, a record that lasted a few hours. Rehan Ahmed was the pick of the attack with two for 40 but Curran recorded the most expensive figures by an England bowler in an ODI as he leaked an eye-watering 98 in 9.5 overs. Curran and Carse were unable to stop an onslaught from Windies captain Shai Hope and Romario Shepherd, who put on 89 in 51 balls to turn the tide after the hosts had slipped to 213 for five. Hope clattered three sixes in four balls off Curran to end proceedings, finishing on 109 not out, while Shepherd crunched seven boundaries in his 28-ball stay before being dismissed two shy of fifty. “There’s some young guys in that team who have not played loads and loads of one-day cricket, they’ll learn a lot from this,” Buttler said of a side that had five individuals with fewer than 10 ODI appearances. “A lot of stuff we did really, really well; not well enough to win the game in the end but guys will be better for the experience, learn plenty from that and come back for the next one. “I thought we played really well, I thought the two guys at the top set the tone really well. We were positive and aggressive and put the pressure on the West Indies at the start. “We just didn’t quite close it out. There’s no need to panic, we’ve done a lot of things really well, there’s guys who have gained experience from this and we look forward to the next one (on Wednesday).” The Windies are also at the outset of a new era, having failed to qualify for the World Cup, but it was Hope, a champion performer who reached 5,000 ODI runs in his knock, who was their star on Sunday. “This definitely gives us confidence for the rest of the series,” Hope said. “We’ve got to make sure the guys believe they can win in any situation. It’s great we can start this way.”","pubDate":"2023-12-03 22:53:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"bordercountiesadvertiser","source_priority":98087,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"f340b761dfb88db34d6ad8b83c41b95c","title":"UK cricket fans react to Mitch Johnson’s dig at David Warner","link":"https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/sport/british-cricket-fans-react-to-mitch-johnsons-furious-column-attacking-david-warners-likely-farewell-test-match/news-story/8d55c4320e2fb864dd6d811a4f3834cd","keywords":["Sport","Australia","cricket","David Warner","Mitchell Johnson","Outburst","rant","sport","Test Cricket"],"creator":[""],"video_url":null,"description":"British cricket fans have lapped up Mitchell Johnson’s furious outburst at David Warner in a newspaper column published over the weekend.","content":"The former Australian fast bowler penned his scathing attack on Warner’s likely farewell from Test cricket at the New Year’s Test at the SCG for The West Australian. In the column Johnson questioned why Warner deserved a “hero’s send-off” after his form in recent years. “As we prepare for David Warner’s farewell series, can somebody please tell me why?” Johnson wrote. “Why a struggling Test opener gets to nominate his own retirement date. “And why a player at the centre of one of the biggest scandals in Australian cricket history warrants a hero’s send-off?” Johnson continued his attack citing his former teammate’s role in the infamous ball tampering scandal in 2018 which saw him banned for 12 months. \"It's been five years and David Warner has still never really owned the ball-tampering scandal. \"He has a decent overall record and some say is one of our greatest opening bats. But his past three years in Test cricket have been ordinary, with a batting average closer to what a tailender would be happy with. \"Now the way he is going out is underpinned by more of the same arrogance and disrespect to our country.\" Warner has been a perennial enemy to England and the nation’s cricket fans were loving Johson’s furious outburst on social media. “Never thought highly of Mitchell Johnson until this moment!!!!” wrote one fan. “Wild I find myself agreeing with Johnson, first time EVER!” added another. A third commented: “Mitch I’ve finally found a reason to love you! Absolutely spot on… he’s a cheat and should be remembered as so.” “Well said should never have been allowed back in the Australian side nor Steve smith either,” wrote another. The comments came as Warner was named in the 14 man squad to play in the first Test match against Pakistan on December 14 in Perth where Johnson is likely to run into the players as he commentates for Triple M. Warner has previously stated he will hang up the baggy green after the New Year’s Test in Sydney and his selection in the first Test of the three match series against Pakistan all but guarantees he will get a farewell in front of his home fans. Johnson and Warner played alongside each other for several years including Australia’s 2013/14 Ashes whitewash and 2015 Word Cup victory. Johnson’s column also included an attack on chairman of selectors George Bailey – also a former teammate – for appearing to show favouritism to Warner. \"The handling of Warner in recent years, who played with Bailey in all three forms, raises the question of whether Bailey was simply too quickly out of playing and into the job and too close to some of the players,” Johnson wrote. Upon the announcement of the squad Bailey was asked about the column and he brushed it off insisting Warner was in the best 11 players in the country. “I’ve been sent little snippets of it – I hope he’s OK. I’ve got no idea (if he is),” Bailey said. Johnson played 73 Test matches for Australia taking 313 wickets and averaged 22.2 with the bat. Warner has played 109 Tests and scoring 8,487 runs at an average of 44.43 and currently is the seventh highest Test match run scorer for Australia and second highest opener just 138 runs behind Matthew Hayden.","pubDate":"2023-12-03 22:53:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"skynewsau","source_priority":13361,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
