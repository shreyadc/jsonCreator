The 32-year-old has been captain in waiting and was supposed to take over from Dimuth Karunaratne at the end of the last Test Championship cycle but was sidelined by the national selection panel, yet another strange decision of Pramodya Wickremesinghe’s selection committee. The appointment of DDS by the new selection panel brings to an end an excellent run by Dimuth Karunaratne, who skippered Sri Lanka in 30 Test matches. He won 12 Tests and lost 12 and the highlight of his captaincy was a stunning series win in South Africa. Thus, Sri Lanka became the first Asian nation to win a Test series in South Africa in 2019 and India and Pakistan with much better pace attacks and bigger budgets are still struggling to win a series in South Africa. Dimuth, an honest man had wanted to step down after Sri Lanka’s tour of New Zealand last year providing the new captain ample time to set up his priorities in the new cycle of the World Test Championship. However, he was irrationally persuaded to continue making DDS to wait further for his turn. Dimuth became the longest serving Sri Lankan captain since Arjuna Ranatunga having done the job for nearly five years. Arjuna was at the helm for ten years, eight of them at a stretch. Dhananjaya has been the understudy for Dimuth for three years and he is known as a reserved type. His calmness is extended beyond the batting crease to the dressing room as well, but now that he has become the captain, he has got to be firmer. It’s a bad idea to have a laid-back Head Coach, Manager and Captain. Now that he has been axed from the ODI side, DDS has all the time to concentrate on Test match cricket. Although he will start off his stint with the one-off game against Afghanistan, the bigger challenge will be later this year when he leads the team in England in a three match Test series. The door has not been completely shut on DDS in one-day cricket as selectors have indicated that he is not their man for the number six slot. He has been asked to bat top of the order in domestic cricket and in the ongoing one-day competition he bats at number three. DDS also changed clubs during this domestic season. While he represented Tamil Union in the First-Class tournament, he moved over to CCC for the one-day competition, and he’s expected to remain there for a while. Sri Lanka have ten Tests this year. Apart from the one-off game against Afghanistan and three match series in England, they will host New Zealand for two Tests and travel to Bangladesh and South Africa for two Tests each.","pubDate":"2024-01-05 00:01:40","image_url":"http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DI-P12-05-01-Ckg-7.jpg","source_id":"island","source_priority":608450,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"634d874ddb70a51c2d2de07f49e6e9c6","title":"Howzat!

Pakistan rejoice at the fall of David Warner at the SCG. Credit: Getty Images Since India stormed the Gabba to secure a memorable series win here in 2020-21, three other touring teams have come to Australia and been obliterated. Loading England were so poor in the 2021-22 Ashes summer that Stuart Broad talked about it as a void series, the West Indies were brushed aside in a couple of weeks in 2022, and South Africa only avoided a 0-3 sweep last year due to the Sydney rain that brought day two to an early finish. Against that backdrop, Pakistan have done rather better, summed up by how the canny off-spinner Salman Ali Agha has twice found a way past David Warner, this time landing a delivery of jump and turn to send the opener packing for 34 in his final Test match. But for some shoddy catching – Abdullah Shafique’s howlers in Melbourne were reprised at the SCG by the decision to place the debutant Saim Ayub at first slip, whereupon he shelled a simple chance offered by Warner on 20 – the Australians may well have reached the third Test needing a win to seal the series. There had been considerable chaos around the Pakistan set-up before the tour. Underperformance at the ODI World Cup in India had led to a raft of backroom changes, installing the quotable Mohammad Hafeez as coach and team director and even seeing the disgraced Salman Butt hired as a selection consultant before public outcry forced his removal.

At lunch on the first day of the third Test, Venues NSW chairman David Gallop delivered his maiden speech in the fancy-schmancy Sheridan Suite where the walls are made of mahogany and the beer comes in a frosted glass. A seasoned operator, Gallop is careful and deliberate with the words he speaks publicly and, with the traditional New Year’s Test under attack from rival states, he chose some pointed ones for those in attendance. “The New Year’s Test belongs in Sydney and it belongs at the SCG,” he said. “Just as the Boxing Day Test belongs in Melbourne and at the MCG.” Loading Cricket Australia chairman Mike Baird , chief executive Nick Hockley and a handful of board members were, significantly, in the room. According to those present, they chuckled and accepted the remark with good grace, but that can’t disguise the growing tension between CA and the NSW government over the future of the Test. Forget the annual gibber about rescheduling the match because of Sydney’s fickle weather in the first week of January. (Storms in summer? I’m stunned). Is the New Year’s Test on the move from the SCG? Credit: Getty No, the greater threat is CA leveraging interest from rival states — namely South Australia and Western Australia — to squeeze more money out of the NSW government to keep the Test in its current timeslot.

India crossed the finish line 12 overs after lunch on day two. Chasing 79, they scored 3-80. Only 642 legitimate deliveries were bowled across four-plus sessions. The previous shortest Test – 656 balls – was in 1932 in Melbourne between Australia and South Africa. Loading India’s first win at Newlands tied the two-match series 1-1. South Africa won at Centurion by an innings and 32 runs. “This win is a great feat for us,” captain Rohit Sharma said. “We had to learn from our mistakes in Centurion. We came back very well, especially our bowlers. We knew it was going to be a short game where every run mattered. We applied ourselves with the bat and got nearly a 100-run lead.” Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah’s 6-61 helped to negate Aiden Markram’s brilliant 106 to bowl out South Africa out for 176 runs in their second innings by lunch.

Khawaja, 37, even joked he would 'retire on the spot' if traditional red balls aren't used. 'The red ball is so distinct. I've played white ball, I've played pink ball, red ball, they all react so differently. Nothing reacts like that red ball,' the opening batsman told reporters post play on day two. 'The beauty of Test cricket, and what I love about Test cricket, is it really hasn't changed a lot in the last 100 years. It's still bat versus ball. 'The competition is still there. The wicket still deteriorates. The team most disciplined usually wins. It's a long grind. '[So] when it rains or when you have bad light, you just have to cop it.' Aussie cricket legend Glenn McGrath has endorsed calls for a pink ball to be used in Test matches during instances of bad light after fans were left feeling short changed at the SCG Current star Usman Khawaja wasn't on the same page, stating testing conditions are part of the game With Australia 2-116 in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 313, umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth felt it was too dark to continue and play was halted at 2.25pm local time It followed McGrath - who snared 563 Test wickets in his decorated career - declaring using pink balls in testing conditions 'wasn't a bad idea.' 'It's all about keeping the game going. We've got 25,000-plus people sitting in the crowd, it's not raining, fair enough it's a little overcast, but they want to see a game of cricket,' he said. 'Us in the commentary box, we want to see a game of cricket, and the players want to be playing half the time as well. 'I think whatever it takes to get the game going, keep the game moving forward and people watching.' With Australia 2-116 in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 313, umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth felt it was too dark to continue unless captain Shan Masood was willing to bowl spinners from either end. He wasn't, and play was halted at 2.25pm local time. A rain delay soon followed, which saw stumps called well before 6pm. Commentator Ian Smith felt the decision from both on-field umpires was 'lunacy' and questioned whether fans would return in droves on Friday. Aussie cricket great Michael Hussey was equally bemused - he conceded play shouldn't continue at 'all costs' - but questioned how dangerous the conditions actually were given lights were in use at the SCG. Both batsmen at the crease - Marnus Labuschagne (23 not out) and Steve Smith (six not out) - also had no intention of walking back to the pavilion.

A Bronx cheer rings out from the pink masses in the crowd as 33 dot balls is broken by a flat bat push down the ground by Labuschagne and a scrambled run that shows even the batter’s feet have fallen asleep. Now Smith really jolts the crowd awake, rasping a cover drive to the boundary. 9m ago 18.25 EST 52nd over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Smith buckles! That second ball from Hasan hit a crack on a length and jagged back to hit Smith’s belt line. He folded in half before rising with a wry smile. Hasan shows some gamesmanship, going down to caress the crack in the pitch he reckons did the deed. A fifth consecutive maiden! 12m ago 18.22 EST 52nd over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Five overs, five runs so far this morning. This evenly poised Test is into a slow, tense grind. Australia are defending stoically, Pakistan are attacking skilfully. Both sides are refusing to blink. That’s another maiden by Hamza to Labuschagne, the fourth in succession for Pakistan. 16m ago 18.18 EST 51st over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Tempting fate, Pakistan have taken a slip fielder out and placed him at short leg instead.

Labuschagne happy to leave this fifth/ sixth stump line for now, waiting for the one that wafts into his strike zone. Nothing doing though. Pakistan are picking up where they left off with probing accurate bowling on this dusty, slowly cracking SCG pitch. 24m ago 18.10 EST 49th over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Hasan Ali rolls in from the Randwick end to Smith who hippity-hops sideways across the crease to bat a skidding ball at 130kph back down the wicket. Five more stalemates ensue for a maiden. 30m ago 18.05 EST 48th over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Day three gets underway with Smith gliding Mir Hamza’s second ball for a single to short third man. Marnus Labuschagne raises the stakes, rolling his wrists on a straight ball and whipping it to the midwicket fence. Lovely shot by the Australian first drop. He looks a man on a mission today. 39m ago 17.55 EST G’day cricket lovers and welcome back to the Sydney Cricket Ground for the third day of the third Test between Australia and Pakistan. Angus Fontaine here to shepherd you through the opening session with Geoff Lemon to take you home to Stumps. The breaking story this morning is David Warner’s baggy greens have been found . That’s the good news. The bad news is we won’t see the veteran opener wearing his prized cap for a while yet because he was dismissed for 34 in the first innings of his farewell Test. The better news is that it’s a bright, rainless day in Sydney and we will see Australia resume at 116-2, trailing by 192 runs in their pursuit of Pakistan’s feisty first innings 313. This is the Pink Test and Day Three is Jane McGrath Day so this venerable old cricket ground is festooned in pink. Also in the pink are Pakistan, who again rocked Australia’s momentum by removing both Warner after an opening stand of 70 and, late in the day, his opening partner Usman Khawaja for 47. They did it with superb bowling. And, as has become their habit, almost undid it with abysmal fielding, Warner edging a few through slips and being dropped cold by debutant Saim Ayub when he was on 20. Cricket’s archaic laws, Sydney’s mercurial summer weather and weirdly low-wattage floodlights cost us a full day’s play, the covers coming out before tea for bad light and rain but we are all systems go for play today. The teams have been photographed in their baggy pink caps and donated them for auction as is tradition. And very soon Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne will stroll out to continue Australia’s innings and take this twisting thriller of a Test into what should be an intriguing Day Three. Spectators arrive dressed in pink on Jane McGrath Day, Day 3, of the Third Test between Australia and Pakistan.

The 32-year-old has been captain in waiting and was supposed to take over from Dimuth Karunaratne at the end of the last Test Championship cycle but was sidelined by the national selection panel, yet another strange decision of Pramodya Wickremesinghe’s selection committee. The appointment of DDS by the new selection panel brings to an end an excellent run by Dimuth Karunaratne, who skippered Sri Lanka in 30 Test matches. He won 12 Tests and lost 12 and the highlight of his captaincy was a stunning series win in South Africa. Thus, Sri Lanka became the first Asian nation to win a Test series in South Africa in 2019 and India and Pakistan with much better pace attacks and bigger budgets are still struggling to win a series in South Africa. Dimuth, an honest man had wanted to step down after Sri Lanka’s tour of New Zealand last year providing the new captain ample time to set up his priorities in the new cycle of the World Test Championship. However, he was irrationally persuaded to continue making DDS to wait further for his turn. Dimuth became the longest serving Sri Lankan captain since Arjuna Ranatunga having done the job for nearly five years. Arjuna was at the helm for ten years, eight of them at a stretch. Dhananjaya has been the understudy for Dimuth for three years and he is known as a reserved type. His calmness is extended beyond the batting crease to the dressing room as well, but now that he has become the captain, he has got to be firmer. It’s a bad idea to have a laid-back Head Coach, Manager and Captain. Now that he has been axed from the ODI side, DDS has all the time to concentrate on Test match cricket. Although he will start off his stint with the one-off game against Afghanistan, the bigger challenge will be later this year when he leads the team in England in a three match Test series. The door has not been completely shut on DDS in one-day cricket as selectors have indicated that he is not their man for the number six slot. He has been asked to bat top of the order in domestic cricket and in the ongoing one-day competition he bats at number three. DDS also changed clubs during this domestic season. While he represented Tamil Union in the First-Class tournament, he moved over to CCC for the one-day competition, and he’s expected to remain there for a while. Sri Lanka have ten Tests this year. Apart from the one-off game against Afghanistan and three match series in England, they will host New Zealand for two Tests and travel to Bangladesh and South Africa for two Tests each.","pubDate":"2024-01-05 00:01:40","image_url":"http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DI-P12-05-01-Ckg-7.jpg","source_id":"island","source_priority":608450,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"634d874ddb70a51c2d2de07f49e6e9c6","title":"Howzat!

If the contest between the teams of Pat Cummins and Shan Masood has not quite scaled the heights of that particular contest 62 years ago, Pakistan’s visit has brought far more riches than some expected. Pakistan rejoice at the fall of David Warner at the SCG. Credit: Getty Images Since India stormed the Gabba to secure a memorable series win here in 2020-21, three other touring teams have come to Australia and been obliterated. Loading England were so poor in the 2021-22 Ashes summer that Stuart Broad talked about it as a void series, the West Indies were brushed aside in a couple of weeks in 2022, and South Africa only avoided a 0-3 sweep last year due to the Sydney rain that brought day two to an early finish. Against that backdrop, Pakistan have done rather better, summed up by how the canny off-spinner Salman Ali Agha has twice found a way past David Warner, this time landing a delivery of jump and turn to send the opener packing for 34 in his final Test match. But for some shoddy catching – Abdullah Shafique’s howlers in Melbourne were reprised at the SCG by the decision to place the debutant Saim Ayub at first slip, whereupon he shelled a simple chance offered by Warner on 20 – the Australians may well have reached the third Test needing a win to seal the series. There had been considerable chaos around the Pakistan set-up before the tour. Underperformance at the ODI World Cup in India had led to a raft of backroom changes, installing the quotable Mohammad Hafeez as coach and team director and even seeing the disgraced Salman Butt hired as a selection consultant before public outcry forced his removal.

Fifth ball: Resumes back of a length well outside off stump and left alone again. Sixth ball: Dials into Labuschagne’s off stump, back of a length and defended back down the pitch.

At lunch on the first day of the third Test, Venues NSW chairman David Gallop delivered his maiden speech in the fancy-schmancy Sheridan Suite where the walls are made of mahogany and the beer comes in a frosted glass. A seasoned operator, Gallop is careful and deliberate with the words he speaks publicly and, with the traditional New Year’s Test under attack from rival states, he chose some pointed ones for those in attendance. “The New Year’s Test belongs in Sydney and it belongs at the SCG,” he said. “Just as the Boxing Day Test belongs in Melbourne and at the MCG.” Loading Cricket Australia chairman Mike Baird , chief executive Nick Hockley and a handful of board members were, significantly, in the room. According to those present, they chuckled and accepted the remark with good grace, but that can’t disguise the growing tension between CA and the NSW government over the future of the Test. Forget the annual gibber about rescheduling the match because of Sydney’s fickle weather in the first week of January. (Storms in summer? I’m stunned). Is the New Year’s Test on the move from the SCG? Credit: Getty No, the greater threat is CA leveraging interest from rival states — namely South Australia and Western Australia — to squeeze more money out of the NSW government to keep the Test in its current timeslot. Read Andrew Webster’s full column here . Cape Town: India has beaten South Africa by seven wickets in the shortest Test match in cricket history on Thursday. India crossed the finish line 12 overs after lunch on day two. Chasing 79, they scored 3-80. Only 642 legitimate deliveries were bowled across four-plus sessions. The previous shortest Test – 656 balls – was in 1932 in Melbourne between Australia and South Africa. Loading India’s first win at Newlands tied the two-match series 1-1. South Africa won at Centurion by an innings and 32 runs. “This win is a great feat for us,” captain Rohit Sharma said. “We had to learn from our mistakes in Centurion. We came back very well, especially our bowlers. We knew it was going to be a short game where every run mattered. We applied ourselves with the bat and got nearly a 100-run lead.” Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah’s 6-61 helped to negate Aiden Markram’s brilliant 106 to bowl out South Africa out for 176 runs in their second innings by lunch.

The outgoing Test opener revealed on the eve of his final match at the SCG that he had been unable to locate two baggy greens after travelling from Melbourne to Sydney. After days of detective work from Cricket Australia, Qantas and others close to Warner, one of the caps has been located. CA is expected to provide an update shortly on how Warner managed to find his prized possession. Loading “Hi everyone, I am pleased and relieved that I have got my baggy back in my hands,” Warner said in a video posted to Instagram on Friday morning before day three against Pakistan at the SCG. “Any cricketer knows how special their cap is and I will cherish this for the rest of my life. “Very grateful to all those involved in locating it – the Qantas team, the freight company, the hotel and our own team management. It’s a load off my shoulders going into the last couple of days, really appreciate it, so thank you all.” Read the full story here .","pubDate":"2024-01-04 23:50:21","image_url":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_321%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_jpg/efbcddd36fc18b73c3be29f125eb856c5c4ef9be","source_id":"smh","source_priority":6729,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"229f0bce673c45983fea82a45b063999","title":"सचिन ने किसे दिया जीत का श्रेय, भारत की विजय पर सहवाग का गजब पोस्ट","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/cricket/sachin-tendulkar-and-virender-sehwag-comments-on-india-historic-victory-over-south-africa-in-capetown-7956847.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"भारत के महान बल्लेबाज सचिन तेंदुलकर ने गुरुवार को केपटाउन में दक्षिण अफ्रीका के खिलाफ सीरीज बराबर करने वाली सात विकेट की जीत के लिए जसप्रीत बुमराह की धारदार गेंदबाजी को श्रेय दिया. उन्होंने कहा कि इस तेज गेंदबाज को लगातार सही लाइन एवं लेंथ में गेंदबाजी करने का फायदा मिला.","content":"भारतीय टीम ने रोहित शर्मा की कप्तानी में साउथ अफ्रीका के खिलाफ केपटाउन में रचा इतिहास-AP नई दिल्ली. रोहित शर्मा की कप्तानी वाली टेस्ट टीम ने साउथ अफ्रीका को उसके घर पर आखिरी मुकाबले में मात देकर दो मैचों की सीरीज 1-1 से बराबर की. भारत के महान बल्लेबाज सचिन तेंदुलकर ने गुरुवार को केपटाउन में दक्षिण अफ्रीका के खिलाफ सीरीज बराबर करने वाली सात विकेट की जीत के लिए जसप्रीत बुमराह की धारदार गेंदबाजी को श्रेय दिया. उन्होंने कहा कि इस तेज गेंदबाज को लगातार सही लाइन एवं लेंथ में गेंदबाजी करने का फायदा मिला. बुमराह ने 13.5 ओवर में 61 रन देकर छह विकेट झटके जिससे दक्षिण अफ्रीका की टीम दूसरी पारी में 176 रन पर सिमट गयी और भारत को जीत के लिए महज 79 रन का लक्ष्य मिला. भारत ने 12 ओवर में न्यूलैंड्स पर पहली जीत हासिल की। यह इस स्टेडियम में सात प्रयासों में उसकी पहली जीत है.

Khawaja, 37, even joked he would 'retire on the spot' if traditional red balls aren't used. 'The red ball is so distinct. I've played white ball, I've played pink ball, red ball, they all react so differently. Nothing reacts like that red ball,' the opening batsman told reporters post play on day two. 'The beauty of Test cricket, and what I love about Test cricket, is it really hasn't changed a lot in the last 100 years. It's still bat versus ball. 'The competition is still there. The wicket still deteriorates. The team most disciplined usually wins. It's a long grind. '[So] when it rains or when you have bad light, you just have to cop it.' Aussie cricket legend Glenn McGrath has endorsed calls for a pink ball to be used in Test matches during instances of bad light after fans were left feeling short changed at the SCG Current star Usman Khawaja wasn't on the same page, stating testing conditions are part of the game With Australia 2-116 in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 313, umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth felt it was too dark to continue and play was halted at 2.25pm local time It followed McGrath - who snared 563 Test wickets in his decorated career - declaring using pink balls in testing conditions 'wasn't a bad idea.' 'It's all about keeping the game going. We've got 25,000-plus people sitting in the crowd, it's not raining, fair enough it's a little overcast, but they want to see a game of cricket,' he said. 'Us in the commentary box, we want to see a game of cricket, and the players want to be playing half the time as well. 'I think whatever it takes to get the game going, keep the game moving forward and people watching.' With Australia 2-116 in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 313, umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth felt it was too dark to continue unless captain Shan Masood was willing to bowl spinners from either end. He wasn't, and play was halted at 2.25pm local time. A rain delay soon followed, which saw stumps called well before 6pm. Commentator Ian Smith felt the decision from both on-field umpires was 'lunacy' and questioned whether fans would return in droves on Friday. Aussie cricket great Michael Hussey was equally bemused - he conceded play shouldn't continue at 'all costs' - but questioned how dangerous the conditions actually were given lights were in use at the SCG. Both batsmen at the crease - Marnus Labuschagne (23 not out) and Steve Smith (six not out) - also had no intention of walking back to the pavilion.

He looks a man on a mission today. 39m ago 17.55 EST G’day cricket lovers and welcome back to the Sydney Cricket Ground for the third day of the third Test between Australia and Pakistan. Angus Fontaine here to shepherd you through the opening session with Geoff Lemon to take you home to Stumps. The breaking story this morning is David Warner’s baggy greens have been found . That’s the good news. The bad news is we won’t see the veteran opener wearing his prized cap for a while yet because he was dismissed for 34 in the first innings of his farewell Test. The better news is that it’s a bright, rainless day in Sydney and we will see Australia resume at 116-2, trailing by 192 runs in their pursuit of Pakistan’s feisty first innings 313. This is the Pink Test and Day Three is Jane McGrath Day so this venerable old cricket ground is festooned in pink. Also in the pink are Pakistan, who again rocked Australia’s momentum by removing both Warner after an opening stand of 70 and, late in the day, his opening partner Usman Khawaja for 47. They did it with superb bowling. And, as has become their habit, almost undid it with abysmal fielding, Warner edging a few through slips and being dropped cold by debutant Saim Ayub when he was on 20. Cricket’s archaic laws, Sydney’s mercurial summer weather and weirdly low-wattage floodlights cost us a full day’s play, the covers coming out before tea for bad light and rain but we are all systems go for play today. The teams have been photographed in their baggy pink caps and donated them for auction as is tradition. And very soon Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne will stroll out to continue Australia’s innings and take this twisting thriller of a Test into what should be an intriguing Day Three. Spectators arrive dressed in pink on Jane McGrath Day, Day 3, of the Third Test between Australia and Pakistan.

The 32-year-old has been captain in waiting and was supposed to take over from Dimuth Karunaratne at the end of the last Test Championship cycle but was sidelined by the national selection panel, yet another strange decision of Pramodya Wickremesinghe’s selection committee. The appointment of DDS by the new selection panel brings to an end an excellent run by Dimuth Karunaratne, who skippered Sri Lanka in 30 Test matches. He won 12 Tests and lost 12 and the highlight of his captaincy was a stunning series win in South Africa. Thus, Sri Lanka became the first Asian nation to win a Test series in South Africa in 2019 and India and Pakistan with much better pace attacks and bigger budgets are still struggling to win a series in South Africa. Dimuth, an honest man had wanted to step down after Sri Lanka’s tour of New Zealand last year providing the new captain ample time to set up his priorities in the new cycle of the World Test Championship. However, he was irrationally persuaded to continue making DDS to wait further for his turn. Dimuth became the longest serving Sri Lankan captain since Arjuna Ranatunga having done the job for nearly five years. Arjuna was at the helm for ten years, eight of them at a stretch. Dhananjaya has been the understudy for Dimuth for three years and he is known as a reserved type. His calmness is extended beyond the batting crease to the dressing room as well, but now that he has become the captain, he has got to be firmer. It’s a bad idea to have a laid-back Head Coach, Manager and Captain. Now that he has been axed from the ODI side, DDS has all the time to concentrate on Test match cricket. Although he will start off his stint with the one-off game against Afghanistan, the bigger challenge will be later this year when he leads the team in England in a three match Test series. The door has not been completely shut on DDS in one-day cricket as selectors have indicated that he is not their man for the number six slot. He has been asked to bat top of the order in domestic cricket and in the ongoing one-day competition he bats at number three. DDS also changed clubs during this domestic season. While he represented Tamil Union in the First-Class tournament, he moved over to CCC for the one-day competition, and he’s expected to remain there for a while. Sri Lanka have ten Tests this year. Apart from the one-off game against Afghanistan and three match series in England, they will host New Zealand for two Tests and travel to Bangladesh and South Africa for two Tests each.","pubDate":"2024-01-05 00:01:40","image_url":"http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DI-P12-05-01-Ckg-7.jpg","source_id":"island","source_priority":608450,"country":["sri lanka"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"634d874ddb70a51c2d2de07f49e6e9c6","title":"Howzat!

Pakistan rejoice at the fall of David Warner at the SCG. Credit: Getty Images Since India stormed the Gabba to secure a memorable series win here in 2020-21, three other touring teams have come to Australia and been obliterated. Loading England were so poor in the 2021-22 Ashes summer that Stuart Broad talked about it as a void series, the West Indies were brushed aside in a couple of weeks in 2022, and South Africa only avoided a 0-3 sweep last year due to the Sydney rain that brought day two to an early finish. Against that backdrop, Pakistan have done rather better, summed up by how the canny off-spinner Salman Ali Agha has twice found a way past David Warner, this time landing a delivery of jump and turn to send the opener packing for 34 in his final Test match. But for some shoddy catching – Abdullah Shafique’s howlers in Melbourne were reprised at the SCG by the decision to place the debutant Saim Ayub at first slip, whereupon he shelled a simple chance offered by Warner on 20 – the Australians may well have reached the third Test needing a win to seal the series. There had been considerable chaos around the Pakistan set-up before the tour. Underperformance at the ODI World Cup in India had led to a raft of backroom changes, installing the quotable Mohammad Hafeez as coach and team director and even seeing the disgraced Salman Butt hired as a selection consultant before public outcry forced his removal.

At lunch on the first day of the third Test, Venues NSW chairman David Gallop delivered his maiden speech in the fancy-schmancy Sheridan Suite where the walls are made of mahogany and the beer comes in a frosted glass. A seasoned operator, Gallop is careful and deliberate with the words he speaks publicly and, with the traditional New Year’s Test under attack from rival states, he chose some pointed ones for those in attendance. “The New Year’s Test belongs in Sydney and it belongs at the SCG,” he said. “Just as the Boxing Day Test belongs in Melbourne and at the MCG.” Loading Cricket Australia chairman Mike Baird , chief executive Nick Hockley and a handful of board members were, significantly, in the room. According to those present, they chuckled and accepted the remark with good grace, but that can’t disguise the growing tension between CA and the NSW government over the future of the Test. Forget the annual gibber about rescheduling the match because of Sydney’s fickle weather in the first week of January. (Storms in summer? I’m stunned). Is the New Year’s Test on the move from the SCG? Credit: Getty No, the greater threat is CA leveraging interest from rival states — namely South Australia and Western Australia — to squeeze more money out of the NSW government to keep the Test in its current timeslot.

India crossed the finish line 12 overs after lunch on day two. Chasing 79, they scored 3-80. Only 642 legitimate deliveries were bowled across four-plus sessions. The previous shortest Test – 656 balls – was in 1932 in Melbourne between Australia and South Africa. Loading India’s first win at Newlands tied the two-match series 1-1. South Africa won at Centurion by an innings and 32 runs. “This win is a great feat for us,” captain Rohit Sharma said. “We had to learn from our mistakes in Centurion. We came back very well, especially our bowlers. We knew it was going to be a short game where every run mattered. We applied ourselves with the bat and got nearly a 100-run lead.” Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah’s 6-61 helped to negate Aiden Markram’s brilliant 106 to bowl out South Africa out for 176 runs in their second innings by lunch.

Khawaja, 37, even joked he would 'retire on the spot' if traditional red balls aren't used. 'The red ball is so distinct. I've played white ball, I've played pink ball, red ball, they all react so differently. Nothing reacts like that red ball,' the opening batsman told reporters post play on day two. 'The beauty of Test cricket, and what I love about Test cricket, is it really hasn't changed a lot in the last 100 years. It's still bat versus ball. 'The competition is still there. The wicket still deteriorates. The team most disciplined usually wins. It's a long grind. '[So] when it rains or when you have bad light, you just have to cop it.' Aussie cricket legend Glenn McGrath has endorsed calls for a pink ball to be used in Test matches during instances of bad light after fans were left feeling short changed at the SCG Current star Usman Khawaja wasn't on the same page, stating testing conditions are part of the game With Australia 2-116 in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 313, umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth felt it was too dark to continue and play was halted at 2.25pm local time It followed McGrath - who snared 563 Test wickets in his decorated career - declaring using pink balls in testing conditions 'wasn't a bad idea.' 'It's all about keeping the game going. We've got 25,000-plus people sitting in the crowd, it's not raining, fair enough it's a little overcast, but they want to see a game of cricket,' he said. 'Us in the commentary box, we want to see a game of cricket, and the players want to be playing half the time as well. 'I think whatever it takes to get the game going, keep the game moving forward and people watching.' With Australia 2-116 in reply to Pakistan's first innings total of 313, umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth felt it was too dark to continue unless captain Shan Masood was willing to bowl spinners from either end. He wasn't, and play was halted at 2.25pm local time. A rain delay soon followed, which saw stumps called well before 6pm. Commentator Ian Smith felt the decision from both on-field umpires was 'lunacy' and questioned whether fans would return in droves on Friday. Aussie cricket great Michael Hussey was equally bemused - he conceded play shouldn't continue at 'all costs' - but questioned how dangerous the conditions actually were given lights were in use at the SCG. Both batsmen at the crease - Marnus Labuschagne (23 not out) and Steve Smith (six not out) - also had no intention of walking back to the pavilion.

A Bronx cheer rings out from the pink masses in the crowd as 33 dot balls is broken by a flat bat push down the ground by Labuschagne and a scrambled run that shows even the batter’s feet have fallen asleep. Now Smith really jolts the crowd awake, rasping a cover drive to the boundary. 9m ago 18.25 EST 52nd over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Smith buckles! That second ball from Hasan hit a crack on a length and jagged back to hit Smith’s belt line. He folded in half before rising with a wry smile. Hasan shows some gamesmanship, going down to caress the crack in the pitch he reckons did the deed. A fifth consecutive maiden! 12m ago 18.22 EST 52nd over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Five overs, five runs so far this morning. This evenly poised Test is into a slow, tense grind. Australia are defending stoically, Pakistan are attacking skilfully. Both sides are refusing to blink. That’s another maiden by Hamza to Labuschagne, the fourth in succession for Pakistan. 16m ago 18.18 EST 51st over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Tempting fate, Pakistan have taken a slip fielder out and placed him at short leg instead. The cordon opens up to reveal the gaps David Warner found so fortuitously yesterday. Smith happy to play out another maiden. 21m ago 18.13 EST 50th over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Hamza enters his 12th over, just 16 runs from them. Labuschagne happy to leave this fifth/ sixth stump line for now, waiting for the one that wafts into his strike zone. Nothing doing though. Pakistan are picking up where they left off with probing accurate bowling on this dusty, slowly cracking SCG pitch. 24m ago 18.10 EST 49th over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Hasan Ali rolls in from the Randwick end to Smith who hippity-hops sideways across the crease to bat a skidding ball at 130kph back down the wicket. Five more stalemates ensue for a maiden. 30m ago 18.05 EST 48th over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 7) Day three gets underway with Smith gliding Mir Hamza’s second ball for a single to short third man. Marnus Labuschagne raises the stakes, rolling his wrists on a straight ball and whipping it to the midwicket fence. Lovely shot by the Australian first drop. He looks a man on a mission today. 39m ago 17.55 EST G’day cricket lovers and welcome back to the Sydney Cricket Ground for the third day of the third Test between Australia and Pakistan. Angus Fontaine here to shepherd you through the opening session with Geoff Lemon to take you home to Stumps. The breaking story this morning is David Warner’s baggy greens have been found . That’s the good news. The bad news is we won’t see the veteran opener wearing his prized cap for a while yet because he was dismissed for 34 in the first innings of his farewell Test. The better news is that it’s a bright, rainless day in Sydney and we will see Australia resume at 116-2, trailing by 192 runs in their pursuit of Pakistan’s feisty first innings 313. This is the Pink Test and Day Three is Jane McGrath Day so this venerable old cricket ground is festooned in pink. Also in the pink are Pakistan, who again rocked Australia’s momentum by removing both Warner after an opening stand of 70 and, late in the day, his opening partner Usman Khawaja for 47. They did it with superb bowling. And, as has become their habit, almost undid it with abysmal fielding, Warner edging a few through slips and being dropped cold by debutant Saim Ayub when he was on 20. Cricket’s archaic laws, Sydney’s mercurial summer weather and weirdly low-wattage floodlights cost us a full day’s play, the covers coming out before tea for bad light and rain but we are all systems go for play today. The teams have been photographed in their baggy pink caps and donated them for auction as is tradition. And very soon Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne will stroll out to continue Australia’s innings and take this twisting thriller of a Test into what should be an intriguing Day Three. Spectators arrive dressed in pink on Jane McGrath Day, Day 3, of the Third Test between Australia and Pakistan.
