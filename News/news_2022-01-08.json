Should I book my flight to Hobart now?” Does anyone else have experience of these cricket bars? I’d expect to find it tremendously triggering. Morning/evening @sjjperry . Trying to work out how sensible it is to stay up in Manchester for the first hour. If someone can guarantee we're 320-7 at lunch with Bairstow a storming 152* then I'm all in. But.... Oh we've been here so many times before. I’d be staying up while Bairstow is there, big time. I don’t know how “big time” amplifies it in any way, and yet, there it is. Just checked the scoreboard after reading up on yesterday's play and it appears England do not lead by 158 runs as I was led to believe, but trail by 158 runs. I'm all for trying to move the needle, but we're still pretty dismal aren't we @sjjperry ? England’s best day yesterday. They are still a long way behind. England injury update Mega injury update from England on Bairstow, Buttler and Stokes. Scan city. Ollie Pope to keep today as expected. pic.twitter.com/w9MnSm0kqE More pics of the SCG, all in readiness... Covers off, sun's out and we're on air with all the build up to Day 4 at the SCG. First ball at 10am 🙌 #Ashes pic.twitter.com/U5EIST9UPq Want more Bairstow and Stokes gear? Top piece from Andy Bull here Hell of a knock from Jonny Bairstow yesterday. Stokes deserves great praise too. For for Bairstow to arrive at 4/36 and finish the day 103*, enduring that brutal blow to his thumb, while the team scored at 4.5 an over, was mesmeric stuff. How much further can he push it this innings? just having a nice friday night when I think of Jos telling Jonny that his Dad ‘would be so proud of him’ at the CWC final and now I’m crying on a friday night!!! Here’s a visual Pissing it down in Sydney pic.twitter.com/dg9Da8u55S Weather: play this morning, not looking great this afternoon I’ve given you the view from on the ground, here’s what the Bureau of Meteorology says: Sydney area Partly cloudy. Very high (90%) chance of showers, most likely during this afternoon and evening. The chance of a thunderstorm, possibly severe. Heavy falls possible in the west. Winds northerly 15 to 20 km/h tending northeasterly in the early afternoon then becoming light in the evening. The forecast is so untrustworthy that on SEN Radio here, Whateley, Katich and Atherton are conducting their own conversation about the forecast. Yesterday was meant to be ordinary, and they got a full day in. Hope that helps! My first on the ground report concerning all matters Sydney weather Big storm in Sydney overnight but it’s quite nice at the moment. Could be showers later. Hello and welcome! Trust everyone’s fresh from yesterday’s restorative day’s play. For many contemplating a Friday evening in front of the cricket, no doubt Jonny Bairstow’s hundred and Stokes’ half century warmed the heart. It was swashbuckling, it was gutsy, and as we’ve since learned, not without a bit of crowd boorishness to boot. So, all round, stirring stuff. It leaves England with half a glimmer in this match, but only that. Quite simply, Australia will want to knock them over and get to work setting up a target today, while England will be trying to take it as deep as is possible with the bat. I expect we’ll see Bairstow farming the strike, which will be quickly followed by conversations about bowling and fielding tactics in these situations. My early understanding is that there were overnight storms, but the weather is looking okay to start on time. I write it tentatively. I’m going to comb around now for some more detail on that, but in the meantime if you’re keen to catch up on yesterday’s action, here’s Ali Martin’s report from the SCG . I’m around on Twitter and email while bringing you the first half of the day’s play.

Selectors will name bigger than anticipated Ashes and Australia A squads to ensure there is enough depth in the playing pool to cover the seven-match multi-format series in the event of players testing positive to Covid as the virus’s highly contagious omicron variant sweeps around the country. Catch every moment of The Ashes live and ad-break free during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Try 14-days free now > National selector and head of performance for women’s cricket, Shawn Flegler said officials were finalising strict protocols to protect both the Australian and England teams, who are desperate to remain free of the virus to ensure they can take part in the Ashes and ICC World Cup, which follows, in New Zealand. Both teams are scheduled to head across the ditch to start a 10-day quarantine process in New Zealand the day after the Ashes series is complete. But any player testing positive to the virus in the final stages of the Ashes is likely to be ruled out of the 50-over tournament. “The way that we’re looking at it is we have to be prepared that there’ll be players who will miss games (due to Covid),” Flegler said. “The strength that we do have is we’ve got a number of player who could come in and take the place of someone who does have Covid. “So we’re in a fortunate position. Hopefully it doesn’t happen, but I think that’s what we’re planning for just in case. “What we’ve seen over the last few weeks with the Big Bash has shown that you can’t expect that you’re going to go through a full series without some sort of issue. “So whether it’s an injury or whether it’s Covid, we’ll just have to adjust pretty much every day.” The rapid spread of the disease around the country and the path it has cut through sport despite protocols, hubs and bubbles has meant players will face strict conditions throughout the Ashes. The series has been brought forward a week to start on January 20 with three T20 matches in Adelaide and squads will be transported on charter flights between formats (the Adelaide T20s, Canberra Test and opening ODI and final ODIs in Melbourne). Dining in restaurants will be banned and indoor contact and training will be minimised as much as possible. But risks remain. “We need to be careful that we if someone does get Covid, it doesn’t take out the whole series,” Flegler said. “It really is a day-to-day proposition. We just need to be really careful about protocols and the players and staff are aware of some of the issues that might pop up.” The Australian players are not the only ones at risk, with England’s squad only needing to cast an eye towards the men’s Ashes group to see the havoc that Covid can cause. “We need to keep in mind England as well, their focus is on the Ashes but also defending their World Cup title,” Flegler said. “So they’re very keen to make sure that all the players are available, and we’ll be doing the same. “So if we do have to tighten things down towards the back end of the series, we’ll look to do that. “But again, we’re trying to balance that with making sure that players and staff can try and live some sort of normality. “It’s not normal, let’s be honest. But we want to try and make it as comfortable as possible and make sure they’re getting into a position where they can perform on the field but they’re still happy and enjoying what’s not a normal touring life. “It’s not how we used to tour. Things are very different now but we’ll just try and do the best we can.” Australian captain Meg Lanning say her team feels privileged to still be able to play the Ashes series against England as Covid rips through international sport. Cricket Australia (CA) has confirmed the women’s Ashes will be brought forward a week to ensure Australia and England have enough time to complete a mandatory quarantine period in New Zealand ahead of the Women’s World Cup in March. The multi-format series will begin a week earlier than planned, with the first of three T20 internationals held at Adelaide Oval on January 20. All three T20s will now be held in Adelaide, ahead of the Test match on January 27-30 at Canberra’s Manuka Oval. Canberra will also host the first one-day international on February 3, with the final two ODIs at Melbourne’s Junction Oval on February 6 and 8 to round out the clash between the world’s top two women’s teams. Lanning backed the shift and said the Aussies would be ready. “I think it’s a good move in the end, it’s great that we’ve still got all three formats involved in the Ashes, which sounds like it might have been a bit tricky to get in,” Lanning said. “With the isolation period in New Zealand heading into that World Cup, both us and England wanted to have the best chance of preparing and by moving (the Ashes) forward a little bit and making a few changes, that allowed that. “There’s lots of work going on behind the scenes but it’s great that all three formats are still being played.” CA can also confirm the schedule for the Australia v England A series which will feature three T20s and three 50-over fixtures running concurrently with the Ashes. The annual Governor-General’s XI match will not proceed as planned, with the tour match expected to return next season.

LIVE: Australia vs England, day three of fourth Test ‘BLOWN AWAY’: Shane Warne opens up on startling $276,000 bribe ‘I SAID IT EIGHT MONTHS AGO’: Broad drops ‘brutal’ Poms truth bomb While Australia was shocked by England at the 2005 Ashes in the UK, losing 2-1, the series was Warne’s finest hour in Test cricket as he took a whopping 40 wickets at 19.92 in a losing cause. Making Warne’s performance all the more remarkable was the weight of a broken marriage, and separation from his children, soon before the series following revelations of multiple extra-marital affairs. Warne and wife Simone divorced in 2005, with the latter returning to Australia from the UK with their three young children Brooke, Jackson and Summer. The greatest leg-spinner of all-time became the subject of cruel, personal Barmy Army chants all 2005 Ashes as his name was dragged through the mud by the British tabloids. One song went: “Where‘s your missus gone? Far, far away.” In the documentary, Warne said that outside of playing Test matches, he became reclusive on the tour and desperately missed his children. Australia reclaim dominace on Day 2 | 01:24 “I think that was the lowest because it had nothing to do with anything else... the impact it had on my children, I couldn't get to see my children and they couldn’t get to see me and it was my fault,” Warne said in the documentary. “To try and live with that at that time and to go out and play for your country in an Ashes series was sh*t. It was bloody hard. “Playing in one of the greatest Ashes series of all time, talking to my kids, saying, ‘I miss you, daddy. I wish I was with you. Good luck at the cricket’. Then you just put the phone down and grab a vodka or whatever out of the fridge.” Warne’s eldest child, Brooke, says in the documentary that Warne’s affairs being reported in the British media before the series was the first time that she had seen her father “in a bad light”. Speaking to foxsports.com.au this week, Warne opened up on the experience of reliving the painful memories from his career. Asked what the hardest aspect of the filming process was, he said it was “anything where I hurt my children”. “That‘s the hardest thing to talk about because I have to live with that everyday,” Warne said. “That’s never easy to do.” Shane Warne speaking to reporters in 2005. Source: Getty Images He added: “To rehash a lot of that stuff that was nearly 30 years ago, 20 years ago, wasn't easy to talk about. “It's never easy to talk about, but I do. I’ve been honest my whole life. I give a pretty honest and brutal account over what happened over the years, too.” Warne retired after the 2006-07 Ashes series, saying he wanted to be more involved in his children's lives and no longer be a “part-time father”. The 52-year-old said he felt that — 15 years after his retirement, and now that his children are all adults — the time was right to be involved in the making on a documentary on his life. “All my children have finished school, they're old enough, we’ve been through it together and chatted about lots of different stuff,” Warne told foxsports.com.au . “They want to know a little bit more about my life and my journey because when I first started they weren’t born. My first daughter was born in ‘97 and I had already been playing for seven or eight seasons and already achieved some amazing things. “I wish my children were this age now when I started so they could see and we could do it together.” SHANE will screen for a limited time in Australian cinemas nationally from January 6th, 2022, before it is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video from January 25th, 2022.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"“If they have to get me out, they’ll have to break something in my body”: Dean Elgar’s father recounts son’s words the night before South Africa defeated India in Johannesburg Test","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-if-they-have-to-get-me-out-theyll-have-to-break-something-in-my-body-dean-elgars-father-recounts-sons-words-the-night-before-south-africa-defeated-india-in-johannesburg-test/","keywords":["Cricket","Dean Elgar","India tour of South Africa 2021-22"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Dean Elgar’s father recounts his son’s remarks the night before South Africa handed India their maiden loss in Johannesburg in Tests.

Team India were on Thursday, handed their first ever Test match defeat at The Wanderers, Johannesburg by 7 wickets in what was a grueling fight between the two sides almost the entirety of the 2nd Test, barring Day 4. While the match was no less than a see-saw battle, the hosts’ dominance with the bat during the last session of Day 3 and the final session of Day 4 made sure the result titled and rested in their favour. The architect-in-chief for the Proteas was their opening batter cum skipper Dean Elgar, who played a stellar knock of 96* (188), while taking numerous blows on his body to guide his team home with a winning boundary. After the end of Day 3, the hosts needed another 122 runs with 8 wickets in the bank against a strong Indian bowling line-up, and on a pitch that had quite some invariable bounce coupled with enough seam movement off the deck. Well played, South Africa. Well played, Dean Elgar. There are few things more fascinating and pleasing in Test cricket than the fourth innings run-chases. Special Test for SA. — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) January 6, 2022 Dean Elgar’s father recounts his son’s remarks on the night of Day 3 With 240 required for victory, Dean Elgar played the final session of Day 3 with absolute grit and determination, while taking some handy blows from India’s pace trio of Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, and Shardul Thakur. While Bumrah hit him on his helmet’s grill in the 31st Over, Thakur smashed his gloves to a delivery which rose off a good length during the 37th Over. In the very next Over, Mohammed Shami smacked him right on his shoulder to hand him another body blow. The Southpaw took it all, to hand his team an advantage going into the 4th Day’s play. Dean Elgar’s father Richard Elgar recounted his son’s words on the night of Day 3, which he shared with The Indian Express. “When we spoke briefly on Wednesday night, Dean told me, ‘Dad! I will be there till the end of the game tomorrow. If they want to get me out, they would have to break something in my body to drag me out of there. They are not going to get me by hitting me on the body. No way in hell.’ When I heard him say that, I knew he was charged up and felt he would do it”, remarked Richard Elgar. “In the morning, when the target dipped under 100, I said to my wife, ‘you know what, they are not going to get him out today.’ I could see that he was in the zone – so focused, so intense in his bubble, that he didn’t even know what was going on around him. I could see it. She said ‘but 100 runs are there’, and I went, ‘doesn’t matter. Dean and others are going to do it'”, Richard further added. It took Dean Elgar’s men mere 27.4 Overs to notch-up their first win in six Tests against India. Their chase of 240 was also the 3rd highest successful 4th innings chase by any team against India in Test match history.         The post “If they have to get me out, they’ll have to break something in my body”: Dean Elgar’s father recounts son’s words the night before South Africa defeated India in Johannesburg Test appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-07 18:27:35","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Ashes, 4th Test, Day 4, Australia vs England Live Cricket Updates","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ashes-4th-test-day-4-australia-vs-england-live-cricket-updates-2695717","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ashes, 4th Test, Day 4, Australia vs England Live Cricket Updates: England will look to chip away at Australia's lead when they resume batting at the Sydney Cricket Ground on the fourth day of the...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-07 17:55:19","full_description":"Ashes, 4th Test, Day 4, Australia vs England Live Cricket Updates: England will look to chip away at Australia's lead when they resume batting at the Sydney Cricket Ground on the fourth day of the fourth Ashes Test on Saturday. Earlier on Friday, Jonny Bairstow broke through for his first Test hundred in Australia and wincing Ben Stokes reeled off a counter-punching half-century to help England recover from another collapse. At the close England were 258 for seven, with Bairstow unbeaten on 103 with eight fours and three sixes, and Jack Leach not-out four to trail Australia by 158 runs. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) What does Day 4 bring us then? Excitement and anticipation. If Bairstow bats through the morning session, well, Australia will suddenly be on the back foot, because it then becomes a one-inning shootout. On the other hand, it is a new day and if Australia can finish things off in the first hour, they will still have a sizeable lead. One thing to remember is - this is Sydney. Which means, post Day 3, batting gets really difficult. So the cracks will definitely open up and that means Lyon could get purchase in the final innings. The first ball of the day is scheduled to be bowled at 4.30 am IST (2300 GMT, previous day), weather permitting, but the buildup will be done well in advance. So please, please, please - tune in early. ADIOS! TAKE CARE! A nightmarish second half of the day for Australia? Ummm... perhaps. They did get rattled. They are still well ahead in this Test but the way England fought back from 36/4 is something which they did not expect. However, their main worry would be Scott Boland's injury. If they have to bowl with a bowler down in the second innings, it is going to be a problem as we witnessed on Day 3 too. The most surprising aspect was the way the English batsmen targetted Nathan Lyon - 12-0-71-1 - whoa! He did get Stokes but boy, he got a pounding from Stokes, Bairstow and even Wood! A word now, on Jonny Bairstow. And also, a question to England's selectors, as to why was this bloke left out from the first two Tests? This is what he brings to the table. It is not just the runs but the way he gets them. And when you fight fire with fire, that is when you get entertainment. We all remember Ben Stokes' century in the 2014 Ashes. This was close to that, if not better. He first saw Stokes changing his batting style after that bowled reprieve and then he too, inducted some of that in him. And the result is - at the end of the day he is still fighting, on a 103 not out, from just 140 balls, with 8 fours and 3 sixes. Australia bounced back, with two quick wickets, but then, they got a taste of their own medicine. Just like their tail has been wagging against England, this time it was the opposition to do so. Mark Wood hung around and boy, he did not just stand there. He decided to counter punch and that 72-run stand for the 7th wicket is what frustrated Australia. Bairstow got confidence in his partner and then reached his century as well, making it a day to remember for not just English fans, but for all cricket fans, in general. A day of two halves, shall we say? Australia started as they always have in this series, putting the foot right on England's throat. Bang, bang, bang, bang - suddenly, England are 36/4 at Lunch. And again, memories of 68 all out start flooding. But then, something happens. Ben Stokes gets a slice of luck, being adjudged LBW, when he was actually bowled but the bails did not fall! The overturned decision saw the game change tremendously, with Bairstow and Stokes going on an all-out attack, reminding us of their partnership in the 2019 Ashes in Headingley. They added 128 for the 5th wicket, which pushed the Aussies on the back foot. Before we delve into what happened in the day, here's Smith junior talking to the broadcasters. Jeez - Marnus Labuschagne. His pet name, you see. On England's fightback, Labuschagne says that they always knew that this was a good wicket and even though they took 4 quick wickets, they expected a fightback. Tells that this is the Ashes, which is always competitive. On Scott Boland, he does agree that seeing him in whites is a good sign but is not quite sure whether he would be able to bowl on Saturday as they need to assess him overnight. Ahhh... what a glorious scene. The first thing that happens after that last ball is Aussie players coming across to congratulate Bairstow on his century. And it is not just one or two players. Almost the entire team gets across, which shows what a splendid innings this has been from him, in trying circumstances. And now, Australia themselves get into a huddle, probably telling themselves that okay, we have let an opportunity slip, but the match has not ended yet. However, what a day it has been. On a length, outside off, angling away, Bairstow feels for it but misses. Oohs and aahs from the crowd but Bairstow survives the day! STUMPS ON DAY 3, ENGLAND TRAIL BY 158 RUNS! Outside off, on a length, JB lets it pass. FOUR! HUNDRED FOR BAIRSTOW! What a moment for him and England in Sydney! Take a bow, lad. Finally, a century for England in this series. A short ball, outside off, similar to the previous one, Bairstow gets across and slashes at it again. This is over point and races to the fence behind! Bairstow takes his helmet off and runs down the pitch in celebration. The entire SCG stands up in applause. Not only English fans, but even the Aussies have loved this knock. Superb to watch. Cummins goes wider and lands it well outside off, short in length. JB gets across and slashes hard but is beaten again. This is a fascinating end to Day 3. A metre either side and it would have been a century! Very full, outside off, Bairstow squeezes it, but straight to point! 4 balls left for the day... Oohh... the plan nearly worked! A length ball, around off, angling away, Jonny Bairstow just looked to slash at that, without moving his feet. Almost nicked it behind! Missed it. 'JONNY, JONNY!' The Barmy Army is in full flow here. Jonny boy is on 99. Patrick Cummins is busy setting the field, trying to delay Bairstow's reach to a century. All set then. Here is Pat around the wicket. Quicker and flatter, around middle, well blocked out by JL. Landed outside off, Jack lunges again and block-pushes it towards the off side. Quicker, outside off, Leach lunges and pushes it towards point. Fuller, around middle, Jack Leach works it with the angle to short mid-wicket. 99 now! Half tracker, around middle, Bairstow rocks back and drags his pull to deep mid-wicket for a single. Onto 98! Short, outside off, Jonny Bairstow went back and cut it behind point for a couple.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/65k1089g_england-afp_625x300_07_January_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"\"Sometimes People Overstep The Mark\": Bairstow On Abusive Fans' Eviction","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sometimes-people-overstep-the-mark-jonny-bairstow-on-3-abusive-fans-being-evicted-2695672","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England batter Jonny Bairstow said it would have been nice if the supporters who abused him were still there after the stumps at Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-07 17:36:28","full_description":"England batter Jonny Bairstow said it would have been nice if the supporters who abused him were still there after the stumps at Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. Three men were ejected from the stadium with no charges laid after the English pair of Ben Stokes and Bairstow were subjected to verbal barbs during the day three's tea break of the ongoing 4th Ashes Test against Australia. In the footage obtained by The Age and the Herald from a witness show the pair being ridiculed for their body shape by at least one fan as they headed up the steps to the dressing room in the Members Pavilion. \"Stokes, you're fat,\" a fan said. \"Take your jumper off, Bairstow, lose some weight Bairstow,\" the England batter was told. Bairstow fired back with \"Pal, that's right just turn around and walk away,\" before three people were ejected from SCG. On day three, Bairstow brought up England's first century of the series, though will have work to do tomorrow, batting with the tail to close the 158-run first-innings deficit. Ben Stokes scored 66 as the tourists will resume on 258/7 on day four. Asked about his earlier exchange of verbals with a spectator, Bairstow after the day's play replied: \"It was a bit of bad-mouthing. It's not needed. We're out there trying to do our jobs, people are there enjoying the cricket. Unfortunately, sometimes people overstep the mark.\" Promoted \"I think it is important to stand up for ourselves because if we are not standing up for ourselves, you can cop it. When people overstep the mark, they need to be told. It'd have been nicer if we were there giving it when we walked off at the end, wouldn't it? Unfortunately, they weren't there at the end, they missed the end of a fantastic day of Test cricket,\" he added. Notably, this incident comes one year after when India pacer Mohammed Siraj reported racial abuse at SCG. Six spectators were then removed from the ground on that occasion.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/qar7c4e_jonny-bairstow-afp_625x300_07_January_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv"},{"title":"“You earn the right to fail when you’re so good at what you do”: David Warner backs Virat Kohli despite criticisms around his poor form in International Cricket","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-you-earn-the-right-to-fail-when-youre-so-good-at-what-you-do-david-warner-backs-virat-kohli-despite-criticisms-around-his-poor-form-in-international-cricket/","keywords":["Cricket","David Warner","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"David Warner backs Virat Kohli despite talks around latter’s poor run of form off-late in International Cricket.

That Indian team’s white-ball skipper Virat Kohli has been through a lean patch of form since the past couple of years is no novel news for the followers of the game. The 33-year-old did not scored a single century in the 19 innings he played last year in the Test format. In fact his last century in the format came in November 2019 against Bangladesh during the Pink-ball Test match at Kolkata. His last ODI hundred too came in August 2019 against West Indies at The Port of Spain. He has struck 7 half-centuries in the 15 innings he had played since then, but the world expects more from the man who has smashed a total of 70 centuries across all formats. Such is the yardstick! However, the Australian opening batter David Warner, who perhaps knows a thing or two about what it feels to be in the state in which Virat finds himself in currently, backs Kohli during a recent interaction. David Warner backs Virat Kohli Interacting with renowned journalist Boria Majumdar during one of the episodes of ‘Backstage with Boria’, the Southpaw batter was all candid regarding a number of issues ranging from his time with Sunrisers Hyderabad, or how he deals with a big match pressure, or most importantly the life in COVID times. While providing an insight on how he deals with pressure of a big final, the 35-year-old credited his clear mindset and immense self-belief coupled with spending some quality time with his family as his mantra. In the same breathe, he stressed on how unfair it is for Virat Kohli to be on the receiving end of all the criticisms coming his way in the past couple of years. “A lot of people talk about Virat Kohli’s form over the last couple of years; we have gone through a pandemic, he’s just had a baby. We only see how well he’s done; you earn the right to fail when you are so good at what you do”, remarked Warner on Kohli’s current form. Here is ⁦@davidwarner31⁩ on ⁦@imVkohli⁩ serious words of appreciation.

Upon consideration of the said report submitted by the Doctor, the Executive Committee of the SLC decided at a meeting held on Friday to remove the suspension of the said three players,\" the statement added. The remaining period (7 months) will remain suspended for a period of two years, during which the three players’ conduct will be closely monitored by the SLC.

It’s a complex set of calculations in which you have to weigh the score in the series and the state of the game, the likelihood of the team being humiliated again, the ambient temperature of the bedroom, the distance to the TV, the hour, and whatever you’ve got on the next day. Exhaustion multiplied by dejection divided by hope. Whatever the answer is, it absolutely isn’t 36 for four off 21.5 overs, 3-0 down in the series, 380 runs behind in the match, at three in the morning. That’s the time to make like the team have been, and roll over. And then Pat Cummins overstepped. It was his first called no-ball of the series. He missed his length and Ben Stokes smacked the ball back for four down the ground. That ended a stretch in which England, lost in the doldrums, had scored one run off 76 balls. Two balls later, he pulled four more, through square leg. It was the first twitch of resistance, the throbbing vein on the forehead of a man who, like all the rest of us, has had just about enough. In the next Cummins over, Stokes was nearly caught-and-bowled, in the over after that, Jonny Bairstow was almost caught at slip. And then something truly extraordinary happened. Cameron Green, bowling from around the wicket, fooled Stokes into shouldering his bat to a delivery that slanted in and hit his off-stump. But the bail barely moved, and the ball carried on through to the keeper. Stokes has never come across as a devout sort, but this freakish bit of good fortune felt like a sign of divine intervention, a finger on the scale, a thumb on the bail. All the luck England had missed in the first three Tests served up to him in one dollop. He grinned. And like all good god-fearing men came to the obvious conclusion that, today, at least, providence was with him. So fuck it. He uppercut Green over the slips, then clipped him through midwicket. Something was stirring. You could feel it. We’ve seen too little of this Stokes lately, while he has been labouring away on his best impression of a prim and proper top-order batsman, block, block, block. This was the Stokes who clears bars and empties beds. It was time to dash to the living room. In the next over Green smacked Stokes hard on the bottom hand. He was already in obvious pain, grimacing because of his side strain, but the wounds only seemed to harden him, as if battle had sharpened his instincts. Sometimes it happens like that. They always said Gordon Greenidge was more dangerous on one leg. Cummins brought on Mitchell Starc. Stokes hit him for one four through long-on, another through long-off, and another through midwicket. He came out of his crease to play Scott Boland, drove him hard through cover for four, and whipped him to square leg for three, a shot that brought up his fifty, England’s sixth of the tour, and the first by anyone other than Joe Root and Dawid Malan. And where he went, Bairstow followed. Early in his innings you could almost see Bairstow sheltering in his lee, he had four from his first 18 balls, 17 from his first 46, but as Stokes’ confidence grew, Bairstow’s did too. By the time Stokes was closing on his fifty, Bairstow was, for the first time in years, back batting at his best in a Test match. The muddled and messy player who has spent the last two years scratching around, in and out of the team, had turned back into the crisp, bristling batsman who looked so good when scored all those runs, and set all those records , in 2016. It was a masterful innings, especially in the way he cut and swept Nathan Lyon, and expertly measured. He accelerated his pace after he passed fifty and slowed again as he neared his hundred. There are all sorts of ways to talk about Bairstow’s innings, you could look at the data, which showed how he had doggedly blocked everything the seamers bowled him around the top of off, or the technique, and the way in which he switched his guard after he had passed fifty so was finally able to marry his white ball game with the demands of Test match cricket. But Bairstow chose to frame it in terms of the character he showed, especially after, like Stokes, he was wounded by a vicious blow that did serious damage to his bottom hand. “It’s about gritting your teeth and getting stuck in,” he said. “You’ve got to dig deep, these are the times you look at yourself and say: ‘What am I about and where do I come from? What’s the bit in the tank that keeps you coming back?’ I’d like to think that in 20 years time when I’m sat over a pint they’re the moments I’d like to look back on, and say: ‘When did you stand up? When did you front up for the other 10 blokes in the dressing room?’” There are lessons there, for the other batsmen in the team, yes, but for the management, too. Character isn’t a question of scheduling, or “systemic change”, it comes from the culture of the team, which comes, in turn, from the leadership. There was a ringing clarity about the way Stokes and Bairstow played, what they wanted to do and how they planned to do it, which was at complete odds with the confusion which has dogged England’s Test team, and their own careers, for the last few years. England have still lost the Ashes. England are still losing this game. But they showed they’re still worth getting up for, and gave a glimpse of how they might move forward, too.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b291753836be1e19c6838ea072d681b4bd414177/299_103_2675_1605/master/2675.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=330e897f69e387f5916672159d587c8f","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"“Will take this to the world Cricket committee for discussion”: Shane Warne hilariously replies to Sachin Tendulkar on his suggestion to treat ‘bowled’ dismissals akin LBWs when bails aren’t dislodged from stumps","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-will-take-this-to-the-world-cricket-committee-for-discussion-shane-warne-hilariously-replies-to-sachin-tendulkar-on-his-suggestion-to-treat-bowled-dismissals-akin-lbws-when-bails-arent-di/","keywords":["Cricket","Ashes 2021-22","Australia vs England","Sachin Tendulkar","Shane Warne"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shane Warne hilariously replies to Sachin Tendulkar upon latter’s advice regarding Ben Stokes’ lucky escape off a Cameron Green delivery.

The game of Cricket keeps giving its fans and followers some moments which can leave them absolutely slack-jawed. One such moment was witnessed by fans on Friday, Day 3 of the 4th Ashes Test match being played at The Sydney Cricket Ground. It all happened on the first delivery of the 31st Over bowled by Aussie all-rounder Cameron Green during England’s first innings. Bowling from around the stumps to Southpaw Ben Stokes, Cameron Green’s delivery nipped back in ever so slightly, but a clear case of misjudgment from Stokes meant that the ball hit a decent part of the off-stump. This is the point where the unusual stuff happens. The ball deflects off the stump to the left of the wicketkeeper, but unbelievably the adamant bails refuse to move an inch off their groove, handing a lifeline to the English batter. You can watch the event here. Shane Warne hilariously replies to Sachin Tendulkar Taking note of the aforementioned event, the Indian legendary batter Sachin Tendulkar took to his Twitter handle where he humorously suggested that there should be a law called ‘hitting the stumps’, which perhaps would mean that the batter is declared Out in case the bails refuse to fall off the stumps upon the ball hitting it. He then tagged the Aussie legendary spinner Shane Warne to know what he had to say regarding his ‘advice’. Warne took note of it, and went a step further while agreeing with Tendulkar, to state that he will take his advice to the world Cricket Committee for discussion and then come back to him, all in a what was a funny banter between the two greats of the game.

Las hazañas legendarias del delantero argentino de 34 años le han valido la reputación de ser uno de los mejores futbolistas que ha conocido el deporte. Messi ganó 35 títulos durante su prolífica carrera con el FC Barcelona, ​​incluidos 10 títulos de La Liga y cuatro títulos de la Liga de Campeones. El verano pasado, la leyenda del Barcelona acabó con su hambruna en la escena internacional con la victoria de Argentina en la Copa América 2021. Messi también es el poseedor del récord absoluto del Balón de Oro, dos veces por delante de su rival Ronaldo, y ganó la edición 2021 de France Football por séptima vez. Morgan, un amigo cercano de Ronaldo, reveló en su columna al Daily Mail 10 atletas legendarios que podrían hacer los “Sporting Goats”. El ex coanfitrión de Good Morning Britain admitió que había “muchos contendientes” por el título de fútbol GOAT y mencionó a jugadores como Messi, Pelé y Diego Maradona. Sin embargo, Morgan afirmó que el cinco veces ganador del Balón de Oro, Ronaldo, está “por encima de todos” y que es “el mejor futbolista real que jamás haya usado sus zapatos”. El franco presentador de 56 años también eliminó a la estrella de los Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tom Brady, de sus índices de audiencia. Brady ganó un récord de Super Bowl después de que los Buccaneers vencieran a los Kansas City Chiefs en el Estadio Raymond James en febrero. Morgan elogió al mariscal de campo de la NFL de 44 años como un “atleta fantástico” y lo elogió por su “extraordinaria ética de trabajo”. Sin embargo, el ex editor del Daily Mirror insistió en que la leyenda de la NFL Joe Montana sería la cabra en el fútbol americano antes que Brady. “Para mí, Brady no fue la estrella más grande de la NFL de todos los tiempos, ese premio es para Joe Montana. Incluso Brady admitió que Montana pertenece a una categoría propia”, escribió Morgan. Aquí están las 10 mejores elecciones de Morgan para la cabra deportiva. 10. Ayrton Senna (piloto de carreras) 9.
