Yorkshire were suspended in November from hosting international or major matches by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for their \"wholly unacceptable\" handling of Rafiq's racism claims. Rafiq also gave evidence in an emotional DCMS hearing two months ago, and in a column for Wednesday's Daily Mail , the former Yorkshire player said the county have shown positive progress since Lord Patel replaced Roger Hutton - enough, in Rafiq's view, for Headingley to host international cricket once more. \"It has been a whirlwind since I appeared in front of MPs almost two months ago, and what Yorkshire and Lord Patel have done to bring change is definitely a step in the right direction,\" Rafiq said. \"That is why I believe the time is right to say they should be given back the international cricket so vital to their very survival. The people of Yorkshire should be able to watch England in Test and white-ball games at Headingley this summer.

And that is why we were here in the first place. \"But if we are asking an institution to look at itself then we should recognise when it begins to show it is genuinely sorry and attempts to start putting things right. Yorkshire need to be supported and helped to move in that right direction. They do seem willing to do the right thing now. Hopefully their actions under new chair Lord Patel have shown that.\" Lord Patel also expressed his desire to see Yorkshire's suspension lifted, suggesting the ECB could make a decision by the end of January. The Yorkshire chair said in an op-ed on Tuesday: \"It is my hope that Yorkshire can set a clear template for other clubs to use so that we as a sport can raise the standard of how we treat others, and how we measure our success. \"It is also my hope that the people of Yorkshire and our supporters across the UK can now start to feel a glimmer of pride - and, of course, that the ECB's decision at the end of this month sees our beloved stadium again able to be a global stage for cricketing excellence. \"While we still have a long road and a lot of hard work ahead, the potential prize is great: a once in a generation opportunity not only to transform the game in Yorkshire, but also provide a model for learning and change - both in cricket and across the world of sport.\" Meanwhile, Rafiq also praised the appointment of Darren Gough as director of cricket, adding: \"I'm encouraged by his involvement, not least because the game needs people like him back directly involved. Goughie will get things done.\" A parliamentary committee report on cricket's racism crisis is due to be published on Friday. The cross-party DCMS committee said it will set out its findings later this week following Rafiq's hearing in November. Yorkshire accepted in September last year there was \"no question\" Rafiq had faced racial harassment and bullying during his time at the club, as they published a summary of the findings and recommendations of an independent report which got under way almost a year earlier. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player However, the county faced significant backlash for their decision not to publish the full report, or to take disciplinary action against any individuals based on the report. On the same day the committee heard from Rafiq, it also heard from the current and former chairs of Yorkshire - Lord Patel and Roger Hutton - and from England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison. Rafiq said attempts to raise complaints about the discriminatory treatment he faced at Yorkshire fell on deaf ears, before an investigation was finally launched in October 2020. Chief executive Mark Arthur resigned four days before Rafiq's appearance before the committee, while Yorkshire announced on December 3 that director of cricket Martyn Moxon and head coach Andrew Gale were among 16 members of staff who had been dismissed. Lord Patel said on November 8 that the county had settled a separate employment tribunal claim from Rafiq. The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC), which is looking at racism and discrimination within the game, said it was \"inundated\" with more than 2,000 responses in the fortnight after it opened a call for evidence on November 9. On November 29, the ECB published a game-wide 12-point plan to tackle discrimination, with Harrison admitting the sport had been hit by an \"earthquake\" following the allegations of racism at county level from Rafiq and other players. The plan includes a governance review of the ECB, which will consider whether the sport needs an independent regulator. The effectiveness of its oversight of Yorkshire's handling of the Rafiq investigation was questioned by the DCMS committee. The game-wide plan will also tackle dressing-room culture, attempt to remove any barriers that exist in the talent pathway and endeavour to make cricket a more inclusive environment for players and spectators. Organisations have also been set targets for board diversity to include 30 per cent female or locally representative ethnicity by April. Compliance will be subject to a \"comply or explain\" provision. ECB central funding could be withheld where equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) minimum standards are not met.","image_url":"https://e2.365dm.com/21/11/1920x1080/skysports-azeem-rafiq-dcms_5584718.jpg?20211116105058","source_id":"skysports"},{"title":"‘Resilient’ Kohli falls short of elusive ton due to Rabada brilliance","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/resilient-kohli-falls-short-of-elusive-ton-due-to-rabada-brilliance/video/3a55fd7822da1127f44e1ed62b5fecee","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Despite a stellar knock, Indian captain Virat Kohli has fallen short of breaking his century drought due to the individual brilliance of Proteas star Kagiso Rabada.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-11 22:32:09","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Kiwis seal crushing innings victory over Bangladesh in second Test","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/kiwis-seal-crushing-innings-victory-over-bangladesh-in-second-test/video/98ac767cfe084c1698aca111abbc06e1","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: The Black Caps have given retiring champion Ross Taylor a fitting farewell after crushing Bangladesh in the second Test to level the series at 1-1.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-11 20:28:09","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news"},{"title":"Carey’s Test career on notice as ‘ever present threat’ emerges","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/ashes-2022-australia-vs-england-cricket-news-fourth-test-in-hobart-alex-carey-vs-josh-inglis-followon-podcast-fox-cricket/news-story/ecf1bd58cac6e794aeed463653b3db0b","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Leading cricket writer Robert ‘Crash’ Craddock believes Josh Inglis is in the mix to oust Alex Carey from the Test team if the incumbent slips up again.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-11 20:24:00","full_description":"Leading cricket writer Robert ‘Crash’ Craddock believes Josh Inglis is in the mix to oust Alex Carey from the Test team if the incumbent slips up again. Carey is averaging 15 with the bat in his debut summer and dropped two catches diving to his right at the SCG. While Inglis is part of the squad for the Hobart Test, he is not expected to play yet. Speaking on Fox Cricket’s Follow-On podcast, Craddock expressed disappointment with the South Australian’s Ashes thus far. Catch every moment of The Ashes live and ad-break free during play on Kayo.

NEW PODCAST - Crash Craddock: So many storylines, so little time SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES OR SPOTIFY “He (Carey) will play in Hobart and then Josh Inglis goes to Pakistan with him and is very much part of the equation,” Craddock said on the podcast. “He would not want to start badly in Pakistan… I have been surprised about his batting, which I rated so highly. He hasn’t really clicked. They will stick with him in Pakistan. The threat from Inglis is ever present. They really like Inglis but he may need to bake in the oven a little more.” Former English keeper Jack Russell was critical of Carey’s technique earlier this week on Twitter, while Fox Cricket’s Brad Haddin and Adam Gilchrist also analysed his sluggish movement closely. Craddock recalled a conversation he had at the start of the summer in which an ex-Test gloveman flagged a possible issue with Carey’s glovework. “One of the best predictions before the series was that a former Test keeper and a very close watcher of Sheffield Shield cricket said to me in the ranks there was one concern about Carey,” Craddock continued. “It was that he was keeping to the mid-pace range South Australian attack, which would not condition him to taking the thunderbolts of Starc and Cummins to the one out wide. The one you won’t get that often. It’s a different voltage. They were worried about that and that’s where he fell down. The specky to his right. READ MORE Australia is facing a selection nightmare.

If he was more confident, he would be more towards first slip. Saying ‘I will clean up down there if it matters, I want to be out here thanks so that when the specky comes, I’m away’.” Craddock also had his say on the ongoing Justin Langer issue, confirming his belief the coach could resign before the Pakistan tour. “He can be proud of what he’s done… He’s done a good job,” Craddock said of Langer. “I just believe Justin is unlucky in many ways. I think he will quit while he’s on top. It will probably be as much his decision as anyone. And he can leave with his head held high, maybe even before the Pakistan tour.” Also on the Follow-On podcast, Craddock discussed: - The likely Australian XI for Hobart - England’s woes - Usman Khawaja’s brilliance - The top five innings for the summer so far, - Plus more!","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"“Credit to him, he batted very well”: Kagiso Rabada praises Virat Kohli for his gritty half-century during IND VS SA Cape Town Test","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-credit-to-him-he-batter-very-well-kagiso-rabada-praises-virat-kohli-for-his-gritty-half-century-during-ind-vs-sa-cape-town-test/","keywords":["Cricket","India tour of South Africa 2021-22","Kagiso Rabada","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kagiso Rabada praises Virat Kohli after latter grinded it out to propel team India to a respectable total versus South Africa at Cape Town.

During the first day of the third Test of the ongoing India’s tour of South Africa in Cape Town, team India skipper Virat Kohli played a stellar knock of 79 off 201 deliveries, with the assistance of 12 Fours and a Six. With India yet again losing wickets at regular intervals, Kohli was left to bat with the tail, and eventually succumbed to a delivery by the Proteas speedster Kagiso Rabada that edged the ball through to the wicketkeeper. While the 33-year-0ld yet again missed out on a wonderful opportunity to notch up his elusive 71st International Century, his innings on Tuesday was one of absolute class and resolute, considering the lively nature of the pitch at Newlands. Rabada, who accounted for the dismissal of four Indian batters, credited his opposition skipper for his disciplined knock. That will be STUMPS on Day 1 of the 3rd Test.

Although it was a similar sort of a delivery away from his body, which eventually got him, Rabada praised Kohli for leaving the ball quite well during the course of his innings. When asked about his contest with Virat Kohli, Rabada exclaimed, “I was trying to swing the ball away, not bowl at his pads. Credit to him, he batted very well. He left well too. “There is still a lot in the wicket. You don’t have control over conditions. Batsmen have to grind it out.” Kohli was praised from fans and experts for his percentage knock which comprised 201 deliveries. He, in fact batted with a control percentage of 92 throughout his innings, until being forced to bat aggressively with wickets tumbling down at the other end. As far as his contest with Rabada in Test Cricket is concerned, the right-hander averaged 98 against him before the innings on Tuesday. Kohli had struck a total of 196 runs, comprising 30 Fours off the Proteas speedster’s bowling.   The post “Credit to him, he batted very well”: Kagiso Rabada praises Virat Kohli for his gritty half-century during IND VS SA Cape Town Test appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-11 19:14:13","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"MyCricket masters: Are you better than a Test cricketer?","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/are-you-better-than-a-test-cricketer-breaking-down-the-mycricket-stats-of-our-ashes-heroes/news-story/3d855ab5bbb7c30f675afeb0bc0f6e2c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australian Test star Cameron Green was a teenage superstar of West Australian cricket, plundering his maiden first grade century as a 17-year-old in just his second season playing against men for the Subiaco-Floreat Cricket Club.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-11 19:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost"},{"title":"India vs South Africa, 3rd Test, Day 1 Highlights: South Africa 17/1 At Stumps, Trail India By 206 Runs | Cricket News - NDTVSports.com","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaW5kaWEtdnMtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLTNyZC10ZXN0LWRheS0xLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0yNzAxMTIy0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs South Africa, 3rd Test, Day 1 Highlights: South Africa 17/1 At Stumps, Trail India By 206 Runs | Cricket News  NDTVSports.comIndia vs South Africa 3rd Test Day 1 Highlights: Bumrah removes Elgar; South Africa 17/1 at stumps after India fold for 223  Times of IndiaIND vs SA: Twitter Reacts As Virat Kohli Gets Dismissed For 79 In Cape Town As His Wait For 71st Century Continues  Cricket AddictorLive match blog - India vs South Africa 3rd Test 2021/22 - Cricket Insights  ESPNcricinfo.com89 dots, no cover drive for 16 balls: Coach Rathour hails Virat Kohli’s discipline  The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-11 18:44:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Kevin Pietersen last match: Which was the last competitive match Kevin Pietersen played in?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-kevin-pietersen-last-match-which-was-the-last-competitive-match-kevin-pietersen-played-in/","keywords":["Cricket","kevin pietersen"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kevin Pietersen last match: The former England batter has played in various leagues around the world post retiring as England player in 2014.

If one complies a list of all-time greats of England’s men Cricketers, the aggressive right-handed batter Kevin Pietersen would seamlessly feature at least in the Top-10. A simple glance at his numbers in both the ODI and the Test formats of the game is enough testament of the value he brought to his team during his 10-year long career as an England professional cricketer. In the Test format, the 41-year-old has scored a total of 8181 runs across 104 matches, at an impressive average of 47.28. He has also smashed 23 centuries in the format, and is second only to Alastair Cook in the list of most Test centuries for England. Across all the formats, he is still ranked third in the all-time highest run scorers list with 13779 runs across 275 matches at an average of 44.30. He is placed only behind Joe Root (16557 runs) and Alastair Cook (15737 runs). Kevin Pietersen last match Pietersen last played his Test match against Australia from January 3-5 in 2014, in what was a forgetful England’s tour of Australia for the Ashes series. The England side were whitewashed 0-5, and it also marked the end of Pietersen’s stellar career. His last ODI was against England again, but at home in Southampton on September 16, 2013 which England had again lost by 49 runs. He then went on to play his final First-Class game for Surrey against Lancashire from May 31-June 3, 2015.

He played a total of 9 matches (6 innings) for the Gladiators and scored 155 runs at an average of 19.37, which included a match-winning knock of 52 off 34 deliveries against Karachi Kings to guide his team home by 67 runs.   View this post on Instagram   A post shared by Kevin Pietersen MBE (@kevinpietersen) Although his stint with Quetta Gladiators was his last in competitive Cricket, he also led the England Legends side in the inaugral season of The Road Safety World Series last year. He scored a total of 177 runs across 5 innings at an average of 35.40.

The iconic leg-spinner is the second-highest wicket-taker in Test history, bamboozling batsmen time after time during a glittering 17-year international career. Warne is a true sporting iconGetty And he remains a popular figure in the gameGetty But the 52-year-old, now one of the game’s most popular commentators, famously found himself at the centre of numerous controversies off the field. Having emerged as one of the most well-known sportsmen on the planet, Warne would often feature on the front pages of global newspapers as well as the back, and in 2005 it cost him his marriage. In a new documentary called ‘Shane’, the Victorian reflects on playing through an emotional pain barrier to compete in the 2005 Ashes, which ended in defeat for Australia and went down as one of the greatest series in history. He told talkSPORT: “The lowest point in my life was the 2005 Ashes series. I was playing for Hampshire for a couple of months and the kids would come over just before the Ashes started. They were at school, so that was their school holiday time. “Unfortunately, an article in the papers came out. That led to divorce and the kids going home a week after arriving. Warne was married to Simone Callahan between 1995 and 2005 before a highly-publicised splitGetty “I had to then pick myself off the canvas and try to start an Ashes series, which wasn’t easy. It was a pretty tough time in my life. It’s not easy when your personal life is always in the papers and it has been for 30 years. “When it’s your own doing, it’s not easy to take, but I have to live with that. “I wasn’t going to pull out of an Ashes series. The kids wanted me to play, so I did. But that was a really tough time. “It was the only Ashes I played in that we lost and it was probably one of the greatest series of all time. “I did pretty well with the bat and ball. I was pretty proud of my own achievement given the personal hardship and tough personal situation I was in.” Warne shares three children with his ex-wife Simone Callahan – Brooke, 23, Jackson, 22, and Summer, 20. The former cricketer reveals they are the most important thing in his life and they continue to fill him with pride. Warne was still Australia’s best player during the iconic 2005 Ashes seriesGetty He added: “We’ve had lots of chats over the years, now that they’re older, about some of the good stuff, some of the bad stuff they wanted to understand, and we’ve all got a great relationship. “They’re the most important things in my life. Some of the choices I made in my life, at a younger age, I have to live with for the rest of my life and it affected them. “It’s not easy to live with. It’s not easy to talk about. But I think it was important to talk about with my children that we’re all human. “Sometimes people like to judge, which I don’t like to do. But my children just see me as dad. It’s been a really cool journey with them, watching them develop into wonderful adults – well-rounded, well-mannered, grateful. So I’m really proud of that achievement.” On the field, Warne has plenty of records to brag about, but being such a jovial character, he decided to discuss some of the more embarrassing feats of his career. GettyWarne was famous for his gravity-defying leg breaks[/caption] The Aussie continued: “I think there’s only two of us in the history of the game who have taken more than 300 wickets, scored more than 3000 runs, and more than 100 catches – that’s me and Ian Botham. “I have got a few records you might like that I’m not proud of! I’ve got the most Test runs in the history of the game without a hundred. I was hit for the most sixes until Muttiah Muralitharan got hit for a few more in his last game. Glenn McGrath got nought in his last Test, so he beat me to the most ducks!” However, the history books might look a little different if St Kilda Aussie Rules Football Club decided not to ditch a young Warne, who reveals cricket was third on his priority list growing up. He added: “I didn’t dream of playing cricket for Australia. I dreamed of being Dennis Lilee and Ian Chappell in the backyard, like most Aussie kids did in the seventies and early eighties. “But I wanted to play Aussie rules football. I played at St Kilda for a while. I was also playing tennis and ranking No. 2 in Victoria. Things could’ve been different if this kid ended up playing Aussie rulesGetty “I had a fair bit of sport going on and suddenly I got the letter from St Kilda, saying my services were no longer required. “That was like a dagger, being told you’re not good enough to do your dream. “Then I thought I’d have a proper crack at tennis, but I started doing quite well at cricket. “I played a couple of games for Victoria and then I was playing for Australia. It all happened between giving up Aussie rules, thinking about playing tennis, then 18 months later I was playing for Australia. “At my first Test match, I had to introduce myself to some of the players because I’d never met them! “I’ve never been given anything easy in my life, I’ve had to work for absolutely everything that I’ve earned – and I like it that way.” Betting Offer Of The Day 888Sport – Bet £10 Get £30 + £10 Casino Bonus – CLAIM HERE New customers only.

So I’m really proud of that achievement.” On the field, Warne has plenty of records to brag about, but being such a jovial character, he decided to discuss some of the more embarrassing feats of his career. The Aussie continued: “I think there’s only two of us in the history of the game who have taken more than 300 wickets, scored more than 3000 runs, and more than 100 catches – that’s me and Ian Botham. “I have got a few records you might like that I’m not proud of! I’ve got the most Test runs in the history of the game without a hundred. I was hit for the most sixes until Muttiah Muralitharan got hit for a few more in his last game. Glenn McGrath got nought in his last Test, so he beat me to the most ducks!” However, the history books might look a little different if St Kilda Aussie Rules Football Club decided not to ditch a young Warne, who reveals cricket was third on his priority list growing up. He added: “I didn’t dream of playing cricket for Australia. I dreamed of being Dennis Lilee and Ian Chappell in the backyard, like most Aussie kids did in the seventies and early eighties. “But I wanted to play Aussie rules football. I played at St Kilda for a while. I was also playing tennis and ranking No. 2 in Victoria. “I had a fair bit of sport going on and suddenly I got the letter from St Kilda, saying my services were no longer required. “That was like a dagger, being told you’re not good enough to do your dream. “Then I thought I’d have a proper crack at tennis, but I started doing quite well at cricket. “I played a couple of games for Victoria and then I was playing for Australia. It all happened between giving up Aussie rules, thinking about playing tennis, then 18 months later I was playing for Australia. “At my first Test match, I had to introduce myself to some of the players because I’d never met them! “I’ve never been given anything easy in my life, I’ve had to work for absolutely everything that I’ve earned – and I like it that way.” 888Sport – Bet £10 Get £30 + £10 Casino Bonus – CLAIM HERE New customers only.

With the Indian Premier League 2022 mega auction just around a month away, the Cricketing fraternity has yet again shifted its focus on discussions around BCCI’s lucrative league. With the 15th season of the league set to be a 10-team affair, the competition promises to be a lot more spicier this year onwards. As per the latest development around the cash-rich league, India’s Multinational conglomerate Tata Group has replaced Vivo to bag the title sponsorship rights of the IPL for two upcoming seasons-2022 and 2023. Apart from the above news, CVC Capitals, owners of the Ahmedabad-based franchise which is set to make its debut in the upcoming season, has also been handed the Letter of Intent (LoI) after its maiden participation in the league hovered under dark clouds, ever since its stakes in overseas betting firms surfaced. Tata IPL title sponsor: How much will Tata pay BCCI? Vivo has terminated its contract with two editions remaining. Moreover, with IPL 2022 set to witness an increase in the number of matches (74 as against 60), the BCCI is set to receive a humongous sum from Tata Group for the next two years. Vivo was supposed to shell out INR 68 Crore (34+34) for the next two seasons as increment fees for increase in the number of matches. Including the total rights fee (INR 602 Crore) for the upcoming two seasons, the Chinese Mobile manufacturing company had agreed to pay a total of INR 183 Crore (2022) and INR 211 Crore (2023)= INR 394 Crore in addition to the aforementioned increment fee. An addition of a further 6% assignment fee for two years- INR 29 Crore + INR 31 Crore, the total amount set to be earned by the BCCI via title sponsorship rights is INR 1124 Crores. Rights Fee: 301 (2022) + 301 (2023) = Total 602 Incremental fees for additional matches: 34cr (2022) + 34cr (2023) = 68 Payable by Vivo: 183cr (2022) + 211cr (2023) = 394cr 6% assignment fee – Vivo: 29cr (2022) + 31cr (2023) = 60cr Total receivable by BCCI – 1124cr#IPL — Subhayan Chakraborty (@CricSubhayan) January 11, 2022 To put things in perspective, the Indian Cricket board was to earn INR 996 Crore from Vivo as part of the initial deal. Thus, BCCI’s earnings go up by INR 130 Crore further for a period of two years.     The post Tata IPL title sponsor: How much will Tata Group pay BCCI during IPL 2022 and 2023? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-11 15:18:01","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Virat Kohli centuries list: How many days Virat Kohli without century in Test cricket?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-virat-kohli-centuries-list-how-many-days-virat-kohli-without-century-in-test-cricket/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of South Africa 2021-22","South Africa","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli centuries list: The Indian captain played well at Newlands but continues to be devoid of a century in international cricket.

India Test captain Virat Kohli might not have got the runs he would’ve liked for his team to score after him winning the toss and electing to bat first but he himself batted exceptionally well on the first day of the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. Coming on the back of missing the second Test due to a back spasm, Kohli scored a disciplined 28th Test half-century top-scoring for his team with his 79 (201) comprising of 12 fours and a six. Kohli might have missed out on an elusive Test century but the manner in which he played at the Newlands today was no less than batting during a Test century. Taking his time initially, Kohli managed to survive potentially wicket-taking deliveries on multiple occasions. Despite India losing wickets at regular intervals from the other end, Kohli appeared hell-bent to not play a false stroke until his dismissal. Kohli, who didn’t even hesitate from driving the ball through the covers, ensured to leave deliveries which were bowled away from his reach. Had it not been for India losing as many as eight wickets, one might have seen Kohli adopting a difference approach than looking to sneak a single off Kagiso Rabada. A top-notch knock otherwise, Kohli’s innings will be remembered as one of his best innings which didn’t get converted into a three-figure mark. How many days Virat Kohli without century in Test cricket? It is worth mentioning that Kohli’s last international century had come against Bangladesh in India’s inaugural pink-ball Test match at the Eden Gardens in 2019.

Root’s future as captain has also been questioned, but Warne insists the batsman just needs better advisers around him. The iconic spinner told talkSPORT: “I think Joe Root is the man to captain the side. I think he should remain as captain. “What he needs, though, is not sports science people or data. He can have those people in the background. Root has endured a winter – and indeed calendar year – to forget as England skipperGetty “But what he needs around him is hard, Test match players, who have been there and know the game of cricket. “They can help him with tactics and strategy. If you surround him with a few of those people, you’ll see the best of Root. At the moment, I don’t think he’s getting the right cricket advice. “You would have to say there’s not enough good cricket knowledge people around him.” Nevertheless, the Aussie legend refuses to defend some of the decisions by Root and co. which have characterised England’s embarrassing tour.

The first Test match, on a green seamer, two weeks of rain, which had never happened before in the history of Brisbane – to not pick Broad and Anderson? “Then to play five seamers in Adelaide, when it was spinning square, it just didn’t make any sense at all. “I’ve never seen an England side come over to Australia and make such bad decisions.

The closest that raindrops fell in Cape Town was right after the start of the second session in the afternoon. Having said that, it wasn’t intense to an extent that players had to walk off the ground. Walking the talk after winning the toss and electing to bat, India captain Virat Kohli scored his 28th Test half-century with batters getting out at regular intervals at the other end. Grit. Patience. Determination. Discipline. Fifty #Kohli — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) January 11, 2022 After grinding it out in the middle in the first two sessions, Kohli has just started to reap rewards with slightly quicker run-scoring in the third session at the Newlands. Cape Town weather tomorrow Much like Day 1, Day 2 of the third Test match is also expected to be a cloudy day in Cape Town. Another similarity on both the days will be the lack of rainfall over the stadium. According to AccuWeather, there’s a heavy cloud cover predicted in Cape Town on Wednesday. In spite of the same, rain probability is almost nil for the whole of Wednesday. In such a scenario, fans across the world can be rest assured about an uninterrupted spell of Test cricket. Even if rain pours down due to the cloudy weather tomorrow, it should (at maximum) be a passing shower.

Kohli put in a resilient effort to get to a fifty off 158 deliveries on a difficult Newlands track. Incidentally, this is Kohli’s second-slowest half-century following a 172-ball effort earlier in his career. Kohli was perhaps fortunate to survive 10 minutes before tea when South Africa claimed a catch by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne off seamer Duanne Olivier. It was given not out, but on review, there was a small flutter as the ball passed the bat on the technology used to determine if the batsman had got an edge. It was deemed not enough evidence to overturn the decision though. SA vs IND, 3rd Test: Day 1 Score and Updates Kohli returned to the side after missing the second Test with back spasms, but his form has been under some scrutiny after averaging only 26.08 in 14 Tests since the start of 2020, well below his career mark of 50.34. India won the toss and elected to bat in overcast conditions, the 15th time in their last 16 Tests that South Africa have lost the flip of the coin.

During the first day of the third Test of the ongoing India’s tour of South Africa in Cape Town, India batter Cheteshwar Pujara couldn’t convert his start into a substantial innings. Pujara, who put together a rescuing 62-run partnership for the third wicket alongside captain Virat Kohli, failed soon after the lunch break after scoring 43 (77) with the help of seven fours. Pujara, who started South Africa fast bowler Marco Jansen’s eighth over with a confident flick for a boundary, couldn’t keep away from a challenging delivery in the same over. Pitched on a tight line and length, Jansen moved the delivery enough to induce an outside edge off Pujara’s bat. With the batting falling for the trap, South Africa managed to dismiss the third Indian batter after Kohli won the toss and chose to bat this morning.

Cheteshwar Pujara last century in Tests As far as Pujara’s last Test century is concerned, it had come more than three years ago during 2019’s New Year’s Test against Australia in Sydney when the right-hand batter had scored a match-winning 193 (373). In 27 Test matches since then, Pujara has scored 1,278 runs at an average of 27.78 including 12 half-centuries. A Test average of <30 for a player of Pujara’s class for as many as 41 Test innings highlights how run-scoring has been a onerous task for him despite some pivotal contributions in the recent years. Cheteshwar Pujara highest Test score in Test matches It is worth mentioning that Pujara’s highest Test score of 206* (389) had come against England in Ahmedabad a decade ago. In what was Pujara’s second Test century, it was also his maiden Test double century.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Brijesh Patel confirmed that TATA will replace VIVO as the main sponsor for the upcoming edition of the tournament. \"Yes, TATA will replace Vivo as the title sponsor,\" Patel had told ANI. Vivo still has two years left in its sponsorship deal with the league and as a result, during this period, Tata will remain the main sponsor.

Sidebottom, the former Yorkshire and England bowler, joined the coaching staff last week on an interim basis to work under the county’s new director of cricket, Darren Gough. While discussing his new position, and the scandal sparked by Azeem Rafiq’s allegations of racism at the county, he told Sky Sports: “It’s been tough viewing, tough listening, seeing social media. It’s been very difficult for lots of reasons for a lot of people. Let’s try and forget about it. “There’s no room for racism in any walk of life and hopefully now we can move forward, sort things out, do the right thing and get Yorkshire back firing on all cylinders. But it’s been a tough couple of months hasn’t it for Yorkshire and everyone at the club.” Rafiq, who alleged he had been the victim of racism and harassment during two spells at Headingley as a player, responded to Sidebottom’s comments on Twitter. “Let’s definitely not just ‘Forget it’. Learn from it and make things better,” he wrote . “Wish it was that easy just to forget it and pretend nothing happened.” Rafiq also claimed he had reached out to Sidebottom privately before responding, without reply. Sidebottom later apologised , saying: “I disagree wholeheartedly with discrimination and fully support all investigations and actions surrounding any racial abuse at Yorkshire. In my interview with Sky Sports News, I used the word ‘forget’. This is not what I meant. I didn’t mean that the situation should be forgotten about, on the contrary, it must never be forgotten. “It was a poor choice of words. It is crucial that the club, and sport as a whole, learns and adapts to create a truly inclusive environment for all, at all levels. I apologise for any offence caused. I am now focused on supporting the playing group at Yorkshire CCC on the pitch.” He described his choice of words as “wrong, and an honest mistake”. The 43-year-old, who began and ended his playing career at Headingley, winning three County Championships, was appointed as interim coach at Yorkshire alongside his former England teammate Steve Harmison. The England and Wales Cricket Board’s investigation into Rafiq’s allegations and Yorkshire’s handling of the case is still continuing.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b89bd07ccb8e0e1398851569b7d8d45fd15aad/0_155_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c1bd484ef1de951488dc5c4a4dd1f967","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Washington Sundar news: What happened to Washington Sundar?

India all-rounder Washington Sundar’s chances of making an ODI comeback after more than four years has been hit drastically after he has returned a positive COVID-19 test in Mumbai. Part of an 18-member squad for a three-match ODI series in South Africa, Sundar was originally scheduled to leave for South Africa (from Mumbai) on Wednesday morning alongside other white-ball specialists. Will Washington Sundar tour South Africa for ODI series? Sundar, who had last played international cricket during a home series against England last year, is all in likeliness of spending more time away from the sport at the highest level. It is worth mentioning that Sundar had missed tour of England and Indian Premier League 2021 Phase 2 due to a finger injury. Got to feel for this boy. It’s been a constant struggle with injuries and breakdowns. And just when one thought it’s all behind him, Covid causes fresh headache. Sincerely wish he comes out of all this as soon as possible. Wonderful cricketer. https://t.co/bScD8XuGQt — KSR (@KShriniwasRao) January 11, 2022 Having most recently returned to competitive cricket with a stint for Tamil Nadu in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Sundar was recalled into the ODI squad with a hope of the 22-year old player adding to his solitary ODI cap. In eight List A matches including a final against Himachal Pradesh in Jaipur, Sundar had picked 16 wickets at an average of 17.93, an economy rate of 4.73 and a strike rate of 22.5 to be the third-highest wicket-taker in the tournament. In eight batting innings, Sundar’s 148 runs had come at a strike rate of 83.61. However, testing positive for COVID-19 ahead of team’s schedule departure for a three-match series is almost certain for becoming a hindrance in as far as Sundar’s international comeback is concerned. “He [Washington Sundar] tested positive some days back and it has been decided that he will not travel with the squad,” a BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) office-bearer told Cricbuzz recently. Spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin are two other spin-bowling options for India in their ODI squad. The post Washington Sundar news: What happened to Washington Sundar?

The 37-year-old signed off as New Zealand's most prolific test batsman with 7,683 runs, which include 19 hundreds, from 112 matches with an average of 44.66. But the hosts' decision to enforce the follow-on had denied Taylor one last chance to add to his tally in the second match at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. With New Zealand one wicket away from victory in third day's final session, skipper Tom Latham tossed the ball to Taylor. And the part-time spinner duly obliged, claiming the last Bangladesh wicket of Ebadot Hossain with his third delivery to seal victory by an innings and 117 runs. \"I was getting pressure from the crowd and also the boys, to bowl (Taylor),\" said Latham, who took the catch to complete Ebadot's dismissal. \"The umpires played their part as well. It was actually very dark out there. \"They said we can't bowl seamers and that led to my decision to bowl Ross and that's the way it worked out. It couldn't be scripted any better.\" Latham, whose 252 earned him man-of-the-match award, said it was particularly pleasing to be involved in Taylor's last act in test cricket. \"Everyone wanted me to take that catch and sign off a test like that, and for Ross to have another test wicket under his belt was pretty special,\" he added. \"It's a massive test for Ross this one and his final one. The servant he's been for New Zealand cricket over 17 years has been absolutely amazing and we're looking forward to celebrating with him and his family tonight. \"He's inspired generations. He's inspired me to play cricket ... To play cricket with him and play in his final test is pretty special,\" Latham said. Bangladesh had accorded Taylor a guard of honour when he came out to bat in the first innings and the visitors' captain Mominul Haque said he was well worthy of it \"I've admired him since my early days. He's a legend of New Zealand cricket and he'd be missed,\" said Mominul. \"We knew it was his last test, so we wanted to honour his outstanding career by giving him a guard of honour.\" (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by Peter Rutherford)","image_url":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2022/01/11/1439894.jpg","source_id":"thestar_my"},{"title":"South African all-rounder Chris Morris retires from all forms of cricket","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/south-african-all-rounder-chris-morris-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket/article38232701.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["PTI"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chris Morris represented South Africa in four Tests, 42 ODIs and 23 T20 Internationals, picking up 48 and 34 wickets respectively","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-11 09:11:56","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu"},{"title":"South African all-rounder Chris Morris retires from all forms of cricket","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/south-african-all-rounder-chris-morris-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket-2022-01-11-753865","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa all-rounder Chris Morris on Tuesday announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.

The part-time spinner sent down two dot balls, before inducing a skied shot from Ebadot Hossain and Latham took a tumbling catch at midwicket to ensure a winning farewell for the former New Zealand captain. Ross Taylor takes a 𝗪𝗜𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧 to finish his Test career 😂 Cricket, what a sport ❤️ @RossLTaylor , what a legend 🐐 #NZvBAN pic.twitter.com/Vy7JiRwtBV “It’s a great way to finish,” said Taylor, New Zealand’s most prolific Test batsman with 7,683 runs, which include 19 hundreds, from 112 matches with an average of 44.66. “I wanted to finish with a win and the guys definitely gave it to me. “It was an emotional game for me and my family … it was good to get the win,” added the 37-year-old, who will play his last limited-overs internationals against Australia and the Netherlands during the home summer. The victory margin could have been bigger but for Liton Das’s counter-attacking 102 for Bangladesh, who had surprised the world Test champions in the opening match in Mount Maunganui. Smarting from their shock eight-wicket loss there, New Zealand enforced the follow-on before their seamers ensured victory. “The bowlers did a bloody good job on a tiring wicket,” Latham said. “Ross Taylor rocked up and took the last wicket. He has been there for 17 years … been such an important member of the group.” Latham, whose 252 earned him the man-of-the-match award, took a stunning catch at second slip to dismiss Mohammad Naim as Bangladesh started to unravel. Neil Wagner subjected the tourists’ batsmen to a bouncer barrage and was rewarded with figures of three for 77, while Kyle Jamieson claimed four for 82. Bangladesh’s captain Mominul Haque (37) and Nurul Hasan (36) could not convert their starts into big knocks but Liton scored freely to bring up his second Test hundred in 106 balls. “I’m really happy with the first Test, but second Test was disappointing,” Mominul said.
