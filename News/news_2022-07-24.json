The 32-year-old patiently stroked his way to the quadruple ton after facing 450 deliveries in the middle, helping his Welsh side reach a club high 795 first innings total. Glamorgan batsman Sam Northeast slogs a huge six to bring up a record 400 not out innings, becoming the 11th individual to log the mammoth score Northeast came out against the Leicestershire bowling attack in the sixth over, after both openers were dismissed for three runs combined. The Englishman joins a world-class list of batsman to reach the mammoth total, becoming the 11th individual to smack 400 plus. The 192-game first class number four brought up 400 with a cracking slog sweep, smacking quick Roman Walker back over his head. He continued to run a muck, smoking another six on the following ball, embarrassing the home side. Northeast is just 34 runs short of 12,000 first class career runs and has an average of 40 across 325 innings. The England under-19 representative spent 82 overs in the middle, as Glamorgan led by 211 on the final stint of the four day test. Northeast raises the bat after reaching a century against Nottinghamshire on July 13 – he has made 11966 first class runs The side went on to bowl out Leicestershire for 183, winning the division two match by an innings and 28 runs. Cricket fanatics were quick to congratulate Northeast on his huge innings. ‘Take a bow Sam Northeast…who just became the first ever Glamorgan player to score 400 in an innings. And he’s still going on 410 off 450 balls,’ BBC commentator Aatif Nawaz wrote on Twitter. Northeast was joined by number seven Glamorgan batsman Chris Cooke, to combine for a record 461 run partnership, with Cooke not out on 191. West Indies legend Brian Lara creates cricket history in 1994 after surpassing Garfield Sobers first innings record of 365 Legends of the game Brian Lara and Donald Bradman are two batsman the Welshman played himself into a prestigious group with, scoring 501* and 452* respectively. In 1994, West Indian icon Brian Lara amassed 501 runs off 427 deliveries, including 62 fours and 10 sixes – he remains the only first class batsman to surpass 500.

During its recent Apex Council meeting, the Indian cricket board revealed its expenditure on other stuff besides cricket to its members. As per the BCCI document, the board donated Rs 10 crore to the Indian Olympic Association to support the country's athletes competing at the Tokyo Olympic Games, a Times of India report said. Earlier, late in March, the Indian cricket board felicitated Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra, bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain and members of the bronze-medal-winning Indian men's hockey team before the IPL's opening match. Javelin thrower Chopra was awarded Rs 1 crore while the hockey team was given Rs 1.25 crore in total. Boxer Lovlina Borgohain was awarded Rs 25 lakh. Apart from them, Rs 50 lakh each was also awarded to the two silver medallists -- weightlifter Mirabai Chanu and wrestler Ravi Dahiya. In line with Borgohain, the other bronze medallists -- shuttler PV Sindhu and wrestler Bajrang Punia -- were given Rs 25 lakh each. The BCCI spent Rs 5 crore on PM Care Mementos for Olympics participants. Close to ? 9.5 crore were also spent on 'Support to Indian Contingent for Tokyo Olympics' and its sub-categories. The report further said that BCCI also donated Rs 3.8 cr to buy Oxygen Concentrators during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Notably, on May 24, 2021, the BCCI had announced that it would contribute 2000 Oxygen concentrators (10-Litre capacity) to boost India's efforts in overcoming the deadly virus. \"The nation has been hit by an unprecedented second wave of the coronavirus with demands for medical equipment and life-saving oxygen witnessing a major spike. Over the next few months, the Board will distribute the concentrators across India with the hope that critical medical aid and care will be provided to the needy patients and this initiative will reduce the havoc unleashed by the pandemic,\" the BCCI had said in a statement at that time. --IANS avn/bsk (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","pubDate":"2022-07-24 02:09:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220724/thumb-122072400006.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘My goal is to play all three formats for England’: Sam Curran is ready to be the new Ben Stokes","link":"https://247newsaroundtheworld.com/sports/my-goal-is-to-play-all-three-formats-for-england-sam-curran-is-ready-to-be-the-new-ben-stokes/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["247 News Around The World"],"video_url":null,"description":"247 News Around The World 247 News Around The World ‘My goal is to play all three formats for England’: Sam Curran… The post ‘My goal is to play all three formats for England’: Sam Curran is ready to be the new Ben Stokes appeared first on 247 News Around The World.","content":"247 News Around The World 247 News Around The World ‘My goal is to play all three formats for England’: Sam Curran prepares to show he can be the new Ben Stokes as the all-rounder looks to back up his impressive display at Old Trafford in the series decider against South Africa Sam Curran made a vital 35 off 18 balls against South Africa in the second ODI He also took the key wicket of David Miller as the Proteas slumped to 83 all out The all-rounder scored his maiden first class hundred earlier this season Surrey’s Curran said his goal is to play ‘all three formats for England’ By Richard Gibson For The Mail On Sunday Published: 17:30 EDT, 23 July 2022 | Updated: 18:42 EDT, 23 July 2022 --> --> --> Sam Curran will get a further chance today to show he can fill the void created by Ben Stokes’s one-day international retirement as England attempt to complete a come-from-behind Royal London Series win over South Africa. Curran produced an impactful performance in the first match of the post-Stokes era at Emirates Old Trafford on Friday night, cracking 35 off 18 deliveries to resuscitate an England innings that had slipped to 101 for six. Then, having transformed the direction of the contest in Manchester with the bat, he effectively settled its outcome with ball in hand when he dismissed the dangerous David Miller to leave the Proteas 27 for five chasing 202 — thus setting up Sunday’s decider at Headingley. Sam Curran scored his maiden first class hundred for Surrey earlier this summer ‘I’ve always looked up to Stokesy as a cricketer. I almost want to try to copy him. He’s obviously a huge loss and the boys are going to miss him,’ Curran said. ‘I’ve always tried to follow the way he trains and the way he plays. Obviously he’s retired from one-day cricket now but he’ll go down as one of the greats for England. ‘I try to be positive. That’s the message Jos has given to me and the team. The situation we were in, we didn’t want to scrape a target of 145 to 150.’ Like his fellow left-hander Stokes, the 24-year-old is capable of turning matches on their head via aggressive batting, and buoyed by his maiden first-class hundred against Kent last month he blitzed the South African spinners with an aerial assault including three sixes. Curran described the fact he had not previously reached three figures as ‘annoying’ but hopes to push his claims for promotion in England’s line-ups by producing more man- of-the-match contributions. The all-rounder played a vital cameo of 35 off 18 in the second ODI against South Africa ‘For Surrey, I have batted up the order, which has made me think as a batsman. I like to try to read situations well. Guys like Moeen Ali and Stokesy who have batted in that middle-order for so long — I like chatting to them about options and when to take risks. They are the kind of areas I’m working on,’ he said. Curran’s all-round versatility has made him an attractive proposition to Twenty20 franchises but he made it clear that events like the money-spinning new league in South Africa next January fall way behind international cricket in his list of priorities. ‘There is so much cricket. My goal is to play all three formats for England. That’s been my dream since I was a kid. There is no better feeling than winning games for your country,’ he said, adding that he hopes to win a 25th Test cap in the near future too, having recovered from a stress fracture of the back. ‘I loved the way the guys played against New Zealand. Loved watching that. And hopefully, touch wood, my body is holding up OK getting through these 50-over games. He also played an important role with the ball by dismissing the dangerous David Miller ‘I was managed very carefully, which I’m pleased about, because it was my first big injury. But the next step will be four-day cricket and bowling 20 overs in a day.’ Heinrich Klaasen’s pernickety, delaying tactics in the drizzle on Friday night — the bid to waste time and therefore force a no-result by restricting the second innings to fewer than 20 overs simply led to an eight-minute delay while covering was secured behind the bowler’s arm — incensed the England team and added piquancy to today’s finale. ‘They have a bit of niggle and we have a bit of niggle as well. So, we look forward to clashing again,’ Curran said. England are likely to retain the same line-up as they look to win a first series under Jos Buttler’s white-ball stewardship, with their alternative options in the bowling department reduced by a toe injury to Brydon Carse.

England and South Africa will lock horns in a series-decider third ODI in Leeds tomorrow. Having hosted a Test match as recent as last month, Headingley will be hosting an ODI after more than three years. England, who had played the last of their 33 Leeds ODIs during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, have won 21 and lost 11 matches here over the years. South Africa, on the other hand, have lost all their four ODIs at this venue. Set to play an ODI at Headingley after half-a-decade, the Proteas would look to make amends by beating England for the first time in the fourth attempt here. Headingley Leeds ODI records Highest ODI run-scorers at Headingley are Eoin Morgan (477), Joe Root (421), Marcus Trescothick (408), Andrew Strauss (335) and Ben Stokes (271).

The only other 300 or 300+ ODI run-chase in Leeds belongs to hosts England, who had sealed a 300-run target in the penultimate over against Australia seven years ago.

Starting the all-format tour with a comprehensive 62-run victory in the first ODI, South Africa were humbled during the second one-dayer in Manchester, receiving a 118-run drubbing from England, to level the three-match series 1-1. The lip-smacking series decider would now take place at the Headingley in Leeds tomorrow, with England expected to give it their all to avoid their second consecutive ODI series loss at home this summer. As for the Proteas, they would have to pull their socks up right away, after their ordinary batting effort during the second ODI saw them register their joint-second-worst total (83) in the format. South Africa would again bank on their top-order comprising Janneman Malan, Rassie van der Dussen, and Aiden Markram later. A lot is also expected from the experience of Quinton de Kock – the only batter to have looked pale in both the ODIs. On to Leeds for the decider 🙌 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 #ENGvSA 🇿🇦 pic.twitter.com/sBdvdprawK — England Cricket (@englandcricket) July 22, 2022 The venue is set to host its first One-day international match since the 2019 ICC World Cup, when India defeated Sri Lanka by 7 wickets during the round-robin fixtures. The surface at the Headingley is expected to assist the batters throughout the duration of the match. Having said that, the fast bowlers are likely to extract some decent bounce and pace off the deck, especially with the new ball in hand. Traditionally, the batters have not had the best of times at this venue, with the average first innings total here in the format being 233. However, a fresh pitch is likely to turn out to be a batting friendly one, with the captain winning the Toss likely to prefer to chase the total down.","pubDate":"2022-07-23 16:23:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"VIDEO: फैमली के साथ बेहद खूबसूरत जगह पर छुट्टियां मना रहे हैं Faf du Plessis, वाइफ ने शेयर किया वीडियो","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/faf-du-plessis-wife-imari-shared-video-caption-he-made-my-dreams-come-true-2175003","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Faf du Plessis VIDEO:</strong> दक्षिण अफ्रीका के दिग्गज खिलाड़ी फाफ डु प्लेसिस का इंटरनेशनल रिकॉर्ड शानदार रहा है. वे आईपीएल 2022 के बाद से क्रिकेट के मैदान से दूर चल रहे हैं. डुप्लेसिस ने इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग में भी शानदार प्रदर्शन किया है. डु प्लेसिस फिलहाल परिवार के साथ छुट्टियां मना रहे हैं. उनकी वाइफ इमारी ने सोशल मीडिया पर तस्वीरें और वीडियो शेयर किया है, जिसमें वे इन्जॉय करते नजर आ रहे हैं.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">डु प्लेसिस ने इमारी विसेर से लंबे समय तक रिलेशन में रहने के बाद शादी की थी. अब दोनों के बच्चे भी हैं. डु प्लेसिस छुट्टियों में परिवार के साथ घूमने निकल जाते हैं. इस बार वे इटली में घूम रहे हैं. डु प्लेसिस की वाइफ इमारी ने सोशल मीडिया पर कुछ वीडियो और तस्वीरें शेयर की हैं.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">गौरतलब है कि डु प्लेसिस ने 143 वनडे मैचों में 5507 रन &nbsp;बनाए हैं. इस दौरान उन्होंने 12 शतक और 35 अर्धशतक लगाए हैं. उन्होंने 69 टेस्ट मुकाबलों में 4163 रन बनाए हैं. इस दौरान उन्होंने 10 शतक और 21 अर्धशतक लगाए हैं. अगर इंटरनेशनल टी20 मैचों की बात करें तो डु प्लेसिस इस फॉर्मेट में 1528 रन बना चुके हैं.</p> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF;

The third ODI of South Africa’s tour of England 2022 will be played in Leeds tomorrow. A series-decider fixture will be followed by a three-match T20I series and a three-match Test series before the culmination of this English summer. With both the teams comprehensively winning matches while defending a total in this series, expect captains wanting to do the same on a Sunday morning as well. Unlike the first two ODIs, this match will be a day affair catering to the sub-continent audiences. Set to clash with Sri Lanka vs Pakistan Test and West Indies vs India ODI, cricket fans across the world have a lot to look forward to on July 24. A potential similarity between the second and third ODIs could be rain playing spoilsport. While the second match in Manchester was reduced to a 29-over affair yesterday, the same appears to be a possibility for tomorrow as well. RIP the British Heatwave 🥲 July 17th 2022 – July 19th 2022 #ENGvSA pic.twitter.com/T9K9bpaq2R — England’s Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) July 22, 2022 An otherwise cool and pleasant day in Leeds comprises of plentiful chances of rainfall leaving a mark to the extent that players might have to face delays. Going by the weather prediction of AccuWeather, rain probability at Headingley will remain around 50% for most part of the day much like Galle . No significant reduction in the rain probability doesn’t augur well for an uninterrupted 100-over contest.

SportScotland commissioned an investigation last year following allegations of racism and discrimination made by Scotland's all-time wicket-taker Majid Haq.  Haq played for his country more than 200 times, yet never again after he was sent home from the World Cup in 2015.  \"As an ethnic minority cricketer, you need to perform twice as well as a white counterpart to get the same opportunities,\" he stressed to BBC Scotland in November 2021. After Haq's complaints, the review was then carried out by Plan4sport, who are equality and diversity specialists, with a number of allegations then passed on to Scottish police. In April, an interim report revealed how over 200 people had given evidence.  Read more ‘I have nothing to hide’: Ex-England captain denies making ‘too many of you lot’ remark to Asians amid huge cricket racism scandal While local governing body Cricket Scotland has yet to lay eyes on the final report and was also unwilling to speculate on its findings, it has already offered an apology to anyone that has suffered racism across the sport. \"Cricket should be a welcoming place for everyone and not somewhere that racism or any form of discrimination takes place,\" said a spokesperson from the body. \"The Cricket Scotland Board is truly sorry to everyone who has experienced racism in cricket in Scotland. \"We would like to sincerely thank everyone who has been involved in contributing to the review, however the board is not in a position to comment on the independent review's report as we will not see it until it is published publicly on Monday,\" the spokesperson concluded, while vowing that Cricket Scotland would implement any changes or recommendations made in the review.

Powar expressed his wish to make the team meet Sindhu and Chopra if they find time at the Games Village to learn what makes the duo high-performing achievers in their own disciplines. \"Quite honestly, if there is an opportunity, we all would like to meet P.V. Sindhu and Neeraj Chopra. Both of them have set the bar high, I would love to go into their minds. I am curious about their preparation, and the way they handle the pressure of the expectations of billion people, it is commendable. We as a group would like to exchange some notes with these two top-class athletes.\" The prospect of playing in the Commonwealth Games will be a new experience for Harmanpreet & Co., starting off with walking with the whole Indian contingent in the opening ceremony, interacting with athletes from other disciplines and if possible, participating in the closing ceremony too. Harmanpreet has already started to imagine what it would be to feel the Games environment in reality. \"As we speak, I actually feel as if I am walking on that road (at the opening ceremony). This time, we are going to be a part of the multi-sport event, it is not only about cricket, but there would also be other sports as well. We want to celebrate each and every medal we will win, we all are very excited. We all are looking forward and we cannot wait to be part of this great event.\" India will be going into the Commonwealth Games on the back of a 2-1 series win against Sri Lanka. At Edgbaston, the host of women's T20 event, India are in Group A along with Australia, Pakistan and Barbados. India will kick off their Group A campaign against Australia on July 29 and need to secure at least two wins to get into knockouts for the medal matches. \"We all as cricketers and myself, have watched the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, where we see our nation's flag flying high. It is a kind of opportunity for all of us to showcase good performance, give our best and make the country proud. This is one of the competitions where you feel that you should put up a good show to give some enjoyment back to the country and make them feel proud about yourself,\" stated Powar. A couple of days ago, England captain Heather Knight had said that the women's T20 event at Commonwealth Games could prove to be a game changer for women's cricket. Harmanpreet, too, agrees with the same, especially with cricket pushing for a spot in the Olympics. \"Yes, because as a cricketer we are always wishing to play more cricket and this year, we are getting participation in a multi-sport event. I think that whenever you go to an event, it becomes very important to perform well and to show the capabilities of your team. In the future, if we get to participate in tournaments like this, definitely it is going to be very good for women's cricket.\" The talk about cricket's inclusion in the Olympics in the future will surely loom around. But for now, India's focus is on the Commonwealth Games, where they would be soaking in the environment of a multi-game event and get inspired by various athletes to clinch a historic medal in women's T20 cricket.","pubDate":"2022-07-23 15:06:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs WI 2nd ODI: Dhawan वर्ल्ड रिकॉर्ड बनाने से दो कदम दूर, अय्यर के नाम दर्ज हो सकती है खास उपलब्धि","link":"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-wi-2nd-odi-shikhar-dhawan-shreyas-iyer-have-chance-to-make-history-of-fours-port-of-spain-trinidad-2174964","keywords":null,"creator":["ABP Live"],"video_url":null,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan Shreyas Iyer IND vs WI 2nd ODI:</strong> टीम इंडिया और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच वनडे सीरीज का दूसरा मैच रविवार को खेला जाएगा. इस मुकाबले में शिखर धवन और श्रेयस अय्यर अपने नाम एक खास उपलब्धि कर सकते हैं. धवन के पास वनडे करियर में 800 चौके पूरे करने का मौका है. जबकि अय्यर 100 चौके पूरे कर सकते &nbsp;हैं. धवन ने पहले वनडे में शानदार प्रदर्शन करते हुए 97 रन बनाए थे. जबकि अय्यर ने अर्धशतक जड़ा था.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">धवन ने वनडे सीरीज के पहले मैच में 99 गेंदों का सामना करते हुए 97 रन बनाए थे. इस दौरान उन्होंने 10 चौके और 3 छक्के लगाए थे. धवन वनडे फॉर्मेट में 798 चौके लगा चुके हैं. इस दौरान उन्होंने 153 मैचों में 6422 रन बनाए हैं. धवन के पास अब 800 चौके पूरे करने का मौका है. अगर वे वेस्टइंडीज के खिलाफ दूसरे वनडे में दो चौके लगा देते हैं तो वे खास उपलब्धि हासिल कर सकते हैं.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">अय्यर वेस्टइंडीज के खिलाफ पहले वनडे में नंबर 3 पर बैटिंग करने आए थे. इस दौरान उन्होंने 57 गेंदों का सामना करते हुए 54 रन बनाए. अय्यर की इस पारी में 5 चौके और 2 छक्के शामिल रहे. अब उनके पास वनडे मैचों में 100 चौके पूरे करने का मौका है. अगर अय्यर दूसरे वनडे में दो चौके लगा देते हैं तो वे यह खास उपलब्धि हासिल कर लेंगे. उन्होंने 28 वनडे मुकाबले में 98 चौके लगाए हैं.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>यह भी पढ़ें : <a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/harmanpreet-kaur-says-about-debut-in-commonwealth-games-2022-indian-women-team-2174957\">Commonwealth Games 2022 में डेब्यू पर हरमनप्रीत कौर ने दी प्रतिक्रिया, Team India को लेकर कही यह बात</a></strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.abplive.com/sports/cricket/shreyas-iyer-says-about-dance-during-first-odi-against-west-indies-mohammed-siraj-2174881\"><strong>IND vs WI: Shreyas Iyer ने बताया मैदान पर क्यों करने लगे थे डांस, वीडियो में सिराज ने बताया मैच का खास प्लान</strong></a></p>","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-23 15:00:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"abplive","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Highest 6th wicket partnership: Highest partnership in first class cricket sixth wicket full list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-highest-6th-wicket-partnership-highest-partnership-in-first-class-cricket-sixth-wicket-full-list/","keywords":["Cricket","Chris Cooke","County Championship 2022","Glamorgan","Leicestershire","Sam Northeast"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Highest 6th wicket partnership in first-class cricket: The Glamorgan-duo have made it to the record books on the back of a mammoth stand.

You've got the EPL, La Liga, the German league, the South America Copa America. In the future it's going to be like that, you'll have one World Cup, the big one and then the rest of it will be all different leagues happening around the world,\" said Shastri. Adding to the way he wants the Test format, Shastri insisted that the format wouldn't be limited to only six sides, but teams will have to qualify for being part of the top six to be able to play the format. As per current rankings, the top six ranked teams in Test cricket are Australia, India, South Africa, England, New Zealand and Pakistan. As per Shastri's proposal, teams such as West Indies, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka would miss out on playing Tests, so as do Afghanistan and Ireland, which aren't on the Test rankings yet. \"Whether it's India, Australia, or England you have to qualify for red-ball series if you want to be around to play Test match cricket. Then it doesn't matter if England doesn't go to the West Indies, or West Indies come to England. If they're in the top six, they play, but if they're not in the top six they don't play.\" In complete contrast to Shastri's views, West Indies beat England 1-0 in a three-match series in March while Sri Lanka recently drew their two-match Test series against Australia 1-1. When asked if he would be pleased with keeping Test cricket to just six teams, Shastri, the former India all-rounder, replied in the affirmative.

An average of 23.53 runs per stick. If Wasim Akram thought his staggering numbers were enough to express an opinion on the 50-over format of the sport, he now knows he was dead wrong. He has been hung, drawn and quartered this week on social media for having the temerity to suggest the ICC (International Cricket Council) scraps One-Day Internationals (ODIs) as they have outlived their usefulness. His exact words in response to the existential question on the format were, “I think so (ODIs should be scrapped). In England you have full houses. In India, Pakistan especially, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, one-day cricket, you are not going to fill the stadiums.” Leaving Akram’s opinion aside for a moment, let’s look at the facts behind that statement. A research piece written by Abhinav Sacheti, Ian Gregory-Smith and David Patona in 2015 tracked ODI attendance between 1980 and 2015 in Australia and England, two nations where percentage stadium attendances in any case far surpass those in other nations, particularly for Test and ODI cricket. Their findings were that there had been a steady deterioration in attendance numbers in Australia across all ODI matches regardless of opposition. In England, the data was skewed by high attendance at matches involving the host and a top team, while matches against lower ranked sides were poorly attended. They concluded the paper with a warning that with the rising popularity of T20s, the authorities needed to do something different if they wanted ODIs to survive. In 2018, a Sydney Morning Herald report on attendance during the season talked about the declining numbers in the ODI series against South Africa, which had gone from 24,342 to 17,680 and 5,500 over the course of a week or so. It concluded with a telling comment, “One-day internationals, predominantly outside of the World Cup, have long lost the lustre they once had.” Seven years after the research report, the shortest format has skyrocketed in popularity beyond anything we could have envisaged then. The recent action of Cricket South Africa (CSA) in effectively jeopardising its chance of qualifying for the 2023 ODI World Cup by cancelling a bilateral series in Australia that could have gained it vital points, in order to support its new T20 domestic league , is proof positive that the warning of the authors of the 2015 paper and the conclusion in the 2018 Sydney Morning Herald article, have come to roost. One can indeed argue that cricket today is ‘consumed’ differently and online streaming and television numbers are more meaningful than bums filling stadium seats. A comparison between the two most recent World Cups across different formats - events that attract far more interest than bilateral matches - shows that the trend is not different. The previous T20 World Cup (2021) gathered 167 million television viewers over 112 billion telecast minutes. Video views over all digital channels numbered a staggering 4.3 billion. The 2019 ODI World Cup, the most watched in history thanks to the meteoric rise of digital media over the past few years, gathered 101 million television viewers and 3.6 billion digital channel hits. Akram’s next comment in justification of his opinion is equally deserving of discussion rather than the derision it has drawn. “They are doing it just for the sake of doing it. After the first 10 overs, it’s just ‘OK, just go [at] a run-a-ball, get a boundary, four fielders in and you get to 200, 220 in 40 overs and then have a go in the last 10 overs. Another 100. It’s kind of run-of-the-mill’.” If there is something incorrect about that statement, I haven’t noticed it yet. A few years ago I was in Sydney on work straddling a weekend. Over dinner that Friday night with my mentor and friend, veteran cricket writer Kersi Meher-Homji, I realised that the season’s first ODI traditionally played between Australia and New Zealand was slated for Sunday. Kersi and I arranged to meet that morning outside the SCG (Sydney Cricket Ground) before he proceeded to the press box and I to my designated seat. I would be lying if I said my most vivid memories of that match are Aaron Finch’s hard-hitting ton or Trent Boult’s wickets. Both happened, but what sticks in my mind is the sheer boredom of sitting on my prime seat above the sight screen watching mechanical, non-attractive cricket between the 20th and 40th overs in both innings. As a lover of the sport, brought up on the miracle at Lord’s in 1983 and the 1985 Melbourne magic of Laxman Sivaramakrishnan and Ravi Shastri, this was an alien experience. It was the first time that it struck me how meaningless ODI cricket had become. Squeezed between adrenaline-induced entertainment of the T20 format and the strategic machinations of the five-day format, one-day cricket, I realized that day in Sydney, was past its sell-by date. In the years since, the evidence has just mounted in support of that view. The just-concluded ODI at Trinidad between West Indies and India (on July 22nd) saw both teams score at an average of over six runs an over. But to Akram’s point, between overs 20 and 40, neither clocked much more than five. The bizarre concatenation of circumstances that led to the drama of the 2019 World Cup final, is perhaps the exception that proves the rule. As a writer who cares deeply about the history of the sport, I have long been convinced that the continued existence of Test cricket, whose imminent demise has been predicted for over a hundred years, is critical. Along with First-Class cricket, which is its feeder, Test cricket is the bedrock of producing technically competent cricketers. As important are the strategic lessons and resilience it demands from players. The recent resurgence in interest in the format even beyond Australia and England augurs well for the sport in general. The fact that Test cricket attracts spectator interest only when the top five to six teams in the world play each other should be no deterrent. There is in fact no logical reason why every team should play every format. I would argue that the sport can grow faster by propagating the T20 version among new cricketing nations given that cricket is competing for a slice of the overall global sporting audience. There is in fact absolute complementarity in this dual approach of preserving the purity and long-term benefits of Test cricket with the commercial benefits of T20. What it does is leave one-day cricket, at least the bilateral matches in the format, falling between the cracks. But that arguably is merely a stage in the evolution of the sport. The question is whether something can be done to turn around the format to bring interest back. As Charles Darwin, the father of the Theory of Evolution once reminded us, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Only time will tell how the ODI fares in the evolution of the species that is cricket. In the meantime, perhaps we should think twice before dismissing the views of one of the greatest to have ever played the format.

The Dutch complete a group which includes the United Arab Emirates, whom they take on on October 16, Namibia and Sri Lanka, the two sides that defeated Oranje at last year’s World Cup, with the final game on October 20. Only the top two sides from the group go through to the Super 12s. At the qualifiers, the Dutch were drawn alongside Papua New Guinea, Uganda and Hong Kong in Group B and finished unbeaten to take on the United States of America, who finished second in Group A, in the semi-final. Having beaten them by a comfortable margin of seven wickets, the win ensured their fifth World Cup appearance but could not retain the title, losing to Zimbabwe in the final. To punch in their ticket to Australia, the bowlers ran the show while the batters played their best hits. Logan van Beek, who finished as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 11 wickets in four matches, picked up his first T20 hat trick against Hong Kong and Fred Klaassen produced his career-best haul of 5/19 against Uganda. While Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza was declared the player-of-the-tournament, for his 228 runs and five wickets, there was a lingering feeling that Bas de Leede, the Dutch all-rounder, who came of age with nine wickets and a career-best 91* against the USA, narrowly missed out on the award for his all-round contributions. In the first game against Papua New Guinea itself, de Leede gave a glimpse of what was to come with an anchoring 27-ball 33 and two wickets with the ball after openers Max O’Dowd (32) and Stephan Myburgh (39) helped the Dutch get off to a rapid start to post 163-7. In response, the bowlers closed out the game in convincing fashion to bowl out PNG for 111. Two out of two The bowlers shone once again, hitting unplayable hard lengths for the Hong Kong batters, to make it two wins out of two. Logan van Beek returned figures of 4-27, which featured a hattrick, to bowl out their Asian counterparts for 116 before O’Dowd (45) and de Leede (36) knocked off the target with 40 balls and seven wickets to spare. In their last league phase game against Uganda, the Dutch registered their second-highest win margin of 97 runs as they restricted their opponents to 90-9 after posting an imposing total of 187-3, courtesy a 121-run partnership between O’Dowd (73) and Tom Cooper (81*). Klaassen, then, reduced Uganda to 22-5 with his maiden T20 five-for. In the semi-final against USA, de Leede struck an unbeaten 67-ball 91, a knock that featured nine boundaries and three sixes, to quash the American dream after the bowlers had bowled them out for 138. Paul van Meekeren and de Leede took two wickets apiece after effecting four run-outs in USA’s innings to continue their unbeaten run and qualify for this year’s World Cup. No dream It wasn’t quite a dream finish for the Dutch as they failed to defend their title losing the final against Zimbabwe as they crumbled to a 37-run loss. The hosts were bowled out for 132 on a slow, weary pitch in a spirited bowling effort from the Dutch spearheaded by van Beek’s 3-18 but Sikandar Raza, the Zimbabwean off-spinner, scythed through the Dutch middle-order to restrict them to 95. 🗞️ | Zimbabwe beats Netherlands in T20 World Cup Qualifier final. Read our recap ⬇️ https://t.co/yeBxPLMI8F #T20WCQualifier #T20WorldCup #ZIMvNED #CricketNL — Cricket🏏Netherlands (@KNCBcricket) July 17, 2022 ‘We got what we came here for in qualifying for the World Cup, it’s just a little bit disappointing that we couldn’t perform in the final,’ Netherlands captain Scott Edwards said. ‘Really proud of the way the boys went about it, couldn’t have asked for more. Each group (at the World Cup) has its challenges so we’ll prepare for Australia and the teams we are playing against and see how we go.’ Summer of cricket The qualification was especially significant given that the Dutch had not played a single T20I since their premature World Cup exit after three successive losses in the UAE but were battle-hardened after One-Day Internationals against full members like New Zealand, West Indies and England lately. For van Beek, it was a ‘nice reward after a tough two-month toil against the bigger nations’. The Netherlands’ summer of cricket continues with two T20Is against New Zealand in The Hague on August 4th and 5th with three ODIs against Pakistan to follow in Rotterdam from August 16 to 21. Head coach Ryan Campbell is expected to return to coaching after his recovery from a heart attack.
