Suryakumar Yadav, Axar Patel and Shivam Mavi, who batted for the Indian team in this match, chased down the target and gave Sri Lanka a scare. The match was held at a cricket ground in Pune. India won the toss and chose to bowl. Batting first, Sri Lanka scored 206 runs. India chased down the target of 207 runs to win. Ishan Kishan and Subman Gill also opened the innings for India. Ishan Kishan, Gill, Rahul Tripathi and skipper Hardik Pandya lost their wickets before the end of the Powerplay overs. Deepak Hooda also got out for 9 runs. India lost 5 wickets for 57 runs. Then Akshar Patel came into the field. He put on a partnership of 91 runs with Suryakumar Yadav. Both crossed the half-century. Suryakumar was out on 51 runs.

Mendis scored 52 runs off 31 balls. After that, Indian spinners Akshar Patel and Sahal bowled tremendously and controlled the run accumulation in Sri Lanka. But it all turned upside down in the last 5 overs. Again the Sri Lankan batsmen continued to accumulate runs. After scoring 129 runs at the end of 15 overs, the team scored 77 runs off the last 30 balls. The reason for this is that the Indian fast bowlers bowled without control. They also bowled a no-ball and teased the audience. The Sri Lankan captain scored 56 runs off 22 balls. Asalanga scored 37 runs off 19 balls.

Pakistan is the original host of the Asia Cup this year but the BCCI is not keen on playing there owing to political tension between the two countries. The then Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja had opposed the BCCI‚Äôs stand and even threatened boycott of the 50-over World Cup in India. But following a change of guard in the PCB, with Raja being replaced by Najam Sethi, there could be some positive development. The Asia Cup 2023 will be a six-team affair involving India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and a qualifier team. Sri Lanka are the defending Asia Cup champions in the UAE after they beat Pakistan in the final. The tournament was played in T20 format because of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup in Australia. With India set to host the ODI World Cup later this year and the focus of all the participating teams being on the 50-over format, this year‚Äôs Asia Cup will be held in that format. BCCI secretary and ACC president Jay Shah, while releasing the calendar for the next two years said the schedule ‚Äúsignals our unparalleled efforts and passion to take this game to new heights. With cricketers across countries gearing up for spectacular performances, it promises to be a good time for cricket.‚Äù A total of 145 ODI and T20I matches will be played during the two-year cycle (between 2023-2024) announced by ACC. There will be 75 games in 2023 and 70 games in 2024. Also, the Emerging (U23) Asia Cup is back and will be held in the 50-over format in July this year for men and involve eight teams. The tournament next year will be held in December but in T20 format.

We often hear that today's players say, things aren't in our control. Not bowling no ball is in your control. What happens after you deliver the ball, what the batsman does, is another thing. Not bowling a no ball is definitely in your control,\" Gavaskar said during his commentary. Microblogging site Twitter too has been flooded with plethora of reactions from netizens. Few strongly rebuked the faster but majority was seen igniting a laughter burst with rib-tickling memes. #INDvsSL #NoballIt's okay Arshdeep...not your day pic.twitter.com/ArzHmLKyTZ ‚Äî Sultaan Khan (@IamSultaan) January 5, 2023 Jethalal ready to replace arshdeep # no ball #INDvSL # noball pic.twitter.com/wA8tnXFGgQ ‚Äî Mohammad Faizan (@Mohamma45712868) January 5, 2023 #NoBall zaher do bhaiyaa koiüòÇüòÇArshdeep Singh creates an unwanted record‚úåÔ∏è#INDvsSL#arshdeepsingh #cricketuniverse pic.twitter.com/9sAfGZLHq3 ‚Äî ùìöùì≤ùìΩùìΩùìæùìæ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ôï (@queenkritika21) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep bowling no bowl again and againICT: pic.twitter.com/qyXCRrLxig ‚Äî Devansh Arora (@savagelaunda_18) January 5, 2023 Chad Arshdeep pic.twitter.com/Df60ykCX3q ‚Äî memes_hallabol (@memes_hallabol) January 5, 2023 #INDvSL #ArshdeepSingh #noballBumrah watching Arshdeep : pic.twitter.com/sBbRsID3n2 ‚Äî g0v!ntilde;D $#@reg;mA (@rishu_1809) January 5, 2023 #INDvSL #noball5 no balls by Arshdeep Singh pic.twitter.com/ICMPxZxAgt ‚Äî JaaduÓ®Ä (@_jaadu_) January 5, 2023 Jethalal ready to replace Arshdeep Singh for next match üí™üèª#INDvSL #Noball #HardikPandya pic.twitter.com/u5WkjME20Y ‚Äî Thalapathy Vijay (Fans club) (@Abhinav79910314) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep Today's Bowling.. pic.twitter.com/vaqnvWlvLN ‚Äî Prof cheems ‡•ê (@Prof_Cheems) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep Singh needs these shoes please üòå#INDvSL pic.twitter.com/OcpRM2BMrC ‚Äî Abhijeet ‚ôû (@TheYorkerBall) January 5, 2023 Hardik Pandya when arshdeep Bowl legal delivery . #INDvSL #INDvsSL #Arshdeep . pic.twitter.com/efDsU3gqMV ‚Äî memewala (@LakshyaTandon5) January 5, 2023 #ArshdeepSingh#INDvSL#INDvSLMeanwhile Arshdeep Today : pic.twitter.com/DzOx4qDKtC ‚Äî ‡≤¶‡≥ä‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≥Ü ‡≤¨‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤Ø‡≤æ‡≤®‡≤ø (@SreeDharaNEL) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep before coming to bowl today#INDvSL pic.twitter.com/upkTeGWmF5 ‚Äî Azfaar // Emiliano stanüêê (@VK18point5) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep singh üòÇ #INDvSL pic.twitter.com/GbJ51gdnDX ‚Äî Anurag Chaturvedi (@anuragchturvedi) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep singh if no ball was an Olympic sport#INDvSL pic.twitter.com/RcmIICHGeS ‚Äî Muhammad Arun Singh Anthony (@ArunTuThikHoGya) January 5, 2023 Arshdeep singh.#INDvSL pic.twitter.com/GlWFsW6OGu ‚Äî Dipressssh (@Dipessssh) January 5, 2023","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-01-05 15:31:28","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2023/1/2023_1$largeimg_1644394054.jpeg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Adelaide Strikers complete record run chase to beat Hobart Hurricanes","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2023/01/05/cricket-adelaide-strikers-complete-record-run-chase-to-beat-hobart-hurricanes","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - The Adelaide Strikers completed the highest successful run chase in Big Bash League (BBL) history when they chased down a mammoth target of 230 to beat the Hobart Hurricanes by seven wickets in Adelaide on Thursday.

The left-arm seamer, who replaced Harshal Patel in the XI today, finishes with 37 runs from two overs including five no-balls.

Shanaka smashes the hat-trick ball over his head for a four, before collecting a six the very next ball, getting a thick outside edge off an attempted pull that sends the ball sailing over fine leg.

Had had been dealing in sixes so far, having collected four of them so far including two back-to-back maximums off Yuzi Chahal, and had narrowly beaten a leaping Gill at cow corner earlier in Malik's third over. He attempts to go big in the same direction in the penultimate delivery, but doesn't quite get the distance this time and ends up offering the simplest of catches to Gill. SL 138/5Asalanka c Gill b Malik 37(19)20:08 (IST)Sri Lanka vs India Live ScoreOUT! A second wicket for Axar Patel in as many overs.

Charith Asalanka, meanwhile, smashes the ball over long on in the second ball of his over to bring up the century for the visitors. Three singles collected after the six. Before this over, Sri Lanka had collected 18 in the last four overs, the Indians mounting a fight back in the middle overs.20:00 (IST)IND vs SL 2nd T20I Live ScoreSIX! Cool as a cucumber, is Charith Asalanka as he nonchalantaly smashes the ball over long on, the ball landing several rows beyond the fence, as the 100 comes up for the Sri Lankans. SL 104/319:56 (IST)IND vs SL Live ScoreOUT! Both Lankan openers are back in the dugout now! Nissanka, who had been dropped on 31 by Chahal in the previous over, adds just two more runs before debutant Tripathi pulls off a superb catch at deep midwicket running to his left. The TV Umpire has a quick look after it is referred to him by his on-field colleagues, and the replay leaves little room for doubt. SL 96/3Nissanka c Tripathi b Axar 33(35)19:53 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka 2nd T20I Live ScoreAfter 10 overs,Sri Lanka 89/2 ( Pathum Nissanka 29 , Charith Asalanka 1)The fiery start by Mendis and Nissanka has ensured Sri Lanka are on course for a massive score even if they have lost two wickets in quick succession. Nissanka smashes a 148kmph bolt from Malik straight down the ground to give the Men in Blue a reminder of the threat that he still poses to them.19:45 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka LIVE Cricket ScoreBOWLED EM! The Indians are finally starting to fight back after getting plundered for runs so far. Rajapaksa follows Mendis back to the pavilion shortly after his arrival at the crease, getting beaten by Malik's pace as the ball rattles the stumps. The crowd has discovered its voice again after being quiet for the most part so far. The players will have a drink after this dismissal. SL 83/2Rajapaksa b Malik 2(3)19:41 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka Live ScoreOUT! Yuzi Chahal with the breakthrough as Kusal Mendis is trapped leg-before shortly after bringing up his half-century. The umpire however, had initially turned it down, and the legspinner looked absolutely convinced while urging Pandya to take this upstairs. He stands vindicated in the end as the Indians get three reds on HawkEye. End of a superb knock from the Sri Lankan vice-captain, giving the visitors just the start that they were looking for in this must-win clash.

Kusal Mendis brings up his half-century ‚Äî his 11th in T20Is ‚Äî in style, slashing hard at a length ball outside off, the ball sailing over the man standing in front of the third man boundary. What a knock this has been from the Sri Lankan keeper-batter, consuming just 27 balls to bring up the milestone, smashing four sixes and two fours along the way. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, are motoring along at 10-an-over at the moment and will fancy posting a score in excess of 200.19:31 (IST)Sri Lanka vs India Live ScoreMendis gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps the ball into the stands beyond deep midwicket!

After Arshdeep's nighmarish nine-ball over, skipper Pandya gets hit for a six over third man in the second delivery of his second over, which costs the Indians 11 runs. Shivam Mavi, the hero at Wankhede with 4/22 on debut, is also guilty of bowling a no-ball, starting off with a 15-run over as the Sri Lankan opening pair collect 47 in just four overs.19:21 (IST)IND vs SL Live ScoreAfter 2 overs,Sri Lanka 21/0 ( Pathum Nissanka 6 , Kusal Mendis (W) 11)Arshdeep is off to a forgettable start in his first over since the tour of New Zealand, conceding 19 runs including a hat-trick of no-balls. Not only does he concede a boundary first ball, but he ends up conceding a four and a six in each of the first two free hits, getting a stern look from his captain and in all likelihood, getting taken off the attack for now.19:07 (IST)India vs Sri Lanka 2nd T20I Live ScoreArshdeep concedes a four off his first ball of the series, as Nissanka leans in and crisply drives the ball through the gap between midwicket and mid on to collect the first boundary of the innings.

Star all-rounder Sikandar Raza - who is in the running for the ICC Men's Cricketer of the Year, ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Year awards - will not feature in the T20Is against Ireland after Zimbabwe Cricket granted him the permission to play franchise cricket elsewhere.

The incident, which took place on 29 December, had a huge impact on Hogan‚Äôs reputation making the anchor lose her place at the studio desk.Hogan came up with the bizarre gig following a recent TikTok trend. The platform was seeing a number of hilarious videos in which children and teenagers were pulling out hilarious pranks on their parents by telling them that their favourite celebrities were dead even though the news was entirely fake.After talking about the TikTok segment, fellow host Mark Beretta had just started to introduce their next news item featuring an exclusive interview with former pacer McGrath when Hogan blurted out, ‚ÄúGlenn McGrath died.‚ÄùNo doubt, the remark did not go down well with Beretta as well as the other co-host Edwina Bartholomew. While Hogan kept laughing, Bartholomew hurriedly rubbished the comment by saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny.‚Äù Beretta also opposed it and noted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy. I did not get that at all.‚ÄùWatch:Viewers slammed new Sunrise host Mylee Hogan for joking cricketer Glenn McGrath died after a segment on TikTok fad where people are told a famous person has died. Just before he appeared on Sunrise.Well Mylee, your granddad turned into an imbecile ‚Äì clearly, it‚Äôs genetic. ü§® pic.twitter.com/oeyHKX8qUS‚Äî üá¶üá∫üá≥üáø ‚ôÄÔ∏èEmma ‚ôÄÔ∏è üá≠üá∫üá¨üáß (@TheCynicalHun) December 30, 2022 Hogan remained silent till the end as the remaining hosts continued with their interview of the Australian cricketer. During the conversation, McGrath gave his insights about the recently finished Boxing Day Test between Australia and South Africa. It was the second Test of the three-match series played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the match, the hosts clinched the victory by an innings and 182 runs, earning an unassailable 2-0 lead.Hogan was a fresh face on the studio desk and she was introduced to the breakfast show earlier on 23 December. Since the unexpected incident garnered a lot of criticism from the viewers, she was banned from that particular show with immediate effect without any official announcement. Social media users were also left outraged and termed Hogan ‚Äúinsensitive and immature.‚ÄùOn 3 January, Monique Wright replaced Hogan as a news anchor alongside Mark Beretta with Edwina Bartholomew taking her seat at the end of the studio desk. Hogan reappeared on Sunrise on Thursday, but this time as a field reporter.Melbourne will have to wait a little longer to dethrone Sydney as Australia‚Äôs most popular city, with new government data revealing the Victorian capital experienced the steepest population decline of any other capital city during the pandemic. @MyleeHogan pic.twitter.com/JgFCU1fDsU‚Äî Sunrise (@sunriseon7) January 4, 2023 She was spotted reporting from near the Sydney Harbour Bridge and speaking about the difference in population growth between Sydney and the Victorian capital, Melbourne.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

We‚Äôll see,‚Äù Smith said.‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying it at the moment. I really can‚Äôt say how long I‚Äôll play for. I‚Äôm not sure.‚ÄúTake it one tour at a time. Just enjoy it and enjoy training and trying to get better as well.‚ÄúWhilst I‚Äôm doing that I‚Äôm happy playing. But I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll last.‚ÄùSmith has hinted on previous occasions this summer that he may not play for as long as what people might think, but on Thursday that genuine uncertainty was laid bare.The admission he may not return for another home summer is a statement that will shock cricket followers.Smith‚Äôs brilliant 104 against South Africa which propelled him past Bradman (29) for most Test hundreds and past Michael Clarke (8643) into fourth on Australia‚Äôs all-time run-scoring list with 8647 runs from just 92 Tests was living proof he is an all-time great still at the top of his game.The 33-year-old was moved by those achievements on Thursday, but records clearly aren‚Äôt a prime motivation for one of those batsmen who appears poised to bow out with plenty left in the tank.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think about that stuff a great deal but I did look up at the board just after I got a 100 and to sit third on the list of all time Australians, there‚Äôs some pretty big names there so that‚Äôs pretty cool,‚Äù Smith said.‚ÄúFourth on the run scorers list (too) ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt play for that kind of stuff but it was cool to look up and see my name amongst those great players. It was pretty special.‚ÄùWhile Australian cricket would be stunned to hear Smith may not forge on deeper into his 30s, Khawaja looks like he can defy father time longer than anyone would have expected after his many years on the outer.The King of Sydney has now scored more Test tons at the SCG than any other cricketer other than Ricky Ponting, and on Friday has the chance to add a maiden career double ton to the twin hundreds from last summer that launched his stunning renaissance.‚ÄúI mean at the moment he‚Äôs at the top of his game isn‚Äôt he. He‚Äôs scoring runs at will,‚Äù Smith said.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs batting beautifully. At the moment he‚Äôs pretty comfortable and playing really nicely.‚ÄúI guess Usman, like Davey (Warner) both can play for as long as they like and decide to hang them up when they want.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I see it at the moment. I‚Äôm not a selector obviously but both playing really well.‚ÄùFew sportspeople of any discipline can surely claim to understand the intricacies of their own games as well as Smith understands his own batting.All summer Smith has talked about the work he had poured into recalibrating his technique ‚Äì and how it had paid dividends for him this summer with a return to his best.But mid-innings on Thursday, Smith decided to temporarily revert to his old technique and did not break stride as he punished the South African attack.Smith is a genius, and one this Australian cricket team must spend the next few months desperately trying to convince to play on for a couple more years yet.‚ÄúJust to (left armer Marco) Jansen when he came around the wicket and the ball was reversing a little bit,‚Äù Smith said.‚ÄúI obviously know these conditions really well and I didn‚Äôt feel overly threatened on the outside of the bat. I went back to almost my old set-up. I was just getting back and across. I went back to leg stump and I was getting back and across and leaving myself really open just to cover the ball coming back in at me.‚ÄúIt just felt right at the time. I prefer to do it out there and be happy with it rather than get out and come back into the sheds and say, ‚Äòwhy didn‚Äôt I do that?‚Äô‚ÄùSmith believes the wicket can still break up enough for Australia to push for victory in the match, with Travis Head (70 off 59 balls) doing his best once again to supercharge the innings.Matt Renshaw (5) will resume alongside his Queensland teammate Khawaja on day three, as Australia will fight to bat long enough to give themselves the choice of not having to bat again in the game should South Africa crumble in reply.RE-LIVE ALL THE DAY TWO ACTION IN OUR BLOG BELOW5.30PM: STUMPS! RAIN CALLS PREMATURE END ONCE AGAINFor the second day running, Australia has dominated the on-field actions - but rain has had the final say.After forcing the players from the field, with Usman Khawaja just five runs shy of a maiden Test double century.Khawaja has put Australia firmly on top at 4-475 after two rain-reduced days, with his mighty knock sitting alongside Steve Smith‚Äôs stunning 30th Test ton and Travis Head‚Äôs impressive half-century.Smith‚Äôs century moved him past Don Bradman on Australia‚Äôs all-time Test century makers list, level with Matthew Hayden and with just Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting in front of him.He also notched a similar feat on the runscoring table, passing both Hayden and Michael Clarke to sit outright fourth - behind Ponting, Waugh and Allan Border.And yet, it is the rain which could yet decide the outcome of this match. Only 131 overs have been bowled from a scheduled 180 across the first two days, and more bad weather is forecast for Friday‚Äôs play.5.05PM: AND HERE COMES THE RAINYep, ok, probably a smart call to bring the players off when they did - because the heavier rain has hit the SCG.The lower areas of the SCG have cleared out, with fans retiring to the under-cover concourse, while those higher up in the stands haven‚Äôt moved far just yet.If they get back on tonight, they could be witness to a famous double century from Khawaja. But that looks a long way away right now, with rain sweeping across the ground.5PM: DRINKS! AND RAIN! WITH KHAWAJA FIVE RUNS FROM HISTORYThere‚Äôs a sprinkling of rain at the SCG, and the umpires come together and momentarily you feel as though the players are about to be dragged from the field.But instead a (slightly) early drinks break is called, and it could be so that the umpires can assess the ball and whether it needs changing after spending plenty of time on the damp SCG outfield.It didn‚Äôt appear as though Usman Khawaja was all that keen to come off, anyway. And you can understand why... he‚Äôs five runs away from a maiden Test double century.Khawaja confirms that the ball has been replaced, after going soggy, during a brief interaction with the umpires.‚ÄúThe ball‚Äôs gone soggy, but the outfield is pretty wet,‚Äù Khawaja told Fox Cricket‚ÄúI just asked them ‚Äòthey‚Äôre going to get a new ball, are they going to keep changing it‚Äô and they said yes.‚ÄùAnd then..... rain, immediately after the drinks break.Khawaja remains stranded on 195, for the time being.4.45PM: HEAD WELL CAUGHT ON BOUNDARY AFTER MIGHTY 70A very good low catch on the boundary by the substitute fielder van der Dussen, brings to an end a fantastic innings by Travis Head.70 runs off 49 balls. 8 fours and one six. Some clean, crisp hitting. Some ugly shots, others absolute beauties.But he‚Äôs pushed Australia‚Äôs total to 468 in rapid time and played the perfect foil role for Usman Khawaja as he edges towards a double century.And it brings the Covid kid himself, Matt Renshaw, to the crease. Let‚Äôs see how he gets on.4.25PM: IS HEAD ‚ÄòDECLARATION BATTING‚Äô?Could there be a declaration tonight? It seems unlikely, but with the uncertainty around the weather in the next couple of days, everything has to be on the table.Travis Head has sped along to a near run-a-ball 40, and some of his shots have been on the agricultural side of things.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a declaration shot,‚Äù suggests Mark Waugh in commentary after one particularly aggressive heave.Australia is 3-432, rain is looming around the SCG and they‚Äôre chasing quick runs.Plenty of wickets in hand, too. But what‚Äôs the play here?One thing is certain: no one is declaring with Usman Khawaja so close to a maiden Test double ton. He is currently unbeaten on 186.UPDATE: In the ten minutes since this post, Travis Head has scored 21 runs. If he isn‚Äôt declaration batting, he‚Äôs definitely giving it a shake.4.07PM: AUSSIES BRING UP 400... KHAWAJA REACHES NEW HEIGHTSIt feels like we‚Äôre repeating ourselves a bit, but Australia has passed 400 - and not for the first time this summer.Travis Head has joined the fun and immediately lifted the tempo, racing to 30 off 33. He punches a straight drive back over the head of Simon Harmer for four, to bring up the 50-run partnership with Usman Khawaja - from just 66 balls.Khawaja, meanwhile, has passed his previus Test best score of 174. He‚Äôs onto 178. A double century is the next milestone to knock off for the silky left-hander.3.50PM: COVERS COMING OFF AFTER RAIN DELAYNow is when the tea break is typically due to finish... and we‚Äôre not ready to go just yet. Because of another rain delay.However, the good news is the covers have been removed and presumably play is not too far away.The outfield has been dried by the classic rope technique for the past 10 minutes, so I reckon we‚Äôll be back to watching Usman Khawaja and Travis Head plundering runs for fun soon enough.3.30PM: TEA! AUSSIES ON TOP DESPITE SMITH EXITWith one session remaining on day two, how do you assess where this match is headed?Obviously Australia are on top. They‚Äôve got just shy of 400 runs on the board, seemingly in complete control with 27 overs remaining in the day‚Äôs play. Only rain will stop them having a 500+ lead at stumps today.But as the tea break hits us, the heaven‚Äôs have opened again (not especially heavy rain, but frustrating rain for sure). Time has already been lost this Test, and more rain is expected over the next two days.Australia are 3-394 at tea, with Usman Khawaja on 172 and Travis Head on 17 - having lost Steve Smith for 104.But will they have enough time to push this game forward and get the cleansweep?3.10PM: GREEN OPENS UP INJURY BATTLE, INDIA SERIESStar all-rounder Cameron Green has conceded he‚Äòll be ‚Äútouch and go‚Äù for Australia‚Äôs first Test in India in February having undergone surgery to fix his broken finger.But Green shut down reports he would be limited in his capacity to fulfil his massive $3.15 million Indian Premier League deal declaring rumours he wouldn‚Äôt be able to bowl as ‚Äúnot correct‚Äù.Green was forced to have surgery after scans revealed the bad break to the index finger on his right hand, suffered while batting in the first innings of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.Images of the break reinforced how significant an effort it was for Green to make an unbeaten 51 in the second innings, batting through the pain.It came just days after his massive IPL windfall but Green said his priority was getting back for the Test tour of India in February, although he conceded both he and fats bowler Mitchell Starc, who also broke a finger, would be racing the clock to be fit.‚ÄúObviously my first priority is the Test Series that‚Äôs beforehand,‚Äù Green added when asked about the IPL.‚ÄúI think me and Starcy (Starc) are maybe touch and go for that first one but obviously we‚Äôll give ourselves the best chance.‚Äù2.51PM: AND OUT! SMITH FALLS AFTER POSTING TONAnd that feels like it has come out of nowhere - after bringing up his 30th century, Smith falls to a simple caught and bowled to Keshav Maharaj.He‚Äôs out for 104.It‚Äôs the first wicket of the day (and Maharaj‚Äôs first of the series), and Smith walks of shaking his head - as he always does, to be fair.2.48PM: CENTURY! STEVE SMITH BRINGS UP 30TH TONWhat a player!Steve Smith brings up his 30th Test century, having passed Matthew Hayden and Michael Clark on Australia‚Äôs all-time Test runscorers. He now only trails Ricky Ponting, Allan Border and Steve Waugh.With that century, Smith officially passes Sir Donald Bradman (29 Test centuries) on the centurion list - equal with Matthew Hayden and, again, only behind Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh.An incredible player.When he‚Äôs in a mood like this, it doesn‚Äôt ever appear like there is a way to get him out. He seems unstoppable.2.45PM: MILESTONES FALL AS AUSSIES MARCH ONThe milestones are stacking up for Australia.In the past handful of minutes Australia have brought up:- the 200-run partnership between Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith- Khawaja‚Äôs 150- Australia‚Äôs 350What‚Äôs next? Well, Steve Smith is unbeaten on 99.....2.20PM: DRINKS! SMITH, KHAWAJA CRUSH SOUTH AFRICAThe SCG is becoming a graveyard for South Africa‚Äôs bowlers - there‚Äôs nothing here for them.At the midway point in the middle session, Australia are doing their best to break whatever is left of the spirits of the Proteas.Usman Khawaja is approaching his 150, while Steve Smith is looking assured in the 90s. A 30th Test ton looks a foregone conclusion under sunny skies at the SCG.Australia are 2-334. They‚Äôre not being particularly expansive in their scoring - these two have added 187 runs for the third wicket at a rate of 3.33 an over, which is marginally better than the 3.24 across the whole Australian innings.But they‚Äôre putting Australia in a position where they may only need to bat once this Test, if they so desired.2.00PM: HOW WILL RENSHAW PERFORM AGAINST ‚ÄòSTACKED ODDS‚ÄôHas Matt Renshaw been set up to fail? Or is he setting himself up to fail?There are fears that his Test comeback could turn into a nightmare with the ‚Äúodds stacked‚Äù against the returning star, who could be playing for a spot in Australia‚Äôs squad for the upcoming India series.Renshaw tested positive for Covid after play had started on Wednesday, and was immediately isolated from the group - but not ruled out of the match.He‚Äôs still listed to bat at No.6, at which point he‚Äôll be thrown into the middle of the SCG cauldron against a world class South African pace attack - although one that is looking incresingly toothless after an unsuccessful summer.Renshaw was still testing positive on Thursday morning, but told Fox Cricket‚Äôs Mike Hussey that he‚Äôd seen improvement over the past 24 hours.But Kerry O‚ÄôKeeffe pondered what Renshaw‚Äôs return to the international arena might look like after the SCG Test.‚ÄúI think (there is expectation), yeah,‚Äù O‚ÄôKeeffe said.‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs so disadvantaged, picking up the COVID. Not many who have gone into matches with Covid have done that well.‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs hoping he can produce soemthing but gee the odds are stacked. He wouldnt have been able to do a lot if it‚Äôs a debilitating form (of COVID).‚Äù1.45PM: SMITH, KHAWAJA MARCH ON AS AUSSIES PASS 300Australia has brought up their 300 - on another sorry day for South Africa in a truly miserable summer.Usman Khawaja has already brought up his century, and Steve Smith doesn't appear far behind - accelerating at a great rate after a slow start to move into the 80s and have another SCG century of his own on the horizon.Smith has also passed Matt Hayden on the list of Australia‚Äôs Test runscorers, and is closing in on Michael Clarke, too.1.10PM: HOW UZZIE, BARTY CRACKED SPORT‚ÄôS MAGICAL CODE- ROBERT CRADDOCKUsman Khawaja‚Äôs stunning career revival is a victory for the man who decided to put his cricket in one kit bag and his life in another.It‚Äôs the same theory that turned Ash Barty from a good player to a triple Grand Slam winner.Don‚Äôt chain your self-esteem as a person to the sport you play. Don‚Äôt let your head go up and down with your batting average or your world ranking. Khawaja reckoned he worked it out late in his career after his self-esteem yo-yoed violently up and down with his performances.‚ÄúIt got to a point where even when I was scoring runs I wasn‚Äôt happy so I knew I just had to change and let it go,‚Äô‚Äô he said.Khawaja‚Äôs stunning 2022 ‚Äì when he scored 1080 runs at 67 ‚Äì and today‚Äôs epic century, only happened after he decided he couldn‚Äôt let cricket dominate his life.Khawaja these days is one of the most chilled out sportsman in the game.When a contact apologised for ringing him the day before the first Test against South Africa in Brisbane he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs no problems ‚Ä¶ whether it‚Äôs a Test match or a club game I don‚Äôt feel differently.‚Äô‚ÄôWhen Sydney friends told him after his twin tons against England at the SCG last summer they didn‚Äôt contact him before the match because they didn‚Äôt want to disturb him, replied: ‚ÄúWhy? It‚Äôs only a game of cricket.‚Äô‚Äô12.30PM: LUNCH: KHAWAJA, SMITH DOMINATE OPENING SESSIONAs it has been almost all summer, Australia has dominated that session.And even though this Test is only 83 overs old, it is start to feel as though it is moving beyond where South Africa can win.After resuming at 2-147, Australia added 118 runs in the extended opening session today, and cheered on a century to Usman Khawaja (his 13th, and third on the trot at the SCG) and a half-century to Steve Smith (who enters lunch unbeaten on 59).It‚Äôs been a near chanceless morning for Australia, with Smith almost caught short on a reflect run-out attempt but largely untroubled otherwise.Weather appears to be Australia‚Äôs biggest foe this week, with rain eating up a further 15 minutes of play earlier today - although there is blue sky over the SCG as players make their way to lunch.12.08PM: CENTURY! KHAWAJA CONTINUES SCG LOVE AFFAIRNew year, same Uzzie.Usman Khawaja has continued his SCG love affair, polishing off another century at his one-time home ground.It‚Äôs three centuries in three innings for Khawaja, who raised the bat twice in last year‚Äôs Ashes Test against England.This one has been more measured, and already looks to form the bedrock of a mighty Australian first innings total.Khawaja returned for a quick second off Rabada, before celebrating with a jig in front of his teammates in the Members Stand.12.00PM: RICHIES GO WILD OVER ICONIC SCOREThe Richies got their wish!With the score 2-221, the 100-odd-strong group donning the beige, the off-white and the ivory jackets started their chant of ‚Äúone, one, one‚Äù in the hope of getting a single that would bring up Richie Benaud‚Äôs iconic cricket scoreline of 2-222.Everyone at the SCG would‚Äôve tried on their best Benaud ‚Äòchew for chew-chew-choooo‚Äô impression after Kagiso Rabada delivered in the form of a no-ball to bring the score up.The Richies duly responded with wild celebrations.Truly, that‚Äôs marvellous.11.50AM: KHAWAJA CLOSING IN ON CENTURY, SMITH FIRES UPUsman Khawaja is officially into the 90s - and has Test century No.13 in his sights.Khawaja started 2022 in dream fashion, turning a Test recall into centuries in both innings, and it seems like he‚Äôs taking a similar approach to welcoming in the new year for 2023.Khawaja has been the aggressor in the partnership alongisde Steve Smith - although Smith has taken things up a notch since Keshav Maharaj has been introduced into the attack, aunching him into the Bill O‚ÄôReilly Stand with an audacious hoik over mid-wicket.Austraia is 2-221 with the lunch break still 40 minutes away.11.20AM: KHAWAJA KEEPS PUNISHING MAHARAJAfter being greeted to a green-top at the Gabba, and a flatter deck at the MCG, Keshav Maharaj would‚Äôve been delighted to hear whispers of a ‚Äòmysterious‚Äô SCG pitch that was expected to favour the spinners.Australia were convinced, bringing in Ashton Agar as a second-option to support frontline spinner Nathan Lyon. South Africa added a second tweaker themselves, in Simon Harmer.And it was Maharaj who had the first chance to follow the seamers into the contest.His first ball was a full-toss, which was duly punished by Usman Khawaja who thumped a rare boundary on a slow-scoring morning.24 hours on and things haven‚Äôt changed much, with Maharaj remaining wicketless for the series and Khawaja dumping him over the fence for the first six of the innings.Truth be told, Harmer appeared to trouble the Australian batsmen more yesterday than South Africa‚Äôs first-choice option.11.00AM: AUSSIES NAVIGATE OPENING HOUROne hour down of this elongated day of play - potentially offering up 98 overs - and Australia are marching along slowly.Admittedly they‚Äôve done so with a 15-minute rain delay, which has restricted Australia to just 29 runs on Thursday morning.Steve Smith is unbeaten on 9, while Usman Khawaja is creeping towards a 13th Test century.He‚Äôs into the 70s.10.40AM: LEGEND SLAMS ‚ÄòUNACCEPTABLE‚Äô RAIN CALLAustralian great Ricky Ponting has questioned why Steve Smith was forced to face a ball with the rain falling at the SCG - with umpires waiting until the end of the over to take players off the field.Smith navigated the over and remained not out as play was halted for a rain delay, but Ponting said if he‚Äôd been in the same position as Australia‚Äôs No.4 he would‚Äôve refused to face up.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why they bowled that ball then? Why do the umpires wait until the end of the over to call that? That rain is clearly heavy enough,‚Äù Ponting said on Channel 7.‚ÄúIf I was out there batting, I would‚Äôve walked away. I would‚Äôve walked a couple of steps out of the square leg and actually waited for the umpires to make a decision, because let‚Äôs say Steve Smith nicks that ball, when you shouldn‚Äôt be out there, that‚Äôs not acceptable as far as I‚Äôm concerned.‚ÄúI never get that, why they wait until the end of an over when it‚Äôs raining, to call a close in play.‚ÄùOn Wednesday night, Marnus Labuschagne was dismissed late in the day under gloomy skies - only for the umpires to immediately call a suspension of play due to bad light, without another ball being bowled.10.27AM: PLAY RESUMES.... AGAINWe‚Äôll see how long this lasts, but just the 15 minute rain delay that time. Not a huge amount of rain about to cause all that much concern for players and umpires it seems.From the early start, Australia have added 1 run - to Usman Khawaja - as they take a cautious approach to Day Two.The feedback from both camps after day one was that this is one of the most unusual SCG wickets - some describing it as the dryest they‚Äôve ever seen on day one of a Test.Who knows how it will play on days three, four and five?10.12AM: RAIN HALTS PLAY AFTER 11 MINUTESJust 11 minutes of play before Sydney‚Äôs fickle weather imposes itself on Day Two of the SCG Test - it‚Äôs fairly light rain, but enough to convince the umpires to call things off for the time being.The covers are on for about 90 seconds before being removed by the groundstaff - and then immediately replaced.It‚Äôs a very windy day in Sydney, with the clouds being blown across the city. It has the potential to be a lot of very light rain causing a lot of painful delays!But for the moment, play has been suspended.10AM: PLAY RESUMES UNDER LIGHTSPlay finished under lights last night, and that‚Äôs the case again this morning.The big lights are on, and Kagiso Rabada is charging in at Steve Smith, on the hunt for an early wicket.The fact the lights are on is a concern for players, officials and fans alike - but Australian great Steve Waugh will be pleased.He wanted the lights on yesterday and took to Instagram to make the plea.‚ÄúTest cricket needs to realise there is a lot of competition out there and not using the lights when the players are off for bad light simply doesn‚Äôt add up,‚Äù he wrote.‚ÄúLots of unhappy spectators who can‚Äôt understand the rationale and reason for no play.‚Äù9.45AM: HISTORIC STATUE UNVEILED AT SCGThe story of the morning at the SCG on Thursday isn‚Äôt Matt Renshaw‚Äôs COVID status or Marnus Labuschagne‚Äôs controversial innings yesterday - it‚Äôs the unveiling the world‚Äôs first sculpture of a female crickterer.Australian great Belinda Clark was immortalised in bronze near the Gate A entrance at the SCG, with her statue placed alongside the likes of Richie Benaud, Steve Waugh and Fred Spofforth.A sizeable crowd gathered for the unveiling, as the rain held off, for the special moment.‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to have the sculpture in place and for people to now look at it and perhaps wonder what that is, who that is and to be able to tell a bit of a story is really important,‚Äù Clark said.‚ÄúThe sculpture encapsulates being able to have a go ‚Äì to be courageous, to take on those challenges and break convention.9.30AM: SUN‚ÄôS OUT AT THE SCGGood morning and welcome from the SCG, where we are half an hour away from the early scheduled start (brought forward because of the rain yesterday, as will be the case for the rest of the Test).I have good news - it‚Äôs a sunny morning at the SCG. The rains of earlier in the day have mercifully disappeared, and the light - the light!! - is superb so far.Australia will resume on 2-147 with Usman Khawaja on 54, and Steve Smith yet to score.8.45AM: WEATHER ISSUES FACING SCG TESTIt will be a wet start to the second day of the test match against South Africa at the SCG today with 1-2mm of rain predicted until 11am. Luckily for those watching the game it is predicted to clear up in the afternoon around midday. There is also a small chance of a thunderstorm this morning.‚ÄúIt will be cold, wet and windy,‚Äù said Helen Reid from the Bureau of Meteorology.‚ÄúUnfortunately it‚Äôs not such a good day for the cricket.‚ÄùIn good news for those out in the stands, it‚Äôs not going to be a hot one with a maximum of 22 degrees, reaching the peak around 2pm.Ms Reid said even though it will cloudy over the next three days it was important people still applied sunscreen.‚ÄúThe UV index is extreme at the moment, which it always is this time of year,‚Äù‚ÄúUmbrella‚Äôs will help as well, or maybe a UV-rated poncho.‚ÄùIt will be a windy one today, with wind speeds getting up to 59km an hour coming from the south/south west. The wind should start to die down by early evening around 5pm.7AM: THE SCG GAMBLE THAT LAUNCHED A SUPERSTAR- ROBERT CRADDOCKSodden Sydney is becoming the sink Test as well as the pink Test but for Marnus Labuschagne it‚Äôs still the ground that changed his life.This Test is the fourth anniversary of the day when selector Greg Chappell was out of options for a number three batsmen and decided to roll the dice.Already knocked back by one member of the top order, Chappell offered the high pressure role of going in early against India‚Äôs crack pace attack at the SCG to Labuschagne.The story goes that when they shook hands Labuschagne was so excited Chappell feared his arm may be pulled from the socket for it was as if he had handed the youngster the keys of a new car.When Labuschagne walked out to the wicket for his first innings against India at the SCG he was averaging just 20 after two Tests.Four years later he left the SCG, with his batting average anchored at just below 60 after a robust 79 ended when he edged a snorter off Anrich Nortje behind.Day one was a curious one for Labuschagne because it reinforced his reputation as one of the luckiest batsmen in cricket ‚Äì before he got a taste of his own medicine.He should have been out to a low slips catch which was ruled not out by the third umpire but he had the misfortune of being out last ball of the day before bad light intervened.I happened to be standing near Chappell four years ago when Labuschagne walked to the wicket and he made the following prediction.‚ÄúI honestly feel he is going to be one of our really exceptional batsmen. That zest for the contest he has wipes out so much of the fear.‚Äô‚ÄôSo it was that day. And so it is now. Labuschagne is 28 now, a father and a veteran of 32 Tests but his passion for the game, far from diminishing, seems to be growing.During the off-season Labuschagne had a two-week break from his loved ones. Not his family. His bats.He sent them back to the manufacturer to get updated stickers as he headed off to Stradbroke Island.It must have been hell for him to be ‚Äúbatless‚Äô‚Äô on the island but he survived, returned and since then its been all cricket.Sydney is normally the Test where tempers fray and backsides drag but Labuschagne has been buzzing around the nets as if it‚Äôs the first Test of the summer.Not just batting but bowling his leg-spinners. He was heard asking anyone around if they had heard what the team was on match eve, His radar for cricket information is never off.Commentator Ian Smith called it early when he said from the time Labuschagne arrived at the crease he had the look of a man who would set up a tent and stay a day.He didn‚Äôt get there as he fell to what was the last ball of the day before bad light set in on a ground which has so much rain that ground authorities sell advertising on the top of the covers.The grim conditions never worry him. His time playing garage cricket on souped up mats from Bunnings condition him to enjoy the thrill of heavy duty contests of which there are many in Test cricket.Watch Australia v South Africa.
