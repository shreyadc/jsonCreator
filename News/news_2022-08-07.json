Savita Punia’s girls will also look to put behind the disappointment of losing the hockey semi-final as they take on New Zealand in the bronze medal match. Indian shuttlers will be in action in the semi-finals in singles and doubles. While PV Sindhu & Co are favourites to progress to the finals, focus will also be on men’s doubles stars Satwiksairaj Rankireddy/Chirag Shetty and Gayatri Gopichand/Jolly Treesa. Meanwhile, Sharath Kamal will be looking to add two more Gold medals to his envious collection of CWG medals while the impressive Sreeja Akula will also battle for bronze in women’s singles.

Australia regularly found themselves in sticky situations against New Zealand, but as it was against India, Gardner (19 not out) and Harris (eight not out) were called on to save Australia’s bacon, coming together with 16 runs required – and leaving with the result secured.“It is nice to be tested and we knew coming into the game, and the round games here, we were going to be tested in different moments – certainly we were tonight,” said Beth Mooney, who scored a pivotal 36 before falling late and watching the tense final moments from the grandstand.“The beauty of our team and where we’re at at the moment is there’s so much belief within that dressing room that we can always get the job done no matter what it looks like and we can sometimes accept it can look pretty ugly.“But if we can scrap our way to a win, that’s the result we’re after.”The result Australia wants now is gold – and a historic victory in the maiden Commonwealth T20 tournament, to go into a very full trophy cabinet.“We always mark (the day of the final) in our diaries,” said Mooney.“We were on the side of some good luck tonight and some bad luck, but at the end of the day we get to fight for that gold medal.”Earlier, India upset host nation England by four runs with star opener Smriti Mandhana plundering a blistering 61.Metros Comm Games MT","pubDate":"2022-08-06 21:12:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Wish I had a better rig’: Aussie cult hero goes wild","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2022-latest-day-9-news-results-and-medal-tally/news-story/24bcdcba0d5186705ec2ebfc2b833f44","keywords":["Commonwealth Games","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"He may wish he has a “better rig” but what Aaron Wilson does have is back-to-back Commonwealth Games gold medals in the men’s individual lawn bowls as the man called ‘Disco’ danced his way to glory.","content":"When he claimed the win on the Gold Coast the now 30-year-old got himself into Commonwealth Games folklore as he famously celebrated his victory by ripping off his shirt. And the shirt again came off at Victoria Park in Leamington Spa as Wilson became the first man since England legend David Bryant to win back-to-back singles titles 44 years ago. So dominant was Wilson that his opponent, Gary Kelly of Northern Ireland conceded with the Australian 19-3 in the lead.And almost immediately the shirt came off as Wilson savoured another Commonwealth Games title.“I never really thought about it that way but yeah I think it was always going to happen if it went that way,” he said of the repeated celebration. “I just wish I had a better rig but oh well that’s life.“I certainly was pretty happy with my performance.”It was a dominant display by Wilson in the rink.He provided a taste of what was to come when he was able to knock the jack away from Kelly’s closest ball right at the very start of the match, and then getting closest to the jack and on the board straight away. And that was the closest Kelly ever got to Wilson, who went 12-0 before the Northern Irishman even got on the board.“Obviously he started really well, had a good tempo and to win the first end is really big start and you get momentum on your side so I was pleased,” he said. It also has him join one of the greats of the sport in Bryant.“I’ve got no words for it really, I didn’t really think about it until I was told afterwards,” he said.“But it is pretty special, 44 years (since a back-to-back) it is pretty amazing.“He is the greatest of all time, so it is really special when you think about it.“I’ve heard he was pretty special on his day and it’s pretty cool hey.”Wilson has the nickname ‘Disco’ because of his love of the nightlife as a youngster.The celebrations are bound to be large after he made history with his second Commonwealth Games gold.But they won’t be as raucous as they were previously.“I think they are all closed these days, but nah I’m a family man these days. I’ve got a little bubba Summer who is seven months old and my partner,” he said. “I’ve traded that life in for this one and I couldn’t be happier.”Metros Comm Games MTkicker1 ‘By Scott GullanKurtis Marschall has joined a select company in defending his Commonwealth Games pole vault title.The South Australian now sits alongside the man who inspired him to take up the sport, Olympic champion Steve Hooker, as vaulters to win back-to-back titles.Marschall showed his quality by producing when it matters most after an indifferent season, claiming the gold medal with a clearance of 5.60m.It’s been a big week for his coach Paul Burgess, himself a former Olympic pole vaulter, given Marschall joins training partner Nina Kennedy as Commonwealth champions.“Yes, we finally got something,” he said to Burgess as they embraced afterwards.The 25-year-old only needed three clearances to claim the victory although he did have a scare at 5.50m when he missed his opening two attempts.After managing to get it on his third he then sailed over 5.60m on his first attempt which proved to be the winning jump.England’s Adam Hague finished second on 5.55m with his countryman Harry Coppell third (5.50m).By Will SwantonThe Kookaburras have overcame a major scare to beat England and reach the gold medal match in the men’s hockey at the Commonwealth Games. Eddie Ockenden’s team had a parochial Saturday night crowd and classy England side against them and they trailed 2-0 at the University of Birmingham before roaring home for a 3-2 victory. The Kookaburras will face India for gold on Monday. They’ve won every Commonwealth gold since the sport was introduced at the 1998 Kuala Lumpur Games and the streak is a chance to stay alive.England’s Phil Roper (12th minute) and Zach Roper (19th) gave the hosts a shock lead to put an unusually flustered Australia under the pump. Blake Govers converted a 27th-minute penalty corner just before halftime to peg the deficit to 1-2 and momentarily hush a crowd that had booed the Australians when they first appeared. Jacob Anderson converted incredible skillful lead-up work to level at 2-2 in the 44th minute. Daniel Beale found the net in the 50th minute and after a length video review, it was allowed had all they needed. A lead they kept until the end. By Joe BartonYou come at the Queens, you best not miss.New Zealand fired their best shots – first with the bat, then with the ball, and finally in the field – at fierce rivals Australia in Saturday’s semi-final, only to have Ash Gardner and Grace Harris once again send the world’s most dominant cricket team into the gold medal match.Chasing 145 for a guaranteed medal, Australia were pushed as hard as they’ve been all tournament as they notched 5-145 with three balls to spare to set up a mouthwatering final against India at Edgbaston.Australia advanced to the knockout rounds undefeated, having previously only really tested in the Games’ opening fixture by India, but regularly found themselves in sticky situations against New Zealand.As it was against India, Gardner (19 not out) and Harris (eight not out) were called on to save Australia’s bacon, coming together with 16 runs required – and leaving with the result secured.By Erin SmithOne is Australia’s most successful women’s diver - the other a newbie with just one international competition to her name - but together they have won a Commonwealth Games gold medal.Watching them flip, twist and tumble off the 10m platform as one - it is hard to believe Olympian Melissa Wu and 14-year-old Charli Petrov only started diving together four months ago. Wu made the move from the individual 10m platform back to synchronised diving after sustaining a debilitating back injury while participating on SAS Australia. The duo blitzed the competition in the women’s 10m synchronised dive this morning to claim the gold medal. It is Wu’s third gold Commonwealth Games medal from five Games, and comes off the back of her first individual Olympic medal in Tokyo last year.The Games are Petrov’s first and just her second international event - at her first, the recent worlds, alongside Wu, they finished seventh. But Wu and Petrov pulled off high scoring dives, round after round. Fellow Aussie synchro pair Nikita Hains and Emily Boyd didn’t stick their second dive and with just six teams in the competition it was always going to be hard to work their way back on to the podium. The two English teams finished in second and third. 4:55AM BOXINGTina Rahimi, Australia’s first female muslim boxer, has lost her semi-final bout at the Commonwealth Games after a bruising contest with tough Nigerian Elizabeth Oshob.Rahimi fought back strongly after losing the opening round, but the judges awarded the win to the African on a split decision after landing the better shots when the pair slugged it out in the deciding third and final round.By Joe BartonAustralia have been set a target of 145 runs to reach the gold medal match at Edgbaston.New Zealand had looked on track for a threatening target, but had to settle for a ‘tricky’ one after Megan Schutt (3-20) and Tahlia McGrath (2-30) helped trigger a collapse of 5-32 in the final five overs.Veteran Sophie Devine (53 off 48) and young star Amelia Kerr (40 off 36) build the foundation of New Zealand’s total of 7-144, putting on 73 for the third wicket.But the sting went out of the batting when Devine was caught on the boundary off Jess Jonassen.Beth Mooney, who took two catches, was a star in the field and delivered a beautiful direct-hit runout on the last ball of New Zealand’s 20 overs.The winner will on Sunday face India, after they defeated England by four runs in a nailbiting finish earlier on Saturday.NETBALL POLE DANCINGFour years is a long time to wait but the Diamonds have avenged the heartbreak of the Gold Coast 2018, destroying England to secure a place in the gold medal match.Australia, criticised against Jamaica for being too predictable and lacking in defence when it mattered, dominated the four terms to win 60-51.There were bizarre scenes after just four minutes when the match was halted while a new goal post was brought on court after a freak accident involving an England defender.Layla Guscoth found herself straddling the post like a koala as she fought for the intercept just four minutes into the clash with Australia, resulting in the post being bent so out of position that a replacement was needed.“She literally straddles and lowers herself,” former Diamond Cath Cox said.“I’ve never seen that in a game!”“Extraordinary footage,” Sue Gaudion added. “We never thought we’d be paused at three-all to fix a goal post.”Guscoth was not injured in the incident, the England GD actually seeing the funny side as the moment was replayed in front of a packed out stadium.A new goalpost aside, it was an incident free performance from Australia who will play Jamaica for gold on Sunday.READ THE FULL MATCH REPORTDISCO LAWN BOWLS GOLDAaron ‘Disco’ Wilson has defended his men’s singles Commonwealth Games crown with an absolute dominant display over Northern Ireland’s Gary Kelly. Wilson was looking to become the first player to win back-to-back men’s singles title since England’s four-time gold medallist David Bryant.And the 30-year-old, who has the terrific nickname for his love of a night on the town, put on a masterclass in the rink as he danced to another Commonwealth Games gold medal in one of the most dominant performances seen in lawn bowls.A fine roll to knock the jack away and then get closer to it at the first end set the tone for Wilson’s dominance as Kelly couldn’t get close to him. He incredibly went 12-0 up before Kelly, who is based in Australia, could get on the board. And despite Kelly pulling a fine shot out of his hat the Australian did not ease up as he romped away to a 19-3 win.ENGLAND DOWNS AUSSIE IN HEAVYWEIGHT BOUTAussie heavyweight Edgardo Coumi has lost his semifinal bout against towering Englishman Lewis Williams at the Commonwealth Games.Williams - who stands 1.98m tall - used his superior height and reach to claim an unanimous points decision and advance to the gold medal fight.Coumi was awarded a bronze medal for reaching the semi-finals.‘STUFF OF LEGENDS’: HOARE’S INCREDIBLE 1500M WINAustralia’s Ollie Hoare has won an incredible 1500m final, joining the great Herb Elliott in the history books with an extraordinary last-stride victory.Kenya’s Timothy Cheruiyot looked to have the gold medal in his keeping but Hoare kept closing, getting the bob in on the line to claim the win by just .09sec.The US-based 25-year-old becomes only the second Australian to win the event, joining Elliott in winning the historic middle-distance event. (Elliott won the mile at the 1958 Games in Cardiff).Hoare won the biggest race of his career in a Commonwealth Games record of time 3min30.12sec with Cheruiyot, the 2019 world champion, second in 3:30.21, with new world champion Jake Wightman a stride away in third (3:30.53sec).READ THE FULL STORYBROWNING FALLS, AUSSIES OUT OF RELAYAustralia’s fastest man Rohan Browning stumbled and fell on the last leg of the 4 x100m relay heats, crashing the Australian team out of the final and any medal contention.The mishap occurred when Browning began his acceleration to be near top pace for when he was to receive the baton from the third runner, but he inexplicably tripped before the exchange took place.The moment was shattering for Browning who was immediately consoled by his team mate Jack Hale as he walked alongside the straight and to the finish line.Commonwealth Games: Australia were well positioned in the Men's 4x100m relay when disaster struck for the Aussie anchor Rohan Browning, as he stumbled to the track on the changeover.READ WHAT BROWNING HAD TO SAY10.35PM: PETERS NAILS SHOT AT GOLDBy Julian LindenExciting Aussie teenage boxer Callum Peters is through to the gold medal bout at the Commonwealth Games after a devastating semi-final performance.The middleweight bashed South Africa’s Simnikwe Bongco in a one-sided contest to get an unanimous decision in Birmingham.Just 19, the South Australian looked at ease in his first international tournament, where he will now face Scotland’s Sam Hickey for the gold medal on Sunday night.“Well, I’ve been fighting for a while. It was like a home fight with the family, mum and dad watching,” he said. “I can see why people get nervous, but over time, you keep doing it and you get used to it.”One of nine kids, Peters looks to have a bright future in the fight game.Crafty, and able to switch his lead hand, he’s already caught the eye of some promoters in professional boxing but has his heart on getting major silverware in the amateur ranks first.“This is my first international tournament so I’m still learning the ropes, some new events, new people, I’m very excited,” he said. “I take it one step at a time. I want to try and get to the Olympics. That’s my biggest goal, to be the first to get gold for Australia. That’d be pretty nice.”One of five Aussie boxers through to the semis — where everyone is guaranteed at least a bronze medal — Peters joined Kaye Scott in advancing to the gold medal round.The three other Aussies, Edgardo Coumi (heavyweight) Tina Rahini (featherweight) Caitlin Parker (middleweight) were due to step in the ring early Sunday morning.9.10PM: HOLOCAUST TRAUMA BEHIND EMOTIONAL GOLDAustralia’s premier race walker Jemima Montag has successfully defended her Commonwealth Games title, winning the Birmingham edition with a superb record breaking time of 42min34.30 and she crossed the line and kissed her bracelet.Montage was streets ahead of the Indian champion Priyanka and Emily Wamusyi Ngii from Kenya who won the minor medals. Other Australians walkers, Rebecca Henderson was fourth and Katie Hayward was seventh.Whenever the going gets tough for Montag, a 24 year old from Brighton, Victoria she glances down at her wrist. For her bracelet is an extra special charm from her beloved late grandmother, Judith a holocaust survivor from Auschwitz.Montag’s nana died just before the Tokyo Olympic Games and it is only since her death that the family has uncovered the traumatic holocaust experience.Her nana’s special gold necklace was gifted to Montag and she and her two sisters decided to make bracelets for each other as important keepsakes.Montag’s sunny nature is born of that resilience. She finished fourth at the recent world championships and in defending her victory on Saturday backing up her win at the Gold Coast 2018 Games, she even improved her best time by several seconds and set a new Games record.“Similar to last Commonwealth Games, I was pulled along by the crowd, it was amazing,’’ she said.” I wanted to enjoy that opportunity and enjoy the crowds, you don’t often hear 20,000 people, so I was enjoying it.“It is a different beast on the track, it is an added challenge going ten seconds faster per kilometre.”Montag said the judges had warned her “not to absolutely burst off at the start” as it draws their attention.“They wonder if you are breaking the rules,’’ she said, explaining a conservative start for the first couple of laps. By Simeon Thomas-WilsonThe redemption story for Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith is complete after they won the gold in the women’s synchronised 3m diving springboard final.Four years ago at the Gold Coast the two Australians were the favourites to take out the gold medal but finished last when they wiped out on their final dive.The pair were leading going into the final dive but Keeney lost her way in the air on the forward two and a half somersault two twists pike and landed awkwardly in the water.But there was no such drama for the Olympic bronze medallist as they put in a dominant display to claim Commonwealth Games bronze with a score of 316.53.The Australians were a class above the rest of the field, especially with their synchronisation as they claimed gold easily.The other Australian pair of Brittany Mae O’Brien and Fan Qin finished last after a shocker of a fourth dive ended their chances of a medal.9:05PM: MASSIVE UPSET FOR AUSSIE CHAMPBy Scott Gullan at Alexander StadiumAustralia’s Eleanor Patterson has suffered a shock defeat in the final of the women’s high-jump.The newly crowned world champion was a red-hot favourite to win her second Commonwealth Games title after the withdrawal of her main competitor, fellow Australian Nicola Olyslagers.But Patterson didn’t follow the script with three failures at 1.95m meaning she had to settle for a silver medal.Jamaica’s Lamara Distin took the gold medal.A stunned silence went over Alexander Stadium when the Australian missed her third attempt at a height which normally doesn’t offer too many issues particularly given she cleared 2.02m - equalling the national record - to win the world title in Eugene two weeks ago.Patterson, who won the 2014 Commonwealth title at the age of 18 in Glasgow, looked shocked and stayed on the mat with her head down for an extended period after her third miss.She had entered the competition at 1.85m and made first attempt clearances there and at 1.89m. She then missed her first attempt at 1.92m which raised eyebrows before correcting it on her second attempt.But she was all at sea at 1.95m with her exit one of the biggest shocks of the track and field program in Birmingham.Olyslagers, the Tokyo Olympic silver medallist, withdrew the night before the final because of a torn calf which she suffered during Thursday’s qualifying round.8:50PM By Eliza BarrAt last, Australia’s Alexandra Kiroi-Bogatyreva has come out on top - with a gold medal in the clubs final at the Commonwealth Games rhythmic gymnastics competition.The self-confessed perfectionist took silver in the team final, and bronze in the all-around - but the top spot on the podium had remained elusive.But when the Melbourne gymnast shot ahead of the competition with a score of 29.400, the usually stoic Kiroi-Bogatyreva could not contain tears of joy.Kiroi-Bogatyreva missed out on a medal in the ball final, with a tidy performance placing her in equal fourth.She is also out of contention for a medal in the ribbon final.Brisbane teen Lidiia Iakovleva came sixth in the hoop final, improving by one ranking on her qualification position with a score of 26.000.8:15PM ‘HATED’ AUSSIE FEARS ABUSE AFTER PENALTY FARCEA Hockeyroos star caught up in a penalty shootout farce swore off social media amid enormous backlash after India’s coach slammed an amateur umpiring decision.Australia booking their spot in the gold medal match was overshadowed by a massive controversy when Rosie Malone was given a re-do after her initial penalty was saved - only to bury home her second attempt, to loud boos from the crowd.While it was by the rules the decision was wildly contentious with former international Georgie Parker describing the decision as “amateur and unfortunate.”The crowd turned on the officials with boos ringing out.The shootout continued with Australia’s goalkeeper Jocelyn Bartram the hero saving all three of India’s efforts.Malone said she wasn’t going to go near social media - fearing the wrath of 1.38 billion Indians in the wake of her controversial retake.“When they called the retake I was thanking the universe for a second chance. I knew all of India would hate me if I put it in,” she said. “But I was just trying to think about my team and that final and I said to myself, if I get a second chance at this I’m not missing it.“I’m not going to be opening up my social media tonight.“I felt for India at the time, but all our other girls got our shootouts in so it’s not like that one shootout was the be all and end all.”By Joe BartonAustralia has a new lawn bowls hero, and her name is Ellen Ryan.The 25-year-old spearheaded a stunning extra-time comeback on Saturday to seal her second gold of the Birmingham Games alongside teammate Kristina Krstic in the women’s pairs, with a 19-18 win.Ryan and Krstic looked dead in the water early doors, trailing 11-2 after six ends, before roaring back to prevail in an extra-time contest that had the normally sedate Leamington Spa crowd giving off football fan vibes.But the Australians rattled off a 14-1 run to open up a four-point gap after 13, before England fought back over seesawing final five ends.But on a morning of outrageous bowling, it was the clutch plays of ‘Flash’ Ryan on the final end that delivered Australia a heart-stopping victory – and added to her gold medal collection, having already won the women’s singles.Trailing by one point headed into the 18th, and final, end of play, Ryan capitalised on the elite lead-up play by Krstic to send the match into a one-end shootout – with Ryan holding the final ball.And she came up with two incredible drives to blast England’s hopes to smithereens and trigger raucous celebrations with Krstic.7:27PM NETBALL BLOODBATHBy Erin SmithJamaica pulled apart New Zealand’s defence, then put up a brick wall between their shooters and the post, demolishing them in the first semi-final clash and earning a spot in their first gold medal match play off in any major international competition. The Sunshine Girls, full of confidence after securing their first ever win over Australia in their final round game, put four goals on New Zealand in the opening minutes of the game and the demolition job just continued for the remainder of the match, which ended 67-51. By the end of the first quarter they were up 18-9. It was 36-22 at the end of the first half. No matter what New Zealand did, Jamaica did it better. Super shooters Jhaniele Fowler and Shanice Beckford didn’t miss a shot in the first half.The third quarter was a lot closer with just two goals the difference but it still left New Zealand behind, 52-35. Jamaican substitutes were cheering, dancing and waving flags from the sideline, while the Kiwis sat stunned, their heads in their hands. There was little New Zealand could do in the final quarter, which Jamaica once again took control of.Prior to these Games Jamaica’s best performance had been a bronze medal. Jamaica will take on the winner of the England and Australia game in the gold medal match. The Kiwis will go up against the loser in the bronze medal play off. 6:00PM CODY’S MESSAGE AFTER OVERHWLMEING GAMESPopstar turned Commonwealth Games medallist Cody Simpson says he has been overwhelmed by support since returning to social media. Posting on Instagram for the first time since the games started, Simpson said to his 4.6 million followers: “I had remained off social media for the duration of the Commonwealth Games and a few days thereafter, but today I’ve redownloaded it to an overwhelming flood of supportive and congratulatory messages,” he wrote. “Thank you. For me, the very act of training morning and night followed by the thrill of racing is rewarding enough — but to walk away from my first Games with a gold and silver medal (for my swims in the mens 4x100m free and 4x100m medley relay heats) is something beyond articulation for now. “I’m honoured to represent Australia and represent all the kids who decide to walk steadfastly in the direction of their dreams.”Simpson finished fifth in the 100m butterfly final in Birmingham. Simpson’s relationship with golden girl Emma McKeon was one of the talking points of the Commonwealth Games swim meet. The couple have headed to Italy have a well-earned break after the Commonwealth Games’ swimming events wrapped up. MCKEOWN TAKES HER TRADEMARK TO LONDON Kaylee McKeown has taken her new trademark to the streets of England. The Commonwealth Games and Olympic gold medallist was snapped by News Corp photographer Michael Klein “flipping the bird” after one of her triumphs in Birmingham. And it appears the Aussie star has that same cheek out of the water too. Her sister Taylor, who swam her last meet for Australia last week, posted a picture of Kaylee in a British phone box with her middle finger raised. She captured the snap: Typical tourist pic done Kaylee style. Australia’s swimmers have taken to social media in recent days to share their holiday snaps, including glamour couple Cody Simpson and Emma McKeon in Italy.

WHY RYAN SHAW WAS NAMED BGS SKIPIn between those two tries BSHS centre Netani Lesimaikimatuku raised the lead to 25-18 with a penalty goal – which in the end was the difference.Lesimaikimatuku also saved a try, tackling Clifford, and as the referee’s whistle was about to sound, Clifford was felled for a second time in an exciting climax.Earlier, Terrace averted an early disaster when a miskick into touch was plucked down by BSHS winger Toshi Butlin who thought he had sprinted 90m to score.But in all the excitement the 100m sprint star placed a foot on the sideline, denying BSHS first points.However State High did score the first try through fly half Leofa who crossed after a withering counter attack by fullback Takava.On celebrating Leofa kissed his left hand and raised it to the heavens, then launched a swan dive that sent him crashing to earth over the line.It is a wonder Leofa, all adrenaline, did not wind himself, such was the height he reached.Terrace fullback Nick Dunstan then impersonated Takave with his own long distance run, but State High defenders displayed desire to regroup, even in the face of a bruising pick and drive assault by the Terrace forwards.Terrace did scramble its second penalty goal of the day from field position and it was 6-5.State High again remained composed after powerful lock Joseph Pona had been felled like a tree in the forest 1cm from scoring, and soon after that Pona enjoyed making no mistake to score.Leofa’s blistering midfield break, supported by centre Neteni Lesimaikimatuku, rewarded Pona for the energy he displayed in backing up his speedy inside backs.However Terrace had a splash of Flash Dan about them as well, scoring right on halftime when centre Nick Lawrence blazed over after a swish backs ball movement.The 13-12 halftime score line to Terrace said everything about the closeness of the clash.At the Shark Tank, Churchie’s hopes of an undefeated First XV season were crushed, with the Southport School clinching a 22-12 victory—yet another thrilling heavyweight bout to highlight the 2022 season.In what shaped up to be another premiership decider, which we are quickly learning is every game, the stars went head to head to keep their dreams of lifting that trophy alive come the season’s end.In a duel between centre pairings, Dre Pakeho and Frankie Golsbrough of Churchie and Jye Grey and Blake Ruaporo of Southport, it was Rabbitohs signed Grey who gave his team the edge.Ruaporo and Golsbrough were destructive with the ball in hand. Golsbrough left the opposition in his wake as he bumped off every first defender that confronted him. It was a similar story for Ruaporo.Pakeho’s passing was crisp and decision making spot on, but it was Grey and the whole Southport outfit who gave their passionate supporters one to remember.From the way the game was going in the early stages, you would have expected a different result. Churchie had more ball, better field position, and a couple great looks at the line, but it was the gutsy Southport defence that denied all that momentum.This effort on defence was even more impressive when managing to hold out Churchie for the last 10 minutes of the game and a few more after the whistle.Southport were clinical, resilient and a brick wall defensively. They were rewarded with the first two tries of the day, courtesy of some sorcery by Grey.Blake Raymond was on the receiving end of a draw and pass and made no mistake finishing it in the corner to go ahead five points, after twenty minutes holding out Churchie’s raids at the line.It was pure magic from Southport in the 30th minute, scoring an incredible try to go into the break ahead 12.Jye Grey had his prints all over it, with two touches in the scoring passage. Grey popped it up for Blake Ruaporo rampaging through the line and the rest was history with Ruaporo, Keahn Skipps and Grey connecting with a few unbelievable offloads.It was winger Mason King who dove over in the corner, getting hundreds of loud Southport supporters cheering. There wasn’t a time where they weren’t belting war cries.Destructive Dre Pakeho answered with a try from in close. Even with his head only half full of steam, Pakeho’s fend and ability to get on the outside of his defender allowed him to score Churchie’s first of the day.Gray can wreak havoc with the smallest of holes, so when scattered defenders and open pastures were presented in front of him he capitalised.With blistering speed and fleet of foot, Grey sliced through the line and struck away on an emphatic 20m dash. Southport now had the upper hand at 19-5.Churchie fullback Will Herbert drew his side within seven thanks to the quick hands of Pakeho and speedy service from scrumhalf Archie Wilson.Churchie were now uncomfortably close but the calm and collected Spencer Alock had just the response—a cracking penalty goal.With plenty of time left on the clock, Churchie were on the hunt down 22-12. A promising scrum unit in front row Diamond Fifita, Toby Kennedy and Archie Smith aided Churchie on their comeback.But, Southport forwards Harry Ward, Billy Wellard, Fergus Gillan and Nick Hilton, in an inspired team effort, managed to keep them out.This stunning win by Southport makes things interesting, especially with the competitiveness of team’s in this year’s competition.How will Churchie bounce back against talented Toowoomba, BBC and Brisbane Grammar teams and how will Southport and Nudgee perform in the second half of the season?Only time will tell as the premiership race heats up.On the famous Ipswich Grammar School soil, the home side snatched a win at the end over Brisbane Grammar School - after looking winners for the majority of the game.IGS led 19-7 at halftime, then lost the lead with two or three minutes to play by halfback Ned Madden, only to kick a penalty goal and win courtesy of Jack Hocking.IGS Director of Sport Nigel Greive said it was “an epic battle between two historic schools’’.“We have been playing each other since the 1860s in cricket and other sports, and for over a 100 years in rugby,’’ he said.“It was an amazing old boys day, a really special day for the school.’’It was a game of two halves, with IGS leading well at halftime, only to be starved of ball and opportunity by a resurging BGS in the second half.BGS coach Phil Mooney said his side “really fought hard’’ and was well led by No.8 Liam McGregor. “I was extremely proud of my boys.’’For IGS, Hocking showed nerves of steel to nail the winner while the team’s defence shone and showed great character. Captain and lock Ned Kendall, hooker Ayrton Holmes and flanker Lyncoln Cliffe did well, but it was a team performance.At Brisbane Boys College, a resilient, rousing defence effort by Nudgee College was the foundation for a hard fought win 24-11.On old boys day BBC were up for the battle and some battle it was, played largely in the forwards as both teams dug in for the long haul.Nudgee’ Head of Rugby Sean Graham described it as a “grinding sought of game’’, with Nudgee scoring some tries from rolling mauls.Importantly for Nudgee, prop Macarius Pereira returned from injury through the seconds and into the Firsts, scoring a try.BBC centre Xavier Rubens was competitive from start to finish and led the way for his side.ROUND 5TGS v ACGSBSHS v IGSBBC v TSSNC v BGSROUND 6GT v IGSTGS v BBCNC v BSHSBGS v TSS","pubDate":"2022-08-06 20:49:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-India seal T20 series against West Indies","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/08/07/cricket-india-seal-t20-series-against-west-indies","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - India took an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match Twenty20 series against West Indies by winning the fourth T20 in Lauderhill by 59 runs on Saturday, thanks to a combined effort from the team.

India posted a mammoth 191 runs in 20 overs with Rishabh Pant, Sharma and Sanju Samson chipping in with valuable knocks of 44, 33 and 30 respectively. In response, the hosts struggled with the Indian bowlers picking up wickets at regular intervals to secure a 59-run win on Saturday. West Indies were all out for 132 runs. Speaking at the post-match presentation, Sharma said that he was pleased with how the team played the game. He said that 190 was a good score but was wary of the threat possessed by the West Indies batters. He felt that the team played good cricket to secure the win on Saturday \"I think it was pleasing how we played the game. The conditions were not easy but we got to a good score. A lot of thought went in on how we batted and it was pleasing to see. The pitch was quite slow which our bowlers used to their advantage. I thought 190 was a good score, but with the kind of batting that WI have, no score is good. We played good cricket to get the win today. The batters were really smart and the bowlers bowled in pairs to get wickets. It put the brakes on their scoring,\" said Sharma. Sharma had special praise reserved for Avesh Khan, who secured the Man Of The Match award for his fine spell. The India captain said that the team management understands the pacer's talent and wants to give the players enough time in the middle. \"We do understand Avesh's talent. Anyone can have one or two bad games, but we want to keep his skills in mind. We want to give boys enough game time in the middle. He used the conditions and his height really well, which was great to see,\" said Sharma. Sharma also thanked the people who were present at the venue as well. \"I would also like to thank all the people who came in; I know it is hot and it isn't easy to sit out there and watch the game. There's another day to go,\" said Sharma.

During the fourth T20I of India’s tour of West Indies 2022 in Lauderhill, India beat West Indies by 59 runs to earn an unassailable 3-1 lead in a five-match series. Chasing a 192-run target, all West Indies could manage was 132 in 19.1 overs. A lack out of a much-needed standout performer resulted in the hosts not even lasting for their quota of 20 overs in a must-win encounter. Not that India had a standout performer but an archetype collective performance from them comprised of multiple players contributing across divisions to put on display a match-winning performance. Fast bowler Arshdeep Singh was the pick of their bowlers with figures of 3.1-0-12-3 dismissing Jason Holder (13), Dominic Drakes (5) and Obed McCoy (2). Having picked a couple of wickets in the powerplay, Avesh Khan made early inroads into the West Indian lineup picking figures of 4-0-17-2. Much like Khan, spinner Ravi Bishnoi and all-rounder Axar Patel also picked a couple of wickets each. Man of the Match today 4th T20 IND vs WI Put in to bat by West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran (24), India put on board 191/5 in 20 overs without a single batter scoring a half-century. Handy contributions from Rishabh Pant (44), Rohit Sharma (33) and Sanju Samson (30*) laid foundation for Patel to finish the innings on the back of his eight-ball 20*. As far as the match award is concerned, Khan was preferred ahead of the bowlers for dismissing Brandon King (13) and Devon Thomas (1) within the first seven balls that he bowled. Khan, 25, has won a match award for the first time in international cricket. “I feel really good because I didn’t do well in the last two games. I just focused on my strengths today, bowling the hard lengths. My coaches and my captain told me that they were backing me. They told me to bounce back and backed me a lot,” Khan told ESPN Caribbean during the post-match presentation ceremony. “The ball was stopping a bit in the wicket and so I was just mixing my slower deliveries with the hard lengths, which gave me the results. This ground feels like India only, it feels like home.

India have made three changes to their Playing XI for the fourth T20I of their ongoing tour of West Indies in Lauderhill. However, none of those changes involve fast bowler Harshal Patel returning to the Playing XI for this match. Patel, who had last played during India’s tour of England last month, hasn’t played a single match in West Indies owing to a rib injury. Having picked 23 wickets in 17 T20Is at an average and strike rate of 20.95 and 14.6 respectively, Patel has suffered an unfortunate injury at a time when India are to play a couple of multi-team tournaments in the near future. Patel’s absence has provided an extended run to pacer Avesh Khan. With Khan not doing as well as expected in his first 11 T20Is, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the selectors hand a T20I comeback to Deepak Chahar especially after him regaining fitness. It was after a delayed toss before the fourth T20I in Lauderhill that BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) took to their social media platform Twitter handle to provide an injury update with respect to Patel. “Harshal Patel has not fully recovered from his rib injury and is ruled out of the remaining two T20Is against West Indies,” read BCCI’s tweet ruling Patel out of the fifth T20I as well. 🚨 UPDATE: Harshal Patel has not fully recovered from his rib injury and is ruled out of the remaining two T20Is against West Indies. #TeamIndia | #WIvIND — BCCI (@BCCI) August 6, 2022 If reports doing the round around the 31-year old player are to be believed, Patel could face a hapless situation of being ruled out of Asia Cup 2022 and ICC T20 World Cup 2022 due to an injury.","pubDate":"2022-08-06 15:41:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CWG: Clock howler leaves India baffled, angry; FIH sorry","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/cwg-clock-howler-leaves-india-baffled-angry-fih-sorry-419531","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Birmingham, August 6A horrendous error by the officials robbed Indian women hockey team of a huge opportunity.It was an opportunity to put the mighty Australians under the pump and enter the CWG final but the callousness of the officials denied the gritty Indian team, which gave its all in pushing the most fearsome side in world hockey.Australians were feeling the heat for the first time in the tournament.

The ground has been covered and there should be some moisture. We’ll look for early wickets. Take the game as deep as possible and then win the key moments. We are playing some good cricket so far, the boys are looking forward to today’s game,” Pooran told ESPN Caribbean at the toss. In spite of being 1-2 down in a five-match series, the home team has refrained from making any changes to their Playing XI for a must-win encounter. Here is the Windies playing XI for the 4th T20I against 🇮🇳 #MenInMaroon #WIvIND pic.twitter.com/cJSxuqTYky — Windies Cricket (@windiescricket) August 6, 2022 Much like Pooran, India captain Rohit Sharma also wanted to bowl first at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium today. Although India winning two and losing one out of their previous four T20Is at this venue, Sharma highlighted uncertainty about the pitch ahead of the match. “We were also looking to bowl. Not sure how the pitch will play. We will now have to get the runs on the board. I understand where we stand as a team and will be looking to give chances to some of the other guys. We need to make them feel confident, that means we’ll have to give them plenty of games,” Sharma told ESPN Caribbean at the toss. Unlike West Indies, India have made a total of three changes to their Playing XI. Batter Sanju Samson, all-rounder Axar Patel and spinner Ravi Bishnoi will be playing this match in place of batter Shreyas Iyer, vice-captain Hardik Pandya and spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. With Sharma not being asked about the exact reasons behind making these changes, it’s safe to presume that all the three changes are regular rotational changes. The development means that India are playing an extra spin-bowling option here.","pubDate":"2022-08-06 15:15:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies vs India Live Score Ball by Ball, West Indies vs India, 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/west-indies-vs-india-live-score-over-4th-t20i-t20-1-5-updates-3231726","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between West Indies vs India from Central Broward Park, Lauderhill, Florida.

In a humdinger that boiled down to the last over, India's Sneh Rana defended 13 off the last over to send her team through to the final. The turning point of the game though took place in the penultimate over, when England captain Natalie Sciver, coming back for a risky second, was run out. Sciver was the set England batter having scored 40 off 43 balls, but in a bid to take matters into her own hands, called for a run that just wasn't there. This was after Sciver had smashed a six and managed four leg byes off the previous two balls to bring the equation down to 14 off 7. But the run out proved to be the beginning of the end for England, who will now play for bronze. India's platform was set up by their star batter Smriti Mandhana, who rocketed to a half-century off just 23 balls, the fastest by an India batter in women's cricket. After Harmanpreet Kaur won the toss and opted to bat, Mandhana and Shafali Varma got India off the blocks and provided a brisk start, racing away to 64 in the Powerplay, Mandhana being the aggressor. Varma was the first Indian wicket to fall, and although Harmanpreet and Deepti Sharma got starts scoring 20 off 20 and 22 off 20 respectively, it was Jemimah Rodrigues' innings of 44 that gave India the impetus it needed towards the end. With Mandhana falling in the 9th over after scoring 61 off 32 balls with eight boundaries and three sixes, Rodrigues hit seven fours in 31 balls that helped India cross the 150-run margin and set a challenging total. Like India, England women began their innings briskly, with Danielle Wyatt scoring 35 off 27 before Rana dismissed her and Deepti Sharma trapping Sophia Dunkley LBW opened the gates. Sciver and Amy Jones threatened to take the game away from India stitching a 54-run partnership for the fourth wicket, but it was the first of the three run-outs that provided India the breakthrough, and allowed India to mount pressure. England had an outside chance as long as Sciver was out there, but once Taniya Bhatia’s bullet throw from the deep sent the England captain back, it was India's game. In the last over, with 13 needed off 3, substitute Harleen Deol dropped a sitter a long on, but after Rana gave away just a single off the penultimate over, Sophie Ecclestone's six off the last ball did nothing but reduce the margin of defeat.

The second season of The Hundred is up and running. Justifying the ballyhoo in the build-up to The Hundred 2022, the ongoing season has already witnessed jam-packed stadiums in its first week. Currently only into its fourth match, a clash between Trent Rockets and Birmingham Phoenix in Nottingham will ensure that all the teams play a match each. While all the matches on weekdays of the second season were played according to England’s prime-time slots, both the first weekend matches are being played to cater to a larger audiences in the Indian sub-continent. This @thehundred is CATCHING ON! The demographic of the crowds are for all to see! The cricketing world is following the fast pace of the world! Kids are the future! 🚀 — Kevin Pietersen🦏 (@KP24) August 6, 2022 As a result, players are engaging in afternoon matches right now. As far as double-headers are concerned, the first weekend of The Hundred 2022 doesn’t have any scope for allowing two matches in a single day. The nature of The Hundred’s format is such that stroke-filled team innings are expected to be put on display more often than not. With each team getting to bat for 100 balls, batters are bound to go for their big shots earlier than what is the case even in T20s. At the time of writing this article, none out of the first seven The Hundred 2022 innings have been able to register one of the Top Five highest innings totals in the history of this tournament. Yet to host a match this season due to Commonwealth Games 2022 Women’s Cricket Competition being played there, Edgbaston, Birmingham, has been witness to as many as three out of the Top Five highest innings score in The Hundred.","pubDate":"2022-08-06 14:52:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England's Commonwealth cricket hopes dashed by India","link":"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/englands-commonwealth-cricket-hopes-dashed-by-india-144922865.html?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-06 14:49:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"yahoo","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"CWG Cricket: हरमनप्रीत की कप्तानी ने धोनी और वर्ल्ड कप 2007 की याद दिलाई, भारत फाइनल में पहुंचा","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/news/sports/cricket-indian-women-reach-in-cwg-2022-cricket-finals-as-sneh-rana-stars-and-harmanpreet-kaur-great-captaincy-4449998.html","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Commonwealth Games 2022: भारत की महिला क्रिकेट टीम ने कॉमनवेल्थ गेम्स के फाइनल में जगह बना ली है. भारत को सेमीफाइनल में इंग्लैंड को हराया. भारत की जीत का श्रेय स्मृति मंधाना (Smriti Mandhana) की बेहतरीन बैटिंग, स्नेह राणा (Sneh Rana) की शानदार बॉलिंग के साथ-साथ कप्तान हरमनप्रीत कौर (Harmanpreet Kaur) की बेहतरीन कप्तानी को भी जाता है, जिन्होंने आखिरी ओवर में साहसिक निर्णय लिया.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-06 14:07:14","image_url":"https://images.news18.com/ibnkhabar/uploads/2022/08/Harmanpreet-Kaur-AP221-C-16597945943x2.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=675","source_id":"hindinews18","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"‘But she will be…': Harmanpreet Kaur gives Jemimah Rodrigues' injury update ahead of CWG final","link":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games/but-she-will-be-harmanpreet-kaur-gives-jemimah-rodrigues-injury-update-ahead-of-cwg-final-101659794306315.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Jemimah Rodrigues was on the receiving end of an injury during India's win vs England in their women's cricket semi-final match at the ongoing Commonwealth Games 2022.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-06 14:03:14","image_url":"https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/08/06/1600x900/ANI-20220806326-0_1659794407924_1659794407924_1659794434765_1659794434765.jpg","source_id":"hindustantimes","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"20 years since the Ashington Express first steamed in for England","link":"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/20596953.20-years-since-ashington-express-first-steamed-england/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"HISTORY was made 20 years ago on when 23-year-old Stephen Harmison became the first cricketer from the County Durham cricket academy to play for England after his selection against India at Trent Bridge for the second of a five match Test series.

A tight three-run over from Deepti Sharma brought India back in the match.

A great 54-run stand between skipper Nat Sciver (41) and Amy Jones (31) threatened to take away the match from Women in Blue. However, India managed to hold their nerves and defended 14 runs in the final over to win the match by four runs. Opting to bat first, openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma gave India a great start. Verma was the less aggressive of the two. Mandhana, on the other hand, was sending the ball to the boundary frequently. Freya Kemp gave England the breakthrough and broke the 76-run stand by dismissing Verma for 15 off 17 balls. Mandhana had brought up her half-century and was dismissed just moments after her partner. She fell to Nat Sciver, the English skipper for a quickfire 61 off 32 balls with eight fours and three sixes. Jemimah Rodrigues was next up on crease. She built a 29-run stand with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20) and a 53-run stand with Deepti Sharma (22). Kamp got her second wicket of the match by dismissing Kaur while Katherine Brunt removed Deepti. Pooja Vastrakar fell for a duck due to an unfortunate run-out. Rodrigues (44*) off 31 balls took India to 164/5 at the end of their 20 overs. Kemp was the pick of the bowlers for England, taking 2/22. Sciver and Brunt took one each. England was off to a shaky start. Deepti Sharma removed Sophia Dunkley for just 19 off 10 balls when the team was at 28 runs. Danielle Wyatt and Alice Caspey attempted to rebuild the innings but their stand was broken after Caspey was run out for just 13 runs. Wyatt was bowled by Sneh Rana for 35 off 27, leaving England at 81/3. Captain Sciver and wicketkeeper Amy Jones then went on to stitch a 54-run stand which swung back things a little in favour of the hosts. Jones was run out for 31 and Sciver also faced the same fate after a while, leaving England at 151/5 in 18.5 overs. Team India needed to defend 14 runs in the last over. Rana managed to hold her nerves and defended these last few runs as she bowled to Maia Bouchier with Sophie Ecclestone at the other end. India were able to restrict England to 160/6 in 20 overs, winning the match by four runs. Rana was the pick of the bowlers with 2/28. Deepti Sharma also took a wicket. Brief Scores: India: 164/5 in 20 overs (Smriti Mandhana 61, Jemimah Rodrigues 44*, Freya Kemp 2/22) won against England: 160/6 in 20 overs (Natalie Sciver 41, Amy Jones 31, Sneh Rana 2/28).","pubDate":"2022-08-06 13:57:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"INDW vs ENGW highlights T20: India vs England Womens highlights Commonwealth Games 2022 T20","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-indw-vs-engw-highlights-t20-india-vs-england-womens-highlights-commonwealth-games-2022-t20/","keywords":["Cricket","commonwealth games 2022","England Women","India Women"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"INDW vs ENGW highlights: England Women and India Women participated in a nail-biting contest at the Edgbaston today.

During the first semi-final of Commonwealth Games Women’s Cricket Competition between England Women and India Women in Birmingham, India Women beat England Women by 4 runs in a nail-biting contest. India will now be facing the winner of second semi-final between Australia Women and New Zealand Women in the final tomorrow. Chasing a 165-run target, England failed to retain the progress made in the powerplay on the back of scoring 58/1 in six overs. Set batters Alice Capsey (13) and Danni Wyatt (35) getting out right at the start of the middle overs was the first sign of them losing control of the chase. Captain Nat Sciver (41) and wicket-keeper batter Amy Jones (31) did join hands for a rescuing 54-run fourth-wicket partnership but couldn’t bring forward their A-game when needing 30 runs in the last three overs. Sciver did hit India all-rounder Pooja Vastrakar for a six and a four (leg bye) in the penultimate over but her run-out dismissal in the same over hurt her team. England, who then needed to score 14 runs off the last over, couldn’t go past the victory line with their lower-order batters. Bowling the last over, India spinner Ekta Rana held her nerve to defend the total at Edgbaston today. Pick of the Indian bowlers, Rana returned with figures of 4-0-28-2. All-rounder Deepti Sharma (4-0-18-1) was the only other wicket-taker for India as the hosts lost as many as three batters to run-outs. Earlier, India scored 164/5 in 20 overs primarily due to top-order batters Smriti Mandhana (61) and Jemimah Rodrigues (44*) justifying captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s (20) decision of batting first. What a performance team India, scripting history specially beating England once again in England. 🥇 #CommonwealthGames 🇮🇳 #ENGvIND — Yuzvendra Chahal (@yuzi_chahal) August 6, 2022 For those who missed watching the match on a Saturday afternoon have an option of enjoying a cliffhanger contest via highlights.
