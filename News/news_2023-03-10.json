Published on By A defiant 81 not out by Jason Holder ensured that West Indies’s first-innings deficit was kept down to only 69 runs on the second evening in Johannesburg. In response to South Africa’s 320, West Indies were reeling at 162/8 at one point in time but Holder, who hit 8 fours and 4 sixes during his 117-ball stay, managed to forge crucial partnerships with Kemar Roach and Gudakesh Motie and helped add 89 runs for the last two wickets. Otherwise, South Africa were pretty much all over the visitors during the course of the innings. Brief Scores: 320 (Aiden Markram 96, Tony de Zorzi 85; Kyle Mayers 3-32) 4/0 251 (Jason Holder 81*, Kyle Mayers 29; Kagiso Rabada 2-19,Gerald Coetzee 3-41) Published on By Hillwood Club girls from Kandy swept the boards at the ‘One-Whistle’ Invitational Netball Tournament conducted by the Colombo Malay Cricket Club (CMCC) to mark its 150th-anniversary celebrations which began in March 2022. The tournament held at the Padang on Sunday (March 5) was played in a carnival atmosphere with the participation of 20 teams including two men’s teams from Monaragala and Ratnapura who featured in an exhibition match. Organised under the supervision of former national captain and Asia Cup-winning coach Hyacinth Wijesinghe, a unique feature of this tournament was that matches were played simultaneously on four courts beginning and ending with one whistle during the league stage with a running clock of seven minutes in each half with an interval of one minute. Piyaratne, Padukka emerged champions in the Under 15 school final defeating Yasodara Balika 9-7. Hillwood Club won the club final defeating Kalutara Balika 11-7. The Veterans final was won by Track Master who beat Police 7-4. Hillwood carried away the special awards with Kusalika Aluwihare crowned CMCC Netball Queen, Yuthara Rajaratnam (Best Centre Court player), Lakshika Aluwihare (Best Defensive Player) and Vichali Mawilmada (Best Shooter) bagging other awards. A former official of the Netball Federation of Sri Lanka Yasmin Dharmaratne was the chief guest while Damayanthi Jayathilaka was the Guest of Honour. NFSL president Lakshmi Victoria also graced the occasion. Published on By Impressive knocks from almost the entirety of the Sri Lankan top order, particularly Kusal Mendis, gave Sri Lanka a promising start in their pursuit of an unlikely World Test Championship final berth, as they put up 305 for 6 on the opening day of the first Test at Hagley Oval. However the persistence of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up five wickets between them, ensured the visitors would at no point run away with proceedings. At the close of play Dhananjaya de Silva was at the crease unbeaten on 39, with Kasun Rajitha alongside him on 16. That Rajitha is even at the crease with just six wickets down speaks towards the length of Sri Lanka’s tail. Rajitha, however to his credit, has thus far provided an able foil during the 37-run stand. The first hour or so of the morning session saw Henry and Southee beat the edge with regularity, and their relentless lines and lengths – just outside off, angled in, shaping away, off a good length – eventually paid off. Ironically, it was one drifting down leg that did the trick, as Oshada Fernando was strangled down leg. That however brought Mendis to the crease, and Sri Lanka’s approach was transformed. Carrying over his recent white-ball form, Mendis accounted for 15 of the 21 boundaries scored in the session, on the way to a 51-ball 73 at the break – he would end on 87 off 83. His partnership with Dimuth Karunaratne meanwhile would yield 137. A majority of his scoring came on the leg side, particularly behind square. Henry and Neil Wagner were punished as they looked to test the diminutive Lankan with some short stuff, while Southee and Blair Tickner were whipped in front of square for deliveries that veered a little too full or straight. There were a few dicey cuts over gully as well, but Mendis’ only genuine moment of peril came when he was yet to get off the mark. A ball nipping back off a good length had seen him struck in front of middle on the back pad. The umpire felt this was hitting middle and off, but DRS showed the ball bouncing over the stumps – something neither the New Zealand players nor on-air commentators could quite believe. Mendis’ aggression coincided with New Zealand’s seamers losing the lengths that had served them so well in the early part of the morning. They would correct this after lunch, however, and within the first hour of the second session they would see the backs of both Mendis and Karunaratne. Mendis was surprised by one that jagged back in off a length from outside off, as he failed to offer a stroke and was struck on the back leg, while Karunaratne was out caught on a loose drive an over later, offering a thick edge to second slip. While the pair were at the crease Sri Lanka had been cantering along at nearly five an over, however the scoring rate slowed a touch once Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal set about their rebuild. Both underwent testing periods, with New Zealand’s battery of seamers teasing both edges of the bat. However the pair remained unflustered, and once the bowlers began to tire, the runs began to flow – much like in the morning session. The pair of Blair Tickner and Daryl Mitchell in particular afforded the Lankans a degree of comfort, and in the final over before tea Chandimal took full advantage with three consecutive boundaries – the first an uppercut over the slip corden, and then two consecutive off-drives. Following a brief rain stoppage at the start of the final session, Mathews and Chandimal proceeded to push the scoring at around four an over, but the hosts would strike back one final time. Chandimal would be the first to fall, edging a drive into the slips – a rare slip in an otherwise disciplined innings. Mathews would stay a bit longer alongside Dhananjaya, before he too edged one to first slip, one ball after becoming the third Sri Lankan to reach 7,000 Test runs. When Niroshan Dickwella was trapped leg before shortly after, going for a sweep off the part-time off spin of Michael Bracewell, it looked like Sri Lanka had thrown away their enterprising start. But Dhananjaya and Rajitha have ensured that it was just about Sri Lanka’s day.","pubDate":"2023-03-10 00:01:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Holder’s 81* minimises deficit as West Indies fold for 251","link":"http://island.lk/holders-81-minimises-deficit-as-west-indies-fold-for-251/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"A defiant 81 not out by Jason Holder ensured that West Indies’s first-innings deficit was kept down to only 69 runs on the second evening in Johannesburg.

Jos Buttler's team featured seven of those that defeated Pakistan in Melbourne last November, but crucially were missing three frontline batters and it told as they were condemned to a six-wicket defeat with two overs unused by opponents that had lost 22 of their previous 25 T20s against fellow Test nations. Aside from captain Buttler's power-packed contribution of 67 and a cameo from Ben Duckett, there was a distinct lack of fluency about England's innings and in an anaemic end just 21 runs came from the final four overs. It proved the decisive period of the contest. Ironically, one player who had shown an ability to thrive in these conditions by hitting a match-winning hundred during England's one-day series win, Jason Roy left this tour on Tuesday and crunched a breathtaking, unbeaten 63-ball 145 in the Pakistan Super League 24 hours later. The England selectors did not want to ask a player they dumped on the eve of last year's World Cup to stay on as Will Jacks' injury replacement, foregoing a franchise fee in the process, or indeed ask another PSL participant to hot-foot it across Asia, so instead opted to stick with what they had. Bangladesh's Najmul Hossain Shanto hits out during his innings of 51 off 30 deliveries Shanto carved the England bowling attack, including Mark Wood, for eight boundaries Shanto celebrates his half-century in front of an enthusiastic crowd in Chattogram It means the tourists will use Moeen Ali and Sam Curran at numbers five and six throughout the three games and when Duckett and Buttler were dismissed from consecutive deliveries, it meant the make-do pairing came together at 135 for four, with 23 deliveries to come. Backed up by the more established duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed, death specialist Hasan Mahmud was at his stingy best, denying his opponents any pace to work with at a ground where the Bangladeshis squeezed so effectively to take a consolation ODI win earlier in the week. 'Bangladesh finished the innings well, we were in a position to kick on but were 20 short,' conceded Buttler, whose sixth 50 in 10 T20 international innings arrived from the first of successive sixes, soon after Phil Salt's stodgy 38 from 35 balls came to an end. Faced with a modest chase, Bangladesh turned the extra speed of England's attack against them. Rony Talukdar, making his second international appearance eight years after his first, set the tone at the top of the order before man-of-the-match Najmul Hossain Shanto and debutant Towhid Chowdhury shared a decisive stand of 65 for the third wicket. It came in no time thanks to a spree of six fours in a row between them, the latter four from Shanto off Mark Wood. Short of numbers in batting, England at least had plenty of options with the ball - seven in all - but they simply didn't have enough runs to work with and even though Wood returned to silence a vociferous and sizeable crowd by skittling Shanto's stumps following a swashbuckling 51, Shakib Al Hasan and Afif Hossain were able to toddle home in second gear. Earlier, Shanto held three catches at long-on and created a last-ball chance that fellow boundary rider Talukdar squandered as Bangladesh recovered from gifting lives to Salt and Buttler in the same Nasum Ahmed over to bring the World Cup winners back down to earth.

Holder's attacking rearguard guided the West Indies to 251 all out in 79.3 overs, something that forced South Africa into three overs of batting, which the hosts negotiated to 4/0 without undue hassles. Holder's knock meant South Africa led by just 69 runs instead of a triple-figure buffer that would've made life easier for them. Holder hadn't scored a Test half-century in 19 knocks dating back to the first Test against Pakistan in Kingston in August 2021, but when he was needed to salvage a faltering innings, he did what was asked of him. Holder, who came in at 157/5 after Joshua da Silva was castled by Simon Harmer, dominated the lower-order partnerships he shared with Alzarri Joseph (4), Kemar Roach (13), and Gudakesh Motie (17) to ensure the Windies were in a far better state. With Kagiso Rabada unable to bowl in the last session, Holder took advantage of the senior pacer's absence to help raise 134 runs for the last four wickets. It meant South Africa started and ended the day badly, even though they held sway in the middle stages of the proceedings. When South Africa lost their last three wickets in the space of 20 minutes, the stage was set for a hi-octane day of cricket under a hot sun. While wickets did fall, seven of them in the first session, the game didn't motor at a speed that would keep traffic cameras busy. What the slowed-down pace of the game did do was to expose the pitch to a sun that hardly hid under the clouds. It quickened up, something that allowed South Africa's pacers to extract more bounce and deviation from the surface. It also allowed for Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer to get more turn and bounce, even though it was far more consistent compared to day one. The fire and brimstone from the pace bowlers remained a consistent problem for the batters, with South Africa's tail not being able to cope with the heat. Heinrich Klaasen (17) though was guilty of the laziest dismissal of the day when he wafted at a wide Kyle Mayers' delivery, which was the third one of the day. After Klaasen had chased Mayers into Da Silva's gloves, Maharaj was back in the dressing room an over-and-a-half later when he clipped a nothing Joseph short-ball to Motie at midwicket. In Joseph's next over, Coetzee was bounced out, completing South Africa's collapse of 8/72, giving the West Indies more time to bat. That said, South Africa didn't waste much time in getting among the West Indians, with Tagenarine Chanderpaul (1) being run out by Temba Bavuma off the second ball of the fourth over to leave the tourists tottering at 1/1. It was the start of the bowling dry process that snared West Indian captain Kraigg Brathwaite (17), who feathered a Rabada (2/19) delivery to Dean Elgar at first slip. A total of 22/2 after 10.3 overs became 28/3 after Jermaine Blackwood was caught behind by Klaasen off Coetzee (3/41), but a 23-run partnership between Roston Chase (28) and Raymon Reifer (15) staved off a complete pre-lunch meltdown. Reifer was claimed by Coetzee when the southpaw offered a catch to De Zorzi at short-leg, something that left the West Indies reeling at 51/4. It was left to Chase and Mayers to start a repair job that came in the form of a 52-run stand for the fifth wicket. They were untroubled as the pitch quietened down and Chase, whose inconsistency with bat and ball has been a talking point, was comfortable against both spin and pace. He was out in the most unfortunate manner when he inside-edged a Wiaan Mulder (1/40) drive onto his stumps. His exit drew reticent batting from the visitors as the 13-run stand between Mayers and Da Silva spanned 56 balls. Mayers (28) was worked over by Rabada outside his off-stump and it came as no surprise when he edged Rabada to Elgar at first slip. That brought Holder to the crease and the lanky all-rounder played an innings of high quality and responsibility. His 12th Test 50 that came off 79 balls was one that contained glorious drives and some agricultural hitting. It was necessary for Holder to hit out for his partners didn't always look competent enough to stay for long at the other end. He shared a 41-run alliance with the fidgety Da Silva (26), who was bowled through the gate by Harmer, while Joseph popped a simple catch to De Zorzi at silly point off Maharaj (1/77). That meant Holder needed to take charge of the last two partnerships, which he did to a large degree as the West Indies reduced South Africa's lead to less than 100. Holder then shared a 58-run stand with Motie (17), with Holder scoring 40 of those runs which also included a missed stumping from Klaasen off Harmer (2/63). Motie gifted a catch to Bavuma at short cover off Harmer to give South Africa a nervy batting stint they navigated without too much fuss. Scores in brief: South Africa : 320 (Aiden Markram 96, Tony de Zorzi 85, Kyle Mayers 3/32, Alzarri Joseph 3/60) and 4/0 West Indies: 251(Jason Holder 81*,Mayers 29, Roston Chase 28, Joshua da Silva 26, Gerald Coetzee 3/41, Kagiso Rabada 2/19, Simon Harmer 2/63)","pubDate":"2023-03-09 17:46:46","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, Face Royal Challengers Bangalore","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/up-warriorz-eye-second-win-face-royal-challengers-bangalore/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports WPL 2023: UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, Face Royal Challengers Bangalore Alyssa Healy led UP Warriorz will look to register their second win in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League as they face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the iconic Brabourne Stadium, here on Friday.\r WPL 2023: UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, […]","content":"Mumbai, March 9: Alyssa Healy led UP Warriorz will look to register their second win in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League as they face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the iconic Brabourne Stadium, here on Friday. The UP Warriorz began their campaign at the WPL 2023 with a bang, as Grace Harris’ incredible power-hitting helped them clinch a sensational 3-wicket win against the Gujarat Giants at the DY Patil Stadium. In their opener, the Warriorz were in a spot of bother with the Giants bowling picking important wickets, however, a solid counter-attack from Kiran Navgire, Harris and Sophie Ecclestone provided the team with right amount of impetus in the home stretch, as they ran out comfortable winners on the night. Right after, Healy and co were up against the Delhi Capitals at the DY Patil Stadium. And while the result did not turn out in the Warriorz’s favour, Tahlia McGrath flexed her muscles and put on a show to remember, scoring an unbeaten 90 from 50 deliveries, smashing 11 boundaries and 4 sixes, in what was eventually a losing cause. “The UP Warriorz is in a good place right now, yes, the second game did not go as per plans for us, but this is sport and there will be a winner and a loser in the match. We have had quite a few positives in our first two games, and we will definitely look to build on that every day, and against the Royal Challengers Bangalore we hope to put our best forward and pick up crucial points. RCB have a good team and it won’t be easy at all, but as long as we can execute our plans the way we need, the Warriorz should be able to respond to whatever situation comes our way,” said captain Healy on the eve of the match. While the UP Warriorz have started their run at the tournament with some fantastic individual performances, their opponents, Royal Challengers Bangalore, are yet to register their first points and have lost three games on the bounce up until now. The Warriorz, who drafted in the young Shivali Shinde for the injured Laxmi Yadav, will be keen to ensure that the Smriti Mandhana led RCB stay down and out, for at least another game. For Alyssa Healy and co, the task on hand may not seem very tough, given the situation with the run of form, but such is the fickle nature of T20 cricket, that there aren’t any free lunches, and the Warriorz are well aware of that. And while the captain is yet to go through the gears in terms of her own form, the likes of Sophie Ecclestone, Grace Harris and Kiran Navgire and Deepti Sharma are all in great form, which augurs well for the Warriorz. UP Warriorz Squad: Alyssa Healy (Captain), Sophie Ecclestone, Deepti Sharma, Tahlia McGrath, Shabnim Ismail, Anjali Sarvani, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Parshavi Chopra, Shweta Sehrawat, S Yashasri, Kiran Navgire, Grace Harris, Devika Vaidya, Lauren Bell, Simran Shaikh, Shivali Shinde. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-03-09 16:55:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LISTEN: On ‘Talking Point’ — SA’s batting woes and Currie Cup rugby","link":"https://www.citizen.co.za/sport/listen-talking-point-batting-woes-currie-cup/","keywords":["Sport","cricket","currie cup","podcast","proteas cricket team","Rugby"],"creator":["Sports Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Is there still love and affection for the Currie Cup in South African rugby?","content":"It’s been another busy week on the cricket front with the Proteas in action in the second Test against the West Indies at the Wanderers, while the 2023 edition of the Currie Cup gets underway this weekend.

It is an accomplishment he hadn’t dreamt of, having carried the drinks on his previous tours of India in 2013 and 2017. Khawaja, Australia’s best batter on this tour, batted for six hours to grind down a quality attack, scoring an unbeaten 104 out of team’s 255 for four on Thursday. “I don’t think I have ever smiled so much on getting a century, there was emotion in it. I have done two (Test) tours of India before (2013 and 2017). Carried the drinks for eight Test matches before I got a chance here,” you could feel the pain and joy in his words. The 36-year-old lost a lot of time when Cricket Australia tried out mediocre openers like Marcus North and Chris Rogers. “Throughout the middle of my career I got told I couldn’t play spin and that’s why I never got an opportunity to play in India. “It’s just nice to go out there and tick off a hundred in India which was something if you asked me five years ago if you told me that I would think you were crazy,” Khawaja doesn’t let you miss the point as to what it meant for him. “There was a lot of emotion, I just never expected this to happen,” the Islamabad-born, Queensland-raised cricketer, said. So did he agree with that perception in Australian cricket that he couldn’t play spin” “Maybe to some extent. But think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy in its own way. People start saying that then perception is reality. Anytime I got out to spin, people were like ‘you can’t play spin’. I probably started believing it myself,” he said. No support from teams of past ====================. Khawaja lamented how the cricketing ecosystem Down Under never had his back in the early days of his career. “I didn’t really get the support from the people around me at the time. I didn’t feel like the team really supported me. I didn’t feel like the coaching staff and selectors really supported me through that journey. It just made it so hard,” he was blunt. “Whether I was or wasn’t, yes I’m a better player of spin now, no doubt about that, I have more shots, better defence. But I didn’t really get the opportunity to learn at that early stage.” So how did he turn the tables? “Fortunately enough, I am quite stubborn so went out of my own way to learn, then we had a couple of A tours here in India which helped a lot. Had to go back and figure it out all by myself.” Source link","pubDate":"2023-03-09 15:32:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MCA Six a Side Tournament at Galle International Stadium","link":"http://island.lk/mca-six-a-side-tournament-at-galle-international-stadium/","keywords":["Sports","Featured"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Mercantile Cricket Association (MCA) for the first time in their 112 year cricketing history, will venture out to conduct a tournament at an outstation venue.

Piyaratne, Padukka emerged champions in the Under 15 school final defeating Yasodara Balika 9-7. Hillwood Club won the club final defeating Kalutara Balika 11-7. The Veterans final was won by Track Master who beat Police 7-4. Hillwood carried away the special awards with Kusalika Aluwihare crowned CMCC Netball Queen, Yuthara Rajaratnam (Best Centre Court player), Lakshika Aluwihare (Best Defensive Player) and Vichali Mawilmada (Best Shooter) bagging other awards. A former official of the Netball Federation of Sri Lanka Yasmin Dharmaratne was the chief guest while Damayanthi Jayathilaka was the Guest of Honour. NFSL president Lakshmi Victoria also graced the occasion. Published on By Impressive knocks from almost the entirety of the Sri Lankan top order, particularly Kusal Mendis, gave Sri Lanka a promising start in their pursuit of an unlikely World Test Championship final berth, as they put up 305 for 6 on the opening day of the first Test at Hagley Oval. However the persistence of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up five wickets between them, ensured the visitors would at no point run away with proceedings. At the close of play Dhananjaya de Silva was at the crease unbeaten on 39, with Kasun Rajitha alongside him on 16. That Rajitha is even at the crease with just six wickets down speaks towards the length of Sri Lanka’s tail. Rajitha, however to his credit, has thus far provided an able foil during the 37-run stand. The first hour or so of the morning session saw Henry and Southee beat the edge with regularity, and their relentless lines and lengths – just outside off, angled in, shaping away, off a good length – eventually paid off. Ironically, it was one drifting down leg that did the trick, as Oshada Fernando was strangled down leg. That however brought Mendis to the crease, and Sri Lanka’s approach was transformed. Carrying over his recent white-ball form, Mendis accounted for 15 of the 21 boundaries scored in the session, on the way to a 51-ball 73 at the break – he would end on 87 off 83. His partnership with Dimuth Karunaratne meanwhile would yield 137. A majority of his scoring came on the leg side, particularly behind square. Henry and Neil Wagner were punished as they looked to test the diminutive Lankan with some short stuff, while Southee and Blair Tickner were whipped in front of square for deliveries that veered a little too full or straight. There were a few dicey cuts over gully as well, but Mendis’ only genuine moment of peril came when he was yet to get off the mark. A ball nipping back off a good length had seen him struck in front of middle on the back pad. The umpire felt this was hitting middle and off, but DRS showed the ball bouncing over the stumps – something neither the New Zealand players nor on-air commentators could quite believe. Mendis’ aggression coincided with New Zealand’s seamers losing the lengths that had served them so well in the early part of the morning. They would correct this after lunch, however, and within the first hour of the second session they would see the backs of both Mendis and Karunaratne. Mendis was surprised by one that jagged back in off a length from outside off, as he failed to offer a stroke and was struck on the back leg, while Karunaratne was out caught on a loose drive an over later, offering a thick edge to second slip. While the pair were at the crease Sri Lanka had been cantering along at nearly five an over, however the scoring rate slowed a touch once Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal set about their rebuild. Both underwent testing periods, with New Zealand’s battery of seamers teasing both edges of the bat. However the pair remained unflustered, and once the bowlers began to tire, the runs began to flow – much like in the morning session. The pair of Blair Tickner and Daryl Mitchell in particular afforded the Lankans a degree of comfort, and in the final over before tea Chandimal took full advantage with three consecutive boundaries – the first an uppercut over the slip corden, and then two consecutive off-drives. Following a brief rain stoppage at the start of the final session, Mathews and Chandimal proceeded to push the scoring at around four an over, but the hosts would strike back one final time. Chandimal would be the first to fall, edging a drive into the slips – a rare slip in an otherwise disciplined innings. Mathews would stay a bit longer alongside Dhananjaya, before he too edged one to first slip, one ball after becoming the third Sri Lankan to reach 7,000 Test runs. When Niroshan Dickwella was trapped leg before shortly after, going for a sweep off the part-time off spin of Michael Bracewell, it looked like Sri Lanka had thrown away their enterprising start. But Dhananjaya and Rajitha have ensured that it was just about Sri Lanka’s day.","pubDate":"2023-03-10 00:01:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"island","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Holder’s 81* minimises deficit as West Indies fold for 251","link":"http://island.lk/holders-81-minimises-deficit-as-west-indies-fold-for-251/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Priyan"],"video_url":null,"description":"A defiant 81 not out by Jason Holder ensured that West Indies’s first-innings deficit was kept down to only 69 runs on the second evening in Johannesburg.

Jos Buttler's team featured seven of those that defeated Pakistan in Melbourne last November, but crucially were missing three frontline batters and it told as they were condemned to a six-wicket defeat with two overs unused by opponents that had lost 22 of their previous 25 T20s against fellow Test nations. Aside from captain Buttler's power-packed contribution of 67 and a cameo from Ben Duckett, there was a distinct lack of fluency about England's innings and in an anaemic end just 21 runs came from the final four overs. It proved the decisive period of the contest. Ironically, one player who had shown an ability to thrive in these conditions by hitting a match-winning hundred during England's one-day series win, Jason Roy left this tour on Tuesday and crunched a breathtaking, unbeaten 63-ball 145 in the Pakistan Super League 24 hours later. The England selectors did not want to ask a player they dumped on the eve of last year's World Cup to stay on as Will Jacks' injury replacement, foregoing a franchise fee in the process, or indeed ask another PSL participant to hot-foot it across Asia, so instead opted to stick with what they had. Bangladesh's Najmul Hossain Shanto hits out during his innings of 51 off 30 deliveries Shanto carved the England bowling attack, including Mark Wood, for eight boundaries Shanto celebrates his half-century in front of an enthusiastic crowd in Chattogram It means the tourists will use Moeen Ali and Sam Curran at numbers five and six throughout the three games and when Duckett and Buttler were dismissed from consecutive deliveries, it meant the make-do pairing came together at 135 for four, with 23 deliveries to come. Backed up by the more established duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed, death specialist Hasan Mahmud was at his stingy best, denying his opponents any pace to work with at a ground where the Bangladeshis squeezed so effectively to take a consolation ODI win earlier in the week. 'Bangladesh finished the innings well, we were in a position to kick on but were 20 short,' conceded Buttler, whose sixth 50 in 10 T20 international innings arrived from the first of successive sixes, soon after Phil Salt's stodgy 38 from 35 balls came to an end. Faced with a modest chase, Bangladesh turned the extra speed of England's attack against them. Rony Talukdar, making his second international appearance eight years after his first, set the tone at the top of the order before man-of-the-match Najmul Hossain Shanto and debutant Towhid Chowdhury shared a decisive stand of 65 for the third wicket. It came in no time thanks to a spree of six fours in a row between them, the latter four from Shanto off Mark Wood. Short of numbers in batting, England at least had plenty of options with the ball - seven in all - but they simply didn't have enough runs to work with and even though Wood returned to silence a vociferous and sizeable crowd by skittling Shanto's stumps following a swashbuckling 51, Shakib Al Hasan and Afif Hossain were able to toddle home in second gear. Earlier, Shanto held three catches at long-on and created a last-ball chance that fellow boundary rider Talukdar squandered as Bangladesh recovered from gifting lives to Salt and Buttler in the same Nasum Ahmed over to bring the World Cup winners back down to earth.

Holder's attacking rearguard guided the West Indies to 251 all out in 79.3 overs, something that forced South Africa into three overs of batting, which the hosts negotiated to 4/0 without undue hassles. Holder's knock meant South Africa led by just 69 runs instead of a triple-figure buffer that would've made life easier for them. Holder hadn't scored a Test half-century in 19 knocks dating back to the first Test against Pakistan in Kingston in August 2021, but when he was needed to salvage a faltering innings, he did what was asked of him. Holder, who came in at 157/5 after Joshua da Silva was castled by Simon Harmer, dominated the lower-order partnerships he shared with Alzarri Joseph (4), Kemar Roach (13), and Gudakesh Motie (17) to ensure the Windies were in a far better state. With Kagiso Rabada unable to bowl in the last session, Holder took advantage of the senior pacer's absence to help raise 134 runs for the last four wickets. It meant South Africa started and ended the day badly, even though they held sway in the middle stages of the proceedings. When South Africa lost their last three wickets in the space of 20 minutes, the stage was set for a hi-octane day of cricket under a hot sun. While wickets did fall, seven of them in the first session, the game didn't motor at a speed that would keep traffic cameras busy. What the slowed-down pace of the game did do was to expose the pitch to a sun that hardly hid under the clouds. It quickened up, something that allowed South Africa's pacers to extract more bounce and deviation from the surface. It also allowed for Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer to get more turn and bounce, even though it was far more consistent compared to day one. The fire and brimstone from the pace bowlers remained a consistent problem for the batters, with South Africa's tail not being able to cope with the heat. Heinrich Klaasen (17) though was guilty of the laziest dismissal of the day when he wafted at a wide Kyle Mayers' delivery, which was the third one of the day. After Klaasen had chased Mayers into Da Silva's gloves, Maharaj was back in the dressing room an over-and-a-half later when he clipped a nothing Joseph short-ball to Motie at midwicket. In Joseph's next over, Coetzee was bounced out, completing South Africa's collapse of 8/72, giving the West Indies more time to bat. That said, South Africa didn't waste much time in getting among the West Indians, with Tagenarine Chanderpaul (1) being run out by Temba Bavuma off the second ball of the fourth over to leave the tourists tottering at 1/1. It was the start of the bowling dry process that snared West Indian captain Kraigg Brathwaite (17), who feathered a Rabada (2/19) delivery to Dean Elgar at first slip. A total of 22/2 after 10.3 overs became 28/3 after Jermaine Blackwood was caught behind by Klaasen off Coetzee (3/41), but a 23-run partnership between Roston Chase (28) and Raymon Reifer (15) staved off a complete pre-lunch meltdown. Reifer was claimed by Coetzee when the southpaw offered a catch to De Zorzi at short-leg, something that left the West Indies reeling at 51/4. It was left to Chase and Mayers to start a repair job that came in the form of a 52-run stand for the fifth wicket. They were untroubled as the pitch quietened down and Chase, whose inconsistency with bat and ball has been a talking point, was comfortable against both spin and pace. He was out in the most unfortunate manner when he inside-edged a Wiaan Mulder (1/40) drive onto his stumps. His exit drew reticent batting from the visitors as the 13-run stand between Mayers and Da Silva spanned 56 balls. Mayers (28) was worked over by Rabada outside his off-stump and it came as no surprise when he edged Rabada to Elgar at first slip. That brought Holder to the crease and the lanky all-rounder played an innings of high quality and responsibility. His 12th Test 50 that came off 79 balls was one that contained glorious drives and some agricultural hitting. It was necessary for Holder to hit out for his partners didn't always look competent enough to stay for long at the other end. He shared a 41-run alliance with the fidgety Da Silva (26), who was bowled through the gate by Harmer, while Joseph popped a simple catch to De Zorzi at silly point off Maharaj (1/77). That meant Holder needed to take charge of the last two partnerships, which he did to a large degree as the West Indies reduced South Africa's lead to less than 100. Holder then shared a 58-run stand with Motie (17), with Holder scoring 40 of those runs which also included a missed stumping from Klaasen off Harmer (2/63). Motie gifted a catch to Bavuma at short cover off Harmer to give South Africa a nervy batting stint they navigated without too much fuss. Scores in brief: South Africa : 320 (Aiden Markram 96, Tony de Zorzi 85, Kyle Mayers 3/32, Alzarri Joseph 3/60) and 4/0 West Indies: 251(Jason Holder 81*,Mayers 29, Roston Chase 28, Joshua da Silva 26, Gerald Coetzee 3/41, Kagiso Rabada 2/19, Simon Harmer 2/63)","pubDate":"2023-03-09 17:46:46","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, Face Royal Challengers Bangalore","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/up-warriorz-eye-second-win-face-royal-challengers-bangalore/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports WPL 2023: UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, Face Royal Challengers Bangalore Alyssa Healy led UP Warriorz will look to register their second win in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League as they face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the iconic Brabourne Stadium, here on Friday.\r WPL 2023: UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, […]","content":"Mumbai, March 9: Alyssa Healy led UP Warriorz will look to register their second win in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League as they face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the iconic Brabourne Stadium, here on Friday. The UP Warriorz began their campaign at the WPL 2023 with a bang, as Grace Harris’ incredible power-hitting helped them clinch a sensational 3-wicket win against the Gujarat Giants at the DY Patil Stadium. In their opener, the Warriorz were in a spot of bother with the Giants bowling picking important wickets, however, a solid counter-attack from Kiran Navgire, Harris and Sophie Ecclestone provided the team with right amount of impetus in the home stretch, as they ran out comfortable winners on the night. Right after, Healy and co were up against the Delhi Capitals at the DY Patil Stadium. And while the result did not turn out in the Warriorz’s favour, Tahlia McGrath flexed her muscles and put on a show to remember, scoring an unbeaten 90 from 50 deliveries, smashing 11 boundaries and 4 sixes, in what was eventually a losing cause. “The UP Warriorz is in a good place right now, yes, the second game did not go as per plans for us, but this is sport and there will be a winner and a loser in the match. We have had quite a few positives in our first two games, and we will definitely look to build on that every day, and against the Royal Challengers Bangalore we hope to put our best forward and pick up crucial points. RCB have a good team and it won’t be easy at all, but as long as we can execute our plans the way we need, the Warriorz should be able to respond to whatever situation comes our way,” said captain Healy on the eve of the match. While the UP Warriorz have started their run at the tournament with some fantastic individual performances, their opponents, Royal Challengers Bangalore, are yet to register their first points and have lost three games on the bounce up until now. The Warriorz, who drafted in the young Shivali Shinde for the injured Laxmi Yadav, will be keen to ensure that the Smriti Mandhana led RCB stay down and out, for at least another game. For Alyssa Healy and co, the task on hand may not seem very tough, given the situation with the run of form, but such is the fickle nature of T20 cricket, that there aren’t any free lunches, and the Warriorz are well aware of that. And while the captain is yet to go through the gears in terms of her own form, the likes of Sophie Ecclestone, Grace Harris and Kiran Navgire and Deepti Sharma are all in great form, which augurs well for the Warriorz. UP Warriorz Squad: Alyssa Healy (Captain), Sophie Ecclestone, Deepti Sharma, Tahlia McGrath, Shabnim Ismail, Anjali Sarvani, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Parshavi Chopra, Shweta Sehrawat, S Yashasri, Kiran Navgire, Grace Harris, Devika Vaidya, Lauren Bell, Simran Shaikh, Shivali Shinde. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-03-09 16:55:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LISTEN: On ‘Talking Point’ — SA’s batting woes and Currie Cup rugby","link":"https://www.citizen.co.za/sport/listen-talking-point-batting-woes-currie-cup/","keywords":["Sport","cricket","currie cup","podcast","proteas cricket team","Rugby"],"creator":["Sports Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Is there still love and affection for the Currie Cup in South African rugby?","content":"It’s been another busy week on the cricket front with the Proteas in action in the second Test against the West Indies at the Wanderers, while the 2023 edition of the Currie Cup gets underway this weekend.

It is an accomplishment he hadn’t dreamt of, having carried the drinks on his previous tours of India in 2013 and 2017. Khawaja, Australia’s best batter on this tour, batted for six hours to grind down a quality attack, scoring an unbeaten 104 out of team’s 255 for four on Thursday. “I don’t think I have ever smiled so much on getting a century, there was emotion in it. I have done two (Test) tours of India before (2013 and 2017). Carried the drinks for eight Test matches before I got a chance here,” you could feel the pain and joy in his words. The 36-year-old lost a lot of time when Cricket Australia tried out mediocre openers like Marcus North and Chris Rogers. “Throughout the middle of my career I got told I couldn’t play spin and that’s why I never got an opportunity to play in India. “It’s just nice to go out there and tick off a hundred in India which was something if you asked me five years ago if you told me that I would think you were crazy,” Khawaja doesn’t let you miss the point as to what it meant for him. “There was a lot of emotion, I just never expected this to happen,” the Islamabad-born, Queensland-raised cricketer, said. So did he agree with that perception in Australian cricket that he couldn’t play spin” “Maybe to some extent. But think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy in its own way. People start saying that then perception is reality. Anytime I got out to spin, people were like ‘you can’t play spin’. I probably started believing it myself,” he said. No support from teams of past ====================. Khawaja lamented how the cricketing ecosystem Down Under never had his back in the early days of his career. “I didn’t really get the support from the people around me at the time. I didn’t feel like the team really supported me. I didn’t feel like the coaching staff and selectors really supported me through that journey. It just made it so hard,” he was blunt. “Whether I was or wasn’t, yes I’m a better player of spin now, no doubt about that, I have more shots, better defence. But I didn’t really get the opportunity to learn at that early stage.” So how did he turn the tables? “Fortunately enough, I am quite stubborn so went out of my own way to learn, then we had a couple of A tours here in India which helped a lot. Had to go back and figure it out all by myself.” Source link","pubDate":"2023-03-09 15:32:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MCA Six a Side Tournament at Galle International Stadium","link":"http://island.lk/mca-six-a-side-tournament-at-galle-international-stadium/","keywords":["Sports","Featured"],"creator":["Thilina Walpola"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Mercantile Cricket Association (MCA) for the first time in their 112 year cricketing history, will venture out to conduct a tournament at an outstation venue.

A former official of the Netball Federation of Sri Lanka Yasmin Dharmaratne was the chief guest while Damayanthi Jayathilaka was the Guest of Honour. NFSL president Lakshmi Victoria also graced the occasion. Published on By Impressive knocks from almost the entirety of the Sri Lankan top order, particularly Kusal Mendis, gave Sri Lanka a promising start in their pursuit of an unlikely World Test Championship final berth, as they put up 305 for 6 on the opening day of the first Test at Hagley Oval. However the persistence of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up five wickets between them, ensured the visitors would at no point run away with proceedings. At the close of play Dhananjaya de Silva was at the crease unbeaten on 39, with Kasun Rajitha alongside him on 16. That Rajitha is even at the crease with just six wickets down speaks towards the length of Sri Lanka’s tail. Rajitha, however to his credit, has thus far provided an able foil during the 37-run stand. The first hour or so of the morning session saw Henry and Southee beat the edge with regularity, and their relentless lines and lengths – just outside off, angled in, shaping away, off a good length – eventually paid off. Ironically, it was one drifting down leg that did the trick, as Oshada Fernando was strangled down leg. That however brought Mendis to the crease, and Sri Lanka’s approach was transformed. Carrying over his recent white-ball form, Mendis accounted for 15 of the 21 boundaries scored in the session, on the way to a 51-ball 73 at the break – he would end on 87 off 83. His partnership with Dimuth Karunaratne meanwhile would yield 137. A majority of his scoring came on the leg side, particularly behind square. Henry and Neil Wagner were punished as they looked to test the diminutive Lankan with some short stuff, while Southee and Blair Tickner were whipped in front of square for deliveries that veered a little too full or straight. There were a few dicey cuts over gully as well, but Mendis’ only genuine moment of peril came when he was yet to get off the mark. A ball nipping back off a good length had seen him struck in front of middle on the back pad. The umpire felt this was hitting middle and off, but DRS showed the ball bouncing over the stumps – something neither the New Zealand players nor on-air commentators could quite believe. Mendis’ aggression coincided with New Zealand’s seamers losing the lengths that had served them so well in the early part of the morning. They would correct this after lunch, however, and within the first hour of the second session they would see the backs of both Mendis and Karunaratne.

Published on By Hillwood Club girls from Kandy swept the boards at the ‘One-Whistle’ Invitational Netball Tournament conducted by the Colombo Malay Cricket Club (CMCC) to mark its 150th-anniversary celebrations which began in March 2022. The tournament held at the Padang on Sunday (March 5) was played in a carnival atmosphere with the participation of 20 teams including two men’s teams from Monaragala and Ratnapura who featured in an exhibition match. Organised under the supervision of former national captain and Asia Cup-winning coach Hyacinth Wijesinghe, a unique feature of this tournament was that matches were played simultaneously on four courts beginning and ending with one whistle during the league stage with a running clock of seven minutes in each half with an interval of one minute. Piyaratne, Padukka emerged champions in the Under 15 school final defeating Yasodara Balika 9-7. Hillwood Club won the club final defeating Kalutara Balika 11-7. The Veterans final was won by Track Master who beat Police 7-4. Hillwood carried away the special awards with Kusalika Aluwihare crowned CMCC Netball Queen, Yuthara Rajaratnam (Best Centre Court player), Lakshika Aluwihare (Best Defensive Player) and Vichali Mawilmada (Best Shooter) bagging other awards. A former official of the Netball Federation of Sri Lanka Yasmin Dharmaratne was the chief guest while Damayanthi Jayathilaka was the Guest of Honour. NFSL president Lakshmi Victoria also graced the occasion. Published on By Impressive knocks from almost the entirety of the Sri Lankan top order, particularly Kusal Mendis, gave Sri Lanka a promising start in their pursuit of an unlikely World Test Championship final berth, as they put up 305 for 6 on the opening day of the first Test at Hagley Oval. However the persistence of Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who picked up five wickets between them, ensured the visitors would at no point run away with proceedings. At the close of play Dhananjaya de Silva was at the crease unbeaten on 39, with Kasun Rajitha alongside him on 16. That Rajitha is even at the crease with just six wickets down speaks towards the length of Sri Lanka’s tail. Rajitha, however to his credit, has thus far provided an able foil during the 37-run stand. The first hour or so of the morning session saw Henry and Southee beat the edge with regularity, and their relentless lines and lengths – just outside off, angled in, shaping away, off a good length – eventually paid off. Ironically, it was one drifting down leg that did the trick, as Oshada Fernando was strangled down leg. That however brought Mendis to the crease, and Sri Lanka’s approach was transformed. Carrying over his recent white-ball form, Mendis accounted for 15 of the 21 boundaries scored in the session, on the way to a 51-ball 73 at the break – he would end on 87 off 83. His partnership with Dimuth Karunaratne meanwhile would yield 137. A majority of his scoring came on the leg side, particularly behind square. Henry and Neil Wagner were punished as they looked to test the diminutive Lankan with some short stuff, while Southee and Blair Tickner were whipped in front of square for deliveries that veered a little too full or straight. There were a few dicey cuts over gully as well, but Mendis’ only genuine moment of peril came when he was yet to get off the mark. A ball nipping back off a good length had seen him struck in front of middle on the back pad. The umpire felt this was hitting middle and off, but DRS showed the ball bouncing over the stumps – something neither the New Zealand players nor on-air commentators could quite believe. Mendis’ aggression coincided with New Zealand’s seamers losing the lengths that had served them so well in the early part of the morning. They would correct this after lunch, however, and within the first hour of the second session they would see the backs of both Mendis and Karunaratne. Mendis was surprised by one that jagged back in off a length from outside off, as he failed to offer a stroke and was struck on the back leg, while Karunaratne was out caught on a loose drive an over later, offering a thick edge to second slip.

Jos Buttler's team featured seven of those that defeated Pakistan in Melbourne last November, but crucially were missing three frontline batters and it told as they were condemned to a six-wicket defeat with two overs unused by opponents that had lost 22 of their previous 25 T20s against fellow Test nations. Aside from captain Buttler's power-packed contribution of 67 and a cameo from Ben Duckett, there was a distinct lack of fluency about England's innings and in an anaemic end just 21 runs came from the final four overs. It proved the decisive period of the contest. Ironically, one player who had shown an ability to thrive in these conditions by hitting a match-winning hundred during England's one-day series win, Jason Roy left this tour on Tuesday and crunched a breathtaking, unbeaten 63-ball 145 in the Pakistan Super League 24 hours later. The England selectors did not want to ask a player they dumped on the eve of last year's World Cup to stay on as Will Jacks' injury replacement, foregoing a franchise fee in the process, or indeed ask another PSL participant to hot-foot it across Asia, so instead opted to stick with what they had. Bangladesh's Najmul Hossain Shanto hits out during his innings of 51 off 30 deliveries Shanto carved the England bowling attack, including Mark Wood, for eight boundaries Shanto celebrates his half-century in front of an enthusiastic crowd in Chattogram It means the tourists will use Moeen Ali and Sam Curran at numbers five and six throughout the three games and when Duckett and Buttler were dismissed from consecutive deliveries, it meant the make-do pairing came together at 135 for four, with 23 deliveries to come. Backed up by the more established duo of Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed, death specialist Hasan Mahmud was at his stingy best, denying his opponents any pace to work with at a ground where the Bangladeshis squeezed so effectively to take a consolation ODI win earlier in the week. 'Bangladesh finished the innings well, we were in a position to kick on but were 20 short,' conceded Buttler, whose sixth 50 in 10 T20 international innings arrived from the first of successive sixes, soon after Phil Salt's stodgy 38 from 35 balls came to an end. Faced with a modest chase, Bangladesh turned the extra speed of England's attack against them. Rony Talukdar, making his second international appearance eight years after his first, set the tone at the top of the order before man-of-the-match Najmul Hossain Shanto and debutant Towhid Chowdhury shared a decisive stand of 65 for the third wicket. It came in no time thanks to a spree of six fours in a row between them, the latter four from Shanto off Mark Wood. Short of numbers in batting, England at least had plenty of options with the ball - seven in all - but they simply didn't have enough runs to work with and even though Wood returned to silence a vociferous and sizeable crowd by skittling Shanto's stumps following a swashbuckling 51, Shakib Al Hasan and Afif Hossain were able to toddle home in second gear. Earlier, Shanto held three catches at long-on and created a last-ball chance that fellow boundary rider Talukdar squandered as Bangladesh recovered from gifting lives to Salt and Buttler in the same Nasum Ahmed over to bring the World Cup winners back down to earth.

Holder's attacking rearguard guided the West Indies to 251 all out in 79.3 overs, something that forced South Africa into three overs of batting, which the hosts negotiated to 4/0 without undue hassles. Holder's knock meant South Africa led by just 69 runs instead of a triple-figure buffer that would've made life easier for them. Holder hadn't scored a Test half-century in 19 knocks dating back to the first Test against Pakistan in Kingston in August 2021, but when he was needed to salvage a faltering innings, he did what was asked of him. Holder, who came in at 157/5 after Joshua da Silva was castled by Simon Harmer, dominated the lower-order partnerships he shared with Alzarri Joseph (4), Kemar Roach (13), and Gudakesh Motie (17) to ensure the Windies were in a far better state. With Kagiso Rabada unable to bowl in the last session, Holder took advantage of the senior pacer's absence to help raise 134 runs for the last four wickets. It meant South Africa started and ended the day badly, even though they held sway in the middle stages of the proceedings. When South Africa lost their last three wickets in the space of 20 minutes, the stage was set for a hi-octane day of cricket under a hot sun. While wickets did fall, seven of them in the first session, the game didn't motor at a speed that would keep traffic cameras busy. What the slowed-down pace of the game did do was to expose the pitch to a sun that hardly hid under the clouds. It quickened up, something that allowed South Africa's pacers to extract more bounce and deviation from the surface. It also allowed for Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer to get more turn and bounce, even though it was far more consistent compared to day one. The fire and brimstone from the pace bowlers remained a consistent problem for the batters, with South Africa's tail not being able to cope with the heat. Heinrich Klaasen (17) though was guilty of the laziest dismissal of the day when he wafted at a wide Kyle Mayers' delivery, which was the third one of the day. After Klaasen had chased Mayers into Da Silva's gloves, Maharaj was back in the dressing room an over-and-a-half later when he clipped a nothing Joseph short-ball to Motie at midwicket. In Joseph's next over, Coetzee was bounced out, completing South Africa's collapse of 8/72, giving the West Indies more time to bat. That said, South Africa didn't waste much time in getting among the West Indians, with Tagenarine Chanderpaul (1) being run out by Temba Bavuma off the second ball of the fourth over to leave the tourists tottering at 1/1. It was the start of the bowling dry process that snared West Indian captain Kraigg Brathwaite (17), who feathered a Rabada (2/19) delivery to Dean Elgar at first slip. A total of 22/2 after 10.3 overs became 28/3 after Jermaine Blackwood was caught behind by Klaasen off Coetzee (3/41), but a 23-run partnership between Roston Chase (28) and Raymon Reifer (15) staved off a complete pre-lunch meltdown. Reifer was claimed by Coetzee when the southpaw offered a catch to De Zorzi at short-leg, something that left the West Indies reeling at 51/4. It was left to Chase and Mayers to start a repair job that came in the form of a 52-run stand for the fifth wicket. They were untroubled as the pitch quietened down and Chase, whose inconsistency with bat and ball has been a talking point, was comfortable against both spin and pace. He was out in the most unfortunate manner when he inside-edged a Wiaan Mulder (1/40) drive onto his stumps. His exit drew reticent batting from the visitors as the 13-run stand between Mayers and Da Silva spanned 56 balls. Mayers (28) was worked over by Rabada outside his off-stump and it came as no surprise when he edged Rabada to Elgar at first slip. That brought Holder to the crease and the lanky all-rounder played an innings of high quality and responsibility. His 12th Test 50 that came off 79 balls was one that contained glorious drives and some agricultural hitting. It was necessary for Holder to hit out for his partners didn't always look competent enough to stay for long at the other end. He shared a 41-run alliance with the fidgety Da Silva (26), who was bowled through the gate by Harmer, while Joseph popped a simple catch to De Zorzi at silly point off Maharaj (1/77). That meant Holder needed to take charge of the last two partnerships, which he did to a large degree as the West Indies reduced South Africa's lead to less than 100. Holder then shared a 58-run stand with Motie (17), with Holder scoring 40 of those runs which also included a missed stumping from Klaasen off Harmer (2/63). Motie gifted a catch to Bavuma at short cover off Harmer to give South Africa a nervy batting stint they navigated without too much fuss. Scores in brief: South Africa : 320 (Aiden Markram 96, Tony de Zorzi 85, Kyle Mayers 3/32, Alzarri Joseph 3/60) and 4/0 West Indies: 251(Jason Holder 81*,Mayers 29, Roston Chase 28, Joshua da Silva 26, Gerald Coetzee 3/41, Kagiso Rabada 2/19, Simon Harmer 2/63)","pubDate":"2023-03-09 17:46:46","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, Face Royal Challengers Bangalore","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/up-warriorz-eye-second-win-face-royal-challengers-bangalore/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports WPL 2023: UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, Face Royal Challengers Bangalore Alyssa Healy led UP Warriorz will look to register their second win in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League as they face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the iconic Brabourne Stadium, here on Friday.\r WPL 2023: UP Warriorz Eye Second Win, […]","content":"Mumbai, March 9: Alyssa Healy led UP Warriorz will look to register their second win in the inaugural edition of the Women’s Premier League as they face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the iconic Brabourne Stadium, here on Friday. The UP Warriorz began their campaign at the WPL 2023 with a bang, as Grace Harris’ incredible power-hitting helped them clinch a sensational 3-wicket win against the Gujarat Giants at the DY Patil Stadium. In their opener, the Warriorz were in a spot of bother with the Giants bowling picking important wickets, however, a solid counter-attack from Kiran Navgire, Harris and Sophie Ecclestone provided the team with right amount of impetus in the home stretch, as they ran out comfortable winners on the night. Right after, Healy and co were up against the Delhi Capitals at the DY Patil Stadium. And while the result did not turn out in the Warriorz’s favour, Tahlia McGrath flexed her muscles and put on a show to remember, scoring an unbeaten 90 from 50 deliveries, smashing 11 boundaries and 4 sixes, in what was eventually a losing cause. “The UP Warriorz is in a good place right now, yes, the second game did not go as per plans for us, but this is sport and there will be a winner and a loser in the match. We have had quite a few positives in our first two games, and we will definitely look to build on that every day, and against the Royal Challengers Bangalore we hope to put our best forward and pick up crucial points. RCB have a good team and it won’t be easy at all, but as long as we can execute our plans the way we need, the Warriorz should be able to respond to whatever situation comes our way,” said captain Healy on the eve of the match. While the UP Warriorz have started their run at the tournament with some fantastic individual performances, their opponents, Royal Challengers Bangalore, are yet to register their first points and have lost three games on the bounce up until now. The Warriorz, who drafted in the young Shivali Shinde for the injured Laxmi Yadav, will be keen to ensure that the Smriti Mandhana led RCB stay down and out, for at least another game. For Alyssa Healy and co, the task on hand may not seem very tough, given the situation with the run of form, but such is the fickle nature of T20 cricket, that there aren’t any free lunches, and the Warriorz are well aware of that. And while the captain is yet to go through the gears in terms of her own form, the likes of Sophie Ecclestone, Grace Harris and Kiran Navgire and Deepti Sharma are all in great form, which augurs well for the Warriorz. UP Warriorz Squad: Alyssa Healy (Captain), Sophie Ecclestone, Deepti Sharma, Tahlia McGrath, Shabnim Ismail, Anjali Sarvani, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Parshavi Chopra, Shweta Sehrawat, S Yashasri, Kiran Navgire, Grace Harris, Devika Vaidya, Lauren Bell, Simran Shaikh, Shivali Shinde. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-03-09 16:55:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LISTEN: On ‘Talking Point’ — SA’s batting woes and Currie Cup rugby","link":"https://www.citizen.co.za/sport/listen-talking-point-batting-woes-currie-cup/","keywords":["Sport","cricket","currie cup","podcast","proteas cricket team","Rugby"],"creator":["Sports Reporter"],"video_url":null,"description":"Is there still love and affection for the Currie Cup in South African rugby?","content":"It’s been another busy week on the cricket front with the Proteas in action in the second Test against the West Indies at the Wanderers, while the 2023 edition of the Currie Cup gets underway this weekend.

It is an accomplishment he hadn’t dreamt of, having carried the drinks on his previous tours of India in 2013 and 2017. Khawaja, Australia’s best batter on this tour, batted for six hours to grind down a quality attack, scoring an unbeaten 104 out of team’s 255 for four on Thursday. “I don’t think I have ever smiled so much on getting a century, there was emotion in it. I have done two (Test) tours of India before (2013 and 2017). Carried the drinks for eight Test matches before I got a chance here,” you could feel the pain and joy in his words. The 36-year-old lost a lot of time when Cricket Australia tried out mediocre openers like Marcus North and Chris Rogers. “Throughout the middle of my career I got told I couldn’t play spin and that’s why I never got an opportunity to play in India. “It’s just nice to go out there and tick off a hundred in India which was something if you asked me five years ago if you told me that I would think you were crazy,” Khawaja doesn’t let you miss the point as to what it meant for him. “There was a lot of emotion, I just never expected this to happen,” the Islamabad-born, Queensland-raised cricketer, said. So did he agree with that perception in Australian cricket that he couldn’t play spin” “Maybe to some extent. But think it was a self-fulfilling prophecy in its own way. People start saying that then perception is reality. Anytime I got out to spin, people were like ‘you can’t play spin’. I probably started believing it myself,” he said. No support from teams of past ====================. Khawaja lamented how the cricketing ecosystem Down Under never had his back in the early days of his career. “I didn’t really get the support from the people around me at the time. I didn’t feel like the team really supported me. I didn’t feel like the coaching staff and selectors really supported me through that journey. It just made it so hard,” he was blunt. “Whether I was or wasn’t, yes I’m a better player of spin now, no doubt about that, I have more shots, better defence. But I didn’t really get the opportunity to learn at that early stage.” So how did he turn the tables? “Fortunately enough, I am quite stubborn so went out of my own way to learn, then we had a couple of A tours here in India which helped a lot. Had to go back and figure it out all by myself.” Source link","pubDate":"2023-03-09 15:32:59","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"}]}
