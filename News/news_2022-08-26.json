The iconic firebrand has confirmed he has been forced to quit the national broadcaster over a clash of his media roles. The Australian first revealed the West Australian has been locked out because of the ABC’s policy banning its employees from working with the network while they have an association with a betting agency.

Australia has a busy schedule in coming months before the T20 World Cup on home soil, beginning in October. The Aussie men’s cricket team has limited overs series against Zimbabwe, New Zealand, West Indies, India and England before then. Johnson’s withdrawal and the recent retirement of former Aussie test captain Ian Chappell leaves the ABC with a huge hole to fill. Johnson told News Corp the ABC’s decision to enforce the gambling policy left him blown away. “I have really enjoyed working with the ABC team over recent seasons and was looking forward to doing it again,” Johnson told the ABC.

I don’t understand and you start to wonder about what you can and can’t say if you are calling for them. “It’s blown me away a little bit: do we have to make sure we have to align with the ABC’s moral compass? There’s nothing I can do about it … that’s the rule and I guess I’m not going to work with them.” The West Australian reports Johnson has been contacted by Triple M and is considering an option to join the commercial network’s cricket coverage this summer. Johnson’s deal with betting agency Bet Nation expires in November, but the ABC has ruled the clash is a conflict of interest. Johnson’s position is one of several moves that have played out recently in Australian cricket commentary roles. It was announced last month former Australian men’s coach Justin Langer will join Channel 7’s commentary team for the upcoming home summer of cricket. Meanwhile, there was big news in Australian cricket on Thursday with former Brisbane Heat captain Chris Lynn signing an unprecedented deal with Cricket Australia and the Adelaide Strikers. Lynn will be available for 11 of the Strikers’ 14 home and away fixtures this summer after reaching a compromise with CA that allowed him to compete in a high-paying overseas domestic league during the BBL window.","pubDate":"2022-08-25 22:58:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ex-England star Gary Ballance apologises to Azeem Rafiq for using ‘unacceptable and racist’ language while at Yorkshire","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/19621203/gary-ballance-azeem-rafiq-apology-racist-language-yorkshire/","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["John Etheridge"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"GARY BALLANCE has apologised to Azeem Rafiq for using “unacceptable and racist” language during their time together at Yorkshire.

The Parade Grounds in Secunderabad which had several mud pitches side by side was a spectacle for the cricket enthusiast specially on a week end which was generally the schedule for league matches. Last fortnight I had the opportunity to be escorted by a friend of mine who claimed repeatedly that there were more than a hundred cricket turf pitches in and around the city of Hyderabad. We have a group of friends who play matches and tournaments on weekends on some of these venues. I was also given to understand that tournaments between teams such as hotels, corporates, airlines and community clubs are conducted by some organisations who collect entry fees and do a fabulous professional job providing facilities such as coloured clothing, white ball, and the entire paraphernalia that would sometimes be better than the first class matches of the BCCI. My visit to these venues and getting a firsthand experience reinforced my view that the game of cricket has come a long way in our city. As illustrated above there have been positive and phenomenal changes that have taken place. This calls for a change in mindset and the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad cricket requires to be extended to these so called club teams and venues. As the first reformation that should take place is to offer affiliation afresh such that only clubs that have the facilities of a cricket ground with turf pitches of a certain minimum standard shall be a part of Hyderabad Cricket Association. This will not only enable our cricket to evolve but also provide an opportunity to thousands of these cricketers to play in tournaments that are blessed by the association and therefore talent coming from these areas is recognised and nurtured. Also several clubs which are existing only on paper are weeded out from the system to enable the new ones to replace them. In the recent past decade, there has been a spurt of cricket academies which has also enabled scientific and purposeful cricket coaching. This could be an opportunity for their players to participate in the mainstream talent search of the State. There is a saying that extra ordinary situations require responses which are out of the box. This creation of outstanding infrastructure coupled by the enthusiasm of thousands of amateur cricket players could be channelised to allow the standard of the game to reach its pinnacle in our city of Hyderabad and State of Telangana.

Team Pakistan’s head coach and former spinner Saqlain Mushtaq has spread the message of humanity and universal brotherhood, as India and Pakistan fans brace themselves to cheer for their respective teams in the Asia Cup 2022 group stage clash on August 28. While the on-field clash is nearer than ever, the off-field emotions of fans and former cricketers from both the nations have gone a notch up, as each claim to have an upper-hand ahead of the contest, especially since the exit news of the champions pacers – Jasprit Bumrah and Shaheen Shah Afridi have come to the fore. Amidst all of this, the pictures and videos of the champion batters from both the sides – Babar Azam and Virat Kohli also went viral across the social media platforms, as the duo warmly met each other ahead of the practice session. Spreading the much important message of peace and universal brotherhood, especially with regard to the seemingly never-ending political tension between both the countries, the Pakistan head coach Saqlain Mushtaq recollected a half-a-decade old memory, which is still afresh in his psyche. Interacting with the members of the press on Thursday, who were keen for his remarks on the Virat-Babar meet yesterday, Mushtaq recounted how during the Cricket-All-Stars series 2015/16 in USA, of which he was a part as well, he witnessed fans from India and Pakistan stitching together both the nation’s flags as one, instead of holding them separately during one of the matches. “A few years ago, I went to play in the Cricket-All-Stars tournament, where 25 cricketers from the world were invited by Sachin and Warne. Back then, I had tweeted as well, how Pakistani and Indian fans, who were the only ones following this tournament in America, had stitched both the countries’ flags as one, instead of waving them separately. Then during the next match, flags from other countries too were knitted together. I had then tweeted how this sport is not solely for the purpose of entertainment, but also for spreading the concept of humanity and universal brotherhood,” exclaimed Mushtaq.

Kagiso Rabada starred with both bat and ball as the Proteas fought back, the fast bowler top-scoring with 36 and then dismissing star batsman Joe Root for just nine as England, bidding to level this three-match series at 1-1, slumped to 43-3. But by stumps England had recovered to 111-3, a deficit of 40 runs, with struggling opener Zak Crawley surviving to be 17 not out off 77 balls. By contrast Jonny Bairstow was 38 not out off 45 balls, including six typically well-struck fours, during an unbroken stand of 68 with Crawley. South Africa's innings ended in sunshine but the improved batting conditions initially did England little good, with Alex Lees caught behind off Lungi Ngidi before Ollie Pope, who made a promising 23, was clean bowled by a 90 mph delivery from express quick Anrich Nortje . Rabada then dismissed Root for his third low score this series, although first slip Sarel Erwee needed four attempts to hold the outside edge. Anderson, who has now played in 97 Tests in England and three in Wales, had earlier made the initial breakthrough when -- bowling from the end named after him on his Lancashire home ground -- he removed Erwee during a morning session where the Proteas slumped to 77-5 at lunch. The 40-year-old England great then struck twice in two balls to reduce South Africa to 92-7 on his way to a return of 3-32 in 15 overs. But Rabada and Nortje (10) checked England's progress with a ninth-wicket partnership of 35. That stand ended with the very first ball after tea when recalled seamer Ollie Robinson had Nortje lbw before Rabada was last man out after edging left-arm spinner Jack Leach to Root at slip. South Africa captain Dean Elgar , with the Proteas top of the World Test Championship table despite a fallible top order, took a calculated risk in batting first upon winning the toss despite overcast conditions that favoured fast bowling. Harmer recalled His thinking was influenced by the recall of off-spinner Simon Harmer in place of left-arm quick Marco Jansen , unfortunate to be dropped in the only change to the team that overwhelmed England by an innings and 12 runs in the first Test at Lord's last week. The pitch is expected to offer more turn later in the game. Anderson struck in just the fifth over when Erwee, fresh from a fine 73 at Lord's, was well caught by diving wicketkeeper Ben Foakes off an inside edge for three. Fellow opener Elgar had a couple of reprieves before he fell for 12, with Robinson, in for Matthew Potts in the only change to England's side at Lord's, denied his wicket by a marginal no-ball. Stuart Broad , on as first change, twice beat Elgar before he dismissed him, Bairstow holding a good low catch at third slip. Broad then removed Keegan Petersen (21) with another catch in the cordon during a return of 3-37 in 11 overs. Stokes (2-17) got in on the act with just his third ball when Aiden Markram (14) top-edged a pull to Foakes before Rassie van der Dussen (16) was lbw after the all-rounder's raucous appeal was confirmed on the batsman's review. Anderson, yet to take a hat-trick in an illustrious career that has seen him become the most successful fast bowler in Test history, went close on Thursday. Promoted He had Harmer and Keshav Maharaj plumb lbw with successive deliveries only to spear the hat-trick ball, to Rabada, well down the legside.

The post New York Jets’ Laken Tomlinson driven by loss of first-born daughter appeared first on CHEK.","content":"Laken Tomlinson took off his New York Jets cap, folded his hands in front of his face and cried. The grief of losing his daughter 18 days after she was born is still raw and painful. The tears are part of the healing process, one that has taken three years for the 30-year-old offensive lineman. And one he’s not sure will ever truly end. “I love my family,” Tomlinson said in an interview with The Associated Press. “On game day, I play for my family. On game day, I play for her. Every game. “I break down in tears before every game since. Because she’s pushing me right now.” Rachel Tomlinson gave birth to Claire Abigail via a scheduled cesarean section in 2019. The baby girl was premature, but the Tomlinsons didn’t expect the tragedy they experienced less than three weeks later when they left the hospital — without her. “I’ve always been blessed for a lot of opportunities I’ve had,” Laken Tomlinson said. “And I’ve never really taken anything for granted. But I never really wanted something so badly in my life.” Tomlinson prefers keeping the details of what happened private, and only now has begun talking publicly about the emotional aftermath for his family. “I can’t give you too much more,” he said softly. “It’s just too dark.” He wept when he recently spoke for the first time publicly about losing his daughter on the Jets’ “One Jets Drive” documentary series. Tomlinson, a long-time mental health advocate, has leaned on his wife, his mother Audrey Wilson and other family members who offered encouragement and love. “If I didn’t have those people in my corner, I don’t think I’d be here in front of you now,” Tomlinson said. “I’d probably be somewhere else, I don’t know.” Many of Tomlinson’s teammates and friends are now finding out about the private hell he dealt with while trying to excel on the field. “I’m not really a personal person,” he said. “Especially on the field, I try to keep everything very professional. I don’t like my personal life really out there because at the end of the day, I’m a football player. I’m here to entertain the fans, right? “But, you know, I’m also a person. I’m also a father. A husband. A son.” One whose journey has taken him from the cricket and soccer fields of Savanna-la-Mar, Jamaica, where he was born, to the Rogers Park section of Chicago with his family when he was 11. Tomlinson became a two-sport star, in football and track and field, after a growth spurt early in high school. That’s also when Tomlinson was sent down his next path — after his grandfather died from internal bleeding due to stomach ulcers while visiting Jamaica. “It affected me a lot, just who I was as a young man at the time,” Tomlinson said. “It made me question a lot of things around me.” Writing a paper for an English class comparing the health care system in Jamaica to those in other countries sparked a passion for medicine. His next stop was Duke, where he balanced playing football with being a pre-med double-major in evolutionary anthropology and psychology. Tomlinson already has big plans for after he has played his last snap: Medical school, becoming a doctor and opening a hospital in Jamaica — in his grandfather’s honor. “That’s my ultimate dream,” he said. “My ultimate goal.” Until then, he’s living out another of his dreams in the NFL. A first-round draft pick of Detroit in 2015, Tomlinson struggled at times early as a pro. Then came a trip to a barber shop in Irvine, California, where the barber mentioned one of his customers worked with offensive linemen. It was Pro Football Hall of Famer Jackie Slater, who took Tomlinson — who wears No. 78 with the Jets because of him — under his wing. A trade before the 2017 season led Tomlinson to San Francisco, where he developed into one of the game’s top left guards — with current Jets coach Robert Saleh, then the 49ers’ defensive coordinator, witnessing his improvement. Five years later, the Jets gave Tomlinson — who made the Pro Bowl last season — a three-year, $40 million deal to be their left guard. “He’s as well-mannered and well-spoken as you can get,” Saleh said. “Then you get in the meeting room, same thing — he’s very thoughtful. “And then he puts the helmet on and something crazy happens. He’s like the Jekyll-Hyde thing, especially on gameday. He will headbutt you if you’re in his way. He’s a whack job on gameday.” Because Tomlinson is driven to overcome every obstacle he faces. Tomlinson and his wife found strength in each other in the months after losing Claire Abigail. And in 2020, Rachel Tomlinson gave birth to the couple’s second daughter: Taylor Rose. “The most beautiful girl in the world,” the proud father said with a huge smile. He video chats every night with his wife and 2-year-old daughter, who are still living in San Francisco. But they’re never far from his mind — on or off the field. And neither is the baby girl whose memory drives him every day. “If I could just help one person out there, I feel like I’ve done something good,” Tomlinson said. “Our family and the people we have in our life means so much to me. It means so much to you. And don’t ever shy away from a helping hand because you just don’t know how much you can benefit from just one person. “It could just take one person to change your whole life. And I feel like that’s been happening to me over and over again my entire life.” The post New York Jets’ Laken Tomlinson driven by loss of first-born daughter appeared first on CHEK.","pubDate":"2022-08-25 17:31:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"cheknews","country":["canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Against the Law: The origin of the spitball and emery ball","link":"https://www.pinstripealley.com/2022/8/25/23318455/mlb-history-illegal-pitches-spitball-emery-ball-yankees-russ-ford","keywords":null,"creator":["John Griffin"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Over the past week, we’ve taken a dive into the history books to discuss how several of baseball’s most popular pitches came into existence. We’ve gone over how Fred Goldsmith and Candy Cummings each claimed to invent the curveball , pinpointed the knuckleball to either Toad Ramsey or Eddie Cicotte, found two possible origins for the slider separated by two decades, and traced the evolution of the splitter from the fastball and changeup through the forkball to the modern-day pitch. What we have not yet discussed, however, is where we will wrap up our series today: illegal pitches. Although it returned to public prominence last season with the Spider Tack controversy, ball doctoring has been a part of baseball since the beginning. Actually, I take that back — it has been a part of baseball since before its beginning. Both baseball and cricket, the two most widely played bat-and-ball sports around the globe, have involved legal and illegal ball tampering over the course of their histories. This shared history suggests that the practice of applying spit or sweat to the ball, polishing it, or scuffing it predate both sports, and instead have their origins in the early bat-and-ball games that they both evolved from. Unfortunately, due to the lack of literary evidence surrounding these games, it’s impossible to know whether this early tampering was considered fair play or not. It also makes it difficult to track its evolution in early baseball. Difficult — but somehow, not impossible. Pitchers had been throwing spitballs, the most well-known pitch that would become illegal, for decades before the National League and American League partnered up at the dawn of the 20th century. Although Elmer Stricklett had historically been credited as the first spitballer in the league, this has been disproven. According to records from the early 1900s, it appears that Frank Corridan introduced it to professional ball. Outfielder and teammate George Hildebrand helped him refine the pitch, then taught it to Stricklett, who popularized its use in the major leagues. At the time, the legality of the spitball was questionable. There were rules on the books dating back to the 1890s that forbid pitchers from discoloring or damaging the baseball. Based on the way it was worded, it was not clear whether or not the application of spit to the ball fell under this rule. In part due to this ambiguity, but also to the weakness of the punishment if it was deemed illegal (just a $5 fine, roughly the equivalent of $150 today), the spitball spread throughout the game. Around this time, a Canadian minor leaguer by the name of Russ Ford discovered in 1907 that a ball that has been scuffed can be manipulated in ways a smooth ball couldn’t after the ball he was using to warm up before a game struck a concrete pillar. Recognizing its potential on the diamond, Ford began hiding a piece of emery paper in his glove, covering it up by claiming to be a spitballer. In doing so, he became a sensational pitcher for the nascent Highlanders and posted one of the best rookie seasons in Yankees history in 1910. Thanks to Ford’s catcher Ed Sweeney, the emery ball as it was called began to spread throughout the league. Finally, in 1914, its use was made public, as the Yankees’ Ray Keating was found with emery paper in his glove. This prompted MLB not only to crack down on its usage by increasing the fines to $100 (roughly the equivalent of $3000), they also began removing balls that had been scuffed from play to prevent pitchers from being unintentionally given the opportunity to throw it. By this point, public opinion began to turn against the spitball as well, leading to its eventual ban in 1920, although because a handful of pitchers were grandfathered in, it didn’t completely leave the game of baseball until 1934. While it’s clear that pitchers have continued to use illegal substances during games to doctor the baseball, they’ve had to do so discreetly — à la Gaylord Perry — in order to avoid a suspension and a fine. Still, even if doctoring the ball still happened long after it was banned, it never quite shaped an era quite like the spitball and the emery ball did to the first two decades of the 20th century.","pubDate":"2022-08-25 17:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"pinstripealley","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“I will blame the captain”: Danish Kaneria blames Babar Azam for Shaheen Afridi’s knee injury which ruled him out of Asia Cup 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-i-will-blame-the-captain-danish-kaneria-blames-babar-azam-for-shaheen-afridis-knee-injury-which-ruled-him-out-of-asia-cup-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Asia Cup 2022","babar azam","Danish Kaneria"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Danish Kaneria blames Babar Azam for not paying heed to Shaheen Shah Afridi’s workload management ahead of Asia Cup 2022.

Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has come down on Pakistan skipper Babar Azam, for carelessly handling the team’s champion fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi’s knee injury, which he had picked up during the first Test match of the tour of Sri Lanka at the Galle International Stadium last month. Failing to recover, the 22-year-old was ruled out the previous week from the imminent Asia Cup 2022, and from the seven-match T20I series at home against England next month as well, as the board wishes to keep him fit and ready for the ICC T20 World Cup which would follow next. It is worth of a mention that Afridi was part of the team squad that left for the Netherlands to partake in the three-match ODI series a few days ago alongside a couple of doctors, in order to manage his “long-term workload and health”. However, despite it all, just a day before the final ODI, the ace pacer was ruled out of Cricketing action for the next four-six weeks, as advised by the PCB’s medical advisory committee.

I will blame the captain; I will blame the selection committee and their management. You see a guy who’s been a wicket-taker, who’s been phenomenal with the white ball and a great fast bowler. But, you’ll need to make him rest, he will break down one day. And now Pakistan are without Shaheen Shah Afridi, who will take wickets?,” exclaimed Kaneria during an interaction with the news media outlet News18. The 41-year-old also questioned India’s wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul’s place in the team’s Asia Cup 2022 squad, and was also critical of Virat Kohli’s decision to skip team India’s tour of West Indies, despite being out of form.

Former India captain Virat Kohli is among the limelight since India’s first practice session ahead of Asia Cup 2022 was concluded in Dubai yesterday. Photos and clips from the training session have been doing the rounds across social media platform since last night. Among the firsts to bat in the Indian nets, Kohli was seen attacking the bowlers, especially spinners. Looking to play in the ‘V’, Kohli is said to have batted for a comparatively longer session. With the Pakistani squad arriving for training at the same venue, Kohli shook hands with Pakistan captain Babar Azam. The affectionate video has since gardened a lot of views as the prospect of India-Pakistan cricketers sharing a sight is rare in modern-day cricket. For the unversed, it was Azam who took to his social media handles to wish Kohli luck when he was struggling for runs last month. Danish Kaneria reckons Virat Kohli should have missed IPL 2022 than international cricket Not that Kohli has regained his form but an imminent Asia Cup will provide him with yet another opportunity of ending an elongated rut. Part of India’s 15-member squad, Kohli will play in the top-order alongside captain Rohit Sharma and vice-captain KL Rahul. Speaking in an interview with cricketnext.com, former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria has opined that Kohli should have missed the second half of Indian Premier League 2022 than missing international cricket. A dismal IPL 2022 in spite of repeated chances by Royal Challengers Bangalore had witnessed Kohli playing all the matches at Royal Challengers Bangalore despite taking not disturbing the score board much. “Poor fellow, Virat [ Kohli]. During 2021 T20 World Cup, he was out of his form and team was also collapsing. Virat Kohli should have left half of IPL because he cannot miss international cricket. In IPL also he was out of form, and he was continuously playing and playing.” Kohli told cricketnext.com. Kaneria, who expressed disapproval of Kohli skipping tours of West Indies and Zimbabwe, believes that the 33-year old player should’ve played against these comparatively less stronger teams in order to regain form. Acknowledging that things can get hard with players traveling frequently inside the pandemic, Kaneria was hopeful of a “big player” in Kohli returning to the fold as a destructive batter in the Asia Cup. “Sometimes, two things happen, it’s like there’s a stale on your form. You do best to your strengths but there is a stale because there is continuous amount of cricket. Day and night cricket and then travelling as well. There is bubble, there is Covid, you can’t go out and can’t refreshened yourself, so cricket is different these days.” The post “Virat Kohli should have left half of IPL”: Danish Kaneria reckons Virat Kohli should have missed IPL 2022 than international cricket appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-08-25 15:32:03","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Samson should have got the opportunity”: Danish Kaneria believes Sanju Samson should have been in India’s Asia Cup 2022 squad in place of KL Rahul","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-samson-should-have-got-the-opportunity-danish-kaneria-believes-sanju-samson-should-have-been-in-indias-asia-cup-2022-squad-in-place-of-kl-rahul/","keywords":["Cricket","Asia Cup 2022","Danish Kaneria","Sanju Samson"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Danish Kaneria believes Sanju Samson should have booked his berth for the imminent Asia Cup 2022 as India’s second wicket-keeper batter.

Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has opined that India’s wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul has been included in India’s squad for the imminent Asia Cup 2022 too early, especially after recovering back from a big injury. India and Pakistan start as favourites as the arch-rivals are scheduled to face each other on the second day of the tournament – August 28, at the Dubai International Stadium. Fans and experts from both the countries have been brainstorming they way to envisage a best playing XI for both the teams, as the they are set to clash for the first time since the 2021 T20 World Cup last year. Team India, in particular, face a dilemma of sorts with respect to a couple of selections in their batting department, but Kaneria believes that the star Karnataka batter should have been given some extra time to hit his form back, with the T20 World Cup in Australia in view. ALSO READ: Danish Kaneria opines on Virat Kohli’s place in India’s T20 squad Danish Kaneria believes Sanju Samson should have booked his berth Danish Kaneria, during an interaction with the media outlet News18, remarked that Sanju Samson should have been preferred over Rahul in team India’s squad for Asia Cup 2022. As per the 41-year-old, Samson has finally started getting the opportunities, after having been in and out of the team way to quickly. However, the Kerala wicket-keeper batter has finally been included consistently in India’s playing XI this year in the shortest format, thanks to head coach Rahul Dravid who, as per him, recognizes the talent that he is. Thus, owing to his decent enough performances this year in T20Is, Kaneria believes that Samson should have made it into the squad in place of Rahul, with the latter been ideally handed some more time to prepare for the T20 World Cup in Australia this year, where his technique would come handy for the team. “KL Rahul was coming from a big injury and then he went to Zimbabwe, and now he is going into Asia Cup squad so early. India have Sanju Samson type of a player who’s been doing so well. He is a fantastic cricketer and he’s been playing beautifully. In Australia, there will be buoyant tracks and KL Rahul loves that kind of a track. India should have let him come in his form, but the thing is that he is a big name and if he wouldn’t have been in the team, then the whole media would have argued, why KL Rahul didn’t get selected?,” remarked Kaneria. “But, from cricket perspective, Sanju Samson should have been in the squad for the Asia Cup in place of KL Rahul because Rahul is just coming from his injury, and he needs to get his form back,” he further added.

New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult considers it as a “funny time” to be playing international cricket in Australia. Currently in New Zealand, their ODI squad will travel across the Trans-Tasman sea for a three-match series to be played between September 6-11 in Cairns. Not just an ODI, New Zealand have never played any international match in Australia in the month of September. An unusual time for international cricket in the country before the commencement of an international summer in real sense, New Zealand will also be playing for the first time at Cazaly’s Stadium. “Funny time to be playing cricket over in Australia next week, but yeah, the guys will definitely regroup after a break, a few days of travel here and we really look forward to get on that plane in a few days time again,” Boult told reporters in a video posted by ESPNcricinfo on social media platform Twitter. Trent Boult desperate to improve white-ball record in Australia Boult’s decision of relinquishing his central contract with NZC (New Zealand Cricket) earlier this month has allured mixed reactions in the global cricketing fraternity. Named in New Zealand’s 15-member squad for Australia tour, Boult’s selection immediately forced people talk about his future as an international cricketer. Not affected much by the chatter, Boult recently talked about wanting to continue representing the Black Caps in Test cricket. As far as the ODIs are concerned, Boult expressed desperation in wanting to improve white-ball record in Australia. “Probably don’t have the best of white-ball records in Australia but it’s something that me, personally, desperate to come away with a series win over there,” Boult added. Readers must note that Boult was addressing both his and his team’s white-ball record. Talking specifically about ODIs, New Zealand have won just 38 out of 109 matches in Australia. As far as bilateral ODI series is concerned, New Zealand have never won a series in Australia barring winning a one-match Bushfire Relief Challenge series almost four decades ago. Boult, who has played just five ODIs in Australia, has picked seven wickets at an average of 36.71, an economy rate of 5.14 and a strike rate of 42.8.

South Africa captain Dean Elgar, whose team lead the three test series 1-0, won the toss and opted to bat despite what appeared difficult conditions after overnight rain. James Anderson, bowling on his home ground, found some early movement off the seam and grabbed the breakthrough when he found Sarel Erwee's inside edge and wicketkeeper Ben Foakes dived to make a superb catch. Anderson and Ollie Robinson were both beating the outside edge regularly and Robinson thought he had claimed the prize scalp of Elgar when Ollie Pope snaffled up a catch at short mid-on off the bat-pad, but the umpire signalled for a no ball. Broad looked keen to get to work on an encouraging surface for seamers and took full advantage. After two lbw decisions were turned down, Broad removed Elgar for 12 with a full length delivery which was edged to Jonny Bairstow at third slip. Broad removed Keegan Petersen for 21 in similar fashion with Joe Root snaffling up the catch at first slip to leave South Africa on 41-3. England skipper Ben Stokes brought himself into the attack and struck with his third delivery -- a loose short ball which Aiden Markram attempted to pull but only managed to sky a simple high catch to the grateful Foakes. Stokes struck again, just before lunch, trapping Rassie van der Dussen lbw and although the video review backed the umpire's call, the South African, who had pushed well forward, will feel he was unlucky with a tight decision.

I’m taking it almost week by week really,” Boult said after being selected for the tour of Australia.New Zealand’s next red-ball assignment will be a two-Test series in Pakistan in December 2022 – January 2023. They will subsequently host England for two Tests in February 2023 which will also include a day-night Test at Boult’s home ground in Mount Maunganui.“There’s a lot of cricket to be played before then. I know the next series is in Pakistan and then at my home ground [Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui] against England in the New Year, but it’s too far away to tell. I’m going to leave that with New Zealand Cricket and respect their decision,” Boult added.Kane Williamson,Trent Boult,Jimmy Neesham,Lockie Ferguson & Finn Allen on a tour of Time Square, NY ❤ These wholesome pics made my day! pic.twitter.com/rLOUPyHvDy— Ayesha (@JoeRoot66Fan) August 23, 2022Boult also has an eye set on the 2023 ODI World Cup after they missed out in the last edition on back of the controversial ‘boundary scored’ rule.“I remember talking to Kane [Williamson] after 2019 at Lord’s [where England pipped New Zealand in the final] and saying we want to be there in four years’ time. It’s only a few months around the corner and there’s a lot of hunger to try to have another crack at that trophy,” the left-arm quick shared.Boult had reasoned the time spent with his family after he withdrew from the central contract with New Zealand Cricket. He is willing to spend more time with his family and playing in T20 leagues would help him do that as he can take them along with him. But international cricket is definitely not off his radar.“Without getting too financially specific, I’d be more able to bring them on tour [when playing T20 leagues],” Boult said. “I’ve got three young boys that only see dad for eight weeks a year at the current moment. If I don’t play any international cricket – obviously I still want to – then that might be a couple of leagues a year and 10 months at home rather than the other way around,” Boult explained.“I’m not getting too far ahead – it’s a hard one to forecast at the moment,” Boult concluded.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

It will join India and Pakistan in Group A","content":"Hong Kong qualified for the main Asia Cup event after defeating the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by eight wickets at the Al Amerat Cricket Stadium in Muscat. With Hong Kong ending the Qualifiers as the top-ranked side, they will now join India and Pakistan in Group A of the Asia Cup T20 event. Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are in Group B of the competition. Their match against India will be on August 31 in Dubai, followed by the clash against Pakistan in Sharjah on September 2. Co-incidentally, Hong Kong had defeated UAE in the 2018 qualifiers to join India and Pakistan in the same group of the ODI Asia Cup event. Ahead of the final match of the Asia Cup qualifiers, Hong Kong and UAE were put in a must-win situation after Kuwait defeated Singapore by six wickets and completed their chase of 105 in 7.5 overs to be on top of the table on the basis of Net Run Rate. Electing to bowl first, off-spinner Ehsan Khan shined for Hong Kong with the ball, picking 4-24 in his four overs. He was well-supported by right-arm medium pacer Ayush Shukla, picked three for 30 in his three overs, while Aizaz Khan (2-8) and Yasim Murtaza (1-17) chipped in with vital contributions to bowl out UAE for 147 in 19.3 overs. For the UAE, their captain CP Rizwan top-scored with 49 from 44 balls, including four fours, while all-rounder Zawar Farid smashed 41 off 27 balls after coming in at number seven, hitting two fours and three sixes, to give their bowling attack something to defend. In reply, Murtaza and skipper Nizakat Khan powered Hong Kong to a quick start, sharing a stand of 85 runs in 10.5 overs, recording the side's highest-ever T20I opening partnership. Nizakat fell for 39, including five fours, while Murtaza made 58 off 43 balls, smashing seven fours and a six. Babar Hayat (38 not out) and Kinchit Shah (six not out) ensured Hong Kong crossed the line with six balls to spare to seal the last remaining spot for Asia Cup. Hong Kong, ranked 23rd in the ICC T20I rankings, will be making their first-ever Asia Cup T20I appearance and fourth overall after playing in 2004, 2008 and 2018 editions in ODI format. Brief Scores: UAE 147 all out in 19.3 overs (CP Rizwan 49, Zawar Farid 41; Ehsan Khan 4-24, Ayush Shukla 3-30) lost to Hong Kong 149-2 in 19 overs (Yasim Murtaza 58, Nizakat Khan 39; Basil Hameed 1-31, Junaid Siddique 1-35) by eight wickets --IANS nr/inj (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","pubDate":"2022-08-25 11:50:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220825/thumb-122082500426.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mohammad Yousuf praises Babar Azam for bein consistent in last three years","link":"https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/mohammad-yousuf-praises-babar-azam-for-bein-consistent-in-last-three-years-122082500538_1.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Asia Cup 2022: Pakistan batting coach Mohammad Yousuf feels that skipper Babar Azam's consistency in all three formats is a firm proof of his soaring stock in international cricket.","content":"Pakistan batting coach Mohammad Yousuf feels that skipper Babar Azams consistency in all three formats of the game in the last three years is a firm proof of his soaring stock in international cricket. Azam is currently the only batter to be in the top three ICC rankings in all international formats. A prolific white-ball cricket run-scorer, he will be seen in action during the upcoming Asia Cup, where Pakistan will face arch-rivals India, dubbed as the 'greatest rivalry' in world cricket, on August 28 in Dubai. He was one of the main architects in Pakistan's 10-wicket thrashing of India in Men's T20 World Cup 2022, where he was unbeaten for a 52-ball 68, hitting six fours and two sixes, in the 152-run chase alongside opening partner, wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, who made 79 not out. \" Babar Azam is a world class player and his consistent performance in all three formats from the last three years is the solid proof of his flight. It's never easy for a captain to focus on his skills. In fact, he is performing well in all three formats,\" said Yousuf on the sidelines of a practice session at the ICC academy in Dubai. Talking about how Pakistan's practice session went, Yousuf remarked, \"It's hot and humid in Dubai but the boys are excited for the event and the team management has planned their practice sessions accordingly.\" \"All the players are professional and they are aware of all possible scenarios. We had an intense practice session on Wednesday and the players put all their efforts.\" Pakistan, the two-time Asia Cup champions, will commence their campaign in the 2022 edition to be played in T20I format, against India on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium. Apart from India, Pakistan will be facing off against Hong Kong in Sharjah on September 2, before the super four phase begins.--IANS nr/inj (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","pubDate":"2022-08-25 11:50:00","image_url":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1220825/thumb-122082500538.jpg","source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
