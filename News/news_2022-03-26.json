Coyte can make history on Sunday as the first player to win WNCL titles with three different states, as Tasmania push for their maiden trophy against South Australia. The 30-year-old already has seven titles to her name, claiming six at NSW before shifting to South Australia and ending her former state's streak in the 50-over competition in 2015-16. Coyte took 100 wickets across all formats for Australia in 81 matches before making the call to retire in 2016 aged 25 amid a long personal battle with anorexia nervosa. She quit all cricket the following year, later returning on a part-time basis in the WBBL and more recently the WNCL without regular training or matches while owning and operating her own gym. The 30-year-old's situation has her nicknamed as \"the FIFO\" in Tasmania as she only joins the team for matches. But it has hardly hurt her cricket, topping the Tigers' charts with 13 wickets at 18.38 after a handy WBBL with Adelaide. \"I have that second wind again, a second shot at it,\" Coyte told AAP. \"I don't think I have hit my best yet as a cricketer. \"If I was to get a state contract, I'd want to train full-time again. \"I don't want to play for Australia, I just want to see how good I can be when I am in a more stable environment.\" Coyte is one of four former Australian players to feature for Tasmania in the final at Blundstone Arena, with Molly Strano, Elyse Villani, Naomi Stalenberg and White Fern Rachael Priest all free to play after missing the World Cup. Making the final is a remarkable step up, since Tasmania had finished in the bottom two in nine of their 11 seasons before this summer. South Australia are without Megan Schutt, Darcie Brown, Tahlia McGrath and Amanda-Jade Wellington, qualifying for the final with just three members from their 2015-16 success. But the fact that Coyte is now in the opposition is significant, after she quit the game on moving back to Sydney from South Australia in early 2017. \"When I stopped playing I honestly thought I'd never get back to this point,\" Coyte said. \"Especially when I started having things to do outside of cricket and I started finding my own way, what I wanted and who I was. \"It gave me my own path. You rely so heavily on cricket and the path it takes you down, you just don't know how to create your own. \"But now I feel like I love it again. I really enjoy everything about it again.\"","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6210549/fb82abedce2f031db5c864d08dfb6a24a436050b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Six years retired, Coyte's a better bowler","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/six-years-retired-coytes-a-better-bowler-c-6210540","keywords":null,"creator":["Scott Bailey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Australia seamer Sarah Coyte, who first retired six years ago, believes her best cricket is to come as she prepares for Tasmania's maiden WNCL final.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 23:01:53","full_description":"Six years after her early retirement from the international cricket, Australian seamer Sarah Coyte now feels her best in the sport is still ahead of her.

Having spent 15 years as a player at Yorkshire, the former England spinner was appointed as interim managing director in December 2021 – with the task of transforming the culture at Headingley. Darren Gough explained to talkSPORT how Yorkshire can rebuildGETTY The club were widely-criticised for their appalling handling of a racism investigation and the treatment of former player Azeem RafiqGETTY “What we want to do is going to take time,” Gough said on talkSPORT’s live coverage of the Test series between West Indies and England. “We need to rebuild everything that is Yorkshire County Cricket Club. And that is the culture.  “We want to make it a more inclusive place for everyone, no matter what background you’re from. Rich, poor, whatever nationality you are to come and play for Yorkshire, the biggest county. It’s got to be inclusive for everyone and we’ve got to create opportunities.  “We are trying our best never to forget what happened. Because what happened to Azeem Rafiq wasn’t right. And I think the club straight away came out and admitted that they’d handled the whole situation badly. I think that’s quite obvious to everyone. They handled the whole thing badly.  “But it’s now about trying to take the club in a new direction.

Despite losing four of their last six games, New Zealand still have a chance of reaching the semifinals and will need to win against Pakistan by a huge margin. Also, England and India need to lose their final league matches for New Zealand. Meanwhile, Pakistan are out of contention and have lost five of their last six games. The White Ferns are currently sixth in the standings and Pakistan are bottom. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) We are into the last stages of the group stage of the World Cup with just the three games left. This game between Pakistan and New Zealand is of the least importance. Pakistan have no chance of qualifying and the hosts do but a lot of their chances depends on the games of England and India. New Zealand though will have to do their part and that is beat Pakistan by a heavy margin. They then have to hope both India and England lose to their respective opponents. However, the chances of New Zealand qualifying is still very low even if the results fall in their favor as their NRR is quite poort. Nevertheless though, the Kiwis would want to end the tournament on a high and they will be heavy favourites heading into this game. The hosts have been a tad unlucky in this torunament as they have ended up on the losing side in close encoutners but to end with a win will probably make them feel a little better. Pakistan on the other hand, will be wanting to avoid the wooden spoon. For that too happen, they will also be reliant on the result between Bangladesh and England. They too though will be wanting to end their tournament with a win but they will have to play out of their skins if they are to do so.

Earlier, England were bowled out for 204 in 89.4 overs in their first innings, with tailender Saqib Mahmood smashing 49 runs off 118 balls. Jayden Seales was in good bowling form for West Indies, taking three wickets. Meanwhile, Kemar Roach, Kyle Mayers and Alzarri Joseph bagged two dismissals each. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) We are moments away from the action. The players of England are out in the middle. Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell are the openers for West Indies. Chris Woakes to start with the ball. Three slips in place and a widish gully... Pitch Report - Mark Butcher is near the pitch. He says the pitch on Day 2 sees live grass but the pitch has dried out. He is joined by Chris Woakes. He says the ball was doing much and it kept the batters on their toes. Adds that the last wicket stand was huge for them and it was an amazing achievement and they are certainly happy from what they were first. Tells that holding the length will be crucial with the ball. If you overpitch, runs will come but they need to stick to the basics. Phil Simmons, the West Indies coach, says that he got no problems and adds that they bowled pretty well in the first two sessions. He adds that it gets harder to blast opposition when the ball get softer and credit should be given to two batters in the middle. Adds that he is still happy with the total in the end tells that they need to bat well with the new ball. Mentions that playing all-seam attack was due to the nature of the pitch and adds that Veerasammy Permaul performance was not as good as they expected from him in the first two games, so they decided to make that change. Day 2 promises to be yet another riveting day of Test cricket and it all depends on how Windies batters tackle the threat of new ball against the English seam-attack on a pitch with good amount of help for the seamers. Unlike the first two games, this game is likely to be a low-scoring encounter and first innings lead can play a crucial part in this decider. The wicket seems to be easing out a bit as was evident on the latter part of Day 1 and England would like to make the most of the new ball in the first session of Day 2. An interesting first session coming up. Stay tuned. Hello and a warm welcome to Day 2 of the third and final Test match of this three-match Test series between West Indies and England. Day 1 turned out to be quite an engrossing one as the wicket had a good amount of life in it and that made the contest between bat and ball, an interesting one. However, English batters failed to show application for the most part of the day and were staring down the barrel at one point in time. However, Windies bowlers who were quite disciplined throughout the day, let the momentum slip away in the final session as the last wicket pair of Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood added 90 runs. ... DAY 2, SESSION 1 … Right then, this has been an engrossing day of Test cricket! England are back in this game and have momentum on their side now and that makes Day 2 even more interesting. The first ball will be bowled at 7.30 pm IST (2.00 pm GMT). Our coverage though will start well in advance. So do join us for the same. Till then, goodbye and cheers! West Indies will be gutted with how they have let the advantage slip from their pocket after working so hard and bowling so well throughout the day. The pitch provided them with some help and Windies bowlers were on-target almost throughout the day as they bowled nagging lines and lengths. Kyle Mayers was the one who started the collapse and all other bowlers cashed in. At one point of time, it seemed quite possible that England would be bowled out even under 100 but some very poor body language in the last hour or so of the day with some strange tactics have put West Indies in the spot of bother now. They need to bat well on Day 2 now, as the pitch will aid English bowlers, especially with the new ball and it will be interesting to see how things pan out on Day 2. However, one cannot forget the poor performance by the English batters and once again, their fragility and over-dependence on Root was exposed on the pitch that has some help for the bowlers. The batters failed to show application that is required on a pitch like this and it was finally the duo of Leach and Mahmood that showed the way and brought them out of the jail in the final session. It would have been much worse for them and the batters need to pull their socks up and now it will be interesting to see how their bowlers go about their business on this pitch. What a day of Test cricket! Take a bow, Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood. England were down and out but this partnership has taken them to safer shores now. They were 90-8 at one point in time and are now looking in a decent position with more than 200 on the board. This is what Test cricket is all about, it is tough and one cannot put the foot off the paddle at any stage. West Indies were lacklustre as the final wicket partnership started frustrating them and all credit should be given to Leach and Mahmood for showing the grit and fight when their team needed it the most. Would you believe it, West Indies finally get a wicket off the last over of the day. England have been bowled out for 204 but not before we have seen history been made by the last wicket pair of Saqib Mahmood and Jack Leach! OUT! CHOPPED ON! Finally, West Indies get the wicket. A floated ball, on a length and outside off. Saqib Mahmood tries to hoick it on the leg side but gets a bottom edge and it ricochets onto the stumps. What a superb innings it was from Mahmood and from Leach as well. One to remember for a long time. England are all-out on 204 and that will be Stumps on Day 1. FOUR! Thumped! Mahmood showing aggression! Fuller and on off. Mahmood comes down the track and hammers it past the bowler and straight down the ground for a boundary. Flatter and around off. Mahmood punches it gently to covers. Shorter and angling on off. Mahmood tucks it off the back foot to mid-wicket. Jermaine Blackwood to bowl the last over of the day. Flighted, full and on off. Blocked out. Slower through the air, around off, pushed back to the bowler. Floated ball, on middle. Leach defends on the back foot. Angles a fuller ball, around off. Leach hangs back to block it out.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/mcn9g24o_west-indies-afp_625x300_25_March_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian Premier League embarks on crucial season after Covid debacle - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL21hci8yNS9pbmRpYW4tcHJlbWllci1sZWFndWUtZW1iYXJrcy1vbi1jcnVjaWFsLXNlYXNvbi1hZnRlci1jb3ZpZC1kZWJhY2xlLWNyaWNrZXTSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vc3BvcnQvMjAyMi9tYXIvMjUvaW5kaWFuLXByZW1pZXItbGVhZ3VlLWVtYmFya3Mtb24tY3J1Y2lhbC1zZWFzb24tYWZ0ZXItY292aWQtZGViYWNsZS1jcmlja2V0?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Indian Premier League embarks on crucial season after Covid debacle  The GuardianIPL 2022: Defending Champions Are Set To Take On KKR In Inaugural Game | Latest News  MIRROR NOWWhat a ten-team, four-venue IPL might look like  ESPNcricinfoIPL 2022: T20 cricket mania returns home bigger, marking start of new era  India TodayIndian Premier League returns home bigger than ever  The HinduView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 16:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Do injured players get paid in IPL: Does BCCI have team insurance for IPL teams?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-do-injured-players-get-paid-in-ipl-does-bcci-have-team-insurance-for-ipl-teams/","keywords":["Cricket","Indian Premier League","IPL"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Do injured players get paid in IPL: There are different rules regarding payment procedure for Indian and overseas players in this regard.

With the ten franchises set to start with a bunch of new faces, courtesy of an action-packed mega auction last month which saw some exciting players receive mind-boggling bids, the important question which pops in the minds of most Cricket fans is regarding how the payment is made to the players by the respective franchises or what percentage of a player’s contracted amount is deducted (if at all) in case they are injured and unavailable for a few matches or even the entire season. ALSO READ: How do IPL players earn money? Do injured players get paid in IPL The most important query is regarding the financial loss suffered by players in case they mark their unavailability due to an injury before or during the season. To begin with, players (except ones contracted with the BCCI) from a franchise who have been ruled out of an entire season without even playing a single match, do not receive any part of their contracted amount, as he would then be replaced with a new player altogether. However, the case is different for an Indian player contracted under the BCCI. In their case, the BCCI pays them the entire contracted amount as part of the players insurance policy which came into effect from IPL 2011. No amount is borne by the players’ franchises in this case. As per the policy, all the centrally contracted players will be compensated if they miss an IPL season due to an injury or accident, regardless of when they picked up the injury before the start of the season. Does BCCI have team insurance for IPL teams? The BCCI has the players insurance policy in place which covers their contracted players who are part of the Indian Cricket team. Additionally, the IPL franchises also generally have their separate insurance schemes which covers the players in their squad. Thus, in case a BCCI contracted player gets injured during the IPL season and is ruled out thereafter, half of his contracted amount is paid by the BCCI and the other half by the franchise concerned. Payment of non-contracted players missing the IPL due to injury In case an overseas player or an Indian player not centrally contracted with the BCCI, picks up an injury during an IPL season, he will be paid on a proportional allocation (or pro rata) basis – on the number of matches he was available during the season.

The 27-year-old is expected to have his current salary doubled to £240,000-a-week. Despite being a revelation in his first two seasons at Old Trafford, the Portugal international’s form has dipped somewhat in what has overall been a disappointing campaign for the team as a whole. Jordan says he was taken back by Fernandes in his first season with Red Devils, but believes he has a long way to go if he is to reach such heights again. “I am underwhelmed by him, I thought there was a period of time where he was very talismanic for Manchester United,” the former Crystal Palace owner said. “But it was a false dawn for the club and the manager, and subsequently what he has been able to achieve moving forward?

He added: “It is curious, I don’t know what his contractual situation is or when it expires, but United haven’t got a new manager through the door, and already there seems to be a group of people at the club signing or re-signing players, without necessarily the new manager coming into the job. “Why are they doing anything now? United are outside of their minds. He has three years left on his contract, the core performance of the whole Manchester United team don’t need to be rewarded. Fernandes continues to vent his frustrationsGetty “They need to smacked around the head with a cricket bat and woken up, about what they should and shouldn’t be doing for the club – and him included. “He has been a show pony for periods of this season, been okay, but most of the time, I can’t get the image of him out of my head of against Watford, the appalling performance on the pitch, and the nonsense, histrionics and the rubbish behind Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s back. “If we are looking at his previous record where he started on fire, he was revelation when he walked through the door, the more you look at him, the more you study things, the more I have been less impressed by him. “I think he embodies that ‘ahead of themselves’ mentality. He talks a very good game, outlook and disposition – but Manchester United need people delivering a good game. Jordan also claims Fernandes is ‘not a leader’Getty “He is not a leader on the pitch, doesn’t work hard enough, doesn’t do enough off the ball, doesn’t track back. He is a luxury player and, for a United side that needs more substance, I think he embodies certain aspects as to why they are not good enough as a team. The talkSPORT host also believes Fernandes’ mentality is incomparable to top United stars of the past. He said: “As an individual he is a very good footballer, as part of cohesive and potent Manchester United he is not, he is a lightweight, he is Manchester United light. “If I look at Manchester United of the past, they need players who can replicate the fabric of the club, people like, [Roy] Keane, [Eric] Cantona, [Nemanja] Vidic, [Rio] Ferdinand, [Gary] Neville, [Paul] Scholes – all those players had a backbone about them, a substance who understood the dynamics, who knew what it was like to play for Manchester United. Keane is a player who Fernandes should be looking to followgetty “Get them all out and compare them to the current crop of players, and Fernandes comes into a light version. “He is a leading light, in a lightweight Manchester United and they are not going to hunt down the Liverpool’s and Manchester City’s of the world. “Both are a different animal from the boardroom, to the dugout, to the pitch, and if you keep looking at Fernandes as the future there is going to have to be a huge sea change of what is round him.” Betting Offer Of The Day Bet365: Bet £10 Get £50 in free bets – CLAIM HERE Min deposit requirement.

United are outside of their minds. He has three years left on his contract, the core performance of the whole Manchester United team don’t need to be rewarded. “They need to smacked around the head with a cricket bat and woken up, about what they should and shouldn’t be doing for the club – and him included. “He has been a show pony for periods of this season, been okay, but most of the time, I can’t get the image of him out of my head of against Watford, the appalling performance on the pitch, and the nonsense, histrionics and the rubbish behind Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s back. “If we are looking at his previous record where he started on fire, he was revelation when he walked through the door, the more you look at him, the more you study things, the more I have been less impressed by him. “I think he embodies that ‘ahead of themselves’ mentality. He talks a very good game, outlook and disposition – but Manchester United need people delivering a good game. “He is not a leader on the pitch, doesn’t work hard enough, doesn’t do enough off the ball, doesn’t track back. He is a luxury player and, for a United side that needs more substance, I think he embodies certain aspects as to why they are not good enough as a team. The talkSPORT host also believes Fernandes’ mentality is incomparable to top United stars of the past. He said: “As an individual he is a very good footballer, as part of cohesive and potent Manchester United he is not, he is a lightweight, he is Manchester United light. “If I look at Manchester United of the past, they need players who can replicate the fabric of the club, people like, [Roy] Keane, [Eric] Cantona, [Nemanja] Vidic, [Rio] Ferdinand, [Gary] Neville, [Paul] Scholes – all those players had a backbone about them, a substance who understood the dynamics, who knew what it was like to play for Manchester United. “Get them all out and compare them to the current crop of players, and Fernandes comes into a light version. “He is a leading light, in a lightweight Manchester United and they are not going to hunt down the Liverpool’s and Manchester City’s of the world. “Both are a different animal from the boardroom, to the dugout, to the pitch, and if you keep looking at Fernandes as the future there is going to have to be a huge sea change of what is round him.” Bet365: Bet £10 Get £50 in free bets – CLAIM HERE Min deposit requirement.

Chasing a target of 136 runs, Australia lost five wickets for just 72 runs. It was only after the arrival of Beth Mooney that the world no. 1 team managed to get past the finishing line. After the match, captain Meg Lanning stated that her team was put under pressure. The skipper was also dismissed for an eight-ball duck, losing her wicket to spinner Salma Khatun. On the fourth delivery of the eighth over, Khatun tossed up a delivery, on off stump. Lanning tried to defend it but it passed the outside edge to hit the off stump. Such was the brilliance of the delivery that the commentator exclaimed, \"That has gone through the defenses of Meg Lanning!\" Posting the highlight on Instagram, ICC captioned it as, \"\"We're all slightly in a bit of shock here.\" Salma Khatun's ripper to dismiss Meg Lanning is the latest in the @bookingcom Best Wickets series of #CWC22\". Here is the video of Khatun's \"ripper\" to dismiss Lanning: A post shared by ICC (@icc) Mooney smashed an unbeaten knock of 66 runs off 75 balls to seal the win in a match where innings were reduced to 43 overs due to weather conditions. Other than Mooney, Annabel Sutherland also made a crucial contribution and registered an unbeaten knock of 26 runs off 39 deliveries, as Australia managed to reach 136 for five in 32.1 overs. Khatun was in excellent form and took three wickets in nine overs, conceding only 23 runs. Meanwhile, Nahida AKter and Rumana Ahmed bagged a dismissal each. Initially, Bangladesh posted 135 for six in 43 overs with Lata Mondal top-scoring with a knock of 33 runs off 63 balls. Promoted Opener Sharmin Akhter also played a knock of 24 runs off 56 balls. Ashleigh Gardner and Jess Jonassen took two wickets each for Australia's bowling department. Megan Schutt and Annabel Sutherland scalped a dismissal each.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-03/oini20l_khatun-instagram_120x90_25_March_22.jpg","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: T20 cricket mania returns home bigger, marking start of new era","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/ipl-2022/story/ipl-10-teams-crowds-new-captain-passing-baton-ms-dhoni-virat-kohli-1929613-2022-03-25?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022: T20 mania gears up for new era, returns home bigger","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-25 14:50:43","full_description":"More teams, more matches and more thrill rides. Indian Premier League, Indian cricket's golden goose, is back home even as the sporting world is taking baby steps towards normalcy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 10-team IPL 2022 marks the beginning of a new era in which the next generation of superstar cricketers battle to become the faces of the league. It's that time of the year when prime time is dominated by cricket stars. 40 overs of cricket and entertainment every day as allegiances are switched and social media is dominated by fan battles. With 70 matches in the league stages, 14 more than last year, there's plenty in store for cricket fans across the globe. IPL 2022: Full Coverage | Full Schedule Over the years, the IPL has evolved and found newer audiences despite the overdose of cricket. It will be interesting to see how the league takes its first steps into a new era as players, who have been poster boys of the cash-rich T20 league are in the twilight of their careers while young stars are waiting to make it big. 10-TEAM BATTLE For the first time since 2011, IPL will have 10 teams. The two new franchises, Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants were sold for Rs 5625 crore and Rs 7090 crore, respectively as the Indian cricket board (BCCI) flaunted the high valuation of the T20 league. For instance, the owners of the iconic Manchester Untied also wanted a slice of the IPL pie but lost to the RPSG Group and Britain-based CVC group on the bidding table. There was no dearth of talent as both Gujarat and Ahmedabad have managed to put up formidable sides with Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul as their captains. With 2 new teams coming in, the IPL has moved away from the two-legged round-robin format. There are two groups with five teams each. IPL 2022: New format explained While Mumbai Indians are leading Group A, defending champions Chennai Super Kings are headlining the Group, the BCCI has assigned the teams to two virtual groups on the basis of the number of IPL Championships won, followed by the number of final matches played by the respective teams. CROWD IS BACK When the first leg of IPL 2021 was held in India, it was odd to see the empty stands. The Covid-19 pandemic impacted sport in multiple ways while taking away the atmosphere that the crowd created, especially in India over the years in the IPL. The BCCI has decided to allow 25 per cent capacity crowd for all league stages of IPL 2022 as the Covid-19 situation in th country seems to be in control. The BCCI has decided to stage the entire league stages only across 4 venues -- 3 in Mumbai and 1 in Pune to limit the chances of Covid-19 infection to players, support staff and other stakeholders. The decision was taken to avoid air travel between venues. DHONI, KOHLI TAKE BACKSEAT No more Dhoni-Kohli bromance at the toss (Courtesy of BCCI) How odd will it be to not see MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli walking out for the toss, sharing a warm hug and a friendly banter for the toss when Chennai Super Kings take on Royal Challengers Bangalore? The two superstars along with Rohit Sharma have been the protagonists of the IPL blockbuster over the years. However, Virat kohl gave up RCB captaincy as early as last year. While speculation was rife that the former skipper will return to the top job after giving up India captaincy duties, RCB appointed Faf du Plessis as the captain of the Bengaluru-based franchise for the 2022 season. In Chennai, MS Dhoni gave up the captaincy , bringing the curtains down on a decorated stint, 2 days before CSK's opening match. He handed over the baton to Ravindra Jadeja, who is confident of leading the side with Dhoni still being a part of the Super Kings side. Even as CSK stressed that Dhoni will continue to represent the franchise \"this season and beyond\", it remains to be seen how the legendary 'Thala' manages himself in the upcoming season. Cricket fans will also miss two of the most decorated IPL stars - AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle as the big names decided to not take part in the mega auction. While de Villiers retired from all formats of the game after IPL 2021, Gayle did not enter the bidding process. PRESSURE ON ROHIT? Rohit Sharma is undoubtedly the most successful captain in the history of the IPL. But will there be pressure on the Mumbai Indians captain, considering that he is heading into a season for the first time after becoming India's full-time captain across all formats? Questions have been asked of Rohit's fitness in the recent past but the influential captain has said that he is looking forward to playing all games for MI amid a busy cricket season. NEXT-GEN CAPTAINS Meet the first-time captains in IPL 2022 With the role of the heir-apparent to Rohit Sharma up for grabs in the senior national team, IPL 2022 gives probable contenders a good platform to showcase their class. Having led Delhi Capitals to their first-ever final, Shreyas Iyer was sidelined from captaincy following a shoulder injury. He decided to go back into the auction and KKR paid big money for his services. Iyer has shown rich form for India of late and he will be hoping to carry that into the IPL and inspire KKR to their third title. The spotlight will also be on Ravindra Jadeja when he walks out for the toss, leading CSK on Saturday.The all-rounder has reiterated that he will bank on Dhoni for guidance as he prepares to carry forward the legacy of the Men in Yellow. Hardik Pandya's progress will be followed closely over the course of the IPL. Having lost his place in the Indian team due to his inability to bowl regularly following back surgery in 2019, Hardik has a point to prove as he takes up a new role as Gujarat Titans captain. Having spent time with Mumbai Indians' winning sides in the past, Hardik will be hoping to inculcate a winning mentality at the new franchise. Meanwhile, KL Rahul will also need to inspire a young unit at Lucknow Super Giants. Success eluding him as captain, both at India and IPL level, the opener will be eyeing another prolific season with the bat besides leading an exciting bunch of cricketers. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant will be looking to continue his good run with the Delhi Capitals. It will be important that the wicketkeeper-batter continues his good run with the bat in the IPL.

It will be the first time since 2011 that 10 teams be fighting it out for the most coveted T20 trophy in world cricket. Two new entrants, Lucknow Supergiants and Gujarat Titans, fetching a combined price of approximately USD 1.7 billion shows that brand IPL keeps getting bigger. It took 14 years but the league has now well and truly gone global. The owners of the iconic Manchester Untied also wanted a slice of the IPL pie but lost to the RPSG Group and Britain-based CVC group on the bidding table. With the COVID situation under control in the country, the board's top-brass can breathe easy and after a two year gap, IPL is set to be held in India in its entirety with at least 25 percent capacity of crowd allowed in stadiums this season. The number of games have been increased to 74 from 60 with the addition of new teams, extending the IPL window to over two months. All teams however will play 14 games each like in the past but will a longer tournament impact the intensity and quality of cricket, only time will tell. The board has learnt from the harsh lessons of the 2021 edition when the tournament had to be suspended midway due to the raging pandemic and could only be completed in the UAE four months later. No air travel will be required this season with all the league games to be organised in four venues in Maharashtra (three Mumbai and one in Pune). For curators, maintaining the trueness of pitches over two months will be a challenge but at least the half of the tournament is set to be a high-scoring affair. One can expect more bounce on the red soil pitches of Wankhede, CCI and D Y Patil while the black soil surface in Pune is expected to offer more turn. With Supergiants and Titans building their teams from scratch and the existing franchises having to release a chunk of their players before the mega auction, the 2022 edition can well be one of the most competitive in tournament history. Ahead of the World Cup to be played in Australia later this year, the IPL will also decided fate of a few Indian players. No home advantage for MI? Rohit Sharma has insisted that there will be no home advantage for Mumbai Indians but he and the likes of Kieron Pollard, Suryakumar Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Ishan Kishan won't certainly mind playing in their own backyard. Having let of go of Pandya brothers and Trent Boult, the team doesn't look the same formidable outfit at least on paper. At Royal Challengers Bangalore, all eyes will be on Virat Kohli like usual, though, he has happily relinquished the captaincy. With the burden of leading the side off his shoulders, the former India skipper is expected to come back to his batting best and play an important role in taking the team to its elusive title. Longtime CSK batter Faf du Plessis has been given the captaincy with a hope that he would be able to do what has not been done before at RCB. Farewell season for Dhoni? Dhoni has done a Dhoni by giving up CSK captaincy three days before their opening game. While his decision did not come as a shock, it has fuelled speculation whether he would feature in all the games. The 40-year-old stepping aside has also put the spotlight on Ravindra Jadeja, who will be captaining a high-profile team for the very first time. Jadeja's stellar form in international cricket over the last couple of years would surely give him the confidence to lead from the front and in times of crisis, he will anyway have Dhoni by his side. Time for Iyer, KL and Hardik to enhance captaincy credentials Having led Delhi Capitals to their first ever final, Iyer was sidelined from captaincy following a shoulder injury. He decided to go back into the auction and KKR paid big money for his services. The stylish batter has shown rich form for India of late and he will be hoping to carry that into the IPL and inspire KKR to their third title. His India teammate Hardik Pandya's progress will be followed closely over the course of the IPL. Having lost his place in the Indian team due to his inability to bowl regularly following a back surgery in 2019, Hardik has a point to prove. It is still not clear if he would bowl often in the IPL, making his form with the bat all the more crucial. Either way, he will have to come up with something special to resurrect his career and also ensure first timers Gujarat put up a competitive show. Promoted Hardik's close friend K L Rahul will also need to inspire a young unit. Success eluding him as captain, both at India and IPL level, the opener will be eyeing another prolific season with the bat besides leading an exciting bunch of cricketers.

Australia long looked in the ascendancy on day five of the third Test and was deserved winners of the series, but Pakistan committed a bizarre error that ultimately made the match look more one-sided than it was. Pakistan was 4-167 when Mohammad Rizwan was struck on the toe by a Pat Cummins yorker, and umpire Aleem Dar's finger went up.

Try 14-Days Free Now > Steve Smith spat with Pat over DRS | 01:01 Rizwan walked down the pitch and looked at his captain, Babar Azam, hoping for the nod to go upstairs in a bid to save his wicket. Only the nod never came. Rizwan even double checked, but Babar shook his head and waved him away to protect the review. It proved to be a howler of a decision because Rizwan was struck well outside of off-stump, and the decision would have been overturned. Of course, Pakistan still faced a big uphill climb to either draw or win the series in Lahore. But Rizwan and Babar formed Pakistan’s final batting partnership before the tailenders, while the former had already frustrated Australia once this series with his unbeaten 104 in Karachi. “I found that a little bit bizarre,” former Pakistan international Urooj Mumtaz said in commentary. “That was the last batting pair and I just felt Babar would have had a really good view, it just made sense to go up (and review). Australia clinch Pak series on final day | 02:54 “I thought Babar had the better view. You could see glimpses of the leg stump behind Rizwan.” Commentator Mike Haysman was of a similar opinion, saying: “Why didn’t Babar get more involved there and say ‘you’ve got to look at this?’. Surely that’s the reason you chat, surely they had to go upstairs.” The root of Babar’s gun-shyness is likely within what happened just two overs earlier. Babar gave the green light for Fawad Alam to review his own LBW to Cummins and, despite the batter’s visible anger, ball-tracking showed he was plumb. Simon Katich said that as a result, Babar likely became hesitant to quickly risk another review. “I think it was the review before that potentially cost Pakistan,” Katich said. “They should never have reviewed the previous LBW — it looked absolutely plumb on the back leg.” With the tail exposed, Pakistan went on to lose its final five wickets for just 68 runs, falling 115 runs short of Australia.

I think it’s fair to question what exactly has changed in the three months since. When Saqib Mahmood walked out to the crease yesterday, he noticed that his England teammates were already getting ready to field . “[When I got out to the middle] I did say to Leachy: ‘The cheeky fuckers have got their whites on. It did spur us on a little bit. I had a glance over later to see if some had taken them off but they had the whites on throughout. But yes, we did spot that.” “The wicket certainly offered quite a bit for the bowlers,” says Chris Woakes on BT Sport. “Incredible by the guys at the end to put on that partnership, to get us up to hopefully what it is a competitive score. Hopefully today, we can do what the West Indies bowlers. It’s about doing the basics right – make the batsmen play shots. There’s a long way to go, and things can happen quickly on this pitch.” Before we focus on the action here, Australia have just completed a dramatic series victory over Pakistan – read more here: If you missed the first day of action – or even if you didn’t – Ali Martin’s pitchside report from Grenada is a must-read: Test Cricket, it’s a Funny Old Game.

Pakistan had conceded a decisive 123-run lead after scoring 268 in its first innings in reply to Australia's 391. Lyon bowled an unchanged marathon spell of 28 overs on the last day. Pacer Pat Cummins clean bowled No. 11 Naseem Shah to finish off Pakistan. Opener Imam-ul-Haq (70) and captain Babar Azam (55) scored fighting half centuries but the rest of Pakistan's batters crumbled against the menacing reverse swing of Cummins, who took 3-23, and the sharp spin of Lyon. The first test ended in a tame draw at Rawalpindi where the pitch was rated as below average by the ICC. Babar's brilliant 196 in more than 10 hours denied Australia a win at Karachi where Pakistan played out 171.4 overs in more than five sessions and forced an epic draw. Speaking at the post-match show, Pakistan captain Babar Azam said that the primary reason why they lost the match was losing the toss. Babar Azam said, \"We dominated the previous matches.

During the fifth day of the third Test of the ongoing Australia’s tour of Pakistan in Lahore, Australia beat Pakistan by 115 runs to register a 1-0 series victory. A grueling couple of draws despite both the teams playing well needed to be followed by a victory for a drawn series score would’ve been unfair to a hard 15-day toil in this series. Chasing a 351-run target, Pakistan failed to make the most of a 77-run opening partnership between Abdullah Shafique (27) and Imam-ul-Haq (70) to get bundled out for 235 in 92.1 overs. As far as Day 5 is concerned, the hosts lost all their 10 wickets for 162 runs. Captain Babar Azam (55) was Pakistan’s solitary hope in the final session but even he couldn’t prevent a loss in spite of receiving a reprieve in the previous session. While Australia captain Pat Cummins (15.1-6-23-3) picked crucial wickets including the last one of Naseem Shah (1), it was spinner Nathan Lyon who played a titular role in an overseas victory on the back of bowling figures of 37-8-83-5. From dismissing Pakistan’s best batters today in Imam and Azam to picking lower-order wickets of Hasan Ali (13) and Shaheen Shah Afridi (5), Lyon delivered the exact of what was expected out of a lead spinner on a final day pitch. Pakistan vs Australia Man of the Series Considering the manner in which he batted throughout the series, no one other than Australia batter Usman Khawaja deserved to win the ‘Man of the Series’ today. In five innings, Khawaja amassed 496 runs at a mind-blowing average of 165.33 including two centuries and half-centuries each. Player of the Series is Usman Khawaja! #PAKvAUS https://t.co/WViJ4JD64U — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) March 25, 2022 “We’ve had a lot of fun. Want to thank Pakistan, the fans. The boys would agree. The food’s been great. Winning today has been the icing on the cake. I think 350 [351] with four sessions was a pretty good target. I knew how tough it was batting there. It was the hardest wicket I batted on. Was the hardest hundred I got,” Khawaja told PTV during the post-match presentation ceremony. Khawaja, who won his first maiden Test series award, has been in phenomenal form since his return to the format this year. In nine Test innings in 2022, Khawaja’s 751 runs have come at an average of 125.16 with the help of four centuries and two half-centuries.
