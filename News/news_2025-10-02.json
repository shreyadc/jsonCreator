নিউজিল্য়ান্ডের বিরুদ্ধে ঘরের মাঠে টেস্ট সিরিজে ৩-০ ব্যবধানে হারের পর ফের একবার দেশের মাটিতে টেস্ট সিরিজ খেলতে নামছে ভারতীয় দল। ওয়েস্ট ইন্ডিদের বিরুদ্ধে দু ম্য়াচের টেস্ট সিরিজ খেলতে নামছে গিল বাহিনী।আর সিরিজের আগেই চোট আশঙ্কা ভারতীয় ক্রিকেট শিবিরে। তারকা অলরাউন্ডার ওয়াশিংটন সুন্দরকে প্রথম টেস্টে আদৌ পাওয়া যাবে কি না তা নিয়ে সংশয় রয়েছে। কাউন্টি ক্রিকেট খেলতে হ্যাম্পশায়ার ক্লাবে যোগ দিয়েছিলেন সুন্দর। সেখানে খেলার সময়ই আঙুলে চোট পেয়েছিলেন সুন্দর।ওয়েস্ট ইন্ডিজের বিরুদ্ধে প্রথম টেস্টের আগের দিন অনুশীলনে খুব একটা স্বস্তিতে ছিলেন না সুন্দর। নেটে সুন্দর বল করলেও খুব একটা স্বস্তিতে ছিলেন না। টাইমস অফ ইন্ডিয়ার রিপোর্ট অনুযায়ী ক্যাচিং প্র্যাকটিসের সময়ও ছিলেন না চেন্নাইয়ের এই স্পিনার।ইংল্যান্ড সফরে ব্যাট ও বল হাতে দারুণ পারফর্ম করেছিলেন সুন্দর। ব্যাট হাতে মোট ২৮৪ রান করেছিলেন তিনি। ৪৭.৩৩ গড়ে ব্যাটিং করেছিলেন। সঙ্গে ছিল একটি শতরানও। একটি অর্ধশতরানও হাঁকিয়েছিলেন। ইংল্যান্ডের পেস সহায়ক উইকেটেও ৭৪.১ ওভার বল করেছিলেন সুন্দর, তুলে নিয়েছিলেন মোট ৭ উইকেট। ইংল্যান্ড সফরের আগে নিউজিল্য়ান্ডের বিরুদ্ধে টেস্ট সিরিজে দুটো ম্য়াচে ১৬ উইকেট নিয়েছিলেন। একটি ইনিংসে পাঁচ উইকেট ও দুবার চারটে করে উইকেট পেয়েছিলেন। যদিও ভারতকে জেতাতে পারেননি সুন্দর। যদিও অস্ট্রেলিয়া সফরে খুব একটা সফল ছিলেন না এই তরুণ স্পিনার অলরাউন্ডার। সেখানে ৬ ইনিংসে ১১৪ রান করেছিলেন। একটি অর্ধশতরান করেছিলেন। বল হাতে মাত্র ৩ উইকেট ঝুলিতে পুরেছিলেন। সুন্দর যদি না খেলেন, তাহলে ভারত হয়ত তিন স্পিনার নিয়েই একাদশ সাজাবে। সেক্ষেত্রে রবীন্দ্র জাডেজা, অক্ষর পটেল ও কুলদীপ যাদব খেলবেন। সুন্দর না খেললে নীতীশ রেড্ডি একাদশে খেলবেন অলরাউন্ডার হিসেবে।এদিকে, ভারতের বিরুদ্ধে নামার আগে ক্যারিবিয়ান অধিনায়ক রস্টন চেজ় জানিয়েছেন, ২০২৪ সালে যে মন্ত্র মেনে কিউয়িরা খেলেছিলেন এবং ১২ বছর পর ভারতকে ঘরের মাঠে টেস্ট সিরিজ পরাজয়ের তিক্ততা দিয়েছিলেন, সেই ফর্মুলা মেনে চলবেন তাঁরা। সেই সিরিজের ভিডিও ক্লিপও দেখছেন। রস্টন চেজ় বলেছেন, 'আমরা টেস্ট দল হিসাবে এই মুহূর্তে ভাল জায়গায় নেই। বিশ্ব টেস্ট চ্যাম্পিয়নশিপের তালিকায় আমরা নীচের দিকে। তবে সেগুলো ছাপিয়ে উঠতে হবে। গত বছর নিউজ়িল্যান্ড এসে ভারতের বিরুদ্ধে দাপট দেখিয়েছিল। ওরা যেটা করেছিল তা থেকে শেখার চেষ্টা করছি। ভাল ক্রিকেট খেলার, প্রতিদ্বন্দ্বিতী করার ও সিরিজ জেতার সবরকম চেষ্টা করব।'","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN

অস্ট্রেলিয়া সফরে খুব একটা সফল ছিলেন না এই তরুণ স্পিনার অলরাউন্ডার। সেখানে ৬ ইনিংসে ১১৪ রান করেছিলেন। একটি অর্ধশতরান করেছিলেন। বল হাতে মাত্র ৩ উইকেট ঝুলিতে পুরেছিলেন। সুন্দর যদি না খেলেন, তাহলে ভারত হয়ত তিন স্পিনার নিয়েই একাদশ সাজাবে। সেক্ষেত্রে রবীন্দ্র জাডেজা, অক্ষর পটেল ও কুলদীপ যাদব খেলবেন। সুন্দর না খেললে নীতীশ রেড্ডি একাদশে খেলবেন অলরাউন্ডার হিসেবে।এদিকে, ভারতের বিরুদ্ধে নামার আগে ক্যারিবিয়ান অধিনায়ক রস্টন চেজ় জানিয়েছেন, ২০২৪ সালে যে মন্ত্র মেনে কিউয়িরা খেলেছিলেন এবং ১২ বছর পর ভারতকে ঘরের মাঠে টেস্ট সিরিজ পরাজয়ের তিক্ততা দিয়েছিলেন, সেই ফর্মুলা মেনে চলবেন তাঁরা। সেই সিরিজের ভিডিও ক্লিপও দেখছেন। রস্টন চেজ় বলেছেন, 'আমরা টেস্ট দল হিসাবে এই মুহূর্তে ভাল জায়গায় নেই। বিশ্ব টেস্ট চ্যাম্পিয়নশিপের তালিকায় আমরা নীচের দিকে। তবে সেগুলো ছাপিয়ে উঠতে হবে। গত বছর নিউজ়িল্যান্ড এসে ভারতের বিরুদ্ধে দাপট দেখিয়েছিল। ওরা যেটা করেছিল তা থেকে শেখার চেষ্টা করছি। ভাল ক্রিকেট খেলার, প্রতিদ্বন্দ্বিতী করার ও সিরিজ জেতার সবরকম চেষ্টা করব।'","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN

নিউজিল্য়ান্ডের বিরুদ্ধে ঘরের মাঠে টেস্ট সিরিজে ৩-০ ব্যবধানে হারের পর ফের একবার দেশের মাটিতে টেস্ট সিরিজ খেলতে নামছে ভারতীয় দল। ওয়েস্ট ইন্ডিদের বিরুদ্ধে দু ম্য়াচের টেস্ট সিরিজ খেলতে নামছে গিল বাহিনী।আর সিরিজের আগেই চোট আশঙ্কা ভারতীয় ক্রিকেট শিবিরে। তারকা অলরাউন্ডার ওয়াশিংটন সুন্দরকে প্রথম টেস্টে আদৌ পাওয়া যাবে কি না তা নিয়ে সংশয় রয়েছে। কাউন্টি ক্রিকেট খেলতে হ্যাম্পশায়ার ক্লাবে যোগ দিয়েছিলেন সুন্দর। সেখানে খেলার সময়ই আঙুলে চোট পেয়েছিলেন সুন্দর।ওয়েস্ট ইন্ডিজের বিরুদ্ধে প্রথম টেস্টের আগের দিন অনুশীলনে খুব একটা স্বস্তিতে ছিলেন না সুন্দর। নেটে সুন্দর বল করলেও খুব একটা স্বস্তিতে ছিলেন না। টাইমস অফ ইন্ডিয়ার রিপোর্ট অনুযায়ী ক্যাচিং প্র্যাকটিসের সময়ও ছিলেন না চেন্নাইয়ের এই স্পিনার।ইংল্যান্ড সফরে ব্যাট ও বল হাতে দারুণ পারফর্ম করেছিলেন সুন্দর। ব্যাট হাতে মোট ২৮৪ রান করেছিলেন তিনি। ৪৭.৩৩ গড়ে ব্যাটিং করেছিলেন। সঙ্গে ছিল একটি শতরানও। একটি অর্ধশতরানও হাঁকিয়েছিলেন। ইংল্যান্ডের পেস সহায়ক উইকেটেও ৭৪.১ ওভার বল করেছিলেন সুন্দর, তুলে নিয়েছিলেন মোট ৭ উইকেট। ইংল্যান্ড সফরের আগে নিউজিল্য়ান্ডের বিরুদ্ধে টেস্ট সিরিজে দুটো ম্য়াচে ১৬ উইকেট নিয়েছিলেন। একটি ইনিংসে পাঁচ উইকেট ও দুবার চারটে করে উইকেট পেয়েছিলেন। যদিও ভারতকে জেতাতে পারেননি সুন্দর। যদিও অস্ট্রেলিয়া সফরে খুব একটা সফল ছিলেন না এই তরুণ স্পিনার অলরাউন্ডার। সেখানে ৬ ইনিংসে ১১৪ রান করেছিলেন। একটি অর্ধশতরান করেছিলেন। বল হাতে মাত্র ৩ উইকেট ঝুলিতে পুরেছিলেন। সুন্দর যদি না খেলেন, তাহলে ভারত
