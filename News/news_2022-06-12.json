On the other hand, West Indies batting would have to cope with Pakistan spin in order to achieve a consolation win. Pakistan have already jumped to No 4 on the ICC League table which is the position to qualify directly for the next year's ODI World Cup to be staged in India. From 14 outings, Pakistan have so far gathered 80 points. The Green-shirts are now looking to make the points to reach 90 Sunday under the blistering Multan heat that has already made things tough for the opposing sides. Chasing an achievable score of 276 on Friday, the tourists never looked at ease against the spin duo of Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan. After spending 50 overs on the field amid 40 C temperature and above, West Indies batsmen were seen exhausted and dehydrated. To make things worse, Nawaz and Shadab both started spinning the ball appreciably to restrict the tourists to 155. “I thought we were 20 runs short. But once our bowlers started creating trouble for the WI batsmen, I knew well that target was too stiff for them. At the end even 276 runs target looked too daunting for the hapless tourists,” Babar Azam said in his post-match conference Friday. He hoped to enter the third ODI with the same vein. “We will now go all out for a clean sweep on Sunday. A repeat of performance on Sunday would help us achieve that,” Babar said. Toss will again be crucial on Sunday as the team winning it most likely to go to bat first. The key bowlers of the team batting first would stay fresh and spinners will be having more purchase from the wicket later in the evening. “We bowled well Friday but could not hang on there to chase a reachable target. We won the first half and were very much in the game till the time we started losing wickets regularly,” ace West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein, said following a one-sided second ODI. “Our batsmen did not spend time in the middle that was required. Instead of staying at the wicket and taking singles and doubles, they went after the bowling which made the job easier for the host nation. We should have gone deep into the innings instead of getting bowled out with more than 17 overs to spare,” Akeal said, who looked threatening throughout his 10 overs spell that fetched him 3 for 52. The left arm-spinner said that they missed an opportunity that could have made the series 1-1. “We did a great job to restrict Pakistan to under 300, yet we could not cash in on the opportunity.” Man of the Match award winner Nawaz was excited to get his team through. “I just kept pursuing the basics and that helped me in keeping WI batsmen under check,” he said. Even in an overwhelming victory Friday, Pakistan showed some weaknesses that could well prove decisive on any other day. Fakhar Zaman’s continuous failure to play a strong knock, a suspect middle-order and fifth bowler’s economy rate could well create windows for the opposition to exploit. Though Hasan Ali’s replacement Mohammad Wasim Jr picked up three wickets, he conceded too many runs. On Friday he gave away 34 runs of 4.2 overs-an economy rate that even a part-timer would never feel proud of.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Moeen open to Test comeback for Pakistan tour","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/965392-moeen-open-to-test-comeback-for-pakistan-tour","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"NOTTINGHAM: Moeen Ali has revealed he would be willing to end his retirement from Test cricket if England ask him to tour Pakistan later this year.Moeen ended his 64-cap Test career last September after admitting he found it hard to stay motivated for the five-day form of the sport.But the...","content":"NOTTINGHAM: Moeen Ali has revealed he would be willing to end his retirement from Test cricket if England ask him to tour Pakistan later this year. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ Moeen ended his 64-cap Test career last September after admitting he found it hard to stay motivated for the five-day form of the sport. But the 34-year-old all-rounder has been impressed by new England coach Brendon McCullum’s impact during the current Test series against New Zealand. During a commentary stint on BBC’s Test Match Special on Saturday, Moeen confirmed he would be ready to tour Pakistan this winter. “When, or if, (England head coach) Baz McCullum wants me, I’ll definitely play in Pakistan,” he said. “I have played Pakistan Super League out there a few years ago but it’s not the same, to travel with an England side there having family background from that part of the world will be amazing. “It would be a historic event because of England not touring there for so many years. “I know the support and love you can get out there, they love cricket. It’s really something that’s very appealing for sure.” Kiwi McCullum and new England Test captain Ben Stokes inspired a five-wicket win over New Zealand at Lord’s in the first Test. England have found it harder in the ongoing second Test, but Moeen is intrigued at the thought of being part of the new regime. “I find it very hard to say no to him. He scares me a little bit. We’re going to have a chat and see how it pans out,” he said. “At the time I said I was retired I felt like I was done. I felt really tired with cricket.”","pubDate":"2022-06-12 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PCB rejects PSL venue story as 'speculative'","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/965396-pcb-rejects-psl-venue-story-as-speculative","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board said on Saturday the story published by ‘The News’ under the headline “Raja declares Peshawar unfit to host PSL-8” was baseless and speculative.It said in a press release that the game of cricket unites the nation and such stories...","content":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Saturday the story published by ‘The News’ under the headline “Raja declares Peshawar unfit to host PSL-8” was baseless and speculative. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ It said in a press release that the game of cricket unites the nation and such stories targeting the PCB, its units and its chairman were unfair.","pubDate":"2022-06-12 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia stunned as Sri Lankan skipper steals 3rd T20 with remarkable display of power-hitting - Wide World of Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3b3MubmluZS5jb20uYXUvY3JpY2tldC9kYXN1bi1zaGFuYWthLWlubmluZ3MtZ2l2ZXMtc3JpLWxhbmthLXdpbi1vdmVyLWF1c3RyYWxpYS0zcmQtdDIwLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvNTkyZWFkOGEtYjFkYS00YTM0LWJkYWItODIyMWRiMmQ5NGFi0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia stunned as Sri Lankan skipper steals 3rd T20 with remarkable display of power-hitting  Wide World of Sports‘Brutal hitting’: Cricket miracle stuns Aussies  news.com.auAustralia set Sri Lanka 177 to win T20I  Newcastle HeraldAussie suffers stunning final-over meltdown in ‘one of best T20 finishes ever witnessed’  Fox SportsSri Lanka beats Australia by four wickets in third T20I, smashing 59 runs off the last three overs  ABC NewsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-11 23:05:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Trescothick pleased after Ollie Pope and Alex Lees lead England fightback - The Guardian","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9zcG9ydC8yMDIyL2p1bi8xMS90cmVzY290aGljay1wbGVhc2VkLWFmdGVyLW9sbGllLXBvcGUtYW5kLWFsZXgtbGVlcy1sZWFkLWVuZ2xhbmQtZmlnaHRiYWNr0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Trescothick pleased after Ollie Pope and Alex Lees lead England fightback  The GuardianNew Zealand v England: Daryl Mitchell makes 190 on day two at Trent Bridge  BBCRuns Galore On Day 2 | Highlights | England v New Zealand- Day 2 | 2nd LV= Insurance Test 2022  England & Wales Cricket BoardEngland v New Zealand: second Test, day two – as it happened  The GuardianLAWRENCE BOOTH: The debate surrounding Jack Leach's future will not go away  Daily MailView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-11 21:57:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia vs Sri Lanka, cricket scores, third T20, player ratings: Aaron Finch returns, Steve Smith, Josh Hazlewood, wickets, runs","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/australia-vs-sri-lanka-cricket-scores-third-t20-player-ratings-aaron-finch-returns-steve-smith-josh-hazlewood-wickets-runs/news-story/d758c7518e1df504a364f9fb589548c5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia walks away with the T20 series trophy over Sri Lanka but the hosts claimed a morale-boosting win in the final match ahead of Tuesday’s first ODI.","content":"Australia walks away with the T20 series trophy over Sri Lanka but the hosts claimed a morale-boosting win in the final match ahead of Tuesday’s first ODI. It’s a sour note to end the series on for Australia, but there were many strong performances across the board, including from Aaron Finch, that will have coach Andrew McDonald pleased.

Try 14-Days Free Now > REPORT: Aussie suffers stunning final-over meltdown in ‘one of best T20 finishes ever witnessed’ AARON FINCH — 8 114 runs at 57.00, strike rate 156.16, HS 61* A welcome return to form for the under-siege Australian white ball captain, who passed 20 in all three of his innings having started it with a strong 61 not out. We are still a long way off from saying that Finch is back to his normal self, but this was a major step in the right direction. DAVID WARNER — 8.5 130 runs at 65.00, strike rate 149.42, HS 70* Australia’s topscorer and best batter for the series. Warner was also a consistent performer alongside Finch with scores of 70*, 21 and 39 carrying on from his good form in the IPL. This is the kind of display we’ve come to expect from Warner, but it shouldn’t be taken for granted. MITCH MARSH — 2.5 11 runs at 11.00, strike rate 157.14, HS 11 No wickets, economy 9.33 A quiet series for the Australian No.3 who didn’t play in the final T20 due to a calf strain. He only came to the crease once during the series, and bowled just the three overs as he was unable to make an impact on the series. As such, he scores poorly, but it’s worth noting the sheer lack of opportunity. STEVE SMITH — 6 42 runs at 42.00, strike rate 135.48, HS 37* It was a mixed bag for Smith’s two innings in this series. The first was disappointing as he lasted just four balls and contributed to a big middle-order collapse. His second, coming in the final match, was more like it. Smith scored an unbeaten 37 off 27 balls late in the innings, although it likely wasn’t sizzling enough to silence doubt about his role in T20 cricket. His brilliant fielding shouldn’t be overlooked, though, especially after a sharp run-out in the first match. GLENN MAXWELL — 6 35 runs at 17.50, strike rate 125.00, HS 19 Two wickets at 31.00, economy 7.75, BBI 2-18 With the bat, Maxwell provided some stability after a collapse in the second T20, and some quickfire runs in the middle overs during the third. He didn’t kick on either time, however, in what was ultimately a quiet series with the bat. With the ball, Maxwell was strong for the Aussies, keeping things tidy across the three matches while taking two wickets. MARCUS STOINIS — 6 47 runs at 23.50, strike rate 156.66, HS 38 Two wickets at 4.00, economy 4.00, BBI 2-8 Marcus Stoinis had little chance to do much throughout the first two matches, then exploded in the last. Having flopped with the bat in game two, he blasted 38 runs off 23 balls in game three. Without Marsh in the side, he bowled for the first time in the series and took 2-8 from his two overs. He’d score very highly for the third T20 alone, but for the entire series, it was relatively quiet for Stoinis. Australia claim Sri Lanka series win | 01:12 MATTHEW WADE — 8 39 runs unbeaten, strike rate 114.70, HS 26* Wade wasn’t dismissed in either of his two innings against Sri Lanka. His first knock in the second T20 was a picture of composure as he steadied the tourists amid a seven-wicket collapse and delivered the win. Wade then scored an unbeaten 13 off eight balls in the third T20 and would likely have liked to have faced more balls in the final over. Wore the gloves throughout the series and was tidy. JOSH INGLIS — N/A No runs at 0.00, strike rate 0.00, HS 0 Came in for Marsh for the final match and was run-out for a golden duck. Brutal. Feels unnecessarily harsh to give him a series rating, so we won’t. ASHTON AGAR — 6 No runs at 0.00, strike rate 0.00, HS 0 One wicket at 75.00, economy 6.25, BBI 1-23 Inglis wasn’t the only golden duck in the series. Agar, too, was dismissed first ball in his first and only chance with the bat this series. It was a poor dismissal at a time that Australia was reeling. As such, he’s penalised in the ratings accordingly. Ending with a positive, Agar’s work with the ball was excellent. He was hit for just 6.25 runs an over, which is no easy feat for a spinner. This included 1-23 from four overs in the final T20 when some of the Aussies were tapped around. JHYE RICHARDSON — 7 Four wickets at 18.00, economy 9.00, BBI 3-26 Replaced Starc for the final two matches and had mixed results. Richardson was brilliant in the second T20 when he took stunning figures of 3-26 to restrict Sri Lanka to a small total. He was expensive in the final match, however, going for 11.50 runs an over. That included leaking 18 runs from the 19th over in the Australian loss. KANE RICHARDSON — 7 Five wickets at 19.20, economy 9.29, BBI 4-30 The same can be said for Kane Richardson who took 4-30 in the second match but ended the series on a sour note. In the second T20, Richardson took three wickets in the final over. Naturally, he was tossed the ball to defend 19 runs off the final over in the third T20. He then bowled three wides, including on the last ball to give Sri Lanka the winning runs. Hazlewood leads Aussie T20 charge | 01:56 JOSH HAZLEWOOD — 9 Six wickets at 9.50, economy 4.75, BBI 4-16 Hazlewood was on fire for just about the entire series. His 4-16 in the first T20 was arguably the spell of the entire series for either side, while he was also hit for just 16 runs in the second T20, too. The third T20 was following the same script — Hazlewood had incredible figures of 1-3 after his first three overs on the night. Unbelievably, Dasun Shanaka clobbered his final over for 22 runs to completely change the game. A strong series for Hazlewood, nonetheless, although it was so close to being virtually perfect. MITCHELL STARC — 6 Three wickets at 8.66 economy 6.50, BBI 3-26 Starc played just the one match after bizarrely slicing his index finger on his bowling spikes. He was strong in his one appearance though, especially if you consider three of his overs came post-injury. Can’t score much higher than he has for the series having played just once.","pubDate":"2022-06-11 21:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka beats Australia by four wickets in third T20I, smashing 59 runs off the last three overs - ABC News","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA2LTEyL3N0dW5uaW5nLWRhc3VuLXNoYW5ha2EtZmluYWxlLXRod2FydHMtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi10MjBpLXN3ZWVwLzEwMTE0NTk1MNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka beats Australia by four wickets in third T20I, smashing 59 runs off the last three overs  ABC News‘Brutal hitting’: Cricket miracle stuns Aussies  news.com.auAustralia set Sri Lanka 177 to win T20I  Newcastle HeraldAussie suffers stunning final-over meltdown in ‘one of best T20 finishes ever witnessed’  Fox SportsShanaka blazes Sri Lanka to final-over win against Australia in third T20  The GuardianView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-11 21:07:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cristiano Ronaldo verpasst die Reise der Portugal Nations League in die Schweiz – Sports News, First Post","link":"https://www.neueschweizerzeitung.ch/cristiano-ronaldo-verpasst-die-reise-der-portugal-nations-league-in-die-schweiz-sports-news-first-post/","keywords":["sport"],"creator":["Sofie Sachs"],"video_url":null,"description":"Portugals Trainer Fernando Santos gab am heutigen Samstag bekannt, dass Cristiano Ronaldo, Joao Moutinho und","content":"Portugals Trainer Fernando Santos gab am heutigen Samstag bekannt, dass Cristiano Ronaldo, Joao Moutinho und Rafael Guerrero an diesem Wochenende für Portugals Nations-League-Spiel gegen die Schweiz fehlen werden.

Die drei wurden aus «administrativen» Gründen und nicht wegen Verletzung von der Reise nach Genf ausgenommen. „Es geht nicht um körperliche Probleme, es geht um das Management“, sagte Santos während einer Pressekonferenz in Lissabon. „Es würde keinen Sinn machen, mit 26 Spielern in die Schweiz zu reisen, wenn wir nur 23 Spieler auf der Bank haben können“, fügte er ohne weitere Details hinzu. Der fünfmalige Ballon d’Or-Gewinner Ronaldo nahm am letzten Training vor dem Wechsel des Teams nach Genf nicht teil. Portugal spielt am Sonntag gegen die Schweiz, um in der Nations League Tabellenführer der Gruppe B zu bleiben. Nach einem 1:1-Unentschieden in Sevilla gegen Spanien und zwei Siegen in Lissabon gegen die Schweiz erzielte Ronaldo zwei Tore, und die Tschechische Republik hat sieben Punkte, zwei Punkte Vorsprung auf die Spanier.

He struck 10 fours and two sixes in his knock as he put up 100-plus runs with Shaw in Mumbai's second innings.

Day 2 at Trent Bridge was belonging to the Black Caps, who lost just one wicket — Tom Blundell for 106 — before lunch and saw Mitchell and debutant Michael Bracewell (40 not out) add 69 more runs in the second session. Rain arrived around an hour into the session and an early tea was taken. Bracewell, whose uncles Brendon and John played test cricket for New Zealand, had already struck eight fours with powerful left-handed strokes. Mitchell, meanwhile, was cutting loose — as shown by his big six over long-on that moved him onto 149. His third fifty was scored off just 61 balls. Mitchell made it to back-to-back centuries — after 108 in the second innings of the first test New Zealand lost at Lord’s last week — before lunch and he quickly went past that previous best test score. He has made the most of being dropped twice by England, firstly by Joe Root at first slip when on just 3 on Friday. Earlier, Mitchell and Blundell combined for New Zealand’s record fifth-wicket partnership of 236 before Blundell holed out to Ben Stokes at midoff off spinner Jack Leach. It ended a stand lasting around two sessions and bettering the previous record fifth-wicket stand by the Black Caps, 222 set by Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan against Zimbabwe in Wellington in 2000. England leads the three-match series 1-0 after winning the first test by five wickets. However, a draw already looks the best the English can hope for in Nottingham after a tough start. Stuart Broad, playing on his home ground, is still without a wicket (0-86) and took to the field on Saturday hours after a pub part-owned by the fast bowler was badly damaged by a fire. The BBC reported that the roof and first floor of The Tap and Run, located in a village on the border of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, has been destroyed. “We are devastated to announce that due to a significant fire in the early hours of June 11, The Tap & Run will not be trading for the foreseeable future,” Broad and co-owner Harry Gurney said in a statement quoted by the BBC. “We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the outpouring of support.” Our code of editorial values Printable version | Jun 11, 2022 10:48:14 pm | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/new-zealand-vs-england-second-test/article65518671.ece © THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD.","pubDate":"2022-06-11 17:16:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"thehindu","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Highlights, India Vs Afghanistan, AFC Asian Cup 2023 Qualifiers: India win 2-1","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/highlights-india-vs-afghanistan-afc-asian-cup-2023-qualifiers-india-win-2-1-10782001.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"Highlights, India Vs Afghanistan, AFC Asian Cup 2023 Qualifiers: India win 2-1","content":"22:39 (IST)That was a rollercoaster of a match.

Only into its second day, the second Test match of the ongoing New Zealand’s tour of England in Nottingham has already witnessed the emergence of a couple of heroes in New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell and wicket-keeper batter Tom Blundell. Third Test centuries for both the right-handed comparatively inexperienced batters resulted in them putting on board a game-changing 236-run partnership for the fifth wicket in the morning session today. Highest fifth-wicket partnership for Kiwi batters, it is the seventh-highest against England and second-highest at Trent Bridge. Mitchell and Blundell’s rescuing act played a crucial role in powering New Zealand to 553 in 145.3 overs. Last batter to be dismissed in the first innings, Mitchell missed out on a maiden Test double century scoring 190 (318) with the help of 23 fours and four sixes. Blundell, on the other hand, scored 106 (198) including 14 fours before getting out right before the lunch break. In addition to Mitchell and Blundell’s determined knocks coming on the back of several reprieves, what caught the attention of fans watching the match from across the world was a fan named Susan. Enjoying the match from the stands with a glass of cider in her hand, Susan was left surprised when a Mitchell six resulted in the ball landing right into her glass spilling the drink. In an incident which had happened on Day 1, it had even forced the commentators into laughter. In addition to receiving a refill of the drink, Susan was also fortunate enough to be meeting Mitchell after the end of day’s play on Friday. Your slice of British culture.

Nottingham’s Trent Bridge stadium is hosting the 2nd test of the 3-match test series between England and New Zealand. The Blackcaps have an upper hand in the match due to some solid batting performances from their batters. The record 236 runs partnership between Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell settled the innings for the visitors. Both of them scored their respective centuries, where Daryl Mitchell scored 190 runs and Tom Blundell scored 106 runs. New Zealand scored a massive total of 553 runs in the first innings. The pitch at the Trent Bridge has been excellent for batting so far, and there are no visible demons. England would want to bat well in the first innings to stay in the match. The Trent Bridge stadium in Nottingham is considered to be one of the best grounds in England. Situated in the city of Nottingham, it is also the home ground of Nottinghamshire county. This ground has one of the best batting tracks in the country when it comes to white-ball cricket. With the red-ball, generally, the pacers do well here. Trent Bridge was first opened in around 1841 by William Clarke. The capacity of the ground is just over 17,500, so it is not a big stadium in terms of the crowd capacity. The boundaries at this stadium are also very small, so the batters generally enjoy batting here. ⚽️ Notts County ⚽️ Nottingham Forest 🏏 Trent Bridge The sporting Mecca. #ENGvNZ pic.twitter.com/QtSFHi1X6n — England’s Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) June 11, 2022 Apart from the ongoing test match between England and New Zealand, this ground will also host the home games of Notts Outlaws in the T20 Blast and Nottinghamshire in the County Championship.

Moeen ended his 64-cap Test career last September after admitting he found it hard to stay motivated for the five-day form of the sport. But the 34-year-old all-rounder has been impressed by new England coach Brendon McCullum 's impact during the current Test series against New Zealand. During a commentary stint on BBC's Test Match Special on Saturday, Moeen confirmed he would be ready to tour Pakistan this winter. \"When, or if, (England head coach) Baz McCullum wants me, I'll definitely play in Pakistan,\" he said. \"I have played Pakistan Super League out there a few years ago but it's not the same, to travel with an England side there having family background from that part of the world will be amazing. \"It would be a historic event because of England not touring there for so many years. \"I know the support and love you can get out there, they love cricket. It's really something that's very appealing for sure.\" Kiwi McCullum and new England Test captain Ben Stokes inspired a five-wicket win over New Zealand at Lord's in the first Test. England have found it harder in the ongoing second Test, but Moeen is intrigued at the thought of being part of the new regime. Promoted \"I find it very hard to say no to him. He scares me a little bit. We're going to have a chat and see how it pans out,\" he said. \"At the time I said I was retired I felt like I was done.

It was in October 2020 that there were reports of England playing a three-match T20I series in Pakistan in January 2021 . By November 2020, England were scheduled to play two T20Is in Pakistan in October 2021 . A consequence of New Zealand abandoning their tour of Pakistan minutes before the first ODI in Rawalpindi in September 2021 resulted in England also backing out of their Pakistan tour. However, wanting to compensate PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) for their losses, ECB (England Cricket Board) had confirmed a seven-match T20I series in Pakistan this year. As the situation improved between both the boards, a couple of Test matches were also added to the tour. While the T20Is will be played before the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 in Australia, the Tests will follow the world event. England all-rounder Moeen Ali used the terms “amazing”, “massive” and “appealing” to explain the prospect of England playing international cricket in Pakistan after as many as 16 years. “I have played PSL (Pakistan Super League) over there few years ago. But it’s not the same. To travel with an England side [there] having family background from that part of the world would be amazing. “I know the support and love you can get out there and they are massive cricket fans. It’ll be massive, very appealing,” Ali told former England players Sir Alastair Cook and Isa Guha while calling the ongoing England vs New Zealand second Test in Nottingham for BBC . Ali, 34, had represented Multan Sultans in PSL 2022 scoring 138 runs in nine innings at an average and strike rate of 17.25 and 130.19 respectively. In six bowling innings, Ali’s five wickets had come at an average of 22, an economy rate of 10 and a strike rate of 13.20. Ali, who had retired from Test cricket following India’s tour of England last year in a bid to extend his white-ball career, is in talks with England Test head coach Brendon McCullum over a possible Test comeback. Throwing light on the same, Ali didn’t mince his words while admitting that he finds it “really hard” to say no to McCullum. Hence, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Ali returns to Test cricket despite having not played a first-class match since his retirement. “I’m saying when or if Baz [Brendon] McCullum wants me, I’ll definitely play in Pakistan.

During the third T20I of the ongoing Australia’s tour of Sri Lanka in Pallekele, Australia captain Aaron Finch won the toss and chose to bat. Having won his third toss in a row, Finch has decided to bat first for the first time in the series. Playing the first match of the series at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Finch brought into picture the dry surface on offer tonight as a reason behind wanting to bat first. Finch’s rationale around the pitch slowing towards the second innings is the exact reason why Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka has bolstered his spin-bowling attack by including spinner Praveen Jayawickrama for pacer Nuwan Thushara. Much like the home team, the visitors have also made a lone change to their Playing XI. However, unlike Sri Lanka’s tactical change, Australia have had to make a forced one. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh suffering a calf strain is a reason why Australia have given an opportunity to wicket-keeper batter Josh Inglis for the first time on this tour. Inglis, 27, is playing his seventh T20I and is likely to bat in the middle-order with batter Steven Smith slated to earn a batting promotion at No. 3.

In addition to the last dead-rubber T20I, Marsh will also be unavailable for the imminent five-match ODI series as he requires a couple of weeks to recover from this latest injury. Part of Australia’s Test squad, Marsh will rehabilitate with the white-ball squad in Sri Lanka itself.

The opening duo of Tom Latham and Will Young 84 runs for the first wicket, but they both got out on continuous deliveries. Devon Conway also played a good cameo, and the Kiwis were 169-4 at one stage. Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell then took the onus on them and lead the batting of the Blackcaps. Both of them scored their individual centuries, and they combined for 236 runs for the 5th wicket, which is the highest 5th wicket partnership for New Zealand in test cricket history. Tom Blundell got out on the ball of Jack Leach at his individual score of 106 runs. Daryl Mitchell also scored his 2nd consecutive century, and was unbeaten when rain stopped the game. In a surprise event, the rain intervened the play on the day-2 of the second test between England and New Zealand.

This fan has some explaining to do 😂💤 #ENGvNZ pic.twitter.com/PTZ1nMFQGV During the Conway and Nicholls partnership, they looked so unwavering that one England fan even fell asleep, only to be suddenly woken by a Ben Stokes wicket – with the moment hilariously caught on camera. While these were useful partnerships for New Zealand, none come close to that of Mitchell and Blundell, who both scored centuries and took the team’s total from 169 to 405 runs – and the pair now average more than 100 runs together as a duo. Mitchell, who is still in at the time of writing, was dropped in the deep on 104 by Matthew Potts and, while he managed to avoid the hands of the England fielders, he did manage to plonk the ball right in a spectator’s pint of cider off the bowling of Jack Leach earlier in his innings. The first 𝗦𝗜𝗫 of the day! 💥 I think New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell owes this fan a pint! 😂🍺 #ENGvNZ pic.twitter.com/7RgbUGJzrl England have not been helped by the number of potential catches they have spilled, with the slip cordon missing out on four opportunities to take wickets on day one. James Anderson has looked decent with the ball so far in this test, but Potts and Stuart Broad have been unable to replicate their scintillating form from the first test, with the pair yet to take a wicket between them. At Lord’s, England pulled off the third-highest run chase to ever be completed at the iconic home of England cricket thanks in part to Joe Root’s 26th test century and it looks like they will need to pull off a similar feat at Trent Bridge with New Zealand showing no signs of slowing down. 888Sport – Get 8/1 England to win OR 28/1 Italy to win (£5 max stake)* – CLAIM HERE Deposit min £/$/€10 using promo code 888ODDS • Bet up to £/$/€5 on your selection at normal odds in the regular market • If your selection wins, we’ll pay you out at the normal price and any extra winnings from the advertised enhanced price will be paid to you in Free Bets • Free Bets are granted within 72 hours and expire after 7 days • Free Bet stakes are not included in returns • Deposit balance is available for withdrawal at any time • Restrictions apply to withdrawals, payment methods and countries & Full T&C’s apply 18+ begambleaware.org","pubDate":"2022-06-11 13:40:12","image_url":null,"source_id":"talksport","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"LIVE AUS vs SL 3rd T20, Live Cricket Score, Match Updates: Aus win toss; opt to bat; Mitchell Marsh misses out","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/live-aus-vs-sl-3rd-t20-live-cricket-score-match-updates-injury-update-dream-11-pitch-report-2022-06-11-783864","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LIVE AUS vs SL 3rd T20, Live Cricket Score, Match Updates: Aus win toss; opt to bat; Mitchell Marsh misses out","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-11 13:28:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PRS vs UCC Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for ECS Czech Republic T10 2022, Bronze Final","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/prs-vs-ucc-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-ecs-czech-republic-t10-2022-bronze-final?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Ishaan Mahajan"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Prague Spartans CC (PRS) will take on United CC (UCC) in the Bronze Final match of the ECS Czech Republic 2022 on Saturday at the Vinor Cricket Ground in Prague.

Batsmen should have no trouble playing on the pitch since the ball comes on the bat easily. The pacers should be able to get some movement in the middle overs. In the second innings, batting is relatively easier because the ball comes to the bat nicely, so both teams will prefer to chase after winning the toss. Wicket-keeper A Singh is, without a doubt, the best wicket-keeper for today's Dream11 team, having performed admirably in recent ECS matches. He smashed 51 runs in just 27 balls against BRN. Batters P Bagauly and A Sharma are the two best batter picks for the Dream11 team. K Venkataswamy is another good pick for today's Dream11 team. All-rounders N Dhekshnamoorthy and S Sengupta are the best all-rounder picks for the Dream11 team as they performed well in this year's tournament. P Baghel is another good all-rounder pick for the Dream11 team. Bowlers The top bowler picks for today's Dream11 team are N Tyagi and Z Iqbal.

Mitchell and Blundell surpassed a 22-year old record held by Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan. It was during the Boxing Day Test of 2000 against Zimbabwe in Wellington when Astle and McMillan had joined hands for a 222-run partnership.

The partnership was eventually broken on the stroke of lunch break when Blundell stepped out to England spinner Jack Leach only to hit an ordinary delivery straight to Ben Stokes at mid-off.
