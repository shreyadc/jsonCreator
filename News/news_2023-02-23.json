Published on By Wickramabahu National School, Gampola athletes Nirmali Wickramasinghe and Dulanjana Pradeepani reached qualifying standards to represent Sri Lanka at the Asian Youth Athletics Championships as they won the first and second places of the 1500 metres in a tape finish at the selection trial held at Diyagama on Wednesday. Nirmali, who missed the qualifying time by milliseconds in the 800 metres on Tuesday came up with a spirited effort to stop the clock under the locally set qualifying mark yesterday. Dulanjana too gave her best to finish under the qualifying standard. The athletes trained by Buddhika Nuwan clocked 4:47.89 seconds to finish head to head. The qualifying mark set for the discipline was 4:48.00 seconds. The duo were the only athletes to reach standards on day two as sprinters struggled to deliver under sweltering heat. A total of six athletes reached qualifying standards Sri Lanka Athletics conducted the trial to pick Sri Lanka’s team for the Asian Youth Championships which will be held in Uzbekistan in April. Incidentally, Wickramasinghe will be representing Sri Lanka for the second consecutive time at this meet. In 2022, she won the silver medal of the 800 metres at the event held in Kuwait. However she is not the only athlete making it to the Asian Youth Championships for the second consecutive time. D.S.

Published on By Usually, when the Australians are in town, you look forward to the cricket for they play hard and are a tough bunch well-equipped to come on top of the demanding conditions. In 2004 when the Aussies toured Sri Lanka, Hashan Thilakaratne’s side took the first-innings lead in all three Tests, but Ricky Ponting’s team bounced back and won all three games. The current Australian side lacks the fighting spirit of teams of yesteryear. In less than six days of Test cricket in Nagpur and Delhi they have handed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to the Indians on a platter. The sweep proved to be their undoing. Beating India in their backyard is no easy task. With not many runs on the board, the Australians decided the easiest way to score them was the sweep and in the end played into the hands of the Indian spinners. If you take players who have succeeded in playing spin in Asia, their strength hasn’t been the sweep. It was common sense for those were practical men. Brian Lara played the 2001 series in Sri Lanka when Murali was at his peak. He gave everyone a lesson on how to counter spin. His strengths were trusting his defence and using his feet. Depending on where the ball pitched, Lara would decide how he would counter the ball. There were not many backfoot scoring shots, unless the ball was short and there to be pulled. Mostly it was a case of tight defence and when there was a scoring opportunity to use the feet and find the gap. Yes, there was the sweep as well. But it didn’t involve much risk. If the ball was pitched outside the leg stump and the sweep would bring him a maximum of four runs, he would sweep. Otherwise, he just played the waiting game. That’s what Test cricket is all about. Lara made 688 runs in six innings in that series. By sweeping even the balls pitched on the stumps, the Aussies are taking too much risk. There’s protection on the boundary and the most you would get by sweeping is two runs. The risk is not worth it. Then, if you miss, on tracks where there’s little bounce, you are a sitting duck being a prime lbw suspect. Just look at how many batters were dismissed lbw in the series. Not just Lara, other batters like Stephen Fleming, Andy Flower, Matthew Hayden and Joe Root have been successful in tackling spin in the sub-continent. Hayden was a big sweeper but others if you take them had strengths like patience, solid defence and use of the feet to their advantage. In the Australian side, everyone is sweeping. The moment Usman Khawaja had some success playing the sweep in Delhi, the others too had made up their minds that they are going to live by the sweep forgetting that the chances of them perishing by a high-risk stroke were heavy. Mind you nobody ended up top edging and getting caught trying to play the sweep. All the batters completely missed the sweep and were either bowled or given out leg before wicket. They need to sort their game before Indore. Published on By Losing the first match of the Women’s T20 World Cup to Sri Lanka put the hosts on a slippery slope from which they had to claw their way back. On a cool Tuesday night, returning to Newlands for the first time since that defeat, they restricted Bangladesh to 113 for 6 despite a nervy performance in the field and then reached their target with 13 balls to spare.

Start your free trial now > At 29, the snub could make it hard for Agar to get back in the Test team, given he’s slipped down the pecking order but he was circumspect about where he sits. “It’s not an ideal situation but you just try and make the best of it,” he said. “I’m 29 now and been through plenty of ups and downs in the game. I’m in a fortunate position so it’s nothing that stresses me out too much. “There was really clear messaging, they communicated with me and it’s a clear path forward with that message, it’s chin up, walk tall and try and improve. Ashton Agar in Delhi, India. (Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images “There’s no bitterness around this sort of stuff any more, that’s an old school mentality. I just try and give as much as I can and help where I can.” Selector Tony Dodemaide said Agar had “worked his backside off” in India but they didn’t feel he posed as much of a threat to India’s batters as Kuhnemann. Agar, who will return to India in Australia’s ODI team for a series in March, said a lack of red-ball games in recent years didn’t help his cause. “It’s been pretty hard for me recently to be fair, I’ve played like three red-ball games in three years,” he told Channel 10 in Perth. “It’s hard to expect that part of my game to be in tip-top, perfect shape. But I’ll always compete as hard as I can and give as much as I can to a team. It’s just whether I get that chance, I’ll play as well as I can and see what happens.” Ashton Agar in Nagpur. Photo by INDRANIL MUKHERJEE / AFP) Source: AFP The West Australian was confident he had the resilience to keep pushing his national cause. “I do feel like I am pretty resilient and try and front up every day with a smile on my face and be part of a team,” Agar said. “Going go India is really hard, individually it‘s hard and it’s bloody hard as a team especially against that team at the moment, they are unbelievable. “I think controlling my attitude had been a strength of mine over the last few years and I am certainly enjoying my cricket a lot more because of that. You definitely bounce back a little quickly from setbacks.”","pubDate":"2023-02-22 22:05:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"If not now, then ever?

It may signal the crumbling of an era which never quite managed to attain greatness. David Warner may have played his last Test. Credit: Getty Images Because as this ageing side peer at a pinnacle they can now never reach, winning a Test series in India after collapsing in the first two Tests, they are standing on the edge of a precipice. David Warner may have already tumbled over the edge, subbed out of the second Test with concussion and sent home with a hair line fracture after being struck on the elbow. The greatest all-format player Australia has produced, at aged 36 his Test performances have clearly dropped off, save for an epic double century during the Boxing Day Test . There is now considerable doubt whether he will be chosen for the Ashes tour later this year given his last tour in 2019 was made a misery by Stuart Broad. Warner scored 95 runs at 9.5 in the five Tests with eight single figure scores, including three successive ducks. Warner was beaten home by Josh Hazlewood, 32, who is carrying an Achilles problem. He has played just four Tests during the past two seasons because of side strains. India’s conveyor belt of both batting and bowling talent appears to be never-ending, and under home conditions they have proven to be nearly unbeatable. While Australia’s future bowling stocks look encouraging, the next generation of batsmen do not. Try picking a side for the 2027 tour of India without Warner, Usman Khawaja, 36, and Steve Smith, 33. From the team currently in India, Marnus Labuschagne, 28, Travis Head, 29, and Cameron Green, 23, should become the backbone of Australia’s batting. Peter Handscomb, 31, may yet have a career revival. In 18 Tests he averages 39 and appears one of the few batsmen with a simple and clear-headed method against India’s deceptive spinners. At 36 Usman Khawaja is in the twilight of his career. Credit: Getty Images Matthew Renshaw, 26, once gave the impression that he would also be a big part of Australia’s future. Called into the Test squad at the age of 20, Renshaw scored 184 in his fourth Test, against Pakistan at the SCG, opening the batting. Six of his first ten scores were 30 or better, including a pair of 60s on the 2017 tour of India. But whatever he learnt on that tour hasn’t translated this time around with scores of 0 and 2 in the first Test before being dropped, then brought back as a concussion sub for Warner, scoring just 2. Renshaw has shown he can bat anywhere, so he could return as an opening batsman in the post Warner/Khawaja world if he can straighten his game out. In 14 Tests he has averaged 29. Marcus Harris, 30, has dominated for Victoria and been flirting with the Test side since his debut in 2018. In 14 Tests he averages 25 without a century. Marnus Labuschagne is a vital part of Australia’s future Credit: Getty Images Cameron Bancroft, 30, is currently the leading run scorer in the Sheffield Shield and may earn another chance. The West Australian made his Test debut in 2017 and in ten Tests has averaged 26 without a century. Australia A tours have been a reliable window to the selectors’ thinking. In 2018, the most productive players on Australia’s most recent A tour to India were Khawaja, Labuschagne, Head and Handscomb. South Australian opening batsman Henry Hunt, 26, was part of the A tour to Sri Lanka in June last year. After failing in the first unofficial Test, Hunt and wicket-keeper Jimmy Peirson made centuries in the second game to chase down 370 for victory. Unfortunately, Hunt has struggled for consistency over four seasons, averaging less than 36 in first class cricket across 35 matches. He made 1 and 0 in the Shield match against Victoria that began on Monday. Like the batting without Smith and Warner, Australia will be unable to adequately replace most of the imposing quartet of Pat Cummins, Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon over the next few years. However, the bowling looks more promising than the batting with “Wild Thing” Lance Armstrong and spinners Todd Murphy, injured leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha from NSW and Matt Kuhnemann.

Meanwhile, Anderson, who will celebrate his 41st birthday this year, becomes the oldest No. 1 Test bowler since 1936, when Australian spin bowler Clarrie Grimmett reigned supreme. It marks the sixth time he has gone to the top of the rankings during his illustrious career. Anderson, who has 682 Test wickets in 178 matches, claimed 7-54 during last week’s crushing 267-run victory over New Zealand at Mount Maunganui. The right-armer, who made his international debut in 2002, has taken 202 Test wickets at 20.56 since his 35th birthday. Last week, his career bowling average dropped below 26 for the first time since 2003.

The 29-year-old flew home to Sydney earlier this week due to a private family matter, but he’s expected to return to India ahead of the third Test in Indore, which gets underway on Wednesday.

However, a World Cup gold medal – across formats — remains out of reach. The post India batter Smriti Mandhana continues to collect individual accolades, but the World Cup remains elusive appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Smriti Mandhana recently became the most expensive player heading into the maiden Women’s Premier League (WPL) – an overdue women’s iteration of the highly successful and popular Indian Premier League (IPL). The 26-year-old Indian opener and former teenage prodigy – who has risen to global superstar status since making her T20 international debut for India as a 16-year-old back in 2013, fetched the highest fee at the maiden WPL auction a fortnight ago. Smriti Mandhana of India prior to the T20 International series between India and Australia at Brabourne Stadium on December 17, 2022 in Mumbai, India. (Photo: Pankaj Nangia / Getty Images) Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) splurged 34-million Indian rupees (R7.3-million) to secure the services of the left-handed batter. This took a huge chunk of RCB’s R26-million purse for the auction. “WPL is going to be a game-changer for women’s cricket in India. It will especially provide a boost of confidence for women cricketers playing on domestic teams, and give them the validation that they truly deserve,” Mandhana told GQ India in December 2022. At the time, the RCB captain couldn’t have imagined she’d be the crown jewel of the inaugural season and something of a poster girl for the competition. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations Those that have eagerly followed her career over the years will tell you that she was worth every cent the franchise spent on her ahead of the competition’s kick-off on 4 March – a couple of weeks after the ongoing Women’s T20 World Cup concludes. Mandhana – who serves as vice-captain in the Indian team – is well-respected in her home country, as well as globally. As evidence, she has won the ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year gong twice. The only other player that has received the accolade more than once is Australian legend Ellyse Perry – with three. With time very much on her side and the Indian batter always improving on her craft – she is likely to match and even usurp Perry’s haul. Mandhana also holds the record for the fastest 50 by an Indian woman in T20 internationals. The electric opener, who possesses an array of shots and the accuracy of a sniper, raced to a record half-century in just 23 balls at last year’s Commonwealth Games semifinal win over England. That innings beat her own record of a 24-ball half-ton against New Zealand in 2019. Impressively, she is also third on the list. Playing against England in Mumbai (her city of birth) she reached the 50-run milestone from 25 balls. Mandhana picked up a bat when it was not as socially acceptable as it is now for young girls and women to play cricket. Especially in a conservative, though cricket-crazy country such as India. The sport was popular in her family, with her father and older brother playing it at district level. The latter was particularly influential on the Indian star. The young Mandhana would follow her brother when he went to play for the local team. By this time, the family had left Mumbai and moved to the city of Sangli. This is where the star batter’s powers truly came to the fore – with her father also a great influence in helping her realise the dream of playing cricket as a career – though at the time the trajectory of women’s cricket was far from what it is now. “I got quite lucky with my family. It was their dream for me to become a cricketer. A few relatives did express concern about my decision to play the sport professionally, but that never deterred me. I always knew what I wanted to be and overall, I’ve always had people’s support,” Mandhana said in a recent interview with Vogue India . By the age of nine the opener was part of the Maharashtra state’s under-15 side. Her innate talent was visible for all to see. Hence, she was promoted to the under-19 side – at the wee age of 11.

(Photo: Michael Sheehan / Gallo Images) Five years later she was making her debut for the Indian national team. To demonstrate that she was born to be a star, Mandhana top-scored with 39 runs as her country beat Bangladesh by 10. She hasn’t looked back since. In spite of all her individual achievements, as well as being one of most sought-after T20 players in domestic leagues around the world, Mandhana and India are yet to win a World Cup. With the Indians pitted against the irrepressible Australia in the semifinals of the T20 international showpiece, it is highly possible the wait may be a bit longer for the left-handed batter and her compatriots. The Australians are the record T20 champions and vanquished India to clinch their fifth world title in the shortest international format, and their third in a row – in 202o. Mandhana will be crucial if the Indians are to upset the defending champions and book a second consecutive appearance in the World Cup final when the two sides clash at Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town tomorrow. She warmed up perfectly for a starring role in that crunch tie – notching up her highest T20 international total (87) to help India book their spot in the last four with a five-run win over Ireland. The haul took her to second on the run-scorers list in the current World Cup – with a return of 149 from the three matches she has played. England’s Nat Sciver-Brunt leads the pack on 176 runs, though she has played one more match than Mandhana. Against Australia, India will need all their players to be at their optimum. They will pin their hopes on Mandhana to once again spearhead the charge – as she has consistently done over the past 10 years.

Living with his family in Wellington, New Zealand - where he returns this week to lead England in their second Test match against the Blackcaps - Stokes led his side Plimmerton on an unlikely cup run. They were due to come up against a side against whom they were 'on a hiding to nothing', but Stokes was unavailable due to suffering a broken arm prior to the match. His mother was adamant he would not be playing in the fixture, but dad Ged had other ideas. Ben Stokes agrees to leave IPL early to lead England into Ireland Test before Ashes England icon James Anderson named best bowler in the world for SIXTH time in seven years A renowned rugby league player, who moved to England to coach Cumbrian sides Workington and Whitehaven in later life, no-nonsense Ged had previously had part of his left middle finger amputated as he saw it as preferable to missing matches. It's the reasoning behind Stokes' trademark celebration - and may go some way to explaining what happened all those years ago back in New Zealand. Stokes had been due to attend the match as a spectator only, but arrived at school with his cricket kit and with no cast on his arm. Dad Ged had cut it off. The Durham all-rounder went on to score a century, albeit in a losing effort to the eventual national champions. Stokes' trademark celebration in tribute to dad Ged ( Image: Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Popperfoto via Getty Images) \"I first saw him play cricket in trials for the school team,\" coach Mike Smellie told the BBC. \"Young kids usually want to pull, hook and hit the ball behind square. Ben would hit them out of the school ground, aged 10, straight. He could absolutely smash it. \"We kept winning. We won and won and won, and Ben was consistently making big scores. We were calling ourselves the juggernaut. We got through to play Palmerston North, a much bigger school in a massive cricket area. We were on a hiding to nothing, 100-1 and drifting. \"I was asking if he could play and he said he had another three weeks in plaster. I rang his mum, pretending to talk about something else. We got on to cricket and she said no. The day before the game, I was talking to him and said he might as well come to watch. \"The next day, he walked up the school driveway, pulling his cricket bag with no cast on his arm. I said 'what's going on?' He said 'Dad got out the scissors and cut it off this morning'.\" Ged sadly died in December 2020 after a brave battle with brain cancer, aged 65. Stokes with dad Ged in April 2017 Last year, Stokes admitted that not being able to see his dad before his death due to IPL commitments made him 'hate cricket'. “The last time I saw Dad was leaving New Zealand to go to the Indian Premier League – that was dictated by cricket,\" he said. \"He wanted me to go, he really loved me playing for Rajasthan Royals and the people there. But it made me hate cricket, I thought it was the reason I didn’t see my dad before he died. I should have opened up about it sooner. \"I just thought ‘cricket, cricket, cricket’. It’s not a regret… but I’d do things differently… So I had a real thing with cricket at the time I took a break. I was really angry at the sport because it was dictating when I could see my dad.” Read More Australian cricket great Matthew Hayden mocks debacle vs India as photo emerges Read More James Anderson and Stuart Broad \"setting the standard\" for 'Bazball' says Ben Stokes Read More Ben Stokes admits England are facing an \"absolute selection nightmare\" ahead of the Ashes Read More Michael Atherton pinpoints England's \"real problem\" ahead of the Ashes Read More Alastair Cook identifies England's \"real big change\" that doesn't \"take the highlights\"","pubDate":"2023-02-22 18:14:12","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29287293.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Ben-Stokes-aged-15-with-his-parents.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Upper Great Southern Cricket Association top four to be decided in final round of fixtures","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/narrogin-observer/upper-great-southern-cricket-association-top-four-to-be-decided-in-final-round-of-fixtures-c-9821021","keywords":null,"creator":["Calvin Sims"],"video_url":null,"description":"A sparkling century by Jack Blechynden set up Pingelly-Noonebin’s commanding win.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-02-22 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-9821021/44f1f3a228eea4b805bb9915eb58a6bc2003ec47-16x9-x122y218w1716h965.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Thrilling super over decides annual T20 Slam match in Upper Great Southern Cricket Association","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/narrogin-observer/thrilling-super-over-decides-annual-t20-slam-match-in-upper-great-southern-cricket-association--c-9820908","keywords":null,"creator":["Cameron Newbold"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Old Dogs won the first two editions of the T20 showcase but the Young Guns have squared the ledger after wins in 2022 and now 2023.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-02-22 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-9820908/76922d9bbff7eb56cdcd36f7a927765afa1e1b9b-16x9-x0y270w5184h2916.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bandaranaike meet Al-Humaisara at Surrey Village today","link":"http://island.lk/bandaranaike-meet-al-humaisara-at-surrey-village-today/","keywords":["Sports","‘Victory Cup’ Cricket Encounter","Al-Humaisara National School Team","Bandaranaike National School Team"],"creator":["Sahan Weerasooriya"],"video_url":null,"description":"‘Victory Cup’ Cricket Encounter Bandaranaike National School, Payagala will meet Al-Humaisara National School, Beruwala in a limited-overs cricket encounter at Surrey Village Ground, Maggona today (23).

She will be competing to match standards in the 1500 metres today. Published on By Usually, when the Australians are in town, you look forward to the cricket for they play hard and are a tough bunch well-equipped to come on top of the demanding conditions. In 2004 when the Aussies toured Sri Lanka, Hashan Thilakaratne’s side took the first-innings lead in all three Tests, but Ricky Ponting’s team bounced back and won all three games. The current Australian side lacks the fighting spirit of teams of yesteryear. In less than six days of Test cricket in Nagpur and Delhi they have handed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to the Indians on a platter. The sweep proved to be their undoing. Beating India in their backyard is no easy task. With not many runs on the board, the Australians decided the easiest way to score them was the sweep and in the end played into the hands of the Indian spinners. If you take players who have succeeded in playing spin in Asia, their strength hasn’t been the sweep. It was common sense for those were practical men. Brian Lara played the 2001 series in Sri Lanka when Murali was at his peak. He gave everyone a lesson on how to counter spin. His strengths were trusting his defence and using his feet. Depending on where the ball pitched, Lara would decide how he would counter the ball. There were not many backfoot scoring shots, unless the ball was short and there to be pulled. Mostly it was a case of tight defence and when there was a scoring opportunity to use the feet and find the gap. Yes, there was the sweep as well. But it didn’t involve much risk. If the ball was pitched outside the leg stump and the sweep would bring him a maximum of four runs, he would sweep. Otherwise, he just played the waiting game. That’s what Test cricket is all about. Lara made 688 runs in six innings in that series. By sweeping even the balls pitched on the stumps, the Aussies are taking too much risk. There’s protection on the boundary and the most you would get by sweeping is two runs. The risk is not worth it. Then, if you miss, on tracks where there’s little bounce, you are a sitting duck being a prime lbw suspect. Just look at how many batters were dismissed lbw in the series. Not just Lara, other batters like Stephen Fleming, Andy Flower, Matthew Hayden and Joe Root have been successful in tackling spin in the sub-continent. Hayden was a big sweeper but others if you take them had strengths like patience, solid defence and use of the feet to their advantage. In the Australian side, everyone is sweeping. The moment Usman Khawaja had some success playing the sweep in Delhi, the others too had made up their minds that they are going to live by the sweep forgetting that the chances of them perishing by a high-risk stroke were heavy. Mind you nobody ended up top edging and getting caught trying to play the sweep. All the batters completely missed the sweep and were either bowled or given out leg before wicket. They need to sort their game before Indore. Published on By Losing the first match of the Women’s T20 World Cup to Sri Lanka put the hosts on a slippery slope from which they had to claw their way back. On a cool Tuesday night, returning to Newlands for the first time since that defeat, they restricted Bangladesh to 113 for 6 despite a nervy performance in the field and then reached their target with 13 balls to spare.

I’m in a fortunate position so it’s nothing that stresses me out too much. “There was really clear messaging, they communicated with me and it’s a clear path forward with that message, it’s chin up, walk tall and try and improve.

I just try and give as much as I can and help where I can.” Selector Tony Dodemaide said Agar had “worked his backside off” in India but they didn’t feel he posed as much of a threat to India’s batters as Kuhnemann. Agar, who will return to India in Australia’s ODI team for a series in March, said a lack of red-ball games in recent years didn’t help his cause. “It’s been pretty hard for me recently to be fair, I’ve played like three red-ball games in three years,” he told Channel 10 in Perth. “It’s hard to expect that part of my game to be in tip-top, perfect shape. But I’ll always compete as hard as I can and give as much as I can to a team. It’s just whether I get that chance, I’ll play as well as I can and see what happens.” Ashton Agar in Nagpur.

It may signal the crumbling of an era which never quite managed to attain greatness. David Warner may have played his last Test. Credit: Getty Images Because as this ageing side peer at a pinnacle they can now never reach, winning a Test series in India after collapsing in the first two Tests, they are standing on the edge of a precipice. David Warner may have already tumbled over the edge, subbed out of the second Test with concussion and sent home with a hair line fracture after being struck on the elbow. The greatest all-format player Australia has produced, at aged 36 his Test performances have clearly dropped off, save for an epic double century during the Boxing Day Test . There is now considerable doubt whether he will be chosen for the Ashes tour later this year given his last tour in 2019 was made a misery by Stuart Broad. Warner scored 95 runs at 9.5 in the five Tests with eight single figure scores, including three successive ducks. Warner was beaten home by Josh Hazlewood, 32, who is carrying an Achilles problem. He has played just four Tests during the past two seasons because of side strains. India’s conveyor belt of both batting and bowling talent appears to be never-ending, and under home conditions they have proven to be nearly unbeatable. While Australia’s future bowling stocks look encouraging, the next generation of batsmen do not. Try picking a side for the 2027 tour of India without Warner, Usman Khawaja, 36, and Steve Smith, 33. From the team currently in India, Marnus Labuschagne, 28, Travis Head, 29, and Cameron Green, 23, should become the backbone of Australia’s batting. Peter Handscomb, 31, may yet have a career revival. In 18 Tests he averages 39 and appears one of the few batsmen with a simple and clear-headed method against India’s deceptive spinners. At 36 Usman Khawaja is in the twilight of his career. Credit: Getty Images Matthew Renshaw, 26, once gave the impression that he would also be a big part of Australia’s future. Called into the Test squad at the age of 20, Renshaw scored 184 in his fourth Test, against Pakistan at the SCG, opening the batting. Six of his first ten scores were 30 or better, including a pair of 60s on the 2017 tour of India. But whatever he learnt on that tour hasn’t translated this time around with scores of 0 and 2 in the first Test before being dropped, then brought back as a concussion sub for Warner, scoring just 2. Renshaw has shown he can bat anywhere, so he could return as an opening batsman in the post Warner/Khawaja world if he can straighten his game out. In 14 Tests he has averaged 29. Marcus Harris, 30, has dominated for Victoria and been flirting with the Test side since his debut in 2018. In 14 Tests he averages 25 without a century. Marnus Labuschagne is a vital part of Australia’s future Credit: Getty Images Cameron Bancroft, 30, is currently the leading run scorer in the Sheffield Shield and may earn another chance. The West Australian made his Test debut in 2017 and in ten Tests has averaged 26 without a century. Australia A tours have been a reliable window to the selectors’ thinking. In 2018, the most productive players on Australia’s most recent A tour to India were Khawaja, Labuschagne, Head and Handscomb. South Australian opening batsman Henry Hunt, 26, was part of the A tour to Sri Lanka in June last year. After failing in the first unofficial Test, Hunt and wicket-keeper Jimmy Peirson made centuries in the second game to chase down 370 for victory. Unfortunately, Hunt has struggled for consistency over four seasons, averaging less than 36 in first class cricket across 35 matches. He made 1 and 0 in the Shield match against Victoria that began on Monday. Like the batting without Smith and Warner, Australia will be unable to adequately replace most of the imposing quartet of Pat Cummins, Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon over the next few years. However, the bowling looks more promising than the batting with “Wild Thing” Lance Armstrong and spinners Todd Murphy, injured leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha from NSW and Matt Kuhnemann.

Meanwhile, Anderson, who will celebrate his 41st birthday this year, becomes the oldest No. 1 Test bowler since 1936, when Australian spin bowler Clarrie Grimmett reigned supreme. It marks the sixth time he has gone to the top of the rankings during his illustrious career. Anderson, who has 682 Test wickets in 178 matches, claimed 7-54 during last week’s crushing 267-run victory over New Zealand at Mount Maunganui. The right-armer, who made his international debut in 2002, has taken 202 Test wickets at 20.56 since his 35th birthday.

However, a World Cup gold medal – across formats — remains out of reach. The post India batter Smriti Mandhana continues to collect individual accolades, but the World Cup remains elusive appeared first on Daily Maverick.","content":"Smriti Mandhana recently became the most expensive player heading into the maiden Women’s Premier League (WPL) – an overdue women’s iteration of the highly successful and popular Indian Premier League (IPL). The 26-year-old Indian opener and former teenage prodigy – who has risen to global superstar status since making her T20 international debut for India as a 16-year-old back in 2013, fetched the highest fee at the maiden WPL auction a fortnight ago. Smriti Mandhana of India prior to the T20 International series between India and Australia at Brabourne Stadium on December 17, 2022 in Mumbai, India. (Photo: Pankaj Nangia / Getty Images) Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) splurged 34-million Indian rupees (R7.3-million) to secure the services of the left-handed batter. This took a huge chunk of RCB’s R26-million purse for the auction. “WPL is going to be a game-changer for women’s cricket in India. It will especially provide a boost of confidence for women cricketers playing on domestic teams, and give them the validation that they truly deserve,” Mandhana told GQ India in December 2022. At the time, the RCB captain couldn’t have imagined she’d be the crown jewel of the inaugural season and something of a poster girl for the competition. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations Those that have eagerly followed her career over the years will tell you that she was worth every cent the franchise spent on her ahead of the competition’s kick-off on 4 March – a couple of weeks after the ongoing Women’s T20 World Cup concludes. Mandhana – who serves as vice-captain in the Indian team – is well-respected in her home country, as well as globally. As evidence, she has won the ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year gong twice. The only other player that has received the accolade more than once is Australian legend Ellyse Perry – with three. With time very much on her side and the Indian batter always improving on her craft – she is likely to match and even usurp Perry’s haul. Mandhana also holds the record for the fastest 50 by an Indian woman in T20 internationals. The electric opener, who possesses an array of shots and the accuracy of a sniper, raced to a record half-century in just 23 balls at last year’s Commonwealth Games semifinal win over England. That innings beat her own record of a 24-ball half-ton against New Zealand in 2019. Impressively, she is also third on the list. Playing against England in Mumbai (her city of birth) she reached the 50-run milestone from 25 balls. Mandhana picked up a bat when it was not as socially acceptable as it is now for young girls and women to play cricket. Especially in a conservative, though cricket-crazy country such as India. The sport was popular in her family, with her father and older brother playing it at district level. The latter was particularly influential on the Indian star. The young Mandhana would follow her brother when he went to play for the local team. By this time, the family had left Mumbai and moved to the city of Sangli. This is where the star batter’s powers truly came to the fore – with her father also a great influence in helping her realise the dream of playing cricket as a career – though at the time the trajectory of women’s cricket was far from what it is now. “I got quite lucky with my family. It was their dream for me to become a cricketer. A few relatives did express concern about my decision to play the sport professionally, but that never deterred me. I always knew what I wanted to be and overall, I’ve always had people’s support,” Mandhana said in a recent interview with Vogue India . By the age of nine the opener was part of the Maharashtra state’s under-15 side. Her innate talent was visible for all to see. Hence, she was promoted to the under-19 side – at the wee age of 11. Smriti Mandhana during the Women ’ s T20I Tri-Series match between India and West Indies at Buffalo Park on 23 January 2023 in East London, South Africa. (Photo: Michael Sheehan / Gallo Images) Five years later she was making her debut for the Indian national team. To demonstrate that she was born to be a star, Mandhana top-scored with 39 runs as her country beat Bangladesh by 10. She hasn’t looked back since. In spite of all her individual achievements, as well as being one of most sought-after T20 players in domestic leagues around the world, Mandhana and India are yet to win a World Cup. With the Indians pitted against the irrepressible Australia in the semifinals of the T20 international showpiece, it is highly possible the wait may be a bit longer for the left-handed batter and her compatriots. The Australians are the record T20 champions and vanquished India to clinch their fifth world title in the shortest international format, and their third in a row – in 202o. Mandhana will be crucial if the Indians are to upset the defending champions and book a second consecutive appearance in the World Cup final when the two sides clash at Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town tomorrow. She warmed up perfectly for a starring role in that crunch tie – notching up her highest T20 international total (87) to help India book their spot in the last four with a five-run win over Ireland. The haul took her to second on the run-scorers list in the current World Cup – with a return of 149 from the three matches she has played. England’s Nat Sciver-Brunt leads the pack on 176 runs, though she has played one more match than Mandhana. Against Australia, India will need all their players to be at their optimum. They will pin their hopes on Mandhana to once again spearhead the charge – as she has consistently done over the past 10 years.

Living with his family in Wellington, New Zealand - where he returns this week to lead England in their second Test match against the Blackcaps - Stokes led his side Plimmerton on an unlikely cup run. They were due to come up against a side against whom they were 'on a hiding to nothing', but Stokes was unavailable due to suffering a broken arm prior to the match. His mother was adamant he would not be playing in the fixture, but dad Ged had other ideas. Ben Stokes agrees to leave IPL early to lead England into Ireland Test before Ashes England icon James Anderson named best bowler in the world for SIXTH time in seven years A renowned rugby league player, who moved to England to coach Cumbrian sides Workington and Whitehaven in later life, no-nonsense Ged had previously had part of his left middle finger amputated as he saw it as preferable to missing matches. It's the reasoning behind Stokes' trademark celebration - and may go some way to explaining what happened all those years ago back in New Zealand. Stokes had been due to attend the match as a spectator only, but arrived at school with his cricket kit and with no cast on his arm. Dad Ged had cut it off. The Durham all-rounder went on to score a century, albeit in a losing effort to the eventual national champions. Stokes' trademark celebration in tribute to dad Ged ( Image: Philip Brown/Popperfoto/Popperfoto via Getty Images) \"I first saw him play cricket in trials for the school team,\" coach Mike Smellie told the BBC. \"Young kids usually want to pull, hook and hit the ball behind square. Ben would hit them out of the school ground, aged 10, straight. He could absolutely smash it. \"We kept winning. We won and won and won, and Ben was consistently making big scores. We were calling ourselves the juggernaut. We got through to play Palmerston North, a much bigger school in a massive cricket area. We were on a hiding to nothing, 100-1 and drifting. \"I was asking if he could play and he said he had another three weeks in plaster. I rang his mum, pretending to talk about something else. We got on to cricket and she said no. The day before the game, I was talking to him and said he might as well come to watch. \"The next day, he walked up the school driveway, pulling his cricket bag with no cast on his arm. I said 'what's going on?' He said 'Dad got out the scissors and cut it off this morning'.\" Ged sadly died in December 2020 after a brave battle with brain cancer, aged 65. Stokes with dad Ged in April 2017 Last year, Stokes admitted that not being able to see his dad before his death due to IPL commitments made him 'hate cricket'. “The last time I saw Dad was leaving New Zealand to go to the Indian Premier League – that was dictated by cricket,\" he said. \"He wanted me to go, he really loved me playing for Rajasthan Royals and the people there. But it made me hate cricket, I thought it was the reason I didn’t see my dad before he died. I should have opened up about it sooner. \"I just thought ‘cricket, cricket, cricket’. It’s not a regret… but I’d do things differently… So I had a real thing with cricket at the time I took a break.

Published on By Usually, when the Australians are in town, you look forward to the cricket for they play hard and are a tough bunch well-equipped to come on top of the demanding conditions. In 2004 when the Aussies toured Sri Lanka, Hashan Thilakaratne’s side took the first-innings lead in all three Tests, but Ricky Ponting’s team bounced back and won all three games. The current Australian side lacks the fighting spirit of teams of yesteryear. In less than six days of Test cricket in Nagpur and Delhi they have handed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to the Indians on a platter. The sweep proved to be their undoing. Beating India in their backyard is no easy task. With not many runs on the board, the Australians decided the easiest way to score them was the sweep and in the end played into the hands of the Indian spinners. If you take players who have succeeded in playing spin in Asia, their strength hasn’t been the sweep. It was common sense for those were practical men. Brian Lara played the 2001 series in Sri Lanka when Murali was at his peak. He gave everyone a lesson on how to counter spin. His strengths were trusting his defence and using his feet. Depending on where the ball pitched, Lara would decide how he would counter the ball. There were not many backfoot scoring shots, unless the ball was short and there to be pulled. Mostly it was a case of tight defence and when there was a scoring opportunity to use the feet and find the gap. Yes, there was the sweep as well. But it didn’t involve much risk. If the ball was pitched outside the leg stump and the sweep would bring him a maximum of four runs, he would sweep. Otherwise, he just played the waiting game. That’s what Test cricket is all about. Lara made 688 runs in six innings in that series. By sweeping even the balls pitched on the stumps, the Aussies are taking too much risk. There’s protection on the boundary and the most you would get by sweeping is two runs. The risk is not worth it. Then, if you miss, on tracks where there’s little bounce, you are a sitting duck being a prime lbw suspect. Just look at how many batters were dismissed lbw in the series. Not just Lara, other batters like Stephen Fleming, Andy Flower, Matthew Hayden and Joe Root have been successful in tackling spin in the sub-continent. Hayden was a big sweeper but others if you take them had strengths like patience, solid defence and use of the feet to their advantage. In the Australian side, everyone is sweeping. The moment Usman Khawaja had some success playing the sweep in Delhi, the others too had made up their minds that they are going to live by the sweep forgetting that the chances of them perishing by a high-risk stroke were heavy. Mind you nobody ended up top edging and getting caught trying to play the sweep. All the batters completely missed the sweep and were either bowled or given out leg before wicket. They need to sort their game before Indore. Published on By Losing the first match of the Women’s T20 World Cup to Sri Lanka put the hosts on a slippery slope from which they had to claw their way back. On a cool Tuesday night, returning to Newlands for the first time since that defeat, they restricted Bangladesh to 113 for 6 despite a nervy performance in the field and then reached their target with 13 balls to spare.

I’m in a fortunate position so it’s nothing that stresses me out too much. “There was really clear messaging, they communicated with me and it’s a clear path forward with that message, it’s chin up, walk tall and try and improve.

I just try and give as much as I can and help where I can.” Selector Tony Dodemaide said Agar had “worked his backside off” in India but they didn’t feel he posed as much of a threat to India’s batters as Kuhnemann. Agar, who will return to India in Australia’s ODI team for a series in March, said a lack of red-ball games in recent years didn’t help his cause. “It’s been pretty hard for me recently to be fair, I’ve played like three red-ball games in three years,” he told Channel 10 in Perth. “It’s hard to expect that part of my game to be in tip-top, perfect shape. But I’ll always compete as hard as I can and give as much as I can to a team. It’s just whether I get that chance, I’ll play as well as I can and see what happens.” Ashton Agar in Nagpur. Photo by INDRANIL MUKHERJEE / AFP) Source: AFP The West Australian was confident he had the resilience to keep pushing his national cause. “I do feel like I am pretty resilient and try and front up every day with a smile on my face and be part of a team,” Agar said. “Going go India is really hard, individually it‘s hard and it’s bloody hard as a team especially against that team at the moment, they are unbelievable. “I think controlling my attitude had been a strength of mine over the last few years and I am certainly enjoying my cricket a lot more because of that.

It may signal the crumbling of an era which never quite managed to attain greatness. David Warner may have played his last Test. Credit: Getty Images Because as this ageing side peer at a pinnacle they can now never reach, winning a Test series in India after collapsing in the first two Tests, they are standing on the edge of a precipice. David Warner may have already tumbled over the edge, subbed out of the second Test with concussion and sent home with a hair line fracture after being struck on the elbow. The greatest all-format player Australia has produced, at aged 36 his Test performances have clearly dropped off, save for an epic double century during the Boxing Day Test . There is now considerable doubt whether he will be chosen for the Ashes tour later this year given his last tour in 2019 was made a misery by Stuart Broad. Warner scored 95 runs at 9.5 in the five Tests with eight single figure scores, including three successive ducks. Warner was beaten home by Josh Hazlewood, 32, who is carrying an Achilles problem. He has played just four Tests during the past two seasons because of side strains. India’s conveyor belt of both batting and bowling talent appears to be never-ending, and under home conditions they have proven to be nearly unbeatable. While Australia’s future bowling stocks look encouraging, the next generation of batsmen do not. Try picking a side for the 2027 tour of India without Warner, Usman Khawaja, 36, and Steve Smith, 33. From the team currently in India, Marnus Labuschagne, 28, Travis Head, 29, and Cameron Green, 23, should become the backbone of Australia’s batting. Peter Handscomb, 31, may yet have a career revival. In 18 Tests he averages 39 and appears one of the few batsmen with a simple and clear-headed method against India’s deceptive spinners. At 36 Usman Khawaja is in the twilight of his career. Credit: Getty Images Matthew Renshaw, 26, once gave the impression that he would also be a big part of Australia’s future. Called into the Test squad at the age of 20, Renshaw scored 184 in his fourth Test, against Pakistan at the SCG, opening the batting. Six of his first ten scores were 30 or better, including a pair of 60s on the 2017 tour of India. But whatever he learnt on that tour hasn’t translated this time around with scores of 0 and 2 in the first Test before being dropped, then brought back as a concussion sub for Warner, scoring just 2. Renshaw has shown he can bat anywhere, so he could return as an opening batsman in the post Warner/Khawaja world if he can straighten his game out. In 14 Tests he has averaged 29. Marcus Harris, 30, has dominated for Victoria and been flirting with the Test side since his debut in 2018. In 14 Tests he averages 25 without a century. Marnus Labuschagne is a vital part of Australia’s future Credit: Getty Images Cameron Bancroft, 30, is currently the leading run scorer in the Sheffield Shield and may earn another chance. The West Australian made his Test debut in 2017 and in ten Tests has averaged 26 without a century. Australia A tours have been a reliable window to the selectors’ thinking. In 2018, the most productive players on Australia’s most recent A tour to India were Khawaja, Labuschagne, Head and Handscomb. South Australian opening batsman Henry Hunt, 26, was part of the A tour to Sri Lanka in June last year. After failing in the first unofficial Test, Hunt and wicket-keeper Jimmy Peirson made centuries in the second game to chase down 370 for victory. Unfortunately, Hunt has struggled for consistency over four seasons, averaging less than 36 in first class cricket across 35 matches. He made 1 and 0 in the Shield match against Victoria that began on Monday. Like the batting without Smith and Warner, Australia will be unable to adequately replace most of the imposing quartet of Pat Cummins, Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon over the next few years. However, the bowling looks more promising than the batting with “Wild Thing” Lance Armstrong and spinners Todd Murphy, injured leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha from NSW and Matt Kuhnemann.

The 26-year-old Indian opener and former teenage prodigy – who has risen to global superstar status since making her T20 international debut for India as a 16-year-old back in 2013, fetched the highest fee at the maiden WPL auction a fortnight ago. Smriti Mandhana of India prior to the T20 International series between India and Australia at Brabourne Stadium on December 17, 2022 in Mumbai, India. (Photo: Pankaj Nangia / Getty Images) Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) splurged 34-million Indian rupees (R7.3-million) to secure the services of the left-handed batter. This took a huge chunk of RCB’s R26-million purse for the auction. “WPL is going to be a game-changer for women’s cricket in India. It will especially provide a boost of confidence for women cricketers playing on domestic teams, and give them the validation that they truly deserve,” Mandhana told GQ India in December 2022. At the time, the RCB captain couldn’t have imagined she’d be the crown jewel of the inaugural season and something of a poster girl for the competition. Visit Daily Maverick’s home page for more news, analysis and investigations Those that have eagerly followed her career over the years will tell you that she was worth every cent the franchise spent on her ahead of the competition’s kick-off on 4 March – a couple of weeks after the ongoing Women’s T20 World Cup concludes. Mandhana – who serves as vice-captain in the Indian team – is well-respected in her home country, as well as globally. As evidence, she has won the ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year gong twice. The only other player that has received the accolade more than once is Australian legend Ellyse Perry – with three. With time very much on her side and the Indian batter always improving on her craft – she is likely to match and even usurp Perry’s haul. Mandhana also holds the record for the fastest 50 by an Indian woman in T20 internationals. The electric opener, who possesses an array of shots and the accuracy of a sniper, raced to a record half-century in just 23 balls at last year’s Commonwealth Games semifinal win over England. That innings beat her own record of a 24-ball half-ton against New Zealand in 2019. Impressively, she is also third on the list. Playing against England in Mumbai (her city of birth) she reached the 50-run milestone from 25 balls. Mandhana picked up a bat when it was not as socially acceptable as it is now for young girls and women to play cricket. Especially in a conservative, though cricket-crazy country such as India. The sport was popular in her family, with her father and older brother playing it at district level. The latter was particularly influential on the Indian star. The young Mandhana would follow her brother when he went to play for the local team. By this time, the family had left Mumbai and moved to the city of Sangli. This is where the star batter’s powers truly came to the fore – with her father also a great influence in helping her realise the dream of playing cricket as a career – though at the time the trajectory of women’s cricket was far from what it is now. “I got quite lucky with my family. It was their dream for me to become a cricketer. A few relatives did express concern about my decision to play the sport professionally, but that never deterred me. I always knew what I wanted to be and overall, I’ve always had people’s support,” Mandhana said in a recent interview with Vogue India . By the age of nine the opener was part of the Maharashtra state’s under-15 side. Her innate talent was visible for all to see. Hence, she was promoted to the under-19 side – at the wee age of 11.

To demonstrate that she was born to be a star, Mandhana top-scored with 39 runs as her country beat Bangladesh by 10. She hasn’t looked back since. In spite of all her individual achievements, as well as being one of most sought-after T20 players in domestic leagues around the world, Mandhana and India are yet to win a World Cup. With the Indians pitted against the irrepressible Australia in the semifinals of the T20 international showpiece, it is highly possible the wait may be a bit longer for the left-handed batter and her compatriots. The Australians are the record T20 champions and vanquished India to clinch their fifth world title in the shortest international format, and their third in a row – in 202o. Mandhana will be crucial if the Indians are to upset the defending champions and book a second consecutive appearance in the World Cup final when the two sides clash at Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town tomorrow. She warmed up perfectly for a starring role in that crunch tie – notching up her highest T20 international total (87) to help India book their spot in the last four with a five-run win over Ireland. The haul took her to second on the run-scorers list in the current World Cup – with a return of 149 from the three matches she has played. England’s Nat Sciver-Brunt leads the pack on 176 runs, though she has played one more match than Mandhana. Against Australia, India will need all their players to be at their optimum. They will pin their hopes on Mandhana to once again spearhead the charge – as she has consistently done over the past 10 years.

Living with his family in Wellington, New Zealand - where he returns this week to lead England in their second Test match against the Blackcaps - Stokes led his side Plimmerton on an unlikely cup run. They were due to come up against a side against whom they were 'on a hiding to nothing', but Stokes was unavailable due to suffering a broken arm prior to the match. His mother was adamant he would not be playing in the fixture, but dad Ged had other ideas. Ben Stokes agrees to leave IPL early to lead England into Ireland Test before Ashes England icon James Anderson named best bowler in the world for SIXTH time in seven years A renowned rugby league player, who moved to England to coach Cumbrian sides Workington and Whitehaven in later life, no-nonsense Ged had previously had part of his left middle finger amputated as he saw it as preferable to missing matches. It's the reasoning behind Stokes' trademark celebration - and may go some way to explaining what happened all those years ago back in New Zealand. Stokes had been due to attend the match as a spectator only, but arrived at school with his cricket kit and with no cast on his arm. Dad Ged had cut it off. The Durham all-rounder went on to score a century, albeit in a losing effort to the eventual national champions.

Ben would hit them out of the school ground, aged 10, straight. He could absolutely smash it. \"We kept winning. We won and won and won, and Ben was consistently making big scores. We were calling ourselves the juggernaut. We got through to play Palmerston North, a much bigger school in a massive cricket area. We were on a hiding to nothing, 100-1 and drifting. \"I was asking if he could play and he said he had another three weeks in plaster. I rang his mum, pretending to talk about something else. We got on to cricket and she said no. The day before the game, I was talking to him and said he might as well come to watch. \"The next day, he walked up the school driveway, pulling his cricket bag with no cast on his arm. I said 'what's going on?' He said 'Dad got out the scissors and cut it off this morning'.\" Ged sadly died in December 2020 after a brave battle with brain cancer, aged 65. Stokes with dad Ged in April 2017 Last year, Stokes admitted that not being able to see his dad before his death due to IPL commitments made him 'hate cricket'. “The last time I saw Dad was leaving New Zealand to go to the Indian Premier League – that was dictated by cricket,\" he said. \"He wanted me to go, he really loved me playing for Rajasthan Royals and the people there. But it made me hate cricket, I thought it was the reason I didn’t see my dad before he died. I should have opened up about it sooner. \"I just thought ‘cricket, cricket, cricket’. It’s not a regret… but I’d do things differently… So I had a real thing with cricket at the time I took a break. I was really angry at the sport because it was dictating when I could see my dad.” Read More Australian cricket great Matthew Hayden mocks debacle vs India as photo emerges Read More James Anderson and Stuart Broad \"setting the standard\" for 'Bazball' says Ben Stokes Read More Ben Stokes admits England are facing an \"absolute selection nightmare\" ahead of the Ashes Read More Michael Atherton pinpoints England's \"real problem\" ahead of the Ashes Read More Alastair Cook identifies England's \"real big change\" that doesn't \"take the highlights\"","pubDate":"2023-02-22 18:14:12","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29287293.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Ben-Stokes-aged-15-with-his-parents.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Upper Great Southern Cricket Association top four to be decided in final round of fixtures","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/narrogin-observer/upper-great-southern-cricket-association-top-four-to-be-decided-in-final-round-of-fixtures-c-9821021","keywords":null,"creator":["Calvin Sims"],"video_url":null,"description":"A sparkling century by Jack Blechynden set up Pingelly-Noonebin’s commanding win.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-02-22 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-9821021/44f1f3a228eea4b805bb9915eb58a6bc2003ec47-16x9-x122y218w1716h965.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Thrilling super over decides annual T20 Slam match in Upper Great Southern Cricket Association","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/narrogin-observer/thrilling-super-over-decides-annual-t20-slam-match-in-upper-great-southern-cricket-association--c-9820908","keywords":null,"creator":["Cameron Newbold"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Old Dogs won the first two editions of the T20 showcase but the Young Guns have squared the ledger after wins in 2022 and now 2023.","content":null,"pubDate":"2023-02-22 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-9820908/76922d9bbff7eb56cdcd36f7a927765afa1e1b9b-16x9-x0y270w5184h2916.jpg","source_id":"thewest","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"}]}
