Flintoff, 45, spent chunks of last summer around England teams, watching the Ashes incognito following the horror crash while filming an episode of Top Gear 11 months ago that left him with facial scarring, and working with the national Under-19 team and full limited-overs sides. On Thursday he was in attendance at Loughborough as a 21-strong group prepares for the three-week trip starting on November 16. He is sharing mentoring duties on the tour with fellow Ashes 2009 winner Graeme Swann. ‘He’s got a huge passion for helping people. He is going through a bit of a journey himself and wants to give back to the game,’ said the ECB’s performance director Mo Bobat. ‘He has a lot to offer, and there is a lot of energy and enthusiasm from him, and we have a desire to get him involved. It’s not often you get players of his calibre and experience wanting to get involved as proactively as he does. You have to really take that seriously. Andrew Flintoff will be part of England Lions' coaching setup next month in the UAE Flintoff made his return to cricket this summer as an unpaid mentor for the England senior side ‘I started speaking to him in the summer, saying I’d love you to come on this camp, and he said he’d love to. ‘At the moment, we have agreed that he will come for the full camp, but he’s in demand and we will see. He also has a few medical things he is still working through which we have to be respectful of.’ Joining former England captain Flintoff in Abu Dhabi will be a collection of England Test players upping their fitness levels ahead of January’s tour of India including Jimmy Anderson, Ben Foakes and Ollie Robinson, with Ollie Pope and Jack Leach also there to stop up their comebacks from injury. England Test coach Brendon McCullum will also be on hand for a few days to work with both established players and others coming through the ECB pathway system. Meanwhile, it is understood that Bobat will branch into football when he leaves English cricket early next year. Bobat, who has spent 12 years with the ECB, is taking over as director of cricket at Virat Kohli’s Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore but will have time to work in other ventures outside the IPL season of March-May.

New Zealand ended their run of four straight defeats with a five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka this morning. The win all but cements the Black Caps a spot in fourth which would mean a semifinal against hosts India in Wankhede next Wednesday. A semifinal clash with India would be a rematch of the 2019 tournament when the Black Caps stunned Virat Kohli’s side after they topped the points table. In the other semifinal, Australia and South Africa are set to meet for the third time in the semifinal stage with Australia winning in 1999 and 2007. What Pakistan must do to reach semifinals, and deny the Black Caps The toss will be vital when Pakistan and England square off at Eden Gardens tomorrow night - as Pakistan must bat first to have any chance of making the semifinals. If Jos Buttler wins the toss and thinks it’s a bat-first wicket, which India did when beating South Africa earlier this week, then all hope is lost for Pakistan. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Pakistan need to win by at least 287 runs to have a better Net Run Rate than New Zealand . Pakistan’s largest-ever ODI win in terms of runs is 255 (v Ireland in 2016) and their biggest over England is 165 runs (in 2005) If bowling first, the task becomes nearly impossible as they’d need to dismiss England for 50 runs and chase the target in two overs or 100 runs in three overs. What Afghanistan must do to reach semifinals The equation for Afghanistan when they face South Africa tonight is bat first and win by at least 438 runs. They’d need to break the record for the largest ODI victory in terms of runs, currently held by India after their 317-run drubbing over Sri Lanka in January. Even if Afghanistan equaled the highest ODI team total ( 498 by England v Netherlands in 2022) and bowled South Africa for their lowest ever ( 69 in 1993) - they’d still fall nine runs short.

The fifth round of Pakistan Cup 2023-24, played at four venues across Rawalpindi, AJK and Abbottabad had Peshawar, Karachi Whites, Multan and FATA emerge on top in their respective games. The only game of the round not affected by bad weather saw FATA defeat Lahore Whites by six wickets in a low-scoring match. The other three matches were impacted by weather and bad light, and results were produced on the DLS method. Karachi Whites scored a mammoth total of 364-7 in the allotted 45 overs after they were invited to bat first by Rawalpindi at Shoaib Akhtar Cricket Stadium. Saim Ayub was the star of the show, smashing 179 from 125, including 15 fours and 11 sixes. This is the highest individual score of this edition of the competition so far. Asad Shafiq produced a half-century (57, 43b, 6x4s, 2x6s) as well. All seven of the Rawalpindi bowlers returned with a wicket each. In return, Rawalpindi only managed 169-5 in 27 overs before rain interfered. Abdul Faseeh (54, 45b, 9x4s, 1×6) and Umar Amin (44, 27b, 5x4s, 2x6s) were the major contributors with the bat. Left-arm spinner Noman Ali got three wickets while Asad Shafiq returned with two scalps as well. Karachi Whites were awarded a 72-run victory, as per DLS. In another fifth-round Pakistan Cup fixture, Peshawar, after being put into bat first, scored 264 all out in 45 overs against Faisalabad at Pindi Cricket Stadium. Captain Sahibzada Farhan (66, 106b, 9x4s) and Kamran Ghulam (63, 46b, 7x4s, 2x6s) were the top scorers for the side. Right-arm pacer Arshad Iqbal registered a five-wicket haul. Faheem Ashraf and Ali Shan, who were involved in a collision, went off the field after suspected concussion. Mohammad Huraira was named Faheem’s replacement, while Irfan Khan Niazi replaced Ali Shan. In return, Faisalabad could only get to 142-7 in 27.3 overs before no further play was possible due to bad light. Asif Ali (30, 27b, 2x4s, 1×6) and Mohammad Saleem (27, 41b) were the only notable batters for the side. Pacers Mohammad Ilyas, Abbas Afridi and left-arm spinner Azam Khan claimed two wickets each. Peshawar were awarded a 68-run victory, as per DLS. In the rain-impacted Pakistan Cup fixture, Lahore Blues got to 257-7 in the stipulated 40 overs after Multan won the toss and elected to bowl first at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. Hussain Talat (70, 56b, 9x4s) and Rizwan Hussain (62, 79b, 9x4s) were the top run-getters for the team. Tahir Hussain was the pick of the bowlers for Multan, accounting for three wickets. Multan could only bat for 21.2 overs, before weather conditions disallowed further play. They scored 163-4, on the back of Sharjeel Khan’s quick-fire half-century (82, 63b, 8x4s, 5x6s). Sohaib Maqsood also chipped in with 33 off 35 deliveries, including three fours and a six, as Multan were awarded a 37-run win over Lahore Blues as per DLS. Ali Shafiq, Umaid Asif, Hussain Talat and Usman Qadir took a wicket each. FATA’s decision to bowl first worked in their favour as they bowled Lahore Whites out for only 128 in 38.1 overs in their Pakistan Cup clash at Mirpur Cricket Stadium. Ahmed Daniyal was the highest scorer for the side, hitting 32 from 42, including three fours and a six. Fahad Munir added 27 off 44, including three boundaries, to the total. Asif Afridi and Khushdil Shah took three wickets each and Shahid Aziz also had two to his name. In turn, FATA scored 130-4 in 22.1 overs. Mohammad Farooq (40, 30b, 6x4s), Mohammad Sarwar Afridi (34 not out, 28b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Samiullah Jnr (33, 58b, 3x4s) were the major contributors with the bat. Mohammad Rameez Jnr grabbed two wickets while Asadullah and Aamer Jamal returned with a wicket each.

Sky have exclusive rights to all ICC events until 2031, but have agreed to sub-licence the final to Channel 5. The surprise move follows a similar arrangement with Channel 4 in 2019 when England won the World Cup, although that followed last-minute negotiations in the build-up to the final after Eoin Morgan ’s side qualified, whereas this deal was agreed as part of the highlights package before the tournament started. England have already been eliminated following a shocking defence of the trophy, but Channel 5 are hopeful of securing a good audience, particularly if India reach the final.

England were grateful Stokes did not bring forward an upcoming knee operation once the semi-finals were out of reach – a notion he rejected out of hand with the mantra “never leave early, never take the easy way out, never leave your team-mates hanging” – but Saturday’s engagement with Pakistan will surely be his last stand. With his primary focus on his role as Test captain, a T20 World Cup next summer and a period of post-surgery rehabilitation coming up, he is already being stretched thin.

The Pirates, who forecast a slow start due to unavailability in the XI, have had a couple of tough losses to start the season, but fired with the bat at KM Reedy Reserve. The visitors won with 18 balls to spare, with five of the top six batters reaching at least 40 as partnership batting was the successful recipe against a well-regarded HSD lineup. Recruit Kyle Gwynne led the way with a patient 57 off 176; fellow opener Ammar Bajwa also strong with his 43, absorbing pressure and willing to see off disciplined spells. At number three, Amal Athulathmudali also spent valuable time at the crease, as did Jaime Brohier, who finished off the chase. Meanwhile, entering the day having already taken a sizeable chunk out of Keysborough’s target of 146, Dandy West cruised to first innings victory before pressing on to an outright. After setting the tone late on day one, Shaun Weir came out firing again on day two, eventually dismissed for an entertaining 62, his second half century of the season. Nuwan Kulasekara got a-run-a-ball 71 and youngster Bailey Howarth spent valuable time in the middle to give the Bulls a 73-run lead. Noman Khan then did early damage with the ball as Kulasekara and spinners Malinga Bandara and Shaun Weir also chipped in to keep the Knights to 76, Dandy West’s second innings effectively a formality to get the four required runs for outright victory. At Casey Fields, the quicks did the damage for Cranbourne, who set Parkfield a target of 275. Jakeb Thomas, Marty Kelly and Tim Fathers collectively bowled 31.4 of the 64.4 overs and picked up eight wickets, each at an economy rate well under two. Nick Cramer and Suliman Iqbal saw off the new ball for the Bandits before Kelly’s two wickets. After some excellent lower-order hitting last week, Thomas was rewarded for his discipline with three strikes in his second spell. Partnership bowling put the pressure on Parkfield as batters got tied down and there was no release at the other end. Fathers, so often the unrewarded bowler running in with the breeze in his face or playing a role to allow teammates to thrive, bowled 11 tireless overs and claimed 3/12. At Sweeney Reserve, Lyndale was too good for Narre Warren.","pubDate":"2023-11-09 18:01:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"berwicknews_starcommunity","source_priority":4220755,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a3090432d98e1f7d6d1021916850bff6","title":"Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff to continue coaching stint after horror Top Gear smash by mentoring England Lions on their training camp in United Arab Emirates","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12731401/Ashes-hero-Andrew-Flintoff-continue-coaching-stint-horror-Gear-smash-mentoring-England-Lions-training-camp-United-Arab-Emirates.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Andrew Flintoff will continue his venture into coaching by mentoring the England Lions players on their training camp in the United Arab Emirates from next week.","content":"Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff to continue coaching stint after horror Top Gear smash by mentoring England Lions on their training camp in United Arab Emirates Andrew Flintoff was involved in a near-fatal crash on Top Gear in December He made his return to the public eye this summer by mentoring the England side He is now set to be part of the England Lions' coaching team next month By Richard Gibson For Mailonline Published: 18:34, 9 November 2023 | Updated: 20:10, 9 November 2023 e-mail 2 View comments Andrew Flintoff will continue his venture into coaching by mentoring the England Lions players on their training camp in the United Arab Emirates from next week. Flintoff, 45, spent chunks of last summer around England teams, watching the Ashes incognito following the horror crash while filming an episode of Top Gear 11 months ago that left him with facial scarring, and working with the national Under-19 team and full limited-overs sides. On Thursday he was in attendance at Loughborough as a 21-strong group prepares for the three-week trip starting on November 16. He is sharing mentoring duties on the tour with fellow Ashes 2009 winner Graeme Swann. ‘He’s got a huge passion for helping people. He is going through a bit of a journey himself and wants to give back to the game,’ said the ECB’s performance director Mo Bobat. ‘He has a lot to offer, and there is a lot of energy and enthusiasm from him, and we have a desire to get him involved. It’s not often you get players of his calibre and experience wanting to get involved as proactively as he does. You have to really take that seriously. Andrew Flintoff will be part of England Lions' coaching setup next month in the UAE Flintoff made his return to cricket this summer as an unpaid mentor for the England senior side ‘I started speaking to him in the summer, saying I’d love you to come on this camp, and he said he’d love to. ‘At the moment, we have agreed that he will come for the full camp, but he’s in demand and we will see. He also has a few medical things he is still working through which we have to be respectful of.’ Joining former England captain Flintoff in Abu Dhabi will be a collection of England Test players upping their fitness levels ahead of January’s tour of India including Jimmy Anderson, Ben Foakes and Ollie Robinson, with Ollie Pope and Jack Leach also there to stop up their comebacks from injury. England Test coach Brendon McCullum will also be on hand for a few days to work with both established players and others coming through the ECB pathway system. Meanwhile, it is understood that Bobat will branch into football when he leaves English cricket early next year. Bobat, who has spent 12 years with the ECB, is taking over as director of cricket at Virat Kohli’s Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore but will have time to work in other ventures outside the IPL season of March-May.

New Zealand ended their run of four straight defeats with a five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka this morning. The win all but cements the Black Caps a spot in fourth which would mean a semifinal against hosts India in Wankhede next Wednesday. A semifinal clash with India would be a rematch of the 2019 tournament when the Black Caps stunned Virat Kohli’s side after they topped the points table. In the other semifinal, Australia and South Africa are set to meet for the third time in the semifinal stage with Australia winning in 1999 and 2007. What Pakistan must do to reach semifinals, and deny the Black Caps The toss will be vital when Pakistan and England square off at Eden Gardens tomorrow night - as Pakistan must bat first to have any chance of making the semifinals. If Jos Buttler wins the toss and thinks it’s a bat-first wicket, which India did when beating South Africa earlier this week, then all hope is lost for Pakistan. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Pakistan need to win by at least 287 runs to have a better Net Run Rate than New Zealand . Pakistan’s largest-ever ODI win in terms of runs is 255 (v Ireland in 2016) and their biggest over England is 165 runs (in 2005) If bowling first, the task becomes nearly impossible as they’d need to dismiss England for 50 runs and chase the target in two overs or 100 runs in three overs. What Afghanistan must do to reach semifinals The equation for Afghanistan when they face South Africa tonight is bat first and win by at least 438 runs. They’d need to break the record for the largest ODI victory in terms of runs, currently held by India after their 317-run drubbing over Sri Lanka in January. Even if Afghanistan equaled the highest ODI team total ( 498 by England v Netherlands in 2022) and bowled South Africa for their lowest ever ( 69 in 1993) - they’d still fall nine runs short.

The fifth round of Pakistan Cup 2023-24, played at four venues across Rawalpindi, AJK and Abbottabad had Peshawar, Karachi Whites, Multan and FATA emerge on top in their respective games. The only game of the round not affected by bad weather saw FATA defeat Lahore Whites by six wickets in a low-scoring match. The other three matches were impacted by weather and bad light, and results were produced on the DLS method. Karachi Whites scored a mammoth total of 364-7 in the allotted 45 overs after they were invited to bat first by Rawalpindi at Shoaib Akhtar Cricket Stadium. Saim Ayub was the star of the show, smashing 179 from 125, including 15 fours and 11 sixes. This is the highest individual score of this edition of the competition so far. Asad Shafiq produced a half-century (57, 43b, 6x4s, 2x6s) as well. All seven of the Rawalpindi bowlers returned with a wicket each. In return, Rawalpindi only managed 169-5 in 27 overs before rain interfered. Abdul Faseeh (54, 45b, 9x4s, 1×6) and Umar Amin (44, 27b, 5x4s, 2x6s) were the major contributors with the bat. Left-arm spinner Noman Ali got three wickets while Asad Shafiq returned with two scalps as well. Karachi Whites were awarded a 72-run victory, as per DLS. In another fifth-round Pakistan Cup fixture, Peshawar, after being put into bat first, scored 264 all out in 45 overs against Faisalabad at Pindi Cricket Stadium. Captain Sahibzada Farhan (66, 106b, 9x4s) and Kamran Ghulam (63, 46b, 7x4s, 2x6s) were the top scorers for the side. Right-arm pacer Arshad Iqbal registered a five-wicket haul. Faheem Ashraf and Ali Shan, who were involved in a collision, went off the field after suspected concussion. Mohammad Huraira was named Faheem’s replacement, while Irfan Khan Niazi replaced Ali Shan. In return, Faisalabad could only get to 142-7 in 27.3 overs before no further play was possible due to bad light. Asif Ali (30, 27b, 2x4s, 1×6) and Mohammad Saleem (27, 41b) were the only notable batters for the side. Pacers Mohammad Ilyas, Abbas Afridi and left-arm spinner Azam Khan claimed two wickets each. Peshawar were awarded a 68-run victory, as per DLS. In the rain-impacted Pakistan Cup fixture, Lahore Blues got to 257-7 in the stipulated 40 overs after Multan won the toss and elected to bowl first at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. Hussain Talat (70, 56b, 9x4s) and Rizwan Hussain (62, 79b, 9x4s) were the top run-getters for the team. Tahir Hussain was the pick of the bowlers for Multan, accounting for three wickets. Multan could only bat for 21.2 overs, before weather conditions disallowed further play. They scored 163-4, on the back of Sharjeel Khan’s quick-fire half-century (82, 63b, 8x4s, 5x6s). Sohaib Maqsood also chipped in with 33 off 35 deliveries, including three fours and a six, as Multan were awarded a 37-run win over Lahore Blues as per DLS. Ali Shafiq, Umaid Asif, Hussain Talat and Usman Qadir took a wicket each. FATA’s decision to bowl first worked in their favour as they bowled Lahore Whites out for only 128 in 38.1 overs in their Pakistan Cup clash at Mirpur Cricket Stadium. Ahmed Daniyal was the highest scorer for the side, hitting 32 from 42, including three fours and a six. Fahad Munir added 27 off 44, including three boundaries, to the total. Asif Afridi and Khushdil Shah took three wickets each and Shahid Aziz also had two to his name. In turn, FATA scored 130-4 in 22.1 overs. Mohammad Farooq (40, 30b, 6x4s), Mohammad Sarwar Afridi (34 not out, 28b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Samiullah Jnr (33, 58b, 3x4s) were the major contributors with the bat. Mohammad Rameez Jnr grabbed two wickets while Asadullah and Aamer Jamal returned with a wicket each.

The Pirates, who forecast a slow start due to unavailability in the XI, have had a couple of tough losses to start the season, but fired with the bat at KM Reedy Reserve. The visitors won with 18 balls to spare, with five of the top six batters reaching at least 40 as partnership batting was the successful recipe against a well-regarded HSD lineup. Recruit Kyle Gwynne led the way with a patient 57 off 176; fellow opener Ammar Bajwa also strong with his 43, absorbing pressure and willing to see off disciplined spells. At number three, Amal Athulathmudali also spent valuable time at the crease, as did Jaime Brohier, who finished off the chase. Meanwhile, entering the day having already taken a sizeable chunk out of Keysborough’s target of 146, Dandy West cruised to first innings victory before pressing on to an outright. After setting the tone late on day one, Shaun Weir came out firing again on day two, eventually dismissed for an entertaining 62, his second half century of the season. Nuwan Kulasekara got a-run-a-ball 71 and youngster Bailey Howarth spent valuable time in the middle to give the Bulls a 73-run lead. Noman Khan then did early damage with the ball as Kulasekara and spinners Malinga Bandara and Shaun Weir also chipped in to keep the Knights to 76, Dandy West’s second innings effectively a formality to get the four required runs for outright victory. At Casey Fields, the quicks did the damage for Cranbourne, who set Parkfield a target of 275. Jakeb Thomas, Marty Kelly and Tim Fathers collectively bowled 31.4 of the 64.4 overs and picked up eight wickets, each at an economy rate well under two. Nick Cramer and Suliman Iqbal saw off the new ball for the Bandits before Kelly’s two wickets. After some excellent lower-order hitting last week, Thomas was rewarded for his discipline with three strikes in his second spell. Partnership bowling put the pressure on Parkfield as batters got tied down and there was no release at the other end. Fathers, so often the unrewarded bowler running in with the breeze in his face or playing a role to allow teammates to thrive, bowled 11 tireless overs and claimed 3/12. At Sweeney Reserve, Lyndale was too good for Narre Warren.","pubDate":"2023-11-09 18:01:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"berwicknews_starcommunity","source_priority":4220755,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"a3090432d98e1f7d6d1021916850bff6","title":"Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff to continue coaching stint after horror Top Gear smash by mentoring England Lions on their training camp in United Arab Emirates","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12731401/Ashes-hero-Andrew-Flintoff-continue-coaching-stint-horror-Gear-smash-mentoring-England-Lions-training-camp-United-Arab-Emirates.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Andrew Flintoff will continue his venture into coaching by mentoring the England Lions players on their training camp in the United Arab Emirates from next week.","content":"Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff to continue coaching stint after horror Top Gear smash by mentoring England Lions on their training camp in United Arab Emirates Andrew Flintoff was involved in a near-fatal crash on Top Gear in December He made his return to the public eye this summer by mentoring the England side He is now set to be part of the England Lions' coaching team next month By Richard Gibson For Mailonline Published: 18:34, 9 November 2023 | Updated: 20:10, 9 November 2023 e-mail 2 View comments Andrew Flintoff will continue his venture into coaching by mentoring the England Lions players on their training camp in the United Arab Emirates from next week. Flintoff, 45, spent chunks of last summer around England teams, watching the Ashes incognito following the horror crash while filming an episode of Top Gear 11 months ago that left him with facial scarring, and working with the national Under-19 team and full limited-overs sides. On Thursday he was in attendance at Loughborough as a 21-strong group prepares for the three-week trip starting on November 16. He is sharing mentoring duties on the tour with fellow Ashes 2009 winner Graeme Swann. ‘He’s got a huge passion for helping people. He is going through a bit of a journey himself and wants to give back to the game,’ said the ECB’s performance director Mo Bobat. ‘He has a lot to offer, and there is a lot of energy and enthusiasm from him, and we have a desire to get him involved. It’s not often you get players of his calibre and experience wanting to get involved as proactively as he does. You have to really take that seriously. Andrew Flintoff will be part of England Lions' coaching setup next month in the UAE Flintoff made his return to cricket this summer as an unpaid mentor for the England senior side ‘I started speaking to him in the summer, saying I’d love you to come on this camp, and he said he’d love to. ‘At the moment, we have agreed that he will come for the full camp, but he’s in demand and we will see. He also has a few medical things he is still working through which we have to be respectful of.’ Joining former England captain Flintoff in Abu Dhabi will be a collection of England Test players upping their fitness levels ahead of January’s tour of India including Jimmy Anderson, Ben Foakes and Ollie Robinson, with Ollie Pope and Jack Leach also there to stop up their comebacks from injury. England Test coach Brendon McCullum will also be on hand for a few days to work with both established players and others coming through the ECB pathway system. Meanwhile, it is understood that Bobat will branch into football when he leaves English cricket early next year. Bobat, who has spent 12 years with the ECB, is taking over as director of cricket at Virat Kohli’s Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore but will have time to work in other ventures outside the IPL season of March-May.

New Zealand ended their run of four straight defeats with a five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka this morning. The win all but cements the Black Caps a spot in fourth which would mean a semifinal against hosts India in Wankhede next Wednesday. A semifinal clash with India would be a rematch of the 2019 tournament when the Black Caps stunned Virat Kohli’s side after they topped the points table. In the other semifinal, Australia and South Africa are set to meet for the third time in the semifinal stage with Australia winning in 1999 and 2007. What Pakistan must do to reach semifinals, and deny the Black Caps The toss will be vital when Pakistan and England square off at Eden Gardens tomorrow night - as Pakistan must bat first to have any chance of making the semifinals. If Jos Buttler wins the toss and thinks it’s a bat-first wicket, which India did when beating South Africa earlier this week, then all hope is lost for Pakistan. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Pakistan need to win by at least 287 runs to have a better Net Run Rate than New Zealand . Pakistan’s largest-ever ODI win in terms of runs is 255 (v Ireland in 2016) and their biggest over England is 165 runs (in 2005) If bowling first, the task becomes nearly impossible as they’d need to dismiss England for 50 runs and chase the target in two overs or 100 runs in three overs. What Afghanistan must do to reach semifinals The equation for Afghanistan when they face South Africa tonight is bat first and win by at least 438 runs. They’d need to break the record for the largest ODI victory in terms of runs, currently held by India after their 317-run drubbing over Sri Lanka in January. Even if Afghanistan equaled the highest ODI team total ( 498 by England v Netherlands in 2022) and bowled South Africa for their lowest ever ( 69 in 1993) - they’d still fall nine runs short.

The fifth round of Pakistan Cup 2023-24, played at four venues across Rawalpindi, AJK and Abbottabad had Peshawar, Karachi Whites, Multan and FATA emerge on top in their respective games. The only game of the round not affected by bad weather saw FATA defeat Lahore Whites by six wickets in a low-scoring match. The other three matches were impacted by weather and bad light, and results were produced on the DLS method. Karachi Whites scored a mammoth total of 364-7 in the allotted 45 overs after they were invited to bat first by Rawalpindi at Shoaib Akhtar Cricket Stadium. Saim Ayub was the star of the show, smashing 179 from 125, including 15 fours and 11 sixes. This is the highest individual score of this edition of the competition so far. Asad Shafiq produced a half-century (57, 43b, 6x4s, 2x6s) as well. All seven of the Rawalpindi bowlers returned with a wicket each. In return, Rawalpindi only managed 169-5 in 27 overs before rain interfered. Abdul Faseeh (54, 45b, 9x4s, 1×6) and Umar Amin (44, 27b, 5x4s, 2x6s) were the major contributors with the bat. Left-arm spinner Noman Ali got three wickets while Asad Shafiq returned with two scalps as well. Karachi Whites were awarded a 72-run victory, as per DLS. In another fifth-round Pakistan Cup fixture, Peshawar, after being put into bat first, scored 264 all out in 45 overs against Faisalabad at Pindi Cricket Stadium. Captain Sahibzada Farhan (66, 106b, 9x4s) and Kamran Ghulam (63, 46b, 7x4s, 2x6s) were the top scorers for the side. Right-arm pacer Arshad Iqbal registered a five-wicket haul. Faheem Ashraf and Ali Shan, who were involved in a collision, went off the field after suspected concussion. Mohammad Huraira was named Faheem’s replacement, while Irfan Khan Niazi replaced Ali Shan. In return, Faisalabad could only get to 142-7 in 27.3 overs before no further play was possible due to bad light. Asif Ali (30, 27b, 2x4s, 1×6) and Mohammad Saleem (27, 41b) were the only notable batters for the side. Pacers Mohammad Ilyas, Abbas Afridi and left-arm spinner Azam Khan claimed two wickets each. Peshawar were awarded a 68-run victory, as per DLS. In the rain-impacted Pakistan Cup fixture, Lahore Blues got to 257-7 in the stipulated 40 overs after Multan won the toss and elected to bowl first at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. Hussain Talat (70, 56b, 9x4s) and Rizwan Hussain (62, 79b, 9x4s) were the top run-getters for the team. Tahir Hussain was the pick of the bowlers for Multan, accounting for three wickets. Multan could only bat for 21.2 overs, before weather conditions disallowed further play. They scored 163-4, on the back of Sharjeel Khan’s quick-fire half-century (82, 63b, 8x4s, 5x6s). Sohaib Maqsood also chipped in with 33 off 35 deliveries, including three fours and a six, as Multan were awarded a 37-run win over Lahore Blues as per DLS. Ali Shafiq, Umaid Asif, Hussain Talat and Usman Qadir took a wicket each. FATA’s decision to bowl first worked in their favour as they bowled Lahore Whites out for only 128 in 38.1 overs in their Pakistan Cup clash at Mirpur Cricket Stadium. Ahmed Daniyal was the highest scorer for the side, hitting 32 from 42, including three fours and a six. Fahad Munir added 27 off 44, including three boundaries, to the total. Asif Afridi and Khushdil Shah took three wickets each and Shahid Aziz also had two to his name. In turn, FATA scored 130-4 in 22.1 overs. Mohammad Farooq (40, 30b, 6x4s), Mohammad Sarwar Afridi (34 not out, 28b, 4x4s, 1×6) and Samiullah Jnr (33, 58b, 3x4s) were the major contributors with the bat. Mohammad Rameez Jnr grabbed two wickets while Asadullah and Aamer Jamal returned with a wicket each.

The terrestrial channel have been showing a daily highlights programme throughout the tournament in India , and are also understood to have secured an agreement to share live coverage of the final on Sunday, November 19 with main rights holder Sky Sports. Sky have exclusive rights to all ICC events until 2031, but have agreed to sub-licence the final to Channel 5. The surprise move follows a similar arrangement with Channel 4 in 2019 when England won the World Cup, although that followed last-minute negotiations in the build-up to the final after Eoin Morgan ’s side qualified, whereas this deal was agreed as part of the highlights package before the tournament started. England have already been eliminated following a shocking defence of the trophy, but Channel 5 are hopeful of securing a good audience, particularly if India reach the final.

The Pirates, who forecast a slow start due to unavailability in the XI, have had a couple of tough losses to start the season, but fired with the bat at KM Reedy Reserve. The visitors won with 18 balls to spare, with five of the top six batters reaching at least 40 as partnership batting was the successful recipe against a well-regarded HSD lineup. Recruit Kyle Gwynne led the way with a patient 57 off 176; fellow opener Ammar Bajwa also strong with his 43, absorbing pressure and willing to see off disciplined spells. At number three, Amal Athulathmudali also spent valuable time at the crease, as did Jaime Brohier, who finished off the chase. Meanwhile, entering the day having already taken a sizeable chunk out of Keysborough’s target of 146, Dandy West cruised to first innings victory before pressing on to an outright. After setting the tone late on day one, Shaun Weir came out firing again on day two, eventually dismissed for an entertaining 62, his second half century of the season. Nuwan Kulasekara got a-run-a-ball 71 and youngster Bailey Howarth spent valuable time in the middle to give the Bulls a 73-run lead. Noman Khan then did early damage with the ball as Kulasekara and spinners Malinga Bandara and Shaun Weir also chipped in to keep the Knights to 76, Dandy West’s second innings effectively a formality to get the four required runs for outright victory. At Casey Fields, the quicks did the damage for Cranbourne, who set Parkfield a target of 275. Jakeb Thomas, Marty Kelly and Tim Fathers collectively bowled 31.4 of the 64.4 overs and picked up eight wickets, each at an economy rate well under two. Nick Cramer and Suliman Iqbal saw off the new ball for the Bandits before Kelly’s two wickets. After some excellent lower-order hitting last week, Thomas was rewarded for his discipline with three strikes in his second spell. Partnership bowling put the pressure on Parkfield as batters got tied down and there was no release at the other end. Fathers, so often the unrewarded bowler running in with the breeze in his face or playing a role to allow teammates to thrive, bowled 11 tireless overs and claimed 3/12. At Sweeney Reserve, Lyndale was too good for Narre Warren.","pubDate":"2023-11-09 18:01:05","image_url":null,"source_id":"berwicknews_starcommunity","source_priority":4220755,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
