Starting the day at 61 for 1, Jadeja’s arm balls became a lethal weapon as Australia were bowled out for 113 inside the first session, leaving India with a paltry victory target of 115-run target to go 2-0 up in the series and also retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Any team that wins the previous Border-Gavaskar series needs to draw the next series to retain the trophy. Australia lost nine wickets for only 52 runs and it was not the pitch but the messed up minds that led to their downfall for the second time in the series. At lunch, India were 14 for 1 with out-of-form KL Rahul (1) once again being dismissed cheaply. As many as five Australian batters went for the ugly slog sweep and some tried non-existent reverse sweep off deliveries bowled on either off-middle or leg-middle line. They were either bowled or leg before in the process as the deliveries started keeping low. Ravichandran Ashwin (3/59) also played the supporting act to perfection as eight Australian batters failed to reach double figures save overnight pair of Travis Head (45) and Marnus Labschagne (35), who had briefly counter-attacked last evening with some degree of success. But it all changed in the morning session once Head got an off-break from Ashwin and the edge was picked up by Kona Bharat behind the stumps. It is a cardinal mistake to play a sweep or reverse sweep off straighter ones or sliders if there isn’t enough bounce. The ball that trapped Steve Smith plumb in-front was on leg middle and it was a fair call. Labuschagne, who looked confident until then, went on backfoot to a delivery that was supposed to be met on the front-foot with a big stride. The result was the ball kept low and the batter was castled. Matt Renshaw doesn’t have the technique or wherewithal to guts it out on these Indian dustbowls and he has been a ‘walking wicket’ for the home team. Having replaced a concussed David Warner, Renshaw went for a sweep off Ashwin when the ball kept really low and the shot was not on. The only delivery that was classic left-arm orthodox one was bowled to Peter Handscomb (0), the best batter in the first innings. Jadeja, for a change, tossed it up and drew him forward before it turned away enough to get an outside edge into Virat Kohli’s hands. Pat Cummins’s ugly slog sweep shot was more out of anger and frustration rather than purpose and Matt Kuhnemann, while giving Jadeja his seventh wicket, looked as clueless as possible.

Here they are. ﻿ W﻿hat a session in Delhi - 10 wickets have fallen between the two sides, but India are in the box seat to win the second test and regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy. \"A session we often say the game moves quickly in India, this time the game was on a supersonic jet,\" legendary commentator Harsha Bhogle said. India are 1-14.﻿ I﻿f Australia are any chance to win this Test, they need a bit of luck. And they got some in the second over. Matt Kuhnemann took the new ball and conceded six off the first over. Nathan Lyon ﻿was thrown it down the other end. With his first ball, he picks up the wicket of KL Rahul - who goes back and hits the ball straight into the thigh of Peter Handscomb﻿ at short-leg. It balloons up into the air and Alex Carey completes the simplest of catches. Good start for Australia. M﻿att Kuhnemann as on a hiding to nothing, but he's become the last Australian wicket, bowled by Jadeja, another trying to play a sweep shot. That's seven wickets for Ravi Jadeja. Australia are all out for 113, setting India a target of 115 to win.﻿ On the desk for Fox Sports, Mike Hussey said the Aussie batters panicked during the collapse, and the Indians will be raucous. \"They're going to be demoralised, the Australians. Meanwhile India will be upbeat and excited,\" he said. Alex Carey is the seventh Australian wicket for the morning, and the fourth to be dismissed sweeping. Australia resumed at 1-61 this morning. They've now lost 7-51 in this session. Matthew Hayden in commentary perhaps summed it up best - a \"disaster\". Specifically, he's blasted the four players - Steve Smith, Matthew Renshaw, Pat Cummins and Alex Carey - who were all dismissed playing the sweep shot on a pitch that's not bouncing.﻿ \"I can't believe what I've just witnessed … they're world class players, and they've got everything to win in this session, and everything to lose,\" he said in commentary. \"They did it so well last evening in those few overs, strong scoring rate, good defence, proactive batting, but what we've seen here is a disaster for Australia. \"It's a disaster because they've gone way over the edge in terms of their aggressive play. \"You've got to think on your feet plus you also can read the game. \"You've got about 13 people in that dugout that aren't playing the game, all having their say on it, and what they would have said knowing the trend of this venue is that first session is tricky - it's not like the last session of day two, where the conditions slide on, ball is hard, drier wicket. \"It's a little tacky this morning, so think! And then plan in the middle accordingly as a partnership.\" Nathan Lyon looked more like a ﻿batter this morning that some of his more highly rated colleagues, but he's been undone by Ravi Jadeja as well. He got an inside edge onto his stumps, and Australia are now nine down.﻿ What on earth did the Australians have for breakfast this morning? This first hour has been nothing short of woeful. Head, Smith, Labuschagne and now Renshaw and Handscomb in successive balls. Having been subbed into the match for David Warner, Matthew Renshaw provided all the resistance of a wet paper bag, and was hit on the pads bang in front. He was out, but used up another review to confirm the ball had pitched outside off stump, hit him in line, and would have hit middle stump. \"Ashwin on a rampage here this morning. He's bowled quite beautifully,\" Ravi Shastri said. Renshaw didn't look great in the first Test, and he didn't look great in this innings this morning. Then with the next ball, Peter Handscomb played a really nothing shot to Jadeja, and he succeeded only in edging it straight to Virat Kohli at first slip. AND NOW CUMMINS. The Australian skipper walked to the crease and knowing his side are in dire straits, decides to sweep Jadeja and is clean bowled. Four wickets in 11 balls. A team hat-trick between Ashwin and Jadeja. Nathan Lyon calmly defends Jadeja's hat﻿-trick ball. The Aussies are starting to crumble here - Marnus Labuschagne has been scratchy this morning and he's been bowled by Ravi Jadeja for 35. Jadeja threw in the flatter and quicker one, and Labuschagne - clearly not picking it - went back and pool cued it onto his middle and off stump. \"That's a cleanup job if ever there was one - flat, fast and castling Labuschagne,\" Ravi Shastri said in commentary. Just as it was yesterday, the first hour of play this morning has been tricky for the incoming batters. A hard, new ball, and with the pitch starting to do things, batters have their work cut out for them. The Indians would have well and truly identified Head, Smith and Labuschagne as the three biggest wickets for the morning, and they've got them. Ashwin has it on a string this morning, getting massive turn and some uneven bounce. Renshaw has been joined by first innings hero Peter Handscomb. S﻿teve Smith has become the second wicket of day three, out lbw off Ravi Ashwin. Smith ﻿looked to sweep Ashwin down towards fine leg, but the ball didn't bounce and struck the former skipper in front. It looked plum live - but Smith reviewed it away. Lucky for him, he got two red lights and an orange - ball tracking surprisingly had it only clipping leg stump. He's still out the but the review is retained. Smith's wicket brings substitute Matt Renshaw to the crease.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 05:03:44","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/488578/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India v Australia, second Test, day three LIVE updates: Head out in first over on day three as Australia look to extend lead","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/india-v-australia-second-test-day-three-live-updates-20230219-p5cln5.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Ronny Lerner"],"video_url":null,"description":"Follow along for all the major moments and reactions as Australia and India take the field in day three of the second Test.","content":"Ashwin is wreaking havoc. He hits Renshaw on the pad coming forward for a sweep shot and the umpire’s finger goes up again. Renshaw asks for the DRS and Snicko shows the ball makes no contact with Renshaw’s bat or glove. The ball tracking shows that the ball is pitching in line, the impact is in line, and that the ball is going to cannon into the stumps. Renshaw departs for two and Australia are in a spot of bother here at 5-95, with a lead of 96, having now lost 4-34 today. Carey is the new batsman in and Ashwin now has figures of 3-45 from 12 overs. Jadeja’s faster one stays low, skids off Labuschagne’s bottom edge and cannons into the off stump. Labuschagne isn’t able to ride his luck far, and he departs for 35. The Aussies have lost 3-34 this morning and first-innings hero Handscomb is the new man in. The tourists are 4-95 with a lead of 96. Jadeja now has figures of 2-38 from 7.4 overs. Labuschagne gets a life on 33 when he hits Ashwin to Iyer at short leg, but the ball goes straight through Iyer and Labuschagne scampers through for a single. Ashwin cannot believe it. He knows he should have a third wicket. He has been bowling beautifully today. Smith attempts to sweep Ashwin, but in doing so he goes well across his stumps, he misses the ball and is rapped on the front pad. The umpire wastes little time in raising his finger, but Smith wants to review. Not sure why, it looked absolutely plumb. In any case, it’s now in the hands of the third umpire. Snicko is showing the ball made no contact with the bat and ball tracking shows the ball pitched outside off, the impact was in line with the stumps and contact with the stumps is umpire’s call. Smith has to go for nine, but at least Australia keep their review. Renshaw is the new man in with his team 3-85, a lead of 86. Ashwin now has figures of 2-42 from 10 overs. Smith takes the aerial route, and after dancing down the pitch he slams Jadeja down to long for his first four of the match, and he moves along to seven. The Aussies are now 2-82, with a lead of 83. Labuschagne attempts another reverse sweep, but this time he misses the ball and it hits him on the thigh. The Indians are convinced Ashwin has him out lbw but the umpire is unmoved. It prompts the hosts to take it upstairs for a review. It’s a fair delivery and Snicko is showing there is no contact with the bat, but while it’s pitching outside off, the impact is outside the line and Labuschagne survives. India now have two more reviews remaining, Australia still have their full complement of three. Marnus Labuschagne. Credit: Getty Images Labuschagne executes a superb reverse sweep and sends Ashwin to the deep backward point rope for another boundary. The Aussie No.3 is going at a good pace with 26 off 28. We’re already seeing some uneven bounce on this wicket, which is great news for Australia’s spinners, who will be bowling last in this match. Labuschagne tickles Ashwin magnificently down to fine leg for his first boundary of the day. The Queenslander moves along to 22 off 23 balls. It took him seven balls, but Smith avoids the dreaded pair with a single through the leg side.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 04:14:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"smh","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Proteas need World Cup favours after loss to Australia","link":"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/cricket/proteas-world-cup-favours-australia-breaking-18-february-2023/","keywords":["Cricket","Featured","Important","Proteas","South Africa","Women’s T20 World Cup"],"creator":["James Richardson"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia's perfect run through the group stages of the Women’s T20 World Cup has left the Proteas in trouble.","content":"A blistering 57 from Tahlia McGrath completed Australia’s perfect run through the group stages of the Women’s T20 World Cup and left the Proteas in trouble. Australia beat hosts South Africa by six wickets in Gqeberha. Proteas fall short Coming to the crease with the defending champions under a little bit of pressure chasing South Africa’s 124 for six, McGrath showed no nerves as she and Ashleigh Gardner added 81 runs to take them to the brink.

Hanging by a thread South Africa, meanwhile, started both innings strongly in this one, only to fall away, and now face a must-win clash with Bangladesh, while hoping New Zealand beat Sri Lanka and that they finish top of the three-way tie on net run-rate. ALSO READ: Talented young cricketer in another health scare After being put in to bat, South Africa made a flying start. Tazmin Brits and Laura Wolvaardt combined to put on 54 runs at a run-a-ball for the opening wicket. Eventually Ellyse Perry had Wolvaardt caught behind for 19 by Beth Mooney, keeping in place of the injured Alyssa Healy. Marizanne Kapp followed for a duck before Georgia Wareham got the big one when she clean bowled Brits for 45. She removed Chloe Tryon in the same over as South Africa suddenly found themselves 77 for four. A rebuild was required, with Delmi Tucker removed for seven by Megan Schutt as the boundaries dried up. After more than eight overs without finding the ropes, Nadine de Klerk finally did the honours, smashing Schutt for a maximum over long-on before Sune Luus added a four in the final over. Proteas skipper falls The skipper was bowled by Gardner for 20, De Klerk finishing on 14 not out as they had to settle for 124 for six after such a promising start. That did not feel like enough against this Australia team, although Kapp had Perry caught at slip by Tryon for 11 before Meg Lanning was bowled around her legs for one by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the sixth over. When Kapp took out Mooney, plumb in front, for 20, Australia were 40 for three and starting to wobble. However, batting depth is the hallmark of this Australian team, and McGrath and Gardner proceeded to settle in before successive boundaries from the former in the tenth over showed their intent to pick up the pace. From then on, the fours kept coming and the target became easier and easier. McGrath moved to her half-century from just 29 balls. Three more boundaries off Mlaba took Australia within touching distance. While she was caught by Wolvaardt off Masabata Klaas trying to finish the job, Grace Harris came in to smash the winning boundary with three and a half overs to spare.

The tourists snared the required five wickets in the opening session of day four, dismissing the Black Caps for 126 after they had resumed at 63-5. Pace bowlers Stuart Broad and James Anderson both finished with four second innings wickets as England took a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Broad (4-49) laid the groundwork on Saturday night under lights when he tore through New Zealand’s top order, with all four wickets clean bowled to reduce them to 28-5 in pursuit of 394 for victory. Long-time new ball partner James Anderson (4-18) took over as chief tormentor on Sunday, knocking over four tailenders as New Zealand added 63 more runs in 22.3 overs. Only Daryl Mitchell, unbeaten on 57, put up any resistance after resuming his innings on 13, striking two sixes on his way to a sixth Test half-century. It continued Mitchell’s record of rearguard innings against the English, having scored 538 at an average of 108 runs during last June’s 3-0 series defeat in England. Michael Bracewell fell for his overnight score of 25 when looping an easy catch off spinner Jack Leach before Anderson began his clean-up job. All four of New Zealand specialist pace bowlers fell to Anderson for single-figure scores, including captain Tim Southee for a golden duck. Southee faces a challenge to lift his team, who are winless from their last eight Tests. By contrast, England are on a high after tasting their first Test win on New Zealand soil since 2008, having drawn five and lost two matches since. They have won 10 off their last 11 Tests playing an adventurous brand of attacking cricket, dubbed “Bazball”, under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes. It was just the second time in 21 day-night Tests that the visiting team has won and ended a streak of five successive losses in the pink ball format for England. They tactically dominated the game, batting aggressively and deliberately timing the end of both their innings so New Zealand had to face a new pink ball in lively seam conditions under lights on days one and three. It meant New Zealand batsmen Kane Williamson, Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls never batted in more benign daylight conditions. That will change in the second Test starting in Wellington on Friday, which will be played under traditional hours. The home side are set to regain the services of seam bowler Matt Henry, who was unavailable for the series opener to attend the birth of his child. England, 1st Innings: 325-6 decl.

Invited to bat first, Namibia posted a challenging 274-6 in their allotted 50 overs before the home team rode on half centuries from Gyanendra Malla, Aasif Sheikh and Kushal Malla to reach 278-7 with 15 balls to spare. Nepal chased down 270-plus total for the third straight match - twice against Namibia and once against Scotland - in the current series. Chasing a modest target, Nepal lost opener Kushal Bhurtel (one) in the first ball of the third over with just nine runs on the board, Aasif Sheikh and Gyanendra Malla revived the innings with a record 139-run partnership for the second wicket. Malla was the first to go, caught for 65 off 74 balls that included five fours and three sixes, after scoring his seventh ODI half century. The 139-run partnership is all-time high in ODIs for Nepal that broke the previous mark of 133 runs shared by Kushal Bhurtel and skipper Rohit Paudel against Namibia four days ago. The previous best stand for the second wicket was 122 runs shared by Sheikh and Malla against the UAE in November last year. After Malla was dismissed in the 27th over, Sheikh followed soon as Nepal were reduced to 169-3. Player-of-the-match Sheikh struck eight boundaries and two sixes in his 98-ball 81, his sixth ODI half century. Kushal Malla and skipper Rohit Paudel then added 92 runs for the fourth wicket to ease Nepal's chase. The home team lost four more wickets in the space of 13 runs before Sompal Kami (eight not out) completed the formality with a winning boundary. Kushal Malla scored a quick fire 62 off 49 balls with the help of six fours and four sixes, whereas Paudel struck five boundaries in his 43-ball 39. Ruben Trumpelmann was the pick of the Namibia bowlers taking 3-71, while Bernard Scholtz grabbed 2-42. Tangeni Lungameni and Pikky Ya France pocketed one wicket each. Earlier, Namibia added 115 runs in the last powerplay to post a challenging total on the board. They were struggling at 134-4 after 35 overs but the poor death bowling from the home team allowed the tourists to score freely in the latter stage of the innings. Karan KC conceded 25 runs in the final over, while Sompal Kami was hit for 17 in the previous one as Namibia collected 84 runs in the last five overs. Zane Green top scored for Namibia with an unbeaten 75 off just 63 balls that included 11 boundaries and a six, while Pikky Ya France hit four fours and three sixes in his 39-ball 49. They added 94 runs for the sixth wicket. Green and Ruben Trumplemann then shared a 42-run partnership for the unbroken seventh wicket. Nepal had reduced Namibia to 138-5 after Sandeep Lamichhane removed openers Karl Birkenstock (20) and Lo-Handre Louwrens in the space of three runs but Green built the innings with two crucial partnerships. Louwrens hit eight fours in his 54-ball 41, while Trumplemann remained unbeaten on 24 off just seven balls that included three boundaries and two sixes. Michael van Lingen (22), skipper Gerhard Erasmus (15) and Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton (15) also contributed in double figures. Lamichhane was the pick of the Nepali bowlers taking 3-46 from 10 overs, while Karan KC claimed one. With the day's figures, Lamichhane completed 50 wickets in the League-II series and became third player to achieve the feat in 23 matches and first spin bowler overall. Lamichhane, who made ODI debut in 2018, has so far claimed 78 wickets in 33 matches.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 03:26:41","image_url":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2023/02/19/21656.jpg","source_id":"thehimalayantimes","category":["sports"],"country":["Nepal"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Kohli Reacts As Food Arrives.

The bone of contention was whether the ball had hit the bat first or the pads. The on-field umpire gave him out and Kohli went for a DRS. Replays showed that the bat and pad were too close to each at the time of impact. Ultra Edge even detected a spike when the ball was close to the bat. The ball-tracker showed the umpire's call - as the ball was clipping leg stump. However, the replays were not conclusive enough to overturn the on-field umpire's decision. Hence, Kohli had to depart leaving India reeling. At the end of the day, Nathan Lyon said, \"Massive wicket. We all know how good Virat Kohli is. I think that decision is the right decision in my eyes. No doubt Virat would be saying that (he hit it) and that it probably should have gone his way. That happens in cricket to be honest. Hats off to the umpires. It's tough in this part of the world. We bowlers are trying to put pressure on them to try get a decision. In the end, the decision was right.\" After Kohli's dismissal, a 114-run partnership bailed India out of trouble in the first innings with the team conceding just one run lead to Australia. At the end of the second day, Australia had scored 61 runs with the loss of one wicket in their second innings, taking their lead to 62 runs with nine wickets in hand. Head scored 39 of 40 balls while Labuschagne remained unbeaten on 16.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 02:15:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Star's heroics power Aussie 'machine' to finals","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-australia-into-semis-tahlia-mcgrath-south-africa-result/e8ebf557-cb57-477a-a8fa-2052b4cc0b07","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"It was a dominant Tahlia McGrath who led the way with the bat as Australia thumped South Africa to end the group stage.","content":"Australia clinched a place in the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup by beating South Africa and ending the group stage with four wins from four.

Australia, the top-ranked team and defending champion, was impressive again to cruise past South Africa by six wickets, comfortably chasing down the tournament host's 6-124 and finshing on 4-125 with more than three overs to spare. Australia was without injured opening batter and wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but that made no difference to the performance. Middle-order batter McGrath thumped 10 fours in her 57 from 33 balls as Australia raced to victory and was confirmed as the Group 1 winner. England came through its toughest test yet by holding off India by 11 runs in their top-of-the-table meeting in Group 2. India, which also came into the game in Gqeberha unbeaten, fell short of England's total of 7-151 despite 52 from opener Smriti Mandhana and another fighting innings at the end by wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who made 47 not out but wasn't able to take her team home this time. India managed only 5-140 and England is clear at the top of the group and within a whisker of a place in the last four. England plays Pakistan in its last group game on Wednesday (AEDT). England began the game under pressure when seamer Renuka Singh struck in each of her first three overs, removing Danni Wyatt for a duck, Alice Capsey for three and Sophia Dunkley for 10. Nat Sciver-Brunt rescued England from 3-29 with her 50 from 42 balls, and her partnerships of 51 with Heather Knight and 40 with Amy Jones ensured the English posted a competitive total at St George's Park. Mandhana was up for the challenge, crashing seven fours and a six. But she fell in the 16th over and straight after hitting her six, caught at long-on attempting another big shot, to leave India too much to do. “It’s good to see that our batting group showed character even after 29 for 3,” England captain Knight said. “We haven’t really played against a big team recently and to play like this against this Indian team was fantastic.” For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here !","pubDate":"2023-02-18 21:44:54","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/488618/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ind vs Aus 2nd Test | India 14/1 at lunch on Day 3, need 101 more runs to win","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-australia-second-test-match-day-three-updates/article66528216.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ravindra Jadeja took 7/42 to put India on cusp of another big win","content":"Australian batters paid the price for some atrocious shot selection as Ravindra Jadeja’s career-best figures of 7 for 42 put India on verge of another big victory on day three of the second Test here on Sunday. Starting the day at 61 for 1, Jadeja’s arm balls became a lethal weapon as Australia were bowled out for 113 inside the first session, leaving India with a paltry victory target of 115-run target to go 2-0 up in the series and also retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Any team that wins the previous Border-Gavaskar series needs to draw the next series to retain the trophy. Australia lost nine wickets for only 52 runs and it was not the pitch but the messed up minds that led to their downfall for the second time in the series. At lunch, India were 14 for 1 with out-of-form KL Rahul (1) once again being dismissed cheaply. As many as five Australian batters went for the ugly slog sweep and some tried non-existent reverse sweep off deliveries bowled on either off-middle or leg-middle line. They were either bowled or leg before in the process as the deliveries started keeping low. Ravichandran Ashwin (3/59) also played the supporting act to perfection as eight Australian batters failed to reach double figures save overnight pair of Travis Head (45) and Marnus Labschagne (35), who had briefly counter-attacked last evening with some degree of success. But it all changed in the morning session once Head got an off-break from Ashwin and the edge was picked up by Kona Bharat behind the stumps. It is a cardinal mistake to play a sweep or reverse sweep off straighter ones or sliders if there isn’t enough bounce. The ball that trapped Steve Smith plumb in-front was on leg middle and it was a fair call. Labuschagne, who looked confident until then, went on backfoot to a delivery that was supposed to be met on the front-foot with a big stride. The result was the ball kept low and the batter was castled. Matt Renshaw doesn’t have the technique or wherewithal to guts it out on these Indian dustbowls and he has been a ‘walking wicket’ for the home team. Having replaced a concussed David Warner, Renshaw went for a sweep off Ashwin when the ball kept really low and the shot was not on. The only delivery that was classic left-arm orthodox one was bowled to Peter Handscomb (0), the best batter in the first innings. Jadeja, for a change, tossed it up and drew him forward before it turned away enough to get an outside edge into Virat Kohli’s hands. Pat Cummins’s ugly slog sweep shot was more out of anger and frustration rather than purpose and Matt Kuhnemann, while giving Jadeja his seventh wicket, looked as clueless as possible.

Here they are. ﻿ W﻿hat a session in Delhi - 10 wickets have fallen between the two sides, but India are in the box seat to win the second test and regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy. \"A session we often say the game moves quickly in India, this time the game was on a supersonic jet,\" legendary commentator Harsha Bhogle said. India are 1-14.﻿ I﻿f Australia are any chance to win this Test, they need a bit of luck. And they got some in the second over. Matt Kuhnemann took the new ball and conceded six off the first over. Nathan Lyon ﻿was thrown it down the other end. With his first ball, he picks up the wicket of KL Rahul - who goes back and hits the ball straight into the thigh of Peter Handscomb﻿ at short-leg. It balloons up into the air and Alex Carey completes the simplest of catches. Good start for Australia. M﻿att Kuhnemann as on a hiding to nothing, but he's become the last Australian wicket, bowled by Jadeja, another trying to play a sweep shot. That's seven wickets for Ravi Jadeja. Australia are all out for 113, setting India a target of 115 to win.﻿ On the desk for Fox Sports, Mike Hussey said the Aussie batters panicked during the collapse, and the Indians will be raucous. \"They're going to be demoralised, the Australians. Meanwhile India will be upbeat and excited,\" he said. Alex Carey is the seventh Australian wicket for the morning, and the fourth to be dismissed sweeping. Australia resumed at 1-61 this morning. They've now lost 7-51 in this session. Matthew Hayden in commentary perhaps summed it up best - a \"disaster\". Specifically, he's blasted the four players - Steve Smith, Matthew Renshaw, Pat Cummins and Alex Carey - who were all dismissed playing the sweep shot on a pitch that's not bouncing.﻿ \"I can't believe what I've just witnessed … they're world class players, and they've got everything to win in this session, and everything to lose,\" he said in commentary. \"They did it so well last evening in those few overs, strong scoring rate, good defence, proactive batting, but what we've seen here is a disaster for Australia. \"It's a disaster because they've gone way over the edge in terms of their aggressive play. \"You've got to think on your feet plus you also can read the game. \"You've got about 13 people in that dugout that aren't playing the game, all having their say on it, and what they would have said knowing the trend of this venue is that first session is tricky - it's not like the last session of day two, where the conditions slide on, ball is hard, drier wicket. \"It's a little tacky this morning, so think! And then plan in the middle accordingly as a partnership.\" Nathan Lyon looked more like a ﻿batter this morning that some of his more highly rated colleagues, but he's been undone by Ravi Jadeja as well. He got an inside edge onto his stumps, and Australia are now nine down.﻿ What on earth did the Australians have for breakfast this morning? This first hour has been nothing short of woeful. Head, Smith, Labuschagne and now Renshaw and Handscomb in successive balls. Having been subbed into the match for David Warner, Matthew Renshaw provided all the resistance of a wet paper bag, and was hit on the pads bang in front. He was out, but used up another review to confirm the ball had pitched outside off stump, hit him in line, and would have hit middle stump. \"Ashwin on a rampage here this morning. He's bowled quite beautifully,\" Ravi Shastri said. Renshaw didn't look great in the first Test, and he didn't look great in this innings this morning. Then with the next ball, Peter Handscomb played a really nothing shot to Jadeja, and he succeeded only in edging it straight to Virat Kohli at first slip. AND NOW CUMMINS. The Australian skipper walked to the crease and knowing his side are in dire straits, decides to sweep Jadeja and is clean bowled. Four wickets in 11 balls. A team hat-trick between Ashwin and Jadeja. Nathan Lyon calmly defends Jadeja's hat﻿-trick ball. The Aussies are starting to crumble here - Marnus Labuschagne has been scratchy this morning and he's been bowled by Ravi Jadeja for 35. Jadeja threw in the flatter and quicker one, and Labuschagne - clearly not picking it - went back and pool cued it onto his middle and off stump. \"That's a cleanup job if ever there was one - flat, fast and castling Labuschagne,\" Ravi Shastri said in commentary. Just as it was yesterday, the first hour of play this morning has been tricky for the incoming batters. A hard, new ball, and with the pitch starting to do things, batters have their work cut out for them. The Indians would have well and truly identified Head, Smith and Labuschagne as the three biggest wickets for the morning, and they've got them. Ashwin has it on a string this morning, getting massive turn and some uneven bounce. Renshaw has been joined by first innings hero Peter Handscomb. S﻿teve Smith has become the second wicket of day three, out lbw off Ravi Ashwin. Smith ﻿looked to sweep Ashwin down towards fine leg, but the ball didn't bounce and struck the former skipper in front. It looked plum live - but Smith reviewed it away. Lucky for him, he got two red lights and an orange - ball tracking surprisingly had it only clipping leg stump. He's still out the but the review is retained. Smith's wicket brings substitute Matt Renshaw to the crease.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 05:03:44","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/488578/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India v Australia, second Test, day three LIVE updates: Head out in first over on day three as Australia look to extend lead","link":"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/india-v-australia-second-test-day-three-live-updates-20230219-p5cln5.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Ronny Lerner"],"video_url":null,"description":"Follow along for all the major moments and reactions as Australia and India take the field in day three of the second Test.","content":"Ashwin is wreaking havoc. He hits Renshaw on the pad coming forward for a sweep shot and the umpire’s finger goes up again. Renshaw asks for the DRS and Snicko shows the ball makes no contact with Renshaw’s bat or glove. The ball tracking shows that the ball is pitching in line, the impact is in line, and that the ball is going to cannon into the stumps. Renshaw departs for two and Australia are in a spot of bother here at 5-95, with a lead of 96, having now lost 4-34 today. Carey is the new batsman in and Ashwin now has figures of 3-45 from 12 overs. Jadeja’s faster one stays low, skids off Labuschagne’s bottom edge and cannons into the off stump. Labuschagne isn’t able to ride his luck far, and he departs for 35. The Aussies have lost 3-34 this morning and first-innings hero Handscomb is the new man in. The tourists are 4-95 with a lead of 96. Jadeja now has figures of 2-38 from 7.4 overs. Labuschagne gets a life on 33 when he hits Ashwin to Iyer at short leg, but the ball goes straight through Iyer and Labuschagne scampers through for a single. Ashwin cannot believe it. He knows he should have a third wicket. He has been bowling beautifully today. Smith attempts to sweep Ashwin, but in doing so he goes well across his stumps, he misses the ball and is rapped on the front pad. The umpire wastes little time in raising his finger, but Smith wants to review. Not sure why, it looked absolutely plumb. In any case, it’s now in the hands of the third umpire. Snicko is showing the ball made no contact with the bat and ball tracking shows the ball pitched outside off, the impact was in line with the stumps and contact with the stumps is umpire’s call. Smith has to go for nine, but at least Australia keep their review. Renshaw is the new man in with his team 3-85, a lead of 86. Ashwin now has figures of 2-42 from 10 overs. Smith takes the aerial route, and after dancing down the pitch he slams Jadeja down to long for his first four of the match, and he moves along to seven. The Aussies are now 2-82, with a lead of 83. Labuschagne attempts another reverse sweep, but this time he misses the ball and it hits him on the thigh. The Indians are convinced Ashwin has him out lbw but the umpire is unmoved. It prompts the hosts to take it upstairs for a review. It’s a fair delivery and Snicko is showing there is no contact with the bat, but while it’s pitching outside off, the impact is outside the line and Labuschagne survives. India now have two more reviews remaining, Australia still have their full complement of three. Marnus Labuschagne.

Marizanne Kapp followed for a duck before Georgia Wareham got the big one when she clean bowled Brits for 45. She removed Chloe Tryon in the same over as South Africa suddenly found themselves 77 for four. A rebuild was required, with Delmi Tucker removed for seven by Megan Schutt as the boundaries dried up. After more than eight overs without finding the ropes, Nadine de Klerk finally did the honours, smashing Schutt for a maximum over long-on before Sune Luus added a four in the final over.

That did not feel like enough against this Australia team, although Kapp had Perry caught at slip by Tryon for 11 before Meg Lanning was bowled around her legs for one by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the sixth over. When Kapp took out Mooney, plumb in front, for 20, Australia were 40 for three and starting to wobble. However, batting depth is the hallmark of this Australian team, and McGrath and Gardner proceeded to settle in before successive boundaries from the former in the tenth over showed their intent to pick up the pace. From then on, the fours kept coming and the target became easier and easier. McGrath moved to her half-century from just 29 balls. Three more boundaries off Mlaba took Australia within touching distance.

The tourists snared the required five wickets in the opening session of day four, dismissing the Black Caps for 126 after they had resumed at 63-5. Pace bowlers Stuart Broad and James Anderson both finished with four second innings wickets as England took a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Broad (4-49) laid the groundwork on Saturday night under lights when he tore through New Zealand’s top order, with all four wickets clean bowled to reduce them to 28-5 in pursuit of 394 for victory. Long-time new ball partner James Anderson (4-18) took over as chief tormentor on Sunday, knocking over four tailenders as New Zealand added 63 more runs in 22.3 overs. Only Daryl Mitchell, unbeaten on 57, put up any resistance after resuming his innings on 13, striking two sixes on his way to a sixth Test half-century. It continued Mitchell’s record of rearguard innings against the English, having scored 538 at an average of 108 runs during last June’s 3-0 series defeat in England. Michael Bracewell fell for his overnight score of 25 when looping an easy catch off spinner Jack Leach before Anderson began his clean-up job. All four of New Zealand specialist pace bowlers fell to Anderson for single-figure scores, including captain Tim Southee for a golden duck. Southee faces a challenge to lift his team, who are winless from their last eight Tests. By contrast, England are on a high after tasting their first Test win on New Zealand soil since 2008, having drawn five and lost two matches since. They have won 10 off their last 11 Tests playing an adventurous brand of attacking cricket, dubbed “Bazball”, under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes. It was just the second time in 21 day-night Tests that the visiting team has won and ended a streak of five successive losses in the pink ball format for England. They tactically dominated the game, batting aggressively and deliberately timing the end of both their innings so New Zealand had to face a new pink ball in lively seam conditions under lights on days one and three. It meant New Zealand batsmen Kane Williamson, Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls never batted in more benign daylight conditions. That will change in the second Test starting in Wellington on Friday, which will be played under traditional hours. The home side are set to regain the services of seam bowler Matt Henry, who was unavailable for the series opener to attend the birth of his child. England, 1st Innings: 325-6 decl.

Nepal chased down 270-plus total for the third straight match - twice against Namibia and once against Scotland - in the current series. Chasing a modest target, Nepal lost opener Kushal Bhurtel (one) in the first ball of the third over with just nine runs on the board, Aasif Sheikh and Gyanendra Malla revived the innings with a record 139-run partnership for the second wicket. Malla was the first to go, caught for 65 off 74 balls that included five fours and three sixes, after scoring his seventh ODI half century. The 139-run partnership is all-time high in ODIs for Nepal that broke the previous mark of 133 runs shared by Kushal Bhurtel and skipper Rohit Paudel against Namibia four days ago. The previous best stand for the second wicket was 122 runs shared by Sheikh and Malla against the UAE in November last year. After Malla was dismissed in the 27th over, Sheikh followed soon as Nepal were reduced to 169-3. Player-of-the-match Sheikh struck eight boundaries and two sixes in his 98-ball 81, his sixth ODI half century. Kushal Malla and skipper Rohit Paudel then added 92 runs for the fourth wicket to ease Nepal's chase. The home team lost four more wickets in the space of 13 runs before Sompal Kami (eight not out) completed the formality with a winning boundary. Kushal Malla scored a quick fire 62 off 49 balls with the help of six fours and four sixes, whereas Paudel struck five boundaries in his 43-ball 39. Ruben Trumpelmann was the pick of the Namibia bowlers taking 3-71, while Bernard Scholtz grabbed 2-42. Tangeni Lungameni and Pikky Ya France pocketed one wicket each. Earlier, Namibia added 115 runs in the last powerplay to post a challenging total on the board. They were struggling at 134-4 after 35 overs but the poor death bowling from the home team allowed the tourists to score freely in the latter stage of the innings. Karan KC conceded 25 runs in the final over, while Sompal Kami was hit for 17 in the previous one as Namibia collected 84 runs in the last five overs. Zane Green top scored for Namibia with an unbeaten 75 off just 63 balls that included 11 boundaries and a six, while Pikky Ya France hit four fours and three sixes in his 39-ball 49. They added 94 runs for the sixth wicket. Green and Ruben Trumplemann then shared a 42-run partnership for the unbroken seventh wicket. Nepal had reduced Namibia to 138-5 after Sandeep Lamichhane removed openers Karl Birkenstock (20) and Lo-Handre Louwrens in the space of three runs but Green built the innings with two crucial partnerships. Louwrens hit eight fours in his 54-ball 41, while Trumplemann remained unbeaten on 24 off just seven balls that included three boundaries and two sixes. Michael van Lingen (22), skipper Gerhard Erasmus (15) and Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton (15) also contributed in double figures. Lamichhane was the pick of the Nepali bowlers taking 3-46 from 10 overs, while Karan KC claimed one. With the day's figures, Lamichhane completed 50 wickets in the League-II series and became third player to achieve the feat in 23 matches and first spin bowler overall. Lamichhane, who made ODI debut in 2018, has so far claimed 78 wickets in 33 matches.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 03:26:41","image_url":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2023/02/19/21656.jpg","source_id":"thehimalayantimes","category":["sports"],"country":["Nepal"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Kohli Reacts As Food Arrives.

The former India captain was going great on the second day of the second Test against Australia in Delhi, until a contentious LBW call had him walking back to the pavilion. The former India captain looked solid while wickets kept on falling at the other end, but against Test debutant Matthew Kuhnemann 's left-arm spin, Kohli was given out. The bone of contention was whether the ball had hit the bat first or the pads. The on-field umpire gave him out and Kohli went for a DRS. Replays showed that the bat and pad were too close to each at the time of impact. Ultra Edge even detected a spike when the ball was close to the bat. The ball-tracker showed the umpire's call - as the ball was clipping leg stump. However, the replays were not conclusive enough to overturn the on-field umpire's decision. Hence, Kohli had to depart leaving India reeling. At the end of the day, Nathan Lyon said, \"Massive wicket. We all know how good Virat Kohli is. I think that decision is the right decision in my eyes. No doubt Virat would be saying that (he hit it) and that it probably should have gone his way. That happens in cricket to be honest. Hats off to the umpires. It's tough in this part of the world. We bowlers are trying to put pressure on them to try get a decision. In the end, the decision was right.\" After Kohli's dismissal, a 114-run partnership bailed India out of trouble in the first innings with the team conceding just one run lead to Australia. At the end of the second day, Australia had scored 61 runs with the loss of one wicket in their second innings, taking their lead to 62 runs with nine wickets in hand.

Australia, the top-ranked team and defending champion, was impressive again to cruise past South Africa by six wickets, comfortably chasing down the tournament host's 6-124 and finshing on 4-125 with more than three overs to spare. Australia was without injured opening batter and wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but that made no difference to the performance. Middle-order batter McGrath thumped 10 fours in her 57 from 33 balls as Australia raced to victory and was confirmed as the Group 1 winner. England came through its toughest test yet by holding off India by 11 runs in their top-of-the-table meeting in Group 2. India, which also came into the game in Gqeberha unbeaten, fell short of England's total of 7-151 despite 52 from opener Smriti Mandhana and another fighting innings at the end by wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who made 47 not out but wasn't able to take her team home this time. India managed only 5-140 and England is clear at the top of the group and within a whisker of a place in the last four. England plays Pakistan in its last group game on Wednesday (AEDT). England began the game under pressure when seamer Renuka Singh struck in each of her first three overs, removing Danni Wyatt for a duck, Alice Capsey for three and Sophia Dunkley for 10.

But she fell in the 16th over and straight after hitting her six, caught at long-on attempting another big shot, to leave India too much to do. “It’s good to see that our batting group showed character even after 29 for 3,” England captain Knight said. “We haven’t really played against a big team recently and to play like this against this Indian team was fantastic.” For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here !","pubDate":"2023-02-18 21:44:54","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/488618/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ind vs Aus 2nd Test | India 14/1 at lunch on Day 3, need 101 more runs to win","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-australia-second-test-match-day-three-updates/article66528216.ece","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ravindra Jadeja took 7/42 to put India on cusp of another big win","content":"Australian batters paid the price for some atrocious shot selection as Ravindra Jadeja’s career-best figures of 7 for 42 put India on verge of another big victory on day three of the second Test here on Sunday. Starting the day at 61 for 1, Jadeja’s arm balls became a lethal weapon as Australia were bowled out for 113 inside the first session, leaving India with a paltry victory target of 115-run target to go 2-0 up in the series and also retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Any team that wins the previous Border-Gavaskar series needs to draw the next series to retain the trophy. Australia lost nine wickets for only 52 runs and it was not the pitch but the messed up minds that led to their downfall for the second time in the series. At lunch, India were 14 for 1 with out-of-form KL Rahul (1) once again being dismissed cheaply. As many as five Australian batters went for the ugly slog sweep and some tried non-existent reverse sweep off deliveries bowled on either off-middle or leg-middle line. They were either bowled or leg before in the process as the deliveries started keeping low. Ravichandran Ashwin (3/59) also played the supporting act to perfection as eight Australian batters failed to reach double figures save overnight pair of Travis Head (45) and Marnus Labschagne (35), who had briefly counter-attacked last evening with some degree of success. But it all changed in the morning session once Head got an off-break from Ashwin and the edge was picked up by Kona Bharat behind the stumps. It is a cardinal mistake to play a sweep or reverse sweep off straighter ones or sliders if there isn’t enough bounce. The ball that trapped Steve Smith plumb in-front was on leg middle and it was a fair call. Labuschagne, who looked confident until then, went on backfoot to a delivery that was supposed to be met on the front-foot with a big stride. The result was the ball kept low and the batter was castled. Matt Renshaw doesn’t have the technique or wherewithal to guts it out on these Indian dustbowls and he has been a ‘walking wicket’ for the home team. Having replaced a concussed David Warner, Renshaw went for a sweep off Ashwin when the ball kept really low and the shot was not on. The only delivery that was classic left-arm orthodox one was bowled to Peter Handscomb (0), the best batter in the first innings. Jadeja, for a change, tossed it up and drew him forward before it turned away enough to get an outside edge into Virat Kohli’s hands. Pat Cummins’s ugly slog sweep shot was more out of anger and frustration rather than purpose and Matt Kuhnemann, while giving Jadeja his seventh wicket, looked as clueless as possible.

Here they are. ﻿ W﻿hat a session in Delhi - 10 wickets have fallen between the two sides, but India are in the box seat to win the second test and regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy. \"A session we often say the game moves quickly in India, this time the game was on a supersonic jet,\" legendary commentator Harsha Bhogle said. India are 1-14.﻿ I﻿f Australia are any chance to win this Test, they need a bit of luck. And they got some in the second over. Matt Kuhnemann took the new ball and conceded six off the first over. Nathan Lyon ﻿was thrown it down the other end. With his first ball, he picks up the wicket of KL Rahul - who goes back and hits the ball straight into the thigh of Peter Handscomb﻿ at short-leg. It balloons up into the air and Alex Carey completes the simplest of catches. Good start for Australia. M﻿att Kuhnemann as on a hiding to nothing, but he's become the last Australian wicket, bowled by Jadeja, another trying to play a sweep shot. That's seven wickets for Ravi Jadeja. Australia are all out for 113, setting India a target of 115 to win.﻿ On the desk for Fox Sports, Mike Hussey said the Aussie batters panicked during the collapse, and the Indians will be raucous. \"They're going to be demoralised, the Australians. Meanwhile India will be upbeat and excited,\" he said. Alex Carey is the seventh Australian wicket for the morning, and the fourth to be dismissed sweeping. Australia resumed at 1-61 this morning. They've now lost 7-51 in this session. Matthew Hayden in commentary perhaps summed it up best - a \"disaster\". Specifically, he's blasted the four players - Steve Smith, Matthew Renshaw, Pat Cummins and Alex Carey - who were all dismissed playing the sweep shot on a pitch that's not bouncing.﻿ \"I can't believe what I've just witnessed … they're world class players, and they've got everything to win in this session, and everything to lose,\" he said in commentary. \"They did it so well last evening in those few overs, strong scoring rate, good defence, proactive batting, but what we've seen here is a disaster for Australia. \"It's a disaster because they've gone way over the edge in terms of their aggressive play. \"You've got to think on your feet plus you also can read the game. \"You've got about 13 people in that dugout that aren't playing the game, all having their say on it, and what they would have said knowing the trend of this venue is that first session is tricky - it's not like the last session of day two, where the conditions slide on, ball is hard, drier wicket. \"It's a little tacky this morning, so think! And then plan in the middle accordingly as a partnership.\" Nathan Lyon looked more like a ﻿batter this morning that some of his more highly rated colleagues, but he's been undone by Ravi Jadeja as well. He got an inside edge onto his stumps, and Australia are now nine down.﻿ What on earth did the Australians have for breakfast this morning? This first hour has been nothing short of woeful. Head, Smith, Labuschagne and now Renshaw and Handscomb in successive balls. Having been subbed into the match for David Warner, Matthew Renshaw provided all the resistance of a wet paper bag, and was hit on the pads bang in front. He was out, but used up another review to confirm the ball had pitched outside off stump, hit him in line, and would have hit middle stump. \"Ashwin on a rampage here this morning. He's bowled quite beautifully,\" Ravi Shastri said. Renshaw didn't look great in the first Test, and he didn't look great in this innings this morning. Then with the next ball, Peter Handscomb played a really nothing shot to Jadeja, and he succeeded only in edging it straight to Virat Kohli at first slip. AND NOW CUMMINS. The Australian skipper walked to the crease and knowing his side are in dire straits, decides to sweep Jadeja and is clean bowled. Four wickets in 11 balls. A team hat-trick between Ashwin and Jadeja. Nathan Lyon calmly defends Jadeja's hat﻿-trick ball. The Aussies are starting to crumble here - Marnus Labuschagne has been scratchy this morning and he's been bowled by Ravi Jadeja for 35. Jadeja threw in the flatter and quicker one, and Labuschagne - clearly not picking it - went back and pool cued it onto his middle and off stump. \"That's a cleanup job if ever there was one - flat, fast and castling Labuschagne,\" Ravi Shastri said in commentary. Just as it was yesterday, the first hour of play this morning has been tricky for the incoming batters. A hard, new ball, and with the pitch starting to do things, batters have their work cut out for them. The Indians would have well and truly identified Head, Smith and Labuschagne as the three biggest wickets for the morning, and they've got them. Ashwin has it on a string this morning, getting massive turn and some uneven bounce. Renshaw has been joined by first innings hero Peter Handscomb. S﻿teve Smith has become the second wicket of day three, out lbw off Ravi Ashwin. Smith ﻿looked to sweep Ashwin down towards fine leg, but the ball didn't bounce and struck the former skipper in front. It looked plum live - but Smith reviewed it away. Lucky for him, he got two red lights and an orange - ball tracking surprisingly had it only clipping leg stump. He's still out the but the review is retained.

Smith attempts to sweep Ashwin, but in doing so he goes well across his stumps, he misses the ball and is rapped on the front pad.

Snicko is showing the ball made no contact with the bat and ball tracking shows the ball pitched outside off, the impact was in line with the stumps and contact with the stumps is umpire’s call.

Smith takes the aerial route, and after dancing down the pitch he slams Jadeja down to long for his first four of the match, and he moves along to seven. The Aussies are now 2-82, with a lead of 83. Labuschagne attempts another reverse sweep, but this time he misses the ball and it hits him on the thigh. The Indians are convinced Ashwin has him out lbw but the umpire is unmoved. It prompts the hosts to take it upstairs for a review. It’s a fair delivery and Snicko is showing there is no contact with the bat, but while it’s pitching outside off, the impact is outside the line and Labuschagne survives. India now have two more reviews remaining, Australia still have their full complement of three. Marnus Labuschagne.

Eventually Ellyse Perry had Wolvaardt caught behind for 19 by Beth Mooney, keeping in place of the injured Alyssa Healy. Marizanne Kapp followed for a duck before Georgia Wareham got the big one when she clean bowled Brits for 45. She removed Chloe Tryon in the same over as South Africa suddenly found themselves 77 for four. A rebuild was required, with Delmi Tucker removed for seven by Megan Schutt as the boundaries dried up. After more than eight overs without finding the ropes, Nadine de Klerk finally did the honours, smashing Schutt for a maximum over long-on before Sune Luus added a four in the final over. Proteas skipper falls The skipper was bowled by Gardner for 20, De Klerk finishing on 14 not out as they had to settle for 124 for six after such a promising start. That did not feel like enough against this Australia team, although Kapp had Perry caught at slip by Tryon for 11 before Meg Lanning was bowled around her legs for one by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the sixth over. When Kapp took out Mooney, plumb in front, for 20, Australia were 40 for three and starting to wobble. However, batting depth is the hallmark of this Australian team, and McGrath and Gardner proceeded to settle in before successive boundaries from the former in the tenth over showed their intent to pick up the pace. From then on, the fours kept coming and the target became easier and easier. McGrath moved to her half-century from just 29 balls. Three more boundaries off Mlaba took Australia within touching distance. While she was caught by Wolvaardt off Masabata Klaas trying to finish the job, Grace Harris came in to smash the winning boundary with three and a half overs to spare.

The tourists snared the required five wickets in the opening session of day four, dismissing the Black Caps for 126 after they had resumed at 63-5. Pace bowlers Stuart Broad and James Anderson both finished with four second innings wickets as England took a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Broad (4-49) laid the groundwork on Saturday night under lights when he tore through New Zealand’s top order, with all four wickets clean bowled to reduce them to 28-5 in pursuit of 394 for victory. Long-time new ball partner James Anderson (4-18) took over as chief tormentor on Sunday, knocking over four tailenders as New Zealand added 63 more runs in 22.3 overs. Only Daryl Mitchell, unbeaten on 57, put up any resistance after resuming his innings on 13, striking two sixes on his way to a sixth Test half-century. It continued Mitchell’s record of rearguard innings against the English, having scored 538 at an average of 108 runs during last June’s 3-0 series defeat in England. Michael Bracewell fell for his overnight score of 25 when looping an easy catch off spinner Jack Leach before Anderson began his clean-up job. All four of New Zealand specialist pace bowlers fell to Anderson for single-figure scores, including captain Tim Southee for a golden duck. Southee faces a challenge to lift his team, who are winless from their last eight Tests. By contrast, England are on a high after tasting their first Test win on New Zealand soil since 2008, having drawn five and lost two matches since. They have won 10 off their last 11 Tests playing an adventurous brand of attacking cricket, dubbed “Bazball”, under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes. It was just the second time in 21 day-night Tests that the visiting team has won and ended a streak of five successive losses in the pink ball format for England. They tactically dominated the game, batting aggressively and deliberately timing the end of both their innings so New Zealand had to face a new pink ball in lively seam conditions under lights on days one and three. It meant New Zealand batsmen Kane Williamson, Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls never batted in more benign daylight conditions. That will change in the second Test starting in Wellington on Friday, which will be played under traditional hours. The home side are set to regain the services of seam bowler Matt Henry, who was unavailable for the series opener to attend the birth of his child. England, 1st Innings: 325-6 decl. (Harry Brook 89, Ben Duckett 84, Ollie Pope 42; Neil Wagner 4-82). New Zealand, 1st Innings 306 (Tom Blundell 138, Devon Conway 77; Ollie Robinson 4-54). England, 2nd Innings 374 (Joe Root 57, Harry Brook 54, Ben Foakes 51, Ollie Pope 49; Blair Tickner 3-55).

Invited to bat first, Namibia posted a challenging 274-6 in their allotted 50 overs before the home team rode on half centuries from Gyanendra Malla, Aasif Sheikh and Kushal Malla to reach 278-7 with 15 balls to spare. Nepal chased down 270-plus total for the third straight match - twice against Namibia and once against Scotland - in the current series. Chasing a modest target, Nepal lost opener Kushal Bhurtel (one) in the first ball of the third over with just nine runs on the board, Aasif Sheikh and Gyanendra Malla revived the innings with a record 139-run partnership for the second wicket. Malla was the first to go, caught for 65 off 74 balls that included five fours and three sixes, after scoring his seventh ODI half century. The 139-run partnership is all-time high in ODIs for Nepal that broke the previous mark of 133 runs shared by Kushal Bhurtel and skipper Rohit Paudel against Namibia four days ago. The previous best stand for the second wicket was 122 runs shared by Sheikh and Malla against the UAE in November last year. After Malla was dismissed in the 27th over, Sheikh followed soon as Nepal were reduced to 169-3. Player-of-the-match Sheikh struck eight boundaries and two sixes in his 98-ball 81, his sixth ODI half century. Kushal Malla and skipper Rohit Paudel then added 92 runs for the fourth wicket to ease Nepal's chase. The home team lost four more wickets in the space of 13 runs before Sompal Kami (eight not out) completed the formality with a winning boundary. Kushal Malla scored a quick fire 62 off 49 balls with the help of six fours and four sixes, whereas Paudel struck five boundaries in his 43-ball 39. Ruben Trumpelmann was the pick of the Namibia bowlers taking 3-71, while Bernard Scholtz grabbed 2-42. Tangeni Lungameni and Pikky Ya France pocketed one wicket each. Earlier, Namibia added 115 runs in the last powerplay to post a challenging total on the board. They were struggling at 134-4 after 35 overs but the poor death bowling from the home team allowed the tourists to score freely in the latter stage of the innings. Karan KC conceded 25 runs in the final over, while Sompal Kami was hit for 17 in the previous one as Namibia collected 84 runs in the last five overs. Zane Green top scored for Namibia with an unbeaten 75 off just 63 balls that included 11 boundaries and a six, while Pikky Ya France hit four fours and three sixes in his 39-ball 49. They added 94 runs for the sixth wicket. Green and Ruben Trumplemann then shared a 42-run partnership for the unbroken seventh wicket. Nepal had reduced Namibia to 138-5 after Sandeep Lamichhane removed openers Karl Birkenstock (20) and Lo-Handre Louwrens in the space of three runs but Green built the innings with two crucial partnerships. Louwrens hit eight fours in his 54-ball 41, while Trumplemann remained unbeaten on 24 off just seven balls that included three boundaries and two sixes. Michael van Lingen (22), skipper Gerhard Erasmus (15) and Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton (15) also contributed in double figures. Lamichhane was the pick of the Nepali bowlers taking 3-46 from 10 overs, while Karan KC claimed one. With the day's figures, Lamichhane completed 50 wickets in the League-II series and became third player to achieve the feat in 23 matches and first spin bowler overall. Lamichhane, who made ODI debut in 2018, has so far claimed 78 wickets in 33 matches.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 03:26:41","image_url":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2023/02/19/21656.jpg","source_id":"thehimalayantimes","category":["sports"],"country":["Nepal"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Watch: Kohli Reacts As Food Arrives.

That was until Kohli (44 off 84 balls) was given LBW off Matthew Kuhnemann in a decision that raised eyebrows. Even Kohli was not happy and was seen fuming in the dressing room. Kohli's wicket fell when India were in a tricky spot in the first innings against Australia. Later, Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel stitched a 100-plus stand to revive India's chances. After the dismissal, Kohli could be seen indulging in an intense discussion with coach Rahul Dravid when a man arrived with food. Kohli looked really happy after that. The commentators and several social media users said that it might have been \"Chhole bhature\". Though, what exactly was the content of the food packet, could not be seen in the video that has gone viral on social media.

India were all out for 262 after a key 114-run eighth-wicket fightback by Axar and Ravichandran Ashwin, leaving the tourists a lead of one run in New Delhi. Australia raced to 61 for one at stumps after Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Usman Khawaja for six after a reverse sweep flew straight to leg slip.

The former India captain was going great on the second day of the second Test against Australia in Delhi, until a contentious LBW call had him walking back to the pavilion. The former India captain looked solid while wickets kept on falling at the other end, but against Test debutant Matthew Kuhnemann 's left-arm spin, Kohli was given out. The bone of contention was whether the ball had hit the bat first or the pads. The on-field umpire gave him out and Kohli went for a DRS. Replays showed that the bat and pad were too close to each at the time of impact. Ultra Edge even detected a spike when the ball was close to the bat. The ball-tracker showed the umpire's call - as the ball was clipping leg stump. However, the replays were not conclusive enough to overturn the on-field umpire's decision. Hence, Kohli had to depart leaving India reeling. At the end of the day, Nathan Lyon said, \"Massive wicket. We all know how good Virat Kohli is. I think that decision is the right decision in my eyes. No doubt Virat would be saying that (he hit it) and that it probably should have gone his way. That happens in cricket to be honest. Hats off to the umpires. It's tough in this part of the world. We bowlers are trying to put pressure on them to try get a decision. In the end, the decision was right.\" After Kohli's dismissal, a 114-run partnership bailed India out of trouble in the first innings with the team conceding just one run lead to Australia. At the end of the second day, Australia had scored 61 runs with the loss of one wicket in their second innings, taking their lead to 62 runs with nine wickets in hand. Head scored 39 of 40 balls while Labuschagne remained unbeaten on 16.","pubDate":"2023-02-19 02:15:34","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Star's heroics power Aussie 'machine' to finals","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-australia-into-semis-tahlia-mcgrath-south-africa-result/e8ebf557-cb57-477a-a8fa-2052b4cc0b07","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"It was a dominant Tahlia McGrath who led the way with the bat as Australia thumped South Africa to end the group stage.","content":"Australia clinched a place in the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup by beating South Africa and ending the group stage with four wins from four.

She posted an 81-run partnership with Ashleigh Gardner to steer the Aussies home.

Australia, the top-ranked team and defending champion, was impressive again to cruise past South Africa by six wickets, comfortably chasing down the tournament host's 6-124 and finshing on 4-125 with more than three overs to spare. Australia was without injured opening batter and wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy but that made no difference to the performance. Middle-order batter McGrath thumped 10 fours in her 57 from 33 balls as Australia raced to victory and was confirmed as the Group 1 winner. England came through its toughest test yet by holding off India by 11 runs in their top-of-the-table meeting in Group 2. India, which also came into the game in Gqeberha unbeaten, fell short of England's total of 7-151 despite 52 from opener Smriti Mandhana and another fighting innings at the end by wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who made 47 not out but wasn't able to take her team home this time. India managed only 5-140 and England is clear at the top of the group and within a whisker of a place in the last four. England plays Pakistan in its last group game on Wednesday (AEDT). England began the game under pressure when seamer Renuka Singh struck in each of her first three overs, removing Danni Wyatt for a duck, Alice Capsey for three and Sophia Dunkley for 10. Nat Sciver-Brunt rescued England from 3-29 with her 50 from 42 balls, and her partnerships of 51 with Heather Knight and 40 with Amy Jones ensured the English posted a competitive total at St George's Park. Mandhana was up for the challenge, crashing seven fours and a six. But she fell in the 16th over and straight after hitting her six, caught at long-on attempting another big shot, to leave India too much to do. “It’s good to see that our batting group showed character even after 29 for 3,” England captain Knight said. “We haven’t really played against a big team recently and to play like this against this Indian team was fantastic.” For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here !","pubDate":"2023-02-18 21:44:54","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2023/02/488618/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"}]}
