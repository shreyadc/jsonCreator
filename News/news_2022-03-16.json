Azam cracked a fighting century with great support from opener Abdullah Shafique Tuesday as Pakistan thwarted Australia‚Äôs hopes of a quick win in the second Test in Karachi. Set a daunting 506-run target, Azam knocked his sixth Test century - and second against Australia - to guide Pakistan to 2-192 and raise hopes of an improbable victory, or even a fighting draw. Watch Australia‚Äôs Tour of Pakistan on Kayo. Every Test, ODI and T20 Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Try 14-Days Free Now > At the close Azam was unbeaten on 102 and Shafique 71 as the pair added 171 for the third wicket, leaving the home team needing another 314 runs in the 90 overs of the final day for a win, or bat out three sessions for the draw. ‚ÄúThe match hasn‚Äôt finished yet,‚Äù Azam told the host broadcasters. ‚ÄúWe need to continue batting like this and keep the belief (to create history). ‚ÄúDefinitely, my hundred was needed by the team and my plan was to build a partnership, which Shafique and I did, but we need to continue like this (on Wednesday).‚Äù Pakistan make a stand on Day 4 | 02:36 Pakistan lost Imam-ul-Haq (one) and Azhar Ali (six) before Shafique and Azam led the fightback, leaving Australia wicketless in the last session -- despite taking the second new ball after 80 overs. Azam top-edged a sweep off spinner Mitchell Swepson towards short fine-leg for two to reach the three-figure mark, his first in 21 innings since his 143 against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi in February 2020. His hundred came in 247 minutes with 12 boundaries. Shafique was as solid as his skipper, having so far hit four boundaries and a six as he and Azam batted defiantly for 265 minutes. No team has ever chased more than the 418-7 the West Indies amassed against Australia at Antigua in 2003, while Pakistan‚Äôs highest successful chase was 377 against Sri Lanka at Pallekele in 2015. Australia, resuming their second innings at 81-1, batted for just 26 minutes at the start of play to add 16 runs before declaring on 97-2. The visitors scored 556-9 declared in their first innings then dismissed Pakistan for 148. The home team had hoped Azhar would anchor the second innings but the senior batsman was trapped lbw by Cameron Green while trying to evade a short-pitched delivery. Pakistan produce two DRS shockers! | 01:26 Azhar chose not to review as he trudged off but was left to regret it as television replays showed he had gloved the ball. At 21-2, Australia seemed to have the upper edge and were looking to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series but their efforts were thwarted by a slow turning pitch and the brilliance of Pakistan‚Äôs batting pair. Australia could have had Shafique on 20 but the experienced Steve Smith spilt a straightforward catch in the slips off pacer Pat Cummins. Australia‚Äôs batting coach Michael Di Venuto described the chance as part of the game. ‚ÄúSmith has good hands and he takes nine out of ten such catches but that happens,‚Äù said Di Venuto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be hard work (tomorrow) and since there is variable bounce on the pitch, it‚Äôs going to be interesting.‚Äù Despite cracks on the National Cricket Stadium pitch, Australian spinners Nathan Lyon and Swepson failed to get vicious turn. Earlier, Haq and Shafique were all caution as it took them until the fifth over to score the first run before Lyon struck. The in-form Haq, who scored a hundred in each innings of the drawn first Test in Rawalpindi, was trapped lbw for one as he failed to connect with a sliding delivery. Earlier, Marnus Labuschagne was bowled off a sharp Shaheen Shah Afridi delivery for 44 to prompt skipper Cummins to call Australia‚Äôs innings to a close with first-innings century-maker Usman Khawaja, who was born in Pakistan, remaining 44 not out.

His family have reportedly told the Melbourne Cricket Club he preferred a different option to the one first announced by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews soon after his shock death. Mr Andrews flagged the Great Southern Stand would be renamed the S.K. Warne Stand. But, according to 7NEWS Melbourne reporter Tom Browne, the cricket legend wanted something different. ‚ÄúMy understanding is that it will be called the Shane Warne stand,‚Äù Browne said. ‚ÄúI spoke to a senior government source who emphasised the final decision will be down to the Warne family.‚Äù The MCG was the stage of Warne‚Äôs famous Ashes hat-trick in 1994 and 700th Test wicket on Boxing Day in 2006 during his final series before retiring from international cricket. The hallowed ground is also set to host a State memorial service for the Australian cricket legend on March 30 to honour the cricket legend. About 100,000 people are expected to attend the twilight service. Livestreams of the service are also likely to be shown at other cricket grounds around the country, with the Sydney Cricket Ground confirming it would do so. Warne‚Äôs former wife Simone Callahan gathered with her children at the leg-spin great‚Äôs MCG statue, a little over a week after his shock death during a boys‚Äô trip to Thailand. Medical authorities have confirmed he died of natural causes, believed to be a heart attack. He was aged 52. Ms Callahan and the couple‚Äôs three children, Brooke, 24, Jackson, 23 and Summer, 20, posed for a picture under the statue, which is located outside Gate 2 at the massive stadium. The image is accompanied by the piano of Peder B. Helland in his track Rose Petals. Warne‚Äôs statue was unveiled at the MCG in December 2011, five years after he took his 700th Test wicket at the iconic venue.","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6076380/a4c9bec65cd5d0ce5a9667319bea4d85cbc93916-16x9-x0y285w5472h3078.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shane Warne‚Äôs family has requested a rethink on renaming MCG stand to honour cricket legend - PerthNow","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJ0aG5vdy5jb20uYXUvc3BvcnQvY3JpY2tldC9zaGFuZS13YXJuZXMtZmFtaWx5LWhhcy1yZXF1ZXN0ZWQtYS1yZXRoaW5rLW9uLXJlbmFtaW5nLW1jZy1zdGFuZC10by1ob25vdXItY3JpY2tldC1sZWdlbmQtLWMtNjA3NjM4MNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shane Warne‚Äôs family has requested a rethink on renaming MCG stand to honour cricket legend¬†¬†PerthNowShane Warne‚Äôs family wants tribute changed¬†¬†news.com.auEx-wife and children's heartbreaking act after Shane Warne tragedy¬†¬†Yahoo Sport AustraliaShane Warne‚Äôs children, ex-wife visit makeshift MCG memorial¬†¬†Sydney Morning HeraldShane Warne‚Äôs former wife Simone Callahan posts beautiful family tribute¬†¬†PerthNowView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-16 04:06:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Will Disney+ have mature content?

These shows include ‚ÄúDaredevil,‚Äù ‚ÄúJessica Jones,‚Äù ‚ÄúLuke Cage,‚Äù ‚ÄúIron Fist,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Defenders,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Punisher,‚Äù along with the TV-14 rated ‚ÄúMarvel‚Äôs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,‚Äù which originally premiered on ABC.The decision to add these shows is a first step for Disney+ in branching outside of its family-friendly material, though the streaming service already has mature content overseas.Disney+ has mostly remained family-friendly compared to other streaming apps, so this is quite a swerve for the company. But with the goal to expand its outreach, Disney+ is adding more mature content.The bigger question, though, is what it means for American family viewers in the future. One week. üí• #DisneyPlus pic.twitter.com/ll20yvslui‚Äî Disney+ (@disneyplus) March 9, 2022 To be fair, Disney+ has decided to add new parental controls to its platform due to the launch of these mature titles. All Disney+ users will be prompted to change their parental control settings once they open the app for the first time on or after March 16.Subscribers can make multiple changes, including adding a new PIN to their accounts to make it harder for children to find mature content. Families can also set new content settings so that only specific content will appear based on the rating. For example, families can keep the default settings, which will allow anything rated TV-14 and under to appear on the selection menus.‚ÄúDisney+ has served as the home for some of the most beloved brands in the industry, and the addition of these live-action shows brings more from the Marvel brand together, all in one place,‚Äù said¬†Michael Paull, president of Disney streaming, in a statement emailed to the press in early March. ‚ÄúWe have experienced great success with an expanded content offering on Disney+ across our global markets and are excited to continue that here in the U.S. as well by offering our consumers not only great content with the new Marvel additions, but also a set of features that help ensure a viewing experience most suitable for them and their family,‚Äù Paull added. Disney+ did not respond to Deseret News‚Äô request for comment on the parental control changes.Disney has had a history with R-rated movies in the past,¬†according to the Deseret News , as it has distributed rated-R films through the American film distribution label Touchstone Pictures since 1986.You could say the decision of Disney+ to add more mature content is years in the making. Disney‚Äôs multibillion-dollar purchase of 21st Century Fox in December 2017 first raised the question about Disney adding more mature superhero movies, since 21st Century Fox produced the ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù films. Deadpool is a popular superhero with proven box office success, so it would be an odd decision for Disney to drop the character altogether. But the ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù films are R-rated for mature language, graphic violence and adult content ‚Äî something that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has avoided.‚Äú(‚ÄòDeadpool‚Äô) clearly has been and will be Marvel branded. But we think there might be an opportunity for a Marvel-R brand for something like ‚ÄòDeadpool,‚Äô‚Äù then-Disney CEO Bob Iger said at the time. ‚ÄúAs long as we let the audiences know what‚Äôs coming, we think we can manage that fine.‚Äù Related Disney+ will update parental controls as it adds more Marvel live-action series Report: Disney executives arguing over adding mature content to family-friendly Disney+ Disney has removed 4 films from kid profiles due to stereotypes, negative depictions Parents Television Council says Disney Plus is good, but not great for families But the addition of the ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù films ‚Äî as well as the decision to merge Marvel Television with Marvel Studios, which led to the eventual addition of the mature Marvel shows to Disney+ ‚Äî has brought the process into a new light.Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios,¬†said at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour¬†in February 2021 that Marvel Studios will make a third ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù movie with an R-rating. He said R-rated projects will only happen if they make sense, as I wrote for the Deseret News, a sign that there would be limitations on R-rated content.And since all of the MCU movies make it onto Disney+, Feige‚Äôs comments appeared to be the first confirmation that Disney+ was dipping into mature content. This may have been months in the making, though. Disney executives have been reportedly arguing over whether to add new mature or adult-only content to Disney+ in recent months.A report from Puck News detailed that the former CEO Iger wants to keep Disney+ family-friendly, whereas Disney CEO Bob Chapek wants to add content beyond family-friendly to the streaming service in order to reach more audiences.Chapek has long said that Disney+ reaches all audiences, but that hasn‚Äôt been the case, as it lacks mature content. While Disney+ has a number of family-friendly intellectual property, it doesn‚Äôt match the level of adult content that Hulu, Netflix and HBO Max have, which prevents it from expanding.‚ÄúFor the service to grow beyond kids, fanboys, and Indian cricket lovers, it must become more of a general entertainment platform. It needs a little bit of Marvel, a little bit of Pixar, and a little bit of¬†‚ÄòOnly Murders in the Building,‚Äô‚Äù Puck News reported. But Iger ‚Äúinsisted on sticking to the narrow definition‚Äù of family-friendly, focusing on content for families instead of expanding it, a source told Puck News. Chapek ‚Äúintends to expand it,‚Äù the source said.Unnamed sources told Puck News that some Disney+ insiders felt that Chapek, who uses data to make decisions, does not have the right vision to make sure the transition happens correctly.‚ÄúNotice that Netflix spends insane amounts and makes a ton of crap. A handful of phenom hits in a giant pile of crud,‚Äù an unnamed source told Puck News.The Parents Television and Media Council released a¬†statement¬†that denounced Disney+‚Äôs decision to add more mature content, saying it could be considered ‚Äúoff brand.‚Äù‚ÄúFor more than 98 years, the Walt Disney Company has been synonymous with the words¬†‚ÄòFamily Friendly,‚Äô and I can think of no other corporation in American history that has been built more squarely on the backs ‚Äî and on the wallets ‚Äî of parents and families,‚Äù said Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television and Media Council, in a statement. ‚ÄúIt seems wildly ‚Äòoff-brand‚Äô for Disney+ to add TV-MA and R-rated programming to this platform, ostensibly to increase subscription revenue,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSo what comes next, adding live striptease performances in Fantasyland at Disney World?‚Äù All-new Parental Controls on #DisneyPlus keep you in charge of the action. ‚ú® pic.twitter.com/MeWm060MIl‚Äî Disney+ (@disneyplus) March 15, 2022 Winter said the council supports the addition of parental controls, but the mature content ‚Äúviolates the trust of families, and may well turn them off entirely.‚Äù‚ÄúThere is no need for Disney+ to compete with the explicit content on other streaming platforms,‚Äù Winter said. ‚ÄúDisney is already at a competitive advantage with a streaming platform that is the safest one out there for families. Its foray into TV-MA-rated fare will forever tarnish its family friendly crown.‚ÄùIt would appear that Chapek‚Äôs vision has won out, though. Not only is Disney+ adding more mature content with the addition of the Marvel shows, but some new content is being promoted as more violent.In a recent¬†interview with Empire, Feige said that the ‚ÄúMoon Knight‚Äù¬†series would be darker and more violent. And Disney+ did not make Marvel Studios hold back.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been fun to work with Disney+ and see the boundaries shifting on what we‚Äôre able to do,‚Äù¬†Feige said.¬†‚ÄúThere are moments when ‚ÄòMoon Knight‚Äô is wailing on another character, and it is loud and brutal, and the knee-jerk reaction is, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre gonna pull back on this, right?‚Äô No. We‚Äôre not pulling back. There‚Äôs a tonal shift. This is a different thing.‚Äù ‚ÄúMoon Knight‚Äù ‚Äî which premieres March 30 ‚Äî is only the beginning. The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems poised for a darker turn as the shadowy Black Knight was added into the MCU in ‚ÄúEternals,‚Äù as seen through Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington). There was also a brief teaser for the vampire-killing vampire Blade. The MCU is going darker. With ‚ÄúDeadpool‚Äù on the horizon as well ‚Äî and a potential future ‚ÄúDaredevil‚Äù project in the works ‚Äî it looks like Disney+ will continue to embrace a more mature audience. Or so you would think. Marvel may be leaning into the darkness, but Lucasfilm isn‚Äôt. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy¬†said in a new interview with¬†Entertainment Weekly that the original version of the upcoming Disney+ ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù series ‚ÄúObi-Wan Kenobi‚Äù¬†was too dark for audiences and production was halted in order for the script to be reworked.While some reports say the production was halted due to creative differences, Kennedy was adamant in her interview with¬†Entertainment Weekly¬†that the show wanted to provide a better ideal than darkness ‚Äî hope. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking, ultimately, to make a hopeful, uplifting story,‚Äù¬†Kennedy said.","pubDate":"2022-03-16 04:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"deseret","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League: List of Indian players in Dhaka Premier League 2022","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-dhaka-premier-division-cricket-league-list-of-indian-players-in-dhaka-premier-league-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","Dhaka Premier League","India"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Indian players in Dhaka Premier League 2022: A total of seven Indian players are participating in Dhaka Premier League 2022.

The hosts reached 192 for two at Stumps on Day 4, with Babar Azam remaining unbeaten after smashing a century. The Pakistan captain registered 102 runs off 198 balls and also slammed 12 fours. Australia declared their second innings on 97 for two, following the dismissal of Marnus Labuschagne on 44. First innings centurion Usman Khawaja remained unbeaten on 44. Australia's declaration came soon after the start of play on Day 4 in Karachi. ( LIVE SCORECARD ) We are back for the second innings! The Australian players make their way out to the middle. Pakistani bowlers finally get some rest and out comes their openers - Abdullah Shafique and Imam-ul-Haq. Mitchell Starc to steam in with the ball. A couple of slips and gully in place for the right-hander. Time for the first ball, here we go! ... SECOND INNINGS ... It's been a tough two days for Pakistan. They had to toil hard in the field to grab every wicket. They did come up with certain plans and tactics but not everything went their way. They grabbed an early wicket on Day 3 as well, but Pat Cummins played a fiery cameo and added salt to the wound, and notched up a healthy total. There were 7 bowlers used by Pakistan in this innings and all of them had to work really hard. We can see the pitch is still assisting the batters. Pakistan will be coming to bat high on confidence considering their batting performance in the previous game. Well, better late than never! Australia have finally declared! They won the toss and batted first and have done justice to that. It's been a scintillating batting performance from the visitors. Usman Khawaja and Steven Smith set the platform for Australia on Day 1 by scoring runs freely. Usman Khawaja carried on and notched up an exceptional 160 and then Alex Carey guided Australia over 500 with his gutsy knock of 93. They were other vital contributions as well, that eventually helped them to put a massive total of 556 on the board. But now it's time for them to come out and bowl. The pitch will be assisting the spinners just a tad, and Swepson and Nathon Lyon will play a key role in helping Australia grab some wickets. SIX! Tossed up, on middle and leg. Pat Cummins picks the bones of that one and slog-sweeps it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. And with that, enough is enough says Pat Cummins! An unbeaten 51-run stand between these two and Australia have declared at 556/9. Flighted ball, outside off. Mitchell Swepson Swepson drags it off the inner half to the leg side for a single. Loopy ball again, full, around off. Pat Cummins sweeps it towards mid-wicket for a single. FOUR! Top shot! Another loopy balll, full, around middle. Pat Cummins gets down on his knee and sweeps it between deep mid-wicket and deep square leg for a boundary. Quicker now, firing it on middle and leg. Pat Cummins defends it out. Tosses it up, around middle, fuller ball. Mitchell Swepson drags it with the inner half of his bat towards mid-wicket for one. On a length, around middle. Pat Cummins flicks it towards square leg. Shorter again, around off. Pat Cummins tries to cut this but he is cramped for room, the ball deflects off his gloves and lands short of the slip fielder. Another short ball, around middle. Mitchell Swepson swivels and pulls it towards fine leg for a single. Back of a length, outside off. Mitchell Swepson punches it off the back foot past cover-point for a brace. Another good-length delivery, outside off. Mitchell Swepson pushes it towards cover with the bottom half of the bat as the ball stayed low. Hasan Ali begins with a length ball, outside off. Pat Cummins guides it towards third man for a single. Tad shorter, around middle. Pat Cummins knocks it to long on for a single. Turning in, tad shorter, around middle.

STUMPS: Jharkhand 132/2 in 37 overs - lead by 723 runs. Chetan Bist‚Äôs determined unbeaten hundred was in vain as Jharkhand banked on its hardworking bowlers to restrict Nagaland for 289 and achieve its primary target of notching up the first innings lead on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy pre-quarterfinal match at the Eden Gardens here on Tuesday. Notwithstanding the size of the margin, the whopping 591-run lead ensured that Jharkhand ‚Äì which chose to bat again instead of enforcing follow-on and ended the day at 132 for two in its second essay ‚Äì would enter the quarterfinals in case the match is decided on the basis of first innings aggregates. AS IT HAPPENED | Ranji Trophy 2022 HIGHLIGHTS, pre-quarterfinal day 4: Jharkhand extends lead to 723 runs, Nagaland's Bist becomes top scorer The other probable outcome is an outright win for Jharkhand. Nagaland, resuming from 130 for four, lost two more wickets by the first drinks break. Left-arm seamer Sushant Mishra accounted for Abu Nechim (32, 62b, 5x4, 1x6), who added 53 with Bist, and Imliwati Lemtur (4) by employing the rising deliveries in consecutive overs. Hokaito Zhimomi, who retired hurt on five on the previous day, and Bist resisted for an hour before the former hit Anukul Roy to mid-wicket. Bist (122 not out, 253b, 13x4, 1x6), who was behind the stumps for more than 203 overs, showed character to stay put for most part of Nagaland's first essay despite exhaustion. The 32-year-old played some fine shots, especially on the square of the wicket on both sides, as he forged handy partnerships worth 45 and 35 with tail-enders Raja Swarnkar (17) and Khrivitso Kense (13) respectively. READ | Manprit Juneja retires from all forms of cricket Bist achieved his fifth hundred of the season and third in successive innings. Shahbaz Nadeem bowled 36.3 overs tightly on a flat pitch to pick up three wickets, while Mishra and Anukul claimed two apiece. Opener Utkarsh Singh scored a half-century (50 not out, 106b, 6x4) as Jharkhand let its batters have some practice in the middle. The left-hander associated with Nazim Siddiqui (42, 48b, 6x4) and Kumar Suraj (31, 42b, 3x4) to collect 63 and 46 respectively. Jharkhand led by 723 runs with a day left in the match. - Y.B.

The bulk of the Australian white-ball team members are to arrive in Lahore on March 24. ‚ÄúWe have finalised a contingency plan which will be in operation from March 20. If there is a marked change in the volatile political situation in Islamabad, we would stay with our original schedule and that is to organise all white-ball matches (from March 29-April 5) including three One-Dayers and one-off T20 at the Pindi Stadium. Otherwise, these matches will be shifted to Lahore. ‚ÄúThe growing possibility at this point of time is that all the limited-overs matches will be staged in Lahore as the political tension is increasing by each passing day in and around Islamabad.‚Äù The official added that safety and security of the teams and accompanied officials would be the top priority. ‚ÄúWe cannot take even one percent risk when it comes to the safety and security of the both teams. Though the rooms booking at a leading hotel in Islamabad is intact, there is a growing possibility that the matches will now be held at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on the same dates. The hotel where teams stayed for the first Test and would be staying for limited-overs matches falls within the red-zone where political parties are planning all these activities. So, no change in political situation in Islamabad by March 20 means all the four limited-overs matches will be shifted to Lahore.‚Äù When asked whether the PCB has taken Cricket Australia (CA) in confidence on the possible change in the venue, the official said that no such move has so far been made. ‚ÄúThere is no need to talk to CA on the possible change in the venue. Since the safety and security of both the teams is the main concern so we don‚Äôt think any side would have any objection. The matter is related to political tension in and around the capital, the PCB is adamant to take the most appropriate decision. The CA will be intimated once things get clearer.‚Äù Meanwhile, when ‚ÄòThe News‚Äô checked with the hotel administration in Islamabad, they confirmed that both the teams are booked with them starting from March 26 and there is no change as yet.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PCB plans to rename Gaddafi Stadium","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/941879-pcb-plans-to-rename-gaddafi-stadium","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board is in negotiation with a number of sponsor companies to rename Lahore‚Äôs Gaddafi Stadium for financial reasons, nearly 50 years after it was named after former Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi.PCB chairman Ramiz Raja was quoted as saying that the cricket...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-16 01:00:00","full_description":"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is in negotiation with a number of sponsor companies to rename Lahore‚Äôs Gaddafi Stadium for financial reasons, nearly 50 years after it was named after former Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ PCB chairman Ramiz Raja was quoted as saying that the cricket board was in ‚Äúadvanced negotiations‚Äù with a number of sponsors. The highest bidder would win the right to have the stadium renamed after it. There have been a number of attempts in the past to change the name of the iconic stadium ‚Äî suspected for ‚Äòpolitical reasons‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis [change of name] is purely financial,‚Äù Ramiz told the publication, adding that other stadiums in the country, including the National Stadium Karachi, could well be renamed too. ‚ÄúWe acquired the services of YouGov to estimate the brand worth of our stadiums, and how much sponsorship deals would be worth,‚Äù Ramiz said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not just true of the Gaddafi Stadium, but also the NSK and others. We‚Äôve been working towards this for a while, and the response from sponsors has been satisfactory. Once we finalise a deal [for Lahore], the name Gaddafi will go completely, with a sponsor‚Äôs name replacing it.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth noting that when the stadium was built in 1959, it was initially called Lahore Stadium. However, on his 1974 visit to Lahore, Gaddafi delivered a statement at the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) in support of Pakistan‚Äôs right to seek nuclear weapons. It prompted Pakistan‚Äôs then-prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, to name the country‚Äôs premier cricket stadium after the Libyan leader.","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ruthless favourites Australia crush WI at World Cup","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/941882-ruthless-favourites-australia-crush-wi-at-world-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WELLINGTON: Australia routed the West Indies by seven wickets in Wellington Tuesday to maintain their perfect record at the Women‚Äôs Cricket World Cup.The tournament‚Äôs red-hot favourites produced another ruthless display to race to a 4-0 winning record at the one-day showcase,...","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-16 01:00:00","full_description":"WELLINGTON: Australia routed the West Indies by seven wickets in Wellington Tuesday to maintain their perfect record at the Women‚Äôs Cricket World Cup. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ The tournament‚Äôs red-hot favourites produced another ruthless display to race to a 4-0 winning record at the one-day showcase, highlighted by an unbeaten 83 from Rachael Haynes. The win puts the six-time champions at the top of the standings with a healthy run rate, virtually guaranteeing a semi-final spot. The West Indies have won two of their four matches and remain in with a chance of making the top four in the round-robin standings. The West Indies won the toss and elected to bat but were stunned when Ellyse Perry took two wickets in successive balls to leave them at 4-2. ‚ÄúEarly wickets up front made a difference in the game that really out us in front and put them under pressure,‚Äù Australian captain Meg Lanning said. Perry clean bowled Hayley Matthews for duck then coaxed an edge off the first ball faced by Kycia Knight. It could have been worse but Deandra Dottin and Staphanie Taylor were both given reprieves by the third umpire. West Indies skipper Taylor made the most of her chance by battling on to 50 but could not find any support with Shemaine Campbelle the next highest score on 20. Perry finished on 3-22 and Ashleigh Gardner took 3-25 as the West Indies were skittled for 131 in 45.5 overs. The paltry total was never going to be enough against the strongest batting line-up in women‚Äôs cricket, but the West Indies did well to make Australia work for 30.2 overs to reach the 132-run target. Taylor said the West Indies needed a total of about 250 to defend but she was heartened by a solid bowling display and optimistic about her side‚Äôs chances of advancing. ‚ÄúWe still have three more (pool) games to go, that‚Äôs a lot of cricket,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe just have to go back to the drawing board and regroup.‚Äù","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Aussies continue to shine in World Cup","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/aussies-continue-to-shine-in-world-cup/video/9175df9cbd5628995181c086a15d0264","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Jess Jonassen joined Fox Sports for a chat as the Aussies look to continue their unbeaten run in the World Cup.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-15 21:36:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Mooney collision in missed run out!","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/mooney-collision-in-missed-run-out/video/8cac20bc3e1d2a45dadced587ce4d8e8","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Beth Mooney survived a run out but collided in dramatic fashion with the West Indies' Shemaine Campbelle.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-15 21:36:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan make a stand on Day 4","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/pakistan-make-a-stand-on-day-4/video/ec568bfb45f1985193686798ad624191","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Despite a tricky pitch, Pakistan and Babar Azam delivered on Day 4, with Azam bringing up a century.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-15 20:45:20","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Pakistan savages Smith in four-word tweet","link":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/pakistan-cruelly-mocks-steve-smith-for-butterfingered-performance/news-story/a12ebdaa38b7c744cb7c374db2ebb4b6","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Steve Smith‚Äôs Midas touch deserted him in the field as the Aussie cricket star dropped three catches during the second Test against Pakistan ‚Äî and was cruelly mocked for them by the opposition.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-03-15 20:00:00","full_description":"Steve Smith‚Äôs Midas touch deserted him in the field as the Aussie cricket star dropped three catches during the second Test against Pakistan ‚Äî and was cruelly mocked for them by the opposition.
