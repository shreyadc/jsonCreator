It was immediately apparent that they'd found something special in the 23-year-old, who walked off the Galle ground with figures of 5-34.He returns to that same ground in 2022 with 427 Test wickets to his name, third only to Warne (708 wickets) and Glenn McGrath (563) in Australian history.His former spin partner, Steve O'Keefe, told Wide World of Sports that Lyon's talent was immediately obvious.\"I was there in 2011 when he played in an Australian A side in Zimbabwe, just before he got picked in the Test side,\" he said.\"He was light years ahead of any spinner on the ground, and he took bags of wickets.\"He had this bounce and spin that was something I'd never seen before, and great control, and then he got rushed into the Test squad.\"Lyon finished with six wickets in Australia's 125 run victory in Galle, and when he marked his home debut later that year with another seven wickets, it was apparent Australia had found a worthy successor to Warne.\"It actually wasn't a surprise, because I'd never seen a more beautiful off-spinner,\" O'Keefe said.\"I'd always admired Jason Krejza as an off-spinner, and he and 'Gaz' are quite similar at their best. You've never seen a ball leave the hand so nicely.\"It doesn't surprise me that he's done so well. It doesn't surprise me Gaz has 400-plus Test wickets, and it wouldn't surprise me if he finishes with more than 600.\"O'Keefe noted that much of Lyon's initial success in Test cricket could be credited to one man.\"I think he was really well managed early on by Michael Clarke as captain, and that paved the way for Nathan to settle into Test cricket, and go on and have continued success,\" he said.\"It's not easy as a spinner, especially in Australia, you only have to look at how Jack Leach was mauled in the Ashes, he was treated with disdain.\"A lot of it can be mental, you need a good captain, you need good support around you, and I think Michael Clarke provided exactly that. Now when you speak to Gaz, he's full of confidence in his own game.\"He's stayed the test of time, he's as fit and durable as any cricketer I know. I can't really remember him missing a Test, or even a state game with injury. That in itself is remarkable.\"It's a mark of Lyon's durability and success that since his debut his 427 wickets almost totally overshadows any other Australian spinner. O'Keefe's 35 wickets is the next best in that time frame, with part-timers Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Michael Clarke the only others with 10 or more.Lyon hasn't quite been a one-man band, but it's fair to say he's been a significant factor in any Australian success over the last decade, as he will be in the two Tests against Sri Lanka.\"The last time I bowled with him was a Test in Bangladesh in 2017, and that was one of the more special bowling performances I've seen,\" O'Keefe explained.\"It showed me he's now figured out how to bowl in those conditions.\"This is a big series for him, to put all those pieces together that he's learned over the years, I'm really excited to see what this series holds for him.\"For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!","pubDate":"2022-06-29 02:49:26","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/06/438870/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WA veteran Shaun Marsh to ‘step aside’ from white-ball domestic cricket to give next generation a go","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/wa-veteran-shaun-marsh-to-step-aside-from-white-ball-domestic-cricket-to-give-next-generation-a-go-c-7337300","keywords":null,"creator":["Jordan McArdle"],"video_url":null,"description":"WA veteran Shaun Marsh will continue on for a 22nd domestic season but revealed plans to “step aside” from white-ball domestic cricket to give the next generation more of a go.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-29 02:22:02","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-7337300/d009ed3023d26b5a0c792c241aaed0881ab32b64-16x9-x332y118w1513h851.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs England: India are undercooked for Edgbaston Test, says Moeen Ali - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS1pbi1lbmdsYW5kL2luZGlhLXZzLWVuZ2xhbmQtaW5kaWEtYXJlLXVuZGVyY29va2VkLWZvci1lZGdiYXN0b24tdGVzdC1zYXlzLW1vZWVuLWFsaS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjUzMTk1NC5jbXPSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs England: India are undercooked for Edgbaston Test, says Moeen Ali  Times of IndiaI would give the captaincy to Virat Kohli: Moeen Ali backs Kohli to don Test cap for one last time vs England  India TodayIND vs ENG Edgbaston Test: Moeen Ali makes fun of India's chances: Check OUT  InsideSportMoeen backs two spinners on his home turf Edgbaston  Hindustan TimesMoeen Ali Feels Jos Buttler And Liam Livingstone Would Thrive In England Test Team Under Brendon McCullum  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-29 02:19:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SL vs AUS Dream11 Team Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s SL vs AUS 1st Test at Galle International Stadium, Galle, 10 AM IST June 29-July 3","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/sl-vs-aus-dream11-team-prediction-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-sl-vs-aus-1st-test-at-galle-international-stadium-galle-10-am-ist-june-29-july-3-2479253.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka vs Australia Dream11 Team Prediction Sri Lanka vs Australia 1st Test - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of SL vs AUS, Sri Lanka Dream11 Team Player List, Australia Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.","content":"After an unexpected 3-0 series defeat on the previous tour of Sri Lanka six years ago, Australia expects to bat much better on spin-friendly pitches in the two-test series in Galle starting on Wednesday (June 29). Australia has found playing on Asia’s turning pitches hard in the past but has done well recently, beating Pakistan 1-0 in a three-match series in March. Of more significance, Sri Lanka's spin attack doesn't have the experience and variety of the retired Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera, whose combined 43 wickets caused Australia's downfall in the 2016 series. “In a lot of ways it will be quite different,” Australia captain Pat Cummins said in comparing the conditions in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. “(Pakistan) was subcontinent but it wasn’t big turn. There was so much we did well over there. We controlled the tempo of the match. In some ways it will be a bigger challenge (in Sri Lanka) when it quickens up faster than Pakistan.” Sri Lanka can field left-arm spinners Lasith Embuldeniya and Praveen Jayawickrama and offspinner Ramesh Mendis. Also in the squad is legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay, uncapped in tests. The first three have played only 27 tests combined, but Sri Lanka will be encouraged by how well the spinners performed in the one-day international series it won 3-2. Sri Lanka’s seam bowlers have been better than the spinners: Asitha Fernando and Kasun Rajitha carried the team to victory in the recent two-test series in Bangladesh.

Try 14-Days Free Now > Sri Lanka v Australia 5th ODI Highlights | 06:47 The ICC number one ranked Aussies will be looking to continue their recent success in the five-day format, having comprehensively beaten arch rivals England 4-0 at home in the recent Ashes series before completing a historic 1-0 series victory in Pakistan in March. The only possible change from the line-up that played in Australia’s most recent Test match against Pakistan is Glenn Maxwell, who could make his long awaited Test return at number five in the opening Test, should Travis Head succumb to an injury niggle. Sri Lanka is predicted to stick with the same starting XI that secured them a 1-0 away series victory with an emphatic 10-wicket win in the second test against Bangladesh last month. Australia is oozing with quality, having the top ranked Test bowler in captain Pat Cummins, as well as the second, third and seventh-ranked Test batters in Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja respectively. Reports have indicated that the hosts are preparing an low and slow pitch in an attempt to unsettle the Australian batting line-up, who aren’t as familiar with the spin-friendly conditions expected to greet them at Galle International Stadium across the two-Test series. In a further blow to the visitors’ chances of victory, it is rumoured that the ground’s curators have heavily watered the square surrounding the centre pitch as a means of negating Australia’s ability to create reverse swing with the older ball, a tactic which was key to their recent series victory over Pakistan. Australia will be hoping their experience and a clear advantage in talent on paper will be enough to get them across the line in what shapes an intriguing series battle.

KODIKARA / AFP) Source: AFP FOX CRICKET’S EXPERT TIPS Mark Waugh Series result: 1-1 Why: I anticipate a very tight series with Australia man for man having the stronger team, but Sri Lanka will be very competitive given the likelihood of slow/low spinning conditions in Galle, which should suit them. Most runs: Uzzie Most wickets: Lyon Player of the series: Lyon Adam Gilchrist Series result: 1-0 Australia Why: While I expect it will be spinning wickets, the quality of Australia’s quicks will still shine through, particularly with reverse swing. Most runs: Usman Most wickets: Cummins Player of the series: Usman Michael Hussey Series: 1-0 Australia Why: I think it will be a tough series, Australia has a well balanced team with good continuity as this group has been together for a number of years now with only the odd change here or there. Sri Lanka obviously has an advantage of knowing the home conditions well, they have some good experienced players but also seem to be injecting some talented younger players. Australia looks to have the superior team on paper and I think the experienced gained from previous tours to SL will hold many of the players in good stead for this series. Lastly, the players who have been part of the white ball set-up should be well acclimatised to the conditions in SL and will hopefully hit the ground running.

Mitchell Swepson PLAYERS TO WATCH Usman Khawaja (Australia) – Khawaja has always being considered an extremely talented Test batsman since long before he made his international debut in the 2011 Ashes series. However, the knock on Khawaja has always been that his batting average away from home (39.21) is a significant drop off from his average on Australian soil (55.50). After a two and a half year hiatus from the Australian team that had some questioning whether his international Test career was over, he has reignited his international career with four centuries in his last nine innings, along with another two scores in the 90s, to boast an astonishing average of 125.17 since returning as an opening batsman for the third Ashes Test in January. The classy left hander has also looked to have finally turned a corner in foreign conditions, having just scored 496 runs to lead Australia to a historic 1-0 Test series win in Pakistan, earning himself player of the series honours. Australia will be looking to him to continue his sparkling form and reverse his previous poor record against Sri Lanka, where he averages a meagre 28.37 from 10 innings. Glenn Maxwell (Australia) – Maxwell is expected to complete a stunning return from five years in international Test cricket wilderness when the final Australian team for the opening Test is confirmed later today. The explosive all-rounder has been a mainstay in the Aussie white ball line-up, but has not donned the baggy green since the 2017 tour of Bangladesh. With incumbent number five batter and part-time spin bowler Travis Head injuring his hamstring in the fourth ODI, the enigmatic Maxwell was parachuted into the Test squad and is on the verge of completing a remarkable red ball comeback if Head, as predicted, fails to recover from his injury in time for today’s first Test match. The supremely talented Maxwell is regarded as one of Australia’s best players of spin bowling and he will be hoping to improve his Test batting average of 26.07 and use this opportunity in the subcontinent as a springboard to becoming a key cog in Australia’s Test line-up moving forward. Steve Smith (Australia) – Smith finds himself in a precarious position heading into the series against Sri Lanka. The former captain is no longer considered the consensus world’s best Test batsman, or even the best batsman in the Australian team, as evidenced by both Joe Root and Marnus Labuschagne having leapfrogged him in the ICC Men’s Test Batting Rankings. While Smith still boasts the best Australian Test batting average (59.77) since the immortal Don Bradman (99.94), he has developed a recent inability to covert starts into centuries, having only reached triple figures once since his triumphant return to cricket in the 2019 Ashes series (where he scored two hundreds and a double century in seven innings). The usually unflappable right hander will be hoping to use this series against Sri Lanka (who he has a career average of 41.16 against) to rediscover his best form and work towards reclaiming his crown as the best Test batsman on the planet. Nathan Lyon (Australia) – Lyon is Australia’s most successful Test offspinner of all time and could arguably be considered the most important player in the series. The man nicknamed GOAT holds a career bowling average of 32.15 (33.58 in Sri Lanka) at a miserly economy rate of 2.94 (3.23 in Sri Lanka). Lyon will be hoping to continue his excellent record in Sri Lanka, having taken 24 wickets in just six matches, including a best bowling inning figure of 5/34. With low and slow pitches predicted for the two Test matches at Galle International Stadium, the outcome of the series could rest on Lyon’s ability to build pressure by tying up an end and taking wickets. Lyon relives Test call up in Sri Lanka | 03:10 Dimuth Karunaratne (Sri Lanka) – Karunaratne is the sixth-ranked Test batsman in the world according to the ICC rankings and a key pillar of the Sri Lankan batting line-up. The Australian’s, and in particular Mitch Starc, will be hoping to target the opposing captain early in the series as his wicket shapes as a crucial one. The left-handed opener boasts a 39.77 career Test batting average (49.67 at home), however, has struggled against Australia in the past with an average of only 17.18 in 8 previous encounters. If seventh-ranked Sri Lanka is to upset the number one ranked Men’s Test team, Australia, then they will likely need a big series from their captain with the bat. Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka) – Mathews is coming of a player of the series performance in Sri Lanka’s 1-0 away Test series victory over Bangladesh last month, where he averaged a ridiculous 114.67 across three innings. With a career batting average of 45.78 (40.06 v Australia), the experienced batting all-rounder is ranked number 15 in the laTest ICC Men’s Test Batting Rankings and is likely the key wicket in the Sri Lankan batting line-up if Australia hopes to secure an away Test series victory. Sri Lanka’s bowlers (Sri Lanka) – The unheralded Sri Lankan bowling unit does not contain a single player in the top 30 of the ICC Men’s Test Bowling Rankings, largely due to the fact the predicted four bowlers who will be selected for the opening Test have only played a combined 27 international Test matches. Despite their relative inexperience, Ramesh Mendis, Jayawickrama, Asitha Fernando and Rajitha have all shown promising signs to start their international Test careers taking a collective 105 wickets, with the highest bowling average among them being all-rounder Mendis’ 27.85. With low and slow pitches predicted to favour the home team, given Australia’s batting history of struggling in spin-friendly conditions, the Sri Lankan bowling unit will be the key to their team’s chances of claiming an unlikely series victory.

Cap de serie Iga Swiatek a devenit prima jucătoare feminină a secolului 21 care a câștigat 36 de meciuri consecutive, după ce a învins-o pe croatul Jana Fett pe terenul central. Ultima actualizare: 29.06.22 01:11 Serena Williams a văzut-o pe Harmony Tan terminându-și visele la Wimbledon Serena Williams nu a putut invoca magie veche, deoarece întoarcerea ei la Wimbledon s-a încheiat cu o înfrângere în primul tur în fața necunoscutei franceze Harmony Tan pe terenul central. Williams a ieșit pe teren pentru a juca simplu pentru prima dată de când a părăsit prima scenă și în lacrimi după ce s-a rănit la coapsă în prima rundă în urmă cu 12 luni, Williams a fost ruginit și predispus la erori. Voința a rămas și, cu încurajarea mulțimii suportătoare, a părut că s-ar putea împiedica până la linia de sosire după ce a venit dintr-un grup și apoi a ținut punctul de meci în al doisprezecelea joc al clasei. În schimb, Williams a suferit doar a treia ei înfrângere din primul tur într-un turneu major, pierzând cu 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (10-7) în play-off de la ora 22.35 după trei ore și 10 minute. La 40 de ani, americanca rămâne fără timp în joc, dar a rămas vagă cu privire la planurile ei de viitor și a refuzat să excludă o altă șansă la Wimbledon de anul viitor. „Așa cum am spus să intru în asta, doar plănuiesc acum, să văd ce simt, doar să plec de acolo”, a spus ea. Presiată dacă a fost adio ei de la All England Club, Williams a adăugat: „Aceasta este o întrebare la care nu pot răspunde. Nu știu. Cine știe? Cine știe unde voi apărea”. Williams și-a revenit dintr-un început foarte șubrede pentru a lua conducerea cu 4-2 în primul set, dar 21 de faulturi neintenționate i-au dovedit căderea. Ea s-a liniștit după o scurtă pauză pentru a închide acoperișul, a câștigat confortabil setul al doilea și a părut că ar putea găsi o cale către succes în timp ce a avansat cu 3-1 în decisiv. Dar nu a existat nicio certitudine despre Williams aici și ea nu a reușit să-și valorifice avantajul de 4-0 în tiebreak, întrucât Tan a sărbătorit cel mai bun moment al carierei ei. „Cred că m-am descurcat foarte bine”, a spus Williams. „Cred că ultimele două puncte, chiar mă chinuiau acolo. „Dar simt că doar în acele puncte cheie, câștigarea unora dintre acele puncte, este întotdeauna ceva de care aveți nevoie mental. M-am descurcat foarte bine poate în unul sau două dintre ele, dar în mod clar nu este suficient.” Williams indică că va juca la US Open Când a fost întrebată dacă ar fi mulțumită de pierderea de marți ca ultima ei amintire de la Wimbledon, ea a spus: „Desigur că nu. Mă cunoști. Absolut nu. „Dar astăzi am făcut tot ce puteam. Poate că aș fi putut face mai mult mâine. Poate că aș fi putut face mai multe în urmă cu o săptămână. Dar azi era ceea ce aș putea face. La un moment dat, ar trebui să fii în stare să fii în regulă cu asta. ” Iga Swiatek a devenit prima jucătoare a secolului 21 care a câștigat 36 de meciuri consecutive numarul 1 mondial Iga Swiatek Ea a intrat cu stil în cartea recordurilor, când a câștigat al 36-lea meci consecutiv, învingând-o pe Jana Veet pe terenul central. Singa impresionantă a lui Swiatek, care datează din februarie și a câștigat șase campionate, înseamnă că este cea mai lungă serie de victorii din secolul 21, depășind recordul lui Venus Willams stabilit în 2000. De două ori campioană la French Open, favorită la titlu, s-a bucurat de râvnitul loc de deschidere de pe terenul central, rezervat de obicei campionului în curs, și a învins-o pe Croația Wit cu 6-0, 6-3. Retragerea campioanei în curs, Ashleigh Barty, a însemnat că Swiatek a primit onoarea de a juca jocul de deschidere pe terenul principal de spectacol și de a privi complet acasă, oferindu-i adversarului ei o coacere de 33 de minute. A fost primul joc al polonezilor de când i-au învins pe Roland Garros și Witt, care se antrenau la o încălzire pe iarbă, și amenințau că revin pentru a avansa cu 3-1 în setul doi. Ea a avut trei puncte de break pentru a face 4-1, dar Swatik a alunecat și asta a fost sfârșitul, deoarece poloneza a zguduit rapid cinci jocuri la rând pentru a-și continua stria indomabilă.

But the 35-year-old batsman has been struggling with form and fitness issues this year. Dublin-born Morgan was twice out for nought during the recent ODI series in the Netherlands and withdrew from the third game with a groin issue. Morgan is England’s all-time leading run-scorer in ODI and T20 cricket with 6,957 and 2,458 runs respectively. His tally of 225 ODI appearances and 115 in T20Is are also England records. But Morgan, who will continue his domestic career, had made just two fifties from his past 28 international innings across the two white-ball formats, a dip that helped convince him to retire. “After careful deliberation and consideration, I am here (Lord’s) to announce my retirement from international cricket with immediate effect,” said Morgan in an ECB statement. “To call time on what has been without doubt the most enjoyable and rewarding chapter of my career hasn’t been an easy decision. “But I believe now is the right time to do so, both for me, personally, and for both England white-ball sides I have led to this point.” Morgan, who thanked his family and his team-mates for their support, added: “I am hugely proud of what I have achieved as a player and captain, but the things I will cherish and remember the most are the memories I made with some of the greatest people I know along the way.” Morgan began his international career with his native Ireland in 2006 but switched his allegiance to England in 2009. He is the only England player to have won both limited-overs World Cups, having helped Paul Collingwood’s side triumph in the 2010 T20 version in the Caribbean. Rob Key, the managing director of England men’s cricket, added: “It will be wrong to think Eoin’s legacy was just winning the World Cup in 2019; it is far greater than that. “As with all great players and leaders, he has changed the way the game has been played, and he has changed the way an entire generation and generations to come will play this form of the game. “His legacy within the game will be felt for many years to come. He is, without question, the best leader I have seen. I wish him well in the next chapter of his career.” Morgan took inspiration for England’s white-ball revolution from the way New Zealand, with captain Brendon McCullum hitting 77 from only 25 balls, thrashed his side at the 2015 World Cup.","pubDate":"2022-06-29 01:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenews","country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australian domestic cricket fixtures: Beth Mooney debut to kickstart WA’s summer as normality returns","link":"https://thewest.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-domestic-cricket-fixtures-beth-mooney-debut-to-kickstart-was-summer-as-normality-returns-c-7329311","keywords":null,"creator":["Jordan McArdle"],"video_url":null,"description":"WA’s cricket-starved fans will be treated to their most home games since before COVID when normality resumes next summer.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 21:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-7329311/5c19e71265f3a474d32de99f696c5c6e08fc4e30-16x9-x705y162w1302h732.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Deepak Hooda owned his series”: Aakash Chopra heaps praises on Deepak Hooda for smashing his maiden T20I century vs Ireland in Dublin","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-deepak-hooda-owned-his-series-aakash-chopra-heaps-praises-on-deepak-hooda-for-smashing-his-maiden-t20i-century-vs-ireland-in-dublin/","keywords":["Cricket","Aakash Chopra","Deepak Hooda","India tour of Ireland 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Aakash Chopra heaps praises on Deepak Hooda after he received the ‘Player of the series’ award for a spectacular show against Ireland.

During the second and final T20I of the ongoing India’s tour of Ireland at The Village Cricket ground in Malahide, Dublin, team India prevailed by 4 runs despite a gritty, spirited chase by the Irish batters en route the stiff target of 226. The experienced batting duo of Paul Stirling (40 off 18) and Andrew Balbirnie (60 off 37) gave Ireland an ideal start with a 72-run partnership in mere 5.4 Overs for the first wicket. A couple of handy partnerships – 47 (21) and 32 (18) for the fifth and sixth wickets respectively right till the end of the chase involving George Dockrell (34* off 16), Harry Tector (39 off 28), and Mark Adair (23* off 12), gave a relatively stronger Indian side a proper run for their money before they leave the Ireland shores. As for India, they were all over the Irish bowlers like a rash, posting a mammoth score of 225/7 in their 20 Overs. A 176-run partnership off 87 deliveries for the second wicket between Deepak Hooda (104 off 57) and Sanju Samson (77 off 42) – highest ever for India in the format history, paved way for the series clinching victory later. Hooda went on to become only the fourth Indian to smash a T20I century, reaching the landmark moment while facing his 55th delivery of the night. Having scored a match-winning 47*(29) while opening the batting during the first T20I, the 27-year-old smashed his century tonight while batting at no.3, and fittingly was awarded with the ‘Player of the series’ accolade. Former India batter turned commentator seemed to be highly impressed by Hood’s clinical form with the bat, and took to his social media handle to not only praise him, but also make a case for the selectors, who might scratch their heads to find a way out for him in the squad alongside the senior players during the T20 World Cup this year. Deepak Hooda owned this series. Totally. And he happens to be the man who’s not got enough chances…but how do you accommodate him when the senior guys are back?

Vaughan , 47, was charged earlier this month and his continued place on Test Match Special has been met with huge opposition. In a statement, Vaughan said: \"On numerous occasions, I have put on record my views on the issues concerning YCCC. \"It is always regrettable when commentary on matters off the field take the focus away from what’s happening on the field. \"In view of the ongoing dialogue on the subject, I have taken the decision to step back from my work with the BBC for the time being. \"The key driver for this is my concern for the wellbeing of my family members and my wish to protect their family life. \"Stepping back temporarily is also in the interests of the game and I hope that it will minimise any difficulties for my work colleagues.\" The BBC responded: \"Following conversations with Michael Vaughan we’ve accepted his decision to step away from our cricket coverage. \"This is a decision we respect and understand. \"Michael remains under contract to the BBC.\" Vaughan and three other ex-England players have been charged with bringing cricket into disrepute over racism allegations. Ashes-winning captain Vaughan , bowler Matthew Hoggard, batsman Gary Ballance and all-rounder Tim Bresnan are accused of racist and discriminatory language. Ex-Yorkshire skipper Andrew Gale is believed to be among a total of seven individuals charged. The charges come after former Yorkshire all-rounder Azeem Rafiq went public with claims that he was racially abused at the county. Hoggard denies the claims, Bresnan has denied using racist language towards Rafiq, while Ballance admitted calling Rafiq a “P***” but claimed it was “banter” with his one-time best friend. The cases will be heard by the Cricket Disciplinary Committee, which works separately from the ECB, in either September or October — although this could be delayed because of legal wrangling. Vaughan and other players plan to fight the charges and will have a chance to put their sides of the story under cross-examination. Ballance is the only player still on the staff at Yorkshire, although he has not played this season. Rafiq, who provided a witness statement to the ECB, said: “I welcome the announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly. “This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. “It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences — but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again.”","pubDate":"2022-06-28 20:54:42","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-Vaughan steps down from commentary role amid Yorkshire racism allegations","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/06/29/cricket-vaughan-steps-down-from-commentary-role-amid-yorkshire-racism-allegations","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - Michael Vaughan has temporarily stepped down from commentary duties with the BBC, the former England captain said on Tuesday after he was embroiled in the racism controversy involving former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq.

VEDHAN Australian fast bowling great Glenn McGrath described former teammate and late leg-spinner Shane Warne as the “ultimate competitor.” Warne, one of cricket’s all-time greats, died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 52 in Thailand in March. “It has been a pretty tough year. We got through two years of COVID-19, and then I lost three really close friends... Rod Marsh, Warnie and Symonds. It has been tough,” McGrath said during a panel discussion on Role of High-Performance Centres in Achieving Excellence in Sports at Sportstar’s South Sports Conclave here. The session was moderated by The Hindu’s Sports Editor K.C. Vijaya Kumar. “Warnie was one of the most amazing guys I’ve ever met. He was a normal bloke like the rest of us, but lived an extraordinary life. Off the field, he got himself into a little bit of trouble. But on the field, he was the ultimate competitor. He loved the challenge that you got from bowling to the best batters. Off the field, he loved poker as well because it was a one-on-one battle.” Warne, who was named one of Wisden’s Five Cricketers of the Century, claimed 708 Test wickets in a 15-year career for Australia between 1992 and 2007 and was also an ODI World Cup winner in 1999. McGrath also recalled an interesting anecdote from the fourth Test against England in Melbourne in 2006. “I remember we had just announced our retirements after the 2006-07 series. It was a multi-day Test at the MCG,” McGrath said. “That was Shane’s home ground. Capacity crowd. 95000 people. Warnie was on 699 Test wickets. He was bowling to Andrew Strauss, the England captain. I remember fielding at mid-on, and he came over to me and said, “I am just going to keep it tight for an over or so. Then next over, I am going to toss one up. Strauss is going to slog sweep, and I will bowl him through the gate.” I said, “Seems like a pretty good plan to me, Shane.” “Warnie just knew the game so well. And so, he set Strauss up. I don’t know if Straussie was listening to us, but he didn’t try to slog sweep. He tried to whip it over midwicket. And the ball dropped, turned, and Warne bowled him through the gate. He was running around. The crowd went up in celebration. 700 Test wickets.” Absolutely incredible. But that was Shaney. He could execute what he wanted. An amazing guy to have at the other end. I want to thank him for a few of my wickets. He always said he would thank me for one or two of his wickets. To lose him at such a young age of 52... it has been a pretty horrible year.” Warne was publicly farewelled at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, home to many of his greatest sports moments, on March 30. “Anybody who saw the memorial for him at the MCG, I think that changed a lot of people’s minds,” McGrath said. “They didn’t realise what he did behind the scenes. But it wasn’t publicised what he gave back to the community. The humility that he had was, to me, a true character of a great person. I have still not come to terms with it.” McGrath recalled Sachin Tendulkar’s controversial “shoulder before wicket” dismissal at the Adelaide Oval in December 1999. “Trying to remember that one (chuckles),” McGrath said. The ball landed on the middle of the pitch, and Tendulkar, thinking it was a bouncer, ducked side-on, getting really low in front of the stumps. But the ball did not rise enough and thudded into Tendulkar’s left arm below the armpit. McGrath appealed and umpire Daryl Harper gave Tendulkar out. “I have had a few chats with Sachin about this one. It was an attempted bouncer that didn’t bounce, and he went to duck under it. Sachin is not very tall. So, when he ducked it hit him on the shoulder. But from where I was looking, I could see the stumps. I could see the bails over the top, and I thought that was out. If he was standing normally, it would have hit him on the pad. So, I still think that was out. Sachin still thinks it was going over the stumps by a good foot.” Australia won the Test by 285 runs. Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun revealed how Mohammed Shami emerged as one of India’s top fast bowlers. Shami was coming off a stellar Test series in South Africa in 2018, where he was India’s highest wicket-taker with 15 wickets in three matches. at an average of 17.06. His five for 28 in the second innings of the third and final Test helped India script a historic 63-run win over the Proteas. However, after failing the fitness test, After a stellar series in South Africa in 2018, Shami failed a fitness test and was left out of the one-off Test against Afghanistan and the A-tour of England. “I remember an incident when Shami was going through personal problems. His physical fitness was at the lowest ebb. We were about to go on the A-tour of England. Shami had failed a fitness test. “He walked up to Ravi (Shastri) and me, saying he was very angry with life and wanted to give up the sport,” Arun said. “We sat him down and told him that anger was the best thing that can happen to a fast bowler. We told him that if he channelises his anger and uses it to get fitter, he could do wonders. “We sent him to the NCA where he, where he was for a month. trained exceptionally hard. , like a maniac bull. I remember him calling me in England and saying ‘now I am as strong as a horse, and I am ready to take on the world’. The rest is history.” Shami was included in the squad for the tour of England after clearing the fitness test and was back among the wickets, picking 16 wickets in five Tests at 38.87. He is now part of an Indian pace attack that’s arguably the best in the world.

Motley Crew CC endured a nail-biting finish before vice-captain Bobby Dolan struck the winning boundary to spark delirious scenes. The 31-year-old English teacher told The Sun: “It has been a long wait and there was a bundle on the square when I managed to hit a four to seal victory. “We had 25 fans watching and they all ran on and jumped on me. “It has been a long wait and so we have been celebrating in style in the pub. I still can’t believe we’re finally off the mark.” Motley Crew — made up of players aged from 14 to 70 — was established in 1993 by a group of dads in Faversham, Kent . Bobby said: “We’re absolutely terrible. There are just a few of us who know how to hold a bat and throw a ball. \"But we put up with getting thrashed for the love of the game.” But on Sunday they finally came good against the Three Horseshoes in Hernhill. The pub team were restricted to just 134-4 from 30 overs — albeit after their star batsman was hit on the head by a wild delivery and retired hurt. In reply, Motley Crew’s Daniel Groom struck a record 76 before a predictable collapse left Bobby and last man 14-year-old Callum Groom, who had never played cricket before, to get the final 17 runs. Motley Crew CC captain Tom Browning, 33, told of his pride — especially as his dad Steve, 67, had skippered the side in 1993. Tom said: “It’s always been about having a laugh, a few too many beers and a good day out — but to win was amazing. \"There were a fair few hangovers.”","pubDate":"2022-06-28 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Ireland, 2nd T20I: Deepak Hooda's maiden century helps India beat Ireland by 4 runs to pocket se - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMivwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9uZXdzL2luZGlhLXZzLWlyZWxhbmQtMm5kLXQyMGktZGVlcGFrLWhvb2Rhcy1tYWlkZW4tY2VudHVyeS1oZWxwcy1pbmRpYS1iZWF0LWlyZWxhbmQtYnktNC1ydW5zLXRvLXBvY2tldC1zZXJpZXMtMi0wL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyNTI4OTk2LmNtc9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Ireland, 2nd T20I: Deepak Hooda's maiden century helps India beat Ireland by 4 runs to pocket se  Times of India2nd T20I: Deepak Hooda, Sanju Samson, Umran Malik help India beat Ireland | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIndia win thriller vs Ireland after Deepak Hooda 104 and Sanju Samson 77, clinch series T20I series 2-0  India TodayShashi Tharoor Got Trolled Badly For His Tweet On Sanju Samson And Deepak Hooda  The Cricket LoungeDeepak Hooda, Umran Malik Shine As India Clinch Series 2-0 vs Ireland  NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 19:46:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs IRE, 2nd T20I: Deepak Hooda hits century as India beat Ireland by 4 runs in thrilling contest, claim series 2-0","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-ire-2nd-t20i-deepak-hooda-hits-century-as-india-beat-ireland-by-4-runs-in-thrilling-contest-claim-series-2-0-2479238.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Deepak Hooda became the fourth Indian to score a century in T20 cricket after Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Suresh Raina.","content":"Team India managed to claim a four-run win over Ireland in the second and final T20I of the series at The Village, Dublin on Tuesday. Deepak Hooda was the star of the match for the visitors as he smashed his maiden T20I century. Sanju Samson also played blistering innings to help India post 227/7 in 20 overs. Chasing a huge total Ireland fell short by just four runs after a brilliant batting display by Andrew Balbirnie, Paul Stirling and George Dockrell. For India, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umran Malik, Harshal Patel and Ravi Bishnoi picked one wicket each while Axar Patel and Hardik Pandya were economical. What a thriller we've witnessed #TeamIndia win the 2nd #IREvIND by 4 runs and seal the 2-match series Scorecard https://t.co/6Ix0a6evrR pic.twitter.com/6GaXOAaieQ — BCCI (@BCCI) June 28, 2022 Earlier, the pair of Hooda (104 off 57) and Samson (77 off 42) stitched 176 runs together for the second wicket, which is so far the highest by any Indian pair in the T20Is, to totally demoralize the hosts. After winning the toss and opting to bat first, India lost the wicket of Ishan Kishan in the 3rd over of the innings, with the batter managing just 3 off 5 balls. The wicket didn't affect Hooda and Samson much as they didn't look under any discomfort. Hooda was looking more aggressive while Samson, who was playing his first match of the series, took his time to settle down as India reached 54/1 after 6 overs. Hooda continued his aggressive approach even after the powerplay and raced to his fifty in 27 balls. On the other hand, Samson also shifted gears as India went past the 100-run mark inside 11 overs. Very soon, Samson also reached his half-century in 31 balls as India were racing towards a big total. The carnage from Hooda and Samson came soon as they smashed Irish bowlers for 20 and 19 runs in the 14th and 15th overs respectively. It was Mark Adair, who finally broke the huge partnership by cleaning up Samson on the second ball of the 17th over. Suryakumar Yadav was the new batter and he got into the action straightaway, hitting the bowler for a six and four as India sailed past the 200-run mark in the same over. On the other hand, Hooda looked in sublime touch throughout the innings and slammed his maiden T20I hundred off just 55 balls. He became the fourth Indian batter after Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, and K.L. Rahul to score a century in T20Is. Suryakumar (15), who was looking for the big hits, got out to Joshua Little. The centurion Hooda was also dismissed by Little in the same over, while he was trying to nudge a delivery on the leg stump. Thereafter, Craig Young picked two wickets in consecutive balls in the 19th over as Dinesh Karthik and Axar Patel failed to open their accounts. Mark Adair, who came to bowl the final over, did a decent job as he picked the wicket of Harshal Patel and conceded just 10 runs in it. Hardik Pandya returned unbeaten on (15 off 9) as India posted a gigantic 227/7 after 20 overs. For Ireland, Mark Adair took three wickets while Craig Young and Josh Little got two apiece.","pubDate":"2022-06-28 19:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland vs India 2nd T20I Live Score: Umran Malik Gets Maiden Wicket, Ireland 4 Down vs India - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvaXJlbGFuZC12cy1pbmRpYS0ybmQtdDIwaS0yMDIyLWxpdmUtc2NvcmUtdXBkYXRlcy0zMTA4MjUw0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pcmVsYW5kLXZzLWluZGlhLTJuZC10MjBpLTIwMjItbGl2ZS1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTMxMDgyNTAvYW1wLzE?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ireland vs India 2nd T20I Live Score: Umran Malik Gets Maiden Wicket, Ireland 4 Down vs India  NDTV SportsIndia vs Ireland 2nd T20 Live Score Updates: Umran Malik gets first international wicket, Ireland lose 4th  The Indian ExpressIND vs IRE: India's Predicted Playing XI Against Ireland, 2nd T20I  Cricket AddictorIND vs IRE Live Cricket Score 2nd T20I Latest Updates: Balbernie, Stirling Power Ireland In Stiff Chase  News18\"There's Always Pressure\": Ex-Pak Spinner Backs Umran Malik Post Lacklustre Debut  NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 18:34:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland vs India Live Score Ball by Ball, Ireland vs India 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ireland-vs-india-live-score-over-2nd-t20i-t20-11-15-updates-3109681","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Ireland vs India from The Village, Malahide, Dublin.

Samson and Hooda, who had represented India in the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup eight years ago, made the most of their experience of batting together by putting India in a commanding position after captain Hardik Pandya (13*) won the toss and chose to bat. Playing his first match of the series, Samson scored his maiden international half-century as his 77 (42) comprised of nine fours and four sixes coming at a strike rate of 183.33. Hooda, Samson, Sky.

During the second and final T20I of the ongoing India’s tour of Ireland at The Village Cricket ground in Malahide, Dublin, team India have gone hammer and tongs and thrashed the Irish bowlers black and blue, surpassing the 200-run mark within the 17 Overs after opting to bat first. The only moment worth a deserving grin for the Irish bowlers came during the third Over of the match, when they dismissed the in-form Ishan Kishan (3 off 5). Post that, the batting pair of Deepak Hooda (104 off 57) and Sanju Samson (77 off 42) tore apart the opposition bowling line-up with a second wicket partnership of 176 runs off mere 87 deliveries, which is now also team India’s highest stand for any wicket in the format. While Samson notched-up his maiden T20I half-century in 31 deliveries, Hooda went on to become only the fourth Indian to smash a T20I century, reaching the landmark moment while facing his 55th delivery of the night. Fastest players to hit maiden T20I hundred (among Test-playing nations): 2 – Richard Levi, Evin Lewis 3 – DEEPAK HOODA* 4 – KL Rahul, Chris Gayle Take a bow, Deepak Hooda! Been some hitting this #INDvIRE — Lalith Kalidas (@lal__kal) June 28, 2022 Born in Rohtak, Haryana in the year 1995, Deepak Hooda made his First-Class debut for Baroda in December 2014. In his first match itself, Hooda went on to become only the second batter from Baroda after Snehal Parikh, to smash a First-Class century on debut. The flamboyant all-rounder had been an integral part of the Baroda domestic team set-up until 2020, when the association decided to suspend him on grounds of indiscipline, after a controversial fall-out with Baroda skipper Krunal Pandya. Six months later, Hooda decided to cut ties with Baroda altogether, to join the Rajasthan domestic team for the 2021-22 season. In his 46 First-Class matches for Baroda, the 27-year-old amassed a total of 2,908 runs at an average of 42.76, with the assistance of 15 half-centuries and 9 centuries.","pubDate":"2022-06-28 17:38:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hooda slams maiden T20I ton for India to join Rohit, Rahul, Raina in elite list - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiwwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS12cy1pcmVsYW5kLTJuZC10MjBpLWRlZXBhay1ob29kYS1zbGFtcy1tYWlkZW4tdDIwaS1jZW50dXJ5LWZvci1pbmRpYS10by1qb2luLXJvaGl0LXNoYXJtYS1rbC1yYWh1bC1hbmQtc3VyZXNoLXJhaW5hLWluLWVsaXRlLWxpc3QtMTAxNjU2NDM1NjE1NTUwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Hooda slams maiden T20I ton for India to join Rohit, Rahul, Raina in elite list  Hindustan TimesDeepak Hooda, Umran Malik Shine As India Clinch Series 2-0 vs Ireland  NDTV Sports2nd T20I: Deepak Hooda, Sanju Samson, Umran Malik help India beat Ireland | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzIndia win thriller vs Ireland after Deepak Hooda 104 and Sanju Samson 77, clinch series T20I series 2-0  India TodayShashi Tharoor Got Trolled Badly For His Tweet On Sanju Samson And Deepak Hooda  The Cricket LoungeView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 17:21:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs IRE Live Cricket Score 2nd T20I Latest Updates: Ton-up Deepak Hooda, Sanju Samson Power India to 227 - News18","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMivwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2NyaWNrZXRuZXh0L25ld3MvbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLWluZGlhLXZzLWlyZWxhbmQtMm5kLXQyMGktbGF0ZXN0LXVwZGF0ZXMtaW5kLXZzLWlyZS1saXZlLXN0cmVhbWluZy10b2RheS1tYXRjaC1jb3ZlcmFnZS1oaWdobGlnaHRzLWZyb20tZHVibGluLWxpdmVuZXdzLTU0NTY5OTUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IND vs IRE Live Cricket Score 2nd T20I Latest Updates: Ton-up Deepak Hooda, Sanju Samson Power India to 227  News18IND vs IRE: India's Predicted Playing XI Against Ireland, 2nd T20I  Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Ireland vs India, India in Ireland 2022, 2nd T20I  ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Ireland 2nd T20I 2022 Live Score: Hooda ton, Samson's 77 take India to a mammoth 227/7  Times of India\"There's Always Pressure\": Ex-Pak Spinner Backs Umran Malik Post Lacklustre Debut  NDTV SportsView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 17:12:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Fastest T20 century in international cricket: Fastest century in T20 international full list","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-fastest-t20-century-in-international-cricket-fastest-century-in-t20-international-full-list/","keywords":["Cricket","Deepak Hooda","India","India tour of Ireland 2022","Ireland"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Fastest T20 century in international cricket: The rookie Indian batter has brought up a maiden T20I century.

During the second T20I of the ongoing India’s tour of Ireland in Dublin, India batter Deepak Hooda has played a blinder of an innings to bring up a maiden century in international cricket. Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the third over, Hooda hit Ireland pacer Mark Adair for a six in the same over. Hooda, who had hooked Adair on this particular occasion, stepped out to hit Craig Young for a six down the ground. Appearing to be in his element on the back of several boundaries in the powerplay, Hooda soon outscored non-striker Sanju Samson (77) to continue to hit boundaries at The Village today. Although a difficult chance, Ireland batter Paul Stirling dropping Hooda at cover perhaps provided more confidence to the 27-year old player. Hooda, who hit a couple of sixes off Ireland spinner Andy McBrine in the 10th over, ran a single to complete a 27-ball half-century in the same over. Hooda kick-started the second part of the innings by hitting consecutive boundaries off pacer Josh Little. In the following over, Hooda hit Conor Olphert for two fours and a six to provide no respite to the Irish bowlers. After slowing down a bit, it was on the first delivery of the 18th over when Hooda ran a single off Little to reach to his maiden T20I century. Focal point in propelling India to 225/7 in 20 overs, Hooda ended up scoring 104 (57) with the help of nine fours and six sixes. Hooda, who completed a 55-ball T20I century, is nowhere near the batters with fastest T20I centuries. As far as Indian batters are concerned, Hooda has scored the fourth-fastest century in this format today. Furthermore, readers must note that Hooda has become the fourth Indian batter (after Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul) to score a T20I hundred. Well played Deepak Hooda👏🏻👏🏻. — Ian Raphael Bishop (@irbishi) June 28, 2022 For more cricket-related news, click here .","pubDate":"2022-06-28 17:11:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Eoin Morgan: England white-ball captain departs 'an immortal of English sport' - BBC","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzYxOTY2NzA10gEuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzYxOTY2NzA1LmFtcA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Eoin Morgan: England white-ball captain departs 'an immortal of English sport'  BBC‘I just would have felt like an impostor’: Morgan confirms England retirement  The GuardianEoin Morgan: England white-ball captain retires from international cricket  BBCEoin Morgan says it’s ‘right time’ to go as he confirms international retirement  The IndependentEoin Morgan says it's 'right time' to go as he confirms international retirement  Kidderminster ShuttleView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-28 17:01:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IND vs IRE, 2nd T20: Deepak Hooda hits century, becomes fourth Indian to smash hundred in T20I","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ind-vs-ire-2nd-t20-deepak-hooda-hits-century-becomes-fourth-indian-to-smash-hundred-in-t20i-2479189.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Earlier only Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Suresh Raina had achieved this milestone in T20 cricket.","content":"India all-rounder Deepak Hooda Smashed his maiden T20I century in the second T20I against Ireland at The Village, Dublin on Tuesday.
