The Sixers came under fire for retiring Silk - the regular middle-order batsman, who came to the crease at number eight - on the final ball of the innings because of a dodgy hamstring. The interesting tactical decision came just balls after he came to the crease. The Sixers’ decision to do so led to the Strikers initially feeling aggrieved, while former Australian captain Adam Gilchrist said in commentary on the Fox Cricket that “my gut feel says I don’t like this”. Watch every KFC BBL Finals game Live & On-Demand on Kayo or catch up for FREE with minis on Kayo Freebies. Join Kayo Now > Sixers win THRILLER to advance to Final | 04:10 Henriques, however, said it was a considered move before they sent Silk into bat and they hoped if the right-hander got on strike he could target the short boundary. “Well, he went out to the short boundary in the hope that if he was on strike, he had that short boundary,” Henriques told Fox Cricket following the dramatic final-ball victory. “If he batted at nine he could have a runner, we sent him in at eight to try and get a couple of boundaries in that last over and then as soon as he wasn’t able to face that ball, and we needed that person to run, we knew he couldn’t run so we thought we’d just retire him and have someone who can.” With the ‘spirit of cricket’ tagline thrown at him, Henriques blasted suggestions that the Sixers broke any moral compass by retiring Silk and instead said the schedule was compromising his players’ health. “I don’t understand how (we’ve broken the spirit of cricket),” Henriques replied. “They are clearly within the rules of the game. “I mean, unfortunately, we had a guy (Silk) go down with a hamstring, one of the fittest guys in the league, it’s probably something to do with out schedule, five flights in eight days and so many back to back games, I don’t really see how that’s (fair). “We’re trying to back up with guys carrying little injuries and so on; he normally bats at five, so the fact he’s gone in at eight, I think we’re sacrificing enough as it is.” ‘HOW’S THAT NOT A WIDE?’ The shock calls and horror blunders that decided a BBL epic READ: Smith BBL fiasco deepens as a COACH is forced to play for stricken Sixers WINNERS AND LOSERS: Gamble on Ashes hero’s return; brutal reality check for loyal servant Key moments in Sydney's thrilling win | 01:32 The Sixers lost three players, including star wicket-keeper batsman Josh Philippe, recently due to Covid, while Daniel Hughes’ injury meant the Sixers had four players unavailable for the semi-final. Calf injuries to Henriques and veteran spinner Steve O’Keefe have the Sixers scrambling to field a team ahead of Friday’s final against the Scorchers in Melbourne, with the Sixers having just 12 fit players. Although 12 is enough to field a team, the two extra X-Factor players permitted in 13-player match day squads have the Sixers behind the eight-ball. In light of that, it makes the decision not to allow Australian batsman Steve Smith to play all the more perplexing. Dramatic final over sees Sixers prevail! | 01:54 Former Australian ODI opener Mark Waugh had no issues with the decision to retire Silk, particularly given the hardline Cricket Australia stance not to allow Smith to play. “I’m happy with it, I’m fine with it,” Waugh told Fox Cricket. “All the things that have happened to the Sixers in this tournament - not being able to play Steve Smith etc - they’ve played by the rules tonight, so I’m happy with it.” Gilchrist, too, changed his tune and described the tactical decision as a bit of quick thinking. “I was questioning it as it played out,” Gilchrist said. “I thought, ‘hang on a minute, is this right?’ “But thinking about it, I agree with Junior (Waugh), it is within the rules and it’s actually fairly quick thinking, nifty thinking, and that’s years and years of experienced cricket heads coming together there and I can’t do anything other than to sit back and go, well done, they’ve picked up an opportunity there within the rules.” Covid rules out Sixers star before final | 00:38 Speaking after the match, Strikers captain Peter Siddle played down the controversial moment. “You can retire blokes, at the end of the day,” Siddle said. “He can retire, it’s not actually a big issue. “Obviously I was disappointed at the time. It’s just a retirement isn’t it?... That’s just a part of the game.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"West Indies v England: third T20 international – live!","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jan/26/west-indies-v-england-third-t20-international-live-score-updates-cricket","keywords":["England in West Indies 2022","West Indies cricket team","England cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Tim de Lisle"],"video_url":null,"description":"Live news from the match in Bridgetown, 8pm GMT startThe Spin: cricket gear buyers are stumped by lack of clarityAnd you can contact Tim by email or on TwitterMoeen says Morgan felt something in the warm-up.

Bowled him! Top of off, as King steps away to late-cut. A great riposte from England’s newest fast bowler. “Beautiful ball there,” says Steve Harmison. Mid-2nd over: West Indies 7-0 (King 6, Hope 1) And now it’s George Garton, so Moeen opens with two left-armers. Garton goes full with his first ball, and swings it, but Brandon King is waiting with a warm welcome – a straight push for four. Another four follows, off a cut, but then... 1st over: West Indies 3-0 (King 2, Hope 1) It’s Reece Topley, who suddenly finds himself the senior new-ball bowler. He keeps it tight, conceding just three singles, and Harry Brook manages to distinguish himself with his first touches of the ball in international cricket, swooping from cover and hitting the stumps with an under-arm shy. Nerves, shmerves. The players are out there and both sides are taking a knee. Harry Brook , the Yorkshire batter, takes Morgan’s place in the middle order. Phil Salt , the Sussex dasher, takes the wicketkeeping gloves as Sam Billings’ globetrotting seems to have caught up with him. And George Garton , the left-arm quick, also from Sussex, comes in for Chris Jordan. That could be the end of an era – or just a case of giving a beleaguered bowler a break. Moeen seemed to be in a hurry and didn’t leave us 100pc the wiser, so I’m just waiting for confirmation of the England team. Kieron Powell is crystal-clear about his XI. He’s bringing in Rovman Powell, with his clean hitting, to replace Odean Smith. Moeen says Morgan felt something in the warm-up. And he reveals that England are fielding not one debutant, not two, but three. Morgan is rested, so Moeen captains England. Another good line from Topley. “Someone said to me, ‘The best bowlers in T20 are the ones with the shortest memories.’ ” “Reece The Goldfish Topley,” says Butcher with a chuckle. Reece Topley is on the screen, being interviewed by Butcher. “Red-ball ambitions?” Butcher says, tentatively. “I played a lot of Championship games for Surrey last year,” Topley replies, “because I really want to play Test cricket. Obviously it’s the pinnacle still for me.” Interesting. One of the correspondents in Bridgetown, Richard Gibson of the Mail, has tweeted some unconfirmed news. “Sounds like no Eoin Morgan for England today,” he says. “Moeen Ali captain. Morgan was doing some fitness drills with Rob Ahmun on the edge of the square just before the huddle.” The rain has shown up, though it seems to be clearing already. The OBO’s favourite commentator, Mark Butcher, has been studying the pitch. “It’s not a belter,” he reports, “but it’s not a shocker.” He reckons a par score tonight will be 150-155. Evening everyone and welcome to the third set in this five-setter. It’s perfectly poised at 1-1, but West Indies have been the better team, winning the first set 6-0 and only losing the second 7-6, after being 5-0 down. That’s enough of that analogy – anyone for cricket? It’s been absorbing stuff, with West Indies shaping up suspiciously well for the world’s tenth-ranked team and England struggling with their death bowling, just as they did in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. In fact England have a wider problem: their right-arm seam bowling as a whole. Over the past year in T20 internationals, England’s spinners have averaged 17 runs per wicket and their left-arm seamers 19, while the right-arm seamers have only managed 31. It’s much the same story with economy rates: spinners 6.64 runs per over, lefties 6.78, righties 8.23. (With thanks, as so often, to Stats Guru.) The individual figures suggest that England are missing Jofra Archer, as you’d expect, but they’re also missing Sam Curran, whose average, economy and strike rate over the past year are all better than Archer’s. The seamer struggling the most is the one Eoin Morgan uses the most – Chris Jordan. A pillar of this team, he’s suddenly doing better as a batter than a bowler. Morgan’s dilemma tonight is whether to persist with Jordan, hoping he finds his mojo and his yorker, or to send for another leftie to team up with Reece Topley, whose comeback on Sunday night, after a long and winding lay-off, was a triumph. Morgan has three other lefties up his sleeve – Tymal Mills, the master of the slower ball, who played in the first match of this series; George Garton, who is quick and can bat as well; and David Payne, who would be a seasoned novice in the Scott Boland mould. Morgan doesn’t tend to make many changes, though, and he may have a different one in mind – one Liam in lieu of another. Liam Livingstone, who has been out with oesophagitis (a pain in the throat), is thought to be fit again and could replace Liam Dawson as the third spinner, as well as sparking up England’s big-hitting. West Indies, meanwhile, are expected to stick with an almost-winning team. The venue, as for the whole series, is Bridgetown, Barbados. There’s some rain forecast but only for the first hour, which shouldn’t mess things up. Play starts at 8pm GMT (3pm local time), so do drop back around 7.35pm for news of the toss, the teams and the tally of lefties.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d77bbc73040c31d198d21e191ffa711aa94fca2/0_179_4758_2856/master/4758.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bd635296338813b29bc2a308aa330e3","source_id":"theguardian"},{"title":"Pakistan Super League 2022 Live Telecast Channel in India and Pakistan: When and where to watch PSL 2022 in UK and USA?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-pakistan-super-league-2022-live-telecast-channel-in-india-and-pakistan-when-and-where-to-watch-psl-2022-in-uk-and-usa/","keywords":["Cricket","Pakistan Super League","PSL 2022"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan Super League 2022 Live Telecast Channel: The SportsRush presents before you the timing and live streaming details of PSL 2022.

The Al Amerat Cricket Ground (Ministry Turf 1) will host this contest. This is the last match of the league stage. It is a must-win game for the India Maharajas while the World Giants need to make sure they don’t lose by a big margin as it will result in them getting knocked out of the competition. A win will see them face the Asia Lions in the final on January 29. India Maharajas won their first game of the competition but have lost two games on the trot. They need to be at their absolute best in their last league game. The Maharajas suffered a heavy loss against the Asia Lions in their previous fixture. Bowling first, the Maharajas picked up four wickets but failed to keep a check on the scoring rate as the Lions scored 193 in their 20 overs. It was a daunting task for the Maharajas and they crumbled in the chase. They only managed to score 157, losing the game by 36 runs. The World Giants, on the other hand, lost their opening game of the competition but turned the tables around as they won their next two games. They defeated the Asia Lions comprehensively in their previous fixture. After electing to bowl first, the bowlers did a fine job of restricting the Asia Lions to 149. The batters then stepped up and chased down the total in 13 overs to win the game by seven wickets and increase the team's run rate. They will be looking to finish the league stages on a high.

The series is delicately poised heading into day one at Manuka Oval (first ball 10am AEDT) after rain cruelled the T20 leg of the series, with two of three matches unable to achieve a result. It means that Australia only leads 4-2 having secured a dominant nine-wicket win in the only completed T20 match of the series last week. Watch the CommBank Women’s Ashes Series on Kayo.

It means Australia can win the Ashes in Canberra but, by the same token, England could surge into the lead with three ODIs remaining. Either way, teams may need to make headway early in the Test with up to 15 millimetres of rain and a storm forecast in Canberra for day three. There will be a sense of cruel deja vu for England who is chasing the series in Australia nearly two years after its 2020 T20 World Cup campaign was destroyed by rain in Sydney. McGrath shines in early Ashes win | 03:35 Meanwhile, Australia star Beth Mooney is still unable to eat without the aid of a straw and a blender, but that won’t stop her from plotting the demise of the English bowling attack on day one. A wayward cricket ball broke Mooney’s jaw at training earlier this month and captain Meg Lanning said the star batter’s high-speed recovery had inspired the Aussies ahead of the clash with their most bitter rival. “It’s pretty incredible. Right from the moment she got hit, she was pretty positive about the whole situation,” Lanning said ahead of the Test. “She looks really good in the nets and in the field, so she’s confident she’ll have no issues moving forward. “To be coming back to be playing international cricket around a week after having jaw surgery is pretty inspirational for the group.” Aussie staff have kept a close eye on Mooney. Picture: Mark Evans / Getty Images Source: Getty Images Australia’s dietitian, doctor and physiotherapist have masterminded a meal plan to fuel Mooney ahead of the long days on the pitch in the nation’s capital. “She’s only on a liquid diet at the moment, which doesn’t sound like a lot of fun. Not a lot of variety,” Lanning said. “Obviously with a Test match, the longer format, you obviously need to have (energy) over a long period of time, but they’ve done a great job. “Moons has coped with it really well, so she’ll be ready to go.” Speaking of the rain, Lanning said the chance of wet weather wouldn’t factor into Australia’s game plan. “We’re coming here to win, there’s no doubt about that,” she said. “That’s all we’ve spoken about over the past few days; how can we best set up a victory. “There’s a bit of weather around, but I think there’s no reason why we can’t make that up over the four days if we do have a little bit of time taken out. “Pretty confident we’ll get a good amount of time in through the game.” HOW TO WATCH Watch the one-off Women’s Ashes Test on Kayo.

From the very beginning, the American Civil War has been closely tied to the origins of baseball. Abner Doubleday, the sport’s mythical inventor, was a Union general in the war who fought at the decisive Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, and throughout the war, soldiers on both sides played the game when not marching or in battle to pass the time. As Steve Light writes, “Baseball came of age during [the] American Civil War.” The evolution of town ball into the game of baseball began in Northern cities during the antebellum period, most notably in New York and Massachusetts. Two variants of the sport spread from both these regions, known respectively as the New York game and the Massachusetts game. Having evolved from the Knickerbocker Rules, the New York game began to spread via the National Association of Base Ball Players, the first formal organization of baseball clubs; despite its national aspirations, prior to the Civil War it was primarily a New York entity — all its founding members, for example, came from the five boroughs. The Massachusetts game, meanwhile, spread throughout the New England states, although it would occasionally be played outside them. Rooted in the Knickerbocker Rules, the New York game took major steps in baseball’s evolution toward the modern game. Unlike earlier variants, you could retire a runner by stepping on the bag with the ball only if it was a force out; previously, every baserunner could be put out as if it were a force play. Starting in 1857, the 21-run endpoint was eliminated, with games instead ending after nine innings. Called strikes were introduced — previously, strikes were only the result of missed swings — while cricket-style flat bats were banned. In 1860, it was decided that it would be a good idea to mark the boundary between fair and foul territory with a white line — previously, the umpire essentially had to guess — as the modern field slowly began to take shape. Photo by Interim Archives/Getty Images The Civil War proved to be a turning point in the evolution of baseball. Prior to 1861, the sport had a following throughout the country to such a point that the above political cartoon about the presidential election of 1860 used its imagery to promote Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy. It was still, however, largely an urban phenomenon, and a Northeastern one at that. Over the course of the war, though, soldiers from both sides began to play as a means to stay in shape and pass the time. The number of games would peak during February, March, and April, when the weather was good enough on the front to play (remember, almost all battles in the war took place in the South), but the melting snows from the winter and spring rains made it difficult for armies to operate. From May through October, the war was fought, and when winter came around again and the armies found their winter shelters, the number of games would make a resurgence while the weather was still good enough. Although the Massachusetts game continued to be played among New Englanders, it was the New York version that came to be widespread, with officers even procuring bats and balls for their men to be able to play. On the home front in the North, the National Association of Base Ball Players continued to meet during this time, while games became public events for spectators looking for entertainment and distraction from wartime worries. During these years, further rule changes came into effect. As some of these rules came from the Massachusetts game — for example, 1863’s decision to make it so that balls had to be caught on the fly to register as an out — it is likely that some of these rules spread into the New York game from New England regiments. Others, however, appear to be totally new innovations, intended to address one issue or another that had popped up. Sure enough, in 1863, a pitcher’s box and batter’s box were specifically marked, and in 1864, it was explicitly stated that a runner must touch every base in order. Following the Civil War, the National Association of Base Ball Players, its similarly named successor, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, and the new National League continued to refine the game. Some rule changes, such as 1867’s decision to let the batter request where in the strike zone the pitch would be and 1887’s “four strikes per out”, did not last, while others — for example, the decision to classify foul bunts and caught foul tips as strikes in 1893 and 1894 — have remained in effect to this day. Still others were tweaked many times before they found their modern form. Originally, a ball was called after three “unhittable” pitches, which meant that, although a walk was technically only three balls, it required nine “unhittable” pitches. In 1879, they officially set the number of balls for a walk at nine, decreeing that every pitch was either a strike, a ball, or a foul; that number would be reduced to eight in 1880, to six in 1884, to five in 1887, and finally to four in 1889. The modern pitcher’s mound, however, originated with a pitcher’s box that was 12 feet-by-4 feet in 1863, altered to 6-feet square in 1867, and reduced to 4 feet-by-5-and-a-half in 1887 before finally being removed in favor of the slab that a pitcher was required to push off of in 1893. By the time the American League established itself as a major league in 1901, the game of baseball had largely come into the form that it exists in today. Meanwhile the rulebook has continued to evolve over the years: spitballs and other means of doctoring the ball were banned in 1920, the pitcher’s mound was reduced and the strike zone shrunk in 1969, the designated hitter was implemented in 1973, and the three-batter-minimum added in 2020. Compared to the changes that happened throughout the 19th century, none of these fundamentally changed the game, even if they altered how players and coaches approached it.","pubDate":"2022-01-26 19:00:00","full_description":"From the very beginning, the American Civil War has been closely tied to the origins of baseball.

The Australian women’s side did commence the Ashes series with a resounding 9-wicket victory over England during the first T20I at the Adelaide Oval, but the rain Gods refused to relent during the match days of both the remaining T20Is of the series, which meant that the points had to be shared equally between the two sides. Thus, with Australia leading the multi-format series 4-2, the action now shifts towards the one-off Test match which commences from January 27 at the Manuka Oval in Canberra, wherein both the teams would like to grab another 4 points with a win under their belt. Led by Heather Knight, the England side would be desperate to get out on the field, in a bid to register their first win of the tour. During the last Ashes series three years ago, Australia had thrashed England 12-4, with the English side managing to win just a single match out of seven overall in their own backyard. On the other hand, a win for Meg Lanning-led Australian side would take their overall points to 8, which would be enough for them to retain the Ashes.

Skipper of the Adelaide Strikers this season, Siddle made sure he led by example throughout the 17 matches in the league, before his team bowed out of the tournament on Wednesday at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), by losing against the Sydney Sixers in a virtual semi-final, and in what was an absolute humdinger of a game by 4 wickets off the final delivery of the match. Siddle, however, finished the season on a high, as he would most likely end up as the highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 30 wickets off 17 innings, at an average of 17.73 and an 8.33 economy rate. Placed below him in the list is Sydney Sixers’ all-rounder Hayden Kerr, who has scalped 24 wickets so far off 15 innings, with a final game against Perth Scorchers yet to go. How old is Peter Siddle: Will Peter Siddle play BBL 2022-23? Peter Siddle, who will turn 38 years of age in November this year, last played for Australia in 2019 against England during the final Ashes Test at The Oval. The right-arm pacer from Victoria had announced his retirement from International Cricket soon after. During the post match interaction with 7Cricket– Australia’s host broadcaster for BBL, Siddle remarked he still had another year of Cricket left in him, and he would call it curtains after that. “I’ve got one more year left in me. I’ll have another crack next year. State cricket, BBL, and then after that I think I’ll be pretty much done”, exclaimed Siddle, when asked if he’d still be around next year. “I’m getting close to ‘had enough’, I’m still enjoying it, but yeah the body is only getting older and honestly some of these young guys start playing so nearly time for them to have a crack,” the 37-year-old further added. “I’ve got one more year left in me. I’ll have another crack next year. State cricket, BBL, and then after that I think I’ll be pretty much done.” Peter Siddle on his future… pic.twitter.com/weP9RjeTRY — 7Cricket (@7Cricket) January 26, 2022 Siddle’s Adelaide Strikers finished 4th after the end of the league stage, and went on to win six consecutive game before the juggernaut came to a halt during the Challenger match.           The post How old is Peter Siddle: Will Peter Siddle play BBL 2022-23? appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-26 17:29:16","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"India vs West Indies: Kuldeep Yadav makes comeback; Bumrah, Shami rested as India announce ODI squad","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-kuldeep-yadav-makes-comeback-jasprit-bumrah-mohammed-shami-rested-as-india-announce-odi-t20i-squad-2022-01-26-756483","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The Board of Control for Cricket in India has announced India's ODI and T20I squad for the upcoming home series against West Indies starting from February 6.

With a few dark clouds hovering above the BCCI with regards to conduction of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 pertaining the COVID-19 situation in the country, the addition of the two new IPL teams, has made sure that the excitement for the beginning of a new season of the cash-rich league has not diminished a bit. With the eight initial franchises having already announced their retained players’ list ahead of the mega auction next month, the to-be debutant franchises Ahmedabad and Lucknow have added three players each to their squad as well. Both the new franchises have also appointed their respective coaching staff for the upcoming season. While the team of Andy Flower (head coach), Vijay Dahiya (assistant coach), and Gautam Gambhir (mentor) are set to take charge of the Lucknow Super Giants, it is former India pacer Ashish Nehra (head coach) alongside Gary Kirsten (mentor), who have been signed by the Ahmedabad franchise. Moreover, Ahmedabad have also roped in former England batter Vikram Solanki as the team’s Director of Cricket for their debut season. Solanki, has also reportedly picked former India cricketer Aashish Kapoor as the team’s spin coach cum talent scout. Who is Aashish Kapoor? As per the Cricket website Cricbuzz, Aashish Kapoor has been roped in primarily for his services as a talent scout for the franchise, while his services as a spin bowling coach comes secondary. Kapoor has played a total of 4 Tests and 17 ODIs for India from 1994-2000, and is currently with the Bahrain side who are busy with their preparation for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup qualifiers in Oman. The former off-spinner has also played for quite a few states across a total of 128 First-Class and 93 List-A matches in the domestic circuit in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Tripura. “The talks with Aashish are underway and the franchise’s director of cricket Vikram Solanki is in touch with him,” said a source in the know, confirming the mutual interest of both the player and franchise. He had also been the head of the national junior selection committee till last year, and it is perhaps his first-hand knowledge regarding India’s pool of talent at the junior-level that has most likely earned him the position in the franchise. As far as the IPL is concerned, the 50-year-old had worked with the Delhi Daredevils during the first seven years of the league.     The post Who is Aashish Kapoor: Ahmedabad IPL team support staff gets another member ahead of IPL 2022 appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-01-26 16:17:24","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush"},{"title":"Sri Lanka tour of Australia: Lasith Malinga appointed as specialist bowling coach","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/sri-lanka-tour-of-australia-lasith-malinga-appointed-as-specialist-bowling-coach-by-sri-lanka-cricket-2022-01-26-756473","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Legendary pacer Lasith Malinga has been appointed as a specialist bowling coach for Sri Lanka's senior men's national team's upcoming tour of Australia, the country's cricket board announced on Wednesday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-26 16:13:03","full_description":"Legendary pacer has been appointed as a specialist bowling coach for Sri Lanka's senior men's national team's upcoming tour of Australia, the country's cricket board announced on Wednesday. \"Malinga, in his new short-term role as a specialist coach, will support Sri Lanka's bowlers, providing tactical insight and technical expertise to help the on-field execution of strategic plans,\" Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said in a release. \"SLC is confident that Malinga's vast experience and renowned death-bowling expertise, especially in the T20 format, will help the team immensely going into this series.\" Sri Lanka are scheduled to play five T20 Internationals in Australia starting from February 11.

Former Australia wicket-keeper batter Adam Gilchrist has defended defending champions Sydney Sixers’ ploy of retiring hurt batter Jordan Silk (1) before the last ball of the match in the recently concluded Challenger against Adelaide Strikers in Sydney. Needing a couple of runs to win, Sixers decided to recall injured Silk for his hamstring injury would’ve become a hindrance for him completing two runs in a virtual semi-final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Sixers head coach Greg Shipperd was the one who had initiated signalling towards Silk asking him to return to the dugout. Wicket-keeper batter Jay Lenton (0*) was the one who was sent in to stand at the non-striker’s end in order to run well between the wickets. Despite the move receiving some criticism, readers must note that it was well within the rules of the game by all measures. Sixers, who were exceptional in thinking of it in the first place, didn’t really need to run a couple as a mis-field got converted into a boundary to result in a thrilling last-ball victory for them. Adam Gilchrist defends Sydney Sixers retiring injured Jordan Silk in BBL 11 Challenger vs Adelaide Strikers Gilchrist, who was calling the game for 7 Cricket at that very exact moment, was unsure of such a rule existing in cricket at the time. “I don’t know about this, I don’t know about this,” Gilchrist said before being enlightened by former Australia batter Mark Waugh. “It’s within the rules, but it’s probably not within the spirit of the game,” Waugh said. Gilchrist, 50, took to social media platform Twitter to later term Sixers’ move as “clever”.
