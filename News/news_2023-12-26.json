He’s very passionate in his beliefs and his morals and his values. He’s not afraid to put them out there.” Usman Khawaja batting at the MCG on Boxing Day. Credit: Getty Khawaja was refused permission to wear shoes with the words “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right” before the first Test in Perth, and was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing a black arm band instead. This week the ICC refused an application compiled with Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association for Khawaja to have a dove insignia on his bat and gloves with a pointer to the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “I’m quite proud of him, actually,” said Hussey, who played with Khawaja for Australia and captained him at the Sydney Thunder. “I don’t think he’s trying to be divisive or political or anything like that. I feel as though he’s taking a humanitarian sort of view on life. “I respect what he’s done. He’s got to follow the rules that are set by the ICC, but he certainly is sticking true to what he believes in. And I think that’s the sort of guy he is, and certainly [has been] throughout his whole career. “You’ve got to remember this guy would have faced a lot of challenges in his career here in Australia growing up. Things have changed a lot in the last probably five to 10 years. And so for him to come through and feel like he’s confident enough to share his beliefs, I think is so critical.” Mike Hussey celebrates a century for Australia. Credit: Fairfax Khawaja was born in Pakistan and moved to Australia with his family as a young child. He is the first Muslim to play cricket for Australia and has had a remarkable late-career resurgence as an opening batsman. The 37-year-old’s initial attempt to wear messaging on his shoes in Perth without official permission from the Cricket Australia or the ICC appears to have created a roadblock for further attempts to spread his message. The writing was in the colours of a Palestinian flag. Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley alluded to this during a press conference at the MCG ahead of the opening day’s play of the Boxing Day Test. “My understanding is the context of the lead in to the Perth Test, and the context of the lead in to the making of the application [contributed to the ICC’s response]. Again, we worked with Uzzie to try and find something which was nonpartisan, non-religious, apolitical, the universally recognised symbol of peace. But I think the ICC statement calls out the broader context,” Hockley said on Tuesday. Usman Khawaja trains for the Boxing Day Test wearing shoes with a black dove on them. Credit: Getty “We didn’t speak yesterday. We spoke the day before and I think over the last week or so we’ve been working really constructively with Uzzie to find a way that [was] nonpartisan, I think that symbol is universally recognised as a symbol of peace. That being said, the ICC have got their rules. I think they explained the rationale really clearly, and we respect that. “What we’ve been really clear about is that support, as with all our players really, to share what they believe over their own channels. I think the ICC has very clear rules in place for good reason. I think I’ve already said it on Friday when we were here at the MCG, the thing that has really had a light shone upon is just the need for consistency of following the process and consistency in applications.” The ICC and Khawaja have both declined to comment, but on Monday night Khawaja posted on his Instagram a reel of other players wearing personal symbols with the caption: “Merry Christmas everybody. Sometimes you just gotta laugh. Cya at Boxing Day. #inconsistent #doublestandards” They included Marnus Labuschagne with an Eagle on his bat pointing to a bible verse.","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:59:30","image_url":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3062397162348917%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_jpg/d81ace93e5159b155b7d7266b5a6937608f11fce","source_id":"theage","source_priority":62533,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0574f16f87ffac87e7a536cc09c76a75","title":"Live: The countdown is on for the start of the Sydney to Hobart","link":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-26/sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race-live-blog/103265010","keywords":["Sport","Sailing"],"creator":["Andrew McGarry"],"video_url":null,"description":"The fleet is gathering on Sydney Harbour for the start of the blue water classic, with weather forecasts predicting a difficult trip south to Hobart.

First up is South Africa in a two-match away Test series, a country which India has found hard to succeed in and there lies the motivation - chance to become the first squad that wins a Test series in the rainbow nation. But can India do it? India's recent performances outside Asia in Test cricket haven't been great lately. The Indian team lost the series to the Proteas two years ago 1-2 before losing the rescheduled fifth Test against England after which they won in the Caribbean 1-0 but lost the World Test Championship final, twice in a row. The two-time WTC finalists have hit the transition button as far as the Test team is concerned and the glimpses of it were on display against the West Indies but South Africa will be a different animal altogether and Centurion is a venue that India likes. However, this time around Centurion has been a bit gloomy with all the rain in the past few days and it seems a similar weather will seep into the Boxing Day Test as well. As per Accuweather, there is a probability of precipitation of 92 percent on Tuesday morning, which reduced slightly to 80 percent in the afternoon. However, there is a probability of thunderstorms as well it is likely that Day 1 might be entirely washed out or even if the play happens, it might be restricted to a couple of hours or even less. Similarly on Day 2 as well, the rain percentage is as high as 90 and hence the showers might play a major role on Wednesday, December 27 as well. The forecast, however, improves on the third day, which is December 28 (Thursday). The temperatures will hover around a high of 22 degrees and a low of 13 degrees, which means it will be cool throughout the day but the rain might dampen the spirits on the Boxing Day. The players and fans will hope that they can get the maximum play in the first two days before hopefully the normal service resumes third day onwards.","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:45:01","image_url":"https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2023/12/76278-1703521431.jpg","source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"84e31617924ec52da232a6772a03b9df","title":"Contested, unbelievable, age-old: what are the definitive backyard cricket rules?","link":"https://www.braidwoodtimes.com.au/story/8470236/reviving-interest-in-cricket-with-boxing-day-backyard-games/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":["Karen Hardy"],"video_url":null,"description":"Forget Melbourne, the real cricket happens at home.","content":"If Cricket Australia is serious about getting this once proud cricketing nation interested in the game again then it should focus on the most important day on the calendar - Boxing Day.

Anyone who's ever faced a 17-year-old nephew who's just made the school first XI or run out their missus, knows that this is where the real cricket is being played this summer. Australians have been playing backyard cricket since backyards were invented. Some form of the game was probably played well before that too. Indeed, some experts believe children living in Norman times in the dense woodlands of south-east England invented the game, finding a small clearing to play in. Kind of like a medieval backyard. One can only assume they had the same arguments about rules as today's backyard cricketers. Perhaps the Norman children had to deal with uncles drunk on mead coming off a short run.

Merv was pretty nimble for a big guy and I can just imagine him scrambling for the ball as it bounced awkwardly off the gutter. Sports editor Chris Dutton, who pads away all my requests to resume said career like Shane Watson, grew up in Wagga and had a homeground rule that seems unbelievable. There was a dog door, he says, but it was around the corner and on the other side of the garden but if you hit it in there it was an instant century. He thinks his brother managed to do it once so they changed the rule. Another colleague, Paul Woodhams, had a good take on the over the fence being six and out, instead you lost 10 runs off your total and you had to go fetch it.

Electric wickie is in play the whole innings. Even if you've got one of those cool eskies with the stumps in it. If the ball touches any part of the wheelie bin, is it out? The old metal can was a better regulation height but they're hard to come by. Dog slobber and water from the dog's bowl is not ball tampering. Nothing comes on quicker than a damp ball of hard concrete. It's up to your family to decide whether they'll come at some duct tape on one side.

Hussey went the other way, the West Australian left-hander growing up as a specialist opener before making his mark in Test cricket in Australia's middle order. \"Opening is one of the toughest jobs in the game,\" Hussey told reporters on Tuesday after it was confirmed he would be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. \"So for me personally, if I was selecting, I'd be going for a traditional, proper opener - someone who's done it for a long period of time - because if you haven't done it much in your first-class career, it's going to be very difficult to to come up the order. \"I'm not saying you can't do it, and maybe someone could evolve into doing that role, but I think it would be difficult for a player like Mitch Marsh. \"I know there's been talk about him going up the order, I think he's probably more suited, much like Travis, to be in the middle order. \"I think that'd be the best for the balance of the Australian team.\" Harris was a member of Australia's 2023 Ashes touring squad and boosted his hopes of succeeding Warner with a century for Victoria in a tour match against Pakistan last week. Renshaw played two Tests in India earlier this year, while Bancroft has been on the outer since playing the last of his 10 Tests back in 2019, against England at Lord's. Bancroft has elevated his game over the last two summers and was the leading run-scorer in last season's Sheffield Shield, with 945 runs at 59.06. The 31-year-old heads this summer's leaderboard with 512 runs at 56.88. \"I like whoever's dominating the level below - who's been dominating in Sheffield Shield cricket over a period of time,\" Hussey said. \"To be fair, they all have at various stages, so it's a tough job for the selectors. \"I hope that they reward the guy that's been performing very well at Sheffield Shield cricket. \"I think that sends a great message to the competition and it's great for our pathways if we're going to reward the guys that are doing well the first-class level.\" Australian Associated Press","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:25:44","image_url":"https://www.busseltonmail.com.au/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fbafe03c-38dc-4966-aef7-c0643ea9a23a.jpg/r0_75_800_526_w600_h338_fmax.jpg","source_id":"busseltonmail","source_priority":6251187,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"daacc2b93a9a7c3a7e6b207d99cdd1da","title":"Australia vs Pakistan 2nd Test, Day 1: Live Score and Updates","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/australia-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-day-1-live-score-updates-melbourne-cummins-masood-starc-babar-shaheen-warner-2480413-2023-12-26?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia vs Pakistan 2nd Test, Day 1: Live Score and Updates","content":"Hello and welcome to the live coverage of Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test match between Australia and Pakistan in Melbourne.","pubDate":"2023-12-25 23:48:26","image_url":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/breaking_news/202312/shaheen-shah-afridi-163138793-16x9_2.jpg?VersionId=j2ZKyXaTw8J9FMFFdiOM5_9uwbVjmnxY","source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"4347e2d3212a372f2bf02c0c40b76383","title":"Pakistan to bowl first in MCG Test after winning toss","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/pakistan-to-bowl-first-in-mcg-test-after-winning-toss-c-13023488","keywords":null,"creator":["Oliver Caffrey"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia will bat first in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG after Pakistan captain Shan Masood won the toss and elected to bowl.","content":"Pakistan captain Shan Masood has elected to send Australia in to bat after winning the Boxing Day Test toss. After losing to Australia by 360 runs in the opening Test of the Benaud-Qadir series in Perth, the hosts will get another opportunity to pile on runs batting first. David Warner, who is playing his second last match before Test retirement, plundered 164 on the first day at Optus Stadium to set the tone for Australia's commanding victory. Despite rain expected to fall on Tuesday, play is expected start on time, but the forecast is for conditions to worsen during the day. \"Just having looked at the MCG Tests for the past three years the bowling side has done well,\" Masood said. \"There's been a bit of weather around so we'd just like to avail every opportunity with the ball.\" Australia captain Pat Cummins confirmed he would have bowled first as he chose to do during the last two MCG Tests. \"This year's pitch feels a little bit harder than previous years,\" he said. \"There's a bit of grass, a bit of cloud cover but we're not too upset to have a bat.\" While Australia go into the match unchanged, the tourists have made three changes, including swapping wicketkeepers. Mohammad Rizwan was surprisingly left out of the XI in the Western Australia capital as Pakistan opted for veteran Sarfaraz Ahmed instead behind the stumps. But Ahmed struggled with the bat and was not inspiring with the gloves, with Pakistan bringing in Rizwan to bat at No.6. Fast bowler Khurram Shahzad impressed on debut in Perth, but is out injured for the rest of the series and has been replaced by Mir Hamza.

He’s very passionate in his beliefs and his morals and his values. He’s not afraid to put them out there.” Usman Khawaja batting at the MCG on Boxing Day. Credit: Getty Khawaja was refused permission to wear shoes with the words “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right” before the first Test in Perth, and was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing a black arm band instead. This week the ICC refused an application compiled with Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association for Khawaja to have a dove insignia on his bat and gloves with a pointer to the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “I’m quite proud of him, actually,” said Hussey, who played with Khawaja for Australia and captained him at the Sydney Thunder. “I don’t think he’s trying to be divisive or political or anything like that. I feel as though he’s taking a humanitarian sort of view on life. “I respect what he’s done. He’s got to follow the rules that are set by the ICC, but he certainly is sticking true to what he believes in. And I think that’s the sort of guy he is, and certainly [has been] throughout his whole career. “You’ve got to remember this guy would have faced a lot of challenges in his career here in Australia growing up. Things have changed a lot in the last probably five to 10 years. And so for him to come through and feel like he’s confident enough to share his beliefs, I think is so critical.” Mike Hussey celebrates a century for Australia. Credit: Fairfax Khawaja was born in Pakistan and moved to Australia with his family as a young child. He is the first Muslim to play cricket for Australia and has had a remarkable late-career resurgence as an opening batsman. The 37-year-old’s initial attempt to wear messaging on his shoes in Perth without official permission from the Cricket Australia or the ICC appears to have created a roadblock for further attempts to spread his message. The writing was in the colours of a Palestinian flag. Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley alluded to this during a press conference at the MCG ahead of the opening day’s play of the Boxing Day Test. “My understanding is the context of the lead in to the Perth Test, and the context of the lead in to the making of the application [contributed to the ICC’s response]. Again, we worked with Uzzie to try and find something which was nonpartisan, non-religious, apolitical, the universally recognised symbol of peace. But I think the ICC statement calls out the broader context,” Hockley said on Tuesday. Usman Khawaja trains for the Boxing Day Test wearing shoes with a black dove on them. Credit: Getty “We didn’t speak yesterday. We spoke the day before and I think over the last week or so we’ve been working really constructively with Uzzie to find a way that [was] nonpartisan, I think that symbol is universally recognised as a symbol of peace. That being said, the ICC have got their rules. I think they explained the rationale really clearly, and we respect that. “What we’ve been really clear about is that support, as with all our players really, to share what they believe over their own channels. I think the ICC has very clear rules in place for good reason. I think I’ve already said it on Friday when we were here at the MCG, the thing that has really had a light shone upon is just the need for consistency of following the process and consistency in applications.” The ICC and Khawaja have both declined to comment, but on Monday night Khawaja posted on his Instagram a reel of other players wearing personal symbols with the caption: “Merry Christmas everybody. Sometimes you just gotta laugh. Cya at Boxing Day. #inconsistent #doublestandards” They included Marnus Labuschagne with an Eagle on his bat pointing to a bible verse.","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:59:30","image_url":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3062397162348917%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_jpg/d81ace93e5159b155b7d7266b5a6937608f11fce","source_id":"theage","source_priority":62533,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0574f16f87ffac87e7a536cc09c76a75","title":"Live: The countdown is on for the start of the Sydney to Hobart","link":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-26/sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race-live-blog/103265010","keywords":["Sport","Sailing"],"creator":["Andrew McGarry"],"video_url":null,"description":"The fleet is gathering on Sydney Harbour for the start of the blue water classic, with weather forecasts predicting a difficult trip south to Hobart.

First up is South Africa in a two-match away Test series, a country which India has found hard to succeed in and there lies the motivation - chance to become the first squad that wins a Test series in the rainbow nation. But can India do it? India's recent performances outside Asia in Test cricket haven't been great lately. The Indian team lost the series to the Proteas two years ago 1-2 before losing the rescheduled fifth Test against England after which they won in the Caribbean 1-0 but lost the World Test Championship final, twice in a row. The two-time WTC finalists have hit the transition button as far as the Test team is concerned and the glimpses of it were on display against the West Indies but South Africa will be a different animal altogether and Centurion is a venue that India likes. However, this time around Centurion has been a bit gloomy with all the rain in the past few days and it seems a similar weather will seep into the Boxing Day Test as well. As per Accuweather, there is a probability of precipitation of 92 percent on Tuesday morning, which reduced slightly to 80 percent in the afternoon. However, there is a probability of thunderstorms as well it is likely that Day 1 might be entirely washed out or even if the play happens, it might be restricted to a couple of hours or even less. Similarly on Day 2 as well, the rain percentage is as high as 90 and hence the showers might play a major role on Wednesday, December 27 as well. The forecast, however, improves on the third day, which is December 28 (Thursday). The temperatures will hover around a high of 22 degrees and a low of 13 degrees, which means it will be cool throughout the day but the rain might dampen the spirits on the Boxing Day. The players and fans will hope that they can get the maximum play in the first two days before hopefully the normal service resumes third day onwards.","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:45:01","image_url":"https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2023/12/76278-1703521431.jpg","source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"84e31617924ec52da232a6772a03b9df","title":"Contested, unbelievable, age-old: what are the definitive backyard cricket rules?","link":"https://www.braidwoodtimes.com.au/story/8470236/reviving-interest-in-cricket-with-boxing-day-backyard-games/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":["Karen Hardy"],"video_url":null,"description":"Forget Melbourne, the real cricket happens at home.","content":"If Cricket Australia is serious about getting this once proud cricketing nation interested in the game again then it should focus on the most important day on the calendar - Boxing Day.

After losing to Australia by 360 runs in the opening Test of the Benaud-Qadir series in Perth, the hosts will get another opportunity to pile on runs batting first. David Warner, who is playing his second last match before Test retirement, plundered 164 on the first day at Optus Stadium to set the tone for Australia's commanding victory. Despite rain expected to fall on Tuesday, play is expected start on time, but the forecast is for conditions to worsen during the day. \"Just having looked at the MCG Tests for the past three years the bowling side has done well,\" Masood said. \"There's been a bit of weather around so we'd just like to avail every opportunity with the ball.\" Australia captain Pat Cummins confirmed he would have bowled first as he chose to do during the last two MCG Tests. \"This year's pitch feels a little bit harder than previous years,\" he said. \"There's a bit of grass, a bit of cloud cover but we're not too upset to have a bat.\" While Australia go into the match unchanged, the tourists have made three changes, including swapping wicketkeepers. Mohammad Rizwan was surprisingly left out of the XI in the Western Australia capital as Pakistan opted for veteran Sarfaraz Ahmed instead behind the stumps. But Ahmed struggled with the bat and was not inspiring with the gloves, with Pakistan bringing in Rizwan to bat at No.6. Fast bowler Khurram Shahzad impressed on debut in Perth, but is out injured for the rest of the series and has been replaced by Mir Hamza.

He’s very passionate in his beliefs and his morals and his values. He’s not afraid to put them out there.” Usman Khawaja batting at the MCG on Boxing Day. Credit: Getty Khawaja was refused permission to wear shoes with the words “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right” before the first Test in Perth, and was reprimanded by the ICC for wearing a black arm band instead. This week the ICC refused an application compiled with Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association for Khawaja to have a dove insignia on his bat and gloves with a pointer to the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “I’m quite proud of him, actually,” said Hussey, who played with Khawaja for Australia and captained him at the Sydney Thunder. “I don’t think he’s trying to be divisive or political or anything like that. I feel as though he’s taking a humanitarian sort of view on life. “I respect what he’s done. He’s got to follow the rules that are set by the ICC, but he certainly is sticking true to what he believes in. And I think that’s the sort of guy he is, and certainly [has been] throughout his whole career. “You’ve got to remember this guy would have faced a lot of challenges in his career here in Australia growing up. Things have changed a lot in the last probably five to 10 years. And so for him to come through and feel like he’s confident enough to share his beliefs, I think is so critical.” Mike Hussey celebrates a century for Australia. Credit: Fairfax Khawaja was born in Pakistan and moved to Australia with his family as a young child. He is the first Muslim to play cricket for Australia and has had a remarkable late-career resurgence as an opening batsman. The 37-year-old’s initial attempt to wear messaging on his shoes in Perth without official permission from the Cricket Australia or the ICC appears to have created a roadblock for further attempts to spread his message. The writing was in the colours of a Palestinian flag. Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley alluded to this during a press conference at the MCG ahead of the opening day’s play of the Boxing Day Test. “My understanding is the context of the lead in to the Perth Test, and the context of the lead in to the making of the application [contributed to the ICC’s response]. Again, we worked with Uzzie to try and find something which was nonpartisan, non-religious, apolitical, the universally recognised symbol of peace. But I think the ICC statement calls out the broader context,” Hockley said on Tuesday. Usman Khawaja trains for the Boxing Day Test wearing shoes with a black dove on them. Credit: Getty “We didn’t speak yesterday. We spoke the day before and I think over the last week or so we’ve been working really constructively with Uzzie to find a way that [was] nonpartisan, I think that symbol is universally recognised as a symbol of peace. That being said, the ICC have got their rules. I think they explained the rationale really clearly, and we respect that. “What we’ve been really clear about is that support, as with all our players really, to share what they believe over their own channels. I think the ICC has very clear rules in place for good reason. I think I’ve already said it on Friday when we were here at the MCG, the thing that has really had a light shone upon is just the need for consistency of following the process and consistency in applications.” The ICC and Khawaja have both declined to comment, but on Monday night Khawaja posted on his Instagram a reel of other players wearing personal symbols with the caption: “Merry Christmas everybody. Sometimes you just gotta laugh. Cya at Boxing Day. #inconsistent #doublestandards” They included Marnus Labuschagne with an Eagle on his bat pointing to a bible verse.","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:59:30","image_url":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3062397162348917%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_jpg/d81ace93e5159b155b7d7266b5a6937608f11fce","source_id":"theage","source_priority":62533,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"0574f16f87ffac87e7a536cc09c76a75","title":"Live: The countdown is on for the start of the Sydney to Hobart","link":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-26/sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race-live-blog/103265010","keywords":["Sport","Sailing"],"creator":["Andrew McGarry"],"video_url":null,"description":"The fleet is gathering on Sydney Harbour for the start of the blue water classic, with weather forecasts predicting a difficult trip south to Hobart.

First up is South Africa in a two-match away Test series, a country which India has found hard to succeed in and there lies the motivation - chance to become the first squad that wins a Test series in the rainbow nation. But can India do it? India's recent performances outside Asia in Test cricket haven't been great lately. The Indian team lost the series to the Proteas two years ago 1-2 before losing the rescheduled fifth Test against England after which they won in the Caribbean 1-0 but lost the World Test Championship final, twice in a row. The two-time WTC finalists have hit the transition button as far as the Test team is concerned and the glimpses of it were on display against the West Indies but South Africa will be a different animal altogether and Centurion is a venue that India likes. However, this time around Centurion has been a bit gloomy with all the rain in the past few days and it seems a similar weather will seep into the Boxing Day Test as well. As per Accuweather, there is a probability of precipitation of 92 percent on Tuesday morning, which reduced slightly to 80 percent in the afternoon. However, there is a probability of thunderstorms as well it is likely that Day 1 might be entirely washed out or even if the play happens, it might be restricted to a couple of hours or even less. Similarly on Day 2 as well, the rain percentage is as high as 90 and hence the showers might play a major role on Wednesday, December 27 as well. The forecast, however, improves on the third day, which is December 28 (Thursday). The temperatures will hover around a high of 22 degrees and a low of 13 degrees, which means it will be cool throughout the day but the rain might dampen the spirits on the Boxing Day. The players and fans will hope that they can get the maximum play in the first two days before hopefully the normal service resumes third day onwards.","pubDate":"2023-12-26 00:45:01","image_url":"https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2023/12/76278-1703521431.jpg","source_id":"indiatvnews","source_priority":10055,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"84e31617924ec52da232a6772a03b9df","title":"Contested, unbelievable, age-old: what are the definitive backyard cricket rules?","link":"https://www.braidwoodtimes.com.au/story/8470236/reviving-interest-in-cricket-with-boxing-day-backyard-games/?src=rss","keywords":null,"creator":["Karen Hardy"],"video_url":null,"description":"Forget Melbourne, the real cricket happens at home.","content":"If Cricket Australia is serious about getting this once proud cricketing nation interested in the game again then it should focus on the most important day on the calendar - Boxing Day. But forget all about the Melbourne Test Match against Pakistan, and instead turn their attention to the backyards of everyday Australians. Anyone who's ever faced a 17-year-old nephew who's just made the school first XI or run out their missus, knows that this is where the real cricket is being played this summer. Australians have been playing backyard cricket since backyards were invented. Some form of the game was probably played well before that too. Indeed, some experts believe children living in Norman times in the dense woodlands of south-east England invented the game, finding a small clearing to play in. Kind of like a medieval backyard. One can only assume they had the same arguments about rules as today's backyard cricketers. Perhaps the Norman children had to deal with uncles drunk on mead coming off a short run. Was over the castle wall six and out? If the ball hit a passing stag was that an instant 50 runs? While , it was only several years ago I was covering the Canberra Comets in the Mercantile Mutual Cup. I reached out to my mate Merv Hughes (I figure if we've been dancing on the same dance floor in Ballarat then that makes us friends.) His favourite backyard cricket rule is one-hand one-bounce. Merv was pretty nimble for a big guy and I can just imagine him scrambling for the ball as it bounced awkwardly off the gutter. Sports editor Chris Dutton, who pads away all my requests to resume said career like Shane Watson, grew up in Wagga and had a homeground rule that seems unbelievable. There was a dog door, he says, but it was around the corner and on the other side of the garden but if you hit it in there it was an instant century. He thinks his brother managed to do it once so they changed the rule. Another colleague, Paul Woodhams, had a good take on the over the fence being six and out, instead you lost 10 runs off your total and you had to go fetch it. Anyone who's been following Sportsbet's social media backyard cricket campaign knows the sport means a lot this time of year. From the s, to the before presents are even opened. I'm thinking of joining the I've got a decade at least until I'm being bounced by my future grandchildren. Not in my house Kyle, I'll be seeing them like Glenn Maxwell in Mumbai. Thanks for bringing those pies for lunch. You can't bat until you've bowled at least one over and fielded for three hours. Even if its 40C with 90 per cent humidity. RIP Dean Jones. No video reviews. The game's been ruined by the technology. Even if someone is videoing it for socials. There is no second chance. Unless it's that whiny nephew who gets out first ball and has a complete tantrum. You're not rewarding him just giving Uncle Darren another chance to bowl one closer to his head. No one, not even nan, gets to be wicket keeper. Any snick is out. Electric wickie is in play the whole innings. Even if you've got one of those cool eskies with the stumps in it. If the ball touches any part of the wheelie bin, is it out? The old metal can was a better regulation height but they're hard to come by. Dog slobber and water from the dog's bowl is not ball tampering. Nothing comes on quicker than a damp ball of hard concrete. It's up to your family to decide whether they'll come at some duct tape on one side. And if Uncle Darren has a bottle top in his pocket who's to argue. May your summer be full of cricket and your back yard free of bindis.

Picture supplied While my own cricket reporting career feels like it was in the Norman times , it was only several years ago I was covering the Canberra Comets in the Mercantile Mutual Cup. I reached out to my mate Merv Hughes (I figure if we've been dancing on the same dance floor in Ballarat then that makes us friends.) His favourite backyard cricket rule is one-hand one-bounce. Merv was pretty nimble for a big guy and I can just imagine him scrambling for the ball as it bounced awkwardly off the gutter. Cricket legend Merv Hughes is a backyard cricket fan. Picture by Getty Images Sports editor Chris Dutton, who pads away all my requests to resume said career like Shane Watson, grew up in Wagga and had a homeground rule that seems unbelievable. There was a dog door, he says, but it was around the corner and on the other side of the garden but if you hit it in there it was an instant century. He thinks his brother managed to do it once so they changed the rule. Another colleague, Paul Woodhams, had a good take on the over the fence being six and out, instead you lost 10 runs off your total and you had to go fetch it. Anyone who's been following Sportsbet's social media backyard cricket campaign knows the sport means a lot this time of year. From the defensive shot practice with the wrapping paper roll s, to the Christmas morning pitch inspection before presents are even opened. I'm thinking of joining the Nan's Batting Academy. I've got a decade at least until I'm being bounced by my future grandchildren. Not in my house Kyle, I'll be seeing them like Glenn Maxwell in Mumbai. Thanks for bringing those pies for lunch. Here are some of our favourite backyard cricket rules, tell us yours. You can't bat until you've bowled at least one over and fielded for three hours. Even if its 40C with 90 per cent humidity. RIP Dean Jones. Should this be classified as ball tampering or should it be allowed? Picture supplied No video reviews. The game's been ruined by the technology. Even if someone is videoing it for socials. There is no second chance. Unless it's that whiny nephew who gets out first ball and has a complete tantrum. You're not rewarding him just giving Uncle Darren another chance to bowl one closer to his head. No one, not even nan, gets to be wicket keeper. Any snick is out. Electric wickie is in play the whole innings. Even if you've got one of those cool eskies with the stumps in it. The wheelie bin is a useful replacement for the stumps. Picture supplied If the ball touches any part of the wheelie bin, is it out? The old metal can was a better regulation height but they're hard to come by. Dog slobber and water from the dog's bowl is not ball tampering. Nothing comes on quicker than a damp ball of hard concrete. It's up to your family to decide whether they'll come at some duct tape on one side. And if Uncle Darren has a bottle top in his pocket who's to argue. May your summer be full of cricket and your back yard free of bindis.

Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw are all vying to fill the opening spot Warner will vacate when he retires after the SCG Test against Pakistan in January. Other options include moving one of Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne or Mitch Marsh to opener, which would allow allrounder Cameron Green to return for two home Tests against West Indies in January. But Marsh has found form batting at No.6 and declared he does not want to open the batting, while Hussey urged caution against forcing players up the order. Hussey went the other way, the West Australian left-hander growing up as a specialist opener before making his mark in Test cricket in Australia's middle order. \"Opening is one of the toughest jobs in the game,\" Hussey told reporters on Tuesday after it was confirmed he would be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. \"So for me personally, if I was selecting, I'd be going for a traditional, proper opener - someone who's done it for a long period of time - because if you haven't done it much in your first-class career, it's going to be very difficult to to come up the order. \"I'm not saying you can't do it, and maybe someone could evolve into doing that role, but I think it would be difficult for a player like Mitch Marsh. \"I know there's been talk about him going up the order, I think he's probably more suited, much like Travis, to be in the middle order. \"I think that'd be the best for the balance of the Australian team.\" Harris was a member of Australia's 2023 Ashes touring squad and boosted his hopes of succeeding Warner with a century for Victoria in a tour match against Pakistan last week. Renshaw played two Tests in India earlier this year, while Bancroft has been on the outer since playing the last of his 10 Tests back in 2019, against England at Lord's.

After losing to Australia by 360 runs in the opening Test of the Benaud-Qadir series in Perth, the hosts will get another opportunity to pile on runs batting first. David Warner, who is playing his second last match before Test retirement, plundered 164 on the first day at Optus Stadium to set the tone for Australia's commanding victory. Despite rain expected to fall on Tuesday, play is expected start on time, but the forecast is for conditions to worsen during the day. \"Just having looked at the MCG Tests for the past three years the bowling side has done well,\" Masood said. \"There's been a bit of weather around so we'd just like to avail every opportunity with the ball.\" Australia captain Pat Cummins confirmed he would have bowled first as he chose to do during the last two MCG Tests. \"This year's pitch feels a little bit harder than previous years,\" he said. \"There's a bit of grass, a bit of cloud cover but we're not too upset to have a bat.\" While Australia go into the match unchanged, the tourists have made three changes, including swapping wicketkeepers. Mohammad Rizwan was surprisingly left out of the XI in the Western Australia capital as Pakistan opted for veteran Sarfaraz Ahmed instead behind the stumps. But Ahmed struggled with the bat and was not inspiring with the gloves, with Pakistan bringing in Rizwan to bat at No.6. Fast bowler Khurram Shahzad impressed on debut in Perth, but is out injured for the rest of the series and has been replaced by Mir Hamza. AUSTRALIA: David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (capt), Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.
