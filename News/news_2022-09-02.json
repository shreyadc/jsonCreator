It is where I played much of my first-class cricket, it is where I umpired SANFL grand finals, and it is somewhere I have absolutely loved coming to during my time in the media.“My late father took me to the ground when I was 12 to join the Adelaide Cricket Club, where they played their home games and were coached by the late Clarrie Grimmett, and to think that 71 years later I’ve been honoured in this fashion has blown me completely and utterly out of the water.“The media centre has been home to so many fantastic sports journalists in South Australia, so to be recognised with this honour means everything to me.”Cunningham, 83, played 97 first-class matches for South Australia as a batting all-rounder from 1960-61 to 1974-75, captaining the team seven times and being a member of three Sheffield Shield-winning teams.He also was a SANFL field umpire from 1961-67, officiating in four grand finals.Cunningham then went on to become one of South Australia’s most respected sports commentators, where he became famous for his catchcry “Strike me pink’’.He was also an inaugural inductee into the Adelaide Oval Media Hall of Fame in 2016.","pubDate":"2022-09-01 23:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Finch defends his position as captain despite form slump","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/finch-defends-his-position-as-captain-despite-form-slump/video/80201b35a19164bd6f8cb4fb4d43f891","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Aaron Finch has received the backing of Cricket Australia despite a prolonged form slump from the white ball captain.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-01 23:00:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sri Lanka in Asia Cup win over Bangladesh","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-in-asia-cup-win-over-bangladesh-c-8090828","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sri Lanka have pulled off a sensational two-wicket victory over Bangladesh to advance to the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup T20 cricket event.","content":"Sri Lanka have pulled off a sensational two-wicket victory over Bangladesh and advanced to the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup. In a must-win final Group B game on Thursday, Sri Lanka's tail-enders held their nerve to reach 8-184 for their second-highest successful run-chase in a T20 international. Needing 13 off the last seven balls, No.9 batter and debutant fast bowler Asitha Fernando (10 not out) smacked two crucial boundaries to end Bangladesh's run in the tournament even after they had posted a decent 7-183. \"When Chamika (Karunaratne) was run out, I thought the game was done, but Asitha Fernando's two shots were great,\" said Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka. Afghanistan had already topped Group B with two convincing wins against both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh had only themselves to blame for ill-disciplined bowling, conceding eight wides and four no-balls to ruin the early good work of their batters. \"Death bowling is something we are looking to improve and that has cost us the game,\" Bangladesh's skipper Shakib Al Hasan said. \"The last two overs they were eight down, needed to get 17-18 runs and they got with a lot of balls to spare.\" Fast bowler Ebadot Hossain (3-51) did the early damage for Bangladesh through his sharp, short-pitched deliveries, but conceded 17 runs in the penultimate over that included a boundary off a no-ball. Opening batter Kusal Mendis top-scored with 60 off 37 balls, but got a number of reprieves before he had scored his half century. Wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim couldn't hold on to Mendis's healthy edge in the second over before the opener got caught behind only to see the offspinner Mahedi Hasan had overstepped. Bangladesh didn't go for the television referral when Mendis clearly gloved a catch to Musfiqur down the leg side and he also survived a run-out before reaching his half-century. Despite all these let-offs, Bangladesh came back strongly when Taskin Ahmed took two splendid catches at third man that included a crucial diving catch to get rid of Mendis in the 14th over. Shanaka smashed 45 off 33 balls and contributed a 54-run stand with Mendis before getting caught at long on in the 18th over off Hasan. But Sri Lanka's tail wagged to snatch a nail-biting victory with four balls to spare when Hasan bowled a no-ball and Fernando ran for two runs. Earlier, Bangladesh's middle and lower order did well by smacking 60 off the last five overs. Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who opened the innings, provided a rollicking start with a knock of 38 off 26 balls. But it was Afif Hossain's brilliant 39 off 22 deliveries, well supported by Mahmudullah's 27 and Mosaddek Hossain's unbeaten 24 off nine balls, which gave Bangladesh a perfect finish. Sri Lanka's key legspinner Wanindu Hasaranga, who got rid of Mehidy in his first over soon after the batting powerplay, took 2-41 and fast bowler Karunaratne picked up 2-32. Pakistan will take on Hong Kong in the last Group A game on Friday, India having already topped the group after beating both Pakistan and Hong Kong.","pubDate":"2022-09-01 19:33:02","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-8090828/2fee1d1a65ffe10f21bb62ca32e5ff6886d3a702-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BAL vs SIN Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing XIs, Player Stats, Pitch Report for National T20 Cup, Match 7","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/bal-vs-sin-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-xis-player-stats-pitch-report-national-t20-cup-match-7?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Adarsh Tabhane"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-01 19:23:40","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/09/610e3-16620549507095-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ranking India's 3 most important players in T20I cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/ranking-india-s-3-important-players-t20i-cricket-ahead-t20-world-cup?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Sai Krishna"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Team India are enjoying a good run in T20I cricket under Rohit Sharma, whose captaincy tenure has been practically spotless so far. The Men in Blue recently cruised into the Super 4 stage of the 2022 Asia Cup with wins over Pakistan and Hong Kong, and are definitely the favorites to clinch the continental crown. India are also among the favorites for the T20 World Cup, to be held in Australia later this year. Most teams are close to finalizing their squads for the marquee ICC event, with the hosts having named a formidable 15-man squad. Most of India's 15 pick themselves, even if a few places are still up for grabs. Surprisingly, India have reached a place where some of their longest-serving players might not be the ideal personnel for the T20 World Cup. Former skipper Virat Kohli's attacking game against spin has deteriorated to such an extent that there are questions over his place in the side, while KL Rahul has steadfastly refused to change his outdated approach to batting in the shortest format. In this article, we attempt to rank India's three most important players in T20I cricket. The players' skillsets, combined with the availability of replacements, have been taken into account. It might be a surprise to see Jasprit Bumrah at #3 on this list. Undoubtedly one of the best all-format bowlers in the world, the speedster is worth his weight in gold in T20 cricket. He guarantees economical overs and wicket-taking threat at any stage of the innings, with his unmatched prowess at the death having won India many games over the years. Bumrah is facing a race against time to be fit for the T20 World Cup, having been ruled out of the Asia Cup due to injury. His skillset will be crucial for the Men in Blue in Australia, especially with other experienced pacers like Mohammad Shami no longer in the T20I picture. Bumrah is invaluable to the Indian team, even if they have a few capable death bowlers in the form of Harshal Patel (who is also recovering from injury) and Arshdeep Singh. The four overs he bowls simply cannot be replaced by any other player, but the two men who follow are arguably more important. It might seem strange to claim that a man who has played only 25 T20Is in his career is India's second-most important player in the format, but that's just what Suryakumar Yadav is. Having amassed 758 runs in these matches at an average of 39.89 and a strike rate of 177.52, the stylish right-hander is the team's man for all seasons and situations. Suryakumar has taken to T20I cricket like a duck to water, playing a plethora of crucial cameos and even converting a few of his starts into big scores. He has been able to get going from the word \"go\" against all types of bowling, even when his peers have struggled to put bat to ball. Amid a top four that struggles to put their foot on the pedal against spin, the 31-year-old's outrageous range of strokes and dextrous wrists stand out. India simply can't do without Suryakumar right now. He is the man who injects the most momentum into the innings, and he is the man whose game can be trusted to come good against any opposition. Other middle-order batters like Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Deepak Hooda and Sanju Samson have their strengths, but unlike Suryakumar, they have clear weaknesses. SKY is irreplaceable. Was there any doubt as to who'd top the list? Ever since making his return from injury on the back of a title-winning Indian Premier League season as the captain of the Gujarat Titans, Hardik Pandya has soon molded himself into India's most important player in T20I cricket. India don't have anyone who can bring to the table what Hardik does. Four overs at various stages of the innings, accurate short-pitched bowling to produce wickets when the pitches aren't overly helpful, electric fielding all around the park, six-hitting at will, prowess against both spin and pace on both sides of the wicket - the 28-year-old can do it all. The closest India can come to replacing Hardik is either Deepak Chahar or Shardul Thakur, but the duo's batting is not even on the same planet. On recent form, even their bowling may not come close. The Men in Blue need to wrap Hardik up in cotton wool and treat him with utmost care, for the T20I side will crumble instantly without him. Q. Who is more important to India's T20I side?

The loss sent Bangladesh out of the tournament. Chasing 184, Sri Lanka required 34 runs off the last three overs. Bangladesh pacer Ebadot Hossain, making his T20I debut, conceded 17 runs in the 19th over to let the advantage slip. After being put in to bat, Bangladesh rode on handy knocks from Mehidy Hasan (38, 26b, 2x4, 2x6), Afif Hossain (39, 22b, 4x4, 2x6) and Mosaddek Hossain (24 n.o., 9b, 4x4) to post 183 for seven against Sri Lanka in an Asia Cup Group B clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium here on Thursday. Hossain came alive in the final over, bowled by Asitha Fernando, hitting the pacer for a six and two fours. The Bangladesh batters used any pace on offer to play the paddle scoop. The Sri Lankans erred by keeping fine-leg inside the circle and spraying it down the leg. Spinner Maheesh Theekshana, brought into the attack in the second over, was the pick of the bowlers. Theekshana’s spin and pace variations presented a puzzle, one which the Bangladesh batters struggled to solve. He cleaned up captain Shakib Al Hasan, who made room for an inside-out hit but missed the ball completely. Fellow spinner Wanindu Hasaranga picked up two wickets, but proved to be expensive. Fast bowler Fernando, making his T20I debut, went for 51 runs in his four overs. Bangladesh was boosted by the presence of a sizeable contingent of its fans in the stadium.

During the fifth match of the ongoing Asia Cup 2022 between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at the Dubai International Stadium, Bangladesh are heading towards a challenging total after being invited to bat first, in what is a must-win match for both the sides to progress further in the race for the continental championship. Bangladesh, who have not played to their potential this year so far in the T20 format, opted to send out their 14th opening batting pair since last year, in the form of bowling all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Sabbir Rahman. While Sabbir (5 off 6) got Out cheaply, Mehidy Hasan did justify the team management’s decision with a quick fire 38 runs off 26 deliveries.

Former Pakistan batter Mohammad Hafeez has opined that Rohit Sharma is perhaps feeling the heat of the additional responsibility as team India captain, which has also led to his dip in form, particularly in the T20 format. The Rohit Sharma-led side prevailed against Hong Kong by 40 runs, in their second match of the ongoing Asia Cup 2022, and have resultantly qualified for the ‘Super 4’ stage of the tournament. Suryakumar Yadav’s scintillating half-century knock was the difference between the two sides, as India’s young pacers Avesh Khan and Arshdeep Singh leaked runs at an Economy rate of 13.2 and 11 runs per Over respectively, to let Hong Kong register the highest score by an associate nation against India in the T20 format. Mohammad Hafeez reckons Rohit Sharma’s unusual body language might hamper his sustenance as captain Perhaps unimpressed and disappointed by the effort put in by his two pacers in particular, Rohit, despite his team’s 40-run victory, shook the opposition team’s hands without wearing the winning smile, and also didn’t look enthusiastic enough with the team progressing towards the next stage of the championship. Mohammad Hafeez, however, seemed to have noticed some more intangibles with the way Rohit walked off the field post the victory, suggestive of a captaincy pressure, which has also led to a dip in batting form since assuming the role a few months ago. Hafeez also opined that the 35-year-old even looked nervous, weak, and confused when he walked on to the field for the Toss, and that his overall body language might not let him continue as India’s T20 captain for long. “Look at Rohit Sharma’s expressions. This, after he has won the match by 40 runs. Earlier, as well, when he came out for the Toss, I felt he looked weak, nervous, and confused. He was not the same which I have observed of him all these years. I think his captaincy pressure is creating lots of problems for him. His personal form has also declined, if we look at his numbers in this year’s IPL and the T20I matches post that. Also, the pressure of leading India. He has been saying a lot of things about brand of cricket, we will play positively… this and that, but it’s not reflecting in the way the team is playing. It’s not reflecting by his own body language. It’s easy to talk but to do it and show it on the field is difficult.

He has scored more than 30 runs in subsequent T20 matches. In this case, let’s see what former cricketers Gautam Gambhir and Inzamam-ul-Haq said about it. Virat Kohli is known as the run machine of the international cricket field. His run chase continued in all three formats. However, his performance has faded in the last few years. The question arose as to when he would score a century. Recently there have been positive and negative comments about his performance. It is in this context that he has added 35 and 59* runs in successive matches in the ongoing Asia Cup series. It is noteworthy that he played the first match against Pakistan. What did Inzamam say? – “The way he played in these two matches impressed me a lot. He is determined to give back. His recovery from his tough phase is a good time for the Indian team. Cricket fans around the world want him to add runs and continue his form. All the dominant players in international cricket have gone through it. A series or a month is enough for them to get back to form,” said former Pakistan captain Inzamam. What did Gambhir say? – “I hope Kohli’s confidence will be boosted by the good start he got in the Asia Cup. No matter what you do in net practice, the confidence you get from adding runs on the field is of a different kind. Who is the opponent here? The runs he has scored and the time he has spent on the field are important. We can see his quality performance in the coming days,” said Gambhir.","pubDate":"2022-09-01 15:06:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bangladesh cricket controversy: What is Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka controversy in Asia Cup 2022?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-bangladesh-cricket-controversy-what-is-bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-controversy-in-asia-cup-2022/","keywords":["Cricket","asia cup","Asia Cup 2022","Bangladesh","Sri Lanka"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka controversy: The two teams are playing a knockout match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

One of their three changes for Asia Cup 2022 Match 5 against Sri Lanka in Dubai, Bangladesh all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz has not only justified his batting promotion but also provided a much-needed brisk start to the team. Having dropped both their opening batters from the previous match against Afghanistan on Tuesday, Bangladesh did lose an early wicket in the form of Sabbir Rahman (5) but Miraz scoring 38 (26) with the help of two fours and sixes each played a key role in them scoring 55/1 in the powerplay. With Sri Lanka all-rounder Wanindu Hasarange making an instant impact by dismissing Miraz right after the powerplay and former captain Mushfiqur Rahim (4) getting out cheaply, the onus to build an innings now lies with captain Shakib Al Hasan. What is Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka controversy in Asia Cup 2022? A primary reason why this Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh match promises to be a close contest is because the loser will be knocked out of the competition. Although a league match, the situation at the points table is such that only the winner of this match will qualify for Super 4. If a comparatively younger Sri Lanka-Bangladesh rivalry wasn’t enough to enhance the build-up of this match, Bangladesh team director Khaled Mahmud responding to Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka’s comments acted as fuel to fire. It all had started with Shanaka claiming Bangladesh to be a less dangerous team than Afghanistan primarily due to the presence of only two world-class bowlers in spinner Shakib and pacer Mustafizur Rahman. Mahmud, who didn’t shy away from giving it back to Shanaka in style, stated that Sri Lanka don’t even have two world-class bowlers in their current squad. Looks like it’s time for @OfficialSLC bowlers to show the class and batters to show who they are on the field..#AsiaCup2022 https://t.co/txWm7wH4nC — Mahela Jayawardena (@MahelaJay) August 31, 2022 Subsequent snowball reactions across social media platforms including that of former and current cricketers from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh converted the whole situation into a controversy.

The inaugural edition of the Legends League Cricket was played in January 2022 in Al Amerat. The second edition will be played across six different cities in India. The league, which is set to be a 16-match affair, will start at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata followed by Lucknow, New Delhi, Cuttack and Jodhpur.

Cricket Australia have announced their 15-men squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2022. Australia’s aim would be to retain their title in their home conditions, and the squad looks really strong as well considering the home conditions. There are familiar places in the squad, apart from the inclusion of Tim David. David has earned his maiden Australian call-up, and he will be travelling to India as well before the T20 World Cup. He has emerged as a T20 specialist and his finishing abilities have earned his praises from all around the world. David has scored 2640 T20 runs in 122 matches at a strike-rate of 164.17. Tim David elated on Australia’s T20 World Cup callup Tim David was released from Western Australia’s rookie contract in 2019, which presented him with an opportunity to play for his birth country Singapore. After playing with Singapore, he decided that he will just play T20 cricket in the future, and the opportunity with Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL turned his fortunes. He said that he has been playing a lot of T20 cricket around the world, and he is absolutely elated about being selected in Australia’s T20 World Cup squad. It is interesting that George Bailey wanted to select David in Australia’s team for the Sri Lanka T20Is, but he decided to play in the PSL to get regular game time. “My first opportunity after being released by Western Australia was to go and play for Singapore, so went and did that then came back at the opportunity to go to the [Hobart] Hurricanes,” Tim David said. “It may look unorthodox but I’ve been out playing a lot of T20 cricket and really stoked to be getting to this point.” Tim David’s selection to Australia’s T20 World Cup squad is further proof of the different pathways emerging in world cricket for players to make it to their national teams. Surely there’ll be more like him to come. And it’s a good thing #T20WorldCup — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) August 31, 2022 Australian selector George Bailey called Tim David a start of the BBL. He insists that people generally look at the top run-scoring chart at the end of the tournament, but the ability to finish the innings and score 20 runs in 12 balls is a highly rated ability. “He’s (Tim David) been a star of the Big Bash for some time,” Bailey said. “If you look at franchise and international teams around the world the ability to finish an innings, whether that’s two, 12 or 20 balls, is highly sought after.” The post “Really stoked to be getting to this point”: Tim David elated on being selected in Australia’s ICC T20 World Cup 2022 squad appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-09-01 12:54:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former India openers to opponents: Virender Sehwag to take on Gautam Gambhir in Legends League Cricket, Know more here","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/former-india-openers-to-opponents-virender-sehwag-to-take-on-gautam-gambhir-in-legends-league-cricket-know-more-here-2504635.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The legendary Sehwag has always been fans’ favourite because of the carefree and swashbuckling way he batted.
