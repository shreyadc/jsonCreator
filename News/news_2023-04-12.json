The World Cup is likely to start on October 5, with 46 matches set to be held across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati, Hyderabad and Dharamasala. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai,” a source close to ICC Board told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” the source added. Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the tournament is still under wraps as geopolitics cloud the buildup to the showpiece event. The delay is in stark contrast to the 2019 event, when the dates and venues for the tournament in England and Wales were announced more than a year out in keeping with usual practice for major sporting events. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has previously co-hosted three ODI World Cups and organising the 10-team event in October-November should present no major difficulties for the world’s richest board. However, soured political relations between India and Pakistan, who play each other only in multi-team events, have complicated matters. India have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and are likely to play their matches at a neutral venue after organisers agreed on a ‘hybrid’ model — a move that looks likely to prompt a titfor-tat response. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied media reports that it had made a similar demand at the ICC board meetings in Dubai last month but in a statement last week said it may push for the hybrid model “at the proper ICC forum at the right time”. Should Pakistan agree to travel to India, the BCCI would have to secure visa clearance from the Indian government. A source with direct knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that moving matches out of India had not even been discussed and the fixtures would be announced in “due course”.","pubDate":"2023-04-11 23:50:16","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-12/pcb-prefers-two-venues-for-world-cup-matches-in-india-1681257005-6931.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies U-19 cricketers to Sri Lanka after two decades","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/West-Indies-U-19-cricketers-to-Sri-Lanka-after-two-decades/23-747313","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"West Indies Under-19 cricketers are due to make a tour of Sri Lanka after almost two decades in July-August. The tour is part of Sri Lanka’s preparations for the ICC Under-19 World Cup, which Sri Lanka are the hosts. West Indies are due to play Sri Lanka in an Under-19 series consisting of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs. It will be the first time that these two countries will be involved in playing 4-day tests. Bilateral ODIs they have played before a long time back as far as 2004 when West Indies and Sri Lanka drew a four-match ODI series 2-all in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was led by all-rounder Farveez Maharoof and West Indies by wicket-keeper/batsman Denesh Ramdin. That series produced players in the caliber of Maharoof, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara and Kaushal Silva who went onto represent Sri Lanka at international level, and Ramdin, Xavier Marshall, Assad Fudadin, Lendl Simmons, Kirk Edwards, and Lionel Baker for West Indies. Between 1988 and 2022, Sri Lanka and West Indies have played 15 Under-19 ODIs of which Sri Lanka have won 8 and West Indies 7. Sri Lanka Under-19 are also scheduled to go to Pakistan in November for a series of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs and then participate in the Under-19 Asia Cup in Bangladesh in December before the Under19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in January 2024. “What we are trying to do is play against club teams regularly every month. We did a little bit of that before we left for UAE against the Under-23 team and against Jaffna NSL side. We have arranged for us to play against higher ranked teams – clubs and NSL every month,” said Sri Lanka Under-19 head coach Jehan Mubarak who is of the view that schoolboys who Captain their teams and the national Under-19 teams should be able to make decisions on the field rather than get help from coaches. “When I was coaching at Royal College (Colombo) they liked to be given the solution,” said Mubarak who has been in the system with schoolboys to understand their way of thinking. “I had this problem where the solution became the coaches and not the players. We can guide them but at the end of the day they have to call their game, so that when they progress to the Under-19 program they are able to make decisions on their own.” Apart from coaching Royal College for about three years Mubarak also had a stint as coach of Bloomfield. “I’ve been on the Royal College advisory committee for about 10-15 years. I understand their mindset a little bit, how they think. Also the parents are important. We need to have a chat about the players’ lifestyle. How to tackle social media, how to spend the money they get into their hands wisely and things like that.\" In Mubarak’s book, fielding is top priority. “Cricket for me is being the best fielding side. Whatever your age Sri Lanka should always be the best fielding team whether it is U-19 or the senior national team. Fielding doesn’t need a lot of skills, it just needs hard work.” “Being a good fielding side helps to lift the standard of the team. It puts pressure on the batsmen because the fielders are always in the game. The facet of becoming a good fielding team means that you have to be mentally strong. You do a lot of hard work, so you have pushed a lot of mental barriers. Even in match situations when things are not going your way, because you’ve done the hard work you don’t want to give up so easily. Also you play for each other if you have a good fielding team. You play better as a team. I could see that on the tour of the UAE.”","pubDate":"2023-04-11 20:41:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Planters Association of Ceylon, United Planters of Southern India Sports Club conducts Biennial Sports Festival","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Planters-Association-of-Ceylon--United-Planters-of-Southern-India-Sports-Club-conducts-Biennial-Sports-Festival/23-747309","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Planters Association of Ceylon (PA) and United Planters of Southern India Sports Club (UPASI SC) successfully concluded their Biennial sports festival held from 23 to 28 March 2023.

RPCs showed their colours this year by winning the annual Golf Tournament after a lapse of 20 years, with Tharindu Wickramasinghe excelling and winning the overall team winner award and clinching the title of ‘Stable Ford’. In addition, the PA team also won the Cricket and Badminton tournaments at the annual event. One of the highlights of the event was the outstanding performance by batsman Chathura Bandara, who scored a fantastic century and took home the awards for ‘Best batsman’ and ‘Man of the match’. The PA Badminton Team emerged victorious with an outstanding performance by Chamith Arthur in the Singles event while Rohan Weerakoone and Lalindra Abeywardena won in the Veteran Doubles.

Sethi said that Pakistan was willing to bear this loss of revenue as it was “a matter of principle” as far as the hosting rights of the Asia Cup are concerned. “We have made it very clear that unless the Asia Cup is held on a hybrid model like we have proposed, that is India playing its matches at an offshore venue and Pakistan hosting the remaining games at home we will not accept any other schedule and neither play,” he said. Pakistan is due to host the Asia Cup in September but uncertainty surrounds the venue of the tournament as India has made it clear it can’t play in Pakistan. Sethi has proposed a “hybrid model” to host the Asia Cup where India will play its matches at an offshore venue. “We will not lose our hosting rights,” he added. “Security is no excuse for them now and we have told them if their government is not giving them clearance to play in Pakistan show us some written proof of this,” Sethi said. “When all other teams including Australia, England, New Zealand are playing in Pakistan without any issues there should be no security concerns for India to tour Pakistan.” The PCB chairman said 80 percent of the revenues earned by the Asian Cricket Council came from Pakistan and India matches. To a question he conceded that if the ACC accepts the hybrid model for the tournament it could have a bearing on the ICC World Cup as well. Asked about a possible refusal by Pakistan to play in the World Cup, Sethi said relations with ICC were different and in such a scenario the relations could be affected negatively.

The World Cup will start tentatively on October 5, with 46 matches, including the final set to be played across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati and Hyderabad, Dharamasala. It is understood that discussions are currently on at the ICC level as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) bigwigs are in talks with a top level ICC executive on the issue, which still remains a sensitive one. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” a source close to ICC Board, tracking developments, told PTI on conditions of anonymity. The bone of contention will be the India versus Pakistan game. While Ahmedabad with 1,32,000 capacity gives ICC, the best chance to earn optimum profits but the Narendra Modi Stadium is already hosting the final, so another venue might host the game. Each team will play nine games at the league stage which will be held in round-robin format. The ICC’s Events committee, in association with host cricket board BCCI, will chalk out the final itinerary in the next few months so that it allows fans across India and other parts to plan their travel itinerary. Recently, ICC General Manager Wasim Khan, in his own capacity had told Pakistani media that the team could play its matches in Bangladesh as a part of a ‘hybrid model’ that could be followed since the Indian team is not travelling to the country for the Asia Cup. But PCB chairman Najam Sethi, back then had rubbished the idea of playing World Cup games in Bangladesh. More so, ICC had made it clear that no such proposal had come from Pakistan about ‘hybrid model’ for global tournaments. During the 2011 World Cup, Pakistan’s semi-final against India was played at Mohali, which made it logistically convenient for the fans across the border to travel through Wagah Border. However, Mohali does not figure in the 12 venues finalised by the BCCI. In 1996, the high-profile quarterfinal was held at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. A lot has changed since then and in these sensitive times, it will be very difficult to host Pakistan in some of the specific venues, including Mumbai and Dharamsala. In fact Pakistan’s 2016 World Cup match was scheduled in Dharamsala but there were apprehensions that because of the Pathankot tragedy (terrorists attacked the air base), it wasn’t a wise idea to host the match at that venue. While security will be top notch for each team, the BCCI as well as the Indian government would like to ensure that there aren’t any untoward incidents.

They have a total of four points. Their next match is against Punjab Kings on Thursday at Mohali. On his participation in IPL next year, Smith said, “Did not put my name in the auction this year as it is a big year for Australian cricket. I will put my name in next year’s auction. If someone picks me up, it will be great.” In his IPL career so far, Smith has represented teams like Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant, both of which are now defunct and Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.

Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the tournament is still under wraps as geopolitics cloud the buildup to the showpiece event. The delay is in stark contrast to the 2019 event, when the dates and venues for the tournament in England and Wales were announced more than a year out in keeping with usual practice for major sporting events. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has previously co-hosted three ODI World Cups and organising the 10-team event in October-November should present no major difficulties for the world’s richest board. However, soured political relations between India and Pakistan, who play each other only in multi-team events, have complicated matters. India have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and are likely to play their matches at a neutral venue after organisers agreed on a ‘hybrid’ model — a move that looks likely to prompt a titfor-tat response. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied media reports that it had made a similar demand at the ICC board meetings in Dubai last month but in a statement last week said it may push for the hybrid model “at the proper ICC forum at the right time”. Should Pakistan agree to travel to India, the BCCI would have to secure visa clearance from the Indian government. A source with direct knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that moving matches out of India had not even been discussed and the fixtures would be announced in “due course”.","pubDate":"2023-04-11 23:50:16","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-12/pcb-prefers-two-venues-for-world-cup-matches-in-india-1681257005-6931.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies U-19 cricketers to Sri Lanka after two decades","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/West-Indies-U-19-cricketers-to-Sri-Lanka-after-two-decades/23-747313","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"West Indies Under-19 cricketers are due to make a tour of Sri Lanka after almost two decades in July-August. The tour is part of Sri Lanka’s preparations for the ICC Under-19 World Cup, which Sri Lanka are the hosts. West Indies are due to play Sri Lanka in an Under-19 series consisting of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs. It will be the first time that these two countries will be involved in playing 4-day tests. Bilateral ODIs they have played before a long time back as far as 2004 when West Indies and Sri Lanka drew a four-match ODI series 2-all in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was led by all-rounder Farveez Maharoof and West Indies by wicket-keeper/batsman Denesh Ramdin. That series produced players in the caliber of Maharoof, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara and Kaushal Silva who went onto represent Sri Lanka at international level, and Ramdin, Xavier Marshall, Assad Fudadin, Lendl Simmons, Kirk Edwards, and Lionel Baker for West Indies. Between 1988 and 2022, Sri Lanka and West Indies have played 15 Under-19 ODIs of which Sri Lanka have won 8 and West Indies 7. Sri Lanka Under-19 are also scheduled to go to Pakistan in November for a series of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs and then participate in the Under-19 Asia Cup in Bangladesh in December before the Under19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in January 2024. “What we are trying to do is play against club teams regularly every month. We did a little bit of that before we left for UAE against the Under-23 team and against Jaffna NSL side. We have arranged for us to play against higher ranked teams – clubs and NSL every month,” said Sri Lanka Under-19 head coach Jehan Mubarak who is of the view that schoolboys who Captain their teams and the national Under-19 teams should be able to make decisions on the field rather than get help from coaches. “When I was coaching at Royal College (Colombo) they liked to be given the solution,” said Mubarak who has been in the system with schoolboys to understand their way of thinking. “I had this problem where the solution became the coaches and not the players. We can guide them but at the end of the day they have to call their game, so that when they progress to the Under-19 program they are able to make decisions on their own.” Apart from coaching Royal College for about three years Mubarak also had a stint as coach of Bloomfield. “I’ve been on the Royal College advisory committee for about 10-15 years. I understand their mindset a little bit, how they think. Also the parents are important. We need to have a chat about the players’ lifestyle. How to tackle social media, how to spend the money they get into their hands wisely and things like that.\" In Mubarak’s book, fielding is top priority. “Cricket for me is being the best fielding side. Whatever your age Sri Lanka should always be the best fielding team whether it is U-19 or the senior national team. Fielding doesn’t need a lot of skills, it just needs hard work.” “Being a good fielding side helps to lift the standard of the team. It puts pressure on the batsmen because the fielders are always in the game. The facet of becoming a good fielding team means that you have to be mentally strong. You do a lot of hard work, so you have pushed a lot of mental barriers. Even in match situations when things are not going your way, because you’ve done the hard work you don’t want to give up so easily. Also you play for each other if you have a good fielding team. You play better as a team. I could see that on the tour of the UAE.”","pubDate":"2023-04-11 20:41:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Planters Association of Ceylon, United Planters of Southern India Sports Club conducts Biennial Sports Festival","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Planters-Association-of-Ceylon--United-Planters-of-Southern-India-Sports-Club-conducts-Biennial-Sports-Festival/23-747309","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Planters Association of Ceylon (PA) and United Planters of Southern India Sports Club (UPASI SC) successfully concluded their Biennial sports festival held from 23 to 28 March 2023.

Sethi said that Pakistan was willing to bear this loss of revenue as it was “a matter of principle” as far as the hosting rights of the Asia Cup are concerned. “We have made it very clear that unless the Asia Cup is held on a hybrid model like we have proposed, that is India playing its matches at an offshore venue and Pakistan hosting the remaining games at home we will not accept any other schedule and neither play,” he said. Pakistan is due to host the Asia Cup in September but uncertainty surrounds the venue of the tournament as India has made it clear it can’t play in Pakistan. Sethi has proposed a “hybrid model” to host the Asia Cup where India will play its matches at an offshore venue. “We will not lose our hosting rights,” he added. “Security is no excuse for them now and we have told them if their government is not giving them clearance to play in Pakistan show us some written proof of this,” Sethi said. “When all other teams including Australia, England, New Zealand are playing in Pakistan without any issues there should be no security concerns for India to tour Pakistan.” The PCB chairman said 80 percent of the revenues earned by the Asian Cricket Council came from Pakistan and India matches. To a question he conceded that if the ACC accepts the hybrid model for the tournament it could have a bearing on the ICC World Cup as well. Asked about a possible refusal by Pakistan to play in the World Cup, Sethi said relations with ICC were different and in such a scenario the relations could be affected negatively.

The World Cup will start tentatively on October 5, with 46 matches, including the final set to be played across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati and Hyderabad, Dharamasala. It is understood that discussions are currently on at the ICC level as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) bigwigs are in talks with a top level ICC executive on the issue, which still remains a sensitive one. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” a source close to ICC Board, tracking developments, told PTI on conditions of anonymity. The bone of contention will be the India versus Pakistan game. While Ahmedabad with 1,32,000 capacity gives ICC, the best chance to earn optimum profits but the Narendra Modi Stadium is already hosting the final, so another venue might host the game. Each team will play nine games at the league stage which will be held in round-robin format. The ICC’s Events committee, in association with host cricket board BCCI, will chalk out the final itinerary in the next few months so that it allows fans across India and other parts to plan their travel itinerary. Recently, ICC General Manager Wasim Khan, in his own capacity had told Pakistani media that the team could play its matches in Bangladesh as a part of a ‘hybrid model’ that could be followed since the Indian team is not travelling to the country for the Asia Cup. But PCB chairman Najam Sethi, back then had rubbished the idea of playing World Cup games in Bangladesh. More so, ICC had made it clear that no such proposal had come from Pakistan about ‘hybrid model’ for global tournaments. During the 2011 World Cup, Pakistan’s semi-final against India was played at Mohali, which made it logistically convenient for the fans across the border to travel through Wagah Border. However, Mohali does not figure in the 12 venues finalised by the BCCI. In 1996, the high-profile quarterfinal was held at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. A lot has changed since then and in these sensitive times, it will be very difficult to host Pakistan in some of the specific venues, including Mumbai and Dharamsala. In fact Pakistan’s 2016 World Cup match was scheduled in Dharamsala but there were apprehensions that because of the Pathankot tragedy (terrorists attacked the air base), it wasn’t a wise idea to host the match at that venue. While security will be top notch for each team, the BCCI as well as the Indian government would like to ensure that there aren’t any untoward incidents.

They have a total of four points. Their next match is against Punjab Kings on Thursday at Mohali. On his participation in IPL next year, Smith said, “Did not put my name in the auction this year as it is a big year for Australian cricket. I will put my name in next year’s auction.

We did a little bit of that before we left for UAE against the Under-23 team and against Jaffna NSL side. We have arranged for us to play against higher ranked teams – clubs and NSL every month,” said Sri Lanka Under-19 head coach Jehan Mubarak who is of the view that schoolboys who Captain their teams and the national Under-19 teams should be able to make decisions on the field rather than get help from coaches. “When I was coaching at Royal College (Colombo) they liked to be given the solution,” said Mubarak who has been in the system with schoolboys to understand their way of thinking. “I had this problem where the solution became the coaches and not the players. We can guide them but at the end of the day they have to call their game, so that when they progress to the Under-19 program they are able to make decisions on their own.” Apart from coaching Royal College for about three years Mubarak also had a stint as coach of Bloomfield. “I’ve been on the Royal College advisory committee for about 10-15 years. I understand their mindset a little bit, how they think. Also the parents are important. We need to have a chat about the players’ lifestyle. How to tackle social media, how to spend the money they get into their hands wisely and things like that.\" In Mubarak’s book, fielding is top priority. “Cricket for me is being the best fielding side. Whatever your age Sri Lanka should always be the best fielding team whether it is U-19 or the senior national team. Fielding doesn’t need a lot of skills, it just needs hard work.” “Being a good fielding side helps to lift the standard of the team. It puts pressure on the batsmen because the fielders are always in the game. The facet of becoming a good fielding team means that you have to be mentally strong. You do a lot of hard work, so you have pushed a lot of mental barriers. Even in match situations when things are not going your way, because you’ve done the hard work you don’t want to give up so easily. Also you play for each other if you have a good fielding team. You play better as a team. I could see that on the tour of the UAE.”","pubDate":"2023-04-11 20:41:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Planters Association of Ceylon, United Planters of Southern India Sports Club conducts Biennial Sports Festival","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Planters-Association-of-Ceylon--United-Planters-of-Southern-India-Sports-Club-conducts-Biennial-Sports-Festival/23-747309","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Planters Association of Ceylon (PA) and United Planters of Southern India Sports Club (UPASI SC) successfully concluded their Biennial sports festival held from 23 to 28 March 2023.

RPCs showed their colours this year by winning the annual Golf Tournament after a lapse of 20 years, with Tharindu Wickramasinghe excelling and winning the overall team winner award and clinching the title of ‘Stable Ford’. In addition, the PA team also won the Cricket and Badminton tournaments at the annual event.

Sethi said that Pakistan was willing to bear this loss of revenue as it was “a matter of principle” as far as the hosting rights of the Asia Cup are concerned. “We have made it very clear that unless the Asia Cup is held on a hybrid model like we have proposed, that is India playing its matches at an offshore venue and Pakistan hosting the remaining games at home we will not accept any other schedule and neither play,” he said. Pakistan is due to host the Asia Cup in September but uncertainty surrounds the venue of the tournament as India has made it clear it can’t play in Pakistan. Sethi has proposed a “hybrid model” to host the Asia Cup where India will play its matches at an offshore venue. “We will not lose our hosting rights,” he added. “Security is no excuse for them now and we have told them if their government is not giving them clearance to play in Pakistan show us some written proof of this,” Sethi said. “When all other teams including Australia, England, New Zealand are playing in Pakistan without any issues there should be no security concerns for India to tour Pakistan.” The PCB chairman said 80 percent of the revenues earned by the Asian Cricket Council came from Pakistan and India matches. To a question he conceded that if the ACC accepts the hybrid model for the tournament it could have a bearing on the ICC World Cup as well. Asked about a possible refusal by Pakistan to play in the World Cup, Sethi said relations with ICC were different and in such a scenario the relations could be affected negatively.

The World Cup will start tentatively on October 5, with 46 matches, including the final set to be played across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati and Hyderabad, Dharamasala. It is understood that discussions are currently on at the ICC level as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) bigwigs are in talks with a top level ICC executive on the issue, which still remains a sensitive one. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” a source close to ICC Board, tracking developments, told PTI on conditions of anonymity. The bone of contention will be the India versus Pakistan game. While Ahmedabad with 1,32,000 capacity gives ICC, the best chance to earn optimum profits but the Narendra Modi Stadium is already hosting the final, so another venue might host the game. Each team will play nine games at the league stage which will be held in round-robin format. The ICC’s Events committee, in association with host cricket board BCCI, will chalk out the final itinerary in the next few months so that it allows fans across India and other parts to plan their travel itinerary. Recently, ICC General Manager Wasim Khan, in his own capacity had told Pakistani media that the team could play its matches in Bangladesh as a part of a ‘hybrid model’ that could be followed since the Indian team is not travelling to the country for the Asia Cup. But PCB chairman Najam Sethi, back then had rubbished the idea of playing World Cup games in Bangladesh. More so, ICC had made it clear that no such proposal had come from Pakistan about ‘hybrid model’ for global tournaments. During the 2011 World Cup, Pakistan’s semi-final against India was played at Mohali, which made it logistically convenient for the fans across the border to travel through Wagah Border. However, Mohali does not figure in the 12 venues finalised by the BCCI. In 1996, the high-profile quarterfinal was held at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. A lot has changed since then and in these sensitive times, it will be very difficult to host Pakistan in some of the specific venues, including Mumbai and Dharamsala. In fact Pakistan’s 2016 World Cup match was scheduled in Dharamsala but there were apprehensions that because of the Pathankot tragedy (terrorists attacked the air base), it wasn’t a wise idea to host the match at that venue. While security will be top notch for each team, the BCCI as well as the Indian government would like to ensure that there aren’t any untoward incidents.

They have a total of four points. Their next match is against Punjab Kings on Thursday at Mohali. On his participation in IPL next year, Smith said, “Did not put my name in the auction this year as it is a big year for Australian cricket. I will put my name in next year’s auction. If someone picks me up, it will be great.” In his IPL career so far, Smith has represented teams like Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant, both of which are now defunct and Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.
