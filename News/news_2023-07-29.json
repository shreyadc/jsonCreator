Memories of former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting having his stumps thrown down by Gary Pratt 18 years ago came flooding back, but Smith was spared that fate as replays cast doubt over the role of wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. He appeared to nudge a bail loose with his arm before gathering the ball and completing the run out, leading TV umpire Nitin Menon to spare Smith on 44. Australia added exactly 100 runs for three wickets after the incident, finishing 295 all out and 12 runs in front. The decision did not go down well with the majority of the sold-out Kia Oval crowd, but Broad admitted his own grasp of the technicalities was imperfect and accepted the verdict. тАЬI donтАЩt know the rules to be honest. I think there was enough grey area to give that not out,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhat are the rules? Was it the right decision? It looked like benefit of the doubt sort of stuff. The first angle I saw I thought тАШoutтАЩ and then with the side angle it looked like the bails probably dislodged.тАЭ BroadтАЩs bowling partner James Anderson also sought to take any heat out of the umpiresтАЩ call, telling BBC Sport: тАЬIt felt like one of those where Australia think itтАЩs not out and we thought it was out. тАЬIтАЩve not had a proper look on the TV, but it felt like a very close decision. We have to trust that the third umpire knows what heтАЩs doing and got the decision right.тАЭ Smith, who top-scored with 71, accepted his near miss but doffed his cap in EalhamтАЩs direction after admitting the Surrey second teamer had caught him unawares with his rapid response. тАЬIt was pretty tight, but when I looked the second time it looked like Jonny might have knocked the bail before the ball came in,тАЭ he said. Bowlers do the business ЁЯФ┤ Australia all out on Day Two тШЭ Another brilliantly poised Test match ЁЯПП ЁЯП┤єаБзєаБвєаБеєаБоєаБзєаБ┐ ЁЯЗжЁЯЗ║ тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) тАЬIt looked a close one but it got given not out, didnтАЩt it? He was quick! I know now heтАЩs very quick. тАЬThe next one we hit out there we kind of pushed and he was haring round the boundary, coming in at pace. Had I known that previously, I might have just stayed there for the single.тАЭ England will begin their second innings on Saturday morning, with barely anything to separate the sides as an enthralling series enters its final chapter. There have been two distinct styles on show, with England scoring at a rampant rate 5.17 across less than 55 overs and Australia taking almost twice as long to get their runs at 2.85. The tourists have already retained the urn with a 2-1 lead, but both teams have a viable route to victory as they look to finish the series on a high. тАЬItтАЩs going to be another cracker, I think. Both teams played pretty different on it but pretty successfully,тАЭ Broad said. тАЬAt one stage when Smith was nearly run out we thought we could get a pretty decent lead, but the Aussies battled pretty hard there and I think itтАЩs just set up to be a cracking game again. That is the way the Aussies play, they try to see off the new ball, grind you down, and see off a huge number of overs.тАЭ Smith added: тАЬItтАЩs ebbed and flowed the whole wayтАжa few of us got good starts but couldnтАЩt go and get a big score. тАЬWeтАЩre 12 runs in front so itтАЩs pretty much a one-innings game from here. One positive out of the game so far is we have put more overs into their bowlers than the 50-odd ours bowled.тАЭ","pubDate":"2023-07-28

increasingly likely to be included at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles Sources in the US are confident the sport will be added to the schedule A final decision on Los Angeles 2028 sports is due to be made in the autumn By David Coverdale For Mailonline Updated: 23:13 BST, 28 July 2023 e-mail View comments Cricket is increasingly likely to be included in the Olympics when the programme for Los Angeles 2028 is finalised in the autumn. The sport has been one of nine lobbying for a place in the Games, along with karate, baseball and softball, lacrosse, breaking, kickboxing, squash, e-karting and flag football. And sources in the US are now confident that cricket will be added to the schedule for the first time since a one-off match between Great Britain and France in 1900. The International Cricket CouncilтАЩs proposal is for five teams to take part in both menтАЩs and womenтАЩs Twenty20 competitions. WomenтАЩs T20 cricket was part of last summerтАЩs Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, with LA 2028 organisers attending matches at Edgbaston. Cricket is among the sports hoping to secure a place on the Los Angeles 2028 programme Women's T20 cricket was part of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham There are already 28 sports confirmed on LA 2028тАЩs schedule. But the host city can propose new ones to the International Olympic Committee, who would likely accept any suggestions. A decision is expected in September and, while the IOC are keen to keep the number of athletes down, one factor in cricketтАЩs favour is the boost it would give to the value of Olympic broadcast rights in Asia.

Steve Smith was given a narrow reprieve after it seemed he had been run out Sub George Ealham and Jonny Bairstow combined to stump the former captain But it was not given out, only for the England wicket keeper to dismiss him after By Ed Carruthers For Mailonline and Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 18:13 EDT, 28 July 2023 e-mail 3 View comments Steve Smith narrowly escaped a sensational run out from England's substitute fielder, George Ealham, during the second day of the fifth Ashes Test match at the Oval with home fans left howling over the decision. It was almost reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's dismissal at Trent Bridge in the 2005 Ashes series and ironically, the former Australian captain was on Sky Sports' commentary at the time the incident took place . The decision, which has sparked much discussion online, saw Smith knock a ball from Chris Woakes down to mid-wicket . On the television coverage, the ball seems to trickle away out wide, with the 34-year-old and his batting partner, Pat Cummins , attempting to make it back to the crease in time for two runs. But appearing from out of the picture of the television coverage came Ealham, who steamed in to throw a rocket of a ball into Jonny Bairstow. Steve Smith (pictured) narrowly survived a run out on the second day of the fifth Ashes Test Smith (left) was stumped by Jonny Bairstow (right) who took a sensational throw from England's substitute fielder George Ealham Ealham celebrated with his side after his sensational piece of fielding, but the TMO decided that Smith had not been run out The England keeper took the catch and swung his hands into the wicket as Smith dived for his crease with the bat. The decision went upstairs to the third umpire, Nitin Menon, with Ponting initially saying 'this could be out' before asking the question everyone in the stands was thinking 'had Smith made his ground?' It was a very hard decision for the TMO to call, with there being millimetres between Smith's bat and the crease. But it seemed that Bairstow had made contact with the stumps before he caught the ball. Under Law 29, the wicket was not removed fairly and subsequently decision was ruled as 'not out'. The third umpire's call was met with loud disapproval from the Trent Bridge crowd while man fans voiced their disapproval on a video shared by the Barmy Army on Twitter. 'Out!! poor decision, the bail was clearly not connected to the stump when Smith was still outside the crease.' one fan posted. 'Out. Bairstow's glove touches the stump, does not break the bails, ball gathered, Bails broke, Smith still short,' posted another. 'I think out, Johnny did disturb the stumps before but it was the off stump and with the ball in his gloves it was the middle stump that went back. It was tough but definitely out,' added another.

'Not out. The moment a bail gets dislodged before the ball, the stumps have to be pulled out. Sorry, that is the rule - poms can whine all day. The rules are rules,' one fan pointed out. 'The bails were the problem! Shoulda popped out but it didn't,' posted another. 'Not out. Bail is up before the ball is in his gloves. Bairstow butchering key wickets is becoming a bit of a theme isnтАЩt it? Not doubting his ability with the bat, but with the gloves heтАЩs poor at best,' another said. There were plenty of other fans that also pointed the finger at Bairstow for missing a golden opportunity through poor technique. 'Yet another howler from Bairstow. An ashes series is the last test series you play in to bed your way back in after a big injury. It absolutely should not have been allowed. HeтАЩs single handedly cost us the entire series,' one fan fumed. 'Why isn't Bairstow taking the ball in front of the stumps like all international keepers are trained to do, wouldn't have even been close if he had,' posted another. 'Bairstow hits the stumps without the ball, rules state he needs to pull a stump and touch it with the ball, clearly not out,' added another. Chris Woakes would return to bowl at Smith (middle) but the Australian batter caught a top-edge sending his shot high into the air Bairstow (pictured) was on hand again to take the catch with the wicketkeeper brilliantly tracking back to dismiss Smith It was reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's dismissal at Trent Bridge in 2005, where the former Australia captain was also dismissed by an England substitute Ponting, meanwhile, who had notably been dismissed by substitute fielder Gary Pratt in a similar incident was on hand to tell Smith that he should have learned from his mistakes. 'The lesson is, don't take on the sub fielder you know nothing about ... the bloke's covered 100 metres in 8.5 seconds,' Ponting said on Sky Sports. Woakes would be back to attack Bairstow again soon after, with the Australian swinging again with his bat towards mid-wicket. Lashing wildly at the ball he caught a top-edge and sent the ball up into the air behind his wicket. Bairstow was on hand once again and this time made no mistake, running backwards to take an impressive catch on the run to dismiss Smith for 71 off 123 balls. Woakes would come back to dismiss his replacement, Todd Murphy, with an LBW, before the Australian captain, Cummins, was caught by his counter part Ben Stokes on the boundary off Joe Root. It means that at the close of day two, Australia narrowly surpassed England by 12 runs, finishing their first innings at 295 all out.

New Zealand, ranked the world's number three side, head into the game in front of an expected 80 000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after impressive victories over world champions South Africa and Argentina. Two trophies are on the line, with a win ensuring Ian Foster's men retain the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship title and also the trans-Tasman Bledisloe Cup. READ | Argentina change 5 for Springbok clash as veteran winger Imhoff starts Australia haven't got their hands on the Bledisloe silverware since 2002 - when Jones was last in charge - and few expect that to change. The Wallabies would need not only victory in Melbourne but also at Dunedin next month to claim the spoils. And they would need a significant change in form. Australia are still chasing their first victory of the 2023 Rugby Championship, after defeats against the Springboks and Pumas. Jones has made seven changes after being embarrassed at home 34-31 by Argentina and is gambling on a young and relatively inexperienced starting side to handle the pressure at a stadium neither team has experienced before. Notably, rookie Carter Gordon has been thrown in at the deep end as playmaker alongside scrumhalf Tate McDermott with Quade Cooper and Nic White on the bench. With a few months to go before the September-October World Cup in France, Jones acknowledged his team had been widely written off, but insisted they were a work in progress. \"I'm still getting to know the players and the players are still getting to know me. We needed to find out where the best balance of the team is but just watching the team train I liked the look of it,\" he said. \"There's not too many people outside our group that thinks we can win the game but there's 85 000 people that might be in for a shock.\" Wallabies co-skipper Slipper sounded slightly less confident on an unusual Friday where neither team was able to get a feel for the cavernous MCG on the traditional captain's run. A blockbuster Australian Rules match at the venue between Collingwood and Carlton meant it was off-limits. Slipper admitted \"the odds don't really stack up when you've lost 20 (Bledisloe Cups) in a row\". He added: \"We know what's in front of us, we're going to have to put in one hell of a shift to get a result.\" 'Adapt fast' Ardie Savea, New Zealand's skipper in place of the injured Sam Cane, on Friday admitted they were wary of the new-look Wallabies. \"We have that in the back of our mind, we know they are going to come out firing and we know they can throw something at us that we haven't seen before,\" he said. \"The great challenge for us is having to adapt fast to the game and that's something that we've talked about.\" Savea said his team had room for improvement despite commanding performances in the first two rounds. \"We started well in both Tests (this season) and kind of let teams back in, so we really want to play the game right for the whole 80 minutes,\" he said. \"It's always crucial for any team to be consistent and for this All Blacks team that's what we want to do.\" Cane is the only change to the side that emphatically beat South Africa 35-20 two weeks ago, with Dalton Papalii coming into the starting XV. \"The Bledisloe means so much not only to the All Blacks, but the whole of New Zealand, so a lot is on the line,\" Savea said. \"We know that, we feel that, we harness that. We have used that as fuel and energy this week and hopefully on Saturday.\" Kick-off is at 11:45 (SA time) on Saturday.

Steve Smith is congratulated after reaching his half century during day two of the Oval Test. Credit: Getty Images Instead, they lead by just 12 runs on the first innings, thanks to some bowlers who were productive with the bat. тАЬI would have liked a few more partners maybe to stick around and able to sort of just play normally for a while I suppose. But yeah, I would have liked more runs of course,тАЭ said Smith, who was just 32 when Alex Carey went at 6/170. He scored most of his 71 with the tail and appeared to have another century for the taking when he skied a pull to leg. The collapse from 1/91 was particularly frustrating for Smith, who has an excellent record in London, particularly at the Oval, where had made three centuries and averaged 91 going into this Test. His most recent century at the ground was 121, which set up AustraliaтАЩs commanding World Test Championship final against India last month. Australia then jumped to a 2-0 Ashes series lead after close victories at Edgbaston and LordтАЩs, where Smith scored his second century at the self-proclaimed Home of Cricket. But since England recalled Mark Wood and Chris Woakes for the third Test, AustraliaтАЩs batsmen have often made starts but struggled to make match-defining scores. Bradman made 553 runs in four Tests at the Oval with a top score of 244 and an average of 138.25. Smith now has 617 runs at an average of 88 halfway through his fifth Test at the ground. Runs were a precious commodity during the first session on Friday as Khawaja and Labuschagne dropped anchor against some impressive English bowling in dark and difficult conditions.","pubDate":"2023-07-28 21:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: BCB Partners With OnTrack For BPL","link":"https://bernews.com/2023/07/cricket-bcb-partners-with-ontrack-for-bpl/","keywords":["All","Sports","#BermudaCricket"],"creator":["Bernews6"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Bermuda Cricket Board [BCB] announced an official partnership with local sports app, OnTrack as the official ticketing partner for the 2023 Bermuda Premier League [BPL] and the ICC Americas MenтАЩs T20 World Cup [2024] Regional Final.

SCORE: Australia (295) lead England (283) by 12 runs. SUMMARY: Australia employed a go-slow approach as they looked to grind England's attack into the ground at The Oval. The plan looked solid for the first hour as Australia scored at a snail's pace without risk, but once Marnus Labuschagne fell for nine the game changed. Australia lost 6-94 as the ball offered some movement to England's quicks and the tourists' shots grew looser destroying any hope of a big lead for England. Steve Smith stood firm with 71, before Pat Cummins (36) and Todd Murphy (34) put on 49 for the ninth wicket to give Australia a 12-run lead. PLAYER OF THE MOMENT: Steve Smith. For all the concerns over his form for the past few weeks, Smith stood up when Australia needed him with a crucial 71. The vice-captain held his team's innings together and fought as hard as he has in any knock since his century at Lord's in the second Test. KEY MOMENT: Joe Root's catch to remove Marnus Labuschagne. Jonny Bairstow should have claimed it to his right as wicketkeeper, but when he let it go Root flung himself to his left, threw a hand at it and the ball stuck. Before that it looked as if Australia could bat all day. Instead, the wicket prompted the big collapse and brought England back into the match. STAT OF THE DAY: Marnus Labuschagne's nine from 82 balls was the slowest innings by an Australian No.3 since Greg Ritchie's 17 from 157 against India in January 1986 (minimum 50 balls faced). QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"The lesson is, don't take on the sub fielder you know nothing about.\" - Ricky Ponting, after Steve Smith was very nearly run out by England substitute fielder George Ealham. Ponting was famously run out in similar fashion by Gary Pratt in 2005, prompting a blow up at English officials as the Australian captain left the field. Smith survived Ealham's strong arm this time after Jonny Bairstow broke the stumps too early and the bail took some time to dislodge from its groove.

Memories of former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting having his stumps thrown down by Gary Pratt 18 years ago came flooding back, but Smith was spared that fate as replays cast doubt over the role of wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. He appeared to nudge a bail loose with his arm before gathering the ball and completing the run out, leading TV umpire Nitin Menon to spare Smith on 44. Australia added exactly 100 runs for three wickets after the incident, finishing 295 all out and 12 runs in front. The decision did not go down well with the majority of the sold-out Kia Oval crowd, but Broad admitted his own grasp of the technicalities was imperfect and accepted the verdict. тАЬI donтАЩt know the rules to be honest. I think there was enough grey area to give that not out,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhat are the rules? Was it the right decision? It looked like benefit of the doubt sort of stuff. The first angle I saw I thought тАШoutтАЩ and then with the side angle it looked like the bails probably dislodged.тАЭ BroadтАЩs bowling partner James Anderson also sought to take any heat out of the umpiresтАЩ call, telling BBC Sport: тАЬIt felt like one of those where Australia think itтАЩs not out and we thought it was out. тАЬIтАЩve not had a proper look on the TV, but it felt like a very close decision. We have to trust that the third umpire knows what heтАЩs doing and got the decision right.тАЭ Smith, who top-scored with 71, accepted his near miss but doffed his cap in EalhamтАЩs direction after admitting the Surrey second teamer had caught him unawares with his rapid response. тАЬIt was pretty tight, but when I looked the second time it looked like Jonny might have knocked the bail before the ball came in,тАЭ he said.

He was quick! I know now heтАЩs very quick. тАЬThe next one we hit out there we kind of pushed and he was haring round the boundary, coming in at pace. Had I known that previously, I might have just stayed there for the single.тАЭ England will begin their second innings on Saturday morning, with barely anything to separate the sides as an enthralling series enters its final chapter. There have been two distinct styles on show, with England scoring at a rampant rate 5.17 across less than 55 overs and Australia taking almost twice as long to get their runs at 2.85. The tourists have already retained the urn with a 2-1 lead, but both teams have a viable route to victory as they look to finish the series on a high. тАЬItтАЩs going to be another cracker, I think. Both teams played pretty different on it but pretty successfully,тАЭ Broad said. тАЬAt one stage when Smith was nearly run out we thought we could get a pretty decent lead, but the Aussies battled pretty hard there and I think itтАЩs just set up to be a cracking game again. That is the way the Aussies play, they try to see off the new ball, grind you down, and see off a huge number of overs.тАЭ Smith added: тАЬItтАЩs ebbed and flowed the whole wayтАжa few of us got good starts but couldnтАЩt go and get a big score. тАЬWeтАЩre 12 runs in front so itтАЩs pretty much a one-innings game from here.

increasingly likely to be included at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles Sources in the US are confident the sport will be added to the schedule A final decision on Los Angeles 2028 sports is due to be made in the autumn By David Coverdale For Mailonline Updated: 23:13 BST, 28 July 2023 e-mail View comments Cricket is increasingly likely to be included in the Olympics when the programme for Los Angeles 2028 is finalised in the autumn. The sport has been one of nine lobbying for a place in the Games, along with karate, baseball and softball, lacrosse, breaking, kickboxing, squash, e-karting and flag football. And sources in the US are now confident that cricket will be added to the schedule for the first time since a one-off match between Great Britain and France in 1900. The International Cricket CouncilтАЩs proposal is for five teams to take part in both menтАЩs and womenтАЩs Twenty20 competitions. WomenтАЩs T20 cricket was part of last summerтАЩs Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, with LA 2028 organisers attending matches at Edgbaston. Cricket is among the sports hoping to secure a place on the Los Angeles 2028 programme Women's T20 cricket was part of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham There are already 28 sports confirmed on LA 2028тАЩs schedule. But the host city can propose new ones to the International Olympic Committee, who would likely accept any suggestions. A decision is expected in September and, while the IOC are keen to keep the number of athletes down, one factor in cricketтАЩs favour is the boost it would give to the value of Olympic broadcast rights in Asia.

Steve Smith was given a narrow reprieve after it seemed he had been run out Sub George Ealham and Jonny Bairstow combined to stump the former captain But it was not given out, only for the England wicket keeper to dismiss him after By Ed Carruthers For Mailonline and Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 18:13 EDT, 28 July 2023 e-mail 3 View comments Steve Smith narrowly escaped a sensational run out from England's substitute fielder, George Ealham, during the second day of the fifth Ashes Test match at the Oval with home fans left howling over the decision. It was almost reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's dismissal at Trent Bridge in the 2005 Ashes series and ironically, the former Australian captain was on Sky Sports' commentary at the time the incident took place . The decision, which has sparked much discussion online, saw Smith knock a ball from Chris Woakes down to mid-wicket . On the television coverage, the ball seems to trickle away out wide, with the 34-year-old and his batting partner, Pat Cummins , attempting to make it back to the crease in time for two runs. But appearing from out of the picture of the television coverage came Ealham, who steamed in to throw a rocket of a ball into Jonny Bairstow. Steve Smith (pictured) narrowly survived a run out on the second day of the fifth Ashes Test Smith (left) was stumped by Jonny Bairstow (right) who took a sensational throw from England's substitute fielder George Ealham Ealham celebrated with his side after his sensational piece of fielding, but the TMO decided that Smith had not been run out The England keeper took the catch and swung his hands into the wicket as Smith dived for his crease with the bat. The decision went upstairs to the third umpire, Nitin Menon, with Ponting initially saying 'this could be out' before asking the question everyone in the stands was thinking 'had Smith made his ground?' It was a very hard decision for the TMO to call, with there being millimetres between Smith's bat and the crease. But it seemed that Bairstow had made contact with the stumps before he caught the ball. Under Law 29, the wicket was not removed fairly and subsequently decision was ruled as 'not out'. The third umpire's call was met with loud disapproval from the Trent Bridge crowd while man fans voiced their disapproval on a video shared by the Barmy Army on Twitter. 'Out!! poor decision, the bail was clearly not connected to the stump when Smith was still outside the crease.' one fan posted. 'Out. Bairstow's glove touches the stump, does not break the bails, ball gathered, Bails broke, Smith still short,' posted another. 'I think out, Johnny did disturb the stumps before but it was the off stump and with the ball in his gloves it was the middle stump that went back. It was tough but definitely out,' added another.

'Not out. The moment a bail gets dislodged before the ball, the stumps have to be pulled out. Sorry, that is the rule - poms can whine all day. The rules are rules,' one fan pointed out. 'The bails were the problem! Shoulda popped out but it didn't,' posted another. 'Not out. Bail is up before the ball is in his gloves. Bairstow butchering key wickets is becoming a bit of a theme isnтАЩt it? Not doubting his ability with the bat, but with the gloves heтАЩs poor at best,' another said. There were plenty of other fans that also pointed the finger at Bairstow for missing a golden opportunity through poor technique. 'Yet another howler from Bairstow. An ashes series is the last test series you play in to bed your way back in after a big injury. It absolutely should not have been allowed. HeтАЩs single handedly cost us the entire series,' one fan fumed. 'Why isn't Bairstow taking the ball in front of the stumps like all international keepers are trained to do, wouldn't have even been close if he had,' posted another. 'Bairstow hits the stumps without the ball, rules state he needs to pull a stump and touch it with the ball, clearly not out,' added another. Chris Woakes would return to bowl at Smith (middle) but the Australian batter caught a top-edge sending his shot high into the air Bairstow (pictured) was on hand again to take the catch with the wicketkeeper brilliantly tracking back to dismiss Smith It was reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's dismissal at Trent Bridge in 2005, where the former Australia captain was also dismissed by an England substitute Ponting, meanwhile, who had notably been dismissed by substitute fielder Gary Pratt in a similar incident was on hand to tell Smith that he should have learned from his mistakes. 'The lesson is, don't take on the sub fielder you know nothing about ... the bloke's covered 100 metres in 8.5 seconds,' Ponting said on Sky Sports. Woakes would be back to attack Bairstow again soon after, with the Australian swinging again with his bat towards mid-wicket. Lashing wildly at the ball he caught a top-edge and sent the ball up into the air behind his wicket. Bairstow was on hand once again and this time made no mistake, running backwards to take an impressive catch on the run to dismiss Smith for 71 off 123 balls. Woakes would come back to dismiss his replacement, Todd Murphy, with an LBW, before the Australian captain, Cummins, was caught by his counter part Ben Stokes on the boundary off Joe Root. It means that at the close of day two, Australia narrowly surpassed England by 12 runs, finishing their first innings at 295 all out.

New Zealand, ranked the world's number three side, head into the game in front of an expected 80 000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after impressive victories over world champions South Africa and Argentina. Two trophies are on the line, with a win ensuring Ian Foster's men retain the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship title and also the trans-Tasman Bledisloe Cup. READ | Argentina change 5 for Springbok clash as veteran winger Imhoff starts Australia haven't got their hands on the Bledisloe silverware since 2002 - when Jones was last in charge - and few expect that to change. The Wallabies would need not only victory in Melbourne but also at Dunedin next month to claim the spoils. And they would need a significant change in form. Australia are still chasing their first victory of the 2023 Rugby Championship, after defeats against the Springboks and Pumas. Jones has made seven changes after being embarrassed at home 34-31 by Argentina and is gambling on a young and relatively inexperienced starting side to handle the pressure at a stadium neither team has experienced before. Notably, rookie Carter Gordon has been thrown in at the deep end as playmaker alongside scrumhalf Tate McDermott with Quade Cooper and Nic White on the bench. With a few months to go before the September-October World Cup in France, Jones acknowledged his team had been widely written off, but insisted they were a work in progress. \"I'm still getting to know the players and the players are still getting to know me. We needed to find out where the best balance of the team is but just watching the team train I liked the look of it,\" he said. \"There's not too many people outside our group that thinks we can win the game but there's 85 000 people that might be in for a shock.\" Wallabies co-skipper Slipper sounded slightly less confident on an unusual Friday where neither team was able to get a feel for the cavernous MCG on the traditional captain's run. A blockbuster Australian Rules match at the venue between Collingwood and Carlton meant it was off-limits. Slipper admitted \"the odds don't really stack up when you've lost 20 (Bledisloe Cups) in a row\". He added: \"We know what's in front of us, we're going to have to put in one hell of a shift to get a result.\" 'Adapt fast' Ardie Savea, New Zealand's skipper in place of the injured Sam Cane, on Friday admitted they were wary of the new-look Wallabies. \"We have that in the back of our mind, we know they are going to come out firing and we know they can throw something at us that we haven't seen before,\" he said. \"The great challenge for us is having to adapt fast to the game and that's something that we've talked about.\" Savea said his team had room for improvement despite commanding performances in the first two rounds. \"We started well in both Tests (this season) and kind of let teams back in, so we really want to play the game right for the whole 80 minutes,\" he said. \"It's always crucial for any team to be consistent and for this All Blacks team that's what we want to do.\" Cane is the only change to the side that emphatically beat South Africa 35-20 two weeks ago, with Dalton Papalii coming into the starting XV. \"The Bledisloe means so much not only to the All Blacks, but the whole of New Zealand, so a lot is on the line,\" Savea said. \"We know that, we feel that, we harness that. We have used that as fuel and energy this week and hopefully on Saturday.\" Kick-off is at 11:45 (SA time) on Saturday.

Steve Smith is congratulated after reaching his half century during day two of the Oval Test. Credit: Getty Images Instead, they lead by just 12 runs on the first innings, thanks to some bowlers who were productive with the bat. тАЬI would have liked a few more partners maybe to stick around and able to sort of just play normally for a while I suppose. But yeah, I would have liked more runs of course,тАЭ said Smith, who was just 32 when Alex Carey went at 6/170. He scored most of his 71 with the tail and appeared to have another century for the taking when he skied a pull to leg. The collapse from 1/91 was particularly frustrating for Smith, who has an excellent record in London, particularly at the Oval, where had made three centuries and averaged 91 going into this Test. His most recent century at the ground was 121, which set up AustraliaтАЩs commanding World Test Championship final against India last month. Australia then jumped to a 2-0 Ashes series lead after close victories at Edgbaston and LordтАЩs, where Smith scored his second century at the self-proclaimed Home of Cricket. But since England recalled Mark Wood and Chris Woakes for the third Test, AustraliaтАЩs batsmen have often made starts but struggled to make match-defining scores. Bradman made 553 runs in four Tests at the Oval with a top score of 244 and an average of 138.25. Smith now has 617 runs at an average of 88 halfway through his fifth Test at the ground. Runs were a precious commodity during the first session on Friday as Khawaja and Labuschagne dropped anchor against some impressive English bowling in dark and difficult conditions.","pubDate":"2023-07-28 21:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: BCB Partners With OnTrack For BPL","link":"https://bernews.com/2023/07/cricket-bcb-partners-with-ontrack-for-bpl/","keywords":["All","Sports","#BermudaCricket"],"creator":["Bernews6"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Bermuda Cricket Board [BCB] announced an official partnership with local sports app, OnTrack as the official ticketing partner for the 2023 Bermuda Premier League [BPL] and the ICC Americas MenтАЩs T20 World Cup [2024] Regional Final.

SCORE: Australia (295) lead England (283) by 12 runs. SUMMARY: Australia employed a go-slow approach as they looked to grind England's attack into the ground at The Oval. The plan looked solid for the first hour as Australia scored at a snail's pace without risk, but once Marnus Labuschagne fell for nine the game changed. Australia lost 6-94 as the ball offered some movement to England's quicks and the tourists' shots grew looser destroying any hope of a big lead for England. Steve Smith stood firm with 71, before Pat Cummins (36) and Todd Murphy (34) put on 49 for the ninth wicket to give Australia a 12-run lead. PLAYER OF THE MOMENT: Steve Smith. For all the concerns over his form for the past few weeks, Smith stood up when Australia needed him with a crucial 71. The vice-captain held his team's innings together and fought as hard as he has in any knock since his century at Lord's in the second Test. KEY MOMENT: Joe Root's catch to remove Marnus Labuschagne. Jonny Bairstow should have claimed it to his right as wicketkeeper, but when he let it go Root flung himself to his left, threw a hand at it and the ball stuck. Before that it looked as if Australia could bat all day. Instead, the wicket prompted the big collapse and brought England back into the match. STAT OF THE DAY: Marnus Labuschagne's nine from 82 balls was the slowest innings by an Australian No.3 since Greg Ritchie's 17 from 157 against India in January 1986 (minimum 50 balls faced). QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"The lesson is, don't take on the sub fielder you know nothing about.\" - Ricky Ponting, after Steve Smith was very nearly run out by England substitute fielder George Ealham. Ponting was famously run out in similar fashion by Gary Pratt in 2005, prompting a blow up at English officials as the Australian captain left the field. Smith survived Ealham's strong arm this time after Jonny Bairstow broke the stumps too early and the bail took some time to dislodge from its groove.

Memories of former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting having his stumps thrown down by Gary Pratt 18 years ago came flooding back, but Smith was spared that fate as replays cast doubt over the role of wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. He appeared to nudge a bail loose with his arm before gathering the ball and completing the run out, leading TV umpire Nitin Menon to spare Smith on 44. Australia added exactly 100 runs for three wickets after the incident, finishing 295 all out and 12 runs in front. The decision did not go down well with the majority of the sold-out Kia Oval crowd, but Broad admitted his own grasp of the technicalities was imperfect and accepted the verdict. тАЬI donтАЩt know the rules to be honest. I think there was enough grey area to give that not out,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhat are the rules? Was it the right decision? It looked like benefit of the doubt sort of stuff. The first angle I saw I thought тАШoutтАЩ and then with the side angle it looked like the bails probably dislodged.тАЭ BroadтАЩs bowling partner James Anderson also sought to take any heat out of the umpiresтАЩ call, telling BBC Sport: тАЬIt felt like one of those where Australia think itтАЩs not out and we thought it was out. тАЬIтАЩve not had a proper look on the TV, but it felt like a very close decision. We have to trust that the third umpire knows what heтАЩs doing and got the decision right.тАЭ Smith, who top-scored with 71, accepted his near miss but doffed his cap in EalhamтАЩs direction after admitting the Surrey second teamer had caught him unawares with his rapid response. тАЬIt was pretty tight, but when I looked the second time it looked like Jonny might have knocked the bail before the ball came in,тАЭ he said. Bowlers do the business ЁЯФ┤ Australia all out on Day Two тШЭ Another brilliantly poised Test match ЁЯПП ЁЯП┤єаБзєаБвєаБеєаБоєаБзєаБ┐ ЁЯЗжЁЯЗ║ тАФ England Cricket (@englandcricket) тАЬIt looked a close one but it got given not out, didnтАЩt it? He was quick! I know now heтАЩs very quick. тАЬThe next one we hit out there we kind of pushed and he was haring round the boundary, coming in at pace. Had I known that previously, I might have just stayed there for the single.тАЭ England will begin their second innings on Saturday morning, with barely anything to separate the sides as an enthralling series enters its final chapter. There have been two distinct styles on show, with England scoring at a rampant rate 5.17 across less than 55 overs and Australia taking almost twice as long to get their runs at 2.85. The tourists have already retained the urn with a 2-1 lead, but both teams have a viable route to victory as they look to finish the series on a high. тАЬItтАЩs going to be another cracker, I think. Both teams played pretty different on it but pretty successfully,тАЭ Broad said. тАЬAt one stage when Smith was nearly run out we thought we could get a pretty decent lead, but the Aussies battled pretty hard there and I think itтАЩs just set up to be a cracking game again. That is the way the Aussies play, they try to see off the new ball, grind you down, and see off a huge number of overs.тАЭ Smith added: тАЬItтАЩs ebbed and flowed the whole wayтАжa few of us got good starts but couldnтАЩt go and get a big score. тАЬWeтАЩre 12 runs in front so itтАЩs pretty much a one-innings game from here. One positive out of the game so far is we have put more overs into their bowlers than the 50-odd ours bowled.тАЭ","pubDate":"2023-07-28

made in the autumn By David Coverdale For Mailonline Updated: 23:13 BST, 28 July 2023 e-mail View comments Cricket is increasingly likely to be included in the Olympics when the programme for Los Angeles 2028 is finalised in the autumn. The sport has been one of nine lobbying for a place in the Games, along with karate, baseball and softball, lacrosse, breaking, kickboxing, squash, e-karting and flag football. And sources in the US are now confident that cricket will be added to the schedule for the first time since a one-off match between Great Britain and France in 1900. The International Cricket CouncilтАЩs proposal is for five teams to take part in both menтАЩs and womenтАЩs Twenty20 competitions. WomenтАЩs T20 cricket was part of last summerтАЩs Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, with LA 2028 organisers attending matches at Edgbaston. Cricket is among the sports hoping to secure a place on the Los Angeles 2028 programme Women's T20 cricket was part of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham There are already 28 sports confirmed on LA 2028тАЩs schedule. But the host city can propose new ones to the International Olympic Committee, who would likely accept any suggestions. A decision is expected in September and, while the IOC are keen to keep the number of athletes down, one factor in cricketтАЩs favour is the boost it would give to the value of Olympic broadcast rights in Asia.

Steve Smith was given a narrow reprieve after it seemed he had been run out Sub George Ealham and Jonny Bairstow combined to stump the former captain But it was not given out, only for the England wicket keeper to dismiss him after By Ed Carruthers For Mailonline and Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 18:13 EDT, 28 July 2023 e-mail 3 View comments Steve Smith narrowly escaped a sensational run out from England's substitute fielder, George Ealham, during the second day of the fifth Ashes Test match at the Oval with home fans left howling over the decision. It was almost reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's dismissal at Trent Bridge in the 2005 Ashes series and ironically, the former Australian captain was on Sky Sports' commentary at the time the incident took place . The decision, which has sparked much discussion online, saw Smith knock a ball from Chris Woakes down to mid-wicket . On the television coverage, the ball seems to trickle away out wide, with the 34-year-old and his batting partner, Pat Cummins , attempting to make it back to the crease in time for two runs. But appearing from out of the picture of the television coverage came Ealham, who steamed in to throw a rocket of a ball into Jonny Bairstow. Steve Smith (pictured) narrowly survived a run out on the second day of the fifth Ashes Test Smith (left) was stumped by Jonny Bairstow (right) who took a sensational throw from England's substitute fielder George Ealham Ealham celebrated with his side after his sensational piece of fielding, but the TMO decided that Smith had not been run out The England keeper took the catch and swung his hands into the wicket as Smith dived for his crease with the bat. The decision went upstairs to the third umpire, Nitin Menon, with Ponting initially saying 'this could be out' before asking the question everyone in the stands was thinking 'had Smith made his ground?' It was a very hard decision for the TMO to call, with there being millimetres between Smith's bat and the crease. But it seemed that Bairstow had made contact with the stumps before he caught the ball. Under Law 29, the wicket was not removed fairly and subsequently decision was ruled as 'not out'. The third umpire's call was met with loud disapproval from the Trent Bridge crowd while man fans voiced their disapproval on a video shared by the Barmy Army on Twitter. 'Out!! poor decision, the bail was clearly not connected to the stump when Smith was still outside the crease.' one fan posted. 'Out. Bairstow's glove touches the stump, does not break the bails, ball gathered, Bails broke, Smith still short,' posted another. 'I think out, Johnny did disturb the stumps before but it was the off stump and with the ball in his gloves it was the middle stump that went back. It was tough but definitely out,' added another.

'Not out. The moment a bail gets dislodged before the ball, the stumps have to be pulled out. Sorry, that is the rule - poms can whine all day. The rules are rules,' one fan pointed out. 'The bails were the problem! Shoulda popped out but it didn't,' posted another. 'Not out. Bail is up before the ball is in his gloves. Bairstow butchering key wickets is becoming a bit of a theme isnтАЩt it? Not doubting his ability with the bat, but with the gloves heтАЩs poor at best,' another said. There were plenty of other fans that also pointed the finger at Bairstow for missing a golden opportunity through poor technique. 'Yet another howler from Bairstow. An ashes series is the last test series you play in to bed your way back in after a big injury. It absolutely should not have been allowed. HeтАЩs single handedly cost us the entire series,' one fan fumed. 'Why isn't Bairstow taking the ball in front of the stumps like all international keepers are trained to do, wouldn't have even been close if he had,' posted another. 'Bairstow hits the stumps without the ball, rules state he needs to pull a stump and touch it with the ball, clearly not out,' added another. Chris Woakes would return to bowl at Smith (middle) but the Australian batter caught a top-edge sending his shot high into the air Bairstow (pictured) was on hand again to take the catch with the wicketkeeper brilliantly tracking back to dismiss Smith It was reminiscent of Ricky Ponting's dismissal at Trent Bridge in 2005, where the former Australia captain was also dismissed by an England substitute Ponting, meanwhile, who had notably been dismissed by substitute fielder Gary Pratt in a similar incident was on hand to tell Smith that he should have learned from his mistakes. 'The lesson is, don't take on the sub fielder you know nothing about ... the bloke's covered 100 metres in 8.5 seconds,' Ponting said on Sky Sports. Woakes would be back to attack Bairstow again soon after, with the Australian swinging again with his bat towards mid-wicket. Lashing wildly at the ball he caught a top-edge and sent the ball up into the air behind his wicket. Bairstow was on hand once again and this time made no mistake, running backwards to take an impressive catch on the run to dismiss Smith for 71 off 123 balls. Woakes would come back to dismiss his replacement, Todd Murphy, with an LBW, before the Australian captain, Cummins, was caught by his counter part Ben Stokes on the boundary off Joe Root. It means that at the close of day two, Australia narrowly surpassed England by 12 runs, finishing their first innings at 295 all out.

New Zealand, ranked the world's number three side, head into the game in front of an expected 80 000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after impressive victories over world champions South Africa and Argentina. Two trophies are on the line, with a win ensuring Ian Foster's men retain the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship title and also the trans-Tasman Bledisloe Cup. READ | Argentina change 5 for Springbok clash as veteran winger Imhoff starts Australia haven't got their hands on the Bledisloe silverware since 2002 - when Jones was last in charge - and few expect that to change. The Wallabies would need not only victory in Melbourne but also at Dunedin next month to claim the spoils. And they would need a significant change in form. Australia are still chasing their first victory of the 2023 Rugby Championship, after defeats against the Springboks and Pumas. Jones has made seven changes after being embarrassed at home 34-31 by Argentina and is gambling on a young and relatively inexperienced starting side to handle the pressure at a stadium neither team has experienced before. Notably, rookie Carter Gordon has been thrown in at the deep end as playmaker alongside scrumhalf Tate McDermott with Quade Cooper and Nic White on the bench. With a few months to go before the September-October World Cup in France, Jones acknowledged his team had been widely written off, but insisted they were a work in progress. \"I'm still getting to know the players and the players are still getting to know me. We needed to find out where the best balance of the team is but just watching the team train I liked the look of it,\" he said. \"There's not too many people outside our group that thinks we can win the game but there's 85 000 people that might be in for a shock.\" Wallabies co-skipper Slipper sounded slightly less confident on an unusual Friday where neither team was able to get a feel for the cavernous MCG on the traditional captain's run. A blockbuster Australian Rules match at the venue between Collingwood and Carlton meant it was off-limits. Slipper admitted \"the odds don't really stack up when you've lost 20 (Bledisloe Cups) in a row\". He added: \"We know what's in front of us, we're going to have to put in one hell of a shift to get a result.\" 'Adapt fast' Ardie Savea, New Zealand's skipper in place of the injured Sam Cane, on Friday admitted they were wary of the new-look Wallabies. \"We have that in the back of our mind, we know they are going to come out firing and we know they can throw something at us that we haven't seen before,\" he said. \"The great challenge for us is having to adapt fast to the game and that's something that we've talked about.\" Savea said his team had room for improvement despite commanding performances in the first two rounds. \"We started well in both Tests (this season) and kind of let teams back in, so we really want to play the game right for the whole 80 minutes,\" he said. \"It's always crucial for any team to be consistent and for this All Blacks team that's what we want to do.\" Cane is the only change to the side that emphatically beat South Africa 35-20 two weeks ago, with Dalton Papalii coming into the starting XV. \"The Bledisloe means so much not only to the All Blacks, but the whole of New Zealand, so a lot is on the line,\" Savea said. \"We know that, we feel that, we harness that. We have used that as fuel and energy this week and hopefully on Saturday.\" Kick-off is at 11:45 (SA time) on Saturday.

Steve Smith is congratulated after reaching his half century during day two of the Oval Test. Credit: Getty Images Instead, they lead by just 12 runs on the first innings, thanks to some bowlers who were productive with the bat. тАЬI would have liked a few more partners maybe to stick around and able to sort of just play normally for a while I suppose. But yeah, I would have liked more runs of course,тАЭ said Smith, who was just 32 when Alex Carey went at 6/170. He scored most of his 71 with the tail and appeared to have another century for the taking when he skied a pull to leg. The collapse from 1/91 was particularly frustrating for Smith, who has an excellent record in London, particularly at the Oval, where had made three centuries and averaged 91 going into this Test. His most recent century at the ground was 121, which set up AustraliaтАЩs commanding World Test Championship final against India last month. Australia then jumped to a 2-0 Ashes series lead after close victories at Edgbaston and LordтАЩs, where Smith scored his second century at the self-proclaimed Home of Cricket. But since England recalled Mark Wood and Chris Woakes for the third Test, AustraliaтАЩs batsmen have often made starts but struggled to make match-defining scores. Bradman made 553 runs in four Tests at the Oval with a top score of 244 and an average of 138.25. Smith now has 617 runs at an average of 88 halfway through his fifth Test at the ground. Runs were a precious commodity during the first session on Friday as Khawaja and Labuschagne dropped anchor against some impressive English bowling in dark and difficult conditions.","pubDate":"2023-07-28 21:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: BCB Partners With OnTrack For BPL","link":"https://bernews.com/2023/07/cricket-bcb-partners-with-ontrack-for-bpl/","keywords":["All","Sports","#BermudaCricket"],"creator":["Bernews6"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Bermuda Cricket Board [BCB] announced an official partnership with local sports app, OnTrack as the official ticketing partner for the 2023 Bermuda Premier League [BPL] and the ICC Americas MenтАЩs T20 World Cup [2024] Regional Final.

SCORE: Australia (295) lead England (283) by 12 runs. SUMMARY: Australia employed a go-slow approach as they looked to grind England's attack into the ground at The Oval. The plan looked solid for the first hour as Australia scored at a snail's pace without risk, but once Marnus Labuschagne fell for nine the game changed. Australia lost 6-94 as the ball offered some movement to England's quicks and the tourists' shots grew looser destroying any hope of a big lead for England. Steve Smith stood firm with 71, before Pat Cummins (36) and Todd Murphy (34) put on 49 for the ninth wicket to give Australia a 12-run lead. PLAYER OF THE MOMENT: Steve Smith. For all the concerns over his form for the past few weeks, Smith stood up when Australia needed him with a crucial 71. The vice-captain held his team's innings together and fought as hard as he has in any knock since his century at Lord's in the second Test. KEY MOMENT: Joe Root's catch to remove Marnus Labuschagne. Jonny Bairstow should have claimed it to his right as wicketkeeper, but when he let it go Root flung himself to his left, threw a hand at it and the ball stuck. Before that it looked as if Australia could bat all day. Instead, the wicket prompted the big collapse and brought England back into the match. STAT OF THE DAY: Marnus Labuschagne's nine from 82 balls was the slowest innings by an Australian No.3 since Greg Ritchie's 17 from 157 against India in January 1986 (minimum 50 balls faced). QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"The lesson is, don't take on the sub fielder you know nothing about.\" - Ricky Ponting, after Steve Smith was very nearly run out by England substitute fielder George Ealham. Ponting was famously run out in similar fashion by Gary Pratt in 2005, prompting a blow up at English officials as the Australian captain left the field. Smith survived Ealham's strong arm this time after Jonny Bairstow broke the stumps too early and the bail took some time to dislodge from its groove.
