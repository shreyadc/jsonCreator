Labuschagne started Thursday's clash (Friday morning AEST) out of Australia's starting XI and finished it collecting the player-of-the-match award after being activated as Cameron Green's concussion substitute part-way through the run chase. Green was struck on the left side of his head while facing South African seam bowler Kagiso Rabada. The match was paused as Green was checked by medical staff with cameras showing swelling and blood where the ball had struck. 'That stung Green,' the commentator said. ' You can see the skin broke just behind the left ear, and the swelling. 'This (concussion check) is all necessary given the sickening blow to the head of Cameron Green. 'He hasn't got much time, he's got fractions of a second to react to a steep bouncer.'

'When I came back from the Ashes, I had three to four weeks off, then went back to the drawing board and really thought about what I wanted to improve in my one-day game,' said Labuschagne, whose 53.36 Test average dwarfs the 31.37 he had averaged in ODIs before his Bloemfontein knock. 'That's gone really downhill and I really didn't like that,' he said. 'I've been really disappointed with the way I've played my one-day cricket the last 10 to 12 games. 'I haven't shown the intensity and courage that I would have liked. 'I wasn't too shocked when I was dropped, I said that to the selectors, 'I understand, I haven't made runs'. 'I did say I still want to be that person for you batting in the middle order. 'I addressed a few things that I wanted to improve on.' Labuschagne clubbed 80 runs in his knock to help set up the Australian victory in South Africa It was a measured innings for Labuschagne, who came in with Australia in trouble and batted through to the end with tail-enders including Ashton Agar (pictured) Australia had bowled out South Africa for 222 - an innings held together brilliantly by captain Temba Bavuma, who became just the 13th opener and second South African - after Herschelle Gibbs in 2000 - to carry his bat in an ODI innings with his unbeaten 114. But in their reply, Australia lost a soldier in the sixth over when Green was thumped in the helmet by a vicious Kagiso Rabada bumper. It was the cue for Labuschagne to rise from the bench and bat with both purpose and calmness. 'The opportunity that comes when you're concussion sub is sometimes a bit of a free hit,' he said. 'The pressure of the game is still there but the expectation is probably not as much on you. 'It was nice to contribute today even though at the start of the day I wasn't even in the side.' Still, wickets tumbled around him as Australia stumbled to 7-113 in the 17th over. Labuschagne was joined by Ashton Agar and the duo batted sensibly, appearing largely untroubled as they added 112 in a magnificent, unbroken eighth-wicket stand. 'We haven't batted much together, or at all,' Labuschagne said. 'It was a lot of fun. 'He's a very relaxed character and he showed great patience, great concentration and just stuck to that plan. 'We kept each other going to not get out of our bubble and not force it too much.' Marnus has made a huge impact in the Test arena but was left out of the ODI World Cup squad Australia can modify its squad before the World Cup, which could pave the way for Labuschagne to force his way in Labuschagne, famously, became the first concussion sub in Test history when he replaced Steve Smith during the Lord's Test of the 2019 Ashes series, which proved a defining moment of his career. He also was originally left out of this ODI series and was only recalled because of Smith's wrist injury. Timing is everything. Labuschagne missed selection in Australia's 15-man squad for the upcoming World Cup but he will be willing and ready to jump in should a vacancy arise. 'You've just got to sit tight and wait for your opportunities,' he said. 'When the opportunity comes you've got to be ready.' Earlier, Bavuma had defied leg cramps and a difficult pitch to post his fifth ODI century and single-handedly give his team hope, with Josh Hazlewood (3-41) and Stoinis (2-20) proving Australia's best with the ball.

The club needs someone to help them and Yorkshire would be in the right hands . I don't think they would let the members or the Yorkshire public down. They could make Yorkshire strong again. Foreign ownership happens in football. Manchester City , all the big clubs. It is happening more and more in sport. I don't know if the members would allow it or not , but I wouldn't have a problem with it. I watch the IPL and I am sure they would be able to boost the game here. Ex-Yorkshire County Cricket Club president Dickie Bird backed a Rajasthan Royals takeover The Indian Premier League side have offered around £25million to take full control at Yorkshire Yorkshire CCC are considering selling Headingley to the former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley I'd prefer it go to the Indians than (former Newcastle owner) Mike Ashley. India is a wonderful nation. I remember when we signed Sachin Tendulkar in 1992. You couldn't wish to meet a nicer lad. He was only 19 but he played well and developed into one of the greatest of all time. I umpired my last Test match against India at Lord's and I wanted it to be against India because they played the game in the right spirit. Whenever I umpired Tests and World Cups in India, they looked after me. I even once filmed a Pepsi advert in Mumbai where I was dressed as a judge! I have just been watching Yorkshire at Scarborough and everyone I spoke to didn't know which way it was going to go. Whatever happens, I'd like to see Yorkshire rise again to the power it used to be. Sir Donald Bradman told me when I had lunch with him in Adelaide that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is the greatest club in the world. All I want is to see Yorkshire fighting for the County Championship, back to being the best club in the world.

Mail Sport has been told that the ECB would have no objection to the Royals taking control at Yorkshire following our revelation of their £25million offer to buy the club, while the governing body are also considering changes to the structure of the Hundred to facilitate foreign investment. The eight city-based Hundred teams are currently fully owned by the ECB, but plans are in place to hand over 33 per cent of each franchise to its constituent counties and permit private investors to buy 33 per cent. The ECB would retain their one-third ownership of each team as well as owning the overall competition, with more detailed talks with the counties planned later this month. The ECB’s proposal would enable them to cut their spending on the Hundred significantly at a time when they under financial pressure, as well as increasing the chances of attracting foreign investors. Rajasthan Royals have launched a takeover bid for Yorkshire County Cricket Club (above) Sources told Mail Sport Rajasthan have plans to bring in their own executives to run the club Yorkshire need to raise funds to pay £15m owed to the family trust of ex-chairman Colin Graves Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that the ECB have shelved plans to increase the match fees paid to England’s male players after committing to parity for the women’s players, a key demand of the damning Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket report published earlier this summer. IPL sources have told Mail Sport that most of the 10 Indian franchises would want to buy into the Hundred teams if they became available, with interest from Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians understood to be particularly advanced. Many of the IPL owners spend much of the summer in England and have been regularly seen at Hundred games over the last two years. Any investment in the Hundred would have to be signed off by the all-powerful Board of Cricket for Control in India. A clause in the IPL staging agreement states that teams cannot invest in areas that are seen as competitors to the IPL or BCCI, although they have already permitted their franchises to buy teams in the Caribbean, South Africa, United States and UAE so are unlikely to object to investment in England. Rajasthan’s offer to Yorkshire appears to have divided opinion in the county ahead of a potential vote of the membership, which would follow any acceptance by the Board. Legendary former Yorkshire player, umpire and club president Dickie Bird writes in Mail Sport today that a Rajasthan takeover would be a “very big success,” but ex-chairman Robin Smith takes the opposite view, telling Mail Sport that “a sale of one of the English game’s foremost clubs to outside interests should be unthinkable.” As Mail Sport reported Rajasthan have offered a convertible loan to Yorkshire which would ultimately see them take full control at Headingley. The other main offer on the table is a proposal from Mike Ashley to buy the stadium and lease it back to the club, which is an avenue Rajasthan could also explore if Yorkshire are insistent on remaining a members’ club.

An exciting victory over Forres last time out gave Counties a spotless league record of 12 wins out of 12, backing up the Senior League title with an invincible season. The always-dangerous Pal Dhami led the way for Forres, who batted first on home turf, scoring 61. Sajid Muhammad (49), Fraser Merricks (34) and Gus Farr (32) also contributed valuable runs, as Forres set their opponents a target of 232 for victory from their 40 overs. Of Counties' bowlers, meanwhile, Lewis Pacey, Nuwan Eshwara and Shaun Thomas took two wickets apiece. It was a very competitive total, but Counties did not back down from the challenge and set about proactively trying to put pressure on the Forres bowlers. Shaun Thomas carried his bat, scoring 64 not out, with his best partnership coming with Richard Smith (41). Captain Will Ford (27 not out) strode to the crease determined to get his side over the line, and would eventually hit the winning runs himself with an over to spare to cap off the league season. \"Losing to Forres in the League Cup final earlier this season was a bit of a kick in the stones, because we felt that we should have done better for ourselves there,\" Ford said. \"It's easy to look at the negatives, but we went the whole league season without losing and that last game against Forres, everyone was saying it's one of the best games of cricket they have been involved in. \"Chasing 231 batting second, we went and got the runs quite easily with five wickets in hand. It wasn't boring, there was a bit of grit and determination, a bit of angst, a bit of everything really. It was everything you'd want from sport. \"We showed that we're not just a team that bats first and then controls people with our bowling and fielding, so it was enjoyable, very much so. \"Me and Shaun don't often get to bat together, but we've known each other since we were knee-high to a grasshopper. \"It was nice to go out and hit the winning runs with him there in the middle and enjoy that with him. \"It was the perfect ending to a perfect season.\" There is still one more match for Northern Counties to play this season, though, and they could make it a trophy double. The T20 Cup final was originally supposed to be played earlier in the summer, but weather conditions meant it was postponed until this Saturday. Again, Forres will be their opponents, and while Ford would rather not have the winner-take-all element in the final game of the year he is confident that Counties are capable of coming out on top once again. \"I'm glad they haven't left it another couple of weeks, because by that time everyone would have disappeared and started to hibernate,\" he reasoned. \"We could finish the season with two trophies in two weeks, which would be nice, but at the same time it would have been nice to finish on the high of last Saturday. \"Now we might finish the season with a loss in a cup final, which isn't the best, but we'll just have to do what we can to make sure that doesn't happen. \"Cricket is always a bit of fun, but especially in T20. We've got a strong team, so we just have to go and do what we do best. \"If we bat and bowl well, and be the team we have been all season, I'd hope we can come out on top.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-07 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"inverness_courier","source_priority":881874,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"546e6d4980abfe4a3935c462379dcd0d","title":"Pressure on ‘unsettled’ India to win World Cup at home: Shoaib Akhtar","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/09/08/pressure-on-unsettled-india-to-win-world-cup-at-home-shoaib-akhtar/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: Playing at home, and with intense media scrutiny, will put the Indian cricket team under a lot of pressure in the upcoming World Cup, feels former Pakistan pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar.

Akhtar added the stage is set perfectly for Pakistan, the No. 1 ODI side, to lift the trophy and give the country something to cheer about amid the serious economic situation. India’s performance in ICC events has left much to be desired as they have yet to win a world title since the 2013 Champions Trophy triumph under Mahendra Singh Dhoni. “Pakistan’s going to be all lonely there (in India). Having said that, they will be under no pressure. Playing at home, in front of own crowd, all the pressure will be on India; we will do better,” Akhtar said during a virtual press conference organised by Star Sports. “All the stadiums will be packed, and more than two billion people will be following the live action on TV or social media and what not. The Indian media will put an incredible amount of pressure on Pakistan, they will build it up like Mahabharata. They will already declare India as the winners… that’s an uncalled amount of pressure to have ahead of the game. “(But) Rohit Sharma and India are going to face a lot of pressure because of that.” India will take on Pakistan in the most-anticipated World Cup clash in Ahmedabad on October 14. But before that, they will clash in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup on Sunday, and may also head for a possible title showdown on September 17. Akhtar said the Indian team is still “unsettled” with less than a month left for the World Cup, beginning on October 5. “Why do I have this feeling… why India could not pick their XI in last two years. It’s a very strange thing to me that your squad is not settled. Who is your No. 4, where will Virat (Kohli) play 3, 4 or 5? Ishan Kishan looks amazing, can bat anywhere. “Hardik Pandya is an asset. Look what he has done with Gujarat Titans (in IPL). “But India is not being a settled squad for (the) last two years, this is a very strange thing for me. Who will occupy which slot?” he asked. “I’m all for Rohit, Virat, but everyday you got to perform because you got a name. You have to be out there, and lead by example. But the bowling and batting both look unsettled to me.”. “Why did Indian selectors ignore Chahal?” Akhtar also questioned the Indian selectors for ignoring Yuzvendra Chahal for the World Cup. “Not picking Chahal is beyond me. The problem with India is that when they get out for 150-200, they will increase the batters but never the bowlers. “What do you expect if you want to take batting till No. 8. If the top-five can’t contribute, what will (No.) 7-8 do? You are banking on (Ravindra) Jadeja? I believe that you (India) are playing with one bowler less.” He also took a dig at Rohit and said Shaheen Afridi was playing on the Indian skipper’s mind after the Pakistani quick cleaned him up in the Asia Cup. “Yeh Rohit Sharma woh Rohit Sharma hai hi nahi. Yeh uska stunt double hai (This is not the same Rohit Sharma. This is his stunt double),” said Akhtar. “Shaheen has made his way into his mind. I have never seen Rohit change his stance, but what was happening there (in Sri Lanka)? He (Rohit) changed it (stance), was beaten and bowled. Shaheen is subconsciously in his mind. This is what the pressure of an India versus Pakistan match does to players,” he added. “Stage set for Pakistan to lift the Cup, revive economy” Akhtar said Pakistan will have the advantage as all the attention will be on the home team. “Pakistan, on the other hand, will be all lonely with only 15 members there, sticking together. (I) will tell them to play ‘without fear’.” Akhtar added he had an intuition that this World Cup will go to Pakistan. “Why this World Cup is so important for us, because it will be special playing in India and winning in India. I don’t know, I may be wrong… but this stage is being set for an India-Pakistan final and particularly for Pakistan. “I will be praying that the Pakistan team wins because we are struggling with economic reforms, and our critical financial situation. This is the only thing that can lift the nation… if we lift the World Cup in India and before that the Asia Cup,” he said. “Pace trio reminds me of old days” Hailing Pakistan’s three-pronged pace attack of Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf, Akhtar said it reminded him of the Wasim Akram-Waqar Younis generation. “This pace battery reminds me of the old days, the era of two Ws. They are confident and have a similar mindset of taking wickets,” he said. The Pakistani trio has taken 23 wickets in the first three matches of the Asia Cup. Afridi had ripped the Indian top order in their rain-interrupted clash in Pallekele on September 2. “I would say Shaheen is on top of his career right now, while Haris Rauf has a wicket-taking mindset. I would advise Naseem to bowl more wicket-taking deliveries. He’s not the stock bowler, I’ve told the team management.” PTI Pressure on ‘unsettled’ India to win World Cup at home: Shoaib Akhtar added by Press Trust of India on 12:40 am September 8, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-09-07 19:10:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","source_priority":1088812,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7690fdd27f68b5dd1c1dbf28b4dd52ba","title":"'Concussion Substitute Legend' Fans React After Marnus Labuschagne Plays Match-Winning Knock Replacing Injured Cameron Green During SA vs AUS 1st ODI 2023","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/concussion-substitute-legend-fans-react-after-marnus-labuschagnes-match-winning-knock-replacing-injured-cameron-green-during-sa-vs-aus-1st-odi-2023-5396298.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Marnus Labuschagne becomes the first ever player to be come in the xi as concussion substitute twice and hit half centuries both times.","content":"What is your reaction to Karenjit Kaur: The Untold Story of Sunny Leone?

He had gone down in India's pecking order and Kolkata Knight Riders benched him for the whole of that IPL season. But within the last year or so Kuldeep has managed to change his status to become one of the automatic picks in India's World Cup-bound 15 which was announced on Tuesday. Kuldeep has also nosed ahead of leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and off-spinners R Ashwin and Washington Sundar in the India scheme of things. His claim has the backing of numbers as well. So far this year, the left-arm wrist spinner has taken 23 wickets from 13 ODIs – the highest by an Indian bowler. So, how did he bring in that metamorphosis? \"Determination,\" said Kuldeep's childhood coach Kapil Pandey. \"He was heart-broken. Forget about playing for India, he was not even getting the game-time with KKR. It is important for a bowler to keep working on his skills to improve his craft. \"But he was not ready to give up and kept training with me for a long time at the nets. We worked on many things like delivery speed etc that could help his bowling,\" said Pandey. But then any cricketer needs the help of an expert hand, someone who has seen it and done it all kind, to expand his craft. For Kuldeep, that person was Sunil Joshi. The former India left-arm spinner took Kuldeep under his wings and imparted some valuable lessons at the NCA. Advertisement \"In fact, I was in the selection panel when Kuldeep went down the line. It was not a pleasant sight to see a talented bowler going down. So, we met at the NCA and prepared a path ahead,\" Joshi told PTI. Joshi said Kuldeep, at that time, was a bit low on confidence and needed to tweak his bowling as well. Days of hard work followed at the NCA nets. \"We were mainly focusing on technical aspects like reducing his strides, increasing his arm speed so that he can bowl a bit quicker through the air. His action and approach (to the bowling crease) needed to be rectified,\" said Joshi. During the time when he was in turmoil, Kuldeep had lost his accuracy and zip off the pitch that made him look pedestrian, and he leaked plenty of runs too. Joshi suggested a few changes, and Kuldeep diligently worked on it. \"He was not having focus then, you know, the all over everywhere kind of bowling. But now, if you observe, he has lined up the batsmen well – his bowling arm is right in front of the batter, and even his strides are directed at the batter,\" said Joshi. A change of IPL franchise too worked wonders well for Kuldeep in this period – from KKR to Delhi Capitals. \"Kuldeep was telling me that he received plenty of backing at DC from (head coach) Ricky Ponting and assured him of good enough game-time. “It is important for a bowler to have the support of captain and coach, and that's why I think he excelled under MS Dhoni,\" said Pandey. Joshi has little doubt that Kuldeep will be Rohit Sharma's go-to bowler in the ODI World Cup. \"He has this ability to take the ball away from the left-handers, and he needs to use his stock ball (one that comes in if a batter is right-handed) against them. \"It will be handy for India because many teams have 2 or 3 left-handers in their batting order. \"While bowling against the right-hander, Kuldeep will have to make use of that one that goes away from them (the wrong'un), as it will keep them in doubt,\" said Joshi. Joshi said Kuldeep is a natural predator, and the team should make use of that quality to the hilt. \"He is a wicket-taking bowler, who will come in very handy in the middle-overs. Bowlers like (Ravindra) Jadeja or Axar (Patel) purchase wickets by limiting the run flow, thereby building pressure. \"But Kuldeep can pick up wickets under any conditions just by his variations.

Labuschagne started Thursday's clash (Friday morning AEST) out of Australia's starting XI and finished it collecting the player-of-the-match award after being activated as Cameron Green's concussion substitute part-way through the run chase. Green was struck on the left side of his head while facing South African seam bowler Kagiso Rabada. The match was paused as Green was checked by medical staff with cameras showing swelling and blood where the ball had struck. 'That stung Green,' the commentator said. ' You can see the skin broke just behind the left ear, and the swelling. 'This (concussion check) is all necessary given the sickening blow to the head of Cameron Green. 'He hasn't got much time, he's got fractions of a second to react to a steep bouncer.'

'When I came back from the Ashes, I had three to four weeks off, then went back to the drawing board and really thought about what I wanted to improve in my one-day game,' said Labuschagne, whose 53.36 Test average dwarfs the 31.37 he had averaged in ODIs before his Bloemfontein knock. 'That's gone really downhill and I really didn't like that,' he said. 'I've been really disappointed with the way I've played my one-day cricket the last 10 to 12 games. 'I haven't shown the intensity and courage that I would have liked. 'I wasn't too shocked when I was dropped, I said that to the selectors, 'I understand, I haven't made runs'. 'I did say I still want to be that person for you batting in the middle order. 'I addressed a few things that I wanted to improve on.' Labuschagne clubbed 80 runs in his knock to help set up the Australian victory in South Africa It was a measured innings for Labuschagne, who came in with Australia in trouble and batted through to the end with tail-enders including Ashton Agar (pictured) Australia had bowled out South Africa for 222 - an innings held together brilliantly by captain Temba Bavuma, who became just the 13th opener and second South African - after Herschelle Gibbs in 2000 - to carry his bat in an ODI innings with his unbeaten 114. But in their reply, Australia lost a soldier in the sixth over when Green was thumped in the helmet by a vicious Kagiso Rabada bumper. It was the cue for Labuschagne to rise from the bench and bat with both purpose and calmness. 'The opportunity that comes when you're concussion sub is sometimes a bit of a free hit,' he said. 'The pressure of the game is still there but the expectation is probably not as much on you. 'It was nice to contribute today even though at the start of the day I wasn't even in the side.' Still, wickets tumbled around him as Australia stumbled to 7-113 in the 17th over. Labuschagne was joined by Ashton Agar and the duo batted sensibly, appearing largely untroubled as they added 112 in a magnificent, unbroken eighth-wicket stand. 'We haven't batted much together, or at all,' Labuschagne said. 'It was a lot of fun. 'He's a very relaxed character and he showed great patience, great concentration and just stuck to that plan. 'We kept each other going to not get out of our bubble and not force it too much.' Marnus has made a huge impact in the Test arena but was left out of the ODI World Cup squad Australia can modify its squad before the World Cup, which could pave the way for Labuschagne to force his way in Labuschagne, famously, became the first concussion sub in Test history when he replaced Steve Smith during the Lord's Test of the 2019 Ashes series, which proved a defining moment of his career. He also was originally left out of this ODI series and was only recalled because of Smith's wrist injury. Timing is everything. Labuschagne missed selection in Australia's 15-man squad for the upcoming World Cup but he will be willing and ready to jump in should a vacancy arise. 'You've just got to sit tight and wait for your opportunities,' he said. 'When the opportunity comes you've got to be ready.' Earlier, Bavuma had defied leg cramps and a difficult pitch to post his fifth ODI century and single-handedly give his team hope, with Josh Hazlewood (3-41) and Stoinis (2-20) proving Australia's best with the ball.

India is a wonderful nation. I remember when we signed Sachin Tendulkar in 1992. You couldn't wish to meet a nicer lad. He was only 19 but he played well and developed into one of the greatest of all time. I umpired my last Test match against India at Lord's and I wanted it to be against India because they played the game in the right spirit. Whenever I umpired Tests and World Cups in India, they looked after me. I even once filmed a Pepsi advert in Mumbai where I was dressed as a judge! I have just been watching Yorkshire at Scarborough and everyone I spoke to didn't know which way it was going to go. Whatever happens, I'd like to see Yorkshire rise again to the power it used to be. Sir Donald Bradman told me when I had lunch with him in Adelaide that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is the greatest club in the world. All I want is to see Yorkshire fighting for the County Championship, back to being the best club in the world.

Mail Sport has been told that the ECB would have no objection to the Royals taking control at Yorkshire following our revelation of their £25million offer to buy the club, while the governing body are also considering changes to the structure of the Hundred to facilitate foreign investment. The eight city-based Hundred teams are currently fully owned by the ECB, but plans are in place to hand over 33 per cent of each franchise to its constituent counties and permit private investors to buy 33 per cent. The ECB would retain their one-third ownership of each team as well as owning the overall competition, with more detailed talks with the counties planned later this month. The ECB’s proposal would enable them to cut their spending on the Hundred significantly at a time when they under financial pressure, as well as increasing the chances of attracting foreign investors. Rajasthan Royals have launched a takeover bid for Yorkshire County Cricket Club (above) Sources told Mail Sport Rajasthan have plans to bring in their own executives to run the club Yorkshire need to raise funds to pay £15m owed to the family trust of ex-chairman Colin Graves Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that the ECB have shelved plans to increase the match fees paid to England’s male players after committing to parity for the women’s players, a key demand of the damning Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket report published earlier this summer. IPL sources have told Mail Sport that most of the 10 Indian franchises would want to buy into the Hundred teams if they became available, with interest from Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians understood to be particularly advanced. Many of the IPL owners spend much of the summer in England and have been regularly seen at Hundred games over the last two years. Any investment in the Hundred would have to be signed off by the all-powerful Board of Cricket for Control in India. A clause in the IPL staging agreement states that teams cannot invest in areas that are seen as competitors to the IPL or BCCI, although they have already permitted their franchises to buy teams in the Caribbean, South Africa, United States and UAE so are unlikely to object to investment in England. Rajasthan’s offer to Yorkshire appears to have divided opinion in the county ahead of a potential vote of the membership, which would follow any acceptance by the Board. Legendary former Yorkshire player, umpire and club president Dickie Bird writes in Mail Sport today that a Rajasthan takeover would be a “very big success,” but ex-chairman Robin Smith takes the opposite view, telling Mail Sport that “a sale of one of the English game’s foremost clubs to outside interests should be unthinkable.” As Mail Sport reported Rajasthan have offered a convertible loan to Yorkshire which would ultimately see them take full control at Headingley. The other main offer on the table is a proposal from Mike Ashley to buy the stadium and lease it back to the club, which is an avenue Rajasthan could also explore if Yorkshire are insistent on remaining a members’ club.

An exciting victory over Forres last time out gave Counties a spotless league record of 12 wins out of 12, backing up the Senior League title with an invincible season. The always-dangerous Pal Dhami led the way for Forres, who batted first on home turf, scoring 61. Sajid Muhammad (49), Fraser Merricks (34) and Gus Farr (32) also contributed valuable runs, as Forres set their opponents a target of 232 for victory from their 40 overs. Of Counties' bowlers, meanwhile, Lewis Pacey, Nuwan Eshwara and Shaun Thomas took two wickets apiece. It was a very competitive total, but Counties did not back down from the challenge and set about proactively trying to put pressure on the Forres bowlers. Shaun Thomas carried his bat, scoring 64 not out, with his best partnership coming with Richard Smith (41). Captain Will Ford (27 not out) strode to the crease determined to get his side over the line, and would eventually hit the winning runs himself with an over to spare to cap off the league season. \"Losing to Forres in the League Cup final earlier this season was a bit of a kick in the stones, because we felt that we should have done better for ourselves there,\" Ford said. \"It's easy to look at the negatives, but we went the whole league season without losing and that last game against Forres, everyone was saying it's one of the best games of cricket they have been involved in. \"Chasing 231 batting second, we went and got the runs quite easily with five wickets in hand. It wasn't boring, there was a bit of grit and determination, a bit of angst, a bit of everything really. It was everything you'd want from sport. \"We showed that we're not just a team that bats first and then controls people with our bowling and fielding, so it was enjoyable, very much so. \"Me and Shaun don't often get to bat together, but we've known each other since we were knee-high to a grasshopper. \"It was nice to go out and hit the winning runs with him there in the middle and enjoy that with him. \"It was the perfect ending to a perfect season.\" There is still one more match for Northern Counties to play this season, though, and they could make it a trophy double. The T20 Cup final was originally supposed to be played earlier in the summer, but weather conditions meant it was postponed until this Saturday. Again, Forres will be their opponents, and while Ford would rather not have the winner-take-all element in the final game of the year he is confident that Counties are capable of coming out on top once again. \"I'm glad they haven't left it another couple of weeks, because by that time everyone would have disappeared and started to hibernate,\" he reasoned. \"We could finish the season with two trophies in two weeks, which would be nice, but at the same time it would have been nice to finish on the high of last Saturday. \"Now we might finish the season with a loss in a cup final, which isn't the best, but we'll just have to do what we can to make sure that doesn't happen. \"Cricket is always a bit of fun, but especially in T20. We've got a strong team, so we just have to go and do what we do best. \"If we bat and bowl well, and be the team we have been all season, I'd hope we can come out on top.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-07 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"inverness_courier","source_priority":881874,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"546e6d4980abfe4a3935c462379dcd0d","title":"Pressure on ‘unsettled’ India to win World Cup at home: Shoaib Akhtar","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/09/08/pressure-on-unsettled-india-to-win-world-cup-at-home-shoaib-akhtar/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: Playing at home, and with intense media scrutiny, will put the Indian cricket team under a lot of pressure in the upcoming World Cup, feels former Pakistan pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar.

Akhtar added the stage is set perfectly for Pakistan, the No. 1 ODI side, to lift the trophy and give the country something to cheer about amid the serious economic situation. India’s performance in ICC events has left much to be desired as they have yet to win a world title since the 2013 Champions Trophy triumph under Mahendra Singh Dhoni. “Pakistan’s going to be all lonely there (in India). Having said that, they will be under no pressure. Playing at home, in front of own crowd, all the pressure will be on India; we will do better,” Akhtar said during a virtual press conference organised by Star Sports. “All the stadiums will be packed, and more than two billion people will be following the live action on TV or social media and what not. The Indian media will put an incredible amount of pressure on Pakistan, they will build it up like Mahabharata. They will already declare India as the winners… that’s an uncalled amount of pressure to have ahead of the game. “(But) Rohit Sharma and India are going to face a lot of pressure because of that.” India will take on Pakistan in the most-anticipated World Cup clash in Ahmedabad on October 14. But before that, they will clash in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup on Sunday, and may also head for a possible title showdown on September 17. Akhtar said the Indian team is still “unsettled” with less than a month left for the World Cup, beginning on October 5. “Why do I have this feeling… why India could not pick their XI in last two years. It’s a very strange thing to me that your squad is not settled. Who is your No. 4, where will Virat (Kohli) play 3, 4 or 5? Ishan Kishan looks amazing, can bat anywhere. “Hardik Pandya is an asset. Look what he has done with Gujarat Titans (in IPL). “But India is not being a settled squad for (the) last two years, this is a very strange thing for me. Who will occupy which slot?” he asked. “I’m all for Rohit, Virat, but everyday you got to perform because you got a name. You have to be out there, and lead by example. But the bowling and batting both look unsettled to me.”. “Why did Indian selectors ignore Chahal?” Akhtar also questioned the Indian selectors for ignoring Yuzvendra Chahal for the World Cup. “Not picking Chahal is beyond me. The problem with India is that when they get out for 150-200, they will increase the batters but never the bowlers. “What do you expect if you want to take batting till No. 8. If the top-five can’t contribute, what will (No.) 7-8 do? You are banking on (Ravindra) Jadeja? I believe that you (India) are playing with one bowler less.” He also took a dig at Rohit and said Shaheen Afridi was playing on the Indian skipper’s mind after the Pakistani quick cleaned him up in the Asia Cup. “Yeh Rohit Sharma woh Rohit Sharma hai hi nahi. Yeh uska stunt double hai (This is not the same Rohit Sharma. This is his stunt double),” said Akhtar. “Shaheen has made his way into his mind. I have never seen Rohit change his stance, but what was happening there (in Sri Lanka)? He (Rohit) changed it (stance), was beaten and bowled. Shaheen is subconsciously in his mind. This is what the pressure of an India versus Pakistan match does to players,” he added. “Stage set for Pakistan to lift the Cup, revive economy” Akhtar said Pakistan will have the advantage as all the attention will be on the home team. “Pakistan, on the other hand, will be all lonely with only 15 members there, sticking together. (I) will tell them to play ‘without fear’.” Akhtar added he had an intuition that this World Cup will go to Pakistan. “Why this World Cup is so important for us, because it will be special playing in India and winning in India. I don’t know, I may be wrong… but this stage is being set for an India-Pakistan final and particularly for Pakistan. “I will be praying that the Pakistan team wins because we are struggling with economic reforms, and our critical financial situation. This is the only thing that can lift the nation… if we lift the World Cup in India and before that the Asia Cup,” he said. “Pace trio reminds me of old days” Hailing Pakistan’s three-pronged pace attack of Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf, Akhtar said it reminded him of the Wasim Akram-Waqar Younis generation. “This pace battery reminds me of the old days, the era of two Ws. They are confident and have a similar mindset of taking wickets,” he said. The Pakistani trio has taken 23 wickets in the first three matches of the Asia Cup. Afridi had ripped the Indian top order in their rain-interrupted clash in Pallekele on September 2. “I would say Shaheen is on top of his career right now, while Haris Rauf has a wicket-taking mindset. I would advise Naseem to bowl more wicket-taking deliveries. He’s not the stock bowler, I’ve told the team management.” PTI Pressure on ‘unsettled’ India to win World Cup at home: Shoaib Akhtar added by Press Trust of India on 12:40 am September 8, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-09-07 19:10:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","source_priority":1088812,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7690fdd27f68b5dd1c1dbf28b4dd52ba","title":"'Concussion Substitute Legend' Fans React After Marnus Labuschagne Plays Match-Winning Knock Replacing Injured Cameron Green During SA vs AUS 1st ODI 2023","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/concussion-substitute-legend-fans-react-after-marnus-labuschagnes-match-winning-knock-replacing-injured-cameron-green-during-sa-vs-aus-1st-odi-2023-5396298.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Marnus Labuschagne becomes the first ever player to be come in the xi as concussion substitute twice and hit half centuries both times.","content":"What is your reaction to Karenjit Kaur: The Untold Story of Sunny Leone?

He had gone down in India's pecking order and Kolkata Knight Riders benched him for the whole of that IPL season. But within the last year or so Kuldeep has managed to change his status to become one of the automatic picks in India's World Cup-bound 15 which was announced on Tuesday. Kuldeep has also nosed ahead of leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and off-spinners R Ashwin and Washington Sundar in the India scheme of things. His claim has the backing of numbers as well. So far this year, the left-arm wrist spinner has taken 23 wickets from 13 ODIs – the highest by an Indian bowler. So, how did he bring in that metamorphosis? \"Determination,\" said Kuldeep's childhood coach Kapil Pandey. \"He was heart-broken. Forget about playing for India, he was not even getting the game-time with KKR. It is important for a bowler to keep working on his skills to improve his craft. \"But he was not ready to give up and kept training with me for a long time at the nets. We worked on many things like delivery speed etc that could help his bowling,\" said Pandey. But then any cricketer needs the help of an expert hand, someone who has seen it and done it all kind, to expand his craft. For Kuldeep, that person was Sunil Joshi. The former India left-arm spinner took Kuldeep under his wings and imparted some valuable lessons at the NCA. Advertisement \"In fact, I was in the selection panel when Kuldeep went down the line. It was not a pleasant sight to see a talented bowler going down. So, we met at the NCA and prepared a path ahead,\" Joshi told PTI. Joshi said Kuldeep, at that time, was a bit low on confidence and needed to tweak his bowling as well. Days of hard work followed at the NCA nets. \"We were mainly focusing on technical aspects like reducing his strides, increasing his arm speed so that he can bowl a bit quicker through the air. His action and approach (to the bowling crease) needed to be rectified,\" said Joshi. During the time when he was in turmoil, Kuldeep had lost his accuracy and zip off the pitch that made him look pedestrian, and he leaked plenty of runs too. Joshi suggested a few changes, and Kuldeep diligently worked on it. \"He was not having focus then, you know, the all over everywhere kind of bowling. But now, if you observe, he has lined up the batsmen well – his bowling arm is right in front of the batter, and even his strides are directed at the batter,\" said Joshi. A change of IPL franchise too worked wonders well for Kuldeep in this period – from KKR to Delhi Capitals. \"Kuldeep was telling me that he received plenty of backing at DC from (head coach) Ricky Ponting and assured him of good enough game-time. “It is important for a bowler to have the support of captain and coach, and that's why I think he excelled under MS Dhoni,\" said Pandey. Joshi has little doubt that Kuldeep will be Rohit Sharma's go-to bowler in the ODI World Cup. \"He has this ability to take the ball away from the left-handers, and he needs to use his stock ball (one that comes in if a batter is right-handed) against them. \"It will be handy for India because many teams have 2 or 3 left-handers in their batting order. \"While bowling against the right-hander, Kuldeep will have to make use of that one that goes away from them (the wrong'un), as it will keep them in doubt,\" said Joshi. Joshi said Kuldeep is a natural predator, and the team should make use of that quality to the hilt. \"He is a wicket-taking bowler, who will come in very handy in the middle-overs. Bowlers like (Ravindra) Jadeja or Axar (Patel) purchase wickets by limiting the run flow, thereby building pressure. \"But Kuldeep can pick up wickets under any conditions just by his variations. So, it will be exciting to watch him in the World Cup,\" he added.","pubDate":"2023-09-07 17:13:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e34615c06f089d25b1910b142e49cbdf","title":"पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांची एक नंबरी कामगिरी, प्रतिस्पर्धी फलंदाजांना भरतेय धडकी","link":"https://marathi.abplive.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2023-most-wickets-pakistan-bowler-haris-rauf-naseem-shah-shaheen-afridi-1207671","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":["एबीपी माझा स्पोर्ट्स डेस्क"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan Asia Cup 2023 Records : आशिया चषकात आतापर्यंत पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी शानदार प्रदर्शन केले आहे. नेपाळ, भारत आणि बांगलादेश संघाविरोधात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला होता. पाकिस्तान संघाने पहिल्या सामन्यात नेपाळचा 238 धावांनी पराभव केला. त्यानंतर बांगलादेशचा सात विकेटने हरवले, भारताविरोधातील सामना रद्द झाला पण त्या सामन्यात वेगवान तिकडीने संपूर्ण संघाला गारद केले. आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी सर्वाधिक विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. आघाडीचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पाकिस्तानचेच आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदी, नसीम शाह आणि हॅरिस रौफ यांच्या माऱ्यापुढे प्रतिस्पर्धी फलंदाजांना धडकी भरते. गोलंदाजीच नव्हे तर फलंदाजीतही पाकिस्तानचे फलंदाज आघाडीवर आहेत. आग ओकणारी गोलंदाजी -  आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला आहे. सर्वाधिक विकेटमध्ये पाकिस्तानचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पहिल्या तीन क्रमांकावर आहे. हॅरिस रौफ याने सर्वाधिक नऊ विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. हॅरिस रौफ याने तीन सामन्यात नऊ फलंदाजांची शिकार केला आहे. यादरम्यान त्याने 20 षटके गोलंदाजी केली असून 93 धावा खर्च केल्या.  नसीम शाह दुसऱ्य क्रमांकावर आहे, त्याने सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. नसीम शाह याने आशिया चषकात 19.3 षटके गोलंदाजी करत 117 धावा खर्च केल्या आहेत. डावखुरा शाहीन आफ्रिदी तिसऱ्या क्रमांकावर आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदीने तीन सामन्यात 22 षटकात 104 धावा खर्च करत सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. भारतासाठी सर्वाधिक विकेट रविंद्र जाडेजा आणि मोहम्मद शामी यांनी घेतल्या आहेत. या दोघांच्या नावावर एका सामन्यात तीन तीन विकेट आहेत.  फलंदाजीचा लेखाजोखा -  आशिया चषकात सर्वाधिक धावा बांगलादेशच्या मजमुल शंतो याच्या नावावर आहे. शंतो याने दोन सामन्यात 193 धावा चोपल्या आहेत. पाकिस्तानचा कर्णधार बाबर आझम दुसऱ्या क्रमांकावर आहे. त्याने तीन सामन्यात 168 धावा केल्या आहेत. मेहंदी हसन याने तीन सामन्यात 117 धावा केल्या आहेत. भारताकडून सर्वाधिक धावा हार्दिक पांड्याच्या नावावर आहेत. पांड्याने एका सामन्यात 87 धावा केल्या आहेत. दुसऱ्या क्रमांकावर रोहित शर्मा आहे. रोहित शर्माने दोन सामन्यात 85 धावा केल्या आहेत.  सुपर 4 मध्ये पाकिस्तानची दमदार सुरुवात -  आशियाच चषकातील सुपर 4 फेरीच्या सामन्याला सुरुवात झाली आहे. पाकिस्तान संघाने पहिल्याच सामन्यात बांगलादेशचा सात विकेटने पराभव केला. बांगलादेशने प्रथम फलंदाजी करताना फक्त 193 धावा केल्या आहेत. पाकिस्तान संघाने हे आव्हान तीन विकेटच्या मोबदल्यात 39.3 षटकात सहज पार केले. पाकिस्तानच्या भेदक गोलंदाजीसमोर बांगलादेशचा संपूर्ण संघ 193 धावांत तंबूत परतला होता. 10 सप्टेंबरो रोजी भारत आणि पाकिस्तान यांच्यात सामना होणार आहे. भारताविरोधात पाकिस्तानचे गोलंदाज कशी कामगिरी करतात..याकडे क्रीडा चाहत्यांचे लक्ष लागलेय. ","content":"Pakistan Asia Cup 2023 Records : आशिया चषकात आतापर्यंत पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी शानदार प्रदर्शन केले आहे. नेपाळ, भारत आणि बांगलादेश संघाविरोधात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला होता. पाकिस्तान संघाने पहिल्या सामन्यात नेपाळचा 238 धावांनी पराभव केला. त्यानंतर बांगलादेशचा सात विकेटने हरवले, भारताविरोधातील सामना रद्द झाला पण त्या सामन्यात वेगवान तिकडीने संपूर्ण संघाला गारद केले. आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी सर्वाधिक विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. आघाडीचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पाकिस्तानचेच आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदी, नसीम शाह आणि हॅरिस रौफ यांच्या माऱ्यापुढे प्रतिस्पर्धी फलंदाजांना धडकी भरते. गोलंदाजीच नव्हे तर फलंदाजीतही पाकिस्तानचे फलंदाज आघाडीवर आहेत. आग ओकणारी गोलंदाजी - आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला आहे. सर्वाधिक विकेटमध्ये पाकिस्तानचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पहिल्या तीन क्रमांकावर आहे. हॅरिस रौफ याने सर्वाधिक नऊ विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. हॅरिस रौफ याने तीन सामन्यात नऊ फलंदाजांची शिकार केला आहे. यादरम्यान त्याने 20 षटके गोलंदाजी केली असून 93 धावा खर्च केल्या. नसीम शाह दुसऱ्य क्रमांकावर आहे, त्याने सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. नसीम शाह याने आशिया चषकात 19.3 षटके गोलंदाजी करत 117 धावा खर्च केल्या आहेत. डावखुरा शाहीन आफ्रिदी तिसऱ्या क्रमांकावर आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदीने तीन सामन्यात 22 षटकात 104 धावा खर्च करत सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. भारतासाठी सर्वाधिक विकेट रविंद्र जाडेजा आणि मोहम्मद शामी यांनी घेतल्या आहेत. या दोघांच्या नावावर एका सामन्यात तीन तीन विकेट आहेत. फलंदाजीचा लेखाजोखा - googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-6601185-5\");

Labuschagne started Thursday's clash (Friday morning AEST) out of Australia's starting XI and finished it collecting the player-of-the-match award after being activated as Cameron Green's concussion substitute part-way through the run chase. Green was struck on the left side of his head while facing South African seam bowler Kagiso Rabada. The match was paused as Green was checked by medical staff with cameras showing swelling and blood where the ball had struck. 'That stung Green,' the commentator said. ' You can see the skin broke just behind the left ear, and the swelling. 'This (concussion check) is all necessary given the sickening blow to the head of Cameron Green. 'He hasn't got much time, he's got fractions of a second to react to a steep bouncer.'

'When I came back from the Ashes, I had three to four weeks off, then went back to the drawing board and really thought about what I wanted to improve in my one-day game,' said Labuschagne, whose 53.36 Test average dwarfs the 31.37 he had averaged in ODIs before his Bloemfontein knock. 'That's gone really downhill and I really didn't like that,' he said. 'I've been really disappointed with the way I've played my one-day cricket the last 10 to 12 games. 'I haven't shown the intensity and courage that I would have liked. 'I wasn't too shocked when I was dropped, I said that to the selectors, 'I understand, I haven't made runs'. 'I did say I still want to be that person for you batting in the middle order. 'I addressed a few things that I wanted to improve on.' Labuschagne clubbed 80 runs in his knock to help set up the Australian victory in South Africa It was a measured innings for Labuschagne, who came in with Australia in trouble and batted through to the end with tail-enders including Ashton Agar (pictured) Australia had bowled out South Africa for 222 - an innings held together brilliantly by captain Temba Bavuma, who became just the 13th opener and second South African - after Herschelle Gibbs in 2000 - to carry his bat in an ODI innings with his unbeaten 114. But in their reply, Australia lost a soldier in the sixth over when Green was thumped in the helmet by a vicious Kagiso Rabada bumper. It was the cue for Labuschagne to rise from the bench and bat with both purpose and calmness. 'The opportunity that comes when you're concussion sub is sometimes a bit of a free hit,' he said. 'The pressure of the game is still there but the expectation is probably not as much on you. 'It was nice to contribute today even though at the start of the day I wasn't even in the side.' Still, wickets tumbled around him as Australia stumbled to 7-113 in the 17th over. Labuschagne was joined by Ashton Agar and the duo batted sensibly, appearing largely untroubled as they added 112 in a magnificent, unbroken eighth-wicket stand. 'We haven't batted much together, or at all,' Labuschagne said. 'It was a lot of fun. 'He's a very relaxed character and he showed great patience, great concentration and just stuck to that plan. 'We kept each other going to not get out of our bubble and not force it too much.' Marnus has made a huge impact in the Test arena but was left out of the ODI World Cup squad Australia can modify its squad before the World Cup, which could pave the way for Labuschagne to force his way in Labuschagne, famously, became the first concussion sub in Test history when he replaced Steve Smith during the Lord's Test of the 2019 Ashes series, which proved a defining moment of his career. He also was originally left out of this ODI series and was only recalled because of Smith's wrist injury. Timing is everything. Labuschagne missed selection in Australia's 15-man squad for the upcoming World Cup but he will be willing and ready to jump in should a vacancy arise. 'You've just got to sit tight and wait for your opportunities,' he said. 'When the opportunity comes you've got to be ready.' Earlier, Bavuma had defied leg cramps and a difficult pitch to post his fifth ODI century and single-handedly give his team hope, with Josh Hazlewood (3-41) and Stoinis (2-20) proving Australia's best with the ball.

India is a wonderful nation. I remember when we signed Sachin Tendulkar in 1992. You couldn't wish to meet a nicer lad. He was only 19 but he played well and developed into one of the greatest of all time. I umpired my last Test match against India at Lord's and I wanted it to be against India because they played the game in the right spirit. Whenever I umpired Tests and World Cups in India, they looked after me. I even once filmed a Pepsi advert in Mumbai where I was dressed as a judge! I have just been watching Yorkshire at Scarborough and everyone I spoke to didn't know which way it was going to go. Whatever happens, I'd like to see Yorkshire rise again to the power it used to be.

Mail Sport has been told that the ECB would have no objection to the Royals taking control at Yorkshire following our revelation of their £25million offer to buy the club, while the governing body are also considering changes to the structure of the Hundred to facilitate foreign investment. The eight city-based Hundred teams are currently fully owned by the ECB, but plans are in place to hand over 33 per cent of each franchise to its constituent counties and permit private investors to buy 33 per cent. The ECB would retain their one-third ownership of each team as well as owning the overall competition, with more detailed talks with the counties planned later this month. The ECB’s proposal would enable them to cut their spending on the Hundred significantly at a time when they under financial pressure, as well as increasing the chances of attracting foreign investors. Rajasthan Royals have launched a takeover bid for Yorkshire County Cricket Club (above) Sources told Mail Sport Rajasthan have plans to bring in their own executives to run the club Yorkshire need to raise funds to pay £15m owed to the family trust of ex-chairman Colin Graves Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that the ECB have shelved plans to increase the match fees paid to England’s male players after committing to parity for the women’s players, a key demand of the damning Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket report published earlier this summer. IPL sources have told Mail Sport that most of the 10 Indian franchises would want to buy into the Hundred teams if they became available, with interest from Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians understood to be particularly advanced. Many of the IPL owners spend much of the summer in England and have been regularly seen at Hundred games over the last two years. Any investment in the Hundred would have to be signed off by the all-powerful Board of Cricket for Control in India. A clause in the IPL staging agreement states that teams cannot invest in areas that are seen as competitors to the IPL or BCCI, although they have already permitted their franchises to buy teams in the Caribbean, South Africa, United States and UAE so are unlikely to object to investment in England. Rajasthan’s offer to Yorkshire appears to have divided opinion in the county ahead of a potential vote of the membership, which would follow any acceptance by the Board. Legendary former Yorkshire player, umpire and club president Dickie Bird writes in Mail Sport today that a Rajasthan takeover would be a “very big success,” but ex-chairman Robin Smith takes the opposite view, telling Mail Sport that “a sale of one of the English game’s foremost clubs to outside interests should be unthinkable.” As Mail Sport reported Rajasthan have offered a convertible loan to Yorkshire which would ultimately see them take full control at Headingley. The other main offer on the table is a proposal from Mike Ashley to buy the stadium and lease it back to the club, which is an avenue Rajasthan could also explore if Yorkshire are insistent on remaining a members’ club.

An exciting victory over Forres last time out gave Counties a spotless league record of 12 wins out of 12, backing up the Senior League title with an invincible season. The always-dangerous Pal Dhami led the way for Forres, who batted first on home turf, scoring 61. Sajid Muhammad (49), Fraser Merricks (34) and Gus Farr (32) also contributed valuable runs, as Forres set their opponents a target of 232 for victory from their 40 overs. Of Counties' bowlers, meanwhile, Lewis Pacey, Nuwan Eshwara and Shaun Thomas took two wickets apiece. It was a very competitive total, but Counties did not back down from the challenge and set about proactively trying to put pressure on the Forres bowlers. Shaun Thomas carried his bat, scoring 64 not out, with his best partnership coming with Richard Smith (41). Captain Will Ford (27 not out) strode to the crease determined to get his side over the line, and would eventually hit the winning runs himself with an over to spare to cap off the league season. \"Losing to Forres in the League Cup final earlier this season was a bit of a kick in the stones, because we felt that we should have done better for ourselves there,\" Ford said. \"It's easy to look at the negatives, but we went the whole league season without losing and that last game against Forres, everyone was saying it's one of the best games of cricket they have been involved in. \"Chasing 231 batting second, we went and got the runs quite easily with five wickets in hand. It wasn't boring, there was a bit of grit and determination, a bit of angst, a bit of everything really. It was everything you'd want from sport. \"We showed that we're not just a team that bats first and then controls people with our bowling and fielding, so it was enjoyable, very much so. \"Me and Shaun don't often get to bat together, but we've known each other since we were knee-high to a grasshopper. \"It was nice to go out and hit the winning runs with him there in the middle and enjoy that with him. \"It was the perfect ending to a perfect season.\" There is still one more match for Northern Counties to play this season, though, and they could make it a trophy double. The T20 Cup final was originally supposed to be played earlier in the summer, but weather conditions meant it was postponed until this Saturday. Again, Forres will be their opponents, and while Ford would rather not have the winner-take-all element in the final game of the year he is confident that Counties are capable of coming out on top once again. \"I'm glad they haven't left it another couple of weeks, because by that time everyone would have disappeared and started to hibernate,\" he reasoned. \"We could finish the season with two trophies in two weeks, which would be nice, but at the same time it would have been nice to finish on the high of last Saturday. \"Now we might finish the season with a loss in a cup final, which isn't the best, but we'll just have to do what we can to make sure that doesn't happen. \"Cricket is always a bit of fun, but especially in T20. We've got a strong team, so we just have to go and do what we do best. \"If we bat and bowl well, and be the team we have been all season, I'd hope we can come out on top.\"","pubDate":"2023-09-07 20:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"inverness_courier","source_priority":881874,"country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"546e6d4980abfe4a3935c462379dcd0d","title":"Pressure on ‘unsettled’ India to win World Cup at home: Shoaib Akhtar","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2023/09/08/pressure-on-unsettled-india-to-win-world-cup-at-home-shoaib-akhtar/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: Playing at home, and with intense media scrutiny, will put the Indian cricket team under a lot of pressure in the upcoming World Cup, feels former Pakistan pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar.

Akhtar added the stage is set perfectly for Pakistan, the No. 1 ODI side, to lift the trophy and give the country something to cheer about amid the serious economic situation. India’s performance in ICC events has left much to be desired as they have yet to win a world title since the 2013 Champions Trophy triumph under Mahendra Singh Dhoni. “Pakistan’s going to be all lonely there (in India). Having said that, they will be under no pressure. Playing at home, in front of own crowd, all the pressure will be on India; we will do better,” Akhtar said during a virtual press conference organised by Star Sports. “All the stadiums will be packed, and more than two billion people will be following the live action on TV or social media and what not. The Indian media will put an incredible amount of pressure on Pakistan, they will build it up like Mahabharata. They will already declare India as the winners… that’s an uncalled amount of pressure to have ahead of the game. “(But) Rohit Sharma and India are going to face a lot of pressure because of that.” India will take on Pakistan in the most-anticipated World Cup clash in Ahmedabad on October 14. But before that, they will clash in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup on Sunday, and may also head for a possible title showdown on September 17. Akhtar said the Indian team is still “unsettled” with less than a month left for the World Cup, beginning on October 5. “Why do I have this feeling… why India could not pick their XI in last two years. It’s a very strange thing to me that your squad is not settled. Who is your No. 4, where will Virat (Kohli) play 3, 4 or 5? Ishan Kishan looks amazing, can bat anywhere. “Hardik Pandya is an asset. Look what he has done with Gujarat Titans (in IPL). “But India is not being a settled squad for (the) last two years, this is a very strange thing for me. Who will occupy which slot?” he asked. “I’m all for Rohit, Virat, but everyday you got to perform because you got a name. You have to be out there, and lead by example. But the bowling and batting both look unsettled to me.”. “Why did Indian selectors ignore Chahal?” Akhtar also questioned the Indian selectors for ignoring Yuzvendra Chahal for the World Cup. “Not picking Chahal is beyond me. The problem with India is that when they get out for 150-200, they will increase the batters but never the bowlers. “What do you expect if you want to take batting till No. 8. If the top-five can’t contribute, what will (No.) 7-8 do? You are banking on (Ravindra) Jadeja? I believe that you (India) are playing with one bowler less.” He also took a dig at Rohit and said Shaheen Afridi was playing on the Indian skipper’s mind after the Pakistani quick cleaned him up in the Asia Cup. “Yeh Rohit Sharma woh Rohit Sharma hai hi nahi. Yeh uska stunt double hai (This is not the same Rohit Sharma. This is his stunt double),” said Akhtar. “Shaheen has made his way into his mind. I have never seen Rohit change his stance, but what was happening there (in Sri Lanka)? He (Rohit) changed it (stance), was beaten and bowled. Shaheen is subconsciously in his mind. This is what the pressure of an India versus Pakistan match does to players,” he added. “Stage set for Pakistan to lift the Cup, revive economy” Akhtar said Pakistan will have the advantage as all the attention will be on the home team. “Pakistan, on the other hand, will be all lonely with only 15 members there, sticking together. (I) will tell them to play ‘without fear’.” Akhtar added he had an intuition that this World Cup will go to Pakistan. “Why this World Cup is so important for us, because it will be special playing in India and winning in India. I don’t know, I may be wrong… but this stage is being set for an India-Pakistan final and particularly for Pakistan. “I will be praying that the Pakistan team wins because we are struggling with economic reforms, and our critical financial situation. This is the only thing that can lift the nation… if we lift the World Cup in India and before that the Asia Cup,” he said. “Pace trio reminds me of old days” Hailing Pakistan’s three-pronged pace attack of Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf, Akhtar said it reminded him of the Wasim Akram-Waqar Younis generation. “This pace battery reminds me of the old days, the era of two Ws. They are confident and have a similar mindset of taking wickets,” he said. The Pakistani trio has taken 23 wickets in the first three matches of the Asia Cup. Afridi had ripped the Indian top order in their rain-interrupted clash in Pallekele on September 2. “I would say Shaheen is on top of his career right now, while Haris Rauf has a wicket-taking mindset. I would advise Naseem to bowl more wicket-taking deliveries. He’s not the stock bowler, I’ve told the team management.” PTI Pressure on ‘unsettled’ India to win World Cup at home: Shoaib Akhtar added by Press Trust of India on 12:40 am September 8, 2023 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2023-09-07 19:10:16","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","source_priority":1088812,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"7690fdd27f68b5dd1c1dbf28b4dd52ba","title":"'Concussion Substitute Legend' Fans React After Marnus Labuschagne Plays Match-Winning Knock Replacing Injured Cameron Green During SA vs AUS 1st ODI 2023","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/concussion-substitute-legend-fans-react-after-marnus-labuschagnes-match-winning-knock-replacing-injured-cameron-green-during-sa-vs-aus-1st-odi-2023-5396298.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Marnus Labuschagne becomes the first ever player to be come in the xi as concussion substitute twice and hit half centuries both times.","content":"What is your reaction to Karenjit Kaur: The Untold Story of Sunny Leone?

He had gone down in India's pecking order and Kolkata Knight Riders benched him for the whole of that IPL season. But within the last year or so Kuldeep has managed to change his status to become one of the automatic picks in India's World Cup-bound 15 which was announced on Tuesday. Kuldeep has also nosed ahead of leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and off-spinners R Ashwin and Washington Sundar in the India scheme of things. His claim has the backing of numbers as well. So far this year, the left-arm wrist spinner has taken 23 wickets from 13 ODIs – the highest by an Indian bowler. So, how did he bring in that metamorphosis? \"Determination,\" said Kuldeep's childhood coach Kapil Pandey. \"He was heart-broken. Forget about playing for India, he was not even getting the game-time with KKR. It is important for a bowler to keep working on his skills to improve his craft. \"But he was not ready to give up and kept training with me for a long time at the nets. We worked on many things like delivery speed etc that could help his bowling,\" said Pandey. But then any cricketer needs the help of an expert hand, someone who has seen it and done it all kind, to expand his craft. For Kuldeep, that person was Sunil Joshi. The former India left-arm spinner took Kuldeep under his wings and imparted some valuable lessons at the NCA. Advertisement \"In fact, I was in the selection panel when Kuldeep went down the line. It was not a pleasant sight to see a talented bowler going down. So, we met at the NCA and prepared a path ahead,\" Joshi told PTI. Joshi said Kuldeep, at that time, was a bit low on confidence and needed to tweak his bowling as well. Days of hard work followed at the NCA nets. \"We were mainly focusing on technical aspects like reducing his strides, increasing his arm speed so that he can bowl a bit quicker through the air. His action and approach (to the bowling crease) needed to be rectified,\" said Joshi. During the time when he was in turmoil, Kuldeep had lost his accuracy and zip off the pitch that made him look pedestrian, and he leaked plenty of runs too. Joshi suggested a few changes, and Kuldeep diligently worked on it. \"He was not having focus then, you know, the all over everywhere kind of bowling. But now, if you observe, he has lined up the batsmen well – his bowling arm is right in front of the batter, and even his strides are directed at the batter,\" said Joshi. A change of IPL franchise too worked wonders well for Kuldeep in this period – from KKR to Delhi Capitals. \"Kuldeep was telling me that he received plenty of backing at DC from (head coach) Ricky Ponting and assured him of good enough game-time. “It is important for a bowler to have the support of captain and coach, and that's why I think he excelled under MS Dhoni,\" said Pandey. Joshi has little doubt that Kuldeep will be Rohit Sharma's go-to bowler in the ODI World Cup. \"He has this ability to take the ball away from the left-handers, and he needs to use his stock ball (one that comes in if a batter is right-handed) against them. \"It will be handy for India because many teams have 2 or 3 left-handers in their batting order. \"While bowling against the right-hander, Kuldeep will have to make use of that one that goes away from them (the wrong'un), as it will keep them in doubt,\" said Joshi. Joshi said Kuldeep is a natural predator, and the team should make use of that quality to the hilt. \"He is a wicket-taking bowler, who will come in very handy in the middle-overs. Bowlers like (Ravindra) Jadeja or Axar (Patel) purchase wickets by limiting the run flow, thereby building pressure. \"But Kuldeep can pick up wickets under any conditions just by his variations. So, it will be exciting to watch him in the World Cup,\" he added.","pubDate":"2023-09-07 17:13:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"ndtv","source_priority":1204,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"e34615c06f089d25b1910b142e49cbdf","title":"पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांची एक नंबरी कामगिरी, प्रतिस्पर्धी फलंदाजांना भरतेय धडकी","link":"https://marathi.abplive.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2023-most-wickets-pakistan-bowler-haris-rauf-naseem-shah-shaheen-afridi-1207671","keywords":["क्रिकेट"],"creator":["एबीपी माझा स्पोर्ट्स डेस्क"],"video_url":null,"description":"Pakistan Asia Cup 2023 Records : आशिया चषकात आतापर्यंत पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी शानदार प्रदर्शन केले आहे. नेपाळ, भारत आणि बांगलादेश संघाविरोधात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला होता. पाकिस्तान संघाने पहिल्या सामन्यात नेपाळचा 238 धावांनी पराभव केला. त्यानंतर बांगलादेशचा सात विकेटने हरवले, भारताविरोधातील सामना रद्द झाला पण त्या सामन्यात वेगवान तिकडीने संपूर्ण संघाला गारद केले. आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी सर्वाधिक विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. आघाडीचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पाकिस्तानचेच आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदी, नसीम शाह आणि हॅरिस रौफ यांच्या माऱ्यापुढे प्रतिस्पर्धी फलंदाजांना धडकी भरते. गोलंदाजीच नव्हे तर फलंदाजीतही पाकिस्तानचे फलंदाज आघाडीवर आहेत. आग ओकणारी गोलंदाजी -  आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला आहे. सर्वाधिक विकेटमध्ये पाकिस्तानचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पहिल्या तीन क्रमांकावर आहे. हॅरिस रौफ याने सर्वाधिक नऊ विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. हॅरिस रौफ याने तीन सामन्यात नऊ फलंदाजांची शिकार केला आहे. यादरम्यान त्याने 20 षटके गोलंदाजी केली असून 93 धावा खर्च केल्या.  नसीम शाह दुसऱ्य क्रमांकावर आहे, त्याने सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. नसीम शाह याने आशिया चषकात 19.3 षटके गोलंदाजी करत 117 धावा खर्च केल्या आहेत. डावखुरा शाहीन आफ्रिदी तिसऱ्या क्रमांकावर आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदीने तीन सामन्यात 22 षटकात 104 धावा खर्च करत सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. भारतासाठी सर्वाधिक विकेट रविंद्र जाडेजा आणि मोहम्मद शामी यांनी घेतल्या आहेत. या दोघांच्या नावावर एका सामन्यात तीन तीन विकेट आहेत.  फलंदाजीचा लेखाजोखा -  आशिया चषकात सर्वाधिक धावा बांगलादेशच्या मजमुल शंतो याच्या नावावर आहे. शंतो याने दोन सामन्यात 193 धावा चोपल्या आहेत. पाकिस्तानचा कर्णधार बाबर आझम दुसऱ्या क्रमांकावर आहे. त्याने तीन सामन्यात 168 धावा केल्या आहेत. मेहंदी हसन याने तीन सामन्यात 117 धावा केल्या आहेत. भारताकडून सर्वाधिक धावा हार्दिक पांड्याच्या नावावर आहेत. पांड्याने एका सामन्यात 87 धावा केल्या आहेत. दुसऱ्या क्रमांकावर रोहित शर्मा आहे. रोहित शर्माने दोन सामन्यात 85 धावा केल्या आहेत.  सुपर 4 मध्ये पाकिस्तानची दमदार सुरुवात -  आशियाच चषकातील सुपर 4 फेरीच्या सामन्याला सुरुवात झाली आहे. पाकिस्तान संघाने पहिल्याच सामन्यात बांगलादेशचा सात विकेटने पराभव केला. बांगलादेशने प्रथम फलंदाजी करताना फक्त 193 धावा केल्या आहेत. पाकिस्तान संघाने हे आव्हान तीन विकेटच्या मोबदल्यात 39.3 षटकात सहज पार केले. पाकिस्तानच्या भेदक गोलंदाजीसमोर बांगलादेशचा संपूर्ण संघ 193 धावांत तंबूत परतला होता. 10 सप्टेंबरो रोजी भारत आणि पाकिस्तान यांच्यात सामना होणार आहे. भारताविरोधात पाकिस्तानचे गोलंदाज कशी कामगिरी करतात..याकडे क्रीडा चाहत्यांचे लक्ष लागलेय. ","content":"Pakistan Asia Cup 2023 Records : आशिया चषकात आतापर्यंत पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी शानदार प्रदर्शन केले आहे. नेपाळ, भारत आणि बांगलादेश संघाविरोधात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला होता. पाकिस्तान संघाने पहिल्या सामन्यात नेपाळचा 238 धावांनी पराभव केला. त्यानंतर बांगलादेशचा सात विकेटने हरवले, भारताविरोधातील सामना रद्द झाला पण त्या सामन्यात वेगवान तिकडीने संपूर्ण संघाला गारद केले. आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी सर्वाधिक विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. आघाडीचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पाकिस्तानचेच आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदी, नसीम शाह आणि हॅरिस रौफ यांच्या माऱ्यापुढे प्रतिस्पर्धी फलंदाजांना धडकी भरते. गोलंदाजीच नव्हे तर फलंदाजीतही पाकिस्तानचे फलंदाज आघाडीवर आहेत. आग ओकणारी गोलंदाजी - आशिया चषकात पाकिस्तानच्या गोलंदाजांनी भेदक मारा केला आहे. सर्वाधिक विकेटमध्ये पाकिस्तानचे तिन्ही गोलंदाज पहिल्या तीन क्रमांकावर आहे. हॅरिस रौफ याने सर्वाधिक नऊ विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. हॅरिस रौफ याने तीन सामन्यात नऊ फलंदाजांची शिकार केला आहे. यादरम्यान त्याने 20 षटके गोलंदाजी केली असून 93 धावा खर्च केल्या. नसीम शाह दुसऱ्य क्रमांकावर आहे, त्याने सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. नसीम शाह याने आशिया चषकात 19.3 षटके गोलंदाजी करत 117 धावा खर्च केल्या आहेत. डावखुरा शाहीन आफ्रिदी तिसऱ्या क्रमांकावर आहे. शाहीन आफ्रिदीने तीन सामन्यात 22 षटकात 104 धावा खर्च करत सात विकेट घेतल्या आहेत. भारतासाठी सर्वाधिक विकेट रविंद्र जाडेजा आणि मोहम्मद शामी यांनी घेतल्या आहेत. या दोघांच्या नावावर एका सामन्यात तीन तीन विकेट आहेत. फलंदाजीचा लेखाजोखा - googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-6601185-5\");
