There was no handshake between the captains.“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the match referee of the ICC code of conduct and the MCC laws pertaining to the spirit of cricket,” Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi wrote on social media.The PCB demanded the immediate removal of Pycroft from the remainder of the regional T20 tournament.The International Cricket Council has been contacted for comment.In his post-match press conference, Suryakumar said his team acted on the advice of the Indian government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).“We are aligned with the Indian government and the BCCI,” said Suryakumar when asked why his team did not shake hands with the Pakistan players.As a protest, Pakistan did not send their captain Agha to post-match duties.The two teams are likely to meet again in a Super Four match in Dubai on Sunday, provided Pakistan win their last group game against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday.They can also meet for a third time in the September 28 final in Dubai if results go their way.India and Pakistan were playing for the first time since cross-border hostilities in May left more than 70 people dead in missile, drone and artillery exchanges, before a ceasefire.The conflict was triggered by an April 22 attack on civilians in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing, a charge Islamabad denies.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-09-16 00:59:31","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/09/160551449145b39.webp","video_url":null,"source_id":"brecorder","source_name":"Business Recorder","source_priority":117973,"source_url":"https://www.brecorder.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/brecorder.png","language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["top","sports"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"2b0a41aba3d6befa8e2d26d78149e5cd","title":"Pakistan Bans Andy Pycroft Entry","link":"https://dailytimes.com.pk/1369282/pakistan-bans-andy-pycroft-entry/","keywords":["biased role","pakistan-india match controversy","pakistan","pakistan has banned referee","andy pycroft","latest","sports"],"creator":["Attia Naveed"],"description":"Pakistan has banned referee Andy Pycroft from entering the country.
