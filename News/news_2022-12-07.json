The New Zealand golfer, who finished second behind Rory McIlroy in the Race to Dubai DP World Tour standings, has one final challenge for the year before he puts his golf clubs away until 2023. Fox, who is currently ranked 29th, is headlining the inaugural Chasing the Fox challenge at the Royal Auckland and Grange Golf Club on Friday. The first of its kind in New Zealand, six Ambrose teams, plus Fox playing his own ball, will compete across six holes with the lowest score winning. There are no handicaps. The teams are made up of some of New Zealand’s best sporting talent across numerous codes. Fox will play two holes with each group. All Blacks Beauden Barrett, Jordie Barrett and Damien McKenzie form the rugby team, with Black Caps Lockie Ferguson, Ross Taylor and Mitch Santner representing cricket. The Olympics team features Eric Murray, Simon Child and Tom Abercrombie, while the Warriors team includes Shaun Johnson, Freddie Lusick and Wade Egan. John Key, Max Key and David Seymour make up the politics team, while Justin Marshall, Mark Richardson and Leon MacDonald form the legends team. “It’s a hard format. I did try earlier this year with some mates and played three-man Ambrose and they are all single figure handicappers and I got hammered. So I am going to have to play well; it will be fun,” Fox said. “It’s a nice exhibition for golf in New Zealand. I think we’ve got lots of celebrities who are mad keen on golf. Probably the big one on that is Eric Murray. I think Eric is keener on golf than I am to be honest and he seems to be super excited. Hopefully we will see a lot of people out there and we get some decent weather as well.” Tickets can be purchased for the event at Supersixgolf.com and teams of three can play the course before the main event begins at 5pm. Ryan Fox is looking forward to some time away from golf in New Zealand. Photo / Getty After Friday, Fox plans to spend as much time as possible out fishing on his boat while he is back in New Zealand. “I am generally pretty good about putting my clubs away. Will probably play socially with some mates, but still hoping to put the clubs away for three weeks or so and then get in to enjoying the Kiwi summer, Christmas with the family. I think I go away again [to the Middle East] on the 15th of January.” Fox will compete in the Abu Dhabi Championship and the Dubai Desert Classic before defending his title at the Ras Al Khaimah Championship in the UAE, before playing a new tournament in Singapore on the way home to New Zealand from February 9-12. From there Fox isn’t quite sure how his schedule will pan out but it’s likely to include a stint playing in the US and missing the New Zealand Open being played from March 2-5 at Millbrook. If he maintains a ranking inside the world’s top 50, the New Zealand number one will be eligible to play the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in Orlando which clashes directly with the NZ Open. “I have to leave it quite late because the ranking cut off is about two weeks before the Arnold Palmer for the top 50 and if I’m in it’s probably one I have to go and play as it’s such a huge career opportunity and one good week in one of those events could literally change my life,” Fox said. “The NZ Open is a really important event for me as well and if it doesn’t happen next year, I will certainly be back many times in the future. It’s just unfortunate and will be a late call and I hope everyone will understand it’s nothing against the New Zealand Open, it’s just a career opportunity that’s too hard to turn down.” Fox is also eyeing up the chance to play at golf’s unofficial fifth major, The Player’s Championship, at TPC Sawgrass the week after Bay Hill. He would also likely play the World Golf Championship match play in Texas in late March before a debut at the Masters in early April at Augusta.","content":"After nearly 250 days away from New Zealand, in which his world ranking climbed from 213 at the start of the year to a career high of 24, Ryan Fox is finally home and ready to entertain fans at a charity event in Auckland on Friday.

Just a few days ago, 991 players (714 Indians and 277 Overseas) had gotten themselves registered for the auction, which will take place on December 23, in the South Indian city of Kochi. With only a maximum of 87 of these players (including only 30 Overseas players) will likely make it through to any of these teams, the franchises are expected to submit the list of names they are interested in latest by December 9. Some big names including the likes of Ben Stokes, Kane Williamson, Nicholas Pooran, Cameron Green, Sam Curran et al, are expected to garner heavy bids at the auction table come December 23. On the other hand, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Pat Cummins and most recently Indian Test team regulars in Cheteshwar Pujara and Hanuma Vihari have opted out of the upcoming edition of the league. IPL 2023 start date and time As reported by Cricbuzz on Tuesday, the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 will start either on March 31 or April 1 2023, with the latter date most likely to be the one for the potential launch of the cash-rich league. Also, with Gujarat Titans as the defending champions, the first match of the upcoming season will take place in Ahmedabad. The BCCI is yet to come up with the final dates of the tournament next year, but the grand finale will likely take place either on May 28 or June 4. Also, as per the report, the final of second edition of the World Test Championship is expected to run from June 7 to 11, which might well be a cause of worry for the BCCI in case India play the grand finale. Moreover, the April 1 start for IPL 2023 is too close to India’s last international assignment. The last ODI between India and Australia is scheduled to take place on March 22, which would then leave the Indian players of that squad with mere 9-10 days to turn up for their respective franchises in the IPL. It remains to be seen how the richest Cricket Board adjusts to these challenges in the days to come.

It will be important for them to communicate clearly with the players and to stay calm amidst aggressive appealing, a BCCI official stated on Tuesday. This season marks the first instance that female umpires will be asked to officiate in the men’s cricket matches. With the Ranji Trophy, beginning December 13, coinciding with the India (women’s) home series against Australia, the three female officials will get to officiate in only a few matches in the men’s first-class competition. Chennai-based Narayanan and Mumbai-based Rathi are seasoned umpires and were included in International Cricket Council’s panel of development umpires back in 2018. Among the three female umpires, Gayathri has served as a reserve (fourth) umpire in Ranji Trophy in the past. ‘Can’t be too soft’ Delhi-based Gayathri is among the three registered umpires in the BCCI panel besides Janani and Vrinda. A BCCI official said dealing with the male players will be a big challenge for the female trio. Stakes are high in the Ranji Trophy and tempers can flare in the middle. “As umpires you can’t be too soft in the middle. Otherwise the players would try to intimidate them. You have be tough and implementation of the rules has to be perfect. The communication with the players is key. But all these three are doing well and should do well,” a BCCI official, who did not wish to be named, told PTI. The 32-year-old Rathi has risen from the maidans of Mumbai while 36-year-old Narayan left her cushy job as a software engineer to pursue umpiring. Venugopalan, 43, started umpiring in 2019 after clearing the BCCI exam. The BCCI still has a lot of catching up to do: female umpires are already officiating in men’s cricket in Australia and England. Out of 150 registered umpires with the BCCI, only three are women. “We can’t plan their games in Ranji Trophy but we will give them opportunities as per their availability. —PTI Female umpires to officiate in Ranji Trophy this season added by Press Trust of India on 12:53 am December 7, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-06 19:23:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Indian women’s team without coach 2 months before T20 World Cup, BCCI transfer Ramesh Powar to NCA","link":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/indian-womens-team-without-coach-2-months-before-t20-world-cup-bcci-transfer-ramesh-powar-to-nca/articleshow/96038297.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India were the runners-up of the last edition of the World Cup in 2020 that was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in front of a record 86,174 spectators — largest for an ICC T20 World Cup final, including both the men’s and the women’s event.","content":"Synopsis India were the runners-up of the last edition of the World Cup in 2020 that was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in front of a record 86,174 spectators — largest for an ICC T20 World Cup final, including both the men’s and the women’s event. IANS How are they supposed to win when they don’t have a coach just two months out of World Cup? In two months and five days from today (6 December 2022), Indian women’s cricket team will be at the Newlands cricket stadium in Cape Town, South Africa, facing arch-rivals (political, not in cricket) Pakistan in their opening match of the ICC T20 World Cup . The preparations must be at full tilt. The think tank of the team — captain, senior players, coaches — must be cooking up plans and strategies. The players must be working on their weaknesses and polishing their strengths. Or so you would assume. But like a ship needs a captain to navigate the sea, a team needs a coach to chart a path towards a destination. And Indian women’s cricket team doesn’t have one at the time of writing this. Indian cricket board ( BCCI ), in its infinite wisdom, on Tuesday announced that the head coach of the women’s team, Ramesh Powar , will no longer be with the team. “Mr. Ramesh Powar, former Head Coach of the senior women’s team will join Mr. VVS Laxman , Head Cricket, National Cricket Academy and will switch to Men’s cricket as part of the restructuring module of the BCCI,” the board said in an unsigned media advisory on Tuesday. India were the runners-up of the last edition of the World Cup in 2020 that was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in front of a record 86,174 spectators — largest for an ICC T20 World Cup final, including both the men’s and the women’s event. It was a proof of the huge popularity of the women’s cricket. Concrete, not abstract. Of course, the presence of the greatest women’s cricket team and hosts Australia was a major reason for so many people to turn up at the ’G. But would it have been possible if the Indian team wasn’t there? (Don’t worry, it’s a rhetorical question.) They don’t have the big trophies to show (as of now) but they are always among the contenders to reach the later stages of big tournaments. They have been, on a couple of occasion, within a touching distance of major achievements. There are some big stars in their line-up with a huge fan base that follow them everywhere they go and expect a high level of performance, especially in ICC events. How are they supposed to do that when they don’t have a coach just two months out of World Cup? When the BCCI invited application for the head coach’s job in April 2021, it was advertised as a “two-year term”. From the date of his appointment in May 2021, his term should have run till April 2023 and easily cover the T20 World Cup in South Africa. The BCCI communique didn’t make it clear whether Powar’s contract was terminated before shifting him to the NCA. Couldn’t the BCCI wait for another two months? It looks like a hasty move made without giving much consideration to its impact on the women’s team. While they immediately named a batting coach in Hrishikesh Kanitkar, who will also head the support staff for the upcoming five-match T20I series at home against Australia from December 9, there was no information on the replacement of the head coach. Kanitkar is an experienced player and has worked with several teams as coach. He is definitely capable of coaching the women’s team at the World Cup. But it’s a very short time for anyone to take up the responsibility and prepare the team for a major multi-nation tournament. Maintaining continuity is difficult, if not impossible, for someone who wasn’t part of the previous system. There are too many factors to factor in for a coach before he/she look to create a system and develop an understanding with players in an international team. They may still do well, you never know, but the whole situation doesn’t reflect well on the cricket board’s professionalism.

FIFA World Cup: Fixtures | Results | Points Table | Squads | Records Spain were also eliminated in a penalty shootout at the 2018 World Cup, by host Russia. “It doesn’t just depend on luck. It’s a moment of the highest pressure. If you’ve trained for that often, then the way you take a penalty will improve,” Luis Enrique said. “Obviously you cannot train for the pressure and the tension. But it’s manageable. You can cope with that pressure.” Morocco have been one of the biggest surprises of the tournament by winning a difficult group ahead of 2018 finalist Croatia and 2018 semifinalist Belgium. Morocco conceded only one goal in their three group matches and the team have big support in Qatar as the last of the four Arab qualifiers still playing — and now the last African team, too, after Senegal were eliminated by England on Sunday. Spain also met Morocco in the teams’ final group game in 2018, which ended 2-2.

Earlier, he had said that if India did not participate in the Asia Cup series in Pakistan next year, his team would not participate in the World Cup series in India. In this context, he spoke about India-Pakistan Test cricket. At the same time, he has changed his earlier opinion. Since the 2012-13 season, India-Pakistan have not played a direct series between the two teams. Since then both teams have been playing only in ICC-run series so far. “What can be done if the Pakistani government refuses to send the Pakistani team to India due to security concerns? It is an emotional affair. BCCI started this. We had to answer that. Test cricket needs India vs Pakistan match. The FIFA president said that the question of why the match between Iran and America in the FIFA World Cup series can be solved by football games. I am somewhat disappointed with ICC. 90 thousand spectators came to the stadium when the India-Pakistan teams played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The Pakistan Blind Cricket Council condemned the decision and further added that India might not be allowed to host the tournaments in the future. The PBCC said “it strongly condemns this discriminating act of India as sports should be above regional politics”. “Our counterpart Blind Cricket Association in India pleaded with their government for Pakistan’s clearance but nothing was heard,” the PBCC added. “This discriminating act will have serious consequences on global blind cricket as we at World Blind Cricket will take stern action against them and may not allow India to host future International events.” India refuses visas of Pakistan Blind Cricket Team to participate in T-20 World Cup Cricket of the Blind ( 5 to 17 December 2022 in India ).

The 74-run win is England's third Test victory in Pakistan, with Stokes becoming just the third visiting skipper after Ted Dexter in 1961 and Nasser Hussain in 2000, to win a Test match in Pakistan. It was all made possible after Stokes' bold declaration at tea on Day Four on Sunday, which gave Pakistan a stiff target of 343 for an improbable win. But an inspired bowling performance from fast bowlers James Anderson (4-36) and Player of the Match Ollie Robinson (4-50) forced a heroic victory to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. On Day Five, Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan had kept Pakistan in the hunt with a steady partnership after the hosts lost opener Imam-ul-Haq to James Anderson at the start of the day's play to end a 64-run stand. Rizwan took 24 balls to get off the mark but then took on the spinners with Shakeel playing the perfect partner from the other end. Pakistan forced England onto the backfoot as the partnership between Rizwan and Shakeel gained strength. On 156/3 at the stroke of lunch, Pakistan seemed in control and ready to push for a win. However, Anderson produced the breakthrough yet again, sending back Rizwan for 46 with a perfect outswinger, to end the 87-run partnership. Robinson, who had been brilliant with the ball right throughout the match, sent back Shakeel by tempting him with a fuller delivery that he drove straight to substitute Keaton Jennings. Azhar Ali (40) and Agha Salman (30) survived through till tea to stitch a stand of 61 for the sixth wicket and put some sort of resistance for Pakistan. But Robinson struck soon after, trapping Salman lbw with an inswinger and then had Azhar, who came out to bat after retiring hurt on Day Four due to taking a nasty blow on the finger, glancing straight to leg slip to firmly put England on the path to victory. Anderson then sent back Zahid Mahmood, with wicketkeeper Ollie Pope taking a stunning one-handed catch by diving full length to the leg-side, trapping Haris Rauf plumb lbw in the same over to make the result a foregone conclusion. Naseem and Mohammad Ali frustrated England, as an edge from the former's bat off Stokes flew between the keeper and slips. But Leach finally had Naseem trapped lbw shortly after the new ball was taken as England clinched a victory for the ages on the flattest of pitches. The loss has meant that Pakistan's hopes of making the ICC World Test Championship 2021-23 final have been dented. Wins for Australia and India in their respective series' against South Africa and Bangladesh respectively would see Pakistan, currently ranked fifth in the table, miss out on a spot in the finals. Pakistan's loss also puts India in control to reach the WTC final given that they can now secure their place even if they lose one of the Tests against Australia at home, provided they do a 2-0 sweep of Bangladesh. If Australia win the remaining Test against West Indies and at least two Tests against South Africa, they would still be well-placed to make the final. The Test match action between England and Pakistan would now shift to Multan for the second Test starting from December 9. Brief scores: England 657 and 264/7 dec beat Pakistan 579 and 268 (Saud Shakeel 76, Imam-ul-Haq 48; James Anderson 4-36, Ollie Robinson 4-50) by 74 runs.

Spain are the overwhelming favourites but after shoddy performances against Japan and Germany, they'd better be careful against Morocco. The Africans finished ahead of Croatia and Belgium in their group and have every reason to be proud of themselves. Spain are hoping it won’t come down to a penalty shootout against Morocco in the Round of 16 on Tuesday, at least the team is well prepared if it does get to that point. FIFA World Cup: Fixtures | Results | Points Table | Squads | Records Spain were also eliminated in a penalty shootout at the 2018 World Cup, by host Russia. “It doesn’t just depend on luck. It’s a moment of the highest pressure. If you’ve trained for that often, then the way you take a penalty will improve,” Luis Enrique said. “Obviously you cannot train for the pressure and the tension. But it’s manageable. You can cope with that pressure.” Morocco have been one of the biggest surprises of the tournament by winning a difficult group ahead of 2018 finalist Croatia and 2018 semifinalist Belgium. Morocco conceded only one goal in their three group matches and the team have big support in Qatar as the last of the four Arab qualifiers still playing — and now the last African team, too, after Senegal were eliminated by England on Sunday. Spain also met Morocco in the teams’ final group game in 2018, which ended 2-2.

Like his father, the fifteen-year-old is a batter but unlike the Indian veteran, he is not in the slam-bang mould.“Not at all. He is not that type of batter.

There is no denying the fact that the star-studded batting line-up needs to deliver if India are to remain alive in the series. The last time India played a bilateral series in Bangladesh was back in 2015 when under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the team lost the three-match series 1-2 and the only win came in the dead third rubber. History could repeat itself at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium here if spinners Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraj can once again keep the Indian batters under wraps between overs 11-40. While there are still 10 months left for the ODI World Cup, it is not yet clear what exactly will be Indian team’s approach. The talks around adopting a ‘fearless approach’ have been going on for some time but its implementation has only been sporadic. At times, adapting to conditions and reacting to situations has got more prominence. The track at Mirpur wasn’t exactly a batting beauty but it also didn’t warrant a score of 186 in the first ODI. The erstwhile selection committee’s decision to rest both Shubman Gill and Sanju Samson for this series has been equally baffling. The logic given by the former chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma was that due to a short turnaround from New Zealand, they picked a fresh bunch of players for the series. Gill wasn’t a part of T20 World Cup and also didn’t play the T20 series in New Zealand (he was part of the squad though) and hence leaving him out was baffling. One of the problems with the Indian top order players is that they are accelerating the run-rate but at the same time consuming way more dot deliveries than they should. In the first game against Bangladesh, dot balls worth more than 25 overs were consumed even as India batted for less than 42 overs. If the eight overs that they couldn’t bat is taken into account, the team missed out on scoring off almost 200 balls. In modern-day cricket, when England is changing the rules of engagement across formats in every sense, the Indian team is taking one step forward and four backwards. The idea of handing the gloves to KL Rahul wasn’t about increasing flexibility in the team but to ensure that both Rahul and Dhawan could be fitted in the same playing XI, going into the World Cup. Samson, one of the most flamboyant players, wasn’t even picked for this series and Ishan Kishan, who scored a 93 in his last ODI series, despite being a specialist keeper-batter was benched. Rajat Patidar and Rahul Tripathi in the brief period they have been picked in the Indian team have been travellers and it is still not clear how the team management plans to test these youngsters before pruning the list to may be 18-20. The tough calls haven’t yet been taken by coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma and it doesn’t look like it will be taken any time soon.

In particular, Harmison lauded the bold game plan of captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum that led England to victory in a match that saw the third most runs scored in Test match cricket history. Stokes and McCullum have made for a very successful duo since becoming Test cricket captain and head coach respectively After big first innings scores for both England and Pakistan, the game looked destined to end in a draw, but that is not the attitude that McCullum and Stokes have instilled in this England team, having now won seven out of eight Tests since the man from New Zealand took over. With that being said, England decided to declare towards the end of day four, which was a risky decision, but one that paid off as they went on to earn a victory that impressed Harmison in particular. “The way [Stokes] has gone about not only this week, but the captaincy in general, he wants to take the positive option and he’s always trying to win games,” Harmison told talkSPORT. “There will be bumps in the road, there’s no doubt England will lose a Test match, but at this minute in time his outlook on the game is fantastic. “And, if there is a bump in the road, the way they’ve put adversity behind them, the red ball and the white ball team, they’ll just bounce straight back. “While he’s got a mindset of positivity like this, it’s great signs for English cricket.

Due to the conditions, Harmison believes had it not been for England’s brave tactics, Test cricket could have come under huge criticism for what might have been an embarrassingly dull game. “If any other team had played Pakistan this week on Rawalpindi pitch, not only would it have been a draw, it would’ve been talked down as the most embarrassing game of cricket going,” Harmison said. “Because it would’ve been 500 against 500, played 120 for 2 and everyone would’ve been going with franchise cricket, T20 cricket and white ball cricket all around the world, what is the point in Test cricket? “But, we’re completely talking about it in a different way and that is largely down to Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, brilliant.” talkSPORT BET OFFER OF THE DAY Bet £10 Get £30 In Free Bets* – CLAIM HERE 18+ Opt in, bet £10+ at odds 2.00+, in 7 days.
