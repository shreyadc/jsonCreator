Averaging a healthy 36.86 in his 28-match T20I career so far, Suryakumar Yadav has arguably cemented his place in the Indian T20 side, within a couple of years since making his international debut. Having made his international and T20I debut against England in Ahmedabad last year, the 32-year-old unfortunately did not bat during his maiden appearance, as team India had chased the target down with 7 wickets in hand. However, come the next T20I at the same venue three days later, the renowned Mumbai Indians (MI) batter was sent up the order at the no.3 spot, and played true to his reputation and potential, while grabbing the opportunity with both his hands. ALSO READ: Suryakumar Yadav reveals his game plan for T20 World Cup 2022 He not only smashed a half-century (57 off 31 deliveries) on his batting debut in Indian colours, but was also adjudged the ‘Player of the Match’, as the Virat Kohli-led team India won the match by 8 runs. Suryakumar Yadav reminisces smashing Jofra Archer Making his international debut at the age of 31, after consistently performing in the domestic circuit and for his IPL franchise Mumbai Indians (MI), little did someone know that Suryakumar would showcase the audacity to hit one of the fastest bowlers in world Cricket – Jofra Archer, for a Six off the first ball that he would face while representing his country. Coming in to bat during the fourth Over, Yadav scooped the short delivery bowled by Archer at his chest-height and in line with the stumps, for a gigantic Six over the Fine Leg fence, to leave each and every one on and off-the-field slacked-jawed in disbelief. During an interaction with the ‘Times of India’ ahead of the home T20I series versus Australia, the 32-year-old revealed w hat all was running in his mind before deciding to take on someone like an Archer, and whether or not it was pre-meditated. Claiming the first-ball Six to be a result of his instincts, Yadav exclaimed that he had anticipated that the English pacer might go short with the new batter at the crease, and that he was prepared for the same. He further afforded to chuckle while stating that he had no idea how he would have played if the delivery had been a Yorker. “The Jofra one was completely instinctive. He knew I was making my batting debut. Bowlers like to hit that hard length against new batters. I was prepared for that length. But I don’t know what would have happened had it been a Yorker (laughs). I was anticipating that the first ball would be on the body and it would be nice and short. I didn’t hit it hard. I just timed it and his pace took the ball out of the ground,” explained Suryakumar.

Effective from this season, the impact player will allow the participating teams to replace one member of its playing XI during a T20 fixture. According to a note issued to the state teams, which Sportstar has seen, the BCCI said, \"The concept is to allow one substitute player per team to take a more active part in a match. This would add a new tactical/strategic dimension to the game. A number of team sports allow teams to make tactical substitutes i.e. football, rugby, basketball, baseball. The substitute is allowed to perform or participate like any other regular player...\" Taking a leaf out of the Big Bash League, BCCI took the decision to make the format interesting ‘not only for the viewers, but also for the participating teams from strategic viewpoint’. For now, this will be experimented only for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy this season and it needs to be seen how teams react to the new rule. There is a possibility that going forward this rule could be introduced in the Indian Premier League as well. As per the note, the State teams will have to decide whether or not to have an impact player. But if they wish to field one, the 'Impact Player' can be introduced in the match any time before the completion of 14th over of either innings in a match. After the introduction, the new player can bat and may bowl a full allotment of four overs. The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy begins on October 11.

Johnson has opined that the duo is into the second half of their careers and may not be great long-term options.Australia's limited-overs captain Aaron Finch recently announced retirement from ODIs. Test skipper Pat Cummins, who is the vice-captain of Australia's white-ball sides, is believed to have informed the Australian Cricket Board that he does not want to increase his workload by taking up the ODI captaincy as well. Last year, just ahead of The Ashes, Australia appointed Cummins as their new Test captain after Tim Paine got involved in a controversy. With Australia yet to announce their new ODI skipper, Johnson has suggested the names of Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, and Cameron Green as options for the role. \"Pat Cummins (Test skipper) may not able to do all formats. It might be too much workload for him, but then I look and check who is available. The selectors have someone in mind may be Glenn Maxwell. Cameron Green would also be a good choice if you are looking the future but there is already a heavy workload for him as an all-rounder. Travis Head is there but he needs to be more consistent,\" Johnson was quoted as saying in an interview with PTI.After the Sandpaper Gate in South Africa in 2018, Australia had banned Smith from captaincy for a year, while the board had slapped Warner with a lifetime suspension from any leadership role. However, it was earlier reported that the Australia Cricket Board was planning to overturn Warner's lifetime ban from any leadership role. Johnson believes handing the captaincy to Warner or Smith is not a great long-term option.\"Both Warner and Smith should not be captains. No issue with them being advisors of the team which they already are. I don't see why this needs to be brought up all over again, it brings back the old stuff (the scandal). They are also towards the end of their careers so it should be someone who has got more time in the game,\" the former pacer added. Finch will captain Australia in the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to begin next month Down Under. The defending champions are set to kickstart their campaign on Oct. 22 against New Zealand. These two sides played the final last year in Dubai, with the Aussies emerging as winners and claiming their maiden T20 World Cup title. In the lead-up to the mega event, Australia are set to travel to India for a three-match T20I series, starting from Sept. 20. The matches will be played in Mohali, Nagpur, and Hyderabad.","pubDate":"2022-09-16 19:17:02","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/09/16/500x300_1312647-ichel.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Boucher named head coach of Mumbai Indians","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/09/17/boucher-named-head-coach-of-mumbai-indians/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai: Former South Africa wicketkeeper batter Mark Boucher has been appointed Mumbai Indians’ head coach for the upcoming IPL season, the franchise announced on Friday.

The 45-year-old replaces former Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene, who has been elevated to the role of global head of performance by the franchise. Boucher, who is currently the head coach of the South Africa men’s national team, had earlier this week announced he will be stepping down from the role after the upcoming T20 World Cup. “It is an honor and privilege to be appointed as Head Coach of MI. Their history and achievements as a franchise clearly put them up there as one of the most successful sporting franchises in all of world sport,” Boucher said in a media release. “I look forward to the challenge and respect the need for results. It’s a strong unit with great leadership and players. I look forward to adding value to this dynamic unit,” he added. Boucher has had a long and illustrious career and holds the record for the most Test dismissals by a wicketkeeper. Post-retirement he took over as coach for Titans, a top-level cricket franchise in South Africa, and led them to five domestic titles. In 2019, he was appointed as the head coach of South Africa where he crafted 11 Test wins, 12 in ODIs and 23 T20I victories. “It’s a pleasure to welcome Mark Boucher to Mumbai Indians.

Arshdeep faced an unbelievable backlash on social media after he dropped Asif Ali’s catch off Bishnoi’s bowling in the Super 4s game that India lost. Bishnoi, however, had impressive figures of 1/28 in 4 overs and was easily the best bowler in his only chance at the continental event. “Paaji mere sabse acche dost hai (Paaji is a dear friend). We all know that dropped catches are part and parcel of the game. It can happen with the best. It could well have been the other way round where he was bowling and I happened to drop the catch,” Bishnoi, who has played 10 T20Is for India in 2022, told PTI during an interaction. “Arshdeep is one of the bravest boys that I know. After that catch, you saw how he came and bowled at the death. It never looked as if he was perturbed. That’s his mental strength,” said the Rajasthan man, who is in the stand-by for the ICC T20 World cup. Working on developing a potent leg break With 16 wickets and an economy rate of 7.08, Bishnoi has been impressive in the chances that he has got for India in the shortest version. But having missed the T20 World Cup bus to a much senior and accomplished Yuzvendra Chahal, the common question is that if he is becoming a one-dimensional option with googly as his only potent weapon. “No one from the team management has pressed it upon me that I have to develop a leg-break,” the Jodhpur lad said. In fact, former leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule, who also happens to be one of the bowling coaches who travels with the team, told him not to worry. “I had spoken to Sairaj sir and he said that it’s fine as long as I am working on that variation. He told me ‘Yes, you are trying to develop a potent leg-break and someday, you will certainly execute it to perfection. I am working on it and hope it happens sooner than later,” Bishnoi said. In fact, wrist spin is one of the toughest arts in cricket and Bishnoi knows that he can’t be afraid of batters giving him the charge. “You shouldn’t be scared of getting hit or when the batter is attacking. As per the situation, I bowl a lot of flippers and top spinners. You need to analyse the match situation and bowl accordingly.” Yuzi bhai tells me to “enjoy” and “be fearless” It is not always easy if your competition is as skilful a bowler as Chahal but Bishnoi is enjoying every moment of working with the senior wrist spinner. “Yuzi bhai hasn’t told me anything specific (on leg break bowling). He always tells me that every moment that you are on the ground, you should enjoy it and as a pair, we should try and bowl well in tandem which is beneficial for the team.” Bishnoi feels comfortable in both kinds of roles, attacking as well as a restrictive one. “One has to perform a specific role that is being assigned. At times, it could be a wicket-taking role and at times, a restrictive one. For me, the most important aspect is that I have not wasted opportunities, whatever chances I have got, I have tried my best to utilise it.” ‘Dressing room accepted me with open arms’ It has now been seven months that Bishnoi has sporadically played for India but being in that dressing room environment with some of the best players in the world has helped him in his learning curve. “It was the best moment of my life when I got India call-up and my coaches were ecstatic. It has been a great journey so far with the team as we won almost all the bilateral contests and only the Asia Cup didn’t go our way.” Bishnoi will be brand face of Super4, latest entrant in the gaming sector that allows cricket fans and enthusiasts across India to create teams prior to the start of a match.

After O’Brien’s dismissal, the pace of the innings slowed down as Pankaj Singh found his rhythm. While Denesh Ramdin was scoring at a good rate there was no good contribution from the other batters. The innings took a stumbling block and despite a positive start ended at 170/8 as wickets were falling at regular intervals. In the final over of the Giants' innings, Pankaj bowled a maiden over as he scalped three wickets and ended with a tally of 26/5 in his five overs. The Maharajas made a poor start to their innings as they lost Virender Sehwag early in the innings. Matters were made even worse when they lost Parthiv Patel for 34/2. However, a match-winning partnership between Tanmay Srivastava and Yusuf Pathan saw the Maharajas home as they won the put together a stand of 103 runs. While Srivastava scored 54 runs, Yusuf remained unbeaten for 50 as he and his brother Irfan saw the Indian Maharajas home to secure a famous six-wicket win.","pubDate":"2022-09-16 18:08:33","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Legends League Cricket 2022: Yusuf, Pankaj star as India Maharajas thrash World Giants by 6 wickets","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-legends-league-cricket-yusuf-pankaj-star-as-india-maharajas-thrash-world-gianst-by-6-wickets-2985752","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Maharajas used as many as eight bowlers and it was Pankaj Singh, who was their standout bowler with figures of 4-1-26-5.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-09-16 18:05:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"dnaindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India Maharajas vs World Giants Highlights, Legends League Cricket 2022: Tanmay, Yusuf star in IND's big win","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-maharajas-vs-world-giants-highlights-legends-league-cricket-2022-tanmay-yusuf-star-in-inds-big-win-11269411.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India Maharajas vs World Giants Highlights, Legends League Cricket 2022: Tanmay, Yusuf star in IND's big win","content":"23:15 (IST)That's all we have for you from this contest.

After being put in to bat first, the Giants got off to a flying start. Kevin O’Brien and Hamilton Masakadza put on 50 runs for the opening wicket off 5.3 overs. O’Brien, who recently bid adieu to international cricket, was the aggressor as he scored a 29-ball half-century. Former Zimbabwe captain Hamilton Masakadza also hit four fours and lent O’Brien support. Pankaj Singh gave the Maharajas their first breakthrough, getting rid of Masakadza. Joginder Sharma sent back the dangerous O’Brien, after which Harbhajan Singh castled Jacques Kallis. Thereafter, Denesh Ramdin, who also announced his retirement this year, and Thisara Perera steadied the ship for the Giants. The duo put in 42 runs for the fourth wicket and laid the platform for the Giants. After Perera got out for 23, Ramdin went on to stay unbeaten on 42 off 29 with five fours and one six. On the back of Ramdin’s knock, the Giants got themselves up to 170 for eight. The Maharajas used as many as eight bowlers and it was Pankaj Singh, who was their standout bowler with figures of 4-1-26-5. The Maharajas didn’t get off to the best of starts in their run-chase. Fidel Edwards got rid of Virender Sehwag to draw first blood. Mohammad Kaif and Parthiv Patel scored 11 and 18 respectively, before Tim Bresnan accounted for their wickets.

Yusuf went on to score a 35-ball 50 and his younger brother, Irfan, hit three sixes in a nine-ball 20, helping the Maharajas win with eight balls to spare.

The year 2022 has seen a massive turnaround in Hardik's career. He started off by captaining Gujarat Titans (GT) to the Indian Premier League (IPL) title in their maiden campaign. He was the Man of the Match in the IPL final between GT and Rajasthan Royals (RR) for his all-round effort. He picked up three wickets in the first innings and followed that with a 30-ball 34 in his side's successful chase. Hardik then carried his fine form into international series against South Africa, Ireland, England, and the West Indies. He also played a key role in India's five-wicket win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup group stage, where he scalped three wickets and scored 33 to take the Men in Blue over the line. In a recent interview, Bresnen said while Hardik adds balance to the Indian team and is a fine athlete, he still needs to mature to become a better player. \"Definitely, a pace bowling all-rounder is quite crucial, it balances your team, it gives you two cricketers in one. It's a tough position to play because you are always involved in the game, so it's quite demanding physically. Fast bowling all-rounders are worth the weight in gold. Hardik is really good on the field as well. He's a very good athlete. He's got to mature a bit more, then he is going to be a top, top player,\" said Bresnan in an interview with PTI. Talking about the T20 World Cup, England, Australia, and New Zealand are favourites to win the trophy, according to Bresnen, who also mentioned that India cannot be underestimated as well. \"You can't discount India ever... But I think England, Australia and New Zealand are probably the three favourites. But India and Pakistan have the same chance and Sri Lanka have done really well in the Asia Cup, so you never know, whoever brings on the day,\" added Bresnan in the same interview. T20 World Cup will be played in Australia this year, starting on Oct. 16 and the final will take place on Nov. 13. India are scheduled to kickstart their T20 World Cup campaign on Oct. 23 against arch-rivals Pakistan at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In the lead-up to the marquee tournament, India are set to host Australia and South Africa in the white-ball series. The three-match T20I series between India and Australia will begin on Sept. 20 and the matches will be played in Mohali, Nagpur, and Hyderabad. The last time these two sides locked horns in a T20I series was back in 2020 Down Under where the tourists ended on the winning side (2-1). Team India will look to make full use of the upcoming series to establish their final combination for the T20 World Cup. India recently had a poor show in the Asia Cup, where they failed to make it to the semi-final. It was the same case last year in the T20 World Cup.","pubDate":"2022-09-16 16:53:50","image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/09/16/500x300_1312646-hardik-pandya.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"World Wrestling Championships 2022: Ravi Kumar Dahiya disappoints; Naveen Malik loses bronze medal match","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/world-wrestling-championships-2022-ravi-kumar-dahiya-out-of-gold-medal-run-with-2nd-round-defeat-to-gulomjon-abdullaev-11268381.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"World Wrestling Championships 2022: Ravi Kumar Dahiya disappoints; Naveen Malik loses bronze medal match","content":"India’s star wrestler Ravi Kumar Dahiya made an early exit from the World Wrestling Championships 2022 in Belgrade on Friday as the 24-year-old Olympic silver medallist suffered a lopsided loss of 10-0 against Uzbekistan’s Gulomjon Abdullaev in the 57kg category.

However, the teams have to announce the name of these “super sub” players before the start of the game. One of main reasons behind Usman Khawaja being dropped in the 2019 Ashes was the irresistible case Marnus Labuschagne made when being a 'super sub' then Steven Smith returned from concussion.

You have to make room for him #AUSvENG #Ashes — Andrew McGlashan (@andymcg_cricket) January 8, 2022 Legends League Cricket Match Commissioner Ravi Shastri feels that the introduction of this rule could be a game changer. With the game evolving every year, the former India coach says that the rule might be used in international cricket in the future. “I see this game evolving all the time. Who knows tomorrow it might be something that’s used even at the international level. Don’t be surprised because this is one format that can evolve, especially in tournaments like these where you are not bound by certain rules. You can create your own rules in tournaments like these or even in the IPL, or Big Bash. If you want to experiment or try something new, this is the place to do it,” the former India allrounder said in Kolkata on Friday. The league phase of the tournament will start from September 17 and will feature four teams in Gujarat Giants, India Capitals, Manipal Tigers and Bhilwara Kings. Around 90 cricketing greats will take part in 16 matches across 6 venues. Speaking about LLC and his role in the tournament, Shastri said, “It’s a fabulous opportunity. It’s a new string to the bow. Sometimes, it can just be the motivator that is needed to keep yourself fit and engage in something different. I am always ready and willing to work for the benefit of the sport and to promote the sport in different parts of the globe.” He added: “Basically, my job in this league is to ensure that the cricketing part of it is run properly. There is a sense of pride in what you do. The work ethic has to be solid. There is an integrity quotient attached to it. Hence, you have the Anti-Corruption Units. These are not exhibition games. It’s the proper stuff under proper guidelines and every aspect is being looked at like the way you would play an international game. When that happens, players start taking it seriously. They know they are not out here for a holiday. They realise that there are people watching them across the globe, it’s important for them to enjoy the league and express themselves.” With Disney Star being the official broadcasters, Season 2 will be telecasted live on Star Sports Network as well as streamed on Disney+Hotstar in four languages—English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.","pubDate":"2022-09-16 16:27:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"I don't like headlines: Mitchell Marsh when asked about Australian captaincy","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/mitchell-marsh-asked-about-australian-captaincy-says-i-don-t-like-headlines-2022-09-16-808943","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The race for the top spot in Australian cricket is heating up, but there's one player who doesn't want to get involved in all these headline-grabbing discussions.","content":"The race for the top spot in Australian cricket is heating up, but there's one player who doesn't want to get involved in all these headline-grabbing discussions.

After bidding adieu to cricket, the former India captain has been seen several times in action on a golf course.Following his last appearance for India in the 2019 ICC World Cup, Dhoni visited the USA to play his first-ever golf tournament as an honourary member of the Metuchen Golf and Country Club (MGCC). There, he was introduced to the elite golf club by his friend, Rajiv Sharma back in 2016.Interestingly, the Indian cricketing great was quite remarkable in his new challenge, coming out victorious in four of the five games in the tournament.Dhoni’s connection with golf has again come to light. Recently, a bakery shop in the USA named Atul Bakery paid tribute to the Indian legend with an exclusive cake designed like a golf course, celebrating his membership with MGCC. The words ‘Thanks MS Dhoni MGCC’ can be seen glittering on the decorated cake. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Atul Bakery USA (@atulbakeryusa) The shop also shared some glimpses of Dhoni’s visit to the bakery on their Instagram handle. The caption of the post reads, “Atul Bakery is proud to announce MS Dhoni starting a new career in golf. Not exactly a new Career, but we are all on our toes to see him on the golf course and celebrate his achievements in golf too. Hope you loved the cake, Mahi.”The pictures of Dhoni cutting the delicious cake in golf attire have undoubtedly delighted Mahi fans.Besides golf, Dhoni also loves the game of tennis and is often seen attending major events whether it’s the Wimbledon or the US Open.Earlier, the former India skipper was captured in the stands during the recently-concluded US Open. He had been witnessing the breathtaking quarter-final battle between Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz and Italy’s Jannik Sinner which lasted for 5 hours and 15 minutes.Indian cricketing royalty at the #USOpen 🇮🇳🏏🎾Two former Indian World Cup winning captains, @msdhoni and @therealkapildev graced the stands at Arthur Ashe yesterday as two young future Champions battled it out for 5 hours and 15 minutes 🤩#GoBigOrGoHome #SonySportsNetwork pic.twitter.com/e7CCgHJOMZ— Sony Sports Network (@SonySportsNetwk) September 9, 2022 Dhoni was accompanied by India’s other world cup-winning captain, Kapil Dev.

Coming into the third match after a comprehensive victory at Derby, against a home side that was missing the services of Heather Knight, Nat Sciver, and Katherine Brunt, almost everything looked in India’s favour. But as the late-night game spilled over into Friday, hope turned into despair for Harmanpreet Kaur and Co. and their fans.Asked to bat first, India lost half of their batters before the halfway mark of the innings with just 35 runs on the board, and that never allowed the visitors to make a comeback in the winner-takes-all contest. The batting collapse, however, is something that we will come to later. The biggest worrying factor is the team’s ineffectiveness in yet another high-stakes game.Their eight-wicket win in the second T20I against England, who were dumped out of the Commonwealth Games (CWG) by the same side just last month, was another example of how good the Indian side can be on a given day. But it’s the consistency and the ability to do it in the biggest of the games that need to be addressed.Skipper Harmanpreet had spoken about the need for a regular sports psychologist with the team to work on “mental skills” and it’s a demand BCCI should surely and quickly look into.Batting unit disappointsComing to the specifics, Jemimah Rodrigues’ hand injury forced India to make changes to their batting order. Additionally, an extra batter was also included to swell the run-scoring capability. Harmanpreet expressed the need for an extra batter after India lost the gold medal match to Australia in the 2022 CWG.However, the only match that India won didn’t require the visitors to call upon its new longer batting line-up as Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet finished the job early. And in the two games that India lost, the extra batter didn’t help much as the batters collapsed in unison.This is not to say that India don’t need the extra batter. An extra pure batter is extremely essential but her standing up to the occasion, and all taking responsibility are actually what will lead to desired results.Comeback batter Dayalan Hemalatha had a forgetful series with 19 runs across three matches and rookie Kiran Navgire scored seven in her only innings, but Shafali Verma’s failure in the series was a bigger disappointment. With only 39 runs in three matches, Shafali failed to give India the required starts in both losses. In 12 matches this year, she has an average of under 20. The lack of runs also put more pressure on Mandhana and Harmanpreet, who also didn’t have the best of the series.Spinner Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn together took 11 wickets in three matches and the way Indian batters countered the tweakers exposed a new chink in their armour. India have always enjoyed triggering opposition collapses, using their spin-heavy attacks, but this time they got a taste of their own medicine. To be completely fair, the conditions did play their part as well.Richa and Radha impressThere were some though who took the opportunity to make a case for a longer rope with the team. Richa Ghosh, who returned after being dropped for the CWG, scored a crucial 33 off 22, batting at number eight to provide India some semblance of hope in the final match. She had also scored 16 in the first T20I and showed with the two outings that she can be a power-hitter down the order.Radha Yadav is arguably the best fielder in the side and it showed throughout the series. Her athleticism and safe catching add an extra dimension to the side which generally bores the reputation of being poor fielders. Her stingy match figures of 1/14 also helped India take the third T20I into the penultimate over.Though not at a blistering rate, Deepti Sharma’s knocks of 29 and 24 helped stabilise India’s innings momentarily in both the losses and her consistency from the middle-order is a good sign.pic.twitter.com/U7VsZfsEo1— _Pindu.47🦅🇮🇳 (@47Pindu) September 14, 2022As always, there’s plenty to ponder for India after the series loss. There are positives and negatives. But it’s clear that India need to work on their batting with the 2022 Women’s 20 Asia Cup and 2023 T20 World up fast approaching.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

On Thursday, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) included Shaheen Shah in the 15-member squad for the forthcoming T20 World Cup in Australia, starting from October 16-November 13. While announcing the team, chief selector Muhammad Wasim said, “Reports we have received about Shaheen are encouraging. He is likely to resume bowling early next month.” \"Shaheen Shah Afridi is making excellent progress in his rehabilitation in London and is on track to make a full recovery in time for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Australia 2022,\" stated PCB in a press release. Shortly after the statement was released, Shahid Afridi, the former Pakistan captain - whose daughter Shaheen is engaged to - lambasted the PCB. \"Shaheen Afridi has gone on his own to England. He has even paid for his own ticket. He is staying in England on his own money. I arranged a doctor for him, and then he contacted the doctor when he landed there. The PCB hasn't done anything, from the coordination to his accommodation, he is doing everything on his own. Zakir Khan - PCB's director of international cricket - spoke to him just once or twice,\" Afridi said in an interview with Samaa TV. Pakistan fast bowling great Wasim Akram echoed Shahid's sentiments. “This is shocking. He (Shaheen) is one of our top fast bowlers. If it is true that PCB is not taking care of him, this is really sad. I don't understand why PCB is so reckless about his rehabilitation. He should have straightaway been sent to the best knee surgeon in the world. But instead, he has been doing it all alone at his own expense. I am still shocked,” he said. Shaheen Shah last played for Pakistan in July 2022 against Sri Lanka in the first Test at Galle. He also missed the Asia Cup, where Pakistan lost in the final to Sri Lanka last week.
