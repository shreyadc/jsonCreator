Ashes series has been heated There have been repeated fan incidents Aussie players have had enough By Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 01:15 BST, 31 July 2023 e-mail View comments Video has emerged of more fan abuse in a heated Ashes series, with Aussie players Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne confronting a heckler during the fifth Test at The Oval. Footage shows the Aussie players returning to the dressing sheds on day three of the final Ashes Test, which hangs in the balance heading into the final day of play. It shows an agitated fan relentlessly abusing every member of the Aussie side until Khawaja and Labuschagne stop to call him out. The exchange went like this: Unnamed man: 'Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!' Labuschagne: 'What did you say, mate?' Usman: 'Calm down, calm down.' Labuschagne: 'Hey, hey, oi! *whistles*' Unnamed man: 'I apologise' Labuschagne: 'You were just about to go at everybody else.' It had been a difficult day in the field for the Australians and Labuschagne was in no mood for more fan heckling The unnamed heckler chanted 'boring' at the Aussie cricket team, leading Labuschagne to return serve before being ushered away by teammate Khawaja Khawaja then ushered his teammate up the stairs and the heckler stopped his tirade against the rest of the players. It is the latest incident of poor fan behaviour in the Ashes series, which also saw several Lord's members suspended for abusing Aussie cricketers. During the second Ashes test, Australian cricketer Khawaja confronted and pointed out MCC members he wanted ejected from Lord's after their hostile behavior towards the Australian team. He was seen remonstrating with England fans in the Long Room and asked security to remove specific individuals who had reportedly booed and called the Aussies cheats. While that incident involved English supporters and Lord's members, there has been some suggestion the latest heckler may have been Australian. 'Sounds Aussie to me,' Barmy Army trumpet player Simon Finch posted. 'Bit of debate whether old mate is Pom or Aussie. Regardless, weird behaviour considering Aus are 2-1 up.' McCormick posted. 'Apologies if he is Aussie, point stands - They're not there to play t20 cricket for the crowds pleasure. 'Boring' is barely an insult but don't melt to water when called out.' Some cricket fans slammed the unknown heckler for failing to understand Test cricket. 'Another borish day tripper with no interest in cricket. Imagine going to watch some of the best players in the world at an elite sporting event and claiming you're bored. It's been another brilliant test. What do people want?' asked one fan. Khawaja was involved in another incident of poor fan behaviour when Lord's members ruthlessly abused the Aussie cricket players including chanting 'cheat' at them It has been a heated Ashes series on and off the pitch, with fans of both nations crossing the line on occasion The latest incident was triggered by slow over rates which have seen the English side - including retiring pace bowler Stuart Broad - fined on two occasions Others thought fans had every right to feel aggrieved because of constantly slow over rates during the Ashes series. 'He was right - going at 3 an over and a slow over-rate to grind the game to a halt is boring and a rip off,' another fan posted. 'Fans should be seeing 90 overs a day and they are getting short changed by 10+ overs a day when Australia are in the field. It's not as if it's an accident either.' Both Australia and England were docked 40 per cent of their match fee and penalised two World Test Championship points each for slow over rates in the first Test at Edgbaston. England players were then docked their entire match fee at Lord's for slow over rates.

Start your free trial now > Smith & Marsh hilariously troll Anderson | 00:33 ‘IT’S A MISTAKE’: MYSTERY AS ENGLAND QUICK DISAPPEARS Mark Wood has been England’s most destructive weapon with the ball this winter, but the paceman was nowhere to be seen at The Oval on Sunday morning. Australian openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja chipped away at the deficit before lunch on day four, but England captain Ben Stokes was seemingly reluctant to throw the Dukes ball to his fastest bowler. Injured off-spinner Moeen Ali and part-time Joe Root were each given a spell before the lunch break, which is understandable considering there were two left-handers at the crease — but the absence of Wood certainly raised eyebrows. A spectator at The Oval walked over to the press box early in the afternoon session and asked if the right-armer was injured. Speaking on Channel 9, former Australian batter Callum Ferguson suggested England was waiting for the Dukes ball to start reversing before introducing Wood to the attack. “You can see that England are employing an interesting strategy,” Ferguson said. “They’re holding back their fastest bowler, Mark Wood, in the hope they can get the ball reversing and target the stumps and try and blow a few away quickly of the Australian top order.” Former Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy continued: “I think it’s a mistake that Wood hasn’t bowled four overs with a brand-new ball.” Wood was seen talking with the team physio earlier on Sunday, raising suspicion the 33-year-old was nursing a minor niggle. However, he was on the field for the entire morning session, so an injury seemed unlikely. READ MORE Ashes vision of Alex Carey brutally rejecting Todd Murphy goes viral ‘What did you say?’: Aussie stars confront Ashes spectactor Speaking on Sky Sports, former England captain Nasser Hussain pointed out that the pitch and overhead conditions didn’t favour Wood’s bowling. “The pace has been sucked out of this pitch — there is no pace in it at all,” Hussain said. “The problem with holding Wood back is this weather. Reverse swing and rain aren’t really friends. When the ground gets wet, the ball gets wet and reverse swing disappears. “If it does reverse, England will go their Pakistan tactics with Wood and Stokes, who bowled before play today.” Wood was finally introduced in the 33rd over, immediately bringing the crowd back to life. His first delivery to Khawaja was edged through to the slips cordon, with the left-hander copping a blow to the helmet a couple of overs later. Wood found Khawaja’s outside edge twice in his third over before running off the field, fuelling speculation about a mystery injury. Mark Wood of England.

The veteran opener has expressed his desire to finish his red-ball career with a farewell Test at the SCG next summer — if selected. Despite a stellar performance in the Lord’s Test, Warner’s Ashes campaign has been underwhelming, albeit significantly improving from his previous England tour in 2019. He has developed a frustrating habit of making starts without converting them into fifties, including both innings of the recent Old Trafford Test. Nobody has passed 20 more often than Warner during this series, yet he hasn’t cracked the top ten leading run-scorers. However, Warner saved his best batting performance of the series for last, combining with Usman Khawaja for an unbeaten 135-run opening partnership at The Oval to set up a thrilling fifth day in London. Warner makes the most of wild delivery | 00:29 The New South Welshman’s footwork was dynamic on Sunday, shimmying down the pitch at England’s bowlers and looking to attack loose deliveries. Despite repeatedly picking the fielders, he still managed to reach his half-century in 90 deliveries. “We have seen plenty of energy,” Australian batting coach Micahel Di Venuto said at stumps. “So far in this innings he has looked really good, made some good decisions, and played really nicely.” Warner was unbeaten on 58 when rain halted his momentum — he was eyeing his highest Test score in the United Kingdom (85), which coincidentally occurred at the same venue in 2015. The 36-year-old, who will continue his final away Test innings on Monday, has not scored a Test hundred outside of Australia since September 2017. Australia opener David Warner. Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images If he can reach triple figures on Monday, it would be difficult for national selectors to drop him ahead of December’s series opener against Pakistan. If Australia wins this Test match, he’ll return home a national hero. “Warner knows that if he gets a hundred here, he will get his wish and bow out in Sydney next year,” former England captain Nasser Hussain said on Sky Sports. “Both he and Khawaja have played excellently. Khawaja has looked busy with his batting but also with his running between the wickets, which is what Warner likes.” KHAWAJA THE ANTI-BAZBALLER LEADS RUNS TALLY In what will be forever known as the Bazball Ashes, traditional Test cricket may prove to have the definitive say. Usman Khawaja has been the antithesis of England’s approach for most of the series — he’s been a thorn in the host’s side all winter, facing well over 1200 balls, which is 580 more than the next most (Marnus Labuschagne). “One of the themes of this summer has been seeing how well Khawaja plays the defensive shot,” commentator Daniel Norcross said on BBC Test Match Special . The Queenslander will end the series as the leading run-scorer from both sides, currently sitting on 493. In contrast to the clash of styles, Ben Stokes is the only England batter to have faced more than 600 balls in the series, while the second-leading run-scorer in the series, opener Zak Crawley, had faced 541 just deliveries. “Is there anyone less Bazball than Usman Khawaja?” Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath asked on BCC TMS . Usman Khawaja of Australia. Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: FOX SPORTS When Khawaja reached his half-century at The Oval, his third for the series to go with his century at Edgbaston, he became the 21st Australian cricketer to pass 5000 Test runs. Since his recall in January 2022, he’s made 2114 runs at 62.17 with seven centuries, the most of any Australian batter since. Khawaja has built his way with a calm, no-fuss approach to Test cricket, going along at his own pace. He came under fire in the first innings for failing to move the game forward, heaping extra pressure on his teammates. Noting the change of approach in the second innings, former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy was impressed with Khawaja’s added intent at the crease on Sunday. “He’s playing the way Usman Khawaja does,” Healy said on Channel 9. “He’s just doing it with a bit more hunt in his attitude. “When there is a half volley, he’s getting into the shot, looking to hurt it and not just field it into a gap. “When he’s at his best, he does that with a bit of finesse. He plays with nice soft hands in that moment, and he is able to switch to his guns and hit the ball hard when it’s there to hit.” ENGLAND’S FORTUNES CHANGE AFTER BALL CHANGE The Dukes ball wasn’t swinging for England’s seamers on Sunday morning — James Anderson, arguably the greatest swing bowler in history, couldn’t get it move, and neither could Chris Woakes. It allowed Australian openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner to survive the new-ball burst, with England turning to spin after just nine overs. After Khawaja copped a nasty blow to the helmet early in the 37th over, umpires decided to change the ball, which had apparently lost its shape after Mark Wood’s bumper. However, much to England’s delight, Wood’s first delivery with the fresh Dukes hooped into the left-handed Khawaja, which raised some eyebrows in the Sky Sports commentary box.

Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “It certainly looks a lot newer than the one they changed from,” Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting remarked. “Look at how much writing is on the side of that ball.” Former Test opener Mark Taylor continued: “It really pinged off the bat. It even sounds harder.” Wood’s next delivery found Khawaja’s outside edge, with the ball racing towards third man for a boundary. Later in the same over, a leading edge narrowly evaded the point fielder. Only six further deliveries were bowled before the rain arrived in London, but England will feel confident their new Dukes pill can cause some damage on Monday morning.","pubDate":"2023-07-30 22:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SPORTS AGENDA: Everton's new stadium is far from completion after TWO YEARS of building work","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-12354279/SPORTS-AGENDA-Evertons-new-stadium-far-completion-TWO-YEARS-building-work.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MIKE KEEGAN: There was some head scratching at Championship clubs last week when they received their teamsheet books ahead of the new season.","content":"SPORTS AGENDA: Everton's new stadium is far from completion after TWO YEARS of building work Pictures of Everton's new ground show it is far from done after two years of work They say the 53,000 seater stadium is due to open in the final months of 2024 England's Ashes stars were woken by a fire alarm before the final Ashes Test By Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail Updated: 23:00 BST, 30 July 2023 e-mail View comments There was some head scratching at Championship clubs last week when they received their teamsheet books ahead of the new season. As Mail Sport revealed, second-tier sides voted to increase the number of substitutes named in matchday squads from seven to nine, while their counterparts in Leagues One and Two remain with seven on the bench. However, when the paperwork turned up officials were surprised to find only seven spaces to fill in for subs, instead of nine. The EFL told them it was due to a printing error, leading one official to joke: ‘I wonder if they are going to fine themselves?’ Meanwhile, the EFL have outlined to clubs their stance on taking the knee. Any player who wishes to make the anti-racism gesture will be given the opportunity to do so by the referee. Everton's slow stadium build Pictures taken of Everton’s new stadium two years to the day work started show it remains some way from completion. The shots, taken by Daily Mail photographer Bruce Adams last Wednesday, illustrate what still appears to be a fairly skeletal structure. Everton say the 53,000-capacity venue, on the banks of the Mersey, should be open ‘in the final months of 2024’ but there are concerns they may have to remain at Goodison Park for another two seasons. By comparison, Tottenham’s new home opened three years after the project was signed off in 2016.

The prospect is intriguing given the status of the Hundred, which has split opinion. The competition faces challenges from abroad, not least from the US’s Major League Cricket. It is understood that officials are keen on securing external funding as they seek to make it a success. IPL franchise Punjab Kings have held talks with Hundred franchise Birmingham Phoenix over potential investment England's Ashes stars woken by fire alarm England’s cricketers suffered a rude awakening ahead of the final Test when a fire alarm sounded at their team hotel. Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow were enjoying breakfast when the siren went off at around 8.10am on Wednesday. They then had to leave immediately, while others emerged from their rooms bleary-eyed. Perhaps in a nod to his love of the sport, Stokes was spotted heading through the lobby with his precious golf clubs over a shoulder, while Bairstow stole a few extra minutes to finish his grub. It is thought a resident on the fourth floor inadvertently set the smoke alarm off while ironing.

But the club were bought last year by Canadian Bob Voulgaris, who made his millions betting on NBA basketball, and who intends to transform the club’s fortunes by applying his advanced data techniques. Voulgaris has enlisted the help of sports industry veteran Robin Taylor and Dave Reddin, who was part of England rugby’s World Cup-winning backroom team in 2003 and latterly a performance guru at the FA. Castellon missed out on promotion last season, losing the play-off final, but the drama was captured on film by TV production company Little Gem. Industry insiders expect the rights will be hotly contested for a series about the club’s long climb to La Liga. Lord Coe set for IOC presidency Lord Coe is a candidate to succeed Thomas Bach as IOC president in 2025. Coe will no doubt be watching the reaction to the IOC’s three-year suspension of Sheik ‘The Kingmaker’ Ahmad from any Olympic involvement. This followed his alleged interference in the recent Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) presidential elections while self-suspended after a forgery conviction in Switzerland. The OCA elections saw Ahmad’s brother, Sheik Talal, elected in a last-minute, four-vote swing amid widespread allegations of corruption and government interference. Well-informed Olympic watchers have said the IOC have taken advantage of the allegations to lock Kuwaiti Sheik Ahmad out as a candidate (or puppet master) in the upcoming IOC presidential election.

In an attempt to build morale, team drinks are being held on the last Thursday of every month. Following the indictment of Joe Lewis, the head of the family that owns the club, and his appearance in a New York court on Wednesday, they may have needed a few stiff ones the next night.

Matt Richards, 20, won gold in the 200metres freestyle in a British one-two ahead of Tom Dean, then went on to win another gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay and a bronze in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay. The BBC opted not to televise the World Championships, which were only available to watch on the Eurovision Sports website. Richards’ dad, Simon, hit out at the broadcaster for failing to give the event any coverage on their flagship evening news programmes. In one of a series of punchy tweets directed at the BBC, Richards said: ‘Absolutely dreadful. Hang your heads in shame.’ The father of British swimmer Matt Richards has criticised the BBC for failing to cover the World Aquatics Championship Nottingham Forest promote Wendy Taylor Nottingham Forest have promoted Wendy Taylor, the club’s communications boss, to their board.

They kept Stuart Broad waiting for a farewell wicket after the England fast-bowling great made a shock announcement on Saturday that he was retiring following this match. Warner was 58 not out and fellow left-hander Khawaja unbeaten on 69 when rain at 14:41 stopped play on the fourth day. Australia need 249 more runs to complete a 3-1 series win and a first Ashes campaign triumph in England since 2001. If Australia do manage to reach that target, it will be the eighth-highest fourth-innings total to win any Test and the second-highest in England, behind Australia's 404/3 at Headingley in 1948 when Arthur Morris made 182 and batting great Don Bradman an unbeaten 173. It would also be a new ground record: the highest successful fourth-innings chase in a Test at The Oval is England's 263-9 against their arch-rivals in 1902. \"It was an outstanding start from our openers,\" Australia batting coach Michael Di Venuto told reporters after stumps. \"There's a lot of (Australian) guys who have been on Ashes series over here (England) in the past...We are in a great position, for some of those boys to get that on their resume. England batting coach Marcus Trescothick, however, insisted the hosts remained in confident mood. \"We're still pretty positive about the job we've got to do,\" he said. \"They (Australia) have had a good start with the bat, and seen off the new ball. \"A couple of early ones (wickets) in the morning and suddenly we're right in the mix again. Fast-medium bowler Broad has dismissed Warner 17 times in Test cricket. Neither he, nor the rest of England's pace attack were able to break through, however, before a persistent downpour cut short the day's play. Warner, 30 not out at lunch, lofted England veteran James Anderson, who turned 41 on Sunday, straight back over the paceman's head for a resounding boundary. Two balls later Anderson, struggling to produce swing, shook Warner up with an accidental head high full-toss, or beamer, the bowler immediately apologising as the ball sped away to the boundary. Khawaja, the leading run scorer in the series, went to fifty with his fifth four in 110 balls when he edged fast bowler Mark Wood. Warner, who by contrast has been struggling for runs, then followed him with a 90-ball fifty featuring seven fours. Australia, as the holders, have already retained the Ashes after arriving in London 2-1 up in the five-match series. Earlier, Broad was given a guard of honour as he made his way to the wicket for the final time, but England added just six runs to their overnight total of 389/9. The 37-year-old seamer is the fifth most successful bowler in Test history, with 602 wickets so far. \"I've had a love affair with the Ashes my whole life and the thought of being able to bowl my last ball and face my last ball against Australia fills me with joy,\" he said. Broad, whose highest Test score is 169, was batting with his long-time bowling partner Anderson. He faced the first over delivered by fellow paceman Mitchell Starc, with Broad pulling the sixth delivery for a towering six. But Anderson was leg before to off-spinner Todd Murphy in the second over as England were dismissed for 395.","pubDate":"2023-07-30 21:55:56","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SOUL OF SPORT: The Ashes ends today with England needing to win the fifth Test to draw the series...

But, England are hoping their retiring fast bowler can produce one final match-winning spell to square the series at 2-2 before joining Sky Sports as a part of their coverage team for cricket. Our man ANDY HOOPER was there to picture the best moments on and off the field - including all the excellent fancy dress outfits on show - at the Oval during the fifth Ashes Test series.

It was an emotional day in south London, with the pair stepping out to receive rapturous applause from the crowd inside The KIA Oval and a guard of honour from Australia . As ever, Broad entertained in the middle of the wicket , smashing a huge six in what could be been the final ball he will ever face with the bat for England. His family, including partner Mollie , dad Chris and mum Carole were all in the stands watching on as Broad subsequently went out to lead the bowling attack for England after Anderson was dismissed by Todd Murphy for lbw. Former England batsman and father of the England bowler, Chris, spoke to Mail Sport's David Coverdale at The Oval on Sunday. Stuart Broad (pictured) announced on Saturday that he would be retiring from cricket ahead of the fourth day of the fifth Ashes Test match at the Oval Chris Broad (right) has been speaking with Mail Online's David Coverdale and says he believes it 'was a brave decision for Stuart (left) to retire' Broad was given a guard of honour by the Australian side as he and his bowling partner James Anderson walked out on to the pitch to finish England's second innings at The Oval We have obviously known that Stuart's career was coming to an end. At 37, how much longer can you go on? So Stuart and I had spoken about this for a while. At the start of the season, he was thinking this was going to be his last series. But once the series started, he was enjoying it so much that he was unsure. I think he acknowledged that in his interviews on Saturday night, when he admitted he only made the decision at 8.30pm on Friday. We found out at eight o'clock on Saturday morning when he phoned us to tell us that he was going to announce that this was his last game. Because we had already talked about it, it wasn't that emotional for me. I just thought it was sensible. When you think about it, it is absolutely the right thing. That is easy for me to say, but for him as well, he just feels that he is doing the right thing at the right time. It's a brave decision when you are still fit enough to play. But he has got to feel in his gut what the right thing to do is, and he has made that decision and I think it is the brave and correct one . He loves the occasion and there is no bigger occasion than an Ashes match in England for him to be able to say goodbye. It is brilliant. I think he would have loved to have ended at Trent Bridge if there was a Test match there. But to end here at the Oval, in front of a full house, is very fitting. He actually grew into English cricket here in 2009 when he got five wickets against Australia. That was when he realised he had a future in the England cricket team. Broad said in a column with Mail Sport that he was 'retiring at the very top of his game' His mother Carloe (left) spoke with BBC Test Match Special reporter Jonathan Agnew at The Oval today and said that now was the perfect time for her son to retire The guard of honour the Australians gave him was lovely. There have been a lot of battles between England and Australian cricketers over the years, but there is such a camaraderie. I still see some of the Australians that I played against in the 1980s and we always have a chat and talk about what has been going on. That sort of thing will continue with Stuart. To have that respect and understanding from the opposition at this time when he has decided to retire is an amazing thing. I am sure he will be very grateful to the Australians for doing that. The round of applause he got at the start of the game, and when he came out to field, and when he went out to the boundary to chase one, was just brilliant. And it was appropriate that his batting ended with him hitting a six - and it was a good six as well. He acknowledged us sitting up here and I think he is soaking up everything he possibly can in these last couple of days. It is great because those memories will stay with him forever. It will be sad if we don't get a result of some sort at the end of this game and it ends up being a damp squib. Broad (pictured) would step out into the middle of the field and smash a six with what could be his final ball in an England Test match Broad (middle) would go on to lead the bowling for England on Sunday but the home side struggled to remove David Warner (right) and Usman Khawaja Earlier in the series, Broad (middle left) amassed his 600th Test wicket for England, putting him behind Anderson as second in England's all-time Test wicket takers tally from 167 matches Stuart has had an extraordinary career. He wanted to get to 100 Test matches, but to get 67 Test matches over that, and still be bowling as well as he has always bowled, perhaps even better than he has bowled, is just amazing. It is testament to his physical fitness and the set-up of the England cricket side that both he and Jimmy Anderson have been able to go on as long as they have done, when so many other bowlers have fallen down the wayside because of injury. Jimmy is carrying on amazingly for 41. Those two are just extraordinary animals, they really are. Commentating is a different animal altogether. I tried that when I finished playing. You've got to know your facts. There are some good commentators around. You have to learn fairly quickly on the job. But I am sure he will be given every opportunity to learn the process. They don't have a bowler on Sky's commentary team now, so they need one to give a bowler's perspective, which is great.

James Anderson , his great mate and the other half of the best bowling partnership in England’s history, stood next to him. A football bobbed about between the men, bouncing off the tops of their thighs and their heads and the insteps of their cricket boots. Full-scale football matches as part of their warm-up were banned some time ago because they were getting too feisty so now they make do with this game called PIG. Three mistakes, three lapses of control, from one person and he gets flicked around the head by the other players. Broad used to be the chairman of the warm-up game but on Saturday morning, he passed that honour on to Ben Duckett. It was part of moving on. It was part of saying goodbye. And so, under the upturned rim of his blue bucket hat, Broad grinned as he played and he and Anderson took great delight in flicking the forehead of Josh Tongue when he completed his trio of errors. Broad left the game early and ran up the stairs to the changing room to pad up for the last time before he retires. A few minutes before 11am, Pat Cummins led the Australian players out on the pitch and they milled around by the boundary. They had decided to form a guard of honour for Broad when he and Anderson walked out to resume their last-wicket stand. They looked a little awkward about it. They had a Test match to win. Stuart Broad will retire upon the conclusion of the final Ashes Test following a 17-year career Broad and James Anderson will bowl together for the last time on Monday during the final Ashes Test But they parted into two lines and waited for Broad to appear and, eventually, after the strains of Jerusalem rang around the ground, Broad and Anderson came down the steps, too. Broad took his helmet off and ran his fingers through his hair as he walked towards the Australians. He and Anderson paused for a second and Broad put his arm around his mate. The photographers captured that moment from behind, England’s No 8 and England’s No 9 frozen together in time, our greatest bowlers inseparable, just as they always seem to have been inseparable. Broad walked forward through the guard of honour. The capacity crowd at this ground, which has seen so many emotional departures down the years, roared and cheered. The Australians applauded him, even David Warner, who may have been wondering whether he was about to fall victim to Broad for the 18th time in his career. Broad has been their implacable foe for 16 years. He has taken more Australian wickets in Ashes Tests than any other English bowler. He has been a thorn in their side. He has delighted in their discomfort. He has taken their brickbats. He famously refused to walk that time at Trent Bridge. And yet they applauded him. And they meant it. And it was hard not to wonder in that moment whether that is what Broad will miss the most when he has gone: the camaraderie of competition between elite athletes, the friendship that comes with rivalry, the joy of playing elite professional sport with your friends, the adrenaline of being in the arena. Anderson hung back and as the Aussies broke their lines, they teased him and laughed with him and made a show of ushering him through the guard of honour, too. Perhaps they would like to hasten his goodbye, too, but Anderson is not for leaving yet. And he is certainly not one for stealing his mate’s limelight. He waited until Cummins and the rest were dispersing and only then did he walk forward. Broad has taken more Australian wickets in Ashes Tests than any other English bowler, a thorn in their side for the last 16 years It feels so strange to think that we will not see these two bowling again after Monday. They have been a fixture of our cricketing lives for so long, twinned in our minds and in the history books, Anderson third in the list of all-time Test wicket takers on 690 and Broad fifth on 602. We will never see a partnership like theirs again. Broad’s reward for this outpouring of emotion and affection and respect was to face Mitchell Starc, Australia’s top wicket-taker in this series, in the first over of the day. Broad blocked the first ball safely and took ineffective swings at a couple of others. Starc dug the last ball of the over in short and Broad stepped back away from the stumps and swatted the ball away high in the air in the direction of Archbishop Tenison’s School. It sailed and sailed through the air, sucked towards the stands in the same way Bill Shankly said the Kop used to suck footballs towards the goal at Anfield, and cleared the ropes. It is astonishing how often sport does this, how often great sportsmen summon endings like this. Anderson was out the next over and so Broad’s last shot in Test cricket was a six against Australia. It was his 55th Test six, by the way. Only Ben Stokes, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and Ian Botham have scored more for England. It is a wrong-headed comparison, perhaps, but it was hard not to think of another famous ending at this ground, when Don Bradman walked out here in August 1948 needing only four runs in his last innings to achieve an average of 100. Bradman was bowled second ball by leg spinner Eric Hollies for a duck and his average was stuck on 99.94 for the rest of time. Not all final appearances with bat in hand come to such an auspicious close as Broad’s did yesterday. What Broad really wanted, of course, was to replicate that farewell with the ball in his hand. As he ran off to get ready to lead England’s attack, the big screens on either side of the ground played a montage of some of his greatest moments in Ashes Tests. It was not a short film. It was still running when Broad came back out on to the pitch, his white headband tied around his hair, and as he loosened up, the screens took him and us back to his youth. They showed pictures of him dismissing Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke and Steve Smith and, of course, Warner. Anderson is third in the list of all-time Test wicket takers on 690 and Broad is fifth on 602 They showed him celebrating with Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell and Matt Prior, players who have long left the competitive arena. They reminded us of Broad’s longevity and the place he has in the hearts of England cricket supporters everywhere. The fairytale part of Broad’s day stalled there. Sport is not all final-ball sixes and pats on the back. Broad knows that as well as anyone. And so, in this innings of all innings, Warner refused resolutely to play the role of Broad’s bunny. In this innings of all innings, Warner looked more comfortable against Broad than he has ever looked. Warner played superbly. Usman Khawaja batted beautifully, too. In this innings of all innings, they compiled their highest opening stand of the entire series, comfortably surpassing the 73 that was their previous best. Khawaja also moved beyond Zak Crawley as the series’ leading run-scorer. Broad bowled well. He bowled six overs and two maidens for 15 runs but could not prise a wicket out of the new-found stubbornness of the Australians, who reached 135 without loss and, in the process, raised the spectre of a spectacular fourth-innings run chase. And then the rains came. And Broad’s penultimate day ended with the sight of covers that gleamed with rain and hoods and umbrellas and dark clouds scudding across a forbidding sky. He gets one more day of his cricketing life. One more day to bring the crowd to its feet, one more day to bound in from the top of his run with the wind in his hair, one more day to send an Australian batsman’s stump cartwheeling along the turf, one more day to chase a ball in the field and feel his sunhat flying off his head, one more day to wind up the Aussies, one more day to get Warner, one more day to love this part of his life that playing cricket has given him, one more day to try to do, for the last time, what he has done so many times before.

Stuart Broad took centre stage in the morning after he announced his retirement from cricket on Saturday evening, with players and fans applauding him. James Anderson was dismissed by Todd Murphy for lbw, with Australia coming out to bat. England then took to the field with Broad and Anderson leading the attack, but they could not dismiss Australian openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner . Both players would advance to make their half-centuries, and form a partnership of 135 before heavy rain wiped out play. Australia require another 249 runs to win the Ashes. Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH takes a look at the big stats of the day. Australia sit 135-0 in pursuit of 384 after day four of the fifth Ashes Test on Sunday Play was abandoned at The Oval when the rain got heavy shortly into the afternoon session Broad bowing out in style Stuart Broad became only the second player – after West Indian Wayne Daniel – known to have hit his final ball in Test cricket for six when he launched Mitchell Starc high over midwicket. Australia’s Glenn Maxwell also hit the last ball he faced in Tests, against Bangladesh six years ago, over the fence, but he has not yet retired. Stuart Broad became only the second player to have hit his final ball in Test cricket for six Tourists' bowlers take a hit Australia’s seamers have all taken a pummelling in this series, with captain Pat Cummins’s economy-rate of 4.27 the cheapest. The most expensive has been all-rounder Cameron Green’s eye-watering 5.14. Khawaja overtakes Crawley When Usman Khawaja moved to 59 with a cut for four off Joe Root, he overtook Zak Crawley’s total of 480 to become the leading run-scorer in the series – though he had taken 1,246 balls to Crawley’s 548. Usman Khawaja (L) overtook Zak Crawley to become the leading run-scorer in the series Anderson's figures Jimmy Anderson’s figures of none for 34 took his series analysis to five wicket at 81 each.

Ashes series has been heated There have been repeated fan incidents Aussie players have had enough By Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 01:15 BST, 31 July 2023 e-mail View comments Video has emerged of more fan abuse in a heated Ashes series, with Aussie players Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne confronting a heckler during the fifth Test at The Oval. Footage shows the Aussie players returning to the dressing sheds on day three of the final Ashes Test, which hangs in the balance heading into the final day of play. It shows an agitated fan relentlessly abusing every member of the Aussie side until Khawaja and Labuschagne stop to call him out. The exchange went like this: Unnamed man: 'Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!' Labuschagne: 'What did you say, mate?' Usman: 'Calm down, calm down.' Labuschagne: 'Hey, hey, oi! *whistles*' Unnamed man: 'I apologise' Labuschagne: 'You were just about to go at everybody else.' It had been a difficult day in the field for the Australians and Labuschagne was in no mood for more fan heckling The unnamed heckler chanted 'boring' at the Aussie cricket team, leading Labuschagne to return serve before being ushered away by teammate Khawaja Khawaja then ushered his teammate up the stairs and the heckler stopped his tirade against the rest of the players. It is the latest incident of poor fan behaviour in the Ashes series, which also saw several Lord's members suspended for abusing Aussie cricketers. During the second Ashes test, Australian cricketer Khawaja confronted and pointed out MCC members he wanted ejected from Lord's after their hostile behavior towards the Australian team. He was seen remonstrating with England fans in the Long Room and asked security to remove specific individuals who had reportedly booed and called the Aussies cheats. While that incident involved English supporters and Lord's members, there has been some suggestion the latest heckler may have been Australian. 'Sounds Aussie to me,' Barmy Army trumpet player Simon Finch posted. 'Bit of debate whether old mate is Pom or Aussie. Regardless, weird behaviour considering Aus are 2-1 up.' McCormick posted. 'Apologies if he is Aussie, point stands - They're not there to play t20 cricket for the crowds pleasure. 'Boring' is barely an insult but don't melt to water when called out.' Some cricket fans slammed the unknown heckler for failing to understand Test cricket. 'Another borish day tripper with no interest in cricket. Imagine going to watch some of the best players in the world at an elite sporting event and claiming you're bored. It's been another brilliant test. What do people want?' asked one fan. Khawaja was involved in another incident of poor fan behaviour when Lord's members ruthlessly abused the Aussie cricket players including chanting 'cheat' at them It has been a heated Ashes series on and off the pitch, with fans of both nations crossing the line on occasion The latest incident was triggered by slow over rates which have seen the English side - including retiring pace bowler Stuart Broad - fined on two occasions Others thought fans had every right to feel aggrieved because of constantly slow over rates during the Ashes series. 'He was right - going at 3 an over and a slow over-rate to grind the game to a halt is boring and a rip off,' another fan posted. 'Fans should be seeing 90 overs a day and they are getting short changed by 10+ overs a day when Australia are in the field. It's not as if it's an accident either.' Both Australia and England were docked 40 per cent of their match fee and penalised two World Test Championship points each for slow over rates in the first Test at Edgbaston. England players were then docked their entire match fee at Lord's for slow over rates.

Start your free trial now > Smith & Marsh hilariously troll Anderson | 00:33 ‘IT’S A MISTAKE’: MYSTERY AS ENGLAND QUICK DISAPPEARS Mark Wood has been England’s most destructive weapon with the ball this winter, but the paceman was nowhere to be seen at The Oval on Sunday morning. Australian openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja chipped away at the deficit before lunch on day four, but England captain Ben Stokes was seemingly reluctant to throw the Dukes ball to his fastest bowler. Injured off-spinner Moeen Ali and part-time Joe Root were each given a spell before the lunch break, which is understandable considering there were two left-handers at the crease — but the absence of Wood certainly raised eyebrows. A spectator at The Oval walked over to the press box early in the afternoon session and asked if the right-armer was injured. Speaking on Channel 9, former Australian batter Callum Ferguson suggested England was waiting for the Dukes ball to start reversing before introducing Wood to the attack. “You can see that England are employing an interesting strategy,” Ferguson said. “They’re holding back their fastest bowler, Mark Wood, in the hope they can get the ball reversing and target the stumps and try and blow a few away quickly of the Australian top order.” Former Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy continued: “I think it’s a mistake that Wood hasn’t bowled four overs with a brand-new ball.” Wood was seen talking with the team physio earlier on Sunday, raising suspicion the 33-year-old was nursing a minor niggle. However, he was on the field for the entire morning session, so an injury seemed unlikely. READ MORE Ashes vision of Alex Carey brutally rejecting Todd Murphy goes viral ‘What did you say?’: Aussie stars confront Ashes spectactor Speaking on Sky Sports, former England captain Nasser Hussain pointed out that the pitch and overhead conditions didn’t favour Wood’s bowling. “The pace has been sucked out of this pitch — there is no pace in it at all,” Hussain said. “The problem with holding Wood back is this weather. Reverse swing and rain aren’t really friends. When the ground gets wet, the ball gets wet and reverse swing disappears. “If it does reverse, England will go their Pakistan tactics with Wood and Stokes, who bowled before play today.” Wood was finally introduced in the 33rd over, immediately bringing the crowd back to life. His first delivery to Khawaja was edged through to the slips cordon, with the left-hander copping a blow to the helmet a couple of overs later. Wood found Khawaja’s outside edge twice in his third over before running off the field, fuelling speculation about a mystery injury. Mark Wood of England.

The veteran opener has expressed his desire to finish his red-ball career with a farewell Test at the SCG next summer — if selected. Despite a stellar performance in the Lord’s Test, Warner’s Ashes campaign has been underwhelming, albeit significantly improving from his previous England tour in 2019. He has developed a frustrating habit of making starts without converting them into fifties, including both innings of the recent Old Trafford Test. Nobody has passed 20 more often than Warner during this series, yet he hasn’t cracked the top ten leading run-scorers. However, Warner saved his best batting performance of the series for last, combining with Usman Khawaja for an unbeaten 135-run opening partnership at The Oval to set up a thrilling fifth day in London. Warner makes the most of wild delivery | 00:29 The New South Welshman’s footwork was dynamic on Sunday, shimmying down the pitch at England’s bowlers and looking to attack loose deliveries. Despite repeatedly picking the fielders, he still managed to reach his half-century in 90 deliveries. “We have seen plenty of energy,” Australian batting coach Micahel Di Venuto said at stumps. “So far in this innings he has looked really good, made some good decisions, and played really nicely.” Warner was unbeaten on 58 when rain halted his momentum — he was eyeing his highest Test score in the United Kingdom (85), which coincidentally occurred at the same venue in 2015. The 36-year-old, who will continue his final away Test innings on Monday, has not scored a Test hundred outside of Australia since September 2017. Australia opener David Warner. Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images If he can reach triple figures on Monday, it would be difficult for national selectors to drop him ahead of December’s series opener against Pakistan. If Australia wins this Test match, he’ll return home a national hero. “Warner knows that if he gets a hundred here, he will get his wish and bow out in Sydney next year,” former England captain Nasser Hussain said on Sky Sports. “Both he and Khawaja have played excellently. Khawaja has looked busy with his batting but also with his running between the wickets, which is what Warner likes.” KHAWAJA THE ANTI-BAZBALLER LEADS RUNS TALLY In what will be forever known as the Bazball Ashes, traditional Test cricket may prove to have the definitive say. Usman Khawaja has been the antithesis of England’s approach for most of the series — he’s been a thorn in the host’s side all winter, facing well over 1200 balls, which is 580 more than the next most (Marnus Labuschagne). “One of the themes of this summer has been seeing how well Khawaja plays the defensive shot,” commentator Daniel Norcross said on BBC Test Match Special . The Queenslander will end the series as the leading run-scorer from both sides, currently sitting on 493. In contrast to the clash of styles, Ben Stokes is the only England batter to have faced more than 600 balls in the series, while the second-leading run-scorer in the series, opener Zak Crawley, had faced 541 just deliveries. “Is there anyone less Bazball than Usman Khawaja?” Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath asked on BCC TMS . Usman Khawaja of Australia. Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: FOX SPORTS When Khawaja reached his half-century at The Oval, his third for the series to go with his century at Edgbaston, he became the 21st Australian cricketer to pass 5000 Test runs. Since his recall in January 2022, he’s made 2114 runs at 62.17 with seven centuries, the most of any Australian batter since. Khawaja has built his way with a calm, no-fuss approach to Test cricket, going along at his own pace. He came under fire in the first innings for failing to move the game forward, heaping extra pressure on his teammates. Noting the change of approach in the second innings, former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy was impressed with Khawaja’s added intent at the crease on Sunday. “He’s playing the way Usman Khawaja does,” Healy said on Channel 9. “He’s just doing it with a bit more hunt in his attitude. “When there is a half volley, he’s getting into the shot, looking to hurt it and not just field it into a gap. “When he’s at his best, he does that with a bit of finesse. He plays with nice soft hands in that moment, and he is able to switch to his guns and hit the ball hard when it’s there to hit.” ENGLAND’S FORTUNES CHANGE AFTER BALL CHANGE The Dukes ball wasn’t swinging for England’s seamers on Sunday morning — James Anderson, arguably the greatest swing bowler in history, couldn’t get it move, and neither could Chris Woakes. It allowed Australian openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner to survive the new-ball burst, with England turning to spin after just nine overs. After Khawaja copped a nasty blow to the helmet early in the 37th over, umpires decided to change the ball, which had apparently lost its shape after Mark Wood’s bumper. However, much to England’s delight, Wood’s first delivery with the fresh Dukes hooped into the left-handed Khawaja, which raised some eyebrows in the Sky Sports commentary box.

Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “It certainly looks a lot newer than the one they changed from,” Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting remarked. “Look at how much writing is on the side of that ball.” Former Test opener Mark Taylor continued: “It really pinged off the bat. It even sounds harder.” Wood’s next delivery found Khawaja’s outside edge, with the ball racing towards third man for a boundary. Later in the same over, a leading edge narrowly evaded the point fielder. Only six further deliveries were bowled before the rain arrived in London, but England will feel confident their new Dukes pill can cause some damage on Monday morning.","pubDate":"2023-07-30 22:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SPORTS AGENDA: Everton's new stadium is far from completion after TWO YEARS of building work","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-12354279/SPORTS-AGENDA-Evertons-new-stadium-far-completion-TWO-YEARS-building-work.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MIKE KEEGAN: There was some head scratching at Championship clubs last week when they received their teamsheet books ahead of the new season.","content":"SPORTS AGENDA: Everton's new stadium is far from completion after TWO YEARS of building work Pictures of Everton's new ground show it is far from done after two years of work They say the 53,000 seater stadium is due to open in the final months of 2024 England's Ashes stars were woken by a fire alarm before the final Ashes Test By Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail Updated: 23:00 BST, 30 July 2023 e-mail View comments There was some head scratching at Championship clubs last week when they received their teamsheet books ahead of the new season. As Mail Sport revealed, second-tier sides voted to increase the number of substitutes named in matchday squads from seven to nine, while their counterparts in Leagues One and Two remain with seven on the bench. However, when the paperwork turned up officials were surprised to find only seven spaces to fill in for subs, instead of nine. The EFL told them it was due to a printing error, leading one official to joke: ‘I wonder if they are going to fine themselves?’ Meanwhile, the EFL have outlined to clubs their stance on taking the knee. Any player who wishes to make the anti-racism gesture will be given the opportunity to do so by the referee. Everton's slow stadium build Pictures taken of Everton’s new stadium two years to the day work started show it remains some way from completion. The shots, taken by Daily Mail photographer Bruce Adams last Wednesday, illustrate what still appears to be a fairly skeletal structure. Everton say the 53,000-capacity venue, on the banks of the Mersey, should be open ‘in the final months of 2024’ but there are concerns they may have to remain at Goodison Park for another two seasons. By comparison, Tottenham’s new home opened three years after the project was signed off in 2016.

The prospect is intriguing given the status of the Hundred, which has split opinion. The competition faces challenges from abroad, not least from the US’s Major League Cricket. It is understood that officials are keen on securing external funding as they seek to make it a success. IPL franchise Punjab Kings have held talks with Hundred franchise Birmingham Phoenix over potential investment England's Ashes stars woken by fire alarm England’s cricketers suffered a rude awakening ahead of the final Test when a fire alarm sounded at their team hotel. Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow were enjoying breakfast when the siren went off at around 8.10am on Wednesday. They then had to leave immediately, while others emerged from their rooms bleary-eyed. Perhaps in a nod to his love of the sport, Stokes was spotted heading through the lobby with his precious golf clubs over a shoulder, while Bairstow stole a few extra minutes to finish his grub. It is thought a resident on the fourth floor inadvertently set the smoke alarm off while ironing.

But the club were bought last year by Canadian Bob Voulgaris, who made his millions betting on NBA basketball, and who intends to transform the club’s fortunes by applying his advanced data techniques. Voulgaris has enlisted the help of sports industry veteran Robin Taylor and Dave Reddin, who was part of England rugby’s World Cup-winning backroom team in 2003 and latterly a performance guru at the FA. Castellon missed out on promotion last season, losing the play-off final, but the drama was captured on film by TV production company Little Gem.

Lord Coe set for IOC presidency Lord Coe is a candidate to succeed Thomas Bach as IOC president in 2025. Coe will no doubt be watching the reaction to the IOC’s three-year suspension of Sheik ‘The Kingmaker’ Ahmad from any Olympic involvement. This followed his alleged interference in the recent Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) presidential elections while self-suspended after a forgery conviction in Switzerland. The OCA elections saw Ahmad’s brother, Sheik Talal, elected in a last-minute, four-vote swing amid widespread allegations of corruption and government interference. Well-informed Olympic watchers have said the IOC have taken advantage of the allegations to lock Kuwaiti Sheik Ahmad out as a candidate (or puppet master) in the upcoming IOC presidential election.

In an attempt to build morale, team drinks are being held on the last Thursday of every month.

Matt Richards, 20, won gold in the 200metres freestyle in a British one-two ahead of Tom Dean, then went on to win another gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay and a bronze in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay. The BBC opted not to televise the World Championships, which were only available to watch on the Eurovision Sports website. Richards’ dad, Simon, hit out at the broadcaster for failing to give the event any coverage on their flagship evening news programmes. In one of a series of punchy tweets directed at the BBC, Richards said: ‘Absolutely dreadful. Hang your heads in shame.’ The father of British swimmer Matt Richards has criticised the BBC for failing to cover the World Aquatics Championship Nottingham Forest promote Wendy Taylor Nottingham Forest have promoted Wendy Taylor, the club’s communications boss, to their board.

They kept Stuart Broad waiting for a farewell wicket after the England fast-bowling great made a shock announcement on Saturday that he was retiring following this match. Warner was 58 not out and fellow left-hander Khawaja unbeaten on 69 when rain at 14:41 stopped play on the fourth day. Australia need 249 more runs to complete a 3-1 series win and a first Ashes campaign triumph in England since 2001. If Australia do manage to reach that target, it will be the eighth-highest fourth-innings total to win any Test and the second-highest in England, behind Australia's 404/3 at Headingley in 1948 when Arthur Morris made 182 and batting great Don Bradman an unbeaten 173. It would also be a new ground record: the highest successful fourth-innings chase in a Test at The Oval is England's 263-9 against their arch-rivals in 1902. \"It was an outstanding start from our openers,\" Australia batting coach Michael Di Venuto told reporters after stumps. \"There's a lot of (Australian) guys who have been on Ashes series over here (England) in the past...We are in a great position, for some of those boys to get that on their resume. England batting coach Marcus Trescothick, however, insisted the hosts remained in confident mood. \"We're still pretty positive about the job we've got to do,\" he said. \"They (Australia) have had a good start with the bat, and seen off the new ball. \"A couple of early ones (wickets) in the morning and suddenly we're right in the mix again. Fast-medium bowler Broad has dismissed Warner 17 times in Test cricket. Neither he, nor the rest of England's pace attack were able to break through, however, before a persistent downpour cut short the day's play. Warner, 30 not out at lunch, lofted England veteran James Anderson, who turned 41 on Sunday, straight back over the paceman's head for a resounding boundary. Two balls later Anderson, struggling to produce swing, shook Warner up with an accidental head high full-toss, or beamer, the bowler immediately apologising as the ball sped away to the boundary. Khawaja, the leading run scorer in the series, went to fifty with his fifth four in 110 balls when he edged fast bowler Mark Wood. Warner, who by contrast has been struggling for runs, then followed him with a 90-ball fifty featuring seven fours. Australia, as the holders, have already retained the Ashes after arriving in London 2-1 up in the five-match series. Earlier, Broad was given a guard of honour as he made his way to the wicket for the final time, but England added just six runs to their overnight total of 389/9. The 37-year-old seamer is the fifth most successful bowler in Test history, with 602 wickets so far. \"I've had a love affair with the Ashes my whole life and the thought of being able to bowl my last ball and face my last ball against Australia fills me with joy,\" he said. Broad, whose highest Test score is 169, was batting with his long-time bowling partner Anderson. He faced the first over delivered by fellow paceman Mitchell Starc, with Broad pulling the sixth delivery for a towering six. But Anderson was leg before to off-spinner Todd Murphy in the second over as England were dismissed for 395.","pubDate":"2023-07-30 21:55:56","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SOUL OF SPORT: The Ashes ends today with England needing to win the fifth Test to draw the series...

For our latest episode of the series, ANDY HOOPER travelled to the Oval to capture the best of the action from England's fifth Ashes Test against Australia. It's been a particularly memorable Test as Stuart Broad announced his imminent retirement from cricket after a stellar 17-year career. Additionally, Australia reached 135 without loss on a rain-hit fourth day at the Oval - meaning they need another 249 runs to complete their second-highest run chase and seal a first series victory here since 2001. But, England are hoping their retiring fast bowler can produce one final match-winning spell to square the series at 2-2 before joining Sky Sports as a part of their coverage team for cricket.

It was an emotional day in south London, with the pair stepping out to receive rapturous applause from the crowd inside The KIA Oval and a guard of honour from Australia . As ever, Broad entertained in the middle of the wicket , smashing a huge six in what could be been the final ball he will ever face with the bat for England. His family, including partner Mollie , dad Chris and mum Carole were all in the stands watching on as Broad subsequently went out to lead the bowling attack for England after Anderson was dismissed by Todd Murphy for lbw. Former England batsman and father of the England bowler, Chris, spoke to Mail Sport's David Coverdale at The Oval on Sunday. Stuart Broad (pictured) announced on Saturday that he would be retiring from cricket ahead of the fourth day of the fifth Ashes Test match at the Oval Chris Broad (right) has been speaking with Mail Online's David Coverdale and says he believes it 'was a brave decision for Stuart (left) to retire' Broad was given a guard of honour by the Australian side as he and his bowling partner James Anderson walked out on to the pitch to finish England's second innings at The Oval We have obviously known that Stuart's career was coming to an end. At 37, how much longer can you go on? So Stuart and I had spoken about this for a while. At the start of the season, he was thinking this was going to be his last series. But once the series started, he was enjoying it so much that he was unsure. I think he acknowledged that in his interviews on Saturday night, when he admitted he only made the decision at 8.30pm on Friday. We found out at eight o'clock on Saturday morning when he phoned us to tell us that he was going to announce that this was his last game. Because we had already talked about it, it wasn't that emotional for me. I just thought it was sensible. When you think about it, it is absolutely the right thing. That is easy for me to say, but for him as well, he just feels that he is doing the right thing at the right time. It's a brave decision when you are still fit enough to play. But he has got to feel in his gut what the right thing to do is, and he has made that decision and I think it is the brave and correct one . He loves the occasion and there is no bigger occasion than an Ashes match in England for him to be able to say goodbye. It is brilliant. I think he would have loved to have ended at Trent Bridge if there was a Test match there. But to end here at the Oval, in front of a full house, is very fitting. He actually grew into English cricket here in 2009 when he got five wickets against Australia. That was when he realised he had a future in the England cricket team. Broad said in a column with Mail Sport that he was 'retiring at the very top of his game' His mother Carloe (left) spoke with BBC Test Match Special reporter Jonathan Agnew at The Oval today and said that now was the perfect time for her son to retire The guard of honour the Australians gave him was lovely. There have been a lot of battles between England and Australian cricketers over the years, but there is such a camaraderie. I still see some of the Australians that I played against in the 1980s and we always have a chat and talk about what has been going on. That sort of thing will continue with Stuart. To have that respect and understanding from the opposition at this time when he has decided to retire is an amazing thing. I am sure he will be very grateful to the Australians for doing that. The round of applause he got at the start of the game, and when he came out to field, and when he went out to the boundary to chase one, was just brilliant. And it was appropriate that his batting ended with him hitting a six - and it was a good six as well. He acknowledged us sitting up here and I think he is soaking up everything he possibly can in these last couple of days. It is great because those memories will stay with him forever. It will be sad if we don't get a result of some sort at the end of this game and it ends up being a damp squib. Broad (pictured) would step out into the middle of the field and smash a six with what could be his final ball in an England Test match Broad (middle) would go on to lead the bowling for England on Sunday but the home side struggled to remove David Warner (right) and Usman Khawaja Earlier in the series, Broad (middle left) amassed his 600th Test wicket for England, putting him behind Anderson as second in England's all-time Test wicket takers tally from 167 matches Stuart has had an extraordinary career. He wanted to get to 100 Test matches, but to get 67 Test matches over that, and still be bowling as well as he has always bowled, perhaps even better than he has bowled, is just amazing. It is testament to his physical fitness and the set-up of the England cricket side that both he and Jimmy Anderson have been able to go on as long as they have done, when so many other bowlers have fallen down the wayside because of injury. Jimmy is carrying on amazingly for 41. Those two are just extraordinary animals, they really are. Commentating is a different animal altogether. I tried that when I finished playing. You've got to know your facts. There are some good commentators around. You have to learn fairly quickly on the job. But I am sure he will be given every opportunity to learn the process. They don't have a bowler on Sky's commentary team now, so they need one to give a bowler's perspective, which is great.

James Anderson , his great mate and the other half of the best bowling partnership in England’s history, stood next to him. A football bobbed about between the men, bouncing off the tops of their thighs and their heads and the insteps of their cricket boots. Full-scale football matches as part of their warm-up were banned some time ago because they were getting too feisty so now they make do with this game called PIG. Three mistakes, three lapses of control, from one person and he gets flicked around the head by the other players. Broad used to be the chairman of the warm-up game but on Saturday morning, he passed that honour on to Ben Duckett. It was part of moving on. It was part of saying goodbye. And so, under the upturned rim of his blue bucket hat, Broad grinned as he played and he and Anderson took great delight in flicking the forehead of Josh Tongue when he completed his trio of errors. Broad left the game early and ran up the stairs to the changing room to pad up for the last time before he retires. A few minutes before 11am, Pat Cummins led the Australian players out on the pitch and they milled around by the boundary. They had decided to form a guard of honour for Broad when he and Anderson walked out to resume their last-wicket stand. They looked a little awkward about it. They had a Test match to win. Stuart Broad will retire upon the conclusion of the final Ashes Test following a 17-year career Broad and James Anderson will bowl together for the last time on Monday during the final Ashes Test But they parted into two lines and waited for Broad to appear and, eventually, after the strains of Jerusalem rang around the ground, Broad and Anderson came down the steps, too. Broad took his helmet off and ran his fingers through his hair as he walked towards the Australians. He and Anderson paused for a second and Broad put his arm around his mate. The photographers captured that moment from behind, England’s No 8 and England’s No 9 frozen together in time, our greatest bowlers inseparable, just as they always seem to have been inseparable. Broad walked forward through the guard of honour. The capacity crowd at this ground, which has seen so many emotional departures down the years, roared and cheered. The Australians applauded him, even David Warner, who may have been wondering whether he was about to fall victim to Broad for the 18th time in his career. Broad has been their implacable foe for 16 years. He has taken more Australian wickets in Ashes Tests than any other English bowler. He has been a thorn in their side. He has delighted in their discomfort. He has taken their brickbats. He famously refused to walk that time at Trent Bridge. And yet they applauded him. And they meant it. And it was hard not to wonder in that moment whether that is what Broad will miss the most when he has gone: the camaraderie of competition between elite athletes, the friendship that comes with rivalry, the joy of playing elite professional sport with your friends, the adrenaline of being in the arena. Anderson hung back and as the Aussies broke their lines, they teased him and laughed with him and made a show of ushering him through the guard of honour, too. Perhaps they would like to hasten his goodbye, too, but Anderson is not for leaving yet. And he is certainly not one for stealing his mate’s limelight. He waited until Cummins and the rest were dispersing and only then did he walk forward. Broad has taken more Australian wickets in Ashes Tests than any other English bowler, a thorn in their side for the last 16 years It feels so strange to think that we will not see these two bowling again after Monday. They have been a fixture of our cricketing lives for so long, twinned in our minds and in the history books, Anderson third in the list of all-time Test wicket takers on 690 and Broad fifth on 602. We will never see a partnership like theirs again. Broad’s reward for this outpouring of emotion and affection and respect was to face Mitchell Starc, Australia’s top wicket-taker in this series, in the first over of the day. Broad blocked the first ball safely and took ineffective swings at a couple of others. Starc dug the last ball of the over in short and Broad stepped back away from the stumps and swatted the ball away high in the air in the direction of Archbishop Tenison’s School. It sailed and sailed through the air, sucked towards the stands in the same way Bill Shankly said the Kop used to suck footballs towards the goal at Anfield, and cleared the ropes. It is astonishing how often sport does this, how often great sportsmen summon endings like this. Anderson was out the next over and so Broad’s last shot in Test cricket was a six against Australia. It was his 55th Test six, by the way. Only Ben Stokes, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and Ian Botham have scored more for England. It is a wrong-headed comparison, perhaps, but it was hard not to think of another famous ending at this ground, when Don Bradman walked out here in August 1948 needing only four runs in his last innings to achieve an average of 100. Bradman was bowled second ball by leg spinner Eric Hollies for a duck and his average was stuck on 99.94 for the rest of time. Not all final appearances with bat in hand come to such an auspicious close as Broad’s did yesterday. What Broad really wanted, of course, was to replicate that farewell with the ball in his hand. As he ran off to get ready to lead England’s attack, the big screens on either side of the ground played a montage of some of his greatest moments in Ashes Tests. It was not a short film. It was still running when Broad came back out on to the pitch, his white headband tied around his hair, and as he loosened up, the screens took him and us back to his youth. They showed pictures of him dismissing Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke and Steve Smith and, of course, Warner. Anderson is third in the list of all-time Test wicket takers on 690 and Broad is fifth on 602 They showed him celebrating with Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell and Matt Prior, players who have long left the competitive arena. They reminded us of Broad’s longevity and the place he has in the hearts of England cricket supporters everywhere. The fairytale part of Broad’s day stalled there. Sport is not all final-ball sixes and pats on the back. Broad knows that as well as anyone. And so, in this innings of all innings, Warner refused resolutely to play the role of Broad’s bunny. In this innings of all innings, Warner looked more comfortable against Broad than he has ever looked. Warner played superbly. Usman Khawaja batted beautifully, too. In this innings of all innings, they compiled their highest opening stand of the entire series, comfortably surpassing the 73 that was their previous best. Khawaja also moved beyond Zak Crawley as the series’ leading run-scorer. Broad bowled well. He bowled six overs and two maidens for 15 runs but could not prise a wicket out of the new-found stubbornness of the Australians, who reached 135 without loss and, in the process, raised the spectre of a spectacular fourth-innings run chase. And then the rains came. And Broad’s penultimate day ended with the sight of covers that gleamed with rain and hoods and umbrellas and dark clouds scudding across a forbidding sky. He gets one more day of his cricketing life. One more day to bring the crowd to its feet, one more day to bound in from the top of his run with the wind in his hair, one more day to send an Australian batsman’s stump cartwheeling along the turf, one more day to chase a ball in the field and feel his sunhat flying off his head, one more day to wind up the Aussies, one more day to get Warner, one more day to love this part of his life that playing cricket has given him, one more day to try to do, for the last time, what he has done so many times before.

Stuart Broad took centre stage in the morning after he announced his retirement from cricket on Saturday evening, with players and fans applauding him. James Anderson was dismissed by Todd Murphy for lbw, with Australia coming out to bat. England then took to the field with Broad and Anderson leading the attack, but they could not dismiss Australian openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner . Both players would advance to make their half-centuries, and form a partnership of 135 before heavy rain wiped out play. Australia require another 249 runs to win the Ashes. Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH takes a look at the big stats of the day. Australia sit 135-0 in pursuit of 384 after day four of the fifth Ashes Test on Sunday Play was abandoned at The Oval when the rain got heavy shortly into the afternoon session Broad bowing out in style Stuart Broad became only the second player – after West Indian Wayne Daniel – known to have hit his final ball in Test cricket for six when he launched Mitchell Starc high over midwicket. Australia’s Glenn Maxwell also hit the last ball he faced in Tests, against Bangladesh six years ago, over the fence, but he has not yet retired. Stuart Broad became only the second player to have hit his final ball in Test cricket for six Tourists' bowlers take a hit Australia’s seamers have all taken a pummelling in this series, with captain Pat Cummins’s economy-rate of 4.27 the cheapest. The most expensive has been all-rounder Cameron Green’s eye-watering 5.14. Khawaja overtakes Crawley When Usman Khawaja moved to 59 with a cut for four off Joe Root, he overtook Zak Crawley’s total of 480 to become the leading run-scorer in the series – though he had taken 1,246 balls to Crawley’s 548. Usman Khawaja (L) overtook Zak Crawley to become the leading run-scorer in the series Anderson's figures Jimmy Anderson’s figures of none for 34 took his series analysis to five wicket at 81 each.

Ashes series has been heated There have been repeated fan incidents Aussie players have had enough By Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Updated: 01:15 BST, 31 July 2023 e-mail View comments Video has emerged of more fan abuse in a heated Ashes series, with Aussie players Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne confronting a heckler during the fifth Test at The Oval. Footage shows the Aussie players returning to the dressing sheds on day three of the final Ashes Test, which hangs in the balance heading into the final day of play. It shows an agitated fan relentlessly abusing every member of the Aussie side until Khawaja and Labuschagne stop to call him out. The exchange went like this: Unnamed man: 'Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!' Labuschagne: 'What did you say, mate?' Usman: 'Calm down, calm down.' Labuschagne: 'Hey, hey, oi! *whistles*' Unnamed man: 'I apologise' Labuschagne: 'You were just about to go at everybody else.' It had been a difficult day in the field for the Australians and Labuschagne was in no mood for more fan heckling The unnamed heckler chanted 'boring' at the Aussie cricket team, leading Labuschagne to return serve before being ushered away by teammate Khawaja Khawaja then ushered his teammate up the stairs and the heckler stopped his tirade against the rest of the players. It is the latest incident of poor fan behaviour in the Ashes series, which also saw several Lord's members suspended for abusing Aussie cricketers. During the second Ashes test, Australian cricketer Khawaja confronted and pointed out MCC members he wanted ejected from Lord's after their hostile behavior towards the Australian team. He was seen remonstrating with England fans in the Long Room and asked security to remove specific individuals who had reportedly booed and called the Aussies cheats. While that incident involved English supporters and Lord's members, there has been some suggestion the latest heckler may have been Australian. 'Sounds Aussie to me,' Barmy Army trumpet player Simon Finch posted. 'Bit of debate whether old mate is Pom or Aussie. Regardless, weird behaviour considering Aus are 2-1 up.' McCormick posted. 'Apologies if he is Aussie, point stands - They're not there to play t20 cricket for the crowds pleasure. 'Boring' is barely an insult but don't melt to water when called out.' Some cricket fans slammed the unknown heckler for failing to understand Test cricket. 'Another borish day tripper with no interest in cricket. Imagine going to watch some of the best players in the world at an elite sporting event and claiming you're bored. It's been another brilliant test. What do people want?' asked one fan. Khawaja was involved in another incident of poor fan behaviour when Lord's members ruthlessly abused the Aussie cricket players including chanting 'cheat' at them It has been a heated Ashes series on and off the pitch, with fans of both nations crossing the line on occasion The latest incident was triggered by slow over rates which have seen the English side - including retiring pace bowler Stuart Broad - fined on two occasions Others thought fans had every right to feel aggrieved because of constantly slow over rates during the Ashes series. 'He was right - going at 3 an over and a slow over-rate to grind the game to a halt is boring and a rip off,' another fan posted. 'Fans should be seeing 90 overs a day and they are getting short changed by 10+ overs a day when Australia are in the field. It's not as if it's an accident either.' Both Australia and England were docked 40 per cent of their match fee and penalised two World Test Championship points each for slow over rates in the first Test at Edgbaston. England players were then docked their entire match fee at Lord's for slow over rates.

Start your free trial now > Smith & Marsh hilariously troll Anderson | 00:33 ‘IT’S A MISTAKE’: MYSTERY AS ENGLAND QUICK DISAPPEARS Mark Wood has been England’s most destructive weapon with the ball this winter, but the paceman was nowhere to be seen at The Oval on Sunday morning. Australian openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja chipped away at the deficit before lunch on day four, but England captain Ben Stokes was seemingly reluctant to throw the Dukes ball to his fastest bowler. Injured off-spinner Moeen Ali and part-time Joe Root were each given a spell before the lunch break, which is understandable considering there were two left-handers at the crease — but the absence of Wood certainly raised eyebrows. A spectator at The Oval walked over to the press box early in the afternoon session and asked if the right-armer was injured. Speaking on Channel 9, former Australian batter Callum Ferguson suggested England was waiting for the Dukes ball to start reversing before introducing Wood to the attack. “You can see that England are employing an interesting strategy,” Ferguson said. “They’re holding back their fastest bowler, Mark Wood, in the hope they can get the ball reversing and target the stumps and try and blow a few away quickly of the Australian top order.” Former Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy continued: “I think it’s a mistake that Wood hasn’t bowled four overs with a brand-new ball.” Wood was seen talking with the team physio earlier on Sunday, raising suspicion the 33-year-old was nursing a minor niggle. However, he was on the field for the entire morning session, so an injury seemed unlikely. READ MORE Ashes vision of Alex Carey brutally rejecting Todd Murphy goes viral ‘What did you say?’: Aussie stars confront Ashes spectactor Speaking on Sky Sports, former England captain Nasser Hussain pointed out that the pitch and overhead conditions didn’t favour Wood’s bowling. “The pace has been sucked out of this pitch — there is no pace in it at all,” Hussain said. “The problem with holding Wood back is this weather. Reverse swing and rain aren’t really friends. When the ground gets wet, the ball gets wet and reverse swing disappears. “If it does reverse, England will go their Pakistan tactics with Wood and Stokes, who bowled before play today.” Wood was finally introduced in the 33rd over, immediately bringing the crowd back to life. His first delivery to Khawaja was edged through to the slips cordon, with the left-hander copping a blow to the helmet a couple of overs later. Wood found Khawaja’s outside edge twice in his third over before running off the field, fuelling speculation about a mystery injury. Mark Wood of England.

The veteran opener has expressed his desire to finish his red-ball career with a farewell Test at the SCG next summer — if selected. Despite a stellar performance in the Lord’s Test, Warner’s Ashes campaign has been underwhelming, albeit significantly improving from his previous England tour in 2019. He has developed a frustrating habit of making starts without converting them into fifties, including both innings of the recent Old Trafford Test. Nobody has passed 20 more often than Warner during this series, yet he hasn’t cracked the top ten leading run-scorers. However, Warner saved his best batting performance of the series for last, combining with Usman Khawaja for an unbeaten 135-run opening partnership at The Oval to set up a thrilling fifth day in London. Warner makes the most of wild delivery | 00:29 The New South Welshman’s footwork was dynamic on Sunday, shimmying down the pitch at England’s bowlers and looking to attack loose deliveries. Despite repeatedly picking the fielders, he still managed to reach his half-century in 90 deliveries. “We have seen plenty of energy,” Australian batting coach Micahel Di Venuto said at stumps. “So far in this innings he has looked really good, made some good decisions, and played really nicely.” Warner was unbeaten on 58 when rain halted his momentum — he was eyeing his highest Test score in the United Kingdom (85), which coincidentally occurred at the same venue in 2015. The 36-year-old, who will continue his final away Test innings on Monday, has not scored a Test hundred outside of Australia since September 2017. Australia opener David Warner. Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images If he can reach triple figures on Monday, it would be difficult for national selectors to drop him ahead of December’s series opener against Pakistan. If Australia wins this Test match, he’ll return home a national hero. “Warner knows that if he gets a hundred here, he will get his wish and bow out in Sydney next year,” former England captain Nasser Hussain said on Sky Sports. “Both he and Khawaja have played excellently. Khawaja has looked busy with his batting but also with his running between the wickets, which is what Warner likes.” KHAWAJA THE ANTI-BAZBALLER LEADS RUNS TALLY In what will be forever known as the Bazball Ashes, traditional Test cricket may prove to have the definitive say. Usman Khawaja has been the antithesis of England’s approach for most of the series — he’s been a thorn in the host’s side all winter, facing well over 1200 balls, which is 580 more than the next most (Marnus Labuschagne). “One of the themes of this summer has been seeing how well Khawaja plays the defensive shot,” commentator Daniel Norcross said on BBC Test Match Special . The Queenslander will end the series as the leading run-scorer from both sides, currently sitting on 493. In contrast to the clash of styles, Ben Stokes is the only England batter to have faced more than 600 balls in the series, while the second-leading run-scorer in the series, opener Zak Crawley, had faced 541 just deliveries. “Is there anyone less Bazball than Usman Khawaja?” Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath asked on BCC TMS . Usman Khawaja of Australia. Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: FOX SPORTS When Khawaja reached his half-century at The Oval, his third for the series to go with his century at Edgbaston, he became the 21st Australian cricketer to pass 5000 Test runs. Since his recall in January 2022, he’s made 2114 runs at 62.17 with seven centuries, the most of any Australian batter since. Khawaja has built his way with a calm, no-fuss approach to Test cricket, going along at his own pace. He came under fire in the first innings for failing to move the game forward, heaping extra pressure on his teammates. Noting the change of approach in the second innings, former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy was impressed with Khawaja’s added intent at the crease on Sunday. “He’s playing the way Usman Khawaja does,” Healy said on Channel 9. “He’s just doing it with a bit more hunt in his attitude. “When there is a half volley, he’s getting into the shot, looking to hurt it and not just field it into a gap. “When he’s at his best, he does that with a bit of finesse. He plays with nice soft hands in that moment, and he is able to switch to his guns and hit the ball hard when it’s there to hit.” ENGLAND’S FORTUNES CHANGE AFTER BALL CHANGE The Dukes ball wasn’t swinging for England’s seamers on Sunday morning — James Anderson, arguably the greatest swing bowler in history, couldn’t get it move, and neither could Chris Woakes. It allowed Australian openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner to survive the new-ball burst, with England turning to spin after just nine overs. After Khawaja copped a nasty blow to the helmet early in the 37th over, umpires decided to change the ball, which had apparently lost its shape after Mark Wood’s bumper. However, much to England’s delight, Wood’s first delivery with the fresh Dukes hooped into the left-handed Khawaja, which raised some eyebrows in the Sky Sports commentary box.

Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images Source: Getty Images “It certainly looks a lot newer than the one they changed from,” Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting remarked. “Look at how much writing is on the side of that ball.” Former Test opener Mark Taylor continued: “It really pinged off the bat. It even sounds harder.” Wood’s next delivery found Khawaja’s outside edge, with the ball racing towards third man for a boundary. Later in the same over, a leading edge narrowly evaded the point fielder. Only six further deliveries were bowled before the rain arrived in London, but England will feel confident their new Dukes pill can cause some damage on Monday morning.","pubDate":"2023-07-30 22:45:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","category":["sports"],"country":["australia"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SPORTS AGENDA: Everton's new stadium is far from completion after TWO YEARS of building work","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-12354279/SPORTS-AGENDA-Evertons-new-stadium-far-completion-TWO-YEARS-building-work.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"MIKE KEEGAN: There was some head scratching at Championship clubs last week when they received their teamsheet books ahead of the new season.","content":"SPORTS AGENDA: Everton's new stadium is far from completion after TWO YEARS of building work Pictures of Everton's new ground show it is far from done after two years of work They say the 53,000 seater stadium is due to open in the final months of 2024 England's Ashes stars were woken by a fire alarm before the final Ashes Test By Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail Updated: 23:00 BST, 30 July 2023 e-mail View comments There was some head scratching at Championship clubs last week when they received their teamsheet books ahead of the new season. As Mail Sport revealed, second-tier sides voted to increase the number of substitutes named in matchday squads from seven to nine, while their counterparts in Leagues One and Two remain with seven on the bench. However, when the paperwork turned up officials were surprised to find only seven spaces to fill in for subs, instead of nine. The EFL told them it was due to a printing error, leading one official to joke: ‘I wonder if they are going to fine themselves?’ Meanwhile, the EFL have outlined to clubs their stance on taking the knee. Any player who wishes to make the anti-racism gesture will be given the opportunity to do so by the referee. Everton's slow stadium build Pictures taken of Everton’s new stadium two years to the day work started show it remains some way from completion. The shots, taken by Daily Mail photographer Bruce Adams last Wednesday, illustrate what still appears to be a fairly skeletal structure. Everton say the 53,000-capacity venue, on the banks of the Mersey, should be open ‘in the final months of 2024’ but there are concerns they may have to remain at Goodison Park for another two seasons. By comparison, Tottenham’s new home opened three years after the project was signed off in 2016. Everton's new stadium appears to be far from complete after two years of building work IPL franchise eyeing Hundred investment The IPL’s Punjab Kings have held talks with Hundred franchise Birmingham Phoenix about potential investment. The prospect is intriguing given the status of the Hundred, which has split opinion. The competition faces challenges from abroad, not least from the US’s Major League Cricket. It is understood that officials are keen on securing external funding as they seek to make it a success. IPL franchise Punjab Kings have held talks with Hundred franchise Birmingham Phoenix over potential investment England's Ashes stars woken by fire alarm England’s cricketers suffered a rude awakening ahead of the final Test when a fire alarm sounded at their team hotel. Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow were enjoying breakfast when the siren went off at around 8.10am on Wednesday. They then had to leave immediately, while others emerged from their rooms bleary-eyed. Perhaps in a nod to his love of the sport, Stokes was spotted heading through the lobby with his precious golf clubs over a shoulder, while Bairstow stole a few extra minutes to finish his grub. It is thought a resident on the fourth floor inadvertently set the smoke alarm off while ironing.

But the club were bought last year by Canadian Bob Voulgaris, who made his millions betting on NBA basketball, and who intends to transform the club’s fortunes by applying his advanced data techniques. Voulgaris has enlisted the help of sports industry veteran Robin Taylor and Dave Reddin, who was part of England rugby’s World Cup-winning backroom team in 2003 and latterly a performance guru at the FA. Castellon missed out on promotion last season, losing the play-off final, but the drama was captured on film by TV production company Little Gem.

Lord Coe set for IOC presidency Lord Coe is a candidate to succeed Thomas Bach as IOC president in 2025. Coe will no doubt be watching the reaction to the IOC’s three-year suspension of Sheik ‘The Kingmaker’ Ahmad from any Olympic involvement. This followed his alleged interference in the recent Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) presidential elections while self-suspended after a forgery conviction in Switzerland. The OCA elections saw Ahmad’s brother, Sheik Talal, elected in a last-minute, four-vote swing amid widespread allegations of corruption and government interference. Well-informed Olympic watchers have said the IOC have taken advantage of the allegations to lock Kuwaiti Sheik Ahmad out as a candidate (or puppet master) in the upcoming IOC presidential election.

In an attempt to build morale, team drinks are being held on the last Thursday of every month.

Matt Richards, 20, won gold in the 200metres freestyle in a British one-two ahead of Tom Dean, then went on to win another gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay and a bronze in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay. The BBC opted not to televise the World Championships, which were only available to watch on the Eurovision Sports website. Richards’ dad, Simon, hit out at the broadcaster for failing to give the event any coverage on their flagship evening news programmes. In one of a series of punchy tweets directed at the BBC, Richards said: ‘Absolutely dreadful. Hang your heads in shame.’ The father of British swimmer Matt Richards has criticised the BBC for failing to cover the World Aquatics Championship Nottingham Forest promote Wendy Taylor Nottingham Forest have promoted Wendy Taylor, the club’s communications boss, to their board.

They kept Stuart Broad waiting for a farewell wicket after the England fast-bowling great made a shock announcement on Saturday that he was retiring following this match. Warner was 58 not out and fellow left-hander Khawaja unbeaten on 69 when rain at 14:41 stopped play on the fourth day. Australia need 249 more runs to complete a 3-1 series win and a first Ashes campaign triumph in England since 2001. If Australia do manage to reach that target, it will be the eighth-highest fourth-innings total to win any Test and the second-highest in England, behind Australia's 404/3 at Headingley in 1948 when Arthur Morris made 182 and batting great Don Bradman an unbeaten 173. It would also be a new ground record: the highest successful fourth-innings chase in a Test at The Oval is England's 263-9 against their arch-rivals in 1902. \"It was an outstanding start from our openers,\" Australia batting coach Michael Di Venuto told reporters after stumps. \"There's a lot of (Australian) guys who have been on Ashes series over here (England) in the past...We are in a great position, for some of those boys to get that on their resume. England batting coach Marcus Trescothick, however, insisted the hosts remained in confident mood. \"We're still pretty positive about the job we've got to do,\" he said. \"They (Australia) have had a good start with the bat, and seen off the new ball. \"A couple of early ones (wickets) in the morning and suddenly we're right in the mix again. Fast-medium bowler Broad has dismissed Warner 17 times in Test cricket. Neither he, nor the rest of England's pace attack were able to break through, however, before a persistent downpour cut short the day's play. Warner, 30 not out at lunch, lofted England veteran James Anderson, who turned 41 on Sunday, straight back over the paceman's head for a resounding boundary. Two balls later Anderson, struggling to produce swing, shook Warner up with an accidental head high full-toss, or beamer, the bowler immediately apologising as the ball sped away to the boundary. Khawaja, the leading run scorer in the series, went to fifty with his fifth four in 110 balls when he edged fast bowler Mark Wood. Warner, who by contrast has been struggling for runs, then followed him with a 90-ball fifty featuring seven fours. Australia, as the holders, have already retained the Ashes after arriving in London 2-1 up in the five-match series. Earlier, Broad was given a guard of honour as he made his way to the wicket for the final time, but England added just six runs to their overnight total of 389/9. The 37-year-old seamer is the fifth most successful bowler in Test history, with 602 wickets so far. \"I've had a love affair with the Ashes my whole life and the thought of being able to bowl my last ball and face my last ball against Australia fills me with joy,\" he said. Broad, whose highest Test score is 169, was batting with his long-time bowling partner Anderson. He faced the first over delivered by fellow paceman Mitchell Starc, with Broad pulling the sixth delivery for a towering six. But Anderson was leg before to off-spinner Todd Murphy in the second over as England were dismissed for 395.","pubDate":"2023-07-30 21:55:56","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SOUL OF SPORT: The Ashes ends today with England needing to win the fifth Test to draw the series...

For our latest episode of the series, ANDY HOOPER travelled to the Oval to capture the best of the action from England's fifth Ashes Test against Australia. It's been a particularly memorable Test as Stuart Broad announced his imminent retirement from cricket after a stellar 17-year career. Additionally, Australia reached 135 without loss on a rain-hit fourth day at the Oval - meaning they need another 249 runs to complete their second-highest run chase and seal a first series victory here since 2001. But, England are hoping their retiring fast bowler can produce one final match-winning spell to square the series at 2-2 before joining Sky Sports as a part of their coverage team for cricket.

It was an emotional day in south London, with the pair stepping out to receive rapturous applause from the crowd inside The KIA Oval and a guard of honour from Australia . As ever, Broad entertained in the middle of the wicket , smashing a huge six in what could be been the final ball he will ever face with the bat for England. His family, including partner Mollie , dad Chris and mum Carole were all in the stands watching on as Broad subsequently went out to lead the bowling attack for England after Anderson was dismissed by Todd Murphy for lbw. Former England batsman and father of the England bowler, Chris, spoke to Mail Sport's David Coverdale at The Oval on Sunday. Stuart Broad (pictured) announced on Saturday that he would be retiring from cricket ahead of the fourth day of the fifth Ashes Test match at the Oval Chris Broad (right) has been speaking with Mail Online's David Coverdale and says he believes it 'was a brave decision for Stuart (left) to retire' Broad was given a guard of honour by the Australian side as he and his bowling partner James Anderson walked out on to the pitch to finish England's second innings at The Oval We have obviously known that Stuart's career was coming to an end. At 37, how much longer can you go on? So Stuart and I had spoken about this for a while. At the start of the season, he was thinking this was going to be his last series. But once the series started, he was enjoying it so much that he was unsure. I think he acknowledged that in his interviews on Saturday night, when he admitted he only made the decision at 8.30pm on Friday. We found out at eight o'clock on Saturday morning when he phoned us to tell us that he was going to announce that this was his last game. Because we had already talked about it, it wasn't that emotional for me. I just thought it was sensible. When you think about it, it is absolutely the right thing. That is easy for me to say, but for him as well, he just feels that he is doing the right thing at the right time. It's a brave decision when you are still fit enough to play. But he has got to feel in his gut what the right thing to do is, and he has made that decision and I think it is the brave and correct one . He loves the occasion and there is no bigger occasion than an Ashes match in England for him to be able to say goodbye. It is brilliant. I think he would have loved to have ended at Trent Bridge if there was a Test match there. But to end here at the Oval, in front of a full house, is very fitting. He actually grew into English cricket here in 2009 when he got five wickets against Australia. That was when he realised he had a future in the England cricket team. Broad said in a column with Mail Sport that he was 'retiring at the very top of his game' His mother Carloe (left) spoke with BBC Test Match Special reporter Jonathan Agnew at The Oval today and said that now was the perfect time for her son to retire The guard of honour the Australians gave him was lovely. There have been a lot of battles between England and Australian cricketers over the years, but there is such a camaraderie. I still see some of the Australians that I played against in the 1980s and we always have a chat and talk about what has been going on. That sort of thing will continue with Stuart. To have that respect and understanding from the opposition at this time when he has decided to retire is an amazing thing. I am sure he will be very grateful to the Australians for doing that. The round of applause he got at the start of the game, and when he came out to field, and when he went out to the boundary to chase one, was just brilliant. And it was appropriate that his batting ended with him hitting a six - and it was a good six as well. He acknowledged us sitting up here and I think he is soaking up everything he possibly can in these last couple of days. It is great because those memories will stay with him forever. It will be sad if we don't get a result of some sort at the end of this game and it ends up being a damp squib. Broad (pictured) would step out into the middle of the field and smash a six with what could be his final ball in an England Test match Broad (middle) would go on to lead the bowling for England on Sunday but the home side struggled to remove David Warner (right) and Usman Khawaja Earlier in the series, Broad (middle left) amassed his 600th Test wicket for England, putting him behind Anderson as second in England's all-time Test wicket takers tally from 167 matches Stuart has had an extraordinary career. He wanted to get to 100 Test matches, but to get 67 Test matches over that, and still be bowling as well as he has always bowled, perhaps even better than he has bowled, is just amazing. It is testament to his physical fitness and the set-up of the England cricket side that both he and Jimmy Anderson have been able to go on as long as they have done, when so many other bowlers have fallen down the wayside because of injury. Jimmy is carrying on amazingly for 41. Those two are just extraordinary animals, they really are. Commentating is a different animal altogether. I tried that when I finished playing. You've got to know your facts. There are some good commentators around. You have to learn fairly quickly on the job. But I am sure he will be given every opportunity to learn the process. They don't have a bowler on Sky's commentary team now, so they need one to give a bowler's perspective, which is great.

James Anderson , his great mate and the other half of the best bowling partnership in England’s history, stood next to him. A football bobbed about between the men, bouncing off the tops of their thighs and their heads and the insteps of their cricket boots. Full-scale football matches as part of their warm-up were banned some time ago because they were getting too feisty so now they make do with this game called PIG. Three mistakes, three lapses of control, from one person and he gets flicked around the head by the other players. Broad used to be the chairman of the warm-up game but on Saturday morning, he passed that honour on to Ben Duckett. It was part of moving on. It was part of saying goodbye. And so, under the upturned rim of his blue bucket hat, Broad grinned as he played and he and Anderson took great delight in flicking the forehead of Josh Tongue when he completed his trio of errors. Broad left the game early and ran up the stairs to the changing room to pad up for the last time before he retires. A few minutes before 11am, Pat Cummins led the Australian players out on the pitch and they milled around by the boundary. They had decided to form a guard of honour for Broad when he and Anderson walked out to resume their last-wicket stand. They looked a little awkward about it. They had a Test match to win. Stuart Broad will retire upon the conclusion of the final Ashes Test following a 17-year career Broad and James Anderson will bowl together for the last time on Monday during the final Ashes Test But they parted into two lines and waited for Broad to appear and, eventually, after the strains of Jerusalem rang around the ground, Broad and Anderson came down the steps, too. Broad took his helmet off and ran his fingers through his hair as he walked towards the Australians. He and Anderson paused for a second and Broad put his arm around his mate. The photographers captured that moment from behind, England’s No 8 and England’s No 9 frozen together in time, our greatest bowlers inseparable, just as they always seem to have been inseparable. Broad walked forward through the guard of honour. The capacity crowd at this ground, which has seen so many emotional departures down the years, roared and cheered. The Australians applauded him, even David Warner, who may have been wondering whether he was about to fall victim to Broad for the 18th time in his career. Broad has been their implacable foe for 16 years. He has taken more Australian wickets in Ashes Tests than any other English bowler. He has been a thorn in their side. He has delighted in their discomfort. He has taken their brickbats. He famously refused to walk that time at Trent Bridge. And yet they applauded him. And they meant it. And it was hard not to wonder in that moment whether that is what Broad will miss the most when he has gone: the camaraderie of competition between elite athletes, the friendship that comes with rivalry, the joy of playing elite professional sport with your friends, the adrenaline of being in the arena. Anderson hung back and as the Aussies broke their lines, they teased him and laughed with him and made a show of ushering him through the guard of honour, too. Perhaps they would like to hasten his goodbye, too, but Anderson is not for leaving yet. And he is certainly not one for stealing his mate’s limelight. He waited until Cummins and the rest were dispersing and only then did he walk forward. Broad has taken more Australian wickets in Ashes Tests than any other English bowler, a thorn in their side for the last 16 years It feels so strange to think that we will not see these two bowling again after Monday. They have been a fixture of our cricketing lives for so long, twinned in our minds and in the history books, Anderson third in the list of all-time Test wicket takers on 690 and Broad fifth on 602. We will never see a partnership like theirs again. Broad’s reward for this outpouring of emotion and affection and respect was to face Mitchell Starc, Australia’s top wicket-taker in this series, in the first over of the day. Broad blocked the first ball safely and took ineffective swings at a couple of others. Starc dug the last ball of the over in short and Broad stepped back away from the stumps and swatted the ball away high in the air in the direction of Archbishop Tenison’s School. It sailed and sailed through the air, sucked towards the stands in the same way Bill Shankly said the Kop used to suck footballs towards the goal at Anfield, and cleared the ropes. It is astonishing how often sport does this, how often great sportsmen summon endings like this. Anderson was out the next over and so Broad’s last shot in Test cricket was a six against Australia. It was his 55th Test six, by the way. Only Ben Stokes, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and Ian Botham have scored more for England. It is a wrong-headed comparison, perhaps, but it was hard not to think of another famous ending at this ground, when Don Bradman walked out here in August 1948 needing only four runs in his last innings to achieve an average of 100. Bradman was bowled second ball by leg spinner Eric Hollies for a duck and his average was stuck on 99.94 for the rest of time. Not all final appearances with bat in hand come to such an auspicious close as Broad’s did yesterday. What Broad really wanted, of course, was to replicate that farewell with the ball in his hand. As he ran off to get ready to lead England’s attack, the big screens on either side of the ground played a montage of some of his greatest moments in Ashes Tests. It was not a short film. It was still running when Broad came back out on to the pitch, his white headband tied around his hair, and as he loosened up, the screens took him and us back to his youth. They showed pictures of him dismissing Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke and Steve Smith and, of course, Warner. Anderson is third in the list of all-time Test wicket takers on 690 and Broad is fifth on 602 They showed him celebrating with Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell and Matt Prior, players who have long left the competitive arena. They reminded us of Broad’s longevity and the place he has in the hearts of England cricket supporters everywhere. The fairytale part of Broad’s day stalled there. Sport is not all final-ball sixes and pats on the back. Broad knows that as well as anyone. And so, in this innings of all innings, Warner refused resolutely to play the role of Broad’s bunny. In this innings of all innings, Warner looked more comfortable against Broad than he has ever looked. Warner played superbly. Usman Khawaja batted beautifully, too. In this innings of all innings, they compiled their highest opening stand of the entire series, comfortably surpassing the 73 that was their previous best. Khawaja also moved beyond Zak Crawley as the series’ leading run-scorer. Broad bowled well. He bowled six overs and two maidens for 15 runs but could not prise a wicket out of the new-found stubbornness of the Australians, who reached 135 without loss and, in the process, raised the spectre of a spectacular fourth-innings run chase. And then the rains came. And Broad’s penultimate day ended with the sight of covers that gleamed with rain and hoods and umbrellas and dark clouds scudding across a forbidding sky. He gets one more day of his cricketing life. One more day to bring the crowd to its feet, one more day to bound in from the top of his run with the wind in his hair, one more day to send an Australian batsman’s stump cartwheeling along the turf, one more day to chase a ball in the field and feel his sunhat flying off his head, one more day to wind up the Aussies, one more day to get Warner, one more day to love this part of his life that playing cricket has given him, one more day to try to do, for the last time, what he has done so many times before.

Stuart Broad took centre stage in the morning after he announced his retirement from cricket on Saturday evening, with players and fans applauding him. James Anderson was dismissed by Todd Murphy for lbw, with Australia coming out to bat. England then took to the field with Broad and Anderson leading the attack, but they could not dismiss Australian openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner . Both players would advance to make their half-centuries, and form a partnership of 135 before heavy rain wiped out play. Australia require another 249 runs to win the Ashes. Mail Sport's LAWRENCE BOOTH takes a look at the big stats of the day. Australia sit 135-0 in pursuit of 384 after day four of the fifth Ashes Test on Sunday Play was abandoned at The Oval when the rain got heavy shortly into the afternoon session Broad bowing out in style Stuart Broad became only the second player – after West Indian Wayne Daniel – known to have hit his final ball in Test cricket for six when he launched Mitchell Starc high over midwicket. Australia’s Glenn Maxwell also hit the last ball he faced in Tests, against Bangladesh six years ago, over the fence, but he has not yet retired. Stuart Broad became only the second player to have hit his final ball in Test cricket for six Tourists' bowlers take a hit Australia’s seamers have all taken a pummelling in this series, with captain Pat Cummins’s economy-rate of 4.27 the cheapest. The most expensive has been all-rounder Cameron Green’s eye-watering 5.14. Khawaja overtakes Crawley When Usman Khawaja moved to 59 with a cut for four off Joe Root, he overtook Zak Crawley’s total of 480 to become the leading run-scorer in the series – though he had taken 1,246 balls to Crawley’s 548. Usman Khawaja (L) overtook Zak Crawley to become the leading run-scorer in the series Anderson's figures Jimmy Anderson’s figures of none for 34 took his series analysis to five wicket at 81 each.
