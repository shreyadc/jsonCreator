New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >The 28-year-old batting superstar had reached double figures just once previously in the tournament, however Hayden knew from experience he was about to turn it all around.Drawing on his memory of former teammate Adam Gilchrist and his own form fluctuations with the bat, Hayden declared the timing was right for the world to see ‘fireworks’ from Azam.“If I can take your minds way back to a different World Cup, the 2007 World Cup, and Adam Gilchrist had by his standards a very lean World Cup,” Hayden said on Tuesday.“And if you remember that last match against Sri Lanka, he went on to score an incredible 100, don’t be surprised whatsoever if you see some fireworks (from Babar), because very special players don’t stay down for long. Cricket: Pakistan consultant Matthew Hayden expects star batsman Babar Azam to reclaim his best form with an Adam Gilchrist type innings when Pakistan face New Zealand in the semi-final.“Look out the rest of the world because I think you’re about to see something very special from Babar.”Hayden also revealed his coaching mindset was to stick with players going through rough patches of form as they’d always improve as a result.“There’s no question that Babar has been under some adversity. That will only make him an even greater player,” Hayden said.“As we all know about the weather, once there’s a lull, there’s often a storm that follows. So look out, rest of the world, because I think you’re about to see something very special from Babar.”Just one day later Hayden’s unwavering faith in Azam was rewarded as the opener blasted 53 off 42 against the Kiwis to lead Pakistan’s successful run chase and propel the side to the World Cup final.Azam and Rizwan (57 off 43 balls) brought up their eighth T20I century partnership in the 12th over, doubling the tally for the next best pairing in world cricket.The Pakistan skipper’s onslaught came to a halt in the 13th over, caught at the long-on boundary off Trent Boult’s bowling for 53 – but the damage had been done.Soon after young gun Mohammad Haris steered the Pakistanis home with five balls to spare.For Pakistani fans back home, Hayden’s coaching masterclass was once again one of the highlights of the match, with many taking to social media to laud the Aussie great for his leadership and class.“Tonight was very special,” Pakistan batting coach Matthew Hayden said after the match.“Everyone will talk about Babar and Rizwan, but that bowling attack did an unbelievable job.“Sky is the limit and both of these guys have done it for Pakistan for a number of years.”Hayden also praised Azam in another stirring dressing room speech following Wednesday night’s victory, as you can see in the video below.Pakistan will face either England or India in the T20 World Cup final at the SCG on Sunday evening, with the first ball scheduled for 7pm AEDT.Most century opening partnerships in men‘s T20Is8 – Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan (PAK)4 – Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma (IND)4 – Aaron Finch, David Warner (AUS)4 – KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma (IND)- With Nic Savage","pubDate":"2022-11-09 22:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Melbourne weather predicted to spoil T20 World Cup final","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/cricket-melbourne-weather-predicted-to-spoil-t20-world-cup-final/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"La Nina strikes again. The highly-anticipated T20 World Cup final is under threat, with Melbourne predicted to be peppered by rain on Sunday evening. Pakistan await the winner of the second semifinal between England and India after a comprehensive win over the Black Caps last night. Three T20 World Cup matches at the iconic MCG have already been abandoned due to weather, while Ireland clinched an unexpected victory over England after rain prematurely ended their Super 12 contest. Rain also denied host nation Australia the opportunity to face rivals England in a must-win fixture at the MCG, effectively knocking the defending champions out of the tournament. And now the final is in jeopardy, with the Bureau of Meteorology predicting a 95 per cent chance of showers (8 to 20 mm) peppering the Victorian capital on Sunday. More than 90,000 spectators are expected to walk through gates on Sunday, but that figure could drop considerably if weather intervenes. Unlike the group stage fixtures, the T20 World Cup knock-out matches are allocated a reserve day, with the final’s backup slot scheduled for 3pm on Monday afternoon with an additional two hours allocated to get the match complete if there are rain interruptions. But much to everyone’s frustration, the Monday forecast isn’t particularly promising either, with the Bureau predicting a 95 per cent chance of showers (5 to 10 mm). “Every effort will be made to complete the match on the scheduled day,” the T20 World Cup playing conditions state. “Only if the minimum number of overs necessary to constitute a match cannot be bowled on the scheduled day will the match be completed on the reserve day.” If the final is washed out, the trophy will be shared between the two finalists. According to The Age, T20 World Cup organisers will not shift the start time to favourable weather conditions due to the preferences of global broadcasters. While group stage matches only required five overs in the second innings to constitute a result, at least 10 overs will need to be bowled in the run chase during the final. Earlier this year, the Bureau confirmed that climate driver La Nina had once again returned for the 2022/23 summer, and its effects are already noticeable on the east coast with severe flooding in New South Wales and Victoria. “Typically with La Nina, it leads to extra cloud cover and extra rainfall through eastern, northern and central Australia,” Sky News meteorologist Rob Sharpe told news.com.au last year. “It also leads to generally near or below average temperatures in those regions. “Particularly for the matches in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, there’s a higher chance than usual of rainfall, so a higher chance of games potentially being washed out.” Andrew Watkins, the Bureau of Meteorology’s head of long-range forecasting, warned that La Nina would strike the east coast earlier than usual this summer, much to the frustration of T20 World Cup organisers. “At the moment, this La Nina isn’t looking particularly strong and it’s looking like it will peak probably fairly early in the summer or late in the spring,” Watkins told ABC last month. “Which is a little bit unusual, a little bit different to the La Ninas that we’ve been seeing in recent years.” The rare climate phenomenon has occurred in Australia 16 times over the past 122 years.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-11-09 21:54:20","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/mxtd1vnz/melbourne-cricket-ground-rain-photosport.jpg","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"DPS Srinagar students shines in various sporting events","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/11/10/dps-srinagar-students-shines-in-various-sporting-events/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"SRINAGAR: Saira Zahoor has won the Gold Medal in the Senior Category in the J&K UT Level Thang Ta Championship 2022.

SYDNEY, Nov 9, (AP): Half-centuries from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan helped Pakistan beat New Zealand in dominant fashion to book their place in the T20 World Cup final. Rizwan scored 57 runs and Azam added 53 as Pakistan made easy work of a 153-run chase on a placid Sydney wicket. They finished with 153-3 in 19.1 overs. That came after Shaheen Afridi took 2-24 to help restrict New Zealand to a sub-par 152-4 from its 20 overs. Pakistan await the winners of Thursday’s semifinal between India and England in Adelaide. The final will be played in Melbourne on Sunday. “Luckily the half-century came in the semifinal. It was a tricky pitch,” Rizwan, who was named player of the match, said. “We decided to attack against the new ball. Our start to the tournament wasn’t good, but we kept believing.” Opting to bat after winning the toss, New Zealand got off to a poor but eventful start. Finn Allen hit a boundary off the first ball and survived a close legbefore- wicket shout off the second via review. He was then immediately out lbw off the next delivery. New Zealand captain Kane Williamson and Devon Conway (21) put on 34 runs for the second wicket before the latter was run out at the end of a powerplay. The Black Caps were then reduced to 49-3 in eight overs as Mohammad Nawaz sent back Glenn Phillips (6). Williamson scored 46 off 42 balls, including a four and a six, and anchored the New Zealand innings. He put on 68 runs off 50 balls with Daryl Mitchell for the fourth wicket. Afridi returned to dismiss Williamson in the 17th overs. Mitchell hit three fours and a six in completing his half-century off 32 balls. Pakistan’s excellent ground fielding and the wicket’s slow nature then denied New Zealand the chance to launch any type of attack in the final overs. In reply, Azam and Rizwan belied their poor form to put on a century stand for the first wicket. They scored 50 off 34 balls and reached 100 off 70 deliveries. In all, they put on 105 runs off 76 balls to set Pakistan on course for an easy win. Azam was out shortly after reaching his half-century off 38 balls. Meanwhile, Rizwan scored 50 off 36 balls before being dismissed in the 17th over. By then only 21 runs were needed off 18 balls and Pakiston closed it out with five balls to spare, as Mohammad Haris finished with 30 from 26 balls. This post has been read 560 times!

I said, ‘come on mate, you’ve got to come as well,’ and he said, “Oh, come on, what happens if we lose a couple of wickets?’“I had to drag him off.”Mott’s coaching portfolio includes a title winning stint with NSW, a successful tenure as Australian women’s coach and he was also an assistant with John Buchanan at the Kolkata Knight Riders during the first season of the Indian Premier League.“He (Mott) has a lot of factors about him which are suited to coaching,’’ Buchanan said.“He’s a laid-back person and very good with relationships is very inquisitive and had a good sense of humour. He is pretty unflappable. That was the way he played his cricket.“Obviously he and Roy (Symonds) came through together. They were great mates and he would be one of the first to have a go at Roy about his spelling and how he would somehow get an “l’ when he was spelling chimney. That was part of their friendship.“They were different characters in some ways but also similar in that they were Gold Coast boys and very laid back.“Their fathers were both school principals and Matt’s father Bill used to help as a room attendant with the Bulls.’’ENGLAND SET FOR TOUGH CALLS ON TWO KEY PLAYERS AFP England will make last-minute fitness calls on Dawid Malan and Mark Wood as they look to spoil the party in Thursday’s Twenty20 World Cup semi-final against India, skipper Jos Buttler said.The world’s two top-ranked teams will clash at the Adelaide Oval for a place in Sunday’s final at the MCG against Pakistan or New Zealand.England are sweating on the availability of number three batsman Malan and pace spearhead Wood.Wood has bowled the fastest ball of the tournament at 154.74kph. “We will see how they pull up. We are trying to give them as long as possible,” Buttler said on Wednesday.“Dawid was out the other day with a small niggle, Woody has had a bit of stiffness. We trust the medical team, we trust the two guys as well.” Malan looks doubtful after he injured his groin in England’s final Super 12 match against Sri Lanka and could be replaced by Phil Salt.Buttler, who plays with hard-hitting Salt at county side Lancashire, backed him to take his chance if it comes against India.“I think he has a fantastic mindset, especially for the T20 format, he certainly doesn’t fear anyone and is someone who wants to get on the front foot and take the game on,” said Buttler.“He embodies quite a lot of what we speak about as a team and how we ask guys to play.“Certainly I wouldn’t expect to see anything else from him if he gets the chance to play.“He’s certainly someone who’s not going to shy away from an occasion, I feel like he’s someone who will definitely take it on.” Buttler knows that an India side which has batsmen Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav in sparkling form will have strong backing in Adelaide, as they have done throughout the World Cup.“We are all really excited about the match, in my opinion one of the best stadiums in the world against a brilliant Indian team which I am sure will be well supported tomorrow,” Buttler said.“It’s going to be a great occasion and these are the times you want to be involved as a player.” Buttler also knows that those Indian fans will be hoping for victory to set up a blockbuster final against arch-rivals Pakistan.“We certainly don’t want an India-Pakistan final,” added the batsman-wicketkeeper, who took over the England white-ball captaincy earlier this year from Eoin Morgan.“So trying to do what we can to make sure that it doesn’t happen.”","pubDate":"2022-11-09 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Introducing the new Wallabies captain who loves KFC","link":"https://www.watoday.com.au/sport/rugby-union/introducing-the-new-wallabies-captain-who-loves-kfc-20221109-p5bwnf.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Tom Decent"],"video_url":null,"description":"In 1994, Vili Alaalatoa named his son after Australian cricket great Allan Border.

We’re not scared to lose. Yet we picked an aggressive 11 in this World Cup squad yet played so defensively. Very un-Australian.” My eyes, as yours, are drawn to that final phrase, “Very un-Australian”. And of course it’s easy to jeer at the very idea that there is an “un-Australian” way to play, that there is any such thing as Australian exceptionalism, but I like it. And I particularly like the concept in reverse. Look, just what is Australian in sport is not easy to define but, like the US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart who in 1964 said: “I don’t know how to define obscenity, but I know it when I see it,” I’ve always fancied I know Australianness when I see it. And when it comes to cricket, the examples are myriad. The obvious starting point is Yabba, an actual Redfern rabbitoh who made his fame at the game as the great barracker on the SCG Hill in the 1920s and 30s, and was the one who gave Australianness its most famous cry: “’ave a go, ya Mug!” A monument to heckling: \"Yabba\" at the SCG.

An inspired bowling performance from Shaheen Shah Afridi and a timely masterclass from captain Babar Azam helped Pakistan topple New Zealand by seven wickets at the SCG on Thursday evening, qualifying for the T20 World Cup final for the first time in 13 years. “I thought New Zealand was a little bit timid, to be honest,” former Australian batter Callum Ferguson said on Channel 9. “They were timid and they’ve been punished tonight by a Pakistan side that has serious momentum now, they are looking every bit the champions.” Twelve days ago, Pakistan’s campaign was in tatters. Following an unforgettable defeat against sub-continent rivals India at the MCG and a debilitating one-run loss to Zimbabwe in Perth, their chances of qualifying for the semi-finals were close to zero. But the Pakistanis were gifted a reprieve when the Netherlands stunned South Africa in Adelaide on Sunday afternoon, an unforeseeable result that effectively made their final group stage match against Bangladesh a quarter-final. And three days later, the men in green have booked their spot in the tournament finale. Rapturous Pakistani fans danced, chanted and drummed outside the SCG gates before the toss, while Central Station’s light rail station was crammed with South Asian cricket supporters. The semifinal started in dramatic circumstances, with Pakistan paceman Afridi trapping Black Caps opener Finn Allen on the pads with his third delivery of the evening, only for the decision to be overturned after DRS replays showed an inside edge. But the left-hander produced a replica the following delivery, with his hooping in-swinger slapping into Allen’s front pad and prompting chants of “Afridi” around the venue – a review couldn’t save the Kiwi on this occasion. “He set the tone,” Azam said of Afridi after the match. “Now everyone knows he’s the best bowler in Pakistan – and the world.” A huge turning point came at the end of the Powerplay when Pakistan all-rounder Shadab Khan nailed a direct hit from mid-off to send Black Caps opener Devon Conway packing for 21. New Zealand was suddenly in a spot of bother at 3/49 when the dangerous Glenn Phillips, who scored a century at the SCG last month, chipped a return catch to spinner Mohammad Nawaz in the eighth over. The Kiwis only mustered 59 runs on the worn SCG deck before the drinks break with skipper Kane Williamson steadying the ship in the middle overs. Williamson and Daryl Mitchell revived the innings, combining for a 68-run partnership for the fourth wicket before Shah (2/24 from four overs) knocked over the New Zealand captain in the 17th over. Ish Sodhi and the Black Caps were outplayed by Pakistan. Photo / AP Mitchell (53 not out off 35 balls) brought up his third T20I fifty in the penultimate over, reaching the minor milestone in just 32 deliveries as the Kiwis registered a defendable, but underwhelming 152/4. Pakistan captain Babar Azam and opening partner Mohammad Rizwan got the run chase off to an explosive start, smacking 55 runs during the Powerplay to send a scare through the New Zealand camp. Azam, who has endured an uncharacteristically poor run of form during this tournament, and Rizwan proved why they’re considered the most intimidating opening partnership in world cricket, repeatedly finding gaps in the offside before lofting into open space at deep mid-wicket. Every boundary was met with ear-piercing roars from the crowd, with countless Pakistan flags emerging from the vibrant sea of green. At one point in the run chase, Rizwan was forced to ask a Pakistan supporter to stop waving his flag behind the bowler’s arm at the northern end. The introduction of spin in the seventh over stemmed the flow of runs, but New Zealand tweakers Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi couldn’t unearth a much-needed breakthrough. As the required net run rate continued to drop after the drinks break, New Zealand’s bowling and fielding dipped in quality as well. Azam (53 off 42 balls) and Rizwan (57 off 43 balls) brought up their eighth T20I century partnership in the 12th over, doubling the tally for the next best pairing in world cricket. The Pakistan skipper’s onslaught came to a halt in the 13th over, caught at the long-on boundary off Trent Boult’s bowling for 53 – but the damage had been done. Countless Kiwi heads dropped when Santner put down a chance at point in the 16th over, all but sealing New Zealand’s fate. Boult snared the prized wicket of Rizwan in the 17th over, albeit with a waist-high full toss, but young gun Mohammad Haris steered the Pakistanis home with five balls to spare. Tonight was very special,” Pakistan batting coach Matthew Hayden said after the match. “Everyone will talk about Babar and Rizwan, but that bowling attack did an unbelievable job. “Sky is the limit and both of these guys have done it for Pakistan for a number of years.” Meanwhile, New Zealand has for a fifth consecutive World Cup qualified for the finals without lifting the trophy. “We’ve played in a number of different finals and put out really good performances – probably good enough to win and either got met by a side that played a little bit better or played about equal,” Williamson told reporters in the post-match press conference. “You accept some of those things. The frustrating part about today is that we weren’t quite on top of our game.” “There will be some reflection. It’s still raw. You’ve got to use these lessons to get better as a side and as an individual.” Pakistan will face either England or India in the T20 World Cup final at the SCG on Sunday evening, with the first ball scheduled for 9pm NZT.","content":"A former Australian international has labeled the Black Caps’ semifinal effort as ‘timid’ in the wake of their ‘frustrating’ defeat to Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground last night.

For Buttler, who saw plenty of Yadav before he became a fixture for India, the hallmark of his extraordinary array of shots - legitimately capable of finding boundaries in the full 360 degree range - is not the technique behind them but the attitude.

I think he’s obviously got all the shots, but he allows himself to play all the shots, as well. He’s got a very free mindset from what I can see.” To India’s captain Rohit Sharma, Yadav has been the injection of fearlessness and batting range that the team needed to improve upon an underwhelming World Cup campaign last year, when he was still a very new addition to the side.

ANI Pakistan's skipper Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan A resurgent Pakistan declared Wednesday “the sky’s the limit” as captain Babar Azam rediscovered his form to help power them past New Zealand in Sydney and into a Twenty 20 World Cup final against either India or England. Azam and Mohammad Rizwan got off to a flying start in pursuit of 153, putting on a 105-run opening stand in 12.4 overs to set up victory and a place in Sunday’s showpiece at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. If Azam had been under pressure after making just 39 runs in the tournament’s Super 12 stage, he did not show it, reaching his fifty off 38 balls in front of 36,443 strongly pro-Pakistan spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Rizwan’s half-century followed, off 32 balls and they went on to become the first opening pair to post three century stands in T20 World Cup history before Azam fell for 53 off 42 balls. Pakistan’s seven-wicket win capped a remarkable comeback from the 2009 T20 World Cup winners who had been on the brink of elimination after last-ball defeats to India and Zimbabwe in their first two matches. “I don’t think we have seen our best yet, which is probably the scarier part for whoever faces us,” said former Australia opening batsman Matthew Hayden, who has been a mentor to the team. “Sky’s the limit. You can never beat down class.” Pakistan’s bowlers set the tone after Azam lost the toss. Aided by some razor sharp fielding they kept New Zealand to a below par 152/4.

[…] The post T20 World Cup 2022: Important not to get ahead of ourselves: Rohit Sharma appeared first on Northlines.","content":"Agencies Adelaide, Nov 9: On the eve of their semifinal clash against England in the Men’s T20 World Cup, India skipper Rohit Sharma insisted that it is important for his side not to get too thinking about what would happen in future and stick to the processes which propelled them to get to the knockouts. India entered the semifinals as the toppers from Group 2 in Super 12s and will meet England in a knockout match of the T20 World Cups for the first time at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. “It’s important not to get ahead of ourselves and we do understand as well that we have to play good cricket to win that game, which we have done in this tournament. We just need to stick to it,” said Rohit in the pre-match press conference. Though Rohit acknowledged that India are two steps away from ending a nine-year wait for a World Cup trophy, he added that India would stick to what had worked for them in the tournament till now. “It’s an opportunity for us to come and do that (get the silverware). But we do understand it’s been a long process for us and we will stick to our process. “I know we are (a) long way away from it (winning the trophy). But I think it’s important to understand that it’s a contest between bat and ball, which we have to come out on top with and trust what you have been doing so far.” On Tuesday, India had a mini-scare when Rohit was hit on the forearm while batting in the optional practice session. He looked in pain and received immediate medical attention, forcing him to stop batting for around 45 minutes. But by the time the nets session ended, Rohit was back to decently batting in the nets. Talking about the blow in the nets, Rohit said he was fine to play in the semifinal. “Yes, I was hit yesterday. It seems to be fine now. There was a little bruising and it’s absolutely fine now.” India had met England in a three-match away bilateral series in July, where Rohit & Co emerged victorious by 2-1. The right- handed opener felt that the previous series win over their semifinal opponents earlier in the year would give Indian team a huge confidence, but was quick to remind that Thursday’s match would be a fresh start for the team as bearings of the past wouldn’t matter much. “Certainly, going into the game, it will give us some confidence because beating a team like England in England, it’s a big challenge and we overcame that challenge pretty well. But again we do understand the dynamics of the T20 game. You just have to be good on that particular day, otherwise it’s not good enough. Certainly, the guys will have some confidence going into tomorrow’s game. “Also, a lot of the guys who have played in that series, are not part of this team and a lot of people in the team right now didn’t play in that series. For us in the back of our mind, we can have that confidence knowing that we did pretty well against them. “But tomorrow’s game is going to be a fresh game. We have to be good on that day in terms of skills and need to be better than them to come out on top. All those records of the past, I don’t think it’s going to matter too much. “It’s just that you can carry that confidence with you. But again, we need to start fresh and think about tomorrow with fresh mind. We can’t go into the game thinking that we have beaten this team and it can happen again just like that. “We do need to play well to win the game because these guys (England) are quite dangerous and have played some really good cricket in the tournament as well, which is why they are here. We got to be at our best to win the game.”","pubDate":"2022-11-09 17:16:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenorthlines","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli and the last two T20 World Cup semi-finals","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/virat-kohli-and-the-last-two-t20-world-cup-semi-finals/","keywords":["Sports","Cricket","India","T20 WC","T20 World Cup.","Virat Kohli"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chennai: In the ongoing T20 World Cup series, India and England cricket teams will play the semi-final match tomorrow (Thursday).

Hailed as the run machine of today’s cricket, Virat Kohli has a habit of performing tremendously in knock-out matches. Kohli has played in the semi-finals twice before in T20 World Cup history. In both of those matches, he was a not-out batsman with impressive half-centuries. 2014 – Scored 72 off 44 balls against South Africa. 2016 – Scored 89 off 47 balls against West Indies. However, Kohli is expected to continue his run chase against England in tomorrow’s match. It will surely help the Indian team to win.

They will meet either England or India-who play on Thursday in Adelaide-in the November 13 decider at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Pakistan set the tone at the Sydney Cricket Ground with some razor sharp fielding and disciplined bowling that restricted New Zealand to just 152-4. In front of 36,443 strongly pro-Pakistan spectators, Rizwan (57) and Azam (53) took apart the Black Caps’ renowned bowling attack in a 105-run opening stand, and despite a nervous finish after both fell, they completed a deserved victory with five balls to spare. Pakistan last claimed the title in 2009 at Lord’s in England when they beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets, and it has been a rollercoaster ride in Australia to make another final. After agonizing last-ball losses to India and Zimbabwe in the group phase, they bounced back to topple the Netherlands and South Africa. Then against the odds they went through when the Proteas were stunned by the Dutch and Pakistan eased past Bangladesh. New Zealand, who topped Group 1, were aiming to make the final for the second consecutive time, but their hunt for a maiden T20 title again fell short. Teams batting first had won five from six games played in Sydney this tournament and when Kane Williamson won the toss he had no hesitation in asking Pakistan to bowl, but it proved to be tough going. In an eventful opening over, Finn Allen hit Shaheen Afridi for four off the first delivery then was given out the next ball lbw. It was overturned on review because of an inside edge only for Afridi to promptly do the same again and this time it was plumb. Devon Conway and Williamson steadied the ship but some fine fielding restricted them in the six-over powerplay, where only two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. It included the spectacular run out of Conway for 21 by Shadab Khan, who scored a direct hit from mid-off. They suffered another big blow when danger man Glenn Phillips was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz for six. Daryl Mitchell and Williamson began taking more risks after the 10-over mark with the first six coming in the 13th over. Williamson was undone on 46 by an Afridi yorker after a knock that yielded only two boundaries before Mitchell, unbeaten on 53, and Jimmy Neesham, who scored 16, added 29 runs in the final three overs. Pakistan skipper Azam, who was desperate for runs after making just 39 in five matches before the semi-final, was dropped first ball by wicketkeeper Conway off Trent Boult in the reply. But after his nervy start he hammered a four off Boult and partner Rizwan also helped himself to two boundaries in a costly 15-run over for New Zealand. They plundered more boundaries off Tim Southee in another 15-run over, racing to 55-0 from the powerplay. Azam brought up his half-century before New Zealand got a glimmer of hope when he was caught in the deep off Boult and the same bowler then removed Rizwan. But Mohammad Haris (30) and Shan Masood (3 not out) kept their nerve to steer them home. – AFP","pubDate":"2022-11-09 16:18:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"kuwaittimes","country":["Kuwait"],"category":["sports"],"language":"arabic"},{"title":"Watch: Wasim Akram, Shoaib Malik and Waqar Younis dance in TV Studio after Pakistan secures final berth of the T20 WC","link":"https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-wasim-akram-shoaib-malik-and-waqar-younis-dance-in-tv-studio-after-pakistan-secures-final-berth-of-the-t20-wc-3000887","keywords":["Sports","Cricket"],"creator":["DNA Web Team"],"video_url":null,"description":"On Wednesday, November 9, Babar Azam's men defeated Kane Williamson and Co. by seven wickets in the semi-final at the Sydney Cricket Ground.","content":"Former Pakistan cricketers were delighted after the Men in Green advanced to the final of the T20 World Cup 2022 to be played on Sunday, November 13 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

FirstCricket Staff November 9th, 2022 22:02:17 IST Then-India skipper MS Dhoni walks back to the pavilion after getting run-out during the 2019 Cricket World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Manchester. AFP The Indian cricket team has been fairly consistent when it comes to ICC tournaments, reaching the knockouts more often than not, and having tasted success across all the major competitions, including the prized ODI World Cup. This year, the Men in Blue qualified for the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup Down Under on the back of strong performances in the league stage, where they finished on top of their group 2. T20 World Cup: Full coverage | Schedule | Results | Points Table | News | Photos The team bowing out in the group stage last year seemed an aberration of sorts, but it appears normalcy has been restored with Rohit Sharma and Co progressing to the last four. However, it is the business end of these big events that haven’t been too kind towards the Indians of late. After the glorious, trophy-laden chapter of Indian cricket that is MS Dhoni’s reign, where India won the T20 and ODI World Cups as well as the Champions Trophy, Team India has found itself losing crunch encounters, the ones that matter the most. And so often have India endured heartbreaks in such matches over the years that they face the danger of becoming associated with the dreaded C-word that South Africa has grown accustomed to. Ahead of India’s semi-final clash against England in Adelaide on Thursday, we take a look at the knockout punches dealt to India in ICC events in the last eight years: Lost to Sri Lanka by six wickets, 2014 T20 World Cup Final, Mirpur Less than a year since lifting the Champions Trophy in Birmingham, India were on the cusp of winning a second ICC trophy — one that could’ve been their second T20 world title. And while India looked every bit a deserved winner in their run to the final, they failed to carry the momentum of their wins in the group stage and in the semis over to the final, where they locked horns with a spirited Sri Lankan side that was determined to end a jinx of their own. Barring Virat Kohli, who struck a valiant 77, none of the Indian batters got going against the disciplined Lankan attack, with the likes of Yuvraj Singh scoring at a strike rate slightly above 50. Their modest total of 130 hardly proved a challenge for the Sri Lankans, who finally won their first ICC title since the legendary 1996 triumph with Kumar Sangakkara’s unbeaten 52 guiding them to a six-wicket win. Lost to Australia by 95 runs, 2015 Cricket World Cup semi-final, Sydney A little over a year after their defeat against Sri Lanka in the T20 World Cup final, India would relinquish their hold on the Cricket World Cup with a 95-run hammering against Australia in Sydney. Future captains Aaron Finch and Steve Smith took the attack to the Indian bowlers not long after the tournament hosts lost an early wicket of David Warner. The pair would then build the foundation for a mammoth total with a 182-run second-wicket stand, with Smith departing shortly after bringing up his fourth ODI ton. India, in reply, began bravely with a 76-run opening stand between Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma before losing wickets in a cluster that allowed the Aussies to wrest control of the game. This is the match when Virat Kohli top-edged to a Mitchell Johnson bouncer and perished for a one run. Skipper Dhoni tried recreating the magic of his unbeaten 91 in Mumbai four years back, but his dismissal for a run-a-ball 65 signalled the end of India’s hopes of pulling off a miracle. Lost to West Indies by 7 wickets, 2016 T20 World Cup semi-final, Mumbai As was the case last year in the Cricket World Cup, India would end up getting stopped on their tracks in the semis by the eventual winners — West Indies in this case. Kohli followed up his brilliant 82 not out against Australia in their final Super 12 clash with an unbeaten 89 against the Windies to guide the Men in Blue to 192/2 at the Wankhede Stadium, a total they would’ve assumed was a safe one. And with the Windies tottering at 19/2 in the powerplay during the chase, the hosts would’ve mentally been making plans for a summit clash against England in Kolkata. The trio of Johnson Charles (52), Lendl Simmons (82 not out), and Andre Russell (43 not out) had other plans though, as they would pull off a sensational recovery and help the team reach a second final in four years. Lost to Pakistan by 180 runs, 2017 Champions Trophy final, London India entered the contest as the rank favourites, having thrashed Pakistan comprehensively in the group stage earlier in the tournament and not having lost a match against the Men in Green in an ICC event in eight years. A fateful no-ball by Jasprit Bumrah, however, would serve as an omen of the things to come as Fakhar Zaman, the batter who got the reprieve thanks to Bumrah’s overstepping, would go on to smash 114. With supporting acts from Azhar Ali (59) and Mohammad Hafeez (57 not out), Pakistan posted a humungous 338/4 on the board. India, in reply, suffered the all-too-familiar top-order collapse at the hands of a rampaging Mohammed Amir, both Rohit and Kohli departing for single-digit scores, and the writing was pretty much on the wall by the time Dhawan and Yuvraj were dismissed. Hardik Pandya’s (76) late fightback prevented the team from getting bundled out for less than 100 and only helped delay the inevitable. Lost to New Zealand by 18 runs, 2019 Cricket World Cup semi-final, Manchester India had struck early after the Black Caps opted to bat, getting rid of Martin Guptill for 1, but skipper Kane Williamson (67) and batter Ross Taylor would get the team back on its feet by scoring half-centuries. Despite a late fightback from the Indian bowling unit, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar snaring three wickets in the third powerplay, the Kiwis managed to post 239/8 on the board. It was a score the Men in Blue would’ve fancied chasing down, however, rain gods decided to take over for the day, which meant the match would go to the reserve day and the Kiwis swing bowlers had a crack at Indian batters on a breezy morning instead of the night under lights. For the second time in as many ICC events, however, the Indian top-order crumbled; KL Rahul, Rohit, and Kohli departed for identical scores of 1, and by the time Dinesh Karthik was dismissed, India were staring at a huge defeat. Team India did fight back through their middle order though, first with Rishabh Pant and Pandya, both scoring 32, followed by Dhoni (50) and Ravindra Jadeja’s (77) half-centuries. Dhoni carried India to the brink, only for a brilliant direct hit from Guptill to catch him short of the striker’s end, signalling not only the end of India’s hopes of reaching a second Cricket World Cup final that decade, but also the end of MSD’s international career.

FirstCricket Staff November 9th, 2022 21:44:27 IST Shoaib Akhtar sends special message to India after Pakistan enter T20 World Cup final. Image credit: Twitter/@shoaib100mph After Pakistan booked their place in the final of the ongoing T20 World Cup, legendary fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said that he is eagerly waiting for India to defeat England in the second semi-final on Wednesday at the Adelaide Oval so that Pakistan can take on the Men in Blue in the final of the T20 World Cup 2022 on November 13 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. After Pakistan’s clinical victory against New Zealand, Akhtar shared a video on Twitter, stating that he wishes to see the two arch-rivals locking horns for the elusive title. “Hindustan, hum Melbourne pahunch chuke hain aur aapka wait kar rahe hain (Hey India, we have arrived in Melbourne and are waiting for you). I wish you all the best for thrashing England in the semi-finals and progressing to the finals in Melbourne. We defeated England at this very venue back in 1992,” said Akhtar. “I wish for a India vs Pakistan final. There should be another game between these two sides in the tournament and in fact, the whole world wants that,” he concluded. Dear India, good luck for tomorrow. We’ll be waiting for you in Melbourne for a great game of cricket. pic.twitter.com/SdBLVYD6vm — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) November 9, 2022 Notably, India and Pakistan opened their T20 World Cup campaign against each other and it was Rohit Sharma’s side that rode on Virat Kohli’s brilliant innings to emerge the winner in a thrilling clash. Talking about Pakistan vs New Zealand semis clash, the Men in Green first restricted the Black Caps to 152 for four on a slow SCG track and then chased down the target with consummate ease, riding on skipper Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan’s attacking fifties to book their place in the final after 13 years.

Chetan Narula November 9th, 2022 21:20:07 IST India's batting needs to come to the fore for them to beat England in the semi-final of T20 World Cup. AP Just like his batting approach, Jos Buttler is a straight shooter. A day ahead of the semi-final against India, he was asked if the differently-sized boundaries at the Adelaide Oval could have an impact on England’s batting style. “We aim to bat with freedom and our approach hasn’t changed throughout the tournament. Tomorrow, I don’t want a par score or a sub-par score (and leave it to my bowlers). I want a par-plus score, which the opposition cannot chase. At the same time, we are confident of chasing down anything that India gives us,” he said. T20 World Cup: Full coverage | Schedule | Results | Points Table | News | Photos It is a strange but effective method of oozing confidence ahead of a big clash. Additionally, it also throws down the gauntlet – by claiming to score a tall one or chase down something similar, England have made their pre-match move. Now, it is for India to reveal their cards or call England’s bluff. Thing is, India can only do it on the field of play. If not poker, it could also be a game of chess. In any high-stakes game, or tournament, the contest isn’t only about what happens on the day. As always, mind games start a lot earlier. And with that comment, Buttler has egged India on. Of course, the Indian batters are quite professional and they wouldn’t respond to it in public. It remains to be seen if they can get down to business on the day at the Adelaide Oval. For Rohit Sharma and company, meanwhile, this tournament has been about a process that was set in motion the day he became skipper. It is not to undermine what his predecessor did, or didn’t do. But to not qualify for the knockouts in the previous T20 World Cup wasn’t simply a disappointment. Indian cricket is a behemoth, so much so that it could field a B-squad in this World Cup and that team too would have a good shot of making the knockouts. From 2021 to 2022 then, Rohit’s team has only completed one part of the process. IND vs ENG: Pant or Karthik in semis? Captain Rohit Sharma responds “Any tournament like this can be divided into two. For us only one part of the process is done, and the ultimate goal is to win ICC trophies. We are still some distance away from that goal,” said the captain, on semi-final eve. That distance can be measured in terms of Buttler’s challenge. It can be measured in England’s own assertion that, unlike the remainder of the cricketing universe, they don’t want to see an India-Pakistan final. Forget who wins the first semi-final, for that is not in England’s control. Dealing with India is what they can control. The last time these two sides met in a T20 World Cup was back in Sri Lanka back in 2014. A lot has changed about this English side in its white-ball approach since then. And this change can be seen in how many English cricketers are part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) now, as compared to eight years ago. This relationship has brought the players and teams closer, so much so that they know each other inside out. “All of them, as a team,” laughed Buttler, when asked who would be the main cause of worry for England in this Indian line-up. He isn’t going to lay down his cards so easily in public, of course. Even so, Suryakumar Yadav’s 360-play, Virat Kohli’s resurgence and KL Rahul’s late form has to be worrisome for the English attack. With 246 runs, Virat Kohli is the highest run-getter so far in the T20 World Cup. AP In truth, this is the key differentiation between both sides. While England’s openers Buttler and Alex Hales have scored 244 runs between them, their middle order is struggling. None of Ben Stokes, Dawid Malan or Liam Livingstone has crossed the 60-run mark. For the Indian bowling attack, this is the key battle. IND vs ENG: Shaky Indian top order and other areas England could target Simultaneously, it is also true. India’s opening partnerships have been a letdown. Rohit’s own form is worrisome, with only 89 runs coming off five innings. Later down the order, it could be a late toss-up between Dinesh Karthik and Rishabh Pant. The finisher ploy hasn’t worked, and Pant has lost game time because of this catch-22 situation. Hardik Pandya has been there or thereabouts, getting the game time, but not scoring enough runs, even if his touch or form is quite encouraging. At this point, the obvious question remains. All things considered equal, how does India get past England in Adelaide? There is no doubt the Indian batters will have to come to the party on Thursday night. It is the team’s traditional strength of course, but additionally the bowling form – apart from Arshdeep Singh – isn’t much to write home about. As frail as the English middle-order might be, it will only be put under pressure by the Indian batting, not bowling. It is pretty much what Buttler alluded to when throwing down the gauntlet earlier. In that light, the Indian batting is in some good shape. Virat Kohli is back to his imperious best. He has been batting aggressively in the net sessions, hardly missing any. Almost as if, he wants to stay in the zone throughout this tournament, and get the job done. He is batting as if possessed, a man on a mission, one that was unfinished last year in the UAE. He won’t be able to do it alone, of course. India’s Mr. 360 has to come to the party, all over again. Time and again, the Indian batter’s record in the knockouts is talked about. Kohli, Rohit and Rahul have all wasted opportunities to make it count, and bring silverware home. It has been the story since 2013. Surely, Suryakumar Yadav doesn’t want to add his name to that infamous list. It has been a long 12 months for SKY to set himself up, as the fulcrum of this Indian batting line-up, as well as the, conquer of the top spot in ICC T20I rankings . Perhaps whatever we have witnessed so far from him has all been just a precursor of things to come. If ever there was a time to make it all count, this is it!

Chetan Narula November 9th, 2022 20:06:56 IST Pakistan's Shan Masood hit the winning runs after openers rewind the clock back to last year. AP Sydney: Wednesday at the Sydney Cricket Ground was all about déjà vu. The first over, took us back to the 2015 ODI World Cup final in Melbourne. On the third ball, Brendon McCullum charged Mitchell Starc, and his stumps were rattled. The rest is history. Later, McCullum would say that he didn’t regret his charge. T20 World Cup: Full coverage | Schedule | Results | Points Table | News | Photos It makes for some wonder, if Finn Allen regretted the first three balls he played at the SCG. The first a well-timed boundary; the second a flick gone wrong and he survived the lbw decision via DRS review. The third, well, he tried to flick again and this time Shaheen Afridi had his man. Why the regret, you ask? Isn’t this the way Finn plays his cricket? Isn’t this the way he smashed Australia on the opening night of the Super 12 stage? Isn’t this what gives New Zealand a power start? If it comes off, well and good. If it doesn’t, that’s the essence of T20 cricket, isn’t it? Babar Azam 🤝 Mohammad Rizwan Pakistan’s openers made history (again!) in the #NZvPAK semi-final 👇 #T20WorldCup https://t.co/1nSbH60yNN — ICC (@ICC) November 9, 2022 Cynics would argue that Allen should have toned down a bit on this all-important day. Perhaps this writer is a cynic himself; it comes easy to those just watching. In the moment, with adrenaline pumping through, and so much at stake, neither McCullum nor Allen did anything wrong. Only, their team didn’t benefit. Australia did in 2015 and Pakistan in 2022. It had one chance against this calculative, calm Kiwi line-up. Hit them hard in the powerplay and choke their scoring to a sub-par total. New Zealand too was wary of Pakistan’s fast bowling threat. For all purposes, this was a game of who blinks first. Allen did, Shaheen Afridi didn’t. New Zealand did. Pakistan didn’t. Read: Daunting Pakistan sail into final, with Matthew Hayden wielding the magic wand Each of Pakistan’s World Cup wins has been on the back of a mercurial fast bowler. If it were Imran Khan and Wasim Akram in the 1992 ODI World Cup, then it was Umar Gul in the 2009 T20 World Cup. Afridi is the key to Pakistan’s present and future. He showed as much in last year’s tournament in the UAE, only to get upstaged in the semi-final. It was time for a do-over, and he wrote a different script for his team on Wednesday night. Talking of last year, that’s what the second déjà vu moment alludes to. After New Zealand had posted 152-4, it still seemed a fighting total to the neutral eye. This Kiwi bowling attack has done well in this tournament, not even needing a sixth bowling option. On a two-paced, slow wicket, surely they could fight for the win at the very least? Kane Williamson: It is a tough pill for us to swallow Maybe it was hope for the neutral eye, more than anything. Maybe it wasn’t such a neutral thought. Albeit, any such thoughts vaporised quickly. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan batted as if still in 2021, a second time travel of the day for those watching. Last year, they had batted and batted in the UAE, and then batted more. Amassing almost 600 runs in six innings, they typified a new batting approach for Pakistan – calm, concentrated, assertive, and yet dominant. Remember how India was thumped with a 152/0 scoreline? Well, they started in the same manner. 55-0 in the powerplay – the key battle on the day had been won. New Zealand had lost Allen early and then stuttered through its powerplay. The Black Caps relied on Devon Conway and Kane Williamson to finesse some boundaries, if not bring out power hitting. It didn’t happen. 38/2 is not a powerplay score worthy for a tight semi-final. Babar and Rizwan didn’t rely on power-hitting either. They hit nine boundaries in those six overs, but no sixes. Compare that to New Zealand’s who hit mere three fours, and you realize the game was won in those 12 overs. So much so, 3.1 overs into the Pakistan innings, and the duo had already smacked four boundaries. It was already too many for comfort. Read: Pakistan’s multiple milestones with win against New Zealand It put the onus back on New Zealand. They needed breakthroughs when none were forthcoming. The half chances weren’t sticking any longer, as they had done throughout the tournament. There were misfields and their fielding performance on the whole didn’t look recognizable. Slowly, but surely, Pakistan had broken down New Zealand’s resolve. Mind you, this wasn’t a win for unpredictability over consistency. In the build-up to this game, this contest wasn’t in equilibrium. By right, Pakistan shouldn’t have been there. That’s what they do though, isn’t it? Bring complete mayhem to the table and let the other side deal with it, if they can at all. New Zealand, with their calm demeanour and ever-smiling professional approach, were considered way too smart for such upsets. In the end, though, it wasn’t the unpredictable Pakistan that won the day. Instead, it was a calm, collected approach, something we had seen amply in 2021. It was a matter of simply hitting rewind. Jubilation for Pakistan fans 🇵🇰😄 Presenting the @oppo Shot of the Day 📸 #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/aLX8GgifaA — ICC (@ICC) November 9, 2022 Sample this. In their 105-run partnership, Babar and Rizwan ran 33 singles, five doubles, and even a triple – that’s 46 runs running between the wickets. On a wicket where boundaries were difficult to come by, they copied what New Zealand did – 21 twos in the innings – and beat them at it. Running hard between the wickets eased the pressure off Babar and Rizwan, instead, heaping it on New Zealand who slipped out of the game with every delivery that didn’t take a wicket. It took the Black Caps 52 balls to send one of the openers back, and you knew, Pakistan had put one foot into the MCG already by then.

The hearing, due to start on November 28, could yet be held in private if any of the parties involved successfully appeal. Rafiq has indicated he would almost certainly not participate if that happened, even though he expects a public hearing to be detrimental to him personally. I will be vindicated again, I've got absolutely no doubt whatsoever. But will that change my life? I actually think it’ll make things worse. Azeem Rafiq He told the PA news agency: “My view is I’ve gone through all these processes and been vindicated, yet I and my family continue to be put through some very awful situations. “So I’ll go in another room and I will be vindicated again, I’ve got absolutely no doubt whatsoever.

But my view is that at some point in life, you’ve got to look past your own nose.” Rafiq is convinced the handling of his case, and the reaction of many within the sport to him and to Yorkshire chair Lord Kamlesh Patel, are proof that cricket remains institutionally racist. And he reckons that without the harrowing testimony he gave before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee almost a year ago, there would have been even less progress than there has been. “Let’s be right – if it wasn’t for the select committee, I’d still be fighting,” he added. “People actually don’t know what institutional racism is – one of the definitions is not having the procedures and processes (in place) to deal with grievances or allegations. “The fact that we’re still here two years on and there are still question marks as to what’s happening and what’s not happening, just shows that is the case. “I have put myself through all this – the Squire Patton Boggs (investigation commissioned by Yorkshire), as flawed as it was, still had no choice but to vindicate me.

From my understanding of institutional racism, this is it.” Asked if cricket had changed in the year since his appearance before the DCMS committee, Rafiq said: “No. At Yorkshire there’s obviously an attempt to go in the right direction, and it shows that leadership matters. But you’ve seen the way Lord Patel has been treated. “He is a Lord, he’s worked in drug addiction and social care. He’s worked in helping save people’s lives, and he’s being treated the way he’s been treated. What chance have any of us got?” Rafiq still has low confidence in the system, and joined former Yorkshire chair Roger Hutton in questioning why the ECB’s own conduct was not being examined as part of the CDC hearing.

So on that, I think Roger is right.” Rafiq will move out of the UK this month amid continued abuse and threats aimed at his family, but will be back to appear before the CDC and has also been invited to appear before the DCMS committee again on December 13. “There have been emails saying ‘shut up, or this will happen to your family’.

On Sunday last, all of the nation was praying for a miracle – for South Africa or India to lose so that they would still be in the fight. It wasn’t a strong conviction, but a feeble hope.But, by the end of the day, their prayers were heard and the team was in the semi-final. Now, on this Wednesday, Pakistan sealed their berth in the T20 World Cup 2022 final, with a performance which was a far cry from sheer passion and chance. It was a display of pure professionalism, with coach Matthew Hayden’s contribution to this side reflecting in every aspect.Pakistan gave New Zealand no chance at all to make a fight of it as they virtually coasted into the final post the Power Play, and the big Australian’s mark was seen in every step.Scenes at the SCG 🎊🙌#WeHaveWeWill | #T20WorldCup | #NZvPAK pic.twitter.com/r15qUjVyFX— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 9, 2022Hayden has been on social media, exhorting the side, urging them to give more. It may not always be that the Aussie’s drawl was clear to each and every player, but there was no doubt that his drive and professionalism had a clear mark on the semi-final with the most un-Pakistan like fielding adding to ever-daunting bowling attack.New Zealand had little option than to bat after winning the toss. Getting runs on board and then defending them would be the strongest suit in each knockout game, and here too they got off on the right foot.But what they had not bargained for was being out-thought in the field. They had always known that they would be against a massive bowling battery, but had bargained on some blunders in the field to come to their aid.Not one match has gone in the tournament so far where Pakistan have not dropped at least one catch. But there was no such glitch on Wednesday. On the contrary, they were right up there with the best in the business. In fact, as it turned out, Pakistan fielded way better than New Zealand at the end of the day and that in itself made their job that much easier down the order.Selfie time at the #T20WorldCup 🤳#WeHaveWeWill pic.twitter.com/3hCPHqAPK3— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 9, 2022The bowling was, as always, the best in the World Cup, and the early inroads in the Power Play were a testament to that, as well as the fielding. Shaheen Shah Afridi is returning to his best, while the other bowlers were all in the fight.New Zealand were surprised, and that puts it mildly. They were expecting a hammer and tongs bowling attack, but not the kind of ground fielding they witnessed.That apart, the field placements, another testament to Hayden’s influence was another challenge. The deep fielders on the on-side were all kept a good 15 yards inside the ropes, challenging the Kiwis to go over and find the boundary.New Zealand never rose to that challenge, or rather, the Pakistan bowlers never let them get under the ball.5️⃣7️⃣ off 4️⃣3️⃣ balls 🌟@iMRizwanPak – player of the match in the semi-final win 🏆#WeHaveWeWill | #T20WorldCup | #NZvPAK pic.twitter.com/RRqZbGyEHA— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 9, 2022Kane Williamson scored a few, but his T20 credentials have not improved through this tournament. Daryl Mitchell by and large played a lone hand and the rest just did not come to the party.More so, they realised that the pitch was not the best, sothey fell back to the slow bouncers and cutters towards the end of the rivals’ inning and that made a massive difference.Then of course, the batters got into action. Babar Azam got an early life as New Zealand fielded well below their normal excellent selves. With Mohammad Rizwan taking on the new ball bowlers right from the start and with the skipper joining in, the Power Play essentially decided the match, as New Zealand had few answers.Pakistan showed a little bit of their nervous selves towards the end of the game with just a few runs to get, but eventually it all fell in place for them.Now they will be the team to watch. India and England meet up for their contest on Thursday and that too should be quite the humdinger. But irrespective of who get to the final, taking on Pakistan will be a new challenge now.They are no mixing passion and professionalism, aggression with cunning. This can be quite a mix to counter. So, watch out for Pakistan, whoever goes into the final.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

But there was still some hope and quite a few permutations and combinations that worked for the Asian side. Apart from hoping for other results to go in their favour, Pakistan beat Netherlands, South Africa and Bangladesh in the Super 12 stage, the last of which was a virtual knockout game given the Proteas had lost to Netherlands in the earlier game.Pakistan are now going into the final of this year’s T20 World Cup, where they will meet either India or England on 13 November at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. They turned the odds in their favour.We take a look at the Babar Azam-led Pakistan team’s journey in the competition so far.Adelaide ✈️ Sydney #WeHaveWeWill | #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/uyncm4WPjJ— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 7, 2022India vs PakistanPakistan had put up 159/8 in 20 overs in Melbourne after Shan Masood and Iftikhar Ahmed scored individual half-centuries.The bowlers then took the onus and ripped apart the Indian batting unit to leave them struggling at 31/4.But Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya had other plans as they chipped in with a 113-run stand for the fifth wicket.The high-voltage encounter got more intensified in the final phase of the game. India needed 31 from the final two overs when Kohli showed his class and hammered two consecutive sixes against Haris Rauf on the last two balls of the 19th over.The equation was now down to 16 needed off 6 and Babar handed the ball to Nawaz who had a tough day at the office. But the spinner removed Pandya on the very first ball and gave only three runs in the first three balls.But he then made a massive mistake. Nawaz bowled a waist-height no-ball to Kohli who dispatched it for a six. The bowler then followed it with a wide before India eventually got three byes on the free hit.India needed two off two with Dinesh Karthik on strike. The right-handed batter stepped out but missed it completely to get stumped out leaving the team in a spot of bother again.🗣️ Encouraging words from 🇵🇰 team mentor Matthew Hayden following the win over Bangladesh that sealed our spot in the semi-finals 🔊#WeHaveWeWill | #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/OgolOwGfGs— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 6, 2022Ravichandran Ashwin was the next man in and probably the most cool-headed man present at the stadium at that point. Nawaz made another blunder of bowling a wide going down the leg. The equation was now 1 needed from the last ball.The Indian batter kept his cool and played the final ball over mid-off to get the winning runs. India won by 4 wickets.Kohli remained unbeaten on 82 off 53.Pakistan vs ZimbabweThis probably was one of the biggest upsets in this edition of the T20 World Cup. Pakistan bowlers had done their job well after restricting Zimbabwe to 130/8 in 20 overs.But the batters had a disappointing run as the side lost wickets at regular intervals and were eventually restricted to 129/8 in 20 overs.Shan Masood showed some mettle as he scored 44 off 38 but his efforts weren’t enough to take the side home. Pakistan lost to Zimbabwe by 1 run.Pakistan vs NetherlandsPakistan finally got off the mark after beating the Netherlands by 6 wickets while chasing a target of 92 runs. Babar Azam’s troops restricted the Dutch at 91/9 in 20 overs and later chased down the target in the 14th over.Rizwan top-scored with 49 off 39.🗣️ Skipper @babarazam258 speaks to his team after Pakistan qualify for the #T20WorldCup semifinals 🔊#WeHaveWeWill pic.twitter.com/CkmpJCj6o3— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 6, 2022Pakistan vs South AfricaThe clash between Pakistan and South Africa certainly changed the equation and qualification scenarios. Moreover, rain once again played a spoilsport but it did work in Pakistan’s favour.Batting first the Asian side posted 185/9 in 20 overs. In reply, the Proteas were 69/4 in 9 overs when the play was halted due to rain and the target was eventually reduced to 142 in 14 overs.South Africa needed 73 from the final five overs but they were restricted to 108/9. Shaheen Afridi bagged a three-fer as Pakistan took away two crucial points.Pakistan vs BangladeshPakistan now had four points from four games while South Africa had five as one of their matches was also called off due to rain.The Temba Bavuma-led side had to win the last group stage match against the Netherlands to march ahead. But for Pakistan, the equation was now a bit tricky..@shani_official leads the conversation with @iShaheenAfridi and @iamharis63 after 🇵🇰 booked a semi-final berth 🎙️#WeHaveWeWill | #T20WorldCup | #PAKvBAN pic.twitter.com/s3uHUdghgA— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) November 6, 2022The situation was that South Africa’s defeat against the Netherlands would have given Pakistan as well as Bangladesh a fair chance for making the qualification as both the sides had four points each and were slated to lock horns with each other in their last respective group stage game.And it did happen.South Africa lost to the Netherlands and handed a genuine chance to both Pakistan and Bangladesh to qualify for the semis.Pakistan didn’t let this slip away as Shaheen Afridi stepped up on the occasion, and scalped four wickets against Bangladesh. Pakistan restricted them to 127/8 in 20 overs and then chased down the target by 5 wickets. Pakistan will now play New Zealand in the semi-final on Wednesday in Sydney.New Zealand vs Pakistan, 1st semi-finalSome might say Pakistan were surprise entrants to the T20 World Cup semi-finals given the position they were in once at the group stage, and when the first semi-final was played in Sydney on 9 November, they delivered yet another memorable performance.WHAT A WIN, PAKISTAN! 🤯Pakistan have reached their third Men's #T20WorldCup final 👏#NZvPAK pic.twitter.com/dumaIcWVeZ— ICC (@ICC) November 9, 2022New Zealand won the toss and opted to bat. It was a dream start for Pakistan, as Shaheen Afridi struck in just the third ball of the match, to get rid of Finn Allen (4). While Devon Conway and Kane Williamson (46) forged a 34-run stand for the second wicket before Conway departed, the Black Caps skipper could only forge 11 runs for the third wicket with Glenn Phillips, who was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz. Wickets at intervals hurt Kiwis’ momentum, but captain Kane and Daryl Mitchell (53*) rebuilt the innings with a 58-run stand for the fourth wicket before the skipper departed. New Zealand eventually posted 152/4 on the board.In reply, Pakistan were almost utterly dominant with the bat as Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan forged a 105-run stand for the opening wicket. Trent Boult struck in the 13th over to remove Azam for 53 but Pakistan were already in a strong position having crossed 100-run mark. Boult struck again in the 17th over to see off Rizwan for 57.Mohammed Harris was the batter next who joined Shan Masood in the middle, but the duo could only add 19 runs before Harris departed. That did not matter, however, since Pakistan needed just two runs to win, and while Tim Southee conceded a wide off the first ball of the 20th over, Masood then finished the proceedings with straight-driven single past mid-off, as Pakistan won the contest and entered their first T20 World Cup final in 13 years, and their third title clash in the tournament overall.Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.
