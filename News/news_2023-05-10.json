The washout, however, turned out to be very fortunate for South Africa as they edged Ireland in the Cricket World Cup Super League points table and booked their spot in this year’s mega event. The most recent changes in the race for automatic spots had come after Sri Lanka’s unsuccessful series against New Zealand, and South Africa’s two recent wins over the Netherlands in a home series. South Africa gave themselves every opportunity to automatically qualify for this year’s ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in their last home series against the Netherlands. The Proteas’ series victory propelled them past the West Indies into the eighth and final slot in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League standings. However, their prospects of automatic qualification were still dependent on Ireland’s ODIs against Bangladesh. A 3-0 series victory for Ireland would have tied them on points with South Africa if no penalty points were awarded. The net run rate would still have come into play for the last slot, but since Ireland’s first ODI against Bangladesh was called off on Tuesday, the Proteas have secured their place in the World Cup. Meanwhile, Ireland will have to play the Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June. Teams – Qualified for ICC Men’s ODI World Cup: India (hosts), New Zealand, England, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa. Cricket World Cup Qualifier Teams: 10 (West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland, Oman, Nepal, USA, UAE).

Wobei, so brutal wie in Kapfenberg und Simmering geht es im Derby della Madonnina wohl auch nicht zu, steht doch das Spiel zwischen den beiden Stadtklubs im Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seit jeher unter der Schirmherrschaft der Gottesmutter. Laut Volksmund wacht sie als goldene Statue auf einer Spitze des Mailänder Doms darüber, dass sich Spieler und Fans benehmen. Aber vielleicht sind sich Rossoneri und Nerazzurri gerade deshalb so spinnefeind, weil sie Zwillinge sind? Beide Vereine gingen aus demselben Klub hervor - dem 1899 gegründeten Milan Cricket and Football Club. Das lief einige Zeit gut, bis sich 1908 mehrere Mitglieder abspalteten und ihren eigenen Fußballverein - den Football Club Internazionale Milano - gründeten. Sie waren darüber verärgert, dass beim nationalistisch ausgerichteten Milan CFC nur Italiener spielen durften. Mit dem Zusatz Internazionale wollte man die Offenheit des Vereins für ausländische Spieler betonen. Real Madrid - Manchester City AC Milan - Inter Mailand Mi., 21 Uhr/Servus-TV Rückspiele am 16./17. Mai Heute freilich gehören Legionäre auf beiden Seiten zur Normalität. Das erste Duell zwischen Inter und Milan war im Übrigen eine der wenigen Partien, die nicht in Mailand stattfanden. Am 8. Oktober 1908 trafen die frisch getrennten Geschwister beim Freundschaftsturniers Coppa Chiasso im Schweizer Chiasso aufeinander. Die Derby-Premiere entschied der Associazione Calcio Milan mit 2:1 für sich. Das erste Match in Mailand stieg am 10. Jänner 1909. Das Stadion Giuseppe Meazza, das die Fans aber lieber nach dem Stadtteil San Siro nennen, wurde 1926 errichtet und dient seither dem Derby della Madonnina als Spielstätte. Sie trägt den Namen eines der populärsten und erfolgreichsten Stürmer der nationalen Fußballgeschichte. Mit 284 Treffern ist Meazza Rekordtorschütze seines langjährigen Vereins Inter Mailand und liegt in der ewigen Bestenliste der Torschützen der Serie A mit 216 Toren neben José Altafini auf dem vierten Platz. Die Arena, die seit 1978 Meazzas Namen trägt, steht im Übrigen im Eigentum der beiden rivalisierenden Klubs, die es im Unterschied zu 1860 München und dem FC Bayern geschafft haben, ihr Haus gemeinsam zu bestellen. Aktuell fasst das Stadion San Siro rund 76.000 Zuschauer, und auch beim Derby della Madonnina am Mittwochabend (21 Uhr/ Servus-TV) wird das Oval bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt sein. Für die Stadtrivalen Inter und Milan geht es um nicht viel weniger als den Einzug ins Finale der Königsklasse. Und das will was heißen, wartet doch die italienische Fußballnation seit Inters Triumph im Jahr 2010 auf einen Champions-League-Sieg. Vor 13 Jahren setzten sich die Nerazzurri unter Jose Mourinho in ihrer Triple-Saison die europäische Krone auf. Marko Arnautovic konnte in seinem Jahr in Mailand zumindest eine knappe Stunde in der Liga mitwirken, in der Champions League kam der damals 21-Jährige nie zum Zug. Milan wartet noch länger auf eine Teilnahme in einem Champions-League-Finale. 2007 holten sich die Rossoneri letztmals den Titel. \"Wir werden alles rundherum genießen bis Mittwoch 20.59 Uhr, und dann müssen wir bereit sein. Wir müssen dieses Prickeln fühlen\", sagte Milans Trainer Stefano Pioli über die Stimmung in der Metropole. Das Euroderby wurde ausgerufen. \"Es ist nicht nur ein Derby, es ist DAS Derby\", hielt Inters Coach Simone Inzaghi fest. Er warnte vor zu viel Übermut: \"Was das Herz angeht, habe ich keine Zweifel. Was den Kopf angeht, wäre es gut, wenn wir ihn benutzen und uns erinnern, dass über 180 Minuten auf uns warten.\" Es ist das 236. Duell, in der Bilanz die Nase vorne hat derzeit Inter. Das Rückspiel steigt am 16. Mai erneut im San Siro. Schon jetzt ist fix, dass sich Italiens Fußball nach Jahren mit ausbleibenden Erfolgen wieder über einen Champions-League-Finalisten freuen darf. Juventus stand 2015 und 2017 im Endspiel, verlor gegen den FC Barcelona beziehungsweise Real Madrid aber beide. Eine Favoritenrolle lässt sich wiederum noch nicht ausmachen. In der Serie A ist Inter Vierter, AC Milan Fünfter und damit außerhalb der Startplätze für die kommende Champions League. Zwei Zähler trennen die beiden Nachbarn. Dreimal trafen die Klubs in dieser Saison aufeinander. Im Supercup siegte Inter in Saudi-Arabien mit 3:0, in der Liga gab es jeweils einen Erfolg von Milan sowie von Inter. Pioli und Inzaghi gaben jedenfalls an, sich nicht als Favorit zu fühlen. Das Mailänder Duell um das Finalticket der Königsklasse gab es bereits vor 20 Jahren. 2003 spielten Andrij Schewtschenko, Paolo Maldini oder Filippo Inzaghi für Milan, Inter bot Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti und Hernan Crespo auf. 0:0 und 1:1 endeten die Partien. Milan stieg dank Schewtschenkos Auswärtstor auf und holte im rein-italienischen Endspiel gegen Juventus im Elfmeterschießen den Titel. Zu einer inneritalienischen Angelegenheit wird das große Finale am 10. Juni in Istanbul nicht werden. Das zweite Finalticket matchen sich Real und Manchester City aus (nach Redaktionsschluss).","pubDate":"2023-05-09 15:28:34","image_url":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_cache/image/1xURJYMHxM6mbj4AbNIfUbRBez3yhI7mQgbAGMdMiT8lMpvXX9H8KQL-2RcfG6X9jn5xldgk87rhv6Yme4GxPfzB0506QqqzkCKIOdjLvXOpCzWHKWAeR0tj6IYA66RSbBrO1Y2LcACF1i9KJ3W_fGmzigPXGRqwvzy0sE_kv_L3SGtQqn57H0RwRZgZY_fdgaxGLhVJB7A6_kyN8ZdlEOH8--kVLxQB2D/230509_1733_948_0900_434789_italy_feature_heritage_achitecture.jpg","source_id":"wienerzeitung","category":["sports"],"country":["austria"],"language":"german"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/rajasthan-royals-pacer-trent-boult-expresses-desire-to-play-2023-odi-world-cup-in-india/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports IPL 2023: Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India Trent Boult opted out of New Zealand central contracts last year in August to spend more time with family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world.\r Trent Boult is currently playing for Rajasthan Royals […]","content":"Home Sports IPL 2023: Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India Trent Boult opted out of New Zealand central contracts last year in August to spend more time with family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world.\r Trent Boult is currently playing for Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2023. (Image: BCCI) Jaipur: New Zealand pacer Trent Boult still has a big desire to play in the upcoming ODI World Cup in India later in the year despite having opted out of the central contract. Boult also stated that he has seen ‘little bit of movement’ in that direction of late. One of the best left-arm pacers in the world, Boult opted out of the New Zealand contract last year in August in order to give more time to his family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world. The last time Boult played for New Zealand was during the T20 World Cup last year with selectors preferring to give contracted players more opportunities. “I’ve still got that big desire to play for New Zealand. It is what it is: I’ve made my decision. “I’ve been lucky enough to have a 13-year career in the Black Cap and hey, I’ve still got a big desire to play in the World Cup as well,” the 33-year-old told ESPNCricinfo. “We’ll see how that unfolds: there’s still a bit of movement in the landscape at the moment,” added the Rajasthan Royals pacer. Boult feels New Zealand stand a good chance in the ICC event scheduled in October-November. New Zealand lost the 2019 final to hosts England in the most dramatic fashion. “I remember after the 2019 final, I said to Kane (Williamson) that we’ve got to be there again, come 2023 in India. It’s a shame with what’s going on with his knee but he’ll be working as hard as he can to try and get there. It’s such a great tournament… One hundred percent, I’ve got that desire to be out there,” he said referring to the injury Williamson suffered at the start of IPL. “We’re a great one-day side. We’ve got some players that have travelled to India and experienced the conditions a lot, and that’s what it comes down to in World Cups. You can’t buy experience, and you can’t replace players that have toured for however many years across these conditions.” Published Date: May 9, 2023 5:44 PM IST Updated Date: May 9, 2023 5:47 PM IST --> Comments - Join the Discussion --> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:30:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Hosting international events is our right’ Sarfaraz Ahmed","link":"https://a-sports.tv/hosting-international-events-is-our-right-sarfaraz-ahmed/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","Top News","Top Picks","Asia Cup 2023","Sarfaraz Ahmed"],"creator":["ali.hassan"],"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed has come out in support of the country’s hosting right of the 2023 Asia Cup – scheduled later this year -, claiming, it is ‘our right to host international events’.

The wicket-keeper batter said every major cricketing nation had toured Pakistan since the return of international cricket to its shore, adding, there was no excuse left for any team refusing to come to Pakistan. “Our players and law enforcement agencies made tireless efforts to bring cricket back to Pakistan,” he said on Tuesday during the inauguration of Jinnah College Cricket Stadium here in Karachi. “Many international teams have visited Pakistan so I don’t think there is any excuse left for any country not to send their team to our country.” Moreover, Sarfaraz Ahmed stressed that Asian Cricket Council and International Cricket Council should take measures to bring all the teams to Pakistan for the international tournaments scheduled in Pakistan. The 35-year-old also urged India to visit Pakistan for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 since the people of the country eagerly wanted to see the blockbuster rivalry on their home soil. “Pakistan is a great host. India should come to Pakistan,” he said. It must be noted here that the fate of the upcoming Asia Cup hung in balance after India refused to send their team to Pakistan in October last year on political grounds and has since been trying to shift the tournament to a neutral venue. Earlier, a report emerged that the two cricket boards were gradually moving towards a compromise and had nearly agreed to host India’s matches on a neutral venue while the rest of the tournament will be played in Pakistan. As per the latest development, however, the BCCI has refused the hybrid proposal for both events and once again demanded to shift the Asia Cup entirely from Pakistan. The two rival boards will further discuss the matter within the ACC platform to decide the fate of the six-team event.

The in-form batter had been named the ICC Men’s Player of the Month after a stunning month in April. “He [Zaman] beat out tough competition from Sri Lanka spin wizard Prabath Jayasuriya, and emerging New Zealand batter Mark Chapman,” a press release by ICC stated. The ICC said that Fakhar led the charge for Pakistan as they pulled off their second-highest ODI run-chase in Rawalpindi late in the month. The opener smashed an unbeaten 180 to help Pakistan chase down a target of 337 against the visiting New Zealand side to go 2-0 up in the series. Fakhar’s knock came with 17 boundaries and six massive sixes as Pakistan won with 10 balls to spare in a high-scoring contest. This was the left-hander’s second ton in as many matches during April with his 117 off 114 balls helping Pakistan chase down 289 in the first game at the same venue. Fakhar led the run-chase from the onset, only being dismissed in the 43rd over, by when Pakistan were well on their way to chase down the winning score. He won the Player of the Match award for his efforts. The left-hander started the month with a rapid 47 in the first T20I in Lahore against New Zealand, playing a part in the home side’s thumping 88-run victory. While he didn’t click in the next two T20I matches, Fakhar stormed into form in ODIs, a format he has always thrived in Fakhar now has 3,148 ODI runs at an average of 49.71 and a strike-rate of almost 95 during his 67-match career and the Pakistan opener said it was a great thrill to claim the coveted award. ‘Truly an honour’ “It is truly an honour for me to be named ICC Player of the Month for April,” Fakhar said. “This month has been one of the highlights of my career and it was an amazing feeling to play in front of my own people in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi,” he said. Sharing his personal favourite: the hard-hitting batter said: “I really enjoyed scoring back-to-back centuries in Rawalpindi, but my favourite was the 180 not out in the second match. “I hope to continue the momentum leading into the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, and make Pakistan cricket fans happy and proud with my performances.”","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:11:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Not Virat Kohli, Sunny Leone Picks Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings As Favourites","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/not-virat-kohli-sunny-leone-picks-mahendra-singh-dhoni-chennai-super-kings-as-favourites/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Not Virat Kohli!

However, will Pakistan actually participate in the mega event? Speculations are rife that the country may skip the event. What has led to these rumors? The Indian government has said that they will not allow their team to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup 2023, leading to the assumption that the hardliner government will not allow the Pakistani team to play in India. The mega event of International Cricket Council (ICC) is set to take place in India, with broadcasters eyeing the potential of huge revenues from an India vs Pakistan match. However, will the Pakistan team get permission to travel to India in the light of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s recent statement given during a trip to India? “Sports should be kept separated from politics and foreign policy,” the FM had stated during his visit to attend the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. Earlier reports had claimed that Pakistan will play its World Cup matches in Ahmedabad in Narendra Modi stadium in Gujrat. “Pakistan may not agree to play against India at Narendra Modi Stadium due to certain reasons,” a source has disclosed, without discussing further details on the matter before the announcement of the official schedule. It must be noted here that International Cricket Council (ICC) hasn’t announced the schedule for the World Cup so far. The mega event will take place in October-November this year in India. A reliable source in PCB has also denied reports regarding their demand from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to give them a guarantee in writing that if Pakistan goes to India for ICC World Cup, then they will come here for ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.

Published: May 9, 2023 4:56 PM IST By IANS Wriddhiman Saha […]","content":"Ahmedabad: On Sunday, in the Gujarat Titans-Lucknow Super Giants match at the Narendra Modi Stadium, openers from both teams scored half-centuries. But undoubtedly Wriddhiman Saha continued his power-play brilliance since last year’s IPL by smashing a dazzling 81 off 43 balls. With the ball coming nicely onto the bat, Saha was effortlessly toying with the lines and lengths of Lucknow’s bowlers, especially of Avesh Khan and Mohsin Khan, making 54 out of the hosts’ 78 runs in power-play, bringing up his fifty in 20 balls and setting the base for Gujarat to bat Lucknow out of the game. For someone who began his IPL career in the middle order and hit a century in an IPL final while coming at number four, Saha has now adapted quietly and quickly to the role of power-play enforcer for Gujarat, where he has a strike rate of 137.18 in IPL 2023. “Since childhood, I had the nature of hitting the ball hard even if the circle is up. Yes, when I started in the IPL, I was batting at number six or seven in KKR, CSK. Sometimes chances came of opening the batting or playing in the top order. Even when I was at Punjab Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad, I played a lot of innings at the top of the order.” “Looking at my cricket, the team management thought that I can play selflessly and fearlessly as well as take advantage of playing in power-play. There, the thinking of team management and my style of play matched, which has made life easy in terms of contributing to the team and helping in them doing well,” he said on his adaptability while going through various roles in IPL in a virtual interaction organised by the franchise. With Saha doing great in IPL 2023 and averaging 52.16 for Tripura in Ranji Trophy, many felt he would have been the ideal fit as K.L. Rahul’s replacement in India’s World Test Championship final squad. While that hasn’t happened, Saha, who has 40 Test caps, said he had no such thoughts about it. “Right now, I am playing franchise cricket, which is the IPL. So, I am thinking of my IPL team first. Regarding other things, it’s not in my hand and I don’t even think about it.” With a controlling the controllable mindset and not pondering over the uncontrollable elements, Saha is now eyeing to enjoy whatever roles are assigned to him in whatever is left in his playing career. “As I am getting older and my cricketing career is almost at its last phase, when I started out playing cricket as an individual, it began out of enjoyment. As of now, that enjoyment continues to be there, be it be at domestic or IPL.” “Another thing is, being able to contribute to the team and enjoying doing my physical activities. I try to continue enjoying doing that. Whether the team picks me or not is a thing which will be seen later, but right now my aim is to give more than 100 per cent of my efforts.” Saha’s re-emergence as a maximiser of power-play began in fag end of IPL 2020, smashing 214 runs and striking at 139.86 with two half-centuries. Though Gujarat picked him late in the mega auction, Saha waited for his turn to open and hasn’t looked back since then. He reckons having a relaxed environment in the Gujarat set-up is bringing the best out of everyone. “In my playing experience, the dressing room environment of the Gujarat Titans is one of the best I have ever been in. Because of this, the team bonding and the interactions within the players are great, which helps in delivering results on the field.” “Plus, we can go freely and speak to anyone like Ashish Nehra, Gary Kirsten, like if someone goes to speak to them at 1-2 a.m., they will still talk to you very well. Also, on being called a youngster (in team videos), these small moments of laughter happen in team meetings. The more environment is kept light, the better we are able to deliver on the field.” Apart from being the powerplay enforcer and being a selfless contributor in Gujarat’s success, Saha is also doubling up as a guiding figure to K.S. Bharat, who made his Test debut as a wicketkeeper-batter in this year’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy and in all likelihood, will don the same role for the World Test Championship final at The Oval from June 7-11. “We have been together in IPL this year only. Before that, we have been together in the Indian team camp, as well as in the India A setup. We discuss a lot of things about batting, keeping, the drills and approach to be taken, as well as in making improvements as a human being.” “I have spoken to Bharat on a lot of things and he’s discussed with me on how his keeping was in last series and what more can be done to enhance it. When we do the drills here, he’s working on his skills step-by-step and he will improve day-by-day in those areas.” “I haven’t played a Test match for India in England, but I did play in India A games there. So, I have that experience as well as of being with the team for two-three tours, when Dhoni bhai and Rishabh (Pant) were playing. I have shared all of my experiences with Bharat. Hopefully, he contributes for the team,” he concluded. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:32:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“He's one of those players who can come back and win us a game” - PBKS bowling coach Charl Langeveldt backs Sam Curran","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-he-s-one-players-can-come-back-win-us-game-pbks-bowling-coach-charl-langeveldt-backs-sam-curran","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Renin Wilben Albert"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:21:17","image_url":"https://staticc.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/05/580fa-16836153608344-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland-Bangladesh washout seals South Africa’s World Cup spot","link":"https://a-sports.tv/ireland-bangladesh-washout-south-africa-world-cup/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","Top News","Top Picks","ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023","South Africa qualify for World Cup"],"creator":["A Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"CHELMSFORD: The first ODI of the ongoing three-match series between Ireland and Bangladesh was abandoned due to persistent rain here and ended the hosts’ hopes for automatic qualification to the 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup.

The washout, however, turned out to be very fortunate for South Africa as they edged Ireland in the Cricket World Cup Super League points table and booked their spot in this year’s mega event. The most recent changes in the race for automatic spots had come after Sri Lanka’s unsuccessful series against New Zealand, and South Africa’s two recent wins over the Netherlands in a home series. South Africa gave themselves every opportunity to automatically qualify for this year’s ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in their last home series against the Netherlands. The Proteas’ series victory propelled them past the West Indies into the eighth and final slot in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League standings. However, their prospects of automatic qualification were still dependent on Ireland’s ODIs against Bangladesh. A 3-0 series victory for Ireland would have tied them on points with South Africa if no penalty points were awarded. The net run rate would still have come into play for the last slot, but since Ireland’s first ODI against Bangladesh was called off on Tuesday, the Proteas have secured their place in the World Cup. Meanwhile, Ireland will have to play the Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June. Teams – Qualified for ICC Men’s ODI World Cup: India (hosts), New Zealand, England, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa. Cricket World Cup Qualifier Teams: 10 (West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland, Oman, Nepal, USA, UAE).

Wobei, so brutal wie in Kapfenberg und Simmering geht es im Derby della Madonnina wohl auch nicht zu, steht doch das Spiel zwischen den beiden Stadtklubs im Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seit jeher unter der Schirmherrschaft der Gottesmutter. Laut Volksmund wacht sie als goldene Statue auf einer Spitze des Mailänder Doms darüber, dass sich Spieler und Fans benehmen. Aber vielleicht sind sich Rossoneri und Nerazzurri gerade deshalb so spinnefeind, weil sie Zwillinge sind? Beide Vereine gingen aus demselben Klub hervor - dem 1899 gegründeten Milan Cricket and Football Club. Das lief einige Zeit gut, bis sich 1908 mehrere Mitglieder abspalteten und ihren eigenen Fußballverein - den Football Club Internazionale Milano - gründeten. Sie waren darüber verärgert, dass beim nationalistisch ausgerichteten Milan CFC nur Italiener spielen durften. Mit dem Zusatz Internazionale wollte man die Offenheit des Vereins für ausländische Spieler betonen. Real Madrid - Manchester City AC Milan - Inter Mailand Mi., 21 Uhr/Servus-TV Rückspiele am 16./17. Mai Heute freilich gehören Legionäre auf beiden Seiten zur Normalität. Das erste Duell zwischen Inter und Milan war im Übrigen eine der wenigen Partien, die nicht in Mailand stattfanden. Am 8. Oktober 1908 trafen die frisch getrennten Geschwister beim Freundschaftsturniers Coppa Chiasso im Schweizer Chiasso aufeinander. Die Derby-Premiere entschied der Associazione Calcio Milan mit 2:1 für sich. Das erste Match in Mailand stieg am 10. Jänner 1909. Das Stadion Giuseppe Meazza, das die Fans aber lieber nach dem Stadtteil San Siro nennen, wurde 1926 errichtet und dient seither dem Derby della Madonnina als Spielstätte. Sie trägt den Namen eines der populärsten und erfolgreichsten Stürmer der nationalen Fußballgeschichte. Mit 284 Treffern ist Meazza Rekordtorschütze seines langjährigen Vereins Inter Mailand und liegt in der ewigen Bestenliste der Torschützen der Serie A mit 216 Toren neben José Altafini auf dem vierten Platz. Die Arena, die seit 1978 Meazzas Namen trägt, steht im Übrigen im Eigentum der beiden rivalisierenden Klubs, die es im Unterschied zu 1860 München und dem FC Bayern geschafft haben, ihr Haus gemeinsam zu bestellen. Aktuell fasst das Stadion San Siro rund 76.000 Zuschauer, und auch beim Derby della Madonnina am Mittwochabend (21 Uhr/ Servus-TV) wird das Oval bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt sein. Für die Stadtrivalen Inter und Milan geht es um nicht viel weniger als den Einzug ins Finale der Königsklasse. Und das will was heißen, wartet doch die italienische Fußballnation seit Inters Triumph im Jahr 2010 auf einen Champions-League-Sieg. Vor 13 Jahren setzten sich die Nerazzurri unter Jose Mourinho in ihrer Triple-Saison die europäische Krone auf. Marko Arnautovic konnte in seinem Jahr in Mailand zumindest eine knappe Stunde in der Liga mitwirken, in der Champions League kam der damals 21-Jährige nie zum Zug. Milan wartet noch länger auf eine Teilnahme in einem Champions-League-Finale. 2007 holten sich die Rossoneri letztmals den Titel. \"Wir werden alles rundherum genießen bis Mittwoch 20.59 Uhr, und dann müssen wir bereit sein. Wir müssen dieses Prickeln fühlen\", sagte Milans Trainer Stefano Pioli über die Stimmung in der Metropole. Das Euroderby wurde ausgerufen. \"Es ist nicht nur ein Derby, es ist DAS Derby\", hielt Inters Coach Simone Inzaghi fest. Er warnte vor zu viel Übermut: \"Was das Herz angeht, habe ich keine Zweifel. Was den Kopf angeht, wäre es gut, wenn wir ihn benutzen und uns erinnern, dass über 180 Minuten auf uns warten.\" Es ist das 236. Duell, in der Bilanz die Nase vorne hat derzeit Inter. Das Rückspiel steigt am 16. Mai erneut im San Siro. Schon jetzt ist fix, dass sich Italiens Fußball nach Jahren mit ausbleibenden Erfolgen wieder über einen Champions-League-Finalisten freuen darf. Juventus stand 2015 und 2017 im Endspiel, verlor gegen den FC Barcelona beziehungsweise Real Madrid aber beide. Eine Favoritenrolle lässt sich wiederum noch nicht ausmachen. In der Serie A ist Inter Vierter, AC Milan Fünfter und damit außerhalb der Startplätze für die kommende Champions League. Zwei Zähler trennen die beiden Nachbarn. Dreimal trafen die Klubs in dieser Saison aufeinander. Im Supercup siegte Inter in Saudi-Arabien mit 3:0, in der Liga gab es jeweils einen Erfolg von Milan sowie von Inter. Pioli und Inzaghi gaben jedenfalls an, sich nicht als Favorit zu fühlen. Das Mailänder Duell um das Finalticket der Königsklasse gab es bereits vor 20 Jahren. 2003 spielten Andrij Schewtschenko, Paolo Maldini oder Filippo Inzaghi für Milan, Inter bot Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti und Hernan Crespo auf. 0:0 und 1:1 endeten die Partien. Milan stieg dank Schewtschenkos Auswärtstor auf und holte im rein-italienischen Endspiel gegen Juventus im Elfmeterschießen den Titel. Zu einer inneritalienischen Angelegenheit wird das große Finale am 10. Juni in Istanbul nicht werden. Das zweite Finalticket matchen sich Real und Manchester City aus (nach Redaktionsschluss).","pubDate":"2023-05-09 15:28:34","image_url":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_cache/image/1xURJYMHxM6mbj4AbNIfUbRBez3yhI7mQgbAGMdMiT8lMpvXX9H8KQL-2RcfG6X9jn5xldgk87rhv6Yme4GxPfzB0506QqqzkCKIOdjLvXOpCzWHKWAeR0tj6IYA66RSbBrO1Y2LcACF1i9KJ3W_fGmzigPXGRqwvzy0sE_kv_L3SGtQqn57H0RwRZgZY_fdgaxGLhVJB7A6_kyN8ZdlEOH8--kVLxQB2D/230509_1733_948_0900_434789_italy_feature_heritage_achitecture.jpg","source_id":"wienerzeitung","category":["sports"],"country":["austria"],"language":"german"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/rajasthan-royals-pacer-trent-boult-expresses-desire-to-play-2023-odi-world-cup-in-india/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports IPL 2023: Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India Trent Boult opted out of New Zealand central contracts last year in August to spend more time with family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world.\r Trent Boult is currently playing for Rajasthan Royals […]","content":"Home Sports IPL 2023: Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India Trent Boult opted out of New Zealand central contracts last year in August to spend more time with family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world.\r Trent Boult is currently playing for Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2023. (Image: BCCI) Jaipur: New Zealand pacer Trent Boult still has a big desire to play in the upcoming ODI World Cup in India later in the year despite having opted out of the central contract. Boult also stated that he has seen ‘little bit of movement’ in that direction of late. One of the best left-arm pacers in the world, Boult opted out of the New Zealand contract last year in August in order to give more time to his family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world. The last time Boult played for New Zealand was during the T20 World Cup last year with selectors preferring to give contracted players more opportunities. “I’ve still got that big desire to play for New Zealand. It is what it is: I’ve made my decision. “I’ve been lucky enough to have a 13-year career in the Black Cap and hey, I’ve still got a big desire to play in the World Cup as well,” the 33-year-old told ESPNCricinfo. “We’ll see how that unfolds: there’s still a bit of movement in the landscape at the moment,” added the Rajasthan Royals pacer. Boult feels New Zealand stand a good chance in the ICC event scheduled in October-November. New Zealand lost the 2019 final to hosts England in the most dramatic fashion. “I remember after the 2019 final, I said to Kane (Williamson) that we’ve got to be there again, come 2023 in India. It’s a shame with what’s going on with his knee but he’ll be working as hard as he can to try and get there. It’s such a great tournament… One hundred percent, I’ve got that desire to be out there,” he said referring to the injury Williamson suffered at the start of IPL. “We’re a great one-day side. We’ve got some players that have travelled to India and experienced the conditions a lot, and that’s what it comes down to in World Cups. You can’t buy experience, and you can’t replace players that have toured for however many years across these conditions.” Published Date: May 9, 2023 5:44 PM IST Updated Date: May 9, 2023 5:47 PM IST --> Comments - Join the Discussion --> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:30:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Hosting international events is our right’ Sarfaraz Ahmed","link":"https://a-sports.tv/hosting-international-events-is-our-right-sarfaraz-ahmed/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","Top News","Top Picks","Asia Cup 2023","Sarfaraz Ahmed"],"creator":["ali.hassan"],"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed has come out in support of the country’s hosting right of the 2023 Asia Cup – scheduled later this year -, claiming, it is ‘our right to host international events’.

The wicket-keeper batter said every major cricketing nation had toured Pakistan since the return of international cricket to its shore, adding, there was no excuse left for any team refusing to come to Pakistan. “Our players and law enforcement agencies made tireless efforts to bring cricket back to Pakistan,” he said on Tuesday during the inauguration of Jinnah College Cricket Stadium here in Karachi. “Many international teams have visited Pakistan so I don’t think there is any excuse left for any country not to send their team to our country.” Moreover, Sarfaraz Ahmed stressed that Asian Cricket Council and International Cricket Council should take measures to bring all the teams to Pakistan for the international tournaments scheduled in Pakistan. The 35-year-old also urged India to visit Pakistan for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 since the people of the country eagerly wanted to see the blockbuster rivalry on their home soil. “Pakistan is a great host. India should come to Pakistan,” he said. It must be noted here that the fate of the upcoming Asia Cup hung in balance after India refused to send their team to Pakistan in October last year on political grounds and has since been trying to shift the tournament to a neutral venue. Earlier, a report emerged that the two cricket boards were gradually moving towards a compromise and had nearly agreed to host India’s matches on a neutral venue while the rest of the tournament will be played in Pakistan. As per the latest development, however, the BCCI has refused the hybrid proposal for both events and once again demanded to shift the Asia Cup entirely from Pakistan. The two rival boards will further discuss the matter within the ACC platform to decide the fate of the six-team event.

The in-form batter had been named the ICC Men’s Player of the Month after a stunning month in April. “He [Zaman] beat out tough competition from Sri Lanka spin wizard Prabath Jayasuriya, and emerging New Zealand batter Mark Chapman,” a press release by ICC stated. The ICC said that Fakhar led the charge for Pakistan as they pulled off their second-highest ODI run-chase in Rawalpindi late in the month. The opener smashed an unbeaten 180 to help Pakistan chase down a target of 337 against the visiting New Zealand side to go 2-0 up in the series. Fakhar’s knock came with 17 boundaries and six massive sixes as Pakistan won with 10 balls to spare in a high-scoring contest. This was the left-hander’s second ton in as many matches during April with his 117 off 114 balls helping Pakistan chase down 289 in the first game at the same venue. Fakhar led the run-chase from the onset, only being dismissed in the 43rd over, by when Pakistan were well on their way to chase down the winning score. He won the Player of the Match award for his efforts. The left-hander started the month with a rapid 47 in the first T20I in Lahore against New Zealand, playing a part in the home side’s thumping 88-run victory. While he didn’t click in the next two T20I matches, Fakhar stormed into form in ODIs, a format he has always thrived in Fakhar now has 3,148 ODI runs at an average of 49.71 and a strike-rate of almost 95 during his 67-match career and the Pakistan opener said it was a great thrill to claim the coveted award. ‘Truly an honour’ “It is truly an honour for me to be named ICC Player of the Month for April,” Fakhar said. “This month has been one of the highlights of my career and it was an amazing feeling to play in front of my own people in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi,” he said. Sharing his personal favourite: the hard-hitting batter said: “I really enjoyed scoring back-to-back centuries in Rawalpindi, but my favourite was the 180 not out in the second match. “I hope to continue the momentum leading into the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, and make Pakistan cricket fans happy and proud with my performances.”","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:11:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Not Virat Kohli, Sunny Leone Picks Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings As Favourites","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/not-virat-kohli-sunny-leone-picks-mahendra-singh-dhoni-chennai-super-kings-as-favourites/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Not Virat Kohli!

However, will Pakistan actually participate in the mega event? Speculations are rife that the country may skip the event. What has led to these rumors? The Indian government has said that they will not allow their team to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup 2023, leading to the assumption that the hardliner government will not allow the Pakistani team to play in India. The mega event of International Cricket Council (ICC) is set to take place in India, with broadcasters eyeing the potential of huge revenues from an India vs Pakistan match. However, will the Pakistan team get permission to travel to India in the light of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s recent statement given during a trip to India? “Sports should be kept separated from politics and foreign policy,” the FM had stated during his visit to attend the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. Earlier reports had claimed that Pakistan will play its World Cup matches in Ahmedabad in Narendra Modi stadium in Gujrat. “Pakistan may not agree to play against India at Narendra Modi Stadium due to certain reasons,” a source has disclosed, without discussing further details on the matter before the announcement of the official schedule. It must be noted here that International Cricket Council (ICC) hasn’t announced the schedule for the World Cup so far. The mega event will take place in October-November this year in India. A reliable source in PCB has also denied reports regarding their demand from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to give them a guarantee in writing that if Pakistan goes to India for ICC World Cup, then they will come here for ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.

Published: May 9, 2023 4:56 PM IST By IANS Wriddhiman Saha […]","content":"Ahmedabad: On Sunday, in the Gujarat Titans-Lucknow Super Giants match at the Narendra Modi Stadium, openers from both teams scored half-centuries. But undoubtedly Wriddhiman Saha continued his power-play brilliance since last year’s IPL by smashing a dazzling 81 off 43 balls. With the ball coming nicely onto the bat, Saha was effortlessly toying with the lines and lengths of Lucknow’s bowlers, especially of Avesh Khan and Mohsin Khan, making 54 out of the hosts’ 78 runs in power-play, bringing up his fifty in 20 balls and setting the base for Gujarat to bat Lucknow out of the game. For someone who began his IPL career in the middle order and hit a century in an IPL final while coming at number four, Saha has now adapted quietly and quickly to the role of power-play enforcer for Gujarat, where he has a strike rate of 137.18 in IPL 2023. “Since childhood, I had the nature of hitting the ball hard even if the circle is up. Yes, when I started in the IPL, I was batting at number six or seven in KKR, CSK. Sometimes chances came of opening the batting or playing in the top order. Even when I was at Punjab Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad, I played a lot of innings at the top of the order.” “Looking at my cricket, the team management thought that I can play selflessly and fearlessly as well as take advantage of playing in power-play. There, the thinking of team management and my style of play matched, which has made life easy in terms of contributing to the team and helping in them doing well,” he said on his adaptability while going through various roles in IPL in a virtual interaction organised by the franchise. With Saha doing great in IPL 2023 and averaging 52.16 for Tripura in Ranji Trophy, many felt he would have been the ideal fit as K.L. Rahul’s replacement in India’s World Test Championship final squad. While that hasn’t happened, Saha, who has 40 Test caps, said he had no such thoughts about it. “Right now, I am playing franchise cricket, which is the IPL. So, I am thinking of my IPL team first. Regarding other things, it’s not in my hand and I don’t even think about it.” With a controlling the controllable mindset and not pondering over the uncontrollable elements, Saha is now eyeing to enjoy whatever roles are assigned to him in whatever is left in his playing career. “As I am getting older and my cricketing career is almost at its last phase, when I started out playing cricket as an individual, it began out of enjoyment. As of now, that enjoyment continues to be there, be it be at domestic or IPL.” “Another thing is, being able to contribute to the team and enjoying doing my physical activities. I try to continue enjoying doing that. Whether the team picks me or not is a thing which will be seen later, but right now my aim is to give more than 100 per cent of my efforts.” Saha’s re-emergence as a maximiser of power-play began in fag end of IPL 2020, smashing 214 runs and striking at 139.86 with two half-centuries. Though Gujarat picked him late in the mega auction, Saha waited for his turn to open and hasn’t looked back since then. He reckons having a relaxed environment in the Gujarat set-up is bringing the best out of everyone. “In my playing experience, the dressing room environment of the Gujarat Titans is one of the best I have ever been in. Because of this, the team bonding and the interactions within the players are great, which helps in delivering results on the field.” “Plus, we can go freely and speak to anyone like Ashish Nehra, Gary Kirsten, like if someone goes to speak to them at 1-2 a.m., they will still talk to you very well. Also, on being called a youngster (in team videos), these small moments of laughter happen in team meetings. The more environment is kept light, the better we are able to deliver on the field.” Apart from being the powerplay enforcer and being a selfless contributor in Gujarat’s success, Saha is also doubling up as a guiding figure to K.S. Bharat, who made his Test debut as a wicketkeeper-batter in this year’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy and in all likelihood, will don the same role for the World Test Championship final at The Oval from June 7-11. “We have been together in IPL this year only. Before that, we have been together in the Indian team camp, as well as in the India A setup. We discuss a lot of things about batting, keeping, the drills and approach to be taken, as well as in making improvements as a human being.” “I have spoken to Bharat on a lot of things and he’s discussed with me on how his keeping was in last series and what more can be done to enhance it. When we do the drills here, he’s working on his skills step-by-step and he will improve day-by-day in those areas.” “I haven’t played a Test match for India in England, but I did play in India A games there. So, I have that experience as well as of being with the team for two-three tours, when Dhoni bhai and Rishabh (Pant) were playing. I have shared all of my experiences with Bharat. Hopefully, he contributes for the team,” he concluded. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:32:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“He's one of those players who can come back and win us a game” - PBKS bowling coach Charl Langeveldt backs Sam Curran","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-he-s-one-players-can-come-back-win-us-game-pbks-bowling-coach-charl-langeveldt-backs-sam-curran","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Renin Wilben Albert"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:21:17","image_url":"https://staticc.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/05/580fa-16836153608344-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ireland-Bangladesh washout seals South Africa’s World Cup spot","link":"https://a-sports.tv/ireland-bangladesh-washout-south-africa-world-cup/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","Top News","Top Picks","ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023","South Africa qualify for World Cup"],"creator":["A Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"CHELMSFORD: The first ODI of the ongoing three-match series between Ireland and Bangladesh was abandoned due to persistent rain here and ended the hosts’ hopes for automatic qualification to the 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup.

The washout, however, turned out to be very fortunate for South Africa as they edged Ireland in the Cricket World Cup Super League points table and booked their spot in this year’s mega event. The most recent changes in the race for automatic spots had come after Sri Lanka’s unsuccessful series against New Zealand, and South Africa’s two recent wins over the Netherlands in a home series. South Africa gave themselves every opportunity to automatically qualify for this year’s ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in their last home series against the Netherlands. The Proteas’ series victory propelled them past the West Indies into the eighth and final slot in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League standings. However, their prospects of automatic qualification were still dependent on Ireland’s ODIs against Bangladesh. A 3-0 series victory for Ireland would have tied them on points with South Africa if no penalty points were awarded. The net run rate would still have come into play for the last slot, but since Ireland’s first ODI against Bangladesh was called off on Tuesday, the Proteas have secured their place in the World Cup. Meanwhile, Ireland will have to play the Qualifiers in Zimbabwe in June. Teams – Qualified for ICC Men’s ODI World Cup: India (hosts), New Zealand, England, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa. Cricket World Cup Qualifier Teams: 10 (West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland, Oman, Nepal, USA, UAE).

Wobei, so brutal wie in Kapfenberg und Simmering geht es im Derby della Madonnina wohl auch nicht zu, steht doch das Spiel zwischen den beiden Stadtklubs im Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seit jeher unter der Schirmherrschaft der Gottesmutter. Laut Volksmund wacht sie als goldene Statue auf einer Spitze des Mailänder Doms darüber, dass sich Spieler und Fans benehmen. Aber vielleicht sind sich Rossoneri und Nerazzurri gerade deshalb so spinnefeind, weil sie Zwillinge sind? Beide Vereine gingen aus demselben Klub hervor - dem 1899 gegründeten Milan Cricket and Football Club. Das lief einige Zeit gut, bis sich 1908 mehrere Mitglieder abspalteten und ihren eigenen Fußballverein - den Football Club Internazionale Milano - gründeten. Sie waren darüber verärgert, dass beim nationalistisch ausgerichteten Milan CFC nur Italiener spielen durften. Mit dem Zusatz Internazionale wollte man die Offenheit des Vereins für ausländische Spieler betonen. Real Madrid - Manchester City AC Milan - Inter Mailand Mi., 21 Uhr/Servus-TV Rückspiele am 16./17. Mai Heute freilich gehören Legionäre auf beiden Seiten zur Normalität. Das erste Duell zwischen Inter und Milan war im Übrigen eine der wenigen Partien, die nicht in Mailand stattfanden. Am 8. Oktober 1908 trafen die frisch getrennten Geschwister beim Freundschaftsturniers Coppa Chiasso im Schweizer Chiasso aufeinander. Die Derby-Premiere entschied der Associazione Calcio Milan mit 2:1 für sich. Das erste Match in Mailand stieg am 10. Jänner 1909. Das Stadion Giuseppe Meazza, das die Fans aber lieber nach dem Stadtteil San Siro nennen, wurde 1926 errichtet und dient seither dem Derby della Madonnina als Spielstätte. Sie trägt den Namen eines der populärsten und erfolgreichsten Stürmer der nationalen Fußballgeschichte. Mit 284 Treffern ist Meazza Rekordtorschütze seines langjährigen Vereins Inter Mailand und liegt in der ewigen Bestenliste der Torschützen der Serie A mit 216 Toren neben José Altafini auf dem vierten Platz. Die Arena, die seit 1978 Meazzas Namen trägt, steht im Übrigen im Eigentum der beiden rivalisierenden Klubs, die es im Unterschied zu 1860 München und dem FC Bayern geschafft haben, ihr Haus gemeinsam zu bestellen. Aktuell fasst das Stadion San Siro rund 76.000 Zuschauer, und auch beim Derby della Madonnina am Mittwochabend (21 Uhr/ Servus-TV) wird das Oval bis auf den letzten Platz gefüllt sein. Für die Stadtrivalen Inter und Milan geht es um nicht viel weniger als den Einzug ins Finale der Königsklasse. Und das will was heißen, wartet doch die italienische Fußballnation seit Inters Triumph im Jahr 2010 auf einen Champions-League-Sieg. Vor 13 Jahren setzten sich die Nerazzurri unter Jose Mourinho in ihrer Triple-Saison die europäische Krone auf. Marko Arnautovic konnte in seinem Jahr in Mailand zumindest eine knappe Stunde in der Liga mitwirken, in der Champions League kam der damals 21-Jährige nie zum Zug. Milan wartet noch länger auf eine Teilnahme in einem Champions-League-Finale. 2007 holten sich die Rossoneri letztmals den Titel. \"Wir werden alles rundherum genießen bis Mittwoch 20.59 Uhr, und dann müssen wir bereit sein. Wir müssen dieses Prickeln fühlen\", sagte Milans Trainer Stefano Pioli über die Stimmung in der Metropole. Das Euroderby wurde ausgerufen. \"Es ist nicht nur ein Derby, es ist DAS Derby\", hielt Inters Coach Simone Inzaghi fest. Er warnte vor zu viel Übermut: \"Was das Herz angeht, habe ich keine Zweifel. Was den Kopf angeht, wäre es gut, wenn wir ihn benutzen und uns erinnern, dass über 180 Minuten auf uns warten.\" Es ist das 236. Duell, in der Bilanz die Nase vorne hat derzeit Inter. Das Rückspiel steigt am 16. Mai erneut im San Siro. Schon jetzt ist fix, dass sich Italiens Fußball nach Jahren mit ausbleibenden Erfolgen wieder über einen Champions-League-Finalisten freuen darf. Juventus stand 2015 und 2017 im Endspiel, verlor gegen den FC Barcelona beziehungsweise Real Madrid aber beide. Eine Favoritenrolle lässt sich wiederum noch nicht ausmachen. In der Serie A ist Inter Vierter, AC Milan Fünfter und damit außerhalb der Startplätze für die kommende Champions League. Zwei Zähler trennen die beiden Nachbarn. Dreimal trafen die Klubs in dieser Saison aufeinander. Im Supercup siegte Inter in Saudi-Arabien mit 3:0, in der Liga gab es jeweils einen Erfolg von Milan sowie von Inter. Pioli und Inzaghi gaben jedenfalls an, sich nicht als Favorit zu fühlen. Das Mailänder Duell um das Finalticket der Königsklasse gab es bereits vor 20 Jahren. 2003 spielten Andrij Schewtschenko, Paolo Maldini oder Filippo Inzaghi für Milan, Inter bot Fabio Cannavaro, Javier Zanetti und Hernan Crespo auf. 0:0 und 1:1 endeten die Partien. Milan stieg dank Schewtschenkos Auswärtstor auf und holte im rein-italienischen Endspiel gegen Juventus im Elfmeterschießen den Titel. Zu einer inneritalienischen Angelegenheit wird das große Finale am 10. Juni in Istanbul nicht werden. Das zweite Finalticket matchen sich Real und Manchester City aus (nach Redaktionsschluss).","pubDate":"2023-05-09 15:28:34","image_url":"https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_cache/image/1xURJYMHxM6mbj4AbNIfUbRBez3yhI7mQgbAGMdMiT8lMpvXX9H8KQL-2RcfG6X9jn5xldgk87rhv6Yme4GxPfzB0506QqqzkCKIOdjLvXOpCzWHKWAeR0tj6IYA66RSbBrO1Y2LcACF1i9KJ3W_fGmzigPXGRqwvzy0sE_kv_L3SGtQqn57H0RwRZgZY_fdgaxGLhVJB7A6_kyN8ZdlEOH8--kVLxQB2D/230509_1733_948_0900_434789_italy_feature_heritage_achitecture.jpg","source_id":"wienerzeitung","category":["sports"],"country":["austria"],"language":"german"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/rajasthan-royals-pacer-trent-boult-expresses-desire-to-play-2023-odi-world-cup-in-india/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports IPL 2023: Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India Trent Boult opted out of New Zealand central contracts last year in August to spend more time with family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world.\r Trent Boult is currently playing for Rajasthan Royals […]","content":"Home Sports IPL 2023: Rajasthan Royals Pacer Trent Boult Expresses Desire To Play 2023 ODI World Cup In India Trent Boult opted out of New Zealand central contracts last year in August to spend more time with family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world.\r Trent Boult is currently playing for Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2023. (Image: BCCI) Jaipur: New Zealand pacer Trent Boult still has a big desire to play in the upcoming ODI World Cup in India later in the year despite having opted out of the central contract. Boult also stated that he has seen ‘little bit of movement’ in that direction of late. One of the best left-arm pacers in the world, Boult opted out of the New Zealand contract last year in August in order to give more time to his family and play lot of franchise cricket around the world. The last time Boult played for New Zealand was during the T20 World Cup last year with selectors preferring to give contracted players more opportunities. “I’ve still got that big desire to play for New Zealand. It is what it is: I’ve made my decision. “I’ve been lucky enough to have a 13-year career in the Black Cap and hey, I’ve still got a big desire to play in the World Cup as well,” the 33-year-old told ESPNCricinfo. “We’ll see how that unfolds: there’s still a bit of movement in the landscape at the moment,” added the Rajasthan Royals pacer. Boult feels New Zealand stand a good chance in the ICC event scheduled in October-November. New Zealand lost the 2019 final to hosts England in the most dramatic fashion. “I remember after the 2019 final, I said to Kane (Williamson) that we’ve got to be there again, come 2023 in India. It’s a shame with what’s going on with his knee but he’ll be working as hard as he can to try and get there. It’s such a great tournament… One hundred percent, I’ve got that desire to be out there,” he said referring to the injury Williamson suffered at the start of IPL. “We’re a great one-day side. We’ve got some players that have travelled to India and experienced the conditions a lot, and that’s what it comes down to in World Cups. You can’t buy experience, and you can’t replace players that have toured for however many years across these conditions.” Published Date: May 9, 2023 5:44 PM IST Updated Date: May 9, 2023 5:47 PM IST --> Comments - Join the Discussion --> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:30:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Hosting international events is our right’ Sarfaraz Ahmed","link":"https://a-sports.tv/hosting-international-events-is-our-right-sarfaraz-ahmed/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports","Top News","Top Picks","Asia Cup 2023","Sarfaraz Ahmed"],"creator":["ali.hassan"],"video_url":null,"description":"KARACHI: Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed has come out in support of the country’s hosting right of the 2023 Asia Cup – scheduled later this year -, claiming, it is ‘our right to host international events’.

The wicket-keeper batter said every major cricketing nation had toured Pakistan since the return of international cricket to its shore, adding, there was no excuse left for any team refusing to come to Pakistan. “Our players and law enforcement agencies made tireless efforts to bring cricket back to Pakistan,” he said on Tuesday during the inauguration of Jinnah College Cricket Stadium here in Karachi. “Many international teams have visited Pakistan so I don’t think there is any excuse left for any country not to send their team to our country.” Moreover, Sarfaraz Ahmed stressed that Asian Cricket Council and International Cricket Council should take measures to bring all the teams to Pakistan for the international tournaments scheduled in Pakistan. The 35-year-old also urged India to visit Pakistan for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 since the people of the country eagerly wanted to see the blockbuster rivalry on their home soil. “Pakistan is a great host. India should come to Pakistan,” he said. It must be noted here that the fate of the upcoming Asia Cup hung in balance after India refused to send their team to Pakistan in October last year on political grounds and has since been trying to shift the tournament to a neutral venue. Earlier, a report emerged that the two cricket boards were gradually moving towards a compromise and had nearly agreed to host India’s matches on a neutral venue while the rest of the tournament will be played in Pakistan. As per the latest development, however, the BCCI has refused the hybrid proposal for both events and once again demanded to shift the Asia Cup entirely from Pakistan. The two rival boards will further discuss the matter within the ACC platform to decide the fate of the six-team event.

The in-form batter had been named the ICC Men’s Player of the Month after a stunning month in April. “He [Zaman] beat out tough competition from Sri Lanka spin wizard Prabath Jayasuriya, and emerging New Zealand batter Mark Chapman,” a press release by ICC stated. The ICC said that Fakhar led the charge for Pakistan as they pulled off their second-highest ODI run-chase in Rawalpindi late in the month. The opener smashed an unbeaten 180 to help Pakistan chase down a target of 337 against the visiting New Zealand side to go 2-0 up in the series. Fakhar’s knock came with 17 boundaries and six massive sixes as Pakistan won with 10 balls to spare in a high-scoring contest. This was the left-hander’s second ton in as many matches during April with his 117 off 114 balls helping Pakistan chase down 289 in the first game at the same venue. Fakhar led the run-chase from the onset, only being dismissed in the 43rd over, by when Pakistan were well on their way to chase down the winning score. He won the Player of the Match award for his efforts. The left-hander started the month with a rapid 47 in the first T20I in Lahore against New Zealand, playing a part in the home side’s thumping 88-run victory. While he didn’t click in the next two T20I matches, Fakhar stormed into form in ODIs, a format he has always thrived in Fakhar now has 3,148 ODI runs at an average of 49.71 and a strike-rate of almost 95 during his 67-match career and the Pakistan opener said it was a great thrill to claim the coveted award. ‘Truly an honour’ “It is truly an honour for me to be named ICC Player of the Month for April,” Fakhar said. “This month has been one of the highlights of my career and it was an amazing feeling to play in front of my own people in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi,” he said. Sharing his personal favourite: the hard-hitting batter said: “I really enjoyed scoring back-to-back centuries in Rawalpindi, but my favourite was the 180 not out in the second match. “I hope to continue the momentum leading into the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, and make Pakistan cricket fans happy and proud with my performances.”","pubDate":"2023-05-09 13:11:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"thefrontierpost","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Not Virat Kohli, Sunny Leone Picks Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings As Favourites","link":"https://www.thetimesofbengal.com/sports/not-virat-kohli-sunny-leone-picks-mahendra-singh-dhoni-chennai-super-kings-as-favourites/","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["admin"],"video_url":null,"description":"Home Sports Not Virat Kohli!

However, will Pakistan actually participate in the mega event? Speculations are rife that the country may skip the event. What has led to these rumors? The Indian government has said that they will not allow their team to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup 2023, leading to the assumption that the hardliner government will not allow the Pakistani team to play in India. The mega event of International Cricket Council (ICC) is set to take place in India, with broadcasters eyeing the potential of huge revenues from an India vs Pakistan match. However, will the Pakistan team get permission to travel to India in the light of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s recent statement given during a trip to India? “Sports should be kept separated from politics and foreign policy,” the FM had stated during his visit to attend the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. Earlier reports had claimed that Pakistan will play its World Cup matches in Ahmedabad in Narendra Modi stadium in Gujrat. “Pakistan may not agree to play against India at Narendra Modi Stadium due to certain reasons,” a source has disclosed, without discussing further details on the matter before the announcement of the official schedule. It must be noted here that International Cricket Council (ICC) hasn’t announced the schedule for the World Cup so far. The mega event will take place in October-November this year in India. A reliable source in PCB has also denied reports regarding their demand from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to give them a guarantee in writing that if Pakistan goes to India for ICC World Cup, then they will come here for ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.

Published: May 9, 2023 4:56 PM IST By IANS Wriddhiman Saha […]","content":"Ahmedabad: On Sunday, in the Gujarat Titans-Lucknow Super Giants match at the Narendra Modi Stadium, openers from both teams scored half-centuries. But undoubtedly Wriddhiman Saha continued his power-play brilliance since last year’s IPL by smashing a dazzling 81 off 43 balls. With the ball coming nicely onto the bat, Saha was effortlessly toying with the lines and lengths of Lucknow’s bowlers, especially of Avesh Khan and Mohsin Khan, making 54 out of the hosts’ 78 runs in power-play, bringing up his fifty in 20 balls and setting the base for Gujarat to bat Lucknow out of the game. For someone who began his IPL career in the middle order and hit a century in an IPL final while coming at number four, Saha has now adapted quietly and quickly to the role of power-play enforcer for Gujarat, where he has a strike rate of 137.18 in IPL 2023. “Since childhood, I had the nature of hitting the ball hard even if the circle is up. Yes, when I started in the IPL, I was batting at number six or seven in KKR, CSK. Sometimes chances came of opening the batting or playing in the top order. Even when I was at Punjab Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad, I played a lot of innings at the top of the order.” “Looking at my cricket, the team management thought that I can play selflessly and fearlessly as well as take advantage of playing in power-play. There, the thinking of team management and my style of play matched, which has made life easy in terms of contributing to the team and helping in them doing well,” he said on his adaptability while going through various roles in IPL in a virtual interaction organised by the franchise. With Saha doing great in IPL 2023 and averaging 52.16 for Tripura in Ranji Trophy, many felt he would have been the ideal fit as K.L. Rahul’s replacement in India’s World Test Championship final squad. While that hasn’t happened, Saha, who has 40 Test caps, said he had no such thoughts about it. “Right now, I am playing franchise cricket, which is the IPL. So, I am thinking of my IPL team first. Regarding other things, it’s not in my hand and I don’t even think about it.” With a controlling the controllable mindset and not pondering over the uncontrollable elements, Saha is now eyeing to enjoy whatever roles are assigned to him in whatever is left in his playing career. “As I am getting older and my cricketing career is almost at its last phase, when I started out playing cricket as an individual, it began out of enjoyment. As of now, that enjoyment continues to be there, be it be at domestic or IPL.” “Another thing is, being able to contribute to the team and enjoying doing my physical activities. I try to continue enjoying doing that. Whether the team picks me or not is a thing which will be seen later, but right now my aim is to give more than 100 per cent of my efforts.” Saha’s re-emergence as a maximiser of power-play began in fag end of IPL 2020, smashing 214 runs and striking at 139.86 with two half-centuries. Though Gujarat picked him late in the mega auction, Saha waited for his turn to open and hasn’t looked back since then. He reckons having a relaxed environment in the Gujarat set-up is bringing the best out of everyone. “In my playing experience, the dressing room environment of the Gujarat Titans is one of the best I have ever been in. Because of this, the team bonding and the interactions within the players are great, which helps in delivering results on the field.” “Plus, we can go freely and speak to anyone like Ashish Nehra, Gary Kirsten, like if someone goes to speak to them at 1-2 a.m., they will still talk to you very well. Also, on being called a youngster (in team videos), these small moments of laughter happen in team meetings. The more environment is kept light, the better we are able to deliver on the field.” Apart from being the powerplay enforcer and being a selfless contributor in Gujarat’s success, Saha is also doubling up as a guiding figure to K.S. Bharat, who made his Test debut as a wicketkeeper-batter in this year’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy and in all likelihood, will don the same role for the World Test Championship final at The Oval from June 7-11. “We have been together in IPL this year only. Before that, we have been together in the Indian team camp, as well as in the India A setup. We discuss a lot of things about batting, keeping, the drills and approach to be taken, as well as in making improvements as a human being.” “I have spoken to Bharat on a lot of things and he’s discussed with me on how his keeping was in last series and what more can be done to enhance it. When we do the drills here, he’s working on his skills step-by-step and he will improve day-by-day in those areas.” “I haven’t played a Test match for India in England, but I did play in India A games there. So, I have that experience as well as of being with the team for two-three tours, when Dhoni bhai and Rishabh (Pant) were playing. I have shared all of my experiences with Bharat. Hopefully, he contributes for the team,” he concluded. $(document).ready(function(){ $('#commentbtn').on(\"click\",function(){ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=178196885542208\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); $(\".cmntbox\").toggle(); }); }); Source link","pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:32:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"the_tob","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“He's one of those players who can come back and win us a game” - PBKS bowling coach Charl Langeveldt backs Sam Curran","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/news-he-s-one-players-can-come-back-win-us-game-pbks-bowling-coach-charl-langeveldt-backs-sam-curran","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["Renin Wilben Albert"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2023-05-09 12:21:17","image_url":"https://staticc.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/05/580fa-16836153608344-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"}]}
