As is now the norm, Surya played his brand of cricket, which is to use the pace, go after the bowling, attack mercilessly but with smart shots in odd parts of the ground, and got to 68 off only 40 balls. The rest of the team put together made 57 off 80 balls, with eight extras taking India to 133. Agencies When a team of batting superstars reinvents their collective approach to the game over a year, methodically giving up the checks and balances that had been the foundation of their style of play, you are going to get some spectacular results. There will be days when the lineup will chase down scores that they have no business doing. There will be days when good bowlers in the opposition camp will execute their plans and be taken to the cleaners. But, there will also be days in which there is a crash and burn, and you must accept this because when you live by the sword you will also die by it. The key is that the method should win you more than it costs and it should not be something that gets in the way of lifting the team in a big match or a knockout. On a cold Sunday evening in Perth, even Suryakumar Yadav ’s spark could not kindle a fire bright enough to get India to a big score. It was one of those days, on a pitch with a bit of juice against a fast bowling attack that knew just where to put the ball. As is now the norm, Surya played his brand of cricket, which is to use the pace, go after the bowling, attack mercilessly but with smart shots in odd parts of the ground, and got to 68 off only 40 balls. The rest of the team put together made 57 off 80 balls, with eight extras taking India to 133. Every cricket coach tells young batsmen that the first thing they should learn is to value their wicket, and put a price on it. Now, in Twenty20 cricket, this is hardly feasible at the international level. The game has moved on at a rapid pace, but coaching methods at various levels have not necessarily kept up. While younger players are playing more freely and fearlessly, using shots that that one generation before them would have thought sacrilege, it has taken a lot of work for the likes of Virat Kohli to get into this mode. Kohli being Kohli has found a way that works, in the most recent past. Having embraced the philosophy that the team management has laid out, Kohli is taking more risks, playing more shots than he might have earlier, even if he is doing so after setting up a base. Rohit Sharma has come out swinging, and the results have not quite been there for him. In his last 10 matches, Rohit has endured scores of 11, 17, 0, 0, 4 and 15, but in that time, he has had four decent scores, including 72 from 41 balls, 46 not out in 20, 43 in 37 and 53 in 39. What Rohit has done is sacrifice the big scores to set the tone at the top of the innings. He’s setting the example of what he wants his batsmen to do. But, it’s time to talk about KL Rahul . At one point India’s leading T20 batsman — and his overall numbers are still impressive: 68 matches, 2150 runs, strike rate 139.42, 2 hundreds and 20 halfcenturies — he now looks like someone caught between a rock and a hard place. On the day, Rahul, who was poking and blocking amidst launching one short ball over the on side, opened the face of the bat to Lungi Ngidi, steered the ball straight to the lone slip fielder, and then walked away shaking his head as though he had been undone by some spell cast by a sorcerer. Rahul, who has every shot in the game and then some, is the vicecaptain of the team, and it would be fair to say that he was involved in formulating the new expressive and risk-taking batting approach that the team has come up with. Yet, this is not quite reflected in how he has approached his batting. The flourish that you associate with Rahul at his best is missing, how he sets off for the first run is tentative and he is often watching the ball rather than pushing hard and his choice of shots has been poor. Almost all of these point to a mind preoccupied with things other than just playing the ball at hand. Rohit has stressed the need to stay in the present. Rahul needs to do that at the crease, otherwise, it may soon become difficult even for his position as vice-captain from stopping him from being rested, benched, or worse.

PERTH, Australia, Oct 30, (AP): David Miller overcame bowling friendly conditions to help South Africa beat India by five wickets in the 2022 T20 World Cup on Sunday as Pakistan and Bangladesh also secured victories. Miller scored 59 not out off 46 balls to shepherd South Africa to 137-5 (19.4 overs) in reply to India’s 133-9 (20 overs). Lungi Ngidi took 4-29 to help restrict the Indian score, while Suryakumar Yadav scored a counter-attacking 68 off 40 balls. Earlier, Shadab Khan took three wickets and then hit the winning runs as Pakistan beat Netherlands by six wickets with six overs to spare, finally posting a victory at the Twenty20 World Cup. Pakistan lost in a last-ball thriller in their tournament opener against archrivals India and were upset by Zimbabwe before a thumping win over the Dutch to start a Group 2 doubleheader in Perth. South Africa are now atop group 2 with five points while India are now down to second with their first defeat in three games. Pakistan are fifth in the Group 2 standings, and Netherlands have been knocked out of contention after three consecutive losses in the Super 12 stage. However, India’s loss also means Pakistan now have to beat South Africa on Thursday in Sydney to stay alive in the tournament. In the day’s other game in Brisbane, Bangladesh held on to beat Zimbabwe by three runs in the Group 2 clash after a dramatic last over that produced two wickets and an unusual no-ball that meant the last delivery had to be re-bowled. In the Western Australian capital, Ngidi was named player of the match for helping South Africa beat India in an ICC event for the first time since 2011. Opting to bat, India ran into Ngidi who ripped up its batting order with a four-wicket burst. Rohit Sharma (15) top-edged after facing a short ball barrage while Lokesh Rahul (9) was caught at slip four balls later. Kagiso Rabada held two tricky catches at fine leg to help dismiss both Virat Kohli (12) and Hardik Pandya (2). India was rocked by pace and bounce, reduced to 49-5 in 8.3 overs. Anrich Nortje (1-23) dismissed Deepak Hooda (0) for a three-ball duck in between. Yadav provided resistance with a counter-attacking half-century off 30 balls. He smacked six fours and three sixes to resurrect the Indian innings and put on 52 runs off 40 balls with Dinesh Karthik, who only contributed six runs to the sixth-wicket partnership. Then Wayne Parnell initiated a double breakthrough, sending back Karthik and Ashwin (7) as India floundered again. South Africa went from 3-2 to 24-3 as Mohammed Shami had Temba Bavuma (10) caught behind. But Markram and Miller resisted the fl ow of wickets, adding 76 runs off 60 balls for the fourth wicket. Markram hit six fours and a six to bring up his half-century off 38 balls. He survived two major chances. Virat Kohli dropped him in the deep off Ravichandran Ashwin in the 12th over, and Sharma missed an easy runout thereafter. Miller reached his half-century off 40 deliveries, upping the ante with four fours and three sixes. Yadav finally held a catch to dismiss Markram, but it was too late. Ashwin also trapped Tristan Stubbs (6) lbw to make it 122-5. Despite the breakthrough, India had no response for the calm Miller who finished off the game with two balls to spare. In Brisbane, Bangladesh, with four competition points from three games, moved past Zimbabwe with a dramatically narrow win in warm, sunny conditions. Opener Najmul Hossain Shanto scored 71 from 55 balls in Bangladesh’s total of 150-7. Sean Williams (64) and Ryan Burl (27 not out) took it close, but couldn’t get Zimbabwe over the line. Spinner Musaddek Hossain held his nerve twice, in particular after the players were recalled to the field to re-bowl the last delivery, and helped restrict Zimbabwe to 147-8. Bangladesh’s players celebrated early when Musaddek appeared to wrap up the last over with consecutive stumping dismissals. But replays showed wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan took the ball in front of the stumps before whipping off the bails to complete the dismissal of Blessing Muzarabani. In the Perth opener, Pakistan’s pace attack restricted Netherlands to 91-9, with Shadab taking 3-22 and Mohammad Wasim Jr. returning 2-15. Netherlands had won the toss and opted to bat but couldn’t cope with Pakistan’s quick bowlers and slumped quickly to 26-3. Colin Ackermann (27) tried rebuilding the innings but Shadab ran through the middle order and Wasim Jr. narrowly missed his hat trick toward the end. He had dismissed Tim Pringle (5) and Fred Klaassen (0) off successive balls. Only two Dutch players scored in double digits. Pakistan replied with a sedate innings and knocked up the runs in 13.5 overs, finishing with 95-4. Mohammad Rizwan scored 49 off 39 balls, combining with Fakhar Zaman (20) in a 37-run second-wicket stand after Pakistan skipper Babar Azam (4) was run out. This post has been read 1344 times!

After what started as a the four-time champion IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings (CSK) this year in place of the legendary MS Dhoni, spiraled down with him relinquishing the responsibility with the team almost eliminated from the season. To make it worse, not only did Dhoni had to don the franchise skipper hat yet again, but the flamboyant allrounder from Saurashtra also was ruled out of the season post that due to a rib injury. Post the end of IPL 2022 the relationship between Jadeja and the CSK management have only gone South, with the former deleting all his previous CSK-related posts across his social media handles, and also not taking part in any of CSK’s activities post the season. CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan had however, went on to rubbish the reports of a dent in relationship between Jadeja and the management, or that of with a player from another franchise. A report however, from last month, suggested that Ravindra Jadeja might well be traded with the Delhi Capitals (DC), although the DC players in contention were not disclosed by the website. However, as per a new report, CSK are likely to trade Jadeja with two Indian internationals in Shardul Thakur and Axar Patel from the Delhi Capitals (DC). While there is no clarification on part of the CSK management on the aforementioned report, DC do need an Indian spin-bowling allrounder in their squad with Lalit Yadav as the lone option in that department. Jadeja, therefore is more than a handy option on that front. Having said that, leaving out Axar Patel from the squad might well not turn out to be a wise decision, owing to his recent allround form, especially with the ball in hand. The trade window of players will remain open till one week before the auction and will re-open post it. For those unaware, the ahead of the 16th season of the league, will take place most probably in mid-December this year.","pubDate":"2022-10-30 18:18:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“Suryakumar Yadav is the best middle-order batsman in T20 cricket” Misbah-ul-Haq says he hasn’t seen a knock like this","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/suryakumar-yadav-is-the-best-middle-order-batsman-in-t20-cricket-misbah-ul-haq-8239548/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"Suryakumar Yadav’s 68 off 40 balls on a pacy Perth track against South Africa when the next highest Indian score was 15 has caught the eye of the world.

Yes, he assesses the conditions and the bowlers well and decides what shots can work. He also plays with the minds of the bowlers. He knows what the bowler will bowl: this one will be outside off, this one will be short or at me. I would give the example of AB de Villiers here.

The result at Ray Finlayson Sporting Complex was Hannans’ second loss in three matches to open the season after electing to bat on a pitch that offered plenty for the opposition bowlers. Patrick Gorman (12 of 20 balls) and Vinnie Keynes (10 off 27 balls) were the top-scorers on a lean day with the bat for Hannans as Two Blues recruit Vaibhav Khangaonker continued an impressive start to his EGCA career with 3-19. He was supported by Josh Rushmore (2-11) and Nick Grubelich (2-15). Khangaonker’s three matches have produced seven wickets at 6.43, but the former Gosnells first-grader will miss a substantial chunk of cricket because of studies at the WA School of Mines. In reply, Great Boulder compiled 1-66 in 17 overs. Danny Tebble (28 off 40 balls) and Jace Reilly (24 off 47 balls) were the main contributors. Great Boulder player-coach Dylan Hinchliffe said he had intended to bat first, had he won the toss. “We were lucky in a couple of ways,” he said. “I think it was probably a good toss to lose yesterday (Saturday) because I think we would have batted first. “But as it played out, there was a little bit in the wicket for the first 10 overs of the morning with the new ball. “The fact we were able to sneak a result in before the rain came helped, too.” Hinchliffe praised an attack he said was not outstanding, but approached each match with a clear plan. “We basically just bowl to the same plan we do every weekend,” he said. “Some weeks, you have a game like we did this time against Hannans and others, those plans don’t necessarily come off for you. “It’s the luck of the draw a bit and things mostly went our way against Hannans after we executed our plans pretty well. “It’s probably more a case of us not having a standout (bowler), but everyone turns up to the ground knowing that they need to do for us to win games.” Great Boulder are striving to go one better this summer after dominating last season’s qualifiers before lowering their colours to Hannans in the final.

The West Australian can reveal that Langer, as committed and single-minded as any Australian cricketer, is to be elevated on November 7 as just the 12th Legend in the WA Hall of Champions. In a wide-ranging interview in which the 51-year-old opened up about his shock sacking as Australian coach last February and revealed the biggest influences in his success, he said he could barely compute being added to a select group that included his personal inspirations such as Dennis Lillee and Ric Charlesworth. “Everyone would say the same thing, that it is incredibly humbling, but actually it is,” Langer said. Aaron Kirby Jay Rooney Mitchell Woodcock “A lot of those Legends were my all-time heroes when I was growing up and also had a big impact on my life for different reasons. What I love most is that someone has seen it and thought about it and thought I’d be a good person to be in there. That’s a really nice accolade.” Langer’s senior debut for Scarborough as a teenager came alongside now-fellow Legend Lillee on October 3, 1987. His first ball faced was bowled by WA great Terry Alderman and former Australian captain Kim Hughes was at first slip for Subiaco-Floreat. It was about that time Lillee revealed to a starry-eyed Langer and other younger players one day at the WACA that his three secrets to success were work hard, work hard and work hard. But it was earlier, in the 1981 Boxing Day Test match against the West Indies, when the fast-bowling superstar ignited Langer’s passion. “It’s one of my favourite moments in sport,” he said. “Dennis is running in and they’re chanting ‘Lillee, Lillee’ and he bowls Viv Richards with the last ball of the day. We were in our cabana at our house in Duncraig and the Langer family are going nuts, jumping up and down and high-fiving. “I was 11 years old and that’s the moment I wanted to play Test cricket.” And it was after one of his greatest moments at the crease — when he and Adam Gilchrist combined in 1999 to help record the third-highest successful run chase in Test history, on the fifth day against Pakistan in Hobart — that Charlesworth delivered a telling lesson. Langer was finally out with just five runs to win, and described it as his “Pat Cash moment”, heading back to the pavilion with 127 runs and feeling similar euphoria to the 1987 Wimbledon champion. But a few days later, still feeling chuffed, he copped a sharp, unexpected rebuke from Charlesworth at a dinner in Perth. “I’m strutting around like Viv Richards thinking the world doesn’t get any better than this and he looked up at me while he was eating his dinner and said, ‘What the f..k do you think you were doing?’,” Langer recalled. “He said, ‘Champions don’t make those mental errors, you got out with five runs to go and didn’t get the job done’ and then turned around and kept eating his dinner. I had Ric Charlesworth on my shoulder every single innings I played after that. “It was a magic moment in my life and it kept me grounded.” When asked about the toughest time in his career, it was little wonder Langer landed on the final six months of his coaching stint before he was axed by Cricket Australia. Remarkably, in that same time period, he was named Wisden Cricket Coach of the Year, led Australia to a first T20 World Cup and an emphatic Ashes victory over England and restored the national team to the No.1 mantle in Test cricket. Despite the extraordinary success, he said he felt support gradually drifting from him, even though it had been regularly confirmed to his face. “I value loyalty and I value friendship and I value camaraderie ... it was just a really weird time and no one would give me a straight answer,” he said. “I love my players, they’re like my sons, and I kept hearing these whispers and it became like a bushfire. I was talking to all these players and there was nothing to see here, but obviously there was. It was bizarre. “Then when I left, the messages I got from 90 per cent of the players were enough to make you cry and that’s why it didn’t make any sense. But I learned some great lessons from it and it’s given me another two years of speaking material about teams and culture.” Still, Langer said he had embraced his new era with far less time away from home and lots more time with his family. Spending time at Scarborough’s home ground, now known as Justin Langer Oval at Abbett Park, also brought back warm memories, such as rewarding himself for a big score with a big bag of cheese-flavoured Twisties in the car park. “I got a few,” he joked. It also reminded him of what he had to do to get the vast success that included 7696 runs in 105 Tests for Australia, with 23 centuries. “There was so much insecurity and self-doubt,” he admitted. “But I was always super fit because that was one thing I could control. I also learnt how to meditate in 1993 and I’ve meditated every day since. And I learned about what else I could control and I could control my balance and seeing the ball out of the bowler’s hand. The day I retired was the biggest relief in the world because I never had to think about my stance ever again. “I used to go crazy thinking about my batting stance. I knew that if I had my nose right there (straight at the bowler), I couldn’t get out. Your mind just had to be disciplined enough to remember it.” Langer cited hitting a six to bring up his century against England in the 2002 Boxing Day Test at the MCG as his most special career highlight. He described it as a slow-motion moment that was simply unforgettable. “It was my favourite moment because for three seconds in my life, I knew something that no one else knew,” he said. “I knew it was going for six and I’m looking up and already getting my arms up, while the crowd was still watching. There’s no better feeling and everyone else had to wait for it.” Langer said he had fielded six head coaching offers in the past six months, but had not considered them. He said the best advice he had heeded — and which had become more important than ever in a modern era of immediate expectation — was around the value of patience, which he believed was a great asset to any aspiring youngster. “Kids these days are all in a hurry ... they want to be the CEO before they make the coffee, or be Steve Smith before they’re playing club cricket,” he said. “Apprenticeships are so important because you’ve got to do the work and it takes time. The accolades usually look after themselves if you stay focused and you’re true to yourself and you master the art that you’re blessed with. “The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.” Langer said his Hall elevation honour was testament to the support of his wife Sue and their four daughters, his father Colin and his late mother Joy-Anne, who lost her battle with ovarian cancer in 2017.

In an intriguing clash at Wallace Park, Norths opener Michael Noble blasted an unbeaten 111 that was ultimately in vain after rain limited his team’s run chase to 26.5 overs. Noble struck 14 boundaries and four sixes off 94 balls in 100 minutes after Norths were set 256 to win. Norths finished at 7-165, with Noble the shining light after the chase initially stuttered to 2-15. The real hero, though, was Verma, a former Canada under-19 representative in just his second game for Lake View whose classy 96 off 58 deliveries guided them to 9-255. It was a pivotal innings by Verma, who needed just 69 minutes while flaying Norths’ attack for six fours and nine sixes. Verma and new player-coach Dave Roberts (58 off 58 balls in 68 minutes) are leading what the Viewers’ supporters hope is a new era for a group that has finished last every season since claiming the 2016-217 flag. Verma, 21, is a vital addition for Lake View who chalked up an unbeaten 42 against the West Indians in early 2020 in a warm-up match for the ICC under-19 World Cup. Roberts is delighted to have lured Verma to the Goldfields, but the length of his stay is uncertain. “I was able to pick him up (as a prize recruit) just through a few people I know,” Roberts said. “Originally, we weren’t sure if we were going to get him, but he and our English recruit (Tristan Elam) happen to be mates. “He (Verma) missed the first game and I don’t know about the long-term, but we have him for this season which is good. “He’ll go back to England for our winter and has more of a plan outside (the Goldfields) that I think is the 2024 World Cup for Canada. “Playing in the Carribean League is a goal so long-term he’s probably not going to be here. “But hopefully he enjoys it out here and we get two seasons out of him. “Our focus at the moment is to enjoy him while we’ve got him here.” Outside his own talents, Roberts said Verma would be a great tactical support for himself and as a respected mentor for the rest of the squad. “He’s a top bloke and has only been here two weeks, but already fits in with all the blokes like he’s been here for years,” Roberts said. “All the boys get around him and it’s definitely handy to have a player of his calibre as perhaps someone a bit different to what the club might normally get and who motivates the boys on his own.” Norths’ pair Jake Dickinson and Tim Henderson each grabbed three wickets, but the side struggled with the bat in reply as yet another key Lake View recruit, Luke Boxhall, wielded a big influence with 5-26. Norths have lost their past two matches since beating reigning A-grade premiers Hannans in round one.

India failed to defend 133 to succumb to their first defeat in the Super 12 stage of T20 World Cup 2022. India captain that the team was poor on the field and that's an are of the game where they need improvement. Notably, Virat Kohli dropped a sitter in the 12th over of India's defence, handing Aiden Markram a reprieve. Rohit Sharma then missed a straightforward run-out chance to dismiss Markram in the following over. Markram, who was handed a reprieve on 35, went on to hit a match-winning 52, stitching a 76-run stand with David Miller. South Africa recovered from 24 for 3 to as Miller and Markram put immense pressure on the Indian fielders with their running between the wickets. \"I think, in cricket, you are going to have situations where catches are going to be dropped, run-out opportunities missed. What you really going to see is that we didn't score enough runs. On a pitch like this where there is going to be a little bit of a challenge for battes, I think you have got to play it smartly. I don't think we played smart enough cricket because if you had played smart cricket, we would have had a 150 on the board,\" he added. As Sunil Gavaskar pointed out, India paid the price for an ordinary batting display. Suryakumar Yadav hit a stunning 40-ball 68, scoring more than half of India's total after the big guns, including captain Rohit and Kohli, failed to get going. Lungi Ngidi tore into India's top-order, dismissing Rohit, KL Rahul, Kohli and Hardik Pandya while Deepak Hooda, who was included in the XI in place of Axar Patel, threw his wicket away for 0 while trying to attack Anrich Nortje. India slipped to 49 for 5 before Suryakumar stitched a 52-run stand with Dinesh Karthik. However, Karthik played a shot that he could have avoided in the 16th over, falling for 6 off 15 deliveries, putting the pressure on his partner Suryakumar. \"For example, some of the dismissals that we saw show that they were perhaps concerned about the pace and bounce on the pitch and therefore trying to do something different. But it was difficult to do something different against a quality attack,\" Gavaskar said. \"I have been stressing about playing an extra batter but Deepak Hooda tried to attack in his 3rd delivery when he had Suryakumar Yadav at the other end. He had to play smart cricket. \"Similarly, I think, Karthik getting out at that stage. I am not blaming them, I am saying generally saying that apart from Suryakumar Yadav, nobody played the kind of cricket with the experience that they had that would have helped us get those 15-20 runs more,\" he added. Despite the loss to South Africa, India's chances of reaching the semi-finals remain intact. The Asian giants next face Bangladesh on November 2 in Adelaide and Zimbabwe on November 6 in Melbourne and Gavaskar says India can't take their next two opponents lightly. \"Yes, let's not press the panic button at all. We have 4 points and 2 matches to go. 2 matches against opponents we should be able to win. You should never taken any team lightly, Bangladesh have given us a run for the money in T20Is. So we have to be careful against them, even Zimbabwe, the way they have played in this World Cup, we have to be careful,\" Gavaskar said.","pubDate":"2022-10-30 17:17:57","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"T20 World Cup: Axar misses out, Hooda in as India opt to bat against South Africa","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/t20-world-cup-axar-misses-out-hooda-in-as-india-opt-to-bat-against-south-africa-767310","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"India have won both their opening games in T20 World Cup 2022Axar Patel picked up 2 wickets against NetherlandsSouth Africa defeated Bangladesh by 104 runs in their previous game","content":"India have picked batting all-rounder Deepak Hooda instead of Axar Patel in their Super 12 fixture against South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2022. After failing to make a breakthrough against Pakistan at Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), Axar finished with figures of 2 for 18 in Sydney against Netherlands. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss on Sunday at Perth Stadium and opted to bat against the Proteas. Meanwhile, Tabraiz Shamsi was dropped and fast bowler Lungi Ngidi was included, handing him his first game of the ongoing tournament. India spent a week in Perth ahead of the T20 World Cup and which is why the team is confident of what to expect from the pitch, according to Indian skipper Rohit. \"We will bat. It's a good surface, we know what to expect and what to do on this pitch. We had a camp across at the WACA, which helped us get used to the bounce for both batters and the bowlers. But this is an important game from where the tournament is, we just have to follow the routine and trust the process, just stay calm and execute the plans. One change - Axar misses out, Hooda is in,\" said Rohit at the toss. Meanwhile, South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma said he expects to see his fast bowlers exploit the Perth pitch that usually favours pace. The Proteas have a win and a no result from their two games so far. \"Big game for us, have had a good start to the tournament, it's a big opportunity to test our skills against a strong Indian team. We would have probably batted as well, could be slightly tough to bat under lights, but we now need to bowl well and restrict them to a low score. The conditions are similar to what we have at home and it's a surface that our pacers can exploit. One change - Shamsi misses out, Ngidi comes in,\" said Bavuma ahead of their Super 12 game on Sunday. India batsman Suryakumar Yadav, who played a match-winning knock of an unbeaten 51 off 25 balls in their previous match against Netherlands, said that he has been backing himself to do well since the beginning of the T20 World Cup 2022 Down Under. \"I have been backing myself since the start of the tournament. We had a 10-day camp in Perth as well. I knew that the wickets here will be bouncy and quick, so I have my plans. Really looking forward to the game today. (On the practice camp) You get to know what the conditions are, you get to bat on this kind of wickets and then field as well under lights. There shouldn't be any complacency, you have to start from zero. Fresh game, big game for both the teams, really gonna love it. The quick wickets and bounce - that has been helping me really well. Yes the grounds are big but at the same time the challenge is completely different, you got to have your own plans. I just want to go out and enjoy,\" said Surya.

In the ongoing T20 World Cup, Kohli has already played two great knocks. The epic 82 against Pakistan and a fifty against the Netherlands. He did not perform against South Africa, but his body language and timing showed that he is in good touch. In this article today, we'll analyse how Virat Kohli fares against different kinds of bowlers. From right-arm pacers to wrist spinners, here's how the former Indian captain performs. Virat Kohli averages 38 against a right-arm pacer. His strike rate is 138 and the majority of his runs, as is the case always, come from running between the wickets. His dot ball percentage is 33, which is the 2nd highest among all kinds of bowlers. More often than not, Virat Kohli falls to a right-arm pacer. He has been dismissed 145 times in 310 innings. Virat Kohli plays the most dot balls against a left-arm pacer and his boundary percentage falls a per cent below that of his numbers against a right-arm pacer. He averages 30 and his strike rate is 133. There isn't much difference between his numbers against a right or a left-arm pacer. But looking at the numbers, Kohli seems more comfortable against a right-arm pacer. Coming to left-arm spinners, we have pretty interesting numbers here. Virat Kohli averages the highest against a left-arm pacer, but his strike rate is the lowest. 59 per cent of his runs come from running the between the wickets and his boundary per cent falls to just 11. The fact that he has just gotten out 29 times out of 145 times against a pacer is the reason he averages a massive 66.65. The numbers aren't much different when it comes to a right-arm spinner. His average, however, falls to 51.54 and his strike rate jumps 10 points. Among spinners, Virat Kohli targets wrist spinners the most. His strike rate is 138, and 59 per cent of hs runs come from running between the wickets. His boundary percentage against wrist spinners is 14, which is the highest among all kinds of spinners. Virat Kohli performs the best against a wrist spinner. He rotates the strike and hits the ball more often than not. He doesn't even get out easily, falling just 33 times in 162 innings. Kohli is in red-hot form in the ongoing World Cup and if he can keep up the good work, India can really be the invincibles of the tournament.","pubDate":"2022-10-30 17:06:31","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Phillips, Boult steer New Zealand to big win over Sri Lanka in T20 World Cup","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/phillips-boult-steer-new-zealand-to-big-win-over-sri-lanka-in-t20-world-cup-620874","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Phillips slammed a magnificent century while left-arm fast bowler Trent Boult picked four wickets in career-best figures to lead New Zealand to a commanding 65-run victory","content":"SYDNEY: Middle-order batter Glenn Phillips slammed a magnificent century while left-arm fast bowler Trent Boult picked four wickets in career-best figures to lead New Zealand to a commanding 65-run victory over Sri Lanka in their Group 1 match of Super 12 stage in the T20 World Cup at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. After Phillips made 104 off 64 balls, laced with 10 fours and four sixes, and shared an 84-run stand with Daryl Mitchell to lift New Zealand from 15/3 to 163/7, Boult and Tim Southee reduced Sri Lanka to 8/4 in 3.3 overs. Though Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Dasun Shanaka threatened with some big hits, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 102 in 19.2 overs. Saturday's victory now sees New Zealand at the top of the table in Group 1 with five points in three matches and edge one step closer to sealing a place in the semifinals. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, stay on two points from three matches. The 65-run victory is also New Zealand's biggest winning margin against Sri Lanka in terms of runs in T20Is. Electing to bat first, New Zealand were in trouble in the powerplay, losing openers Finn Allen, Devon Conway (dismissed by Maheesh Theekshana) and Kane Williamson (falling to Kasun Rajitha), leaving New Zealand at 15/3 in four overs. A partnership of 84 was then built by Glenn Phillips and a returning Mitchell (22 off 24 balls), getting New Zealand out of trouble. After steadying the ship, Phillips then upped his strike rate, smashing some brilliant shots as Sri Lanka were hugely hampered by indisciplined bowling and poor fielding, including dropped catches. Eventually, Phillips, after being dropped twice by the Sri Lanka fielders on 12 and 45, brought up his second T20I hundred, scoring a breathtaking 104 off only 64 balls, hitting 10 fours and four massive sixes in his brilliant knock. He was also well-supported by Mitchell Santner (11 not out) at the end as New Zealand fetched a whopping 113 runs off the last 10 overs. In reply, the New Zealand experienced fast-bowling duo of Southee and Boult bamboozled Sri Lanka's top four in 3.3 overs, which soon became 58/6 in ten overs. Rajapaksa (34 off 22 balls) entertained with some big shots, while Shanaka (35 off 32 balls) also kept the maximums coming. But the duo fell, unable to stay at the crease for as long as Sri Lanka would have liked. The New Zealand spin twins, Santner and Ish Sodhi chipped in with two wickets each, as they bowled out their opposition teams back-to-back in T20 World Cup matches for the first time, and boost their chances of reaching the semifinals with a huge spike in the net run rate, now at 3.85.

Coming into the playing eleven for the match against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Hand claimed figures of 1/17, including the wicket of all-rounder Ben Stokes as his delivery found the gap between bat and pat to hit the stumps and contribute in Ireland's famous five-run win. Now, Hand is keen to see the side carry the momentum forward into the final two Super 12 matches, first of which is against Australia on Monday at The Gabba. \"It was an amazing experience playing at the MCG — even better playing against England. Even though a few days have passed, I don't think it has still fully sunk in.\" \"My first ball — which was a wide down legside — actually gave me confidence with the movement and swing that it had on it. The second ball was something I had only dreamed of bowling. Ben Stokes is obviously a world-class batter and major threat, so to get one through him early on was brilliant,\" Hand was quoted as saying in an official Cricket Ireland release. Hand's celebration — a spontaneous release of pure emotion — became an iconic scene in subsequent match highlights. \"The celebration, yeah, I've been told I ran a mile. It's one of those moments you just go with your feelings and emotions. The energy behind that certainly gave me the belief that we had a chance, and that's what you need in this sport at times. \"After an unbelievable start by Josh (Little) taking two top wickets, I'm just very glad I was able to add to that, make an impact and most importantly help the team. It was just my third game for Ireland, and first in a World Cup — I had been thinking that even if I didn't play, the chance to just be part of a World Cup squad has been absolutely fantastic. I am very grateful for the captain and coach to give me a chance and the backing to play.\" After the heights of Wednesday's match against England, Friday's wash-out against Afghanistan was frustrating but Hand indicates the squad is focused on what they need to achieve. \"I have to admit that it was a huge let down that the Afghanistan game was abandoned because of the rain — but no one can control the weather, it's just part-and-parcel of our game. \"Having played the Afghans in a recent five-match series —and coming out on top with a series win — we were keen to back up the England win with another good performance. But as frustrating as it was on Friday, we have two huge games ahead against Australia and New Zealand. \"After the wins over Scotland, West Indies and England, who knows what we can achieve. We have huge belief as a group, including the great support staff we have around us.\" IANS Also Read: Men's T20 World Cup: Rabada, Nortje can help South Africa to win this tournament, reckons Steyn Also Watch:","pubDate":"2022-10-30 15:54:13","image_url":"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2022/10/30/407753-3imok44t.jpg","source_id":"sentinel","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Abu Dhabi T10 League: Deccan Gladiators to face Abu Dhabi in season opener","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/abu-dhabi-t10-league-deccan-gladiators-to-face-abu-dhabi-in-season-opener-620868","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Deccan Gladiators will face home favourites Team Abu Dhabi on November 23 in Abu Dhabi T10 League at the iconic Zayed Cricket Stadium.","content":"ABU DHABI: Reigning champions Deccan Gladiators will face home favourites Team Abu Dhabi on November 23 in Abu Dhabi T10 League at the iconic Zayed Cricket Stadium.

A frustrated Rossouw, who played for South Africa in the white ball cricket from 2014-16 including the 50-over World Cup in 2015 and the T20 World Cup in India one year later, signed the Kolpak deal with English county Hampshire in 2017 and lost the chance to represent his country again. But things changed around once the no-deal Brexit happened and he returned to play cricket in South Africa . The 33-year-old Bloemfontein-born hard-hitting batsman, who followed up his century against India at Indore in the three-match bilateral T20 series with the blistering innings of 109 in just 56 balls against Bangladesh, was also recalled to the South African national white ball team. In the intervening time he missed five years of international cricket and as some sort of a vengeance has struck back to back T20 International hundreds, with tons scored in the last match at Indore and in Sydney against Bangladesh. Roussouw will be one of the key batsmen from the South African ranks who is expected to be discussed threadbare by the Indian team's think tank going into tomorrow's match here in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Rossouw, who had also played in the 2008 under 19 World Cup along with India's Virat Kohli, rated the century that he scored against India earlier this month as pretty special.

Zimbabwe couldn't play last year's World Cup and this year the team has come through the qualifier. Asked whether the ICC should look at a scenario where teams like Zimbabwe and Namibia play directly with 12 or 16 teams, Ervine said, \"I think going forward, obviously for us to play the qualifiers back in Zimbabwe and then coming to the (T20) World Cup to play another qualifiers is quite strenuous on the heart. I think for all the supporters and the country, as well, to have to go through both qualifiers to get into the World Cup (is tough on the players and supporters). But I think the statement is already there that us lesser teams belong in the World Cup.\" Zimbabwe are placed third in the group following the shocking win against Pakistan and the side sharing points with South Africa due to the abandonment of play. They take on Bangladesh here with a good chance of beating the side and brightening their chance of making the last-4 grade. Ervine added that by beating Pakistan, Zimbabwe was not trying to make a statement for Associate nations but was urging the ICC to involve some lesser-known teams in a better manner to liven up tournaments like the T20 World Cup. \"Look, I don't think that we're trying to put a statement out there. I think that with the upset between us and Pakistan and the upset between Ireland and England, I think the statement is already out there. It would be really good to involve some of the lesser teams because it creates that bit of excitement around the World Cup, especially when you do have the upsets, and it opens both groups up really nicely,\" said Ervine. On Zimbabwe's chance of making the semifinal from their Super 12 group, Ervine said he was quite positive about it. \"Look, we've got a huge chance to make the semis. Again, it requires us to win against Bangladesh and also to beat Netherlands, and then we've got our final game against India, and depending on some other results. But we can't look too far ahead right now.

It was not a great day in office for Virat Kohli, skipper Rohit and even Hardik Pandya. KL Rahul continued to have a horrible T20 World Cup. He scored just 9 off 14 balls that included just one six. Not to forget, Rahul has had low scores vs Pakistan and Zimbabwe earlier too. It was all thanks to this incredible effort from Suryakumar that India managed to put up a fighting total on the scoreboard. If India lose this match, they will have a tough road to qualify. They will need to win both their remaining matches to ensure their semi-finals chances don't get hurt.

On October 30, three matches were scheduled in the super 12 league of the World Cup. Three Asian countries Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India were scheduled to play their matches against Zimbabwe, Netherlands, and South Africa respectively. For Pakistan to survive in the tournament, it was necessary for Pakistan to win against the Netherlands. Not only this, Pakistan’s fate is dependent on the results of the other two matches. Pakistan cannot advance in the World Cup unless Bangladesh defeats Zimbabwe and India win against South Africa.

Another batting prodigy has burst into the spotlight, with Ashley Chandrasinghe compiling an old-fashioned century on Sheffield Shield debut over the weekend. The talented left-hander scored an unbeaten 119 (333) against Tasmania at Hobart’s Bellerive Oval on Sunday, guiding Victoria to 7/351 declared in the first innings. Watch the Weber WBBL. Every game live and ad-break free during play on Fox Cricket, available on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > After one-Test wonder Will Pucovski stepped away from cricket for personal reasons last week, a vacancy opened for Chandrasinghe in Victoria’s Sheffield Shield starting XI. Former Australian Test opener Chris Rogers presented the rookie contracted 20-year-old with Victoria’s 870th cap on Saturday morning, and less than an hour later he was walking out for his maiden first-class innings. Chandrasinghe expertly weathered the storm on day one, respecting the disciplined bowling of former Australian seamers Jackson Bird, Peter Siddle and Riley Meredith. He combined with captain Peter Handscomb for a 157-run partnership for the third wicket before the Victorian skipper departed on Saturday afternoon for 95. But Chandrasinghe carried on the following morning, reaching triple figures with a textbook straight drive down the ground. Glorious. Another young gun replenishing Australiaâs batting stocks. Chandrasinghe + Wyllie are creating a bright future. ð https://t.co/glZUkGVSJ9 — Oliver Peterson (@oliverpeterson) October 30, 2022 His 311-ball century was the slowest in the Sheffield Shield since Tasmanian captain Jordan Silk needed 341 deliveries to reach the milestone against Queensland in March 2013. It was also the second-slowest Sheffield Shield century for a Victorian, narrowly behind Shawn Craig’s 316-ball ton against Tasmania in January 1999. Chandrasinghe modelled his batting technique off modern greats Michael Hussey and Kumar Sangakkara, and he undeniably boasts their temperament and patience when at the crease, making just one run from his first 49 balls against Tasmania. “It was good to get away first ball, put away a few nerves,” Chandrasinghe said at stumps. “It was pretty tough going to get my next run. They bowled pretty well to me, I thought.” After he was dumped from the Victorian state pathways in 2019, Chandrasinghe decided to ply his trade in the Northern Territory; an unusual choice considering the federal territory doesn’t have a Sheffield Shield side. He turned heads during the recent winter season by plundering five consecutive centuries for Waratah in the Darwin Premier competition, breaking the all-time record. “He’s just getting started,” Waratahs coach Udara Weerasinghe told NT News earlier this year. “He’s one of those players who knows where their off stump is. “Champions are made when nobody is watching, that’s my story for him.” Ashley Chandrasinghe of Victoria. Photo by Steve Bell/Getty Images Last month, Chandrasinghe combined with Pucovski for a 270-run opening partnership during Victoria’s second XI pre-season fixture against New South Wales in Coffs Harbour, eventually removed by former Test seamer Trent Copeland for 110. “I think he has all the attributes, the personal qualities as well as the talent to go to the highest level,” Waratahs club president Simon Matthias told the News Corp publication.

Pakistan's leading Test and one-day international wicket-taker gives a raw account of his battle with the addiction in his autobiography Sultan: A Memoir, set to be released on November 10. Akram played international cricket for the final time in 2003, and moved into commentary and coaching.

You can go to ten parties a night, and some do. And it took its toll on me. My devices turned into vices. \"Worst of all, I developed a dependence on cocaine. It started innocuously enough when I was offered a line at a party in England; my use grew steadily more serious, to the point that I felt I needed it to function. \"It made me volatile. It made me deceptive. Huma, I know, was often lonely in this time . . . she would talk of her desire to move to Karachi, to be nearer her parents and siblings. I was reluctant. Why? Partly because I liked going to Karachi on my own, pretending it was work when it was actually about partying, often for days at a time. \"Huma eventually found me out, discovering a packet of cocaine in my wallet . . . 'You need help.' I agreed. It was getting out of hand. I couldn't control it. One line would become two, two would become four; four would become a gram, a gram would become two. I could not sleep. I could not eat. I grew inattentive to my diabetes, which caused me headaches and mood swings. Like a lot of addicts, part of me welcomed discovery: the secrecy had been exhausting.\" Akram explained that he underwent rehabilitation but found the experience upsetting, detailing a con man's interest in money rather than aiding recovery. \"Try as I might, part of me was still smouldering inside about the indignity of what I'd been put through,\" Akram's autobiography reads. \"My pride was hurt, and the lure of my lifestyle remained. I briefly contemplated divorce. I settled for heading to the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy where, out from under Huma's daily scrutiny, I started using again.\" Huma's death in October 2009, caused by a rare fungal infection, led to Akram quitting. \"That way of life was over, and I have never looked back,\" he wrote.
