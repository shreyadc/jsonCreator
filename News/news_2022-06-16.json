England chased 299 in 50 overs on the final day of the second test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge on Tuesday to win by five wickets and clinch the three-match series. The series is England's first under former New Zealand captain McCullum, who took over as coach last month following the exit of Chris Silverwood. Broad said \"Baz\" McCullum had already made a difference. \"It does feel really fresh and exciting in the changing room,\" said Broad. \"It's a very positive language. It's very forward-thinking, all about how to move this game forward.\" England's attacking performance was in contrast to their approach against the same opponents at Lord's a year ago, when they did not even attempt to take on a final day target of 273 and settled for a draw. \"This is no dig but at tea, when we were four down with the game in the balance slightly, I've certainly been in changing rooms in the past where that would be shut up shop time,\" Broad said. \"Baz's team talk was very much, 'let's attack the danger; let's run towards the danger', so every part of your mind is about going for this win. \"It was never really a case of, 'if we lose one we might shut up shop'. It was always 'we're going to win' and if it doesn't work, don't worry about it.\" England will look to complete a clean sweep when the third test gets underway at Headingley on June 23.

NEW DELHI: As the Indian cricket board (BCCI) exults post the mega IPL media rights deal, a lot of the attention has shifted to the impact it could have on Indian and international cricket. A day after the windfall, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly spoke to TOI on a range of issues. Excerpts... How do you see this mega deal impacting Indian cricket? This is a big opportunity to further strengthen Indian cricket. This will help the BCCI create even stronger infrastructure. The money needs to go to the grassroots. This also allows the board to raise the player fees across age groups and genders. The priority is to increase the salaries of women cricketers. We have already doubled the domestic match fees and the players will start to benefit from that from this season. And I also believe this will get more kids to take up cricket, as it has become a proper career option. Read Also It's a deal! - Everything you need to know about final IPL media rights figures Disney Star, Viacom18 and Times Internet bagged the various rights to broadcast IPL matches over the next 5 seasons on TV and digital platforms. The total revenue which will be generated over the next 5 years thanks to the sale of these broadcast rights for 2023-2027 is a staggering Rs 48,390.50 Was there any apprehension that the pandemic could have an adverse effect on the media rights deal? We never had any doubts. The planning for the media rights started two years ago. It was meticulously done. It has been a great year for Indian cricket so far. We have completed the domestic season, have got packed houses back in stadiums, the IPL was wonderfully conducted and now this mega deal. I want to congratulate Disney-Star, Viacom18 and Times Internet for playing a part. The IPL's per match valuation has exceeded that of the English Premier League (EPL). England's football team has struggled to win any big title for years. As a former India captain, is there any apprehension that players now will be more keen on the IPL money instead? First thing first, money can't be related to performances. From the times of Sunil Gavaskar to Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid , the money was nowhere close to what the players get now. But all of them had the hunger to perform. I don't think players will only play for the money. Players play for the stature they get and the pride of representing India. Every player would want to win big international tournaments. BCCI plans to get a bigger window for the IPL. How much will it impact international cricket? Is there any chance of doing away with one format for bilateral tournaments? Bilateral tours will continue. The IPL is an Indian tournament. Bilateral tours are for the rest of the world to generate revenue. Players from other countries need bilateral series. For the next two years, IPL will continue to have 74 matches. The next Future Tours Programme (FTP) cycle will have to be carefully worked out. Read Also IPL media rights sealed at Rs 48,390.50 crore: Disney-Star get TV, Viacom digital; Times Internet gets overseas rights With a winning bid of Rs 23,758 crore, Reliance Industries' (RIL) Viacom 18 not only bagged the digital media rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL) for India and overseas — in conjunction with Times Internet — but also beat the winning amount for the TV telecast rights, which went to Disney The IPL media rights have raised the bar. Do you expect a similar windfall when the media rights for international cricket go up for grabs? It's too early to say. But the existing per match valuation for international matches was more than the IPL. Let's see how the media rights for international matches go. We will have a package for domestic cricket. What about the India 'A' programme? As a policy, we have decided that we will not have India 'A' tours during Ranji Trophy season. We don't want to dilute the quality of our premier first-class tournament. We want as many top players as possible to be available during the Ranji Trophy. What are the plans for junior cricket? We are U-19 world champions. We will continue to build on it. The emerging players camps will start once the zonal cricket academies (ZCA) end. We will be identifying a pool of fast bowlers and spinners. They will not get monetary contracts but they will get insurance and accommodation. The inaugural women's U-19 World Cup is in January. There is a selection process underway at ZCAs. From September, India's U-19 women's team will start playing international games. The IPL has also played a part in increasing player fatigue. Is it ideal to rotate players, especially with ICC tournaments planned for every year now? It's not. Rahul Dravid ( Team India head coach) is looking into it. He has been planning to play a settled set of players at some stage. Probably from the England tour next month, we will start playing with players who are likely to play in the T20 World Cup in October.","pubDate":"2022-06-16 02:20:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India versus Ireland: Rishabh Pant & Shreyas Iyer's omission from T20I squad likely due to commitment for the Birmingham test - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS12ZXJzdXMtaXJlbGFuZC1yaXNoYWJoLXBhbnQtc2hyZXlhcy1peWVyLW9taXNzaW9uLXJlYXNvbi03OTcyMTg3L9IBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"India versus Ireland: Rishabh Pant & Shreyas Iyer's omission from T20I squad likely due to commitment for the Birmingham test  The Indian ExpressHardik Pandya to captain in Ireland T20Is; Sanju Samson, Rahul Tripathi picked | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzHardik Pandya to captain India in Ireland T20Is; Rahul Tripathi gets maiden call-up  ESPNcricinfoRahul Tewatia's tweet after being ignored from India T20I squad for Ireland series takes social media by storm  Hindustan TimesIndia Announce 17-Men Squad For T20I Series Against Ireland, Hardik Pandya Named Captain, Rahul Tripathi Earns Maiden Call-up  Cricket AddictorView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-16 02:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Virat Kohli vs Babar Azam: Pakistan captain has overtaken Indian batter, feels THIS cricket legend","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/virat-kohli-vs-babar-azam-pakistan-captain-has-overtaken-indian-batter-feels-this-cricket-legend-ian-bishop-2474283.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"The 27-year old Pakistan captain Babar Azam boasts of an ODI average of 59.22 and has a total of 17 centuries to his name so far.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-16 01:08:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Yorkshire charged by ECB following Rafiq cricket racism row","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/966545-yorkshire-charged-by-ecb-following-rafiq-cricket-racism-row","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LONDON: Yorkshire and a “number of individuals” have been charged by the England and Wales Cricket Board following the governing body’s investigation into how the county dealt with racism allegations made by former player Azeem Rafiq.The ECB did not name any of the people...","content":"LONDON: Yorkshire and a “number of individuals” have been charged by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) following the governing body’s investigation into how the county dealt with racism allegations made by former player Azeem Rafiq. .ads_between_content{ height:auto; width:auto; clear: both; text-align: center; } .ads_between_content .story_ads{ } /*@media (max-width:600px){ .ads_between_content{ float:none; margin:0px auto; text-align: center; } }*/ The ECB did not name any of the people involved in a statement issued on Wednesday.

Their county Yorkshire was also charged and it comes little more than a week before the Third Test against New Zealand starts at Headingley . Ashes-winning captain Vaughan , bowler Matthew Hoggard, batsman Gary Ballance and all-rounder Tim Bresnan are accused of racist and discriminatory language. Ex-Yorkshire skipper Andrew Gale is believed to be among a total of seven individuals charged. The charges come after former Yorkshire all-rounder Azeem Rafiq went public with claims that he was racially abused at the county. Vaughan has always “completely and categorically” denied saying to Rafiq and other players of Asian heritage before a Yorkshire match in 2009 that there are “too many of you lot — we need to do something about it.” He is currently working for the BBC on their TV coverage and as a summariser on Test Match Special on the radio. Hoggard denies the claims, Bresnan has denied using racist language towards Rafiq, while Ballance admitted calling Rafiq a “P***” but claimed it was “banter” with his one-time best friend. The cases will be heard by the Cricket Disciplinary Committee, which works separately from the ECB, in either September or October — although this could be delayed because of legal wrangling. Vaughan and other players plan to fight the charges and will have a chance to put their sides of the story under cross-examination. Ballance is the only player still on the staff at Yorkshire, although he has not played this season. Rafiq, who provided a witness statement to the ECB, said: “I welcome the announcement by the ECB and hope we can move to the hearing quickly. “This has been another gruelling but unfortunately necessary process. “It has been a long two years since I went public about my experiences — but I hope this all means that no young player ever goes through such pain and alienation again.” An ECB statement said: “In matters of this nature, our normal practice is not to identify individuals charged at this stage. “It is however standard practice for the CDC disciplinary panel to publish its decisions and written reasons in full following the hearing.” Yorkshire said the charges relate to allegations as far back as 2004. A spokesman added: “The club will need the co-operation of those in position during this time in order to fully consider and respond to the matters raised.”","pubDate":"2022-06-15 22:33:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PAUL NEWMAN: Lurking Moeen Ali puts pressure on England's Jack Leach","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-10921023/PAUL-NEWMAN-Lurking-Moeen-Ali-puts-pressure-Englands-Jack-Leach.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"WORLD OF CRICKET: There was an elephant in the room during England's sensational second Test victory high up in the Radcliffe Road stand at Trent Bridge in the unlikely form of Moeen Ali.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-15 22:18:39","image_url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/15/22/59118683-0-image-m-11_1655327668687.jpg","source_id":"dailymailuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"The secrets of England cricket's new 'Baz and Ben ball' era","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-10921107/The-secrets-England-crickets-new-Baz-Ben-ball-era.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"PAUL NEWMAN: It was symbolic and apt that England's incredible run-chase at Trent Bridge was completed when they reached their record-breaking target of 299 in exactly 50 overs.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-15 22:13:33","image_url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/06/15/22/59121027-0-image-a-16_1655327099309.jpg","source_id":"dailymailuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Stoinis and Agar in doubt for the remainder of the ODI series","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/stoinis-and-agar-in-doubt-for-the-remainder-of-the-odi-series/video/b87b5e1440fc6654aa2e8f3fed238236","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Marcus Stoinis and Ashton Agar are in doubt for the remainder of Australia's ODI series against Sri Lanka after being added a growing injury list.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-15 22:09:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"England’s best smash late-night kebabs","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/englands-best-smash-latenight-kebabs/video/b4e751b4e437224a453c4ff9966aad4e","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: It turns out even world class athletes enjoy a late-night kebab, as England's best cricketers enjoyed a snack pack or two after defeating New Zealand.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-15 21:36:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Wherever you go’: Cricketer Stuart Broad sends message to Tottenham-linked player","link":"https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/06/15/wherever-you-go-cricketer-stuart-broad-sends-message-to-tottenham-linked-player/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wherever-you-go-cricketer-stuart-broad-sends-message-to-tottenham-linked-player","keywords":["Competitions","Football","Middlesbrough","Nottingham Forest","Premier League","Teams","Tottenham Hotspur","djed spence"],"creator":["Amir Mir"],"video_url":null,"description":"Stuart Broad has posted on Instagram that Tottenham-linked Djed Spence is a ‘Nottingham Forest legend’.

It all began before the 2021 T20 World Cup which was conducted in the UAE, when Virat Kohli, after yet another disappointing season as skipper of the IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), decided to not only step down as captain of the franchise, but also as the skipper of team India in the T20 format. Rohit Sharma was ultimately agreed upon as team India captain across all formats later, but not before Virat even relinquished the post of skipper in the ODIs, and later was stripped off as Test captain as well by the BCCI. All of this chaos also led to KL Rahul being handed a captaincy debut as well in ODIs against South Africa. Resultantly, since the beginning of the year 2022, team India has had a total of five players donning the captaincy hat across different formats so far. While Kohli continued as the Test skipper until the team’s last Test against South Africa in January, KL Rahul took over in the absence of Rohit Sharma for the ODIs that followed, with the latter ruled out due to injury.","pubDate":"2022-06-15 18:33:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"A timeline of Yorkshire’s cricket racism scandal","link":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/yorkshire-azeem-rafiq-julian-knight-michael-vaughan-essex-b2102004.html","keywords":["Cricket","Sport"],"creator":["Pa Sport Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"The county and a “number of individuals” were charged by the ECB on Wednesday.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-15 18:14:20","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/06/15/19/a548e206fe9b7438ee0128890e946c04Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjU1NDAyODg0-2.65237839.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentuk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Former Colts Cricket Club import Vikramjit Singh makes first One Day International half century","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/south-western-times/former-colts-cricket-club-import-vikramjit-singh-makes-first-one-day-international-half-century-c-7171953","keywords":null,"creator":["Luke McPherson"],"video_url":null,"description":"Former Colts Cricket Club import Vikramjit Singh has continued to make inroads in the early stages of his One Day International career.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-06-15 18:00:00","image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-7171953/b58ea8ec70723731a7d886849626896ee1ab8231-16x9-x0y0w420h236.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sir Vivian Richards Stadium weather: Antigua weather report for WI vs BAN 1st Test Day 1","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-sir-vivian-richards-stadium-weather-antigua-weather-report-for-wi-vs-ban-1st-test-day-1/","keywords":["Cricket","Antigua test","Bangladesh tour of West Indies 2022"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sir Vivian Richards Stadium weather: After suffering an away ODI series defeat versus Pakistan, the Windies take on Bangladesh at home.
