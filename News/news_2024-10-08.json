Babar's failure to convert a start into a big score in Tests once more triggered cricket fans and enthusiasts who took to social media to criticise the former Pakistan captain on his string of low scores in Tests. Notably, Babar has now gone 17 Test innings and over 650 days without scoring a fifty.Azam played a relatively slow knock of 30 runs on a surface that offered much to the batters in Multan whereas Pakistan captain Shan Masood had earlier registered his fifth Test century off just 102 balls, underscoring the batter-friendly nature of the surface. Notably, Babar's last Test half-century came back in December 2022, in a Test against New Zealand at home.ALSO ON ABP Live | PAK vs ENG Test: Kevin Pietersen Takes A Dig At Multan Pitch, Calls It 'Bowlers GRAVEYARD'Social media users were quick to take notice of Babar's low score on the batter-friendly Multan pitch and showered criticism on the batter.

Babar's failure to convert a start into a big score in Tests once more triggered cricket fans and enthusiasts who took to social media to criticise the former Pakistan captain on his string of low scores in Tests. Notably, Babar has now gone 17 Test innings and over 650 days without scoring a fifty.Azam played a relatively slow knock of 30 runs on a surface that offered much to the batters in Multan whereas Pakistan captain Shan Masood had earlier registered his fifth Test century off just 102 balls, underscoring the batter-friendly nature of the surface. Notably, Babar's last Test half-century came back in December 2022, in a Test against New Zealand at home.ALSO ON ABP Live | PAK vs ENG Test: Kevin Pietersen Takes A Dig At Multan Pitch, Calls It 'Bowlers GRAVEYARD'Social media users were quick to take notice of Babar's low score on the batter-friendly Multan pitch and showered criticism on the batter.

Babar's failure to convert a start into a big score in Tests once more triggered cricket fans and enthusiasts who took to social media to criticise the former Pakistan captain on his string of low scores in Tests. Notably, Babar has now gone 17 Test innings and over 650 days without scoring a fifty.Azam played a relatively slow knock of 30 runs on a surface that offered much to the batters in Multan whereas Pakistan captain Shan Masood had earlier registered his fifth Test century off just 102 balls, underscoring the batter-friendly nature of the surface. Notably, Babar's last Test half-century came back in December 2022, in a Test against New Zealand at home.ALSO ON ABP Live | PAK vs ENG Test: Kevin Pietersen Takes A Dig At Multan Pitch, Calls It 'Bowlers GRAVEYARD'Social media users were quick to take notice of Babar's low score on the batter-friendly Multan pitch and showered criticism on the batter.
