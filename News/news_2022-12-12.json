It was criticism which stung Starc and polarised opinion.The best part of a decade later, Langer paid Starc the ultimate compliment as a “warrior” and one of Australia’s “tough” great men, in part for sacrificing more than $10 million in IPL money for the baggy green.“The way Mitchell Starc is bowling at the moment is absolutely world class and I admire so much about him. He’s an elite athlete. An elite professional,” Langer said on Channel 7.“The other thing about Mitchell Starc, he’s often been the subject of criticism for the way he’s bowled or his body language.“He might not smile much, he’s a warrior on the field, but he’s one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet in your life.“The other thing, is he loves playing Test cricket. An example of that, is that he hasn’t been to the IPL because he wants to make sure his body is in the best shape possible to play cricket for Australia.“I really admire that. I admire everyone who goes and takes their career into their own hands. “He has certainly done that. He is a ripper.”Nathan Lyon was once again the milestone man on Sunday in Adelaide as he added to his crowning as the ground’s greatest ever wicket-taker, surpassing Warne, before a second innings scalp took him to exactly 450 Test wickets.The legend of The GOAT continues to grow, and at age 35, there is no sign of Lyon slowing down or being close to the end. Five hundred Test wickets beckon.“He’s been an amazing player for a long period of time. I think the way he’s bowling at the moment he’s getting some lovely shape. He’s changing a few things up,” said stand-in captain Steve Smith.“A few of his wickets, he got Joshua da Silva LBW with a side spinning ball which is one he’s really been working on that hit the seam and spun quite sharply and doesn’t bounce quite as much which is probably why it hit the stumps.“(Even now) he’s still learning and getting better. That’s what you want from someone who has played 100 Tests. It sets the standard for everyone else.“You can’t just keep going on and doing the same thing over and over again. You’ve got to continue to get better and evolve and Nathan is certainly doing that.”Frank Worrell Trophy broken … is series beyond repair? – Daniel ChernyThe Frank Worrell Trophy fell apart at Adelaide Oval on Sunday. And the dispiriting news for Australian cricket fans who prefer more of a contest, is that it won’t be long until it is brought out of its case again.The ball atop the six-decade old trophy was dislodged as the Aussies were presented with their prize for beating the West Indies 2-0, leaving Australian captain Steve Smith having to fumble to put the ball back in its place.“Something happened to it. The ball came off the top of it. Not really sure what happened there. Hopefully someone can glue it back together,” Smith said.The symbolism was all too fitting for the demise in competitiveness of the series. Having pluckily taken Australia to beyond lunch on day five during the first Test in Perth, the undermanned tourists were crushed by 419 runs in Adelaide, routed for 77 in the second innings in a capitulation condemned by Windies captain Kraigg Brathwaite.Having gone almost seven years between Tests between the sides, a quirk of scheduling — the fact that a new ICC future tours cycle is about to commence — means that the Windies are back for another couple of Tests next summer.Unlike this season where the Windies are the clear entree for a three-Test series involving South Africa, next summer the Windies are due out second, and not until January, with Pakistan coming here first for three Tests scheduled to fall across December and January. The later start to Australia’s Test summer comes about because of the 50-over World Cup in India and a subsequent Twenty20 series also in India.Melbourne and Sydney are clear candidates for two of the Pakistan Tests in the traditional Boxing Day and New Year’s slots respectively, however it is unclear which of Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth would be handed a Pakistan Test, and who would be left with the lowly West Indians.Despite the lopsided affair, Adelaide Oval drew 86,617 across the three and a bit days of the second Test, more than double the turnout across the five days of the Perth Test, which was a day match and started in an unusual Wednesday slot.Adelaide’s pink-ball spectacular and carnival atmosphere is a consistent winner with local fans regardless of the opposition, which could theoretically hurt South Australia’s chances of being given a more compelling Test. Looking out the back of the SACA members area showed that hundreds of Test patrons in Adelaide come to the ground more for the canapes than the cut shots.More of a concern for Cricket Australia however is the likelihood that its Test stars will be taken out of the Big Bash League pool for much of next January playing against an opponent who will have by that time not beaten Australia in a Test for more than 20 years.CA had been keen to free its top players to play in the domestic Twenty20 league but as has long been acknowledged has its hands tied by the idiosyncrasies of the international calendar.Brathwaite noted that it had actually been a reasonable year for the Windies in Test cricket, having beaten England at home earlier in 2022. But he was disappointed by how badly they fell away in Adelaide, notwithstanding that the team was hit hard by injuries.“We didn’t show any fight at all,” lamented Brathwaite of the second Test showing, while still hopeful that the team would acquit itself better in little over a year’s time.“[For] a lot of the guys it was their first time to Australia, so I think the experience will help, and that is both as batsmen and as bowlers, and then seeing how Australia have played … we can learn from that.“It is important that you come back, that you don’t necessarily make the same mistakes. The key from experience is to learn from it.”Smith was diplomatic when asked about the Windies’ prospects. “I think they’ve got some good players. We probably got the best of the conditions, we won both tosses and got in front of the game pretty early on,” Smith said.“West Indies put up some good fights in this series, the second innings in Perth in particular, it took us a while to get through them and they’ve got some players there who can play, so next summer is going to be another challenge for us.”","pubDate":"2022-12-11 21:57:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"402 Internationals… 11,778 runs… 148 wickets – Yuvraj Singh Birthday Share","link":"https://thenewsglory.com/402-internationals-11778-runs-148-wickets-yuvraj-singh-birthday-share/","keywords":["Sports","birthday","Cricket","game","India","Today","Yuvraj Singh"],"creator":["The News Glory"],"video_url":null,"description":"Last Updated : 12 Dec, 2022 02:03 AM Published : 12 Dec 2022 02:03 AM Last Updated : 12 Dec 2022 02:03 AM Yuvraj Singh Former player Yuvraj Singh can be called match winner, amazing all-rounder and amazing fielder of Indian cricket team.

Pakistan dominated the morning session when they bowled out England for 275 but their 355-run target meant they needed to pull off a record chase on home soil to level the series. They seemed up for the task too but England’s seamers conjured up three magical deliveries after the lunch break to wrest back the initiative. The see-saw contest changed complexion in the final session again following a 108-run partnership between Imam, who fell just before the close for 60, and Saud. Saud was unbeaten on 54 with Faheem Ashraf on three at stumps. Pakistan, who finished day three on 198-4, are still 157 runs short of their target. Earlier, England added 73 runs to their overnight score of 202-5 on day three at the Multan Cricket Stadium. Ben Stokes (41) needed 43 balls to score his first boundary and was the first to fall, holing out in the deep to trigger a collapse. Spinner Abrar Ahmed picked up his 11th wicket in his debut Test by bowling Ollie Robinson through the gate. Overnight batsman Harry Brook (108) reached his second hundred of the series before leg-spinner Zahid Mahmood (3-52) polished off the English tail. Pakistan spinners claimed 18 of the 20 English wickets – the other two being run outs. The hosts had to rejig their opening pair following a hamstring niggle to Imam. They promoted the struggling Mohammad Rizwan, who hit a flurry of boundaries early in his knock to transfer the pressure back on England. James Anderson removed Rizwan for 30 immediately after lunch with a peach of a delivery that angled in and beat the outside edge to hit off stump. Robinson produced a similarly stunning ball to dismiss Pakistan captain Babar Azam for one. Babar shouldered arms to a delivery pitching outside off-stump but jagged back to rattle his stumps. Abdullah Shafique made 45 but could not protect his off-stump from the pace and movement of Mark Wood. Imam came in at number five and revived Pakistan’s chase with Saud. It would have been Pakistan’s session but spinner Jack Leach finally had Imam caught in the slips to break the partnership. —Agencies 2nd Test, Day 3: Imam-ul-Haq and Saud Shakeel fifties hold up England in Multan added by KR Desk on 2:09 am December 12, 2022 View all posts by KR Desk → KR Desk Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-11 20:39:19","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Warner exposed CA’s tendencies for back-side protecting: Ian Chappell","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/12/warner-exposed-cas-tendencies-for-back-side-protecting-ian-chappell/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"NEW DELHI: Cricket Australia has never protected the interest of the players and David Warner’s outburst on captaincy ban has exposed the authorities’ “tendencies for back-side protecting”, feels the legendary Ian Chappell.

Warner on Wednesday withdrew the bid to overturn his lifetime captaincy ban, saying the review panel wanted him to go through “public lynching” and he is not prepared to let his family be the “washing machine for cricket’s dirty laundry”. Chappell became the latest to come out in support of Warner after former skipper Michael Clarke too lashed out at CA for their lopsided review of his leadership ban and making the lefthander a scapegoat in the 2018 sandpaper scandal. “I couldn’t be happier that David Warner told Cricket Australia the equivalent of “go and get stuffed” when he went public about his decision to withdraw his request for a review of his captaincy ban,” Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNCricinfo. “This indicated Warner – who had been advised by CA against a public outburst — didn’t trust the authorities to be mindful of his interests. It was a wise decision by Warner as CA is renowned for only protecting their own interests, not those of players.” “Young players should be thankful Warner has exposed CA’s tendencies for back-side protecting. They need to keep it in mind for the future. “Most importantly, though, Warner’s withdrawal of his review highlights how appalling the original decision to award him a lifetime leadership ban was,” the cricketer-turned-commentator observed. Then Aussie skipper Steve Smith and his deputy at the time Warner were both suspended for 12 months after Cameron Bancroft was caught applying sandpaper to the ball during a match in South Africa in 2018. While the trio were handed respective bans from cricket, they also served leadership suspensions. Smith was banned from holding a leadership position in Australian cricket for two years, while Warner was banned for life in that respect. Bancroft was banned from captaincy for 12 months. Observing that Warner and Smith should have received the “same leadership punishment after the Cape Town incident”, Chappell remarked that the latter’s “crime was greater”. “Cheating is indefensible but so also is Smith as Australia captain saying ‘I don’t want to know’ when he walked past Warner and Bancroft, who were deep in discussion in the dressing room before they went ahead with the plan to tamper with the ball,” the 79-year-old wrote. “As a captain it was Smith’s job to know what his players were up to. If their motive was illegal, he needed to put a quick stop to any shenanigans. “Smith’s crime was greater than Warner’s. So it was no wonder Warner was incensed by his stiff original punishment while others were treated far more leniently.” The former Australian captain slammed the authorities for the way they handled the issue. “In the lead-up to the events in South Africa and in the aftermath, CA has erred regularly because self-protection is a high priority for them. “The lop-sided punishments, the botched integrity review in South Africa, and then the absurd decision to not allow an appeal by the Australian players – their list of failures goes on. No wonder Warner had a gut full, but he chose the right target to attack.” The 36-year-old Warner is still living with the leadership ban, four years since the infamous Cape Town Test but Smith is back leading the side in the ongoing day-night second Test against the West Indies following skipper Pat Cummins injury pullout. “I doubt Warner was expecting to gain a leadership position in the Australia set-up even with a successful review of the ban he received after the ball-tampering debacle in South Africa in 2018,” Chappell wrote. “He’s too old to be considered for a captaincy position in the Australian regime despite the fact that he has always had great leadership instincts. “However, I think Warner had hoped he might be able to lead his BBL team, Sydney Thunder, at some point. A pity because he would have been the ideal person to guide younger players on their cricketing path. Not to worry CA, because he’ll still be a leader and be listened to by any cricketer who wants to get ahead.” Chappell feels Warner may have been “disliked” by a CA administrator because he came out openly against the administration in their pay wrangle. “Whether Warner was disliked by an administrator, or it was because he was prepared to speak out during the feisty pay wrangle is unknown and likely to remain that way. What is known is Warner won’t be bullied.” Urging Warner to write a tell-all book, Chappell wrote: “He’ll have his say and if he does reveal all later in a book, it’ll be worth reading. It may take some work to get his book published because there’ll be a lot of red faces around if it does reach the public.” PTI Warner exposed CA’s tendencies for back-side protecting: Ian Chappell added by Press Trust of India on 2:08 am December 12, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-12-11 20:38:39","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Smith signs on with Sixers in the BBL","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/smith-signs-on-with-sixers-in-the-bbl/video/e1242457397d355746d853002a4e074d","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Steve Smith will face off against Australian teammate David Warner after signing on with the Sydney Sixers.","content":"Cricket: Steve Smith will face off against Australian teammate David Warner after signing on with the Sydney Sixers.","pubDate":"2022-12-11 20:36:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Alianzas simbólicas y amor mutuo: el grupo de fans argentinos de Bangladesh","link":"https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202212/613860-fans-argentinos-bangladesh-facebook-seleccion-qatar-futbol-cricket.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Como gesto de agradecimiento al apoyo bangladesí a la Selección argentina, Dan Lande -más conocido como Rulo de Viaje- creó en Facebook el grupo Fans argentinos de la selección de cricket de Bangladesh.

Al domingo 11, ya rozaba los 180 mil seguidores. El grupo Fans argentinos de la selección de cricket de Bangladesh fue creado hace menos de diez días -el 2 de diciembre- y ya cuenta con más de 170 mil miembros de los dos países. Lo que comenzó como un gesto de reciprocidad ante la pasión del pueblo bangladesí por la Selección argentina de fútbol, que por primera vez se percibe de forma masiva en nuestro país con el nivel de contundencia que tiene, pronto se transformó en un excepcional y emocionante intercambio cultural que trasciende todo límite deportivo y es noticia en los dos alejados puntos del planeta. Desde que comenzó el Mundial Qatar 2022, redes y medios hacen circular sin tregua imágenes de enormes multitudes alentando y festejando las victorias argentinas , que llegan desde el pequeño país que separa India de Myanmar. En Bangladesh, cuya población es una de las más grandes del mundo –más de 167 millones de habitantes es el octavo del planeta-, la Selección argentina de fútbol despierta pasión. Y es que el país de Asia del Sur fue colonia inglesa durante casi 100 años, y cuando Argentina venció a Inglaterra en la Copa del Mundo de 1986, el pueblo bangladesí abrazó la victoria del equipo comandado por Diego Armando Maradona como propia y fundó un vínculo de amor y aliento hoy supera toda fantasía. Unos días antes del partido Argentina-Australia, Dan Lande, un joven economista y viajero porteño que escribe memorias, sorprendido y atraído por el fenómeno que definió como “un universo paralelo”, decidió crear (un poco en chiste, un poco en serio) un grupo en Facebook para reunir argentinos e hinchar por la selección de cricket de Bangladesh. El gesto tiene sentido de reciprocidad porque allá el cricket es el deporte oficial. El grupo creció a una velocidad increíble, y muy pronto empezaron a aparecer argentinos que, sin saber del todo cómo funciona el deporte de origen británico, se esmeraron en demostrar su apoyo al país lejano y agradecer el aguante bangladesí al seleccionado albiceleste. No tardaron en sumarse bangladesíes contentos por las inesperadas muestras de cariño. La historia sigue. El grupo de fans argentinos de cricket de Bangladesh está en los diarios. @TamjidulH24v2 escribió esta nota de lo qué pasó ayer. Realmente todo esto es un universo paralelo pic.twitter.com/du9BE0UerF — Rulo de viaje (@Dan_Lande) December 3, 2022 “Ya somos más de 400 y se está hablando en serio de juntarse al próximo India Bangladesh que ATENCION juegan esta semana”, escribió el mismo día que creó el grupo Lande en su cuenta de Twitter, donde fue compartiendo los sucesos destacados del loco viaje de intercambio cultural que acababa de gestionar. Puesta a punto de las reglas del cricket y las épicas de los Bangla Tigers –el equipo ahora homólogo a la Scaloneta-, ofrenda de canciones de cancha que mencionan al capitán Litton Kumer Das y el jugador estrella Tamim Iqbal, búsqueda de compra de camisetas en Argentina, planes para juntarse a ver partidos en algún bar, intercambios ansiosos en la previa al partido de Argentina y Australia (que iba a suceder al día siguiente, sábado 3), incontables registros del amor bangladesí por la blanca y celeste y un sinfín de arengas y agradecimientos de parte de los dos polos de la alianza: así comenzó el intercambio. Pero no tardó mucho en transformarse en otra cosa. Pronto empezaron a publicarse preguntas sobre el folklore, las costumbres y la historia de cada cultura. Unos y otros compartieron imágenes de la belleza natural de su tierra. Algunos bangladesíes pidieron recomendaciones de películas y poetas argentinos. Alguien explicó que acá en la cancha se come choripán, y desde Bangladesh comentaron que los carritos ambulantes allá venden té. Un marplatense armó una lista de músicos argentinos que incluye 137 artistas y le comentaron detalladamente la composición genérica de la música local bangladesí. Un Rosarino subió una foto de la casa donde nació Messi para deleitar a los compañeros que lo alientan desde el otro lado del mundo. Abundaron las publicaciones sobre el significado de los colores de la bandera del país asiático: “el color verde de nuestra bandera simboliza la naturaleza verde y la juventud de Bangladesh, mientras que el círculo rojo simboliza el sol naciente y la sangre de los luchadores por la libertad martirizados”, detallaron muchos miembros. Mujeres explicaron su relación con el hiyab, el velo que debe cubrirles el pelo y pecho según la religión musulmana, aclarando que en Bangladesh no es obligatorio usarlo, pero que muchas religiosas lo hacen por decisión propia. De la mano de Google translate, los de Bangladesh aprendieron a decir “carajo”, a la vez que explicaron a los argentinos el origen de su lengua. Una hinchada incondicional: la de Bangladesh. Es un fenómeno que no deja de resultar impactante cómo un gesto inicialmente anclado en el territorio del deporte trasciende por completo ese territorio para movilizar un interés genuino en los abundantes rincones de otra cultura. Aunque, en el fondo, el suceso de la unión entre Bangladesh y Argentina tiene que ver con una enorme concordancia cultural desde su origen : es un sentimiento de comunión gestado por la experiencia colonial y, sobre todo, por la pulsión de lucha contra el colonialismo inglés, el que hizo que el pueblo bangladesí enarbolara la figura de Maradona. Ver a la nación que lo sometió al hambre, la explotación y la aniquilación –la Hambruna de Bengala de 1943 que arrasó a aproximadamente 3 millones de bengalíes es la más cruda evidencia histórica de ese sometimiento - humillada frente a un seleccionado de un país que reclamaba la soberanía de las Islas Malvinas, comandado por un jugador de nivel extraordinario orgulloso de su barrio popular natal, fue un motivo de fuerte identificación para el pueblo que consiguió su independencia recién en 1971. El grupo de Fans argentinos de la selección de cricket de Bangladesh es una muestra fascinante de la existencia de ese lugar en el que una contienda deportiva se puede transformar en una profunda batalla simbólica, donde el fútbol es mucho más que fútbol. Lo dijo hace muchos años Alejandro Dolina: \" el placer del fútbol tiene que ver con suspender la credulidad y entregarse a la fe poética de que el resultado de un partido puede mejorarle la vida a alguien\". Esa es la potencia que anida en el campo de juego, la que permite que ya no uno, sino dos pueblos, se aferren a la ilusión de que su historia común puede obtener una cuota de justicia en el marco de una competencia deportiva. Una ilusión, una fe, poéticas, en un mundo sometido al régimen cruel de lo material y lo monetario. En un contexto global y nacional en el que los sucesos imponen preocupación y ocupación de manera cada vez más exigente, en el que la crisis se agudiza sin tregua y el futuro resulta incierto, el fútbol nos permite conectarnos entre nosotros, y con nuestra idea de nación y de pertenencia. En este mundo, en el que hay nacionalismos que se construyeron a base de ultraje imperialista a otras culturas, mientras otros se levantaron como gestos de resistencia, nos permite hermanarnos de una forma muy singular. Una forma que habilita la fe poética popular, tan difícil de invocar. Hoy hay miles de argentinos que saben un poco más de Bangladesh, gracias al fútbol. Es un aporte que no es justo menospreciar, un ladrillo importante para la construcción del autoestima de los pueblos que, de manera totalmente literal, construye lazos sociales impensados y amplía nuestros campos culturales. Cafiero recordó que en agosto mantuvo una reunión con su par bangladeshí, Abul Kalam Abdul Momen. Este sábado la Cancillería informó que la República Argentina decidió avanzar con la reapertura de la embajada de Bangladesh, que está cerrada desde 1978 . ¿El objetivo? \"explotar las potencialidades de la relación bilateral\" entre ambos países. Se comunicó que se pretende promover la alianza fundamentalmente en el aspecto comercial “buscando diversificar el comercio y la oferta exportable argentina” y también \"promover la cooperación en el ámbito deportivo, satelital, ayuda humanitaria y gestión de desastres\". Si quedara alguna duda de la fuerza que pueden tener las alianzas simbólicas, en este mundo de leyes materiales , a veces llegan detrás de ellas alianzas diplomáticas.","pubDate":"2022-12-11 20:25:00","image_url":"https://www.telam.com.ar/advf/imagenes/2022/12/6396367d22b15.jpg","source_id":"telam","country":["argentina"],"category":["sports"],"language":"spanish"},{"title":"India vs Australia: Smriti Mandhana and teammates honour 47K-strong crowd with a victory lap, Watch Video","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-australia-smriti-mandhana-and-teammates-honour-47k-strong-crowd-with-a-victory-lap-watch-video-11790921.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Australia: Smriti Mandhana and teammates honour 47K-strong crowd with a victory lap, Watch Video","content":"Cricket India vs Australia: Smriti Mandhana and teammates honour 47K-strong crowd with a victory lap, Watch Video India beat Australia in the Super Over after the scores were tied at 187 at the end of 20 overs.

Leaving aside the predictable bargaining down-talk, the statement assumed a common agreement that cricket has lost its pre-eminent position and that the love affair has gone stale. You would expect nothing less from the voice of youth. The Australians were barely troubled in accounting for the West Indies. Credit: Getty By the end of Australia’s 419-run victory over the West Indies in Adelaide yesterday, the question was whether that love affair has been eroded more by a sense of something lost, or by a surfeit of winning. It’s a complicated question because, out of the uncommitted cricket audience peeling away from the game, some seem disenchanted by Australia having slipped from a kind of romantic peak that existed in the past, while others are tired by games like this, where Australia are too good at home to provide a compelling, and competitive, spectacle. Cricket Australia must feel it can’t win. Just as well it has put a politician in charge. First, the positive view. Australia’s dominance in Adelaide was sealed by relatively new talents such as Scott Boland, Michael Neser, Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head. It was not the old firm stomping yet again on West Indian hopes, but the young and the restless, the hungry and the ambitious. Boland’s career is already without parallel. In recent decades, perhaps only Stuart Clark came into the Australian team as a reserve bowler and made a mark so quickly. Boland brings the added extra of being completely and utterly lovable (no offence to Clark). He’s 33, he is Australia’s second Indigenous Test cricketer and, like the first, Jason Gillespie, he’s had his kids before he hit the big time. One of his nicknames is The Babysitter.","pubDate":"2022-12-11 18:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"watoday","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs Australia: 'Absolute QUEEN', Twitterati in awe of Smriti Mandhana as hosts win big in 2nd T20I","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/india-vs-australia-absolute-queen-twitterati-in-awe-of-smriti-mandhana-as-hosts-win-big-in-2nd-t20i-11790781.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs Australia: 'Absolute QUEEN', Twitterati in awe of Smriti Mandhana as hosts win big in 2nd T20I","content":"Cricket India vs Australia: 'Absolute QUEEN', Twitterati in awe of Smriti Mandhana as hosts win big in 2nd T20I A 61-run stand between Harmanpreet and Mandhana for the third wicket put India right back in the chase, but it was Richa Ghosh (26*) and Devaki Vaidya (11*) that took India to 187/5 from 20 overs.

Twitter @BCCIWomen Harmanpreet Kaur-led India outplayed Alyssa Healy’s Australia in a second T20 that went down to the wire at the DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai, with the Women in Blue emerging victorious via a Super Over. With the win, India women levelled the five-match series 1-1. Winning the toss and opting to field first, Deepti Sharma got the only wicket of the Aussies, removing Alyssa Healy (25) in the fourth over.

Super Over followed. India batted first, and Mandhana played a major role, hitting a four and a six to take India to 20/1. Australia started off with a four from Alyssa Healy, but the wicket of Gardener and conceding just a run off McGrath meant the ball was in India’s court. Australia needed 15 runs off two balls, and Healy hit a four and then a six off the last two balls, but that was not enough for the Aussies. This was Australia’s first loss in women’s T20Is.

After three years, he is finally playing red-ball cricket again.","content":"Sanju Samson, the ace wicketkeeper batter for the Indian team, has consistently been ignored by management despite his outstanding performances whenever he plays for India. He has been passed over by BCCI for the T20 World Cup in 2022, and now he was left out of the squad for the current series against Bangladesh. He was previously chosen for the New Zealand tour, although he only got to participate in one game. Sanju Samson, a Rajasthan Royal player who excelled in the Indian Premier League, played an outstanding captaincy role. And now as per a report by Cricinformer, the Ireland cricket team is making him an offer. Sanju Samson was given the opportunity to represent Ireland in international cricket by the country's cricket president, who also guaranteed that Sanju would captain the team and participate in all of its games. “We will let him play all the matches if he is in our national team. He is a very impressive batter and he is one of the rare talent. We provide him an offer to play the matches from our national team. Our team required a skipper and batter like him. If the Indian team is overlooking him then he can join us, we respect him and make him play every match,” said Ireland’s cricket president. Sanju said, \"Thank you very much,\" in response to the president of Ireland's invitation. I can understand that sometimes we have to wait, and I am currently sitting here waiting for my selector's call, but my dream is still to play for the Indian team, and I will never play for any other country. “First of all, I want to thank Ireland’s cricket president for considering me for this role but I can’t accept his offer. I started my cricketing to play for Indian national cricket team. I don’t want to play for any other nation or can’t even think to play for another nation. I can’t accept this offer and I want to say sorry to Ireland’s cricket president.” Said, Sanju Samson “Although, I haven’t got plenty of chances in the Indian cricket team but I will work hard and have self believe and sometimes the combination of team doesn’t allow your place in the playing XI but it doesn’t mean I am sad,” he added. The three-match ODI series against South Africa included Samson who appeared to be hitting well. In the first ODI, which the Men in Blue narrowly lost, he came close to giving India the victory. Samson's unbeaten 86 runs contributed to India's getting within nine runs of winning the match, but his efforts were in vain as India fell short. In the ensuing two One-Day Internationals against South Africa, he scored, respectively, an unbeaten 30 and 2 runs. India won the series 2-1 by coming out on top. The 28-year-old recently registered for the first two Ranji Trophy games for Kerala. After three years, he is finally playing red-ball cricket again. Nevertheless, Samson is anticipated to return to the Indian team in January for the series against Sri Lanka. Although a berth in the starting lineup is not certain, India's decision to rejig under Hardik Pandya puts him unquestionably in the running for the T20s. READ| Shikhar Dhawan's World Cup dream over?

On a sunny Saturday, with India aiming for a consolation win after losing the ODI series to Bangladesh, Kishan joined Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma in the list of Indian batters to reach the 200-mark in men's ODIs. Overall, he became the seventh batter in international cricket to hit a double ton in ODIS. By getting his double-century in 126 balls, he also became the youngest batter to score a double-hundred in the format. When he got out for 210 off 131 balls, converting his maiden ODI ton into a double-hundred in an exhibition of jaw-dropping stroke-play, Kishan had more records against his name — the highest individual score by a batter in men's ODIs in Bangladesh, as well as the highest score by an Indian batter outside of home. His 210 is also the third-highest individual score by an Indian men's batter in this format. Despite losing his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan early after being pushed into batting first, Kishan embarked upon a sizzling 290-run stand with Kohli , who made 113 off 91 balls, as India made 409/8 in 50 overs. In reply, Bangladesh folded for 148 in 32 overs, giving India a crushing victory in a dead rubber as the'hosts' won the series 2-1. The crowd at Chattogram was treated to a sensational knock from Kishan where he played all the shots in the batting manual. No part of the ground was left untouched by his brilliance and no bowler could escape his brutal yet eye-catchy shots. There were many incredible shots hit by Kishan in his 24 fours and ten sixes, where he mixed confidence and fearlessness in toying with a Bangladesh bowling attack, leaving them clueless. When bowlers gave width or pitched on the fourth stump, he was quick to crash them through the off-side. When bowlers dropped short, he was quick to unleash the pull-off backfoot or one-legged. After reaching the three-figure mark, the frequency of pulls slogs, and slog-sweeps became very frequent as Kishan toyed with the Bangladesh bowling attack to reach 150 in just 18 balls post reaching his century. He brought out more shots to get a double-hundred in another 23 deliveries, which is now etched in the memory of Indian fans forever. He would hit another four and six, before falling to Taskin Ahmed as Litton Das took a good running catch at long-off in the 36th over. Kohli, on the other hand, had luck on his side when Litton Das dropped a simple catch off a lazy flick at short mid-wicket, giving him a lifeline at just one. He looked a little scratchy but grew in confidence as the innings progressed, making the most out of a bowling attack rattled by Kishan's onslaught. He got his 44th ODI hundred and the first in almost three years when he picked the pace from Ebadot to do a subtle flick off the hips and the ball flew over the fine-leg fence, going past Ricky Ponting to be in the second spot for most centuries in international cricket. Though he holed out to long-off fielder off Shakib Al Hasan, India still managed to get over 400 thanks to some lusty hits from Washington Sundar and Axar Patel. Chasing 410 was always going to be difficult for Bangladesh. Axar Patel broke the 33-run opening stand on the first ball of the fifth over when Anamul Haque holed out to long-off. Three overs later, Litton Das hit straight to the mid-off fielder off Mohammed Siraj.Axar got his second wicket as Mushfiqur Rahim went for the sweep but was castled. Eight overs later, Yasir Ali was trapped lbw by Umran Malik in a successful review by India. Shakib was accumulating runs in his steady flow but chopped onto his stumps off Kuldeep Yadav.As Mahmudullah was trapped lbw by Washington Sundar and burnt a review while Mehidy Hasan Miraz didn't produce any heroics with the bat, the result was all but a foregone conclusion as India registered a crushing victory. Brief Scores: India 409/8 in 50 overs (Ishan Kishan 210, Virat Kohli 113; Shakib Al Hasan 2-68, Ebadot Hossain 2-80) beat Bangladesh 182 all out in 34 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 43, Litton Das 29; Shardul Thakur 3-30, Axar Patel 2-22) by 227 runs (IANS).

FirstCricket Staff December 11th, 2022 21:20:38 IST File image of India pacer Mohammed Shami. AP Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja were on Sunday officially ruled out of India’s upcoming Test series against Bangladesh due to injury, with the BCCI naming Saurabh Kumar and Navdeep Saini as their replacements. Both left-arm spinner Kumar and seamer Saini are currently in Bangladesh, where they represented India A in the two unofficial Tests against Bangladesh A. Kumar was among the standout players from the Indian camp, collecting nine wickets (9/86) including five (5/63) in the second innings to nearly win the game for his side in the first of the two matches. He would then follow it up with 6/74 in Bangladesh A’s 2nd innings in the second game to help the Indians win by an innings and 123 runs. While Jadeja has been out of action since the group stage of the Asia Cup, Mohammed Shami had arrived in Bangladesh with the rest of the India squad ahead of the one-day series, only to get ruled out last minute due to a shoulder injury . The BCCI would name Shahbaz Ahmed and Umran Malik as Jadeja and Shami’s replacements for the ODIs, with Shami heading to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru for rehabilitation. Read: Shami shares emotional post after getting ruled out of ODIs The BCCI had earlier included Saurashtra pacer Jaydev Unadkat in the Test squad as well. Among the other changes to the squad is the inclusion of Bengal opener Abhimanyu Easwaran in place of injured skipper Rohit Sharma. Easwaran led India A in the red-ball matches against Bangladesh A and was in stellar form with the bat, smashing a ton in each of his two outings (141 and 157). Rohit had suffered an injury on his left thumb during the second ODI against Bangladesh and had missed out the series finale as a result, having travelled to the NCA for recovery. While the release from the board confirmed his absence from the first Test, the BCCI Medical Team will take a call on his participation in the second Test. “India captain Rohit Sharma met with a specialist in Mumbai for his left thumb injury, which he sustained during the 2nd ODI against Bangladesh. He has been advised appropriate management for this injury and will not be available for the first Test against Bangladesh. The BCCI Medical Team will take a call on his availability for the second and final Test at a later stage,” the BCCI wrote in a release. India will be aiming to put up a strong response in the Test leg of the Bangladesh tour that begins on Wednesday, 14 December at Chattogram’s Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. They had earlier put up a disappointing show in the ODIs where they conceded the three-match series by losing the first two games in Dhaka by narrow margins of one wicket and five runs respectively. The Men in Blue however, pulled off a clincal win in the final game, where Ishan Kishan’s scintillating 210 helped the visitors collect a commanding 227-run win.

Cut to the present, and Kishan was a very elated man because he not only got a century but converted it into a double ton in the third ODI against Bangladesh at Chattogram.Kishan slammed the fastest double-century in the history of men's ODI cricket, off just 126 balls, shattering the previous record of the fastest 200 in men's ODIs, which was held by Chris Gayle, made his double-century in 138 balls against Zimbabwe in the 2015 ODI World Cup, setting the base for India's 227-run win to sign off from the series on a high. \"It was a perfect wicket and situation to bat on. I was just looking to watch the ball properly, and go with the flow. At this level, whenever you get the chance, you need to make the most out of it. I was just picking the ball and the bowlers, and things were going my way!\" he said in the post-match presentation ceremony. It was a knock during which Kishan never let go of his attacking instincts as he grabbed the opportunity of opening the batting in the absence of regular skipper Rohit Sharma. At the sight of the slightest width from bowlers, he was quick to crash the ball through the off-side. When the bowlers bowled short balls on the slowish pitch, he was fast in pulling the ball over leg-side, with all ten of his sixes coming in the arc from wide long-on to long leg. Even when he wasn't timing the ball well, he still managed to attack and clear the fielders to get boundaries, leaving Bangladesh clueless. In his 210 off 131 balls against Bangladesh, Kishan had a boundary percentage of 74.29, playing just 49 dot balls and a strike-rate of 160.31. He was equally severe on pacers and spinners. He was the dominant partner in a 290-run stand with Virat Kohli and completely overshadowed his 72nd international hundred with an innings to remember for ages. \"After looking at the wicket, I knew it was going to play well. Was trying to smash the loose balls. There is so much conversation going on in the team about fitness. I think when you have so many senior players in the team. We have been doing conversations. Our trainer and physio are taking care of everyone,\" added Kishan.

But despite all this, the country hasn't been able to win an ICC trophy for the last nine years, which raises questions about our priorities.The already-rich BCCI added some big money with the addition of two new IPL teams (Rs 12,715 crore) and media rights sale (Rs 48,390 crore) in 2022, which was lauded by the well-wishers of Indian cricket. It's because the earned money is eventually divided among the stakeholders and reaches every deserving individual of the Indian cricket ecosystem. Apart from the earnings for the BCCI, 2022 was an eventful year for Indian cricket for other reasons as well. The removal of Virat Kohli as captain, arrival of Rohit Sharma as new skipper and coach Rahul Dravid, and Sourav's Ganguly ouster as BCCI President were the other big events which created ripples in the circuit. However, it was the disappointments at the Asia Cup and the ICC T20 World Cup, which hurt the fans most. The Indian cricket fans had high hopes from skipper Rohit and coach Dravid because of their past records. While Rohit had won five IPL titles and one Asia Cup, Dravid, under his coaching, had led the U-19 India team to World Cup victory and was nurturing the budding talents with India-A sides. There was talk of showcasing attacking cricket, which they played till the bilateral series. But come the T20 World Cup, they looked timid in their approach and India suffered a humiliating 10-wicket loss against eventual winners England in the semi-final. After the World Cup debacle, there were murmurs of taking some bold steps for improvement, but nothing has happened till now. Not only the ICC events, India have now lost back-to-back ODI series against New Zealand and Bangladesh, which raises some serious questions about the future. Is international men's cricket on the priority list of the BCCI and stakeholders of Indian cricket, or are they just happy with IPL's commercial success? Of course, there are no clear-cut answers. One can argue that the BCCI is providing all the best possible facilities to the players, hiring the best professionals from the world, so what else can they do as it's up to the coaches and players to produce results. But, nothing stops the Indian cricket board from having a review of the Men in Blue's performance and finding the root cause of the team's failure at ICC events. If there is an issue, which certainly is, then the BCCI needs to find a solution and take some bold calls. After their disappointing group-stage exit in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, England took some bold decisions, adopted an aggressive approach to the game and are now the champions of both the 50-over and T20 World Cups. Likewise, the BCCI also needs to focus on Indian's men's cricket. Well, everyone knows that these things are not easy in Indian cricket, where players are demigods. But, someday, somebody will have to make the decision. There has to be some accountability, otherwise, Indian cricket will continue to suffer, especially at ICC events. Questions also need to be asked from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) as Indian cricket is suffering from many recurring injuries. There are many examples in recent times, when a player gets injured, goes to the NCA for rehab, gets fit, makes a comeback and breaks down after just two three-matches. The last three 50-over World Cups have been won by the hosts (India -- 2011, Australia -- 2015 and England -- 2019) and India are hosting the mega event next year. It will be a real shame if we don't do well in the knockouts in our own conditions. Eventually, it all boils down to the priority of the board, coaching staff and players. As of now, things -- injuries to key players, selection dilemmas, lack of vision and clarity -- are not looking great for Indian cricket and it needs some course correction as time is running out. So, Indian cricket needs to wake up, focus on international cricket and fill those gaps before it becomes too late and embarrassing.

Chasing a 355-run target, Pakistan need 157 more runs with six wickets in hand to win this match and stage a come back in the ongoing three-match series. With a couple of days remaining in the match, there is no way that it will result in a draw. With Pakistan ending Day 3 at 198/4 in 64 overs, Rizwan considers the same as a “good position” on a “slow” and “turning” pitch and sees them as the favourites in spite of needing to dominate a couple of sessions on Day 4 against an “experienced” English side. Mohammad Rizwan in awe of James Anderson post getting out to him in Multan Test In what was his 41st Test innings, Rizwan was sent out to open the batting for the first time after regular opener Imam-ul-Haq struggled with a hamstring issue. A 66-run opening stand alongside Abdullah Shafique (45) saw Rizwan batting with positive intent but the right-handed batter couldn’t convert his start into a half-century. Rizwan, who scored 30 (43) at a strike rate of 69.76, Rizwan was undone by a jaffa by veteran England pacer James Anderson. Becoming the first Pakistani batter to get out right after the lunch break, Rizwan was soon followed to the pavilion by captain Babar Azam (1) and Shafique. “Always a masterclass, I love him [James Anderson] because of his bowling. I have no answers to his questions,” Rizwan admitted to be in awe of the 40-year old player. Rizwan, who appeared to have no clue about the ball on which he was dismissed, was not only short of answers but also short of words to appreciate Anderson’s quality. Facing Anderson for the seventh time in Test cricket, Rizwan has scored 43 (104) with the help of five fours at the cost of getting out thrice against him.

APBrook hit another century for England[/caption] AFPLeach bowling in the third day of the Second Test[/caption] APLeach’s late wicket handed England a huge boost near the end of day three[/caption] It came when Imam and Saud Shakeel put on 108 runs for the fourth wicket after Pakistan lost three for 17 to England’s seamers and slumped to 83-3. Pakistan, chasing 355 to level the series 1-1, were 198-4 at the close and there could be a thrilling conclusion on the fourth day. After Harry Brook scored his second Test century in only his third match, England batted recklessly and lost their final five wickets for 19 runs. But that’s the way they play under Ben Stokes and nobody can quibble with the results. They have won seven of their eight Tests with Stokes and Brendon McCullum in charge. They would also have been confident of preventing Pakistan making the highest total of the match to win. Regular opener Imam was unavailable to go in first because of a hamstring twinge. So wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan was promoted and he and Abdullah Shafique were largely untroubled reaching 64-0 at lunch. But that all changed soon after the interval as England’s quick bowlers produced a trio of brilliant deliveries. JOIN SUN VEGAS: GET A FREE £10 BONUS WITH 100s OF GAMES TO PLAY AND NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED (Ts&Cs apply) Jimmy Anderson’s ball to Rizwan swerved in the air and then nipped away off the pitch. Virtually unplayable and the second time in the match that Rizwan succumbed to a peach of a delivery after Leach’s spinning snorter in the first innings. Ollie Robinson coaxed Babar into leaving a ball, which nipped back like an off-break and bowled Pakistan’s best batsman. Robinson also bowled Babar in the first innings with a superb reverse swinger. And then Mark Wood accounted for Shafique with another delivery that cut in alarmingly from a surface that had previously offered little help for the seamers. Imam felt fit enough to come in at No.5 and he showed few affects of his injury. He found a strong ally in fellow leftie Shakeel and they were causing England plenty of frustration. Imam was dropped on 19 – a relatively straightforward caught and bowled chance to Will Jacks – and would probably have been given out caught behind on 54 off Wood if England had reviewed. But he eventually perished to Leach ten minutes before bad light curtailed play. Earlier, Brook added weight to what most people expect – that he will become a major international batsman for many years. His century was England’s 21st in Test cricket this year – an England record for a calendar year and another tribute to the attacking and relaxed mindset created by Stokes and McCullum. Brook and Stokes took their sixth-wicket stand to 101 before Stokes holed out to deep mid-wicket. That prompted a collapse in which England’s lower-order produced a mixture of slogs and sweeps as the final five wickets fell for 19 runs. In the past, England would have batted carefully to try to make sure their lead extended beyond 400 but Stokes and his boys don’t do the orthodox.","pubDate":"2022-12-11 13:13:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesun","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"End of road for Shikhar Dhawan?

Ishan Kishan’s astounding batting performance got everyone talking! 👌 👌 Some high praises in there for the record setter 👏 👏 Scorecard 👉 https://t.co/HGnEqugMuM #TeamIndia | #BANvIND | @ishankishan51 pic.twitter.com/ikoxs2daqg — BCCI (@BCCI) December 10, 2022 Notably, Dhawan has received the backing of the team management and in the absence of Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul, he has even led the Men in Blue in several ODI series this year. But the veteran opener has failed miserably to capitalise on the opportunities and had been in poor form throughout the year. In his last 10 ODIs, Dhawan has registered scores of 3, 8, 7, 28, 3, 72, 8, 13, 4 and 40. His overall ODI stats in the year 2022 are no less than a nightmare as the 37-year-old scored 688 runs at an average of 34.4 and a strike rate of 74.21. His dot ball percentage is 60. Moreover, in the recently-concluded series against Bangladesh, Dhawan managed to score 7, 8, and 3 across the three ODIs and there are high chances that the batter’s dismal show against the Tigers is the last nail in the coffin as far as his international career is concerned. Team India’s next assignment is the home series against Sri Lanka consisting of three T20Is and as many ODIs. Given the fact that the 2023 ODI World Cup, scheduled to take place in India, is not too far, the management will be eager to identify the player who can open with skipper Rohit Sharma in the marquee tournament and with young, talented, and in-form batters like Ishan Kishan, Shubman Gill already waiting in the wings, the management will in all probability ignore out-of-form Dhawan thus signaling the end of the road for him. Quotes Corner ‘Could be a sad end to a glorious career’: Dinesh Karthik “For Sri Lanka series, where does Dhawan stand? It is going to be interesting to see how they are going to leave out Ishan Kishan. Shubman Gill has been doing so well. If Rohit Sharma is available, somebody has to miss out. It could well be him (Dhawan). That could be a sad end to a glorious career. But some questions to answer for the new selectors,” Karthik told Cricbuzz . Thank you so much ❤️ https://t.co/t2WXJSMske — Shikhar Dhawan (@SDhawan25) December 6, 2022 “Interestingly, if Shubman Gill had been part of the squad (for Bangladesh series), he would have probably opened because he has been doing it for some time with aplomb. Ishan Kishan, given an opportunity, has taken it with both hands. This is going to put Shikhar Dhawan in a fix,” he added. ‘It will depend on the team management’: Saba Karim “It will depend on the team management, that what sort of cricket they are wanting to play. If the team management still believes that 275-300 is their aim, then you need Shikhar Dhawan because he is still that kind of a player,” former India selector Saba Karim said when asked if he sees Dhawan playing 50-over cricket going forward. “It is a different thing that he has not scored runs in this series. But if you give him an opportunity again and tell him that we have to score 275-300 only, Shikhar Dhawan’s place will be there till the World Cup. But if we have decided that our par score will be 325-350, there is no place for Dhawan,” he added during a discussion on Sony Sports. Time to address the ‘problem of plenty’ With the plethora of talent available at their disposal, one challenge that Team India management has faced constantly in recent years has been the problem of plenty. It’s one thing to give opportunities to talented players but another to know how, when and which player to use as per the situation. Kishan, who smashed multiple records on Saturday, was not even in the playing XI for the first two ODI’s against Bangladesh as there was no place left for an opening batter with skipper Rohit Sharma and Dhawan in the squad. But, with former getting injured, Kishan finally got the opportunity and he made the most of it by slamming a double ton to become the first player to convert a maiden hundred into a double. Not only this, Kishan also became the youngest player to score a double ton in men’s ODIs and he even achieved the feat in fewest balls (126). For his fiery 🔥 🔥 double ton, @ishankishan51 bags the Player of the Match award as #TeamIndia beat Bangladesh by 227 runs in the third ODI 👏 👏 Scorecard 👉 https://t.co/HGnEqugMuM #BANvIND pic.twitter.com/CJHniqrIoa — BCCI (@BCCI) December 10, 2022 Surely, what Kishan achieved is more than commendable and it will probably stand for some time to come, but the sad part is that his historic innings was always inconsequential from the context of the series as India had already lost the opening two games. Now the questions which are perturbing the fans and experts are: Why was Kishan not given chance early in the series? Why did the management pick struggling Dhawan over Kishan? Why didn’t they utilise their resources properly?, and more. Sadly, there are no clear answers to these questions, and on top of that, the team management often fails to back their words with their actions. The same team management who has been advocating a ‘fearless approach’ and ‘attack brand of cricket’ since last year, is not making proper usage of ‘pocket dynamite’ Ishan Kishan and that is indeed perplexing. With the advantage of playing at home, the ODI World Cup next year is a glorious chance for India to get their hands on an ICC Trophy almost after a decade. However, the first and major step towards achieving the goal is to identify the players who can deliver whenever the team needs them to, and for that the India management and selectors need to step up, justify their decisions, and make the most out of resources at their disposal.

Probably just needs to play tighter. I﻿ suspect that the South African bowlers may bring the best out in him because they'll certainly focus his attention. The West Indies bowlers may not have challenged him enough to get him really focused, so the South African series promises to be interesting.\"Usman Khawaja 7.5/10\"Looked good in both digs, Ussie. Looks in good touch. Obviously didn't turn them into hundreds, but if your openers are making 60 and 40 every game that's more than a pass mark.\"Marnus Labuschagne 9.5/10\"Another terrific innings and a ﻿very good series, obviously. For a guy who came into the series not in great form, to be man of the series just shows you sometimes you just need some greater challenges to bring out the best in you. So, he looks in good form, which is good news for Australia leading into the South African series.\"Steve Smith 4/10\"I think Smithy probably needs a good challenge ... obviously got a duck in the first innings in Adelaide, but a selfless, quickfire 30 in the second innings, which was required. The fact that he looked to keep the game moving forward — I think that's what we all want to see from our Australian captain, no matter who it is. So, good, positive cricket, and he set the tone with the way he set about instructing the players to play a certain way in that second innings.\"Travis Head 10/10\"Man-of-the-match﻿ performance. Played really well. Obviously unlucky to be run out in the first innings and I'm sure that'll be a disappointment, but you'll take 175 every day of the week. So, good to see Heady in good form. Probably wipes the disappointment away from the 99 the previous week. I like the way he keeps the game moving forward at No.5. He plays good, aggressive cricket and, I think, helps his batting partner at the other end.\"Cameron Green 3/10\"Took a nice catch in the gully. Just didn't look focused in the first innings ... needs to get himself going better. He's not a great starter with the bat and I think that's something he needs to work on — be more positive, a bit quicker on his feet when he starts. But as we've always said before﻿, the fact that he brings that sort of fourth seamer to the table is fantastic. And his fielding — his fielding's always good, and I love that.\"Alex Carey 7/10\"Batted well in the first innings, kept the game moving nicely, and his 'keeping improved as the game went on, which is good. I didn't think he kept well in Perth in the first game. I thought he didn't look great with the gloves. And even at times with Nathan Lyon in this Test match he looked to be coming up a bit too soon. But those couple of catches he took standing up to (Michael) Neser at the end were very good, and hopefully that will give him a lot of confidence going into the South African series.Michael Neser 8/10\"I like him as a cricketer. A good, honest cricketer. Does the job you expect him to do: runs in, hits the top of off stump, asks questions, bowls full and he can swing it away a bit. So, good Test match. Did everything Australia could ask of him.﻿Mitchell Starc 9/10\"I think Starcy's been excellent in these two Test matches﻿. The pitches haven't been great for bowlers, but I think Starcy led our attack in both of them. I thought he was really good, not just today but throughout this Test match. He's got a bit of swing occasionally with the odd one coming back into the right-handers, just bowled with good pace and had better accuracy than I've seen in recent times.\"Nathan Lyon 8.5/10\"I think he bowled better in this Test match than he did in Perth. Bowled a better line, a better pace, particularly in that first innings when he got the ball nicely outside the off stump and found a bit of shape away in the air. Good spin. Loves bowling in Adelaide, which offers a bit more for him. Just bowled a better line and always troubled the batsmen, was always asking questions.﻿\"Scott Boland﻿ 8.5/10\"Very good. Very much like Neser. Just picked in the side to do a job and just did it so well: hitting the top of off, swinging the ball back on a pitch that was pretty good for batting. If there was anything there to be found both he and Neser found it. To bowl the West Indies out for 77 is a terrific effort because it certainly﻿ wasn't an all-out 77 pitch.\"For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!","pubDate":"2022-12-11 12:03:12","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/12/472486/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia wrap up series against Windies","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-wrap-up-series-against-windies/video/5da279444fb48d21819b7930a397347e","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australia have completed a dominant 2-0 series against the West Indies, winning the second test with more than a day and half to spare.","content":"Cricket: Australia have completed a dominant 2-0 series against the West Indies, winning the second test with more than a day and half to spare.","pubDate":"2022-12-11 11:54:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hazlewood unlikely to face South Africa","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/hazlewood-unlikely-to-face-south-africa/video/b90d737457146ef2bf353e1cc649a255","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Josh Hazlewood's fitness for the first test against South Africa remains a key concern for Australia, Kath Loughnan has the latest update for the pace bowler during play against the Wets Indies.","content":"Cricket: Josh Hazlewood's fitness for the first test against South Africa remains a key concern for Australia, Kath Loughnan has the latest update for the pace bowler during play against the Wets Indies.","pubDate":"2022-12-11 11:54:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"2022 Optimist Asian &amp; Oceanian Championship to be held in Mumbai","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/2022-optimist-asian-oceanian-championship-to-be-held-in-mumbai-11790091.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"2022 Optimist Asian &amp; Oceanian Championship to be held in Mumbai","content":"Sports 2022 Optimist Asian & Oceanian Championship to be held in Mumbai Week-long event to be staged at Girgaum Chowpatty from 13-20 December 2022.
