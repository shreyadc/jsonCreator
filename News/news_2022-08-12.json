The IlT20 League in UAE is set to start in January 2023, and it is set to be a grand tournament. A total of six teams will be participating, where three of them have owned by the IPL owners. Mumbai Indians have also bought a franchise in the competition named the MI Emirates. Ahead of the tournament, the franchise have announced its 14 signings for the tournament. Mumbai Indians team 2023 MI Emirates have roped in four players from West Indies, where they have also got their familiar figure, Kieron Pollard. Pollard has been playing for the Mumbai Indians since his IPL debut and has been an integral part of the squad. Dwayne Bravo, Nicholas Pooran and Andre Fletcher are the other three players from the West Indies. Former Mumbai Indians pacer Trent Boult has also reunited with the franchise in the ILT20 League. Boult recently moved out of New Zealand’s central contract to focus on the domestic leagues, and this will be his first major assignment after his big decision. Samit Patel, Will Smeed and Jordan Thompson are the 3 English players in the MI Emirates team. Smeed recently became the first player in the history of the Hundred cricket to score a century. Samit Patel is a veteran English all-rounder who has proved his mettle with both bat and the ball, whereas Jordan Thompson has also impressed in the last few seasons. MI Emirates get Kieron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo, Nicholas Pooran & Trent Boult on board for UAE T20 league. “Striking a balance between experience & investing in young players is the key,” says Akash Ambani. — KSR (@KShriniwasRao) August 12, 2022 Veteran South African spinner Imran Tahir will also be a part of the MI Emirates along with Afghanistan’s chinaman bowler Zahir Khan. There is a dutch connection as well in Bas de Leede.

Shikhar Dhawan was initially named as the captain for this tour. But with Rahul being given the go-ahead, he has been appointed as the captain with Dhawan taking deputy duties. ''The BCCI Medical Team has assessed KL Rahul and cleared him to play in the upcoming three-match ODI series in Zimbabwe. The All-India Senior Selection Committee has appointed him the captain of the side and named Shikhar Dhawan as his deputy,'' the BCCI said in a statement. After the conclusion of IPL 2022, Rahul was scheduled to captain India in the home T20Is against South Africa but missed out owing to a groin injury. The spell on the sidelines was extended after it was revealed that the 30-year-old would require surgery. Consequently, Rahul missed the tour of England and Ireland. The opener was scheduled to return at the just-concluded tour of West Indies and USA but following a positive Covid-19 result, the BCCI medical team advised him to rest. He has already been named in India's squad for the Asia Cup at the end of this month. All the three ODIs of India's tour of Zimbabwe will be held at the Harare Sports Club. India's squad for 3 ODIs: KL Rahul (Captain) Shikhar Dhawan (vice-captain), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shubman Gill, Deepak Hooda, Rahul Tripathi, Ishan Kishan (wicket-keeper), Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Avesh Khan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohd Siraj, Deepak Chahar.

The ongoing summer season for England batter Jason Roy hasn’t gone according to plans on the back of an extended lean patch as far as runs coming from his bat are concerned. Roy, 32, even flopped in his first-ever match as captain in representative cricket last night. Opening the batting with all-rounder Sunil Narine in an Oval Invincibles vs Northern Superchargers The Hundred 2022 match at The Oval, Roy returned to the pavilion after scoring 0 (2) in a 158-run chase. Yet to be dropped from any team for now, Roy continues to play on past reputation amid receiving immense support from team members and former cricketers. Having said that, Roy’s form is doubtlessly a concern with an ICC T20 World Cup to be played in about a couple of months from now. Considering how batters, both senior and junior to Roy, are scoring runs at a brisk pace in order to presenting a case for themselves in England’s T20I squad, Roy would be hoping to end this rut as soon as possible. Jason Roy last 10 innings Since the start of July, Roy has scored 197 runs in 11 white-ball innings in international cricket. Roy’s average and strike rate of 17.90 and 81.74 is almost unacceptable for a player of his calibre. Taking only T20s into consideration, Roy has played his last 10 innings for Surrey Lions, England and Invincibles. In this period, Roy’s 144 runs have come at an average and strike rate of 14.40 and 104.34 respectively. Jason Roy needs a break. — Nikhil (@CricCrazyNIKS) August 11, 2022 Roy, who has crossed the 50-run mark just once since last month, would be wanting to create some impact in Oval’s next match against Southern Brave in front of a home crowd on Sunday.

The first season of the league was played in January this year in Muscat, Oman between three teams - India Maharajas, World Giants and Asia Lions - and comprised seven games. However, season 2 will have four franchise owned teams. There will be 15 matches, which will be played in six cities — Kolkata, Lucknow, Delhi, Jodhpur, Cuttack and Rajkot from September 17 to October 8. Former Indian captain and current BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has also confirmed that he would be participating in a very special match of the LLC. \"Enjoying the training to get ready to play for one off charity fundraising game for azadi ka mahotsav..75 years of Indian independence and also for women empowerment with the top legends of the legends league cricket @llct20 need to hit some cricket balls soon,\" wrote Ganguly on Instagram. However, the major concern before the organisers is visa availability for former Pakistan cricketers, who are also set to take part in the tournament. Questions are emerging that has the BCCI or the Government of India altered its stance vis-a-vis its cricketing ties with Pakistan. Notably, India and Pakistan haven't played a bilateral series for nearly a decade now and they only face each other in Asia Cup and ICC events due to political tensions between the two countries.The Indian Premier League (IPL) also doesn't allow Pakistan players to take part except in the first season of the league in 2008. Asked about the situation, few BCCI officials aren't much aware about the visa issue. \"I can't say much. If Pakistani cricketers get a visa from our government, then they will play if not then no. We (BCCI) have no role in the tournament or visa things,\" the official told IANS. Another official questioned, \"how can Pakistan's players be allowed to play on Indian soil when we have no cricketing ties with Pakistan. I am sure they will not get a visa.\" The LLC season 2 has a long list of former cricketers from Pakistan including Shoaib Akhtar, Misbah-ul Haq, Shahid Afridi and many others comprising the Asia and World XI teams.So, it will be interesting to see the Indian government's stance on giving visas to Pakistani players, especially when the nation doesn't have bilateral cricketing ties with the neighbouring country. It is also noticeable that all Pakistan cricketers, both former and current, many of whom are playing in the League are strong advocates and promoters of the Kashmir Premier League (KPL). The Government of India and BCCI have strongly objected and condemned the organising of the Kashmir Premier League (KPL) and have banned all cricketers playing in KPL from playing any form of cricket in India.

West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard is set to feature in the upcoming edition of the Big Bash League. For the first time in the history of the competition, an International draft will take place where some of the big names have registered for the same. The draft of the BBL will take place on 28 August 2022, and Cricket Australia is trying to rope in the biggest Australian superstars as well for the BBL this year. Although, the availability of overseas players is a bit of concern because of the clash with South Africa T20 League and ILT20 League. In a recent video on the BBL’s social media handle , Kieron Pollard was asked to pick a batter who he loves enjoying from the non-striker end. Pollard took the name of Rohit Sharma and said that Rohit’s batting looks like poetry to him. He insists that Rohit makes the game look easy. “Overall, I think I like to see Rohit Sharma bat. Every time I’m on the non-striker’s end and I am watching him in motion. It looks like poetry to me,” Kieron Pollard said. “How slow it seems to him as opposed to when I’m on strike. So I love to see him bat from the other hand because I love to see how he goes about things.” We all love watching @KieronPollard55 at work with the bat… but who does HE like watching? 🤔 (spolier alert: he’s a big fan of reverse sweeps…) #BBL12Draft pic.twitter.com/LyhY2Jto9K — KFC Big Bash League (@BBL) August 12, 2022 Apart from Rohit Sharma, Pollard also took the names of Hardik Pandya and Glenn Maxwell.

He said that he loves watching Maxwell reverse sweeping from the other end. “Hardik Pandya, his different enthusiasm in terms of how he hits. I love to see that. Even though I love to see Glenn Maxwell reverse sweeping fast bowlers, medium pacers, and spinners because I know I can’t do that so I can sit back and watch him,” Pollard added.","pubDate":"2022-08-12 08:28:27","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia donate prize money from Sri Lanka tour to support nation in economic crisis","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/australia-donate-prize-money-from-sri-lanka-tour-to-support-nation-in-economic-crisis-607233","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australia’s men’s cricket team players on Thursday said they have donated their prize money from the recent all-format tour of Sri Lanka to support children and families.","content":"Melbourne: Australia's men's cricket team players on Thursday said they have donated their prize money from the recent all-format tour of Sri Lanka to support children and families impacted by the island nation's economic crisis, the worst in decades for the country. The donation will be led by Test captain Pat Cummins, who is a UNICEF Australia ambassador, and white-ball skipper Aaron Finch. In all, the team will donate 45,000 Australia dollars (25,36,294 lakhs in INR) to the organisation's Sri Lanka appeal. The donation made by Australia men's cricketers will go towards UNICEF's programs to support nutrition, healthcare, safe drinking water, education, and mental health services for 1.7 million vulnerable Sri Lankan children in need. \"It was very clear to us how much day-to-day life for Sri Lankans is being impacted. When the team saw what was happening it was an easy decision to donate our prize money to UNICEF , who have been in Sri Lanka for more than 50 years supporting the needs of children and families,\" Cummins was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. The tour of Sri Lanka in June-July 2021 was Australia's first trip to the island nation since 2016. Australia won the T20I series 2-1 before Sri Lanka clinched the ODI series 3-2. The tour ended with the two-match Test series in Galle at 1-1. Since April this year, Sri Lanka has been in acute economic and social crisis due to daily power cuts, rising fuel prices and massive shortages of basic essentials like food and medicines. During Australia's second Test against Sri Lanka , peaceful protests happened around Galle International Cricket Stadium and in capital city Colombo apart from long lines by people for filing petrol in vehicles. In 2021, Cummins and Cricket Australia both donated 50,000 Australian dollars (28,18,621 lakhs in INR) for oxygen supplies during India's Covid-19 crisis, when the second wave wreaked havoc in 2021, that resulted in the postponement of the Indian Premier League (IPL) mid-way when the bio-bubbles were breached by the virus.

In the middle-order, the spinners are getting a fair share of their support, and they have been able to take wickets.

The right-hander had been flirting with his first century in professional cricket all year, making eye-catching scores of 97 and 99 for Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League, and then 94 not out and 98 for Somerset in the Blast. Last month, playing for England Lions, he also cracked a 56-ball 90 against the touring South Africans. But on Wednesday night, decked out in the Butterkist-sponsored orange livery of Birmingham Phoenix, Smeed made himself a future pub quiz answer by pummelling Southern Brave’s bowlers for an unbeaten 101 off 50 balls for the first hundred in the short history of the Hundred. Though the tournament statistically counts as Twenty20 cricket, its shorter innings – just 16.4 overs in old money – in part explain why it took a season and a bit to see a batter breach three-figures; Smeed’s teammate Liam Livingstone’s 40-ball 92 against Northern Superchargers last year was the previous highest score among the men. Suffice to say, Smeed didn’t muck about when setting up his side’s 53-run victory, muscling his half-century from 25 balls and his next 50 runs from one fewer. Eight fours and six sixes sent roars from Edgbaston echoing around the leafy suburbs of south Birmingham and Moeen Ali, his captain, thinks higher honours are inevitable. “There’s just something about him,” he said. “He’s got a really good hitting technique – very simple – and is strong. I watched him in the nets the other day and he just looked like an international player. You don’t come across those guys too often – Harry Brook at Yorkshire is another – where you think that.” Smeed’s two Lions outings this summer – the second of which is his only List A match to date – suggest he is very much on England’s radar. And with Jason Roy testing their loyalty in a low-key 2022, further scores in the Hundred may yet force a spot in the squad for the T20 tour of Pakistan this September and the T20 World Cup that follows.

Were an international debut to come so soon, it would probably be before Smeed’s first-class debut, much like when David Warner first turned out for Australia’s T20 side in 2009. The right-hander’s journey may be typical of the English system – private school, Bunbury cricket and a rise through Somerset’s pathway – but this would be quite the thing. Will Smeed in action for the Lions against South Africa last month. Photograph: Ryan Hiscott/Getty Images “It’s a big line in the sand for English cricket,” said Eoin Morgan, the former England captain. “He doesn’t play first-class cricket, he is predominantly a T20 cricketer and clearly exceptional in what he does, so potentially [it is] a new avenue for him into international cricket. “We’ve seen in other competitions around the world where domestic franchise tournaments, which attract big-name players, create domestic heroes. Will Smeed has become one of them.” We may be getting ahead of ourselves but, clearly, Smeed’s star is on the rise in a landscape that is shifting rapidly. As well as his PSL deal at Quetta, secured off the back of his Blast and Hundred performances last year, the 20-year-old has been signed by MI Emirates in the new ILT20 that takes place in the United Arab Emirates next January. Owned by Reliance, parent company of the Mumbai Indians, from here a plethora of franchise opportunities could follow. Smeed has said he has ambitions to play all three formats for England – but launching the white-ball, rather than wearing whites, is very much his current direction of travel.","pubDate":"2022-08-12 07:00:06","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39aaa1ba9c2cc7d8cec35d1de42dd8fea9279fc0/0_141_3758_2255/master/3758.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8d2ad068ea544f9932c378690bb2352","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IRE vs AFG Dream11 Team Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s Ireland vs Afghanistan 3rd T20I match at Stormont, Belfast, 8:00 PM IST, August 12","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ire-vs-afg-dream11-team-prediction-fantasy-cricket-hints-captain-probable-playing-11s-team-news-injury-updates-for-today-s-ireland-vs-afghanistan-3rd-t20i-match-at-stormont-belfast-800-pm-ist-august-12-2496162.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Ireland vs Afghanistan Dream11 Team Prediction Ireland vs Afghanistan 3rd T20I match - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of IRE vs AFG, Ireland Dream11 Team Player List, Afghanistan Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips","content":"Ireland will take on Afghanistan in the 3rd T20I of the 5-match series on Friday (August 12).

The left-arm fast bowler played 2 T20s for Mumbai in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in January last year and has now parted ways with his domestic team. Arjun applied for a NOC (No Objection Certificate) from the Mumbai Cricket Association as the 22-year-old didn't get a chance to play in the Ranji Trophy after being included in the squad last season. He was then dropped from the squad in the knockout stages. (Babar Azam left FURIOUS due to THIS, replies 'apko main budha lagta hu?...') \"Getting maximum game time on the ground is important for Arjun at this juncture of his career. We believe that the shift will improve the probability of Arjun featuring in more competitive matches. He is embarking on a new phase of his cricketing career,\" SRT Sports Management said in a statement. Tendulkar played two unofficial Tests for India's Under-19 side against Sri Lanka and was also a part of the Mumbai Indians franchise developmental squad with the likes of Kumar Kartikeya and Dewald Brevis.

He was dropped from the side without even being given a single chance to prove that he can do something or not. Goa Cricket Association (GCA) president Suraj Lotlikar said Arjun Tendulkar is expected to be considered among the state's pre-season probables. \"We have been looking out for left-hand bowling talent [and to] also add players to the middle order with multiple skills. In this context, we invited Arjun Tendulkar to join the Goa side. We will be playing pre-season trial matches (white ball) and he will be playing in those games.

We are sitting on a gold mine. Our players should be paid on par with international footballers and NBA stars, in millions of dollars.” In March 2005, a junior cricket administrator called Lalit Modi left mouths agape with these words at a Test match between India and Pakistan. Kolkata Knight Riders’ Jacques Kallis and Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during the 2011 IPL. Credit: AP Seventeen years on, and the figurative gas Modi lit under the pot containing the frog called international cricket is starting to bubble. That market is now worth something like Modi’s figure, via the latest Indian Premier League rights deal added to those for internationals. Cricket’s global talents are agitating ever more vocally for a schedule more to their liking and earning capacity. This has been underlined by the reversion of Trent Boult to a casual contract with New Zealand, Ben Stokes’ ODI retirement for England, Chris Lynn’s imminent flight to the new UAE Twenty20 league, and David Warner’s bargain for the richest Big Bash League deal ever seen for an incumbent Australian cricketer. In parallel, the UAE and South Africa T20 tournaments have further crunched an already crowded southern summer, flushed with money invested by many of the same Indian corporate backers first stirred by Modi nearly two decades ago. Though all profess a love for cricket, their playing talent is entirely supplied by the pipeline of cricket governing bodies, their local and junior competitions. Even the game’s richest boards outside India; Australia and England, are facing a new reality where their lucrative central contracts are not necessarily enough to stop players from seeking greater flexibility to earn more dollars elsewhere. Both are exploring the possibilities of boosting their own revenues with private capital for the first time. The future tours program from 2023-27 will be unveiled in coming days, squeezing around 10 per cent more bilateral matches into the calendar. The temperature in the pot is rising. As recently as five years ago, there was greater optimism about the ability of cricket’s decision-makers to have international cricket and domestic leagues in more or less a happy co-existence. In sculpting the first men’s schedule with Test and 50-over leagues, hope existed for new international growth and, moreover, significant third-party audiences for series beyond the two competing nations. Then Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland in 2017. Credit: Robert Cianflone As then Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland put it in December 2016: “The conversation we’re having is a bit about limiting the amount of cricket so we find an appropriate equilibrium where international players are available and want to play. International cricket should be about the best playing the best.” Somewhat more ominously, he added a caveat. “I’ve said at ICC level and will continue to say that to try to have the calendar full of cricket and have players moving from one to the next is shortening their international careers. I continue to be concerned about that.” In 2022, with boards still trying to recoup money from two years affected by COVID-19, the schedule of matches is set to reflect a patchwork of bilateral deals and broadcast rights agreements with less context than the program before it. The ODI league has been abandoned, and T20 internationals continue to be played in a vacuum. The Test championship has survived, but may struggle to do so beyond 2027. At the same time, the ICC is in the market to sell its package of global events for men and women, including T20 and 50-over World Cups and the latest resurrection of a “mini-World Cup” last played by the men in 2017. Increasingly, the windfalls from these events are what the majority of ICC member boards cling to for the funds that keep them going. Only India, England and Australia are wholly solvent on their own. Many predictions about the future of cricket have been made over the years, largely linked to India’s growing domination and the need for international cricket to make room for the T20 circuit. Few administrators, however, appear to have foreseen the scenario now confronting them in the UAE - also the headquarters of the ICC. Gathered for the IPL final in Ahmedabad on May 30, administrators from numerous countries got their heads around a couple of sobering realities. Not only would the league happen, but bankrolled by a combination of UAE and Indian cash it would present players with contract offers worth as much as $US500,000 - outstripping every global league apart from the IPL itself. Australia’s men’s cricket team lifted their first T20 World Cup in Dubai last year. Credit: Getty Under regulations already approved by ICC members, the league would allow clubs to field up to nine overseas players in an XI, requiring just two local players. Combined with the money on offer, the sheer scale of contract approaches being made around the world caused CA in particular to stagger in ways previously experienced by boards such as West Indies, New Zealand and South Africa. Warner, the headline name, was only one of 15 Australians approached. The response? A demand from boards for greater regulation of domestic T20 leagues. Here, however, the irony was rich. As far back as 2018, ICC management had formed a working group for exactly these regulations, only to find them repeatedly scuppered by the view that domestic T20 leagues are not the concern of the global body. The retreat from this territorial attitude was so dramatic as to cause whiplash. “We want to see cricket grow all around the world, across full members and associate members,” CA’s chief executive Nick Hockley says. “Certainly, the landscape’s changing quickly, and I think it’s really important that world cricket works together to ensure the overall health of the overall system and a reasonable check on the number of overseas players for domestic leagues.” Now seen as critical are the next round of ICC meetings in Australia during the T20 World Cup in October. In accordance with the new demands, ICC management are expected to dust off a four-year-old working group proposals for the following: standardised release fees for overseas players to compensate their boards, a minimum standard of four local players per T20 league playing XI, and ICC oversight of the founding of T20 leagues in any country, whether full member or associate. Heath Mills, head of the New Zealand players association, remembers well when he knew the island nation’s cricket was in a whole new universe - as far back as 2007. “Like a lightning rod,” he laughs. “That was the advent of the ICL initially, which we lost 10 players to, Shane Bond being the highest profile of those. Then the IPL came along shortly thereafter. “We had an England tour in 2008 right after the first IPL, and our players were at the IPL and arrived three days before the first Test and missed the warm-up matches. That was a really difficult time for us in New Zealand. We were confronted with the issue for the first time, and there were many people saying, ‘Country comes first, no one should be playing in these leagues’, players called traitors and so on. “But we very quickly were able to work with NZC and get them to understand you can’t fight this, you can’t stop a player from going somewhere else to play. One of the mantras we have here is that if a player doesn’t want to play for you anymore, you need to let them go because you don’t want a player playing for you who doesn’t want to be there.” For the boards of Australia and England in particular, this sounds like the doomsday scenario. Players and agents calling much more of their own tune, accepting overseas deals and not being subject to anything like the same contractual restrictions. Shortly before his decision to step back from internationals, Boult had played in the IPL final for Rajasthan Royals, hopped on a plane and bowled so well in his one training session that he played a Test match in England two days later. “They were initially thinking he wouldn’t play that first Test, but he stepped off the plane and was bowling really well and got picked,” Mills says. “It’s really ironic because you’ll see some people say ‘we didn’t go well because we had players at the IPL’, but our best performers were those who did come from the IPL - Trent Boult, Daryll Mitchell. It’s certainly not an impediment to performance. “I would hope they look at what we’ve done but also what we’ve achieved. The last 10 years, the team’s performed pretty well. It’s made the final of world events, won the Test championship, performing more consistently than ever. Commercially, NZC is doing better than it’s ever done before. So, those arguments around it affecting performance and commercial revenue, they don’t add up.” Over coming months, similar compromises may need to be made in Australia. The Australian Cricketers Association chief Todd Greenberg agrees that the water temperature is rising, but would still prefer to see the vast majority of players do as much as they can to raise the value of the Big Bash League and the Australian summer before seeking the freelance path of Boult, Lynn and others. “It’s a reminder for all of us globally that we’re in a very competitive marketplace, and players have significant choice, ” Greenberg says. “They have to make considered choices, and that landscape’s changing. It’s been changing over the last five to 10 years but over the last six to 12 months it feels like it’s changed quicker than maybe at any time in the game’s history.” For every Pat Cummins, Ben Stokes, Virat Kohli or Kane Williamson there are thousands of kids in their respective countries learning to play the game and aspiring to achieve something like their heroes. Perhaps the most unsettling question raised by the bubbling pot is how much of that network would be placed at risk by a cricket landscape increasingly powered by private owners with bottom lines as their top priorities. Similarly, the matter of how broad-minded and altruistic Indian corporate backers would be of the world game, when a future more akin to the NFL, NBA or MLB would likely earn them just as much money if not more, is a subject ever more present in the minds of administrators. Pat Cummins is an inspiration for young cricketers. Credit: Getty Images Players, too, have a possible pothole ahead. The BCCI does not recognise players associations, nor do IPL owners. As much as wages are expected to go up and up - the IPL salary cap for 2023 will at least double - the lack of collective bargaining leaves unpaid or mistreated players without recourse. One administrator, asked whether these discussions had taken place, replied: “No. For now it’s mainly about how good the money is.” Famously, Kerry Packer reshaped the cricket world in 1977. Within two years, however, he had handed back control of the game (albeit on incredibly generous financial terms for him) because he never wanted to run cricket, only to monetise its highest profile layer. In the precious lapse of time between international cricket noticing the water getting uncomfortably hot, and the moment at which it is too late to do anything about its circumstances, difficult decisions must be made about where it might jump to for safety.

These developments happen after it was reported that the star players of the Pakistan team were miffed with the board as several clauses in it did not suit their personal preferences. The contracts were presented to them on June 30th. The PCB had certain plans in place and had announced separate red ball and white ball contracts for the first time in their cricketing history. A total of 33 players were included in the contract out of which few of them opted to seek legal help just to understand the intricacies of their new contract. The players had initially signed the respective documents before they flew away to the Netherlands to participate in a three-match ODI series and had kept a condition that the PCB should look into the contracts and make required changes. Reports further say that the Pakistan Cricket Board is looking to have a detailed discussion with the players once they are back in the country and start preparing for the Asia Cup which is to be played in United Arab Emirates (UAE) starting from August 27, 2022. As of now, the cricket board has assured the players that their feedback will be taken into account and a better contract will be presented to them. PCB had to make the amends very quickly as there was a possibility of star players like Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridi flying out before signing their respective contracts. The Pakistan players were seriously unhappy with a particular clause in their contracts which was around their participation in overseas T20 leagues. It was learned that the PCB had denied issuing NOCs to certain players who were looking forward to competing in major T20 tournaments like the Big Bash League (BBL) and the International League T20 (ILT20). Pakistan will face the Netherlands on August 16, 2022, and will look to give game time to all the players who are set to compete in the upcoming Asia Cup.","pubDate":"2022-08-12 05:37:01","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Near-death experience won’t stop Indian cricket commentator from calling the game in Afghanistan","link":"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/indian-cricket-commentator-devender-kumar-bomb-blast-afghanistan-sphageeza-league-match-kabul-stadium-taliban/article65759780.ece","keywords":null,"creator":["\n        Shayan Acharya  \n    "],"video_url":null,"description":"Devender Kumar fell in love with commentary and wanted to find a career in it.

In 2017, there was a blast during the tournament, but it happened outside the stadium. It was a harrowing moment for all of us,” the 36-year-old says. Reuters , quoting a spokesman for the Kabul Commander, reported that it was grenade explosion. “As soon as I heard the explosion, the security officers rushed us to the commentary box. The players, too, were shocked, but senior player Shapoor Zadran appealed to the crowd to vacate the stadium, after which the area was cleaned up and the match resumed,” Devender says. With the players and the officials still reeling from the shock, the second innings was curtailed to 10 overs. “Once the crowd was dispersed, we ensured that the broadcast was not hampered, and we even conducted the post-match ceremonies before heading back to the hotel.” Despite the nightmarish turn of events, Devender decided not to return to India and stayed back till the tournament got over on August 5. “This is my job, so I wanted to fulfil my professional commitments and then head back home. I feel that death is not in our hands,” he says. Back home now, Devender distinctly remembers that evening. “After coming back to the hotel, I could not sleep all night. Amid frantic calls and messages from friends and family, I kept thinking about those who were injured. It is then that I decided to stay back,” he says. “I told my parents not to panic. My father is a former army-man, so he knows what one goes through in such a situation, but obviously, the other members of the family were scared,” he says. “But the people and the cricket fans of Afghanistan have always been welcoming and cordial and I wanted to make sure that I do my commentary job sincerely and call an exciting final.” When he walked to the stadium the next morning, the security was beefed up and movements were restricted. “But even then, it was a packed stadium. And that proved how much Afghanistan loves its cricket. Later in the day, we heard that some players from Pakistan were heading back home, but I told the ACB officials that I would stay back,” he says. Devender, hailing from a village near Jodhpur, fell in love with commentary and wanted to find a career in it. But it was a challenge as he needed to improve his English-speaking skills. “There was no English teacher in our village school, even Hindi was taught in Marwari. So, for a long time, I did not understand English commentary beyond ‘Howzzat’. But the voice of Tony Greig and Geoffrey Boycott inspired me to learn the language and start commentary. I am glad I could do that,” he says. In a bid to watch more cricket, Devender – just 20 then – shifted to Jaipur in 2006-07. Chasing his dreams of becoming a cricket commentator, Devender initially did not have a place to stay. “Back in those days, there was no money, and my only objective was to watch cricket at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur and hone my commentary skills. There would be days when I would just have one meal a day,” Devender reminisces. But that did not stop him from pursuing his passion. Every morning, sharp at seven o’clock, he would walk about 10 kilometres to reach the Sawai Mansingh Stadium and watch the training session of the Rajasthan Ranji Trophy team. Greg Chappell had just been appointed the head of the RCA Academy and the Rajasthan team would train under the watchful eyes of the Australian legend. “I would sit at one corner and practice my commentary. Greg sir observed me regularly and a few months later, he gifted me a cap, which I still treasure. Ever since, I would always reach the stadium sharp at seven o’ clock in the morning and watch the training sessions,” he says. “That continued for years. I would watch each match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium and that’s how I got to know Alan Wilkins, Danny Morrison and Harsha Bhogle, who inspired me to chase my dreams.” @SteelyDan66 loved ur company in d commentary box.ur zesture of bringing lunch for me was a moving experience.ur mentoring much appreciated pic.twitter.com/NbgDYMwnmv While he was slowly getting opportunities to do small assignments in local polo matches or club cricket, it took Devender quite a while to bag an international opportunity. “In 2017, I got a call from Afghanistan Cricket Board for an assignment for their national and international tournaments. I still don’t know who referred me, but it seemed that the ACB had a fair bit of idea about my work,” Devender says. And that’s how his journey with Afghanistan started. With the international leagues mushrooming across the globe, young commentators like Devender often travel far and wide to gain experience and earn a living. “For me, it was never about the money. The first time I travelled to Kabul, the people were so welcoming, and over the years, the bond has only grown stronger,” he says. “This time, too, when I reached the Kabul airport, the immigration officials assured security. The players, the ACB officials were so supportive that in their times of crisis, I could not let them down. Over the last few years, I have travelled to Kabul regularly and have always felt at home. Every time I come back from Afghanistan I return with happy stories.” This trip was no different. “Before the blast, I travelled to the interiors of Afghanistan, and it was a fascinating experience. The people were welcoming, and they always treated me as one of their own,” he says. Even after the blast when the Pakistan players left Kabul, Devender’s decision to stay back earned him praise. “On the last day of my trip, the ACB chairman and leaders from the Taliban, who now rule the country, came to my hotel along with some international cricketers to thank me for staying back,” he says. “Even Gulbadin Naib and several cricketers took to social media to thank me.” @asdevender_bbc Thanks for your love and support with @ACBofficials and our Nation in this difficult time. We never forget your great efforts and respect to give us. Safe flight ✈️ Hope see you next year.👍🏻 pic.twitter.com/i6o0yyXMKl Despite the near-death experience, Devender wants to go back to Kabul soon. “The spirit of the Afghanistan people has inspired me over the years,” he says, “My years of hardship have taught me not to give up and with so much love from the people, I would pack my bags and go back again.

According to a report by ESPNcricinfo, the group of players signed the dotted lines before departing for the Netherlands tour on the condition that they will once again hold discussions over a couple of other clauses in the contract with the board post the Asia Cup in September. The senior players have expressed reservations about few aspects of the contracts. \"These range from questions around the NOC process for participation in foreign leagues, to seeking more information about image rights in ICC events and shares from participation fees at ICC events and clauses around signing individual endorsements,\" the report said. The PCB announced 33 central contracts this season, splitting between white and red-ball players for the first time 2022-23. As per the board's standard practice, while the copies of the contract were handed to the players at the start of the pre-tour camp in Lahore, many of the players belonging to the lower categories signed the dotted lines but the senior stars did not sign immediately. Apart from Babar, Afridi, and Rizwan, the group also included Shadab Khan , Fakhar Zaman and Hasan Ali . The players sought more time as they wanted to discuss the nitty-gritty of the contracts with their advisers and lawyers, given there is no players body in the country. In the past, Pakistan cricketers rarely disputed any aspect of their central contracts signed and returned their them straightaway. Historically, the Pakistan board also never formally negotiated with the cricketers while framing contracts on their part. Therefore, this new development could be seen as some sort of a marker of sorts in the equation between the board and the cricketers. According to the central contracts, the monthly retainer amounts and match fees were not among the points of contention. All players will receive match fees of Rs. 838,530 PKR (approx. US$3800) for a Test, Rs. 515,696 PKR for an ODI (approx. US$2300) and PKR 372,075 (approx. US$1700) for a T20I. Promoted On the other hand, the retainer for a top Pakistan red-ball contract is PKR 1,050,000 per month (approx. US$4700) and PKR 950,000 (approx. US$4300) for a corresponding white-ball contract.

Just before the start of the Asia Cup which will be played in the T20I format, the Indian team has faced a major setback that might hamper their game plans before going into a tournament like this. Indian pacer, Jasprit Bumrah has been left out of the side owing to a serious injury. Unfortunately, India's key bowler in the T20I format, Harshal Patel will also miss this tournament due to injury issues. Apart from Bumrah and Patel, Shami has not been included in the side as he is being considered only for Test matches and ODIs as of now. The World Cup is fast approaching and is only two months away as of today. Teams across the globe are busy preparing for it. With Jasprit Bumrah missing out, India will have to reconsider their plans for the event. Reports from Inside Sports have now surfaced that a source close to BCCI has spilled the beans about Bumrah's injury and it is not a very pleasing one. Jasprit Bumrah has aggravated his injury and he might miss the all-important World Cup. The time left for the World Cup to start might not be enough for Bumrah to regain his full fitness. As of now, Bumrah is one of the finest fast bowlers on the international arena and if he misses out, India will have loads of issues at their disposal.

Today, any cricket match between the two nations is one of the most watched events on the global sporting calendar -- and victory used to promote their respective nationalism. So strong is the rivalry between the countries that they can't even share the date of the partition which gave them independence, with Pakistan celebrating it on August 14 and India a day later. \"India playing Pakistan involves the sentiments of millions,\" said Wasim Akram, one of cricket's all-time greats and now a commentator. \"You become a hero if you perform well... you are portrayed as a villain if your team loses,\" said the former Pakistan skipper. Matches ignite great fervour but they have also defused military tensions between the two nations, which have fought four wars since independence from Britain in 1947. During one period of sabre rattling in 1987, as troops massed along their frontier, Pakistan's military ruler General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq showed up unannounced in New Delhi -- ostensibly to watch a match between the two. The move, as crafty as any a cricket captain could conjure up on the field, led to a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and tensions eased. - 'Mother of all matches' - Still, the on-field rivalry has spilled off the cricket pitch for now. The neighbours have not played a Test since 2007, instead meeting only in the shorter versions of the game and at multi-team competitions on foreign soil, rather than head-to-head series at home. When they do play -- as they will at the Asia Cup later this month in the United Arab Emirates -- cricket fans around the world are glued to their TV screens, a multibillion-dollar bonanza for broadcasters. The 2019 50-over World Cup clash between India and Pakistan drew 273 million viewers, while 167 million watched them in last year's Twenty20 World Cup. \"Nothing can match an Indo-Pakistan bilateral series because it is played in a different league,\" former prime minister and cricket captain Imran Khan, who led Pakistan to World Cup glory in 1992, said in a Sky Sports documentary. \"The atmosphere is filled with tension, pressure and enjoyment.\" Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Faisal Hasnain called games against India the \"mother of all cricket matches\". \"Fans want these two countries to play each other on a regular basis but resumption is only likely when there is a thaw in relations,\" he told AFP. \"We can only wait and hope that happens.\" - Practice fodder - Introduced to the sub-continent in the 18th century, cricket was played mostly by its white colonial rulers, but locals learned the game by being used as bowling or batting fodder in the practice nets. India won Test status in 1932, but after partition most Muslim players -- including three who had played for the national team -- migrated to Pakistan, who had to build from scratch. Pakistan's first Test, appropriately, was against India, in 1952 -- and they were led by Abdul Hafeez Kardar, one of the three double internationals. Since then Pakistan and India have played 59 Tests, with Pakistan winning 12, India nine, and the rest drawn. In ODIs Pakistan also have the edge, but India have won seven of their nine T20 encounters. In the women's game, India have won all 11 of their ODIs and 10 of their 12 Twenty20s since first meeting in 2005. The advent of one-day cricket has only boosted the rivalry with one commentator calling their clashes \"war minus shooting\". In 1991, Aaqib Javed’s seven-wicket haul, including a hat-trick, helped Pakistan win the Wills Trophy in Sharjah in a match that ended in near-darkness, sparking outrage from the losing Indian side and fans. \"They whinged about it for months,\" Aaqib said drily. But Pakistan fans have also shown their bile, sending death threats to Wasim Akram after he withdrew from a key final against India because of injury. \"At times the fans' reaction is intolerable,\" Akram said. Former Indian batsman Sanjay Manjrekar said he misses regular clashes against Pakistan. \"It was my favourite opposition for all the entertainment they provided on the field with their banter,\" he told AFP. \"Plus the fact that they were a damn good side.\"","pubDate":"2022-08-12 04:45:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"bangkokpost","country":["thailand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Dave Houghton: ‘We aren’t here to add up to the numbers.

At a time when a bounce back looked impossible, the legendary Dave Houghton took charge as the head coach of the side. And within six weeks, he turned things around as Zimbabwe went to make the cut for the T20 World Cup qualifying rounds. The Chevrons - as the team is referred to - took things a step further by clinching its first T20I series over a higher-ranked Bangladesh. It was also its first bilateral series win in the shortest format. Earlier this week, the side kept the momentum going and bagged the ODI series against Bangladesh 2-1. While he is happy with the team’s progress, Houghton believes that if the boys continue to play fearless cricket, it has the potential to put up a strong fight against India in the three-match ODI series, beginning next week. On Thursday, Houghton spoke to Sportstar from Harare on the team’s transformation and his expectations from the series against India… When I took over the team six weeks ago, they were on a losing spree and the spirit was quite let down. The biggest change I have tried to bring back is to give them a freedom to play. They were so scared of making mistakes, of losing, so on and so forth. There would be a lot of shouting in the change room and they were playing this fearful brand of cricket where they could not express themselves at all. I had been here last year working in the local domestic and franchise cricket and I said all of last year that I thought the skillset was amazing and these guys were really good players. Literally, a week after (taking over), when we went to Bulawayo for the T20 qualifiers, everyone was playing with a smile on their face and was expressing themselves - sometimes maybe a bit too much, but I wasn’t going to stop that. If someone wants to reverse sweep in the first ball, I would like that intent from them. I like the fact that they enjoy playing like that with a big smile on their face. They enjoy what they are doing and all we have done is that we have started understanding every game and our skills is starting to show up now. Our bowling and fielding is as good as its been even before my time. On top of that, we have some batters who are really expressing themselves. It’s all going well at the moment, but it will be a huge test against India because we are playing the strongest side in the world. But I would still expect us to put up a good performance and compete really well. Obviously having somebody like Raza in the form that he has been is amazing. You also put together with that because having one player in that sort of form brings courage to the rest of the team. You suddenly get Innocent Kaia scoring a great hundred and then Regis Chakbva gets his first ODI hundred in the next match and that’s a good innings I have seen from anybody in this country. I think the a lot of enjoyment that guys are getting in terms of expressing themselves is really paying off and they are able to go out and fearlessly play their game. That’s why we have been able to turn the corner and play some quite nice cricket. Having watched so much of Indian cricket and the IPL over the last few years, we know that India could probably put out three or four sides and perhaps be first, second, third, fourth in world cricket. Whatever side they send to us, we know it is going to be a strong and experienced side in terms of the amount of international cricket they play and it will be tough work for us. But before we dispersed for a few days after last night’s game, I told the boys in the dressing room that India coming here is a good opportunity for us to really score and get good results against one of the best sides in the world. I told them that, I want us to believe that we aren’t here just to add up to the numbers and watch India play really good cricket, but we are here to challenge. I am hoping in these three games, we can challenge India really hard. We are not happy with the starts we are getting and that’s one of the areas I would like to work on, especially with our top-order batters. Also, we have been hamstrung by a few injuries and are missing some seniors like Sean Williams, Craig Erwin. It’s not that the youngsters don’t have the skills to replace them, but it’s just that they don’t have that experience. So, I am trying to see if we can get a better top-order start. Our bowling and fielding against Bangladesh have been exceptional, and I am happy with those two departments. The biggest thing for me is that we have to go out there with the belief that we can win. That’s a change we have made over the last few months and hopefully they will continue to believe and come out like that against India. If they do, we will play well and can put up a serious contest against the Indian side. I have seen that whole history. Right back to the 1980s, I have been playing against the India A side. In 1992, when we got Test status, our first Test match was against India, so we have a big history with India. You could possibly call this little series a rebirth of Zimbabwe cricket and India is involved again. We have got a great sporting history with India, may it continue for a long, long time. But come next week, we want to win. I knew what these guys could do. They know me and they treat me with unbelievable respect, which is amazing. My word is quite good to them in the changing room. I made a few promises when I came in - I told them that I would not reprimand anybody or shout or scream at anybody if they played a foul shot because my biggest thing was to bring back the fearlessness in the team where they could express themselves. Right from the time I took over six weeks ago, I took them to a game park where we had a nice afternoon, followed by a barbeque in the evening. We spoke about this for 10 minutes. We did not talk about technique or special skills or what we are going to do in terms of our cricket. I just told them that they can now play fearlessly and that’s been the turnaround for us. It’s not that we don’t do our homework about the teams we are playing, of course we do that. We do our statistical examinations and get the guys watch the videos of the opposition. Lance Klusener, the batting coach, has been brilliant in terms of talking to the lads before they play. We do our technical work but without taking out the fear, we would never improve. Now, hopefully, we can improve. I am not saying we are invincible. I am sure we will have many bad days, in the last ODI against Bangladesh, we were in trouble with nine down for 90, but even our No. 10 and No. 11 came out and played shots to add another 60 runs. They entertained the people and that’s the kind of cricket I want our boys to continue to play. We will have bad days, but we will have a lot more good days. That’s really guesswork at the moment as to what’s going on. Everyone will have their opinions. I am a traditionalist, I can watch five days of Test cricket, I love it. But it’s not that I don’t like other formats, I do, but it’s just that I am more interested in Test cricket. I am seeing the guys who are retiring or not signing their contracts anymore - for instance, Ben Stokes retired from ODIs, Trent Boult is not signing his contract with New Zealand Cricket. I think what might happen over the next 10 years or so is that you will end up having all these franchise tournaments throughout the world, just like football Premier League and you will end up having small gaps where international cricket can be played. So, roles will be slightly reversed, that’s what I think will happen over the next 10 years or so.

Rahul’s addition took the squad strength to 16 as the selectors didn’t replace any player. But Rahul’s presence means that there is virtually no chance for Ruturaj Gaikwad to get a game in this series. There will be no Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Jasprit Bumrah or Mohammed Shami for this series as they have all been rested. Bumrah, however, is nursing a back injury and is already ruled out of the Asia Cup in the UAE, starting August 27. Rahul and Deepak Hooda are the only two players in the main squad. — PTI Chakabva to lead Zimbabwe Harare: Batter Regis Chakabva will lead a 17-member Zimbabwe squad in the three-match ODI series against India.
