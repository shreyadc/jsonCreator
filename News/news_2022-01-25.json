Kohli recently relinquished Test captaincy after his team’s 1-2 defeat against a weak South African side but for the leg-spin wizard, Kohli's biggest contribution is being the foremost flag-bearer of cricket's hardest form. “Virat was a very good leader and he inspired his teammates. I think on the tactical side he could have improved on but as far as being a leader is concerned, I think he inspired his teammates all the time,” Warne told news agency PTI during an exclusive interaction while promoting his documentary ‘Shane’. For Warne, the way Kohli promoted Test cricket has increased the former India captain’s respect by manifold. “First of all I have got nothing but the utmost respect for Virat Kohli. I think he is a terrific cricketer and great ambassador for the game. I think we should all thank Virat Kohli and the BCCI for pushing Test cricket and because it’s the no. 1 format,” the holder of 709 Test wickets said. FIFTY! A well-made half-century for @imVkohli .

Test is hardest form of our sport. If India and Virat Kohli wouldn’t have put the emphasis on Test cricket, a lot of other countries might have just fell away, but through Virat, he really pushed Test cricket. “I for one is very thankful to Virat and BCCI for the way he goes about it and he is fantastic for the game,” Warne said. On the documentary, Warne has been overwhelmed by the response he has received so far. “I am very proud of it and I have been blown away by the feedback. People have loved it, got inspired by it, so for me to do it as I have been in the public eye for over 30 years. So to touch some of the stuff that happened 30 years ago and look back, it has been pretty interesting,” Warne added.

After the cricket world celebrated a phenomenal series between South Africa and India, which followed the one-sided yet intriguing Ashes campaign, the game’s hidden secret once again garnered headlines around the world. A little more than two decades after Hansie Cronje’s disturbing fall from grace, match fixing reared its head to send shockwaves throughout the world. Its latest target, former Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor. Monday night’s revelations were equally shocking as disturbing, with the former wicket-keeper batsman once the glue holding the proud African nation together during a period of deep destabilisation and unrest. In his troubling statement via Twitter, Taylor admits to falling to cricket’s trap. “I’d fallen for it. I’d willingly walked into a situation that has changed my life forever,” he wrote in a remorseful and open statement.

Join Kayo Now > De Kock ton completes whitewash of India | 01:49 Former England captain Michael Vaughan was one of the many cricket identities to react to the sad situation. “This is so sad,” he tweeted. “I hope he can find a way to get better.” Yet, this sorry tale is not the first and, certainly, it would seem, not the last. Here is a road map to cricket’s sorry legacy. - THE CALL THAT SOUNDED ALARM BELLS - If it sounds good to be true, it probably is. Twenty two years ago, cricket applauded a bold piece of captaincy from South African captain Cronje. After days of rain, their home Test against England appeared all but over. That was until Cronje approached his counterpart, Nasser Hussain, and asked whether both teams would declare and leave England requiring 248 runs in a little more than two sessions. England would go on to win the Test by two wickets. Hussain, oblivious to the ulterior motives, showered his counterpart in praise. “I hope Hansie gets the credit he deserves,” he said. Cronje did. Papers around the world called it “a triumph for all too rare positive thinking” and “brave, positive and brilliant” in another.

Source: News Corp Australia Yet, eyebrows were raised at Lord’s, the home of cricket, for his move, which went against tradition. Even Cronje’s teammates were left aghast. “I must be honest - I thought it was a terrible idea,” Mark Boucher wrote in his autobiography, Through My Eyes.”(Jacques) Kallis also thought it was wrong and so did (Lance) Klusener. The feeling among the junior section of the dressing room was that Test matches are never, ever to be messed with. You never give your opponents a sniff of victory in Tests unless you are desperate to win yourselves. There was a simmering atmosphere of anger.’’ The truth eventually came out three months later, when Delhi police revealed they had recordings of Cronje conspiring to fix matches with an Indian bookmaker. Three months further down the road, Cronje confessed and revealed he had sold the Test for £5,000 and a leather jacket. A mere nine months after the infamous Test, Cronje was banned from cricket for life and another two players, Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams, banned for four months after accepting their captain’s offer. Hansie Cronje supporters hold a sign lending support to the disgraced South African captain during a one day international match against Australia in Durban on 12 Apr, 2000. Source: News Limited The Cronje ordeal was meant to be a stake in the road. In reality, it was merely just the start of a murky, dark relationship with bookmakers, one that has only been clouded because of the rise of T20 cricket and franchise leagues across the globe. - ‘IT BE SUGGESTED THAT HUMANS ARE FALLIBLE. CRICKETERS ARE ONLY CRICKETERS’ - Cronje was not the end, he was merely just the beginning. On May 24, 2000, the Qayyum Report was finally released. In it, life bans were recommended for Pakistan great Salim Malik and Atu-ur-Rehman. Malik was also to be fined a million rupees. Mushtaq Ahmed and Wasim Akram, one of cricket’s greatest players, were given the benefit of reasonable doubt, although it was recommended that neither ever captain Pakistan again. Smaller fines were also handed out to Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Akram Raza and Saeed Anwar for failing to co-operate with the inquiry. Malik slammed the findings. “Why me alone when others have been let off with minor fines? Whether my cricket is finished or not, I have to live a life and I have been subjected to such tortuous allegations for a long time now, it is unjust,” he said. Former Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik in Lahore on 22 May, 2000 Source: AP Shane Warne recently accused Malik of offering him and Tim May $276,000 to underperform in a Test against him. Malik denied the claim. “Whenever a former cricketer launches his book or biography or anything of that sort, he tries to make things controversial to get maximum publicity,” Malik told Paktv.tv. Soon after, Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Sharma were banned for life and Ajay Jadeja and Manoj Prabhakar were banned for five years. In his report, Qayyum wrote: “To those who are disappointed with their fallen heroes, it be suggested that humans are fallible. Cricketers are only cricketers.” Off the back of the Qayyum Report, the ICC announced in June, 2000, it was hiring former Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Condon to run a new anti-corruption unit. - ‘IF ANYONE STILL HASN’T LEARNT A LESSON FROM OUR CASES, THEN HE WILL BE FOLLISH’ - A decade after the Cronje controversy, cricket was once again rocked. Not for the first time, Pakistan’s players were in the spotlight. But this time, it was one of the fresh faces of cricket, Mohammad Amir - a young man destined to do great things after a sparkling start to his career - that had fallen foul. The News of the World exposed another spot-fixing scandal, with captain Salman Butt and fast bowling duo Amir and Mohammad Asif who were accused. During the fourth Test against England, Pakistan lost by an innings and 225 runs. Pakistan lost 14 wickets on one day and were bowled out for 74 in their first innings. But it was the massive no-balls delivered by Amir that sent more alarm bells. The News of the World revelations merely confirmed the world’s doubts. All three were tried in a London court for offences under the Gambling Act and were jailed in November, 2011.

Amir, who pleaded guilty earlier than his teammates, subsequently received a five-year international ban and eventually returned to play for Pakistan once more. “To be honest, I never thought about my comeback and I feel seriously lucky to play Test cricket again,” Amir told AP ahead of his comeback Test at Lord’s - the stage where his world came crumbling down. “You call it a coincidence or whatever but, to me, it is a blessing that I am starting right from where I stopped in 2010. “I might have made my comeback months ago but Test cricket is what I was looking forward to and this is my real comeback. “I had missed five best years of my life and, had I continued playing cricket, everyone knows where I would have been standing today. “I have not forgotten 2010 ... and I want to supersede my past with a better future. I still hold those moments in my memory but I want to get my name on the honour board at Lord’s once again.” Pakistan's cricketers Mohammad Amir (C) and Mohammad Asif (rear) arrive at the Pakistan High Commission in London on 02/09/2010. Source: AP He added: “If anyone still hasn’t learnt a lesson from our cases, then he will be foolish,” Amir said. “Corruption in cricket should not be allowed and anyone caught (in future) should be banned for life.” The left-arm quick, who was the quickest in history to 50 wickets, made his return to Test cricket at Lord’s and played the last of his 36 matches against South Africa in 2019 before surprisingly retiring from international cricket. - YOU’RE ALWAYS LIVING WITH A NOOSE ROUND YOUR NECK WAITING TO BE BRIBED - Lou Vincent burst onto the scene by scoring a century on debut against a rock star Australian attack. For many, it was the start of something special. But the New Zealand cricketer’s career would never reach those same heights again. In 2014, seven years after playing his last international match, Vincent was found guilty of 11 counts of match-fixing. Even today, he is not allowed to enter a cricket stadium.

Source: News Limited After his international career came to an end and having hit a “wall of depression” he upped and left to the UK. The same year the Indian Cricket League (ICL), a rebel T20 tournament, was launched in India. Vincent decided to play the ICL to sustain himself. There, a bookie, posing as a bat-maker, contacted Vincent. It was not long until Vincent got sucked into the “honey trap”. “He got straight into it,” Vincent said, recounting the incident. “He said: ‘Listen, right, this is how the business works’ and he pulled out US$15,000 cash and set it on the table and said, ‘right that’s our down payment. We deal in cash. What we do is we bet inside games’. And I was like, ‘oh sh*t’ - that’s when the penny dropped that I’d just been completely honey-trapped into a bookie.” “Because we had education, I had probably sat through about 12 seminars during my cricketing career, sort of warning us of this but I was like oh, this is never going to happen to me, no chance it’s going to. Then it was like, oh sh*t, I’m in trouble here. He’s probably got cameras around the room recording what’s just happened and he’s given me US$15,000 cash, explaining how the betting system works and all that. I was like, oh I’ve got to get out this room. I said, ‘Listen okay cool, I’ll have a think about it. I’ll go downstairs and have a think about it.’” In his 2014 confession statement, Vincent had said he would regret his actions “for the rest of his life”.

In reality, that world has crumbled around Brendan Taylor since the start of the Covid-pandemic, which for most feels like years. “I’ve been carrying a burden for over two years now that has sadly taken me to some very dark places and had a profound effect on my mental health,” Taylor wrote in a statement released on Twitter, foreshadowing a “multi-year” ban for a four-month delay in reporting a match-fixing approach Taylor, who played 34 Tests, 202 ODIs and 45 T20Is for Zimbabwe from 2004 to 2021, admitted he took cocaine and a $15,000 bribe from an Indian businessman in 2019 — an interaction that caused his life to unravel. Brendan Taylor in action during the second ODI against Australia at Harare Sports Club on May 27 2004 in Harare. Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images The 35-year-old batsman said he was invited by an Indian businessman in October 2019 to discuss “sponsorships and the potential launch of a T20 competition in Zimbabwe and was advised that I would be paid USD$15 000 for the journey”. The invitation came when the team had not received salaries for six months and there were concerns the country would not be able to continue playing internationally. He said he was a “little wary” but undertook the trip all the same. During drinks on the last night, he was offered cocaine which the businessman and his colleagues were taking and said he “foolishly took the bait”. “The following morning, the same men stormed into my hotel room and showed me a video of me the night before doing cocaine and told me that if I did not spot fix at international matches for them, the video would be released to the public,” Taylor wrote. “I was concerned. And with six of these individuals in my hotel room, I was scared for my own safety. I’d fallen for it. I’d willingly walked into a situation that has changed my life forever. “I was handed the USD$15,000 but was told this was now a ‘deposit’ for spot match fixing and that an additional USD$20,000 would be paid once the “job” was complete. I took the money so I could get on a plane and leave India. I felt I had no choice at the time because saying no was clearly not an option. All I knew was I had to get out of there. “When I returned home, the stress of what had taken place severely impacted my mental and physical health. I was a mess. I was diagnosed with shingles and prescribed strong antipsychotic medication – maitriptyline.” It took him four months to report the offence to the ICC. “I acknowledge this was too long of a time but I thought I could protect everyone and in particular, my family,” he said.","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports"},{"title":"Cocaine in cricket’s new fix: Trapped by Indian bookies, says ex-Zimbabwe star Brendan Taylor","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/cocaine-in-crickets-new-fix-trapped-by-indian-bookies-says-ex-zimbabwe-star-brendan-taylor/","keywords":["Cricket","Sports"],"creator":["Devendra Pandey"," Abhishek Purohit"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-24 22:31:28","full_description":"BRENDAN TAYLOR, the former Zimbabwe captain, is set to become the second big name from his country after former fast bowler Heath Streak to have breached the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Anti-Corruption Code in recent times. In a statement posted on Taylor’s Twitter handle on Monday, the recently retired 35-year-old wicketkeeper-batter said the ICC is about to impose a “ multi-year ban ” on him after he delayed reporting a corrupt approach by “an Indian businessman” to the governing body for four months. The Harare-born Taylor, who had a long playing career for Zimbabwe from 2004 to 2021, said that in October 2019, he had been requested by the businessman to come to India to discuss sponsorships and the potential launch of a T20 tournament in the African country. He said he was told he would be paid US$ 15,000 for the trip. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png “The timing was such that we hadn’t been paid for 6 months by Zimbabwe cricket (the country’s cricket board) and it was questionable whether Zimbabwe would be able to continue playing in the international arena. So I made the journey,” Taylor stated. At a celebratory dinner with the businessman and his colleagues, Taylor said he was offered cocaine, and he “foolishly took the bait”. The next morning, Taylor claimed he was blackmailed by the same group of men that if he did not spot-fix during international games for them, they would make their video of him taking cocaine public.

And with 6 of these individuals in my hotel room, I was scared for my own safety. I’d fallen for it. I’d willingly walked into a situation that has changed my life forever,” he said. Taylor added that he was given the promised US$ 15,000 but was also told that it was a “deposit” for spot-fixing and that an additional US$ 20,000 would be paid once he carried out the fix. “I took the money so I could get on a plane and leave India. I felt I had no choice at the time because saying no was clearly not an option. All I knew was I had to get out of there,” he said. Taylor’s case is the latest illustrative example of what the ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit has been tracking: players from smaller international teams, where official compensation isn’t usually lucrative and can be delayed, being increasingly targeted by bookies, mainly from India. BCCI’s ACU chief, Shabbir Khandwawala, says the board is aware of Taylor’s situation, and that the “usual targets” are “such players from vulnerable countries who are not big enough or don’t have enough money”. “But the good part is that players have started to report to ACU, and they inform if anyone has approached them. In India, we have sessions where the ACU informs and educates players on how bookies will try to lure them, and make them understand each and every point. As India is cricket’s hub, we are aware of the challenges going ahead. In the past few years, the BCCI has managed to register complaints across India and that has also helped us,” Khandwawala said. According to Taylor, meanwhile, the stress triggered by the incident impacted his health so much that he was diagnosed with shingles — an infection that causes rash — and was prescribed amitriptyline, which is used to treat depression. He said he will be checking into a rehabilitation centre from Tuesday to deal with his substance abuse. Taylor said he tried to explain to the ICC that he had delayed reporting the approach as he wanted to protect his family but the governing body refused to entertain his argument. The ICC is yet to issue an official comment on the incident. Despite belatedly admitting to the approach, Taylor claimed he had never been involved in match-fixing. “I may be many things but I am not a cheat. My love for the beautiful game of cricket far outweighs and surpasses any threats which could be thrown my way,” he said. Taylor played 34 Tests, 205 ODIs and 45 T20Is for Zimbabwe until his retirement in September 2021. He was also a Kolpak player in English domestic cricket for a couple of years in between, having quit playing for Zimbabwe after their last 2015 World Cup game against India. He returned from the UK to make his Zimbabwe comeback in late 2017. In April 2021, another Zimbabwean star, Heath Streak, was banned for eight years for passing on information and introducing players to an Indian businessman, who was a known corruptor. Streak had allegedly received bitcoins valued at $70,000. Streak, as per an ICC ACU investigation, had given inside information and failed to disclose potentially corrupt approaches related to the Zimbabwe team, the Indian Premier League, the Bangladesh Premier League, the Pakistan Super League and the Afghanistan Premier League. Streak had recently told The Cricket Monthly that the Zimbabwe coaching group had agreed to forfeit their pay during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, hoping that if the team qualified for the 2019 World Cup, the ICC prize money for qualification would enable payments to be made. But Zimbabwe could not qualify. Invariably, there has been an Indian connection in most cases. In 2018, the ICC’s then ACU chief Alex Marshall had warned that “it is mostly corrupt Indian bookies” who have been approaching players. In the same year, a Zimbabwe cricket official of Indian origin was banned for allegedly offering then captain Graeme Creamer money to fix a game. Bangladesh allrounder Shakib Al Hasan is the most high-profile player to have been banned in recent times — in October 2019 — for not reporting multiple approaches from an Indian businessman. At least six players from the UAE have been banned following hearings for being in touch with bookies or accepting money but not disclosing an approach to the ICC. Three years ago, two Hong Kong players were banned for life and another received a five-year sanction for corruption. Players have also been banned for corruption in T20 leagues, with wicketkeeper-batter Umar Akmal and opener Sharjeel Khan having been sanctioned previously by the Pakistan Cricket Board for violations in the PSL.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indianexpress"},{"title":"Ashes 2022: Australia vs England cricket, Shane Wane MCG, 1999, Alec Stewart, Darren Gough, rubbish, video, highlights","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/ashes-2022-australia-vs-england-cricket-shane-wane-mcg-1999-alec-stewart-darren-gough-rubbish-video-highlights/news-story/ae4cad6ee591c0546ebcfbc2ad9f17f2","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"If there’s a moment in cricket that sums up Shane Warne’s gravitas, it was on January 15, 1999.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-24 20:00:00","full_description":"If there’s a moment in cricket that sums up Shane Warne’s gravitas, it was on January 15, 1999.

It’s been a happy crowd, just one or two idiots doing silly things in the Great Southern Stand.” Shane Warne, who was captaining Australia for the fourth time, was watching from afar. “I’m sitting in the change room, I was captain at the time, I had tracksuit pants on, I’ve got my polo shirt and I’m just eating my maccas,” Warne recalls in the Summer of Spin, delivered by McDonald’s. “Next minute, we see that Bay 13 down at the MCG throwing things at Darren Gough, and I don’t just mean throwing the odd thing, they’re throwing everything they can possibly think of and Darren Gough’s turning around and pleading with the crowd to stop throwing things.” England captain Alec Stewart (l) walks towards the MCG crowd with Shane Warne to ask spectators to stop throwing objects on to the ground. Source: News Limited What happened next was nothing short of extraordinary, as the opposition captain Stewart signalled for Warne to come out. “Alex Stewart, who is captain of England, gets together with the umpires in the middle of the MCG and they start talking,” Warne continues. “Next minute, there’s a signal to me in the dressing room. He starts rolling his arm over, like bowling leg breaks, saying, ‘Come out, come out!’ So I’m halfway through my burger and I’m going ‘no, no, he wants me out in the MCG.’ So I go, ‘OK, let’s do it,’ so I walk out. “I walk out and there’s an eruption of the crowd. They all start chanting my name. I can hardly hear Alec Stewart. He said, ‘Mate, the game’s going to stop unless you can get Bay 13 to calm down.’ “I said, ‘You can’t be serious, they’re going to eat me alive down there and start hurling things at me.’ He said, ‘Well, you’re the King of the MCG. You’ve got to go and do it.’” In typical Warne fashion, the local boy made his way down to The Great Southern Stand and asked the crowd to cut it out. Watch the CommBank Women’s Ashes Series on Kayo.

So I start signalling to them, ‘Stop, stop, throwing things’ and they all sort of have their thumbs up and I took my helmet off to show Darren Gough that it was safe to field down at third man in front of Bay 13. “I gave Mark Waugh his helmet. I start to walk off, and suddenly the game goes on, we win, the crowd don’t throw anything. It was one of those funny moments and I think we all looked back after it and had a bit of a laugh.” Shane Warne with the trophy after Australia defeated England 2-0 in the finals of the Carlton and United series.

And that was Warne’s favourite memory of a crowd throughout his cricket lifetime.

Ever since Virat Kohli has stepped down as team India’s most successful Test format captain, the Cricketing fraternity couldn’t help but flood the social media platforms with words of praises for India’s star batter. While Kohli’s decision came as a massive shocker, fans and experts of the game did make sure to remind each other as to how massive his contribution has been to Indian Cricket as skipper. Legendary Australian Cricketer Shane Warne, moreover, believes had it not been for Kohli and the BCCI, the Test format would have not been able to maintain its sanctity of being the best format, in the day and age of lucrative T20 leagues. The 52-year-old was all in awe with the way Kohli prioritized Test Cricket, in the years he led as Team India captain.

The 27-year-old Azam scored 405 runs in six games at an average of 67.50 in 2021. He was the second-highest run-scorer with 228 runs and was the Player of the Match in both of Pakistan's wins in the 2-1 series victory against South Africa. The architect of Pakistan's chase of 274 in the first ODI, Babar made a century and laid the foundation with an 82-ball 94 in the final ODI where the visitors posted 320 batting first. He was the lone warrior for Pakistan when they were swept by England 3-0. He accumulated 177 runs in three games but found no support as none of the other batters managed to score more than 100 in the series. Babar's best performance this year came in a losing cause in the final ODI against England. Walking in to bat early in the innings, Babar strung a 92-run stand with Imam-ul-Haq to bail Pakistan out of trouble. He was cautious in his approach initially, bringing up his half-century in 72 balls. He made up for it by bringing up the next fifty runs in just 32 balls – it was his second ODI century of the year. Root wins Test Cricketer of the Year: The magnitude of Root's sublime form in Test cricket in the year 2021 can be summed up by one simple stat -- he has become only the third player in history to aggregate over 1700 runs in Test cricket in a calendar year. Only Mohammad Yousuf and Sir Vivian Richards stand ahead of him. Be it Asia or conditions back at home and against a range of bowling, the England skipper ruled everywhere with some sublime innings. His knocks in Galle against Sri Lanka, and against India in both Chennai and Lord's are some of the finest witnessed in the modern era, and will be spoken of highly for a long, long time. He hasn't been shabby with the ball as well, chipping in with a handy 14 wickets, including a five-for in Ahmedabad. Root's 218 in the first Test of the four-match series against India in Chennai was a masterclass in batting. He swatted away a quality bowling attack, both pace and spin, with utter ease. This was also a sign of things to come for the remainder of the year, as the 31-year-old played knock after knock of the highest calibre, irrespective of the opposition. Ashwin was nominated in the same category along with Kyle Jamieson, and Dimuth Karunaratne. Lizelle Lee takes home women's ODI Cricketer of the Year: South Africa opener Lizelle Lee was named the ODI Cricketer of the Year for her scintillating performance which saw her finish as the highest run-scorer in 2021 in the format. The hard-hitting batter had two scores of 40 plus and played a vital role in South Africa's sweep off Pakistan. She was unstoppable on the tour of India thereafter, racking up big runs in the Proteas' 4-1 series win. With 288 runs, including a hundred and two fifties, she ended the series as the highest run-scorer and was awarded the Player of the Series. She carried her form over to the series against West Indies as well and was once again the top run-getter in the series","pubDate":"2022-01-24 17:23:06","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2022/01/24/500x300_1196715-babar-azam.jpg","source_id":"thehansindia"},{"title":"“Rohit will be the favourite to lead the side”: Shane Warne reckons Rohit Sharma is best suited to become team India’s next Test captain","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-rohit-will-be-the-favourite-to-lead-the-side-shane-warne-reckons-rohit-sharma-is-best-suited-to-become-team-indias-next-test-captain/","keywords":["Cricket","Rohit Sharma","Shane Warne","Team India"],"creator":["Gurpreet Singh"],"video_url":null,"description":"Shane Warne reckons Rohit Sharma as the front-runner to captain team India in the Test format after Virat Kohli’s resignation from the post.

Virat Kohli’s decision to quit as Team India Test captain came as as shocker for everyone. While the fans’ and experts’ quest to find the reason(s) which led to his sudden decision continue unabated, the BCCI think-tank have now found themselves in a precarious situation to yet again name an Indian captain, this time for the longest format. It would be a stern litmus test for sure considering team India’s poor performance during the recently concluded tour of South Africa. Australian legendary spinner Shane Warne, however, believes India’s current White-ball skipper Rohit Sharma can go all the way to lead the team in all the the three formats. ALSO READ: Sunil Gavaskar reckons Rishabh Pant should be made India’s next Test captain. Shane Warne reckons Rohit Sharma as the front-runner During an interaction with the news agency ANI, Shane Warne opined on team India’s next Test captain prospects. While he believes Rohit Sharma is the most suited for the job, he would have gone with Ajinkya Rahane had he been in decent enough form to earn a place in the side. “Rohit has done a good job in shorter formats, so he will be the favourite to lead the side. KL Rahul could do it, I would love to say Rahane, but he has lost form. If Rahane is in form or he finds that form again, then he can do it. He is a very good captain. India is lucky to have so many options but I think Rohit will get the captaincy,” Warne opined. The 52-year-old further stated that Rishabh Pant is ill-suited for the Test captaincy post, as he believes that a wicket-keeper can only make a good vice-captain. “I do not believe a wicketkeeper (Rishabh Pant) should be a captain, I believe a wicketkeeper makes a good deputy, a good vice-captain. Looking at the Indian side, Jasprit Bumrah can make a good captain, Rohit Sharma can make a good captain,” Warne further said. The former leg-spinner also expressed his views on Virat Kohli deciding to step down from the post. “I was not surprised with Virat’s decision because being the captain of India has so much pressure and expectation. Virat is such an inspiration to so many people, he is an inspirational leader and I am sad to see him resign as captain and step down. He is still playing Test cricket and he still believes that it is the number one form of the game,” Warne exclaimed.

A 3-0 drubbing in South Africa is surely a timely reminder that India needs to overhaul their approach to limited-overs cricket, as the team led by KL Rahul were whitewashed after their four-run loss in Cape Town on Sunday. \"It's a huge honour and it's a dream come true to represent my country and lead my country. Yes, the results didn't go our way but I think there were massive learning. We are at a stage right now where we have World Cups as the focus and we are working towards getting better as a team. I feel like we have played very good cricket over the last four or five years but it's also time for us to get better and transform our white-ball cricket,\" KL Rahul told Sports Today in an exclusive chat. 'I am confident in my leadership skills' Rahul's captaincy has been questioned by many experts with few suggesting that he may have perhaps blow his chance towards being a long-term option across formats. However, Rahul stated that he has full confidence in his leadership skills. Rahul's bowling changes didn’t work in the middle overs in the ODI series and after watching Temba Bavuma make some inspired moves like starting the attack with Aiden Markram, he introduced Ravichandran Ashwin early in one game but that was more of a reactive move rather than a pro-active one. \"I don't use that as an excuse for not winning, but I think we are a work in progress as a team. I learned so much while leading. Losses make you so much stronger than starting off with victories. My career has always been that way. I have always got everything slowly. I am confident in my leadership skills and I know that I can bring out the best from my players. I know I can do well for my country and franchise,\" Rahul added. India began the South Africa tour by winning the opening Test in Centurion before suffering five consecutive defeats across two formats.

So to touch some of the stuff that happened 30 years ago and look back, it has been pretty interesting,\" Warne added.","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews"},{"title":"Virat Kohli's biggest contribution is emphasis on Test cricket: Shane Warne","link":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohli-was-inspirational-as-leader-but-his-biggest-contribution-is-emphasis-on-test-cricket-shane-warne/articleshow/89098765.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli was an \"inspirational leader\" in his own right and without his passion for the game's traditional format, Test cricket's popularity would have dwindled in some of the other countries, legendary Shane Warne said.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-24 15:17:05","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"toi"},{"title":"R Ashwin reacts to Brendan Taylor's spot-fixing revelation: Fold and leave the table, strength to you - India Today","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vc3BvcnRzL2NyaWNrZXQvc3Rvcnkvci1hc2h3aW4tcmVhY3RzLXRvLWJyZW5kYW4tdGF5bG9yLXMtc3BvdC1maXhpbmctcmV2ZWxhdGlvbi0xOTAzOTEyLTIwMjItMDEtMjTSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"R Ashwin reacts to Brendan Taylor's spot-fixing revelation: Fold and leave the table, strength to you  India TodayCocaine, Fixing & Cricket: Ex-Zimbabwe Captain Brendan Taylor's Shocking Revelations  Republic WorldTaylor admits to not reporting spot-fixing approach | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz  CricbuzzRavichandran Ashwin Reacts to Brendan Taylor's Explosive Confession About Being Approached For Spot-Fixing  News18Brendan Taylor says he faces ICC ban for delay in reporting approach  ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-24 15:14:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Lucknow IPL team to be called Lucknow Super Giants - Times of India","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY3JpY2tldC9pcGwvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvbHVja25vdy1pcGwtdGVhbS10by1iZS1jYWxsZWQtbHVja25vdy1zdXBlci1naWFudHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODkwOTgxODguY21z0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Lucknow IPL team to be called Lucknow Super Giants  Times of IndiaIPL's Newest Contender 'Lucknow Supergiants' Set For Mega Debut | Sanjv Goenka & KL Rahul EXCLUSIVE  India TodayLucknow Super Giants unveiled as name for new IPL franchise  ESPNcricinfoIPL 2022: So Much To Learn From Gautam Gambhir - KL Rahul  Cricket Addictor'Just Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V & edit': Disappointed fans hilariously troll Lucknow IPL team after franchise reveals new name  Hindustan TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-24 14:33:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"},{"title":"Former Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor blackmailed to fix cricket matches - Daily Mail","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvc3BvcnRzbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwNDM1NDI1L0Zvcm1lci1aaW1iYWJ3ZS1jYXB0YWluLUJyZW5kYW4tVGF5bG9yLWJsYWNrbWFpbGVkLWZpeC1jcmlja2V0LW1hdGNoZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor blackmailed to fix cricket matches  Daily MailBrendan Taylor to get cricket ban over delayed reporting of spot-fixing plot  The GuardianBrendan Taylor: Former Zimbabwe batsman says he faces ICC ban for not reporting spot-fixing approach  Sky SportsHow cocaine 'bait' led to 'deposit' for spot-fixing - Brendan Taylor reveals sting that left him at rock bottom  Telegraph.co.ukBrendan Taylor: I was caught up in spot-fixing plot after blackmailers filmed me taking cocaine  The TimesView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-01-24 13:39:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"google"}]}
