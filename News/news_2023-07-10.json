Indian team and said he expected more from the opening batter. took over as the full-time captain of the Indian side in February last year after Virat Kohli's time as the skipper came to an end. While India's record in bilateral home series has been good under the opener, the team has struggled to find success in major tournaments. India bowed out in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in Australia last year and went on to lose the World Test Championship 2023 final against the Aussies last month at the Oval. Speaking at the Indian Express Idea Exchange, Gavaskar said that he expected more from Rohit as the captain and has been left disappointed with a few aspects of his reign. ‚ÄúI expected more from him (Rohit). In India it is different, but when you do well overseas that is really the test. That is where he has been a little disappointing. Even in the T20 format, with all the experience of the IPL, hundreds of matches as captain, with a mix of best IPL players not being able to get to the finals has been disappointing.‚Äù Gavaskar also wanted to know if a review of the captain and the team management was done in the aftermath of the losses of the Indian team. The legendary batter specifically pointed out to the WTC Final and said Rohit and coach should have been asked about the decisions they made during the match. ‚ÄúThey should be asking questions, ‚ÄòWhy did you field first?‚Äô Okay, it was explained at the toss that it was overcast and all. The question after that should be, ‚ÄòYou didn‚Äôt know about Travis Head‚Äôs weakness against the short ball?‚Äô Why was the bouncer employed only when he had scored 80 runs. You know, the moment Head came in to bat, in the commentary box, we had Ricky Ponting saying, ‚ÄòBounce him, bounce him.‚Äô Everyone knew about it but we didn‚Äôt try.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-07-10 04:44:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WATCH: Crowd Showers Flowers On MS Dhoni As CSK Legend Arrives In Chennai For Movie Trailer Launch","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/csk-ms-dhoni-viral-video-fans-showers-flowers-on-ms-dhoni-arrives-in-chennai-for-lsm-trailer-launch-1614805","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"Five-time Indian Premier League title winner Mahendra Singh Dhoni received a thunderous welcome from fans gathered outside the arrival gate of Chennai airport to welcome 'Thala' at his second home.

Speaking after the third Test, Hussain said it was a brilliant match, adding that Australia would be trying to work out where they lost the game. England chased down a 251-run target on Day 4 at Headingley with three wickets in hand. ‚ÄúThe third Test at Headingley was a brilliant game of cricket, and Australia will probably feel what England have felt in the past two games where they played a lot of good cricket and will try to work out where they lost it,‚Äù said Hussain. \"Mark Wood you little ripper!\" √∞¬ü¬í¬¨ Every Wood and Woakes boundary on our way to victory in Leeds! √∞¬ü¬í√• | ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) Speaking about England‚Äôs batting approach in the final innings, Hussain said both Chris Woakes and Mark Wood got their approach right when they came out ot bat on Day 4. Woakes remained unbeaten on 32, while Wood chipped in with an 8-ball 16. ‚ÄúIn that situation, Wood fending it off and trying to survive is not going to score as many runs as Wood taking them on. It's the same with Chris Woakes; I thought he got it spot on with the tempo when he went in on day four. Hanging around was not going to do it, he had to put the pressure back on the opposition and he did it perfectly,‚Äù Husain added. He went on to heap praise on Wood, saying he is loved by the Headingley crown and his teammates because of his heart. Wood picked seven wickets and scored 40 quick-fire runs across the two innings to help England win at Headingley. ‚ÄúHis stats aren't why his team-mates or why the Headingley crowd love Mark Wood, they love him because of his heart. You know when a cricketer is giving it everything. He'll get injured, he'll pick himself up and he'll go again, and that's all you can ask from a team-mate or an international cricketer,‚Äù said Hussain.

Warner had showed some fight in the Lord's Test as he scored an aggressive fifty in the first innings. However, the outing at Leeds was one to forget for the opener as he was dismissed twice by his arch-nemesis Stuart Broad. Broad has now dismissed Warner 17 times in his Test career as England won the match at Headingley by three wickets. After the match, Pat Cummins the opener's position in the side for the fourth Ashes 2023 Test at Manchester. Speaking to Sky Sports Radio, as quoted by Fox Sports, Clarke suggested that Australia have got enough options to replace Warner in the side with the former captain feeling that the likes of Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne coming into the role to open the innings. ‚ÄúTell me what they do now ... The No.1 issue is you‚Äôve stuck with Warner, given him every opportunity, and (Stuart) Broad‚Äôs still got his number. Is it time?‚Äù Clarke said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs time, I wouldn‚Äôt even be thinking about who opens the batting because you‚Äôve got options. ‚ÄúI reckon Mitch Marsh is in form. If he had to do it, he could do it. Alex Carey probably won‚Äôt because he‚Äôs got to keep, but Travis Head could do it. Marnus Labuschagne isn‚Äôt making as many runs as he should at No.3. He could open, Smithy could go to No.3 and Head to No.4 (with Marsh and Green No.5 and No.6).‚Äù Clarke said that the only thing selectors would need to think about is if Warner's time up in the side. The former Australian captain said that they should either persist with Warner or play with the batting order to keep Marsh in the side. ‚ÄúThe thing you‚Äôve got to think about first is, is David Warner‚Äôs time up? And the other thing, if you‚Äôre going to bring Cameron Green back in, is he 100 per cent fit to bowl the overs he needs to bowl?\" ‚ÄúI think they should either stick with Warner or play with the batting order and keep Mitch Marsh.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-07-10 03:54:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Never Imagined The Journey Would...': Virat Kohli Shares Heartwarming Post With Rahul Dravid Ahead Of IND vs WI Dominica Test","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-1st-test-virat-kohli-shares-heartwarming-post-with-rahul-dravid-ahead-of-ind-vs-wi-dominica-test-1614790","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies Dominica Test: The Indian cricket team will kickstart the India tour of West Indies with the IND vs WI 1st Test from July 12 onwards at Windsor Park, Roseau, Dominica.

The Kiwis were comfortable 41-12 winners over Los Pumas in Mendoza on Sunday morning, with the real drama coming after fulltime. Security staff were overwhelmed as a number of pitch invaders took to the field, coming dangerously close to players. Cane took action when one of the invaders came within a metre of All Blacks players, kicking the man and knocking him to the ground. It invoked memories of Andy Symonds shoulder charging a pitch invader in a cricket match, Sam Kerr shouldering a streaker to the ground in the UK and Johnny Bairstow removing a protestor from the field during The Ashes in another example of athlete's taking things into their own hands. Sam Cane has apologised via social media for kicking a pitch invader following this morning¬øs test against Argentina Goes without saying, but this is not a good look for the All Blacks captain pic.twitter.com/M6baJk518A ‚Äî Andrew Gourdie (@AndrewGourdie) July 9, 2023 New Zealand skipper Sam Cane kicked out at a pitch invader who came too close to the players after their win over Argentina in the Rugby Championship Cane has apologised for his actions on social media but could still face sanction from New Zealand Rugby Cane, 31, has an otherwise exemplary discipline record and is yet to receive a red card in 87 tests for the All Blacks or 150 matches for the Chiefs in Super Rugby level. He took to social media to apologise for the incident and it remains to be seen whether he will face further sanction from NZ Rugby. 'After the game someone ran onto the pitch and I made an error in judgment and played a part in stopping him,' Cane posted. 'I acknowledge this was not my role and it is out of character of me to act in such a way. I am really sorry and am disappointed in myself. 'I am trying my best to contact the individual to apologise and make things right.' He then later added: 'Through the help of many good people, I managed to track down Roman. 'Had a good catch up with him and his friends and I'm glad that we could leave things in a good place.' Footage showed Cane stepping away from the playing group to lash out at the pitch invader who was one of many that stormed the field after the match A pocket of rugby fans strangely leapt to the defence of the pitch invade and called for punishment to be handed down to the Kiwi captain. 'He should be banned for this,' one posted. 'The @AllBlacks coaches have surely got to be questioning what his decision making would be like in the heat of the game,' added another. 'Tripping is sending off infraction. Kane is useless anyway. He won't be missed,' posted another. But most supporters are in favour of Cane's actions, with some saying the pitch invader got off lightly. 'Goes without saying' jog on mate, pitch invaders need to be sorted out. Shame he didn't smash him harder. As soon as a pitch invader goes on the field, they can't complain if they get smashed,' one fan replied to the video of the incident. 'The only thing he should be apologising for is not going in for the coat-hanger,' added another. Cane, pictured with wife Harriet Allen, has an exemplary record and has never received a red card at Super Rugby or international level Cane was influential once again for the All Blacks on the field as New Zealand claimed a comfortable win over Argentina 'Bro players have tackled pitch invaders before why shouldn't he do that that person should know better,' posted another. Newstalk ZB's rugby editor Elliott Smith was at the ground and said there were at least 15 pitch invaders on the ground at the time and the Kiwi skipper had every right to protect himself. 'I have no real issue with what Sam Cane has done here. The pitch invaders were coming from left, right and centre from fulltime - I suspect there would have been 15 or so at least. One nearly took out Damian McKenzie and I as we were speaking for Sky,' Smith said on Twitter. Former All Black Israel Dagg also backed the actions of Cane. 'I would have done the same tbh .. maybe a lazy no arm shoulder!! Stay off the field,' he tweeted.

While India's record in bilateral home series has been good under the opener, the team has struggled to find success in major tournaments. India bowed out in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in Australia last year and went on to lose the World Test Championship 2023 final against the Aussies last month at the Oval. Speaking at the Indian Express Idea Exchange, Gavaskar said that he expected more from Rohit as the captain and has been left disappointed with a few aspects of his reign. ‚ÄúI expected more from him (Rohit). In India it is different, but when you do well overseas that is really the test. That is where he has been a little disappointing. Even in the T20 format, with all the experience of the IPL, hundreds of matches as captain, with a mix of best IPL players not being able to get to the finals has been disappointing.‚Äù Gavaskar also wanted to know if a review of the captain and the team management was done in the aftermath of the losses of the Indian team. The legendary batter specifically pointed out to the WTC Final and said Rohit and coach should have been asked about the decisions they made during the match. ‚ÄúThey should be asking questions, ‚ÄòWhy did you field first?‚Äô Okay, it was explained at the toss that it was overcast and all. The question after that should be, ‚ÄòYou didn‚Äôt know about Travis Head‚Äôs weakness against the short ball?‚Äô Why was the bouncer employed only when he had scored 80 runs.

Speaking after the third Test, Hussain said it was a brilliant match, adding that Australia would be trying to work out where they lost the game. England chased down a 251-run target on Day 4 at Headingley with three wickets in hand. ‚ÄúThe third Test at Headingley was a brilliant game of cricket, and Australia will probably feel what England have felt in the past two games where they played a lot of good cricket and will try to work out where they lost it,‚Äù said Hussain. \"Mark Wood you little ripper!\" √∞¬ü¬í¬¨ Every Wood and Woakes boundary on our way to victory in Leeds! √∞¬ü¬í√• | ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) Speaking about England‚Äôs batting approach in the final innings, Hussain said both Chris Woakes and Mark Wood got their approach right when they came out ot bat on Day 4. Woakes remained unbeaten on 32, while Wood chipped in with an 8-ball 16. ‚ÄúIn that situation, Wood fending it off and trying to survive is not going to score as many runs as Wood taking them on. It's the same with Chris Woakes; I thought he got it spot on with the tempo when he went in on day four. Hanging around was not going to do it, he had to put the pressure back on the opposition and he did it perfectly,‚Äù Husain added. He went on to heap praise on Wood, saying he is loved by the Headingley crown and his teammates because of his heart. Wood picked seven wickets and scored 40 quick-fire runs across the two innings to help England win at Headingley. ‚ÄúHis stats aren't why his team-mates or why the Headingley crowd love Mark Wood, they love him because of his heart. You know when a cricketer is giving it everything. He'll get injured, he'll pick himself up and he'll go again, and that's all you can ask from a team-mate or an international cricketer,‚Äù said Hussain. With this victory, England now trail Australia 1-2 in the five-match Ashes 2023 series, with the fourth game set to be played at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground on July 19.","pubDate":"2023-07-10

News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sunil Gavaskar On Rohit Sharma Captaincy: Team India's all-format captain Rohit Sharma faced tons of criticism after India's humiliating loss against Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final. After Virat Kohli's exit as India captain, Rohit was assigned as the new team leader in all three formats. Everyone expected the senior opener to end India's ICC trophy drought, but Rohit has not been able to do that so far and the upcoming ODI World Cup 2023, in all likelihood, will be his last assignment as India captain. ALSO WATCH | Virat Kohli Hailed As 'Biggest Name In Team India' By Fan In Dominica Ahead Of IND vs WI 1st Test Meanwhile, former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar stated his disappointment with Rohit Sharma and gave a scathing analysis of the senior opener's captaincy tenure. Gavaskar said that despite having some quality players and a lot of experience in T20, it was highly disappointing to not see the Indian team reach the final of the T20 World Cup 2023. Rohit-led India suffered an embarrassing 10-wicket loss against England in the semi-final. \"I expected more from him (Rohit). In India it is different, but when you do well overseas that is really the test. That is where he has been a little disappointing. Even in the T20 format, with all the experience of the IPL, hundreds of matches as captain, with a mix of best IPL players not being able to get to the finals has been disappointing,\" said Gavaskar to the Indian Express Idea Exchange.

After Virat Kohli's exit as India captain, Rohit was assigned as the new team leader in all three formats. Everyone expected the senior opener to end India's ICC trophy drought, but Rohit has not been able to do that so far and the upcoming ODI World Cup 2023 , in all likelihood, will be his last assignment as India captain. ALSO WATCH | Virat Kohli Hailed As 'Biggest Name In Team India' By Fan In Dominica Ahead Of IND vs WI 1st Test Meanwhile, former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar stated his disappointment with Rohit Sharma and gave a scathing analysis of the senior opener's captaincy tenure. Gavaskar said that despite having some quality players and a lot of experience in T20, it was highly disappointing to not see the Indian team reach the final of the T20 World Cup 2023. Rohit-led India suffered an embarrassing 10-wicket loss against England in the semi-final. \"I expected more from him (Rohit). In India it is different, but when you do well overseas that is really the test. That is where he has been a little disappointing. Even in the T20 format, with all the experience of the IPL, hundreds of matches as captain, with a mix of best IPL players not being able to get to the finals has been disappointing,\" said Gavaskar to the Indian Express Idea Exchange. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-6601185-5\"); }); Gavaskar called upon the BCCI and selectors to ask tough questions to Rohit and Rahul Dravid. \"They should be asking questions, Why did you field first?

Warner had showed some fight in the Lord's Test as he scored an aggressive fifty in the first innings. However, the outing at Leeds was one to forget for the opener as he was dismissed twice by his arch-nemesis Stuart Broad. Broad has now dismissed Warner 17 times in his Test career as England won the match at Headingley by three wickets. After the match, Pat Cummins the opener's position in the side for the fourth Ashes 2023 Test at Manchester. Speaking to Sky Sports Radio, as quoted by Fox Sports, Clarke suggested that Australia have got enough options to replace Warner in the side with the former captain feeling that the likes of Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne coming into the role to open the innings. ‚ÄúTell me what they do now ... The No.1 issue is you‚Äôve stuck with Warner, given him every opportunity, and (Stuart) Broad‚Äôs still got his number. Is it time?‚Äù Clarke said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs time, I wouldn‚Äôt even be thinking about who opens the batting because you‚Äôve got options. ‚ÄúI reckon Mitch Marsh is in form. If he had to do it, he could do it. Alex Carey probably won‚Äôt because he‚Äôs got to keep, but Travis Head could do it. Marnus Labuschagne isn‚Äôt making as many runs as he should at No.3. He could open, Smithy could go to No.3 and Head to No.4 (with Marsh and Green No.5 and No.6).‚Äù Clarke said that the only thing selectors would need to think about is if Warner's time up in the side. The former Australian captain said that they should either persist with Warner or play with the batting order to keep Marsh in the side. ‚ÄúThe thing you‚Äôve got to think about first is, is David Warner‚Äôs time up? And the other thing, if you‚Äôre going to bring Cameron Green back in, is he 100 per cent fit to bowl the overs he needs to bowl?\" ‚ÄúI think they should either stick with Warner or play with the batting order and keep Mitch Marsh.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-07-10 03:54:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Never Imagined The Journey Would...': Virat Kohli Shares Heartwarming Post With Rahul Dravid Ahead Of IND vs WI Dominica Test","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-1st-test-virat-kohli-shares-heartwarming-post-with-rahul-dravid-ahead-of-ind-vs-wi-dominica-test-1614790","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies Dominica Test: The Indian cricket team will kickstart the India tour of West Indies with the IND vs WI 1st Test from July 12 onwards at Windsor Park, Roseau, Dominica.

The Kiwis were comfortable 41-12 winners over Los Pumas in Mendoza on Sunday morning, with the real drama coming after fulltime. Security staff were overwhelmed as a number of pitch invaders took to the field, coming dangerously close to players. Cane took action when one of the invaders came within a metre of All Blacks players, kicking the man and knocking him to the ground. It invoked memories of Andy Symonds shoulder charging a pitch invader in a cricket match, Sam Kerr shouldering a streaker to the ground in the UK and Johnny Bairstow removing a protestor from the field during The Ashes in another example of athlete's taking things into their own hands. Sam Cane has apologised via social media for kicking a pitch invader following this morning¬øs test against Argentina Goes without saying, but this is not a good look for the All Blacks captain pic.twitter.com/M6baJk518A ‚Äî Andrew Gourdie (@AndrewGourdie) July 9, 2023 New Zealand skipper Sam Cane kicked out at a pitch invader who came too close to the players after their win over Argentina in the Rugby Championship Cane has apologised for his actions on social media but could still face sanction from New Zealand Rugby Cane, 31, has an otherwise exemplary discipline record and is yet to receive a red card in 87 tests for the All Blacks or 150 matches for the Chiefs in Super Rugby level. He took to social media to apologise for the incident and it remains to be seen whether he will face further sanction from NZ Rugby. 'After the game someone ran onto the pitch and I made an error in judgment and played a part in stopping him,' Cane posted. 'I acknowledge this was not my role and it is out of character of me to act in such a way. I am really sorry and am disappointed in myself. 'I am trying my best to contact the individual to apologise and make things right.' He then later added: 'Through the help of many good people, I managed to track down Roman. 'Had a good catch up with him and his friends and I'm glad that we could leave things in a good place.' Footage showed Cane stepping away from the playing group to lash out at the pitch invader who was one of many that stormed the field after the match A pocket of rugby fans strangely leapt to the defence of the pitch invade and called for punishment to be handed down to the Kiwi captain. 'He should be banned for this,' one posted. 'The @AllBlacks coaches have surely got to be questioning what his decision making would be like in the heat of the game,' added another. 'Tripping is sending off infraction. Kane is useless anyway. He won't be missed,' posted another. But most supporters are in favour of Cane's actions, with some saying the pitch invader got off lightly. 'Goes without saying' jog on mate, pitch invaders need to be sorted out. Shame he didn't smash him harder. As soon as a pitch invader goes on the field, they can't complain if they get smashed,' one fan replied to the video of the incident. 'The only thing he should be apologising for is not going in for the coat-hanger,' added another. Cane, pictured with wife Harriet Allen, has an exemplary record and has never received a red card at Super Rugby or international level Cane was influential once again for the All Blacks on the field as New Zealand claimed a comfortable win over Argentina 'Bro players have tackled pitch invaders before why shouldn't he do that that person should know better,' posted another. Newstalk ZB's rugby editor Elliott Smith was at the ground and said there were at least 15 pitch invaders on the ground at the time and the Kiwi skipper had every right to protect himself. 'I have no real issue with what Sam Cane has done here. The pitch invaders were coming from left, right and centre from fulltime - I suspect there would have been 15 or so at least. One nearly took out Damian McKenzie and I as we were speaking for Sky,' Smith said on Twitter. Former All Black Israel Dagg also backed the actions of Cane. 'I would have done the same tbh .. maybe a lazy no arm shoulder!! Stay off the field,' he tweeted.

Indian team and said he expected more from the opening batter. took over as the full-time captain of the Indian side in February last year after Virat Kohli's time as the skipper came to an end. While India's record in bilateral home series has been good under the opener, the team has struggled to find success in major tournaments. India bowed out in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in Australia last year and went on to lose the World Test Championship 2023 final against the Aussies last month at the Oval. Speaking at the Indian Express Idea Exchange, Gavaskar said that he expected more from Rohit as the captain and has been left disappointed with a few aspects of his reign. ‚ÄúI expected more from him (Rohit). In India it is different, but when you do well overseas that is really the test. That is where he has been a little disappointing. Even in the T20 format, with all the experience of the IPL, hundreds of matches as captain, with a mix of best IPL players not being able to get to the finals has been disappointing.‚Äù Gavaskar also wanted to know if a review of the captain and the team management was done in the aftermath of the losses of the Indian team. The legendary batter specifically pointed out to the WTC Final and said Rohit and coach should have been asked about the decisions they made during the match. ‚ÄúThey should be asking questions, ‚ÄòWhy did you field first?‚Äô Okay, it was explained at the toss that it was overcast and all. The question after that should be, ‚ÄòYou didn‚Äôt know about Travis Head‚Äôs weakness against the short ball?‚Äô Why was the bouncer employed only when he had scored 80 runs. You know, the moment Head came in to bat, in the commentary box, we had Ricky Ponting saying, ‚ÄòBounce him, bounce him.‚Äô Everyone knew about it but we didn‚Äôt try.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-07-10 04:44:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WATCH: Crowd Showers Flowers On MS Dhoni As CSK Legend Arrives In Chennai For Movie Trailer Launch","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/csk-ms-dhoni-viral-video-fans-showers-flowers-on-ms-dhoni-arrives-in-chennai-for-lsm-trailer-launch-1614805","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"Five-time Indian Premier League title winner Mahendra Singh Dhoni received a thunderous welcome from fans gathered outside the arrival gate of Chennai airport to welcome 'Thala' at his second home.

Speaking after the third Test, Hussain said it was a brilliant match, adding that Australia would be trying to work out where they lost the game. England chased down a 251-run target on Day 4 at Headingley with three wickets in hand. ‚ÄúThe third Test at Headingley was a brilliant game of cricket, and Australia will probably feel what England have felt in the past two games where they played a lot of good cricket and will try to work out where they lost it,‚Äù said Hussain. \"Mark Wood you little ripper!\" √∞¬ü¬í¬¨ Every Wood and Woakes boundary on our way to victory in Leeds! √∞¬ü¬í√• | ‚Äî England Cricket (@englandcricket) Speaking about England‚Äôs batting approach in the final innings, Hussain said both Chris Woakes and Mark Wood got their approach right when they came out ot bat on Day 4. Woakes remained unbeaten on 32, while Wood chipped in with an 8-ball 16. ‚ÄúIn that situation, Wood fending it off and trying to survive is not going to score as many runs as Wood taking them on. It's the same with Chris Woakes; I thought he got it spot on with the tempo when he went in on day four. Hanging around was not going to do it, he had to put the pressure back on the opposition and he did it perfectly,‚Äù Husain added. He went on to heap praise on Wood, saying he is loved by the Headingley crown and his teammates because of his heart. Wood picked seven wickets and scored 40 quick-fire runs across the two innings to help England win at Headingley. ‚ÄúHis stats aren't why his team-mates or why the Headingley crowd love Mark Wood, they love him because of his heart. You know when a cricketer is giving it everything. He'll get injured, he'll pick himself up and he'll go again, and that's all you can ask from a team-mate or an international cricketer,‚Äù said Hussain. With this victory, England now trail Australia 1-2 in the five-match Ashes 2023 series, with the fourth game set to be played at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground on July 19.","pubDate":"2023-07-10

Warner had showed some fight in the Lord's Test as he scored an aggressive fifty in the first innings. However, the outing at Leeds was one to forget for the opener as he was dismissed twice by his arch-nemesis Stuart Broad. Broad has now dismissed Warner 17 times in his Test career as England won the match at Headingley by three wickets. After the match, Pat Cummins the opener's position in the side for the fourth Ashes 2023 Test at Manchester. Speaking to Sky Sports Radio, as quoted by Fox Sports, Clarke suggested that Australia have got enough options to replace Warner in the side with the former captain feeling that the likes of Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne coming into the role to open the innings. ‚ÄúTell me what they do now ... The No.1 issue is you‚Äôve stuck with Warner, given him every opportunity, and (Stuart) Broad‚Äôs still got his number. Is it time?‚Äù Clarke said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs time, I wouldn‚Äôt even be thinking about who opens the batting because you‚Äôve got options. ‚ÄúI reckon Mitch Marsh is in form. If he had to do it, he could do it. Alex Carey probably won‚Äôt because he‚Äôs got to keep, but Travis Head could do it. Marnus Labuschagne isn‚Äôt making as many runs as he should at No.3. He could open, Smithy could go to No.3 and Head to No.4 (with Marsh and Green No.5 and No.6).‚Äù Clarke said that the only thing selectors would need to think about is if Warner's time up in the side. The former Australian captain said that they should either persist with Warner or play with the batting order to keep Marsh in the side. ‚ÄúThe thing you‚Äôve got to think about first is, is David Warner‚Äôs time up? And the other thing, if you‚Äôre going to bring Cameron Green back in, is he 100 per cent fit to bowl the overs he needs to bowl?\" ‚ÄúI think they should either stick with Warner or play with the batting order and keep Mitch Marsh.‚Äù","pubDate":"2023-07-10 03:54:13","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"english"},{"title":"'Never Imagined The Journey Would...': Virat Kohli Shares Heartwarming Post With Rahul Dravid Ahead Of IND vs WI Dominica Test","link":"https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies-1st-test-virat-kohli-shares-heartwarming-post-with-rahul-dravid-ahead-of-ind-vs-wi-dominica-test-1614790","keywords":["Cricket"],"creator":["ABP News Bureau"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies Dominica Test: The Indian cricket team will kickstart the India tour of West Indies with the IND vs WI 1st Test from July 12 onwards at Windsor Park, Roseau, Dominica.

The Kiwis were comfortable 41-12 winners over Los Pumas in Mendoza on Sunday morning, with the real drama coming after fulltime. Security staff were overwhelmed as a number of pitch invaders took to the field, coming dangerously close to players. Cane took action when one of the invaders came within a metre of All Blacks players, kicking the man and knocking him to the ground. It invoked memories of Andy Symonds shoulder charging a pitch invader in a cricket match, Sam Kerr shouldering a streaker to the ground in the UK and Johnny Bairstow removing a protestor from the field during The Ashes in another example of athlete's taking things into their own hands. Sam Cane has apologised via social media for kicking a pitch invader following this morning¬øs test against Argentina Goes without saying, but this is not a good look for the All Blacks captain pic.twitter.com/M6baJk518A ‚Äî Andrew Gourdie (@AndrewGourdie) July 9, 2023 New Zealand skipper Sam Cane kicked out at a pitch invader who came too close to the players after their win over Argentina in the Rugby Championship Cane has apologised for his actions on social media but could still face sanction from New Zealand Rugby Cane, 31, has an otherwise exemplary discipline record and is yet to receive a red card in 87 tests for the All Blacks or 150 matches for the Chiefs in Super Rugby level. He took to social media to apologise for the incident and it remains to be seen whether he will face further sanction from NZ Rugby. 'After the game someone ran onto the pitch and I made an error in judgment and played a part in stopping him,' Cane posted. 'I acknowledge this was not my role and it is out of character of me to act in such a way. I am really sorry and am disappointed in myself. 'I am trying my best to contact the individual to apologise and make things right.' He then later added: 'Through the help of many good people, I managed to track down Roman. 'Had a good catch up with him and his friends and I'm glad that we could leave things in a good place.' Footage showed Cane stepping away from the playing group to lash out at the pitch invader who was one of many that stormed the field after the match A pocket of rugby fans strangely leapt to the defence of the pitch invade and called for punishment to be handed down to the Kiwi captain. 'He should be banned for this,' one posted. 'The @AllBlacks coaches have surely got to be questioning what his decision making would be like in the heat of the game,' added another. 'Tripping is sending off infraction. Kane is useless anyway. He won't be missed,' posted another. But most supporters are in favour of Cane's actions, with some saying the pitch invader got off lightly. 'Goes without saying' jog on mate, pitch invaders need to be sorted out. Shame he didn't smash him harder. As soon as a pitch invader goes on the field, they can't complain if they get smashed,' one fan replied to the video of the incident. 'The only thing he should be apologising for is not going in for the coat-hanger,' added another. Cane, pictured with wife Harriet Allen, has an exemplary record and has never received a red card at Super Rugby or international level Cane was influential once again for the All Blacks on the field as New Zealand claimed a comfortable win over Argentina 'Bro players have tackled pitch invaders before why shouldn't he do that that person should know better,' posted another. Newstalk ZB's rugby editor Elliott Smith was at the ground and said there were at least 15 pitch invaders on the ground at the time and the Kiwi skipper had every right to protect himself. 'I have no real issue with what Sam Cane has done here. The pitch invaders were coming from left, right and centre from fulltime - I suspect there would have been 15 or so at least. One nearly took out Damian McKenzie and I as we were speaking for Sky,' Smith said on Twitter. Former All Black Israel Dagg also backed the actions of Cane. 'I would have done the same tbh .. maybe a lazy no arm shoulder!! Stay off the field,' he tweeted.
