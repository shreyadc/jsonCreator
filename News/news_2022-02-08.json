Legendary Australian spinner Shane Warne has joined the likes of his former teammates in Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden in finding faults with Cricket Australia regarding their treatment of former head coach Justin Langer. Langer’s resignation as Australia head coach has drawn a significant and severe amount of criticism for CA citing their ill-treatment of someone whose last two assignments as a head coach were coaching his team to a maiden ICC T20 World Cup victory and Ashes 2021-22. Langer, 51, became a victim of the growing say of players in a sporting environment. Langer, whose coaching style hadn’t been endorsed by some players, was offered just a six-month contract extension following which he decided to step down. “To treat the head coach the way they have, it’s an absolute disgrace what they’ve done. All of us who have played with Justin [Langer], we are not coming out because he’s our friend or a great cricketer or a Hall of Famer. We are coming out because it’s the treatment of the coach,” Warne said on the Follow-On podcast. Here is to you my old mate JL #respect #honour #code #loyalty #cricket #justinlanger pic.twitter.com/X2VFYUajJK — Damien Martyn (@damienmartyn) February 5, 2022 “Forget it’s Justin Langer. It’s just the treatment of Cricket Australia and the way they have handled the coach of the Australian cricket team. It’s been pathetic.” Shane Warne lauds Justin Langer for his intensity Readers must note that Langer was roped in as a head coach in the aftermath of Cape Town Ball Tampering Scandal 2018. There is no going into a safe house regarding the fact that Langer had successfully turned the tables with respect to both Australian cricket team’s reputation and on-field performances across formats. Having said that, it was his intense “taskmaster” coaching style which perhaps was too much to handle for modern-day cricketers. “We were finally starting to see the integrity coming back to the Australian cricket. It’s not a great Australian cricket team we are talking about here. But all that Justin Langer put in over three or four years, we are just starting to see the rewards for his hard work. His brutalness, his intensity and his kick up the backside to the players. You know why? They needed it,” Warne said. Warne, who is not known for mincing words, didn’t shy away from calling the current Australian team “not great”. Going forward, Warne expects Australia to “perform” in order to maintain the current winning momentum. “If they can start doing this for another five or six years. Not to lose at home, beat India away and beat England away. Then we might start talking about this great Australian cricket team. But they aren’t at the moment. If they didn’t like his style and he had lost the dressing room, well, they better start performing. They have to perform,” Warne added. It is noteworthy that Australia’s next international assignment is an all-format tour of Pakistan scheduled to be played between March 4 – April 5.

It will be held by the winner of Test cricket series between Australia and the West Indies. The trophy, inaugurated to commemorate the historic tie in the first Test in Brisbane, will be known as the “Frank Worrell Trophy “. West Indian captain Frank Worrell (right) uses his sleeve to put a final polish on the Frank Worrell Trophy, before he presented it to Australian captain Richie Brand. Credit: The Age Archives The trophy was announced last night, at a special dinner given to the West Indies cricketers, and the 12 members of the Australian team which played in the Brisbane Test. At the end of the final day’s play in the fifth Test, the trophy will be given into the custody of the winning side in a brief ceremony on the players’ balcony at the M.C.G. The trophy is 12 inches high and includes one of the balls used in the tied Brisbane Test. The ball is mounted on three silver stumps set in a trophy base and carries- a silver plate with engravings of a kangaroo and a palm tree. First published in The Age on February 16, 1961 Australia Wins Test Series AUSTRALIA won the fifth Test and the series against the West Indies at 5.10 p.m. yesterday at the M.C.G., after a day of stern, defensive play by both teams, and a hotly disputed umpiring decision. The winning runs – produced astonishing crowd scenes as thousands rushed the wicket, the players, and the umpires. Ten thousand people crowded around the players’ balcony for more than an hour after stumps to watch the presentation of the Frank Worrell Trophy and to emotionally farewell Frank Worrell himself after his last Test match. Worrell was clearly affected by the cheers of the mass of people who spilled across the concourse in front of the Grey Smith grandstand and far out on to the arena. Australia’s two wicket victory yesterday will keep the Frank Worrell Trophy in Australia until the next series against the West Indies is played. At the presentation ceremony, Sir Donald Bradman handed over the Frank Worrell Trophy to Worrell, who presented it to Benaud. Worrell was received with cheers and the crowd spontaneously sang “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow.” He also presented Benaud with a West Indies cap, tie and blazer… “my scalp, my neck, and the upper part of my body.” He said he and his team had enjoyed their Australian tour although they were not taking home the trophy. “However, I know what it looks like, and I know what it feels like, and I will have it in mind while we look forward to the Australians coming to the West Indies,” he said. Richie Benaud said he was sad that such a magnificent Test series had finished and that Frank Worrell had played his last Test in Australia. “Frank Worrell will live in the hearts of Australian cricket lovers for his part in a memorable and really enjoyable series,” Benaud said. Sir Donald Bradman said Worrell and Benaud and their teams had produced a revival in cricket. “Frank Worrell has been – and still is – not only a fine cricketer, but a great sportsman and a very gallant loser,” he said. Yesterday’s fifth Test victory gave Australia the rubber by the narrow margin of two wins to one, with one game drawn and one a tie. In no previous series has a team, other than England, come as close to taking a rubber from Australia.","image_url":null,"source_id":"theage","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa claim another title, win National U-16 Cup","link":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/931701-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-claim-another-title-win-national-u-16-cup","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE: Riazullah Khan helped Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Whites beat Southern Punjab Blues by 106 runs to clinch the National U16 Cup.Grabbing the Under 16 cricket title, the KP teams - seniors, Under13 and Under16 - made history by winning all three senior and junior titles.

The Western Australian walked away from the top job on the weekend after being offered just a six-month contract extension despite winning the T20 World Cup and retaining the Ashes in a 4-0 hammering of England.

NEW FOX CRICKET PODCAST - Shane Warne: ‘What is Cricket Australia doing!?’ Listen below or subscribe in iTunes or Spotify On Monday, Langer joined Hockley to explain his reasons for walking away. According the Sydney Morning Herald it mirrored his resignation letter in which he apologised if his “intense” nature had upset players but insisted he was proud of what he had achieved after taking over following the Sandpaper scandal. The Australian reports Langer was emotional during the call with his camera switching off at one point. Hockley, meanwhile, revealed he will reach out to past players in a bid to stop a civil war from tearing the game apart.

Appearing exclusively on Fox Cricket’s Follow On Podcast , Warne labelled it a “disgrace”. “To treat the head coach the way they have, it’s an absolute disgrace what they’ve done,” Warne said. “All of us who have played with Justin, we are not coming out because he’s our friend or a great cricketer or a Hall of Famer. We are coming out because it’s the treatment of the coach. “Forget it’s Justin Langer. It’s just the treatment of Cricket Australia and the way they have handled the coach of the Australian cricket team. It’s been pathetic.” Gilchrist, in an interview with SEN, said Langer had been “painted as a monster”. “He’ll be the first to admit he has his frailties, he has his areas of weakness, but he’ll sit and look you in the eye and work it out with you.“So, to be painted as a monster, what sort of effect would that have on you personally and what’s the flow-on effect to your family ... particularly through a period of time when you’re not nearly understanding what is going on, the consistent innuendo and rumour.” Hussey: CA's offer was 'disrespectful' | 01:58 Hockley said he understood why Langer’s former teammates would support him. “People obviously have very strong views and opinions. Absolutely, I certainly will be reaching out to some of the legends of the game who are also JL’s former teammates and very close mates,” Hockley told News Corp. “I certainly want to sit down and contact them and explain our plans for the future – the coaching set-up and the structure as it evolves so that everyone has a really clear understanding of that. “There’s a fair bit of emotion at the moment but it’s certainly my intention to reach out and speak to them and it’s something I and others in the team will continue to do as a matter of course, because I think they’ve got really, really valuable opinions.”","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Lingering question debunked amid Langer firestorm","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/justin-langer-resignation-pat-cummins-steve-smith-todd-greenberg/bbe4b7ef-c40c-4605-ad49-33ac5ea1f312","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Australian Cricketers' Association boss has slammed claims of player power following the exit of Justin Langer.","content":"The Australian Cricketers' Association boss has denied players forced Justin Langer out of his job and claimed they thought \"fondly\" of him as the national men's coach.ACA chief executive Todd Greenberg also reasoned that the players had \"handled themselves very well throughout the situation\" and argued there was \"no one with a higher level of integrity\" than Test captain Pat Cummins.Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne and Mitchell Johnson are among the Australian cricket greats to have lashed the influence of players in the demise of Langer.LIVE UPDATES: Testing farce rocks Olympics ice hockeyREAD MORE: Chinese censors intervene after Olympic fiascoREAD MORE: IOC president's Peng Shuai revelation raises fresh questionsREAD MORE: Slater makes first big call on Maroons staffGreenberg has struck back in the wake of the exit of Langer, who resigned after being offered only a six-month contract extension and being told that the deal wouldn't be renewed again.\"I've heard a few comments about player power.

The test legend on Monday labelled the governing body’s treatment of Just Langer an “absolute disgrace” following the former coach’s resignation on Saturday. Warne’s scathing public comments comes on the same day Aussie great Adam Gilchrist also attacked Cricket Australia (CA). Gilchrist, one of Langer’ closest friends, said he remained “staggered” at how the process played out with next to no real explanation why Langer was offered just a six-month token contract extension despite having just won the T20 World Cup and the Ashes. The divide between the current dressing room and Aussie test legends is continuing to widen after captain Pat Cummins was slammed by his former teammate Mitchell Johnson, who called the current skipper “gutless” for failing to fully back Langer. Watch The Dettol T20 Series Australia vs Sri Lanka. Every Game Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Warne has now joined the scuffle with a series of explosive comments on cricket officials and players. “To treat the head coach the way they have, it’s an absolute disgrace what they’ve done,” Warne said on Fox Sports’ Follow-On podcast . “All of us who have played with Justin, we are not coming out because he’s our friend or a great cricketer or a Hall of Famer. We are coming out because it’s the treatment of the coach. “Forget it’s Justin Langer. It’s just the treatment of Cricket Australia and the way they have handled the coach of the Australian cricket team. It’s been pathetic.” Warne said the team has not earned the right to dictate who should manage them and said the team has not produced enough winning results to cut Langer adrift. “It’s not a great Australian cricket team we are talking about here,” he said. “But all that Justin Langer put in over three or four years, we are just starting to see the rewards for his hard work. His brutalness, his intensity and his kick up the backside to the players. You know why? They needed it.” Meanwhile, Warne has addressed ongoing rumours surrounding the Aussie team and cricket officials — and the ongoing fall out to the infamous Cape Town sandpaper scandal. Warne said it is an ugly look that Cricket Australia continues to be accused of covering up details of the scandal that besmirched the sport, having also been accused of covering up some details before former captain Tim Paine’s shock resignation last year. “We still don’t know the truth about what actually happened at Sandpapergate,” he said. “Does Cricket Australia know the truth? Do they? Do the same people know the truth about Sandpapergate? Are they hiding anything? “We’ve seen that the bowling cartel, as they call themselves, or ‘Winx’ and ‘GOAT’ and all these unbelievable nicknames they have for themselves. These guys wrote a letter saying they had no knowledge of whatever went on. “That might be correct. But if it’s not and they’ve done that, there are all sorts of whispers or rumours that we all have heard. And one day the truth will come out.” Cummins was earlier urged to give the Australian public a “clear opinion” on his role in Langer’s demise. Former Test captain Michael Clarke said Cummins had been put in a “lose-lose” situation by CA amid talk of player power being behind Langer’s ousting, which has earned huge amounts of vitriol from some of the biggest names in the game. “The Australian public aren’t stupid and this is my point with Pat Cummins,” Clarke said on Monday. “His reputation is squeaky-clean. Right now it has taken a hit, until he stands there and voices his opinion. Look what Mitchell Johnson said about Pat Cummins. A teammate, a friend of his has smoked him. “My advice to Patty is he has got to stand there. He needs to tell the fans where he sits on this because everyone thinks it is Patty who made the decision. That accountability sits with him. “He is trying to honour both parties and has done it very well. He is trying to look after Cricket Australia. I don’t like seeing Pat get smacked for this because I think he is in a lose-lose situation. He sits right in the middle.” Australian Cricketers’ Association chief Todd Greenberg says the Australian playing group thinks “very fondly” of ousted coach Justin Langer. Travis Head thought he’d be available for the first T20I of Australia’s five-match series against Sri Lanka but plans have changed. Footage of a batter’s unusual dismissal in a Tasmanian third grade game has sparked debate about the Laws of Cricket.","image_url":null,"source_id":"news","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Absolute disgrace’: Warnie’s scathing rant","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/absolute-disgrace-warnie-scorches-cricket-australia-over-langer/news-story/863f98eee2752d991bf263ba64dd19d5","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shane Warne has scorched Cricket Australia as part of an extraordinary interview surrounding the state of the sport in Australia.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-07 18:45:00","full_description":null,"image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Double bonus point win has Mt Barker on cusp of grand final berth in Albany and Districts Cricket Association","link":"https://thewest.com.au/news/albany-advertiser/double-bonus-point-win-has-mt-barker-on-cusp-of-grand-final-berth-in-albany-and-districts-cricket-association-c-5594969","keywords":null,"creator":["Taj Stubber"],"video_url":null,"description":"Mathematically, the Bulls could be knocked from top spot, if they lose their final three matches and Royals win their final four games with bonus points.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-02-07 18:00:00","full_description":null,"image_url":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-5594969/19d8d5b68c1f5258a47514ec910862e1b57fe2ff-16x9-x0y495w3794h2134.jpg","source_id":"thewest","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
