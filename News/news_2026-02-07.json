Their return will be a welcome boost.\"We know that conditions can spin in Sri Lanka and we'll assess that when we get there,\" added Marsh, who will open with Travis Head. \"We've got some extremely good players of spin coming back and experience coming back.\"Adding to their problems, Australia are missing star pacemen Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood for the whole tournament.Cummins is still recovering from a lower back issue while the injury-prone Hazlewood has hamstring and Achilles problems.Fellow speedster Nathan Ellis is also making his return from injury, while spinner Adam Zampa reportedly has a groin complaint.Australia open their title bid against Ireland in Colombo on Wednesday.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID
