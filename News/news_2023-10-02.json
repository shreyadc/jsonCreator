KUWAIT CITY, Oct 1: In the first Asian qualifiers hosted by Doha, the Kuwaiti cricket team faced a defeat today, Sunday, against their Saudi counterparts, with a score of 174 runs to 175. These qualifiers determine the teams that will earn a spot in the upcoming World Cup, set to be hosted by the United States next year. The Kuwaiti team, despite securing two consecutive victories against Qatar and the Maldives, was unable to clinch a third successive win. This loss leaves their point total at four, while the Saudi team currently leads the table with six points. The tournament follows a league system, with each team playing two matches against the other participating teams, resulting in each team participating in six matches. The winning team in each match earns two points, and the team with the most points will advance to the second stage of qualifiers to be held in Nepal. The Kuwaiti cricket team previously secured a victory against the host Qatari team with a score of 124 runs to 123 and achieved another win over the Maldives team with a score of 103 to 100. Tomorrow, Monday, the team is set to play its fourth match against the Qatari team. These qualifiers began on the 28th of the previous month and are taking place in Doha at the Asian city’s stadiums. They will continue until the 5th of October with the participation of teams from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Maldives. The first-place winner in this tournament will secure a spot in the second qualifier, scheduled to be held in Nepal. This post has been read 454 times!

The post Saints ready to bounce back appeared first on Brimbank & North West.","content":"St Albans believes it has all bases covered as it aims to return to finals in the Victorian Turf Cricket Association senior division. The Saints were in the finals mix until the final round, before a loss resulted in them finishing in seventh spot. New Saints captain-coach Shafraz Mohammed said the pre-season had been really good. “It’s not long now, the season starts in a couple of weeks,” he said. “We’ve done everything we can and had a really good pre-season. “We’ve done a lot of fitness work and had a couple of practice games. I’m very happy with it.” The Saints have added in four players to last season’s squad, with just one departure. Mohammed will play a key role for the Saints with the ball this season, having helped his previous side, Footscray United, to two straight premierships. Ashen Abeykoon joins Mohammed in crossing from Footscray United. He has been named in two VTCA teams of the year and took 40 wickets in the 21-22 season. Akila Ishanka joins the club from St Andrews and has been one of the top players in the competition, being named in the VTCA teams of the year five times. The other signing is Nils Priestley. He’s headed down under this Summer in sensational form, having played in England where he made 147 not out from 66 balls in a T20 match. On the other side, the Saints have lost Geeth Alwis to Westmeadows. Mohammed said while Alwis is a big loss, they felt like they had more than replaced him. “It’s hard losing someone with that experience,” he said. “We have covered his loss with what we have picked up. “We think we have everything covered.” The Saints season will get underway on October 7, but the fixture has yet to be confirmed. Mohammed said he was hoping to continue his good record of recent seasons at his club. “Nothing short of making finals for me,” he said. “I’ve made finals the last three years and won two flats. “Hopefully I can keep the streak going at St Albans.” Mohammed said they would like had a bit of a break before the season kicks off after having such a big pre-season. Meanwhile, Westmeadows will replace Haig Fawkner in senior division this season. The Warriors were set to be relegated to division 1, but instead Haig will be the side to drop down.

The Babar Azam -led side scored 345 with the help of a century from Mohammed Rizwan and a gritty 80 from the skipper. However, that was not enough as New Zealand were able to chase it down with 6.2 overs to spare. Raja said that Pakistan are getting a habit of losing and pointed out that if the bowlers fail to perform on the big stage, the team will have to score more than 400 runs. \"I know it was just a practice game, but a win is a win. And winning becomes a habit. But I feel Pakistan are now getting a habit of losing. First they lost in Asia Cup, and now here. Pakistan scored 345 and it was a great run-chase. If these are the pitches – and you will get such pitches in India – you will have to score 400 if your bowling keeps misfiring like this. You will have to change your tactics, take risks. And we don't do that. We play defensively for first 10-15 overs and then shift gears,\" he told reporters. Rachin Ravindra and returning Kane Williamson played key knocks as New Zealand chased down 345 to thrash Pakistan by five wickets in a World Cup warm-up match on Friday. Chasing 346 for victory, New Zealand lost an early wicket before Ravindra (97) and Williamson (54) put on 137 to put their team on course and they achieved the target with 6.2 overs to spare in Hyderabad. Mohammed Rizwan hit 103 and Babar Azam made 80 in Pakistan's 345-5 after electing to bat first but the Kiwi batsmen made the total look easy against an attack missing pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi. Williamson, who returned from a six-month lay-off due to his knee injury and played the match only as a batsman, looked impressive in his 50-ball stay before he retired out.

The Saints were in the finals mix until the final round, before a loss resulted in them finishing in seventh spot. New Saints captain-coach Shafraz Mohammed said the pre-season had been really good. “It’s not long now, the season starts in a couple of weeks,” he said. “We’ve done everything we can and had a really good pre-season. “We’ve done a lot of fitness work and had a couple of practice games. I’m very happy with it.” The Saints have added in four players to last season’s squad, with just one departure. Mohammed will play a key role for the Saints with the ball this season, having helped his previous side, Footscray United, to two straight premierships. Ashen Abeykoon joins Mohammed in crossing from Footscray United. He has been named in two VTCA teams of the year and took 40 wickets in the 21-22 season. Akila Ishanka joins the club from St Andrews and has been one of the top players in the competition, being named in the VTCA teams of the year five times. The other signing is Nils Priestley. He’s headed down under this Summer in sensational form, having played in England where he made 147 not out from 66 balls in a T20 match. On the other side, the Saints have lost Geeth Alwis to Westmeadows. Mohammed said while Alwis is a big loss, they felt like they had more than replaced him. “It’s hard losing someone with that experience,” he said. “We have covered his loss with what we have picked up. “We think we have everything covered.” The Saints season will get underway on October 7, but the fixture has yet to be confirmed. Mohammed said he was hoping to continue his good record of recent seasons at his club. “Nothing short of making finals for me,” he said. “I’ve made finals the last three years and won two flats. “Hopefully I can keep the streak going at St Albans.” Mohammed said they would like had a bit of a break before the season kicks off after having such a big pre-season. Meanwhile, Westmeadows will replace Haig Fawkner in senior division this season. The Warriors were set to be relegated to division 1, but instead Haig will be the side to drop down.

The Babar Azam -led side scored 345 with the help of a century from Mohammed Rizwan and a gritty 80 from the skipper. However, that was not enough as New Zealand were able to chase it down with 6.2 overs to spare. Raja said that Pakistan are getting a habit of losing and pointed out that if the bowlers fail to perform on the big stage, the team will have to score more than 400 runs. \"I know it was just a practice game, but a win is a win. And winning becomes a habit. But I feel Pakistan are now getting a habit of losing. First they lost in Asia Cup, and now here. Pakistan scored 345 and it was a great run-chase. If these are the pitches – and you will get such pitches in India – you will have to score 400 if your bowling keeps misfiring like this. You will have to change your tactics, take risks. And we don't do that. We play defensively for first 10-15 overs and then shift gears,\" he told reporters. Rachin Ravindra and returning Kane Williamson played key knocks as New Zealand chased down 345 to thrash Pakistan by five wickets in a World Cup warm-up match on Friday. Chasing 346 for victory, New Zealand lost an early wicket before Ravindra (97) and Williamson (54) put on 137 to put their team on course and they achieved the target with 6.2 overs to spare in Hyderabad. Mohammed Rizwan hit 103 and Babar Azam made 80 in Pakistan's 345-5 after electing to bat first but the Kiwi batsmen made the total look easy against an attack missing pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi. Williamson, who returned from a six-month lay-off due to his knee injury and played the match only as a batsman, looked impressive in his 50-ball stay before he retired out.

He doesn’t have a lot of idea about the conditions but the likened the Hyderabad pitch to the flat deck in Rawalpindi. “Conditions will change as we will be playing in different venues and we have to adapt to conditions very quickly and also fitness-wise as it’s a long tournament and the Asia Cup saw some fast bowlers getting injured (Naseem Shah). So fitness will be a concern for all teams but hopefully not for us as we lost one of the key players already.” Shadab believes in the old cricketing saying that batters win you games and bowlers win you tournaments. He also backed under-fire opener Fakhar Zaman. “Babar, Rizwan, Iman are our consistent players and this is my feeling that the team that bowls well will win the World Cup. It will be difficult to contain the batsmen and pick wickets given the nature of flat tracks and short boundaries. We have world class bowlers and as a bowling unit if we perform well we will become champions,” he said. Haris Rauf too quick for openers in high-intensity training All the squad members, including the three travelling reserves turned up for Pakistan’s second training session in India. Pakistan batters get to face the likes of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf in the nets regularly, ideal preparation for seriously quick fast bowlers in the rival teams. Even with half a run-up, Rauf was able to trouble Fakhar and Imam Ul Haq while Babar Azam faced him with relative ease. Team director Mickey Arthur, who joined the team on Sunday, closely watched the batters go about their business and had the biggest praise reserved for Mohammad Rizwan. #Ajay Devgn #Bollywood #Pakistan #Rohit Sharma","pubDate":"2023-10-01 12:40:38","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2023/10/2023_10$largeimg_284143277.jpeg","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c9dbf2e24b94d37f8eec94fcba56365f","title":"بابراعظم یا شاہین شاہ آفریدی، ورلڈ کپ میں پاکستان کیلئے زیادہ اہم کون ہے؟ معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا بڑا دعویٰ","link":"https://pni.net.pk/sports-news/cricket-news/490704/","keywords":["کرکٹ","کھیل"],"creator":["Hamza Jahangir"],"video_url":null,"description":"لاہور (پی این آئی ) معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا ماننا ہے کہ آئی سی سی ورلڈ کپ 2023ء سے قبل کپتان بابر اعظم کے مقابلے میں تیز گیند باز شاہین آفریدی پاکستان کے لیے زیادہ اہم ہوں گے۔ ہرشا بھوگلے نے کہا کہ [...] The post بابراعظم یا شاہین شاہ آفریدی، ورلڈ کپ میں پاکستان کیلئے زیادہ اہم کون ہے؟ معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا بڑا دعویٰ appeared first on Pakistan News International - Latest Pakistani News in Urdu.","content":"لاہور (پی این آئی ) معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا ماننا ہے کہ آئی سی سی ورلڈ کپ 2023ء سے قبل کپتان بابر اعظم کے مقابلے میں تیز گیند باز شاہین آفریدی پاکستان کے لیے زیادہ اہم ہوں گے۔ ہرشا بھوگلے نے کہا کہ شاہین نئی گیند سے وکٹیں لینے کی اپنی صلاحیت کے ساتھ پاکستان کے لیے ٹیمپو سیٹ کرتے ہیں ۔ ہرشا بھوگلے نے کرک بز پر کہا کہ “شاہین آفریدی ایک طرح سے بابر اعظم سے بھی زیادہ اہم ہیں کیونکہ جب وہ پہلے 10 اوورز میں وکٹیں نہیں لے رہے ہوتے تو آپ نے ایشیا کپ میں دیکھا کہ کیا ہوتا ہے۔اگر پاکستان کو پاور پلے میں وکٹیں نہیں ملتی ہیں تو وہ اچانک ایک بہت ٹینشن زدہ باولنگ سائیڈ نظر آئے گی، جنوبی افریقہ کے ساتھ ہم نے اینریچ نورٹجے کی گمشدگی کے بارے میں بات کی، میرے خیال میں نسیم شاہ ان کے لیے ایک بڑا دھچکا ہے”۔انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ “انہیں اچھا کرنے کے لیے اپنے اسپنرز کی ضرورت ہے۔ میرے خیال میں پاکستان کے لیے کہانی یہ ہوگی کہ کیا وہ اپنے اوپنرز کو اچھا کھیل سکتے ہیں اور کیا وہ اپنے اسپنرز کو درمیانی اوورز میں اچھی بولنگ کروا سکتے ہیں”۔ہرشا بھوگلے نے فخر زمان کی خراب فارم کو دیکھتے ہوئے امام الحق اور عبداللہ شفیق کے ساتھ اوپننگ کے لیے پاکستان کی حمایت کی۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ “انہیں فخر زمان کے ساتھ مسئلہ ہے لیکن مجھے حقیقت میں یقین ہے کہ وہ اپنے بہترین اوپننگ کمبی نیشن میں ٹھوکر کھا گئے ہیں ،امام نے دیر سے بہت اچھی کارکردگی کا مظاہرہ کیا ہے لیکن وہ عبداللہ شفیق جیسے کھلاڑی کو کیسے نہیں کھلا سکتے”۔انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ اگر عبداللہ شفیق اور امام الحق کو مستقل طور پر موقع دیا جائے تو اچانک بابر ایک مختلف کھلاڑی بن جاتا ہے لیکن اس میں کوئی شک نہیں، اگر پاکستان پر اثر ڈالنا ہے تو بابر اعظم کو ورلڈ کپ میں بڑی پرفارمنس دینی ہوگی ۔ ہرشا بھوگلے پاکستان کے مڈل آرڈر اور سپن بولنگ کے اختیارات کے بارے میں فکر مند تھے۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ “ان کا مڈل آرڈر تھوڑا سا اچھا ہے۔میں جانتا ہوں کہ رضوان ، سلمان آغا ، افتخار احمد، سعود شکیل اچھے کھلاڑی ہیں۔ کیا آپ ورلڈ کپ جیتنے کے لیے ان پر بھروسہ کر سکتے ہیں؟ ہم انتظار کریں گے اور دیکھیں گے۔ یہ پاکستان کے لیے بہت اچھا ہے، وہ گہری بیٹنگ کرتے ہیں کیونکہ جن تینوں سپنرز کو منتخب کیا گیا ہے ان میں سے ہر ایک بیٹنگ کر سکتا ہے، میرے خیال میں شاداب اس آرڈر کے نیچے بہت اچھا بلے باز ہے، نواز بیٹنگ کر سکتا ہے، اسامہ میر، اگر وہ لیگ سپنر ہے تو وہ بیٹنگ کر سکتا ہے لیکن یہ وہ جگہ ہے جہاں ان کی مسئلہ شروع ہوتا ہے۔ ” انہوں نے نتیجہ اخذ کیا کہ “آپ عام طور پر پاکستان کو دیکھتے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ واہ کتنی اچھی باؤلنگ سائیڈ ہے، لیکن درمیانی اوورز میں سپنرز ان کے لیے ڈیلیور نہیں کر رہے”۔ واضح رہے کہ پاکستانی ٹیم میگا ایونٹ میں شرکت کے لیے بدھ کو دبئی سے بھارت کے شہر حیدرآباد کے راجیو گاندھی انٹرنیشنل ایئرپورٹ پر اتری۔ انہوں نے ایک وارم اپ میچ بھی کھیلا ہے، جسے وہ جمعہ کو نیوزی لینڈ کے خلاف پانچ وکٹوں سے ہار گئے تھے۔ گرین شرٹس اپنے دوسرے وارم اپ میچ میں 3 اکتوبر کو آسٹریلیا کے خلاف کھیلے گی اس سے قبل وہ 6 اکتوبر کو ہالینڈ کے خلاف ورلڈ کپ مہم کا آغاز کرے گی۔","pubDate":"2023-10-01 12:28:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"pninet","source_priority":5220220,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"urdu"},{"article_id":"5c13d942986c20f0644d89c227d7d657","title":"Kuwait Falls to Saudi Arabia in a Close Cricket Match","link":"https://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/kuwait-falls-to-saudi-arabia-in-a-close-match/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=kuwait-falls-to-saudi-arabia-in-a-close-match","keywords":["Sports","Cricket World Cup"],"creator":["Arab Times"],"video_url":null,"description":"KUWAIT CITY, Oct 1: In the first Asian qualifiers hosted by Doha, the Kuwaiti cricket team faced a defeat today, Sunday, against their Saudi counterparts, with a score of 174 runs to 175.

The Saints were in the finals mix until the final round, before a loss resulted in them finishing in seventh spot. New Saints captain-coach Shafraz Mohammed said the pre-season had been really good. “It’s not long now, the season starts in a couple of weeks,” he said. “We’ve done everything we can and had a really good pre-season. “We’ve done a lot of fitness work and had a couple of practice games. I’m very happy with it.” The Saints have added in four players to last season’s squad, with just one departure. Mohammed will play a key role for the Saints with the ball this season, having helped his previous side, Footscray United, to two straight premierships. Ashen Abeykoon joins Mohammed in crossing from Footscray United. He has been named in two VTCA teams of the year and took 40 wickets in the 21-22 season. Akila Ishanka joins the club from St Andrews and has been one of the top players in the competition, being named in the VTCA teams of the year five times. The other signing is Nils Priestley. He’s headed down under this Summer in sensational form, having played in England where he made 147 not out from 66 balls in a T20 match. On the other side, the Saints have lost Geeth Alwis to Westmeadows. Mohammed said while Alwis is a big loss, they felt like they had more than replaced him. “It’s hard losing someone with that experience,” he said. “We have covered his loss with what we have picked up. “We think we have everything covered.” The Saints season will get underway on October 7, but the fixture has yet to be confirmed. Mohammed said he was hoping to continue his good record of recent seasons at his club. “Nothing short of making finals for me,” he said. “I’ve made finals the last three years and won two flats. “Hopefully I can keep the streak going at St Albans.” Mohammed said they would like had a bit of a break before the season kicks off after having such a big pre-season. Meanwhile, Westmeadows will replace Haig Fawkner in senior division this season. The Warriors were set to be relegated to division 1, but instead Haig will be the side to drop down.

The Babar Azam -led side scored 345 with the help of a century from Mohammed Rizwan and a gritty 80 from the skipper. However, that was not enough as New Zealand were able to chase it down with 6.2 overs to spare. Raja said that Pakistan are getting a habit of losing and pointed out that if the bowlers fail to perform on the big stage, the team will have to score more than 400 runs. \"I know it was just a practice game, but a win is a win. And winning becomes a habit. But I feel Pakistan are now getting a habit of losing. First they lost in Asia Cup, and now here. Pakistan scored 345 and it was a great run-chase. If these are the pitches – and you will get such pitches in India – you will have to score 400 if your bowling keeps misfiring like this. You will have to change your tactics, take risks. And we don't do that. We play defensively for first 10-15 overs and then shift gears,\" he told reporters. Rachin Ravindra and returning Kane Williamson played key knocks as New Zealand chased down 345 to thrash Pakistan by five wickets in a World Cup warm-up match on Friday. Chasing 346 for victory, New Zealand lost an early wicket before Ravindra (97) and Williamson (54) put on 137 to put their team on course and they achieved the target with 6.2 overs to spare in Hyderabad. Mohammed Rizwan hit 103 and Babar Azam made 80 in Pakistan's 345-5 after electing to bat first but the Kiwi batsmen made the total look easy against an attack missing pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi. Williamson, who returned from a six-month lay-off due to his knee injury and played the match only as a batsman, looked impressive in his 50-ball stay before he retired out.

Among the bowlers, since I am a leg-spinner, it will be Kuldeep Yadav given his recent form,” said Shadab. ‘We have learnt from our Asia Cup mistakes’ Pakistan failed to defend 346 against the New Zealand and have plenty to think about in the bowling department including the form of premier spinner Shadab who did not bowl in the warm-up but had a forgettable Asia Cup. The next warm-up game is against Australia on October 3. His form is key for Pakistan in the middle-overs and the 24-year-old had no qualms in admitting that he did not have the best of times in Asia Cup where four of his six wickets came against Nepal and he ended with an average of 40.83. “The Asia Cup didn’t go well but that’s the beauty of cricket you learn from your mistakes and there is always an opportunity to learn and play good cricket. After we lost the Asia Cup we got good rest and I believe it’s no more a skill game but a mental game and it’s the World Cup situation. You can take good decisions when you are relaxed mentally.” Shadab is already a star but he knows the World Cup provides him with the opportunity of becoming a superstar. “I do understand that my recent form is not good but I have the skills. Just that when you are not performing you are mentally a bit down but skill wise there is no issue. “When you wear the green jersey there is a lot of expectation from our people and fans and especially when we play in India. The World Cup for a player is that if you perform, you will be a superstar,” he said. Shadab is among the majority of squad members who are touring India for the first time. He doesn’t have a lot of idea about the conditions but the likened the Hyderabad pitch to the flat deck in Rawalpindi. “Conditions will change as we will be playing in different venues and we have to adapt to conditions very quickly and also fitness-wise as it’s a long tournament and the Asia Cup saw some fast bowlers getting injured (Naseem Shah). So fitness will be a concern for all teams but hopefully not for us as we lost one of the key players already.” Shadab believes in the old cricketing saying that batters win you games and bowlers win you tournaments. He also backed under-fire opener Fakhar Zaman. “Babar, Rizwan, Iman are our consistent players and this is my feeling that the team that bowls well will win the World Cup. It will be difficult to contain the batsmen and pick wickets given the nature of flat tracks and short boundaries. We have world class bowlers and as a bowling unit if we perform well we will become champions,” he said. Haris Rauf too quick for openers in high-intensity training All the squad members, including the three travelling reserves turned up for Pakistan’s second training session in India. Pakistan batters get to face the likes of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf in the nets regularly, ideal preparation for seriously quick fast bowlers in the rival teams. Even with half a run-up, Rauf was able to trouble Fakhar and Imam Ul Haq while Babar Azam faced him with relative ease. Team director Mickey Arthur, who joined the team on Sunday, closely watched the batters go about their business and had the biggest praise reserved for Mohammad Rizwan. #Ajay Devgn #Bollywood #Pakistan #Rohit Sharma","pubDate":"2023-10-01 12:40:38","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2023/10/2023_10$largeimg_284143277.jpeg","source_id":"tribuneindia","source_priority":7916,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c9dbf2e24b94d37f8eec94fcba56365f","title":"بابراعظم یا شاہین شاہ آفریدی، ورلڈ کپ میں پاکستان کیلئے زیادہ اہم کون ہے؟ معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا بڑا دعویٰ","link":"https://pni.net.pk/sports-news/cricket-news/490704/","keywords":["کرکٹ","کھیل"],"creator":["Hamza Jahangir"],"video_url":null,"description":"لاہور (پی این آئی ) معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا ماننا ہے کہ آئی سی سی ورلڈ کپ 2023ء سے قبل کپتان بابر اعظم کے مقابلے میں تیز گیند باز شاہین آفریدی پاکستان کے لیے زیادہ اہم ہوں گے۔ ہرشا بھوگلے نے کہا کہ [...] The post بابراعظم یا شاہین شاہ آفریدی، ورلڈ کپ میں پاکستان کیلئے زیادہ اہم کون ہے؟ معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا بڑا دعویٰ appeared first on Pakistan News International - Latest Pakistani News in Urdu.","content":"لاہور (پی این آئی ) معروف بھارتی کمنٹیٹر ہرشا بھوگلے کا ماننا ہے کہ آئی سی سی ورلڈ کپ 2023ء سے قبل کپتان بابر اعظم کے مقابلے میں تیز گیند باز شاہین آفریدی پاکستان کے لیے زیادہ اہم ہوں گے۔ ہرشا بھوگلے نے کہا کہ شاہین نئی گیند سے وکٹیں لینے کی اپنی صلاحیت کے ساتھ پاکستان کے لیے ٹیمپو سیٹ کرتے ہیں ۔ ہرشا بھوگلے نے کرک بز پر کہا کہ “شاہین آفریدی ایک طرح سے بابر اعظم سے بھی زیادہ اہم ہیں کیونکہ جب وہ پہلے 10 اوورز میں وکٹیں نہیں لے رہے ہوتے تو آپ نے ایشیا کپ میں دیکھا کہ کیا ہوتا ہے۔اگر پاکستان کو پاور پلے میں وکٹیں نہیں ملتی ہیں تو وہ اچانک ایک بہت ٹینشن زدہ باولنگ سائیڈ نظر آئے گی، جنوبی افریقہ کے ساتھ ہم نے اینریچ نورٹجے کی گمشدگی کے بارے میں بات کی، میرے خیال میں نسیم شاہ ان کے لیے ایک بڑا دھچکا ہے”۔انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ “انہیں اچھا کرنے کے لیے اپنے اسپنرز کی ضرورت ہے۔ میرے خیال میں پاکستان کے لیے کہانی یہ ہوگی کہ کیا وہ اپنے اوپنرز کو اچھا کھیل سکتے ہیں اور کیا وہ اپنے اسپنرز کو درمیانی اوورز میں اچھی بولنگ کروا سکتے ہیں”۔ہرشا بھوگلے نے فخر زمان کی خراب فارم کو دیکھتے ہوئے امام الحق اور عبداللہ شفیق کے ساتھ اوپننگ کے لیے پاکستان کی حمایت کی۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ “انہیں فخر زمان کے ساتھ مسئلہ ہے لیکن مجھے حقیقت میں یقین ہے کہ وہ اپنے بہترین اوپننگ کمبی نیشن میں ٹھوکر کھا گئے ہیں ،امام نے دیر سے بہت اچھی کارکردگی کا مظاہرہ کیا ہے لیکن وہ عبداللہ شفیق جیسے کھلاڑی کو کیسے نہیں کھلا سکتے”۔انہوں نے مزید کہا کہ اگر عبداللہ شفیق اور امام الحق کو مستقل طور پر موقع دیا جائے تو اچانک بابر ایک مختلف کھلاڑی بن جاتا ہے لیکن اس میں کوئی شک نہیں، اگر پاکستان پر اثر ڈالنا ہے تو بابر اعظم کو ورلڈ کپ میں بڑی پرفارمنس دینی ہوگی ۔ ہرشا بھوگلے پاکستان کے مڈل آرڈر اور سپن بولنگ کے اختیارات کے بارے میں فکر مند تھے۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ “ان کا مڈل آرڈر تھوڑا سا اچھا ہے۔میں جانتا ہوں کہ رضوان ، سلمان آغا ، افتخار احمد، سعود شکیل اچھے کھلاڑی ہیں۔ کیا آپ ورلڈ کپ جیتنے کے لیے ان پر بھروسہ کر سکتے ہیں؟ ہم انتظار کریں گے اور دیکھیں گے۔ یہ پاکستان کے لیے بہت اچھا ہے، وہ گہری بیٹنگ کرتے ہیں کیونکہ جن تینوں سپنرز کو منتخب کیا گیا ہے ان میں سے ہر ایک بیٹنگ کر سکتا ہے، میرے خیال میں شاداب اس آرڈر کے نیچے بہت اچھا بلے باز ہے، نواز بیٹنگ کر سکتا ہے، اسامہ میر، اگر وہ لیگ سپنر ہے تو وہ بیٹنگ کر سکتا ہے لیکن یہ وہ جگہ ہے جہاں ان کی مسئلہ شروع ہوتا ہے۔ ” انہوں نے نتیجہ اخذ کیا کہ “آپ عام طور پر پاکستان کو دیکھتے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ واہ کتنی اچھی باؤلنگ سائیڈ ہے، لیکن درمیانی اوورز میں سپنرز ان کے لیے ڈیلیور نہیں کر رہے”۔ واضح رہے کہ پاکستانی ٹیم میگا ایونٹ میں شرکت کے لیے بدھ کو دبئی سے بھارت کے شہر حیدرآباد کے راجیو گاندھی انٹرنیشنل ایئرپورٹ پر اتری۔ انہوں نے ایک وارم اپ میچ بھی کھیلا ہے، جسے وہ جمعہ کو نیوزی لینڈ کے خلاف پانچ وکٹوں سے ہار گئے تھے۔ گرین شرٹس اپنے دوسرے وارم اپ میچ میں 3 اکتوبر کو آسٹریلیا کے خلاف کھیلے گی اس سے قبل وہ 6 اکتوبر کو ہالینڈ کے خلاف ورلڈ کپ مہم کا آغاز کرے گی۔","pubDate":"2023-10-01 12:28:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"pninet","source_priority":5220220,"country":["pakistan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"urdu"}]}
