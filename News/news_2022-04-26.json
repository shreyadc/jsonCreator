Veteran Chennai Super Kings batter Ambati Rayudu’s stroke-filled half-century against Punjab Kings in the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League went in vain as his team failed to seal a 188-run target tonight. Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the eighth over with his team needing more than 11 runs per over to win the match, Rayudu batted at a strike rate of 200 scoring 78 (39) with the help of seven fours and six sixes. Making the most of run-scoring opportunities in a desperate situation, Rayudu did pretty well at dispatching multiple rank short balls and full tosses into the stands.

Is Ambati Rayudu retired from international cricket? Rayudu, 36, is into his 13th IPL season (fifth at CSK). Rayudu, who had played his first eight IPL seasons for Mumbai Indians, had last played for India during a home ODI series against Australia more than three years ago. A six-year old international career had witnessed Rayudu playing 55 ODIs and six T20Is for India scoring 1,736 runs in 55 innings at an average and strike rate of 43.40 and 79.16 respectively including three centuries and 10 half-centuries.

Royal Challengers Bangalore will be up against Rajasthan Royals in the 39th league game of Indian Premier League 2022 at the MCA Stadium in Pune. RCB have won five of their eight games in the tournament, whereas Rajasthan Royals have won five of their seven games. RCB bundled out for just 68 runs in the last game, where the left-arm pacers of Sunrisers Hyderabad broke their back. Rajasthan Royals also have two left-arm pacers in Trent Boult and Obed McCoy. The lower-order batting and bowling of the RCB have been great this season. Rajasthan Royals have been terrific in the tournament, where Jos Buttler holds the orange cap and Yuzvendra Chahal holds the purple cap. The Royals would want to continue their form. Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium pitch report RCB vs RR The pitch at the MCA Stadium has been a paradise for the batters this season. There has been an even bounce on the track, and the boundaries are also quite small on this ground. Pat Cummins scored the joint-fastest IPL half-century in 14 balls on the very same ground. A total of six league games have been played at the venue this season, where the average 1st innings score has been 177 runs. Out of six, the defending teams have won three games, whereas the chasing teams have also won thrice. Just like Jai-Veeru. #RoyalsFamily | #दिलसेरॉयल pic.twitter.com/t2CKEm6CnO — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 25, 2022 The last game at this venue was played between Gujarat and Chennai, where David Miller played an incredible knock of 94 runs in just 51 balls to lead his side Gujarat Titans to a brilliant win. This pitch has provided some assistance to the spinners. A black soil surface will be used for this game, which offers assistance to the batters, and the spinners get some grip from the pitch. The dew factor won’t play that much impact on this ground as compared to the venues in Mumbai. So, if a team can bat first and score a respectable score, defending it won’t be an issue.   The post Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium pitch report RCB vs RR: Bangalore vs Rajasthan Pune pitch report 2022 IPL match appeared first on The SportsRush.","pubDate":"2022-04-25 17:32:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Africa legend Graeme Smith cleared of racism and slams \"baseless allegations\"","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/south-africa-graeme-smith-racism-26795407","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Matthew Cooper)"],"video_url":null,"description":"South Africa legend Graeme Smith, who was the former CSA director of cricket, has been cleared of racism by two independent arbitrators after allegations were levelled at him","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-25 17:18:33","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26795385.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1188631116.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tata IPL 2022 PBKS vs CSK Live Cricket Score and Update: Rabada removes Gaikwad to dent CSK","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/pbks-vs-csk-live-cricket-score-tata-ipl-2022-match-scorecard-live-update-punjab-kings-vs-chennai-super-kings-indian-premier-league-live-streaming-today-10591871.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tata IPL 2022 PBKS vs CSK Live Cricket Score and Update: Rabada removes Gaikwad to dent CSK","content":"22:48 (IST)SIX!

The top order was an extreme failure for them as no batter other than Mayank Agarwal and Jitesh Sharma managed to cross the 20-run mark. The Kings managed to post just 115 runs which was comfortably chased down by Delhi Capitals with nine wickets in hand and 57 balls to spare. With Punjab Kings reeling at the eights spot on the league table, they need to recollect their form before it gets too late.Chennai Super Kings, on the other hand, are looking confident after securing a nail-biting win in their last match against Mumbai Indians. MS Dhoni turned out to be the saviour for them in the last over thriller. Batting first, Mumbai Indians posted a score of 155 runs in 20 overs. While chasing down 156 runs, Robin Uthappa and Ambati Rayudu clicked well for Chennai to steer the team home. Dhoni smashed 16 runs in the last four deliveries including a last-ball boundary to snatch the much-needed win for them. However, they are not in a comfortable position on the points table.

During the 38th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Punjab Kings and Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium, Punjab Kings all-rounder Rishi Dhawan celebrated his IPL comeback by picking the wicket of an in-form batter in Shivam Dube. Dhawan, who had conceded 86 runs in 12 overs that he bowled in the powerplay across 10 innings in the first phase of his IPL career between 2013-2016, was introduced into the bowling attack as a first-change bowler in the powerplay by PBKS captain Mayank Agarwal. Dhawan, who conceded 11 runs off as many deliveries in his first IPL match in six years, saw Dube playing on a delivery to his stumps after scoring 8 (7). Coming him to bat at No. 5 with his team needing more than 11 runs per over to win the match, CSK batter Ambati Rayudu did attack Dhawan by hitting a four and a six in his third over but the right-arm bowler perhaps did his job on the back of bowling figures of 3-0-24-1. Bowling helmet Rishi Dhawan Dhawan, 32, also allured attention at the Wankhede Stadium tonight by becoming the first cricketer to introduce a bowling helmet in cricket.

During the 38th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Punjab Kings and Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium, Punjab Kings all-rounder Rishi Dhawan celebrated his IPL comeback by picking the wicket of an in-form batter in Shivam Dube. Dhawan, who had conceded 86 runs in 12 overs that he bowled in the powerplay across 10 innings in the first phase of his IPL career between 2013-2016, was introduced into the bowling attack as a first-change bowler in the powerplay by PBKS captain Mayank Agarwal. Dhawan, who conceded 11 runs off as many deliveries in his first IPL match in six years, saw Dube playing on a delivery to his stumps after scoring 8 (7). ALSO READ: Are Shikhar Dhawan and Rishi Dhawan related to each other? Coming him to bat at No. 5 with his team needing more than 11 runs per over to win the match, CSK batter Ambati Rayudu did attack Dhawan by hitting a four and a six in his third over but the right-arm bowler perhaps did his job on the back of bowling figures of 3-0-24-1. Dhawan, 32, also allured attention at the Wankhede Stadium tonight by becoming the first cricketer to introduce a bowling helmet in the IPL.

Opening the batting with captain Mayank Agarwal (18), Dhawan put together a 110-run second-wicket partnership alongside Bhanuka Rajapaksa (42) to lay a solid foundation for a death-overs blast.

Former India head coach Gary Kirsten keen on England Test job Read more “I had no warning,” he says. “I was commentating at the Oval during India’s [2014] tour of England and came off air to find six or seven missed calls. ‘Seven bloody calls? What’s happened here?’. [The BCCI] just said: ‘We want you to take over, starting tomorrow, at any cost’.

You’ll see when I joined the set-up [during the ODIs], I was still in jeans and loafers. Instantly my job changed.” I was very firm when it came to team culture: all the prima donnas and all that shit, that had to go out of the window early It is worth stating at this juncture that while Shastri, like Key, had no coaching qualifications and – bar a brief stint as India’s team manager in 2007 – had spent his retirement from playing behind the microphone, the worlds they walked into are vastly different. With head coaches and a selector still to be appointed by England, responsibilities will be fanned out and Key is unlikely to don the training gear. Nevertheless, Shastri insists the broader challenges are the same, not least entering a set-up as an outsider who previously had to pass judgment on the players. “Rob may have more work with the domestic game but when it comes to the national team, it is very similar,” he says. “The most important thing is getting among the players and setting a tone from the outset: what you believe in, what you think of them and changing the mindset to compete and win. You have to be bullish and brutish in wanting to achieve that. For us, and now England, it was about setting the challenge of winning abroad, big time. I was very firm when it came to team culture: all the prima donnas and all that shit, that had to go out of the window early. Shastri celebrates with his players during the T20 World Cup in Dubai last year, his last tournament as India’s head coach. Photograph: Michael Steele/ICC/Getty Images “And you leave everything you said as a commentator behind. Park it. When I was the director of the team, it was about diagnosing problems: I was asked to hire and fire, whoever I wanted I could get in and whoever I didn’t could be shown the door. And it was also outlining how we want to play: to be aggressive and ruthless, to up the fitness levels, to get a group of fast bowlers to take 20 wickets overseas. And it was about attitude, especially when playing the Aussies. I told the boys if one single ‘fuck you’ comes your way, give them three back: two in our language and one in theirs.” It’s a classic Shastri-ism, the same mustachioed chutzpah that has run through from his playing days like words in a stick of rock. He and Key are different characters – there is only one Ravi Shastri, let’s be honest – but both call the game as they see it. And though the 59-year-old warns there will be resentment of his slightly left-field appointment, he is adamant the volume of cricket that modern commentators consume around the world is an advantage over those who come through one system. “Rob will have an adjustment period to understand the issues and will need to speak in detail with Joe Root for his experiences as Test captain,” he says. “But in my 24 years [commentating], I did not miss a beat or a ball of Indian cricket. And he will have covered a huge amount too. So you’re not lagging behind by an inch, you’re abreast of what a team requires but also what other teams are doing. You should be able to leapfrog over all those early issues and get into the nitty gritty straight away. “And I didn’t have coaching badges [either]. Level one? Level two? Fuck that. And in a country like India, there is always jealousy or a gang of people willing you to fail. I had a thick skin, thicker than the leather of the Dukes ball you use. A real solid hide. And you need a bloody hide over here. Rob will develop this as he does the job, because every day you are judged. And I am glad he has a lot of captaincy experience from his time at Kent, because communication with the players is paramount.” Rob Key had a comfortable post-playing career working for Sky, but Shastri says that experience will also help him in his new role. Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images So much of Shastri’s philosophy comes down to unbridled aggression and in Virat Kohli he had a captain ready to spread this through the squad. The results speak for themselves, India winning 10 Test series out of 14, rising to No 1 in the rankings and beating Australia in their own back yard twice. Key is expected to appoint Ben Stokes to lead England’s Test team, a cricketer Shastri describes as a “first class” option. “The adrenaline of captaincy – not that he needs it – could fire Stokes up to be something even more than the incredible player he is now,” he says. “The important relationship is with the captain – the moment there is friction, things go downhill. But they will be fine, because the England I saw last year, they have enough talent and skill to compete. There’s no doubt in my mind. It’s all about their mindset.” This appraisal of England may surprise some but Shastri is keen to talk up his legacy here. There is one Test remaining from the series India led 2-1 last summer – to be staged at Edgbaston in July – and the former all-rounder will be back commentating for Sky, hoping his former charges, now under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, can complete a famous double. “How many teams can win in Australia – beating an attack with Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood from 1-0 down – and then win in England? That will be hard for any team to replicate for a long time,” he purrs. Be prepared to bat five hours to get a century in England, it won’t come in three and you’ll get out trying The rescheduled fifth Test will be a strange occasion to bill given the 12-month lag and the turnover of players and coaching staff since. But whatever the outcome, it is worth acknowledging the enviable team that India brought over in 2021. Not only did they secure famous victories at Lord’s and the Oval, but did so with batters like Sharma and KL Rahul playing in a wonderfully disciplined and correct manner that sat in huge contrast to – barring Root – England’s array of Heath Robinsons and carbuncles. “Mentality and technique trump past records in domestic cricket,” he insists. “Get the first two right and the runs will come. It was all about the preparation. We told our batsmen to leave their driving licence behind and learn to leave the ball. Make the bowler bowl to you and you’ll score. Be prepared to bat five hours to get a century in England, it won’t come in three and you’ll get out trying. “We also had slingers (coaches with dogsticks) in the nets smashing the ball in at 160kph from 16 yards. Guys had no choice. There was no dodging, I’d stand behind the stumps to make sure of that. No matter who the person was, he had to go through that. The slingers would seriously let it rip and guys would look ugly. But you are meant to look ugly in the nets. In England you have to grind and earn your runs. “The same with the bowlers, we told them to stick in because there is a five-wicket session at any given time in England and at Lord’s and the Oval this decided the result. And we knew winning in Australia or England wasn’t coming with spin, it was fast bowlers, guys with aggression like Jasprit Bumrah . We were instrumental in making sure that guy played Test cricket. You don’t even need express pace, you just need attitude.” The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. On the subject of bowlers, Shastri is convinced England need to suspend all future planning and bring Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad back into the fold. “If their form is good, play them,” he stresses. “There is no substitute for experience. Test cricket is the purest form of the game and if the guys are fit, hungry, you jolly well look in that direction. Every country makes this mistake, looking too far ahead. It’s too easy to look 100ft away and lose the plot by not backing the guys who have been there and done it.” Stokes is believed to be in agreement here but England’s incoming head coach and selector will have their own say. Shastri will watch it all unfold from Sky’s broadcast studios and, after India’s visit, his oak-panelled voice will be heard during the Hundred. Does he have one final piece of advice for Key as he heads in the opposite direction? “Tell your players to embrace the culture of a country, mix with its people, understand who they are, then give them everything, so they know a force is coming for them,” he says. “Give it right back and get some runs. Stand up, have the stomach for a fight and when you get the ball, give it right back, no compromise. It’s all about results but the goodwill if you succeed? Well, you don’t get that as a player or a commentator.”","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b63fbdee2e371cd3c4d70b482b45ce3500432e/0_223_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=35819672ee98aa068399e210bb3f76c4","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL Schedule 2022 this week, 25 April to 1 May, time table, match list and venue details","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ipl-schedule-2022-this-week-25-april-to-1-may-time-table-match-list-and-venue-details-10598091.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FP Trending"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL Schedule 2022 this week, 25 April to 1 May, time table, match list and venue details","content":"With five-time champions Mumbai Indians already out of playoff reckoning - they do have an outside mathematical probability of making it to the playoffs but for that to happen, they would need the entire universe's luck on their side - the fifth week of the Indian Premier League 2022 will see a battle between six teams for three spots.Gujarat Titans are only a couple of wins away from securing a top-four finish and considering their form, it is highly unlikely that they won't win at least two of their remaining seven matches.This leaves only three spots open and for that, we might see a battle between Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, Lucknow Super Giants, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings.With just three wins in eight matches, it will be an uphill task for Kolkata Knight Riders to make a case for themselves in the playoff race.

The Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians outfit lie rock-bottom of the points table with zero points, the only team yet to open the account in this IPL season.MI began their IPL campaign with a four-wicket defeat to Delhi Capitals on 27 March, and their latest of the eight defeats came against Lucknow Super Giants on Sunday, after their batters failed to chase down Lucknow’s total of 168 at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium. The loss to LSG meant that MI were all but out of contention for the IPL playoffs.Skipper Rohit’s inconsistent form this season has been a worrying sign for MI, having scored just 153 runs from eight matches at an average of 19.13. Meanwhile, Ishan Kishan, who was re-acquired by MI at the auction in February for a whopping Rs 15.25 crore, is enduring a tough time with the bat despite notching up two fifties at the start of the tournament.Just a day after their loss to Lucknow, captain Rohit Sharma took to Twitter on Monday to admit that MI haven’t put their ‘best foot forward’, while also reiterating his love for the team.“We haven’t put our best foot forward in this tournament but that happens,many sporting giants have gone through this phase but I love this team and it’s environment. Also want to appreciate our well wishers who’ve shown faith and undying loyalty to this team so far 💙@mipaltan,” Rohit tweeted on Monday evening.We haven’t put our best foot forward in this tournament but that happens,many sporting giants have gone through this phase but I love this team and it’s environment. Also want to appreciate our well wishers who’ve shown faith and undying loyalty to this team so far 💙@mipaltan— Rohit Sharma (@ImRo45) April 25, 2022Meanwhile, MI coach Mahela Jayawardene hinted on making a few changes to the team lineup after repeated batting failures.“I need to review this and a have a chat with the rest of the coaches as well and make some plans,\" Jayawardene said after Mumbai’s loss to Lucknow.\"Batting has been a concern for us especially on good wickets where we have batted under par. This is a senior group who understands the conditions and performed in the past. We need to keep pushing and if we need to make those changes we will do that,” Jayawardene added.Jayawardene also said he would be having a chat with out-of-form Kishan regarding his recent failures. After notching up fifties off the first two games, Kishan has endured scores of 14, 26, 3, 13, 0 and 8 in the next six.\"He has struggled a bit, we have given him the freedom to play his natural game. I haven't yet spoken to him today but I will have a conversation with him soon,” the 44-year-old said.Rohit Sharma (39) got off to a good start but failed to capitalise on it against Lucknow, while Kishan, Dewald Brevis and Suryakumar Yadav were dismissed for single figures. Tilak Varma (38) and Kieron Pollard (19) provided a late respite but were dismissed in the closing stages of the game. MI eventually fell short by 36 runs.Next up, MI take on Rajasthan Royals (RR) at DY Patil Stadium on Saturday (30 April).Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, IPL Live Score, IPL 2022 schedule, IPL 2022 Points table and Entertainment News.

Chennai Super Kings will take on Punjab Kings in the 38th league game of the Indian Premier League 2022. The game will be played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Both teams have not played well this season. Punjab Kings have won three of their seven games in the tournament, whereas Chennai Super Kings have won two of their seven games. The way MS Dhoni played in the last game has certainly boosted the hopes of the Chennai Super Kings. Dhoni vs Rabada IPL stats MS Dhoni turned around the clock in the last game, when he smashed 16 runs in the last four balls to seal a win for Chennai Super Kings against Mumbai Indians. The vintage MS Dhoni was at the show in the last game, and the form of MS can be an X-factor for the side. The battle between MS Dhoni and Kagiso Rabada can be a great one to watch out for. Rabada has been the ace pacer of the Punjab Kings this season, and he may face Kagiso Rabada in the death overs. In the head-to-head battle between MS Dhoni and Kagiso Rabada, Rabada has the clear edge. In IPL games, Dhoni has managed to score 8 runs in 15 balls against Rabada at a strike-rate of 53.33. Rabada has managed to dismiss Dhoni once in the process. In overall T20s, Dhoni has scored 10 runs against Kagiso Rabada in 21 balls at a strike-rate of 47.61. Nobody finishes cricket matches like him and yet again MS Dhoni 28* (13) shows why he is the best finisher. A four off the final ball to take @ChennaiIPL home. What a finish! #TATAIPL #MIvCSK pic.twitter.com/oAFOOi5uyJ — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 21, 2022 MS Dhoni vs Punjab Kings stats and records MS Dhoni has enjoyed batting against Punjab Kings in the past as well. Dhoni has scored 630 runs against Punjab Kings at an average of 48.46, whereas his strike-rate has been 147.88. He has scored five half-centuries against Punjab Kings in IPL history. The bowling of Punjab Kings has struggled this season, and the form of MS Dhoni can be an asset for Chennai Super Kings in the death overs.

It is the first time in the Indian's stellar career that he has got out on the opening ball twice in a row and has scored just 119 runs in eight matches this season for Royal Challengers Bangalore. Pictures of \"King Kohli\" talking to West Indian great and Sunrisers Hyderabad batting coach Brian Lara went viral on social media after Bangalore's big loss on Saturday, when they crashed out for 68. Fans reacted with excitement to the picture of two greats in one frame, with many believing the talk would help turn around Kohli's form in the ongoing Twenty20 tournament. Former Bangalore captain and coach Daniel Vettori feels that the 33-year-old Kohli, who will likely next play on Tuesday against Rajasthan Royals, will eventually strike form again. \"People talk about him being mentally fatigued, but I think he's better than that, I think he's bigger than that,\" Vettori told ESPNcricinfo. \"I think he'll find a way to battle through it and the way is through that aggressive nature.\" The former New Zealand skipper said that Kohli should go back to his roots. \"I think this is the time when he'd turn to his friends, his closest confidantes and maybe a mentor from when he was young,\" said Vettori. \"I think space is the key, and understanding and respect for him as a player,\" he added. Kohli, one of the best batsmen of the modern game and often the standard-bearer for Indian cricket, got out first ball to Lucknow Super Giants pace bowler Dushmantha Chameera and then fell to Hyderabad left-arm quick Marco Jansen . Jansen, a 21-year-old South African who had caught Kohli's attention as a net bowler back in 2018 in South Africa, got his prized scalp with a fuller-angled delivery that got the batsman caught at second slip. \"If a batsman has played even half a dozen deliveries, you notice whether his foot is moving or his batting is not coming right,\" batting great Sunil Gavaskar said on Star Sports. \"But when a batsman gets out on the first ball, I think it's just the anxiety.\" The slide Kohli's successive golden ducks have made headlines, but statistics suggest his problems go deeper than that. His miserable run with the bat has coincided with him stepping down as captain of India in T20 and Test cricket, and also being removed as ODI skipper, all in the last seven months. He has failed to score a century in over 100 matches in all formats. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen said it was only a matter of time until Kohli is back to his prolific best. \"You want a fact? Every single great of our game has been through what Virat is going through,\" Pietersen tweeted. \"Want another fact? They all get through it and deliver on the big stage again.\" Bangalore retained Kohli, who stepped down as captain of the franchise, last year for nearly $2 million but it was a pay cut for the star player who previously had the biggest IPL annual salary of $2.7 million. Former India coach Ravi Shastri believes that Kohli is \"overcooked\" because of so much cricket and should be given a break to relieve his \"fried brain\". Promoted Kohli has played 101 Tests, 260 one-day internationals and 97 Twenty20 matches for India since 2008, during which time he has amassed 23,650 runs across the three formats including 70 centuries. He is still searching for a first IPL title with RCB.","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-04/a30k4mes_virat-kohli_625x300_23_April_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Boria Majumdar Found Guilty In Wriddhiman Saha Text Case, Likely To Face Two-Year Ban","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports/cricket/boria-majumdar-found-guilty-in-wriddhiman-saha-text-case-likely-to-face-two-year-ban-589137","keywords":["Breaking News,Sports,Feature,News Ticker,Cricket"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"According to the BCCI official, Saha eventually identified Majumdar as the journalist in question when he came in front of the committee.","content":"New Delhi: Senior cricket journalist Boria Majumdar has been found guilty in the Indian senior wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha text case following which he is likely to face a two-year ban from covering matches.

While the BCCI haven’t tinkered with the dates of five matches, the same is not the case with venues. Initially, Chennai, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Rajkot and Delhi were scheduled to host the five T20Is respectively. While Cuttack and Vizag have replaced Chennai and Nagpur in the refurbished fixtures, matches for the remaining venues (baring Rajkot) have also been changed. It is noteworthy that India and South Africa will be locking horns in the shortest format after almost three years.

While Cuttack and Vizag have replaced Chennai and Nagpur in the refurbished fixtures, matches for the remaining venues (baring Rajkot) have also been changed. It is noteworthy that India and South Africa will be locking horns in the shortest format after almost three years. Although the two teams had played Tests and ODIs in South Africa earlier this year, they had last played a T20I series against each other in September 2019 in India. With IPL 2022 playoffs set to accommodate 100% crowd capacity in Kolkata and Ahmedabad next month, India vs South Africa T20I series in June should also be able to do the same provided COVID-19 cases don’t increase in the country. As far as the tickets are concerned, they haven’t been made available for general public for now. In fact, fans are unlikely to book tickets for this series before June. If truth be told, it would be a surprise if the process starts before the completion of IPL 2022 on May 29. Having said that, we will update interested fans about the detailed ticket booking process for this series as and when they are made available. June 9 – 1st T20I in Delhi June 12 – 2nd T20I in Cuttack June 14 – 3rd T20I in Vizag June 17 – 4th T20I in Rajkot June 19 – 5th T20I in Bengaluru","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"KL Rahul Becomes First Player To Score Three centuries Against Same Opponent In IPL","link":"https://www.sentinelassam.com/sports-news/kl-rahul-becomes-first-player-to-score-three-centuries-against-same-opponent-in-ipl-589129","keywords":["Breaking News,Sports,Feature,News Ticker"],"creator":["Sentinel Digital Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Rahul had scored an unbeaten 103 runs with the help of 9 fours and 5 sixes, against Mumbai at Brabourne stadium.
