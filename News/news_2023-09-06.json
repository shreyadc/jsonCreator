Despite reaching so close to a memorable win, Afghanistan eventually lost against Sri Lanka by two runs at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. In a must-win game, Afghanistan lost the toss and were asked to bowl first. Because of the net run rate condition in the Asia Cup 2023 points table, Afghanistan had to chase whatever target set by Sri Lanka in around 36-37 overs. When Sri Lanka posted 291/8 in 50 overs, the equation revealed was 292 in 37.1 overs for Afghanistan to qualify. Mohammad Nabi's whirlwind knock and cameos from Rashid Khan , Najibullah Zadran and Karim Janat brought the equation down to three runs off one ball. Mujeeb ur Rahman was on strike on the first ball of the 38th ball. He ended up handing a catch to Sadeera Samarwickrama off Dhananjaya de Silva's bowling. Afghanistan could still have qualified for the Super Fours had they reached 295 before 38.2 overs. However, Rashid Khan and Fazalhaq Farooqi probably were not aware of the condition. Farooqi got out for a three-ball duck as Afghanistan lost the game by two runs. Sri Lanka have qualified for the Asia Cup 2023 Super Fours round, thanks to their win against Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Afghanistan finished third in the Asia Cup 2023 points table for Group A. Group A matches ended yesterday with a clash between India and Nepal. The Men in Blue grabbed the second spot with a 10-wicket win over Nepal in a do-or-die match. Pakistan had already qualified for the Super Fours.

Arsenal striker Nketiah has endured a remarkable football journey from being released by Chelsea as a 14-year-old to now being called up by England. It is a rich reward for Nketiah’s form for Arsenal but also never giving up and being inspired by one of his heroes as it was Henry who gave him the belief he could make it at the top level. Nketiah, 24, who was given his first senior call-up for the double header with Ukraine and Scotland , said: “I think at a young age, 14, I had to deal with a big setback, it makes you resilient, I know what it feels to be at the bottom and be out and I don’t want to be back there. Premier League give fans chance to hear VAR after Arsenal and Man Utd incidents Transfer news live - Salah's new Saudi bid plus Man Utd star leaves club “I was there from the ages of nine and 14 and it came as a shock to me because I was doing well at the time. Obviously Declan Rice was of that age group as well and had a similar experience. “I’m able to dig a level deeper than maybe some people can or don’t want to go into. It’s all part of the experience. Some boys might not have experienced it but then they will have had lows in their careers. This was my journey and it has helped me by who I am today. “We all have talent but what separates you is our mentality and how much I want it so I always try to keep that with me wherever I go and whatever level and that is really helpful. Eddie Nketiah has been called up to the England senior squad ( Image: Getty Images) “Theirry has been magnificent for me, I was able to be coached by him as a first-year scholar at 16, it was amazing, one of my best and most enjoyable seasons. “He came in and saw the quality I had when I was 16 or 17 and said that I just needed to believe in myself whatever anyone else said. That is what is going to drive you, to motivate you. That’s probably one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever received. “I was able to bounce ideas off him and he gave me a lot of confidence and still to this day when I see him he is still supportive and still really helpful. He told me to believe in myself.” Watch football, F1, golf, tennis, cricket and more Get all the sport you could ever ask for Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C ricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL, NBA and more across eight dedicated channels.

However, Nketiah - who is England under-21s record scorer - grew up as an Arsenal fan and was not afraid of wearing the No14 shirt which Henry wore during his glory days as the club’s greatest ever goalscorer. Nketiah said: “I think 14 has always been a number that I have liked. I wore it when I was on loan at Leeds as well. “Obviously Thierry wearing it has made it a lot more special. When the number was available and offered to me, it was something that I embraced. I’m not here to try and recreate Thierry’s moments. I’m here to put my own stamp on it and create my own special memories in the shirt. Eddie Nketiah could make his England senior debut on Saturday ( Image: Getty Images) “I think that it has been a good start and I’m looking forward to the future. I know what that number means to Arsenal fans and so I try to go out and give it my all on the pitch.” Now Nketiah is focusing on England and also being able to play a part and stake his claims for a place in the Euros squad next summer. He added: “I think it is a target for all of us, once you get here you want to stay here and be here consistently. It is going to give me that extra motivation during the year. I have to focus on the games coming up and get qualified first and doing well for my club can help me get where I want to get to.

This comes after Walter only picked one all-rounder, Marco Jansen, in his 15-man group for next month's Cricket World Cup in India. The Proteas side-stepped experienced Wayne Parnell, who continues his recovery from a left shoulder injury. Skipper Bavuma will lead the side and is one of the eight players who've received their maiden World Cup call-ups. With only one all-rounder selected, South Africa's lower-order batting depth has been put into question. \"We've got a backup batter in the group,\" Walter told reporters in Bloemfontein on Tuesday. \"I back all of them, they're very versatile as well. If someone was knocked out through injury, then we certainly have the replacements to come into India. \"I didn't feel that we needed to carry an extra batter in the squad at the expense of the team.\" Bavuma says that the Proteas top order is not concerned about the lower-order's inability to bat. \"I don't think it'll curtail us as batters,\" said Bavuma. \"It's something we are aware of as a team but I think maybe it just calls out on a bit of smartness from us. \"In approaching the games as batters, it will all be the same. We're always looking to be positive. We're always looking for opportunities to turn the game into our favour, to back our skill and game sense and do that consistently over a period.\" READ | Rookie Coetzee only surprise as Proteas name 2023 Cricket World Cup squad Walter hopes to bring seamer Sisanda Magala's batting prowess to the fore and hinted at moulding fast bowler Gerald Coetzee into a potential all-rounder. \"The number seven spot is key in 50-over cricket. For me, it's assessing what the combined capabilities of seven, eight and nine, and their capability with the bat,\" said Walter. \"If I look at Marco, we've seen him play some pivotal knocks at number seven already and he's only getting better. \"Sisanda's capability is sometimes undervalued. He's done it for the Lions time and time again, and under pressure. That's something that we've been working tirelessly on, is his batting capability. \"You also got guys like Gerald, you saw a little bit of it in the T20s and he's got a great understanding of what the game requires from him,\" he continued. \"He's got a really good skill set and certainly, he's someone who will be looking to grow from an all-round capability point of view. \"We've put a huge amount of emphasis on their batting and ability to contribute at the back end of our batting line-up. \"If you've got those guys that can bat down to number nine or 10, it certainly lengthens the batting line-up significantly.\" The Proteas make their final preparations for the World Cup with a five-match ODI series against Australia, starting on Thursday in Bloemfontein.

Afghanistan was poised to knock Sri Lanka out of the tournament on net run-rate as it needed to achieve a 292-run target in 37.1 to advance from Group B with Bangladesh. Mohammad Nabi increased Afghan hopes with a blistering 65 off 32 balls as he raised his country's fastest half-century off 24 balls before he fell in the 27th over when Dhananjaya de Silva made a brilliant running catch in the outfield. Karim Jannat (22), Najibullah Zadran (23) and Rashid Khan (27 not out) kept pushing on Sri Lanka pace and spin with little cameos before Mujeeb Ur Rahman holed out at long on as Afghanistan slumped to 289-9 in 37.1 overs. Afghanistan apparently was unaware of the calculation that it could still make it to the Super 4 had they reached 295 over the next three balls. No. 11 batter Fazalhaq Farooqi defended the next two balls of part-time spinner de Silva before getting trapped lbw off the next ball that left Rashid stranded at the non-striker's end and Afghanistan was bowled out for 289 in 37.4 overs. Nabi showed plenty of aggression against the pace of Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana by hitting five sixes and six boundaries in his knock before he finally holed out with Afghanistan still needing 91 runs for victory. Fast bowler Kasun Rajitha picked up 4-79, that included two early wickets, but the fast bowler went for plenty against Afghan batters, who kept Sri Lanka bowlers under pressure with aggressive shots. \"Very disappointed about it,\" said Hashmatullah Shahidi, who also scored 59 off 66 balls. \"We fought well (and) we gave our 100 percent. I am proud of the team, the way they played and fought till the last ball.\" Earlier, Kusal Mendis missed out on a century but his 92 off 84 balls and a half-century stand between Dunith Wellalage (33 not out) and Maheesh Theekshana (28) farmed Sri Lanka's total of 291-8 after captain Dasun Shanaka won the toss and elected to bat. Pathum Nissanka (41) and Dimuth Karunaratne (32) provided a solid start of 63 before Gulbadin Naib's (4-60) triple strike during his seven-over spell in hot and humid weather of Lahore reduced Sri Lanka to 86-3. But Mendis rebuild the innings in a 102-run stand with Charith Asalanka (36) before Rashid had the latter caught off his own bowling and de Silva was clean bowled by Mujeeb. Mendis was unfortunate to miss out on the century when he was run out after Rashid dropped Shanaka off his own bowling but the ball rolled back onto the stumps at the non striker's end with Mendis well short of his crease. Wellalage and Theekshana then combined in a 54-run eighth wicket stand and edged closer to the 300-run mark. \"A couple of wickets opened the door for us,\" Shanaka said. \"Nabi took the game away from us. However, we ended up winning, that's what is important.\" Pakistan will take on Bangladesh in the first Super 4 game at Lahore on Wednesday before the tournament moves to Sri Lanka for the remaining five Super 4 games and the final scheduled for September 17.","pubDate":"2023-09-05 20:14:40","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11814770/41d1df259678c57f811c5dfec8522053417571fc-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"849702419d494a97905c13e2636835c4","title":"New Zealand beat England by six wickets, tie T20 series","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/bairstow-leads-england-to-175-against-nz-c-11814573","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"A quickfire 73 from Jonny Bairstow was not enough for England in the fourth T20 against New Zealand, with a six-wicket win earning the Black Caps a series draw.","content":"New Zealand have beaten England by a comfortable six wickets at Trent Bridge, with Tim Seifert hitting 48 and Glenn Phillips adding 42, to level the four-match Twenty20 International series 2-2.

The Black Caps completed the chase with ease, always ahead as they finished on 4-179 with 2.4 overs to spare and Mark Chapman unbeaten on 40. England had won the first two matches, with New Zealand coming back strongly to end on level terms. \"We were far from our best in the first two games and the last two have been closer to what this side is about,\" Black Caps captain Tim Southee said. \"They got off to a great start tonight but we knew that if we kept taking wickets it was the best way to slow them down. We were trying to be smart and make them take aggressive options.\" Opener Seifert was caught and bowled by Rehan Ahmed after reaching 48 from 32 balls, and Phillips also fell to the 19-year-old leg spinner when he was caught by Sam Curran but it was all too late. \"We got a reasonable score but it wasn't enough because it was a good surface,\" said England captain Moeen Ali, standing in for the rested Jos Buttler - who then came on anyway when Bairstow suffered shoulder pain and did not field. \"They had a brilliant start with the bat too and then we couldn't wrestle it back.\" Bairstow had smashed four sixes into the crowd by the time England reached 50 in 4.3 overs, reaching his own half-century off 26 deliveries. England were 0-63 at the end of the powerplay on a promising wicket for batters but lost opener Will Jacks (16) two runs later when he was caught by wicketkeeper Seifert off spinner Ish Sodhi. Bairstow hit his sixth six of the evening to take England to 1-105 but was caught by Daryl Mitchell off Mitch Santner for 73 off 41 balls. Dawid Malan continued to pepper the boundary with three quick fours and England were 3-126 when Harry Brook lofted the ball high and was caught by Chapman for Sodhi's second wicket.

Despite reaching so close to a memorable win, Afghanistan eventually lost against Sri Lanka by two runs at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. In a must-win game, Afghanistan lost the toss and were asked to bowl first. Because of the net run rate condition in the Asia Cup 2023 points table, Afghanistan had to chase whatever target set by Sri Lanka in around 36-37 overs. When Sri Lanka posted 291/8 in 50 overs, the equation revealed was 292 in 37.1 overs for Afghanistan to qualify. Mohammad Nabi's whirlwind knock and cameos from Rashid Khan , Najibullah Zadran and Karim Janat brought the equation down to three runs off one ball. Mujeeb ur Rahman was on strike on the first ball of the 38th ball. He ended up handing a catch to Sadeera Samarwickrama off Dhananjaya de Silva's bowling. Afghanistan could still have qualified for the Super Fours had they reached 295 before 38.2 overs. However, Rashid Khan and Fazalhaq Farooqi probably were not aware of the condition. Farooqi got out for a three-ball duck as Afghanistan lost the game by two runs. Sri Lanka have qualified for the Asia Cup 2023 Super Fours round, thanks to their win against Afghanistan.

Arsenal striker Nketiah has endured a remarkable football journey from being released by Chelsea as a 14-year-old to now being called up by England. It is a rich reward for Nketiah’s form for Arsenal but also never giving up and being inspired by one of his heroes as it was Henry who gave him the belief he could make it at the top level. Nketiah, 24, who was given his first senior call-up for the double header with Ukraine and Scotland , said: “I think at a young age, 14, I had to deal with a big setback, it makes you resilient, I know what it feels to be at the bottom and be out and I don’t want to be back there.

Obviously Declan Rice was of that age group as well and had a similar experience. “I’m able to dig a level deeper than maybe some people can or don’t want to go into. It’s all part of the experience. Some boys might not have experienced it but then they will have had lows in their careers. This was my journey and it has helped me by who I am today. “We all have talent but what separates you is our mentality and how much I want it so I always try to keep that with me wherever I go and whatever level and that is really helpful. Eddie Nketiah has been called up to the England senior squad ( Image: Getty Images) “Theirry has been magnificent for me, I was able to be coached by him as a first-year scholar at 16, it was amazing, one of my best and most enjoyable seasons. “He came in and saw the quality I had when I was 16 or 17 and said that I just needed to believe in myself whatever anyone else said. That is what is going to drive you, to motivate you. That’s probably one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever received. “I was able to bounce ideas off him and he gave me a lot of confidence and still to this day when I see him he is still supportive and still really helpful. He told me to believe in myself.” Watch football, F1, golf, tennis, cricket and more Get all the sport you could ever ask for Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C ricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL, NBA and more across eight dedicated channels.

However, Nketiah - who is England under-21s record scorer - grew up as an Arsenal fan and was not afraid of wearing the No14 shirt which Henry wore during his glory days as the club’s greatest ever goalscorer. Nketiah said: “I think 14 has always been a number that I have liked. I wore it when I was on loan at Leeds as well. “Obviously Thierry wearing it has made it a lot more special. When the number was available and offered to me, it was something that I embraced. I’m not here to try and recreate Thierry’s moments. I’m here to put my own stamp on it and create my own special memories in the shirt. Eddie Nketiah could make his England senior debut on Saturday ( Image: Getty Images) “I think that it has been a good start and I’m looking forward to the future. I know what that number means to Arsenal fans and so I try to go out and give it my all on the pitch.” Now Nketiah is focusing on England and also being able to play a part and stake his claims for a place in the Euros squad next summer. He added: “I think it is a target for all of us, once you get here you want to stay here and be here consistently. It is going to give me that extra motivation during the year. I have to focus on the games coming up and get qualified first and doing well for my club can help me get where I want to get to. If I do the right things, hopefully I can be part of it.” Join our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

This comes after Walter only picked one all-rounder, Marco Jansen, in his 15-man group for next month's Cricket World Cup in India. The Proteas side-stepped experienced Wayne Parnell, who continues his recovery from a left shoulder injury. Skipper Bavuma will lead the side and is one of the eight players who've received their maiden World Cup call-ups. With only one all-rounder selected, South Africa's lower-order batting depth has been put into question. \"We've got a backup batter in the group,\" Walter told reporters in Bloemfontein on Tuesday. \"I back all of them, they're very versatile as well. If someone was knocked out through injury, then we certainly have the replacements to come into India. \"I didn't feel that we needed to carry an extra batter in the squad at the expense of the team.\" Bavuma says that the Proteas top order is not concerned about the lower-order's inability to bat. \"I don't think it'll curtail us as batters,\" said Bavuma. \"It's something we are aware of as a team but I think maybe it just calls out on a bit of smartness from us. \"In approaching the games as batters, it will all be the same. We're always looking to be positive. We're always looking for opportunities to turn the game into our favour, to back our skill and game sense and do that consistently over a period.\" READ | Rookie Coetzee only surprise as Proteas name 2023 Cricket World Cup squad Walter hopes to bring seamer Sisanda Magala's batting prowess to the fore and hinted at moulding fast bowler Gerald Coetzee into a potential all-rounder. \"The number seven spot is key in 50-over cricket. For me, it's assessing what the combined capabilities of seven, eight and nine, and their capability with the bat,\" said Walter. \"If I look at Marco, we've seen him play some pivotal knocks at number seven already and he's only getting better. \"Sisanda's capability is sometimes undervalued. He's done it for the Lions time and time again, and under pressure. That's something that we've been working tirelessly on, is his batting capability. \"You also got guys like Gerald, you saw a little bit of it in the T20s and he's got a great understanding of what the game requires from him,\" he continued. \"He's got a really good skill set and certainly, he's someone who will be looking to grow from an all-round capability point of view. \"We've put a huge amount of emphasis on their batting and ability to contribute at the back end of our batting line-up. \"If you've got those guys that can bat down to number nine or 10, it certainly lengthens the batting line-up significantly.\" The Proteas make their final preparations for the World Cup with a five-match ODI series against Australia, starting on Thursday in Bloemfontein.

Afghanistan was poised to knock Sri Lanka out of the tournament on net run-rate as it needed to achieve a 292-run target in 37.1 to advance from Group B with Bangladesh. Mohammad Nabi increased Afghan hopes with a blistering 65 off 32 balls as he raised his country's fastest half-century off 24 balls before he fell in the 27th over when Dhananjaya de Silva made a brilliant running catch in the outfield. Karim Jannat (22), Najibullah Zadran (23) and Rashid Khan (27 not out) kept pushing on Sri Lanka pace and spin with little cameos before Mujeeb Ur Rahman holed out at long on as Afghanistan slumped to 289-9 in 37.1 overs. Afghanistan apparently was unaware of the calculation that it could still make it to the Super 4 had they reached 295 over the next three balls. No. 11 batter Fazalhaq Farooqi defended the next two balls of part-time spinner de Silva before getting trapped lbw off the next ball that left Rashid stranded at the non-striker's end and Afghanistan was bowled out for 289 in 37.4 overs. Nabi showed plenty of aggression against the pace of Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana by hitting five sixes and six boundaries in his knock before he finally holed out with Afghanistan still needing 91 runs for victory. Fast bowler Kasun Rajitha picked up 4-79, that included two early wickets, but the fast bowler went for plenty against Afghan batters, who kept Sri Lanka bowlers under pressure with aggressive shots. \"Very disappointed about it,\" said Hashmatullah Shahidi, who also scored 59 off 66 balls. \"We fought well (and) we gave our 100 percent. I am proud of the team, the way they played and fought till the last ball.\" Earlier, Kusal Mendis missed out on a century but his 92 off 84 balls and a half-century stand between Dunith Wellalage (33 not out) and Maheesh Theekshana (28) farmed Sri Lanka's total of 291-8 after captain Dasun Shanaka won the toss and elected to bat. Pathum Nissanka (41) and Dimuth Karunaratne (32) provided a solid start of 63 before Gulbadin Naib's (4-60) triple strike during his seven-over spell in hot and humid weather of Lahore reduced Sri Lanka to 86-3. But Mendis rebuild the innings in a 102-run stand with Charith Asalanka (36) before Rashid had the latter caught off his own bowling and de Silva was clean bowled by Mujeeb.

Curran (five) was caught by Finn Allen off Rachin Ravindra and England were 6-150, with Ahmed (11) run out in the last over on his home debut and Liam Livingston (26) caught on the final ball.

Mujeeb ur Rahman was on strike on the first ball of the 38th ball. He ended up handing a catch to Sadeera Samarwickrama off Dhananjaya de Silva's bowling. Afghanistan could still have qualified for the Super Fours had they reached 295 before 38.2 overs. However, Rashid Khan and Fazalhaq Farooqi probably were not aware of the condition.

Arsenal striker Nketiah has endured a remarkable football journey from being released by Chelsea as a 14-year-old to now being called up by England. It is a rich reward for Nketiah’s form for Arsenal but also never giving up and being inspired by one of his heroes as it was Henry who gave him the belief he could make it at the top level. Nketiah, 24, who was given his first senior call-up for the double header with Ukraine and Scotland , said: “I think at a young age, 14, I had to deal with a big setback, it makes you resilient, I know what it feels to be at the bottom and be out and I don’t want to be back there.

Obviously Declan Rice was of that age group as well and had a similar experience. “I’m able to dig a level deeper than maybe some people can or don’t want to go into. It’s all part of the experience. Some boys might not have experienced it but then they will have had lows in their careers. This was my journey and it has helped me by who I am today. “We all have talent but what separates you is our mentality and how much I want it so I always try to keep that with me wherever I go and whatever level and that is really helpful. Eddie Nketiah has been called up to the England senior squad ( Image: Getty Images) “Theirry has been magnificent for me, I was able to be coached by him as a first-year scholar at 16, it was amazing, one of my best and most enjoyable seasons. “He came in and saw the quality I had when I was 16 or 17 and said that I just needed to believe in myself whatever anyone else said. That is what is going to drive you, to motivate you. That’s probably one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever received. “I was able to bounce ideas off him and he gave me a lot of confidence and still to this day when I see him he is still supportive and still really helpful. He told me to believe in myself.” Watch football, F1, golf, tennis, cricket and more Get all the sport you could ever ask for Sky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to C ricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL, NBA and more across eight dedicated channels.

However, Nketiah - who is England under-21s record scorer - grew up as an Arsenal fan and was not afraid of wearing the No14 shirt which Henry wore during his glory days as the club’s greatest ever goalscorer. Nketiah said: “I think 14 has always been a number that I have liked. I wore it when I was on loan at Leeds as well. “Obviously Thierry wearing it has made it a lot more special. When the number was available and offered to me, it was something that I embraced. I’m not here to try and recreate Thierry’s moments. I’m here to put my own stamp on it and create my own special memories in the shirt. Eddie Nketiah could make his England senior debut on Saturday ( Image: Getty Images) “I think that it has been a good start and I’m looking forward to the future. I know what that number means to Arsenal fans and so I try to go out and give it my all on the pitch.” Now Nketiah is focusing on England and also being able to play a part and stake his claims for a place in the Euros squad next summer. He added: “I think it is a target for all of us, once you get here you want to stay here and be here consistently. It is going to give me that extra motivation during the year. I have to focus on the games coming up and get qualified first and doing well for my club can help me get where I want to get to. If I do the right things, hopefully I can be part of it.” Join our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Proteas side-stepped experienced Wayne Parnell, who continues his recovery from a left shoulder injury. Skipper Bavuma will lead the side and is one of the eight players who've received their maiden World Cup call-ups. With only one all-rounder selected, South Africa's lower-order batting depth has been put into question. \"We've got a backup batter in the group,\" Walter told reporters in Bloemfontein on Tuesday. \"I back all of them, they're very versatile as well. If someone was knocked out through injury, then we certainly have the replacements to come into India. \"I didn't feel that we needed to carry an extra batter in the squad at the expense of the team.\" Bavuma says that the Proteas top order is not concerned about the lower-order's inability to bat. \"I don't think it'll curtail us as batters,\" said Bavuma. \"It's something we are aware of as a team but I think maybe it just calls out on a bit of smartness from us. \"In approaching the games as batters, it will all be the same.

For me, it's assessing what the combined capabilities of seven, eight and nine, and their capability with the bat,\" said Walter. \"If I look at Marco, we've seen him play some pivotal knocks at number seven already and he's only getting better. \"Sisanda's capability is sometimes undervalued. He's done it for the Lions time and time again, and under pressure. That's something that we've been working tirelessly on, is his batting capability. \"You also got guys like Gerald, you saw a little bit of it in the T20s and he's got a great understanding of what the game requires from him,\" he continued. \"He's got a really good skill set and certainly, he's someone who will be looking to grow from an all-round capability point of view. \"We've put a huge amount of emphasis on their batting and ability to contribute at the back end of our batting line-up. \"If you've got those guys that can bat down to number nine or 10, it certainly lengthens the batting line-up significantly.\" The Proteas make their final preparations for the World Cup with a five-match ODI series against Australia, starting on Thursday in Bloemfontein.

Karim Jannat (22), Najibullah Zadran (23) and Rashid Khan (27 not out) kept pushing on Sri Lanka pace and spin with little cameos before Mujeeb Ur Rahman holed out at long on as Afghanistan slumped to 289-9 in 37.1 overs. Afghanistan apparently was unaware of the calculation that it could still make it to the Super 4 had they reached 295 over the next three balls. No. 11 batter Fazalhaq Farooqi defended the next two balls of part-time spinner de Silva before getting trapped lbw off the next ball that left Rashid stranded at the non-striker's end and Afghanistan was bowled out for 289 in 37.4 overs. Nabi showed plenty of aggression against the pace of Matheesha Pathirana and Maheesh Theekshana by hitting five sixes and six boundaries in his knock before he finally holed out with Afghanistan still needing 91 runs for victory. Fast bowler Kasun Rajitha picked up 4-79, that included two early wickets, but the fast bowler went for plenty against Afghan batters, who kept Sri Lanka bowlers under pressure with aggressive shots. \"Very disappointed about it,\" said Hashmatullah Shahidi, who also scored 59 off 66 balls. \"We fought well (and) we gave our 100 percent. I am proud of the team, the way they played and fought till the last ball.\" Earlier, Kusal Mendis missed out on a century but his 92 off 84 balls and a half-century stand between Dunith Wellalage (33 not out) and Maheesh Theekshana (28) farmed Sri Lanka's total of 291-8 after captain Dasun Shanaka won the toss and elected to bat. Pathum Nissanka (41) and Dimuth Karunaratne (32) provided a solid start of 63 before Gulbadin Naib's (4-60) triple strike during his seven-over spell in hot and humid weather of Lahore reduced Sri Lanka to 86-3. But Mendis rebuild the innings in a 102-run stand with Charith Asalanka (36) before Rashid had the latter caught off his own bowling and de Silva was clean bowled by Mujeeb. Mendis was unfortunate to miss out on the century when he was run out after Rashid dropped Shanaka off his own bowling but the ball rolled back onto the stumps at the non striker's end with Mendis well short of his crease. Wellalage and Theekshana then combined in a 54-run eighth wicket stand and edged closer to the 300-run mark. \"A couple of wickets opened the door for us,\" Shanaka said. \"Nabi took the game away from us. However, we ended up winning, that's what is important.\" Pakistan will take on Bangladesh in the first Super 4 game at Lahore on Wednesday before the tournament moves to Sri Lanka for the remaining five Super 4 games and the final scheduled for September 17.","pubDate":"2023-09-05 20:14:40","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11814770/41d1df259678c57f811c5dfec8522053417571fc-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"849702419d494a97905c13e2636835c4","title":"New Zealand beat England by six wickets, tie T20 series","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/bairstow-leads-england-to-175-against-nz-c-11814573","keywords":null,"creator":["Staff Writers"],"video_url":null,"description":"A quickfire 73 from Jonny Bairstow was not enough for England in the fourth T20 against New Zealand, with a six-wicket win earning the Black Caps a series draw.","content":"New Zealand have beaten England by a comfortable six wickets at Trent Bridge, with Tim Seifert hitting 48 and Glenn Phillips adding 42, to level the four-match Twenty20 International series 2-2. England's Jonny Bairstow (73) had hit his fastest T20I half-century as the hosts set New Zealand reached 8-175 on a warm evening in Nottingham. The Black Caps completed the chase with ease, always ahead as they finished on 4-179 with 2.4 overs to spare and Mark Chapman unbeaten on 40. England had won the first two matches, with New Zealand coming back strongly to end on level terms. \"We were far from our best in the first two games and the last two have been closer to what this side is about,\" Black Caps captain Tim Southee said. \"They got off to a great start tonight but we knew that if we kept taking wickets it was the best way to slow them down. We were trying to be smart and make them take aggressive options.\" Opener Seifert was caught and bowled by Rehan Ahmed after reaching 48 from 32 balls, and Phillips also fell to the 19-year-old leg spinner when he was caught by Sam Curran but it was all too late. \"We got a reasonable score but it wasn't enough because it was a good surface,\" said England captain Moeen Ali, standing in for the rested Jos Buttler - who then came on anyway when Bairstow suffered shoulder pain and did not field. \"They had a brilliant start with the bat too and then we couldn't wrestle it back.\" Bairstow had smashed four sixes into the crowd by the time England reached 50 in 4.3 overs, reaching his own half-century off 26 deliveries. England were 0-63 at the end of the powerplay on a promising wicket for batters but lost opener Will Jacks (16) two runs later when he was caught by wicketkeeper Seifert off spinner Ish Sodhi. Bairstow hit his sixth six of the evening to take England to 1-105 but was caught by Daryl Mitchell off Mitch Santner for 73 off 41 balls. Dawid Malan continued to pepper the boundary with three quick fours and England were 3-126 when Harry Brook lofted the ball high and was caught by Chapman for Sodhi's second wicket. Santner took his tally to 3-30 from four overs when he had Malan (26) caught by a diving Kyle Jamieson and Moeen (one) caught by Phillips. Curran (five) was caught by Finn Allen off Rachin Ravindra and England were 6-150, with Ahmed (11) run out in the last over on his home debut and Liam Livingston (26) caught on the final ball. The two sides will meet again in Cardiff on Friday for the first of four one-day internationals with the World Cup in India only a month away.","pubDate":"2023-09-05 19:19:24","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-11814573/20fb3639b2f09b87e2a7c68f358b75d65acfbcf8-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","source_priority":49457,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"c6252ee470414b542c1bf7bc08320cc0","title":"Amitabh Bachchan receives special golden ticket to watch ICC World Cup","link":"https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/05-Sep-2023/amitabh-bachchan-receives-special-golden-ticket-to-watch-icc-world-cup","keywords":["Lifestyle, Sports"],"creator":["Web Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"Bollywood's living legend Amitabh Bachchan has been issued a special golden ticket to watch the ICC Cricket World Cup matches in India this year.","content":"Bollywood's living legend Amitabh Bachchan has been issued a special golden ticket to watch the ICC Cricket World Cup matches in India this year.
