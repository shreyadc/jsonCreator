While Paine’s resignation as captain , following the publication of a story about explicit texts and a photo he had shared with a Cricket Tasmania staffer in November 2017, was characterised as voluntary, he has outlined in his new book how he felt he was left with no choice. Tim Paine during his public resignation as Australian men’s Test captain in November 2021. Credit: Nine News “We did a phone link which included this person they’d hired from a public relations firm who’d apparently given advice to the board in the past,” Paine wrote in The Price Paid , released on Tuesday. “He said that he’d been in the newspaper game for many years and this was going to be huge and would not go away. “I found it very strange that this person, someone I’d never met and someone who did not work at Cricket Australia, took the lead in the call while Nick, the chief executive, took a back seat. The consultant then said that the best way to get ahead of the story was if I stood down as captain. “I was stunned by that, so was James [Henderson, Paine’s manager]. Who was this guy? What did he know about the circumstances? That was the first time anyone had mentioned me resigning as captain. There was no way I was doing that.” Paine then challenged Hockley over whether Cricket Australia was asking him to resign, but found the main advice was coming from the consultant. “Nick chimed in, saying how experienced this guy was and how he thought I should listen to his advice,” Paine wrote. “I said, ‘do you want me to resign as Test captain, Nick?’ He couldn’t give me a straight answer, or wouldn’t. He kept talking around in circles. “And this guy said, ‘if you resign as Test captain it will take the air out of it but if you stay on they are going to keep coming at you’. I think he said I wouldn’t last until Monday and I replied that I would if they backed me in. “I said to Nick, ‘you and the board know what’s happened, you have an integrity report that clears me of any wrongdoing to anybody and that it was a personal matter’. It was becoming obvious what Cricket Australia wanted me to do, but they didn’t have the courage to say it themselves, they were letting their hired consultant run the show.” While still on the call, Paine initially stated that he wanted to stick to plans agreed between Henderson and Cricket Australia’s former chief executive, James Sutherland, in 2018 that the governing body would back Paine if the story had become public. “Cricket Australia were going to back me in public if anything came out,” Paine recalled earlier in the book, “and my manager worked with then chief executive James Sutherland to prepare a statement if needed.” But Paine soon reflected that he had no other option but to resign. “I think I finished the call by saying, ‘I’ve had enough of this, I’m going to bed’. James [Henderson] rang me back immediately. ‘They’re not going to back me in, I’m done,’ I told him and then I lay awake the rest of the night,” Paine said. “I was so disappointed by this. I hadn’t seen it coming. It was obvious the board wanted me to resign and I had no option if they weren’t going to back me. “I felt they were driven by the need to protect their image, they’d got in someone to look after them and he’d decided that I had to be sacrificed to save them, they were hanging me out to dry. The board had met that night and it was clear to me that they wanted to cut and run. “I think that’s why they got Nick and the consultant to call me. There was a feeling that if I didn’t stand down, they’d stand me down. In the morning I told [my wife] Bonnie I was going to stand down as Test captain.” Cricket Australia and Hockley have been contacted for comment.

Paine made the explosive claims in his autobiography The Price Paid, with the former Test captain becoming the first player to lift the lid on the 2018 Cape Town Test in a tell-all book. Paine denies any suggestion of a team meeting around the plan for Cameron Bancroft to use sandpaper on the ball during the third Test of the series against South Africa. And he says he was stunned and his heart sank as replays showed Bancroft hiding the sandpaper in his pants before being spoken to by umpires. “I was thinking ‘what the fuck?’,” Paine wrote. “A sense of dread came over us all.” In a lengthy chapter on the 2018 tour, Paine alleged that ball tampering was commonplace in cricket and that it was the sport’s dirty little secret. But he conceded using sandpaper was “next level” and “shameful”, with traditional tampering usually via means such as throwing the ball into the ground. More than a cricket game: India v Pakistan felt like a post-Covid celebration for hard-hit diasporas | Kiran Gupta Read more Regardless, he alleges he saw a South African player pulling apart the seam of the ball in the following Test and says it left him furious. “I saw it happen in the fourth Test of that series,” Paine alleges in the book. “Think about that. After everything that had happened in Cape Town, after all the headlines and bans and carry on. “We went to the umpires about it, which might seem a bit poor, but we’d been slaughtered and were convinced they’d been up to it since the first Test.” Paine said it felt like Australia were being “provoked” throughout the series amid crowd abuse of players’ families with David Warner a particular target. Paine has regularly called for Warner’s lifetime leadership ban to be lifted, claiming Cricket Australia seized an opportunity to punish him after the previous year’s pay talks. And he admitted he felt as if the side had let the opener down before the Cape Town debacle. “I don’t know how [Warner] kept his cool in those situations and on reflection I feel the team let him down by not offering him more support,” Paine wrote. “I can see now he was masking a lot of pain and we should have known it.” Paine also revealed in the book that he felt abandoned and “hung out to dry” by Cricket Australia when explicit text messages that ultimately cost him the top job were on the verge of becoming public. Paine detailed how he “fell apart” following the scandal, lost weight and turned to gruelling runs as a form of self-punishment. The 37-year-old stood down as captain in November last year and took time away from the game after a 2017 text message exchange with a Cricket Tasmania colleague came to light. “I was prepared to cop the flak for what I did, but in my mind Cricket Australia had abandoned me and made it look like they thought I’d sexually harassed someone,” he wrote in the book. Paine was cleared of wrongdoing in relation to the text messages by a CA investigation in 2018 and maintains the exchange was consensual. Paine also laid bare the scars surrounding Justin Langer’s exit as Australia coach, labelling the handling of the matter as a disgrace, unprofessional and embarrassing.","pubDate":"2022-10-24 22:59:34","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ddb65104711e19b8f5488272170e48ef01e687f/0_132_4060_2437/master/4060.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2455e310d38dc2c5054aeb6c87771f33","source_id":"theguardian","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"TV ‘cover up’ kept tampering secret quiet","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/tim-paine-says-tv-cover-up-kept-south-africas-ball-tampering-secret-quiet/news-story/07172506ec75953146b5dc20c2b18dde","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tim Paine has sensationally claimed South Africa got away with blatant ball tampering just days after Australian cricket melted to the ground following the sandpapergate scandal.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-24 22:31:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-West Indies head coach Simmons steps down after T20 World Cup exit","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/10/25/cricket-west-indies-head-coach-simmons-steps-down-after-t20-world-cup-exit","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - West Indies head coach Phil Simmons has stepped down following the team's exit from the T20 World Cup in Australia, Cricket West Indies announced on Monday.

The Australian side sits in last spot in Group 1, and should net run rate decide the semi finalists, as it did 12 months ago, the home nation could find itself watching the knockout matches on television. All three of Australia's front-line quicks were expensive at the SCG, with Starc (0-36), ﻿Josh Hazlewood (2-41) and Pat Cummins (0-46) all leaking runs.

We seem to play it more conventionally than most. Our first-choice fast bowlers, Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins, are the same in Tests as they are in T20s. \"A lot of other sides have gone the other way. England have bowlers like Sam Curran and Reece Topley, who's just gone home, they've gone the other way.\" Taylor said England's bowling line-up reminds him of a baseball bullpen. \"England has﻿ a lot of different arms doing different things,\" he noted. \"A left-armer like Curran bowling change-ups, the pace of (Mark) Wood, spinners like (Adil) Rashid and Moeen (Ali). There's a lot of variety. \"I dare say that's something Australia will look at after this World Cup, because that's where I think T20 cricket is going. \"But, in a way, Australia has set its course.

Australia stuck with pace through the powerplay against New Zealand, with Adam Zampa not introduced until the seventh over, while Glenn Maxwell didn't bowl at all. Nine commentator Steve O'Keefe, who regularly bowls in the powerplay for the Sydney Sixers, ﻿understood the logic of holding Zampa back. \"﻿I think traditionally you go with a finger-spinner up front rather than a wrist-spinner,\" he told Wide World of Sports. \"I think Australia really wanted to make a statement with the fast bowlers. ﻿Hazlewood is the best T20 bowler in the world, and Starc sets the tone by trying to swing the ball. \"If it's going to move it's going to be early on. It didn't work against New Zealand obviously. \"I think if Australia had their time again, they may have looked at Ashton Agar in the team, because we saw how well (Mitchell) Santner and (Ish) Sodhi bowled in those conditions. \"But hindsight is a beautiful thing, and I can understand﻿ why they went the way they did.\" Despite the size of the mauling at the hands of New Zealand, Taylor is expecting the same 11 to take the field against Sri Lanka in Perth on Tuesday night.﻿ \"The only question mark I have is whether Australia needs Steve Smith in that side. For the match against Sri Lanka, I'd probably be picking the same side that played against New Zealand,\" he said. \"But I'm definitely not ruling Steve Smith out of a role later in the tournament.﻿ When they play England on Friday, maybe a slower pitch in Melbourne, Smith might be better suited in a role where you can just work the ball around, rather than just bash it. \"At the moment, Australia has gone the all-out attack option, and hope that a couple of them come off, but they might need a different approach at the MCG.\" O'Keefe concurred, also believing Australia will resist the urge to bring in Smith or Agar. \"My 11 for Perth doesn't change. I think Andrew McDonald and Aaron Finch will keep faith in that same 11 to get it done against Sri Lanka.\" For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here !","pubDate":"2022-10-24 21:32:57","image_url":"https://vms-network-images-prod.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2022/10/461817/pickerimage.jpg","source_id":"nine","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ex-Tiger hit 149kg, traded NRL dream for NFL","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/former-wests-tigers-junior-etuale-lui-gunning-for-place-in-nfl-the-mole/663172bc-5e65-4a45-a0f0-061dff4edebf","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"A giant former Wests Tigers junior is one of five young Aussies and Kiwis attempting to make a bold break into the NFL.","content":"A former Junior Kiwi and Wests Tiger is one of a group of five Aussies and New Zealanders attempting to make a bold break into the NFL .

Paine was Langer's captain in 22 of the 27 Tests he coached, with the pair's bond dating well back before they started their tenure together after the 2018 ball-tampering scandal. In his new book The Paid Price, Paine claims he could understand players' issues with Langer's intensity and said he'd tried to communicate with the coach throughout his time in charge that it was a bit too much. And while he made clear he did not necessarily align with those views of other players, Paine said he believed Langer had taken steps to change last summer. Those victories preceeded Langer being offered only a six-month extension last February, a deal he ultimately rejected and then resigned as coach. \"I watched the lead-up to this in my last year as captain, no issue consumed me like this one did,\" Paine wrote. \"And nobody will stop me believing JL was very, very poorly treated. \"Take the outcome out of it, that's not the point, the way that situation was managed was a disgrace, but not a surprise. \"A man tasked with rebuilding Australian cricket's reputation was hung out to dry.\" Paine's comments about Langer's exit are the most critical from any player during the coach's tenure towards CA. In doing so, he also questioned why CA publicly backed the coach last August following series losses in Bangladesh and West Indies without first speaking to players about their concerns. \"I have to admit I was taken by surprise,\" Paine said. \"Things were serious from where I was sitting but Cricket Australia just went and made a statement without speaking to us about it. \"You think they might have talked to us first and tried to find out what the concerns were.\" Paine then said he believed Langer was going to be offered a new two-year deal after the Ashes and World Cup success. \"And then the news came that they'd offered him a six-month contract. What the f**k?\" Paine wrote. \"To add to the insult, it had been dragged out. Time was wasted. \"I'll never back down from my opinion that it was poorly handled, embarrassing and unprofessional. \"I think they knew he wouldn't accept it and then they wouldn't have to sack him. It was the easy way out. \"It was upsetting to see a man who cared so much treated like that.

Start your free trial now > Marsh hints at unchanged Aussie side | 01:26 Writing in his newly-released autobiography, The Price Paid, Paine touched on a number of key chapters in his career, including the sexting scandal that saw him stand down as skipper . Paine also wrote extensively about the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town and one of his biggest regrets — that Cameron Bancroft, Steve Smith and David Warner had to cop the brunt of the scrutiny. While there have been suggestions the rest of the team must have been aware of the ball-tampering, Paine labelled such claims as “rubbish”. “Cricketers keep a lot to themselves, even in the happiest teams. Coaches and support staff do the same,” Paine wrote. “Everyone out there was shocked when they looked up on the big screen and saw Cameron Bancroft with a piece of sandpaper in his hand. I was stunned. We all were.” Paine wrote that he had heard about players “taping small pieces of sandpaper onto their fingers” in the past but that this was “next level”. ‘WE NOW KNOW’: Du Plessis makes stunning Sandpapergate claims, big call on Smith 'Impossible' - Kohli's best T20 knock? | 02:16 “It was a Test match and it was on the big screen and it looked terrible,” he added. “My heart sank, I was thinking, ‘What the f---?’ A sense of dread came over us all.” And that was just the start, with the key trio of Bancroft, Smith and Warner waiting to learn their fate, with Paine writing that the latter felt “abandoned” in the wake of the incident. “Steve and Cam were alone,” he wrote. “Things were tense and horrible. I think Davey felt abandoned and that nobody was looking out for him.” While Paine maintained that no other player knew of the ball-tampering he wrote that the team still should have taken shared responsibility given Warner’s role as ‘ball manager’ was to the benefit of the entire squad. “Everyone was a part of it to some degree — would it have worked out better for those three players if we had owned it as a team? I think it would have,” Paine wrote. Paine added that all three players “should have had more support”, although he wrote that Warner in particular faced increased scrutiny from fans in particular. David Warner came under intense scrutiny. (AAP Image/Brendan Esposito) Source: AAP “... One grub followed Dave up the race, yelling from a metre or two away after he’d just got out,” he wrote. “I don’t know how Bull kept his cool in those situations and on reflection I feel the team let him down by not offering him more support. He was turning up every day as if nothing was bothering him, but that’s Dave. I can see now he was making a lot of pain and we should have known it. I can only imagine what it was like to be going through that with your wife and little girls. “... For a while there he cut himself off from all of us and removed himself from the team WhatsApp group and I can understand that. The personal abuse was taking its toll before this, but things had gone from bad to worse. “On reflection all three of them should have had more support. Maybe we could have done more as a group or organisation, not enough people put themselves in their shoes.” Paine also went on to accuse South Africa of ball-tampering in the following Test match, claiming it was covered up by broadcasters at the ground. SHOCKING - Dreadful Dutch start 0-2 | 00:52 “I saw it happen in the fourth Test of that series,” Paine wrote. “Think about that. After everything that had happened in Cape Town, after all the headlines and bans and carry on. “I was standing at the bowlers’ end in the next Test when a shot came up on the screen of a South African player at mid-off having a huge crack at the ball. “The television director, who had played an active role in catching out Cam, immediately pulled the shot off the screen. “We went to the umpires about it, which might seem a bit poor, but we’d been slaughtered and were convinced they’d been up to it since the first Test. “But the footage got lost. As it would.”","pubDate":"2022-10-24 20:52:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Penrith to receive World Club Challenge gift","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/news-2022-penrith-panthers-set-to-host-world-club-challenge/1c84ecfb-520d-4c1d-b837-e0b345b23e83","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Penrith is on the verge of playing host to the World Club Challenge against Super League champions St Helens in 2023.","content":"Penrith is on the verge of playing host to the World Club Challenge against Super League champions St Helens in 2023.

Writing in his newly-released autobiography, The Price Paid, Paine opened up on the fallout from the sexting scandal last November , which resulted in him relinquishing his duties as captain. Although, as Paine writes, he only did so as he felt as if CA bosses had “held a gun” to his head after a “strange” conversation with chief executive Nick Hockley and an unnamed public relations consultant.

I found it very strange that this person, someone I’d never met and someone who did not work at Cricket Australia, took the lead in the call while Nick, the chief executive, took a back seat. “The consultant then said that the best way to get ahead of the story was if I stood down as captain. “I was stunned by that, so was James (Paine’s manager, James Henderson). “Who was this guy? What did he know about the circumstances? That was the first time anyone had mentioned me resigning as captain. There was no way I was doing that.” Paine and CA were both aware of the incident and the former Australian skipper was cleared of any wrongdoing by an investigation at the time. The 37-year-old also said and continues to maintain that the sexting exchange was consensual. Paine did open the book by conceding that his actions were selfish and not fair to wife Bonnie but still in his mind did not seriously consider standing down until the conversation with Hockley. Tim Paine felt let down. (AAP Image/Dan Himbrechts) Source: AAP “I knew what had happened,” Paine continues in the book. “Cricket Australia knew what had happened and in my mind this guy didn’t know, or worse than that, it was like he believed that I had sexually harassed her. “Then Nick chimed in, saying how experienced this guy was and how he thought I should listen to his advice. I said, ‘Do you want me to resign as Test captain, Nick?’ “He couldn’t give me a straight answer, or wouldn’t. He kept talking around in circles. “And this guy said, ‘If you resign as Test captain it will take the air out of it but if you stay on they are going to keep coming at you.’ I think he said I wouldn’t last until Monday and I replied that I would if they backed me in. “I said to Nick, ‘You and the board know what’s happened, you have an integrity report that clears me of any wrongdoing to anybody and that it was a personal matter.’ “It was becoming obvious what Cricket Australia wanted me to do but they didn’t have the courage to say it themselves, they were letting their hired consultant run the show. “They’d held a gun to my head. I couldn’t go on without their support.” Border begs for Smith return | 06:49 Paine added that there was a “feeling” that if he did not make the decision to stand down himself it would be done for him. “I felt they were driven by the need to protect their image, they’d got in someone to look after them and he’d decided that I had to be sacrificed to save them, they were hanging me out to dry,” he writes in the book. “The board had met that night and it was clear to me that they wanted to cut and run. I think that’s why they got Nick and the consultant to call me. “I was disappointed and I was tired of this. I was prepared to cop the flak for what I did, but in my mind Cricket Australia had abandoned me and made it look like they thought I’d sexually harassed someone and so everyone else would think that too. I felt like them flipping almost vindicated the story. “The thing that got me later was when Cricket Australia said they would have handled it differently to the way it was done back in 2017, but for that seven days or whatever it was, they were doing their level best to stop the story coming out. When it got out, they seemed to change their tune about it.” Tim Paine stepped down as Australian men's Test cricket captain after the scandal. Picture: Chris Kidd Source: Supplied While disappointed about the handling of the situation by CA, Paine also spoke of the “sickening” feeling he felt once he realised how his actions had impacted wife Bonnie and his family. “I never thought I wasn’t putting my wife and family first, but when I took a step back it is ridiculous that I couldn’t see how selfish I was, how much in my own bubble I was,” Paine told News Corp cricket journalist Peter Lalor last week . “I remember Bonnie saying something to me years ago and I was thinking, ‘What is she talking about? I’m a good husband, I do everything’, but I see now I was hopeless. I wasn’t a horrible person, but everything I did was centred around me and what I needed to do. And now I probably am – no, I am – completely the opposite. “I don’t know if I could play international cricket the way I am now, maybe I would be better, but I have always been the sort of person who thought they needed to be fully immersed, that’s the way I’ve done it. I didn’t know any other way.” “Initially, I was just concerned with losing cricket, but that soon became the least of my concerns. It was shocking. I’d be ­sitting at home thinking of the memories we’d had in it, about the kids and everything Bonnie and I had created, and to think I’d messed that up was horrible. “It was sickening and then it got to the point where I thought why bother even trying.”","pubDate":"2022-10-24 19:51:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Only Kohli could have hit those two sixes off Haris Rauf: Pandya","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/10/25/only-kohli-could-have-hit-those-two-sixes-off-haris-rauf-pandya/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["KR Desk"],"video_url":null,"description":"MELBOURNE: Hardik Pandya, one of the cleanest strikers in the game, feels only Virat Kohli could have come up with those two game-changing sixes off a seriously quick Haris Rauf in India’s T20 World Cup opener against Pakistan.

With 28 needed off the last 8 balls, India had a daunting task at hand but Kohli conjured up two strokes that will be spoken about for a long time. One was a straight-bat six over the bowler’s head and the next was a flick over fine-leg under extreme pressure. That brought down the equation to a very gettable 16 off the final over. India pulled off a famous win in the last ball of the game. Hardik, who was watching Kohli’s mastery from the other end, looked bacZ at those special sixes. “I’ve hit a lot of sixes but those are special, special, and really special in my heart now because of what (it) meant for both of us. I’ve played cricket, so much cricket, but I don’t think anyone could’ve played those two shots except Kohli,” Hardik told the BCCI website as he sat alongside Kohli. “The best part about what I loved about him (doing that) is we struggled, bro. Why it was so special was we struggled together. This would’ve been not this special if we had just cruised through. “You would have played exceptional shots, I would have been (in the flow)… This was special because we knew we’d struggled.” The star all-rounder also played a crucial role with bat and ball to bring back India from the dead. —PTI Only Kohli could have hit those two sixes off Haris Rauf: Pandya added by KR Desk on 1:18 am October 25, 2022 View all posts by KR Desk → KR Desk Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-10-24 19:48:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Masood’s lucky escape reignites debate over spidercam use in international cricket","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/10/25/masoods-lucky-escape-reignites-debate-over-spidercam-use-in-international-cricket/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Melbourne: Shan Masood had a lot of luck going his way on way to a fighting half-century at the MCG and on one such occasion, the Pakistani batter was rescued by the spidercam hovering over the field of play.

After Virat Kohli missed a regulation run out chance to dismiss Masood, the southpaw was caught in the deep by Ashwin but replays showed the ball had bounced before the Indian spinner collected it in his palms. He got another life in a bizarre fashion when Masood, beaten by Ashwin through the air, went for a big hit and the ball collided with the cable holding the spidercam. It could have been an easy catch in the deep by Kohli if the ball had not changed direction after coming in contact with the cable. The incident once again reignited the debate on the use of spidercam, which has been in use in cricket for more than 10 years. It was first used in the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2007 before being used in the 2010 Indian Premier League. The technology is also used regularly in ICC events. The game’s followers on social media were quick to comment on the incident that happened during a high pressure clash on Sunday with India winning it in the last ball. “Just realised, how lucky was shan masood yesterday. Survived a runout, ash miscalculated the catch, spider cam came at his service. Damnn lucky!!” tweeted a fan. To some of the followers, it was divine intervention. “It’s not the Spidercam it was the Qudrat ka Nizam who saved Shan Masood there,” another Twitter user wrote. In a nutshell, spidercam is a cable suspended camera system that allows cameras to move both vertically and horizontally over field of play. Masood ended up 52 off 42 balls that ensured Pakistan posted a fighting total after a shaky start. The technology has been questioned many times in the past including an India Australia Test in the 2014-2015 series. The Australian captain Steve Smith missed a catch as a camera cable allegedly came in his line of sight. Last over waist high no ball also divides opinions India needed 16 off the final to pull off a famous win over Pakistan on Sunday. Bowling the 20th over, left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz crumbled under pressure and bowled a no ball that Kohli dispatched for a six, tilting the game in India’s favour. Kohli was well within his right to check for a no ball and umpire Marais Erasmus took a while before deciding that it was a waist high full toss, sending the Pakistanis into panic mode. Pakistani fans expectedly thought that their team got the rough end of the stick. “Kohl did no wrong by checking with the umpires but the on field officials should have checked for the height with the third umpire. That is what technology is there for. You can use it when there is doubt,” Pakistan legend Wasim Akram told A Sports. —PTI Masood’s lucky escape reignites debate over spidercam use in international cricket added by Press Trust of India on 1:18 am October 25, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-10-24 19:48:09","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ganguly backs out, elder brother Snehasish set to lead CAB","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/10/25/ganguly-backs-out-elder-brother-snehasish-set-to-lead-cab/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Kolkata: Former BCCI president Sourav Ganguly on Sunday pulled out of the race to become the Cricket Association of Bengal’s next chief, paving the way for his elder brother Snehasish to be elected uncontested at its upcoming AGM on October 31. “I had said that I would contest only if there’s election.

There’s not going to be any election, so it will be uncontested,” Ganguly told reporters at Eden Gardens after he chose not to file his papers for the president’s post on the last date of nomination. Denied a second term at the Indian cricket board, the former BCCI president only a week back had announced that he’s all set to contest elections to return as the CAB chief. “Had I been there, it would have meant two or more people would not get any posts. So, I’ve moved aside,” Ganguly said. “I would have been elected uncontested, but I don’t think it’s right. Others would not have got the opportunity to work for this association. They will be working for these three years now and we will see after that.” Asked about his next innings, he said: “Let’s see. I’m free of responsibilities for some time now and I’m happy about it. “I’ve no rival in CAB, everyone is my friend here. There are new and experienced people here to run the show. I’ll also be around,” he added before leaving the Eden. Snehasish, who was the secretary under Avishek Dalmiya, will now run the show, while Amalendu Biswas, who is the father of Students Federation of India (SFI) leader Mayukh, will be appointed as the vice-president. Naresh Ojha will occupy the secretary’s chair, while Prabir Chakraborty and Debabrata Das will continue their second term as the treasurer and the joint-secretary respectively. Snehasish said his priority would be to take Bengal cricket to the “next level”. “Now that we are coming back to normal (after COVID-19) we are making sure cricket gets highest priority be it men’s or women’s or age group cricket,” he said. He further said the CAB has already started preparations for the ODI World Cup next year. “The lights have been upgraded to LED operating on advanced DMX technology. The setting up of new seats is on. Repair and construction of new canopies is underway. We also have plans of upgrading the club house.” —PTI Ganguly backs out, elder brother Snehasish set to lead CAB added by Press Trust of India on 1:17 am October 25, 2022 View all posts by Press Trust of India → Press Trust of India Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Related","pubDate":"2022-10-24 19:47:56","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘Gun to my head’: Paine breaks silence on brutal exit","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/tim-paine-breaks-silence-on-brutal-exit-as-australian-test-cricket-captain-in-new-book/news-story/2725406d9d919822ab06f9e3b499b08c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Tim Paine has claimed he was effectively sacked from the Test captaincy by a PR consultant, slamming Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley for not having the “courage” to do it himself.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-10-24 19:00:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Hooper opens up on mental health 'rollercoaster'","link":"https://wwos.nine.com.au/rugby/news-2022-wallabies-star-michael-hooper-speaks-after-mental-health-break/e060e8dd-1da2-436b-a822-2d32fdb7e846","keywords":null,"creator":["wwos"],"video_url":null,"description":"Put in the simplest terms, Michael Hooper just \"wasn't right\" as he made the shock call to leave the Wallabies.","content":"Put in the simplest terms, Michael Hooper just \"wasn't right.\" Now a 30-year-old family man, the Wallabies captain has much more on his plate than just making tackles and hitting rucks and, far away from home in Mendoza, the \"difficult\" yet \"straightforward\" call was made.

I am certain that over the years we will produce several Virat Kohli’s who will give so much pleasure to the Indian diaspora as he did yesterday. However, the game has evolved tremendously and T20 cricket has become a primary cricket entertainment source which in due course will attract several young aspirants to take up the sport in tight earnest. This being the case the domestic circuit will require a tweak in the scheduling and will result in prioritising this form over the traditional longer version and one day format. I am also a purist and still consider Test cricket in the international format as a priority. However, I am willing to concede that the game has evolved to a different level and instant results are the flavour of the day. As a cricket professional myself I would recommend some reforms even in the IPL formation of the teams. My recommendation would be to ensure mandatory city franchise local players participation in the playing eleven of city teams and a reduction of International players consequently. The above will bring about the true essence of city franchise and act as a catalyst to improve participation and thereby raise standards of local aspirants. This is the true reason why IPL format was envisaged by the Board more than a decade ago. A performance that we saw of a genius like Virat Kohli inspires millions to play the game. At the conclusion I cannot help but say ‘The game is greater than the individual’. Congratulations India for amazing team work and a brilliant start to the T20 World Cup in Australia.

In his autobiography, The Price Paid, Paine also detailed how he \"fell apart\" following the scandal, lost weight and turned to gruelling runs as a form of self-punishment. The 37-year-old stood down as captain in November last year and took time away from the game after a 2017 text message exchange with Cricket Tasmania colleague Renee Ferguson was aired. Paine describes a phone conversation with Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive Nick Hockley and an unnamed public relations consultant on the eve of the story being published. He said it became obvious that CA was no longer going to back him as captain. \"I felt they were driven by the need to protect their image ... they were hanging me out to dry,\" Paine wrote. Paine drafted a resignation letter the next morning and later fronted the media at a snap press conference in Hobart. \"I was prepared to cop the flak for what I did, but in my mind Cricket Australia had abandoned me and made it look like they thought I'd sexually harassed someone,\" he wrote in the book. Paine was cleared of wrongdoing in relation to the text messages by a CA investigation in 2018 and maintains the exchange was consensual. He became Test captain the same year after Steve Smith was stripped of the role over ball-tampering. The day after Paine announced his resignation, CA chair Richard Freudenstein told media the current board would not have endorsed him as captain following the investigation. \"The one thing that got me later was when Cricket Australia said that they would have handled it differently to the way it was done in 2017,\" Paine wrote. \"The reality was they were happy to defend me and accept I hadn't breached their code of conduct as long as it was kept private. \"If the story hadn't run, I would still be captain and if Cricket Australia had handled it like they said they would I would still be playing for Australia. \"For seven days they tried to quash the story and the only time it became different was when it was going to become public.\" Paine said he asked for a copy of the investigation integrity report but has never received one, and also asked for copies to be given to media. Paine took a break from the sport about a week after resigning as Test captain but has since returned to play Sheffield Shield cricket for Tasmania this season. He revealed he sought professional help for his mental health and felt so ashamed about what he had inflicted on wife Bonnie, his two children and family. \"I couldn't control my thoughts, it was shocking. No matter how many times I tried to pull myself together, my mind just fell apart,\" Paine wrote. \"I had some horrendous thoughts in that period. Like maybe it would be easier for people if I wasn't here.\" Ms Ferguson has taken legal action against Cricket Tasmania, alleging she was sexually harassed by several former colleagues.
