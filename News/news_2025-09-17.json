Asia Cup 2025, as the global cricket body has accepted the demand by the PCB.ICC replaced Andy Pycroft with Richi Richardson to supervise the match.PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi had held consultations with senior government officials earlier today to finalise the next course of action if ICC rejects the demand.If the demand had not been accepted, Pakistan would likely have withdrawn from the remainder of the Asia Cup matches.The situation remained tense the whole day, as the Pakistan team is scheduled to face the UAE in their final group-stage match, and the PCB was standing firm on its demand to remove Andy Pycroft.The PCB had maintained that Andy Pycroft’s conduct during the match against India was inappropriate and against the spirit of the game, particularly his instructions to skip the traditional handshake at the toss.In response, Pakistan had taken a strong stance, warning that it would not play any further matches in the Asia Cup if the match referee was not
