Followed categories will be added to My News. James McDonald has beaten Zac Purton at his own game. In October 2022, Purton famously told J-Mac he was “stupid” for staying in Australia and not chasing the riches on offer in Hong Kong. “At the end of the day when he looks at his bank account and he looks at my bank account, he’s stupid for staying in Australia,” Purton told SEN. • ‘We are humans, my heart bleeds’: Williams extends hand to Khawaja “He can stay (in Australia), win all the trophies, get all the accolades, and at the end of his career he’ll still have a mortgage on his home. It’s as simple as that. Financially it just doesn’t make sense. “You can make six to seven times comfortably (in Hong Kong) what he would make a year.” Well, McDonald has just had a taste of that life, completing a 37-day stint in the Asian racing mecca and pocketing more cash than the six-time Hong Kong champion over the same period. In Hong Kong, a jockey gets 10 per cent of the prizemoney for winning and 5 per cent for finishing second to sixth. McDonald’s 15 winners earned $HK35,296,800, meaning he trousered a total of $HK3,529,680 ($A664,137), the bulk of which came from Romantic Warrior ’s brave victory in the Group 1 Hong Kong Cup. Wunderbar caps a J-Mac treble! The star rider returns a three-timer on the final day of his short-term contract... ð¥ @mcacajamez #LuckyStart | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/awPyARiFiX — HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) January 1, 2024 In that same period, Purton had 19 winners ($HK29,439,600) but only snared himself $HK2,943,960 ($A553,883) because they were in lesser quality races. His Group 1 victory, the Hong Kong Sprint with Lucky Sweynesse , was worth significantly less than the Cup while 12 of the 19 came in Class Four or Class Five. In contrast, 11 of McDonald’s 15 successes came in Class Three or above. • Triumph, scandal and tragedy – the moments that shaped 2023 Across 12 meetings from November 26 to January 1, McDonald collected a grand total of $HK50,398,695 in prizemoney, his share a very healthy $HK4,284,774.75 ($A806,140). For the season so far, that $HK50,398,695 number is second only to Purton ($HK92,120,285) and ahead of the likes of Karis Teetan ($HK50,136,960), Vincent Ho ($HK49,963,165) and Hugh Bowman ($HK25,953,550). Not bad for 5½ weeks’ work – J-Mac certainly knows what Purton was talking about now. But Purton, as usual, will end up having the last laugh given the maximum tax rate in Hong Kong is 15 per cent while the Australian Taxation Office will take a much bigger bite out of McDonald’s earnings.

Warner's rollercoaster 112-Test career will come to an end at the SCG this week, with the veteran opener fulfilling his dream of a home farewell when Australia play Pakistan in the third Test. But amid the celebrations for Warner this week in a series that is already won, the biggest question that looms is who will replace him against West Indies in Adelaide on January 17. Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw remain the front-runners out of the specialist openers, but Australia are open to going outside that group. Coach Andrew McDonald left the door open earlier this week for Cameron Green to take on the job, if it allowed Australia to pick their best six batsmen. Another option would be to shift Travis Head, Marnus Labuschage or Mitch Marsh to the top, allowing Green to return to the side. The likes of Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer have each warned against such a move, while Bancroft has also voiced a case for a specialist to be selected. But Cummins said he would be open to a move from a regular middle-order batsman. \"Uzzy (Usman Khawaja) wasn't a specialist (opener) until it was basically the only spot available in the team and he forced his way in,\" Cummins, who has been involved in informal discussions on the looming selection, said. \"Ideally, you've got someone who's had experience opening, but I don't think it's a blanket rule.\" Cummins has some first-hand experience on the topic, as a Test quick who has taken the new ball against specialist openers and those filling in the role in opposition teams. \"I think every case is different,\" Cummins said. \"If someone's been picked in the side as an opener, but their record's not great, you feel probably feel more of a chance (to get their wicket), rather than if you're picking their best batter. \"I don't think it's a big deal. It's just a batting position, everyone chops and changes around a little bit.\" Cummins on Tuesday lauded Warner as Australia's best-ever three-format batter, and noted his absence will be felt as much off the field as on it. The 37-year-old will play in this year's T20 World Cup, and while he has retired from ODI cricket, Warner is open to a comeback in major 50-over tournaments if asked. Australia's captain indicated that would likely not be required, but was not wholly opposed to the idea of an uncontracted Warner returning. \"It's probably time to give some others a crack,\" Cummins said. \"But knowing he is still going to be playing cricket, it might be more of a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option. \"He's going to be scoring runs somewhere in the world, so you never know.\" Warner's retirement is the first from within the Test team since Mitchell Johnson's in late 2015. But many more loom in coming years with Labuschagne the only player from an unchanged XI for the Sydney Test aged under 30. Cummins is confident, however, the vast majority of the team will be able to face India next summer. \"Realistically there is going to be some rate of change,\" Cummins said. \"We probably thought it was going to happen a little bit sooner but everyone is hanging on. \"After this block of Test matches, we don't play again until next summer.

The veteran off-spinner achieved the feat during the first Test of the ongoing 3-match series against Pakistan in Perth in December 2023. Glenn McGrath, who will be in Sydney for the Pink Test from January 3, said he was confident that Nathan Lyon would go past his Test tally and he has no problems being overtaken by the veteran off-spinner. Lyon is in the third spot in Australia's all-time Test list with 505 wickets in 124 matches. McGrath had finished his career with 563 wickets in 124 Tests while the late Shane Warne had 708 Test wickets in 145 Tests. Lyon, 36, has shown no signs of slowing down and has been an integral member of the Australian Test side, both overseas and at home. Lyon's ability to trouble opposition batters with his off-spin on pitches in Australia that are not conducive for spin bowling has set him apart from the rest. “To me, records are there for people to break. If Lyono goes past (me), credit to him. He’s had an incredible career. I wish him all the best, I hope he goes past me. That’s what it’s about,\" McGrath said in Sydney as his foundation was preparing for the Pink Test, aimed at raising awareness about Breast Cancer and fundraising. \"I will still be the most wickets by a fast bowler, so at least I have got something up my sleeve,\" he added. The former Australian fast bowler did not rule out Nathan Lyon's chances of going past Shane Warné's tally, saying it would be completely up to the off-spinner to decide if he wanted to give that shot. Whether he gets to ‘Shano’, that might be a different kettle of fish. It is up to him. He is obviously bowling well, he knows the game so well. It is totally up to him,\" McGrath added. Lyon flaunted his commitment and passion for the game when he made an incredible recovery from a calf injury tha sidelined him for the second-half of the 2023 season. Lyon underwent a rigorous 13-week rehabilitation program to get fit in time for the series against Pakistan. Lyon has often spoken about his desire to prolong his career. After getting to 500, Lyon stressed the importance of not taking anything for granted and putting in the hard yards, day in and day out. “Nice to get back after the injury, I have not taken anything for granted, especially playing for Australia, appreciate every moment of my career,” he had said.","pubDate":"2024-01-02 03:36:54","image_url":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/nathan-lyon-043702-16x9.jpg?VersionId=r0BpJM3y49aaLI1JzjMlw3CLqGG3Xi.E","source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"1eeabd065af7b52206e02ce0a329d60f","title":"‘Unseen’ Video of Virat Kohli After Defeat in ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Final Against Australia Goes Viral","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/unseen-video-of-virat-kohli-after-defeat-in-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-against-australia-goes-viral-5664927.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli scored 765 runs from 11 matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and was the highest scorer of the competition.

(AFP) नई दिल्ली. क्रिकेट को हमारे देश में धर्म की तरह पूजा जाता है. यहां छोटे छोटे बच्चे गलियों में क्रिकेट खेलते हुए देखे जा सकते हैं. लोग खिलाड़ियों को भगवान की तरह पूजते हैं. इस खेल के बारे में लोग काफी कुछ जानते हैं लेकिन क्रिकेट में एक बल्लेबाज कितने तरीकों से आउट हो सकता है, शायद कम ही लोगों को पता हो. एक बल्लेबाज 11 अलग अलग तरीकों से आउट हो सकता है. इनमें कई ऐसे नियम हैं जिनके बारे में जानकर आप हैरान हो जाएंगे. भारत में आयोजित आईसीसी क्रिकेट वर्ल्ड कप 2023 में एक बल्लेबाज बिना कोई गेंद खेले पवेलियन लौट गया. इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट के 146 के इतिहास में ऐसा पहली बार हुआ था. क्रिकेट में बल्लेबाज के कैच आउट (Catch Out) होने से हम सभी वाकिफ हैं. यह बल्लेबाज के आउट होने का सामान्य तरीका है. जब गेंद बल्लेबाज के बल्ले से लगकर जमीन पर गिरने से पहले फील्डर की ओर से कैच कर लिया जाता है तो, बैटर आउट माना जाता है. ज्यादातर कैच विकेट के पीछे जाते हैं जहां विकेटकीपर लपकने में कोई कोर कसर नहीं छोड़ता. इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट में सबसे ज्यादा कैच लपकने का रिकॉर्ड श्रीलंका के दिग्गज विकेटकीपर कुमार संगकारा के नाम है जिन्होंने टेस्ट, वनडे और टी20 में मिलाकर इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट में कुल 440 कैच लपके हैं. बोल्ड, एलबीडब्ल्यू, रनआउट जब बॉलर गेंद को सीधा स्टंप पर मारता है और गिल्लियां नीचे गिर जाती हैं, उस स्थिति में बल्लेबाज को क्लीनबोल्ड (Bowled) आउट दिया जाता है. वहीं जब गेंदबाज गेंद डालता है और सामने वाला बल्लेबाज उसे शरीर से रोकने की कोशिश करता है और यदि उसका पैर स्टंप्स के सामने पाया जाता है तो वह एलीबीडब्ल्यू (LBW) आउट होता है. जब बल्लेबाज शॉट खेलने के बाद रन के लिए दौड़ रहा होता है और उस दौरान फील्डर गेंद को उठाकर बैटर के पहुंचने से पहले नॉन स्ट्राइक या स्ट्राइक एंड पर थ्रो कर गिल्लियां बिखेर देता है तो उस कंडीशन में बल्लेबाज को रन आउट (Run Out) दिया जाता है. स्टंपिंग, हिटविकेट, ऑब्स्ट्रकटिंग द फील्ड जब बल्लेबाज गेंद को हिट करने की कोशिश में स्टंप्स से बाहर निकलता और उसके बल्ले से गेंद का संपर्क नहीं होता है उस स्थति में यदि विकेटकीपर गेंद को पकड़कर गिल्लियां बिखेर दो तो बल्लेबाज स्टंप (Stumping) आउट हो जाता है. बल्लेबाज जब शॉट खेलता है और बल्ला या शरीर का कोई भी हिस्सा स्टंप्स पर लगकर यदि गिल्लियां नीचे गिर जाती हैं, उस स्थिति में बैटर को हिटविकेट (Hit Wicket) आउट माना जाता है. जब कोई बल्लेबाज फील्डिंग करने वाली टीम को गेंद को पकड़ने में बाधा पहुंचाता है तब वह ऑब्स्ट्रकटिंग द फील्ड (Obstructing the Field) आउट करार दिया जाता है. गेंदबाज के गेंद फेंके बिना नॉन स्ट्राइकर एंड पर बल्लेबाज रन के लिए क्रीज से बाहर निकल जाए और बॉलर गेंद को स्टंप्स पर मारकर बैटर के खिलाफ मांकडिंग (Mankading) आउट की अपील कर सकता है. उस दौरान बल्लेबाज यदि क्रीज से बाहर पाया जाता है तो उसे पवेलियन लौटना होगा. टाइम आउट, रिटायर्ड आउट बल्लेबाज यदि दूसरी बार गेंद को को जानबूझकर मारने की कोशिश करता है तो उसे आउट करार दिया जाता है. जैसे कि गेंद यदि बल्लेबाज के बल्ले, शरीर या किसी अन्य उपकरण पर लगा हो और वह जानबूझकर फिर गेंद को मारने की कोशिश करता है तो उसे आउट दे दिया जाता है. हाल में भारत में खेले गए विश्व कप मैच में श्रीलंका के ऑलराउंडर एंजोलो मैथ्यूज को टाइम आउट करार दिया गया. विकेट गिरने के बाद यदि कोई बल्लेबाज तीन मिनट के भीतर क्रीज पर नहीं पहुंचता है उस स्थिति में फील्डिंग करने वाली टीम टाइम आउट (Time Out) की अपील कर सकती है. मैथ्यूज के साथ भी ऐसा ही हुआ. रिटायर्ड आउट का मतलब यदि कोई बल्लेबाज अंपायर को बिना बताए ग्राउंड से बाहर चला जाता है तो अंपायर उसे रिटायर्ड आउट करार देता है. .

Followed categories will be added to My News. James McDonald has beaten Zac Purton at his own game. In October 2022, Purton famously told J-Mac he was “stupid” for staying in Australia and not chasing the riches on offer in Hong Kong. “At the end of the day when he looks at his bank account and he looks at my bank account, he’s stupid for staying in Australia,” Purton told SEN. • ‘We are humans, my heart bleeds’: Williams extends hand to Khawaja “He can stay (in Australia), win all the trophies, get all the accolades, and at the end of his career he’ll still have a mortgage on his home. It’s as simple as that. Financially it just doesn’t make sense. “You can make six to seven times comfortably (in Hong Kong) what he would make a year.” Well, McDonald has just had a taste of that life, completing a 37-day stint in the Asian racing mecca and pocketing more cash than the six-time Hong Kong champion over the same period. In Hong Kong, a jockey gets 10 per cent of the prizemoney for winning and 5 per cent for finishing second to sixth. McDonald’s 15 winners earned $HK35,296,800, meaning he trousered a total of $HK3,529,680 ($A664,137), the bulk of which came from Romantic Warrior ’s brave victory in the Group 1 Hong Kong Cup. Wunderbar caps a J-Mac treble! The star rider returns a three-timer on the final day of his short-term contract... ð¥ @mcacajamez #LuckyStart | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/awPyARiFiX — HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) January 1, 2024 In that same period, Purton had 19 winners ($HK29,439,600) but only snared himself $HK2,943,960 ($A553,883) because they were in lesser quality races. His Group 1 victory, the Hong Kong Sprint with Lucky Sweynesse , was worth significantly less than the Cup while 12 of the 19 came in Class Four or Class Five. In contrast, 11 of McDonald’s 15 successes came in Class Three or above. • Triumph, scandal and tragedy – the moments that shaped 2023 Across 12 meetings from November 26 to January 1, McDonald collected a grand total of $HK50,398,695 in prizemoney, his share a very healthy $HK4,284,774.75 ($A806,140). For the season so far, that $HK50,398,695 number is second only to Purton ($HK92,120,285) and ahead of the likes of Karis Teetan ($HK50,136,960), Vincent Ho ($HK49,963,165) and Hugh Bowman ($HK25,953,550). Not bad for 5½ weeks’ work – J-Mac certainly knows what Purton was talking about now. But Purton, as usual, will end up having the last laugh given the maximum tax rate in Hong Kong is 15 per cent while the Australian Taxation Office will take a much bigger bite out of McDonald’s earnings.

Warner's rollercoaster 112-Test career will come to an end at the SCG this week, with the veteran opener fulfilling his dream of a home farewell when Australia play Pakistan in the third Test. But amid the celebrations for Warner this week in a series that is already won, the biggest question that looms is who will replace him against West Indies in Adelaide on January 17. Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw remain the front-runners out of the specialist openers, but Australia are open to going outside that group. Coach Andrew McDonald left the door open earlier this week for Cameron Green to take on the job, if it allowed Australia to pick their best six batsmen. Another option would be to shift Travis Head, Marnus Labuschage or Mitch Marsh to the top, allowing Green to return to the side. The likes of Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer have each warned against such a move, while Bancroft has also voiced a case for a specialist to be selected. But Cummins said he would be open to a move from a regular middle-order batsman. \"Uzzy (Usman Khawaja) wasn't a specialist (opener) until it was basically the only spot available in the team and he forced his way in,\" Cummins, who has been involved in informal discussions on the looming selection, said. \"Ideally, you've got someone who's had experience opening, but I don't think it's a blanket rule.\" Cummins has some first-hand experience on the topic, as a Test quick who has taken the new ball against specialist openers and those filling in the role in opposition teams. \"I think every case is different,\" Cummins said. \"If someone's been picked in the side as an opener, but their record's not great, you feel probably feel more of a chance (to get their wicket), rather than if you're picking their best batter. \"I don't think it's a big deal. It's just a batting position, everyone chops and changes around a little bit.\" Cummins on Tuesday lauded Warner as Australia's best-ever three-format batter, and noted his absence will be felt as much off the field as on it. The 37-year-old will play in this year's T20 World Cup, and while he has retired from ODI cricket, Warner is open to a comeback in major 50-over tournaments if asked. Australia's captain indicated that would likely not be required, but was not wholly opposed to the idea of an uncontracted Warner returning. \"It's probably time to give some others a crack,\" Cummins said. \"But knowing he is still going to be playing cricket, it might be more of a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option. \"He's going to be scoring runs somewhere in the world, so you never know.\" Warner's retirement is the first from within the Test team since Mitchell Johnson's in late 2015. But many more loom in coming years with Labuschagne the only player from an unchanged XI for the Sydney Test aged under 30. Cummins is confident, however, the vast majority of the team will be able to face India next summer. \"Realistically there is going to be some rate of change,\" Cummins said. \"We probably thought it was going to happen a little bit sooner but everyone is hanging on. \"After this block of Test matches, we don't play again until next summer.

The veteran off-spinner achieved the feat during the first Test of the ongoing 3-match series against Pakistan in Perth in December 2023. Glenn McGrath, who will be in Sydney for the Pink Test from January 3, said he was confident that Nathan Lyon would go past his Test tally and he has no problems being overtaken by the veteran off-spinner. Lyon is in the third spot in Australia's all-time Test list with 505 wickets in 124 matches. McGrath had finished his career with 563 wickets in 124 Tests while the late Shane Warne had 708 Test wickets in 145 Tests. Lyon, 36, has shown no signs of slowing down and has been an integral member of the Australian Test side, both overseas and at home. Lyon's ability to trouble opposition batters with his off-spin on pitches in Australia that are not conducive for spin bowling has set him apart from the rest. “To me, records are there for people to break. If Lyono goes past (me), credit to him. He’s had an incredible career. I wish him all the best, I hope he goes past me. That’s what it’s about,\" McGrath said in Sydney as his foundation was preparing for the Pink Test, aimed at raising awareness about Breast Cancer and fundraising. \"I will still be the most wickets by a fast bowler, so at least I have got something up my sleeve,\" he added. The former Australian fast bowler did not rule out Nathan Lyon's chances of going past Shane Warné's tally, saying it would be completely up to the off-spinner to decide if he wanted to give that shot. Whether he gets to ‘Shano’, that might be a different kettle of fish. It is up to him. He is obviously bowling well, he knows the game so well. It is totally up to him,\" McGrath added. Lyon flaunted his commitment and passion for the game when he made an incredible recovery from a calf injury tha sidelined him for the second-half of the 2023 season. Lyon underwent a rigorous 13-week rehabilitation program to get fit in time for the series against Pakistan. Lyon has often spoken about his desire to prolong his career. After getting to 500, Lyon stressed the importance of not taking anything for granted and putting in the hard yards, day in and day out. “Nice to get back after the injury, I have not taken anything for granted, especially playing for Australia, appreciate every moment of my career,” he had said.","pubDate":"2024-01-02 03:36:54","image_url":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/nathan-lyon-043702-16x9.jpg?VersionId=r0BpJM3y49aaLI1JzjMlw3CLqGG3Xi.E","source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"1eeabd065af7b52206e02ce0a329d60f","title":"‘Unseen’ Video of Virat Kohli After Defeat in ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Final Against Australia Goes Viral","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/unseen-video-of-virat-kohli-after-defeat-in-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-against-australia-goes-viral-5664927.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli scored 765 runs from 11 matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and was the highest scorer of the competition.

(AFP) नई दिल्ली. क्रिकेट को हमारे देश में धर्म की तरह पूजा जाता है. यहां छोटे छोटे बच्चे गलियों में क्रिकेट खेलते हुए देखे जा सकते हैं. लोग खिलाड़ियों को भगवान की तरह पूजते हैं. इस खेल के बारे में लोग काफी कुछ जानते हैं लेकिन क्रिकेट में एक बल्लेबाज कितने तरीकों से आउट हो सकता है, शायद कम ही लोगों को पता हो. एक बल्लेबाज 11 अलग अलग तरीकों से आउट हो सकता है. इनमें कई ऐसे नियम हैं जिनके बारे में जानकर आप हैरान हो जाएंगे. भारत में आयोजित आईसीसी क्रिकेट वर्ल्ड कप 2023 में एक बल्लेबाज बिना कोई गेंद खेले पवेलियन लौट गया. इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट के 146 के इतिहास में ऐसा पहली बार हुआ था. क्रिकेट में बल्लेबाज के कैच आउट (Catch Out) होने से हम सभी वाकिफ हैं. यह बल्लेबाज के आउट होने का सामान्य तरीका है. जब गेंद बल्लेबाज के बल्ले से लगकर जमीन पर गिरने से पहले फील्डर की ओर से कैच कर लिया जाता है तो, बैटर आउट माना जाता है. ज्यादातर कैच विकेट के पीछे जाते हैं जहां विकेटकीपर लपकने में कोई कोर कसर नहीं छोड़ता. इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट में सबसे ज्यादा कैच लपकने का रिकॉर्ड श्रीलंका के दिग्गज विकेटकीपर कुमार संगकारा के नाम है जिन्होंने टेस्ट, वनडे और टी20 में मिलाकर इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट में कुल 440 कैच लपके हैं. बोल्ड, एलबीडब्ल्यू, रनआउट जब बॉलर गेंद को सीधा स्टंप पर मारता है और गिल्लियां नीचे गिर जाती हैं, उस स्थिति में बल्लेबाज को क्लीनबोल्ड (Bowled) आउट दिया जाता है. वहीं जब गेंदबाज गेंद डालता है और सामने वाला बल्लेबाज उसे शरीर से रोकने की कोशिश करता है और यदि उसका पैर स्टंप्स के सामने पाया जाता है तो वह एलीबीडब्ल्यू (LBW) आउट होता है. जब बल्लेबाज शॉट खेलने के बाद रन के लिए दौड़ रहा होता है और उस दौरान फील्डर गेंद को उठाकर बैटर के पहुंचने से पहले नॉन स्ट्राइक या स्ट्राइक एंड पर थ्रो कर गिल्लियां बिखेर देता है तो उस कंडीशन में बल्लेबाज को रन आउट (Run Out) दिया जाता है. स्टंपिंग, हिटविकेट, ऑब्स्ट्रकटिंग द फील्ड जब बल्लेबाज गेंद को हिट करने की कोशिश में स्टंप्स से बाहर निकलता और उसके बल्ले से गेंद का संपर्क नहीं होता है उस स्थति में यदि विकेटकीपर गेंद को पकड़कर गिल्लियां बिखेर दो तो बल्लेबाज स्टंप (Stumping) आउट हो जाता है. बल्लेबाज जब शॉट खेलता है और बल्ला या शरीर का कोई भी हिस्सा स्टंप्स पर लगकर यदि गिल्लियां नीचे गिर जाती हैं, उस स्थिति में बैटर को हिटविकेट (Hit Wicket) आउट माना जाता है. जब कोई बल्लेबाज फील्डिंग करने वाली टीम को गेंद को पकड़ने में बाधा पहुंचाता है तब वह ऑब्स्ट्रकटिंग द फील्ड (Obstructing the Field) आउट करार दिया जाता है. गेंदबाज के गेंद फेंके बिना नॉन स्ट्राइकर एंड पर बल्लेबाज रन के लिए क्रीज से बाहर निकल जाए और बॉलर गेंद को स्टंप्स पर मारकर बैटर के खिलाफ मांकडिंग (Mankading) आउट की अपील कर सकता है. उस दौरान बल्लेबाज यदि क्रीज से बाहर पाया जाता है तो उसे पवेलियन लौटना होगा. टाइम आउट, रिटायर्ड आउट बल्लेबाज यदि दूसरी बार गेंद को को जानबूझकर मारने की कोशिश करता है तो उसे आउट करार दिया जाता है. जैसे कि गेंद यदि बल्लेबाज के बल्ले, शरीर या किसी अन्य उपकरण पर लगा हो और वह जानबूझकर फिर गेंद को मारने की कोशिश करता है तो उसे आउट दे दिया जाता है. हाल में भारत में खेले गए विश्व कप मैच में श्रीलंका के ऑलराउंडर एंजोलो मैथ्यूज को टाइम आउट करार दिया गया. विकेट गिरने के बाद यदि कोई बल्लेबाज तीन मिनट के भीतर क्रीज पर नहीं पहुंचता है उस स्थिति में फील्डिंग करने वाली टीम टाइम आउट (Time Out) की अपील कर सकती है. मैथ्यूज के साथ भी ऐसा ही हुआ. रिटायर्ड आउट का मतलब यदि कोई बल्लेबाज अंपायर को बिना बताए ग्राउंड से बाहर चला जाता है तो अंपायर उसे रिटायर्ड आउट करार देता है. .

Followed categories will be added to My News. James McDonald has beaten Zac Purton at his own game. In October 2022, Purton famously told J-Mac he was “stupid” for staying in Australia and not chasing the riches on offer in Hong Kong. “At the end of the day when he looks at his bank account and he looks at my bank account, he’s stupid for staying in Australia,” Purton told SEN. • ‘We are humans, my heart bleeds’: Williams extends hand to Khawaja “He can stay (in Australia), win all the trophies, get all the accolades, and at the end of his career he’ll still have a mortgage on his home. It’s as simple as that. Financially it just doesn’t make sense. “You can make six to seven times comfortably (in Hong Kong) what he would make a year.” Well, McDonald has just had a taste of that life, completing a 37-day stint in the Asian racing mecca and pocketing more cash than the six-time Hong Kong champion over the same period. In Hong Kong, a jockey gets 10 per cent of the prizemoney for winning and 5 per cent for finishing second to sixth. McDonald’s 15 winners earned $HK35,296,800, meaning he trousered a total of $HK3,529,680 ($A664,137), the bulk of which came from Romantic Warrior ’s brave victory in the Group 1 Hong Kong Cup. Wunderbar caps a J-Mac treble! The star rider returns a three-timer on the final day of his short-term contract... ð¥ @mcacajamez #LuckyStart | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/awPyARiFiX — HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) January 1, 2024 In that same period, Purton had 19 winners ($HK29,439,600) but only snared himself $HK2,943,960 ($A553,883) because they were in lesser quality races. His Group 1 victory, the Hong Kong Sprint with Lucky Sweynesse , was worth significantly less than the Cup while 12 of the 19 came in Class Four or Class Five. In contrast, 11 of McDonald’s 15 successes came in Class Three or above. • Triumph, scandal and tragedy – the moments that shaped 2023 Across 12 meetings from November 26 to January 1, McDonald collected a grand total of $HK50,398,695 in prizemoney, his share a very healthy $HK4,284,774.75 ($A806,140). For the season so far, that $HK50,398,695 number is second only to Purton ($HK92,120,285) and ahead of the likes of Karis Teetan ($HK50,136,960), Vincent Ho ($HK49,963,165) and Hugh Bowman ($HK25,953,550). Not bad for 5½ weeks’ work – J-Mac certainly knows what Purton was talking about now. But Purton, as usual, will end up having the last laugh given the maximum tax rate in Hong Kong is 15 per cent while the Australian Taxation Office will take a much bigger bite out of McDonald’s earnings.

Warner's rollercoaster 112-Test career will come to an end at the SCG this week, with the veteran opener fulfilling his dream of a home farewell when Australia play Pakistan in the third Test. But amid the celebrations for Warner this week in a series that is already won, the biggest question that looms is who will replace him against West Indies in Adelaide on January 17. Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft and Matt Renshaw remain the front-runners out of the specialist openers, but Australia are open to going outside that group. Coach Andrew McDonald left the door open earlier this week for Cameron Green to take on the job, if it allowed Australia to pick their best six batsmen. Another option would be to shift Travis Head, Marnus Labuschage or Mitch Marsh to the top, allowing Green to return to the side. The likes of Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer have each warned against such a move, while Bancroft has also voiced a case for a specialist to be selected. But Cummins said he would be open to a move from a regular middle-order batsman. \"Uzzy (Usman Khawaja) wasn't a specialist (opener) until it was basically the only spot available in the team and he forced his way in,\" Cummins, who has been involved in informal discussions on the looming selection, said. \"Ideally, you've got someone who's had experience opening, but I don't think it's a blanket rule.\" Cummins has some first-hand experience on the topic, as a Test quick who has taken the new ball against specialist openers and those filling in the role in opposition teams. \"I think every case is different,\" Cummins said. \"If someone's been picked in the side as an opener, but their record's not great, you feel probably feel more of a chance (to get their wicket), rather than if you're picking their best batter. \"I don't think it's a big deal. It's just a batting position, everyone chops and changes around a little bit.\" Cummins on Tuesday lauded Warner as Australia's best-ever three-format batter, and noted his absence will be felt as much off the field as on it. The 37-year-old will play in this year's T20 World Cup, and while he has retired from ODI cricket, Warner is open to a comeback in major 50-over tournaments if asked. Australia's captain indicated that would likely not be required, but was not wholly opposed to the idea of an uncontracted Warner returning. \"It's probably time to give some others a crack,\" Cummins said. \"But knowing he is still going to be playing cricket, it might be more of a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency option. \"He's going to be scoring runs somewhere in the world, so you never know.\" Warner's retirement is the first from within the Test team since Mitchell Johnson's in late 2015. But many more loom in coming years with Labuschagne the only player from an unchanged XI for the Sydney Test aged under 30. Cummins is confident, however, the vast majority of the team will be able to face India next summer. \"Realistically there is going to be some rate of change,\" Cummins said. \"We probably thought it was going to happen a little bit sooner but everyone is hanging on. \"After this block of Test matches, we don't play again until next summer.

The veteran off-spinner achieved the feat during the first Test of the ongoing 3-match series against Pakistan in Perth in December 2023. Glenn McGrath, who will be in Sydney for the Pink Test from January 3, said he was confident that Nathan Lyon would go past his Test tally and he has no problems being overtaken by the veteran off-spinner. Lyon is in the third spot in Australia's all-time Test list with 505 wickets in 124 matches. McGrath had finished his career with 563 wickets in 124 Tests while the late Shane Warne had 708 Test wickets in 145 Tests. Lyon, 36, has shown no signs of slowing down and has been an integral member of the Australian Test side, both overseas and at home. Lyon's ability to trouble opposition batters with his off-spin on pitches in Australia that are not conducive for spin bowling has set him apart from the rest. “To me, records are there for people to break. If Lyono goes past (me), credit to him. He’s had an incredible career. I wish him all the best, I hope he goes past me. That’s what it’s about,\" McGrath said in Sydney as his foundation was preparing for the Pink Test, aimed at raising awareness about Breast Cancer and fundraising. \"I will still be the most wickets by a fast bowler, so at least I have got something up my sleeve,\" he added. The former Australian fast bowler did not rule out Nathan Lyon's chances of going past Shane Warné's tally, saying it would be completely up to the off-spinner to decide if he wanted to give that shot. Whether he gets to ‘Shano’, that might be a different kettle of fish. It is up to him. He is obviously bowling well, he knows the game so well. It is totally up to him,\" McGrath added. Lyon flaunted his commitment and passion for the game when he made an incredible recovery from a calf injury tha sidelined him for the second-half of the 2023 season. Lyon underwent a rigorous 13-week rehabilitation program to get fit in time for the series against Pakistan. Lyon has often spoken about his desire to prolong his career. After getting to 500, Lyon stressed the importance of not taking anything for granted and putting in the hard yards, day in and day out. “Nice to get back after the injury, I have not taken anything for granted, especially playing for Australia, appreciate every moment of my career,” he had said.","pubDate":"2024-01-02 03:36:54","image_url":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/nathan-lyon-043702-16x9.jpg?VersionId=r0BpJM3y49aaLI1JzjMlw3CLqGG3Xi.E","source_id":"indiatoday","source_priority":2885,"country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"1eeabd065af7b52206e02ce0a329d60f","title":"‘Unseen’ Video of Virat Kohli After Defeat in ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Final Against Australia Goes Viral","link":"https://www.latestly.com/socially/sports/cricket/unseen-video-of-virat-kohli-after-defeat-in-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-against-australia-goes-viral-5664927.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli scored 765 runs from 11 matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and was the highest scorer of the competition.

(AFP) नई दिल्ली. क्रिकेट को हमारे देश में धर्म की तरह पूजा जाता है. यहां छोटे छोटे बच्चे गलियों में क्रिकेट खेलते हुए देखे जा सकते हैं. लोग खिलाड़ियों को भगवान की तरह पूजते हैं. इस खेल के बारे में लोग काफी कुछ जानते हैं लेकिन क्रिकेट में एक बल्लेबाज कितने तरीकों से आउट हो सकता है, शायद कम ही लोगों को पता हो. एक बल्लेबाज 11 अलग अलग तरीकों से आउट हो सकता है. इनमें कई ऐसे नियम हैं जिनके बारे में जानकर आप हैरान हो जाएंगे. भारत में आयोजित आईसीसी क्रिकेट वर्ल्ड कप 2023 में एक बल्लेबाज बिना कोई गेंद खेले पवेलियन लौट गया. इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट के 146 के इतिहास में ऐसा पहली बार हुआ था. क्रिकेट में बल्लेबाज के कैच आउट (Catch Out) होने से हम सभी वाकिफ हैं. यह बल्लेबाज के आउट होने का सामान्य तरीका है. जब गेंद बल्लेबाज के बल्ले से लगकर जमीन पर गिरने से पहले फील्डर की ओर से कैच कर लिया जाता है तो, बैटर आउट माना जाता है. ज्यादातर कैच विकेट के पीछे जाते हैं जहां विकेटकीपर लपकने में कोई कोर कसर नहीं छोड़ता. इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट में सबसे ज्यादा कैच लपकने का रिकॉर्ड श्रीलंका के दिग्गज विकेटकीपर कुमार संगकारा के नाम है जिन्होंने टेस्ट, वनडे और टी20 में मिलाकर इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट में कुल 440 कैच लपके हैं. बोल्ड, एलबीडब्ल्यू, रनआउट जब बॉलर गेंद को सीधा स्टंप पर मारता है और गिल्लियां नीचे गिर जाती हैं, उस स्थिति में बल्लेबाज को क्लीनबोल्ड (Bowled) आउट दिया जाता है. वहीं जब गेंदबाज गेंद डालता है और सामने वाला बल्लेबाज उसे शरीर से रोकने की कोशिश करता है और यदि उसका पैर स्टंप्स के सामने पाया जाता है तो वह एलीबीडब्ल्यू (LBW) आउट होता है. जब बल्लेबाज शॉट खेलने के बाद रन के लिए दौड़ रहा होता है और उस दौरान फील्डर गेंद को उठाकर बैटर के पहुंचने से पहले नॉन स्ट्राइक या स्ट्राइक एंड पर थ्रो कर गिल्लियां बिखेर देता है तो उस कंडीशन में बल्लेबाज को रन आउट (Run Out) दिया जाता है. स्टंपिंग, हिटविकेट, ऑब्स्ट्रकटिंग द फील्ड जब बल्लेबाज गेंद को हिट करने की कोशिश में स्टंप्स से बाहर निकलता और उसके बल्ले से गेंद का संपर्क नहीं होता है उस स्थति में यदि विकेटकीपर गेंद को पकड़कर गिल्लियां बिखेर दो तो बल्लेबाज स्टंप (Stumping) आउट हो जाता है. बल्लेबाज जब शॉट खेलता है और बल्ला या शरीर का कोई भी हिस्सा स्टंप्स पर लगकर यदि गिल्लियां नीचे गिर जाती हैं, उस स्थिति में बैटर को हिटविकेट (Hit Wicket) आउट माना जाता है. जब कोई बल्लेबाज फील्डिंग करने वाली टीम को गेंद को पकड़ने में बाधा पहुंचाता है तब वह ऑब्स्ट्रकटिंग द फील्ड (Obstructing the Field) आउट करार दिया जाता है. गेंदबाज के गेंद फेंके बिना नॉन स्ट्राइकर एंड पर बल्लेबाज रन के लिए क्रीज से बाहर निकल जाए और बॉलर गेंद को स्टंप्स पर मारकर बैटर के खिलाफ मांकडिंग (Mankading) आउट की अपील कर सकता है. उस दौरान बल्लेबाज यदि क्रीज से बाहर पाया जाता है तो उसे पवेलियन लौटना होगा. टाइम आउट, रिटायर्ड आउट बल्लेबाज यदि दूसरी बार गेंद को को जानबूझकर मारने की कोशिश करता है तो उसे आउट करार दिया जाता है. जैसे कि गेंद यदि बल्लेबाज के बल्ले, शरीर या किसी अन्य उपकरण पर लगा हो और वह जानबूझकर फिर गेंद को मारने की कोशिश करता है तो उसे आउट दे दिया जाता है. हाल में भारत में खेले गए विश्व कप मैच में श्रीलंका के ऑलराउंडर एंजोलो मैथ्यूज को टाइम आउट करार दिया गया. विकेट गिरने के बाद यदि कोई बल्लेबाज तीन मिनट के भीतर क्रीज पर नहीं पहुंचता है उस स्थिति में फील्डिंग करने वाली टीम टाइम आउट (Time Out) की अपील कर सकती है. मैथ्यूज के साथ भी ऐसा ही हुआ. रिटायर्ड आउट का मतलब यदि कोई बल्लेबाज अंपायर को बिना बताए ग्राउंड से बाहर चला जाता है तो अंपायर उसे रिटायर्ड आउट करार देता है. .
