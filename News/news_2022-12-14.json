The Bangladesh series [‚Ä¶]","content":"Chatogram : The first match of the 2-Test series between India and Bangladesh will start at 9 am today in Chattogram. Indian cricket team is touring Bangladesh. The two teams will face each other in a 2-Test series. The first match will start today at 9 am at Jaghur Ahmed Stadium in Chattogram. The Bangladesh series is crucial for the Indian team to qualify for the World Test Championship final. India are currently 4th in the World Test Championship points table. Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka are the top 3 teams. To qualify for the final in June 2023, India will need to win the 2nd Test against Bangladesh and the next 4th Test against Australia. Only if they win all these 6 matches can they directly qualify for the final without waiting for the results of the other teams. Team India‚Äôs journey to qualify for the World Test Championship final begins today at the Jharkhand Stadium. This ground is good for batting. However, it will give way to the whirlwind in the last days. Bangladesh have yet to win a Test match against India. However, the absence of Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Shami and Ravindra Jadeja due to injury may give the Indian team some setback. Jadeja‚Äôs absence on such a pitch could put the opposition‚Äôs 3rd and 4th innings batting at a disadvantage. However, Axar Patel may try to fill Jadeja‚Äôs place. Apart from this, in the absence of Rohit Sharma, the Indian team is led by KL Rahul. Kuldeep Yadav or Saurabh Kumar could be in place if India decide to go with a 3rd spinner. Left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar recently took 15 wickets in the 2-Test series against Bangladesh ‚ÄòA‚Äô. Perhaps Jaydev Unathkat or Navdeep Saini could be in place along with Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Siraj if India decide to go with 3 fast bowlers. Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant can add strength in the batting.","pubDate":"2022-12-14 02:24:37","image_url":null,"source_id":"thenewsglory","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Live cricket updates: White Ferns v Bangladesh - second ODI","link":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/live-cricket-updates-white-ferns-v-bangladesh-second-odi/USVC3FS7RBCX3E76AVMUSU3Q2M/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live updates of the ODI between the White Ferns and Bangladesh.","content":"Live updates of the second ODI between the White Ferns and Bangladesh.

Sadly, he‚Äòs in the other dressing room.","content":"Michael Neser, the crafty swing and seam bowler, looks like missing out on a chance to play a Test for Australia before his home crowd against South Africa at the Gabba on Saturday. Neser‚Äôs ‚Äúother home‚Äô‚Äô was South Africa.The doctor‚Äôs son was raised in the Pretoria region before moving to Australia at age nine after his family was robbed at a set of traffic lights. Their car was rammed by a drunk driver and after they left the vehicle to regain their composure, Neser‚Äôs family returned to find all their personal possessions had been stolen. It‚Äôs hard to know whether Neser would have been chosen for South Africa had he stayed in the country of his birth, but this much is sure ‚Äì they will miss having someone just like him in Saturday‚Äôs first Test against Australia at the Gabba. South Africa, the nation which produced iconic all-rounders Jacques Kallis and Mike Procter, has no multiskilled player to balance their Test XI. As a consequence, they are likely to choose just five specialist batsmen and promote keeper Kyle Verreyne to No.6.That will allow them to play five bowlers, but it also makes their tail worryingly long, especially as this is not one of their great top orders. Neser, with a first class batting average of 25 and more ability than his numbers show, would have been a neat fit at No.7.The challenge for Neser to play more Tests is that Australia generally likes its fast men to be able to be bounce bowlers who push the speedometer to around 140km/h. But if he misses out on Tests this summer he will still be a frontline contender for next year‚Äôs Ashes tour.South Africa‚Äôs fragile top order would make it a gamble to play five bowlers but bowling coach Charl Langeveldt hinted strongly this was the Proteas‚Äô preferred option when he said the main priority of the Test squad was to take 20 wickets per Test. South Africa‚Äôs tall pacy, quicks looked in good form in their only warm-up match at the Gabba this week and will be a vast improvement on the modest fare Australia faced in their first two Tests of the summer against the West Indies. Series between bitter rivals needs a nameAustralia‚Äôs Test series against South Africa has got everything ‚Äì except something to play for.Incredibly, the clash between these two ancient, hard-punching rivals has no perpetual trophy.In 2016, Cricket Australia started an online campaign to invite readers to suggest names but, quite mysteriously, a solution was never found and the campaign petered out.It‚Äôs time to light the fire again and see what the fans think. South Africa and Australia have met in 15 Test series since the Apartheid era without having a trophy that carries an official name in the way that clashes with the West Indies are honoured by the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy.SCBBL PROMOOld ‚ÄúFrank‚Äô‚Äô has copped plenty of bumps over the years, the latest when the lock had to be ‚Äújimmied‚Äô‚Äô by ground staff in Adelaide this week, but it‚Äôs still a notable piece of silverware and certainly better than competing for thin air.So where do we go from here?I popped the Trophy question to South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada this week and he smiled broadly before quipping: ‚ÄúWhat about the Kepler Wessels Cup because he played for both nations?‚ÄúNo matter whether the trophy goes to South Africa or Australia he‚Äôs a winner. He‚Äôd would be quite chuffed with that.‚Äô‚ÄôAus v SA trophy pollWessels was indeed the only cricketer to play Tests for both nations, notching 24 Tests for Australia before returning to South Africa to lead the team back into international cricket after Apartheid. Wessels has since returned to live in Brisbane and was match referee for South Australia‚Äôs trial game at Allan Border Field this week.One worthy choice would be the Donald-McGrath Trophy to honour fast bowling greats Allan Donald and Glenn McGrath, an option first raised by News Corp a decade ago.These two not only ended up good friends but they used to monitor each other‚Äôs results in the morning paper and be motivated to outshine the other.McGrath and Donald took their 300th wickets a month apart from a similar number of Tests in 2000.Donald once said of his great rival: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a shame we could never get to bowl together in a Test match. McGrath and Donald opening for a World XI against the rest. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd love to see.‚ÄùMcGrath replied: ‚ÄúI get along well with him ... he‚Äôs a great bowler and for a guy to have his longevity for the cricket he has played is a credit to him.‚ÄùAfter the anguish of Sandpapergate to link rivals who had such an immense connection and respect for each other would add a special inspiring flavour to the final act of the series. What a joy it would be ‚Äì particularly after the bitter falling out of Sandpapergate ‚Äì to appoint two men with incredible mutual respect.But there are many other names worthy of consideration. Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock, Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher all had their moments.Any of them would be a better choice than the current option ‚Äì nobody.Watch on Warner as Aussies back under-fire opener‚Äî Peter LalorThe Australian team is backing David Warner to turn around recent modest form, insisting he is part of their plans for the Indian series and the World Test Championship.Coach Andrew McDonald did indicate, however, that they would be monitoring him in the South African series.The 36-year-old has not scored a hundred since January 2020 and is averaging around 30 since then.Warner, one of the most committed and valued members of the side, plays his 100th Test at the MCG and has signalled that he does not plan to play Test cricket next summer.A foundation stone at the top of the order and a dynamic presence in the field, he has been an essential part of Australian cricket since making his Test debut in December 2011. He has been one of the first picked in any white ball side. His form remains strong in white ball cricket. Warner won player of the series in the successful 2021 T20 World Cup campaign and in both the T20 series against the West Indies and the ODI series against England since.Coach Andrew McDonald insisted that there are no concerns about Warner‚Äôs inability to seize recent opportunities.‚ÄúNot at this stage,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHis appetite for the work, in and around training is still there.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs busy at the crease, and you‚Äôve seen signs that he is going well.‚ÄòHe‚Äôs just found different ways to get out, and sometimes that can happen.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eager to continue on at this stage, he hasn‚Äôt hinted anything else.‚ÄúWe are building towards a World Test Championship as well, and he wants to be part of that so that‚Äôs a clear focus for us and we‚Äôve got South Africa as a part of that.‚ÄúAnd then on to India.‚ÄúAt this stage, we‚Äôve got him in our plans for India.‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens in the next three Test matches, but at this stage he‚Äôs firmly in our thoughts for India.‚ÄùMcDonald acknowledged that Warner‚Äôs average (24) in India was not high but said it needed to be put into context.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been some challenging conditions in India, I haven‚Äôt looked through all of those Test matches but I imagine there would have been some similar averages in amongst that from other batters as well,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen the more times you tour certain areas of the world, the better you get at it.‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also the knowledge that he can pass on to the younger players in and amongst that.‚ÄúWe really value our senior players, both on and off the field in terms of that education process, even when they‚Äôre out there in amongst the heat of the battle.‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs huge benefit for those players to be touring those areas, and albeit if they don‚Äôt play they can still have an impact.‚ÄùPhillip Hughes was the first of 13 different players who have appeared at the other end to open the batting with the veteran.Warner, who has three young girls, is a committed family man and recently walked away from an appeals process aimed at lifting his lifetime leadership ban, saying he said he was not willing to subject them to any more controversy.Just days later his wife Candice was abused by a fan at Adelaide Oval while she walked with two of the children to meet their father. Cricket Australia has offered to provide her with security after she said cricket no longer felt safe for her family.Warner is renowned for his ability to block out distractions in a game and McDonald said he had not shown any sense of being otherwise occupied during this series.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs great at compartmentalising, separating the off-field from the on-field and I think most of the great champions do that very well,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI sense this situation is not different.‚ÄúWe respect and understand David‚Äôs decision to withdraw from that appeals process.‚ÄòHe‚Äôs moved forward, we‚Äôre moving forward as a team and we‚Äôve got a seriously good opponent confronting us at the Gabba so our focus is firmly on that.‚ÄúAnd so is David‚Äôs.‚ÄùThe coach backed up players assertions that the dressing room is oblivious to extraneous noise at a time when they have been subject to bleating and attack from the noisy band of culture war warriors. The Warner appeal also lead to a reignition of the controversy surrounding ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs happening inside the walls of the South African dressing room, but within the walls of our dressing room, you wouldn‚Äôt notice any distractions.‚ÄúThis week, we move forward.‚ÄúPeople are critiquing that we need to address things on the inside ‚Äì we‚Äôve moved on from that and you wouldn‚Äôt notice the noise that‚Äôs on the outside.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs definitely not on the inside, if that makes sense.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve moved on.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-12-14 01:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"New Covid rules mean play on in Big Bash","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/covidpositive-players-will-be-separated-but-able-to-play-in-big-bash/news-story/a9f5595dcd400520ccf617df73e64788","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries","Kayo","Sport news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Big Bash officials won‚Äòt let this season be derailed by a new Covid wave and will set up a third changeroom to be shared by any players who want to play while positive.","content":"Melbourne Stars duo Marcus Stoinis and Joe Burns both played in Tuesday‚Äôs season opener in Canberra despite testing positive for the virus just hours before the game. They travelled to the ground in a separate car, warmed up separately, sat away from their teammates while waiting to bat and used their own changeroom. Stoinis lasted just one ball with the bat and didn‚Äôt field as the illness took hold, putting him under a cloud for the Stars game on Friday.Burns also strained a hamstring while batting and will be sidelined for some time. But after last summer‚Äôs BBL was hit hard by Covid disruptions, particularly the Stars who fielded a line-up full of fill-ins when 10 players and eight staff members got the virus in January, the plan is to let players play this summer should they feel comfortable to do so. There will be at least three changerooms at all grounds, with any Covid-positive players to share the third one, but they will also be encouraged to remain outside as much as possible. Teams will also have to notify match officials and the opposition of any Covid-positive players. It‚Äôs become the norm in sport now and in cricket. Stars captain, and Australian spinner, Adam Zampa was poised to play in the T20 World Cup after testing positive before withdrawing. Australian all-rounder Tahlia McGrath also won Commonwealth Games gold in Birmingham while Covid-positive, accepting her medal in a mask. Zampa said the issue of Covid positives wasn‚Äôt something the players worried about. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something we‚Äôre getting used to now, it‚Äôs happened already quite a bit this summer through the World Cup,‚Äù he said after the game. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even speak about it, it‚Äôs just a quick message saying these guys are positive and stay away.‚ÄùStoinis spent the second innings in Canberra on Tuesday night sitting on the boundary, wrapped in a blanket, and Zampa said after his experience with the virus, cold weather makes it worse.

Amazingly, the South Australian has only been dismissed four times, giving her an incredible average of 121.In two matches so far against India, McGrath has unbeaten scores of 40 and 70 and, according to stand-in captain Alyssa Healy, is riding a wave of confidence that makes her hard to stop. ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs just grown in confidence and confidence goes a long way in this format,‚Äù Healy said of McGrath on Tuesday.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an incredibly fickle format, but if you‚Äôre walking out there just a little bit more confident than your opposition, it could generally fall your way and I think TMac (McGrath) has just grown as a cricketer, as a leader and as a batter as well.‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs really confident in her ability and what she can do for our side and I think that‚Äôs great.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great reward for the last 12 months for her and hopefully she can keep flying for us.‚ÄùThe confirmation of McGrath‚Äôs No.1 ranking came before Australia‚Äôs third T20 against India on Thursday morning, with the series level 1-1 after India ended Australia‚Äôs unbeaten run in 2022 on Monday. McGrath, who also captained the Adelaide Strikers to a maiden WBBL title in November, has taken over the No.3 spot in the batting order in the absence of Lanning, who is yet to confirm if or when she will make her return to cricket.The absent skipper is one of five Australian batters inside the top 10 T20 rankings, joining McGrath and Mooney (2), Healy (8) and Ashleigh Gardner (10).McGrath is also ranked 10th on the all-rounder list for T20s, while Healy is the No.1 ODI batter.","pubDate":"2022-12-13 23:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"296 and counting: Mitchell Starc‚Äôs milestone wickets","link":"https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/296-and-counting-mitchell-starcs-milestone-wickets/video/707e952668e8051b94e74005faaa57cc","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australian quick Mitchell Starc is nearing the 300 mark when it comes to Test wickets.

Rafiq appeared before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Tuesday for the first time since November 2021 when he gave harrowing evidence about the racism he faced during his time at Yorkshire. The 31-year-old used his latest appearance in front of the committee to highlight the abuse he and his family have endured since he blew the whistle. \"If I was to look at 13 months on from me opening my heart out, all that's changed really is that me and my family have been driven out of the country. And that's a sad element of it,\" he said. Karachi-born Rafiq, who moved with his immediate family to Pakistan last month, recounted incidents of abuse to the committee, including a man defecating outside his parents' house. \"I would love to come here and tell you how much cricket has changed, but unfortunately what it feels like is that cricket is very much in denial,\" he said. \"There are still a group of people out there who feel like cricket is the victim in this. \"The way I've been attacked and abused, why would you speak out? I've got a little hope in the new (ECB) leadership, but it's very little at the minute.\" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) charged a number of individuals in relation to Rafiq's allegations of abuse in June, along with Yorkshire for the county's handling of those allegations. However, the Cricket Discipline Commission has yet to hear the case after a dispute over whether it should take place in public or private. Responding to Rafiq's latest claims, the ECB insisted they are committed to sustained action to deliver lasting cultural change. \"The evidence heard by the DCMS Select Committee today demonstrates why widespread change in cricket is needed and why delivering that lasting cultural change will require sustained action over many years,\" an ECB statement said. \"We are committed to achieving this, and have been listening carefully to today's testimony which will play an important part in helping us understand the further work that is needed. \"Since the testimony given by Azeem Rafiq to the select committee a year ago, significant action has been taken across cricket and progress has been made in tackling discrimination and making the sport more welcoming and inclusive. But we are well aware there remains much more work to do. \"We condemn discrimination of any form and we applaud the bravery of those including Azeem and (former Essex player) Jahid Ahmed who have spoken out about their experiences.\" The ECB expect an on-going independent investigation to give guidance on the appropriate course of action in 2023. \"In the new year the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC), which has been examining questions of equity in relation to race, gender and class within cricket, will provide recommendations on what further action the ECB and the wider game needs to take to make cricket a game for everyone,\" the statement added. \"We expect its independent findings to be challenging, but believe its report can help to drive the lasting change we need and rebuild trust among communities to show people that cricket can be a game for them.\"","pubDate":"2022-12-13 21:55:51","image_url":null,"source_id":"japantoday","country":["japan"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"McDonald backs Warner resurgence in Test Cricket","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/mcdonald-backs-warner-resurgence-in-test-cricket/video/cd135a2a87a7e5256c75b756135fa881","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australian Test coach Andrew McDonald is confident it's only a matter of time before David Warner rediscovers his best form as the team gets set to take on South Africa.","content":"Cricket: Australian Test coach Andrew McDonald is confident it's only a matter of time before David Warner rediscovers his best form as the team gets set to take on South Africa.","pubDate":"2022-12-13 21:45:17","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"SACA urged to investigate Candice Warner abuse","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/saca-urged-to-investigate-candice-warner-abuse/video/5a60e0f376b27b1e5e95433d0f01154c","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Australia Cricketers' association CEO Todd Greenberg has urged the SACA to investigate the alleged abuse towards Candice Warner during the Adelaide Test.","content":"Cricket: Australia Cricketers' association CEO Todd Greenberg has urged the SACA to investigate the alleged abuse towards Candice Warner during the Adelaide Test.","pubDate":"2022-12-13 21:36:21","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"FIFA World Cup 2022, Argentina vs Croatia Highlights: Lionel Messi, Julian Alvarez take Argentina into final","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/fifa-world-cup-2022-argentina-vs-croatia-highlights-lionel-messi-julian-alvarez-take-argentina-into-final-11803381.html","keywords":["Sports"],"creator":["FP Sports"],"video_url":null,"description":"FIFA World Cup 2022, Argentina vs Croatia Highlights: Lionel Messi, Julian Alvarez take Argentina into final","content":"FIFA World Cup 2022, Argentina vs Croatia Highlights: Lionel Messi, Julian Alvarez take Argentina into final FIFA World Cup 2022, Highlights: ARGENTINA ARE IN THE FINAL!

The system, which is accessible by website or app and will have phased out MyCricket by 2024, was tested in the Northern Territory earlier this year and has garnered negative attention in the SA cricket community for a lack of statistics and regular live match update errors. One SA league official said the system was negatively impacting the current season.‚ÄúMyCricket was launched in 2008 and was getting on a bit so I understand something new being brought in but at least MyCricket did the job,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúPlayHQ is a complete mess at the moment ‚Äì it worked for footy or basketball but it just simply wasn‚Äôt ready to roll out for cricket. There are so many holes in it ‚Äì we‚Äôre halfway through the season and people still can‚Äôt see accumulated batting or bowling stats for this year let alone lifetime stats. ‚ÄúThere have been a lot of faults when it comes to live scoring as well. It looks like it could be a better system moving forward but it‚Äôs like we‚Äôve been used as guinea pigs in the meantime ‚Äì we experience all the problems and then they eventually get fixed.‚Äù SA cricket fans and participants are not the first in Australia to vent frustration with Play HQ, with Townsville and New South Wales also experiencing significant issues through their seasons. Cricket NSW even published an apology video on its Facebook in October regarding the implementation of the new system. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed it has been brought in despite complaints from other states, especially in NT earlier this year,‚Äù the league official said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very worrying and possibly damaging considering we‚Äôre coming up to the business end of the season, leagues have presentation nights, awards, reports, but no one can see any accumulative stats for these events.‚ÄúAt times it doesn‚Äôt even reflect league ladders correctly because the system doesn‚Äôt take outright wins or bonus points into account for standings.‚Äù One high-standing local coach said they had been underwhelmed by the system.‚ÄúIt would be good if we had something which worked ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been disappointing,‚Äù they said. A star player added it had been ‚Äúshambolic.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit of a joke considering how far into the season we are. ‚ÄúI get it‚Äôs probably a process but a lot of player statistics aren‚Äôt correct or tallied up and you can‚Äôt even see who‚Äôs at the top for batting or bowling numbers.‚Äù A Cricket Australia spokesperson told The Messenger the national body was working with SACA and PlayHQ to address any issues. ‚ÄúCA, SACA and PlayHQ are gathering regular feedback from club and association administrators this season to ensure we provide the features most important to users,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe are very confident the transition to PlayHQ will inevitably provide a greatly improved digital and online experience.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlayer stats including batting and bowling leaderboards are currently available on the MyCricket app.‚ÄùCricket Australia also said live scoring had been improved through recent weeks and that information and statistics for awards would be available by the end of the season.","pubDate":"2022-12-13 20:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"couriermail","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Crash: Series between bitter rivals needs a name","link":"https://www.themercury.com.au/sport/cricket/aussies-say-david-warners-spot-not-under-pressure-at-the-moment/news-story/67349ae239f76a8a2ef9bb1920525618","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Australia‚Äôs Test series against South Africa has got everything ‚Äì except something to play for.","content":"Incredibly, the clash between these two ancient, hard-punching rivals has no perpetual trophy.In 2016, Cricket Australia started an online campaign to invite readers to suggest names but, quite mysteriously, a solution was never found and the campaign petered out.It‚Äôs time to light the fire again and see what the fans think. South Africa and Australia have met in 15 Test series since the Apartheid era without having a trophy that carries an official name in the way that clashes with the West Indies are honoured by the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy.SCBBL PROMOOld ‚ÄúFrank‚Äô‚Äô has copped plenty of bumps over the years, the latest when the lock had to be ‚Äújimmied‚Äô‚Äô by ground staff in Adelaide this week, but it‚Äôs still a notable piece of silverware and certainly better than competing for thin air.So where do we go from here?I popped the Trophy question to South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada this week and he smiled broadly before quipping: ‚ÄúWhat about the Kepler Wessels Cup because he played for both nations?‚ÄúNo matter whether the trophy goes to South Africa or Australia he‚Äôs a winner. He‚Äôd would be quite chuffed with that.‚Äô‚ÄôAus v SA trophy pollWessels was indeed the only cricketer to play Tests for both nations, notching 24 Tests for Australia before returning to South Africa to lead the team back into international cricket after Apartheid. Wessels has since returned to live in Brisbane and was match referee for South Australia‚Äôs trial game at Allan Border Field this week.One worthy choice would be the Donald-McGrath Trophy to honour fast bowling greats Allan Donald and Glenn McGrath, an option first raised by News Corp a decade ago.These two not only ended up good friends but they used to monitor each other‚Äôs results in the morning paper and be motivated to outshine the other.McGrath and Donald took their 300th wickets a month apart from a similar number of Tests in 2000.Donald once said of his great rival: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a shame we could never get to bowl together in a Test match. McGrath and Donald opening for a World XI against the rest. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd love to see.‚ÄùMcGrath replied: ‚ÄúI get along well with him ... he‚Äôs a great bowler and for a guy to have his longevity for the cricket he has played is a credit to him.‚ÄùAfter the anguish of Sandpapergate to link rivals who had such an immense connection and respect for each other would add a special inspiring flavour to the final act of the series. What a joy it would be ‚Äì particularly after the bitter falling out of Sandpapergate ‚Äì to appoint two men with incredible mutual respect.But there are many other names worthy of consideration. Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock, Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher all had their moments.Any of them would be a better choice than the current option ‚Äì nobody.Watch on Warner as Aussies back under-fire opener‚Äî Peter LalorThe Australian team is backing David Warner to turn around recent modest form, insisting he is part of their plans for the Indian series and the World Test Championship.Coach Andrew McDonald did indicate, however, that they would be monitoring him in the South African series.The 36-year-old has not scored a hundred since January 2020 and is averaging around 30 since then.Warner, one of the most committed and valued members of the side, plays his 100th Test at the MCG and has signalled that he does not plan to play Test cricket next summer.A foundation stone at the top of the order and a dynamic presence in the field, he has been an essential part of Australian cricket since making his Test debut in December 2011. He has been one of the first picked in any white ball side. His form remains strong in white ball cricket. Warner won player of the series in the successful 2021 T20 World Cup campaign and in both the T20 series against the West Indies and the ODI series against England since.Coach Andrew McDonald insisted that there are no concerns about Warner‚Äôs inability to seize recent opportunities.‚ÄúNot at this stage,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHis appetite for the work, in and around training is still there.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs busy at the crease, and you‚Äôve seen signs that he is going well.‚ÄòHe‚Äôs just found different ways to get out, and sometimes that can happen.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eager to continue on at this stage, he hasn‚Äôt hinted anything else.‚ÄúWe are building towards a World Test Championship as well, and he wants to be part of that so that‚Äôs a clear focus for us and we‚Äôve got South Africa as a part of that.‚ÄúAnd then on to India.‚ÄúAt this stage, we‚Äôve got him in our plans for India.‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens in the next three Test matches, but at this stage he‚Äôs firmly in our thoughts for India.‚ÄùMcDonald acknowledged that Warner‚Äôs average (24) in India was not high but said it needed to be put into context.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been some challenging conditions in India, I haven‚Äôt looked through all of those Test matches but I imagine there would have been some similar averages in amongst that from other batters as well,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen the more times you tour certain areas of the world, the better you get at it.‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also the knowledge that he can pass on to the younger players in and amongst that.‚ÄúWe really value our senior players, both on and off the field in terms of that education process, even when they‚Äôre out there in amongst the heat of the battle.‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs huge benefit for those players to be touring those areas, and albeit if they don‚Äôt play they can still have an impact.‚ÄùPhillip Hughes was the first of 13 different players who have appeared at the other end to open the batting with the veteran.Warner, who has three young girls, is a committed family man and recently walked away from an appeals process aimed at lifting his lifetime leadership ban, saying he said he was not willing to subject them to any more controversy.Just days later his wife Candice was abused by a fan at Adelaide Oval while she walked with two of the children to meet their father. Cricket Australia has offered to provide her with security after she said cricket no longer felt safe for her family.Warner is renowned for his ability to block out distractions in a game and McDonald said he had not shown any sense of being otherwise occupied during this series.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs great at compartmentalising, separating the off-field from the on-field and I think most of the great champions do that very well,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI sense this situation is not different.‚ÄúWe respect and understand David‚Äôs decision to withdraw from that appeals process.‚ÄòHe‚Äôs moved forward, we‚Äôre moving forward as a team and we‚Äôve got a seriously good opponent confronting us at the Gabba so our focus is firmly on that.‚ÄúAnd so is David‚Äôs.‚ÄùThe coach backed up players assertions that the dressing room is oblivious to extraneous noise at a time when they have been subject to bleating and attack from the noisy band of culture war warriors. The Warner appeal also lead to a reignition of the controversy surrounding ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs happening inside the walls of the South African dressing room, but within the walls of our dressing room, you wouldn‚Äôt notice any distractions.‚ÄúThis week, we move forward.‚ÄúPeople are critiquing that we need to address things on the inside ‚Äì we‚Äôve moved on from that and you wouldn‚Äôt notice the noise that‚Äôs on the outside.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs definitely not on the inside, if that makes sense.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve moved on.‚Äù","pubDate":"2022-12-13 19:09:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"mercury","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Test of Rahul‚Äôs captaincy as India to push for WTC final qualification","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/12/14/test-of-rahuls-captaincy-as-india-to-push-for-wtc-final-qualification/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"Chattogram: KL Rahul‚Äôs tactical acumen will be tested along with his batting prowess when a depleted Indian team clashes with a tricky Bangladesh in the high-stakes two-match series, the result of which will have an impact on India‚Äôs chances for the World Test Championship final qualification.

India are currently fourth in the WTC table behind Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The only way of qualifying for the final in June is to straightaway win both the Tests against Bangladesh and then all four at home against Pat Cummins‚Äô Australia to eliminate any ifs and buts. The journey starts at the Zahoor Ahmed Stadium, which has traditionally favoured the batters but also offers some turn towards the business end of the match. The visitors will start as overwhelming favourites in Test format, in which the Bangladesh is yet to beat India but the absence of Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja could hurt the side. Jadeja‚Äôs absence on these kind of tracks always puts Indian team on the back-foot especially when the opposition team is batting in the third innings or fourth innings. Jadeja-Ashwin duo, at least against lesser Test nations on sub-continental tracks could be lethal but Axar Patel has done his hard yards over the past two seasons as the second choice left-arm spinner. As many as 10 Indian players, if all are fit, select themselves in the playing XI and the most important call that the two Rahuls ‚Äî skipper KL and head coach Dravid ‚Äî need to make is about the fifth specialist bowler ‚Äî a third pacer or a third spinner. Whether India will field a third choice specialist spinner in wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav or slow left-arm orthodox Saurabh Kumar is there to be seen. Saurabh, who has been a star performer for India A team in the recently concluded two-Test series against Bangladesh A with 15 wickets, would feel that he has made his case for a Test Cap in at least one of the two games. Rahul‚Äôs test as a leader =============== In the past one year, Rahul hasn‚Äôt been exactly exceptional in terms of cricketing smarts as far as captaincy is concerned and this series where he is likely to get two games will be an acid test as far as his long-term leadership ambition is concerned. On Monday, during the trophy unveiling ceremony with his counterpart Shakib al Hasan, Rahul told the mediapersons that his team ‚Äúplans to play aggressive cricket‚Äù as they know what exactly needs to be done in order to reach the WTC finals for the second consecutive time. But Rahul, whose performances in white-ball formats has been a bit underwhelming to say the least, will have to walk the talk in terms of showing the required intent and aggression in batting department. He will have young Shubman Gill for company with Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer manning the middle-order. Rishabh Pant will be back in what could safely be termed as his favourite format where his uncluttered batting has been a delightful spectacle for the Indian fans. In the bowling department, Umesh Yadav, a master at his craft on barren sub-continental tracks will have Mohammed Siraj, Ashwin and Axar Patel for company. In case a third pacer is selected instead of an additional spinner, the choice will be between two bowlers of one-Test experience ‚Äî domestic doyen Jaydev Unadkat and the skiddy Navdeep Saini, who is more remembered for being at the other end when Pant created history at the Gabba. As far as Bangladesh team is concerned, it will be keen to change its dismal winless record against India over the past 22 years. In the traditional format, Bangladesh has never had the bowling resources to trouble teams regularly even when they have played at home. Pacers Taskin Ahmed, Ebadot Hossain, Shoriful Islam along with spinners Shakib and Taijul Islam would love to alter the script. But they do have a steady batting line-up for home conditions with skipper Shakib having 4000 plus runs under his belt. Add Mushfiqur Rahim‚Äôs tally of 5000 plus runs and another former skipper Mominul Haque‚Äôs 3500 plus aggregate, the batting does have a solid look. Teams India: KL Rahul (captain), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jaydev Unadkat, Mohammed Siraj, Saurabh Kumar, Kona Bharat, Kuldeep Yadav, Abhimanyu Easwaran.

Pant, one of the most destructive players among the current crop has five Test hundreds and 10 fifties in 31 games with centuries in England, Australia and South Africa. Ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh, Pant was seen going hammer and tongs at the nets on Tuesday and that prompted a query for Mhambrey about having conversations about the left-hander‚Äôs approach. ‚ÄúWe are not having any special discussion with Rishabh. That‚Äôs his game and we know that. Nothing changes, that‚Äôs the way he prepares for any format, white ball and he is pretty much aware about his role in the team,‚Äù he said during the pre-match press conference. ‚ÄúOur conversations are never around the way he is playing as he knows what the team expects out of him,‚Äù Mhambrey, who has seen Pant from his India U-19 days, said. While he didn‚Äôt disclose whether India will go with a third spinner or a third pacer but he was happy that Umesh Yadav, with all his experience, will spearhead the Indian pace attack. ‚ÄúUmesh is a very experienced bowler. We all know what Umesh brings to the table. Unfortunately, he hasn‚Äôt got too many opportunities as we had Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj playing in England,‚Äù Mhambrey said. ‚ÄúThe team management has spoken to him and had discussions and we have lot of clarity as far as Umesh is concerned. The other way I look at it is that he will spearhead the attack and he has lot of experience going into the series. I am also happy how Siraj has progressed in Tests and happy that he has delivered.‚Äù The former India seamer admitted that Bumrah and Shami will be missed. ‚ÄúBumrah and Shami will be missed but we look at it as others getting an opportunity to play Test cricket and perform for the country,‚Äù said Mhambrey. Mhambrey also conceded that after at least four months of continuous white ball cricket, adjustment to red ball format will be key. ‚ÄúWe are playing Test cricket after long time, takes a little while to have that mental change. You have just come from T20 World Cup in Australia and now it is a different format. ‚ÄúOne good thing is lot of these guys are playing matches. Siraj (ODIs), Umesh (India A) played lot of cricket.

The tour represents the start of a busy year for the Ireland Men‚Äôs squad that includes four tours, several home series, competing in two world cup qualifying campaigns and holds the tantalising prospect of playing at the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup in India at the end of the year. The two sides recently met at the 2022 ICC Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup where Zimbabwe secured a 31-run win in Hobart. Andrew White, National Selector, said: ‚Äú2023 will be the year when we return to playing all three formats. However, with a T20 World Cup Qualifier in July and a possible 50-over Cricket World Cup in October ‚Äì if we can qualify ‚Äì the importance of this white-ball series is obvious. The volume of cricket next year demands that we will need a broader pool of ‚Äòinternational-ready‚Äô players to meet the challenges ahead, and the Zimbabwe tour will be the start of that process.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile the squads selected reflect the new dynamism and positive philosophy that Heinrich and his staff have been instilling in our white-ball squads, we have taken advantage of the decision to allow a couple of our players the opportunity to participate in franchise tournaments. Paul Stirling will feature in the one-day series against Zimbabwe but has been granted approval to miss the T20I series and play in the new International League T20, while Josh Little has been granted approval to miss the T20I series to play in the SA20.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis flexibility in selection will allow us to provide a number of fringe players a chance ‚Äì most notably, Stephen Doheny, who is in line to make his international debut after serving a lengthy apprenticeship, while we welcome back Tyrone Kane to the senior set-up. Tyrone has changed the dynamic of what he can bring to the table in recent seasons, and with selection policy seeking to choose players that fit the playing philosophy, his mid to late overs batting clearly fits the bill. Coincidentally, Tyrone‚Äôs last match for Ireland was against Zimbabwe, and we wish him well for his return to the national side.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith Paul and Josh missing the T20I series, this has created space for the return of Ben White and Neil Rock. Ben has benefited from spending time with Spin Bowling Coach Nathan Hauritz in the nets and is continuing to develop his leg spin, and Neil will come into the squad in largely a batting capacity.‚Äù ‚ÄúIreland versus Zimbabwe is always a competitive tussle, and with both sides coming off the back of good performances at the recent T20 World Cup, we expect no difference in this series,‚Äù concluded the national selector.

In this case, Akash Chopra, the former player and commentator of the Indian cricket team, has spoken about the prospects of the Indian cricket team. India must win the Test cricket series against Bangladesh starting tomorrow. It is said that only then will the Indian team have a chance to do so. It is noteworthy that the Indian team played in the final of the last Test Championship. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very simple. There are two matches in this series. India‚Äôs chances of making it to the finals of the World Test Championship will be bright if they win both. If that doesn‚Äôt happen, chances will be tough for the Indian team. There are many things starting with the playing eleven. But it must be said that your destiny is in your hands. South Africa, who are ranked second in the World Test Championship, are set to play a Test series against Australia. He said that he is going to travel to Australia and India to play 4 Test matches. Will India advance to the finals? ‚Äì The Indian team has so far completed four series under the 2021-23 Test Championship. It includes two domestic and two overseas Test series. India has won 2 of those series. 1 streak ended in a loss and 1 streak ended in a draw. India have played a total of 12 matches with 6 wins, 4 losses and 2 draws.
