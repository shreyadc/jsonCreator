Kushan WIjerama led their bowling attack with a four wicket haul for St. Servatius’ to restrict Maris Stella for 110 runs in reply to their 199. But in their second essay, St. Servatius’ were given an early scare as their top order collapsed (4 for 59) against the left-arm spin of Hasindu Perera, who completed a match bag of nine wickets. That was when Abeywickramasinghe and Vishwa Supun combined to disappoint Maris Stella. The duo put on 109 runs for the fifth wicket to douse any threat of a fightback from Maris Stella. Abeywickramasinghe made 115 inclusive of six fours and two sixes as he faced 125 balls. Vishwa Supun’s 43 runs came in 48 balls. Abeywickramasinghe’s century helped them reach 211 for six wickets at close. In their first innings, St. Servatius’ scored 199 runs, thanks largely to a half-century made by Viran Chamuditha. For Maris Stella, Hasindu Perera was the pick of the bowlers.

MJ has been on the Sri Lanka Cricket payroll since last year as a consultant coach and his job description requires putting up a structure for cricket. But it is all too evident that he runs the show from behind the scenes be it selecting the coaches or players. Both SLC and the national selection panel have been more than happy to tap into MJ’s vast knowledge and carry out his instructions but there has been not much accountability on his part, it has been felt. He has been requested to take over as Chairman of Selectors with the national team in a crisis. MJ though on previous instances has turned down to commit himself full-time. Recently, the Sports Ministry appointed a Technical Committee headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya. Ashantha de Mel, Kapil Wijegunawardene, Charith Senanayake and Farveez Maharof are other members of the committee. The committee told the Minister of Sports Roshan Ranasinghe that all stakeholders of the sport need to work together to ensure that the national cricket team had a smooth World Cup qualifier in June in Zimbabwe. The Technical Committee has categorically said that they do not have a bone to pick with anyone but were keen to work towards ensuring the team came out of the current slump. Of their last 15 matches, Sri Lanka have won only three and lost 12 games across all three formats. Batting collapses have been all too frequent in that period and things went from bad to worse in New Zealand during the recent series despite the team having two batting coaches Naveed Nawaz and Thilina Kandamby. A plan will be put in place to ensure that Sri Lanka has a smooth qualifying round in Zimbabwe. Questions have been also asked about benching half a dozen seniors from the 50-over format. Although some of the young players have impressed in the 50-over format, the team’s inability to bat out 50 overs has been exposed all too often. The role of Dasun Shanaka as captain of the ODI team has also been questioned. Shanaka’s performance in the 50-over format has been patchy.

The reciprocal biennial event, which has been in existence for over three decades, covers five disciplines, namely, cricket, golf, tennis, badminton, and billiards/snooker. The team from the apex body of UPASI Sports Club was scheduled to visit in 2019, but due to travel restrictions brought about by the pandemic, the event was postponed to 2023. Nevertheless, both associations were thrilled to come together once again for the much-anticipated sports festival.

The Kiwis, led by Tom Latham, will play five T20Is and as many ODI matches against Pakistan. After resting for two days in Lahore, New Zealand squad will take part in a training session on April 13 here at the Gaddafi Stadium. The first T20I between the two sides is scheduled to take place on April 14 at iconic Gaddafi Stadium. After reaching Pakistan, New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell said that they are very excited about the T20 and ODI series in Pakistan. “There are young players in the team who have not played in these conditions before,” he said. Terming the Pakistan tour a “challenging” one, the player said that Pakistan has a worldclass team. “Conditions are quite different here from New Zealand and young players will gain experience. The series is quite long. We will try to play good cricket,” he added. Meanwhile, Pakistan team new head coach Grant Bradburn expressed his delight at returning to Pakistan and being warmly welcomed by the team and the people of Pakistan. Bradburn have been appointed head coach for the New Zealand series and arrived in Lahore on Tuesday morning. The 56-year-old has a longstanding relationship with Pakistan cricket, having first visited the country in 1990 as part of the New Zealand team. Then, he worked as Pakistan’s fielding coach for three years and resigned in October 2021, citing family reasons and pursuit of “further coaching opportunities”. “It is wonderful to be back and really nice to have such a warm welcome. It’s an honor to be back and serving Pakistan,” Bradburn said. “I first arrived in Pakistan in 1990 with a New Zealand team and then had three wonderful years working with the team and all the coaches in Pakistan during 2019 to 2021,” he added. “I am really looking forward to be working alongside Mickey Arthur and also the players and staff of this team. “There is so much talent in this team and I am looking forward to getting along them and perhaps influencing them to make some real positive change,” he asserted.","pubDate":"2023-04-11 23:53:10","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-12/new-zealand-team-arrives-in-pakistan-ahead-of-limited-overs-series-1681257186-1903.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"PCB prefers two venues for World Cup matches in India","link":"https://www.nation.com.pk/12-Apr-2023/pcb-prefers-two-venues-for-world-cup-matches-in-india","keywords":["Sports, Newspaper"],"creator":["Agencies"],"video_url":null,"description":"LAHORE - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is keen on ensuring that the Men in Green’s ICC World Cup 2023 matches are held in Chennai and Kolkata, according to Press Trust of India.","content":"LAHORE - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is keen on ensuring that the Men in Green’s ICC World Cup 2023 matches are held in Chennai and Kolkata, according to Press Trust of India. The World Cup is likely to start on October 5, with 46 matches set to be held across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati, Hyderabad and Dharamasala. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai,” a source close to ICC Board told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” the source added. Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the tournament is still under wraps as geopolitics cloud the buildup to the showpiece event. The delay is in stark contrast to the 2019 event, when the dates and venues for the tournament in England and Wales were announced more than a year out in keeping with usual practice for major sporting events. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has previously co-hosted three ODI World Cups and organising the 10-team event in October-November should present no major difficulties for the world’s richest board. However, soured political relations between India and Pakistan, who play each other only in multi-team events, have complicated matters. India have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and are likely to play their matches at a neutral venue after organisers agreed on a ‘hybrid’ model — a move that looks likely to prompt a titfor-tat response. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied media reports that it had made a similar demand at the ICC board meetings in Dubai last month but in a statement last week said it may push for the hybrid model “at the proper ICC forum at the right time”. Should Pakistan agree to travel to India, the BCCI would have to secure visa clearance from the Indian government. A source with direct knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that moving matches out of India had not even been discussed and the fixtures would be announced in “due course”.","pubDate":"2023-04-11 23:50:16","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-12/pcb-prefers-two-venues-for-world-cup-matches-in-india-1681257005-6931.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies U-19 cricketers to Sri Lanka after two decades","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/West-Indies-U-19-cricketers-to-Sri-Lanka-after-two-decades/23-747313","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"West Indies Under-19 cricketers are due to make a tour of Sri Lanka after almost two decades in July-August. The tour is part of Sri Lanka’s preparations for the ICC Under-19 World Cup, which Sri Lanka are the hosts. West Indies are due to play Sri Lanka in an Under-19 series consisting of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs. It will be the first time that these two countries will be involved in playing 4-day tests. Bilateral ODIs they have played before a long time back as far as 2004 when West Indies and Sri Lanka drew a four-match ODI series 2-all in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was led by all-rounder Farveez Maharoof and West Indies by wicket-keeper/batsman Denesh Ramdin. That series produced players in the caliber of Maharoof, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara and Kaushal Silva who went onto represent Sri Lanka at international level, and Ramdin, Xavier Marshall, Assad Fudadin, Lendl Simmons, Kirk Edwards, and Lionel Baker for West Indies. Between 1988 and 2022, Sri Lanka and West Indies have played 15 Under-19 ODIs of which Sri Lanka have won 8 and West Indies 7. Sri Lanka Under-19 are also scheduled to go to Pakistan in November for a series of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs and then participate in the Under-19 Asia Cup in Bangladesh in December before the Under19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in January 2024. “What we are trying to do is play against club teams regularly every month. We did a little bit of that before we left for UAE against the Under-23 team and against Jaffna NSL side. We have arranged for us to play against higher ranked teams – clubs and NSL every month,” said Sri Lanka Under-19 head coach Jehan Mubarak who is of the view that schoolboys who Captain their teams and the national Under-19 teams should be able to make decisions on the field rather than get help from coaches. “When I was coaching at Royal College (Colombo) they liked to be given the solution,” said Mubarak who has been in the system with schoolboys to understand their way of thinking. “I had this problem where the solution became the coaches and not the players. We can guide them but at the end of the day they have to call their game, so that when they progress to the Under-19 program they are able to make decisions on their own.” Apart from coaching Royal College for about three years Mubarak also had a stint as coach of Bloomfield. “I’ve been on the Royal College advisory committee for about 10-15 years. I understand their mindset a little bit, how they think. Also the parents are important. We need to have a chat about the players’ lifestyle. How to tackle social media, how to spend the money they get into their hands wisely and things like that.\" In Mubarak’s book, fielding is top priority. “Cricket for me is being the best fielding side. Whatever your age Sri Lanka should always be the best fielding team whether it is U-19 or the senior national team. Fielding doesn’t need a lot of skills, it just needs hard work.” “Being a good fielding side helps to lift the standard of the team. It puts pressure on the batsmen because the fielders are always in the game. The facet of becoming a good fielding team means that you have to be mentally strong. You do a lot of hard work, so you have pushed a lot of mental barriers. Even in match situations when things are not going your way, because you’ve done the hard work you don’t want to give up so easily. Also you play for each other if you have a good fielding team. You play better as a team. I could see that on the tour of the UAE.”","pubDate":"2023-04-11 20:41:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Planters Association of Ceylon, United Planters of Southern India Sports Club conducts Biennial Sports Festival","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Planters-Association-of-Ceylon--United-Planters-of-Southern-India-Sports-Club-conducts-Biennial-Sports-Festival/23-747309","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Planters Association of Ceylon (PA) and United Planters of Southern India Sports Club (UPASI SC) successfully concluded their Biennial sports festival held from 23 to 28 March 2023.

The reciprocal biennial event, which has been in existence for over three decades, covers five disciplines, namely, cricket, golf, tennis, badminton, and billiards/snooker. The team from the apex body of UPASI Sports Club was scheduled to visit in 2019, but due to travel restrictions brought about by the pandemic, the event was postponed to 2023. Nevertheless, both associations were thrilled to come together once again for the much-anticipated sports festival. Regional plantation companies showed their colours this year by winning the annual golf tournament after a lapse of 20 years, with Tharindu Wickramasinghe excelling and winning the overall team winner award and clinching the title of ‘Stable Ford’. In addition, the Plantation Association (PA) team also won the cricket and badminton tournaments at the annual event. One of the highlights of the event was the outstanding performance by batsman Chathura Bandara, who scored a fantastic century and took home the awards for ‘best batsman’ and ‘man of the match’. The PA badminton team emerged victorious with an outstanding performance by Chamith Arthur in the singles event while Rohan Weerakoone and Lalindra Abeywardena won in the veteran doubles. Furthermore, Chamith Arthur and Bandara Vitharana defeated their opponents in the doubles. The Planters’ Association of Ceylon were declared the overall champion of the biennial sports festival and was awarded the Malin Goonetileke Trophy for winning three out of the five sporting events. “This sporting event symbolizes the camaraderie between the Planters’ Association of Ceylon and the UPASI Sports Team.

MJ has been on the Sri Lanka Cricket payroll since last year as a consultant coach and his job description requires putting up a structure for cricket. But it is all too evident that he runs the show from behind the scenes be it selecting the coaches or players. Both SLC and the national selection panel have been more than happy to tap into MJ’s vast knowledge and carry out his instructions but there has been not much accountability on his part, it has been felt. He has been requested to take over as Chairman of Selectors with the national team in a crisis. MJ though on previous instances has turned down to commit himself full-time. Recently, the Sports Ministry appointed a Technical Committee headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya. Ashantha de Mel, Kapil Wijegunawardene, Charith Senanayake and Farveez Maharof are other members of the committee. The committee told the Minister of Sports Roshan Ranasinghe that all stakeholders of the sport need to work together to ensure that the national cricket team had a smooth World Cup qualifier in June in Zimbabwe. The Technical Committee has categorically said that they do not have a bone to pick with anyone but were keen to work towards ensuring the team came out of the current slump. Of their last 15 matches, Sri Lanka have won only three and lost 12 games across all three formats. Batting collapses have been all too frequent in that period and things went from bad to worse in New Zealand during the recent series despite the team having two batting coaches Naveed Nawaz and Thilina Kandamby. A plan will be put in place to ensure that Sri Lanka has a smooth qualifying round in Zimbabwe. Questions have been also asked about benching half a dozen seniors from the 50-over format. Although some of the young players have impressed in the 50-over format, the team’s inability to bat out 50 overs has been exposed all too often. The role of Dasun Shanaka as captain of the ODI team has also been questioned. Shanaka’s performance in the 50-over format has been patchy.

The first T20I between the two sides is scheduled to take place on April 14 at iconic Gaddafi Stadium. After reaching Pakistan, New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell said that they are very excited about the T20 and ODI series in Pakistan. “There are young players in the team who have not played in these conditions before,” he said. Terming the Pakistan tour a “challenging” one, the player said that Pakistan has a worldclass team. “Conditions are quite different here from New Zealand and young players will gain experience. The series is quite long. We will try to play good cricket,” he added.

Bradburn have been appointed head coach for the New Zealand series and arrived in Lahore on Tuesday morning. The 56-year-old has a longstanding relationship with Pakistan cricket, having first visited the country in 1990 as part of the New Zealand team. Then, he worked as Pakistan’s fielding coach for three years and resigned in October 2021, citing family reasons and pursuit of “further coaching opportunities”. “It is wonderful to be back and really nice to have such a warm welcome.

The World Cup is likely to start on October 5, with 46 matches set to be held across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati, Hyderabad and Dharamasala. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai,” a source close to ICC Board told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” the source added. Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the tournament is still under wraps as geopolitics cloud the buildup to the showpiece event. The delay is in stark contrast to the 2019 event, when the dates and venues for the tournament in England and Wales were announced more than a year out in keeping with usual practice for major sporting events. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has previously co-hosted three ODI World Cups and organising the 10-team event in October-November should present no major difficulties for the world’s richest board. However, soured political relations between India and Pakistan, who play each other only in multi-team events, have complicated matters. India have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and are likely to play their matches at a neutral venue after organisers agreed on a ‘hybrid’ model — a move that looks likely to prompt a titfor-tat response. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied media reports that it had made a similar demand at the ICC board meetings in Dubai last month but in a statement last week said it may push for the hybrid model “at the proper ICC forum at the right time”. Should Pakistan agree to travel to India, the BCCI would have to secure visa clearance from the Indian government. A source with direct knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that moving matches out of India had not even been discussed and the fixtures would be announced in “due course”.","pubDate":"2023-04-11 23:50:16","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-12/pcb-prefers-two-venues-for-world-cup-matches-in-india-1681257005-6931.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies U-19 cricketers to Sri Lanka after two decades","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/West-Indies-U-19-cricketers-to-Sri-Lanka-after-two-decades/23-747313","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"West Indies Under-19 cricketers are due to make a tour of Sri Lanka after almost two decades in July-August. The tour is part of Sri Lanka’s preparations for the ICC Under-19 World Cup, which Sri Lanka are the hosts. West Indies are due to play Sri Lanka in an Under-19 series consisting of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs. It will be the first time that these two countries will be involved in playing 4-day tests. Bilateral ODIs they have played before a long time back as far as 2004 when West Indies and Sri Lanka drew a four-match ODI series 2-all in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was led by all-rounder Farveez Maharoof and West Indies by wicket-keeper/batsman Denesh Ramdin. That series produced players in the caliber of Maharoof, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara and Kaushal Silva who went onto represent Sri Lanka at international level, and Ramdin, Xavier Marshall, Assad Fudadin, Lendl Simmons, Kirk Edwards, and Lionel Baker for West Indies. Between 1988 and 2022, Sri Lanka and West Indies have played 15 Under-19 ODIs of which Sri Lanka have won 8 and West Indies 7. Sri Lanka Under-19 are also scheduled to go to Pakistan in November for a series of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs and then participate in the Under-19 Asia Cup in Bangladesh in December before the Under19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in January 2024. “What we are trying to do is play against club teams regularly every month. We did a little bit of that before we left for UAE against the Under-23 team and against Jaffna NSL side. We have arranged for us to play against higher ranked teams – clubs and NSL every month,” said Sri Lanka Under-19 head coach Jehan Mubarak who is of the view that schoolboys who Captain their teams and the national Under-19 teams should be able to make decisions on the field rather than get help from coaches. “When I was coaching at Royal College (Colombo) they liked to be given the solution,” said Mubarak who has been in the system with schoolboys to understand their way of thinking. “I had this problem where the solution became the coaches and not the players. We can guide them but at the end of the day they have to call their game, so that when they progress to the Under-19 program they are able to make decisions on their own.” Apart from coaching Royal College for about three years Mubarak also had a stint as coach of Bloomfield. “I’ve been on the Royal College advisory committee for about 10-15 years. I understand their mindset a little bit, how they think. Also the parents are important. We need to have a chat about the players’ lifestyle. How to tackle social media, how to spend the money they get into their hands wisely and things like that.\" In Mubarak’s book, fielding is top priority. “Cricket for me is being the best fielding side. Whatever your age Sri Lanka should always be the best fielding team whether it is U-19 or the senior national team. Fielding doesn’t need a lot of skills, it just needs hard work.” “Being a good fielding side helps to lift the standard of the team. It puts pressure on the batsmen because the fielders are always in the game. The facet of becoming a good fielding team means that you have to be mentally strong. You do a lot of hard work, so you have pushed a lot of mental barriers. Even in match situations when things are not going your way, because you’ve done the hard work you don’t want to give up so easily. Also you play for each other if you have a good fielding team. You play better as a team. I could see that on the tour of the UAE.”","pubDate":"2023-04-11 20:41:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Planters Association of Ceylon, United Planters of Southern India Sports Club conducts Biennial Sports Festival","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Planters-Association-of-Ceylon--United-Planters-of-Southern-India-Sports-Club-conducts-Biennial-Sports-Festival/23-747309","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Planters Association of Ceylon (PA) and United Planters of Southern India Sports Club (UPASI SC) successfully concluded their Biennial sports festival held from 23 to 28 March 2023.

MJ has been on the Sri Lanka Cricket payroll since last year as a consultant coach and his job description requires putting up a structure for cricket. But it is all too evident that he runs the show from behind the scenes be it selecting the coaches or players. Both SLC and the national selection panel have been more than happy to tap into MJ’s vast knowledge and carry out his instructions but there has been not much accountability on his part, it has been felt. He has been requested to take over as Chairman of Selectors with the national team in a crisis. MJ though on previous instances has turned down to commit himself full-time. Recently, the Sports Ministry appointed a Technical Committee headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya. Ashantha de Mel, Kapil Wijegunawardene, Charith Senanayake and Farveez Maharof are other members of the committee. The committee told the Minister of Sports Roshan Ranasinghe that all stakeholders of the sport need to work together to ensure that the national cricket team had a smooth World Cup qualifier in June in Zimbabwe. The Technical Committee has categorically said that they do not have a bone to pick with anyone but were keen to work towards ensuring the team came out of the current slump. Of their last 15 matches, Sri Lanka have won only three and lost 12 games across all three formats. Batting collapses have been all too frequent in that period and things went from bad to worse in New Zealand during the recent series despite the team having two batting coaches Naveed Nawaz and Thilina Kandamby. A plan will be put in place to ensure that Sri Lanka has a smooth qualifying round in Zimbabwe. Questions have been also asked about benching half a dozen seniors from the 50-over format. Although some of the young players have impressed in the 50-over format, the team’s inability to bat out 50 overs has been exposed all too often. The role of Dasun Shanaka as captain of the ODI team has also been questioned. Shanaka’s performance in the 50-over format has been patchy. Published on By A century by Diniru Abeywickramasinghe was the highlight on the second day as St. Servatius’ College, Matara secured first innings points to clinch the title of the Under 19 Division I Tier ‘B’ cricket tournament at Ace Capital ground at Kirimandala Mawatha on Tuesday. Kushan WIjerama led their bowling attack with a four wicket haul for St. Servatius’ to restrict Maris Stella for 110 runs in reply to their 199. But in their second essay, St. Servatius’ were given an early scare as their top order collapsed (4 for 59) against the left-arm spin of Hasindu Perera, who completed a match bag of nine wickets. That was when Abeywickramasinghe and Vishwa Supun combined to disappoint Maris Stella. The duo put on 109 runs for the fifth wicket to douse any threat of a fightback from Maris Stella. Abeywickramasinghe made 115 inclusive of six fours and two sixes as he faced 125 balls. Vishwa Supun’s 43 runs came in 48 balls. Abeywickramasinghe’s century helped them reach 211 for six wickets at close. In their first innings, St. Servatius’ scored 199 runs, thanks largely to a half-century made by Viran Chamuditha. For Maris Stella, Hasindu Perera was the pick of the bowlers.

After resting for two days in Lahore, New Zealand squad will take part in a training session on April 13 here at the Gaddafi Stadium. The first T20I between the two sides is scheduled to take place on April 14 at iconic Gaddafi Stadium. After reaching Pakistan, New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell said that they are very excited about the T20 and ODI series in Pakistan. “There are young players in the team who have not played in these conditions before,” he said. Terming the Pakistan tour a “challenging” one, the player said that Pakistan has a worldclass team. “Conditions are quite different here from New Zealand and young players will gain experience. The series is quite long. We will try to play good cricket,” he added. Meanwhile, Pakistan team new head coach Grant Bradburn expressed his delight at returning to Pakistan and being warmly welcomed by the team and the people of Pakistan. Bradburn have been appointed head coach for the New Zealand series and arrived in Lahore on Tuesday morning. The 56-year-old has a longstanding relationship with Pakistan cricket, having first visited the country in 1990 as part of the New Zealand team. Then, he worked as Pakistan’s fielding coach for three years and resigned in October 2021, citing family reasons and pursuit of “further coaching opportunities”. “It is wonderful to be back and really nice to have such a warm welcome.

The World Cup is likely to start on October 5, with 46 matches set to be held across 12 Indian cities, including Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mumbai, Rajkot, Bengaluru, Delhi, Indore, Guwahati, Hyderabad and Dharamasala. “A lot will depend on what BCCI and the Indian government decide but given a choice, Pakistan will like to play most of its World Cup matches in Kolkata and Chennai,” a source close to ICC Board told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “In Kolkata, Pakistan played its T20 World Cup game against India in 2016 and the players were very happy with the security. Similarly, Chennai as a venue remains memorable for Pakistan. It’s also about feeling safe at specific venues,” the source added. Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the tournament is still under wraps as geopolitics cloud the buildup to the showpiece event. The delay is in stark contrast to the 2019 event, when the dates and venues for the tournament in England and Wales were announced more than a year out in keeping with usual practice for major sporting events. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has previously co-hosted three ODI World Cups and organising the 10-team event in October-November should present no major difficulties for the world’s richest board. However, soured political relations between India and Pakistan, who play each other only in multi-team events, have complicated matters. India have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and are likely to play their matches at a neutral venue after organisers agreed on a ‘hybrid’ model — a move that looks likely to prompt a titfor-tat response. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied media reports that it had made a similar demand at the ICC board meetings in Dubai last month but in a statement last week said it may push for the hybrid model “at the proper ICC forum at the right time”. Should Pakistan agree to travel to India, the BCCI would have to secure visa clearance from the Indian government. A source with direct knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that moving matches out of India had not even been discussed and the fixtures would be announced in “due course”.","pubDate":"2023-04-11 23:50:16","image_url":"https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2023-04-12/pcb-prefers-two-venues-for-world-cup-matches-in-india-1681257005-6931.jpg","source_id":"nation_pk","category":["sports"],"country":["pakistan"],"language":"english"},{"title":"West Indies U-19 cricketers to Sri Lanka after two decades","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/West-Indies-U-19-cricketers-to-Sri-Lanka-after-two-decades/23-747313","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"West Indies Under-19 cricketers are due to make a tour of Sri Lanka after almost two decades in July-August. The tour is part of Sri Lanka’s preparations for the ICC Under-19 World Cup, which Sri Lanka are the hosts. West Indies are due to play Sri Lanka in an Under-19 series consisting of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs. It will be the first time that these two countries will be involved in playing 4-day tests. Bilateral ODIs they have played before a long time back as far as 2004 when West Indies and Sri Lanka drew a four-match ODI series 2-all in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was led by all-rounder Farveez Maharoof and West Indies by wicket-keeper/batsman Denesh Ramdin. That series produced players in the caliber of Maharoof, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara and Kaushal Silva who went onto represent Sri Lanka at international level, and Ramdin, Xavier Marshall, Assad Fudadin, Lendl Simmons, Kirk Edwards, and Lionel Baker for West Indies. Between 1988 and 2022, Sri Lanka and West Indies have played 15 Under-19 ODIs of which Sri Lanka have won 8 and West Indies 7. Sri Lanka Under-19 are also scheduled to go to Pakistan in November for a series of two 4-day tests and 3 ODIs and then participate in the Under-19 Asia Cup in Bangladesh in December before the Under19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in January 2024. “What we are trying to do is play against club teams regularly every month. We did a little bit of that before we left for UAE against the Under-23 team and against Jaffna NSL side. We have arranged for us to play against higher ranked teams – clubs and NSL every month,” said Sri Lanka Under-19 head coach Jehan Mubarak who is of the view that schoolboys who Captain their teams and the national Under-19 teams should be able to make decisions on the field rather than get help from coaches. “When I was coaching at Royal College (Colombo) they liked to be given the solution,” said Mubarak who has been in the system with schoolboys to understand their way of thinking. “I had this problem where the solution became the coaches and not the players. We can guide them but at the end of the day they have to call their game, so that when they progress to the Under-19 program they are able to make decisions on their own.” Apart from coaching Royal College for about three years Mubarak also had a stint as coach of Bloomfield. “I’ve been on the Royal College advisory committee for about 10-15 years. I understand their mindset a little bit, how they think. Also the parents are important. We need to have a chat about the players’ lifestyle. How to tackle social media, how to spend the money they get into their hands wisely and things like that.\" In Mubarak’s book, fielding is top priority. “Cricket for me is being the best fielding side. Whatever your age Sri Lanka should always be the best fielding team whether it is U-19 or the senior national team. Fielding doesn’t need a lot of skills, it just needs hard work.” “Being a good fielding side helps to lift the standard of the team. It puts pressure on the batsmen because the fielders are always in the game. The facet of becoming a good fielding team means that you have to be mentally strong. You do a lot of hard work, so you have pushed a lot of mental barriers. Even in match situations when things are not going your way, because you’ve done the hard work you don’t want to give up so easily. Also you play for each other if you have a good fielding team. You play better as a team. I could see that on the tour of the UAE.”","pubDate":"2023-04-11 20:41:26","image_url":null,"source_id":"ft_lk","category":["sports"],"country":["Sri Lanka"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Planters Association of Ceylon, United Planters of Southern India Sports Club conducts Biennial Sports Festival","link":"https://www.ft.lk/sports/Planters-Association-of-Ceylon--United-Planters-of-Southern-India-Sports-Club-conducts-Biennial-Sports-Festival/23-747309","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":"The Planters Association of Ceylon (PA) and United Planters of Southern India Sports Club (UPASI SC) successfully concluded their Biennial sports festival held from 23 to 28 March 2023.
