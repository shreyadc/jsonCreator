It called for EDI measures to be included in a new code for football governance, and for the regulator to have powers to mandate and assess EDI action plans put together by clubs. The Government is committed to legislating for an independent regulator for English football (IREF), with Sports Minister Stuart Andrew telling supporters in Manchester last weekend that it would be one of the first bills to progress after the King’s Speech in the autumn. However, the Government said in its white paper on football governance published in February that it did not believe EDI matters should fall within the immediate scope of the regulator, something which frustrated anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, particularly given the fan-led review had recommended EDI be in the regulator’s remit. The CMS committee says it is “sceptical” football will come up with suitable collective standards by itself, given the “limited progress” it has observed. A report from the committee, which recommended the Government set up the regulator in shadow form by the end of the year, stated: “We are concerned that the Government has ignored recommendations to include EDI Action Plans for clubs and oversight of these plans within IREF’s remit. “We believe that IREF would be well placed to receive and publish standardised data on compliance with EDI requirements in football, as well as monitoring and enforcing compliance with equality standards through EDI Action Plans. “We recommend that the Government should give IREF the authority to mandate EDI Action Plans as part of its threshold licence conditions for clubs. Clubs’ performances against these Action Plans should be assessed regularly by IREF as part of its routine licence reviews.” Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett welcomed the committee’s recommendation and added: “Football has dragged its heels for too long when making the change needed to make it a more welcoming sport. “There is still a lack of diversity in boardrooms, coaching and refereeing, while players and fans suffer from discrimination from the professional game down to grassroots. There has been progress, but a lack of collaboration and few solid outcomes over the past decade mean it’s time for the process to be accelerated. “That is why we endorse the recommendations, already made in the fan-led review, that EDI measures are included in the new Code for Football Governance, and that action plans are part of a club’s licensing conditions. “Placing equality, diversity and inclusion at the heart of football’s governance will help the game grow, therefore safeguarding it for future generations.” The Government will hold roundtable meetings over the coming months to drive forward EDI initiatives across the football pyramid as it continues to engage with the FA, leagues, fan representatives and civil society organisations. The regulator should also set “substantially higher” fan engagement standards rather than accepting existing Premier League standards as the baseline, the committee said. Football’s authorities were also warned to “get their act together” on a new financial agreement between the Premier League, the EFL and the FA, with the new regulator set to be given backstop powers to impose a solution via arbitration if one cannot be reached amongst themselves. However, the PA news agency understands talks over the ‘New Deal For Football’ are progressing well, with regular talks taking place between the three bodies.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 23:02:56","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16791554/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket discrimination report ‘depressing’: MCC","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/cricket-discrimination-report-depressing-mcc/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"A report detailing discrimination in English and Welsh cricket makes for “depressing reading”, according to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender.","content":"H-Metro A report detailing discrimination in English and Welsh cricket makes for “depressing reading”, according to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender. The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) said racism, sexism, classism and elitism are “widespread” across the game. The report also recommended annual games between Eton and Harrow schools and Oxford and Cambridge universities at Lord’s should be removed, and Lavender said this would be reviewed. In all, the ICEC has made 44 recommendations, including that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) makes an unreserved public apology for its failings, which ECB chair Richard Thompson has done. “My overwhelming feeling really was one of sadness that there are a great number of people have been let down by the game,” Lavender told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I think Richard Thompson’s apology on behalf of the game was entirely right. “The real fact of the matter is we’re doing quite a lot to try and address these issues, but there’s more that we need to do. “I think our challenge as a game now and our challenge as a club, is to say what are we going to do in terms of the recommendations that Cindy Butts the chair of the commission has come up with – and that’s a process that’s going to take place really for the next three months.” Lavender also addressed the fact that the report highlighted that England’s women have never played a Test at Lord’s, while the “home of cricket” continues to host an annual schools fixture between Eton and Harrow and the university match between Cambridge and Oxford. The MCC’s executive had originally decided to relocate the Eton-Harrow and Cambridge-Oxford games from Lord’s but kept them at the ground until at least 2027 following complaints from MCC members. “I think we need to review that in light of the report in the next few months,” said Lavender. “Any reasonable-minded listener would view that you’ve got to work out whether you can do both. Whether that’s good enough … and the commission’s view was that it wasn’t. “That’s really where we are – how do you balance out tradition and create new opportunities for kids and young people to play at Lord’s?” On England Women playing a Test at Lord’s, he added: “There’s been a general sense, particularly with the ECB, that you want to play some of the women’s international matches in the early days at smaller grounds while you build up a capacity. “But we sold the highest amount of tickets for a women’s international last year, and have surpassed that for the Women’s Ashes this year. “We’ll play a women’s Test in 2026, so we’ve moving in the right direction but there is more to be done.” – BBC Sport","pubDate":"2023-06-29 22:01:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"hmetro_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashes cricket: Australia v England - Second test evenly poised after day two","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/ashes-cricket-australia-v-england-second-test-evenly-poised-after-day-two/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England slashed Australia’s first-innings lead of 416 to 138 after two days of the second Ashes test at Lord’s on Thursday. The bad news for England in comfortably scoring 278 runs was that all four wickets to fall were gifted to Australia. England batted so serenely through the middle session and to an hour past tea — without even Bazballing it — that Australia spread its fielders, vacating the slips in desperate need of a second wicket. And Australia’s fortunes worsened when Nathan Lyon, its only wicket-taker at that point and the teammate who seemingly never gets hurt, injured his right calf while running to a ball in the field and hobbled away with help. He didn’t return and the manner of his exit suggested he may not return for the rest of what is his 100th successive test. Without Lyon’s spin to wear down England, Australia changed its tactics by tempting England with the short ball. England took the bait. Ollie Pope, Ben Duckett and world No. 1 Joe Root recklessly went after short balls and gave catches behind square. Pope spoiled a flowing 97-run stand with Duckett when his pull at Cameron Green sailed straight to Steve Smith at deep backward square leg. Pope made 42 off 63 balls. In the same over, Root had 1 when he gloved a Green bouncer to wicketkeeper Alex Carey and Australia duly celebrated raucously. But Green committed a no-ball, his fifth of six on the day. Root used his life on 1 to pass Allan Border into 10th on the all-time test run-scorers list. But Australia minimized the missed chance by getting Root out for 10, when his pull at Mitchell Starc was brilliantly caught by a diving Smith at backward square. Root reviewed the catch but Smith fairly got his fingers underneath. Before Root was dismissed, Duckett agonizingly missed his second test century at Lord’s this month when he pulled at Josh Hazlewood and top-edged to David Warner at deep fine leg. Duckett had 98 off 134 balls, including nine boundaries. After the mad hour from Lyon limping away to Root’s dismissal, Harry Brook and Ben Stokes calmly steered England to stumps against conventional fields, although Brook got a life on 25 when he pulled Pat Cummins to square leg where Marnus Labuschagne dropped an overhead catch. Brook was on 45 and Stokes on 17 in an unbroken stand of 56. The only wicket to fall in England’s first 188 runs was Zak Crawley’s in the middle session.

Crawley’s partnership of 91 with Duckett was the best by England openers against Australia since 2011 when Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook made 98. That was 32 Ashes tests ago. Travis Head’s off-breaks compensated for Lyon’s absence. Labuschagne’s drop made Cummins the only pacer to go wicketless but he was the most economical. Starc was picked ahead of Scott Boland in the only change by Australia after winning at Edgbaston last week, and Starc finished the day better than he started.

STUMPS | England v Australia, Second Ashes Test, Day 2 England, enjoying the best batting conditions of the match, were well placed at 188-1 in reply to Australia's first innings 416, with the visitors' spin bowler, Nathan Lyon, off the field with a calf injury. But England slumped to 222-4 as Australia bowled bouncers with as many as four men deep on the legside -- a tactic that could scarcely have been more obvious had it been signalled in neon lights. However, at stumps on the second day they had recovered to 278-4 following an unbroken stand of 56 between Harry Brook (45 not out) and captain Ben Stokes (17 not out). The pair had come together after England lost three wickets for 34 runs. England vice-captain Ollie Pope holed out off towering all-rounder Cameron Green after a brisk 42. Ben Duckett had batted superbly to move to within sight of a maiden Ashes hundred. But having had a few near misses with risky hooks, the left-handed opener fell for 98 when he pulled Josh Hazlewood straight to David Warner. Joe Root, the world's top-ranked Test batsman, could have been out caught behind on one when gloving a hook off Green, only to be reprieved by a no-ball. But he fell for 10 when suckered into pulling a short ball from express quick Mitchell Starc, with Steve Smith taking a low running catch. Smith had earlier returned to form with a well-made hundred after managing just 22 runs in two innings during Australia's thrilling two-wicket win in the first Test at Edgbaston. His 110 was the 32nd Test century of the 34-year-old's brilliant career, his 12th in the Ashes and eighth in England. England, however, recovered well on Thursday by taking Australia's last five wickets for the addition of 77 runs. Veteran pacemen James Anderson and Stuart Broad, the two most successful quicks in Test history, managed just two wickets between them. Instead, it was their fellow frontline seamers who did the bulk of the damage, with Josh Tongue taking 3-98 on his Ashes debut and Ollie Robinson 3-100. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon, appearing in his 100th consecutive Test, moved to within four wickets of 500 in Tests when he had Zak Crawley stumped for a run-a-ball 48 to leave England 91-1. But he later limped off the field after trying to catch Pope. Australia had resumed well-placed on 339-5, with Smith 85 not out, just 15 runs shy of his second Test century at Lord's following a superb 215 eight years ago. England failed to make the most of helpful conditions for their quicks after Stokes won the toss on Wednesday. And there were more worrying signs when Stuart Broad speared his first two balls down the legside, Alex Carey glancing both deliveries for comfortable fours. But Broad, regaining his accuracy, had Carey lbw on review for 22. Smith went to 99 with a fortunate nick to third man for four off Anderson, who then almost beat the batsman's defence with an excellent yorker. Off the very next ball, Smith drove Anderson through the covers to complete a 169-ball century with his 14th four. Smith fell soon afterwards when a booming drive off Tongue was superbly caught by a diving Duckett in the gully.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 20:45:33","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Reece Walsh will be OK but what about the referees who are being abused?","link":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/nrl/reece-walsh-will-be-ok-but-what-about-the-referees-who-are-being-abused-20230629-p5dkbn.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Andrew Webster"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sport needs to get serious about how it treats match officials before there are none left.","content":"Even the most seasoned NRL judiciary participants were taken aback by the profanities being dropped at the Reece Walsh hearing at League Central on Wednesday night. When Patrick Carrigan and David Fifita appeared as witnesses, they initially struggled to utter the words “f---” and “c---” in front of a room of sophisticated people, which it was if you excluded the journalists. The players were urged to speak freely and, before you knew it, everyone was dropping f-and-c-bombs like they were extras in a Scorsese movie. Good on them. That’s what judiciaries are for: swearing like a wharfie, loud and proud with total impunity. I might hip-drop a random on the street this weekend just to get a start. Heaven knows you can’t swear like that in a newsroom any longer. Nor in public. Not even on a football field, really, given open microphones on the sidelines and the referee have been in play for years. If there’s a time and place when you cannot swear, it’s when you are speaking to a referee. That’s never changed. Unless you’re the captain, you shouldn’t really be speaking to the referee anyway. Reece Walsh appears at Tuesday’s judiciary hearing. Credit: NRL Photos So when Walsh barks at match officials all the way through last Sunday’s loss to the Gold Coast, and then yells “What the f--- do you mean, c---?” in the direction of referee Chris Butler after an unfavourable decision, you expect him to be heavily sanctioned. The judiciary handed him a three-match ban, but it could have been far more. The abuse of match officials at all levels of all sports must end and the rush from Walsh’s teammates and coaches at the Broncos and Queensland to defend him proves it. Cameron Smith , who would rank in the top three referees of all time, reckons Walsh acted poorly but there wasn’t any definitive evidence the comment was directed at Butler, who said in his referee’s report he didn’t hear exactly what was said. “So what’s he being punished for?” Smith asked on SEN Radio. “Poor body language? Aggressive body language?” No, he’s been punished for calling the referee a “c---” . The vision, the audio, and his history not just in this match but others demonstrate Walsh has a problem with how he addresses match officials. Smith and others are blasting the guilty verdict, but I’ll defer to the findings of judiciary chair Geoff Bellew , a Supreme Court judge who once jailed disgraced former detective Roger Rogerson for life in the afternoon before slipping out of his robes and into a judiciary hearing that evening. In the summary of the judgement, which this column has obtained, Bellew tore the evidence of Carrigan and Fifita to shreds. Both had claimed Walsh’s remark was directed at Carrigan. Fifita was all over the shop, at one point admitting Walsh was talking to the referee. David Fifita spoke in defence of Reece Walsh. Credit: NRL Photos “The majority placed little weight on the evidence given by players Carrigan and Fifita,” Bellew wrote. “It was clear from their evidence that each of them had a close relationship with player Walsh, and that in advance of giving evidence, each of them had engaged in separate discussions with him about the incident, and about the evidence that they would give. In the view of the majority, this had a generally adverse effect upon the reliability of the evidence that they gave.” Walsh’s evidence was also considered unreliable after he said he was responding to Carrigan’s remark to “slow your f---ing brain”. “Even accepting that those words were said by player Carrigan, and giving full weight to the fact that tensions were obviously high, the majority took the view that as a matter of common sense, the words said by player Walsh were essentially non-responsive to what had been said to him and were not explicable on the basis of them sharing a ‘close relationship’,” Bellew wrote. “That was particularly so, in circumstances where the evidence of player Walsh was that had understood player Carrigan’s words to mean that he should ‘think and be smart’. If that was his understanding, there was simply no need to ask player Carrigan what he had meant. That factor tended against a conclusion that the words were said to player Carrigan as opposed to the referee.” In other words, Walsh’s argument was so flimsy and didn’t make sense, so it wasn’t considered. Broncos officials and teammates are throwing an arm around their young fullback, saying how he’ll learn from this episode and grow and how they’ve got his back and blah blah blah. The same things were said two years ago when he was busted by police on the Gold Coast with a bag of cocaine. Walsh is being widely supported, but where’s the support and care for the referee? For the touch judge who copped a mouthful from an entitled 20-year-old for doing his job? Where’s the respect for all referees, who are under as much pressure as Walsh but on a fraction of the money? In 2018, leading referee Matt Cecchin opened up to this masthead about the abuse that was driving him out of the game. Reece Walsh had been warned about his behaviour. Credit: Getty After making a controversial - and correct - call in the dying minutes of the World Cup semi-final between Tonga and England in Auckland, Cecchin received an avalanche of death threats on social media, so much so that New Zealand Police and Australian Federal Police noticed it and gave a police escort home to Sydney. That article was supposed to be a line-in-the-sand moment for how we treated match officials. It certainly changed the way I wrote and spoke about them. But, if anything, the abuse has worsened. Ben Cummins still becomes emotional when he talks about the fallout from his controversial decision to reverse a set restart in the 2019 NRL grand final between Canberra and the Roosters. When Jason Paris , the chief executive of Warriors’ sponsor One NZ, accused the referees of cheating earlier this year, it was disturbing how much support he was given. It’s just as bad in other sports. The growing abuse of Super Rugby referees was highlighted earlier this week when Ben O’Keeffe revealed on Instagram the extent of the abuse he received after officiating in the Super Rugby Pacific final between the Chiefs and Crusaders in Hamilton on Saturday. His post was disturbing with direct messages from people threatening to kill, stomp or punch him. Read one: “You should have been in that titan submarine you arse wipe.” O’Keeffe also pointed to the plight of English football referee Anthony Taylor , who was attacked by a mob of angry Roma supporters at an airport in Budapest after their Europa League final defeat to Sevilla earlier this month. “I think back to the referee walking through the airport and his family getting chairs thrown at them,” added O’Keeffe. “I hope my family is never subjected to this but the direction some fans are going now in rugby, I know we are closer than we have ever been.” The NRL is considering tougher sanctions for referee abuse. It should direct the judiciary into longer time on the sidelines. Give Walsh six weeks. Give him 10. I bet he wouldn’t say another word to a ref or touchie for the rest of his career. Referees should also be charged with greater authority to send players from the field, even if they don’t hear what was said. The Bunker rules on every other aspect of what happens on the field — surely that can be broadened to what is said to the whistleblower. They need to be empowered to not tolerate any dissent. Can you imagine how former referee Bill Harrigan , who is considered the best of all time, would have reacted to Walsh’s remark? Former NRL head of refereeing Bill Harrigan. Credit: Dallas Kilponen Mostly, though, the responsibility should fall to the players, who could do worse than go to a junior footy match and watch how parents, and then their children, speak to referees, most of whom are either volunteers or teenagers. This week, I was told about a recent rugby league match being abandoned because of the abuse of the referee. The age group? Under 6s. THE QUOTE “Finally. They see the value.

I would have been gutted with myself if I’d gone away from it, gone into my shell and gloved one behind,” he said. “Ten metres either side and I’ve got a hundred.

We lost a couple of wickets but we’re in a good position. “I was batting with Popey and Rooty but there was not a lot of chat, it was just ‘how do you want to go about this?’. That’s the kind of fun environment we are creating. If you want to back away and hit it over cover for six or do whatever you need to do, then just commit to it. “Popey just said ‘I’m going get inside of it and smack it into the stands’. No-one in that dressing room will be disappointed with how Popey got out, everyone will just be a bit gutted it didn’t go for six.” Earlier in the day Australia’s Steve Smith did manage to make it to a century, scoring 110 as he celebrated his 12th Ashes ton. Only the great Donald Bradman has more in the series, well clear on 19, and Smith had a different perspective on England’s approach. He felt vindicated that Australia’s seamers kept creating openings at a time when they could easily have retreated into defence and credited Ben Stokes, the chief architect of England’s all-out aggression, for restoring an element of calm at the end. “Lord’s has deep pockets, so if you are going to hit it for six you’re going to have to get a fair piece of it. The fielders are there if you don’t,” he said. “We were setting fields and they were taking it on. England are playing this really aggressive brand and they didn’t look like they were holding back. That created opportunities for us. “It was great that we managed to create so many chances on that kind of wicket. It was just Stokesy who changed it. He was only looking to get underneath it, or ride it out. The rest were trying to take it on and we probably didn’t feel as in the game against him as we did with the others.”","pubDate":"2023-06-29 19:42:08","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16945553/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Root surpasses Allan Border, becomes 10th highest run-scorer in Test cricket","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/cricket/2023/jun/30/joe-root-surpasses-allan-border-becomes-10th-highest-run-scorer-in-test-cricket-2589858.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Root accomplished this feat during the 2nd Ashes 2023 match against Australia at Lord's.

In October 2022, NZ Customs intercepted a package at the border addressed to Mr Sharma. Medsafe identified the 26 vials and 2,250 tablets as assorted anabolic agents - all illegal to buy without a prescription or unapproved for medical use in humans - and referred the case to DFSNZ for further investigation. Anabolic agents increase muscle mass and strength and, in the case of Clenbuterol, aid weight loss. They are banned in sport at all times. Side effects from these types of substances can be serious, and include cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, impotence, depression and liver damage. \"This case sends a clear message,\" said DFSNZ Chief Executive Nick Paterson, \"if you play sport, anti-doping rules apply to you, and protect you, whatever your level of competition. Anyone importing or buying banned substances risks a ban from all sport.\" Mr Paterson went on to comment on the significance of the purchase. \"Doping denies clean Kiwi athletes the chance to excel on a level playing field. This is one of the largest import cases we’ve seen - it’s concerning to see such a quantity and combination of substances, and that the individuals ordering these substances may be doing so without medical advice. Nonetheless, we’re pleased to have taken such a substantial quantity of doping material out of circulation. It goes to show the importance of our partnerships with NZ Customs and Medsafe in disrupting the supply chain and protecting athletes at risk of doping.\". NZC’s GM Community, Kent Stead, said the case highlighted the need for awareness in terms of the scope of Drug Free Sport NZ’s programme. \"This serves as a reminder that the Sports Anti-Doping Rules apply to all cricketers registered to an NZC-affiliated club or organisation, regardless of the level in which they compete,\" he said. \"The assumption that it only applies to elite or high-performance athletes is incorrect.\" The substances found in the seizure were: - Nadrol-50, oxymethalone 50mg, 15 bottles x 50 tablets; - Sustanon, sustanon 250mg, 5 x 10ml vials; - Tren-A-100, trenbolone acetate, 100mg/ml, 3 x 10ml vials; - Masteron, drostanolone propionate 100mg/ml, 2 x 10ml vials; - Deca-300, nandrolone decanoate, 300mg/ml, 6 x 10ml vials; - Cyp-300, testosterone cypionate, 300mg/ml, 3 x 10ml vials; - Test Depot, testosterone enanthate, 250mg/ml, 2 x 10 ml vials; - Cypionex, testosterone cypionate, 250mg/ml 5 x 10ml vials; - Clen-40, clenbuterol, 40mcg, 15 bottles x 100 tablets.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 19:19:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["sports"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"},{"title":"वसीम अकरम की यह बात पीसीबी को चुभ जाएगी, विश्व कप के शेड्यूल पर कम नहीं हो रहे नखरे","link":"https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/cricket-news/wasim-akram-slams-pakistan-board-over-world-cup-schedule/articleshow/101373970.cms","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Wasim Akram: पाकिस्तान क्रिकेट टीम के पूर्व दिग्गज तेज गेंदबाज वसीम अकरम ने पाकिस्तान क्रिकेट बोर्ड को लताड़ लगाई है। विश्व कप के शेड्यूल पर नखरे दिखा रहे पीसीबी से वसीम अकरम ने कहा है कि यह कोई गली मोहल्ले का टूर्नामेंट नहीं है।","content":"विश्व कप 2023 के शेड्यूल पर नखरा दिखा रहे पाकिस्तान क्रिकेट बोर्ड को पूर्व तेज गेंदबाज वसीम अकरम ने लताड़ लगाई है। वनडे विश्व कप 2023 का आयोजन भारत में होना है और पीसीबी शेड्यूल के मुताबिक तय किए गए कुछ वेन्यू पर नहीं खेलना चाहता है। ऐसे में वसीम अकरम ने अब एक ऐसी बात कह दी है जिससे पीसीबी को मिर्ची लग जाएगी। वसीम अकरम ने अपने एक बयान में कहा, 'मैं अहंकार में विश्वास रखता हूं। ऐसे में अगर आप सोचते हैं कि आपके पास अहंकार है तो जो हो रहा है वह गलत है तो उसके खिलाफ बोलिए। अगर ऐसा नहीं लगता है तो आगे बढ़िए। हमेशा खुद के लिए एक प्लान तैयार करें और सोचें की हमने जो किया उस पर टिक सकते या नहीं हैं। क्या हम प्लान को पूरा कर सकेंगे? अगर ऐसा नहीं है तो आवाज भी मत उठाइए।' उन्होंने कहा, 'इससे आपका ही मजाक बनेगा। हम सभी अपने देश से प्यार करते हैं और जरूरत पड़ने पर उसके साथ खड़े होंगे। हर देश के साथ ऐसा ही है। अंत में यह एक खेल है। सरकारें आपस में बात करेंगी या नहीं, यह उनकी दिक्कत है।' वेन्यू को लेकर अकरम ने कहा, 'पाकिस्तानी टीम को अहमदाबाद के नरेंद्र मोदी स्टेडियम में खेलने से कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। पाकिस्तानी टीम को जहां भी खेलने के लिए कहा जाएगा वह खेलेगी। हम वेन्यू को लेकर बिना मतलब के अपनी टीम पर दबाव डालने का काम कर रहे हैं।' दरअसल आईसीसी के द्वारा जब विश्व कप 2023 के शेड्यूल को जारी किया तो एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक पाकिस्तान क्रिकेट बोर्ड ने ऑस्ट्रेलिया और अफगानिस्तान के खिलाफ होने वाले मैच की जगह को लेकर आपत्ति जताई है ऐसी बात सामने आई। पाकिस्तानी टीम 20 अक्टूबर को ऑस्ट्रेलिया से बेंगलुरु में जबकि 23 अक्टूबर को चेन्नई में अफगानिस्तान से भिड़ेगी। ये दोनों ही पिच स्पिन गेंदबाजों के लिए मददगार है। ऐसे में पीसीबी चाहती है कि इन दोनों वेन्यू को बदला जाए। इसी को लेकर अब पाकिस्तान के पूर्व क्रिकेटर्स पीसीबी की जमकर लताड़ लगा रहे हैं। वसीम अकरम के अलावा बासित अली और कामरान अकमल भी इस मुद्दे पर पीसीबी की निंदा कर चुके हैं।","pubDate":"2023-06-29 23:30:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"navbharattimes","category":["sports"],"country":["india"],"language":"hindi"},{"title":"Regulator must hold football to account over discrimination, says CMS committee","link":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23623981.regulator-must-hold-football-account-discrimination-says-cms-committee/?ref=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Club action plans on EDI must be mandated and assessed by a regulator, the CMS committee said.","content":"In the week where an independent report found evidence of “deep-rooted” discrimination in cricket, the Culture Media and Sport (CMS) committee insists football cannot be relied on to get its own house in order on equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI). It called for EDI measures to be included in a new code for football governance, and for the regulator to have powers to mandate and assess EDI action plans put together by clubs. The Government is committed to legislating for an independent regulator for English football (IREF), with Sports Minister Stuart Andrew telling supporters in Manchester last weekend that it would be one of the first bills to progress after the King’s Speech in the autumn. However, the Government said in its white paper on football governance published in February that it did not believe EDI matters should fall within the immediate scope of the regulator, something which frustrated anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, particularly given the fan-led review had recommended EDI be in the regulator’s remit. The CMS committee says it is “sceptical” football will come up with suitable collective standards by itself, given the “limited progress” it has observed. A report from the committee, which recommended the Government set up the regulator in shadow form by the end of the year, stated: “We are concerned that the Government has ignored recommendations to include EDI Action Plans for clubs and oversight of these plans within IREF’s remit. “We believe that IREF would be well placed to receive and publish standardised data on compliance with EDI requirements in football, as well as monitoring and enforcing compliance with equality standards through EDI Action Plans. “We recommend that the Government should give IREF the authority to mandate EDI Action Plans as part of its threshold licence conditions for clubs. Clubs’ performances against these Action Plans should be assessed regularly by IREF as part of its routine licence reviews.” Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett welcomed the committee’s recommendation and added: “Football has dragged its heels for too long when making the change needed to make it a more welcoming sport. “There is still a lack of diversity in boardrooms, coaching and refereeing, while players and fans suffer from discrimination from the professional game down to grassroots. There has been progress, but a lack of collaboration and few solid outcomes over the past decade mean it’s time for the process to be accelerated. “That is why we endorse the recommendations, already made in the fan-led review, that EDI measures are included in the new Code for Football Governance, and that action plans are part of a club’s licensing conditions. “Placing equality, diversity and inclusion at the heart of football’s governance will help the game grow, therefore safeguarding it for future generations.” The Government will hold roundtable meetings over the coming months to drive forward EDI initiatives across the football pyramid as it continues to engage with the FA, leagues, fan representatives and civil society organisations. The regulator should also set “substantially higher” fan engagement standards rather than accepting existing Premier League standards as the baseline, the committee said. Football’s authorities were also warned to “get their act together” on a new financial agreement between the Premier League, the EFL and the FA, with the new regulator set to be given backstop powers to impose a solution via arbitration if one cannot be reached amongst themselves. However, the PA news agency understands talks over the ‘New Deal For Football’ are progressing well, with regular talks taking place between the three bodies.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 23:02:56","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16791554/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket discrimination report ‘depressing’: MCC","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/cricket-discrimination-report-depressing-mcc/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"A report detailing discrimination in English and Welsh cricket makes for “depressing reading”, according to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender.","content":"H-Metro A report detailing discrimination in English and Welsh cricket makes for “depressing reading”, according to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender. The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) said racism, sexism, classism and elitism are “widespread” across the game. The report also recommended annual games between Eton and Harrow schools and Oxford and Cambridge universities at Lord’s should be removed, and Lavender said this would be reviewed. In all, the ICEC has made 44 recommendations, including that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) makes an unreserved public apology for its failings, which ECB chair Richard Thompson has done. “My overwhelming feeling really was one of sadness that there are a great number of people have been let down by the game,” Lavender told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I think Richard Thompson’s apology on behalf of the game was entirely right. “The real fact of the matter is we’re doing quite a lot to try and address these issues, but there’s more that we need to do. “I think our challenge as a game now and our challenge as a club, is to say what are we going to do in terms of the recommendations that Cindy Butts the chair of the commission has come up with – and that’s a process that’s going to take place really for the next three months.” Lavender also addressed the fact that the report highlighted that England’s women have never played a Test at Lord’s, while the “home of cricket” continues to host an annual schools fixture between Eton and Harrow and the university match between Cambridge and Oxford. The MCC’s executive had originally decided to relocate the Eton-Harrow and Cambridge-Oxford games from Lord’s but kept them at the ground until at least 2027 following complaints from MCC members. “I think we need to review that in light of the report in the next few months,” said Lavender. “Any reasonable-minded listener would view that you’ve got to work out whether you can do both. Whether that’s good enough … and the commission’s view was that it wasn’t. “That’s really where we are – how do you balance out tradition and create new opportunities for kids and young people to play at Lord’s?” On England Women playing a Test at Lord’s, he added: “There’s been a general sense, particularly with the ECB, that you want to play some of the women’s international matches in the early days at smaller grounds while you build up a capacity. “But we sold the highest amount of tickets for a women’s international last year, and have surpassed that for the Women’s Ashes this year. “We’ll play a women’s Test in 2026, so we’ve moving in the right direction but there is more to be done.” – BBC Sport","pubDate":"2023-06-29 22:01:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"hmetro_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashes cricket: Australia v England - Second test evenly poised after day two","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/ashes-cricket-australia-v-england-second-test-evenly-poised-after-day-two/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England slashed Australia’s first-innings lead of 416 to 138 after two days of the second Ashes test at Lord’s on Thursday.

But Australia minimized the missed chance by getting Root out for 10, when his pull at Mitchell Starc was brilliantly caught by a diving Smith at backward square.

STUMPS | England v Australia, Second Ashes Test, Day 2 England, enjoying the best batting conditions of the match, were well placed at 188-1 in reply to Australia's first innings 416, with the visitors' spin bowler, Nathan Lyon, off the field with a calf injury. But England slumped to 222-4 as Australia bowled bouncers with as many as four men deep on the legside -- a tactic that could scarcely have been more obvious had it been signalled in neon lights. However, at stumps on the second day they had recovered to 278-4 following an unbroken stand of 56 between Harry Brook (45 not out) and captain Ben Stokes (17 not out). The pair had come together after England lost three wickets for 34 runs. England vice-captain Ollie Pope holed out off towering all-rounder Cameron Green after a brisk 42. Ben Duckett had batted superbly to move to within sight of a maiden Ashes hundred. But having had a few near misses with risky hooks, the left-handed opener fell for 98 when he pulled Josh Hazlewood straight to David Warner. Joe Root, the world's top-ranked Test batsman, could have been out caught behind on one when gloving a hook off Green, only to be reprieved by a no-ball. But he fell for 10 when suckered into pulling a short ball from express quick Mitchell Starc, with Steve Smith taking a low running catch. Smith had earlier returned to form with a well-made hundred after managing just 22 runs in two innings during Australia's thrilling two-wicket win in the first Test at Edgbaston. His 110 was the 32nd Test century of the 34-year-old's brilliant career, his 12th in the Ashes and eighth in England. England, however, recovered well on Thursday by taking Australia's last five wickets for the addition of 77 runs. Veteran pacemen James Anderson and Stuart Broad, the two most successful quicks in Test history, managed just two wickets between them. Instead, it was their fellow frontline seamers who did the bulk of the damage, with Josh Tongue taking 3-98 on his Ashes debut and Ollie Robinson 3-100. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon, appearing in his 100th consecutive Test, moved to within four wickets of 500 in Tests when he had Zak Crawley stumped for a run-a-ball 48 to leave England 91-1. But he later limped off the field after trying to catch Pope. Australia had resumed well-placed on 339-5, with Smith 85 not out, just 15 runs shy of his second Test century at Lord's following a superb 215 eight years ago. England failed to make the most of helpful conditions for their quicks after Stokes won the toss on Wednesday. And there were more worrying signs when Stuart Broad speared his first two balls down the legside, Alex Carey glancing both deliveries for comfortable fours. But Broad, regaining his accuracy, had Carey lbw on review for 22. Smith went to 99 with a fortunate nick to third man for four off Anderson, who then almost beat the batsman's defence with an excellent yorker. Off the very next ball, Smith drove Anderson through the covers to complete a 169-ball century with his 14th four. Smith fell soon afterwards when a booming drive off Tongue was superbly caught by a diving Duckett in the gully.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 20:45:33","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Reece Walsh will be OK but what about the referees who are being abused?","link":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/nrl/reece-walsh-will-be-ok-but-what-about-the-referees-who-are-being-abused-20230629-p5dkbn.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Andrew Webster"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sport needs to get serious about how it treats match officials before there are none left.","content":"Even the most seasoned NRL judiciary participants were taken aback by the profanities being dropped at the Reece Walsh hearing at League Central on Wednesday night. When Patrick Carrigan and David Fifita appeared as witnesses, they initially struggled to utter the words “f---” and “c---” in front of a room of sophisticated people, which it was if you excluded the journalists. The players were urged to speak freely and, before you knew it, everyone was dropping f-and-c-bombs like they were extras in a Scorsese movie. Good on them. That’s what judiciaries are for: swearing like a wharfie, loud and proud with total impunity. I might hip-drop a random on the street this weekend just to get a start. Heaven knows you can’t swear like that in a newsroom any longer. Nor in public. Not even on a football field, really, given open microphones on the sidelines and the referee have been in play for years. If there’s a time and place when you cannot swear, it’s when you are speaking to a referee. That’s never changed. Unless you’re the captain, you shouldn’t really be speaking to the referee anyway. Reece Walsh appears at Tuesday’s judiciary hearing. Credit: NRL Photos So when Walsh barks at match officials all the way through last Sunday’s loss to the Gold Coast, and then yells “What the f--- do you mean, c---?” in the direction of referee Chris Butler after an unfavourable decision, you expect him to be heavily sanctioned. The judiciary handed him a three-match ban, but it could have been far more. The abuse of match officials at all levels of all sports must end and the rush from Walsh’s teammates and coaches at the Broncos and Queensland to defend him proves it. Cameron Smith , who would rank in the top three referees of all time, reckons Walsh acted poorly but there wasn’t any definitive evidence the comment was directed at Butler, who said in his referee’s report he didn’t hear exactly what was said. “So what’s he being punished for?” Smith asked on SEN Radio. “Poor body language? Aggressive body language?” No, he’s been punished for calling the referee a “c---” . The vision, the audio, and his history not just in this match but others demonstrate Walsh has a problem with how he addresses match officials. Smith and others are blasting the guilty verdict, but I’ll defer to the findings of judiciary chair Geoff Bellew , a Supreme Court judge who once jailed disgraced former detective Roger Rogerson for life in the afternoon before slipping out of his robes and into a judiciary hearing that evening. In the summary of the judgement, which this column has obtained, Bellew tore the evidence of Carrigan and Fifita to shreds. Both had claimed Walsh’s remark was directed at Carrigan. Fifita was all over the shop, at one point admitting Walsh was talking to the referee. David Fifita spoke in defence of Reece Walsh. Credit: NRL Photos “The majority placed little weight on the evidence given by players Carrigan and Fifita,” Bellew wrote. “It was clear from their evidence that each of them had a close relationship with player Walsh, and that in advance of giving evidence, each of them had engaged in separate discussions with him about the incident, and about the evidence that they would give. In the view of the majority, this had a generally adverse effect upon the reliability of the evidence that they gave.” Walsh’s evidence was also considered unreliable after he said he was responding to Carrigan’s remark to “slow your f---ing brain”. “Even accepting that those words were said by player Carrigan, and giving full weight to the fact that tensions were obviously high, the majority took the view that as a matter of common sense, the words said by player Walsh were essentially non-responsive to what had been said to him and were not explicable on the basis of them sharing a ‘close relationship’,” Bellew wrote. “That was particularly so, in circumstances where the evidence of player Walsh was that had understood player Carrigan’s words to mean that he should ‘think and be smart’. If that was his understanding, there was simply no need to ask player Carrigan what he had meant. That factor tended against a conclusion that the words were said to player Carrigan as opposed to the referee.” In other words, Walsh’s argument was so flimsy and didn’t make sense, so it wasn’t considered. Broncos officials and teammates are throwing an arm around their young fullback, saying how he’ll learn from this episode and grow and how they’ve got his back and blah blah blah. The same things were said two years ago when he was busted by police on the Gold Coast with a bag of cocaine. Walsh is being widely supported, but where’s the support and care for the referee? For the touch judge who copped a mouthful from an entitled 20-year-old for doing his job? Where’s the respect for all referees, who are under as much pressure as Walsh but on a fraction of the money? In 2018, leading referee Matt Cecchin opened up to this masthead about the abuse that was driving him out of the game. Reece Walsh had been warned about his behaviour. Credit: Getty After making a controversial - and correct - call in the dying minutes of the World Cup semi-final between Tonga and England in Auckland, Cecchin received an avalanche of death threats on social media, so much so that New Zealand Police and Australian Federal Police noticed it and gave a police escort home to Sydney. That article was supposed to be a line-in-the-sand moment for how we treated match officials. It certainly changed the way I wrote and spoke about them. But, if anything, the abuse has worsened. Ben Cummins still becomes emotional when he talks about the fallout from his controversial decision to reverse a set restart in the 2019 NRL grand final between Canberra and the Roosters. When Jason Paris , the chief executive of Warriors’ sponsor One NZ, accused the referees of cheating earlier this year, it was disturbing how much support he was given. It’s just as bad in other sports. The growing abuse of Super Rugby referees was highlighted earlier this week when Ben O’Keeffe revealed on Instagram the extent of the abuse he received after officiating in the Super Rugby Pacific final between the Chiefs and Crusaders in Hamilton on Saturday. His post was disturbing with direct messages from people threatening to kill, stomp or punch him. Read one: “You should have been in that titan submarine you arse wipe.” O’Keeffe also pointed to the plight of English football referee Anthony Taylor , who was attacked by a mob of angry Roma supporters at an airport in Budapest after their Europa League final defeat to Sevilla earlier this month. “I think back to the referee walking through the airport and his family getting chairs thrown at them,” added O’Keeffe. “I hope my family is never subjected to this but the direction some fans are going now in rugby, I know we are closer than we have ever been.” The NRL is considering tougher sanctions for referee abuse. It should direct the judiciary into longer time on the sidelines. Give Walsh six weeks. Give him 10. I bet he wouldn’t say another word to a ref or touchie for the rest of his career. Referees should also be charged with greater authority to send players from the field, even if they don’t hear what was said. The Bunker rules on every other aspect of what happens on the field — surely that can be broadened to what is said to the whistleblower. They need to be empowered to not tolerate any dissent. Can you imagine how former referee Bill Harrigan , who is considered the best of all time, would have reacted to Walsh’s remark? Former NRL head of refereeing Bill Harrigan. Credit: Dallas Kilponen Mostly, though, the responsibility should fall to the players, who could do worse than go to a junior footy match and watch how parents, and then their children, speak to referees, most of whom are either volunteers or teenagers. This week, I was told about a recent rugby league match being abandoned because of the abuse of the referee. The age group? Under 6s. THE QUOTE “Finally. They see the value.

That represented a sizeable swing in fortunes after a lethargic first-day performance, but it might have been even better. They had Australia boxed in at 188 for one, but saw Ollie Pope, Duckett and Joe Root all lose their wickets during a sustained barrage of bumpers. A stunning knock, Ben ✊ So unlucky to come up short ❤️ | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) A more cautious approach might have helped them negotiate a frenetic passage of play more safely, but would have been out of character for a team who have spent a year steering into risks and taking the aggressive approach. Duckett is a true believer of the ‘Bazball’ philosophy and was at peace after being caught at fine-leg pulling Josh Hazlewood. “It’s a shot I play and a shot I’ve scored plenty of runs with in my career. I would have been gutted with myself if I’d gone away from it, gone into my shell and gloved one behind,” he said. “Ten metres either side and I’ve got a hundred. Falling so close to three figures here at Lord’s, I was obviously gutted for half-an-hour after, but I’m happy with how I played. I thought it was certainly my best innings in an England shirt. “It’s the way we play our cricket. If they have plans like that and we go into our shell, it would be totally against what we do. We lost a couple of wickets but we’re in a good position. “I was batting with Popey and Rooty but there was not a lot of chat, it was just ‘how do you want to go about this?’. That’s the kind of fun environment we are creating. If you want to back away and hit it over cover for six or do whatever you need to do, then just commit to it. “Popey just said ‘I’m going get inside of it and smack it into the stands’. No-one in that dressing room will be disappointed with how Popey got out, everyone will just be a bit gutted it didn’t go for six.” Earlier in the day Australia’s Steve Smith did manage to make it to a century, scoring 110 as he celebrated his 12th Ashes ton. Only the great Donald Bradman has more in the series, well clear on 19, and Smith had a different perspective on England’s approach. He felt vindicated that Australia’s seamers kept creating openings at a time when they could easily have retreated into defence and credited Ben Stokes, the chief architect of England’s all-out aggression, for restoring an element of calm at the end. “Lord’s has deep pockets, so if you are going to hit it for six you’re going to have to get a fair piece of it. The fielders are there if you don’t,” he said. “We were setting fields and they were taking it on. England are playing this really aggressive brand and they didn’t look like they were holding back. That created opportunities for us. “It was great that we managed to create so many chances on that kind of wicket. It was just Stokesy who changed it. He was only looking to get underneath it, or ride it out. The rest were trying to take it on and we probably didn’t feel as in the game against him as we did with the others.”","pubDate":"2023-06-29 19:42:08","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16945553/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Root surpasses Allan Border, becomes 10th highest run-scorer in Test cricket","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/cricket/2023/jun/30/joe-root-surpasses-allan-border-becomes-10th-highest-run-scorer-in-test-cricket-2589858.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Root accomplished this feat during the 2nd Ashes 2023 match against Australia at Lord's.

In October 2022, NZ Customs intercepted a package at the border addressed to Mr Sharma. Medsafe identified the 26 vials and 2,250 tablets as assorted anabolic agents - all illegal to buy without a prescription or unapproved for medical use in humans - and referred the case to DFSNZ for further investigation. Anabolic agents increase muscle mass and strength and, in the case of Clenbuterol, aid weight loss. They are banned in sport at all times. Side effects from these types of substances can be serious, and include cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, impotence, depression and liver damage. \"This case sends a clear message,\" said DFSNZ Chief Executive Nick Paterson, \"if you play sport, anti-doping rules apply to you, and protect you, whatever your level of competition. Anyone importing or buying banned substances risks a ban from all sport.\" Mr Paterson went on to comment on the significance of the purchase. \"Doping denies clean Kiwi athletes the chance to excel on a level playing field. This is one of the largest import cases we’ve seen - it’s concerning to see such a quantity and combination of substances, and that the individuals ordering these substances may be doing so without medical advice.

It called for EDI measures to be included in a new code for football governance, and for the regulator to have powers to mandate and assess EDI action plans put together by clubs. The Government is committed to legislating for an independent regulator for English football (IREF), with Sports Minister Stuart Andrew telling supporters in Manchester last weekend that it would be one of the first bills to progress after the King’s Speech in the autumn. However, the Government said in its white paper on football governance published in February that it did not believe EDI matters should fall within the immediate scope of the regulator, something which frustrated anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, particularly given the fan-led review had recommended EDI be in the regulator’s remit. The CMS committee says it is “sceptical” football will come up with suitable collective standards by itself, given the “limited progress” it has observed. A report from the committee, which recommended the Government set up the regulator in shadow form by the end of the year, stated: “We are concerned that the Government has ignored recommendations to include EDI Action Plans for clubs and oversight of these plans within IREF’s remit. “We believe that IREF would be well placed to receive and publish standardised data on compliance with EDI requirements in football, as well as monitoring and enforcing compliance with equality standards through EDI Action Plans. “We recommend that the Government should give IREF the authority to mandate EDI Action Plans as part of its threshold licence conditions for clubs. Clubs’ performances against these Action Plans should be assessed regularly by IREF as part of its routine licence reviews.” Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett welcomed the committee’s recommendation and added: “Football has dragged its heels for too long when making the change needed to make it a more welcoming sport. “There is still a lack of diversity in boardrooms, coaching and refereeing, while players and fans suffer from discrimination from the professional game down to grassroots. There has been progress, but a lack of collaboration and few solid outcomes over the past decade mean it’s time for the process to be accelerated. “That is why we endorse the recommendations, already made in the fan-led review, that EDI measures are included in the new Code for Football Governance, and that action plans are part of a club’s licensing conditions. “Placing equality, diversity and inclusion at the heart of football’s governance will help the game grow, therefore safeguarding it for future generations.” The Government will hold roundtable meetings over the coming months to drive forward EDI initiatives across the football pyramid as it continues to engage with the FA, leagues, fan representatives and civil society organisations. The regulator should also set “substantially higher” fan engagement standards rather than accepting existing Premier League standards as the baseline, the committee said. Football’s authorities were also warned to “get their act together” on a new financial agreement between the Premier League, the EFL and the FA, with the new regulator set to be given backstop powers to impose a solution via arbitration if one cannot be reached amongst themselves. However, the PA news agency understands talks over the ‘New Deal For Football’ are progressing well, with regular talks taking place between the three bodies.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 23:02:56","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16791554/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket discrimination report ‘depressing’: MCC","link":"https://www.hmetro.co.zw/cricket-discrimination-report-depressing-mcc/","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["The Herald"],"video_url":null,"description":"A report detailing discrimination in English and Welsh cricket makes for “depressing reading”, according to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender.","content":"H-Metro A report detailing discrimination in English and Welsh cricket makes for “depressing reading”, according to Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender. The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) said racism, sexism, classism and elitism are “widespread” across the game. The report also recommended annual games between Eton and Harrow schools and Oxford and Cambridge universities at Lord’s should be removed, and Lavender said this would be reviewed. In all, the ICEC has made 44 recommendations, including that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) makes an unreserved public apology for its failings, which ECB chair Richard Thompson has done. “My overwhelming feeling really was one of sadness that there are a great number of people have been let down by the game,” Lavender told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I think Richard Thompson’s apology on behalf of the game was entirely right. “The real fact of the matter is we’re doing quite a lot to try and address these issues, but there’s more that we need to do. “I think our challenge as a game now and our challenge as a club, is to say what are we going to do in terms of the recommendations that Cindy Butts the chair of the commission has come up with – and that’s a process that’s going to take place really for the next three months.” Lavender also addressed the fact that the report highlighted that England’s women have never played a Test at Lord’s, while the “home of cricket” continues to host an annual schools fixture between Eton and Harrow and the university match between Cambridge and Oxford. The MCC’s executive had originally decided to relocate the Eton-Harrow and Cambridge-Oxford games from Lord’s but kept them at the ground until at least 2027 following complaints from MCC members. “I think we need to review that in light of the report in the next few months,” said Lavender. “Any reasonable-minded listener would view that you’ve got to work out whether you can do both. Whether that’s good enough … and the commission’s view was that it wasn’t. “That’s really where we are – how do you balance out tradition and create new opportunities for kids and young people to play at Lord’s?” On England Women playing a Test at Lord’s, he added: “There’s been a general sense, particularly with the ECB, that you want to play some of the women’s international matches in the early days at smaller grounds while you build up a capacity. “But we sold the highest amount of tickets for a women’s international last year, and have surpassed that for the Women’s Ashes this year. “We’ll play a women’s Test in 2026, so we’ve moving in the right direction but there is more to be done.” – BBC Sport","pubDate":"2023-06-29 22:01:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"hmetro_zw","category":["sports"],"country":["Zimbabwe"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ashes cricket: Australia v England - Second test evenly poised after day two","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/ashes-cricket-australia-v-england-second-test-evenly-poised-after-day-two/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"England slashed Australia’s first-innings lead of 416 to 138 after two days of the second Ashes test at Lord’s on Thursday. The bad news for England in comfortably scoring 278 runs was that all four wickets to fall were gifted to Australia. England batted so serenely through the middle session and to an hour past tea — without even Bazballing it — that Australia spread its fielders, vacating the slips in desperate need of a second wicket. And Australia’s fortunes worsened when Nathan Lyon, its only wicket-taker at that point and the teammate who seemingly never gets hurt, injured his right calf while running to a ball in the field and hobbled away with help. He didn’t return and the manner of his exit suggested he may not return for the rest of what is his 100th successive test. Without Lyon’s spin to wear down England, Australia changed its tactics by tempting England with the short ball. England took the bait. Ollie Pope, Ben Duckett and world No. 1 Joe Root recklessly went after short balls and gave catches behind square. Pope spoiled a flowing 97-run stand with Duckett when his pull at Cameron Green sailed straight to Steve Smith at deep backward square leg. Pope made 42 off 63 balls. In the same over, Root had 1 when he gloved a Green bouncer to wicketkeeper Alex Carey and Australia duly celebrated raucously. But Green committed a no-ball, his fifth of six on the day. Root used his life on 1 to pass Allan Border into 10th on the all-time test run-scorers list. But Australia minimized the missed chance by getting Root out for 10, when his pull at Mitchell Starc was brilliantly caught by a diving Smith at backward square. Root reviewed the catch but Smith fairly got his fingers underneath. Before Root was dismissed, Duckett agonizingly missed his second test century at Lord’s this month when he pulled at Josh Hazlewood and top-edged to David Warner at deep fine leg. Duckett had 98 off 134 balls, including nine boundaries. After the mad hour from Lyon limping away to Root’s dismissal, Harry Brook and Ben Stokes calmly steered England to stumps against conventional fields, although Brook got a life on 25 when he pulled Pat Cummins to square leg where Marnus Labuschagne dropped an overhead catch. Brook was on 45 and Stokes on 17 in an unbroken stand of 56. The only wicket to fall in England’s first 188 runs was Zak Crawley’s in the middle session.

STUMPS | England v Australia, Second Ashes Test, Day 2 England, enjoying the best batting conditions of the match, were well placed at 188-1 in reply to Australia's first innings 416, with the visitors' spin bowler, Nathan Lyon, off the field with a calf injury. But England slumped to 222-4 as Australia bowled bouncers with as many as four men deep on the legside -- a tactic that could scarcely have been more obvious had it been signalled in neon lights. However, at stumps on the second day they had recovered to 278-4 following an unbroken stand of 56 between Harry Brook (45 not out) and captain Ben Stokes (17 not out). The pair had come together after England lost three wickets for 34 runs. England vice-captain Ollie Pope holed out off towering all-rounder Cameron Green after a brisk 42. Ben Duckett had batted superbly to move to within sight of a maiden Ashes hundred. But having had a few near misses with risky hooks, the left-handed opener fell for 98 when he pulled Josh Hazlewood straight to David Warner. Joe Root, the world's top-ranked Test batsman, could have been out caught behind on one when gloving a hook off Green, only to be reprieved by a no-ball. But he fell for 10 when suckered into pulling a short ball from express quick Mitchell Starc, with Steve Smith taking a low running catch. Smith had earlier returned to form with a well-made hundred after managing just 22 runs in two innings during Australia's thrilling two-wicket win in the first Test at Edgbaston. His 110 was the 32nd Test century of the 34-year-old's brilliant career, his 12th in the Ashes and eighth in England. England, however, recovered well on Thursday by taking Australia's last five wickets for the addition of 77 runs. Veteran pacemen James Anderson and Stuart Broad, the two most successful quicks in Test history, managed just two wickets between them. Instead, it was their fellow frontline seamers who did the bulk of the damage, with Josh Tongue taking 3-98 on his Ashes debut and Ollie Robinson 3-100. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon, appearing in his 100th consecutive Test, moved to within four wickets of 500 in Tests when he had Zak Crawley stumped for a run-a-ball 48 to leave England 91-1. But he later limped off the field after trying to catch Pope. Australia had resumed well-placed on 339-5, with Smith 85 not out, just 15 runs shy of his second Test century at Lord's following a superb 215 eight years ago. England failed to make the most of helpful conditions for their quicks after Stokes won the toss on Wednesday. And there were more worrying signs when Stuart Broad speared his first two balls down the legside, Alex Carey glancing both deliveries for comfortable fours. But Broad, regaining his accuracy, had Carey lbw on review for 22. Smith went to 99 with a fortunate nick to third man for four off Anderson, who then almost beat the batsman's defence with an excellent yorker. Off the very next ball, Smith drove Anderson through the covers to complete a 169-ball century with his 14th four. Smith fell soon afterwards when a booming drive off Tongue was superbly caught by a diving Duckett in the gully.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 20:45:33","image_url":"https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/sport24.png","source_id":"news24","category":["sports"],"country":["south africa"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Reece Walsh will be OK but what about the referees who are being abused?","link":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/nrl/reece-walsh-will-be-ok-but-what-about-the-referees-who-are-being-abused-20230629-p5dkbn.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport","keywords":null,"creator":["Andrew Webster"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sport needs to get serious about how it treats match officials before there are none left.","content":"Even the most seasoned NRL judiciary participants were taken aback by the profanities being dropped at the Reece Walsh hearing at League Central on Wednesday night. When Patrick Carrigan and David Fifita appeared as witnesses, they initially struggled to utter the words “f---” and “c---” in front of a room of sophisticated people, which it was if you excluded the journalists. The players were urged to speak freely and, before you knew it, everyone was dropping f-and-c-bombs like they were extras in a Scorsese movie. Good on them. That’s what judiciaries are for: swearing like a wharfie, loud and proud with total impunity. I might hip-drop a random on the street this weekend just to get a start. Heaven knows you can’t swear like that in a newsroom any longer. Nor in public. Not even on a football field, really, given open microphones on the sidelines and the referee have been in play for years. If there’s a time and place when you cannot swear, it’s when you are speaking to a referee. That’s never changed. Unless you’re the captain, you shouldn’t really be speaking to the referee anyway. Reece Walsh appears at Tuesday’s judiciary hearing. Credit: NRL Photos So when Walsh barks at match officials all the way through last Sunday’s loss to the Gold Coast, and then yells “What the f--- do you mean, c---?” in the direction of referee Chris Butler after an unfavourable decision, you expect him to be heavily sanctioned. The judiciary handed him a three-match ban, but it could have been far more. The abuse of match officials at all levels of all sports must end and the rush from Walsh’s teammates and coaches at the Broncos and Queensland to defend him proves it. Cameron Smith , who would rank in the top three referees of all time, reckons Walsh acted poorly but there wasn’t any definitive evidence the comment was directed at Butler, who said in his referee’s report he didn’t hear exactly what was said. “So what’s he being punished for?” Smith asked on SEN Radio. “Poor body language? Aggressive body language?” No, he’s been punished for calling the referee a “c---” . The vision, the audio, and his history not just in this match but others demonstrate Walsh has a problem with how he addresses match officials. Smith and others are blasting the guilty verdict, but I’ll defer to the findings of judiciary chair Geoff Bellew , a Supreme Court judge who once jailed disgraced former detective Roger Rogerson for life in the afternoon before slipping out of his robes and into a judiciary hearing that evening. In the summary of the judgement, which this column has obtained, Bellew tore the evidence of Carrigan and Fifita to shreds. Both had claimed Walsh’s remark was directed at Carrigan. Fifita was all over the shop, at one point admitting Walsh was talking to the referee. David Fifita spoke in defence of Reece Walsh. Credit: NRL Photos “The majority placed little weight on the evidence given by players Carrigan and Fifita,” Bellew wrote. “It was clear from their evidence that each of them had a close relationship with player Walsh, and that in advance of giving evidence, each of them had engaged in separate discussions with him about the incident, and about the evidence that they would give. In the view of the majority, this had a generally adverse effect upon the reliability of the evidence that they gave.” Walsh’s evidence was also considered unreliable after he said he was responding to Carrigan’s remark to “slow your f---ing brain”. “Even accepting that those words were said by player Carrigan, and giving full weight to the fact that tensions were obviously high, the majority took the view that as a matter of common sense, the words said by player Walsh were essentially non-responsive to what had been said to him and were not explicable on the basis of them sharing a ‘close relationship’,” Bellew wrote. “That was particularly so, in circumstances where the evidence of player Walsh was that had understood player Carrigan’s words to mean that he should ‘think and be smart’. If that was his understanding, there was simply no need to ask player Carrigan what he had meant. That factor tended against a conclusion that the words were said to player Carrigan as opposed to the referee.” In other words, Walsh’s argument was so flimsy and didn’t make sense, so it wasn’t considered. Broncos officials and teammates are throwing an arm around their young fullback, saying how he’ll learn from this episode and grow and how they’ve got his back and blah blah blah. The same things were said two years ago when he was busted by police on the Gold Coast with a bag of cocaine. Walsh is being widely supported, but where’s the support and care for the referee? For the touch judge who copped a mouthful from an entitled 20-year-old for doing his job? Where’s the respect for all referees, who are under as much pressure as Walsh but on a fraction of the money? In 2018, leading referee Matt Cecchin opened up to this masthead about the abuse that was driving him out of the game. Reece Walsh had been warned about his behaviour. Credit: Getty After making a controversial - and correct - call in the dying minutes of the World Cup semi-final between Tonga and England in Auckland, Cecchin received an avalanche of death threats on social media, so much so that New Zealand Police and Australian Federal Police noticed it and gave a police escort home to Sydney. That article was supposed to be a line-in-the-sand moment for how we treated match officials. It certainly changed the way I wrote and spoke about them. But, if anything, the abuse has worsened. Ben Cummins still becomes emotional when he talks about the fallout from his controversial decision to reverse a set restart in the 2019 NRL grand final between Canberra and the Roosters. When Jason Paris , the chief executive of Warriors’ sponsor One NZ, accused the referees of cheating earlier this year, it was disturbing how much support he was given. It’s just as bad in other sports. The growing abuse of Super Rugby referees was highlighted earlier this week when Ben O’Keeffe revealed on Instagram the extent of the abuse he received after officiating in the Super Rugby Pacific final between the Chiefs and Crusaders in Hamilton on Saturday. His post was disturbing with direct messages from people threatening to kill, stomp or punch him. Read one: “You should have been in that titan submarine you arse wipe.” O’Keeffe also pointed to the plight of English football referee Anthony Taylor , who was attacked by a mob of angry Roma supporters at an airport in Budapest after their Europa League final defeat to Sevilla earlier this month. “I think back to the referee walking through the airport and his family getting chairs thrown at them,” added O’Keeffe. “I hope my family is never subjected to this but the direction some fans are going now in rugby, I know we are closer than we have ever been.” The NRL is considering tougher sanctions for referee abuse. It should direct the judiciary into longer time on the sidelines. Give Walsh six weeks. Give him 10. I bet he wouldn’t say another word to a ref or touchie for the rest of his career. Referees should also be charged with greater authority to send players from the field, even if they don’t hear what was said. The Bunker rules on every other aspect of what happens on the field — surely that can be broadened to what is said to the whistleblower. They need to be empowered to not tolerate any dissent. Can you imagine how former referee Bill Harrigan , who is considered the best of all time, would have reacted to Walsh’s remark? Former NRL head of refereeing Bill Harrigan. Credit: Dallas Kilponen Mostly, though, the responsibility should fall to the players, who could do worse than go to a junior footy match and watch how parents, and then their children, speak to referees, most of whom are either volunteers or teenagers. This week, I was told about a recent rugby league match being abandoned because of the abuse of the referee. The age group? Under 6s. THE QUOTE “Finally. They see the value.

That represented a sizeable swing in fortunes after a lethargic first-day performance, but it might have been even better. They had Australia boxed in at 188 for one, but saw Ollie Pope, Duckett and Joe Root all lose their wickets during a sustained barrage of bumpers. A stunning knock, Ben ✊ So unlucky to come up short ❤️ | — England Cricket (@englandcricket) A more cautious approach might have helped them negotiate a frenetic passage of play more safely, but would have been out of character for a team who have spent a year steering into risks and taking the aggressive approach. Duckett is a true believer of the ‘Bazball’ philosophy and was at peace after being caught at fine-leg pulling Josh Hazlewood. “It’s a shot I play and a shot I’ve scored plenty of runs with in my career. I would have been gutted with myself if I’d gone away from it, gone into my shell and gloved one behind,” he said. “Ten metres either side and I’ve got a hundred. Falling so close to three figures here at Lord’s, I was obviously gutted for half-an-hour after, but I’m happy with how I played. I thought it was certainly my best innings in an England shirt. “It’s the way we play our cricket. If they have plans like that and we go into our shell, it would be totally against what we do. We lost a couple of wickets but we’re in a good position. “I was batting with Popey and Rooty but there was not a lot of chat, it was just ‘how do you want to go about this?’. That’s the kind of fun environment we are creating. If you want to back away and hit it over cover for six or do whatever you need to do, then just commit to it. “Popey just said ‘I’m going get inside of it and smack it into the stands’. No-one in that dressing room will be disappointed with how Popey got out, everyone will just be a bit gutted it didn’t go for six.” Earlier in the day Australia’s Steve Smith did manage to make it to a century, scoring 110 as he celebrated his 12th Ashes ton. Only the great Donald Bradman has more in the series, well clear on 19, and Smith had a different perspective on England’s approach. He felt vindicated that Australia’s seamers kept creating openings at a time when they could easily have retreated into defence and credited Ben Stokes, the chief architect of England’s all-out aggression, for restoring an element of calm at the end. “Lord’s has deep pockets, so if you are going to hit it for six you’re going to have to get a fair piece of it. The fielders are there if you don’t,” he said. “We were setting fields and they were taking it on. England are playing this really aggressive brand and they didn’t look like they were holding back. That created opportunities for us. “It was great that we managed to create so many chances on that kind of wicket. It was just Stokesy who changed it. He was only looking to get underneath it, or ride it out. The rest were trying to take it on and we probably didn’t feel as in the game against him as we did with the others.”","pubDate":"2023-06-29 19:42:08","image_url":"https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16945553/?type=app&htype=0","source_id":"watfordobserver","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Joe Root surpasses Allan Border, becomes 10th highest run-scorer in Test cricket","link":"http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/cricket/2023/jun/30/joe-root-surpasses-allan-border-becomes-10th-highest-run-scorer-in-test-cricket-2589858.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Root accomplished this feat during the 2nd Ashes 2023 match against Australia at Lord's.

LONDON: Nathan Lyon was the one Australia cricketer who seemingly never gets hurt. On the landmark occasion of his 100th consecutive test, a testament to durability, he was hurt. Lyon was suspected to have torn his right calf on Thursday while running to catch a fly ball in the field during day two of the second Ashes test at Lord’s. He pulled up and grabbed his calf. He needed help to slowly limp back to the pavilion. “We’re going to miss him this game and could miss him for a little while,” teammate Steve Smith said. Cricket Australia said Lyon will be assessed overnight, without elaborating. If the 35-year-old Lyon has a torn calf, it’s a two-month injury and he will miss the rest of the five-match Ashes series. His value to Australia is immense. The off-spinner took a team-leading eight wickets in the opening win at Edgbaston last week, and took the first England wicket in the second test on Thursday. Zak Crawley was his 496th career wicket. Lyon was poised in this test to become only the eighth man to 500. Lyon had just finished bowling his 13th over, conceding only 35 runs overall, while three of his teammates were giving up seven an over at the time. He’d been summoned to bowl after only 11 overs of the innings. Without Lyon, Australia relied on Travis Head and Steve Smith as spin alternatives. The last time Lyon, who debuted in 2011, missed a test was the 2013 Ashes match at Lord’s. He became only the sixth man, and first bowler, to play 100 in a row.","content":"LONDON: Nathan Lyon was the one Australia cricketer who seemingly never gets hurt.

In October 2022, NZ Customs intercepted a package at the border addressed to Mr Sharma. Medsafe identified the 26 vials and 2,250 tablets as assorted anabolic agents - all illegal to buy without a prescription or unapproved for medical use in humans - and referred the case to DFSNZ for further investigation. Anabolic agents increase muscle mass and strength and, in the case of Clenbuterol, aid weight loss. They are banned in sport at all times. Side effects from these types of substances can be serious, and include cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, impotence, depression and liver damage. \"This case sends a clear message,\" said DFSNZ Chief Executive Nick Paterson, \"if you play sport, anti-doping rules apply to you, and protect you, whatever your level of competition. Anyone importing or buying banned substances risks a ban from all sport.\" Mr Paterson went on to comment on the significance of the purchase. \"Doping denies clean Kiwi athletes the chance to excel on a level playing field. This is one of the largest import cases we’ve seen - it’s concerning to see such a quantity and combination of substances, and that the individuals ordering these substances may be doing so without medical advice. Nonetheless, we’re pleased to have taken such a substantial quantity of doping material out of circulation. It goes to show the importance of our partnerships with NZ Customs and Medsafe in disrupting the supply chain and protecting athletes at risk of doping.\". NZC’s GM Community, Kent Stead, said the case highlighted the need for awareness in terms of the scope of Drug Free Sport NZ’s programme. \"This serves as a reminder that the Sports Anti-Doping Rules apply to all cricketers registered to an NZC-affiliated club or organisation, regardless of the level in which they compete,\" he said. \"The assumption that it only applies to elite or high-performance athletes is incorrect.\" The substances found in the seizure were: - Nadrol-50, oxymethalone 50mg, 15 bottles x 50 tablets; - Sustanon, sustanon 250mg, 5 x 10ml vials; - Tren-A-100, trenbolone acetate, 100mg/ml, 3 x 10ml vials; - Masteron, drostanolone propionate 100mg/ml, 2 x 10ml vials; - Deca-300, nandrolone decanoate, 300mg/ml, 6 x 10ml vials; - Cyp-300, testosterone cypionate, 300mg/ml, 3 x 10ml vials; - Test Depot, testosterone enanthate, 250mg/ml, 2 x 10 ml vials; - Cypionex, testosterone cypionate, 250mg/ml 5 x 10ml vials; - Clen-40, clenbuterol, 40mcg, 15 bottles x 100 tablets.","pubDate":"2023-06-29 19:19:18","image_url":null,"source_id":"voxy","category":["sports"],"country":["new zealand"],"language":"english"}]}
