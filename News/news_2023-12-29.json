Australia had recovered from 16 for four after lunch on Thursday to resume on 187-6 on a sunny morning at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Alex Carey scored his sixth test half century with a knock of 52 to help extend the lead before he was trapped leg before by seamer Mir Hamza (4-32) to bring an end to the innings. Pakistan made 264 in their first innings and will be up against it chasing down the target given the form of Pat Cummins and the Australian pace attack. The tourists were dismissed for 89 in the fourth innings as Australia won the first test in the three-match series by 360 runs in Perth two weeks ago. The highest successful fourth-innings run chase at the MCG was the 332 England scored back in 1928-29.

The MCG welcomed over 60,000 fans into the ground for Day 1 of the Melbourne Test against Pakistan, But around just half of the total crowd that came through the gates for the day were in their seats to watch the first ball, with most of the rest rolling in by lunch. It prompted SEN’s Gerard Whateley to ponder whether the start time for the Boxing Day Test should be moved back to 12pm to accommodate for cricket fans waking up from a big Christmas Day on Day 1. Such decisions lie squarely in the lap of Cricket Australia, but Fox said it was worth a discussion. “I think you’re using the data to run a good case here and it’s hard to run against,” Fox said in response to the crowd almost doubling between the first ball on Day 1 and lunchtime. “I love the traditional timeslot and I love the fact that it hasn’t changed but I think we’ve got to be up for the discussion and I think that data suggests that if you did start around midday, you’re going to have a lot more people inside the stadium watching the game. “I think that’d be really special.” CA boss Nick Hockley refused to entertain the idea when speaking to SEN earlier in the Test. But Whateley posed the argument that tradition must have nothing to do with the decision. “I’m amazed how people defer to tradition when there is no such tradition — 10:30 is not the traditional starting time of Boxing Day; it was 11:00 for a long time,” he said. “It’s a lazy argument to say tradition is this — it’s not. The television era moved the start times from 11 to 10:30 so that the news didn’t get interrupted. “So, it’s completely flexible when these Test matches start. “It’s convention, not tradition, and once convention doesn’t fit anymore, it should be altered.”","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:22:15","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13051975/9feff0b97fa87e8f0fc0ef0467be6916ef4f819d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"aa2befac19c007c8a1b3d0be0822d92f","title":"Morning Digest | Disabled staff to get quota in promotion with effect from 2016, Supreme Court Collegium recommends CJs to five HCs; and more","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/morning-digest-december-29-2023/article67684917.ece","keywords":["india"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Here is a select list of stories to start the day","content":"AAP, BJP spar over rejection of Republic Day tableaux of Delhi, Punjab The Delhi and Punjab tableaux have been left out of the upcoming Republic Day parade due to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “dirty politics”, the Aam Aadmi Party alleged on Thursday. The BJP hit back, terming it shameful that the AAP, which is in power in both States, was politicising a decision taken by a special committee. “If the Delhi government had the chance, they would have showcased their education and health models in the Republic Day parade,” AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, noting that Delhi is the country’s capital. Disabled staff to get quota in promotion with effect from 2016 The Union government on Thursday issued an order paving the way for Persons with Disabilities to be considered for reservation in promotions up to the lowest rung of Group A posts in the Central government, with effect from June 30, 2016. June 30, 2016 is the day on which the Supreme Court had initially ruled that PwD candidates must be entitled to reservation in promotions irrespective of whether the positions were filled through reservation or not.

The notification to prorogue the two Houses is expected in a day or two, parliamentary sources said. Out of the 146 MPs who were suspended from both Houses, 132 were suspended till “the remainder of the Session”. Three MPs from Lok Sabha and 11 MPs from Rajya Sabha have been suspended pending the report of the Privileges Committees of the respective House.

China decries Taiwan for ‘hyping up’ military threat, sends warplanes China’s defence ministry accused Taiwan’s government on Thursday of deliberately “hyping up” a military threat from China for electoral gain ahead of elections on the island in just over two weeks’ time, but again sent warplanes into the Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s Jan. 13 presidential and parliamentary election will shape the Chinese-claimed island’s relations with Beijing, which over the past four years has ramped up military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims. Maharashtra sets up COVID-19 task force again Considering the increase in number of COVID-19 cases daily in the State, the Maharashtra government has once again formed the COVID-19 special task force.

The task force would issue a list of medicines and guidelines soon to ensure uniformity in treatment. Delay in Rajasthan Cabinet formation leaves BJP leaders baffled The inordinate delay in forming a Cabinet in Rajasthan after the BJP was elected to power earlier this month has left party leaders here baffled. As of Thursday there was no indication about a likely date for a swearing in. Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma who has visited New Delhi twice to meet senior leaders has not thrown any light on the status of the Cabinet either. The delay has especially perturbed young BJP MLAs, many of whom were expecting that they might get an opportunity to serve as Ministers in the same manner as the first-time Sanganer MLA Mr. Sharma, who was picked for the Chief Minister’s post. However, legislators are not willing to openly stake their claims. Tharoor hints at 2024 being his last contest RCongress Working Committee member and Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor spoke on Thursday about providing opportunities for younger people to contest polls, indicating that his upcoming fight from Thiruvananthapuram in the general elections may be his last in the constituency. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a Congress programme here, Mr. Tharoor, however, said there was no finality about it since it was politics. “I do believe that at some point, the time comes to make room for younger people. And that’s my thinking,” he said.

Modi govt. trying to ‘cover up’ worst territorial setbacks in eastern Ladakh in past six decades: Congress The Narendra Modi government is trying to “cover up” the worst territorial setback in six decades as Chinese troops have been denying Indian patrols access to the strategic Depsang Plains, Demchok and other areas in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, the Congress alleged on Thursday. The party’s communications chief Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, quoted Chushul councillor Konchok Stanzin who claimed that a landmark at the site of the legendary Rezang La battle of the 1962 Sino-India conflict in Ladakh was dismantled as part of the disengagement process with China. Israel bombs Gaza as UN warns civilians face ‘grave peril’ Israeli forces on Thursday heavily bombed the besieged Gaza Strip as the centre of fierce combat against Hamas moves steadily south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering. The war, which started with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated much of northern Gaza as air and artillery strikes and house-to-house fighting have become heaviest in the southern city of Khan Yunis.

A final decision on the start time would ultimately be left to Cricket Australia, but Melbourne Cricket Club CEO Stuart Fox agrees it’s a conversation that needs to be had. “I think you’re using the data to run a good case here and it’s hard to run against,” Fox told SEN radio . “I love the traditional timeslot and I love the fact that it hasn’t changed but I think we’ve got to be up for the discussion and I think that data suggests that if you did start around midday, you’re going to have a lot more people inside the stadium watching the game. “I think that’d be really special.” There are calls to push the start time on Boxing Day to 12:00pm Source: News Corp Australia Cricket Australia has indicated a change in start time is not something they would consider any time soon. CA chief executive Nick Hockley has stated he supports the usual 10:30am start. However, Whateley noted on Friday morning, tradition and convention should not be confused given the history of the start time. “I’m amazed how people defer to tradition when there is no such tradition,” Whateley said. “10:30 is not the traditional starting time of Boxing Day, it was 11:00 for a long time. It’s a lazy argument to say tradition is this, it’s not. A packed MCG provides such a better atmosphere for Test cricket. Source: News Corp Australia “The television era moved the start times from 11 to 10:30 so that the news didn’t get interrupted. “So it’s completely flexible when these Test matches start. It’s convention, not tradition, and once convention doesn’t fit anymore it should be altered.” As of 10:00am on Day 4 the MCG had seen 146,842 fans come through the gate across the Test match, with just 3,598 in attendance to start Friday’s play.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:14:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d6281c62d6bf986b1e3a8cfb3da52fd4","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"d328599ca32c52401ec7c652522146ab","title":"Mystery solved as controversial Pat Cummins wicket explained","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/mystery-solved-as-controversial-pat-cummins-wicket-explained-c-13051880","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Sutton"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Australian skipper was given out despite there appearing to be a gap between bat and ball.","content":"Former ICC umpire Simon Taufel has explained why Australian skipper Pat Cummins was given out on Day 4 of the Boxing Day against Pakistan at the MCG. Cummins was given out caught behind off the bowling of Aamer Jamal, but immediately sent the decision for a review. The DRS showed no mark on Hotspot, but the faintest spike appeared on Snicko prompting umpire Michael Gough to keep his original decision. Fans were left confused with replays showing a clear gap between bat and ball when the spike on Snicko appeared. But there was a simple explanation provided by Taufel. “This has got to do with the calibration between sight and sound. Of course sound does travel at different speed to light,” he said on Channel 7. “Before each day’s play, the technology providers do go out and calibrate the sounds particularly and so what we’re looking for is a spike as the ball goes past the bat or up to one frame past the bat which allows that distance between the noise and the stump microphone.” Commentators Alison Mitchell and Greg Blewett agreed with the decision. “That makes sense ... that there is a frame allowed either side. I remember when that change came in just to make an allowance for the physics of it,” Mitchell said. Blewett added: “Exactly right. Well explained by Simon. To the naked eye, the one frame where the spike is, you can see the ball is not next to the bat. Clear edge ... straightaway, the umpire’s finger was up, Pakistan fielders were all up.” Cummins (16) was the second wicket to fall early on Day 4 as the Aussies were eventually all out for 262. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey (53) helped push Australia’s lead over the crucial 300-mark with his highest score since the first Test of the Ashes in June. Star Pakistani quick Shaheen Afridi (4-76) made a welcome return to form with his best figures of the series, while fellow left-armer Mir Hamza (4-32) proved to be a serious handful. Pakistan, who have lost 15-straight Tests in Australia, will need to create history to avoid going down 2-0 in the Benaud-Qadir series. The highest successful fourth-innings chase at the MCG was England’s 7-332 in 1928. The last team to score more than 300 in the fourth innings of a MCG Test was Pakistan in a losing cause back in 1990. Carey’s crucial cameo takes pressure off the left-hander, who has been down on form with the bat and was dropped during Australia’s ODI World Cup campaign. Carey followed up on Mitch Marsh’s good work on Thursday when the allrounder smashed a sparkling 96. Marsh joined Steve Smith (50) at the crease when Australia were reeling at 4-16, but the pair put on a potentially matchwinning 153-run stand. The 32-year-old was given a life when Australia were 4-46 when he was dropped by Abdullah Shafique in the slips cordon. Shafique, who also dropped a simple chance on day one, was taken out of the slips on Friday and replaced by Babar Azam. The former Pakistan captain hung onto a brillant catch to dismiss Mitchell Starc to help bring Australia’s innings to a closer end.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:13:41","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13051880/572da31524135dd1e362cda3112860606760a7fd-16x9-x0y0w1920h1080.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"e0512920b751cd125e2d5e05d5cee189","title":"Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12908083/Aussie-cricket-boss-says-just-THREE-Test-playing-nations-left-10-years-franchise-T20-cricket-threatens-future-Boxing-Day-Test.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely","content":"Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test New T20 leagues have started and the sport will be at the Olympics IPL sides are looking to contract players all year round Aussies fear they may not have quality Test opposition in the near future By Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Published: 20:02 EST, 28 December 2023 | Updated: 20:05 EST, 28 December 2023 e-mail View comments There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely. While crowd numbers continue to dwindle at Test matches, T20 cricket continues to surge globally. It received the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) seal of approval to be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Games while The International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates became the latest big money tournament in an already cluttered calendar. Major League Cricket also launched in the United States, backed by Microsoft and Adobe. However it is the surge of franchise T20 cricket that could drive the final nail into Test cricket. Sparse crowds have begun to plague cricket in Australia, with Marnus Labuschagne pictured in front of bays of empty seats against South Africa in January, 2023 Nathan Lyon took his milestone 500th Test wicket in front of bays of empty seats at Optus Stadium in Perth against Pakistan in the first Test South Africa has also struggled to bring the crowds in for their Boxing Day Test blockbuster against India - which they won The owners of eight of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises also own at least one team in another foreign competition, with that number set to expand in the coming years. It would create a situation where players would need to choose between T20 riches or representing their nation, with no room in the schedule to do both. That would mean only the most financially viable Test nations would be left standing, potentially meaning only Australia, England and India play the five-day game in the near future. It is not fearmongering or hyperbole, it is a real fear, Australian Cricketer's Association Todd Greenberg said. 'My message is, we're under pressure,' he told News Corp . 'Pressure might be a good thing, because it will lift all of our opportunities up and make us the best we can be, but other countries are really struggling, 'And we can't play against ourselves. So I'd like to think that Test cricket is more than just Australia, England and India in 10 years' time. 'We want to make sure that Pakistan and South Africa and New Zealand and others can continue to play against us. 'I worry that countries like South Africa and New Zealand in 10 years time may no longer be able to afford to have their best players playing and disappearing because of the push and pull of global leagues. 'So that is a concern. And I don't think I'm being an alarmist. I think I'm being a realist.' Australian Cricketers Association boss Todd Greenberg, pictured with his wife Lisa, believes Australia has to help battling nations stay relevant in Test cricket At present, Australia has seen the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and even renowned short-form specialist Glenn Maxwell shun the riches of franchise cricket to focus on their country. However with gun players turning down playing for their nation in other countries, Greenberg is aware that situation could change very quickly in Australia. 'We're already seeing countries all over the world and particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, where that's already happening,' he said. 'And so my message is, it's not happening here at the moment, and it might not feel like it's gonna happen here at the moment, but it's happening in other countries in our sport. 'So we'd be crazy not to think that those pressures aren't going to be applied to us at some point in time. So we've got to have this conversation now. Make sure we're ready,' Greenberg said. Major League Cricket in the United States is the latest T20 league to appear in an already cluttered calendar The IPL continues to go from strength to strength and now franchises are looking to own international clubs - which could mean players are contracted all-year round Greenberg is not the only cricket identity forewarning the death of Test cricket. English cricket icon David 'Bumble' Lloyd said the death of Test cricket would come within a decade back in 2022. 'Where will they put it? There's no room for Test cricket as we know it, and my guess is that in future we will only see the iconic series: like the Ashes, England vs West Indies and England vs India,' he wrote for Sportsmail . England cricket coach Brendon McCullum, who has been the architect of Bazball in a bid to revive Test cricket, also previously warned that the long-form of the game was at risk if England was not competitive. 'Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me,' he said in an interview with the ECB . 'But the popularity of it has somewhat trended south of late. 'So if Test cricket is to not just to sustain but thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand.

The MCG welcomed over 60,000 fans into the ground for Day 1 of the Melbourne Test against Pakistan, But around just half of the total crowd that came through the gates for the day were in their seats to watch the first ball, with most of the rest rolling in by lunch. It prompted SEN’s Gerard Whateley to ponder whether the start time for the Boxing Day Test should be moved back to 12pm to accommodate for cricket fans waking up from a big Christmas Day on Day 1. Such decisions lie squarely in the lap of Cricket Australia, but Fox said it was worth a discussion. “I think you’re using the data to run a good case here and it’s hard to run against,” Fox said in response to the crowd almost doubling between the first ball on Day 1 and lunchtime. “I love the traditional timeslot and I love the fact that it hasn’t changed but I think we’ve got to be up for the discussion and I think that data suggests that if you did start around midday, you’re going to have a lot more people inside the stadium watching the game. “I think that’d be really special.” CA boss Nick Hockley refused to entertain the idea when speaking to SEN earlier in the Test. But Whateley posed the argument that tradition must have nothing to do with the decision. “I’m amazed how people defer to tradition when there is no such tradition — 10:30 is not the traditional starting time of Boxing Day; it was 11:00 for a long time,” he said. “It’s a lazy argument to say tradition is this — it’s not. The television era moved the start times from 11 to 10:30 so that the news didn’t get interrupted. “So, it’s completely flexible when these Test matches start. “It’s convention, not tradition, and once convention doesn’t fit anymore, it should be altered.”","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:22:15","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13051975/9feff0b97fa87e8f0fc0ef0467be6916ef4f819d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"aa2befac19c007c8a1b3d0be0822d92f","title":"Morning Digest | Disabled staff to get quota in promotion with effect from 2016, Supreme Court Collegium recommends CJs to five HCs; and more","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/morning-digest-december-29-2023/article67684917.ece","keywords":["india"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Here is a select list of stories to start the day","content":"AAP, BJP spar over rejection of Republic Day tableaux of Delhi, Punjab The Delhi and Punjab tableaux have been left out of the upcoming Republic Day parade due to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “dirty politics”, the Aam Aadmi Party alleged on Thursday. The BJP hit back, terming it shameful that the AAP, which is in power in both States, was politicising a decision taken by a special committee. “If the Delhi government had the chance, they would have showcased their education and health models in the Republic Day parade,” AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, noting that Delhi is the country’s capital. Disabled staff to get quota in promotion with effect from 2016 The Union government on Thursday issued an order paving the way for Persons with Disabilities to be considered for reservation in promotions up to the lowest rung of Group A posts in the Central government, with effect from June 30, 2016.

Delay in Rajasthan Cabinet formation leaves BJP leaders baffled The inordinate delay in forming a Cabinet in Rajasthan after the BJP was elected to power earlier this month has left party leaders here baffled. As of Thursday there was no indication about a likely date for a swearing in. Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma who has visited New Delhi twice to meet senior leaders has not thrown any light on the status of the Cabinet either. The delay has especially perturbed young BJP MLAs, many of whom were expecting that they might get an opportunity to serve as Ministers in the same manner as the first-time Sanganer MLA Mr. Sharma, who was picked for the Chief Minister’s post. However, legislators are not willing to openly stake their claims. Tharoor hints at 2024 being his last contest RCongress Working Committee member and Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor spoke on Thursday about providing opportunities for younger people to contest polls, indicating that his upcoming fight from Thiruvananthapuram in the general elections may be his last in the constituency.

And that’s my thinking,” he said. Ben Stokes hits back at Harmison’s remarks of England losing 5-0 against India England Test skipper Ben Stokes hit back at former cricketer Steve Harmison for his remarks on England’s lack of preparation for their upcoming Test series against India .Former pacer Harmison who is also a close friend of Stokes questioned England arriving in India just three days before the five-match Test series. He feels that the lack of acclimation could turn out to be a recipe for disaster. He also went on to claim that England could go on to “deserve to get beaten 5-0”. Stokes replied to a video of Harmison’s comments and said as quoted from Sky Sports, “Good job we’re going to Abu Dhabi for a training camp before we go to India for even more training before that first Test then, isn’t it?” Hardeep Singh Nijjar killing | Canada may arrest two suspects ‘within weeks’, says report Canadian police are close to arresting two men believed to be responsible for the fatal shooting of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in the British Columbia province in June and are still in the country, according to a media report.

Modi govt. trying to ‘cover up’ worst territorial setbacks in eastern Ladakh in past six decades: Congress The Narendra Modi government is trying to “cover up” the worst territorial setback in six decades as Chinese troops have been denying Indian patrols access to the strategic Depsang Plains, Demchok and other areas in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, the Congress alleged on Thursday. The party’s communications chief Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, quoted Chushul councillor Konchok Stanzin who claimed that a landmark at the site of the legendary Rezang La battle of the 1962 Sino-India conflict in Ladakh was dismantled as part of the disengagement process with China.

CA chief executive Nick Hockley has stated he supports the usual 10:30am start. However, Whateley noted on Friday morning, tradition and convention should not be confused given the history of the start time. “I’m amazed how people defer to tradition when there is no such tradition,” Whateley said. “10:30 is not the traditional starting time of Boxing Day, it was 11:00 for a long time.

Cummins was given out caught behind off the bowling of Aamer Jamal, but immediately sent the decision for a review. The DRS showed no mark on Hotspot, but the faintest spike appeared on Snicko prompting umpire Michael Gough to keep his original decision. Fans were left confused with replays showing a clear gap between bat and ball when the spike on Snicko appeared. But there was a simple explanation provided by Taufel. “This has got to do with the calibration between sight and sound. Of course sound does travel at different speed to light,” he said on Channel 7. “Before each day’s play, the technology providers do go out and calibrate the sounds particularly and so what we’re looking for is a spike as the ball goes past the bat or up to one frame past the bat which allows that distance between the noise and the stump microphone.” Commentators Alison Mitchell and Greg Blewett agreed with the decision. “That makes sense ... that there is a frame allowed either side. I remember when that change came in just to make an allowance for the physics of it,” Mitchell said. Blewett added: “Exactly right. Well explained by Simon. To the naked eye, the one frame where the spike is, you can see the ball is not next to the bat. Clear edge ... straightaway, the umpire’s finger was up, Pakistan fielders were all up.” Cummins (16) was the second wicket to fall early on Day 4 as the Aussies were eventually all out for 262. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey (53) helped push Australia’s lead over the crucial 300-mark with his highest score since the first Test of the Ashes in June. Star Pakistani quick Shaheen Afridi (4-76) made a welcome return to form with his best figures of the series, while fellow left-armer Mir Hamza (4-32) proved to be a serious handful. Pakistan, who have lost 15-straight Tests in Australia, will need to create history to avoid going down 2-0 in the Benaud-Qadir series. The highest successful fourth-innings chase at the MCG was England’s 7-332 in 1928. The last team to score more than 300 in the fourth innings of a MCG Test was Pakistan in a losing cause back in 1990. Carey’s crucial cameo takes pressure off the left-hander, who has been down on form with the bat and was dropped during Australia’s ODI World Cup campaign. Carey followed up on Mitch Marsh’s good work on Thursday when the allrounder smashed a sparkling 96. Marsh joined Steve Smith (50) at the crease when Australia were reeling at 4-16, but the pair put on a potentially matchwinning 153-run stand. The 32-year-old was given a life when Australia were 4-46 when he was dropped by Abdullah Shafique in the slips cordon. Shafique, who also dropped a simple chance on day one, was taken out of the slips on Friday and replaced by Babar Azam. The former Pakistan captain hung onto a brillant catch to dismiss Mitchell Starc to help bring Australia’s innings to a closer end.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:13:41","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13051880/572da31524135dd1e362cda3112860606760a7fd-16x9-x0y0w1920h1080.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"e0512920b751cd125e2d5e05d5cee189","title":"Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12908083/Aussie-cricket-boss-says-just-THREE-Test-playing-nations-left-10-years-franchise-T20-cricket-threatens-future-Boxing-Day-Test.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely","content":"Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test New T20 leagues have started and the sport will be at the Olympics IPL sides are looking to contract players all year round Aussies fear they may not have quality Test opposition in the near future By Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Published: 20:02 EST, 28 December 2023 | Updated: 20:05 EST, 28 December 2023 e-mail View comments There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely. While crowd numbers continue to dwindle at Test matches, T20 cricket continues to surge globally. It received the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) seal of approval to be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Games while The International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates became the latest big money tournament in an already cluttered calendar. Major League Cricket also launched in the United States, backed by Microsoft and Adobe. However it is the surge of franchise T20 cricket that could drive the final nail into Test cricket. Sparse crowds have begun to plague cricket in Australia, with Marnus Labuschagne pictured in front of bays of empty seats against South Africa in January, 2023 Nathan Lyon took his milestone 500th Test wicket in front of bays of empty seats at Optus Stadium in Perth against Pakistan in the first Test South Africa has also struggled to bring the crowds in for their Boxing Day Test blockbuster against India - which they won The owners of eight of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises also own at least one team in another foreign competition, with that number set to expand in the coming years. It would create a situation where players would need to choose between T20 riches or representing their nation, with no room in the schedule to do both. That would mean only the most financially viable Test nations would be left standing, potentially meaning only Australia, England and India play the five-day game in the near future. It is not fearmongering or hyperbole, it is a real fear, Australian Cricketer's Association Todd Greenberg said. 'My message is, we're under pressure,' he told News Corp . 'Pressure might be a good thing, because it will lift all of our opportunities up and make us the best we can be, but other countries are really struggling, 'And we can't play against ourselves. So I'd like to think that Test cricket is more than just Australia, England and India in 10 years' time. 'We want to make sure that Pakistan and South Africa and New Zealand and others can continue to play against us. 'I worry that countries like South Africa and New Zealand in 10 years time may no longer be able to afford to have their best players playing and disappearing because of the push and pull of global leagues. 'So that is a concern. And I don't think I'm being an alarmist. I think I'm being a realist.' Australian Cricketers Association boss Todd Greenberg, pictured with his wife Lisa, believes Australia has to help battling nations stay relevant in Test cricket At present, Australia has seen the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and even renowned short-form specialist Glenn Maxwell shun the riches of franchise cricket to focus on their country. However with gun players turning down playing for their nation in other countries, Greenberg is aware that situation could change very quickly in Australia. 'We're already seeing countries all over the world and particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, where that's already happening,' he said. 'And so my message is, it's not happening here at the moment, and it might not feel like it's gonna happen here at the moment, but it's happening in other countries in our sport. 'So we'd be crazy not to think that those pressures aren't going to be applied to us at some point in time. So we've got to have this conversation now. Make sure we're ready,' Greenberg said. Major League Cricket in the United States is the latest T20 league to appear in an already cluttered calendar The IPL continues to go from strength to strength and now franchises are looking to own international clubs - which could mean players are contracted all-year round Greenberg is not the only cricket identity forewarning the death of Test cricket. English cricket icon David 'Bumble' Lloyd said the death of Test cricket would come within a decade back in 2022. 'Where will they put it? There's no room for Test cricket as we know it, and my guess is that in future we will only see the iconic series: like the Ashes, England vs West Indies and England vs India,' he wrote for Sportsmail . England cricket coach Brendon McCullum, who has been the architect of Bazball in a bid to revive Test cricket, also previously warned that the long-form of the game was at risk if England was not competitive. 'Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me,' he said in an interview with the ECB . 'But the popularity of it has somewhat trended south of late. 'So if Test cricket is to not just to sustain but thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand.

Australia had recovered from 16 for four after lunch on Thursday to resume on 187-6 on a sunny morning at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Alex Carey scored his sixth test half century with a knock of 52 to help extend the lead before he was trapped leg before by seamer Mir Hamza (4-32) to bring an end to the innings. Pakistan made 264 in their first innings and will be up against it chasing down the target given the form of Pat Cummins and the Australian pace attack. The tourists were dismissed for 89 in the fourth innings as Australia won the first test in the three-match series by 360 runs in Perth two weeks ago. The highest successful fourth-innings run chase at the MCG was the 332 England scored back in 1928-29.

The MCG welcomed over 60,000 fans into the ground for Day 1 of the Melbourne Test against Pakistan, But around just half of the total crowd that came through the gates for the day were in their seats to watch the first ball, with most of the rest rolling in by lunch. It prompted SEN’s Gerard Whateley to ponder whether the start time for the Boxing Day Test should be moved back to 12pm to accommodate for cricket fans waking up from a big Christmas Day on Day 1. Such decisions lie squarely in the lap of Cricket Australia, but Fox said it was worth a discussion. “I think you’re using the data to run a good case here and it’s hard to run against,” Fox said in response to the crowd almost doubling between the first ball on Day 1 and lunchtime. “I love the traditional timeslot and I love the fact that it hasn’t changed but I think we’ve got to be up for the discussion and I think that data suggests that if you did start around midday, you’re going to have a lot more people inside the stadium watching the game. “I think that’d be really special.” CA boss Nick Hockley refused to entertain the idea when speaking to SEN earlier in the Test. But Whateley posed the argument that tradition must have nothing to do with the decision. “I’m amazed how people defer to tradition when there is no such tradition — 10:30 is not the traditional starting time of Boxing Day; it was 11:00 for a long time,” he said. “It’s a lazy argument to say tradition is this — it’s not. The television era moved the start times from 11 to 10:30 so that the news didn’t get interrupted. “So, it’s completely flexible when these Test matches start. “It’s convention, not tradition, and once convention doesn’t fit anymore, it should be altered.”","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:22:15","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13051975/9feff0b97fa87e8f0fc0ef0467be6916ef4f819d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"aa2befac19c007c8a1b3d0be0822d92f","title":"Morning Digest | Disabled staff to get quota in promotion with effect from 2016, Supreme Court Collegium recommends CJs to five HCs; and more","link":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/morning-digest-december-29-2023/article67684917.ece","keywords":["india"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Here is a select list of stories to start the day","content":"AAP, BJP spar over rejection of Republic Day tableaux of Delhi, Punjab The Delhi and Punjab tableaux have been left out of the upcoming Republic Day parade due to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “dirty politics”, the Aam Aadmi Party alleged on Thursday. The BJP hit back, terming it shameful that the AAP, which is in power in both States, was politicising a decision taken by a special committee. “If the Delhi government had the chance, they would have showcased their education and health models in the Republic Day parade,” AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, noting that Delhi is the country’s capital. Disabled staff to get quota in promotion with effect from 2016 The Union government on Thursday issued an order paving the way for Persons with Disabilities to be considered for reservation in promotions up to the lowest rung of Group A posts in the Central government, with effect from June 30, 2016. June 30, 2016 is the day on which the Supreme Court had initially ruled that PwD candidates must be entitled to reservation in promotions irrespective of whether the positions were filled through reservation or not. Suspension of MPs extends beyond the last sitting of Parliament In a first, the suspension of the Opposition MPs, most of whom were suspended till the end of the Session, has not been revoked since both Houses of Parliament that adjourned sine-die on last Thursday, has not yet been prorogued. The notification to prorogue the two Houses is expected in a day or two, parliamentary sources said. Out of the 146 MPs who were suspended from both Houses, 132 were suspended till “the remainder of the Session”. Three MPs from Lok Sabha and 11 MPs from Rajya Sabha have been suspended pending the report of the Privileges Committees of the respective House.

China decries Taiwan for ‘hyping up’ military threat, sends warplanes China’s defence ministry accused Taiwan’s government on Thursday of deliberately “hyping up” a military threat from China for electoral gain ahead of elections on the island in just over two weeks’ time, but again sent warplanes into the Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s Jan. 13 presidential and parliamentary election will shape the Chinese-claimed island’s relations with Beijing, which over the past four years has ramped up military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims. Maharashtra sets up COVID-19 task force again Considering the increase in number of COVID-19 cases daily in the State, the Maharashtra government has once again formed the COVID-19 special task force.

People with comorbidities are advised to be extra careful. The meeting was attended by district officials and district health departments. The task force would issue a list of medicines and guidelines soon to ensure uniformity in treatment. Delay in Rajasthan Cabinet formation leaves BJP leaders baffled The inordinate delay in forming a Cabinet in Rajasthan after the BJP was elected to power earlier this month has left party leaders here baffled. As of Thursday there was no indication about a likely date for a swearing in. Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma who has visited New Delhi twice to meet senior leaders has not thrown any light on the status of the Cabinet either. The delay has especially perturbed young BJP MLAs, many of whom were expecting that they might get an opportunity to serve as Ministers in the same manner as the first-time Sanganer MLA Mr. Sharma, who was picked for the Chief Minister’s post. However, legislators are not willing to openly stake their claims. Tharoor hints at 2024 being his last contest RCongress Working Committee member and Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor spoke on Thursday about providing opportunities for younger people to contest polls, indicating that his upcoming fight from Thiruvananthapuram in the general elections may be his last in the constituency. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a Congress programme here, Mr. Tharoor, however, said there was no finality about it since it was politics. “I do believe that at some point, the time comes to make room for younger people. And that’s my thinking,” he said. Ben Stokes hits back at Harmison’s remarks of England losing 5-0 against India England Test skipper Ben Stokes hit back at former cricketer Steve Harmison for his remarks on England’s lack of preparation for their upcoming Test series against India .Former pacer Harmison who is also a close friend of Stokes questioned England arriving in India just three days before the five-match Test series.

Modi govt. trying to ‘cover up’ worst territorial setbacks in eastern Ladakh in past six decades: Congress The Narendra Modi government is trying to “cover up” the worst territorial setback in six decades as Chinese troops have been denying Indian patrols access to the strategic Depsang Plains, Demchok and other areas in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, the Congress alleged on Thursday. The party’s communications chief Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, quoted Chushul councillor Konchok Stanzin who claimed that a landmark at the site of the legendary Rezang La battle of the 1962 Sino-India conflict in Ladakh was dismantled as part of the disengagement process with China. Israel bombs Gaza as UN warns civilians face ‘grave peril’ Israeli forces on Thursday heavily bombed the besieged Gaza Strip as the centre of fierce combat against Hamas moves steadily south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering. The war, which started with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated much of northern Gaza as air and artillery strikes and house-to-house fighting have become heaviest in the southern city of Khan Yunis. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, reported more than 200 deaths “including entire families” over the past 24 hours in strikes across the territory.

Narendra Modi government failed to empower OBCs, Dalits: Rahul Gandhi Launching a broadside against the Narendra Modi government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday censured the Centre on the alleged lack of representation of other backward classes (OBCs), Dalits and Adivasis across many sectors, while accusing the BJP of taking India back to pre-Independence days where princely states colluded with their British masters. Addressing the ‘ Hain Taiyyar Hum ’ (we are ready) rally in Nagpur on the occasion of the Congress’ 139th Foundation Day, Mr. Gandhi reiterated that a caste census would be conducted if the Opposition INDIA alliance came to power after the 2024 general election.

Gerard Whateley floated the idea of the first ball on Boxing Day being bowled at 12:00pm to allow for a much larger crowd to start the day’s play. Watch Australia v Pakistan on Kayo Sports.

A final decision on the start time would ultimately be left to Cricket Australia, but Melbourne Cricket Club CEO Stuart Fox agrees it’s a conversation that needs to be had. “I think you’re using the data to run a good case here and it’s hard to run against,” Fox told SEN radio . “I love the traditional timeslot and I love the fact that it hasn’t changed but I think we’ve got to be up for the discussion and I think that data suggests that if you did start around midday, you’re going to have a lot more people inside the stadium watching the game. “I think that’d be really special.” There are calls to push the start time on Boxing Day to 12:00pm Source: News Corp Australia Cricket Australia has indicated a change in start time is not something they would consider any time soon. CA chief executive Nick Hockley has stated he supports the usual 10:30am start. However, Whateley noted on Friday morning, tradition and convention should not be confused given the history of the start time. “I’m amazed how people defer to tradition when there is no such tradition,” Whateley said. “10:30 is not the traditional starting time of Boxing Day, it was 11:00 for a long time. It’s a lazy argument to say tradition is this, it’s not. A packed MCG provides such a better atmosphere for Test cricket. Source: News Corp Australia “The television era moved the start times from 11 to 10:30 so that the news didn’t get interrupted. “So it’s completely flexible when these Test matches start. It’s convention, not tradition, and once convention doesn’t fit anymore it should be altered.” As of 10:00am on Day 4 the MCG had seen 146,842 fans come through the gate across the Test match, with just 3,598 in attendance to start Friday’s play.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:14:00","image_url":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d6281c62d6bf986b1e3a8cfb3da52fd4","source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"d328599ca32c52401ec7c652522146ab","title":"Mystery solved as controversial Pat Cummins wicket explained","link":"https://7news.com.au/sport/cricket/mystery-solved-as-controversial-pat-cummins-wicket-explained-c-13051880","keywords":null,"creator":["Ben Sutton"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Australian skipper was given out despite there appearing to be a gap between bat and ball.","content":"Former ICC umpire Simon Taufel has explained why Australian skipper Pat Cummins was given out on Day 4 of the Boxing Day against Pakistan at the MCG. Cummins was given out caught behind off the bowling of Aamer Jamal, but immediately sent the decision for a review. The DRS showed no mark on Hotspot, but the faintest spike appeared on Snicko prompting umpire Michael Gough to keep his original decision. Fans were left confused with replays showing a clear gap between bat and ball when the spike on Snicko appeared. But there was a simple explanation provided by Taufel. “This has got to do with the calibration between sight and sound. Of course sound does travel at different speed to light,” he said on Channel 7. “Before each day’s play, the technology providers do go out and calibrate the sounds particularly and so what we’re looking for is a spike as the ball goes past the bat or up to one frame past the bat which allows that distance between the noise and the stump microphone.” Commentators Alison Mitchell and Greg Blewett agreed with the decision. “That makes sense ... that there is a frame allowed either side. I remember when that change came in just to make an allowance for the physics of it,” Mitchell said. Blewett added: “Exactly right. Well explained by Simon. To the naked eye, the one frame where the spike is, you can see the ball is not next to the bat. Clear edge ... straightaway, the umpire’s finger was up, Pakistan fielders were all up.” Cummins (16) was the second wicket to fall early on Day 4 as the Aussies were eventually all out for 262. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey (53) helped push Australia’s lead over the crucial 300-mark with his highest score since the first Test of the Ashes in June. Star Pakistani quick Shaheen Afridi (4-76) made a welcome return to form with his best figures of the series, while fellow left-armer Mir Hamza (4-32) proved to be a serious handful. Pakistan, who have lost 15-straight Tests in Australia, will need to create history to avoid going down 2-0 in the Benaud-Qadir series. The highest successful fourth-innings chase at the MCG was England’s 7-332 in 1928. The last team to score more than 300 in the fourth innings of a MCG Test was Pakistan in a losing cause back in 1990. Carey’s crucial cameo takes pressure off the left-hander, who has been down on form with the bat and was dropped during Australia’s ODI World Cup campaign. Carey followed up on Mitch Marsh’s good work on Thursday when the allrounder smashed a sparkling 96. Marsh joined Steve Smith (50) at the crease when Australia were reeling at 4-16, but the pair put on a potentially matchwinning 153-run stand. The 32-year-old was given a life when Australia were 4-46 when he was dropped by Abdullah Shafique in the slips cordon. Shafique, who also dropped a simple chance on day one, was taken out of the slips on Friday and replaced by Babar Azam. The former Pakistan captain hung onto a brillant catch to dismiss Mitchell Starc to help bring Australia’s innings to a closer end.","pubDate":"2023-12-29 01:13:41","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13051880/572da31524135dd1e362cda3112860606760a7fd-16x9-x0y0w1920h1080.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"e0512920b751cd125e2d5e05d5cee189","title":"Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-12908083/Aussie-cricket-boss-says-just-THREE-Test-playing-nations-left-10-years-franchise-T20-cricket-threatens-future-Boxing-Day-Test.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely","content":"Aussie cricket boss says there could be just THREE Test playing nations left in 10 years as franchise T20 cricket threatens future of the Boxing Day Test New T20 leagues have started and the sport will be at the Olympics IPL sides are looking to contract players all year round Aussies fear they may not have quality Test opposition in the near future By Josh Alston For Daily Mail Australia Published: 20:02 EST, 28 December 2023 | Updated: 20:05 EST, 28 December 2023 e-mail View comments There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely. While crowd numbers continue to dwindle at Test matches, T20 cricket continues to surge globally. It received the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) seal of approval to be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Games while The International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates became the latest big money tournament in an already cluttered calendar. Major League Cricket also launched in the United States, backed by Microsoft and Adobe. However it is the surge of franchise T20 cricket that could drive the final nail into Test cricket. Sparse crowds have begun to plague cricket in Australia, with Marnus Labuschagne pictured in front of bays of empty seats against South Africa in January, 2023 Nathan Lyon took his milestone 500th Test wicket in front of bays of empty seats at Optus Stadium in Perth against Pakistan in the first Test South Africa has also struggled to bring the crowds in for their Boxing Day Test blockbuster against India - which they won The owners of eight of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises also own at least one team in another foreign competition, with that number set to expand in the coming years. It would create a situation where players would need to choose between T20 riches or representing their nation, with no room in the schedule to do both. That would mean only the most financially viable Test nations would be left standing, potentially meaning only Australia, England and India play the five-day game in the near future. It is not fearmongering or hyperbole, it is a real fear, Australian Cricketer's Association Todd Greenberg said. 'My message is, we're under pressure,' he told News Corp . 'Pressure might be a good thing, because it will lift all of our opportunities up and make us the best we can be, but other countries are really struggling, 'And we can't play against ourselves. So I'd like to think that Test cricket is more than just Australia, England and India in 10 years' time. 'We want to make sure that Pakistan and South Africa and New Zealand and others can continue to play against us. 'I worry that countries like South Africa and New Zealand in 10 years time may no longer be able to afford to have their best players playing and disappearing because of the push and pull of global leagues. 'So that is a concern. And I don't think I'm being an alarmist. I think I'm being a realist.' Australian Cricketers Association boss Todd Greenberg, pictured with his wife Lisa, believes Australia has to help battling nations stay relevant in Test cricket At present, Australia has seen the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and even renowned short-form specialist Glenn Maxwell shun the riches of franchise cricket to focus on their country. However with gun players turning down playing for their nation in other countries, Greenberg is aware that situation could change very quickly in Australia. 'We're already seeing countries all over the world and particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, where that's already happening,' he said. 'And so my message is, it's not happening here at the moment, and it might not feel like it's gonna happen here at the moment, but it's happening in other countries in our sport. 'So we'd be crazy not to think that those pressures aren't going to be applied to us at some point in time. So we've got to have this conversation now. Make sure we're ready,' Greenberg said. Major League Cricket in the United States is the latest T20 league to appear in an already cluttered calendar The IPL continues to go from strength to strength and now franchises are looking to own international clubs - which could mean players are contracted all-year round Greenberg is not the only cricket identity forewarning the death of Test cricket. English cricket icon David 'Bumble' Lloyd said the death of Test cricket would come within a decade back in 2022. 'Where will they put it? There's no room for Test cricket as we know it, and my guess is that in future we will only see the iconic series: like the Ashes, England vs West Indies and England vs India,' he wrote for Sportsmail . England cricket coach Brendon McCullum, who has been the architect of Bazball in a bid to revive Test cricket, also previously warned that the long-form of the game was at risk if England was not competitive. 'Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me,' he said in an interview with the ECB . 'But the popularity of it has somewhat trended south of late. 'So if Test cricket is to not just to sustain but thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand.
