Key has hit the ground running in his new role as managing director of men's cricket, announcing the appointment of Ben Stokes as red-ball captain on Thursday and advertising for two head coaches to lead the five-day and limited-overs sides. He has also signalled his intention to bring back the role of an independent national selector, a post abolished by his predecessor Ashley Giles. With coaching interviews planned to begin on May 9 and the international summer beginning with a Lord's Test against New Zealand on June 2, there is precious little wriggle room. The likes of Australian Simon Katich have been linked with the job. Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford, Stephen Fleming and Mahela Jayawardene are also names which have been floated, with Key already having begun a fact-finding mission that he hopes will help him land the right person. \"I haven't spoken to anyone yet, nobody is out of the running so far,\" he said. \"Every morning I wake up and read about who I've spoken to and all the names you read about would be very good if they got the chance to do it. I've got to work out who the best is. \"I'm optimistic - although it's not a sure thing - that we'll have a coach in place for that first Test.\" Less immediate, but no less important, is addressing the issue of selection. The decision to concentrate those powers in the hands of former head coach Chris Silverwood backfired and Key sees a return to the previous method. Key himself may take on those duties in the short-term, while the groundwork is laid. \"I want to go back to a selector, but I haven't got an answer now in my head for who that person is,\" he said. \"It's a very, very important job but it's a tricky job. All I can say is that we won't rush it to get that person in place. I'd rather have someone really good at it than rush it and have someone who's not. \"Until then, I'm pretty happy with the process that we'll have in place and with the people that are already involved in selection. If you need someone to point the gun at, you can point it at me, that doesn't really bother me.\" On a personal level, Key is enthusiastic about his newly powerful position in the English game - one which he embraced at the expense of an upwardly mobile broadcasting career. \"I was having a good life, yeah, cruising around,\" he said of his previous job on television. \"Nasser (Hussain), (Michael) Atherton, myself - we'd all sit around saying they should do this, they should do that. We're all stubborn and think we're right so when the chance came, I thought, 'now I actually have some skin in the game'. \"There's not much else I know other than cricket, really. It's what I love, it's what I talk about all the time and it's a chance to make a difference. \"English cricket is in a state of flux to say the least and that's what intrigues me about the job.\"","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6615932/2a8f1d5331fc4aea6fc3cd0307c06e559a3129f7-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"BRD-W vs MUM-W Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing XIs and Pitch Report for Senior Women’s T20 League 2022 Quarter-final 1","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/brd-w-vs-mum-w-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-xis-pitch-report-senior-women-s-t20-league-2022-quarter-final-1?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Sahil Jain"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-28 19:22:12","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/04/d6c22-16511673049688-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Umran Malik is a “gem” but should be managed carefully: Vettori","link":"https://kashmirreader.com/2022/04/29/umran-malik-is-a-gem-but-should-be-managed-carefully-vettori/","keywords":["SPORTS"],"creator":["Press Trust of India"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Delhi: Describing Sunrisers Hyderabad fast bowler Umran Malik as a “gem”, New Zealand bowling great Daniel Vettrori says the youngster’s raw pace generates anxiety among batters and brings an “X-factor” to the game.

Vettori, a former New Zealand captain and leg-spin great, said Malik was a “rare” talent emerging after the end of era of Brett Lee, Shoaib Akhtar and Shaun Tait. “That pace generates anxiety among batters and not just tailenders, it’s all batters,” Vettori told ESPNCricinfo’s ‘T20 Time Out’ show. “We don’t often see bowlers get around 153-154 mark. That’s exceptional pace, that’s a rarity that we haven’t seen I suppose consistently since the likes of (Brett) Lee, Shoaib Akhtar or Shaun Tait. “So to see that is a huge part of the game now. You can see the excitement factor, brings a bit of X-factor.” The 22-year-old Jammu and Kashmir player’s maiden five-for dismantled Gujarat Titans’ batting line-up in SRH’s IPL game before Rahul Tewatia and Rashid Khan pulled off a heist by hitting four sixes in the final over to win the match by five wickets. Vettori said the BCCI should quickly step in and manage Malik’s workload to safeguard his unique talent. “This is a gem here and it’s just how it’s looked after in the next couple of years for Indian cricket and how to get the best out of him. “Potentially. It might be the best thing for him coming under the umbrella of the BCCI or the NCA, and they can manage his workloads, because there is a temptation for a player of his pace to keep bowling.” “I am reflecting on my conversation with Shane Bond and the fact that he thought the more you bowled, the slower you got,” said Vettori, who had taken 362 wickets from 113 Tests and 305 scalps from 295 ODIs. Bond is the current bowling coach of Mumbai Indians in the IPL and also a Kiwi fast-bowling great. “In the subcontinent, you are used as a net bowler, you are going on tours and things like that. So the workload could get a bit much,” Vettori said. Former Mumbai Indians and Australia batter Chris Lynn said Malik should be fast-tracked into India’s squad for the T20 World Cup in Australia later this year as the bouncy and pacy nature of pitches Down under would suit the youngster’s bowling. “I will factor the wickets are bouncy here in Australia and you need I suppose that youth and just that guys haven’t played against it,” said Lynn, who played four ODIs and 18 T20Is for Australia between 2014 and 2018. “You keep going back to whom you drop because it is such a formidable (bowling) line-up, but would love to see this guy in the World Cup. “He’s going to take the world by the storm if he does get a chance at the international level. It is lucky that I am not a selector for India.” —PTI Press Trust of Indiakashmirreader.com","pubDate":"2022-04-28 19:12:55","image_url":null,"source_id":"kashmirreader","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"DC vs KKR: Shreyas Iyer demands fearless cricket from his team as KKR lose 5th successive match","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/ipl-2022/story/dc-vs-kkr-kolkata-loss-shreys-iyer-reaction-ipl-points-table-1943188-2022-04-28?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shreyas Iyer demands fearless cricket from his team as KKR lose 5th successive match","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-28 18:14:47","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatoday","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Australia Cricket Great Slater's Charges Dropped Over Mental Health","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/australia-cricket-great-michael-slaters-domestic-stalking-charges-dropped-over-mental-health-2930092","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Michael Slater faced charges of stalking or intimidation, breaching a restraining order, and using a carriage service -- such as a phone, email or social media -- to menace, harass or offend.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-28 17:09:54","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-04/rhkrsd4o_michael-slater-afp_625x300_28_April_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rob Key hints at Gary Kirsten appointment as England chief hails proposed head coach","link":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/england-gary-kirsten-rob-key-26825957","keywords":["Sport"],"creator":["mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Matthew Cooper)"],"video_url":null,"description":"Gary Kirsten is thought to be among the frontrunners to coach England's Test team and new Managing Director of Men's Cricket Rob Key has said he feels Kirsten \"would be very good at that job\"","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-28 17:01:00","image_url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article25809629.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_Head-Coach-Announcement-The-Hundred.jpg","source_id":"mirroruk","country":["united kingdom"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Virat Kohli will bounce back; just needs mental freshness, says Shane Watson","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-virat-kohli-will-bounce-back-just-needs-mental-freshness-says-shane-watson-740198","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"Virat Kohli has scored just 128 runs in 9 games in IPL 2022Kohli has suffered two consecutive duck dismissals this termRCB next take on GT in IPL 2022 on Saturday","content":"Virat Kohli has scored just 128 runs in 9 games in IPL 2022Virat Kohli has scored just 128 runs in 9 games in IPL 2022Former Australia batsman Shane Watson has backed Virat Kohli to bounce back from his current struggling phase.The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) star Kohli has scored just 128 runs in nine games at an average of 16 in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022.

The 42nd match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be played between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. The LSG have had a decent enough start to their maiden season in the marquee league as they have managed to stay in the top-4 of the points table with some impressive performances so far. With 5 wins out of 8 matches, they currently hold on to the 4th spot in the table. The PBSK, on the other hand, despite some big names in the line-up, have had an on-off run so far with some inconsistent performances from both their batters and the bowlers. With 4 wins and as many losses, they are presently placed at the 6th spot in the points table. Both the teams, however, are high on confidence after impressive victories during their previous respective matches. While Punjab would play their third match at the MCA Stadium, Lucknow are set to play their first match of the IPL season at this venue.

Moreover, with the matches being played on the used pitches, expect the ball to grip a bit with some uneven bounce also on offer. Having said that, the groundsmen have made sure to leave plenty of grass on the pitches, to provide some assistance to the pacers and the batters as well especially with the hard, new ball. So far, against the expectations, the pitches at the MCA stadium have assisted the batters as the venue has witnessed some high scoring games in the season so far. However, the nature of the pitch is likely to be more bowling friendly as they would keep tiring and become abrasive too with each successive match. Expect score in the vicinity of the 160-run mark as good enough total after batting first at this venue.

He took 18 wickets in 17 matches at an economy of 6.58. The wickets may seem less, but the batsmen couldn't read him and thus stopped taking risks against him. He was so impressive that he got drafted into the Indian side for the T20 world cup held in the UAE. That's where the downfall started. From being an absolute superstar for KKR in the , he failed to pick a single wicket for India at the T20 World Cup. Fast forward to 2022, the IPL couldn't have been less forgiving to him. He was dropped from the team in the game vs DC. Before being dropped from the team, he played 8 matches, took just 4 wickets, and had an economy of 8.82. As the economy tells you, the lack of wickets isn't due to the batters being cautious against him. They have figured out the mystery and are putting him under the pump.

Having said that, had Nitish not been around the 20-year-old Harshit, the latter would perhaps have not managed to grab the eyeballs of the KKR think-tank. An express pacer, who is believed to be the fastest bowler in the KKR squad currently, had managed to attract Nitish Rana’s attention during the Ranji Trophy selection camp for Delhi. Impressed with his raw pace, Nitish had recommended his name to Abhishek Nayar – KKR’s assistant coach, who invited Harshit to attent the franchise’s trials in Mumbai. While Harshit was not roped in by KKR during the mega auction, he finally had his way after pacer Rasikh Salam was ruled out from the league due to injury.

During the 41st match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant has won the Toss and elected to field first against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Having lost the previous four matches in the season, KKR have made as many as three changes to their playing 11 post the loss against the Gujarat Titans. It is worth of a mention that the Shreyas Iyer-led side has already made a total of 13 changes to their playing 11 so far, which is the most by any team in IPL 2022. While Australia’s limited Overs skipper Aaron Finch marks his return back after sitting out the previous match due to injury, Tamil Nadu’s experienced batter Baba Indrajith gets an opportunity to make his mark as he replaces the English wicket-keeper batter Sam Billings in the line-up. Also, as what can be termed a surprise inclusion, fast bowler Harshit Rana gets to make his maiden appearance in the IPL, as he replaces Shivam Mavi. #HarshitRana hai taiyaar! 💪 It’s #IPL debut for our young speedster.

He said former Prime Minister Imran Khan's decision to stop departmental cricket and their role in sports didn't appear to have done any good for Pakistan cricket or any other discipline. \"It has been three years now with no role of departments or institutions in cricket and other sports and what have we achieved so far?\" he questioned. Misbah noted that those departments and institutions which spent money on cricket were now spending that money somewhere else. \"They formed provincial association teams in domestic cricket but that has only resulted in administrative problems.\" Misbah said there was nothing wrong in the PCB experimenting with a new domestic cricket structure but at the same time the old system of departmental cricket could have been done away with only after the new system had started producing dividends. Promoted On the expected changes in the cricket board, Misbah maintained that a change of face wouldn't make any difference. \"I think that whoever is the chairman we should have a vision about how to run our cricket.

Kuldeep Yadav just loves to bowl against his ex-team. Not a debut to remember for Baba Indrajith! Yadav tosses it up, around off.

Once again Aaron Finch tries to dominate the bowler, rocks back with an ugly heave across the line but fails to connect. The only connection is made by the ball with the off stump. It's pegged back and Kolkata lose their first wicket. 1.2 overs (2 Runs) DROPPED! Sakariya angles across a length ball outside off, it's a premeditated charge from Finch who tries to power it over the leg side. The ball takes the top half and flies towards deep mid-wicket.

Two runs taken. 1.1 overs (0 Run) Chetan Sakariya begins his spell with an inswinger, around middle and leg, Finch tries to work it on the leg side but misses. Who will bowl from the other end?

Mustafizur Rahman immediately corrects his line and angles away a length ball outside off. Aaron Finch sticks back to cut but misses. 0.1 over (1 Run) Wide! Bit of a swing for Rahman but it starts from outside leg. Finch is seen giving the charge, he tries to flick but misses. All in readiness for the action. The Delhi players, in a different shade of blue, are in a huddle with Rishabh Pant giving a quick pep talk. Aaron Finch and Venkatesh Iyer are the openers for Kolkata. Mustafizur Rahman will start with the ball. Here we go... Andre Russell comes up for a quick word. The big West Indian says that the preparations have been excellent. Adds that everyone is hungry and pumped and they know the importance of the coming games. Admits that their season has not been going well so far. Further says that for him personally it's been going good with 200-plus runs and a few wickets. Feels that he needs to contribute more with the ball but he can't question the skipper much regarding giving him the ball as Shreyas is doing an excellent job. Dre Russ shares that his job is to take the team over the line or help them set the total. Shreyas Iyer, the captain of Kolkata, says that they would have bowled first as well, as the chasing teams have won a lot of games. Further says that the dew has gone completely and it's quite humid too. Adds that the players have to stand up and take responsibilities. Feels the contributions should be coming from everyone. Informs that they have three changes - Aaron Finch, Baba Indrajith and Harshit Rana come in. Admits that the combinations they have tried have not worked very well so far, tells that the execution was lacking and hopes to do well this evening. Rishabh Pant, the captain of Delhi, says that the pitch is looking slightly on the drier side and the dew will come into play later on. Adds that their strength has been backing each other and they stick together and move on together. Informs that they have a couple of changes - Mitchell Marsh and Chetan Sakariya are in, replacing Sarfaraz Khan and Khaleel Ahmed (injured). States the obvious that the team that plays the best will win in the end. Kolkata (Playing XI) - Aaron Finch (In for Sam Billings), Venkatesh Iyer, Shreyas Iyer (C), Rinku Singh, Nitish Rana, Baba Indrajith (WK) (In for Shivam Mavi), Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Tim Southee, Harshit Rana (In for Varun Chakaravarthy), Umesh Yadav. Delhi (Playing XI) - Prithvi Shaw, David Warner, Rishabh Pant (C/WK), Mitchell Marsh (In for Sarfaraz Khan), Lalit Yadav, Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Rovman Powell, Kuldeep Yadav, Mustafizur Rahman, Chetan Sakariya (In for Khaleel Ahmed). TOSS - Up goes the coin and it lands in the favour of Delhi. They have elected to BOWL first! Debut alert! Chetan Sakariya gets his Delhi cap while Baba Indrajith and Harshit Rana are all set to make their first appearance for Kolkata. Pitch report - Kevin Pietersen starts by informing us that they are using the same surface as yesterday. Adds that it's a spectacular pitch. Feels that the death bowling last evening was not good and that's something teams need to improve. Mentions that the batters will be licking their lips and the bowlers will have their task cut out. There is some positive update from the Delhi camp. Mitchell Marsh and Tim Seifert have recovered from COVID-19 and rejoined the squad but there is still uncertainty regarding their availability for this particular game. Ricky Ponting is back as well after completing his precautionary five-day isolation and his calm demeanour was certainly missed in the dugout when things got out of control in their last match. Both teams are placed precariously on the table and need a win to stay within touching distance of the top four. Kolkata's unsettled batting and Delhi's leaky bowling have been the main reason for their decline. Can Kolkata sort out their issues against a generous bowling attack, or will Delhi find its mojo and put the struggling Kolkata batting to the sword? We will find out as the evening progresses... Mumbai has been too hot and humid these days, and the action-packed Indian T20 League is taking this hotness to another level. We have hardly recovered from the humdinger last night, and here we are, ready to welcome you all for yet another game which promises to be pulsating. Delhi versus Kolkata, Pant versus Shreyas, the second time this season, and we're eager to know who takes the bragging rights this evening. Stay tuned for more... ...
