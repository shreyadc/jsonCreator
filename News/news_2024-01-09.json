From Usman Khawaja to Bob Simpson, and the six other men who have moved from Australia's middle-order to become regular openers in the past 70 years, all but one has seen his average improve when making the full-time switch to the top of the order. Selectors will on Wednesday announce their squad for the West Indies series, giving the first clear indication of who will open in place of the retired David Warner in Adelaide. It is becoming increasingly likely they will opt for a non-specialist opener to walk out alongside Khawaja on January 17. One option remains shifting Steve Smith to the top of the order in a bid to allow Green to be picked in his Sheffield Shield spot of No.4. But the path of minimum disruption would be for Green to open and the rest of Australia's order to stay put. When Warner announced his retirement plans on a cold English morning last June, it initially appeared the race to replace him was between three traditional openers: the Test squad's back-up batsman Marcus Harris, Sheffield Shield leading run-scorer Cameron Bancroft, and a man who has outperformed both of them at Test level; Matt Renshaw. But Mitch Marsh's runs at No.6 and Green's omission from the side have quickly changed that conversation. Coach Andrew McDonald hinted at the idea of a non-specialist opener going to the top in an interview with the ABC last month, pointing out the history of manufactured openers for Australia. The list of players who spent five or more Tests in the middle order before moving to the top includes Khawaja, Justin Langer, Shane Watson, Simon Katich, David Boon, Keith Stackpole and Simpson. All of those fared better as an opener than they had previously when in the side. Only Greg Blewett has moved from the middle order to open in 10 or more innings and performed poorer in the higher slot. There are mixed feelings on repeating the approach from within the ranks of reborn openers. Langer has called for a specialist to replace Warner at the top of the order, Katich is fine with a makeshift option in Green and Khawaja urged caution this week over shifting Smith from No.4. \"I say it's a specialist position in brackets, but anyone who can bat in the top four can open,\" Khawaja said. \"I just wouldn't want to sacrifice someone who is in my opinion the second-greatest ever Test batsman off the position that he's been batting is for so long. \"The beauty of Steve Smith is he's a beautiful No.4 batsman. He can bat against pace. He's really good against spin.\" OPENERS WHO MOVED FROM THE MIDDLE ORDER USMAN KHAWAJA: Average before opening - 39.41.

The Big Bottles returned to the field last Saturday the Christmas break with a win over Bribaree Rams at the sports ground. Star of the day for the Big Bottles was Wil Stanley who made a quick fire half century to help secure the win. Rams won the toss and elected to bat first in the 20Twenty encounter going on to set the Bottles a target of 150 after ending their innings at 6/149. Off the back of a 63 run opening stand between Josh Platt (40) and Noah Platt (18) Rams were cruising before the Big Bottles attack struck with Dan Canellis and Ben Klose combining to dismiss the former who had sent four deliveries over the boundary rope in his innings. This brought Josh Cameron to the crease who went on to top score for the Rams, smashing 46 from 37 deliveries. His innings included three sixes and two fours. Best of the bowlers for the Big Bottles was Klose who finished the day with three wickets from his four overs The other Rams wickets to fall were picked up by Daniel Canellis 1-17, Anthony Kennedy 1-28 and Jacob Kennedy 1-34. Wil Stanley, Rahuslsinh Zala and Tom Carnell also had a bowl without picking up a wicket. The Big Bottles run chase didn't start well with Daniel Canellis on his way back to the pavilion for 13 after being caught by Josh Cameron off the bowling of Caleb Schiller. Bruce Grey was the next to fall, run out for 22 in the pursuit of quick runs, taking the score to 2-48. His dismissal brought Anthony Kennedy to the crease who alongside Wil Stanley steered the Big Bottles to the win in the 17 over. Kennedy and Stanley both scored at better than a run a ball with Stanley finishing not out 59 from just 34 deliveries. Kennedy carried his bat for 20 from just 11 balls. Both batters found the boundary rope multiple times with Kennedy smashing two fours and two sixes and Stanley making light work of the bowling attack to help himself to four sixes and four fours. The Rams used nine players in an attempt to half the flow of runs with Caleb Schiller and Josh Platt the only two to pick up a wicket. Platt was easily the most economical of the bowlers returning figures of 1-2 from his single over. Rams captain Justin Boyd probably regrets his decision to bowl himself, costing his side 43 runs from his four overs. The Big Bottles take on Temora Bowling Club Tigers B Grade this Saturday at Gus Smith Oval while the Crocs are scheduled to take on the Harden Hornets at the Boorowa Sports Ground from 1.30pm on Saturday.

Followed categories will be added to My News. The music has stopped in the great Australian cricket game of musical chairs — and Cameron Bancroft has been left without a seat. The Western Australian batter has reportedly been snubbed by selectors with the full squad for Australia’s Test series against the West Indies to be confirmed on Tuesday night. The BBL is back! Watch every match live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > The decision about Warner’s replacement has been the most divisive issue this summer of cricket. Mitchell Johnson this week took a shot at selectors for failing to have a plan in place — knowing Warner’s plans to walk away after the Pakistan series. The news to emerge on Tuesday morning is that selectors have decided against going for a specialist opener and will instead turn to Steve Smith or allrounder Cameron Green to open the batting in the First Test, beginning on January 17 at the Adelaide Oval. The Sydney Morning Herald first reported Green and Smith are the frontrunners to partner Usman Khawaja. Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw were the obvious candidates to replace Warner, but the push to squeeze Green into the team has been too hard for selectors to ignore. Green has been unable to get his spot back in the team with Mitchell Marsh locking down the No. 6 role. The situation took a dramatic turn over the weekend with Smith publicly stating he wants to open the batting . Cameron Green, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft. Aussie legend Matthew Hayden this week declared his support for Renshaw, insisting selectors would be wrong to bump Smith up the order. However, former Aussie Test captain Michael Clarke has emphatically backed the concept of Smith moving to the top of the order. He said the added time Smith could get as an opening batter means he could even chase Brian Lara’s iconic 400-run record. “He is that good a player. It might be that challenge he’s looking for,” Clarke said on ESPN’s Around the Wicket Podcast. “If he opens, he will be the best opener within 12 months. Don’t be surprised if he breaks Brian Lara’s 400 record because he’s that good and now he’s got the whole day. “If he wants to do it, I think they will allow him to do it. Listening to Patty Cummins’ quotes, I think it’s a simple swap. I think Cameron Green is going to come in to open the batting for David Warner unless Steve Smith wants to do it. If he does, they might go Steve Smith to open and Cam Green at No. 4 or Green to No. 6.” Johnson earlier said Renshaw and Bancroft were the obvious options. Cameron Bancroft and David Warner. Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images. “Selectors have long known about Warner’s nominated retirement date and should have had a plan in place.” he wrote in a column for The West-Australian. “What have they been saying to State cricketers around selection - play in your position and score runs? “Cricket is all about being adaptable but it’s also a game where you need to be confident in your role – whether that’s at number three or four or as an opener.

What more can Bancroft have done to get another opportunity than be the Sheffield Shield’s leading run-scorer last season and again this season? “Either Bancroft or Renshaw deserve to open the batting with Usman Khawaja in the first Test against the West Indies later this month. “Bancroft, 31, because he has gone back and done what he was asked to do. Or Renshaw, 27, because he has had some success at Test level in the past and has more time left in the game.” Originally published as Cameron Bancroft overlooked for Australian Test squad for West Indies series More related stories SuperCoach BBL SuperCoach BBL: Best Aussie Test stars to target for round 8 The Aussie Test stars are flocking back to the BBL just in time to influence the SuperCoach BBL run home — here’s who you should target for round 8.

What I liked about the MostBet betting experience I liked several things about MostBet, from their attractive promotions to the endless options of markets in any sports events. It is the only site available for Bangladeshi players that offers a 125% deposit match up to 25,000 Bangladeshi Taka. It also gave me free spins to try out the platform before I put real cash on the table. Moreover, it came with free bet insurance, cashback on lost bets, and added bonuses with each top-up. With MostBet, I can easily deposit and transfer money in Bangladeshi currency from my Bangladeshi debit card.

However, I faced two difficulties: When I searched for the official Android app, a Google Play Store result popped up, which was inaccessible. I had to download the app from the MostBet site. Although I was pretty reluctant to download APKs from any site besides Google Play Store, it worked smoothly after installation and didn’t trigger any red flags. However, the app is available on the official Apple App Store. Hundreds of similar-looking but suspicious sites are available online, which can be pretty puzzling for an untrained eye. There is no country-specific domain (.bd) available either. Improvements MostBet could implement Regarding features, security, betting options, and support, MostBet is ahead of its prime competitors. But according to my experience, there are four scopes of improvements: MostBet must consider having a Bangla-speaking support team to cater to players from Bangladesh and West Bengal, India (although the site is available in Bangla). They should start live-streaming some sports events, especially cricket matches. The average email support response time is around 5 hours, which can be minimized. They must include more betting markets for the BPL (Bangladesh Premier League) matches. Things to consider when joining MostBet MostBet is about ease of operation, where even beginners can put a stake without guidance. However, you must remember certain things to unlock this site's full potential. You must read the terms and conditions before signing up. You must verify your account by submitting two official documents before you opt for a withdrawal. To get the most out of the 125% bonus, make your first deposit within 15 minutes of opening an account. It is convenient to use the app for betting, but the MostBet site will give more options on a single screen. If you forget your password or sense any suspicious activity, promptly contact the support center and report your issue. Conclusion MostBet BD has exceeded my expectations with its user-friendly interface and diverse gaming options. Whether you're a sports lover or a casino enthusiast, this platform caters to all.

Warner saved his best words for his wife with a on Monday night. “I write this with a lot of emotions. What can I say!!! Honestly, you, , are the reason I made it this far,” the post began. “I’ve said it many times before: 4 am wake-ups, you’re off your head. Cricket players do not need to do this, but the thought of what discipline meant to me was that I didn’t know the real meaning. “We don’t train at that hour, we don’t play at that hour, but what it does do is change mindset to what impossible is to be made possible. I can’t thank you enough for entering my world and giving me the best chance of doing what I love for as long as I did. “You’ve faced challenges with grace and determination, showing me what true courage looks like. Your unwavering support and boundless optimism have been a source of inspiration for me, and I am grateful for the way you’ve transformed my world with your presence. I can’t imagine life without you. “You’ve shown me the true meaning of love, and I am forever grateful to have you by my side. Your unwavering belief in me has given me the strength to push forward, and your unwavering love has shown me the beauty of the human you are. “You’ve also constantly been there for our girls when I was away and never once have I ever heard you say this is tough, challenging or too hard. You’re solid, loyal and my goodness tough as nails. There is no better role model than you for our three beauties. “Thank you for being my partner, my rock, in this incredible journey called life. I am grateful for your love, your strength, and your support. Here’s to you, my love, for being the extraordinary woman that you are. I am blessed to have you in my life, and I will cherish you always. I love you.” Warner and Candice married in 2015 and have three daughters together, and the star batter often talks about the importance of family in his life. Warner bowed out of Test cricket as Australia’s fifth-highest run-scorer in history with 8786 runs at an average of 44.59. He also retired from ODI cricket, but is expected to still play franchise T20 cricket around the world. Warner also expressed an interest in coaching down the track. “Yeah, I’ve got ambitions later down the track to potentially coach; I’ll have to speak with the wife first to see if I’m allowed a few more days away,” Warner said with a laugh after his final Test.","pubDate":"2024-01-08 23:38:18","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13159373/af8bd3c2578a7dbc8c7ab4f3209a2cab8bc2bf58-16x9-x0y2w1920h1080.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"8aefdd5abbfbcc277bc81df280da6691","title":"Aussie star’s takedown of Ponting gripe as ‘substandard' BBL pitch drama escalates","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/domestic-cricket/big-bash/aussie-stars-takedown-of-ponting-gripe-as-substandard-bbl-pitch-drama-escalates/news-story/95d36e00399a559690b8623c75942f61","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Big Bash spin star Ashton Agar has rubbished suggestions from Ricky Ponting that the Sydney Showgrounds wicket was substandard declaring it was a good “lesson” for players with international ambitions given other wickets around the world are “more extreme”.","content":"Big Bash spin star Ashton Agar has rubbished suggestions from Ricky Ponting that the Sydney Showgrounds wicket was substandard declaring it was a good “lesson” for players with international ambitions given other wickets around the world are “more extreme”. Agar returned the second most economical figures in Big Bash history for the Perth Scorchers on Monday night, finishing with 2-6 and 18 dot balls in his four over spell as his team took down the Sydney Thunder. The Scorchers bowling attack combined for 57 dot balls in the game as batters battled. Ponting lashed the pitch, which produced significant spin and “reacted big” according to Agar, calling it “substandard” for the BBL. Agar was less scathing and instead said a full day of rain in Sydney before the game would have contributed to the “tacky” nature of the pitch. The left-arm spinner also said rather than talk down the pitch, which made batting hard for both teams, he and any other players with hopes of playing overseas should take the “learnings” of having to adapt to conditions which so many Australian players are not used to. “The Big Bash is an entertaining game and you want to see high scores and balls flying over the fence, but there’s a lot to take away from games like that for guys who go overseas,” Agar said. “We went to Bangladesh (in 2022) and the wickets were even more extreme than that. You are going to have pitches like that around the world. “It’s nice to have a conducive wicket (to spin). It’s not often you get to bowl on those pitches but you have to make them count when you do. “I’ve played a on a few pitches like that around the world. I know what to bowl early to see what will happen, when it happens, you stick to that.” Pitches have been an issue for the BBL this season with Melbourne Renegades coach David Saker unhappy with those produced at Marvel Stadium this season. During their most recent loss, Saker said his team had played three games at their home ground and faced “three different pitches” which impacted preparation. His team’s opening match of the season in Geelong was also abandoned after it was deemed too dangerous, with water seeping under the covers after a storm blew through before the match. That games was also against the Scorchers, but captain Aaron Hardie didn’t think the Showgrounds wicket was dangerous. But he did think the slow, spinning nature of the wicket made it hard fort players to produced the spectacle expected of the Big Bash. “I think there were some unplayable deliveries out there. With both pace bowlers and the spinners. A few balls spinning sideways,” he said. “I certainly don’t think at any point it was dangerous, but certainly different to where we come from. And whether it’s the spectacle that everybody wants to see, I’m not sure on that.”","pubDate":"2024-01-08 23:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"c09cb58565763e455476da185a9286f9","title":"इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ टेस्ट सीरीज से पहले चमका धुरंधर,डबल सेंचुरी से ठोकी दावेदारी","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/cricket/india-vs-england-cheteshwar-pujara-double-century-strong-reply-to-selector-before-england-test-series-7967523.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"केपटाउन में भारत ने मेजबान टीम को महज डेढ दिन में ढेर कर दिया. दो मैचों की सीरीज को 1-1 से बराबर करने के बाद अब टीम इंडिया को अगले मिशन की तैयारी करनी है. अपने घर पर भारत को इंग्लैंड के साथ खेलना है और इसके लिए टीम इंडिया के बाहर चल रहे एक धुरंधर ने अपनी दावेदारी पेश की है.","content":"कोच राहुल द्रविड़ के साथ प्रैक्टिस के दौरान चेतेश्वर पुजारा-AP नई दिल्ली. भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम ने नए साल की शुरुआत साउथ अफ्रीका में दमदार टेस्ट जीत के साथ की. केपटाउन में भारत ने मेजबान टीम को महज डेढ दिन में ढेर कर दिया. दो मैचों की सीरीज को 1-1 से बराबर करने के बाद अब टीम इंडिया को अगले मिशन की तैयारी करनी है. अपने घर पर भारत को इंग्लैंड के साथ खेलना है और इसके लिए टीम इंडिया के बाहर चल रहे एक धुरंधर ने अपनी दावेदारी पेश की है. आईसीसी टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल में दो बार जगह बनाने के बाद भी खिताब जीतने में नाकाम रही भारतीय टीम इस बार इसे नहीं चूकना चाहेगी. सबसे पहले टीम इंडिया का लक्ष्य इस साल होने वाली टेस्ट सीरीज को जीतने पर है. नए साल की शुरुआत इंग्लैंड जैसी ताकतवर टीम के साथ रोहित शर्मा की टीम अपने घर पर ही करने वाली है. 5 मैचों की टेस्ट सीरीज का आगाज इसी महीने होना है. इस टीम में जगह बनाने के लिए दिग्गज चेतेश्वर पुजारा ने दावेदारी पेश कर दी है. डबल सेंचुरी ठोक पेश की दावेदारी वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल में ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ खेलने के बाद टीम इंडिया के बाहर हुए चेतेश्वर पुजारा को वापसी करनी है. वह इसके लिए मैदान पर उतरकर धमाका करते हुए चयनकर्ताओं को जवाब दे रहे हैं. रणजी ट्रॉफी के नए सीजन के पहले ही मैच में झारखंड के खिलाफ खेलते हुए उन्होंने डबल सेंचुरी ठोक डाली. 30 चौके मारते हुए 356 गेंद का सामना कर इस धुरंधर ने 243 रन की पारी खेल डाली. टेस्ट सीरीज का कार्यक्रम भारत और इंग्लैंड के बीच पहला टेस्ट मैच 25 से 29 जनवरी के बीच हैदराबाद में खेला जाना है. दूसरे मुकाबले में दोनों टीमें 2 से 6 फरवरी के बीच विशाखापत्तनम में आमने सामने होंगी. 15 फरवरी से 19 फरवरी के बीच राजकोट में तीसरा मुकाबला खेला जाना है. 23 फरवरी से 27 फरवरी के बीच रांची में चौथा टेस्ट मैच खेला जाएगा. सीरीज का आखिरी मुकाबले 7 से 11 मार्च के बीच धर्मशाला में खेला जाना है. .

From Usman Khawaja to Bob Simpson, and the six other men who have moved from Australia's middle-order to become regular openers in the past 70 years, all but one has seen his average improve when making the full-time switch to the top of the order. Selectors will on Wednesday announce their squad for the West Indies series, giving the first clear indication of who will open in place of the retired David Warner in Adelaide. It is becoming increasingly likely they will opt for a non-specialist opener to walk out alongside Khawaja on January 17. One option remains shifting Steve Smith to the top of the order in a bid to allow Green to be picked in his Sheffield Shield spot of No.4. But the path of minimum disruption would be for Green to open and the rest of Australia's order to stay put. When Warner announced his retirement plans on a cold English morning last June, it initially appeared the race to replace him was between three traditional openers: the Test squad's back-up batsman Marcus Harris, Sheffield Shield leading run-scorer Cameron Bancroft, and a man who has outperformed both of them at Test level; Matt Renshaw. But Mitch Marsh's runs at No.6 and Green's omission from the side have quickly changed that conversation. Coach Andrew McDonald hinted at the idea of a non-specialist opener going to the top in an interview with the ABC last month, pointing out the history of manufactured openers for Australia. The list of players who spent five or more Tests in the middle order before moving to the top includes Khawaja, Justin Langer, Shane Watson, Simon Katich, David Boon, Keith Stackpole and Simpson. All of those fared better as an opener than they had previously when in the side. Only Greg Blewett has moved from the middle order to open in 10 or more innings and performed poorer in the higher slot. There are mixed feelings on repeating the approach from within the ranks of reborn openers. Langer has called for a specialist to replace Warner at the top of the order, Katich is fine with a makeshift option in Green and Khawaja urged caution this week over shifting Smith from No.4. \"I say it's a specialist position in brackets, but anyone who can bat in the top four can open,\" Khawaja said. \"I just wouldn't want to sacrifice someone who is in my opinion the second-greatest ever Test batsman off the position that he's been batting is for so long. \"The beauty of Steve Smith is he's a beautiful No.4 batsman. He can bat against pace. He's really good against spin.\" OPENERS WHO MOVED FROM THE MIDDLE ORDER USMAN KHAWAJA: Average before opening - 39.41.

The Big Bottles returned to the field last Saturday the Christmas break with a win over Bribaree Rams at the sports ground. Star of the day for the Big Bottles was Wil Stanley who made a quick fire half century to help secure the win. Rams won the toss and elected to bat first in the 20Twenty encounter going on to set the Bottles a target of 150 after ending their innings at 6/149. Off the back of a 63 run opening stand between Josh Platt (40) and Noah Platt (18) Rams were cruising before the Big Bottles attack struck with Dan Canellis and Ben Klose combining to dismiss the former who had sent four deliveries over the boundary rope in his innings. This brought Josh Cameron to the crease who went on to top score for the Rams, smashing 46 from 37 deliveries. His innings included three sixes and two fours. Best of the bowlers for the Big Bottles was Klose who finished the day with three wickets from his four overs The other Rams wickets to fall were picked up by Daniel Canellis 1-17, Anthony Kennedy 1-28 and Jacob Kennedy 1-34. Wil Stanley, Rahuslsinh Zala and Tom Carnell also had a bowl without picking up a wicket. The Big Bottles run chase didn't start well with Daniel Canellis on his way back to the pavilion for 13 after being caught by Josh Cameron off the bowling of Caleb Schiller. Bruce Grey was the next to fall, run out for 22 in the pursuit of quick runs, taking the score to 2-48. His dismissal brought Anthony Kennedy to the crease who alongside Wil Stanley steered the Big Bottles to the win in the 17 over. Kennedy and Stanley both scored at better than a run a ball with Stanley finishing not out 59 from just 34 deliveries. Kennedy carried his bat for 20 from just 11 balls. Both batters found the boundary rope multiple times with Kennedy smashing two fours and two sixes and Stanley making light work of the bowling attack to help himself to four sixes and four fours. The Rams used nine players in an attempt to half the flow of runs with Caleb Schiller and Josh Platt the only two to pick up a wicket. Platt was easily the most economical of the bowlers returning figures of 1-2 from his single over. Rams captain Justin Boyd probably regrets his decision to bowl himself, costing his side 43 runs from his four overs. The Big Bottles take on Temora Bowling Club Tigers B Grade this Saturday at Gus Smith Oval while the Crocs are scheduled to take on the Harden Hornets at the Boorowa Sports Ground from 1.30pm on Saturday.

Followed categories will be added to My News. The music has stopped in the great Australian cricket game of musical chairs — and Cameron Bancroft has been left without a seat. The Western Australian batter has reportedly been snubbed by selectors with the full squad for Australia’s Test series against the West Indies to be confirmed on Tuesday night. The BBL is back! Watch every match live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > The decision about Warner’s replacement has been the most divisive issue this summer of cricket. Mitchell Johnson this week took a shot at selectors for failing to have a plan in place — knowing Warner’s plans to walk away after the Pakistan series. The news to emerge on Tuesday morning is that selectors have decided against going for a specialist opener and will instead turn to Steve Smith or allrounder Cameron Green to open the batting in the First Test, beginning on January 17 at the Adelaide Oval. The Sydney Morning Herald first reported Green and Smith are the frontrunners to partner Usman Khawaja. Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw were the obvious candidates to replace Warner, but the push to squeeze Green into the team has been too hard for selectors to ignore. Green has been unable to get his spot back in the team with Mitchell Marsh locking down the No. 6 role. The situation took a dramatic turn over the weekend with Smith publicly stating he wants to open the batting . Cameron Green, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft. Aussie legend Matthew Hayden this week declared his support for Renshaw, insisting selectors would be wrong to bump Smith up the order. However, former Aussie Test captain Michael Clarke has emphatically backed the concept of Smith moving to the top of the order. He said the added time Smith could get as an opening batter means he could even chase Brian Lara’s iconic 400-run record. “He is that good a player. It might be that challenge he’s looking for,” Clarke said on ESPN’s Around the Wicket Podcast. “If he opens, he will be the best opener within 12 months. Don’t be surprised if he breaks Brian Lara’s 400 record because he’s that good and now he’s got the whole day. “If he wants to do it, I think they will allow him to do it. Listening to Patty Cummins’ quotes, I think it’s a simple swap. I think Cameron Green is going to come in to open the batting for David Warner unless Steve Smith wants to do it. If he does, they might go Steve Smith to open and Cam Green at No. 4 or Green to No. 6.” Johnson earlier said Renshaw and Bancroft were the obvious options. Cameron Bancroft and David Warner. Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images. “Selectors have long known about Warner’s nominated retirement date and should have had a plan in place.” he wrote in a column for The West-Australian. “What have they been saying to State cricketers around selection - play in your position and score runs? “Cricket is all about being adaptable but it’s also a game where you need to be confident in your role – whether that’s at number three or four or as an opener.

What more can Bancroft have done to get another opportunity than be the Sheffield Shield’s leading run-scorer last season and again this season? “Either Bancroft or Renshaw deserve to open the batting with Usman Khawaja in the first Test against the West Indies later this month. “Bancroft, 31, because he has gone back and done what he was asked to do. Or Renshaw, 27, because he has had some success at Test level in the past and has more time left in the game.” Originally published as Cameron Bancroft overlooked for Australian Test squad for West Indies series More related stories SuperCoach BBL SuperCoach BBL: Best Aussie Test stars to target for round 8 The Aussie Test stars are flocking back to the BBL just in time to influence the SuperCoach BBL run home — here’s who you should target for round 8.

What I liked about the MostBet betting experience I liked several things about MostBet, from their attractive promotions to the endless options of markets in any sports events. It is the only site available for Bangladeshi players that offers a 125% deposit match up to 25,000 Bangladeshi Taka. It also gave me free spins to try out the platform before I put real cash on the table. Moreover, it came with free bet insurance, cashback on lost bets, and added bonuses with each top-up. With MostBet, I can easily deposit and transfer money in Bangladeshi currency from my Bangladeshi debit card.

However, I faced two difficulties: When I searched for the official Android app, a Google Play Store result popped up, which was inaccessible. I had to download the app from the MostBet site. Although I was pretty reluctant to download APKs from any site besides Google Play Store, it worked smoothly after installation and didn’t trigger any red flags. However, the app is available on the official Apple App Store. Hundreds of similar-looking but suspicious sites are available online, which can be pretty puzzling for an untrained eye. There is no country-specific domain (.bd) available either. Improvements MostBet could implement Regarding features, security, betting options, and support, MostBet is ahead of its prime competitors. But according to my experience, there are four scopes of improvements: MostBet must consider having a Bangla-speaking support team to cater to players from Bangladesh and West Bengal, India (although the site is available in Bangla). They should start live-streaming some sports events, especially cricket matches. The average email support response time is around 5 hours, which can be minimized. They must include more betting markets for the BPL (Bangladesh Premier League) matches. Things to consider when joining MostBet MostBet is about ease of operation, where even beginners can put a stake without guidance. However, you must remember certain things to unlock this site's full potential. You must read the terms and conditions before signing up. You must verify your account by submitting two official documents before you opt for a withdrawal. To get the most out of the 125% bonus, make your first deposit within 15 minutes of opening an account. It is convenient to use the app for betting, but the MostBet site will give more options on a single screen. If you forget your password or sense any suspicious activity, promptly contact the support center and report your issue.

The 37-year-old gifted a lucky fan the gloves and helmet he wore in his final match and broke down in tears speaking about his family in his on-field interview. Warner saved his best words for his wife with a on Monday night. “I write this with a lot of emotions. What can I say!!! Honestly, you, , are the reason I made it this far,” the post began. “I’ve said it many times before: 4 am wake-ups, you’re off your head. Cricket players do not need to do this, but the thought of what discipline meant to me was that I didn’t know the real meaning. “We don’t train at that hour, we don’t play at that hour, but what it does do is change mindset to what impossible is to be made possible. I can’t thank you enough for entering my world and giving me the best chance of doing what I love for as long as I did. “You’ve faced challenges with grace and determination, showing me what true courage looks like. Your unwavering support and boundless optimism have been a source of inspiration for me, and I am grateful for the way you’ve transformed my world with your presence. I can’t imagine life without you. “You’ve shown me the true meaning of love, and I am forever grateful to have you by my side. Your unwavering belief in me has given me the strength to push forward, and your unwavering love has shown me the beauty of the human you are. “You’ve also constantly been there for our girls when I was away and never once have I ever heard you say this is tough, challenging or too hard. You’re solid, loyal and my goodness tough as nails. There is no better role model than you for our three beauties. “Thank you for being my partner, my rock, in this incredible journey called life. I am grateful for your love, your strength, and your support. Here’s to you, my love, for being the extraordinary woman that you are. I am blessed to have you in my life, and I will cherish you always. I love you.” Warner and Candice married in 2015 and have three daughters together, and the star batter often talks about the importance of family in his life. Warner bowed out of Test cricket as Australia’s fifth-highest run-scorer in history with 8786 runs at an average of 44.59. He also retired from ODI cricket, but is expected to still play franchise T20 cricket around the world. Warner also expressed an interest in coaching down the track. “Yeah, I’ve got ambitions later down the track to potentially coach; I’ll have to speak with the wife first to see if I’m allowed a few more days away,” Warner said with a laugh after his final Test.","pubDate":"2024-01-08 23:38:18","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13159373/af8bd3c2578a7dbc8c7ab4f3209a2cab8bc2bf58-16x9-x0y2w1920h1080.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"8aefdd5abbfbcc277bc81df280da6691","title":"Aussie star’s takedown of Ponting gripe as ‘substandard' BBL pitch drama escalates","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/domestic-cricket/big-bash/aussie-stars-takedown-of-ponting-gripe-as-substandard-bbl-pitch-drama-escalates/news-story/95d36e00399a559690b8623c75942f61","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Big Bash spin star Ashton Agar has rubbished suggestions from Ricky Ponting that the Sydney Showgrounds wicket was substandard declaring it was a good “lesson” for players with international ambitions given other wickets around the world are “more extreme”.","content":"Big Bash spin star Ashton Agar has rubbished suggestions from Ricky Ponting that the Sydney Showgrounds wicket was substandard declaring it was a good “lesson” for players with international ambitions given other wickets around the world are “more extreme”. Agar returned the second most economical figures in Big Bash history for the Perth Scorchers on Monday night, finishing with 2-6 and 18 dot balls in his four over spell as his team took down the Sydney Thunder. The Scorchers bowling attack combined for 57 dot balls in the game as batters battled. Ponting lashed the pitch, which produced significant spin and “reacted big” according to Agar, calling it “substandard” for the BBL. Agar was less scathing and instead said a full day of rain in Sydney before the game would have contributed to the “tacky” nature of the pitch. The left-arm spinner also said rather than talk down the pitch, which made batting hard for both teams, he and any other players with hopes of playing overseas should take the “learnings” of having to adapt to conditions which so many Australian players are not used to. “The Big Bash is an entertaining game and you want to see high scores and balls flying over the fence, but there’s a lot to take away from games like that for guys who go overseas,” Agar said. “We went to Bangladesh (in 2022) and the wickets were even more extreme than that. You are going to have pitches like that around the world. “It’s nice to have a conducive wicket (to spin). It’s not often you get to bowl on those pitches but you have to make them count when you do. “I’ve played a on a few pitches like that around the world. I know what to bowl early to see what will happen, when it happens, you stick to that.” Pitches have been an issue for the BBL this season with Melbourne Renegades coach David Saker unhappy with those produced at Marvel Stadium this season. During their most recent loss, Saker said his team had played three games at their home ground and faced “three different pitches” which impacted preparation. His team’s opening match of the season in Geelong was also abandoned after it was deemed too dangerous, with water seeping under the covers after a storm blew through before the match. That games was also against the Scorchers, but captain Aaron Hardie didn’t think the Showgrounds wicket was dangerous. But he did think the slow, spinning nature of the wicket made it hard fort players to produced the spectacle expected of the Big Bash. “I think there were some unplayable deliveries out there. With both pace bowlers and the spinners. A few balls spinning sideways,” he said. “I certainly don’t think at any point it was dangerous, but certainly different to where we come from. And whether it’s the spectacle that everybody wants to see, I’m not sure on that.”","pubDate":"2024-01-08 23:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"c09cb58565763e455476da185a9286f9","title":"इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ टेस्ट सीरीज से पहले चमका धुरंधर,डबल सेंचुरी से ठोकी दावेदारी","link":"https://hindi.news18.com/cricket/india-vs-england-cheteshwar-pujara-double-century-strong-reply-to-selector-before-england-test-series-7967523.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"केपटाउन में भारत ने मेजबान टीम को महज डेढ दिन में ढेर कर दिया. दो मैचों की सीरीज को 1-1 से बराबर करने के बाद अब टीम इंडिया को अगले मिशन की तैयारी करनी है. अपने घर पर भारत को इंग्लैंड के साथ खेलना है और इसके लिए टीम इंडिया के बाहर चल रहे एक धुरंधर ने अपनी दावेदारी पेश की है.","content":"कोच राहुल द्रविड़ के साथ प्रैक्टिस के दौरान चेतेश्वर पुजारा-AP नई दिल्ली. भारतीय क्रिकेट टीम ने नए साल की शुरुआत साउथ अफ्रीका में दमदार टेस्ट जीत के साथ की. केपटाउन में भारत ने मेजबान टीम को महज डेढ दिन में ढेर कर दिया. दो मैचों की सीरीज को 1-1 से बराबर करने के बाद अब टीम इंडिया को अगले मिशन की तैयारी करनी है. अपने घर पर भारत को इंग्लैंड के साथ खेलना है और इसके लिए टीम इंडिया के बाहर चल रहे एक धुरंधर ने अपनी दावेदारी पेश की है. आईसीसी टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल में दो बार जगह बनाने के बाद भी खिताब जीतने में नाकाम रही भारतीय टीम इस बार इसे नहीं चूकना चाहेगी. सबसे पहले टीम इंडिया का लक्ष्य इस साल होने वाली टेस्ट सीरीज को जीतने पर है. नए साल की शुरुआत इंग्लैंड जैसी ताकतवर टीम के साथ रोहित शर्मा की टीम अपने घर पर ही करने वाली है. 5 मैचों की टेस्ट सीरीज का आगाज इसी महीने होना है. इस टीम में जगह बनाने के लिए दिग्गज चेतेश्वर पुजारा ने दावेदारी पेश कर दी है. डबल सेंचुरी ठोक पेश की दावेदारी वर्ल्ड टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप फाइनल में ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ खेलने के बाद टीम इंडिया के बाहर हुए चेतेश्वर पुजारा को वापसी करनी है. वह इसके लिए मैदान पर उतरकर धमाका करते हुए चयनकर्ताओं को जवाब दे रहे हैं. रणजी ट्रॉफी के नए सीजन के पहले ही मैच में झारखंड के खिलाफ खेलते हुए उन्होंने डबल सेंचुरी ठोक डाली. 30 चौके मारते हुए 356 गेंद का सामना कर इस धुरंधर ने 243 रन की पारी खेल डाली. टेस्ट सीरीज का कार्यक्रम भारत और इंग्लैंड के बीच पहला टेस्ट मैच 25 से 29 जनवरी के बीच हैदराबाद में खेला जाना है. दूसरे मुकाबले में दोनों टीमें 2 से 6 फरवरी के बीच विशाखापत्तनम में आमने सामने होंगी. 15 फरवरी से 19 फरवरी के बीच राजकोट में तीसरा मुकाबला खेला जाना है. 23 फरवरी से 27 फरवरी के बीच रांची में चौथा टेस्ट मैच खेला जाएगा. सीरीज का आखिरी मुकाबले 7 से 11 मार्च के बीच धर्मशाला में खेला जाना है. .

From Usman Khawaja to Bob Simpson, and the six other men who have moved from Australia's middle-order to become regular openers in the past 70 years, all but one has seen his average improve when making the full-time switch to the top of the order. Selectors will on Wednesday announce their squad for the West Indies series, giving the first clear indication of who will open in place of the retired David Warner in Adelaide. It is becoming increasingly likely they will opt for a non-specialist opener to walk out alongside Khawaja on January 17. One option remains shifting Steve Smith to the top of the order in a bid to allow Green to be picked in his Sheffield Shield spot of No.4. But the path of minimum disruption would be for Green to open and the rest of Australia's order to stay put. When Warner announced his retirement plans on a cold English morning last June, it initially appeared the race to replace him was between three traditional openers: the Test squad's back-up batsman Marcus Harris, Sheffield Shield leading run-scorer Cameron Bancroft, and a man who has outperformed both of them at Test level; Matt Renshaw. But Mitch Marsh's runs at No.6 and Green's omission from the side have quickly changed that conversation. Coach Andrew McDonald hinted at the idea of a non-specialist opener going to the top in an interview with the ABC last month, pointing out the history of manufactured openers for Australia. The list of players who spent five or more Tests in the middle order before moving to the top includes Khawaja, Justin Langer, Shane Watson, Simon Katich, David Boon, Keith Stackpole and Simpson. All of those fared better as an opener than they had previously when in the side. Only Greg Blewett has moved from the middle order to open in 10 or more innings and performed poorer in the higher slot. There are mixed feelings on repeating the approach from within the ranks of reborn openers. Langer has called for a specialist to replace Warner at the top of the order, Katich is fine with a makeshift option in Green and Khawaja urged caution this week over shifting Smith from No.4. \"I say it's a specialist position in brackets, but anyone who can bat in the top four can open,\" Khawaja said. \"I just wouldn't want to sacrifice someone who is in my opinion the second-greatest ever Test batsman off the position that he's been batting is for so long. \"The beauty of Steve Smith is he's a beautiful No.4 batsman. He can bat against pace. He's really good against spin.\" OPENERS WHO MOVED FROM THE MIDDLE ORDER USMAN KHAWAJA: Average before opening - 39.41.

The Big Bottles returned to the field last Saturday the Christmas break with a win over Bribaree Rams at the sports ground. Star of the day for the Big Bottles was Wil Stanley who made a quick fire half century to help secure the win. Rams won the toss and elected to bat first in the 20Twenty encounter going on to set the Bottles a target of 150 after ending their innings at 6/149. Off the back of a 63 run opening stand between Josh Platt (40) and Noah Platt (18) Rams were cruising before the Big Bottles attack struck with Dan Canellis and Ben Klose combining to dismiss the former who had sent four deliveries over the boundary rope in his innings. This brought Josh Cameron to the crease who went on to top score for the Rams, smashing 46 from 37 deliveries. His innings included three sixes and two fours. Best of the bowlers for the Big Bottles was Klose who finished the day with three wickets from his four overs The other Rams wickets to fall were picked up by Daniel Canellis 1-17, Anthony Kennedy 1-28 and Jacob Kennedy 1-34. Wil Stanley, Rahuslsinh Zala and Tom Carnell also had a bowl without picking up a wicket. The Big Bottles run chase didn't start well with Daniel Canellis on his way back to the pavilion for 13 after being caught by Josh Cameron off the bowling of Caleb Schiller. Bruce Grey was the next to fall, run out for 22 in the pursuit of quick runs, taking the score to 2-48. His dismissal brought Anthony Kennedy to the crease who alongside Wil Stanley steered the Big Bottles to the win in the 17 over. Kennedy and Stanley both scored at better than a run a ball with Stanley finishing not out 59 from just 34 deliveries. Kennedy carried his bat for 20 from just 11 balls. Both batters found the boundary rope multiple times with Kennedy smashing two fours and two sixes and Stanley making light work of the bowling attack to help himself to four sixes and four fours. The Rams used nine players in an attempt to half the flow of runs with Caleb Schiller and Josh Platt the only two to pick up a wicket. Platt was easily the most economical of the bowlers returning figures of 1-2 from his single over. Rams captain Justin Boyd probably regrets his decision to bowl himself, costing his side 43 runs from his four overs. The Big Bottles take on Temora Bowling Club Tigers B Grade this Saturday at Gus Smith Oval while the Crocs are scheduled to take on the Harden Hornets at the Boorowa Sports Ground from 1.30pm on Saturday.

Followed categories will be added to My News. The music has stopped in the great Australian cricket game of musical chairs — and Cameron Bancroft has been left without a seat. The Western Australian batter has reportedly been snubbed by selectors with the full squad for Australia’s Test series against the West Indies to be confirmed on Tuesday night. The BBL is back! Watch every match live with no ad breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > The decision about Warner’s replacement has been the most divisive issue this summer of cricket. Mitchell Johnson this week took a shot at selectors for failing to have a plan in place — knowing Warner’s plans to walk away after the Pakistan series. The news to emerge on Tuesday morning is that selectors have decided against going for a specialist opener and will instead turn to Steve Smith or allrounder Cameron Green to open the batting in the First Test, beginning on January 17 at the Adelaide Oval. The Sydney Morning Herald first reported Green and Smith are the frontrunners to partner Usman Khawaja. Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw were the obvious candidates to replace Warner, but the push to squeeze Green into the team has been too hard for selectors to ignore. Green has been unable to get his spot back in the team with Mitchell Marsh locking down the No. 6 role. The situation took a dramatic turn over the weekend with Smith publicly stating he wants to open the batting . Cameron Green, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft. Aussie legend Matthew Hayden this week declared his support for Renshaw, insisting selectors would be wrong to bump Smith up the order. However, former Aussie Test captain Michael Clarke has emphatically backed the concept of Smith moving to the top of the order. He said the added time Smith could get as an opening batter means he could even chase Brian Lara’s iconic 400-run record. “He is that good a player. It might be that challenge he’s looking for,” Clarke said on ESPN’s Around the Wicket Podcast. “If he opens, he will be the best opener within 12 months. Don’t be surprised if he breaks Brian Lara’s 400 record because he’s that good and now he’s got the whole day. “If he wants to do it, I think they will allow him to do it. Listening to Patty Cummins’ quotes, I think it’s a simple swap. I think Cameron Green is going to come in to open the batting for David Warner unless Steve Smith wants to do it. If he does, they might go Steve Smith to open and Cam Green at No. 4 or Green to No. 6.” Johnson earlier said Renshaw and Bancroft were the obvious options. Cameron Bancroft and David Warner. Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images. “Selectors have long known about Warner’s nominated retirement date and should have had a plan in place.” he wrote in a column for The West-Australian. “What have they been saying to State cricketers around selection - play in your position and score runs? “Cricket is all about being adaptable but it’s also a game where you need to be confident in your role – whether that’s at number three or four or as an opener.

What more can Bancroft have done to get another opportunity than be the Sheffield Shield’s leading run-scorer last season and again this season? “Either Bancroft or Renshaw deserve to open the batting with Usman Khawaja in the first Test against the West Indies later this month. “Bancroft, 31, because he has gone back and done what he was asked to do. Or Renshaw, 27, because he has had some success at Test level in the past and has more time left in the game.” Originally published as Cameron Bancroft overlooked for Australian Test squad for West Indies series More related stories SuperCoach BBL SuperCoach BBL: Best Aussie Test stars to target for round 8 The Aussie Test stars are flocking back to the BBL just in time to influence the SuperCoach BBL run home — here’s who you should target for round 8.

What I liked about the MostBet betting experience I liked several things about MostBet, from their attractive promotions to the endless options of markets in any sports events. It is the only site available for Bangladeshi players that offers a 125% deposit match up to 25,000 Bangladeshi Taka. It also gave me free spins to try out the platform before I put real cash on the table. Moreover, it came with free bet insurance, cashback on lost bets, and added bonuses with each top-up. With MostBet, I can easily deposit and transfer money in Bangladeshi currency from my Bangladeshi debit card. Cryptocurrency options are also available for punters needing anonymity for their financial transactions. [btn url=\"https://x6wsuwnavtmst.com/Mchs\" text_color=\"#ffffff\" bg_color=\"#8224e3\" icon=\"\" icon_position=\"start\" size=\"18\" id=\"\" target=\"\"]JOIN MOSTBET[/btn] What I had difficulties with on MostBet Out of hundreds of betting apps I have tried till now, MostBet is truly top of the line in features, ease of use, and variety of betting options. However, I faced two difficulties: When I searched for the official Android app, a Google Play Store result popped up, which was inaccessible. I had to download the app from the MostBet site. Although I was pretty reluctant to download APKs from any site besides Google Play Store, it worked smoothly after installation and didn’t trigger any red flags. However, the app is available on the official Apple App Store. Hundreds of similar-looking but suspicious sites are available online, which can be pretty puzzling for an untrained eye. There is no country-specific domain (.bd) available either. Improvements MostBet could implement Regarding features, security, betting options, and support, MostBet is ahead of its prime competitors. But according to my experience, there are four scopes of improvements: MostBet must consider having a Bangla-speaking support team to cater to players from Bangladesh and West Bengal, India (although the site is available in Bangla). They should start live-streaming some sports events, especially cricket matches. The average email support response time is around 5 hours, which can be minimized. They must include more betting markets for the BPL (Bangladesh Premier League) matches. Things to consider when joining MostBet MostBet is about ease of operation, where even beginners can put a stake without guidance.

The 37-year-old gifted a lucky fan the gloves and helmet he wore in his final match and broke down in tears speaking about his family in his on-field interview. Warner saved his best words for his wife with a on Monday night. “I write this with a lot of emotions. What can I say!!! Honestly, you, , are the reason I made it this far,” the post began. “I’ve said it many times before: 4 am wake-ups, you’re off your head. Cricket players do not need to do this, but the thought of what discipline meant to me was that I didn’t know the real meaning. “We don’t train at that hour, we don’t play at that hour, but what it does do is change mindset to what impossible is to be made possible. I can’t thank you enough for entering my world and giving me the best chance of doing what I love for as long as I did. “You’ve faced challenges with grace and determination, showing me what true courage looks like. Your unwavering support and boundless optimism have been a source of inspiration for me, and I am grateful for the way you’ve transformed my world with your presence. I can’t imagine life without you. “You’ve shown me the true meaning of love, and I am forever grateful to have you by my side. Your unwavering belief in me has given me the strength to push forward, and your unwavering love has shown me the beauty of the human you are. “You’ve also constantly been there for our girls when I was away and never once have I ever heard you say this is tough, challenging or too hard. You’re solid, loyal and my goodness tough as nails. There is no better role model than you for our three beauties. “Thank you for being my partner, my rock, in this incredible journey called life. I am grateful for your love, your strength, and your support. Here’s to you, my love, for being the extraordinary woman that you are. I am blessed to have you in my life, and I will cherish you always. I love you.” Warner and Candice married in 2015 and have three daughters together, and the star batter often talks about the importance of family in his life. Warner bowed out of Test cricket as Australia’s fifth-highest run-scorer in history with 8786 runs at an average of 44.59. He also retired from ODI cricket, but is expected to still play franchise T20 cricket around the world. Warner also expressed an interest in coaching down the track. “Yeah, I’ve got ambitions later down the track to potentially coach; I’ll have to speak with the wife first to see if I’m allowed a few more days away,” Warner said with a laugh after his final Test.","pubDate":"2024-01-08 23:38:18","image_url":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-13159373/af8bd3c2578a7dbc8c7ab4f3209a2cab8bc2bf58-16x9-x0y2w1920h1080.jpg","source_id":"7news","source_priority":7652,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"},{"article_id":"8aefdd5abbfbcc277bc81df280da6691","title":"Aussie star’s takedown of Ponting gripe as ‘substandard' BBL pitch drama escalates","link":"https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/domestic-cricket/big-bash/aussie-stars-takedown-of-ponting-gripe-as-substandard-bbl-pitch-drama-escalates/news-story/95d36e00399a559690b8623c75942f61","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Big Bash spin star Ashton Agar has rubbished suggestions from Ricky Ponting that the Sydney Showgrounds wicket was substandard declaring it was a good “lesson” for players with international ambitions given other wickets around the world are “more extreme”.","content":"Big Bash spin star Ashton Agar has rubbished suggestions from Ricky Ponting that the Sydney Showgrounds wicket was substandard declaring it was a good “lesson” for players with international ambitions given other wickets around the world are “more extreme”. Agar returned the second most economical figures in Big Bash history for the Perth Scorchers on Monday night, finishing with 2-6 and 18 dot balls in his four over spell as his team took down the Sydney Thunder. The Scorchers bowling attack combined for 57 dot balls in the game as batters battled. Ponting lashed the pitch, which produced significant spin and “reacted big” according to Agar, calling it “substandard” for the BBL. Agar was less scathing and instead said a full day of rain in Sydney before the game would have contributed to the “tacky” nature of the pitch. The left-arm spinner also said rather than talk down the pitch, which made batting hard for both teams, he and any other players with hopes of playing overseas should take the “learnings” of having to adapt to conditions which so many Australian players are not used to. “The Big Bash is an entertaining game and you want to see high scores and balls flying over the fence, but there’s a lot to take away from games like that for guys who go overseas,” Agar said. “We went to Bangladesh (in 2022) and the wickets were even more extreme than that. You are going to have pitches like that around the world. “It’s nice to have a conducive wicket (to spin). It’s not often you get to bowl on those pitches but you have to make them count when you do. “I’ve played a on a few pitches like that around the world. I know what to bowl early to see what will happen, when it happens, you stick to that.” Pitches have been an issue for the BBL this season with Melbourne Renegades coach David Saker unhappy with those produced at Marvel Stadium this season. During their most recent loss, Saker said his team had played three games at their home ground and faced “three different pitches” which impacted preparation. His team’s opening match of the season in Geelong was also abandoned after it was deemed too dangerous, with water seeping under the covers after a storm blew through before the match. That games was also against the Scorchers, but captain Aaron Hardie didn’t think the Showgrounds wicket was dangerous. But he did think the slow, spinning nature of the wicket made it hard fort players to produced the spectacle expected of the Big Bash. “I think there were some unplayable deliveries out there. With both pace bowlers and the spinners. A few balls spinning sideways,” he said. “I certainly don’t think at any point it was dangerous, but certainly different to where we come from. And whether it’s the spectacle that everybody wants to see, I’m not sure on that.”","pubDate":"2024-01-08 23:22:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","source_priority":11250,"country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLAN"}]}
