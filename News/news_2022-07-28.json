India have defeated West Indies by 119 runs (DLS Method) in the recently concluded third ODI at Queen’s Park Oval to register a 3-0 series whitewash. In what was the 23rd bilateral ODI series (10th in West Indies) between these two teams, India have now extended their series lead to 15-8. In the last decade and a half, India have won 12 consecutive ODI bilateral ODI series against West Indies. A sixth bilateral ODI series victory in West Indies means that India have now won their last eight ODIs in a row against this opposition. West Indies, on the other hand, have lost their ninth successive ODI since last month. IND vs WI Man of the Series 2022 Playing an ODI series after more than 18 months with not even a single List A match in this period, India batter Shubman Gill celebrated his ODI comeback by emerging as the highest run-scorer in the series. In the three innings of his third ODI series (all away from home), Gill scored 205 runs at an average and strike rate of 102.50 each. Among the three batters to score a couple of half-centuries in this series in addition to scoring maximum fours (18), Gill was rightly declared the Player of the Series for the first time in his international career. Half-centuries at both ends fired #TeamIndia to a flyer. Shikhar Dhawan brought up his 3⃣7⃣th half-century while Shubman Gill reached his 2⃣nd ODI fifty to stitch a fine partnership of 1⃣1⃣3⃣ for the opening stand. – 113/1 (23)#PlayBold #WIvIND pic.twitter.com/b2uzILoGA3 — Royal Challengers Bangalore (@RCBTweets) July 27, 2022 Readers must note that Gill also bagged the Player of the Match award in Port of Spain on Wednesday. Gill, who had top-scored with 98* (98) to become the 17th batter to remain unbeaten on 98 in an ODI innings as the Indian innings was forcefully brought to a standstill by two rain breaks, earned applause from captain and opening partner Shikhar Dhawan during the post-match presentation ceremony.

Gilchrist’s statement came after a report in The Australian emerged claiming that David Warner asked for permission to participate in the first season of the United Arab Emirates T20 League, to be known as the ILT20. Watch South Africa’s Tour of England. Every ODI & T20 Live & On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > Earlier in July, South Africa pulled out of a three-match ODI series against Australia in January 2023, allowing several of Aussie international stars to play in the second half of the BBL. But Warner reportedly wants to play elsewhere and Gilchrist feels it could have a serious knock-on effect. “This is the big kicker, isn’t it, of possibly being the step towards being contracted to the club before or over country for the predominant amount of cricket you play,” Gilchrist told SEN . “I think it would almost be commercial suicide for them (Cricket Australia) to allow a player like him (Warner) to go head-to-head up against their own competition. Pavel Florin nominates for BBL Draft | 00:41 MORE COVERAGE Revealed: BBL Draft’s English explosion as T20 freak heads monster crew ‘Nothing is impossible’: Romanian cult hero nominates for BBL draft ‘Get on with it’: Aussie legend calls for end to Warner’s leadership ban “They can’t force David Warner to play in the BBL. I understand that. But to let him then go off, or another player, let’s not just single out Warner, because there will be other players on the radar, it’s all part of this, I guess, global dominance that these IPL franchises are starting to create given they own a number of teams in the Caribbean Premier League. They own all six teams I believe in the new South African tournament that’s coming up, which will be locking horns for commercial space and airtime with the Big Bash.” Gilchrist felt that it’s perhaps less of a problem with most of the current crop of Australian internationals but it could become a serious issue when the next generation of stars begin to come through and are faced with such a decision. “David Warner, again, using him as an example, we can’t question his commitment to Australian cricket over the years, he’s carved out one of the great careers,” Gilchrist said. “If he rides off into the sunset and says, ‘Sorry Australian cricket, I’m going to become a gun for hire for my Indian franchise team in various tournaments’, you can’t question him on that, that’s his prerogative and he’s done everything he needs to get the profile and get that market value. Adam Gilchrist thinks David Warner might simply play for a match fee. (Photo by Jonathan DiMaggio/Getty Images for T20 World Cup) Source: Getty Images “It’s the new younger player coming in that starts to make those noises where it’ll be really challenging. “Perhaps it’s the first example where David Warner doesn’t sign a contract with Cricket Australia at all, he just plays for a match fee. “He goes and plays wherever he wants but says, ‘I’m available for every Test match, for every one-day international and every T20 international’ by way of example, I’ll be there for you in national colours. “But other than that, I’m going to play my club, my franchise cricket, wherever I want to knowing that none of those big tournaments will be clashing with international cricket.” Warner, who has not played in the BBL since 2013, could earn as much as $AUD2.1 million in the ILT20. The 35-year-old is signed to the Delhi Capitals in the IPL and their co-owners GMR Group also now owns the Dubai Capitals in the ILT20. The UAE-based tournament is set to run from January 6 to February 12 while the BBL will take place from December 13 to February 4.","pubDate":"2022-07-27 23:10:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"foxsports","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"South Africa concede 33-runs in HORROR over","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/south-africa-concede-33runs-in-horror-over/video/c7835ed7cb542f787359e536cc6763ce","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Andile Phehlukwayo had an over to forget after he conceded 5 sixes and saw a sitter dropped of his bowling against England.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-27 23:09:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Moeen BLUDGEONS fastest 50 ever for England","link":"https://www.cairnspost.com.au/sport/cricket/moeen-bludgeons-fastest-50-ever-for-england/video/1b96e56c8f87274c4b9226d606f1f3e2","keywords":["Cricket news and galleries"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Cricket: Moeen Ali has recorded the fastest 50 ever scored by an Englishman after reaching the milestone in just 16 deliveries against the Proteas.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-27 23:09:20","image_url":null,"source_id":"cairnspost","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket: Finn Allen century leads Black Caps to big win over Scotland","link":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/sport/cricket-finn-allen-century-leads-black-caps-to-big-win-over-scotland/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Black Caps opener Finn Allen scored his maiden Twenty20 ton for New Zealand as the side cruised to a 68-run win in the opening match against Scotland in Edinburgh this morning. The 23-year-old, playing in his tenth match, made 101 off just 56 balls with 36 of those runs coming from sixes. He's just the fifth Black Caps player to bring up three figures in the Twenty20 format. Batting first, Allen and Martin Guptill (40) put on 85 for the opening wicket to launch a strong platform for the middle order to get New Zealand past 200. Guptill (3399) became the highest run scorer in Twenty20 history when he passed Rohit Sharma's 3379, having played eight fewer innings. Glenn Phillips (23), Daryl Mitchell (23) and Jimmy Neesham (30 off nine balls) all contributed as the Black Caps finished on 225 for five. Allen and Phillips combined for 27 off a Chris Sole over including a no-ball six by Allen followed by a four off the free hit. Allen brought up his fifty in 33 balls before reaching his hundred 21 deliveries later in the 18th over by lofting a full toss back over bowler Mark Watt to the boundary. 79 off the last five overs, helping largely by Neesham's big striking, ensured a total that always looked out of reach of the hosts. Scotland also had a decent start with George Munsey (28) and Calum MacLeod (33) putting on 62 before the spin of Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner turned the match New Zealand's way. Sodhi finished with 4-28 along with Santner's 2-23 as Scotland finished on 157 for eight. \"I feel like I've been hitting the ball quite well lately. Nice to get a few out of the middle and get a good score on the board for your country,\" Allen said on his man of the match performance. Allen's showing comes on the back of fellow newcomer Michael Bracewell making the most of his maiden series against Ireland with the likes of Kane Williamson, Devon Conway, Trent Boult and Tim Southee rested for the tour. Black Caps stand-in skipper Santner said the rookies were making the most of their chances. \"The depth in our squad is obviously on show at the moment and guys coming through are taking an opportunity straight away which is obviously great for us to see going forward,\" he said. The defeat was Scotland's sixth in a row and follows what has been a poor week off the field for Scotland Cricket. The leadership of Scottish cricket was found to be institutionally racist by an independent review. The review was published Tuesday following a seven-month investigation sparked by allegations from Scotland's all-time leading wicket-taker, Majid Haq, and his former teammate, Qasim Sheikh. It found that governing body Cricket Scotland failed in 29 out of 31 indicators of institutional racism set out by a consultancy firm leading the investigation. The body only partially passed the other two tests and there were 448 examples of institutional racism. Hundreds of people came forward to recount their experiences as part of the investigation. From those conversations, 68 individual concerns have been referred for further investigation, including 31 allegations of racism against 15 people, two clubs and one regional association The allegations include racial abuse, the use of inappropriate language, favouritism toward white children from public schools, and a lack of a transparent selection process. The second Twenty20 takes place on Saturday morning NZT as Scotland still seek their first ever win over the Black Caps.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-27 23:08:27","image_url":"https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/a0qdkq0s/finn-allen-scored-his-maiden-t20-ton-against-scotland-getty.jpg","source_id":"newstalkzb","country":["new zealand"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"India vs West Indies Man of the Match today: Who won Man of the Match in IND vs WI 3rd ODI yesterday?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-india-vs-west-indies-man-of-the-match-today-who-won-man-of-the-match-in-ind-vs-wi-3rd-odi-yesterday/","keywords":["Cricket","India","India tour of West Indies 2022","Shubman Gill","West Indies"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"India vs West Indies Man of the Match: The Indian batter won his maiden match award in international cricket tonight.

During the third ODI of the ongoing India’s tour of West Indies in Port of Spain, India beat West Indies by 119 runs (DLS Method) to register a 3-0 series whitewash. Chasing a 257-run target in a 35-over rain-affected match, all West Indies could manage was 137 in 26 overs as their strategy of wanting to seal a challenging run-chase in a dead-rubber match resulted in them losing wickets at regular intervals. An innings comprising of four ducks and seven single-digit individual scores saw captain Nicholas Pooran (42) and batter Brandon King (42) top-scoring in a losing cause. Having put an end to a prospering 47-run third-wicket partnership between vice-captain Shai Hope (22) and King by dismissing the former, India spinner Yuzvendra Chahal picked his first wicket to follow it with three lower-order scalps. While figures of 4-0-17-4 made Chahal the pick of the Indian bowlers at the Queen’s Park Oval on Wednesday, fast bowlers Mohammed Siraj and Shardul Thakur also chipped in with a couple of wickets each. Sharing the new ball with Deepak Hooda, Siraj managed to draw first blood in the form of Kyle Mayers (0) and Shamarh Brooks (0) in his first over itself. India captain Shikhar Dhawan (58) winning the toss and deciding to bat first earlier in the day was followed by a 113-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (98*).

Having become the 17th batter to remain unbeaten on 98 in an ODI innings , Gill’s second ODI half-century was compensated with a maiden match award at the highest level. “It was bittersweet. I was expecting to get to a hundred. It was not under my control as it rained but I was happy with my innings. I was disappointed with how I got out in the first two matches. After the [first] rain break, we let our instincts take over,” Gill told ESPN Caribbean during the post-match presentation ceremony.","pubDate":"2022-07-27 23:05:07","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“This kid got game”: Vernon Philander expresses admiration for Tristan Stubbs maiden T20I 50 vs England in Bristol","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-this-kid-got-game-vernon-philander-expresses-admiration-for-tristan-stubbs-maiden-t20i-50-vs-england-in-bristol/","keywords":["Cricket","England","South Africa","South Africa tour of England 2022","Tristan Stubbs","Vernon Philander"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"Tristan Stubbs maiden T20I 50 vs England: The rookie South African batter earned applause from several former cricketers.

During the first T20I of South Africa’s tour of England 2022 in Bristol, England beat South Africa by 41 runs to go 1-0 up in a three-match series. Chasing a formidable 235-run target, South Africa lost two left-handed top-order batters in Quinton de Kock (2) and Rilee Rossouw (4) in the second over to do themselves no favour with the new ball. While opening batter Reeza Hendricks played well to score 57 (33) with the help of nine fours and a six, an embarrassing loss was primarily avoided by rookie batter Tristan Stubbs’ maiden T20I half-century. Batting for the first time at the highest level, Stubbs walked out to bat at No. 6 in the 10th over with his team needing 149 runs off 62 deliveries at almost 15 runs per over. Unperturbed by the improbable requirements of the situation, the right-handed batter scored 72 (28) including two fours and eight sixes to become an instant source of amazement for one and all. Off the mark by running a single on the first ball that he faced against England all-rounder Moeen Ali, Stubbs attacked the same bowler to hit three sixes in his next over to announce himself in international cricket by standing tall on his reputation. What followed was the 21-year old player targeting the likes of Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley, Richard Gleeson and Sam Curran to hit at least a six each in the next five overs respectively.

England posted a massive 234 for six in their 20 overs, helped by the small boundaries at the County Ground, as Moeen took 16 balls to reach 52 before he fell to South African seamer Lungi Ngidi who recorded career-best figures of 5-39. South Africa kept up with the rate for most of their reply but could not muster the explosive finish to match England in the final four overs as they ended on 193 for eight. The highlight was a thrilling 72 from 28 deliveries by 21-year-old Tristan Stubbs, who announced himself on the international stage with the second fastest half-century in T20 matches for South Africa, off 19 balls. Opener Reeza Hendricks scored a brisk 57 from 33 deliveries to get the innings under way, but the tourists left themselves with too much to do at the end. South Africa were at times their own worst enemies in the field, handing Bairstow four lives with a succession of relatively simple dropped catches. He was out for 90 from 53 balls having put on an exhilarating 106 runs from 35 deliveries with Moeen for the fourth wicket. South Africa bowled a shorter length to try to negate the small straight boundaries, but Bairstow and Moeen punished them square of the wicket as England struck 20 sixes, well past their previous T20 record of 15.

An eight-year-old schoolgirl called Tess capturing the zeitgeist by dancing deliriously to Sweet Caroline in the Bramall Lane stands. Ian Wright demanding, to a prime-time BBC audience of 9.3MILLION , that all girls must be given proper opportunities to play football at schools. And England’s Lionesses plastered across front and back pages. Tuesday provided a seismic, breakthrough moment for the English women’s game as Sarina Wiegman’s side hammered world-ranked No 2 Sweden 4-0 to reach Sunday’s Euros final . It feels as if there is no danger of the women’s game being shoved back to the sidelines after this. The nation have embraced the Lionesses, while sceptics and sexists will struggle to ignore, insult or patronise women’s football from now on. Who could have watched England supersub Alessia Russo nutmegging Swedish goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl with a back-heel and still question the levels of technique, or imagination, in the elite female game? England captain Leah Williamson says the team are feeling the support of the nation as they prepare for Sunday’s final at Wembley and are fully embracing it. Arsenal ace Williamson, 25, said: “To walk out on to that pitch [at Bramall Lane] was an incredible feeling and I can imagine at the weekend that will be incredible as well. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST NEW CUSTOMER SIGN UP DEALS “I’ve got a scarf around my neck which says ‘Home is where the heart is’ and to have our families on this journey, to walk out at Wembley, I think that is something we really have to take in. I want to appreciate it. “I am not much of a smiler pre-game, I keep it pretty much ‘game face’, because I am focused. “But the last two national anthems in the quarter-final and semi-final, I can’t help but smile because it feels amazing. I know I have a job to do but who says I can’t enjoy those moments and the team can’t enjoy those moments? “I hope that we are giving off that vibe [of relishing the atmosphere]. “It’s genuine and the crowd can enjoy that with us. “I hope that the crowd at Wembley is going to have as good a time as we are going to have, because I promise you, we will enjoy it. “We are changing the game — that’s what has happened.” Williamson was quick to praise some of the pioneers of the English women’s game, including former captain Carol Thomas, 67, as well as Jill Scott, 35, and 33-year-old Ellen White. The latter two are veteran members of the current squad, who inspired her as the sport moved into the professional era. But what of the next generation of aspiring players? And what of Wright’s demand about increased access to football for girls in schools? Well, given that PE has long been under-funded and under-appreciated in state schools — for boys and girls across all sports — the pathway to the top remains difficult. Note, for example, how cricket has failed to capitalise on supposed ‘breakthrough moments’ like the 2005 Ashes and 2019 World Cup, due to a woeful lack of opportunities to play the sport at non-fee-paying schools. Helen Marshall, whose daughter Matilda plays for MK Dons Under-14s, told me that football is not offered to girls in PE lessons at her Cambridgeshire secondary school — though a girls’ school team exists through the lucky existence of one motivated teacher. The recent scrapping of FA ‘accelerated coaching centres’ outside of major urban areas has been controversial and could be counterproductive — leading to the prospect of a postcode lottery for talented players who do not live close to Women’s Super League clubs. Matilda progressed through boys’ club football throughout her primary school years, with the girls’ club game still patchy in terms of accessibility and standard. And racial diversity in the elite women’s game has regressed. Wiegman’s starting 11 for each game at the Euros has been all-white. This is partly due to the fact that, since the WSL began in 2011, women’s teams have moved their bases out of cities and into the leafy suburbs. These are all significant problems as the women’s game looks to seize the opportunity provided by the Lionesses. But the impact of this summer’s tournament, so widely broadcast and reported on, promises to be immense.

A few more deliveries into his innings saw Ali hitting a six and a four off South Africa all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo to get going.

Continuing with his mediocre form this summer, England opening batter Jason Roy scoring 8 (15) was far away from an ideal start but contributions from fellow top-order batters namely Jos Buttler (22) and Dawid Malan (43) neutralized the negative impact caused by Roy. It is noteworthy that England wouldn’t have prospered in their batting innings to this extent had it not been for a shambolic South African fielding performance.

During the third ODI of the ongoing India’s tour of West Indies at the Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain, India’s opening batter Shubman Gill carried on with his decent run, to register his second fifty of the series today. Having already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, the opening pair of Gill and Shikhar Dhawan (58 off 74) yet again gave team India an ideal start with a 113-run partnership off 137 deliveries. Gill, who reached his half-century mark on the 60th delivery of his innings, upped the ante after the match resumed post a two-and-a-half-hour rain delay, and reduced to a 40-Over contest. On only his second delivery post the delay, the 22-year-old hit the Windies leg-spinner Hayden Walsh for a Six down the ground, to set his intentions straight as to how he would approach the rest of the innings. Having said that, with him just two runs shy of what would have been his maiden ODI century, rain descended at the Queen’s Park Oval yet again, as Gill agonizingly threaded off the field at his individual score of 98* off 98 deliveries. Shubman Gill highest score in ODI The latest news from the venue is that we will lose an Over for every four minutes lost due to rain from here on. With only four Overs remaining in the Indian innings, Gill’s innings would ultimately end on 98*, which is now also his highest score in the format. The Punjab batter had, during the first ODI of the ongoing series, scored his first ODI fifty as well, while scoring 64 brisk runs off 53 deliveries. In his 6 ODI innings so far, Gill has accumulated a total of 254 runs at an average of 50.80, with the help of two fifties.

Instead, a long golf driver, bent at the edge and gleaming silver, caught streaks of the Solihull sunlight, well before Edgbaston’s crackling opener pitting a fearless India shrugging their shoulders in a ‘so what’ manner against world champions Australia. Later in the net cage, Harmanpreet swapped the driver for a bat, and hit them far and nicely chunky, looking ready for the big battle ahead. “She uses the golf swing simulation for hip-shoulder dissociation. It’s her own unique thing,” explained Team India physio Anand Date. “Harman has a natural swing, and it helps her get into rhythm.” A dozen-odd nice drives, arms freed and shoulders unlocked with the hip and shoulders getting into proper six-hitting motion, Harman proceeded to the nets.

You know, you never know. Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian women’s team captain, playing a shot. (Twitter/ BCCI Women) The Indian team gave the first peek into Indian CWG jerseys – the BCCI logo missing on this rare occasion, and the I of India a three-band tricolour. Camped at a hotel with just the beach volleyball teams for company, it’s the closest they’ll experience a ‘Games village’ as accommodation is fragmented across the West Midlands for the Birmingham Games. The team flew in from Bengaluru and were upgraded to first class, one of few perks of being cricketers. Not all sports could afford that. But otherwise, they have been left to themselves. The opening ceremony is a no-go with the Indians playing the next day at 10.30 am. And the team is enjoying the rare instance of sharing rooms with fixed slots allotted. Some of the support staff, never trimmed for international tours, was checked into a hotel at their own cost, and the young team is in a good mind space hoping to hit Edgbaston with a bang. Harmanpreet Kaur in action. (Source: BCCI Twitter) A day before the Indians, the Barbados team was at Mosley – equally chattery and hitting long. But blasting music, more laidback before the women open their campaign. South Africa are arriving without two top names, and Australia are rusty. England as hosts are all primed, but it’s the Indians who will bring in the crowds – especially in the second pool game against Pakistan, with the local communities jointly excited to watch that faceoff. Yastika enjoying new role Yastika was told on match-eve during India’s recent tour of Sri Lanka that she would keep wickets. She had a faint whiff of it, but was simply glad that an extra batter could be accommodated if she strapped on the big gloves, and now an extra bowler can walk into the team with her taking on the additional mantle. “Since childhood, I’ve loved to keep wickets. I love the feel of the big gloves in the hands,” she says, adding that she continues sending videos to Kiran More, who’s helping her log in rapid improvements. Yastika Bhatia in action. (File) She’s undergone some serious mental strengthening work under Mugdha Bavare, who also works with Shreyas Iyer . “I wasn’t happy after the last tour but there were continuous matches. So, I began working on the mental aspect besides recovery, fitness and running techniques.” Yastika has put in work into her running technique, though she is some way from haring about like Smriti. “I feel lighter on the field now and match focus is high,” she says joking that she’s also a “free girl” now, having wrapped up her graduation. For the team, it was important to down Sri Lanka 3-0. “We wanted a clean sweep, usually we end up with 2-1.” This time the knife had to be driven down, twisting it deep, nice and proper. The last few weeks have turned Yastika into a movie buff, the latest from the Minions franchise her favourite, plus three movies in the last five days. Keeping wickets has also helped her get a wider lens affixed on the game. And like her idol MS Dhoni, she wants to bring astuteness in her game reading and aggression in her batting. But otherwise, it’s a lot of keeping the atmosphere light and playing pranks on Shafali Verma. “Bohot dinon ke baad roommates ko jhelna ho raha hai (We are getting roommates after a long time). So we are enjoying,” she laughs. Besides the throwdown pro, physio, masseuse and trainer, the team also has a dedicated video analysis unit for the first time. The Commonwealth Games might not be the World Cups cricket prizes traditionally, but the CWG medal holds the potential to push women’s cricket into the next orbit. Both hockey and cricket at the same Games gives Indians plenty to root for. It all started with a boundary-side golf swing though, of Harmanpreet, a la Bryson DeChambeau.

Sri Lanka, however, will have the hosting rights. “Considering the prevailing situation in Sri Lanka, the ACC, after extensive deliberation, has unanimously concluded that it would be appropriate to relocate the tournament from Sri Lanka to UAE,” the statement read. Sri Lanka is currently engaged in a Test series against Pakistan and also hosted the Australian men’s team and the Indian women’s cricket team recently, but with the political crisis worsening, the decision was taken to shift the tournament to UAE. “The ACC is mindful of the passionate Sri Lankan fans, hence the final decision to change the venue has been very difficult, but has been one that was deemed necessary. However, the thoughts of all ACC members remain in solidarity with the cricket-loving nation of Sri Lanka,” the statement said. “Every effort was made to host the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka and the decision to shift the venue to the UAE was taken after much deliberation. The UAE will be the new venue while Sri Lanka will continue to retain hosting rights. This edition of the Asia Cup is extremely important as it will help Asian nations prepare for the ICC World Cup, and I thank the SLC and the Emirates Cricket Board for their understanding and cooperation,” ACC president Jay Shah said. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) president Shammi Silva said, “We were really looking forward to hosting our Asian neighbours in Sri Lanka for the much-anticipated Asia Cup. While I fully stand by the ACC’s decision to shift the Asia Cup to UAE considering the current context and the magnitude of the event, Sri Lanka Cricket will work closely with the ACC and Emirates Cricket Board to ensure that we still have an exciting edition of the Asia Cup. The last time the six-team Asia Cup was played in 2018, India won the title by beating Bangladesh in the final.

David Miller will be leading the side in the T20Is, and the return of Kagiso Rabada will strengthen the side. Rilee Rossouw is also making his comeback after a brilliant T20 Blast season with Somerset. For England, their top-order has been struggling, and they would want to improve upon that. County Ground Bristol average score T20 The County Ground in Bristol is one of the better tracks to bat on in England. This is a flat track with an even amount of bounce, and the batters can play their shots accordingly. The boundaries of this ground are not that big, so it won’t be tough for the batters to clear the fences in this match. This ground has hosted a total of 3 T20Is so far, and that too in space of 12 long years. In all three games, the chasing teams emerged victorious. The average 1st innings score in these matches was 159 runs, but this just does not justify the actual nature of the track.

This is an excellent batting track and anything below 175 is going to be a below-par total here. The average 1st innings score in the T20 domestic matches played here at this ground has been 166 runs, and the chasing teams have dominated the results in those matches as well. Bristol cricket ground capacity The County Ground in Bristol serves as the home ground to the County side Gloucestershire.

During the third ODI of the ongoing India’s tour of West Indies in Port of Spain, India captain Shikhar Dhawan has won the toss and chose to bat in a dead-rubber contest. “We will bat first. We will like to post a good score. The best thing is everything is performing, nice to see that. That’s a big positive for us, happy with that. I feel that intent is important, but at the same time you need to be smart,” Dhawan told ESPN Caribbean at the toss. Heartbroken after finishing on the losing side of two consecutive close ODIs, West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran laid emphasis on remaining consistent to end an eight-match losing streak in this format. “The first two games, we were heartbroken. We are motivated today. We need to get over the line. We spoke about batting 50 overs but we need to be more consistent. We will get to see the result eventually,” Pooran told ESPN Caribbean at the toss. Why is Arshdeep Singh not playing today’s match vs West Indies? The only change made by the visitors has come in the form of fast bowler Prasidh Krishna returning in place of Avesh Khan. A solitary like-for-like replacement means that India have surprisingly refrained from giving opportunities to reserve players. Going by general discussions, wicket-keeper batter Ishan Kishan, uncapped batter Ruturaj Gaikwad and uncapped fast bowler Arshdeep Singh were expected to be playing at the Queen’s Park Oval tonight but that hasn’t happened.

With BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) only providing an injury update for all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja today, it remains unclear if Arshdeep has recovered and has been left out or continues to recover whilst being with the national squad just like Jadeja. Meanwhile, West Indies have made three changes to their Playing XI for this match. Batter Keacy Carty, all-rounder Jason Holder and pacer Keemo Paul have come in for batter Rovman Powell, all-rounder Romario Shepherd and pacer Alzarri Joseph.

Indian Premier League is arguably the biggest T20 league in the world, and the best players aim to take part in the tournament. It has been seen in recent times that the national team gives rest to the players from national duties in order to play in the IPL. BCCI’s secretary Jay Shah has said that there will be an extended window for the IPL from the next season. There has been a certain rise in the demand for decreasing the number of bilateral series. South Africa recently withdrew from the ODI series against Australia in order to concentrate on their new T20 league. Ravi Shastri roots for two IPL seasons in one year Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri has said that there could be two IPL seasons in one year in the future. He insists that one can be a full-fledged tournament, and the other one can be a short tournament in the latter part of the year. Shastri said that if bilateral series can be reduced, this thing can be done. “I think you might have two (IPL) seasons. I wouldn’t be surprised at all. If bilateral cricket is reduced, you might well have a shorter format of the IPL in the latter half of the year, more like a World Cup format with a knockout that decides the winner,” Shastri said on the latest episode of Vaughany and Tuffers Cricket Club Podcast.

He said that IPL is an industry on its own and its growth will be good for sports overall. According to Shastri, the lack of bilateral cricket will make the people more interested in the world cup. “The IPL will be tempted to go in that direction. It’s great for the sport, great for the players, broadcasters and people who work around the teams,” Shastri added. “You play fewer bilaterals and then you get together for the World Cups.

(It) seemed like a really good fit for us, to tap into his knowledge as we look to build the team for the World Cup,\" added Dravid. My role is to create environment for players to grow: Upton Upton, who has had his own unique people skills to deal with individual players, wants to be seen as a facilitator of optimum performance level from players in top-flight competition. \"Everybody has a natural motivational flow and part of my role is to help individuals find that natural motivation flow and for that we need to set up an environment that allows people to be themselves and to flourish,\" Upton said. To prove his point, he gave an analogy of how a gardener needs to create fertile land to grow beautiful flowers. \"If I give a simple analogy is to grow beautiful flowers, the gardener needs to create a fertile land. As coaches, our role is to create a fertile environment which helps our players to naturally grow and reach their fullest potential on and off the field,\" added Upton. According to Upton, if the team is in great mental space, performances will naturally flow in. \"If team is in great space performances are naturally going to flow. What we need to do is remove obstacles in those performances, individually and from team perspectives,” added Upton. \"Mental side of the game hasn't changed a lot but what has changed is Covid experience and lot of players have been on the road lot of the times, so there is an extra element of trying to get each individual player as well as the team as a whole in the best space possible. 'Me and Dravid are talking about cricket, life and spirituality since '96' Upton first met Dravid in 1996 when Strength and Conditioning coaches weren't in vogue and on his first tour of South Africa, he wanted to pick the former's brain. \"He (Dravid) has always been someone with such a hunger to learn, not just around game of cricket because he is a professor when it comes to game of cricket but about life and everything beyond cricket. \"We have been in conversation about life, cricket, spirituality since 1996. We picked up again when we joined the Indian team in 2008 with Gary Kirsten. \"So I have been in these conversations for a long time and super exciting to have those conversations every day and hopefully it goes towards setting up this Indian team for an unbelievable T20 World Cup,\" Upton signed off.","pubDate":"2022-07-27 13:36:02","image_url":null,"source_id":"toi","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Scotland vs New Zealand, 1st T20I, New Zealand tour of Scotland, 2022 - Cricbuzz","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbS5jcmljYnV6ei5jb20vbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3Jlcy80NjU1NS9uei12cy1zY28tMXN0LXQyMGktbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtdG91ci1vZi1zY290bGFuZC0yMDIy0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Scotland vs New Zealand, 1st T20I, New Zealand tour of Scotland, 2022  CricbuzzSCO vs NZ Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- New Zealand Tour of Scotland, 1st T20I  Cricket AddictorSCO vs NZ LIVE Score: NZ cruising with Allen in good touch, Scotland vs NewZealand 1st T20 LIVE  InsideSportScotland vs New Zealand Live Streaming: When and Where to Watch First T20I, Coverage on TV and Online  News18SCO vs NZ Match Prediction, 1st T20I – Who will win today’s match between Scotland and New Zealand?  CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-27 13:31:45","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"}]}
