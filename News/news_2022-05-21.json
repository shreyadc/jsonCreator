Rajasthan Royals spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has disclosed that he was informed about the team management‚Äôs batting expectations from him before the start of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League. Rajasthan, who have played with a batter short on multiple occasions this season, haven‚Äôt hesitated from promoting Ashwin up the order to add depth to their batting. In return, Ashwin has responded to the additional responsibility by retiring out , scoring a maiden T20 half-century against Delhi Capitals and playing a match-winning knock against Chennai Super Kings tonight. ‚ÄúIt was a special day for us. Finishing with a win and getting two bites of the cherry was important. The communication was clear before the season on what I needed to work on. The management had ensured my role was well-defined, I opened [in] practice games. I was told I‚Äôll play in the powerplay but not at the death [laughs],‚Äù Ashwin told Star Sports at the toss. Ashwin, who broke an all-important 83-run second-wicket partnership by dismissing Devon Conway in the first innings, gave away only 28 runs in his four-over spell at the Brabourne Stadium on Friday. However, it was his performance with the bat in hand which earned him his fourth match award in the IPL. Coming in to bat at No. 5 with his team needing 75 runs off 52 balls to win the match, Ashwin scored a match-winning 40* (23) with the help of two fours and three sixes.

Having sealed a chase, a jubilant Ashwin was seen replicating Delhi batter David Warner‚Äôs jump celebration. ‚ÄúI have understood the game well and am innovative.

Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson believes that his team deserves its second spot on Indian Premier League 2022 points table. Having defeated defending champions Chennai Super Kings by 5 wickets in their final league match tonight, Royals have ended the league stage with nine wins and five losses. ‚ÄúThe way we‚Äôve played throughout the league stage stands out. We‚Äôve had great games where almost everyone has stood up to win games. We deserve to be in this position is what I feel,‚Äù Samson told Star Sports during the post-match presentation ceremony. Losing the toss and bowling first at the Brabourne Stadium tonight, Samson saw his bowlers getting hit left, right and centre as Super Kings all-rounder Moeen Ali registered a 19-ball half-century . However, it was commendable on the part of Royals‚Äô bowlers to restrict the opposition to 150/6 in spite of leaking 83 runs in the first seven overs. Picking three wickets in as many overs after the powerplay being the key, Samson managed his troops quite well to not let CSK gain momentum again. ‚ÄúIt was important to understand that the wicket was good and they just kept going. It‚Äôs hard to stop someone like Moeen Ali. It was okay to go for runs. We knew we could believe in our bowlers to come back stronger, we came back stronger than expected to give just 75 after the powerplay,‚Äù Samson said. Much like Chennai, Rajasthan also lost crucial wickets in the middle overs to dent their progress in a 151-run chase. While they had qualified for the playoffs in the first over of the chase itself, a victory was mandatory for their Top Two finish. Promoted in the batting order yet again, spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took the opportunity with both hands to end up with a match-winning 40* (23) comprising of two fours and three sixes. Ashwin, whose 183 runs in 10 IPL 2022 innings have come at a strike rate of 146.40, played a titular role in RR sealing a chase in the last over at the Cricket Club of India on Friday.

[Ravichandran] Ashwin has done a great job and has turned out to be a great all-rounder for us. He batted a lot in the nets before the season. We were expecting something special from him [in the batting],‚Äù Samson said of Ashwin‚Äôs batting.","pubDate":"2022-05-20 19:49:49","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Next coach must push us, says Lanning","link":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/next-coach-must-push-us-says-lanning-c-6879529","keywords":null,"creator":["Roger Vaughan"],"video_url":null,"description":"Australian cricket captain Meg Lanning says outgoing coach Matthew Mott will be missed and his replacement must make sure they continue to improve.","content":"The Australia women's cricket team will have lofty expectations of their new coach, with captain Meg Lanning saying they must not rest on their many laurels. While Australia will send the same squad of 15 to the Commonwealth Games as the combination that won the World Cup last month, coach Matthew Mott's resignation means they are now in a period of change. Mott will coach the English men's one-day program after a seven-year period where he oversaw the transformation of the women into one of Australia's all-time great sporting teams. Apart from winning the 50-over World Cup for the seventh time, they also hold the Ashes and are the reigning T20 world champions. Lanning's team will go into the Birmingham Games as the overwhelming favourites. Shelley Nitschke will be the interim head coach for the Games, and a warm-up tri-series against Pakistan and Ireland in Northern Ireland. Ben Sawyer will continue as assistant coach. They are the two obvious candidates to take over as permanent head coach, with the decision to be made after Birmingham. Whoever it is, Lanning made it clear they must find ways to make a great team even better. \"He got us to a point where we are leading the way,\" Lanning said of Mott. \"The real challenge for our group now is trying to say there as best we can, for as long as we can. \"For the new coach coming in, it's about challenging us, making sure we're improving and evolving. \"That's probably the biggest challenge for us, making sure we're not standing still and getting better all the time - if we don't do that, we certainly won't be the best team in the world.\" Lanning added that Mott was a great manager of people who had a massive impact on her. \"It hasn't all been easy, it hasn't all been success along the way,\" she said. \"We've had our challenges and that's what makes it extra special, particularly that last World Cup win. \"We had to fight through a fair bit to be able to that point. \"He's been a massive impact on the team, but myself individually, he's really good at challenging you, but also giving you a lot of confidence as well. He's a huge loss, it certainly will be very different without him.\" Lanning said having Nitschke as interim coach would give the team continuity going into the Games. She also endorsed either Nitschke or Sawyer as the next permanent head coach. \"It's a good question - Shell and Ben would be great at the job,\" she said. \"The first part is to go to the Commonwealth Games and play and perform well there, with Shelley in charge. \"Then I guess they'll go through the process from there. \"From a players' perspective, all I'm concerned about is how we can play well over in Birmingham and the tri series as well - the process will take of itself.\"","pubDate":"2022-05-20 18:13:15","image_url":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-6879529/46293f54d1875dc632c0a3ab4f8accae4f0c8906-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg","source_id":"perthnow","country":["australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022, RR vs CSK Highlights: Ravichandran Ashwin, Yashasvi Jaiswal Star As RR Beat CSK To Qualify For Playoffs - NDTV Sports","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3Nwb3J0cy5uZHR2LmNvbS9pcGwtMjAyMi9saXZlLWlwbC1zY29yZS1yci12cy1jc2stbGl2ZS1jcmlja2V0LXNjb3JlLXJhamFzdGhhbi1yb3lhbHMtdnMtY2hlbm5haS1zdXBlci1raW5ncy1saXZlLXNjb3JlYm9hcmQtYW5kLXVwZGF0ZXMtMjk5NDI1MtIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022, RR vs CSK Highlights: Ravichandran Ashwin, Yashasvi Jaiswal Star As RR Beat CSK To Qualify For Playoffs¬†¬†NDTV SportsLive Cricket Score - RR vs CSK, Match 68, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzRR vs CSK Dream11 Prediction Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Super Kings vs Royals, Indian Premier League 2022, 68th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoHighlights, RR vs CSK IPL 2022: Rajasthan Royals Finish Second After Beating Chennai Super Kings by 5 Wickets¬†¬†News18View Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-20 17:48:08","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 RR vs CSK Live Score Updates: Rajasthan win, secure a spot in the qualifiers - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLXJyLXZzLWNzay1saXZlLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMtNzkyNzU4Mi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 RR vs CSK Live Score Updates: Rajasthan win, secure a spot in the qualifiers¬†¬†The Indian ExpressRR vs CSK Dream11 Prediction Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Super Kings vs Royals, Indian Premier League 2022, 68th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoLive Cricket Score - RR vs CSK, Match 68, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - Cricbuzz¬†¬†CricbuzzRR vs CSK Live Score, IPL 2022: Rajasthan lose quick wickets but Ashwin, Parag keep hopes alive¬†¬†Times of IndiaView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-20 17:42:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022: Have full confidence in my players, says Ponting ahead of DC's crucial clash with MI","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-have-full-confidence-in-my-players-says-ponting-ahead-of-dcs-crucial-clash-with-mi-743971","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"DC are fifth in the IPL 2022 table with 14 pointsDC take on MI in their final league game on SaturdayIn their previous meeting, DC won by 4 wickets","content":"Ricky Ponting Delhi Capitals (DC) head coach Ricky Ponting has backed his side to do well against Mumbai Indians (MI) on Saturday, which is their last league game of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022. Even though Rishabh Pant and Co have had a roller coaster ride in the IPL 2022, they can still make it to the playoffs. DC are currently in fifth place in the league table with 14 points from 13 games. A win would put them level on points with fourth-placed Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) but a superior net run rate means, DC would bag the final playoffs spot ahead of Faf du Plessis and Co. \"I have got full confidence in the players that they will have a really good game on Saturday. We strung back-to-back wins together for the first time (after Delhi's previous match against Punjab) in the season. It's been an up and down season for us, but we've played some good cricket. I always talk about playing our best cricket at the business end of the tournament and peaking at the right time. I've got a feeling that the boys are about to do that,\" Ponting said. Ponting also heaped praise on DC's David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Kuldeep Yadav, and Shardul Thakur for delivering in their respective roles in the hour of need. Opening batsman Warner is DC's leading run-scorer this season with 427 runs at an average of 53.37, including five half-centuries. The Australian has scored at an impressive strike rate of 151.96 in the 11 games he has featured in so far. IPL 2022: We need more experienced players to step up, says Ponting Meanwhile, chinaman bowler Kuldeep is DC's top wicket-taker with 20 scalps to his name at an economy of 8.45. In the Purple Cap race in the IPL 2022, Kuldeep is fifth in the list. While Marsh and Thakur also have produced a few match-winning performances in the last few games, Ponting believes all the experienced players of DC need to step up against five-time champions MI. \"Davey (Warner) has done a really good job at the top of the order. We have also seen how destructive Mitchell Marsh can be at the number three slot. And among the bowlers, Kuldeep (Yadav) has been exceptional and Axar (Patel) has been bowling economically as well. Shardul has shown good form in recent matches. There are some good signs as far as our senior players are concerned and going into big games, you need your more experienced players to step up. \"As a coaching group, we'll look to get the players well prepared for their next challenge and it's certainly a challenge that we are looking forward to. I am very excited about what Saturday holds for us and hopefully, we've got another week of cricket to play after that,\" added Ponting.

The decent grass cover has meant that the red soil surface tiredness match after match has been minimized to the fullest, and the batters have not struggled that much due to the slowness of the wicket.

That sense of mateship and friendship was everything that Roy built his whole life around ‚Äì trust and loyalty. Here we are a few days later after him relaying that story to me and he‚Äôs disappeared. He was loyal to a fault, he really was,‚Äù Gilchrist added. However, the reunion was not meant to be as both Shane Warne and Andrew Symonds passed away. The first season of the Hundred was a hit, but London Spirit finished at the last spot. Ahead of the 2022 season, London Spirit retained Eoin Morgan, Glenn Maxwell, Zak Crawley, Mark Wood, Mason Crane, Dan Lawrence, Adam Rossington, Ravi Bopara, Blake Cullen, and Brad Wheal.

The 36-year-old from Delhi has had another consistent run in the IPL, scoring 421 runs for Punjab Kings with one game remaining. The last time the stylish opener scored less than 300 runs in the competition was back in 2015, highlighting his consistency. However, despite being among the runs and leading India on tour of Sri Lanka last year, Dhawan did not find a place in the last T20 World Cup squad. The competition for spots is only getting intense in the Indian team but Dhawan is expected to make a T20 comeback with the home series against South Africa beginning June 9. He believes his experience can come in handy in the T20 set-up. \"Though I remain an integral part of the team, I still feel that I can contribute in the shortest format because of my experience. I have been quite doing well in the T20 format. Whatever role I have been given I have done well. \"I have managed to stay consistent in the formats that I am playing, whether it is the IPL or at the domestic level and I am enjoying it. Consistency is not only about scoring fifties or hundreds frequently, but also about maintaining even gaps between such scores,\" Dhawan told PTI. A couple of months after leading India in Sri Lanka, Dhawan missed out on the World Cup. He was obviously disappointed but his positive outlook to life helped him move on from that. \"Yes I am a very positive person. It was a dream come true for me leading the team last year. For the T20 World Cup, they thought the (chosen) players were better than me and fair enough. Whatever decision selectors make, I respect that. That happens in life. You accept it and keep doing your job. I only focus on what is in my control and try to make the most of the opportunities that I get,\" he said. 'Definitely playing for at least another three years' Having played 34 Tests, 149 ODIs and 68 T20s for India since his debut in 2010, Dhawan wants to carry on for at least three years. \"I don't put unnecessary pressure on myself. It's a race that never ends. If I get into that mindset, I will not be happy and it's not good energy. My ODI average is 45.53. I am always looking for growth, analysing if I can get better. We as cricketers have to remain on our toes and fit to be relevant in the race to represent India. I am playing for the next three years at least. I have been batting quite well for the past few years, I am hopeful and positive that the way I am performing, there are many milestones to achieve,\" Dhawan said. \"My focus is about the journey and not the destination, it is more about how I am refining myself as a cricketer and how consistently am I performing and as a leader, how am I growing,\" he said on a philosophical note.\" With the role of power-hitting only increasing in the shortest format, Dhawan realises that constant upskilling is \"truly\" the need of the hour. \"Everyone has to be open to change if that's what is needed. I can adapt myself to any situation, I do that job on the day and in the moment, the situation may not be the same for whole season, it keeps changing. I have the presence of mind to know when to do what,\" he said. On Punjab's run in IPL Promoted Punjab were knocked out of the IPL on Thursday after Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Gujarat Titans. It was another season of missed opportunities for Punjab. \"I would have loved to win more matches for the team and sometimes I felt that we performed well as a batting unit and sometimes as a bowling unit, but should have been more consistent. If we had done that, we could have been in a much better position,\" said Dhawan on his maiden season with the franchise.","pubDate":"2022-05-20 15:11:13","image_url":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-05/6eoi3e5g_shikhar-dhawan-afp_625x300_20_May_22.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=240,height=180","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals vs Chennai Super Kings Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/rajasthan-royals-vs-chennai-super-kings-live-score-over-match-68-t20-6-10-updates-2994661","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Rajasthan Royals vs Chennai Super Kings from Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai.

Good pace from McCoy, just angling it across the right-hander. Rayudu looks to drive but misses. Ambati Rayudu is the next man in. 8.4 overs (0 Run) OUT! CAUGHT! Dot balls create pressure and Narayan Jagadeesan has crumbled under it. It's the off-cutter from Obed McCoy, fuller and around off. Jagadeesan looks to step out and go over mid off but gets undone by the lack of pace. Jagadeesan ends up chipping it to the left of Riyan Parag at mid off and he takes a dolly of a catch. McCoy strikes in his first over and Rajasthan pulling things back here. 8.3 overs (0 Run) Length this time, around leg stump and the pace is taken off.

LBW! Ravichandran Ashwin has struck and the partnership is finally broken. This is angled in fuller and on leg stump, Conway gets low to sweep but misses and gets rapped on the pads. Ashwin appeals and the finger is raised. Devon Conway does go for the DRS. The third umpire checks and confirms with Ultra Edge that there's no bat on it. Ball Tracking shows that the impact is in line and wickets are umpire's call. He has to depart and Rajasthan have some respite. 7.2 overs (0 Run) Around middle, Conway reverse-sweeps it straight to the man at short third man. 7.1 overs (1 Run) Quicker, at 103.8 kph and speared into middle and leg.

Ali pats it towards backward point and rotates the strike. 6.1 overs (1 Run) Chahal starts with a length ball, on middle and turning in. Conway tucks it away behind square on the leg side for a quick single. DRINKS! Catch your breath, folks! This has been an absolute masterclass from Moeen Ali! Boult got an early wicket of Gaikwad and with two quiet overs initially, it seemed that Powerplay will belong to Rajasthan. However, first Conway and then Moeen Ali started absolutely smashing it all around the park and at the end of the Powerplay, Chennai are going at over 12 an over. Rajasthan need wickets here and need to break this partnership urgently and here is Yuzvendra Chahal with the ball. Can he provide the breakthrough? 5.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Would you believe it? Six boundaries in six balls including a maximum! This is overpitched around off, Moeen Ali with a glorious cover drive through extra cover and that makes it 26 runs in the over. Chennai absolutely flying at the moment. 5.5 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Make that 22 in the over! Boult goes wider and Ali just drives it through the point region for a fifth boundary in the over. 5.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! FIFTY for Moeen Ali and the boundaries just don't seem to be stopping at the moment. Short and outside off, Ali with a smart shot over short third man and he makes it 18 in the over with 2 balls still left. What a blistering knock this has been so far from the southpaw! 5.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! The call is for two but it races away. Off-cutter from Boult on middle stump and Ali works it through mid-wicket for yet another boundary. 5.2 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Carnage, absolute carnage! Just a bit too straight from Boult, full and on the pads. Ali with an aerial flick in front of square on the leg side for a boundary. 5.1 overs (6 Runs) SIX! WOW! Moeen Ali is in the zone right now! Boult angles it onto the pads and Ali just dispatches it nonchalantly over the square leg fence.","pubDate":"2022-05-20 14:35:44","image_url":"https://edata.ndtv.com/twittergft/sport_automated_story/240.full_637886739360944131.png","source_id":"ndtv","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"MSD last match: Is today Dhoni last match in IPL?","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-msd-last-match-is-today-dhoni-last-match-in-ipl/","keywords":["Cricket","CSK","IPL 2022","Rajasthan Royals","chennai super kings","csk","Indian Premier League","MS Dhoni","rajasthan royals","RR"],"creator":["Dixit Bhargav"],"video_url":null,"description":"MSD last match: The legendary Indian captain is playing his last Indian Premier League 2022 match at the Brabourne Stadium tonight.

During the 68th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings at the Brabourne Stadium, Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has won the toss and chose to bat. Dhoni, who talked about giving some time to his batters at the Cricket Club of India tonight, hasn‚Äôt made a lot of changes to the Playing XI as the defending champions look to finish a dull season on a winning note. Dhoni, who doesn‚Äôt play competitive cricket apart from the IPL post his international retirement, is their sixth-highest run-scorer this season with his 206 runs coming at an average and strike rate of 34.33 and 128.75 respectively. IPL 2022 will also be remembered for Dhoni stepping down as captain before the season only to resume his leadership role after his successor Ravindra Jadeja relinquished captaincy midway through the season. Is today MSD last match in IPL? It is worth mentioning that this isn‚Äôt Dhoni‚Äôs last IPL match by any means. While Dhoni hadn‚Äôt made any such announcement in the build-up to this match, it was expected of him to continue playing in the IPL next seasons as well. Dhoni, 40, confirmed the same at toss repeating his previous stance of wanting to play in front of their home spectators at the MA Chidambaram Stadium before playing his last IPL match for CSK.

It is certainly the former captain Virat Kohli . The RCB batter has shown his love for the wrestling event many a times in a cricket match. Remember when he screamed: \"Finally The Rock has come back\", during the India vs South Africa Test recently when ace pacer in Indian lineup Jasprit Bumrah brought back his form and got wickets for the team. Kohli was once again at his funny best during the RCB vs Gujarat Titans match in IPL on May 19 (Thursday) when he did one of the epic The Undertaker moves, while taking a dig at GT opener Shubman Gill. Kohli pulled off the The Undertaker's inconic 'throat-slash' sign while looking at Shubman Gill. That was some sort of statement by Kohli to the young Gujarat Titans batter, but all in a fun way. Kohli is known to be a big prankster in the team who does not really behave like a senior in the team and shares a friendly bond with even the juniors. That was one such instance. Watch the move here: pic.twitter.com/dqDst3IXlC ‚Äî ChaiBiscuit (@Biscuit8Chai) May 20, 2022 Not to forget, in the same match, Kohli stormed back to his best , blasting 73 off 54 balls that included 8 fours ad 2 sixes respectively. This was a Kohli that the fans were missing. It is also a co-incidence that he has scored two fifties in IPL 2022 so far and both these knocks have come against the Titans. The last fifty, however, was scratchy and did not have the same effect as the last knock had. Kohli's coming back to form is also a good news for India as they will prepare for the T20 World Cup 2022 to be held in Australia later this year. If Kohli is among runs, India's chances will brighten up in the Australian conditions, where he has enough experience of playing.","pubDate":"2022-05-20 10:48:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RR vs CSK Dream11 IPL 2022: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Probable Playing XI for RR vs CSK","link":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/ipl-2022-rr-vs-csk-dream-11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-playing-xi-pitch-report-injury-updates-2022-05-20-778012","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RR vs CSK Dream11 IPL 2022: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream 11, Probable Playing XI for Rajasthan Royals vs Chennai Super Kings Match Details Rajasthan Royals vs Chennai Super Kings","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-20 10:21:04","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Shoaib Akhtar hits back at Virender Sehwag over controversial 'chucking' remark - Hindustan Times","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pZi12aXJlbmRlci1zZWh3YWcta25vd3MtbW9yZS10aGFuLWljYy1oZS1pcy1lbnRpdGxlZC10by1oaXMtb3Bpbmlvbi1zaG9haWItYWtodGFyLWhpdHMtYmFjay1hdC1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWNodWNraW5nLXJlbWFyay0xMDE2NTMwMzg2MDQ2NDQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Shoaib Akhtar hits back at Virender Sehwag over controversial 'chucking' remark¬†¬†Hindustan TimesCricketers must ensure harmony between India and Pakistan: Akhtar slams Sehwag over 'chucking' comments¬†¬†Times Now\"If he knows more than the ICC, then I would agree with him\" - Shoaib Akhtar responds to Virender Sehwag's 'chucking' comments¬†¬†SportskeedaShoaib Akhtar's Take On Virender Sehwag's 'Chucking' Statement¬†¬†Cricket Addictor`Cricketers must ensure harmony between India-Pakistan` - Akhtar on Sehwag`s `chucking` allegations¬†¬†WIONView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-20 09:58:46","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ravi Shastri enters nightclub to party in funky clothes, Netizens ask 'Ranveer Singh ki biopic kar rahe ho?'","link":"https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/ravi-shastri-enters-nightclub-to-party-in-funky-clothes-netizens-ask-ranveer-singh-ki-biopic-kar-rahe-ho-2465497.html","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Indian men's cricket team head coach Ravi Shastri posted three pictures of him dancing and enjoying his time in a nightclub in Mumbai and Twitter lost its calm, check funny reactions","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-20 09:56:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"zeenews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Cricket-New Zealand trio test positive for COVID-19 ahead of warm-up game Sussex","link":"https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/cricket/2022/05/20/cricket-new-zealand-trio-test-positive-for-covid-19-ahead-of-warm-up-game-sussex","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"(Reuters) - New Zealand pair Henry Nicholls and Blair Tickner and bowling coach Shane Jurgensen have tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of their warm-up match against county side Sussex, the country's cricket board (NZC) said.

And the former Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) skipper was finally back among the runs as Kohli slammed a match-winning half-century to keep his team in contention for a play-offs berth. It was Kohli of the old. Driving down the ground, running hard between the wickets as one of the modern-day greats produced an innings of substance to bring cheer among his millions of fans. Kohli needed the rub of the green go his way and RCB Director of Cricket Mike Hesson revealed how Kohli's hard work has finally paid off. \"The fact that he (Virat) was working so hard in the nets and trying to find rhythm away from the playing games, away from the contest, allowed him to keep that confidence up,\" Hesson said. Kohli not scoring runs wasn't a big worry but the manner in which he was getting dismissed was a metter of concern. And Hesson did admit that Kohli was indeed facing the pressure. \"But no doubt when you go through a patch like that - he is only human, you know then you do start to just having doubts and wonder when your luck is going to turn. So look, a little bit of luck tonight but he's certainly earned it throughout this ,\" Hesson said. Although RCB's chances of progressing ahead depends on other permutations and combinations, Hesson was delighted by Kohli's knock. \"Look, I am absolutely delighted. Just shows like, (in) any team if you get the top-order firing and (have) a player like Virat, then it makes the rest of the chase a lot easier. \"And obviously chasing scores here has not been our forte so far in this IPL. We have been able to defend scores, but haven't been able to chase,\" Hesson said. The former New Zealand coach credited Kohli for setting up the tone. \"We know Virat is the chase-master and he set the tone again today. It was a crucial game for us and the big players stood up. We know when Virat is in that frame of mind, good luck (to the opposition), because he can take the game away from anyone,\" he said.","pubDate":"2022-05-20 09:47:36","image_url":null,"source_id":"indiatvnews","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RR vs CSK Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022 - Cricket Addictor","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL2NyaWNrZXRhZGRpY3Rvci5jb20vZmFudGFzeS1jcmlja2V0L3JyLXZzLWNzay1kcmVhbTExLXByZWRpY3Rpb24tZmFudGFzeS1jcmlja2V0LXRpcHMtZHJlYW0xMS10ZWFtLXBsYXlpbmcteGktcGl0Y2gtcmVwb3J0LWluanVyeS11cGRhdGUtdGF0YS1pcGwtMjAyMi_SAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"RR vs CSK Dream11 Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorMatch Preview - Royals vs Super Kings, Indian Premier League 2022, 68th Match¬†¬†ESPNcricinfoRR vs CSK IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score: Rajasthan Set Sight on Playoff Berth but Chennai Eye Winning End to Season¬†¬†News18RR vs CSK Dream11 Prediction Fantasy Cricket Tips, Dream11 Team, Playing XI, Pitch Report, Injury Update- Tata IPL 2022¬†¬†Cricket AddictorRAJ vs CHE 11Wickets Prediction, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Playing 11, Pitch Report and Injury Update for Match 68 of Indian T20 League¬†¬†CricTrackerView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-20 09:43:06","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"ENG vs NZ: 3 New Zealand members test covid positive ahead of 1st warm-up game","link":"https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/eng-vs-nz-3-new-zealand-members-test-covid-positive-ahead-of-1st-warm-up-game-743929","keywords":["Sports,Cricket"],"creator":["Ishka"],"video_url":null,"description":"New Zealand and England are scheduled to play 3 Tests in JuneThe first warm-up game is set to begin today (May 20)It is going to be played at County Ground in Brighton","content":"ENG vs NZ: 3 New Zealand members test covid positive ahead of 1st warm-up game As many as three members of the New Zealand camp have tested positive for covid-19 in the UK.
