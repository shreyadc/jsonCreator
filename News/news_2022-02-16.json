Aryan Club have had an underwhelming campaign so far. With two wins and four losses, they are languishing at the bottom of the points table; they have just four points in their kitty. Meanwhile, East Bengal Club are the table-toppers with four wins and two losses. They have a net run rate of +0.450, and are the favourites to win this contest.

Match: ARC-W vs EBC-W, Bengal Women’s T20 Blast, Match 20. Date and Time: 16 February, 2022; 1:00 PM IST. Venue: Bengal Cricket Academy Ground, Kalyani. It has been difficult to score runs on this track. Batters will need to be patient and drop their anchor before taking on the bowlers. They will also need to time their strokes well. A score of 120 is expected to be par. H Basu could prove to be a decent wicketkeeper choice for your Dream11 Fantasy team. She has scored runs consistently, and will look for a big knock here. V Vanitha is a decent player who can take on the opposition bowlers at any stage of the game. She has scored 57 runs in the competition so far. J Khatun is a fabulous all-rounder who has been at the top of her game in recent matches. She has scored 86 runs, and has also scalped nine wickets in the tournament. Khatun could be an excellent multiplier choice for your ARC-W vs EBC-W Dream11 Fantasy team. Meanwhile, B Susanta Majhi is another player you must have in your Dream11 Fantasy team. She has scored 116 runs, and has also picked up six wickets thus far in the competition. S Aich has bowled brilliantly, and has consistently hit the right areas. She has picked up nine wickets, and will be expected to add a few more in this game. J Khatun (ARC-W) – 438 points B Majhi (EBC-W) – 392 points S Aich (EBC-W) – 343 points R Dhar (EBC-W) – 298 points P Rana (ARC-W) – 230 points J Khatun: 86 runs and 9 wickets B Majhi: 116 runs and 6 wickets S Aich: 9 wickets R Dhar: 107 runs and 2 wickets P Rana: 95 runs and 1 wicket Fantasy Suggestion #1: H Niladri Basu, V Vanitha, J Roy, S Mondal, J Khatun, B Susanta Majhi, R Dhar, P Rana, S Aich, D Samanta, K Sutradhar Captain: J Khatun.

A third wave of COVID-19 had threatened the premier domestic event for the second year in a row but the drop in infections has allowed the BCCI to conduct the 38-team event, a massive logistical task in the new normal of bio-secure environments. All eyes will be on the opening fixture between defending champions Saurashtra and record 41-time champions Mumbai here with Rahane and Pujara on either side, aiming to make the big scores that have deserted them at the Test level for a while. Both veterans have been working hard in the nets and their coaches feel a big knock is around the corner. Rahane and Pujara will need to make instant impact with the Test squad of Sri Lanka series expected to be announced soon. Nine bio-bubbles have been created across nine venues in the country and the players had to quarantine for five days, leaving them only two days of training for the first round beginning on Thursday. The players, however, are in no mood to complain. They are just happy that they are finally getting to test themselves in the toughest form of the game after two seasons of white-ball cricket. The batters had almost forgotten the art of leaving the ball and bowlers the relentlessness of long spells. Both the departments are up for the challenge but their bodies might take longer to get used to the hard grind of red-ball cricket. “It is great that red ball cricket is starting. Players have suffered and lost a lot in the last two years both financially and skill-wise. They all are looking forward to the challenge,” said Delhi coach Raj Kumar Sharma after the team’s first training session on Monday, echoing the views of all teams. It is also set to be the shortest first-class season for most teams with sides only getting three league games, impacting their match fees and leaving them with little room for error. Eight groups of four teams each have been formed at the elite level while six teams will fight it out in the plate group. The knockouts, barring the sole pre-quarterfinal, will be held in the post IPL phase starting May 30.

New Zealand and South Africa will resume their Test rivalry after a month short of half-a-decade with the first of the two-match series beginning from tomorrow in Christchurch. The gap is enough for these two teams to entice lovers of Test cricket to follow this series from across the globe. Defending champions in the ICC World Test Championship, New Zealand will be without the services of captain and best batter Kane Williamson. South Africa, on the other hand, will miss batter Keegan Petersen, who was declared the Man of the Series in their series victory against India last month. Barring their regular No. 3 batters, recently retired wicket-keeper batters and New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult (paternity leave), both the otherwise full-strength squads should be able to put on display a fascinating Test series at the Hagley Oval.

Shane Warne is arguably one of the greatest players to ever play the game. He was the first bowler in the world to claim 700 test wickets. He ended his career with 708 test wickets, whereas he has 293 ODI wickets under his belt. Warne also bowled the “Ball of the Century” in the 1993 Ashes. Apart from his on-field records, Warne has had a lot of controversies throughout his career. He failed the drug test ahead of the 2003 World Cup. Warne even passed on the critical information to a bookmaker about the game. He has also been in a rift with Muttiah Muralitharan, Arjuna Ranatunga and Steve Waugh. Despite all the off-field controversies, Warne is hugely admired in the cricketing circuit. Shane Warne calls Ricky Ponting “Jealous” Ahead of the Ashes 2013, Michael Clarke was leading Australia to stop England in their pursuit of 4th straight Ashes. However, the off-field controversy attracted all the limelight. In his autobiography ‘At The Close of Play’, Ricky Ponting was critical of Michael Clarke’s attitude and approach when he was vice-captain. Shane Warne is a close friend of Michael Clarke, and he called Ricky Ponting “jealous” of Clarke. “To bring up the stuff about Pup (Clarke) – maybe there was a bit of jealousy, because Pup was batting so well and Ricky was not making any runs,” Warner said. “To me, Michael’s very well respected. The best captains keep stuff in the dressing room. No-one ever finds out about it. That’s what good leaders are about. So to hear all this in a book is pretty ordinary.” Michael Clarke and Shane Warne inspecting the Edgbaston pitch #Ashes pic.twitter.com/NE1zz03O0u — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) July 29, 2015 Australia A batsmen Alex Doolan, who barely even knows Clarke, was also asked about the Ponting-Clarke incident. “I’m not up to that chapter in Ricky’s book yet, so maybe when I get there I’ll be able to comment a little more,” Doolan said diplomatically.

Agar was brilliant in the BBL 11 for Perth Scorchers will both bat and the ball. “With the bat, we probably haven’t seen the best of him yet in international cricket,” Glenn Maxwell said after the game. Ashton Agar, who played his last test in 2017, has been selected for the upcoming Pakistan tour. Looking at the conditions, he is in the frame to start the games as well. Agar and Mitchell Swepson are the favourite candidates to partner with Nathan Lyon in test games. Ashton Agar draws confidence from Loyle Carner Ashton Agar has admitted that he had self-doubts over him when he used to play earlier. Although, he got his mojo back while listening to London rapper Loyle Carner at a concert in Perth. “He was owning the stage and it was beautiful. I thought, ‘This is so cool, he just has such great presence,’ and we’re all there to watch him,” Agar told reporters. “I was thinking to myself ‘Oh god, I’d love to do that’. But at that moment I kind of realised I actually have the chance to do this all the time – every time I get to play cricket.” “So I guess approaching games like that. It’s easier said than done, (but) it’s something you need to practice – being brave and just going for it, and being open to what might happen.” This was EIGHT years ago today!

Maxwell is already a superstar in India thanks to his IPL heroics but the fact he is marrying an Indian woman has created huge excitement among the Tamil community. The wedding invite was shared on social media by Indian actor Kasturi Shankar and Maxwell admitted their big day would be a little more stressful now the Tamil-speaking world knew times and venue details in Melbourne. “I had a bit of a worrying day the other day,” Maxwell told Fox Cricket during Australia’s T20 win over Sri Lanka on Tuesday night. “I got sent a photo from one of my former IPL teammates who I hadn’t seen in a couple of years and he had been sent the Tamil wedding invite by a numerous amount of people. “So unfortunately that was making the rounds online. I think we’re going to have to increase security at our Hindu wedding. Glenn Maxwell’s wedding invitation was leaked online. (Photo by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images “Check online. It’s everywhere. Look up Maxwell wedding, it’ll be somewhere.” Maxwell explained the wedding was a week-long affair that would begin on a Monday and go until the following Sunday. “There’s three events during the week including two the week before,” he said. “It’s a bit of a festival for my wedding this year.” Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee, who has starred in Bollywood movies and is well known in India, said Maxwell’s wedding would go as long as a “Test match”. Settling on a date for the wedding has been a headache for Maxwell, who thought he had found a gap in his jam-packed cricketing schedule in March. There might be a few blow-ins at Maxwell’s wedding.

His name came up in the final stage of the auction on Sunday, and he was snapped up by KKR. ‘500 a day’ He recalls the time he travelled for tennis-ball tournaments, making Rs 500-1000 a day. “You must have seen my videos (on YouTube) paaji. I am basically a tennis-ball player. Since I could turn the ball away and turn back in, people advised me to play with a leather ball. They would say ‘you might make it big’,” he says. “But I didn’t have the support that I needed to pursue the game professionally. I used to play the odd leather-ball game but mainly it was all tennis-ball cricket.” “I used to bowl with a Cosco ball (used in tennis), which is very light. The leather ball is much heavier and it is harder to make it turn but I am slowly getting better. I am sure the IPL stint will help my game in a big way,” he adds. “It started with me playing all across Punjab. When I performed I got calls from other states too. Sometimes I made 500 rupees in a day, sometimes it was 1,000. It was just about enough to run the house and manage my travel expenses,” he says. Ramesh wants his parents to stop working now. “They have finally agreed to not work anymore. I never wanted them to do this work in the first place but it had to be done out of necessity,” Ramesh says. Tough life “I migrated from neighbouring Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan in search of livelihood around three decades ago,” says Manga Ram, Ramesh’s father. “I never knew luck would shine on me in such a way that my eldest son would be picked up for the IPL and bring fame to my family, which struggled to earn two square meals.” Manga Ram used to advise his son not to select cricket as his career. “I thought it was a game of affluent people,” he says. “But now he can make a career in cricket and has proved me wrong.” — With agency inputs","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/2/2022_2$largeimg_1368206134.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"99 problems: With T20 World Cup in focus, India look to fill gaps as they take on West Indies","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/99-problems-with-t20-world-cup-in-focus-india-look-to-fill-gaps-as-they-take-on-west-indies-370324","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Kolkata, February 15Flush with exciting talent and focused on the T20 World Cup in exactly eight months' time, the Rohit Sharma-led India would be aiming to get their combinations right when they take on West Indies in a three-match series beginning here tomorrow.India were the pre-tournament favourites but made a shocking group stage exit in the last World Cup held in the UAE in October-November.
