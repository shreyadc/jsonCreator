Read full story","content":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Rajasthan Royals booked a place in the Indian Premier League (IPL) final against Gujarat Titans after Jos Buttler's blistering hundred secured a seven-wicket victory versus Royal Challengers Bangalore in Friday's qualifier in Ahmedabad. After Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson won the toss and elected to field, their bowling attack laid the foundation for the comprehensive victory by restricting Bangalore to 157-8. Buttler, this season's leading IPL scorer, then smashed 106 not out off 60 balls as 2008 champions Rajasthan romped home with 11 balls to spare. Sunday's final will be a rematch of Tuesday's first qualifier in which IPL debutants Gujarat beat Rajasthan by seven wickets. Put in to bat, Bangalore could not really get going and crossed the 150-mark largely because of Rajat Patidar's breezy 58. Bangalore's batting otherwise did not click against Rajasthan's disciplined bowling spearheaded by Prasidh Krishna and Obed McCoy, who claimed three wickets apiece. Krishna dismissed Virat Kohli for seven in the second over and McCoy removed Bangalore captain Faf du Plessis (25) in the 11th to dent Bangalore's top order. Glenn Maxwell could not capitalise on the start he got either and was dismissed by Trent Boult for 24. Patidar smashed three sixes in his 42-ball cameo but Bangalore still fell well short of the 175-mark, which would have been a par score at the ground. Rajasthan's chase got off to a rollicking start with Buttler maintaining his red-hot form and raising 61 runs in five overs with opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal (21). Buttler was on 66 when Dinesh Karthik dropped him in what proved a costly mistake. Samson fell for 23 but Buttler could not be denied his fourth hundred this season and the Englishman sealed Rajasthan's victory with his sixth six.

During Qualifier 2 of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bangalore in Ahmedabad, Rajasthan Royals have played comprehensively to gain a solid advantage over the opposition. While the match is still in progress, it is highly likely of Rajasthan to beat Bangalore without any discomfort to face Gujarat Titans in the final match at the same venue on Sunday. Although in the hindsight, Royals captain Sanju Samson’s decision of electing to bowl first after winning the toss has proved to be absolutely right one. An all-round disciplined bowling performance by most of Samson’s bowlers made it a point to restrict Royal Challengers to 157/8 in 20 overs in spite of batter Rajat Patidar (58) scoring a fluent half-century. With bowling figures of 4-0-22-3, Prasidh Krishna was the pick of their bowlers and was well-accompanied by Obed McCoy, who also picked three wickets. ALSO READ: What is the meaning of Ee Sala Cup Namde? RCB, who have excelled on the back of their finishers’ skills this season, scored 34/5 in the last five overs at the Narendra Modi Stadium tonight. As a result, all RR were required to score was 158 to win the match. Led by highest run-scorer of the season in Jos Buttler, Rajasthan firmed their grip on the match primarily due to a brisk 61-run opening partnership between Yashasvi Jaiswal (21) and Buttler. Needing 55 runs in 10 overs with nine wickets in hand, there is no reason why Royals won’t be able to stage a victory on Friday.

Josh Hazlewood puts it on a fuller length around off, Jos Buttler leans into the drive and caresses it through the gap at cover-point. 1.1 overs (0 Run) Starts with a full ball, around off, Buttler covers the line and defends it to the off side. Who will bowl from the other end? It is Josh Hazlewood. One slip in place. 0.6 over (6 Runs) SIX! Dismissed! WHAT A START FOR RAJASTHAN! Mohammed Siraj once again tries to test the young man with a short ball. It's on middle and sits up nicely for the batter. Yashasvi Jaiswal rides the bounce and muscles his pull shot over mid-wicket. 16 from the opening over, Rajasthan have set a perfect tone for this chase! 0.5 over (0 Run) Fuller and on middle, angling away, Jaiswal strokes it off his front foot but finds the cover fielder. 0.4 over (4 Runs) FOUR! Excellent timing this time! Siraj serves a length ball on the pads, Yashasvi Jaiswal picks it up and flicks it delightfully in front of square on the leg side for a boundary. 0.3 over (6 Runs) SIX!

As for the iconic stadium, which has hosted 17 complete IPL matches, is spread over 63 acres, with the total area equivalent to 32 Olympic size soccer fields put together. Owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, the Narendra Modi stadium was previously known as the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel stadium, or more popularly as the Motera Cricket Stadium, until February last year. The stadium was named after the first deputy Prime Minister of India, late Vallabhbhai Patel, from 1947-1950, and was built on the banks of the Sabarmati river on the outskirts of the city of Ahmedabad. It was also named after Motera, which is a place where the stadium is located, at the west of the Sabarmati river. As per reports, the stadium’s reconstruction work began in the year 2016, after the proposal of incumbent Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi back when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, and also the President of Gujarat Cricket Association. It took mere nine months to reconstruct the stadium with all the modern facilities, and a record seating capacity of over 1,12,000 people, thereby making it the world’s largest Cricket stadium, and the second-largest sports ground in the world after the Rungrado May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea.","pubDate":"2022-05-27 15:59:50","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Bilaterals may get ‘squeezed’ with longer duration for leagues like IPL: ICC Chairman Barclay","link":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ipl-2022/bilaterals-may-get-squeezed-with-longer-duration-for-leagues-like-ipl-icc-chairman-barclay-398711","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Mumbai, May 27The bilateral contests between international teams may get \"squeezed\" if the window for T20 leagues like the IPL keep getting longer, ICC Chairman Greg Barclay said on Friday.With the addition of two teams this season, the IPL has been expanded to 74 games over a two-month window compared to 60 matches last season.Asked how one strikes a balance between the IPL and the international calendar, Barclay said, \"It is a good question.

Kohli was at the crease after Rajasthan Royals invited Bangalore to bat first when the young man ran onto the field and attempted to shake hands with the superstar cricketer. But the fan, it seemed, could only touch the glove of Kohli who reluctantly put his hand forward to avoid the intrusion after the first ball of the match. અમદાવાદ : વિરાટ કોહલીને મળવા ચાહક સુરક્ષા તોડી ગ્રાઉન્ડમાં ઘસી આવ્યો, જુઓ વિડિયો#CGNews #Ahmedabad #Viratkohli… https://t.co/gQ0CRhkiLJ — ConnectGujarat (@ConnectGujarat) 1653660835000 A group of ground officials gave chase and eventually overpowered the man in yellow t-shirt before hauling him off the field as the crowd roared and clapped. This is the second straight instance of pitch invasion in the IPL with Wednesday's eliminator in Kolkata also witnessing a man running towards Kohli in the outfield before police carried the fan away much to the amusement of the Indian star. The 33-year-old former India captain is often the subject of adulation with one fan even touching his feet before taking a selfie during an IPL game in 2018. Kohli, who has suffered three golden ducks in this season's Twenty20 tournament, hit a six off Trent Boult 's opening over but fell caught behind to Prasidh Krishna in the next over. He made seven.

During the ‘Qualifier 2’ fixture of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the Rajasthan Royals (RR) have won the Toss and elected to field first against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). Both RR and RCB have gone with an unchanged playing 11 from their previous respective fixtures. “We will bowl first. The wicket is a bit sticky and hopefully it will help our bowlers first-up. Yesterday we had a good practice session. Everyone is happy and excited for the game. Emotionally everyone is connected to the team and the franchise. Important to keep calm and cut off the noise, trust yourself and just another game of cricket. No changes for us,” remarked Sanju Samson after winning only his third Toss this IPL season. Making it through to the final four after a Mumbai Indians (MI) victory against the Delhi Capitals, the RCB accomplished a hard-fought victory against the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the ‘Eliminator’, courtesy of a match-winning maiden century by Rajat Patidar . With the stars seeming to be perfectly aligned for the Faf du Plessis-led side, the fans have yet again began cheering their side with the popular slogan – ‘Ee Sala Cup Namde’. You know the saying Menners.. ee sala cup namde 😉 — Chloe-Amanda Bailey (@ChloeAmandaB) May 21, 2022 After a forgetful IPL 2017, when the Virat Kohli-led RCB finished at the last spot in the points table, their fans took the mantle upon themselves to support their favourite franchise in their lowest phase. This is where the ‘Ee Sala Cup Namde’ cheer originated, after a section of fans came up with this slogan in the Kannada language – spoken predominantly by the people in Karnataka – the home state of the franchise. This Kannada slogan can be loosely translated to – ‘This year the cup is ours’, in the English language. Despite still having not lifted the IPL title after 14 complete seasons, the RCB fans have been trolled, mercilessly at times, by their rival fans by using this very slogan against them.","pubDate":"2022-05-27 14:50:54","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Klay Thompson is EVERYTHING to the Warriors' title chances - Stephen A. | First Take - ESPN","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9emJnb3pMSV9POFXSAQA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Klay Thompson is EVERYTHING to the Warriors' title chances - Stephen A. | First Take  ESPNWarriors as NBA ratings gold, cricket on TV and more: Sports Media Mailbag, Part I  The AthleticThe Reason Why The NBA Wants The Golden State Warriors In The Finals: \"The Difference Between A Warriors NBA Finals vs. A Non-Warriors NBA Finals But The Difference Is Millions Of Viewers.\"  Fadeaway WorldPatrick Beverley: You have to give the Warriors ownership a ton of credit for the success | Get Up  ESPNIs this Golden States' title to win? | Get Up  ESPNView Full Coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-27 14:29:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["united states of america"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Rajasthan Royals vs Royal Challengers Bangalore Live Score Ball by Ball, IPL 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/rajasthan-royals-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-live-score-over-qualifier-2-t20-1-5-updates-3015464","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Live Updates of Today Match between Rajasthan Royals vs Royal Challengers Bangalore from Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad.

Short in length and outside off, Faf du Plessis hangs on the back foot and whacks it through extra cover for a cracking boundary. 12 from the over! 4.5 overs (0 Run) Shortish and on off, shaping in, Faf is cramped for room and ends up pushing it defensively towards the bowler. 4.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! A tough chance for Samson goes begging. Back of a length, around leg, Faf du Plessis tries to glance it across the line but gloves it behind. Sanju Samson dives across to his left but it takes his fingertips and scoots behind for a boundary at fine leg. 4.3 overs (2 Runs) Boult goes fuller but the line is around leg, Faf takes a step down and wrists it through square leg for a couple of runs. 4.2 overs (1 Run) Fraction short and outside off, Patidar uses the angle of the bowler and dabs it down to third man for one. 4.1 overs (1 Run) Fuller in length and outside off, Faf du Plessis drives it square of the wicket on the off side for a run. 3.6 overs (0 Run) Slightly fuller this time, outside off, Rajat Patidar drives but finds the fielder at wide mid off. 3.5 overs (0 Run) Angling in, on a length, it's defended from the back foot to the leg side. 3.4 overs (0 Run) In the zone outside off, left alone. 3.3 overs (4 Runs) FOUR BYES! That's so unlucky for the bowler. It's a peach of a delivery. Prasidh Krishna clocks 148 kph and delivers it on a length around off. It lands and jags back in to beat the inside edge and keeps on swinging away from the diving keeper. A boundary at fine leg results. 3.2 overs (0 Run) A touch short again, outside off, Rajat Patidar plays late but finds the backward point fielder. 3.1 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Short in length and outside off, Rajat Patidar stands tall inside the crease and throws his bat at it. It takes a thick outside edge and flies over the slip cordon for a boundary. 2.6 overs (0 Run) A cracking yorker from Boult. It's swerving into the batter, around middle, Faf du Plessis does well to have his bat down in time as he digs it out safely to square leg. 2.5 overs (0 Run) Too full and around off, du Plessis drills his drive but finds the mid off fielder. 2.4 overs (4 Runs) FOUR! Poor line and length from the Kiwi on this occasion and he pays for it. Serves it full and wide outside off, Faf du Plessis gets the chance to free his arms and pumps it over covers for a boundary. 2.3 overs (0 Run) Presses forward and pushes a full ball to covers. 2.2 overs (0 Run) Another delivery on off, du Plessis stays back to defend but gets an inside edge onto the pads. It deflects to covers and Rajat Patidar comes out in search of a run. He is sent back as the fielder misses his shy at the bowler's end. 2.1 overs (0 Run) Excellent line from Trent Boult. Serves it on a length around off, gets it to bend back in a bit, Faf is caught inside the crease as he blocks. 1.6 overs (4 Runs) FOUR LEG BYES! Wrong line from Prasidh Krishna. Slips a length ball down the leg side, it beats Patidar's bat, clips his thigh pad and races away to the fine leg fence. Rajat Patidar is the new batter in. He is fresh from a sublime century and would look to play another crucial knock here. 1.5 overs (0 Run) OUT! EDGED AND GONE! That line to Kohli outside off has worked. Back of a length, around off and shaping away with some extra bounce. Virat Kohli sticks on the back foot and has a lazy waft inside the line. It takes the outside edge and Sanju Samson holds on to the catch. Kohli departs much to the disappointment of the capacity crowd. Needless to say, this is a big breakthrough for Rajasthan but they can't afford to relax as Bangalore have an in-form batting group. 1.4 overs (0 Run) Length delivery around off, angling in, Kohli defends it from the front foot. 1.3 overs (0 Run) Lands it on a good length and in the channel outside off, this one holds its line and Kohli shoulders arms. 1.2 overs (1 Run) Around leg, helped behind square leg for a single. 1.1 overs (0 Run) Prasidh Krishna goes very full and in the line of the stumps, du Plessis tries flicking but misses. He is rapped on the pads, the bowler appeals but the umpire turns it down. Two noises there, it's of the ball hitting both the pads, shows the replay. Would have missed the leg stump, anyway. Who will bowl from the other end? It is Prasidh Krishna. 0.6 over (6 Runs) SIX! Virat Kohli advances down the track and makes his intentions clear. Boult hurls across a length ball around off, Virat shimmies down the track and dismisses it in front of square on the leg side for a biggie. The crowd erupts. 0.5 over (0 Run) Angling away from the batter, outside off, Kohli taps it down to point and looks for a run but is sent back. 0.4 over (0 Run) That's the line and length. Around off, with a good seam position, the ball nips back in a shade, Kohli covers his stumps and makes a watchful leave. 0.3 over (1 Run) Serves it on a length and around leg, du Plessis eases it down to fine leg for a single. 0.2 over (1 Run) Kohli is away with a single and the crowd roars! Boult delivers it on a length around leg, Virat works it behind square leg and crosses for a run. The throw comes towards the bowler's end and deflects off Kohli's leg. He decides not to take advantage of it. Halt in play! Looks like we already have a pitch invader. 0.1 over (0 Run) The Kiwi speeds in and delivers a length ball in the channel outside off. It lands and goes on with the angle as Kohli allows it through to the keeper. We are all set for Qualifier 2! Out come the Rajasthan players and so are the openers of Bangalore - Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis. Trent Boult to start with the ball. Here we go... Faf du Plessis, the captain of Bangalore, says that he would have batted anyway as it looks like a good wicket. Feels that runs on the board in a big game are always crucial. Adds that they have rested well and turned up fresh. Mentions that it's quite big for the team to reach this stage and they are only a game away. He wants his boys to keep doing the right things. Further adds that it's an amazing ground, and it's incredible to play in front of so many people. Sanju Samson, the captain of Rajasthan, says that they want to bowl first as the pitch looks a bit sticky and hopes that it will help his bowlers. Shares that they had a good practice session and everyone is happy and chilled out. Tells that it's an unbelievable atmosphere here and everyone is excited about the game. Further says that everyone is connected to the team and they want to play good cricket and put smiles on the faces of the fans. Feels that it's important to keep calm and cut the noise from outside. Informs that they don't have any changes. Bangalore (Unchanged playing XI) - Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (C), Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik (WK), Shahbaz Ahmed, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammed Siraj. Rajasthan (Unchanged playing XI) - Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson (C/WK), Devdutt Padikkal, Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra Chahal, Obed McCoy. TOSS - Up goes the coin and it lands in the favour of Rajasthan. They have elected to BOWL first! Pitch report - Matthew Hayden is near the playing area and starts by saying that this place is amazing and over 100,000 people are expected to watch this game in the stadium. Adds that the boundaries are not as big as the ground looks but the boundary pockets are a little bit bigger. Shares that it's been too hot out there and the groundsmen have done well to prepare a pitch which is devoid of any cracks and it has an even covering of grass. The Aussie feels that it's a good one for batting and ends by informing us that the average winning score here is 175. All roads will lead to the Narendra Modi Stadium - the venue for the last two games of the season. This is the place where the endgame will begin in a short while. Considered to be the largest stadium in the world, it's going to be jam-packed and excitement will be touching the roof. Let's see how the pitch is expected to play... Bangalore received a big lifeline from Mumbai to get a backdoor entry into the playoffs, but they earned one for themselves by edging out Lucknow. They have reached this stage but are yet to hit the top gear. There is a lot more they can achieve as a batting group, and against the bowling arsenal of Rajasthan, the famed Bangalore batting will have to put its best foot forward. Kohli and du Plessis versus Boult, Maxwell and Karthik versus the spin duo of Ashwin and Chahal, Buttler versus Hazlewood - there are so many match-ups to look forward to this evening. Rajasthan have been doing great things in this edition. At the start, not many would have given them the tag of favourites, but they earned it with their consistent display. Jos Buttler has been the nucleus of their batting, but it has its advantages and disadvantages. Jos' failure often led to Rajasthan's failure, and in a team sport, this should be avoided. Their batting depth doesn't offer much confidence, and that puts extra pressure on the top order. This area will be under the scanner this evening, as picking early wickets will put Bangalore in the driver's seat. Can the Pink team avoid that situation? Here we go! After experiencing all the ups and downs of the season, going through the excitement and thrill of the league stage, facing loss and receiving favours, Rajasthan and Bangalore are standing at the cusp of booking their ticket to the finale. Plenty riding on this all-important Qualifier 2, and the change in venue will add more drama and challenges. Are you ready to witness this mega clash? We surely are, as we welcome you all for the coverage. Stay tuned for more... ...

From being just another young cricketer waiting in the wings, he has gone on to become of the talking points of Indian cricket. After making his debut in the Indian team against West Indies in February, Hooda grabbed an Indian Premier League contract with the Lucknow Super Giants for ₹5.75 crore. In the 15 matches that he featured in, Hooda went on to score 451 runs, becoming one of the anchors in the middle-order for the Lucknow outfit. Consistent performances in the tournament also helped him cement his spot for the home series against South Africa beginning next month. “It was a learning experience for sure, playing for a new team with new responsibilities. So far, this has been a good year for me and I am really looking forward to keep the momentum going. This tournament has taught me a lot,” Hooda told Sportstar on Friday. Like many of his friends, the last two months have been tiring as well as exciting for the 27-year-old. He was just another young talent for Punjab Kings till last season, but the Super Giants team management had faith in Hooda. After scoring a few half-centuries in the group stage, Hooda chipped in with a 45 in the Eliminator against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Eden Gardens on Thursday, even though his efforts were not enough to guide the team home . ‘Heartbreak’ “It was certainly a heartbreak for the team. But when we returned to the hotel, GG bhai (Gautam Gambhir) and other support staff spoke to us and we all agreed that this being the first season, not many thought we would be so consistent but we were able to do so. We were consistent throughout the tournament and even came closer to fulfilling our dreams. But we will take it as a learning and come back stronger next year,” Hooda said. In the last couple of editions of the IPL, Hooda had played under the leadership of K. L. Rahul at Punjab Kings and this time, with Rahul taking over as the captain of Super Giants, things got slightly easier for him. “I have known him (Rahul) for a long time and I know what he expects from his players and how he operates, so that certainly helped. GG bhai and Rahul have actually helped a lot in terms of approaching the matches and how to handle tricky situations,” Hooda said. “Those little things mattered a lot for me and also helped me in contributing the team…” No sugar-coating While he had worked with Rahul in the past, this was Hooda’s first encounter with mentor Gambhir. After spending more than two months with the former India player, Hooda was extremely impressed with Gambhir’s style of handling a team. “The best thing I liked about GG bhai is that he speaks his mind. For the betterment of the team, he does not shy away from saying what needs to be said. He is not someone who would sugarcoat stuff, if he saw something in you that needed to be worked on, he made it a point to tell that to the person so that he improve,” Hooda said.

GG bhai , too, did that with all of us. It was a great learning for me…” Last year, Hooda was handed a suspension by the Baroda Cricket Association after he exited the bio-bubble on the eve of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, after an alleged spat with Krunal Pandya. Hooda confined himself to his room and would hardly interact with family and friends. He thought there won’t be another chance, but with the help of Pathan brothers - Irfan and Yusuf - and his family, Hooda could bounce back. Mending fences But in this edition of the IPL, Lucknow roped in both Hooda and Krunal. “I think we both acted like matured individuals and ensured that we let go of the past. We were playing for the same team, so we had to be on the same page and both of us ensured that we had a good understanding,” Hooda said.

We had differences in the past, but this time, when I met Krunal for the first time before the tournament, we behaved normally and there was no animosity. Maybe, something had happened at the spark of the moment, but then, you have to move on and patch up. We did that and even Krunal was very courteous. It was a great thing…” With a resumption of cordial relations between the two, the Baroda Cricket Association requested Hooda to return to the Baroda team for next domestic season. But Hooda had made up his mind to not leave Rajasthan. “There have been requests from the BCA that I should return. But I am not leaving Rajasthan and will continue playing for them. In my times of crisis, Rajasthan Cricket Association stood by me (he had joined Rajasthan last year) and encouraged me to return to action and I want to serve the team. I am not the one who would forget those people who stood beside me in tough times,” Hooda said, insisting, “ Aap ye zaroor likhna, main Rajasthan se hi khelunga …(Request you to mention this in your write-up)” That’s Deepak Hooda for you.","pubDate":"2022-05-27 13:19:10","image_url":null,"source_id":"sportstar","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"TGS vs CRD Dream11 Prediction: Fantasy Cricket Tips, Today's Playing 11 and Pitch Report for Nature Isle T10 2022, Match 13","link":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/fantasy-cricket-mantra/tgs-vs-crd-dream11-prediction-fantasy-cricket-tips-today-s-playing-11-pitch-report-nature-isle-t10-2022-match-13?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","keywords":["Fantasy Cricket Mantra"],"creator":["Anjishnu Roy"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-05-27 13:16:58","image_url":"https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/05/a0e99-16536545793089-1920.jpg","source_id":"sportskeeda","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"“With Stokesy as captain, we’ve got a very strong leader”: Brendon McCullum speaks highly of England new captain Ben Stokes ahead of New Zealand Tests","link":"https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-with-stokesy-as-captain-weve-got-a-very-strong-leader-brendon-mccullum-speaks-highly-of-england-new-captain-ben-stokes-ahead-of-new-zealand-tests/","keywords":["Cricket","Ben Stokes","Brendon McCullum","ECB"],"creator":["Rishikesh Sharma"],"video_url":null,"description":"England’s new coach Brendon McCullum has praised the new English test captain Ben Stokes on his official unveiling.

England’s new red-ball coach Brendon McCullum has officially joined the England cricket team in England. The test side of England is set to undergo its transition phase under a new captain (Ben Stokes) and coach. Brendon McCullum left the coaching of coaching role of Kolkata Knight Riders to join the English team. After completing his stint in IPL 2022, he has joined the English team. McCullum reached the final of IPL 2021 with KKR, whereas he has won the Caribbean Premier League with Trinbago Knight Riders. The appointment of Brendon McCullum as the red-ball coach of the side raised a few eyebrows. This is McCullum’s first stint as an international coach and he is mainly known for his white-ball heroics. McCullum’s test record is great as well, but he played with aggressive intent in that format as well. In an interview with Sky Sports on his official unveiling, McCullum agreed that he is not a technical coach, and he will mainly work on man-management and building a good environment in the team. He is expected to take a manager’s role of the side, and the coaches will work under him. “I certainly don’t coach technically,” McCullum said to Sky Sports. “I understand the technique but for me it’s more around tactics, man management and trying to provide the right environment for the team to go out there and be the best versions of themselves.” Brendon McCullum has jokes 😂 (via @SENZBreakfast ) pic.twitter.com/yX9TBrjUuV — 7Cricket (@7Cricket) May 13, 2022 Brendon McCullum had a lot of praise for Ben Stokes as well. He called Ben Stokes a strong leader and a follow-me type leader who can work with him to manage the team environment. “With Stokesy as captain, we’ve got a very strong leader,” McCullum added. “A real follow-me type captain, and then my job will be to ensure that we’re consistent with our messaging.” The three-match Test series against New Zealand will be the first assignment for Brendon McCullum as the test coach of England. London’s Lord’s cricket stadium will host the first test from 2 June 2022.","pubDate":"2022-05-27 11:59:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"thesportsrush","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Raised the intensity for every ball that I’ve bowled: Ravichandran Ashwin on his constant evolution in cricket","link":"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/ipl-2022/story/ipl-2022-ravichandran-ashwin-on-his-constant-evolution-in-cricket-1955044-2022-05-27?utm_source=rss","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Raised the intensity for every ball that I’ve bowled: Ravi Ashwin on his constant evolution","content":"Veteran India off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has been at his peak in the Indian Premier League this season. Apart from picking up 11 wickets from 15 games, at a very good economy of 7.33 this season, Ashwin has been a revelation with the bat, bridging the gap between the top and the middle order and has scored runs at a strike-rate of 146. IPL 2022: Full Coverage Apart from scoring his maiden half-century this season, Ashwin also scored a stroke-filled 40 off just 23 balls to take Rajasthan to the top two of the league table. While Rajasthan were not able to get over the line against Gujarat in the Qualifier one, they would hope that the veterans in the squad can come clutch against Royal Challengers Bangalore who are riding high on confidence after defeating Lucknow Super Giants comprehensively in their last game. Ashwin spoke to Rajasthan Royals about his impact and evolution in the past two years and stated that he has been given a platform to express by the franchise and they were the right team for him at this point of his career. “With my cricket, you need the right people, right place, right time to be able to find expression for what you want to do. And I think the franchise and the people in this team have given me that cushion and freedom to where I can take off and push off and try and aim and reach for the sky. ” Ashwin has been one at his best this season both with his batting and bowling, speaking about his evolution, the 35 year old said that he has tried to bring more intensity to the game. “Only thing that I’ve consciously done all through over the last two years is try and raise the intensity for every ball that I have bowled and for every ball that I have batted,” Ashwin said. The off spinner will be crucial for Royals after their loss against Titans. Bangalore will be riding high on confidence after comprehensively defeating Lucknow. Royals do have ex-RCB stars like Devdutt Padikkal and Yuzvendra Chahal in their ranks, who have the ability to come clutch alongside Aswhin.

That's now wins by a combined 56 points to six against the second-placed Storm and third-placed Cowboys in recent weeks, putting them in a clear bracket on their own at the top of the NRL hierarchy. Co-captain Isaah Yeo split the line after just a couple of minutes, and were it not for some brave defence on their own line by North Queensland and an incredible bombed try from Izack Tago, it could have been a cricket score before the interval.

Cleary believed a penalty was sufficient for the former. \"It was a little bit dangerous, I don't think it was anything too crazy about it,\" he said, while adding he didn't see the second incident. Five-eighth Jarome Luai also raised eyebrows after a shoulder charge on Scott Drinkwater, and could be in danger of missing the Blues' opener against Queensland should he be heftily charged.
